While neutralization is a primary function of antibodies in protection against most viruses, the relative contribution of Fcdependent and complement-dependent anti-viral activities of antibodies was found to vary between different viruses in recent studies. The multiple hit model explains how antibodies neutralize viruses, and recent data on the stoichiometry of antibody neutralization suggest that the organization of viral surface proteins on viruses, in addition to virus size, influences the level of antibody occupancy required for neutralization.

Although numerous passive antibody protection studies against different viruses using different animal models have been conducted, we do not seem to have a definite answer (reviewed in [6] ). Nevertheless, there are certain generalizations that may hold true for most of the cases: (i) antibodies that neutralize in vitro usually protect better than antibodies that do not neutralize, (ii) non-NAbs may protect but are dependent on Fc-mediated effector functions, and (iii) F(ab 0 ) 2 portion of NAbs can also protect although their activity is usually less potent than whole IgG.",

These functions include activation of the complement cascade, which can result in lysis of the pathogens or infected cells by CDC. Immune complexes (antibody-coated pathogens) can then activate antigen-presenting cells via Fc and complement receptors [16] , resulting in uptake and processing for antigen presentation to the adaptive immune system. This way, viruses are removed from circulation by phagocytosis [17, 18] and the process of adaptive immune system priming is initiated and accelerated at the same time [19, 20 ] . Other effector functions of antibodies depend on interaction with Fc receptors (FcRs) expressed on immune cells, which is regulated by the combination of antibody isotypes and FcR classes [21] . ADCC, for instance, describes lysis of antibody-flagged cells by natural killer (NK) cells, which is triggered by signaling of antibodies of the IgG1 and IgG3 bound on the surface of infected cells via the low-affinity FcRgIIIa (CD16a).",

In general, in vitro neutralization generally correlates well with protection in vivo. There are only a few exceptions such as Ebola virus where even high titers of NAbs failed to protect monkeys from lethal infection [22 ] . Complement has been described to be important for antibodymediated protection against several viral infections [14, 23, 24] . For HIV, it has been demonstrated that an HIV-1 neutralizing monoclonal antibody (MAb) engineered not to activate complement is as protective as the wild-type antibody. However, when both, complement and FcR binding were abolished, the same antibody showed reduced in vivo protective capacity [9 ]. Moreover, complement-mediated virolysis has been described during the acute phase of HIV-1 infection, but it does not seem to have an impact on the overall course of infection [25] . This clearly indicates that FcR but not complement binding are important to support the in vivo protective capacity of NAbs against HIV-1.",

            "text": "The two proposed models concerning the stoichiometry of antibody neutralization of viruses, the single hit and multiple hit models, have been hotly debated in the field although the single hit model has been largely refuted today (reviewed in [26] ). In the single hit model, a single antibody molecule, binding to a crucial site on the virus, is sufficient to neutralize a virion. The multiple hit model suggests that multiple antibody molecules are required to neutralize a virion. This model is explained partly by steric hindrance caused by antibody occupancy on viral surface, restricting the viral surface proteins (SUs) of nonenveloped viruses (e.g. VP1, VP2, and VP3 of poliovirus) and enveloped viruses (e.g. gp120 and gp41 of HIV) from interacting with cellular receptors for attachment, or with cofactors essential for post-attachment events of entry (reviewed in [6, 26] ). The multiple hit model is gaining further recognition with several recent studies. Yang et al. suggested that to neutralize HIV-1 it would be necessary to occupy every functional envelope (Env) trimer (trimeric complex of gp120 and gp41 heterodimers) with at least one antibody molecule [8] . Given an average of 8-10 Env trimers are present on each HIV-1 virion [27] , theoretically it would require 10 antibody molecules to neutralize an HIV-1 virion. Furthermore, the same group also showed that virus neutralization can be mediated simply by antibody binding without involving any functionally crucial site on SUs as proposed in the single hit model [28] . The authors inserted a foreign FLAG tag into the functionally unimportant V4 region of gp120 of different HIV isolates and found that an anti-FLAG antibody neutralized the different isolates equally well irrespective of their natural resistance to anti-HIV antibodies, supporting antibody binding/occupancy is the principal determinant for virus neutralization, in agreement with a previous study [29] . In parallel, Pierson et al. investigated the stoichiometry of antibody neutralization of West Nile virus (WNV) and also found that WNV can only be neutralized by multiple hits, although neutralization was achieved by antibody binding to as few as 30 of the 180 Env proteins present on each virion [7 ] .",

            "text": "Recent stoichiometric studies have provided additional insights into our understanding of virus neutralization in a spatial context. It was proposed that the extent of antibody coating on virion surface, that is, the number of antibody molecules, required for neutralization, appeared to be directly proportional to virion size for most viruses [6] . However, if antibody occupancy on the viral surface is the sole factor dictating virus neutralization, an intriguing question is why more antibody molecules are required to neutralize WNV than HIV-1 (30 versus 10 antibodies/virion) although HIV-1 is significantly larger than WNV (120 versus 50 nm in diameter) [27, 30] ? The discrepancy may be explained by a number of factors concerning SU organization on virions (Figure 1 ). For WNV and flaviviruses, SUs are packed regularly on the icosahedral virions, therefore the level of antibody occupancy required for neutralization is proportional to virus size, as found in many other viruses with regularly packed SUs (e.g. 38 antibody molecules are required to neutralize papillomavirus, which is slightly bigger than a flavivirus, reviewed in [6]). For HIV-1, SUs (as Env trimeric complexes) scatter sparsely on the viral surface [27] . Importantly, a single functional HIV Env trimer is sufficient to mediate viral entry. In comparison, for influenza virus, 8-9 Env trimers are required [31] . In addition, free SUs on a fluid (non-rigid) viral membrane may be able to float away from areas occupied by bound antibodies. Consequently, neutralization of HIV-1 will require occupancy of every Env trimer irrespective of virus size. For more densely packed virions, for example, WNV, steric hindrance by antibody binding may be extended to neighboring SUs, therefore the level of antibody occupancy required for neutralization may be predictable from virus size. In both viral examples, virus neutralization is mediated by antibody occupancy, but the specific infectivity and organization of SUs vary between the viruses. Therefore, it may be more appropriate to consider antibody occupancy, that is, the molecular ratio between the total number of avail- Factors influencing antibody neutralization of viruses. There are a number of factors in the structure of viruses and antibodies that influence the stoichiometry of neutralization by antibody occupancy. (i) The density of SU packing on the viral surface determines whether steric hindrance due to binding of an antibody to a SU complex can be extended to the neighboring complexes. High antibody occupancy will be required for neutralization of viruses with low SU density. (ii) Spacing between neutralizing epitopes determines if an antibody molecule can bind multivalently. This is dependent on both SU spacing and antibody isotype. If an antibody can bind to more than one SU, low antibody occupancy may be sufficient for neutralization. (iii) Unoccupied SU complexes on enveloped viruses may be able to move laterally to reduce steric hindrance caused by neighboring antibody-bound spikes. Consequently, a higher degree of antibody occupancy is required for neutralization compared with viruses with a rigid SU organization. (iv) Certain epitopes may not be easily accessible to antibodies because they can be occluded intramolecularly and intermolecularly. Epitopes located in a recessed area or near glycans on SUs, proximal to neighboring SUs or viral membrane, usually require higher antibody concentrations to achieve neutralizing occupancy than well-exposed epitopes. With regard to antibodies, (v) antibody isotype determines the valency, span-width and flexibility of an antibody, and (vi) antibody affinity determines the effectiveness and kinetics of antibody binding. Combining the viral factors outlined above and overall avidity of the antibody/virus interaction, the antibody concentration required to achieve neutralizing occupancy is determined.",

            "text": "Certain RNA viruses and retroviruses, in particular, have developed an array of specialized features in their SUs, for example, hyperglycosylation on exposed faces and hypermutations at non-essential regions, to escape NAbs (reviewed in [32] ). As a result, these viruses can exist in numerous antigenic or serotypic varieties that cannot be targeted by traditional passive or active immunization. However, a few areas on their SUs are refractory to mutation due to functional constraints, for example, receptor binding sites. Therefore, antibodies to epitopes overlapping areas important for SU functions are usually associated with a neutralizing activity against several strains, and these antibodies are known as broadly NAbs [4 , 35,36 ,37] . In an effort to maximize the potency and breadth of antibody protection against such highly variable viruses, isolate-specific and non-neutralizing antibodies are generally not considered as effective as NAbs targeting conserved epitopes. Currently there is no unified system for the definition of NAb breadth, and it is important to clarify that an antibody with broad neutralizing activity does not necessarily mean this NAb can crossneutralize all viral genotypes or isolates [36 ,37-39] . Nevertheless, the assessment of neutralization breadth of antibodies has been recognized as a key issue in vaccine development in the HIV field and strategies for the analysis of NAb responses induced by immunization have been proposed [40] . Important questions are how many conserved neutralizing epitopes exist on different viruses, how these epitopes are arranged on the viral surface, and whether such arrangement of SUs would allow the simultaneous binding of antibodies with complementary specificities thus justifying the cost of developing multiple MAbs? At this juncture, MAb cocktails formulated to target multiple neutralizing epitopes simultaneously are believed to reduce the risk of virus escape and, possibly, enhance neutralization through synergism. Recent studies on MAb cocktails against SARS coronavirus [41] and rabies virus (RV) [42] have suggested such benefits. More data concerning the efficiency of single MAb formulations and the significance of virus escape are expected from the use of palivizumab, a broadly neutralizing humanized MAb to the F protein of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), in prophylaxis against severe RSV disease in high-risk infants and children (reviewed in [4 ]). Although escape viruses in cell culture, animal models and humans have been reported for palivizumab, it is unclear if the escape mutants will be pathogenic and selectively amplified in human populations with prolonged use of palivizumab, thus reducing the value of the MAb. It is crucial to follow up the long-term effect of palivizumab on circulating RSV to determine if a MAb cocktail is required to target multiple conserved epitopes on RSV and on other infectious agents.",

            "text": "For diseases where traditional attempts failed to provide effective vaccines, for example, HIV and HCV, it will be important to investigate whether a knowledge-based approach can bring new hope to developing vaccines. A considerable amount of scientific knowledge on the requirements for virus neutralization and antibody protection, and on the structures of conserved neutralizing epitopes and SU organization has now been unfolded in recent studies. This should allow one to attempt a rational approach to vaccine development aiming at inducing protective antibody responses. Figure 2 outlines a scheme of knowledge-based vaccine design that is currently under intense research in the HIV research community. This scientific path, also known as 'reverse vaccinology or retrovaccinology' [33] , includes first identifying the specific antibody responses responsible for virus neutralization and protection [36 ,37,38] , followed by defining 490 Antibody Therapeutics Knowledge-based vaccine design to elicit protective antibodies. To improve vaccine components for the induction of protective antibody responses, one should first define the specificities and magnitude of antibody responses required for protection. One method is to isolate MAbs from subjects who develop protective antibody responses after infection or vaccination, and to identify the MAbs that neutralize the virus in vitro and protect a relevant animal model against virus challenge in passive transfer experiments. Preferably, the MAbs should recognize multiple conserved neutralizing determinants on a given virus. The next step is to define the neutralizing epitopes. X-ray crystallographic and cryo-electron microscopic techniques have recently been applied to dissect neutralizing epitopes structurally and spatially, providing important insights into the conditions required for virus neutralization. The information will provide a template for designing immunogens to favorably present the desired neutralizing epitopes. A major gap requiring further scientific breakthrough is the precise mechanisms of how immunogens are handled and processed in vivo to activate specific B cells to produce the targeted NAbs. Candidates with the desired antigenic properties will then be screened for immunogenicity in animal models to confirm if the immunogens elicit the desired antibody responses and to protect the animals from virus challenge. Immunogens that produce equivalent or better humoral responses without the side effects associated with traditional vaccines would be a favorable candidate for further clinical evaluation. The molecular models used in the illustration are b12 IgG (Protein Data Bank PDB entry 1HZH) and b12 Fab fragment in complex with gp120 of HIV-1 (PDB entry 2NY7). the structural determinants in virus neutralization [7 ,27,30,35] and by applying the molecular/structural information to designing mimics of the epitopes to focus antibody responses on the broadly neutralizing epitopes in immunization [32] . It is hoped that this approach can overcome the limitations of traditional vaccine.",

The multiple dimensions of antiviral activity of antibodies help prevent infection and lower viral burden, thus reducing cell death, extreme immunological reactions, and clinical symptoms. We have summarized some of the recent studies that have broadened our thinking about the mechanisms of antibody protection and that we believe will help the field to refine strategies in improving passive antibodies and vaccine development. The application of multiple advanced techniques including X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM for structural modeling of viral SUs and their packing on viral surface, and the determination of stoichiometry for antibody neutralization of viruses, have not only increased our understanding of the molecular basis of antibody neutralization of viruses but also provided additional rationale in the selection of neutralizing epitopes to target by passive antibodies and the formulation of MAb cocktails. Evidence that different pathogens require different effector functions of antibodies has also created new opportunities in the engineering of Fc fragment for passive antibodies, or in the choice of adjuvants and delivery methods in vaccination to favor the induction of a particular antibody isotype, to focus on the most effective effector functions for a particular viral disease.",

A major argument against humoral responses had been based on reported cases of protective immunity developed in vaccinated humans who failed to elicit rigorous antibody responses and in those who suffered from agammaglobuinemia. A similar argument is also commonly found today in other viral diseases where protection mechanism is unclear, for example, HCV. This study conclusively demonstrates that humoral, but not cell-mediated immunity, plays a central role in vaccine-induced protection. ",
