In this communication, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of two SARS vaccine candidates based on the recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) expressing SARS-CoV spike or nucleocapsid proteins in ferrets. No clinical signs were observed in all the ferrets challenged with SARS-CoV. On the other hand, vaccination did not prevent SARS-CoV infection in ferrets. In contrast, immunized ferrets (particularly those immunized with rMVA-spike) exhibited significantly stronger inflammatory responses and focal necrosis in liver tissue after SARS-CoV challenge than control animals. Thus, our data suggest that enhanced hepatitis is linked to vaccination with rMVA expressing SARS-CoV antigens. Crown",

The OD readings from the reaction between sera and the SARS-CoV infected Vero-E6 cell lysate (positive control) and the mock-infected lysate (negative control) were compared and the positive/negative (P/N) ratio was calculated to determine the ELISA results. Mean negative P/N ratio was established using a total of 60 sera provided by Marshall Farms and was determined as 1.43 with a standard deviation of 0.36.

However, the viral RNA was detected in feces, pharyngeal swabs and blood samples by RT-PCR (Table 1C) . The viral RNA could be detected in pharyngeal swabs and feces from all ferrets within the first 7 days of the challenge. Moreover, infectious virus could be isolated from selected pharyngeal swabs early in the infection (up to 5 days post infection, data not shown). The viral RNA declined in feces from all ferrets to undetectable level after 6 days post challenge. In contrast, most of the ferrets (10 out of 12) continued to shed virus in their pharyngeal secretion 10 days post challenge. In fact, two ferrets (#5 vaccinated with the rMVA-N and #8 vaccinated with rMVA-S) still shed virus in the pharyngeal excretion up to 22 days post challenge. Interestingly, no viral RNA was found in blood specimens until 8 days post challenge (except ferret #10, a PBS control for vaccination). However, on average the viral RNA persisted in blood longer than in pharyngeal excretion and feces (except ferret #12 in which no viral RNA was detected in blood through the whole course of the study). Our data indicate that SARS-CoV replicates in ferrets and that replication can last for up to 3 weeks. However, further studies are required to elucidate the kinetics of the virus replication in ferrets.",

Most notably, a neutralizing antibody response was observed in the sera from ferrets vaccinated with the rMVA-S as early as 3 days after the SARS-CoV challenge while neutralizing antibody was only detected in other ferrets 7 days after SARS-CoV inoculation. This shows that rapid memory immune response occurred in the ferrets immunized with rMVA-S following SARS-CoV challenge. Furthermore, ferrets immunized with the rMVA-S developed peak neutralizing antibody titre between days 7 and 9 post challenge with SARS-CoV (Table 1C ). In contrast, other challenged ferrets developed comparable levels of neutralizing antibodies between 19 and 21 days after the SARS-CoV challenge (Table 1B) . The neutralizing antibody response corresponds with the serum IgG titre determined by ELISA (Table 1A) . The rapid and vigorous neutralizing antibody response induced by immunization with the rMVA-S did not lead to the prevention of SARS-CoV dissemination as evidenced by the presence of virus in all the clinical specimens (Table 1C) .",

Using the VetTest \u00ae dry chemistry analyzer (IDEXX Laboratories Inc., USA), blood samples taken at various time points were examined for the levels of alkaline phosphatase (an indicator of hepatic disease involving the biliary system), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, an indicator of hepatic parenchymal lesions), albumin (an indicator of abnormality of hepatic and renal function), creatinine (an indicator of renal disease), total bilirubin (an indicator of obstructive liver disease), total protein (indicator of abnormality of hepatic and renal function) and urea (an indicator of renal disease). Surprisingly, ferrets vaccinated with rMVA-N or rMVA-S demonstrated a significantly higher level of ALT after challenge with SARS-CoV than the control ferrets (Fig. 2 , panels A-E). The elevated level of ALT was evidenced by day 5 post SARS-CoV challenge and lasted until day 21. All the other parameters tested fell into the normal or slightly higher (alkaline phophatase) physiological range compared to the reference value (IDEXX Laboratories Inc., USA, data not shown).",

In correlation with the elevated ALT level, ferrets immunized with rMVA-S developed significantly more severe lesions including focal liver cell necrosis than all the other infected animals (Fig. 3) . In particular, ferret #9, which developed the most rapid and vigorous antibody response, had the most severe hepatitis. In contrast, only mild hepatitis was observed in control animals receiving parental MVA or PBS. Although ferrets immunized with rMVA-N also demonstrated elevated level of ALT, only one ferret (#4) developed more severe hepatitis than control animals (severity between the rMVA-S immunized ferrets and the controls as observed post mortem). It should be mentioned that the tissue specimen for the pathological sectioning was collected post mortem (27-29 days after the challenge); by then the ALT level had already declined to (or slightly below) the normal range (Fig. 2, panel E) . Therefore, it is likely that the liver inflammation shown in Fig. 3 may not truly reflect the severity of the hepatitis associated with rMVA-S or rMVA-N vaccination and SARS-CoV challenge. Detailed pathological examination at the time when the ALT level is at the highest should be performed in the future studies. In correlation with the data shown in Table 1C , no viral RNA was found in any tissue collected from the post mortem examination (28 and 29 days after the challenge). Other organs were only mildly affected by SARS-CoV infection (data not shown).",

            "text": "Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of viral infectivity has been described for several viruses [10, 11] . It was well documented that neutralizing antibody induced by the spike protein of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV, also a coronavirus) failed to protect cats from the virus challenge [12] . On the contrary, antibodies acquired either through a passive transfer of immune serum against the spike protein of FIPV [13] or by immunization with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the spike protein [14] often lead to accelerated infection by the mechanism of ADE of the virus infectivity. More recently, the enhanced susceptibility to FIPV has also been linked to the immune responses induced by the virus membrane and nucleocapsid protein co-delivered with interleukin-12 [15] . SARS-CoV has been shown to infect hepatocytes and cause hepatitis in humans [16] . Therefore, our observation that immunization with rMVA-S induced enhanced hepatitis in ferrets after SARS-CoV challenge is in line with the previous reports on ADE of FIPV infection. A failure to observe detectable immune response induced by rMVA-N and an inconsistent link between the rMVA-N vaccination and enhanced liver inflammation may be due to the lack of optimization of the immunization regimen in this experiment. Further investigation to improve the immune responses by the use of different immunization regimen, more ferrets (which would allow a post mortem examination at various time points after vaccination and challenge), more detailed analysis of the immune responses and immunohistological studies should aid in understanding the link between the immune responses induced by SARS-CoV antigens and the enhanced liver inflammation. Moreover, to further confirm the observation of vaccination enhanced hepatitis in ferrets after challenge with SARS-CoV, other vaccination strategies, e.g. inactivated vaccine, recombinant adenovirus based vaccine, subunit vaccine, should be examined in the similar fashion as reported in this communication.",

First, rMVA-S can induce rapid and vigorous neutralizing antibody response in ferrets challenged with SARS-CoV; however, such neutralizing antibody did not prevent virus infection and spreading. Second, vaccination with SARS-CoV S and/or N protein may lead to enhanced pathology during SARS-CoV infection of liver and may cause damage of the liver. Third, although SARS-CoV does not cause clinical disease in ferrets, our results suggest that ferret may be a useful model for evaluating the safety of the vaccination strategy. Finally, we would like to suggest that extra caution must be taken in future human trials of SARS vaccines due to the potential organ damage resulting from immunizations.",
