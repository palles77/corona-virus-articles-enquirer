After five hours, the media was changed and the new media was supplemented with the compounds. Forty-eight hours later, supernatants were harvested and the virus-like particles (VLPs) were purified through a 20% (wt/vol) sucrose cushion at 21,000 \u00d7 g for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. Viral pellets were resuspended in 50 \u00b5l of phosphate-buffered saline solution. Subconfluent monolayers of 293T cells seeded in 35-mm cultures were infected using 10 \u00b5l of the viral pellets resuspension. Compounds were added to the media, and the cells were incubated for 48 hours. Infectivity assays were performed by two different methods: western blotting and percentage of Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP)-positive 293T cells. For western blots, the cells were harvest forty-eight hours after the infection and western blots were carried out according to Lammeli 3 on a 4-15% polyacrylamide gel and the proteins were transferred into a nitrocellulose membrane. The membranes were incubated with a 1:2500 dilution of the rabbit anti-GFP antibody (AB10145, Millipore) and a 1:1000 dilution of the monoclonal anti-HIV1 p24 antibody (NIH Reagent program). An anti-heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was used to normalize bands density values. To calculate the percentage of GFP-positive 293T cells, fortyeight hours after the infection, the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature. Nuclei were stained with DAPI and the fixed cells were mounted using Mowiol (Sigma-Aldrich). Imaging experiments were performed on a Nikon Ti-Eclipse inverted wide-field microscope (Nikon Corp.) using a 10\u00d7 objective lens (NA 0.30), as previously described. Images were collected using a CoolSnap HQ camera (Photometrics) and Nikon NIS Elements software (v4.00.03). Large format images were acquired using differential interference contrast and the following excitation/emission (nanometer ranges) filter sets: 325 to 375/435 to 485 (DAPI), 490 to 520/520 to 550 (yellow fluorescent protein [YFP]), and 565 to 590/590 to 650 (mCherry). In each experiment that was carried out, the total cells and the infected cells of 10 different fields of view were counted by two different observers. The percentage of infected cells for each mutant were normalized by WT. Results are provided on pages S28 and S29.",

Measurements were taken at 260 nm. ",
