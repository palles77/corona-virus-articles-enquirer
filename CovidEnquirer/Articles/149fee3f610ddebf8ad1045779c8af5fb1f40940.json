As a result, the process relies upon the earliest possible detection of emerging antigenic variants and the most up-to-date information on their potential future epidemiological significance. Information must therefore be collected year round on the continuous evolution and global circulation of human influenza viruses to provide a sound basis for the biannual WHO recommendations on the composition of influenza vaccines for use in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.

MN assays are generally more sensitive and measure a broader repertoire of functional antibodies that neutralize viral replication, with potential advantages in the evaluation of human serological responses. In addition, comparisons of MN and HAI tests for measuring antibody responses in vaccinated individuals have shown a consistent degree of correlation and have confirmed the utility of MN assays in analyses of human antibody responses to H3 vaccine components. Techniques for simplifying assay formats and making them more readily applicable to the routine testing of low-titre viruses are under investigation, and efforts are under way to use MN assays for H1 and B viruses. This should facilitate the use of MN assays to overcome the variable nature of interactions between viruses and RBCs, and hence in interpreting 'anomalous' HAI results which complicate vaccine virus selection. Pseudotype virus neutralization assays may also offer some advantages in scale and standardization over conventional MN assays for measuring serological responses to particular viruses, especially highly pathogenic viruses. Furthermore, ongoing improvements in automation will potentially enable the more labour-intensive MN assay to be applied to large-scale serological analysis. Epitope mapping using genome fragment phage display libraries provides another powerful technique for further dissecting the fine specificity of antibody responses to vaccination and infection and should allow for a better assessment of the quality of a 'protective' immune response and aid the development of additional correlates of immunity.",

In-depth analyses of the precise mechanisms involved in the evolution and epidemiology of influenza would require advanced bioinformatics tools to comprehensively mine the data produced. Such an approach should reveal, for example, the broader genetic changes that underlie antigenic variation in HA and thus allow for a better understanding of the relationship between genetic evolution and antigenic drift. Increased information from X-ray crystallography on the structural features of the HAs of recent viruses and specific mutants, together with developments in computer modelling, should assist in attempts to predict the likely influence of amino acid substitutions on the antigenic and receptor-binding properties of new variants. Further development of high-throughput laboratory systems for integrated and automated genetic and phenotypic analyses -from initial sample accession to data management -offers the intriguing prospect of a futuristic standardized virtual network for virus characterization in an epidemiological context. As such systems will have broad implications, not only for vaccine virus selection, but also for the organization and conduct of global influenza surveillance, it is extremely important that their development and deployment are integrated with the activities of the WHO GISRS.",
