One locally transmitted case was reported from Texas; other cases resulted from travelers returning from affected regions (Fig. 2) . 8 There is a risk that the virus will be imported to new areas by infected travelers.",

The epidemic on Reunion Island underscored the risks associated with CHIKV, where encephalitis causing death or adverse longterm sequellae were reported. 1, 2 Perinatal transmission resulting in encephalitis and limitations in neuropsychomotor development in children were reported. 1, 21, 23 CHIKV disease can also evolve into chronic illness, characterized by persisting polyarthralgia and joint stiffness. 7, 9, 11, 22 This chronic CHIKV stage has been reported to severely incapacitate patients for a duration of weeks, and in some cases even several years after the initial infection. 1, 2, 7, [9] [10] [11] [12] It is often referred to as an arthritogenic alphavirus. 22 The acute phase of Chikungunya (CHIKF) often comes on abruptly, although it can also take a couple of days. 7, 8, 11, [22] [23] [24] CHIKV causes high fever, and severe multi-joint pain, as well as muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue, and a rash (Tables 1 and 2) that follows an average incubation period of 5-7 days. [1] [2] [3] 7, 8, 11, [22] [23] [24] Subclinical infection does occur, but the exact occurrence is unknown, with ranges from 3% to 25%, 11, 25 but most patients are expected to have acute symptoms, that can last up to 2 weeks. Not unlike the symptoms of other tropical arthritogenic alphaviruses, CHIKV can cause very severe joint pain, not unlike \"break bone fever\" of dengue, also requiring narcotics, and has a variable duration. 1, [7] [8] [9] [22] [23] [24] [25] These alphaviruses have a special tropism for bone and joint tissue. 26 After the acute phase, CHIKF is not infrequently followed by chronic, episodic, and often debilitating joint pain, swelling, myalgia, fatigue, even depression, and cognitive issues. Patients can develop chronic rheumatic disorders that are not dissimilar to rheumatoid arthritis and anklyosing spondylitis. 11 Table 1 http://www.chikungunya.in/dengue-chikungunya-differences.shtml.",

Joint damage may be related to viral ability to cause host cellular processes, such as inflammatory response (macrophages, T cells, and antibodies). Chikungunya can be considered a fever, rash, arthralgia syndrome. These chronic arthralgias can persist for months, even years. Risk factors such as older age have been identified. 5, 11 An index of suspicion is important, especially in treating patients returning from endemic areas. Other less publicized viruses including, but not limited to Ross River, and Barmah Forest viruses can also cause such symptoms. 22 Chikungunya shares a common vector, as well as clinical features with dengue, posing a risk for both co-infection, and misdiagnosis (Table 1) .",

The progression from acute infection to persistent arthralgias/arthritis may involve macrophage virus tropism, local virus persistence, and inflammatory responses. CHIKV has been associated with varying degrees of cytokine responses, involving interleukins, and INF alpha. There has been a difference in the cytokine profile during acute and chronic phases of CHIKV. 11, 22, [27] [28] [29] [30] CHIKV is tropic to fibroblasts of joints, muscles, and skin, as well as central nervous system (CNS) cells. Of note, some of it has been shown that CHIKV RNA has not been detected in the joint tissue of during the chronic disease phase, suggesting CHIK arthritis may be the result of a post-infectious inflammatory disorder, and an autoimmune response is triggered. 11, 31 Some research suggests arthralgias induced by Chikungunya virus infection are associated with interleukin 6 and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor. 28,29 Table 2 Abstracted from CDC and http://www.denguevirusnet.com/compare-dengue-zika-and-chikungunya.html.",

            "text": "There appear to be clinical similarities of CHIKV arthritis and rheumatoid arthritis and related disorders; some suggest disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) should be considered for the treatment of what is now referred to as post-Chikungunya chronic inflammatory rheumatism (pCHIK-CIR). 11, 46 Guidelines for the management of Chikungunya arthropathy (2014) have been proposed. 11, 44 These guidelines suggest patients with rheumatic symptoms of more than 3 months duration should be referred to rheumatologists for further evaluation, and disease categorization. Based upon these guidelines treatment options include methotrexate (MTX) sulfasalazine (SSZ), leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), NSAIDs, or immunobiologicals. 11, 44 Of note there have been several publications promoting the use of HCQ as first-line therapy for CHIKF arthritis. There is limited evidence of efficacy. Brito et al. recommend HCQ (6 mg/kg/day), with evaluation every 6 weeks using the visual pain scale (VAS) as the primary outcome measure as a decision point whether to discontinue therapy, or add another medication-SSZ (1000 mg/day). 11 They suggest after 36 weeks, initiate MTX therapy (at an initial oral dose of 10 mg/week). 11,43 But a study comparing chloroquine (CQ) to placebo revealed there was no reduction in joint pain severity or duration. 11 In vitro, CQ and HCQ may inhibition CHIKV replication, but one study did not identify significant differences in the duration of febrile arthralgia or viremia in patients treated with CQ vs placebo. 11 Also noted CQ was compared to meloxicam in 70 patients, resulting in no differences in chronic symptoms (46 weeks) . Other studies question HCQ and CQ in the treatment of CHIK arthritis. 11 CQ-treated patients were tested for and found to maintain persistently elevated levels of IL-6 and IL-13. This puts into question whether this antimalarial can confer immunomodulatory benefit. 11 Glucocorticosteroids have been tried as a treatment for CHIKV arthritis. 11 During the CHIKF outbreak on Reunion Island, Simon et al. described significant improvement in symptoms associated with tenosynovitis and polyarthritis. Also low dose prednisone provided months after the acute illness, enhanced ability to ambulate. 11 In another study, Sissoko et al. evaluated 147 patients who had had CHIKF. In that study, 57% had persistent or recurrent joint pain. They demonstrated better symptomatic improvement comparing glucocorticoids to NSAIDs and acetaminophen. 11 In a Dominican Republic outbreak, 370 of 514 (72%) CHIKV arthritis patients were treated with glucocorticoids with good clinical response. 3, 11 In another study 12-week study of 120 patients that evaluated treatment of early stage CHIKF musculoskeletal symptoms, Padmakumar et al. 43 compared NSAID monotherapy (aceclofenac 200 mg/day), NSAID in combination with HCQ (aceclofenac and HCQ 400 mg/day), NSAID in combination with corticosteroid (aceclofenac and prednisolone 10 mg/day), and triple therapy (aceclofenac, prednisolone, and HCQ). Improvement in pain reduction or improvement in quality of life was greatest in the NSAID plus glucocorticoid group. They report no greater benefit resulted from the addition of HCQ. 3, 11, 43 Corticosteroids should be limited to short-term therapy referable to potential toxicity. Available reports do not suggest corticosteroid-induced exacerbation of CHIKV infection when glucocorticoid therapy is utilized during the chronic phase of infection.",

In terms of their use in arbovirus arthropathy, limited information exists documenting the safe and effective use of biologic therapies for CHIK arthritis. Among 147 chronic arthritis patients treated during an outbreak on Martinique, most patients were treated with MTX (up to 25 mg/week) with good results; 12 patients received anti-TNF therapy. The mechanism of action associated with Methotrexate includes inhibiting cell proliferation by inhibiting purines and pyrimidines; it acts as an anti-folate agent. 3, 11, 43 Although the precise mechanism of methotrexate associated anti-inflammatory action remains yet to be fully elucidated, it may be the result of induction release of adenosine. Adenosine is associated with the suppression of neutrophil, macrophages/monocytes, dendritic cell and lymphocyte inflammatory function. 3, 11, 47, 48 The antiinflammatory effect of MTX on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is thought to involve the inhibition of the following proinflammatory cytokines: IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF-\u03b1. Methotrexate is also thought to affect neutrophil chemotaxis, the proliferation of synovial fibroblasts and lymphocytes, and increases the production of IL-4 and IL-10, and other cytokines. 11, 47 Over the years much clinical experience and benefit of MTX as a treatment of RA and related inflammatory arthropathies has been realized. Moreover ready availability and relative cost effectiveness make MTX attractive as a potential treatment for persistent CHIKV arthritis. Overall it is well tolerated. 11 During a Dominican Republic epidemic, 53 of 328 rheumatoid arthritis patients developed CHIKF while on biologic therapy. Their illness was similar to other patients treated for CHIKF during this outbreak. Of note, the use of biologic therapy did not appear to protect against or exacerbate their CHIK infection. 3 Multiple studies have evaluated MTX in this setting. For example, a cohort treated initially with SSZ plus HCQ, which failed to achieve a clinical response at 3 months, was given MTX, which resulted in a significant benefit. 48 Other studies demonstrate patients experiencing complete resolution of chronic joint symptoms with the use of MTX without significant toxicity. 3, 11, 41, 48 Improvement in symptoms, radiological findings, and inflammatory markers after 4 months of MTX therapy was demonstrated.",
