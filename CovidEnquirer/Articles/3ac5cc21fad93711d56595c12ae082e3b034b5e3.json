Because most of these infections commonly occur as enzootics in calves < 3 wk of age, enhancement of passive immunity may be an effective approach for their control. Passive immunity to enteric viruses such as rotaviruses and coronaviruses is associated with ingestion of colostrum or milk containing high concentrations of specific antibodies (lactogenic immunity). Antibodies in blood serum generally appear to be of less value in protection against these viruses (67, 68) . This review describes the currently known diarrheagenic viruses of calves including their epidemiology, pathogenicity, and pathogenesis. It also focuses on passive lactogenic immunity, including ways to enhance this immunity by immunization of pregnant cows. An analysis of passive protection in calves fed various colostrum supplements is reported. Table 1 is a description of each of the currently known bovine enteric diarrheagenic viruses. Half of these viruses have been identified only within the last 5 yr, so only limited information is available about their antigenicity, pathogenicity, or epidemiology.",

However, rotaviruses from all species also share common group-specific antigens detectable by complement fixation, immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and other serological tests (24) .

Enteroviruses and reoviruses (Table 2 ) frequently have been detected in calf feces but have not been reported to cause diarrhea. By analogy to similar viruses in other species these two viruses presumably replicate in intestinal lymphoid tissue (80) , and this may explain their failure to cause diarrhea.

The first type of virus (Type 1, Table 2 ) infects villous epithelial cells and usually does not cause systemic infections. This includes coronavirus, rotavirus, and the newly described viruses. In contrast, viruses of the second type infect primarily crypt enterocytes and intestinal lymphoid cells and usually cause systemic infections. Type 2 viruses presently include parvovirus and BVD virus ( Table 2) . Type 1 viruses are thought to be transmitted by the fecal-oral route resulting in direct infection of villous epithelial cells via the luminal surface of these cells. Whether certain of these viruses also can be transmitted by aerosol exposure, with virus initially replicating in the oropharynx leading to massive doses of viruses being swallowed, is unclear and needs to be investigated. In preliminary studies in our laboratory, experimental oral/intranasal (IN) or IN exposure of colostrum-deprived or gnotobiotic calves to bovine coronavirus led to coronavirus antigen not only in the small intestine and colon but also in tracheal and nasal smears prepared at 2 to 3 days postexposure (DPE) (L. J. Sail, D. R. Redman, and K. W. Theil, unpublished observations). Replication of the coronavirus TGE also occurs in tissues of the upper respiratory tract (25) . These findings suggest the possibility that more labile enveloped enteric viruses such as coronavirus may undergo initial replication in the oropharynx contributing massive doses of virus to the small intestine. Viremia generally has not been reported for Type 1 viruses.",

Loss of these mature absorptive ceils leads to a malabsorption diarrheal syndrome typical of these viral infections. In a review of diarrheal pathogenesis, Moon (40) drew a corollary between the severity of various viral infections and the extent of viral replication in epithelial cells lining both the sides and tips of the villi. Whereas rotavirus mainly infects cells on the apical half of the villi (the more enzymatically mature cells) producing a milder, transient diarrhea, coronaviruses infect epithelial cells throughout the length of the villi causing more pronounced villous atrophy and also diarrhea. Epithelial cells on the villi tips constantly are being replaced by cells that proliferate in the crypts and migrate up the sides of the villi. The turnover rate of these ceils is slower in younger or gnotobiotic animals, leading to less rapid repair of villous atrophy, which may contribute to the enhanced susceptibility of neonates to these viral diarrheas (40) . Increased frequency of villous epithelial cell replacement and loss of the capacity to absorb macromolecules (Ig) from colostrum are age-related factors that may increase the resistance of older animals to viral diarrheas. Loss of the absorptive capacity may reduce the animal's susceptibility to enteric viral infections by eliminating the possible \"nonspecific\" uptake of viral or bacterial pathogens via the same pinocytotic pathway as the Ig are absorbed.",

For example, a virus such as astrovirus produces only a patchy fluorescence (indicative of only scattered infected cells), and in the calf this limited replication results in little villous atrophy or diarrhea (Table 5) . Coronavirus, however, produces an almost continuous infection of entire villous enterocytes throughout the distal portion of the small intestine and colon. It usually is associated with a severe diarrheal syndrome in experimentally inoculated or naturally infected calves (28, 35, 50) .

The IgGx, the major isotype in bovine mammary secretions, is transported actively from serum into colostrum (52) and also into milk (31, 47) , although less. Prevalence of IgG1 in milk is unique to ruminants, and IgA predominates in mammary secretions of monogastrics including humans (74) . In monogastric species, secretory IgA (SIgA) antibodies occur in milk after antigenic stimulation of the gastrointestinal tract of the dam, such as following an enteric infection (4, 7, 58, 59) . Parenteral immunization generally elicits only IgG milk antibodies (7, 58, 59) . Following local intestinal antigenic stimulation, IgA immunocytes migrate from the gut to the mammary gland where they secrete SIgA antibodies into the milk (57), thus establishing an \"enteromammary SIgA ]ink\". Thus, the antibody specificites of milk IgA reflect antigenic challenges in the intestinal tract of the dam.",

We found similar results in a preliminary study of oral administration of live virulent bovine rotavirus to five pregnant rotavirus seropositive cows; only IgGl rotavirus antibodies were elevated in mammary secretions of two of five cows (L. J. Sail, K. L. Smith, and D. R. Redman, unpublished observations). The source of elevated IgG1 oolostral and milk antibodies in these two studies is unclear. The former study demonstrated few IgGI producing cells in mammary secretions in spite of the predominately IgG1 response (13) . A possible explanation might be that IgG1 plasma cells, which occur in relatively large numbers in the intestines of adult ruminants (46) , contribute IgG1 antibodies (with specificity to enteric antigens) to serum and these then are transported actively to colostrum and milk. This also would explain the occurrence of predominately lgGt rotavirus or coronavirus antibodies in mammary secretions of naturally infected (presumably via the oral route) cows ( Figures  1 and 2 , Table 6 ). A similar mechanism recently has been proposed for the selective transport of dimeric serum lgA (most of which was produced by intestinal IgA plasma cells) to the colostrum in lactating mice (18) . These preliminary findings suggest enteric priming or boosting may not be an effective means of eliciting SIgA antibodies in bovine mammary secretions. Indeed, the bovine mammary gland generally has been described as deficient of IgA, which may relate to rumen development (53) . Although several studies have indicated bovine IgA milk antibodies are produced locally after intramammary (IMm) infusion of antigen (29) , the origin of these cells producing IgA is undefined.",

In these viral infections, passive immunity is contingent upon continuing adequate amounts of antibodies in the gut lumen for protection of villous enterocytes (21) . Serum-derived antibodies generally play a minor role, and there is usually little correlation between serum antibodies and infection (21, 37) . This is the reverse of the situation for Type 2 viruses. In studies of BVD and canine parvo-viral infections, there was a positive correlation between virus neutralizing antibody titers in blood serum (actively or passively acquired) and protection against infection (12, 55) . Presumably this is because the virus infects intestinal ceils via the hematogenous route. Therefore, neutralization of the virus before it reaches susceptible intestinal ceils may be a key factor in immunity against Type 2 viral infections.",

Their studies and another (65) showed various adjuvants differed in their ability to enhance rotavirus antibody titers in mammary secretions. Our findings concur with these results; incorporation of Freund's incomplete adjuvant with the commercial rotacoronavirus vaccine led to enhanced colostral rotavirus antibody titers associated primarily with IgG1, whereas use of unadjuvantized vaccine did not increase significantly colostral antibody titers compared to controls ( Figure  3 ). However, antibody titers were still lower with the adjuvantized commercial vaccine than with the OARDC adjuvantized vaccine i.m. plus IMm (Figures 1 and 3) . Results of our studies did not demonstrate that use of adjuvant could boost nonspecifically antibody titers to an unrelated virus in seropositive animals, as concluded by others (77) .

Also, in considering the optimal virus dose, use of inactivated vaccines may necessitate use of higher titered virus or larger amounts to achieve the same effect as the live attenuated virus because the antigenicity of some viral proteins may be destroyed in the inactivation process. The effect of different inactivating agents also needs to be analyzed. In preliminary studies, we found differences in the antibody response to binary ethylenimine (BEI) inactivated versus B-propiolactone (BPL) inactivated bovine rotavirus. Although both agents successfully inactivated rotavirus, antibody titers were about 10 times greater in mammary secretions of cows vaccinated with BEI inactivated rotavirus compared to those vaccinated with BPL inactivated rotavirus.",

The rationale for this feeding regimen was: 1) feeding of normal control colostrum (to rotavirus challenged calves) at this concentration 2 or 3 times/day did not protect against rotavirus diarrhea or shedding, whereas feeding higher concentrations of control colostrum did provide partial immunity; and 2) rotavirus antibody titers in the 7-and 30-day milk samples from all cows declined to about 1% of the initial colostrum antibody titers (Figure 2 ). This decrease of milk antibody titers is similar to the decrease of total IgGl in the transition from colostrum to 7-to 28-day milk (79) . One group of experimental calves received no supplemental colostrum feeding. All calves were challenged orally with virulent NCDV bovine rotavirus at 12 to 30 h age and then monitored daily for occurrence of diarrhea and fecal rotavirus shedding by ELISA.

Investigators studying rotavirus (14, 16, 54, 58, 59) and TGE in swine (26) reported primarily lgG and transient IgA responses in convalescent serum following intestinal infections. This serum IgA response (mostly dimer IgA in swine and cattle) may represent transfer of intestinally sythesized IgA antibodies into the serum. Rapid disappearance of these serum IgA antibodies may relate to the reported selective transfer of dimeric serum IgA to other secretory sites (18) or back into the intestine via the bile (22) .",

The active immunity was indicated by a transient increase of blood serum IgA and IgM antibody following virus challenge. Observations were similar in studies of passive immunity in rotavirus-challenged gnotobiotic lambs fed homologous colostrum (67) or gnotobiotic piglets fed bovine colostrum (9) .

Virus excretion persisted for several days but was accompanied by mild diarrhea for only 1 day. A similar sequence of virus shedding occurred in two calves fed .1% colostrum from i.m. plus IMm cows and a calf fed 50% control colostrum. However, two of these latter three animals shed virus the day after colostrum feeding ceased. These observations raise the question as to the source of the rotavirus infection. The possibility that rotavirus was transmitted to these calves by the caretaker cannot be excluded totally. However, another plausible explanation may be that after initial rotavirus challenge, these animals developed a limited subclinical infection as indicated by development of IgA and IgM serum antibodies. This infection, kept in abeyance by daily colostrum feedings, sometimes resulted in a mild overt infection when colostrum feeding ceased. Other evidence supporting these conclusions is from protection studies in two rotavirus challenged gnotobiotic piglets fed bovine colostrum (9) . Both animals remained clinically normal during colostrum feeding, but after cessation, a similar subclinical excretion of virus commenced in one piglet, and both developed serum antibodies.",

Cessation of colostrum feeding led to susceptibility to disease or infection in several calves. Calves fed smaller amounts of i.m. plus IMm colostrum (.1%) or lower titered colostrum (50% control) usually commenced virus shedding earlier after colostrum feeding ceased than animals fed 1% high titered colostrum (i.m. plus IMm cows). These results may relate to higher titers of serum antibodies in this latter group of calves (1024 to 4096) compared to the previous calves (64 to 513). Such antibodies may be transferred from the serum back into the intestine, accounting for the persistence of IgG1 fecal antibodies after termination of colostrum feeding and providing transient passive protection. Other studies have documented the transport of serum lgG1 into the intestine in both sheep and cattle (15, 46) . Studies also indicated passively acquired serum rotavirus antibodies, in high titer, could protect against rotavirus-associated diarrhea in lambs (67) , and high serum Ig concentrations correlated with absence of diarrhea in young calves (33) . An alternative or additional explanation for the delayed onset of virus shedding and persistence of IgGl fecal antibodies after cessation of 1% colostrum feeding might be that rotavirus IgG1 colostral antibodies selectively bind to enterocytes, similar to colostral IgA in rats (45) , these high titered antibodies effectively blocking rotavirus infection.",

In cows colostral rotavirus antibodies decrease dramatically in the transition to milk, and this coincides with the peak occurrence of calf rotavirus infections at 5 to 14 days of age (3). This age-related susceptibility also may be influenced by a limited local protection provided by reverse transport of higher titered (in calves receiving adequate amounts of colostrum shortly after birth) serum IgG1 antibodies back into the intestine. Depending on a number of poorly understood variables, calves then may begin shedding rotavirus with or without accompanying disease. The present investigation and others (9, 67) indicate that whereas most animals that are protected while receiving passive immunity may develop active immunity, other animals may remain susceptible to a subsequent infection, becoming a source of virus for additional animals. This might explain partially the occasional occurrence of sequential rotavirus infections in the same animal.",

            "text": "Our findings showing a correlation between colostral antibody titers, amounts of colostrurn fed, and passive protection have important implications for passive immunity against enteric infections in both dairy and beef calves. Because 30-day milk antibody titers from i.m. plus IMm OARDC rotavirus vaccine immunized cows represented approximately 1% of VN or ELISA colostral antibody titers (which were protective at 1%), extrapolation of these results suggests this milk should be protective against natural rotavirus infections when fed undiluted to naturally or artificially suckled calves. In dairy herds, daily feeding of fresh or frozen colostrum supplements from immunized cows to calves should provide effective passive immunity for the duration of colostrum feeding (66) . This supplemental feeding for only 3 to 4 wk may be sufficient, as older animals generally possess a high age-specific resistance to symptomatic rotavirus infections (64) .",

Explanations for the equivocal results after challenge of nursing or immune cotostrum supplemented calves are uncertain. The influence of a number of variables needs to be considered, including experimental determination of the minimal protective dose of colostrum or milk necessary to provide homologous protection against symptomatic infections. Our studies indicate high titers were necessary for complete protection [VN antibody titers of >678 (.1% colostrum supplements of initial VN titer = 678,828) and <6788 (1% colostrum supplements of initial VN titer = 678,828)]. Second, additional studies are needed to determine the amount of heterologous crossprotection provided against challenge with different newly recognized serotypes of bovine rotavirus. The timing of colostrum feeding versus challenge, the challenge dose and virulence of the virus strain, and other concurrent infections all may play a role in susceptibility to infection, even under controlled experimental conditions (64, 66, 67, 68) .",
