            "text": "In the study of infectious disease, epidemiology plays two important roles. First, one can discuss an infection in terms of its epidemiology-the body of information related to agent characteristics, host susceptibility, transmission mechanisms, specific risk factors, reservoirs, and so forth that permits us to describe the biology of the agent-host-environment interaction. Understanding the epidemiology of an infectious disease is a prerequisite to being able to suggest the most appropriate methods for prevention and control of the disease. Second, the methods of epidemiology can be applied to infectious diseases to study their occurrence and distribution in populations and to plan intervention strategies. Epidemiology is the basis of outbreak investigation, in which the origins and generation of epidemics are studied. Having established a diagnosis and settled on a course of treatment for affected animals, the well-trained clinician turns to establishing an action plan for disease prevention. Disease surveillance provides an important element in our ability to monitor the distribution and spread of disease. Control activities are assessed epidemiologically to evaluate their effectiveness. Various strategies such as vaccination and test-and-removal programs can be studied quantitatively for efficacy and economic benefit in controlled trials. Therefore, it seems appropriate to introduce a consideration of infectious diseases of small animals by reviewing some epidemiologic concepts.",

Pathogenicity refers to the ability of an agent to produce disease and is measured by the proportion of infections that result in clinical signs. Virulence refers to the degree to which an agent produces severe illness or death. It is determined by calculating the case fatality rate-that is, the proportion of clinical cases that die. Considered in these terms, a virus such as canine parainfluenza shows high infectivity, moderate to low pathogenicity, and low virulence. At the other end of the spectrum, rabies virus has only moderate infectivity, but its pathogenicity and virulence approach 100 per cent.

Viremic carriers of FeLV shed virus in their saliva in high concentrations. 5 Viral shedding from viremic carriers is constant and may persist for years. Control of feline leukemia and FeLV-associated disorders depends in part on identification of chronic carriers and their segregation from the healthy population. 13 Screening tests for viral antigens (ELISA) have been developed to identifY viremic cats but should be followed by a more definitive procedure to identifY virus-infected cats (indirect fluorescent antibody).",

The predominant routes of exit of viruses from dogs and cats are the respiratory tract, alimentary tract (fecal and oral), urinary tract, and reproductive tract. Epigenetic transmission of FeLV from viremic queens to kittens by transplacental infection may result in abortion, fetal resorption with reproductive failure, or persistent congenital infection of kittens. 15 In utero transmission of FIPV appears to occur 18 and has been postulated to account for a syndrome in catteries of fetal death, fading kittens, and neonatal mortality. 24 In utero infection of kittens with FPV produces a spectrum of responses including fetal death, resorption and infertility, abortion, mummified fetuses, and congenital cerebellar hypoplasia. 16 Aerosols are another form of direct contact. Droplets projected from the pharynx and nasal cavity by sneezing, coughing, or barking contain virus and result in transmission to animals in close proximity. Canine distemper, canine parainfluenza, and canine adenovirus-2 infections are spread by aerosols. Theoretically, aerosol droplets greater than 5 microns in diameter (macrodroplets) settle out rapidly. Owing to their relatively large size, aerosols do not travel more than 1 meter. In the cat, sneezing produces large droplets that travel less than 1 meter owing to the configuration of the maxillary sinuses and turbinates. 25 This results in an effective sneezing distance of less than 4 feet. Susceptible cats housed with cats infected with FCV remain seronegative when kept at least 4 feet apart while fomite transmission is prevented. 25 Close contact is also required for infection with FVR from carrier cats to contacts housed together. 9 Control of feline viral respiratory disease is accomplished by vaccination, quarantine, preventing direct contact between cats by housing in individual cages with solid partitions, maintaining a distance of at least 4 feet between cats that face each other, and providing adequate ventilation (12 air charges per hour) and humidity control (below 50 per cent). 10 \u2022 21 Indirect transmission by fomites is prevented by regular cleaning and disinfection.",

Binn studied epizootics of canine viral respiratory diseases in military 1 and laboratory dogs. 2 The epidemiology of canine parvovirus infections was investigated in a large commercial kennel. 17 Multiple cat households have been used as the population to measure incidence offeline leukemia and FeLV-associated diseases. 3 Francis observed a household having 134 cats over a period of 5'l;; years. 6 Potkay determined the incidence of feline infectious peritonitis in a closed breeding colony over a 4-year period. 2\u00b0 Clinical trials of vaccines, antihelminthics, or other intervention strategies can be conducted in kennels, catteries, and colonies. Glickman conducted controlled field trials of vaccines for canine infectious tracheobronchitis 11 and parvovirus 12 in a closed commercial breeding kennel. Animal shelters and pet shops are also suitable populations for quantitative viral disease epidemiology. Dogs or cats that attend a large show might be considered a cohort. If the cohort is studied longitudinally to determine which animals develop an infectious disease after their common exposure, incidence rates can be calculated.",

The contact rate affects both the likelihood of an epidemic and its speed of propagation. When transmission requires direct exposure to secretions or excretions (FeLV), the contact rate will be relatively low. An infected carrier may contact two or three other animals. In contrast, in aerosolized infections such as canine distemper, the effective contact rate may be 5 or greater, depending on the housing density.",

The generation time is usually similar to the incubation period for the disease. However, generation time measures the interval between infection and maximal communicability, as opposed to onset of clinical signs. Figure 1 illustrates a propagated epidemic with an incubation period of 4 to 6 days. In the early stages of the epizootic, one can visualize the successive waves over several incubation periods. As the epidemic progresses, an increasing number of cases are seen in each time period, reflecting the likelihood of a susceptible animal contacting a case. The higher the contact rate, the steeper the ascending slope of the curve will appear. For diseases with very short incubation periods, the epidemic is compressed in time, adding to the slope of the curve. At the height of the epidemic, new contacts are likely to be with recovered or immune individuals, and the curve tails off as the susceptible population diminishes. Thus, a decrease in the effective contact rate decreases the extent and rapidity of the epidemic's propagation. An effective system of isolation can limit the spread of the epidemic while affording time to raise the level of immunity in the unexposed portion of the population. In most facilities, effective isolation of exposed individuals and segregation of affected ones are difficult to achieve in airborne infections, making them difficult to control.",

In an immune individual, exposure occurs but virus does not multiply effectively in the host, thus \"blocking\" transmission. The higher the proportion of immune individuals, the less likely transmission is to occur and the slower the epidemic's propagation. If 50 per cent of the individuals in a population are immune, the contact rate of 1 to 5 becomes, in effect, 1 to 2.5. When this proportion is raised further, transmission stops. During an epidemic, the proportion of immune individuals increases by subclinical infections and the development of cases. The epidemic stops when effective transmission no longer occurs because most of the contacts are with immunes. The transmission pattern becomes less than one to one. The rationale for vaccinating in the face of an outbreak lies in this fact and is often a critical element in stopping epidemic morbidity.",

Feline panleukopenia (FPL) presents an excellent example of the effects of herd immunity on seasonal cyclicity. 22 In the northeastern United States, epidemics of FPL occurred perennially during the late summer and early fall (Fig. 2) . During these seasonal epidemics, attack rates were highest in kittens but increased in older cats as well, illustrating involvement of all segments of the feline population. In northeastern United States, kittens are born during April and May. Maternal antibody is present in a high proportion but declines in 8 to 13 weeks, producing a large population of susceptible kittens in June and July. Figure 3 illustrates the cumulative incidence for the years 1964 to 1971 at the University of Pennsylvania. As kittens aged, increasing outdoor activity led to higher contact rates. By July, a highly susceptible population with high contact rates made epidemic transmission likely. Viral persistence in the environment added to the probability of transmission. With a build-up of immunes from natural infection and immunization, colder weather, and declining activity and contact rates, the epidemics waned in late fall. ",

Viruses shed in feces include CDV, infectious canine hepatitis virus (CAV-1), canine coronavirus (CCV), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), canine parvovirus (CPV), and feline parvovirus, the agent of feline panleukopenia (FPL). The canine and feline herpesviruses may be found in the female reproductive tract as well as in the pharynx and oronasal secretions. Rabies virus and FeLV are shed in saliva. CAV-1, CDV, and FPV are shed in urine as well as feces. Viral transmission in dogs and cats is generally horizontal, from animal to animal by direct contact or indirect mechanisms. Vertical transmission refers to passage of the infective agent from parent to offspring. True vertical transmission is chromosomal, with incorporation of viral genes into the nucleic acid component of all cells of the offspring. The viral genome is then perpetuated through the germ cells. Extrachromosomal or epigenetic vertical transmission occurs in several diseases of the dog and cat. This category includes transplacental fetal infection from an infected mother as well as neonatal infection with milk-borne virus. Transmission occurring at birth or shortly afterward by grooming, contact with vaginal secretions, or other forms of contact should be considered horizontal.",

Direct transmission results from contact between one animal (the source) and another (the contact). The social behavior of dogs and cats makes direct transmission a likely event. Bite wounds (rabies), licking and grooming (FeLV), and direct contact with feces (CPV, CDV, FPL), vomitus (CAV-1, CDV), urine (CAV-1, CDV), and vaginal secretions (FVR, CHV) are common modes of contact transmission. Sick animals with infectious secretions from oropharyngeal, nasal, conjunctival, or vaginal mucous membranes are excellent sources of viral transmission in canine distemper and infectious hepatitis.",
