Haldane (1949) , in his essay \"Disease and Evolution\" stated, \"I want to suggest that the struggle against disease, and particularly infectious disease, has been a very important evolutionary agent, and that some of its results have been rather unlike those of the struggle against natural forces, hunger, and predation or with members of the same species.\" There have been several subsequent studies of evolution along these lines (Allison, 1964; Ford, 1964) , one of which led to the discovery of a specific example of balanced polymorphism in human populations: the sickle cell gene and partial protection against falciparum malaria (Allison, 1964) . Person and Ebba (1975) have suggested that polymorphism is a characteristic manifestation of a reaction to parasites, and indeed Ford's (1964) studies of polymorphism in butterflies point to parasitoids as the selective force in maintaining a particular wing pattern, presumably through a secondary effect of the gene for resistance on the formation of spots on the underwing. So it is established that parasites are selective forces in nature. The selective effects of viruses have not yet been adequately studied. Continued attempts to find a correlation between different blood groups and differing severity of smallpox infection clearly searched for selective forces (Chakravartti et al., 1966) , but the results were inconclusive.",

Thus pathogenicity and resistance cannot be dealt with separately. He summarizes: \"The type of pustule developed on a host variety following inoculation with a race of rust is the criterion both of the reaction of that variety to the race and of the pathogenicity of that race to the variety.\" Clearly, then, a study of rust reaction involves the genetic systems of both host and parasite. Because of the close correspondence of the segregation ratios of the F2 generation of the rusts with the number of genetic loci for resistance in the host, Flor suggested that complementary gene systems in host and parasite control rust reactions. In certain rusts of apple trees, it is estimated that there may be as many as 19 such pairs. A gene-for-gene relationship has been demonstrated in host-parasite systems, which include rusts, smuts, mildews, and toxic insects, and has been suggested for bacteria and viruses (Day, 1974) .",

The amount of genetic information contained within them is limited. This means, in turn, if Flor's thesis of complementarity of host and parasite genes is valid, that there are limited numbers of genetic loci in the host which are available for resistance to viruses. Indeed, larger agents such as vaccinia would be complemented by larger series of genes which regulate resistance in the host, and smaller agents such as viroids would have fewer complementary genes. This does not of course bear on the question of the number of alleles at a given locus, but only on the number of different genetic loci on the chromosome complex.",

This prepared the way for more specific analysis of the biochemical differences between resistant and susceptible races, or between incompatible and compatible interactions. Finally, this has been formalized in terms of a \"quadratic check\" in which it is assumed that most of the extraneous biochemical reactions not related to the particular interaction of complementary genes have been excluded (Flor, 1956 (Flor, , 1971 ). Ellingboe (1972) says \"There are four possible parasite/host genotypes involving one locus in the parasite and one locus in the host (Fig. 1 ). Only one genotype P1/R1 gives an incompatible relationship between host and parasite (host resistant and pathogen avirulent) as originally identified by infection type. The other three parasite/host genotypes (P1/rl, pl/R1, and P I / + ) condition compatibility between host and parssite. The simplest hypothesis is that a specific host-parasite interaction yields an incompatible relationship. If specific interactions occur yielding compatible relationships, there may still be differences among the three genotype pairs which specify compatibility between host and parasite\" (Fig. 1) .",

For instance, a study of the spectrum of susceptibility of Drosophila and several other dipterans and some lepidopterans showed a wide range of susceptibility from strain to strain (Jousset and Jousset, 1976) . No genetic analyses were, however, carried out. Information on the differing susceptibility of strains of Drosophila melanogaster to the sigma (a) virus is, however, of direct relevance to the idea of quadratic checks. a is the name designated by the students of L'HBritier in France, who with Teissier (1937) discovered an agent which conferred on Drosophila the capacity to be killed by anesthiration with carbon dioxide. Normal Drosophila are put to sleep by exposure to carbon dioxide but awaken afterward. Flies infected with a do not. This property has been demonstrated to be infectious by inoculation into the appropriate strains of flies and may also be inherited by the progeny of infected females (more regularly) and males.",

However, the demonstration by Dickenson that the same gene for resistance to scrapie may be dominant in one genetic background and recessive in another (Dickinson and Miekle, 1971 ) puts a burden on such a simple explanation. A more important objection is inherent in the repressor-operon theory of gene action. Since a repressor gene suppresses the action of both alleles, this means that a genetic heterozygote may fail to produce the necessary substance even though only one allele carries the repressor (Hartman and Suskind, 1964) . Thus the current classification of dominance and recessiveness of genes for susceptibility and resistance tells us nothing about the mechanisms of interaction of host and parasite genes.",

It led to the brilliant demonstration by Sabin (1952a) of the Mendelian and unifactorial nature of a dominant gene in mice for resistance to arboviruses, particularly yellow fever. Following this, it was shown that resistance may be studied in specific cells in tissue culture in the case of mouse hepatitis (Bang and Warwick, 1960) , Rous virus (Vogt, 1969) , and West Nile encephalitis (Goodman and Koprowski, 1962) . More recently, dominance-recessiveness relationships in terms of virus interaction have been analyzed by somatic cell hybridization techniques. (This is not discussed here.) The greater ease of study of cell virus relationships in dispersed animal cell systems has meant that, at the cellular level, advances in animal virology have passed those of plant virology. Genetic analysis of the resistance of chicken cells to various strains of Rous virus has led to new concepts in tumor virology and opens up the possibility of using cell and virus variants to analyze in greater detail the steps in virus growth within cells (Vogt, 1977) . Finally, population analyses of the prevalence of certain virus markers, such as Au antigen in hepatitis and intracellular tumor virus antigens, have in recent years brought the subject back to considerations of evolution, an area investigated originally by Haldane (1949) . At the present stage of beginning knowledge, a critical review can proceed only by discussing each virus or group of viruses individually. In this process there are basic questions which can be asked concerning all the groups. They include:",

Since this may have introduced a strong bias, it is of interest to examine how these two species came to play such a large role. In this section we consider the origin and development of inbred mice, and in Part I1 (Section X) we will discuss the development of inbred chickens. Schwarz and Schwarz (1943) suggest that there were three major centers in the world where commensal mice developed from wild stocks. One was the borderland plateau of contemporary Turkistan and Iran, where wheat and barley were originally cultivated, The second was the wheatgrowing area of southern Persia, and the third was the intensively cultivated portion of ,Japan. Most of the commensal mice developed from Mus miiscultis wagnem' which came from Russian Turkistan. The laboratory mouse was apparently derived from a Japanese pet mouse, the \"fancy mouse,\" which was kept more for display than for research. \"It is difficult to ascertain how long varieties of the house mouse have been recognized in China. The word for white mouse is ancient, and that for spotted mouse appears in the earliest Chinesc lexicon, written in 1100 B.C. The waltzing variety has been known since 80 B.c.\" (Keeler, 1931) . The Japanese waltzer was apparently derived from a strain or subspecies in Tibet, In their fancy strains the Japanese favored albinism, nonagouti, waltzing, dominant and recessive spotting, lethal yellow, and other characteristics. These different fancy strains, without waltzing, spotting, or lethal yellow characters, may be considered the precursors of modern strains, having doubtless been subject to a degrec of inbreeding through the process of domestication. Several fancy varieties of the house mouse were taken from Japan to Europe and, by the turn of the century, \"muriculture\" had spread to America. Other present-day lines were derived from European mice-such as the \"Swiss\" mouse.",

From their work came studies on coat color (Little, 1913) . When Jensen (1908) showed that certain rat tumors could be transmitted by grafting from one rat to another, interest in the hereditary nature of cancer quickened, and a controversy as to the nature of this genetic factor arose. It was not possible to analyze these factors until it was clearly emphasized both by Little (1956) and Strong (1976) in the 1920s that only with relatively pure strains of mice, produced by continuous inbreeding, would it be possible to determine the relative roles of heredity and environment. This led to the establishment of a series of strains of mice at the Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Maine, and elsewhere, and it is through the use of such strains that knowledge of genetic resistance and susceptibility has been furthered. Actually relatively little fruitful work was carried out by selecting mice on the basis of their resistance or susceptibility to infectious agents from outbred stocks (see Section 111). Thus the goal of inbreeding aimed at the study of cancer led to the definition of viral and host genome in the production of leukemia in some strains of mice, and to determination of the origin of mammary cancer, i.e., transmission of the agent by milk in some cases (Bittner, 1940; Andervont, 1940) and by genes in others (Heston et al., 1976) .",

In addition, various F1 generations of mice from crosses between regular laboratory mice and waltzing mice did develop the disease. Finally, since the F2 generation often had the disease but was not uniformly killed by it, he was led t o emphasize the hereditary aspects of susceptibility. In a later, almost direct follow-up of this study, Gowen and Schott (1933) observed susceptibility to B. piliformis in the F1 generation and in various backcrosses of waltzing mice with various Chinese lines and black-eyed whites which were not susceptible. They concluded that susceptibility to the disease may be dependent upon a single major factor difference, with modifying factors playing a small part in expression of the disease. Dominance of the resistant allelomorph appeared to be complete in one cross, but incomplete in another. They further showed that the factor was not linked to the character for waltzing or coat color. This work is of interest to virologists, because it is concerned with a spontaneous disease caused by an intracellular bacterial parasite and supports the idea of the unifactorial nature of genetic resistance in some situations.",

He concentrated first on bacterial diseases such as paratyphoid of mice and, impressed by the increasing knowledge of the genetics of mice, sought to obtain paratyphoid-resistant and -susceptible mice by selective breeding, He succeeded in establishing several lines and found that some were either resistant or susceptible to louping ill virus (a disease of sheep whose viral etiology was early established). Resistance was not absolute in any line, but sharp differences in the percentage of mice that became ill following a standard intranasal inoculation were maintained (Webster, 1924) . The availability of St. Louis encephalitis virus (later known to be within the same group) following the epidemic of 1933 in St. Louis meant that another important series of studies could be undertaken (Webster and Clow, 1936; Webster and Johnson, 1941) . Despite the absence of a complete difference in ausceptibility (the susceptible strain had a 95% mortality and the resistant strain a 15% mortality) Webster and Clow (1936) were able to make the first analyses of the genetic nature of the difference. In mice strains that had been inbred by brother-sister mating for 12 generations, the amount of virus was about 100 to 100,000 times greater in the brains of the susceptible mice than in those of the resistant mice, even though it appeared to enter by way of the olfactory lobe of both strains following intranasal inoculation. The virus was successfully transferred by intracerebral inoculation to the resistant mice but did not seem to acquire any new host range characteristics after several successive passages.",

They showed that, when minced brain of mouse embryos was grown in Tyrode's solution with 10% serum (see Section III,A), the virus attained a titer of 1/10,000 in cultures made from susceptible mice but reached only 1/160 in cultures from genetically resistant mice.

Chance and personal interest both had important roles in the selection of the models that were studied. It is fair to predict that the power of genetic tools in understanding pathogenesis and molecular sequences in virus growth in many other families of viruses will grow as new chance discoveries are made. Table I summarizes the main points in the study of genetic resistance to the flavovirus group B. All the agents, louping ill, St. Louis encephalitis, Russian spring-summer encephalitis, yellow fever, and West Nile virus belong to the same group and thus may be subject to the same host mechanisms of resistance and susceptibility. However, none of the points listed in the table have been demonstrated for each of the different viruses, and future work should include both a search for other mechanisms of resistance and a study of ways in which genetic resistance may French neurotropic yellow fever virus multiplies and kills some resistant P R I Mouse-adapted Japanese B encephalitis kills resistant P R I be phenotypically modified. Sabin (1954) did a preliminary study on the mode of inheritance of partial resistance of PRI mice to French neurotropic yellow fever virus. The evidence that a unifactorial dominant gene operates to produce resistant strains of mice is very good, Resistance was demonstrated both in the mice derived from Webster's original selected virus-resistant mice and in the PRI mice. This resistance was inherited in an astonishingly regular and predictable way in Sabin's test for susceptibility to the famous 17D yellow fever vaccine virus. In subsequent studies by Goodman and Koprowski (1962) , the resistant gene from the P R I mice was introduced into susceptible C3H mice by making crosses between the two and then crossing these F1 mice with the susceptible C3H mice and testing for susceptibility to yellow fever virus. The survivors of this challenge (presumed to be genetically resistant), were kept and crossed again with the susceptible C3H. By continuing this for eight generations, a congenic strain was obtained (Groschel and Koprowski, 1965) which, according to arithmetical estimates should have been 99.6% similar to the susceptible C3H strain but which contained the gene for resistance. Repeated tests showed that 50% of the offspring of backcrosses resulting from the mating of the hetero~ygotes with the susceptible mice were resistant. The resistant backcrosses were inbred, susceptible offspring were discarded, and this procedure was repeated until a coisogenic group of mice was obtained. A comparison of the susceptibility of macrophage cultures from these mice showed that virus grew in cultures from the susceptible mice but not in those from the resistant line. This evidence of unifactorial resistance was confirmed by Vainio and Koprowski (1962) . Genetic resistance to St. Louis virus was not conferred on susceptibles by foster nursing (Wright, 1940) .",

This is demonstrated both in young adult mice and in cultures of macrophages from either livers or peritoneal washings. The F1 generation is fully susceptible, in that virus preparations titer just as far on these cells as on homozygous susceptible cells, and destruction is just as rapid. About 25% of the F2 generation is resistant and, when continued backcrosses of the susceptiblc F1 generation are made with the resistant (C3H) strain, 50% of the offspring show susceptibility (Kantoch et al., 1964) . After 20 such backcrosses, a coisogenic strain of mice was bred , and this strain presumably differed from the resistant strain by only one gene. The genetics of resistance of mice to MHV-3 (in contrast to MHV-2) is not as yet clearly defined. There is a striking genetic difference in the susceptibility of different strains, but there is also an intermediate degree of susceptibility, perhaps reflecting incomplete penetration (Virelizier, 1975) .",

In order to demonstrate the susceptibility of cultures from newborn resistant mice, it was necessary to grow liver cultures as explants on reconstituted collagen, so that macrophages would migrate from the explant. When precautions were taken to have a significant number of macrophages in the cultures, it was possible to show that the gradual acquisition of resistance of the C3H occurred both in the mice themselves and in the cultures. Thus macrophages grown from liver cultures of very young mice were susceptible, but macrophages grown from livers of weaned mice were resistant (Gallily et al., 1967) . However, this maturation of the resistance did not occur in the tissue cultures when they were maintained over a period of several weeks. The ontogeny of resistance, which has been described for MHV-2 and which occurs by 4 weeks of age, probably does not represent maturation of the only genetic effect. In the studies of Le Prevost et al. (1975) , several of their partially resistant strains did not develop resistance until 12 weeks of age. They were still susceptible at 6 weeks of age. A somewhat similar development of increased resistance of the susceptible congenic strain of C3H mice has been observed a t 2 months.",

A remarkable finding was that cells obtained by peritoneal washing, although containing both T cells and macrophages, did not protect newborn mice.

Nature of Genetic Resistance Lindenmann (196263) noticed that an inbred strain of mice, A2G, maintained at. the Glaxo Laboratories for testing pertussis vaccines, was very resistant to influenza virus. Following intracerebral inoculation, these mice were resistant to 100,OOO times as much virus as that which killed standard strains of mice, including C3H. This strain was also resistant to the neurotropic virus adapted to Ehrlich ascites tumor cells (Lindenmann, 1963) , even though the virus destroyed most of the implanted tumor. A careful Mendelian analysis of resistance to this virus strain was then made. Analysis of the F1 and F2 generations, and of the results of backcrosses with both the resistant and the susceptible strains, gave results which agreed closely with the hypothesis of one autosomal dominant resistance gene. This has been called Mx and is manifest against all three types of virus: pneumotropic, neurotropic, and hepatotropic. The gene for resistance was searched for in a large number of strains and not found. It is inferred that it was introduced by a stray British mouse (Lindenmann and Klein, 1966) .

They discovered that the C57 BL strain of mice was a good interferon producer and that the Haller et al. (1976) 0. Haller and J. Lindenmann (personal communication, 1977) Lindenmann et at. (1963) BALB/strain was a poor producer of interferon. The amount of interferon produced was measured on L cells as activity against vesicular stomatitis virus. Determination in individual mice showed that the two strains could be separated into two classes with no overlap between them. The amount of interferon produced in the F1 generations of the two reciprocal crosses was determined, and the average value in both cases found to be intermediate between that of the parents. Greater variation over a wider range was found in the F2 generation. Backcrosses with the high interferon producer (C57BL) tended toward the high producer, while backcrosses with the low producer were more like the low producer. These workers conclude that a \"single, partly dominant, autosomal factor is responsible for the difference in circulating interferon production between both strains.'' It seems to us that the effect of several Mendelian genes has been by no means ruled out, since the range of variation within each class was so great and since the different presumed segregants did not clearly separate into discrete classes. Tucker and Stewart (1976) have taken advantage of the higher susceptibility of inbred C57BI and C57BR, as compared to outbred Swiss mice, when inoculated with Sendai (parainfluenza 1) virus to study pathogenesis of the intrauterine spread of this virus. The virus produced a persistent (21-day) infection and was isolated from 20430% of the newborns from intravenously infected mothers. The genetic aspects of the infection were not determined in hybrids or backcrosses.",

Continued adult mouse passage (intramuscular route) overcame the resistance of adult P mice. In crosses between P mice (which had a large difference between adult resistance and infant susceptibility) intermediate results were obtained in the F1 generation.

Maternal transmission in sheep and the concomitant presence of several strains of the virus in one animal have made genetic studies difEcult.

The unusual findings which have emerged match the peculiarity of the agent itself. Since scrapie is a classic example of a slow virus, and since the incubation period may exceed an animal's life span, determination of which animals are truly resistant is sometimes difficult. For example, there were striking differences in the incubation periods in individual animals within groups of sheep following both subcutaneous and intracerebral inoculation (Dickinson and Miekle, 1971) . These seemed to fall into short (197 f 7 days) and long (917 2 90 days) classes. Evidence for a single dominant gene for susceptibility was obtained by studying the progeny of sheep with known short incubation periods which were mated with sheep lacking the expressed factor for short incubation. Stocks of sheep selected for susceptibility and resistance now have a difference of 90% incidence following subcutaneous inoculation. Among the animals apparently homozygous for the recessive resistant allele, there were some which developed scrapie after a very long interval; this has left the problem of the genetics of long-incubation scrapie in sheep unsettled.",

Results almost opposite those above were obtained when another strain of scrapie, 22A, which had been passed in the \"long-incubation\" mice before it was used, was employed in a genetic test of the effect of the short-incubation (\"sinc\") gene. I n this new system the \"short-incubation\" mice (C57BL) had a longer incubation period, and the long-incubation mice (VM) had a short incubation period. Furthermore, the F1 hybrid showed the phenomenon of overdominance; that is, the incubation period of these F1 mice was longer than in either of their parents. Segregation ratios in the F2 and F3 generations followed the expected pattern for one gene. These workers argue that the sinc gene is responsible for these reversed effects. Three reasons are given. First, detailed comparison of the expected and observed ratios of short to long incubation periods in different crosses following a test of the F2 generation with the first agent (ME7) and a test of the F3 generation with the second agent (22A) showed close agreement with the hypothesis that one gene or closely linked genes were responsible. In other words, there was no segregation of the two agents into two factors between the F2 and F3 generations. Second, the response of several other strains of mice to one agent can be predicted on the basis of the response of the other.

A cross between the elevated (BALB/c) and the exaggerated (SLJ/J) yielded an F1 generation which was at the lower range of the elevated level (2650-6300 units). The F2 generation yielded a 3: 1 elevated/exaggerated segregation ratio, and a backcross with the exaggerated yielded a 1: 1 ratio. It is suggested that the SJL/J mice have a recessive trait for extreme susceptibility. No studies of cell cultures have been reported, but in light of the known high genetic susceptibility of macrophages to mouse hepatitis, and now influenza, and the recent report on the differential genetic susceptibility of cells to cytomegalic virus (Diosi et al. 1974) along with the established capacity of LDV to grow in macrophages, such studies should be useful.",

Since the difference between the resistant C3H mice and the susceptible SWR mice was 1.9 logs for male mice and 1.4 logs for female mice, and since the virus used was passed in SW mice, it is difficult to know the biological significance of such resistance and susceptibility when the differences obtained are just above statistical significance. The two F1 generations from these crosses were closer to the susceptible strain than to the resistant strain in the percentage of mortality when the k (immune response) gene was present in a double dose. Finally, there are illustrations which show extensive inflammatory response in the leptomeninges of the susceptible strain with the q gene and no inflammatory response in the strain with the k gene.

This contrasts with reports on previously isolated strains of this virus, which grow readily in Swiss mice. They found that cells from newborn mice, particularly kidney cells, maintained resistance in tissue culture if derived from resistant Swiss mice, and were susceptible (developed typical intranuclear inclusions) if derived from the wild mice strain presumably established in the laboratory. A cross of the two (W X S) yielded 5/5 F1 susceptible and 3/4 positive cultures. The F2 generation showed 3/4 and 2/3, respectively, while two backcrosses with resistant mice showed about 1/3 of the mice susceptible. Presumably, one gene dominant for susceptibility is involved.

Resistance to the agent was thought to be inherited as a single autosomal factor, but the F1 cross obtained from inbred resistant and susceptible mice was intermediate in susceptibility. Further analysis was carried out by establishing congenic lines for both the resistance factor and the BUSceptibility factor. The resistance factor, along with the chromosome segment containing it, was introduced into the susceptible strain by eight repeated backcrosses and, contrariwise, the susceptible factor was introduced into the resistant strain by the opposite backcrosses. This work showed that at least two genetic factors were involved in resistance to Friend leukemia. then showed that several different viruses were involved with different tropisms, and that the tropism was characteristic of the virus.

However, the test was made after only a 1000-fold increase in virus, which would be unlikely to detect mutants at a low prevalence. In this connection, it has been shown by Ware and Axelrad (1972) that tissue culture cells from mouse embryos maintain their state of resistance or susceptibility for at least 25 transfers. The recently described cultivation of cell lines susceptible to both N and B viruses from a feral mouse embryo may suggest the presence of a third allele for susceptibility to both viruses at the same locus or the absence of the gene . The presentation of these quadratic analyses emphasizes that the eventual goal of understanding is to determine the nature of the fit (compatability) or lack of fit (incompatibility) between the variety of virus mutants (Vogt, 1977) and the biochemical restrictions imposed by the genetics of the cells. In the case of these two strains, N + B tropic and NB tropic, this is currently under study by Faller and Hopkins (1977) who showed a basic similarity in that they shared 30 T1 RNase oligonucleotides and yet the N-tropic virus of BALB/c mice had 8 unique oligonucleotides and the B-tropic virus 6 unique ones. The same group of workers pinpointed other differences between the B and NB agents (Faller and Hopkins, 1977) .",

Resistance to leukemia viruses was first recognized by Odaka and Yamamato (1962) as a Mendelian resistance factor for the Friend virus operative in adult mice and was first studied by standard Mendelian techniques by both the Canadian group (Axelrad and van der Gaag, 1968 ) and the Japanese group (Odaka, 1969) . The virus was titered in adult mice by focus formation in the spleen. Subsequently, congenic strains of mice were developed by transferring the genes for susceptibility and resistance. The subsequent determination that there were two genes, one for tissue susceptibility (FV-1) and the other for reaction to the developing tumor (FV-I) has been carefully documented by Lilly and Pincus (1973) . The congenic strains of mice differing in susceptibility to mouse leukemia, which were developed by Axelrad and van der Gaag (1968) , have been used by the Canadian group in several further ways. First, they showed that the gene for resistance in these mice was indeed the same one studied by Rowe et al. (1972) and that FV-1\"\" and FV-lbb were thereby represented. Second, they showed that resistant and susceptible cells may be derived from the appropriate mice and that such cell lines maintained their resistance and susceptibility for 25 tissue culture passages (Ware and Axelrad, 1972) . Then they showed that the reciprocally related resistant and susceptible cells from these congenic mice both showed curves of the one-hit type; i.e.; they differed from each other by about 2 log dilutions but the curves were parallel (Schuh et al., 1976) . Finally, they used the cell lines to analyze the nature of the resistance factor by infecting the two cell lines with defective virus (murine sarcoma virus) which can be helped by either B-tropic or N-tropic mousc leukemia virus. Under these conditions, the PV-1 -mediated restriction acted solely by restricting the mouse leukemia virus, thereby inhibiting focus formation by the defective murine sarcoma virus in nonpermissive cells (Kochman et al., 1977) .",

They suggest that two genes exist within the complex, these being responsible for resistance to leukemogenesis. The complexity of the H-2 locus, along with the inclusion of the IT gene responsible for specific immune responses, makes this area of study a most active one. Chesebro et al. (1974) have studied the relationship of this locus to resistance in a new way. They followed the development of enlarged spleens in living mice by simple palpation following virus inoculation.

This meant of course that the tissue extract failed to equal the natural genetic restriction, which is from 99.0 to 99.9%, but introduced a new parameter in the methods of working with this particular type of cell resistance. Considerable care was taken to differentiate the reduction in susceptibility, which is specific for the susceptible cells, by demonstrating a correlation between the source of the extract and the genotype of a particular genetic cross. Axelrad and Steeves (1964) showed that inoculation of varying dilutions of the highly efficient virus-cell combinations produced a one-hit curve; i.e., there was a direct relationship between the number of lesions produced and the concentration of the virus.

This is because resistance is dominant, However, in a murine leukemia virus isolated from irradiated mice, they showed that a one-hit curve was produced on one type of hybrid, but a two-hit curve on another type of hybrid, both of which were FV-lnb but were otherwise different. The mouse cross which yielded the one-hit titration curve with this virus and one other B-tropic virus was NIH Swiss X C57B, whereas the cross yielding a two-hit curve was N I H Swiss X BALB/c. Both curves were intermediate in level of sensitivity between those of the resistant and susceptible parents. This has led these workers to propose that another gene, SVR, must be present in BALB/c mice together with nb heterozygosity a t the FV-1 locus in order for the conversion from two-hit t o one-hit kinetics to occur. To test this a variety of crosses was made, and the individual mice so derived were tested to see what kind of titration curves would be forthcoming. A ratio of mice yielding a one-hit curve t o those yielding a two-hit curve was then determined and compared with the predicted results. There was good agreement between the two, and these investigators therefore feel that they have established another modifying gene in these mice. The gene, however, has no apparent effect on N-tropic viruses.",

(1973) that the cells could absorb and take in pseudotypes of vesicular stomatitis virus (i.e., with N and B coats on their surface), as demonstrated by the subsequent growth of these compatible viruses in cells which were resistant and susceptible to Nand B-tropic leukemia viruses. They concluded that resistance was manifest after attachment and penetration. Krontiris et a2. (1973) simultaneously and independently reported the same results, and in addition demonstrated that virus was absorbed with equal efficiency to the resistant and to the susceptible cells. These data, together with the work of Yoshikura (1973) , who used murine sarcoma virus as a pseudotype of leukemia strains, indicate that resistance to infection by the FV-I gene takes place after primary absorption. However, Bassin et al. (1975) have questioned the value of Yoshikura's model. At the other end of the sequence RNA-DNA-RNA, the output of infectious virus was measured by following the amount of reverse transcriptase produced in tissue culture. Jolicoeur and Baltimore (1976b) showed that virus production in the fluid was reduced 70 to 100-fold in resistant cells, and that virus-specific RNA was equally reduced in the cytoplasm and nuclei. The stage was then set for two groups to determine more exactly where the incompatibility occurs (Sveda and Soeiro, 1976 ; Jolicoeur and Baltimore, 1976a) . In these experiments, the use of a virusspecific DNA probe and a new procedure for the extraction of unintegrated double-stranded forms of proviral DNA were important. Compatible and incompatible pairs of viruses and cells both yielded the same amounts of unintegrated proviral DNA after infection, but only in the compatible cell systems was this new DNA integrated into the host cell. Jolicoeur and Baltimore (1976a) conclude their discussion as to where the FV-1 gene acts with the following:",

Furthermore, the Fv-1 sensitive structure can be phenotypically mixed in the yield of MuLV from cells con-infected with N-tropic and B-tropic virus. Such a structure would probably be a protein. The only known virus-coded protein that functions early in the MuLV growth cycles is the reverse transcriptase and, because so much of the coding capacity of the genome has been assigned t o known functions, there may not be new viral proteins to discover. To reconcile these facts with our observation that the bulk synthesis of reverse-transcribed DNA occurs normally in Fv-1 resistant cells, we must postulate a function for reverse transcriptaae beyond the manufacture of DNA.

It is separate from the histocompatibility locus (Chesebro et al., 1974) . It was originally recognized in a general study of the resistance of mice to Friend leukemia by Odaka and Yamamota (1962) . Axelrad and van der Gaag (1968) later studied the same groups of resistant and susceptible mice, but also developed congenic mice in which the selection procedures (on the basis of performance of progeny) were somewhat different. I n their work it soon became clear that two genes were operative. The gene subsequently demonstrated to be effective in tissue culture by Rowe et al. (1973) is FV-I, whereas the gene which represents the originally described resistance of the mice themselves to Friend virus has been called FV-6. There is much less knowledge of how the latter gene functions. In contrast to FV-1, resistance of the mice is almost absolute, but the situation is similar to that in the mouse hepatitis system in which adult mice from the resistant strain are also completely resistant (in terms of death), but tissue cultures of these mice allow for a change in the virus, and thus the tissues appear to be only relatively resistant. The mechanism of the resistance produced by FV-I in preventing the development of mouse leukemia has been intensively studied by a group at Boston University (Kumar et al., 1974;  Kumar and Bennet, 1976) . They investigated resistance and susceptibility to Friend virus in several different strains of mice and in resistant mice of differing ages. Because there was an apparent association of the capacity of mice to reject bone marrow grafts and to be resistant to the Friend strain of mouse leukemia virus, they were led to see if ST+, a bone-seeking element, would abrogate the resistance of the genetically resistant mice to the virus as well as to bone marrow transplants. This was found to be so, and since 88Sr apparently does not affect T or B cells, the putative cell responsible for resistance was called the M cell. The marrow cells of the resistant strain of mice are not in themselves completely resistant, since bone marrow transplantation from resistant mice into susceptible, irradiated mice which have been given virus do develop leukemia.",

Rapidly thereafter a group working with Huebner at NIH, (Taylor et al., 1971) , Meier et al. (1973) at the Jackson Laboratory at Bar Harbor, and a group with Old and Boyse at the Sloan-Kettering Institute (Hilgers et al., 1972) took up the problem in mice. An antigen apparently similar to that of chicken leukemia was detected in mice by using sera either prepared against the gs tumor antigen itself and highly absorbed, or by using sera from (1) rats which had been inoculated with mouse leukemia or (2) rats inoculated with tumors induced by any of the mouse leukemias or sarcomas or (3) rats that had developed rat leukemia. These sera have a sufficient degree of specificity so that, if they are used carefully a t critical dilutions, they differentiate clearly between the presence or absence of the antigen, mostly by means of complement fixation tests. Major emphasis has since been placed by the Sloan-Kettering group on the G antigen which is one of the gs antigens. This antigen, now called GCSA, is carefully defined by the injection of cells of a specific Gross virus-induced tumor into C57BL/6 mice.",

When the F2 generations were carried further by inbreeding from different pairs of F2 mice, and the presence of gs antigen in the different lines thereby derived was determined, the 16 lines fell sharply into several classesthose that had continuous 100% positive results for gs antigens, those that had 50-7576 positive results and, finally, those that carried no positive antigen.

This chance finding arose during a study of the congenic lines B10 and 58N which were thought to differ also in the presence or absence of gs antigen. Genetic analysis of the difference in gs antigen titers between \u20ac310 and 58N led them to conclude that 58N contained a single contaminant gene from one of the parent strains which controlled gs-antigen expression. This difference between the two lines (B10 and 58N) was then analyzed by thc appropriate F1, F2 and backcrosses, and from these it was determined that the gene was completely recessive. Furthermore, the presence of the antigen (again tested with appropriate rat, antisera) was unaccompanied by liberation of the infectious virus. These workers argued from this set of data that the locus was regulatory, or repressor (the presence of the gene suppresses the appearance of the antigen), and gave it the label MLV-I. Hilgers et al. (1972) made similar analyses of the inheritance of gs antigen in various stocks of mice having a high and low incidence of leukemia. They found that the mice could be classified into three groups: one with high titer (1/4 to 1/8), one with intermediate titer (1/1 to 1/2) , and one negative. Using these titers as phenotypic characters they analyzed a series of crosses and F1 and F2 and suggested that the results could be explained by a single gene locus, which may well be regulatory, but they did not indicate whether expression of the antigen was dominant or recessive.",

One of these, the GIX, has been identified as being related in some way to mouse leukemia virus. It was originally thought to be part of linkage group I X which contains the H-2 locus. Interest in these antigens and their relationship to leukemia arose in an indirect way, through the interest of Boyse, Old, and their associates in the expression of various surface antigens on thymocytes. For a detailed review of this work, their reviews and articles should be consulted, but since there is clearly a relationship to leukemia viruses, we summarize them here. The TL antigen, which is peculiar to the process of differentiation of the thymus, was identified after thymocytes of one strain of mice were injected into another strain. Mice can apparently form TL antibody to any TL antigen that they do not themselves express on their own thymocytes. The same antigen has been found in several leukemia cells, including some that were clearly virus-induced, but the relationship of this \"normal thymus\" antigen to the leukemia agents of mice is an open question.",

The antibody, which also occurs in direct response to infection with mouse leukemia agents, is used in a cytotoxic test for both rat and mouse leukemia cells; it is also active against thymocytes of certain nonleukemic mice. The relevince of this overlap is now much clearer, since it has been demonstrated that GIX is one of the antigens of the mouse leukemia virus gp 69/71 (Obata et al., 1975; Tung et al., 1975) . The genetics of the inheritance of thymocyte antigen (GIX) has been studied in different strains of mice. The usual Mendelian analysis by Boyse et al. (1972) led to the proposal that two unlinked genes are required for the expression of GIX on normal thmocytes: one dominant, the other semidominant. They now call these genes GV-1 and GV-I. The expression of the GIX antigen can be equated with the presence of a specific murine leukemia antigen. Indeed, infection of mouse fibroblasts with a large variety of murine leukemia viruses, both ecotropic and xenotropic, induces antigen which absorbs antibody directed against GIX .",

The linkage of separate characters is the basis for association in a particular linkgroup, and therefore it is assumed that the two genes are on one chromosome. However, several linkage-like segregations in European and Asiatic races of mice have been obtained, which suggested to Michie (1955 Michie ( -1956 ) that a mechanism other than association on a particular chromosome is necessary for an adequate explanation. This mechanism, in Michie's opinion, might be due to an attraction of centromeres of like origin to the same pole of the mitotic spindle, thereby bringing about an association of different chromosomes during the meiotic process. Whatever the mechanism, i t seems to be an established phenomenon and becomes of direct interest in studying the genetics of the association of different leukemia antigens. Stockert at al. (1976) point out that their previous data had shown an association of the phenotype GIX and H -2 on the one hand, and of G I X and Gpd-1 (glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) on the other. However, since the histocompatibility antigen, H-2 and Gpd-1 are on different chromosomes, the apparent association cannot be totally through location on the same chromosome. For this reason the original association of the three genes was reinvestigated in heterozygous mice with a similar genetic background. It was shown that GV-1 and GV-2 consistently deviated from the expected random recombination ratio of 0.50 (i.e., the ratio was 0.35) , and GV-1 and Gpd-1 also differed (ratio equaled 0.32).",

The virus appears early in the life of AKR mice, can be repeatedly cultured from tail tissue snips, and thus may be followed in individual mice. I n contrast, the virus is much less common in low-leukemia strains having a low incidence of disease and is absent in early life. Thus this phenotypic character can be analyzed by formal genetic procedures, ie., the presence of virus in early life. The characteristics of the mouse may be defined by the presence or absence of virus at 2 weeks and a t 6-10 weeks. Rowe (1972) first studied crosses between AKR mice and a series of low-leukemia-strain mice, all of which were, however, limited to those which carried the gene for susceptibility to N-tropic viruses (FV-1\") . This provision was necessary, since (as was shown by most of the spontaneously occurring virus in AKR mice is N tropic, and therefore the presence of genetic resistance to propagation of the virus would in itself affect the spontaneous presence of the virus and should be eliminated.",

The ratio of the number of mice with virus to those lacking virus in the F2 generation was 15: 1, and in the backcrosses it was 13: 1, making it extremely unlikely that the genes for occurrence of virus are at one locus and strongly suggesting that two autosomal loci are involved. One of the loci, V1, was shown to be associated with linkage group I by the observation that in many of the backcrosses there was an association of coat color (white) with the presence of the virus a t 2 weeks of age. This linkage was further tested by searching for an associatioh with the gene which determines hemoglobin type. Virus occurred approximately one and one-Half times more frequently in mice which had acquired their gene for hemoglobin or coat color from AKR mice. Rowe (1972) points out that, in cases where two independently segregating genes give rise to the same phenotype, the closest possible linkage with a given marker would give only a 2:l ratio. Further evidence for linkage of the one gene was obtained by studying the offspring of different families in which only one gene for the presence of the virus remained after backcrosses and segregation. This locus, referred to as VZ (now referred to as ARC-I), was 25 to 30 map units from c (albino coat color), and the order appeared to be V1-c-Hbb.",

            "text": "An excellent demonstration of the role of resistance to spread of the virus is presented in the paper by . It is remembered from Section VII1,A that mouse strains tested in embryo tissue culture may be shown to carry a gene for resistance to propagation of the leukemia virus, and dependent upon whether the virus is of the Nor Btropic type, have either the allele FV-1\" or FV-lb. Since most of the AKR mice carry the Ntropic virus, it was possible to analyze the effect of FV-lb (which produces resistance to propagation of the Ntropic viruses) on the spontaneous appearance of leukemia virus by making crosses of AKR mice with low leukemia strains which carry the gene FV-lb instead of FV-l\", as was done in the previous analysis. Some of the results of these crosses, as reproduced from their paper, are presented in Fig. 8 . The marked reduction in the number of mice of the F1 generation that had virus present at two weeks of age and the ocurrence of mice that did not show any virus at six to ten weeks was apparently a reflection of this resistance to propagation (Fig. 8 ) . Furthermore, in the backcrosses there were very few mice that had significant amounts of virus a t two or six weeks, in direct contrast with the backcrosses between AKR and low leukemia strain mice with the permissive gene FV-I\", That the FV-1 gene is acting by suppression of the ability of the virus to propagate in susceptible tissues, and not acting on the actual spontaneous occurrence of the virus, was nicely demonstrated by induction of virus by means of 5-iododeoxyuridine in tissue cultures of the appropriate generations and crosses. The presence of virus in the induced cells was tested by co-cultivation with susceptible cells immediately after induction and then determining the presence of virus. Thus it was shown that the presence of FV-1 had no influence on the evolution of the virus, but, as shown above, prevented the spread within the animal. The apparent Mendelian inheritance of the gs antigen for chicken leukemia, in some cases of the mammary tumor agent, and of several different manifestations of mouse leukemia has now been demonstrated. The nature of the integration of the virus with the host genetic material has, however, not been clarified. The main purpose of Rowe and Hartley's investigation was to determine whether the virus released from the hybrids had the characteristics of the various hybrid hosts from which it was actually released, or whether it was like that of the dominant parent, the AKR mouse. Since viruses that cause leukemia in mice may be divided into two main classes, N tropic and B tropic, and since a cross between AKR mice (which carry N-tropic viruses) and various FV-lb low-leukemia mice (which carry B-tropic agents) had been made, it was then important to determine the host range of the virus which appeared in this set of hybrids. The host range of this virus was almost always that of the AKR mice, which was interpreted by Rowe and Hartley as strong evidence that the virus-inducing genetic loci of the AKR mice contained the mouse leukemia virus genetic loci and not that the agent was derived directly from the host.",

In order to follow the reasoning involved in this procedure, which for the first time combines the contradictory evidence of Mendelian inheritance of the agent with the knowledge that it is an infectious agent, a few preliminary statements are necessary. As Gross originally showed, infection of an AKR mouse at birth leads to the development of leukemia in the growing animal. However, the virus does not show the integrated into the genome, since Mendelian analysis does not show the agent to be appropriately distributed in the F2 and backcross generations. On the other hand, the spontaneously infected AKR line, as indicated above, yields Mendelian ratios. Jaenisch exposed mouse embryos at the four-to eight-cell stage, after digestion of the eona pellucida with pronase, to Maloney leukemia virus. These early embryos were transplanted to foster mothers, and the offspring were studied for leukemia virus, for disease, and for further transmission.",

Of these, one male and two females developed the virus and later the disease, The male, no. 339, then transmitted the disease to 4/25 of his offspring early in his mating career, but this capacity was gradually lost so that, at 12 months of age, 0/28 of his immediate offspring contained the agent. This instability of inheritance of the virus is reminiscent of the paternal inheritance of the carbon dioxide sensitivity factor in Drosophila (L'HBritier, 1958) . However, following mating with unaffected females, a regular inheritance of 50% disease was obtained from offspring which were positive, i.e., from mice that were originally infected by male no. 339, thus establishing the apparent Mendelian nature of the inheritance. Molecular hybridization experiments showed that these males carried one copy of the murine leukemia virus gene per diploid mouse genome, thus supporting the idea that viremic backcross animals are heterozygous for a single Mendelian locus carrying this gene. Finally (Jaenisch, 1977) , these heterozygotes were mated and the expected three types of offspring obtained. These were ++, + -, and --, and as far as the presence of Maloney murine leukemia virus-specific DNA sequences in their liver nuclei was concerned, all three developed normally.",

Finally, by comparing the incidence of spontaneous appearance of the virus in tissue cultures of embryos of the different strains and backcrosses, and of virus in cultures of spleens of adult mice, a close correlation between spontaneous induction and inducibility by 5-iododeoxyuridine was demonstrated, suggesting that the same gene was involved.

(1972) indicate that AKR mice possess two independently segregating chromosome loci, either of which leads to appearance of the virus early in life. They showed that one locus was on linkage group I-about 3 and 12 map units from the loci for albino (c) and for the B chain of hemoglobin ( H b b ) genes, respectively. The other locus ( V g ) was not mapped. This differentiation into two loci was made possible by the use of backcross mice in which it was shown that, when the character for high inducibility was present in 50% of a particular cross, some of the mice had the character associated with the genes on linkage group I and others did not. Since the presence of the character in 50% of the offspring of the backcross suggested that it was due to one gene, and yet was sometimes associated but other times not associated, the results meant that two dominant genes both functioning in the same manner had been separated. The V1 locus was further mapped by three-point crosses, and the order determined to be C-Gpi-AKV-1. The specificity of the mapping is then direct evidence of a chromosomal locus; second, the linkage to Cpi-1 makes testing for allelism with other phenotypes much easier ; third, since G p i (glucose phosphate isomerase) can be tested in tissue culture, work on somatic hybridization in tissue culture will be facilitated. Finally, localization of the gene in association with Cpi-1 \"may provide a unique means of examining the most crucial, and the most difficult to test, portion of the oncogene hypothesis, that is, that subinfectious expression of the inherited MuLV genome is a major determinant of malignancy, not only of leukemia, but of solid tumors as well.\"",

Thus it was assumed that NZB mice carried a gene(s) allowing release, wheras NIH Swiss mice failed to release the presumed xenotropic agent that they carried. Both the NZB and the BALB/c mice had antibody to the agent and yielded embryo cells which were induced by iododeoxyuridine to yield an agent which was measured by its specific polymerase activity. Thus is was assumed that the inducibility in the mice and in the cultures was a dominant character. These two strains were subjected to further genetic tests by crossing and backcrossing , and the amount of virus produced was followed by determining the specific polymerase activity of 1000-fold concentrates of tissue culture fluid. The RNA-dependent DNA polymerase activity was shown to be specific for type-C viral activity as measured by inhibition by antisera prepared against purified enzyme. It was emphasized that these results were for type 2 of the endogenous viruses of this strain of mice, i.e., for a xenotropic virus. NIH embryo cells released no detectable enzyme, and NZB released high levels, whereas the F1 hybrid embryo cells released intermediate amounts. Backcrosses yielded amounts of activity similar to that of the original line with which it was backcrossed, but the intermediate group remained at about 50% prevalence. The F2 generation showed a ratio of 8 high levels, 23 intermediate, and 9 with no specific enzyme.

(1975) who found that two strains of mice, C37L/He and C4/BL/6J, regularly had pancreatic acinar cells which contained moderate numbers of C-type particles. These particles increase greatly in number when mice are treated with dexametharone and also become extracellular. Two other strains of mice, C3H, and BALB/c, lack the particles and are not induced to produce them by dexamethazone. Crosses between the two C57BL strains (particles present) and the C3H, strain (particles absent) yielded F1 mice that had virus present. Thus the genetic expression from this cross is dominant. However, a cross with the BALB/c strain (also negative for particles) yielded an F1 generation which was negative, but which when backcrossed with the positive mice yielded about !50% positive mice. Thus the factor for expression is dominant with one cross and recessive with the other. These workers note that no particles are found in positive mice in tissues other than the pancreas. Thus the factor may also be expressed only in certain tissues. The relationship of this agent (known only by electron microscopy) to the other inducible agents remains to be determined.",

The first systematic studies were those of Law (1972) on the induction of the disease leukemia. In these studies, in addition to the effect of presumed Mendelian inheritance, a maternal influence was apparent in the F1 offspring. Then came the detailed studies on the inducibility of the virus-without data on development of the disease. Now, with knowledge that a specific leukemia virus may be induced by X rays (Kaplan, 1967) , the group at Stanford has determined the inheritance of susceptibility to the virus strain which had been originally X-ray-induced (Rad LV-1). Susceptibility to this virus turns out to be influenced greatly by the H-I? locus; i.e., the H-i?Dd allele confers resistance, and the H-i?DQ and H-bD' alleles are associated with susceptibility. Yet in a strain of mice other than that used in the above tests, a different gene, not linked to H-8, confers dominant susceptibility to the same virus, and this gene overrides the H-8Dd protection (Meruelo et al., 1977a,b) .",

As pointed out by Sager (1972) , cytoplasmic or organelle inheritance became acceptable with the development of techniques allowing one to study linkage groups of characters within the organelle and with the finding of DNA peculiar to mitochondria and chloroplasts. Thus it seems possible that true heritable cytoplasmic factors play a role in the compatibility of agent and host cells.

The fact that cell populations may carry more than one endogenous virus, and that some of them may be xenogenic, i.e., able to produce their effect only when grown on cells of other species, suggests that in the ultimate integration of virus and host there may be such a complete and common matching of the two that, as in the lysogenic bacterial system, the host becomes resistant to other members of the same virus group.",

Much of it is dependent upon the unique use of the mouse as an inbred standard animal whose genetic makeup is now much better understood through the use of congenic strains, pioneered by Snell in his transplantation studies (Snell, 1975) , and now extended to several host-virus systems. There are no other such extensively known vertebrate systems. The work on chicken tumors is limited by the lack of such systems. Doherty and Zirikernagel (1975) found that killer T cells must have the same histocompatibility type (H-dk compared to H-9d) as the virusinfected cells in order that the killer cells be effective in vitro. This has been confirmed in several but not all in vitro systems. Since it had previously been shown that the H-d type was influential in determining the prevalence of leukemia in mice (Lilly, 1969) , it has become of great interest to determine how the histocompatibility genotype interacts with the spontaneous induction of the virus, in turn leading to manifestation of disease. Lilly et a2. (1975) made various crosses and backcrosses between AKR (high-leukemia strain) and BALB/c (low-leukemia strain) and thereby established strains that were similar in having the AKV-I and AKV-d genes for spontaneous expression of the virus but which differed in both the genotype for FV-I (n versus b) and for the two variants of the H-$3 histocompatibility, H-dd and H-dk. First, as before, there was a close correlation between the presence of the virus in the backcrosses and the development of leukemia. The FV-I gene suppressed both viruses and thereby the subsequent leukemia. Finally, there was a highly significant nonrandom distribution of virus-negative mice among the backcross litters, suggesting a maternal effect on virus expression.",

These different parts are now beginning to be brought together. Genetic susceptibility to exogenous virus is a necessary prerequisite for virus multiplication, since early multiplication of the virus seems to be necessary for the later induction of tumor. However, genetic susceptibility to multiplication and Mendelian inheritance of the virus are now linked by the demonstration that exogenous virus (introduced into newborns) may be converted into endogenous virus by infecting embryos in vitro at the four-to eight-cell stage and reimplanting them in the mother. Inheritance of inducibility, as compared with inheritance of the spontaneously appearing virus, must follow very similar lines, perhaps modified by some as yet undescribed epistatic factor. The relationship of the specific normal thymus antigens which are directly related to an antigen of the virus itself now seem to have some connection with the question of susceptibility to the virus itself, since the FV gene (viral susceptibility) apparently controls the association of the GIX gene with a nonviral gene (that for glucose phosphate dehydrogenase) . Although no data clearly indicative of cytoplasmic inheritance of any factor controlling the development of leukemia have been forthcoming, as with the story of genetics in general, exceptions to Mendelian inheritance can only be satisfactorily explored when the basic Mendelian inheritance has been established. Rowe (1973) , who has been responsible for so many of the genetic analyses of susceptibility, inheritance of the genome, and inducibility, has discussed all this in relation to the development of cancer;",

The early investigators of the origin of mouse tumors, such as Lathrop and Loeb (1918) , showed that the incidence of mammary tumors in laboratory mice ran in families and that there tended to be a greater maternal influence in this inheritance. For instance, they found that after 24 matings of high-tumor and low-tumor mice, the mothers' influence was dominant in the progeny of 17. Also, in the progeny of 10 strains in which low-tumor rates dominated, the mothers' influence was apparent in 8. After inbred mouse strains were specifically developed for study of the inheritance of tumors, the Bar Harbor Laboratory under the leadership of C. C. Little (1956) showed that a cross between an established high-tumor strain (C3H) and a low-tumor strain produced hybrids in which the incidence of tumors depended upon the mother. That is, if tumors developed rapidly in the mother (within 1 year), the offspring had the same high incidence, while if the mother was of a low-tumor strain, then the offspring were also. The finding by Bittner (1940) and others that this maternal factor was a virus particle transferred in milk then led to a series of studies by Heston et al. (1940) in which genetic resistance to this transmissible factor was studied. Individual strains of mice differed not only in the incidence of tumors following a known standard dose of virus but also in their capacity to transmit the agent to their offspring (Heston et al., 1956) . This difference was apparent even when the mice were raised under identical conditions with the same foster mothers (Heston et al., 1956 ). Heston and co-workers then undertook to study the genetic control of the propagation and transmission of MTV-S, the standard milk agent. For this, they made a series of backcrosses of resistant C57B with C3H females. After two such backcrosses, the amount of agent was greatly reduced, and in the third it was no longer present in the milk, as judged by failure to induce tumors in the C3H1 (susceptible but milk agent-free) strain. A reduction in transmission of the agent had already occurred in the F1 generation. Reintroduction of susceptible C3H germ plasm by backcrossing the seventh backcross C57-C3H series with C3HI males did not reactivate the agent. These workers state that, because the agent was eliminated so early, it was possible that the strains differed by only a few genes controlling propagation and transmission, possibly by a single pair. However, later tests on the ability of the second backcross with the resistant mice continued t o show a proportion of transmission in great excess over the expected 50% (Heston et al., 1960) . This made it necessary to abandon the theory that one gene might be responsible for regulating transmission.",

            "text": "The milk agent was recognized and identified on the basis of the early development of mammary tumors in mice infected with the agent. Yet, histologically, identical tumors appeared in mice free of the milk agent (Andervont and Dunn, 1948; Heston et aL, 1950) , only about a year later than the milk factor-induced tumors. When these late tumors were examined in the electron microscope in mice free of the milk factor, they contained identical particles (Bang et al., 1956; Bernhard, 1960; Dmochowski, 1957) . This meant either that the particles were not the cause of the mammary tumor, or that there was some other method of transmission of this second presumed agent, now called MTV-L by Bentvelzen. Moore (1962) , in reviewing his own and other work, has argued that the virus particles are the cause of the tumor and therefore that some other method of transfer of this agent must be sought. Vellisto and Bang (1968) sought to free the milk agent-free (C3Hf) mice of the additional agent by establishing lines of mice derived from either the first litter of a female or from her last litter, and maintaining this procedure through five generations. The primiparous and multiparous lines were then subjected to identical stimuli, and it was shown that mice derived from the multiparous line developed fewer tumors from the eighteenth month on. However, the first daughters of the multiparous line reverted to the higher incidence, and there were equal numbers of tumors in the families of both lines. Virus (B) particles were found in tumors of both the primiparous and the multiparous lines. These workers suggested that the agents were transmitted as hereditary symbionts, as in the case of the carbon dioxide sensitivity factor of Drosophdu or the kappa particle of Pururnecium (Preer, 1971) . It is impossible to determine whether the association of the agent with the host in such a situation is cytoplasmic or nuclear (Mendelian) unless a test for the segregation of the character is performed either on the F2 generation or on various backcrosses of the FI generation. These tests in turn are difficult to evaluate unless the characters can be sharply separated and the incidence of tumors is high. Bentvelzen and Daams (1969) argue that \"the hereditary infection with MTV-L cannot be explained by a susceptibility gene,\" since hybrids of C3Hf and BALB/c develop more tumors than C3Hf, and, since this is a maternal effect, they suggest that by exclusion is transmitted as a genetic factor in the host.",

            "text": "The most striking recent advance in the understanding of the genetics of transmission of mammary tumor viruses came with. the development of a new strain of mice which was selected for a high incidence of'mammary tumors. This is the GR strain selected by Muhlbock (1965), and in this case a strain was produced in which the reciprocal crosses of highand low-tumor strains showed a 100% incidence of tumors. In addition, when mice were delivered by Caesarean section and foster-nursed, they still gave a high incidence of the tumors and also continued to transmit the agent in their milk. Thus the agent was transmitted by milk and apparently also derived from the male parent. Zeilmaker (1969) showed that MTV-P in females was transmitted by ova, since the transfer of fertilized eggs to females of a tumor-free strain produced a high incidence of tumors. These experiments were done with F1 hybrid eggs of a GR and either C57B2 (resistant) or BAGB/c males. Yet, all 10 such female offspring developed tumors a t 4-11 months of age. Bentvelzen (1968a) suggested that this virus strain was itself transmitted as a genetic factor. Bentvelzen and Daams (1969) showed that backcrosses between a hybrid of low-and high-tumor lines, which had 100% tumors, with a low-tumor line yielded intermediate results, indicating some segregation of the characters. Reciprocal backcrosses, however, showed a maternal influence (92% versus 21%), and three other backcrosses yielded about the expected 50% incidence of tumors. From this it was theorized that the infection was due to transmission of the virus as a genetic factor of the host. When this virus is transmitted to other strains of mice, it loses this characteristic (Bentvelzen, 1968a) .",

These data have been amply confirmed (Heston et al., 1976) . However, the idea that the agent is inherited or that its expression is regulated by a single gene may be further tested in two ways. First, the female mice may also be studied for the expression of virus in their milk (immunological tests) and, second, further backcrosses may be made with lowtumor mice. The picture then loses its sharpness (Nandi and Helmick, 1974) . Although there is a high correlation between the presence of the agent and the development of tumors, a much smaller proportion of mice actually develops the tumors than carries the agent. Furthermore, in the second backcross, the percentage of mice developing either virus or tumors decreases sharply as compared to the first backcross. The immediate question arises as to whether the results are contaminated by the presence of virus in the milk, but this should increase rather than decrease transmission and tumors. It is of course possible to argue that the decrease from the first backcross to the second is due t o the presence of increasing amounts of the basic resistant genotype in the second backcross, but the difference between this explanation and that preferred by us, i.e., that the inheritance of genetic susceptibility is affected by more than one factor, is not great.",
