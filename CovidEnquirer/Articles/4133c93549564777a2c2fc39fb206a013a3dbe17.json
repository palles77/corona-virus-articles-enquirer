No significant iIlhibition of IBV replication was observed when infected Vero cells were treated with a-amanitin or actinomycin D. In thin sections of infected cells, assembly of IBV was observed at the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), and mature IBV particles were located in dilated cisternae of the RER as well as in smooth cytoplasmic vesicles. In addition to typical IBV particles, enveloped particles containing numerous ribosomes were identified at later times p(~stinfection. Monensin. a sodium ionophore which blocks glycoprotein transport to plasma membranes at the level of the Golgi complex, was found to inhibit the formation of infectious IBV. In thin sections of infected Vero cells treated with the ionophore.",

The replication and glycoprotein transport of several enveloped viruses were reported to be inhibited by monensin (Johnson and Schlesinger, 1980; Johnson and Spear, 1982: Madoff and Lenard, 1982; Srinivas et al., 1982) . We have obtained evidence that this ionophore selectively blocks VSV replication and the transport of its membrane glycoprotein to Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell surfaces. whereas assembly and glycoprotein transport of influenza viruses are unaffected in these cells (Alonso and Compans, 1981; Alonso-Caplen and Compans, 1983) . Unlike most other enveloped RNA viruses which bud from plasma membranes of infected cells, IBV particles assemble at the intracellular membranes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) (Becker et al., 1967) . It was therefore of interest to determine the effects of monensin on IBV replication. We have investigated the effects of the ionophore on replication, polypeptide synthesis, and morphogenesis of IBV in Vero cells, a continuous cell line of African green monkey kidney origin. The results indicate that monensin affects assembly of this virus, which is not known to direct its membrane glycoproteins through the Golgi apparatus.",

At this concentration of cY-amanitin. there was no significant inhibition in the yield of IBV; less than a 2-fold reduction in yield of released IBV virions was observed under conditions which caused a drastic reduction in influenza virus infectivity titers. IBV replication in Vero cells was also found to be much less sensitive to aciinomycin D than was replication of influenza virus in these cells (not shown). At a concentration of 2 pg/ml of actinomycin D. we observed a lOOO-fold reduction in yields of infectious influenza virus whereas infectivity titers of released IBV virions were reduced by less than IO-fold.",

In some cells, cross-sections of IBV particles were also observed free in the cytoplasm of infected cells. i.e. not contained within RER membranes or cytoplasmic vesicles (Fig. 2B ). Virions were observed to mature by budding at intracellular membranes of the RER as seen in Fig. 2C ; such budding occurs by formation of crescents, or areas of the membrane which bulged toward the lumen of the RER on which a layer of dense material was apposed. Wsually, distinct striations were observed within the virus particles as shown in the leftmost inset of Fig. 2C . These striations have a diameter of 2-3 nm. which is similar to that of helical ribonucleoprotein complexes reported by others (Davies et al., 1981) . In some profiles, such as the particle shown in the right inset of Fig. 2C . virions were found to contain from 12 to 14 electron-dense globular structures of similar diameter. just within the perimeter of the envelope: these structures probably represent the helical ribonucleoprotein complexes in cross-section. These profiles suggest that the ribonucleoprotein is closely associated with the viral envelope. In addition to typical IBV particles, two other structures were observed at later times postinfection (Fig. 3) . Enveloped ribosome-containing particles, with diameters ranging from 50 to 200 nm, were observed in large numbers in perinuclear areas. These ribosome-containing structures were absent in uninfected Vero cells or in IBV-infected cells at early stages of infection; they appeared to be derived from vesiculation of the RER membrane. possibly as a result of overproduction of viral membrane proteins which may accumulate at this site. Many of the ribosome-containing particles appeared to show a discontinuity in their envelope, also suggesting that they may result from an aberrant budding process. In addition, smooth-walled vesicles, which appeared empty in cross-section, were found in adjacent regions of the cytoplasm. These structures were observed in clusters. and were surrounded by electron-dense filamentous structures (Fig. 3, inset) .",

The titers of cell-associated IBV virions, obtained by one cycle of freeze-thawing, were reduced slightly at lo-' M monensin c~?ncentration; at 10e5 M m~~nensin, however, only low levels of cell-associated IBV virions were detected. To further investigate the effects of monensin on assembly of IBV virions, we examined thin sections of IBV-infected Vero cells in the presence of a lo-\" M ( vesicles were observed which contained IBV particles; however, the concentration of particles was not increased when compared to controls, and was greatly reduced in the case of cells treated with lo-\" M monensin. The vesicles, which are presumed to be of Golgi origin, are similar to structures previously described in monensin-treated cells (Tartakoff and Vassalli. 1977, 1978; Johnson and Schlesinger, 1980) and are markedly dilated when compared to smooth cytoplasmic vesicles found in untreated IBV-infected Vero cells. These results indicate that assembly of infectious IBV is significantly inhibited by monensin; reductions in yields of released virus are not merely a result of intracellular accumulation of virions.",

There were no significant changes observed in the amounts of electrophoretic mobilities of any of these polypeptides at concentrations of monensin up to 10mh M. where infectious virus yields were reduced by over IO-fold. This supports the conclusion that monensin inhibits the formation of infectious IBV particles under conditions where no effect on viral protein synthesis is observed.

Previous reports (Coria and Ritchie, 1973; Cunningham et al., 1972) described the serial passage of IBV in Vero cells after initial adaptation in embryonated eggs and chicken embryo kidney cells (CEK), followed by passages in suckling mouse brain; however, the maximum infectious virus yield reported was significantly lower than that observed in the present study. We have also investigated aspects of the replication process of IBV in Vero cells using cu-amanitin, a fungal toxin which inhibits DNA-dependent RNA polymerase II, and actinomycin D, which binds to DNA and impedes the movement of RNA polymerase (Roeder, 1976) . Under experimental conditions and drug concentrations which significantly inhibited growth in Vero cells of influenza virus, but not of VSV. we have observed that IBV replication in Vero cells is relatively resistant to cu-amanitin. as well as to low concentrations of actinomycin D. indicating that host cell RNA polymerase activity is not required for growth of IBV. In previous reports on the sensitivity of coronavirus replication to these two drugs, human coronavirus 229E (Kennedy and Johnson-Lussenberg, 1979) and IBV propagated in BHK21 cells (Evans and Simpson, 1980) were reported to be sensitive to actinomycin D, and IBV was also reported to be sensitive to cr-amanitin (Evans and Simpson. 1980) . However, there was no reduction observed in the yield of infectious IBV from actinomycin D-treated CEK cells (Stern and Kennedy. 1980) . Replication of mouse hepatitis virus was also reported to be insensitive to actinomycin D (Brayton et al., 1981; Wilhelmsen et al., 1981; Mahy et al., 1983) and to a-amanitin (Mahy et al., 1983) indicating that DNA-directed RNA synthesis does not play a significant role in murine coronavirus replication.",

This observation is consistent with other studies on coronavirus morphogenesis. Coronaviruses mature by budding from the intracellular membranes of the RER and migrate through the Golgi apparatus. and are transported to the plasma membrane via Golgi-derived vesicles; virions are then presumably released from intact cells by fusion of these vesicles with the plasma membrane (Robb and Bond. 1979; Holmes et al., 1981) . The present finding of some IBV particles apparently free in the cytoplasm is unusual; possibly, this results from disruption of intracellular vesicles containing virus particles. A striking feature of IBV-infected Vero cells at late stages in infection was the presence of numerous enveloped particles containing ribosomes. We suggest that these structures are derived from infoldings of the RER as a result of modification by viral membrane proteins. The radiolabeling protocol used in the present study revealed three major viral polypeptides.",

These results suggest that polypeptide synthesis in IBV-infected Vero cells may resemble patterns observed with mammalian coronaviruses (Sturman, 1977; Siddell et al., 1982) : additional viral polypeptides may be present at low levels, but were not resolved. Analysis of the glycosylation process of IBV glycoproteins in Vero cells has indicated that gp170 and gp24 both possess N-linked oligosaccharides (Y. Matsuoka. unpublished), as has been observed for IBV glycoproteins in avian cells (Stern and Sefton, 1982b; Cavanagh, 1983) . Monovalent ionophores such as monensin have been shown to inhibit the intracellular transport of both membrane and secretory glycoproteins from their site of synthesis in the RER to the plasma membranes of eukaryotic cells (reviewed by Tartakoff, 1983) . with a block in transport occurring at the level of the Golgi complex. Since IBV was observed to bud at intracellular membranes of the RER. we compared the effects of monensin on the assembly of IBV with its effect on other enveloped viruses that form at the cell surface. We observed that production of infectious IBV particles was inhibited significantly at high concentrations of ionophore. The inhibition of IBV replication by monensin occurred under conditions where no effect on viral protein synthesis was observed. Examination of thin sections of monensin-treated cells showed mature IBV particles located in dilated cytoplasmic vesicles, which are probably also derived from the Golgi membranes (Alonso and Compans, 1981; Tartakoff and Vassalli, 1977, 1978) . Since the inhibition of IBV release was not paralleled by an accumulation of cell-associated virions, monensin apparently did not merely block the exocytosis of infectious particles. In a previous study of 17Cll cells infected with murine coronavirus. however, virus budding was apparently not inhibited by monensin. and virions were found to accumulate in large amounts within the RER (Niemann et al., 1982) . The El glycoprotein of murine coronaviruses possesses O-linked oligosaccharides which are added post-translation, and glycosylation of this polypeptide was completely blocked in monensin-treated cells (Niemann et al., 1982) . In contrast, we found that the electrophoretic mobilities of IBV glycoproteins were not altered in monensin-treated cells, indicating that the incorporation of N-linked oligosaccharides continues normally in these glycoproteins.",
