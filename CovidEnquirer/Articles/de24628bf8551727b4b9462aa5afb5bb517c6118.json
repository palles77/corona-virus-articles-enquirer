We have expressed the second open reading frame of this gene (gene 5 ORF 2) in an Escherichia co/i expression system. This system utilized a plasmid which contained the promoter and the first 36 codons of the recA gene fused in frame with the MHV gene 5 ORF 2, which is fused in turn to the &galactosidase gene. The protein product of this gene fusion was used to raise antibody to gene 5 ORF 2. The specificity of the antibody was verified by immunoprecipitation of the in vitro transcribed and translated protein product of gene 5 ORF 2. The second reading frame of MHV gene 5 was shown to be expressed during the course of infection by immunocytochemistty and radioimmunoprecipitation using the antibody raised against the E. co/i fusion protein and by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.",

RNA 2 encodes a 30-to 35-kDa nonstructural protein (Leibowitz et al., 1982; Siddell, 1983) . The coding assignments for RNAs 4 and 5 have been harder to determine, in part because of difficulties in resolving these two species. In cellfree translation studies, a 14-kDa nonstructural protein was synthesized in response to a mixture of these two mRNAs (Leibowitz et al., 1982; Siddell, 1983) . These functional studies of MHV mRNA have led to the hypothesis that the most 5' sequences of each mRNA, not present in smaller mRNA species, contain the coding sequences utilized during infection. This hypothesis has allowed the construction of a tentative genetic map of MHV, shown in Fig. 1 .",

Sequence analyses of mRNA cDNA clones corresponding to the 5' portions of RNA 4 of MHV, strain JHM, demonstrate that the unique 5' terminus of RNA 4 contains an open reading frame encoding a 15.4-kDa protein . This is similar in size to the 14-kDa nonvirion protein observed in MHV-infected cells (Leibowitz et al., 1982; Rottier eta/., 1982; Siddell, 1983) and sequencing experiments Budzrlowrcz and Weiss, 1987) , assuming that each mRNA is translated from its 5' unique sequences. A map of the portion of clone 9344 whrch contains gene 5 is shown at the bottom of the figure. ORF 1 and ORF 2 are depicted as solid dark Irnes. The posrtions of their initiating AUG codons and the restriction sites relevant to thts work are indicated. of 13 and 9.6 kDa (Budzilowicz and Weiss, 1987) . Similar results have been obtained in sequencing studies of cDNA clones representing the genome of MHV, strain JHM (Skinner er al., 1985) . The question of which of the two open reading frames present in MHV RNA 5 is expressed in infected cells is not addressed by the above data. Recently Budzilowicz and Weiss (1987) have demonstrated that RNA synthesized in vitro from pGEM recombinant vectors containing these open reading frames can be translated in vitro into polypeptides corresponding in size to both reading frames, although the downstream open reading frame is translated preferentially.",

Plasmid pGE372 is a derivative of the plasmid pBR322 in which the tet gene (between the EcoRl and Aval sites in pBR322) has been replaced by a fusion of the E. co/i recA and /acZ genes. The fusion contains the regulatory region from recA as well as the first 36 codons of the structural gene. The recA sequence is followed by /acZ, encoding P-galactosidase. The /acZ sequence is missing its promoter, translation start site, and first eight codons. However, the /acZ sequence is fused in frame to recA, such that a RecA-/3-galactosidase hybrid protein is produced. A BamHl site is located between recA and /acZ in pGE372. Plasmid pGE374 is analogous to pGE372 except that the spacer sequence between recA and laczdiffers such that the /acZ reading frame is +2 with respect to the recA reading frame. Consequently a hybrid protein is not produced. ",

Mitomycin C was added to the cells at a concentration of 1 pg/ml to induce the recA promoter and the cultures were incubated for an additional 3 hr. Induction with mitomycin C was necessary since the presence of MHV inserts dramatically decreased the amount of the tribrid protein synthesized relative to the parental RecA-LacZ fusions (data not shown). The cells were harvested and protein extracts were prepared as described above. The tribrid proteins were resolved by electrophoresis on 8% polyacrylamide gels, located by Coomassie blue staining of strips cut from the ends of the preparative gel, electroeluted as described previously (Welch et al., 1981) and quantitated. Between 50 and 100 pg of protein was homogenized with complete Freund's adjuvant and injected subcutaneously in two NZW rabbits. Rabbits were subsequently boosted at approximately 4-week intervals by injection of antigen in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Antisera were initially evaluated by immunoblotting against bacterial extracts which had been resolved by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. These extracts were prepared from bacteria carrying the plasmids pGEA59.G5.2, pGE372, and pGE374. At least three immunizations were required before activity against the appropriate bands on the Western blots was observed. This assay merely measured the reactivity of the sera with the tribrid protein and does not distinguish between reactivity to RecA, LacZ, and MHV determinants.",

Therefore bacteria containing this construct will synthesize a tribrid protein consisting of the first 36 amino acids of the RecA protein, the amino acids encoded by the second open reading frame of MHV gene 5, and the 1015 C-terminal amino acids of fl-galactosidase. Bacteria containing this plasmid will form blue colonies in the presence of an appropriate chromagen such as X-Gal. Bacteria containing plasmids with the MHV insert in the opposite orientation will not express P-galactosidase activity due to encountering a termination codon within the MHV insert. pGE372 is an in frame recA-/acZ fusion and thus transformants containing this plasmid will also be P-galactosidase positive.

The results of this analysis for the clone used in all subsequent experiments, designated pGEA59.G5.2, are shown in Fig. 3 . This clone carries a plasmid containing an insert of the predicted size which strongly hybridized with the MHV probe. Protein extracts were prepared from this bacteria carrying this plasmid, unmodified pGE372, or pGE374 as described under Materials and Methods. These extracts were then electrophoresed on 8% polyacrylamide gels and the resolved proteins were visualized by Coomassie blue staining. A band representing the putative RecA-MHV-LacZ tribrid protein was tentatively identified by comparison with pGE372, which directed the synthesis of the RecA-LacZ fusion protein, and with pGE374, which did not since the RecA-LacZ fusion in this vector was out of frame. No difference in electrophoretic mobility could be demonstrated between the putative tribrid protein and the RecA-LacZ fusion protein synthesized in bacteria bearing the plasmid pGE372 (data not shown). To demonstrate that synthesis of the putative RecA-ORF 2-LacZ fusion protein was initiating at the desired site, we performed a Western blot analysis of protein extracts of pGE372, pGE374, and clone pGEA59.G5.2 (Fig. 3B) . Inspection of the amido black stained filter allows the identification of a protein present in extracts of pGE372 and pGEA59.G5.2 and missing from pGE374. The apparent molecular weight of this protein was about 120 kDa, the predicted molecular weight of the RecA-LacZ fusion present in pGE372. An identical filter was probed for the pres- lanes 1 and 4) . pGE372 (lanes 2 and 5) and pGE374 (lanes 3 and 6) . Bacterial extracts were prepared, electrophoresed on an 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and transferred to nitrocellulose as described under Materials and Methods. Lanes l-3 were stained with amido black. Lanes 4-6 were stained with rabbit anti-RecA antibody used at a dilution of 1: 1000. The positions of molecular weight markers are indicated on the left. ence of RecA antigen using a rabbit anti-RecA antibody. As shown in Fig. 3B , the 120-kDa protein synthesized by pGE372 and pGEA59.G5.2, but absent in extracts of bacteria containing pGE374, reacted with the anti-RecA antibody. Thus we concluded that the plasmid pGEA59.G5.2 contained the desired MHV sequences inserted into the BarnHI site between the recA and /acZ sequences, conferred B-galactosidase activity on bacteria containing it, and directed the synthesis of a protein which reacts with anti-RecA antisera and therefore presumably contains RecA sequences at its N-terminus. This led us to conclude that the putative tribrid protein did in fact express the second open reading frame of MHV-A59 gene 5.",

Lane 1, infected cell extract (labeled 6.5-7.5 hr p.1.) precipitated with preimmune serum. Lane 2, uninfected cell extract precipitated with anti-ORF 2 serum. Lanes 3 and 4. infected cell extracts labeled at 3.5-4.5 hr p.i. and 6.5-7.5 hr p.i.. respectively, and preclpltated with anti-ORF 2 serum. Lane 5, cell-free translation product of gene 5 ORF 2 gene. Lanes 6 and 7, total cytoplasmic extract of cells labeled at 6.5-7.5 hr p.i. The positions of molecular weight markers are indicated on the left and the El and N viral structural proteins are indicated on the right. Lane 7 was exposed for l/l0 as long as the rest of the gel. , 1981) . In regard to translational regulation, the sequence found near the initiation site of protein synthesis in gene 5 ORF 2, GAAAUGU, is not a good match for the Kozak eukaryotic consensus initiation sequence A(G)CCAUGG (Kozak, 1984) . The most important divergence is at the strongly conserved -3 position. A is present at this position with a frequency of 79%, and G with a frequency of 18% in eukatyotic mRNAs. However, other MHV genes are better matches. Gene 6 (El) and gene 7 (N) have initiation codons embedded in the sequences AUUAUGA and AGGAUGA (Spaan et al., 1983) , respectively. These are sequences which are frequently used by eukary otic mRNAs.",

            "text": "The role of the MHV gene 5 ORF 2 protein in the infected cell is unknown. The coronavirus IBV is predicted to direct the synthesis of two small proteins encoded by overlapping reading frames in a fashion similar to that of MHV gene 5 (Boursnell and Brown, 1984) . One of these is quite hydrophobic and is a likely counterpart to the protein encoded in MHV gene 5 ORF 2. Other families of RNA viruses have recently been demonstrated to encode small hydrophobic proteins as well. Influenza virus induces the synthesis of the nonstructural M* protein, an integral membrane protein (Zebedee et al., 1985) . The paramyxovirus SV5 also encodes a small extremely hydrophobic protein (Hiebert er a/., 1985) . The functions of all of these proteins in viral replication are unknown at present. The approach that we used in this paper to construct a plasmid which directed the synthesis of a tribrid protein suitable for raising antibodies to ORF 2 required knowledge of the sequence of gene 5. We have recently modified our approach to make it more generally useful, even when the sequence of the gene in question is not known. Randomizing the ends of the insert and vector by homopolymer tailing or by nuclease digestion prior to ligation will produce the appropriate gene fusion in about 6% of the transformants obtained. Furthermore, the ability to probe for the presence of the correct N-terminus of the tribrid protein by immunoblot analysis with anti-RecA antibody, the correct C-terminus by the presence of P-galactosidase activity, and the insert by Southern hybridization provides assurance that the correct construction has been achieved.",
