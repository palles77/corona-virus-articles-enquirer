Microvilli may have a role in retaining secreted, hyaluronate-based lubricants. Tight juncdons and desmosomes are discontinuous in the surface layer, allowing for diffusion across the membrane. Hydraulic forces generally favor net movement of fluid from the vessels in the retroperitoneum into the peritoneal cavity. Mesothelial cells are fragile and will slough after exposure to such mild insults as exposure to air, physiological saline, intestinal dilation, and transient ischemia.

Normal fluid contains only traces of protein and secreted macromolecules, such as chondroitn sulfate, that reduce permeability. The electronegatvity of the endothelium relative to mesothelium inhibits transfer of plasma proteins from capillaries into the cavity. The net hydraulic forces favor movement of fluid into the cavity. Several pathways contribute to the drainage of peritoneal fluid. Direct transfer through stomata in the membrane to subserosal lymphatics is the main mechanism, dominated by transfer into lymphatics of the ventral diaphragm, and thence via the sternal lymph nodes to the right lymphatic duct, or via mediastinal lymph nodes to the thoracic duct. Respiratory diaphragmatic movements assist transfer through the diaphragm to ventral mediastinal lymphatics. Less is taken up through the omentum and abdominal viscera, and drains via visceral lymphatics and lymph nodes to the thoracic duct. There is a lesser contribution to drainage by the pelvic serosa.Transfer of peritoneal fluid through and between mesothelial cells occurs but is minor.",

They are nests of macrophages mixed with lesser numbers of lymphocytes and responsible, in part, for the removal of effete macromolecules and foreign particles from the peritoneal cavity. The presence of adhesion molecules and active cell proliferation in omental milky spots demonstrates that these are active sites for leukocyte migration and supply of peritoneal leukocytes. The connective tissue that underlies the mesothelium has an ordinary mix of connective tissue cells and may not easily be distinguished from the retroperitoneum, but the cells appear to have alternative potentials in reaction to injury or surface abrasion and may replace differentiated mesothelial cells of the surface.",

The lesion may be clinically silent for a considerable period, sometimes years, but sooner or later results in respiratory difficulty, hydrothorax, ascites, chylothorax, gastric tympany, and intestinal obstruction. At surgery or necropsy, acute diaphragmatic laceration is obvious. If chronic, the margin of laceration is usually thickened by fibroplasia and smooth, but rarely there may be adhesion to the viscera. Differentiation of such lesions from congenital hernias is based on the age, clinical history, and any evidence of scarring or adhesions at the margin of the diaphragmatic defect.",

Differences in distribution, type of exudate, and duration of the lesion can be more or less anticipated from the source and the cause. Most cases of peritonitis in domestic animals are secondary; that is, they arise as complications of other events in the abdomen, but primary serositis in systemic infections is of much importance for agricultural livestock. The causes of peritonitis are numerous and varied, so only some of the more common and important of them are considered here. Chemical peritonitis may be induced by a variety of agents.The intraperitoneal instillation of a number of therapeutic agents causes a mild, and usually inconsequential, peritonitis. However, lavage of the abdomen has been associated with serosal damage and formation of adhesions. Talc, formerly used as surgical glove powder, and starch, now used for that purpose, may provoke granulomatous peritonitis. Characteristic starch granules may be recognized in phagocytes within granulomas, forming a Maltese cross in polarized light, and with positive periodic acid-Schiff staining. Barium sulfate that accidentally spills into the abdomen during contrast studies is highly irritating, causing a potentially fatal hemorrhagic peritonitis, often complicated by intercurrent sepsis.

Occasionally, A. pyogenes produces discrete encapsulated abscesses as profuse implants on both visceral and parietal peritoneum. Serofibrinous peritonitis, with fibrinous arthritis and exudation on other serous surfaces, is indicative of Glasser's disease, caused by Haemophilus parasuis. Mycoplasma hyorhinis and possibly other mycoplasmas frequently complicate respiratory mycoplasmosis and produce serofibrinous peritonitis that becomes fibrous, with adhesions to a thickened serous membrane; this disease is to be distinguished from Glasser's disease, and from septicemias due to Streptococcus suis type 2. Small, firm, lemon-yellow nodules and flattened disks of inspissated fibrin are often found free in the peritoneal cavity in chronic Mycoplasma infections. In intestinal anthrax in swine, there is acute gelatinous hemorrhagic peritonitis typically localized to the mesentery between the intestine and the mesenteric node, the distribution of the lesion being due to the lymphatic spread of the infection from the intestine. Tuberculous peritonitis in swine is localized and characterized by adhesions to the spleen. Rectal strictures in swine cause marked dilation of the colon and cecum.The serosa is frequently thickened, white, and covered with fibrin tags, similar to that of infectious serositis.

FIPV appears to have evolved as a deletion mutation of FECV. Antibodies produced against FIPV cannot be distinguished readily from those stimulated by the other FCoVs. Genetic analysis of virus in catteries or closed colonies indicates that the viruses form a clade, but that individual cats may harbor a distinct quasispecies.

Large numbers of neutrophils, mononuclear cells, and necrotic debris may be embedded in the fibrin.

The ependyma may be visibly roughened and develop reactive syncytia of lining cells. Ocular lesions are common, but usually subclinical (seeVol. 1,Eye and ear). Effusive FIP must be differentiated from bacterial peritonitis in particular, but noneffusive forms may be similar to manifestations of lymphosarcoma, steatitis, mycotic infections, and toxoplasmosis. With thorough necropsy, the constellation of lesions is usually sufficiently distinctive to allow a gross diagnosis with a high degree of accuracy. Testing by immunofluorescence or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay may be useful in supporting a diagnosis of FIR but histopathology remains the only conclusive means of diagnosis of FIP. ",

Mesotheliomas are rare. They occur with greatest frequency in cattle and dogs but are occasionally reported in horses, cats, pigs, and other species. Interest in mesotheliomas has increased since the association between asbestos fiber and mesothelioma was discovered in humans. This association has not been confirmed in animals, though ferruginous bodies, suggestive of asbestos exposure, have been found in the lungs of some urban dogs with mesothelioma, and an association has been made between mesothelioma in dogs and exposure of owners to asbestos. Many fiber types other than asbestos are capable of causing mesotheliomas and this ability seems to be related to fiber size and solubility. In domestic animals, mesothelioma is notable because it occurs most frequently as a congenital neoplasm in fetal or young cattle (Fig. 1.221) .",

Ovarian carcinomas are a cause of ascites, and may be dill]cult to differentiate from mesothelioma. Implants of ovarian carcinoma tend to be papillary. Bile duct carcinomas and pancreatic adenocarcinomas tend to be scirrhous, as do intestinal adenocarcinomas in cattle and sheep. Squamous cell carcinomas of the equine stomach form rather discrete implants that may resemble nodules of mesothelioma, or granulomas; they may be differentiated enough to be recognizably keratinized on gross inspection. Transitional cell tumors developing in cattle with enzootic hematuria implant locally on the pelvic surfaces; implants from rectal adenocarcinoma in dogs also tend to be confined to the pelvic peritoneum. Malignant melanomas of perineal origin in horses produce pigmented plaques on the peritoneum, or in the mesenteries, as may occasional metastatic melanomas in dogs.

            "text": "Setaria spp., onchocercid filarioid nematodes, inhabit the peritoneal cavity of many domestic and wild ungulates such as horses, cattle, buffalo, camels, sheep, goats, swine, deer, and antelope. They are commonly found at autopsy in cattle and horses in endemic areas. Some species of Setaria have a cosmopolitan distribution and may be found in several species of wild and domestic ungulates (S. equina in equids; S. labiatopapillosa in cattle, buffalo, and perhaps deer and antelope), while others are restricted geographically (S. digitata, Asia; S. marshalli, Asia) perhaps by the distribution of intermediate hosts.Adult Setaria do not usually cause significant peritoneal lesions in their normal host. There are rare reports of occlusion of the uterine tube by S. labiatopapillosa in cattle. As well, adult S. labiatopapillosa in the peritoneal cavity, or in the vaginal space around the testis, may incite granulomatous peritonitis or periorchitis if they die; remnants of the dead nematode may be detected in sections of the granulomatous reaction. Adult S. digitata may occasionally be found in abnormal locations, such as the heart, lungs, and mesenteric lymph nodes, where they incite eosinophilic granulomas.The larval form of S. digitata can produce mild adhesive peritonitis and granulomas in the retroperitoneum and bladder of cattle.The larvae of S. equina, S. digitata, and perhaps others that normally spend part of their time in the central nervous system, may occasionally penetrate the neural parenchyma and cause lesions. The sheathed microfilariae deposited by adult females in the peritoneal cavity are found in the blood.The intermediate host may be a mosquito, or for some Setaria spp., biting flies (Haematobia and Stomoxys spp). The microfilariae develop into infective larvae in 2-3 weeks. They are released from the feeding arthropod and enter the final host. digitata is normally found as an adult in the peritoneal cavity of cattle and buffalo in Asia, but its larvae can cause cerebrospinal nematodiasis in aberrant hosts (see Vol. 1, Nervous system). Setaria species that may occur normally in cervids have been reported to cause central nervous system lesions in deer; however, Elaphostrongylus larvae produce similar signs and lesions, and differentiation may be difficult.S. digitata larvae may invade the eye of horses, via the optic nerve, as do the microfilariae of S. equina.

            "text": "Problems in the retroperitoneum may originate in the stroma of the space itself, from organs in this space, or may extend from adjacent organs.Retroperitonitis may arise from sepsis involving the pelvic or abdominal urogenital tract, or the mesenteric root; from penetrating wounds; from rectal tears in horses; and from migrating grass awns or other foreign bodies. Frequently, it will evolve to form a fluctuant abscess or draining fistula in the flank, based on the anatomic path of least resistance for advancing phlegmon in the soft tissue of the region.The lesion is usually a poorly encapsulated sinus or abscess, with a wall of granulation tissue and containing liquid pus. It may extend to involve adjacent vertebrae in periostitis or osteomyelitis.A foreign body may be encountered on exploration, or the lesion may be traced back to a primary septic focus in the abdomen, perhaps a renal or perirenal abscess; an ovarian stump with a remnant of unresorbed suture; or an abscess or pyogranuloma in the root of the mesentery. Usually, a mixed flora will be isolated. IfActinomyces spp. are implicated, there may be granulomatous lesions with sulfur granules in the abdomen or flank.Nonneoplastic retroperitoneal masses include hematomas, or accumulations of urine, following trauma to the caudal abdominal or pelvic area. Hemorrhage may dissect widely in this area, and the origin may be difficult to detect. Rupture of retroperitoneal hematomas may be fatal. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage in newborn calves is often an indication of fracture of the spinal column due to rotation during assisted calving. Sublumbar hemorrhage is frequent in male lambs castrated by traction of the testis. Renal and perirenal cysts, and pseudocysts or capsular cysts, may also be encountered, usually incidentally.Neoplasms of the retroperitoneal space include lipomas, fibrosarcomas, lymphosarcomas, osteosarcomas, and nonchromaffin paragangliomas, as wall as primary renal adenocarcinomas and adrenal tumors. Occasional highly malignant adenocarcinomas of obscure origin occur in the dorsal retroperitoneum of dogs.Metastatic tumors to the region include those commonly involving the sublumbar lymph nodes, such as lymphosarcoma, and transitional cell, prostatic, colonic, perianal gland, and anal gland malignancies. Metastatic involvement of the sublumbar chain of lymph nodes frequently stimulates periosteal reaction on the ventral aspect of adjacent vertebral bodies. Occasionally, tumors metastatic to the region will lyse vertebral bodies or transverse processes, and they may occasionally invade the spinal canal. Lytic and osteophytic reactions must be distinguished from the effects of osteomyelitis.",
