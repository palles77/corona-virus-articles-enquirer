We conducted a systematic review to examine waterborne outbreaks following such events and explored their distribution between the different types of extreme water-related weather events. Four medical and meteorological databases (Medline, Embase, GeoRef, PubMed) and a global electronic reporting system (ProMED) were searched, from 1910 to 2010. Eighty-seven waterborne outbreaks involving extreme water-related weather events were identified and included, alongside 235 ProMED reports. Heavy rainfall and flooding were the most common events preceding outbreaks associated with extreme weather and were reported in 55 . 2 % and 52 . 9% of accounts, respectively. The most common pathogens reported in these outbreaks were Vibrio spp. (21 . 6%) and Leptospira spp. (12 . 7 %). Outbreaks following extreme water-related weather events were often the result of contamination of the drinking-water supply (53 . 7 %). Differences in reporting of outbreaks were seen between the scientific literature and ProMED. Extreme water-related weather events represent a risk to public health in both developed and developing countries, but impact will be disproportionate and likely to compound existing health disparities.",

Recent extreme water-related weather events have included drought in Russia and flooding in Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Pakistan, Australia and Brazil. Weather is expected to become more extreme and variable due to acceleration of the water cycle caused by atmospheric heating. Altered pressure and temperature patterns, caused by global warming, may also shift the distribution of when and where extreme water-related events usually occur [4] . . The frequency of heavy precipitation events is thought to have increased over many mid-latitude regions since 1950, even where there has been a reduction in the total precipitation. The area affected by drought is thought to have increased since the 1970s in many areas of the world [4] . There is also evidence to suggest that other extreme water-related weather events such as El Nin\u02dco Southern Oscillation (ENSO), hurricanes, and cyclones are becoming more frequent, intense and of greater duration [4, 5] .",

Such events can therefore increase raw water turbidity, which has been found to be associated with gastrointestinal illness [7] . Heavy rainfall can also lead to changes in the direction of flow of water through channels that would not normally occur [8] . During periods of heavy rainfall, water treatment plants may be overwhelmed, there may be cross-contamination between sewage and drinking-water pipes (particularly where water infrastructure is old), sewage overflow, or bypass into local waterways [9] . Extreme precipitation events may also increase the risk of flooding in many areas, increasing human exposure to waterborne pathogens [10] . Droughts or extended dry periods are known to reduce the volume of river flow and potentially increase the concentration of effluent-derived pathogens, due to reduced dilution by stream-receiving waters [11] .",

Waterborne diseases are expected to rise with increases in extreme rainfall and deterioration in water quality following wider drought events [2] . It is important to establish the current impact of such events on public health to allow future predictions, aid policy formulation, and improve adaptive capacity. The impact of recent events demonstrates that even high-income countries are not well prepared to cope with extreme weather events [2] . There is also limited information available on how different extreme water-related weather events will impact different geographical areas and pathogens. This is the first global systematic review of the impact of weather on waterborne disease. The aim was to assess how the different categories of extreme water-related weather events impact waterborne disease, by geographical area, pathogen and outcome.",

An extreme water-related weather event was defined as a meteorological change in the conditions of a region, involving a quantity of water more or less than is usually seen in the region. Key terms used for identification of extreme water-related weather events were identified from the National Climate Data Centre [13] and included : flooding, drought, heavy rainfall, El Nin\u02dco Southern Oscillation (ENSO), hurricane, cyclone, other extreme storm, seawater inundation, extreme water run-off, and extreme changes in water level or temperature (see Table 1 ). A list of known waterborne pathogens was compiled and used to generate key search terms for the identification of waterborne infectious disease. Search strategies which combined the key search terms and subject headings for both waterborne infectious disease and extreme water-related weather events were used to interrogate the online databases. The titles, key words and abstracts of articles included in the online databases were searched for these search terms. It was not possible to search the full texts as not all citations had been indexed and scanned into the online databases and relevant published articles without abstract or key words may not have been picked up based on their titles alone. An example of the search strategies used can be found in the Supplementary online material (Appendix 1). The grey literature was also searched on 12 May 2010 using the Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases (ProMed-mail) [14] and an online search engine [15] . Both sources were searched using combinations of the key search terms; a list of these combinations can be found in Appendix 2 (online).",

The majority of the reported outbreaks, where extreme water-related weather events were involved, Is the outbreak/epidemic/increase in cases due to waterbore pathogens \u2020? were in North America, followed by Asia and Europe. The pathogens involved were specified in 74 (85 . 1%) of the outbreaks following extreme weather events and are listed in Table 2 . The most commonly reported were Vibrio spp. (28 . 4 %) and Leptospira spp. (17 . 6 %). Most reported outbreaks of Vibrio spp. following extreme water-related weather events occurred in Asia, followed by Africa and South America, while most reported outbreaks due to Leptospira spp. were in North America or Asia. More than one pathogen was identified on 16/74 (21 . 6 %) occasions, mostly in North America or Asia (37 . 5% and 31 . 3 %, respectively), followed by Europe (18 . 8%). Of the 74 outbreaks in which the causal pathogen was identified, 31 (41 . 9 %) reported testing the water supply. Of these, the causal pathogen was stated to have been identified in just over half (54 . 8 %), confirming the water supply as the source. Out of all outbreaks associated with extreme waterrelated weather events, heavy rainfall and flooding were by far the most commonly reported antecedents (in 55 . 2% and 52 . 9 % of published accounts, respectively) (see Fig. 3 ). Forty-five (51 . 7 %) of the outbreaks following extreme water-related weather events reported more than one event to have been involved. Heavy rainfall and flooding were the most common combination of events preceding outbreaks (27 . 6 % of all accounts). Heavy rainfall was also linked with heavy water run-off and hurricane, and flooding was also linked with hurricane. Fifty-four (58 . 0 %) reports of outbreaks following extreme water-related weather events gave details of how the event was thought to have led to the outbreak. In just over half (53 . 7%) of reports providing this information, the extreme water-related weather event caused the outbreak through contamination of the water supply, usually through increased run-off of water from the surrounding area (22 . 2%) or by inundation (20 . 4 %). Exposure to contaminated water by physical activity occurred in 16 . 7% of the outbreak reports associated with extreme water-related weather events, but this was recreational activity in only 3 . 7 %. More commonly contact with floodwater occurred while wading or during the cleaning up process (9 . 3 %). A change in the survival rates of pathogens due to changing environmental conditions (such as water temperature or stagnation) was thought to be the cause in 9 . 3 % of outbreak reports in which an extreme water-related weather event was implicated. Failure to cope by the water treatment plant were blamed in 7 . 4 % of papers providing information on the role of the extreme waterrelated event in the outbreak. Failure or inability to cope by sewage systems, resulting in contamination of the water supply were also blamed in 7 . 4% of reports. Of 27 accounts of waterborne outbreaks following extreme water-related weather events from developed countries which reported the information, the route of infection was through the mains water supply for 66 . 9 %, through other treated water for 37 . 0 %, and through a well supply for 29 . 6 %. By comparison, 22 . 2 % were infected through environmental exposure and 11 . 1 % of the outbreaks involved both environmental exposure and the water supply. Campylobacter spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. were common causal pathogens in outbreaks associated with extreme water-related weather events originating from treated mains water. Waterborne pathogens originating from environmental exposure following extreme weather reported laboratory-confirmed cases, 13 (20 . 6%) relied on self-reporting of cases, 13 (20 . 6%) relied on a clinical diagnosis, and 16 (25 . 4 %) did not report this information.",

It is difficult to achieve the optimal balance between sensitivity and specificity, as time and resource constraints limited the number of abstracts which could be screened for inclusion and a number of known papers were not identified by this approach. This was due to relying on authors mentioning the extreme water-related weather event in either the title, abstract or key words to enable them to be identified by the search strategy. Papers without abstracts or key words may not have been identified on the basis of their title alone, for example, the article by Walzer et al. on the balantidiasis outbreak in Truk following a typhoon [16] . Papers where the event was only mentioned as a detail in the full text and not in the title, key words or abstract may also have been missed. We therefore suggest that future reviews take a more comprehensive approach. It was also very difficult to make comparisons between outbreaks following different types of extreme events as there were vast differences in key characteristics of the populations affected. Where reported, there was also substantial variation in case definitions between outbreaks identified ; accounts based on self-reported cases had a substantially higher mean number of cases than those requiring a clinical diagnosis or laboratory confirmation and those that did not report the type of case definition used at all had, on average, the largest number of cases. Calculation of attack rate is also likely to have varied by study. The review also suffered from a lack of reporting of detail. For example, it was difficult to assess the evidence supporting the classification of the outbreaks as waterborne or the degree of association between water and disease given the limited amount of information often provided, particularly in the ProMED reports. For example, where testing of the water supply was reported, the causal pathogen was identified in just over half of the outbreaks. A quarter of those which provided the number of cases seen did not report the type of case definition used, i.e. whether they were laboratory-confirmed, clinically diagnosed, or self-reported cases. Details of the extreme water-related weather events thought to be involved in the outbreaks, such as the amount of precipitation seen or parameters such as water temperature, pH and level of turbidity, were rarely given. This severely limits the suitability of the results for extrapolation to different circumstances and geographical locations. Such were the quality of the literature identified, the majority of the data were classed only as providing 'strong circumstantial evidence but in need of careful interpretation ' and few of the publications described a comparison group. The limited reporting of many of the included studies also prevented many in-depth conclusions being drawn.",

Risk of diarrhoeal disease outbreaks following natural disasters has previously been found to be higher in developing countries than in industrialized countries [17] . Flooding events, for example, in high-income countries are rarely thought to result in epidemics of infectious disease or, where they do occur, they are thought to often be easily controlled and not widespread due to the rapid implementation of preventative measures [18, 19] . The scientific literature is also likely to be dominated by accounts of waterborne disease from higher-income countries, with greater academic and surveillance capacity. The amount and type of literature published on an extreme weather event, therefore, may not be proportionate to the size and impact of the event. Risk of publication bias was addressed, to some extent, by searching grey literature and by comparisons with the ProMED reports. However, ProMED is a passive reporting tool and there may also be discrepancies in reporting practices. Griffith et al. [20] found, for example, that outbreaks of cholera in Africa were more likely to be reported in areas of international interest and where there were fewer commercial consequences.",

Less developed countries may be at greater risk due to both higher sensitivity and lower adaptive capacity [21] . Non-climate stressors such as poverty or conflict can increase vulnerability by reducing resilience and adaptive capacity due to competing resource needs [17] . Less developed countries are therefore thought to be more vulnerable and less able to recover rapidly or effectively. Climate change is predicted to increase the burden of diarrhoeal disease in low-income regions by about 2-5 % by 2020, while countries with an annual GDP per capita of oUS$6000 are thought to be at no additional risk [21] . However, responses to recent extreme weather events suggest higher levels of vulnerability in both developing and developed countries than thought previously [2] . This review found that in both developing and developed countries the most common cause of outbreaks following extreme water-related weather events was contamination of the water source through run-off or inundation. While in developing countries this was usually untreated water, in developed countries, in the majority of cases, this was contamination of a treated water source. This suggests that even in developed countries the water supply system is not immune to the effects of such events. Although well-managed public water supply systems are expected to be able to cope with weather extremes, such extremes can cause both physical and managerial stresses which may impact water quality [21] . For example, rainstorm events and following increases in natural organic matter have been shown to significantly impair turbidity removal at water treatment works in England [22] . Similarly, the dry summer of 2003 and resulting low river flows were shown to cause deterioration in water quality in The Netherlands [23] . Public health practitioners and water companies should be aware of the risks of waterborne disease outbreaks following these events. Addressing the infectious waterborne disease consequences of climate change is likely to require specific engineering solutions to protect potable water.",

Flooding may have resulted from heavy rainfall in many cases and many of the other extreme water-related weather events may have involved heavy rainfall even if it was not specified in the paper or report. Authors may have focused only on the causal event and not its climatic effects. Whereas much has been published on the health impacts of flooding [24] [25] [26] , there is less on the impact of heavy rainfall which did not result in flooding, even though the latter may still result in pressure on the water supply. Studies have linked waterborne disease with heavy rainfall in several countries [27] [28] [29] . Curriero et al. [27] reviewed 548 disease outbreaks between 1948 and 1994 in the USA and found a significant association between rainfall and illness ; 68% of the events were found to be preceded by precipitation events above the 80th percentile. While Thomas et al. [30] found that from 1975 to 2000 in Canada rainfall events over the 93rd percentile increased the risk of a waterborne disease outbreak by a factor of 2 . 3. In light of the expected increases in frequency of heavy rainfall events in many regions, it is important to assess the individual impact of such events in local and regional areas and incorporate these into health and infrastructure policy.",

Risk of seawater inundation is expected to increase over the next few decades, due to predicted sea level rise and increasing frequency of extreme weather events, with the risk zone predicted to spread further inland and higher [31] . ENSO is known to be linked with extreme water temperature change. Two of the four accounts of outbreaks (both of which were cholera) following an ENSO event in the scientific literature were also linked to an extreme water temperature change. Studies have repeatedly linked ENSO events and extreme water temperature change to large-scale V. cholerae outbreaks [32, 33] and V. cholerae is known to show an increased growth rate at increased temperatures, with increasing global temperatures also expected to increase prevalence both geographically and temporally [34] . V. cholerae was by far the most common pathogen implicated in outbreaks following extreme water-related weather events, from both the scientific literature and ProMED, which may in part reflect the predominance of outbreaks following heavy rainfall and flooding. In a review of ProMED cholera outbreak reports from 1995 to 2005, Griffith et al. [20] found that rainfall and flooding were the most common risk factors globally (constituting 25% of all risk factors), alongside water source contamination (29 %) and refugee settings (13 %). The number of cholera outbreaks reported following extreme water-related weather events may also be attributable to a number of other factors such as the severity of the disease or reporting bias. When assessing the risk to public health of such outbreaks it is important to incorporate information not only from the most likely extreme water-related weather events (such as heavy rainfall and flooding), but also those from lower-probability but higher consequence events (such as ENSO or seawater inundation) [21] .",

There is also evidence to show that human and social capital are key determinants of adaptive capacity at all scales [21] . Adaptive capacity is uneven both between and within societies. For example, following weather-related disasters there is a differential impact on deaths and well-being by gender, while children and the elderly, who are more likely to be based in and around the home, are more likely to be affected by flooding events with a rapid onset [35] . Indigenous populations are also likely to be greatly impacted due to their occupation of economically and politically marginal areas and fragile ecosystems [36] . Such variability needs to be incorporated into the development of any policies or interventions to improve adaptive capacity. There is evidence to suggest that individual weather-related extreme events can facilitate adaptations such as policy and regulatory change, as immediately afterwards the policy climate may be more conducive to change [37] . Yet pressure for a quick recovery and short-term risk reduction can actually result in greater vulnerability to future events [38, 39] .
