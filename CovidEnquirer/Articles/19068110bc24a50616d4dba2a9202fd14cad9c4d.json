This modification generates an N-terminal threonine nucleophile that is used to hydrolyze the pantetheinyl moiety of its natural substrate. We determined the crystal structure of autoactivated ThnT to 1.8 \u00c5 through X-ray crystallography. Comparison to a mutationally inactivated precursor structure revealed several large conformational rearrangements near the active site. To probe the relevance of these transitions, we designed a pantetheine-like chloromethyl ketone inactivator and co-crystallized it with ThnT. Although this class of inhibitor has been in use for several decades, the mode of inactivation had not been determined for an enzyme that uses an N-terminal nucleophile. The co-crystal structure revealed the chloromethyl ketone bound to the N-terminal nucleophile of ThnT through an ether linkage, and analysis suggests inactivation through a direct displacement mechanism. More importantly, this inactivated complex shows that three regions of ThnT that are critical to the formation of the substrate binding pocket undergo rearrangement upon autoproteolysis. Comparison of ThnT with other autoproteolytic enzymes of disparate evolutionary lineage revealed a high degree of similarity within the proenzyme active site, reflecting shared chemical constraints. However, after autoproteolysis, many enzymes, like ThnT, are observed to rearrange in order to accommodate their specific substrate. We propose that this is a general phenomenon, whereby autoprocessing systems with shared chemistry may possess similar structural features that dissipate upon rearrangement into a mature state.",

            "text": "Autoproteolytic proteins pose unique challenges to understanding structure-function relationships because their cleavage is an intrinsic consequence of folding. This post-translational modification is involved in the regulation of protein folding, 1 cell signaling, 2 nucleoporin biogenesis, 3 apoptosis, 4 and the function of many enzymes. [5] [6] [7] These studies have established that self-cleavage proceeds through an N-O(S) acyl shift mechanism: an active-site nucleophile (Thr, Ser, or Cys) attacks into its N-terminal peptide bond generating a (thia)oxazolidine intermediate (Fig. 1a) . 8 This transient species collapses to a (thio)ester, which is subsequently hydrolyzed to yield two subunits bearing new N-and C-termini. The N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn) generated by autoproteolysis is used by enzymes, such as the Thr-utilizing proteasome \u03b2-subunit (P\u03b2S), 9 in a catalytic diad (or triad) for catalysis. It was originally believed that all Ntn-utilizing enzymes belonged to the same superfamily (dubbed the Ntn superfamily). 5, 10 However, subsequent research showed that a second group of enzymes exists (the D/O superfamily), which is related to the Ntn superfamily through convergent evolution. 11 Together, these enzymes perform a diverse array of hydrolysis and acyl transfer reactions.",

            "text": "We recently reported use of the pantetheinyl hydrolase ThnT (Fig. 1b) , a D/O enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of the potent \u03b2-lactam antibiotic thienamycin, 12 as a model system with which to study autoproteolysis. 13 Our analysis showed that a local conformational rearrangement is necessary for autoactivation and indicated that the majority of reported uncleaved structures from the Ntn superfamily do not, in fact, represent a cleavagecompetent state. Consequently, a comparison between the functional active site before and after autoactivation is possible for only two systems, glycosylasparaginase 14, 15 (GA) and P\u03b2S. 9, 16 This lack of mechanistically relevant structural information constitutes a fundamental gap in our understanding of how a single protein sequence is optimized to facilitate both autoproteolysis and enzymatic catalysis in its mature form. Because cephalosporin acylase (CA) and penicillin acylase, both members of the Ntn superfamily, are currently the subject of directed evolution experiments to improve the industrial production of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, 17, 18 further insights may provide valuable lessons in the development of enzymes with improved activity. Addressing this problem will rely on the ability to compare and contrast structural changes upon autoactivation for both Ntn and D/O superfamilies. To this end, we The activated residue attacks into its N-terminal amide bond, resulting in a (thia)oxazolidine ring that collapses to a (thio)ester with concomitant protonation of the amine leaving group by a general acid (AH). The \u03b1-amine activates a water molecule for hydrolysis of the (thio)ester, creating a new N-terminal residue. (b) Mechanism of ThnT hydrolysis of a pantetheinylated carbapenem. The N-terminal amine acts as a general base to activate the nucleophile for attack into the carbonyl of the pantetheine side chain. The \u03b1-ammonium donates a proton back to the amine leaving group, generating an acyl-enzyme intermediate. In a manner directly comparable to autoactivation, the \u03b1-amine again activates a water molecule to hydrolyze the substrate from the enzyme, returning it to its resting state. This hydrolytic chemistry is standard among Ntn-utilizing enzymes. sought to extend our analysis of ThnT by determining the mature structure of the enzyme and elucidating the features necessary for substrate binding and catalysis.",

These residues correctly orient the nitrogen lone pair to accept a proton from the nucleophile (Fig. 2b) .

Hence, it is now possible to distinguish between system-specific features and general features of their active sites. The catalytic activity of P\u03b2S relies on a hydrogen bond network very similar to that shown in Fig. 2b . However, the active site of each protein is formed from different parts of their topologically distinct folds (Fig. 4) , reinforcing their relationship through convergent evolution. Consequently, it appears that this hydrogen bond network represents an optimal balance between facile autoactivation and substrate catalysis. We recently reported that the Thr \u03b3-methyl may accelerate the intramolecular cyclization that occurs during the N-O acyl shift in autoproteolysis. 13 This phenomenon is known as the RRE (Reactive Rotamer Effect), 25 and a similar effect may apply to any reaction for which the rotamer distribution may be shifted to favor the reactive state by the addition of steric bulk. This is precisely the case for ThnT and P\u03b2S, where the inactive g+ rotamer is structurally viable for both Thr and Ser but is destabilized by Thr because the \u03b3-methyl shields a hydrogen bond with Gly322 (in ThnT) or Lys33 (in P\u03b2S). 9 Similarly, the g+ rotamer cannot be formed for the ornithine acyltransferases (members of the D/O superfamily) because it would cause a strong 1.7-\u00c5 steric clash with the Thr111 in the oxyanion hole. 26 Hence, comparison of ThnT with P\u03b2S and other Ntn enzymes reveals unique features of each active site that promote formation of a reactive state. Combined with the role of the RRE in autoproteolysis, we believe that these effects strongly and specifically contribute to the selection of Thr nucleophiles in autoproteolytic systems.",

Interestingly, prolonged incubation of ThnT resulted in further proteolysis of the \u03b1-subunit (Fig. S1 ). This raised the possibility that a secondary cleavage, similar to that observed for CA, 27 might also occur for ThnT. The slow timescale of the apparent hydrolysis, however, suggested that the phenomenon could be due to a contaminating protease. Although inclusion of protease inhibitors failed to prevent this cleavage, N-terminal sequencing showed that hydrolysis occurred two residues prior to the first observed residue in the crystal structure.

            "text": "The halomethyl ketones (HMKs) are a potent class of inactivators that have been used to covalently inhibit both serine and cysteine proteases. In the case of Ser proteases, both the catalytic nucleophile and histidine of the catalytic triad can be alkylated by HMKs. 28 Alternatively, inhibition of Cys proteases results in alkylation of only the thiol, implying inhibition through a different mechanism. 29 Although HMKs have been reported to inactivate the P\u03b2S, 30 the mode and mechanism of inhibition have not been reported for a Thr protease. Hence, development of an HMK inhibitor of ThnT could simultaneously answer the long-standing question concerning the mode of attachment of HMKs to this class of enzyme while providing detailed information about the substrate binding interactions of ThnT. To this end, we used D-pantothenic acid as the starting material in a four-step synthesis of the chloromethyl ketone (CMK) derivative N-(4-chloro-3-oxobutyl)pantoamide (Fig. 5a) through a diazomethyl ketone intermediate (Scheme S1, see Supplemental Information for details of the synthesis). Incubation of the CMK pantoamide inhibitor with ThnT caused complete loss of pantethine hydrolysis activity, as measured by a qualitative TLC (thinlayer chromatography) assay. We also tested the effect of the CMK pantoamide on the secondary cleavage events of ThnT and observed no changes (Fig. S1) , excluding the possibility that they are caused by ThnT performing low-efficiency intermolecular proteolysis.",

For the Ser proteases, the nucleophile attacks into the carbonyl forming an oxyanion that displaces the adjacent halide forming an oxirane intermediate. This three-membered ring is subsequently opened by attack of the His residue of the catalytic triad, resulting in a second covalent attachment. 31 Were a comparable mechanism involving an oxirane to occur in the inactivation of ThnT, its formation would obey the well-known stereoelectronic requirement that attack of the oxyanion into C\u2032 proceeds anti-periplanar to the chloride leaving group (Fig. 6b) . The location of the oxyanion is well defined by the location of the oxyanion hole of ThnT. Modeling this species shows that placement of the chloride anti-periplanar to the oxyanion results in a strong steric clash with Ser320 and the carboxylate of Asp321. Because this geometry is intrinsic to oxirane formation, and the ThnT active site harbors features that would significantly impede expulsion of the chloride, we do not believe that inactivation of ThnT occurs through an oxirane intermediate. Instead, the ether linkage reported here is most similar to the thioether formed upon derivatization of the cysteine proteases papain, 32 SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus) peptidase, 33, 34 and hepatitis A viral 3C. 29 For the latter two enzymes, an episulfonium species was also trapped, presumably as an intermediate of the inhibition process. A comparable mechanism for ThnT would involve a highly unstable oxonium species that is unlikely to occur (Fig. 6c) . Together, these constraints suggest that the mechanism of HMK inhibition in ThnT is distinct from those reported for the serine and cysteine proteases.",

Formation of the Michaelis complex places the carbonyl of the scissile amide into the oxyanion hole (Fig. 7) . The majority of the enzyme-substrate interactions are in the pantothenate binding region defined by the ThnTinhibitor structure (Fig. 5b) , consistent with the capacity of ThnT to efficiently hydrolyze a variety of pantetheinylated compounds. 12 The cysteamine moiety of the substrate provides the ideal distance for the carboxylate of thienamycin to form a salt bridge with Arg148. The catalytic nucleophile is centered within the active site, and its exposure to solvent is minimized by Phe144 and Phe348 from the opposite subunit. Like other N-terminal amidohydrolases, 5,38 the \u03b1-amine deprotonates the hydroxyl of Thr282 to generate a reactive nucleophile. Attack into the substrate generates a tetrahedral intermediate whose collapse is concurrent with protonation of the amine leaving group. Studies have shown that amidohydrolases often provide a hydrogen bond acceptor to facilitate inversion of the nitrogen, 39 and we hypothesize that Ser320 may satisfy this role for ThnT (Fig.  S2) . Expulsion of the amino leaving group generates thienamycin and an acyl-enzyme intermediate. A water molecule in a position similar to Wat1 or Wat2 (Fig. 2b) is then activated by the \u03b1-amine, which hydrolyzes the acyl-enzyme intermediate, regenerating the ThnT active site.",

In all systems, dissociation of the nascent C-terminus after autoproteolysis is favored by a lack of tertiary contacts. When autoproteolysis is initiated through a si-face attack, the same oxyanion hole is used for both self-cleavage and substrate catalysis. Within the active site, the Thr \u03b3-methyl facilitates this chemistry by directing the nucleophile into a reactive state. Lastly, we identified large structural rearrangements necessary for the formation of the ThnT substrate binding pocket. Although P\u03b2S is \"insignificantly different\" 16 before and after autoproteolysis, most other enzymes from the Ntn superfamily (including penicillin acylase, 40 CA, 41 and \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase 20 ) show evidence of a unique conformational rearrangement. These enzymes each contain a high degree of similarity with the ThnT proenzyme active site but are structurally divergent after autoproteolysis. We propose that this is evidence of a more general phenomenon. Autoprocessing systems with shared chemistry, regardless of lineage, will have comparable features prior to autoprocessing that may dissipate as each protein rearranges to its unique mature state. The observation that two markedly different conformations of the Arg74-Thr80 loop of ThnT (Fig. 3b) facilitate each of the hydrolytic chemistries highlights the orchestrated complexity of the structure-function relationship in autoproteolytic enzymes. Not only does sequence encode for an intrinsically reactive folded state but also, as we have shown here for ThnT, the downstream consequences of this self-cleavage result in spontaneous reorganization to the catalytically competent state of the mature enzyme.",

The ThnTinactivator complex was prepared by adding a 10-fold molar excess of the inactivator and incubating it at 20\u00b0C for 1 h immediately prior to use in crystallization attempts. Crystals were grown by sitting-drop vapor diffusion against a 1-mL reservoir solution of 14-18 % polyethylene glycol 3350 and 0.5-0.7 M sodium acetate. Crystals grew overnight and were cryoprotected by immersion into 20% polyethylene glycol 3350, 0.7 M sodium acetate, and 20% glycerol prior to flash freezing in N 2 . Crystallization and data collection for ThnT were carried out at X6A at the National Synchrotron Light Source. Data for the ThnT-inhibitor complex were collected on BL12-2 at the Stanford Synchrotron Light Source. Both structures were solved by molecular replacement using the Phaser program, 42 as implemented in the CCP4 package. 43 The structure of the uncleaved T282C variant of ThnT [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID: 3S3U], with dual occupancies removed, was used as the search model. Iterative rounds of model building were performed in Coot, 44 using REFMAC5 for refinement. 45 After the protein and solvent atoms were defined, TLS operators were added and further refined in REFMAC5, which yielded significant improvements in R free for both models. 45, 46 Crystallographic and refinement statistics are listed in Table 1 . Coordinates were deposited to the PDB with accession numbers 3TM1 (wt-ThnT) and 3TM2 (inactivated complex).",

Samples were withdrawn every 12 h for SDS-PAGE analysis and, at 12 h and 48 h, to assay for pantethine hydrolysis activity. Samples were run on 15% SDS-PAGE for 1 h and visualized with Coomassie Blue staining (Fig. S1 ). Aliquots containing the \u03b1-subunit degradation products were rerun on 15% SDS-PAGE for 3 h and electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. The smallest \u03b1-subunit was sent to the Johns Hopkins Medical Institute Synthesis and Sequencing Facility for N-terminal sequencing. ThnT pantethine hydrolysis activity was monitored by incubation with 10 mM pantethine for 1 h followed by spotting on a TLC plate. Samples without inhibitor present turned purple upon addition of Ninhydrin reagent, consistent with hydrolysis of the pantetheine moiety, whereas those with the CMK pantoamide did not stain.",

The carbapenem substrate and covalent intermediates were generated with the structure drawing functionality of Discovery Studio 2.1 and manually docked in the active site of ThnT. Generally, the system was typed with the CHARMM force field and minimized using an adopted basis NR algorithm. 47 Crystallographic waters were explicitly included in all minimizations. Attempts to position the substrate or inhibitor in an orientation substantially different from the observed conformation (e.g., placing the chlorine atom inside the oxyanion hole) resulted in significant activesite distortion. All rotamers of the CMK C\u2032-Cl bond were independently minimized before and after oxyanion formation in order to assess the capacity of ThnT to accommodate reactive intermediates. All hydrogen bonding interactions defined by the inhibitor-bound structure were constrained to \u00b10.2 \u00c5 of their measured values. The algorithm exited after achieving a root-meansquared gradient of b 0.1 kcal/(mol \u00c5). All other settings were default.",

This parallels the accepted mechanism of inhibition for traditional Ser proteases, where the imidazole side chain of the catalytic triad subsequently attacks C\u2032 forming a second covalent bond to the inhibitor. Both formation of the oxirane and its collapse to an ether are unlikely to occur within the ThnT active site.
