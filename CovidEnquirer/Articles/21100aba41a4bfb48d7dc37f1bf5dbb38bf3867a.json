However, there are currently no effective drugs targeting 2019-nCoV. Drug repurposing, represented as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery. In this study, we present an integrative, antiviral drug repurposing methodology implementing a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform, quantifying the interplay between the HCoV-host interactome and drug targets in the human protein-protein interaction network. Phylogenetic analyses of 15 HCoV whole genomes reveal that 2019-nCoV has the highest nucleotide sequence identity with SARS-CoV (79.7%) among the six other known pathogenic HCoVs. Specifically, the envelope and nucleocapsid proteins of 2019-nCoV are two evolutionarily conserved regions, having the sequence identities of 96% and 89.6%, respectively, compared to SARS-CoV.",

For example, 8,098 individuals were infected and 774 died in the SARS-CoV pandemic, which cost the global economy with an estimated $30 to $100 billion [3, 4] . According to the World Health Organization (WHO), as of November 2019, MERS-CoV has had a total of 2,494 diagnosed cases causing 858 deaths, the majority in Saudi Arabia [2] . In December 2019, the third pathogenic HCoV, named 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), was found in Wuhan, China. As of February 02, 2020, there have been over 14,000 cases with ~300 deaths for the 2019-nCoV pandemic (https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html); furthermore, human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts [5] .

A recent study estimated that pharmaceutical companies spent $2.6 billion in 2015, up from $802 million in 2003, in the development of an FDA-approved new chemical entity drug [7] . Drug repurposing, represented as an effective drug discovery strategy from existing drugs, could significantly shorten the time and reduce the cost compared to de novo drug discovery and randomized clinical trials [8] [9] [10] . However, experimental approaches for drug repurposing is costly and timeconsuming. [11] Computational approaches offer novel testable hypotheses for systematic drug repositioning [8-10, 12, 13] . However, traditional structure-based methods are limited when three-dimensional (3D) structures of proteins are unavailable, which, unfortunately, is the case for the majority of human and viral targets. In addition, targeting single virus proteins often have high risk of drug resistance by the rapid evolution of virus genomes [1] .",

For example, network-based drug-disease proximity that sheds light on the relationship between drugs (e.g., drug targets) and disease modules (molecular determinants in disease pathobiology modules within the PPIs), and can serve as a useful tool for efficient screening of potentially new indications for approved drugs, as well as drug combinations, as demonstrated in our recent studies [12, 22, 25] .",

We constructed a drug-target network by assembling target information for more than 2,000 FDA-approved or experimental drugs (see Methods). To improve the quality and completeness of the human protein interactome network, we integrated PPIs with five types of experimental data: (1) binary PPIs from 3D protein structures; (2) binary PPIs from unbiased high-throughput yeast-two-hybrid assays; (3) experimentally identified kinase-substrate interactions; (4) signaling networks derived from experimental data; and (5) literature-derived PPIs with various experimental evidences (see Methods). We used a Z-score (Z) measure and permutation test to reduce the study bias in network proximity analyses (including hub nodes in the human interactome network by literaturederived PPI data bias) as described in our recent studies [12, 25] .",

Additionally, we downloaded the expression data of drug-treated human cell lines from the Connectivity Map (CMAP) database [33] to obtain drug-gene signatures. We calculated a GSEA score (see Methods) for each drug and used this score as an indication of bioinformatics validation of the 135 drugs. Specifically, an enrichment score (ES) was calculated for each HCoV data set, and ES > 0 and P < 0.05 (permutation test) was used as cut-off for a significant association of gene signatures between a drug and a specific HCoV. The GSEA score, ranging from 0 to 3, is the number of data sets that met these criteria for a specific drug. Mesalazine (an approved drug for inflammatory bowel disease), sirolimus (an approved immunosuppressive drug), and equilin (an approved agonist of the estrogen receptor for menopausal symptoms) achieved the highest GSEA scores of 3, followed by paroxetine and melatonin with GSEA scores of 2. We next selected 16 potential repurposable drugs ( Figure 5A and Table 1 ) against HCoVs using subject matter expertise based on a combination of factors: (i) strength of the network-predicted associations (a smaller network proximity score in Supplementary Table S4 ); (ii) validation by GSEA analyses;",

Here, network proximity analysis shows a significant association between Irbesartan's targets and HCoV-associated host proteins in the human interactome. As shown in Figure 5C , irbesartan targets SLC10A1, encoding the sodium/bile acid cotransporter (NTCP) protein that has been identified as a functional preS1-specific receptor for the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and the hepatitis delta virus (HDV). Irbesartan can inhibit NTCP, thus inhibiting viral entry [42, 43] . SLC10A1 interacts with C11orf74, a potential transcriptional repressor that interacts with nsp-10 of SARS-CoV [44] . There are several other ARBs (such as eletriptan, frovatriptan, and zolmitriptan) in which their targets are potentially associated with HCoV-associated host proteins in the human interactome.",

As a biogenic amine, melatonin (N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine) (Z = -1.72 and GSEA score = 2) plays a key role in various biological processes, and offers a potential strategy in the management of viral infections [55, 56] . Viral infections are often associated with immune-inflammatory injury, in which the level of oxidative stress increases significantly and leaves negative effects on multiple organ functions [57] . The antioxidant effect of melatonin makes it a putative candidate drug to relieve patients' clinical symptoms in antiviral treatment, even though melatonin cannot eradicate or even curb the viral replication or transcription [58, 59] . In addition, the application of melatonin may prolong patients' survival time, which may provide a chance for patients' immune systems to recover and eventually eradicate the virus. As shown in Figure 5E , melatonin indirectly targets several HCoV cellular targets, including ACE2, BCL2L1, JUN, and IKBKB. Eplerenone (Z = -1.59), an aldosterone receptor antagonist, is reported to have a similar anti-inflammatory effect as melatonin. By inhibiting mast-cellderived proteinases and suppressing fibrosis, eplerenone can improve survival of mice infected with encephalomyocarditis virus [60] .",

Emodin, an anthraquinone derivative extracted from the roots of rheum tanguticum, have been reported to have various anti-virus effects. Specifically, emdoin inhibited SARS-CoV associated 3a protein [66] , and blocked an interaction between the SARS-CoV spike protein and ACE2 [67] . Altogether, network analyses and published experimental data suggested that combining toremifene and emdoin offered a potential therapeutic approach for HCoVs ( Figure 6C ). Figure 5A , targets of both mercaptopurine and melatonin showed strong network proximity with HCoV-associated host proteins in the human interactome network. Recent in vitro and in vivo studies identified mercaptopurine as a selective inhibitor of both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV by targeting papain-like protease [50, 51] . Melatonin was reported in potential treatment of .

In addition, the collected virus-host interactions are far from complete and the quality can be influenced by multiple factors, including different experimental assays and human cell line models. We may computationally predict a new virus-host interactome for HCoVs using sequence-based and structure-based approaches [70] . The current systems pharmacology model cannot separate therapeutic antiviral effects from those predictions due to lack of detailed pharmacological effects of drug targets and unknown functional consequences of virushost interactions. Drug targets representing nodes within cellular networks are often intrinsically coupled with both therapeutic and adverse profiles [71] , as drugs can inhibit or activate protein functions (including antagonists versus agonists). Comprehensive identification of the virus-host interactome for 2019-nCoV, with specific biological effects using functional genomics assays [72, 73] , will significantly improve the accuracy of current network-based methodologies.",

Our approach can minimize the translational gap between preclinical testing results and clinical outcomes, which is a significant problem in the rapid development of efficient treatment strategies for the emerging 2019-nCoV outbreak. From a translational perspective, if broadly applied, the network tools developed here could help develop effective treatment strategies for other types of virus and human diseases as well.",

Our network-based methodology combines a systems pharmacology-based network medicine platform that quantifies the interplay between the virus-host interactome and drug targets in the human PPI network. (A) Human coronavirus (HCoV) associated host proteins were collected from literatures and pooled to generate a pan-HCoV protein subnetwork. (B) Network proximity between drug targets and HCoV-associated proteins was calculated to screen for candidate repurposable drugs for HCoVs under the human protein interactome model. (C & D) Gene set enrichment analysis was utilized to validate the network-based prediction. (E) Top candidates were further prioritized for drug combinations using network-based method captured by the 'Complementary Exposure' pattern: the targets of the drugs both hit the HCoV-host subnetwork, but target separate neighborhoods in the human interactome network. (F) Overall hypothesis of network-based methodology: (i) the proteins that functionally associate with HCoVs are localized in the corresponding subnetwork within the comprehensive human interactome network; and (ii) proteins that serve as drug targets for a specific disease may also be suitable drug targets for potential antiviral infection owing to common protein-protein interactions elucidated by the human interactome.",
