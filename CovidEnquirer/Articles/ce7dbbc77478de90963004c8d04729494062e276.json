The definition of these variants calls and the failure of this technique to detect deletions, insertions, interspersed repeats and tandem repeats (repeats adjacent to each other like triplet repeats [15] ) may lead to inappropriate interpretation of the results and expensive follow up clinical and laboratory evaluation. For example, a clinically significant pathogenic variant reported in at least 3 unrelated cases with control data may be found in additional genome studies in other populations [16] to be a benign variant that is also found with a new variant which contains the mutation that leads to the most significant deleterious effect on gene function. The software application for variant significance assignment, like DataGenno [17] , will need to be up-to-date with the latest genotype/phenotype associations to prevent false positive findings and inappropriate follow-up testing.",

The annual incidence rate was 459 cases per 100,000 individuals. Comprehensive sequencing of numerous human cancers have revealed driver genes, 2 to 8 such genes per tumor, which alter intracellular signal transduction pathways related to the cells future death or survival and/or genome maintenance [19, 20] . There are at least 10 FDA approved cancer therapies based on the inhibition of these tumor-activated intracellular pathways [19] . For example, the BRAF kinase inhibitor, Vemurafenib, has shown a response rate in 50% of patients with metastatic melanoma that have the BRAF valine to glutamic acid mutation at codon 600 (V600E) [21] . This V600E mutation is associated with aggressive clinical course in patients with thyroid papillary microcarcinoma [22] . In one study of a hybrid score composed of one molecular diagnostic (V600E) and 3 histopathologic parameters were used to predict this tumor's clinical course with a sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 80% [22] .",

Pathogen identification has always relied on visual and biochemical interrogation where the summary of results may point to a specific identification (genus and species) or sometimes to at least the genus level. Visual and biochemical results can sometimes yield variable results meaning in some cases the ID may change depending on the result. The use of MALDI-TOF allows the clinical microbiology laboratory to identify bacteria once an isolate has been cultured potentially without performing any biochemical testing [11, 27, 28] . The implications are quicker pathogen identifications to clinicians and the potential to affect antibiotic treatment before susceptibility results are available. The ability to obtain a quicker answer will disrupt the testing workflow and require a re-evaluation of that workflow to optimize the use of MALDI-TOF and antibiotic susceptibility testing [11, 27, 28] .",

Those three procedures yield an annual cost savings of $46.1 million compared to the elimination of inappropriate Pap tests at an annual savings of $47.8 million. These figures illustrate the magnitude of healthcare savings by implementing simple laboratory test ordering practices which reduce duplication and/or inappropriate testing.

Indirectly assesses platelet function. It is performed by making a small incision on the skin and measuring, in seconds, the time taken for bleeding to stop. The test was designed to assess platelet function or exclude von Willebrand Disease. This test is labor intensive, invasive, poorly reproducible, and insensitive [36] . Historically it was performed because screening tests with a higher sensitivity for platelet dysfunction and von Willebrand disease (vWD) were unavailable. Bleeding time has been replaced by instrumentation that can assess platelet function in whole blood by aggregation studies [47, 48] . Available instrumentation includes the PFA-10 (Platelet Function Analyzer, Siemens USA), the VerifyNow (Accumetrics), the Plateletworks (Helena), the IMPACT (Diamed) and the thromboelastograph (TEG) (Haemonetics). Initial tests for a bleeding disorder rule out more common causes of bleeding. These tests include complete blood and platelet counts, PTT, PT, and possibly fibrinogen level or thrombin time. Additional tests for von Willebrand Disease (vWF: Antigen, ristocetin cofactor activity. Factor VIII clotting activity) can confirm the disease [48] .",

Overall, the sensitivity is essentially the same as that of a Gram-stained smear of a cyto-centrifuged CSF specimen [49, 50] . With the advent of vaccines to H. influenza type b and N. meningitides (A, C, Y, and W-135) the antigen testing is even less useful.

Because of the poor performance of the rapid antigen testing, CDC has recommended intrapartum chemoprophylaxis antibiotics be administered to women who have certain risk factors [51] . Our laboratory looked at internal data for our patient population and found the sensitivity of the rapid antigen test that was being used was 28%.

However, the WB is moving its way into obsolescence as newer generation antigen/antibody and molecular assays become part of the new HIV testing algorithms. HIV-1 WBs have always had issues with indeterminate results due to a myriad of factors (false positives and/or lack of specificity, kit design, etc.), which required either re-testing at a later time and/or molecular testing for HIV-1 nucleic acid [53] . The CDC/APHL, WHO, and France each have different interpretation criteria for defining a positive confirmatory result which indicates a lack of standardization for defining a patient as positive for HIV-1 [54] . The immune response to HIV-2 is well known to produce antibodies that cross react on the HIV-1 WB which could lead to a false positive HIV-1 result [54] . The lack of improvements or advancements of the WB compared to other antibody based assays has been nicely shown by Masciotra et al. [55] . They demonstrate that the rapid HIV tests actually detect HIV-1 antibodies several days earlier before the WB becomes positive [55] . The introduction of 4th generation antigen/antibody testing has allowed clinicians to detect reactive patients earlier in their disease course compared to 3rd generation testing effectively narrowing the window of serological detection by approximately 4-8 days [56] . Because of these new developments, CLSI and APHL have recommended new algorithms that incorporate antigen/antibody combination tests, rapid tests, and molecular testing [57, 58] . The WB should be a test that will be obsolete as laboratories adopt the newer algorithms for HIV testing.",

Therefore, PCR is not recommended as a first line test for making the initial diagnosis of Lyme disease. A review article showed that the median percent sensitivities of PCR testing from blood, skin biopsy, CSF, and synovial fluid are 10-48%, 64-76%, 23-73%, and 66-83%, respectively [67] . The current recommendation for diagnostic testing involves a two-tiered algorithmic approach involving antibody testing [68] .

This effort generates increased laboratory test utilization which should be monitored by average number of specific tests ordered per subspeciality physician per month ( [69] , Table 40 .10). The data is collected from patient requisitions that are processed each day in the accessioning area of the outreach specimen receiving area. The sales force will introduce outreach administration to the projected number of new client accounts to be opened each month. The impact of the laboratory can be estimated by multiplying the volume of a specific test per physician for an office practice of multiple physicians. These volumes will estimate the utilization of tests per laboratory section and predict the future need for additional analyzers and/or personnel to perform the laboratory test procedures as the outreach client number increase. Utilization data varies by medical subspeciality. For example, urology had 94 requisitions/physician, 1.4 procedures/requisition and 132 procedures/physician with the PSA being the highest test volume. Compare that to the nursing homes with 189 requisitions/physician, 3.6 procedures/requisition and 688 procedures/physician with electrolytes being the highest test volume [69] . This data is used primarily for planning the best strategies to absorb the increased workload new clients will bring to the outreach business. It can also be used to monitor the use of obsolete and inappropriate lab tests to develop educational efforts to improve test utilization practices by subspeciality among outreach clients.",
