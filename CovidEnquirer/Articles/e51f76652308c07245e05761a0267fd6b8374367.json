Then, different IBV variants have emerged causing other clinical manifestations named nephropathogenic and reproductive problems that require a dramatic change in vaccination programs (Cavanagh, 1997; Liu et al., 2003) . The IBV infections can also be further aggravated by the presence of bacterial infections such as Escherichia coli, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, Mycoplasma synoviae, and 50 Ornithobacterium rhinotracheale (Landman and Feberwee, 2004) .",

The virions are approximately 120 nm in diameter and contain clubshaped surface projection called spikes that are 20 nm in size (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008) . It is an enveloped positive-stranded RNA virus with a genome of about 27.6 kb in length encompassing 5 0 and 3 0 untranslated regions with a poly(A) tail. A major part of the genome is composed of two overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), 1a and 1b, which are translated into large polyproteins, 1a and 1ab, respectively, and contribute to the formation of the replication and transcription complex (Cavanagh., 1997; Khataby et al., 2016b) . The remaining part of the genome encodes for four structural proteins that are called the phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein (N), the membrane glycoprotein (M), the envelope protein (E), and the spike glycoprotein (S). Two accessory genes have been described, ORF3 and ORF5, which express accessory proteins, 3a and 3b and 5a and 5b, respectively (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997) . The spike glycoprotein of all coronaviruses contains four domains that are involved in the anchoring of the S protein into the lipid bilayer of the virion. The spike glycoprotein gene of IBV consists of 1162 amino acids and is cleaved into two subunits, S1 and S2, the N-terminal S1 subunit (535 amino acids) and the C-terminal S2 subunit (627 amino acids) (Cavanagh, 1997) .",

The IBV is identified and characterized by a large genetic and pathogenic variability. More than 50 different serotypes of IBV have been reported, and new variants continue to emerge (Bochkov et al., 2006) . The high variation in the nucleotide sequences of spike gene can change the protection ability of a vaccine or immunity (Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003) . Some reports have demonstrated that this genetic diversity, due to changed genomic virus by frequent point mutations and recombination events in the S1 gene, has given the emergence of new IBV variants that can be partially or poorly neutralized by existing vaccine serotypes (Khataby et al., 2016b) . Wherefore, the phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene is the most useful strategy to differentiate IBV genotypes and serotypes, because it correlates closely with the serotype and permits the selection of the appropriate vaccine serotypes for IB control in each of the geographic regions (Jackwood, 2012) .",

Another study conducted by Lee et al. in 2002 confirmed the epitheliotropic quality and broad tissue tropism of IBV strains, as the virus infects respiratory cells and spreads to other tissues with the appearance of viremia. However, the upper respiratory tract is still the main multiplication site of the IBV. The infected chicken shows a thickening of the mucus, with a serous catarrhal exudate in the nasal passages, sinus and trachea. The presence of nasal exudate is used to assess the severity of the disease in different inbred chicken lines.",

Callison et al. (2001) showed that a difference of one or two amino acids in the composition of the IBV S protein determined whether or not it was pathogenic. Similarly, Haijema showed that the inversion of the mouse protein hepatitis protein S gene with that of the cat's coronavirus allowed the creation of a replicationcapable virus in cat.

The IB disease is an acute, highly contagious viral infection of chickens of any age with adverse effects on egg quality and production and is characterized by high depression during the growth period, particularly in laying hens (Cavanagh, 1997) . Birds of all ages are likely to be infected with the virus, but sensitivity is greater in subjects less than 6 weeks old, often in favor of stress or immunosuppression. The morbidity is close to 100%, whereas the mortality is variable according to the tropism of the viral strain, low for strains with respiratory tropism and high for strains with renal tropism.
