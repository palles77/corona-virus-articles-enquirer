As indicated above, irradiation is an integral component in both generating autoimmune precursors and abolishing host resistance to adoptive transfer; other preparative regimens were the next tools in which to distinguish the individual characteristics inherent in each system using an experimental design similar to that described above for defining the radiation sensitivity. CY at all doses, 200, 100, 50, and 25 mg/kg, combined with a 30-d subsequent regimen ofCsA, was an ineffective preparative regimen for the primary induction ofSGVHD, as shown in Fig. 2 . However CY at a dose of 200 or 100 mg/kg given on the day before adoptive transfer resulted in a maximum incidence ofacute SGVHD clinically detectable by day 10. The severity as noted pathologically was a grade 2 acute SGVHD at a dose of 200 mg/kg and dropped to a grade 1 acute SGVHD at 100 mg/kg. These data suggest that the abolishing of host resistance to adoptive transfer of SGVHD is dependent on the dose of CY used . Table I demonstrates that a busulfan preparative regimen of 30 mg/kg on day -2 before bone marrow rescue and subsequent CsA therapy did not result in the induction of SGVHD: a low incidence ofSGVHD (one of eight rats) did occur with concomitant busulfan and CY therapy, but did so much later (day 28) compared with that observed (day 10-14) when irradiation (1,050 rad) was used as the ablative therapy. In the case of adoptively transferring SGVHD, one of seven rats treated with busulfan treatment alone had a clinical picture of acute SGVHD, which also occurred late. These studies suggest that the nature of the autoregulatory system is radiosensitive, CY sensitive, and relatively busulfan resistant.",

These data suggest that thymic irradiation is important for the abolition of host resistance mechanisms specific to this syndrome. The Characterization of theAutoregulatory Pbpulation by Adoptive Cotransfer Studies. The studies above provide evidence that there is a host resistance or autoregulatory system preventing the adoptive transfer of SGVHD. To document and characterize the autoregulatory cell, a series of adoptive cotransfer studies were performed. Two different doses of effector splenocytes from rats with SGVHD were compared since the potencies of a given effector population can not be predicted. The variables of time after CsA withdrawal, the timing and stage of disease manifestation, or inherent differences in the capability of a population to undergo clonal expansion can explain the varying potencies of effector cells. Both doses of effector splenocytes (15 and 30 x 106 ) were capable of establishing clinical and grade 2 histologic SGVHD in irradiated secondary recipients (Table II) . The transfer of spleen cells from reconstituted non-CsA-treated rats did not mediate disease (data not shown) . The cotransfer of 30 x 106 unfractionated lymphocytes from a normal rat prevented the establishment of SGVHD in recipients receiving 15 x 106 effector lymphocytes and reduced the clinical incidence of SGVHD in those receiving an equivalent dose of effector splenocytes . In both cases the cotransfer of normal unfractionated splenocytes downregulated the histologic severity of SGVHD from a grade 2 to a grade of 1 of the animals developing disease. If the cotransferred splenocytes were first fractionated over nylon wool and shown to be >85% OX19 + by FAGS analysis, then 30 x 106 nylon wool-nonadherent splenocytes were as or more effective than unfractionated splenocytes in reducing the incidence of SGVHD upon the cotransfer of an equivalent number of effector splenocytes (Table II, The cotransfer of effector splenocytes from autoimmune donors with fractionated and unfractionated splenocytes from a normal animal . Syngeneic marrow (60 x 10 6 cells) and effector splenocytes (15 x 106 cells in A, 30 x 106 cells in B, and 50 x 106 cells in C) were transfused into lethally irradiated recipients . In A and B, the secondary recipients received either no splenocytes (-), or 30 x 106 unfractionated splenocytes, or 30 x 106 nylon wool-nonadherent (NWNA) splenocytes from a normal animal. In C, the secondary recipients received either no splenocytes, 50 x 106 NWNA splenocytes, or 50 x 10 6 OX19-depleted NWNA splenocytes from a normal rat . no evidence of GVHD (Table 11 , group A) clinically or histologically. Hence nylon wool-nonadherent splenocytes appeared to be more effective in suppressing the transfer of disease than unfractionated splenocytes. Table II , group C, demonstrates that the depletion of nylon wool-nonadherent splenocytes of OX19 + lymphocytes removed the autoregulatory effect present in normal splenocytes. Depletion protocols both by panning and immunomagnetic separation resulted in a T cell-depleted population with <20% staining with W3/13 (another pan-specific T cell marker that has some crossreactivity with other cell types, i.e., polymorphs and stem cells [18] ). The transfer of 50 x 106 effector splenocytes elicited SGVHD in lethally irradiated secondary recipients : only the cotransfer of nylon wool-adherent splenocytes and not the OX19-depleted population prevented the transfer of disease.",

If CsA treatment was delayed until 7 d after transplantation, then only 30% of the rats developed SGVHD (Fig. 3) .

Ifeffector splenocytes were transferred between day 0 to 4 after transplantation, then all rats manifested severe GVHD usually between 14 to 21 d later. By day 7 after bone marrow transplantation, evidence of a resistance mechanism is clear, since 30% ofthe secondary recipients were now resistant to the transfer of SGVHD.

This autoaggression syndrome represents a disruption in the normal regeneration of a competent T cell repertoire concurrent with self-tolerance after syngeneic bone marrow transplantation. One ofthe primary mechanisms thought to account for SGVHD has been the generation of autoreactive cells recognizing self MHC antigens . Recent studies by Hess et al. (12) have shown that the development of SGVHD is associated with the induction of cytotoxic lymphocytes directed against a public epitope of class II antigens . The generation of \"self\" class II MHC antigen reactive cells appears to be directly related to the effect of CsA on thymic function (11, 19, 20) . Previous studies have shown that CsA therapy and irradiation abolishes thymic medullary epithelial cells and causes a reduction in class II antigen expression (11, 19) . These irreversible changes are thought to prevent the normal mechanisms of eliminating self-reactive clones . Thymic epithelial cells and dendritic cells are known to be crucial in the education ofself-MHC restriction and hence a microinductive environment for self-tolerance. Recent studies have shown that CsA can inhibit the intrathymic events inherent in clonal deletion, by potentially interfering with the T cell receptor signal transduction or reducing class II expression (20) . Nevertheless, even in the normal animal, the presence of autoreactive cells in the periphery is evidence of incomplete clonal deletion and implies control by a peripheral regulatory mechanism (21) . Therefore, this peripheral mechanism must be eliminated to allow development of SGVHD.",

First, the radiosensitivity of the host resistance mechanism is more sensitive than that of the inductive mechanism since low doses of irradiation allowed the adoptive transfer of SGVHD but were unable to permit the induction of SGVHD. Secondly, CY in a dose-dependent fashion eliminated host resistance mechanisms but was unable to trigger the events essential for induction of SGVHD. Although CY can inhibit peripheral regulatory mechanisms, it was surprisingly ineffective in inducing SGVHD, revealing a possible intrinsic difference between the roles of CY and irradiation in altering intrathymic events essential for disease manifestation. It can also be inferred that the elimination ofan autoregulatory mechanism is insufficient by itself for the induction of SGVHD.",

While normal nonirradiated rodents upon CsA therapy alone fail to manifest any clinical signs of SGVHD, lymphoid cells from these donors inflict severe autoaggression when transferred to a secondary, irradiated recipient (12) , implicating a putative autoregulatory mechanism in controlling the induction of SGVHD. Further evidence of an autoregulatory system is demonstrated in the adoptive cotransfer studies. Nylon wool-nonadherent T cells expressing the OX19 determinant, present on mature T lymphocytes, abrogated the transfer and establishment of SGVHD. For every effector splenocyte transferred two unfractionated splenocytes from normal donors were required for inhibition. This evidence demonstrates that an autoregulatory population is present in a normal animal and that the ratio between autosuppressors to autoreactive cells is critical in the inhibition ofSGVHD, consistent with the findings of Sorokin et al. (10) . Current studies are focused on the analysis of the actual T cell subsets involved .",

On the other hand, the ineffectiveness of effector splenocytes that are transferred 1 wk after transplantation to mediate SGVHD demonstrates that the autoregulatory arm is apparently reconstituted within the first week after bone marrow transplantation. Hence lethal irradiation may be critical for abolishing mature suppressor mechanisms present either in the thymus and/or in the periphery.

In fact autoreactive cells capable of mediating SGVHD can be detected in animals treated with CsA without demonstrating clinical disease when adoptively transferred into a lethally irradiated recipients (11) . The prevention of intrathymic clonal deletion and the perturbation of the autoregulatory cell regeneration in a reconstituting animal may be the determining factors in disease manifestation. Abolishment of autoregulation can be the putative event that creates a permissive environment for the expansion of autoreactive cells and the subsequent generation of autoimmune disease.
