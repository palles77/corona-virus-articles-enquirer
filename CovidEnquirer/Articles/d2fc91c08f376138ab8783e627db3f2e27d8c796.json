Public health measures at airports might protect passengers and employees from such diseases and delay spread into the general population. The SARS epidemic was contained largely through traditional public health interventions (1, 2) . These interventions included recommendations to postpone nonessential travel, provide public health information and face masks, screen passengers at entry or exit by questionnaire, measure ear temperatures, provide medical examinations, isolate case-patients, and quarantine contacts.",

Data were collected by a pretested, selfadministered, 23-item questionnaire (in English, French, and German), which was distributed to all adult passengers in the departure waiting areas.

The patient had stopped taking his doxycycline for antimalarial chemoprophylaxis 3 days before his admission. During those 3 days he began to experience myalgia, fatigue, nausea, and vomiting but no fever. He took no medication. He then became unable to move his lower legs and experienced paresthesia just before his condition rapidly deteriorated. He was found at home by the local Emergency Medical Service (EMS) in respiratory distress and shock and required immediate orotracheal intubation for mechanical ventilation. When admitted to the intensive care unit, he had severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (PO 2 / FiO 2 , 65 mm Hg; PCO 2 , 90 mm Hg; with positive end expiratory pressure of 12 cm H 2 O). Transthoracic echocardiography and pulmonary artery catheterization showed severe global hypokinesia with a left ventricular ejection fraction of <10%, right ventricular dilatation, and low pulmonary artery occlusion pressure. Blood tests showed disseminated intravascular coagulation with 30 \u00d7 10 9 /L platelets, an international normalized ratio of 3.54, an activated partial thromboplastin time >180 s, and D-dimers at 25.6 \u03bcg/mL. He had severe mixed acidosis (pH 6.9 and arterial lactate 4.2 mmol/L) and acute renal failure. Blood cultures were performed. A thin-blood fi lm showed Plasmodium spp. within the red blood cells (parasitemia 0.4%). Rapid fl uid resuscitation was carried out and epinephrine was given, along with intravenous quinine (1,000 mg over 4 h, then 1,500 mg/d) and broadspectrum antimicrobial drugs (cefotaxime and ofl oxacine).",
