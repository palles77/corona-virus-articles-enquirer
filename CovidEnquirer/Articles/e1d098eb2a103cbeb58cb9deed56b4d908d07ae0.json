The activity of the prodrugs was evaluated in vitro against different virus families. None of the synthesized prodrugs demonstrated activity against RNA viruses but some of them proved active against herpesviruses [including herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV)]. The bis(POC) and the bis(amino acid) phosphoramidate prodrugs of PMEO-DAPy inhibited herpesvirus replication at lower doses than the parent compound although the selectivity against HSV and VZV was only slightly improved compared to PMEO-DAPy. The mono-octadecyl ester of PME-5-azaC emerged as the most potent and selective PME-5-azaC prodrug against HSV, VZV and HCMV with EC 50 's of 0.15-1.12 mM while PME-5-azaC only had marginal anti-herpesvirus activity. Although the bis (hexadecylamido-L-tyrosyl) and the bis(POM) esters of PME-5-azaC were also very potent anti-herpesvirus drugs, these were less selective than the mono-octadecyl ester prodrug.",

[1] [2] [3] [4] Some of them have become already clinically available drugs: cidofovir for the treatment of human cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in AIDS patients, adefovir in a prodrug form as adefovir dipivoxil for the treatment of hepatitis B (HBV) and tenofovir, either as tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, or newly (since 2015) also as a new prodrug form tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) for the treatment of HIV and HBV infections. On the other hand, it should be noted that over the last thirty years of systematic investigation of ANPs, there are dozens of other therapeutically attractive structures synthesized but never advanced to the stage of preclinical/clinical investigations. 5 These structures are namely a) antiretroviral purine 3-fluoro-2-[(phosphonomethoxy)propyl] derivatives, 6 b) acyclic nucleoside phosphonates with 5-azacytosine base moiety, 7 c) 6-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)alkoxy]-2, 4-diaminopyrimidines (''open-ring'' derivatives) [8] [9] [10] and d) aza/deaza analogues of purine [(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl] derivatives. 11 The common structural attribute of all ANPs is their highly polar character caused by the presence of the phosphonic acid residue which is responsible for their unfavourable pharmacological properties: low cell permeability and low oral bioavailability. To overcome this problem, transformation of free acyclic nucleoside phosphonates to appropriate prodrugs is often a solution.",

They are evidently mimics of the appropriate 2,6-diaminopurine derivatives with an open imidazole ring. Their antiviral activity is essentially identical to that of their parent compounds, including the enantiomeric specificity. Compounds as PMEO-DAPy, (R)-PMPO-DAPy and 5substituted PMEO-DAPy ( Fig. 1 ) are very efficient inhibitors of retroviruses [8] [9] [10] and HBV. Despite the number of antiretroviral drugs currently available on the market, further investigation of new structures is advisable for several reasons: 1) the risk of emergence of resistance, 2) none of the known drugs is able to eradicate HIV infection completely, 3) no vaccination are yet available, 4) early development of new drug candidates is necessary due to the longtime process lasting from in vitro laboratory testing to clinical phases and final approval. Moreover, there is an additional reason to focus on open-ring analogs of the PMEO-DAPy type: they are incorporated more efficiently than (R)-PMPA (tenofovir) by the K65R HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) mutant and they are not as efficiently excised as (R)-PMPA by the HIV-1 RT containing thymidine analog mutations. 12 Additionally, PMEO-DAPy is active not only against retroviruses but also against DNA viruses, especially herpesviruses, which often affect immunocompromised patients, including those with HIV/AIDS.",

The prodrug hexadecyloxyethyl ester of its cyclic form (HDE-cHPMP-5-azaC) revealed the most potent anti-DNA virus activities and also the highest selectivity indices (ratio activity vs toxicity) in the order of thousands, e.g. 1160 for herpes simplex virus (HSV) ! 5800 for varicella zoster virus (VZV) and !24,600 for HCMV. 14 The only disadvantage of HPMP-5-azaC is its complicated metabolic profile bound to instability of the 5-azacytosine ring in alkaline conditions including physiological pH. Studying the stability of various 5-azacytosine ANPs, we found much better stability for another 5-azacytosine derivative, i.e. 1-[2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl]-5-azacytosine (PME-5-azaC). 15 Despite the fact that its antiviral activity was only marginal in the free phosphonic acid form 7 , we selected the compound for syntheses and further studies of its prodrug forms. We considered the fact that the activities of many ANPs were increased after transformation to appropriate prodrugs. Moreover, in some cases not only the activity was enhanced but also the spectrum of activity could be broaden by transformation to prodrugs. Typical examples are the anti-DNA viral agents 1-(S)-[3-hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]adenine (HPMPA) whose octadecyloxyethyl (ODE) ester is a potent and selective inhibitor of hepatitis C virus replication 16 or cidofovir transformed to its hexadecyloxyethyl ester (brincidofovir) whose efficacy is also enlarged to some RNA viral infections including Ebola virus. In fact, the lipid moiety of brincidofovir was found to be required for in vitro antiviral activity against Ebola virus. 17",

The synthesis of the prodrugs was rather complicated by a low solubility of the starting PMEO-DAPy; finally we managed to synthesize two biodegradable ester prodrugs -pivaloyloxymethyl (POM) and (isopropoxycarbonyl) oxymethyl (POC) esters and the amino acid phosphoramidate prodrug (Scheme 1). Pivaloyloxymethylation was performed by reaction of the starting phosphonic acid with chloromethyl pivalate using N,N 0 -dicyclohexyl-4-morpholinecarboxamidine as a base. The reaction proceeded very slowly to give a mixture of bis (POM) and mono(POM) esters 2 and 3. After chromatographic separation, both compounds were isolated in acceptable yields. Alternative reaction conditions (e.g. reaction in dioxane with DBU) completely failed. Also for the introduction of POC groups, different attempts have been examined (various solvents, DBU or diisopropylethylamine as bases). The only way that led to the bis (POC) derivative 4 consisted in transformation of free PMEO-DAPy to its tetrabutylammonium salt, followed by heating with POCchloride in dioxane. The bis(amino acid) phosphoramidate prodrug 5 was prepared by the direct coupling of PMEO-DAPy with ethyl Lalaninate in pyridine and treatment with a premixed solution of triphenylphosphine and 2,2 0 -dipyridyl disulfide (Aldrithiol).",

The principle of this method is the utilization of the intermediary bis(trimethylsilyl) ester of ANP directly for reaction with 2,2 0 dithiodipyridine, triphenylphosphine and amino acid ester to obtain bis-amidates without the need of laborious procedures to isolate the free phosphonic acids. The selection of amino acid esters is directed especially to diethyl esters of L-alanine or Lphenylalanine leading to prodrugs with optimal pharmacokinetic profile. 20 In our case, we selected the diethyl ester of L-phenylalanine (Scheme 3). Similarly as with the preparation of POM and POC esters, we obtained not only the desired symmetrical bis-amidate prodrug 12 but also mono-amidate 13 accompanied by a small amount of mono-methyl ester 14. Compound 14 was formed most probably during the chromatographic separation of the mono-amidate prodrug in a system containing high percentage of methanol.",

The most important compound of this family is the hexadecyloxypropyl ester of cidofovir (brincidofovir, CMX-001), currently in Phase III clinical trials for use in humans against HCMV and adenovirus infections. This compound is also being investigated as an experimental drug against smallpox and ebolavirus infections. 22 In our previous studies, we have successfully applied the alkoxyalkylester approach to 9-(S)-[3hydroxy-2-(phosphonomethoxy)propyl]-2,6-diaminopurine ((S)-HPMPDAP) 23 within the search for new bioavailable anti-poxvirus agents and for the synthesis of the above mentioned HDE-cHPMP-5-azaC (Fig. 2 ). 14 In our synthesis, the starting PME-azaC was transformed first to its tetrabutylammonium salt, which was subsequently treated with hexadecyloxypropyl bromide to give the mixture of diester and monoester (15, 17) .

This concept has been originally developed by McKenna's group to improve the oral bioavailability of (S)-HPMPC and (S)-HPMPA. 24, 25 Pharmacokinetic studies of various amino acid or dipeptide prodrugs of these ANPs finally revealed that the tyrosine single amino acid was the most favorable promoiety regarding prodrug plasma stability. It was also found that enzymatic stability of the tyrosine promoiety can be significantly increased by replacement of the carboxyl ester with an alkyl amide group. The highest increase in bioavailability and antiviral activity was observed when a long lipophilic alkyl chain was incorporated into the tyrosine amide group. A comprehensive review including synthesis, SAR studies and pharmacology of tyrosine N-alkyl amide ANP prodrugs has been published recently. 26 Considering these findings, we decided to synthesize the symmetrical bis-tyrosine prodrug 23 whose carboxylic function is modified by the hexadecylamido group (Scheme 5). The compound can be prepared via alkylation of the 5-azacytosine sodium salt with the whole aliphatic moiety, i.e. BOC protected bis(hexadecylamido-Ltyrosyl) ester of 2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl chloride (21) BOC groups. The tyrosine synthon 21 can be obtained by multistep synthesis from diisopropyl 2-(phosphonomethoxy)ethyl chloride (18) which is known as a common building block in the synthesis of diverse PME derivatives. 27 Isopropyl groups in 18 were removed first by the action of bromotrimethylsilane followed by hydrolysis. The intermediary phosphonic acid 19 was then activated by reaction with oxalyl chloride in DMF forming a phosphorodichlori-date 28 whose further reaction with BOC-protected hexadecyl tyrosine amide 20 in a presence of triethylamine formed diester 21 in good preparative yield. Tyrosine amide precursor 20 was prepared from N-BOC-L-tyrosine by standard coupling procedure using EDC and N-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt) in CH 2 Cl 2 (similarly as described for other alkylated L-tyrosine amides, e.g. octyl or octadecyl). 26 ",
