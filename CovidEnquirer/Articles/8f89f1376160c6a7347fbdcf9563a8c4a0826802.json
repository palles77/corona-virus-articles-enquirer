This test can be completed within 1 hour and is a sensitive method for detecting the presence of viral antigen. However, the performance of the test requires considerable technologic expertise, and commercially available reagents are quite variable in quality. Fluorescent antibody identification has been used regularly for the diagnosis of infections with HSV, varicella-zoster (VZV), respiratory syncytial (RSV), and rabies viruses. We have found that VZV, which grows slowly or not at all in tissue culture, can be readily detected in smears from skin lesions by a fluorescent antibody m e t h~d .~ In many laboratories direct FA is superior to culture for the diagnosis of VZV and RSV infections, because culture of these two viruses takes several days and may be falsely negative. Many viral antigens may also be detected by indirect fluorescent antibody techniques.

The major drawback of all SPIAs is that the quality of specimens such as respiratory, genital, or skin swabs cannot be assessed. This is in marked contrast to IF. Specific disadvantages of ELISAs include the variability of solid-phase carriers and the carcinogenicity of certain chromogenic substrates. RIAs require expensive equipment and also involve exposure to carcinogens. In addition, disposing of these hazardous materials poses considerable difficulty. Most SPIAs also require a day or overnight incubation with several washing procedures.

However, such apparently significant antibody titer rises may not always be significant. An example of this is the occasional rise of antibody to CMV in patients with influenza A or Mycoplasma pneumoniae infections, suggesting stress reactivation of CMV by the latter agents. False-positive serologic responses may also result from cross-reactions to related antigens; for example, an antibody rise to parainfluenza virus may actually result from infection with mumps virus. Also, anamnestic antibody responses may falsely suggest seroconversion or cause an apparent fourfold or greater rise in antibody titer. ;",

Many considerations, however, allow the clinician to select the most appropriate specimens. For example, during the summer, when enteroviral meningitis is prevalent, throat and stool specimens should certainly be submitted, in addition to CSF. On the other hand, the development of encephalitis in children after the acquisition of several mosquito bites in wooded areas endemic for California encephalitis virus suggests that a blood specimen for antibody testing would be optimal. Further examples include CNS disease following parotitis (urine and CSF specimens for mumps virus) or a focal encephalitis with a temporal lobe localization preceded by headaches and disorientation (brain biopsy for HSV).

Upper respiratory tract (or specimens obtained by traversing the upper airways), vaginal, and fecal cultures vary greatly in terms of their significance. At one extreme, isolates such as measles, mumps, influenza, parinfluenza, and RSV are very significant, because asymptomatic carriage and prolonged shedding of these viruses are unusual. Conversely, other viruses can be shed without symptoms and for periods ranging from several weeks (enteroviruses) to many months (adenoviruses, HSV, CMV). Examples include HSV and CMV in the oropharynx and vagina, adenoviruses in the oropharynx and intestinal tract and enteroviruses in the intestinal tract. VZV, HSV, CMV, adenoviruses, and EBV may remain latent for long periods and then become reactivated in response to a variety of stressful stimuli, including other infectious agents. In this setting, their detection may have no significance (VZV is an exception) or may merely represent a secondary problem complicating the primary infection (for example, HSV \"cold sores\" in patients with bacterial sepsis). Adenovirus isolates are common in infants and young children. Based on the epidemiology and observed serological responses, it has been found that. in febrile and res~iratorv svndromes, simultaneous isolation of these , , agents from both the throat and feces has greater probability of association with that illness; isolation from the throat, but not the feces, has a lesser probability of association, and isolation from the feces has the least diagnostic significance. In these latter situations, interpretation of the significance of the culture results can be aided by adenovirus serologic studies.",

A knowledge of the relative frequency of virus shedding among various age groups in a particular locale is extremely helpful in assessing significance of results of throat or stool cultures; for example, the peak prevalence of enteroviruses in the stools of toddlers during the late summer may range from greater than 20 per cent in subtropical climates to 5 per cent in temperate zones.",

Shedding of enteroviruses in the throat is relatively transient (usually 1 to 2 weeks), whereas fecal shedding may last 4 to 16 weeks. Thus, in a clinically compatible illness, isolation of an enterovirus from the throat supports a stronger temporal relationship to the disease than does an isolate from only the feces. When echovirus or coxsackievirus is recovered from the stool only, it may be helpful to study the patient's serum for an antibody rise against that particular viral isolate.",
