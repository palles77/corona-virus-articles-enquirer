Identification of a causative pathogen was higher post-vaccination (61%) than pre-vaccination (48.5%) (p50.019). Rates of bacterial infections were not different between post-and pre-vaccine studies (17.5% versus 24%, p50.258). Viral (31%) and mixed (12.5%) infections were found more often postvaccination (19.5%, p50.021) than pre-vaccination (5%, p50.015). Rates of identified pneumococcal infections were comparable between pre-and post-vaccine studies (14.7% versus 17.4%, p50.557). Diagnosis of pneumococcal infection post-vaccination improved when PCR was used compared to culture (21.6% versus 6%, p50.0004). Serotypes included in PCV13 but not PCV7 were identified in 75% (18 out of 24) post-vaccination.",

Studies of pneumonia frequently report low levels of pathogen identification, although improved knowledge of pneumonia aetiology is essential for the development of targeted management and effective public health strategies such as vaccination [3, 4] . In the UK, the 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) was introduced routinely in September 2006 and replaced by PCV13 from April 2010. The vaccine schedule is three doses administered at 2, 4 and 13 months of age. When first introduced, those over and under 1 year of age received one and two doses, respectively, as part of a catch-up programme for children aged ,2 years.",

Conventional methods such as blood culture and serology often have limited sensitivity due to inadequate sample volume or lack of convalescent sera [3] . Molecular diagnostics are now routinely used in the assessment of viral respiratory infections and similar techniques have been developed for the detection of bacterial respiratory infections [6, 7] . RESTI et al. [8] demonstrated a significant improvement in the identification of pneumococcal pneumonia in children by PCR on blood samples (15.4%) when applied simultaneously with blood culture (3.8%). In a recent study of Italian children aged ,5 years, overall bacteraemic pneumococcal pneumonia was identified in 14.3%, which was established by PCR in 92%, blood culture in 1% and both in 7% of subjects [9] .",

Radiological findings were categorised into lobar, patchy or perihilar, according to the World Health Organization criteria [12] . Pneumococcal conjugate immunisation history including the valency of PCV was obtained from parents and cross-checked with the child's parent-held health records. General practice surgeries were contacted to clarify the doses given if there was uncertainty. Immunisation history was not collected in the pre-vaccine study. Laboratory procedures Blood samples were collected for serum, blood culture (BacT/ALERT; bioM\u00e9rieux, Craponne, France) and pneumococcal PCR testing. Approximately 4 weeks later blood was collected for convalescent serology. Parents often declined returning for these convalescent samples (all in the post-vaccine study), contributing to the variability in the number of investigations performed. Nasopharyngeal secretions included aspirates from infants, and/or swabs from older children. Nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were placed in 0.9% sodium chloride transport solution or swabs (Medical Wire and Equipment Co. Ltd, Corsham, UK). Tracheobronchial secretions (collected via endotracheal tube or bronchoalveolar lavage) and pleural fluid were tested when obtained. The nature of the collected samples were standardised across all ages and in both studies. Recovery of bacterial pathogens from nasopharyngeal secretions, sputum or by urinary pneumococcal antigen was not considered evidence of definite infection, due to the risk of physiological colonisation [3, 13] . Therefore, only positive results that were classified as likely causative pathogens of pneumonia according to defined diagnostic criteria are presented and discussed (table 1). Any positive results from the potentially colonised above-mentioned sites were added together separately and rates were grouped among ''unknown causes'' in figure 1 for the reader's information.",

It is interesting that despite the overall decrease in the incidence and hospitalisation of pneumonia since the introduction of PCV7 [31, 32] , the rates of pneumococcal infection were comparable between the two studies. Replacement with non-PCV7 serotypes causing invasive pneumococcal disease is well recognised [33] , and this may explain our findings in the face of reduction in disease incidence. Where pneumococcal serotyping was possible, with the majority being identified from pleural fluids, all serotypes recovered were non-PCV7 but included in PCV13. This is similar to data from the USA on children with empyema, where 98% were non-PCV7 serotypes and primarily similar to the serotypes in our study [34] . Despite the lack of comprehensive serotype data, this suggests that PCV13 could substantially reduce invasive pneumococcal disease [35, 36] .",

This was followed by rhinovirus, influenza and adenovirus at ,7% each, similar to data previously described for the same region [19] . Diagnosis of viral infection was achieved mainly through the testing of respiratory secretions rather than by serology, which was only positive in seven children with influenza A virus. The improvement in the detection of viruses in the post-vaccine study was mainly achieved by the application of PCR assays for respiratory viral screening. Most of the viruses detected were identified in those aged ,5 years, consistent with other studies [2, 23] . In the post-vaccine study, viral screening was expanded to include eight viruses with their subgroups, including pandemic H1N1, and to delineate their contribution in causing CAP in children in the UK. Considering the timing of the second recruitment period, pandemic influenza A H1N1 as a single pathogen was not implicated in many cases of pneumonia. The low isolation rates of bocavirus, coronavirus and hMPV highlight the minimal contribution of these viruses to the aetiology of pneumonia in children in the UK. The rates of mixed viral-bacterial infection were variable between the two studies and likely to be dependent on the screening methods used to identify the causative pathogens [3] .",

Although the post-vaccine study covered two winter seasons, the numbers of children enrolled were fewer than in the pre-vaccine study, which could be a true reflection of decreased disease incidence and hospitalisation. The findings from the post-vaccine study may have been hampered by the lack of convalescent sera, which may have led to the underestimation of the role of atypical bacteria in paediatric pneumonia, but this effect is probably minimal as Mycoplasma infection was only detected in three children by paired serum samples in the pre-vaccine study. Lack of serotype data of the identified pneumococci from the pre-vaccine study limits the true comparison with the serotype profile after the implementation of the conjugate vaccine. Another limitation is the variation between the two studies in the diagnostic methods used and the pathogens investigated, which makes the interpretation of comparative findings guarded. The significant improvement in pathogen identification by the application of more PCR assays adds further evidence to the importance of using these techniques to monitor changes in the epidemiology of paediatric CAP and pneumococcal serotype replacement.",

This was compared to 14.7% pre-vaccination (28 (15.6%) out of 180 and seven (12%) out of 58 among those aged ,5 years and .5 years, respectively). In the post-vaccine study, diagnosis of pneumococcal infection improved when PCR was used (21 (21.6%) out of 97) compared to culture (eight (6%) out of 132) (p50.0004). A serotype was identified in 75% (18 out of 24) in the post-vaccine study. These were serotypes 1 (44.4%), 3 (27.8%), 19A (22.2%) and 7A/F (5.6%). The rate of positive blood culture post-vaccination was almost double (5.6%) that pre-vaccination (3.2%).Group A streptococcal infections were confirmed in a greater proportion of children (10.5%) postvaccination than in the pre-vaccination group (7%). These infections were associated with severe disease, and in two-thirds of cases with empyema. M. pneumoniae was identified from acute serology in 9.9% of children post-vaccination, with 4% (two out of 51) in those aged ,5 years and 20% (six out of 30) in patients aged .5 years. The rate of detected mycoplasma infection was higher pre-vaccination (12.5%) when paired acute and convalescent samples were available, with 7% (nine out of 128) in those aged ,5 years and 27% (13 out of 48) in those aged .5 years.Subgroup analysis: October 2009 to March 2010Among 67 children enrolled during this period, the causative pathogen was identified in 37 (55%). S. pneumoniae was identified in 18.3% (11 out of 60) compared to 16.7% (13 out of 78) during the first year of PCV13 vaccination (p50.824). Rates of infections were 22.4% bacterial, 22.4% viral and 10.5% mixed. The rate of bacterial infection is similar to the figures from the pre-and entire post-vaccine studies. There was no difference between the rates of viral infection before and after the introduction of PCV13 during the post-vaccine study (p50.079).",
