            "text": "A major hallmark of the autoimmune demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS) is immune cell infiltration into the brain and spinal cord resulting in myelin destruction, which not only slows conduction of nerve impulses, but causes axonal injury resulting in motor and cognitive decline. Current treatments for MS focus on attenuating immune cell infiltration into the central nervous system (CNS). These treatments decrease the number of relapses, improving quality of life, but do not completely eliminate relapses so long-term disability is not improved. Therefore, therapeutic agents that protect the CNS are warranted. In both animal models as well as human patients with MS, T cell entry into the CNS is generally considered the initiating inflammatory event. In order to assess if a drug protects the CNS, any potential effects on immune cell infiltration or proliferation in the periphery must be ruled out. This protocol describes how to determine whether CNS protection observed after drug intervention is a consequence of attenuating CNS-infiltrating immune cells or blocking death of CNS cells during inflammatory insults. The ability to examine MS treatments that are protective to the CNS during inflammatory insults is highly critical for the advancement of therapeutic strategies since current treatments reduce, but do not completely eliminate, relapses (i.e., immune cell infiltration), leaving the CNS vulnerable to degeneration.",

            "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is characterized by inflammatory lesions predominantly in white matter regions of the brain early in disease. After longterm progression, gray matter atrophy is detected by MRI imaging and marks the neurodegenerative phase of the disease. Reactive gliosis, demyelination, and axonal damage in the white matter are attributed to CNS-infiltrating immune cells. None of the treatments currently used in MS reverse or directly prevent neurodegeneration in the CNS -instead, they reduce inflammation by attenuating T cell activation and/or infiltration into the CNS. Because there is no cure for MS and patients using current treatments continue to experience disease progression, discoveries of drugs that prevent demyelination and neuronal loss are critically important. However, differentiating between effects on immune cells and those on the CNS can be difficult experimentally, as the outcome -i.e., reduced damage to the CNS -looks the same regardless of the mechanisms through which it occurs. Therefore, assessment of CNS protection must be partnered with assessments of CNS-infiltrating immune cells and proliferation of immune cells in the periphery to determine how pharmacological agents affect disease mechanisms.",

            "text": "Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a well-established animal model of autoimmune inflammatory disorders that was directly responsible for the discovery of drugs currently used to treat MS [1] [2] [3] [4] . Mice are often used for EAE, with C57BL/6 mice being a popular strain based on the availability of genetic variants. C57BL/6 mice induced with EAE exhibit chronic disease progression with onset around day 10 postinduction. Infiltration of the spinal cord parenchyma and cerebellum are characteristic of the histopathology of these animals, with absence of infiltration in the cortical parenchyma 5 . Additionally, cortical lesions and demyelination in the brain are hallmarks of the disease [6] [7] [8] [9] , which are relatively absent in C57BL/6 mice. Therefore, it may be preferable when possible to use SJL mice, which have relapsing-remitting disease and lesions found in both the brain and spinal cord that appear similar to those in MS 10 . Treatment cannot be classified as neuroprotective if immune cells never reach the CNS. Therefore, this protocol makes use of flow cytometric analysis of brains, spinal cords, and spleens from EAE mice to determine effects of treatment on immune cell infiltration into the CNS and proliferation of immune cells in the periphery, as previously demonstrated 2. Assessment of immune cell infiltration in brain and spinal cord 1. Cut brains and spinal cords into smaller pieces using sterile scissors. Crush with the plunger from a 3 ml syringe over a 70 \u03bcm cell strainer into a new 50 ml tube while rinsing the strainer with media. Bring each tube to a 50 ml volume with media. Centrifuge at 453 x g for 5 min to pellet cells. 2. Aspirate supernatant and resuspend pellet in 4 ml of 40% density gradient media. Carefully overlay the 40% density gradient containing cells on top of 2 ml of 70% density gradient in a new 15 ml conical tube-pipette very slowly onto the wall of the conical tube to ensure proper layering of the gradient. Spin at 796 x g for 20 min at RT without a brake. 3. Carefully remove the upper myelin layer from the gradient with a 1 ml transfer pipette, then remove viable cells at the interface with a 1 ml transfer pipette and transfer to a new 15 ml conical tube. Bring the tube to 15 ml with media and centrifuge at 448 x g for 10 min. 4. Resuspend pellet in 200 \u03bcl media and place into one well of a 96-well round-bottom plate (each sample from each animal will go into its own well). Centrifuge the plate at 410 x g for 5 min. 5. Flick off the supernatant and resuspend pellet in 200 \u03bcl of restimulation media (RPMI supplemented with 10% FCS, 100 IU/ ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine, 1x non-essential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, and 55 \u03bcM \u03b2mercaptoethanol, plus 50 ng/ml phorbol myristate acetate (PMA), 750 ng/ml ionomycin, and the protein transport inhibitor Brefeldin A). Place the plate in an incubator at 37 o C for 4 hr. NOTE: PMA and ionomycin restimulation results in activation of all T lymphocytes-regardless of their antigen specificity in order to assess the total number of each T cell subset in the given tissue. However, antigen-specific effector T cell responses can be assessed in various ways, including restimulating cells with MOG peptide in the presence of Brefeldin A 15 ",

Anesthetize mice with 2.5% isoflurane and 97.5% oxygen and confirm appropriate depth of anesthesia with a gentle toe pinch using forceps, looking for a lack of response. Perform transcardiac perfusion as described in step 3. 8. When ready, section tissue at 16 \u03bcm with a cryostat and mount on electrostatically charged slides. Put every 10 th section on a slide each for brain and spinal cord (for example, slide 1 will have sections 1, 11, and 21, and slide 2 will have sections 2, 12, and 22, and so on).

            "text": "2. Staining for reactive gliosis and myelin 1. When ready for staining, choose one slide each for brain and spinal cord per stain for every animal in the same (or as similar as possible) region. For the brain, choose slides showing the corpus callosum and cingulum bundle. 2. Place slides with tissue on a heat block at 70 o C for 7 min. After 7 min turn off the heat block and let the slides cool on the heat block for another 10 -15 min. This will prevent tissue sections from falling off the slides during the staining procedure. 3. Wash slides 3 times each in 1x PBS with 0.1% nonionic detergent (for intracellular antigens) or 1x PBS (for antibodies targeting surface antigens) for 5 min. NOTE: Since the antibodies used in this protocol are intracellular, nonionic detergents will be used in subsequent steps. Never allow slides to dry completely after this step. 4. Place slides in a container and cover with citrate buffer pH 3.0. To make citrate buffer, add 0.192 g anhydrous citric acid to a final volume of 100 ml in water. Adjust pH with acetic acid if above pH 3.0 or NaOH if below. 5. Incubate slides at 37 o C for 30 min and wash 3 times in 1x PBS with 0.1% nonionic detergent for 5 min. 6. Circle an area around the tissue with a hydrophobic barrier pen and place the slides in a humidified chamber (for example, a slide box containing wet paper towels). Add blocking buffer to the tissue. Incubate for 30 min at RT. NOTE: Blocking buffer consists of 1x PBS plus 0.3% nonionic detergent and the appropriate serum (5%) based on the host of the secondary antibody, i.e., horse serum for myelin basic protein (MBP) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and goat serum for Iba1. 7. Flick blocking buffer off the slides and add primary antibody (1:1,000 or 0.2 \u00b5g/ml goat anti-myelin basic protein for oligodendrocytes, 1:1,000 or 1 \u00b5g/ml to 3 \u00b5g/ml mouse anti-GFAP for astrocytes, or 1:750 or 0.67 \u03bcg/ml rabbit anti-Iba1 for microglia) diluted in the appropriate blocking buffer (see step 4.2.6) to the circled area. Leave at 4 o C overnight in the humidified chamber. 8. Flick antibody in blocking buffer off the slides and wash the slides 3 times in 1x PBS with 0.1% nonionic detergent for 5 min. 9. Add secondary antibody (1:200 or 7.5 \u00b5g/ml biotinylated horse anti-mouse for MBP and GFAP, or biotinylated goat anti-rabbit for Iba1) diluted in the appropriate blocking buffer (see step 4.2.6) to the circled area and leave slides to incubate in the humidified chamber for 1 hr at RT. 10 . Flick antibody in blocking buffer off the slides and wash the slides 3 times in 1x PBS with 0.1% nonionic detergent for 5 min. 11. Prepare avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (ABC) in immunoperoxidase (see materials list) 30 min before use and agitate on a shaker until needed in 4.2.12. Add 0.3% H 2 O 2 in methanol to the circled area for 10 min to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. 12.

NOTE: This step requires a microscope to observe optimal detection time of staining and must be done for the same amount of time for slides to be compared. 14. Wash slides 3 times in water for 5 min each. Dehydrate the tissue by placing in the following solutions for 2 min each: 70% ethanol in water, 95% ethanol in water, 100% ethanol in water, 50% xylenes and 50% ethanol, 100% xylenes. Seal a coverslip on the slide with a resinous mounting medium. 15. Alternatively, perform immunofluorescent staining as previously described 11 to assess reactive gliosis using antibodies against Iba-1 and GFAP. 16. Take images of each spinal cord section (stained with respective antibodies using DAB) with a 4X, 0.13 NA objective and save the images as .tiff. Alternatively, take images of the corpus callosum and cingulum bundle in the left or right brain hemisphere using a 20X, 0.50 NA objective and save the images as .tiff. For a more comprehensive determination of lesion load in the brain, it is beneficial to include both hemispheres in analyses. De-noise the image by going to Process > Subtract Background and set the \"Rolling ball radius\" to at least the size of the largest object that is not part of the background (see the ImageJ user guide at http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/docs/guide/146-29.html).

A clinical score of 1 is a partially limp tail, which may be determined by lifting the mouse by the base of the tail. The normal helicopter-like rotating may be weakened or absent, and part of the tail may be completely limp. A helpful way to determine extent of tail paralysis is to run one's finger up the length of the tail, as an unparalyzed tail will usually curl around the finger while a partially paralyzed tail will be unable to do so. A clinical score of 2 represents a completely paralyzed tail. No movement of the tail occurs at all when picking the mouse up at the base of the tail. A clinical score of 3 represents partial hind limb paralysis. Determination of this score requires that the mouse be free to move on a flat surface. If one hind limb is dragging as the mouse moves forward, or if one or both hind limbs appear to be partially paralyzed, a score of 3 may be given. A clinical score of 4 represents complete hind limb paralysis. With this score, a mouse will be unable to move its hind limbs and will drag itself forward using its front limbs. A clinical score of 5 represents a moribund mouse, or a mouse with difficulty moving itself across its cage or breathing. If a mouse cannot drag itself along the bottom of the cage or if its breathing is labored, the Atypical clinical disease may or may not be accompanied by paralysis. It may be necessary to include two separate scoring systems if a mouse presents with atypical disease plus typical symptoms. A score of 0 is no abnormal behavior, as with the typical scoring system. A clinical score of 1 represents a slight head turn or tilt while the mouse is walking. This may be determined by allowing the mouse to walk forward and observing a constant left or right directionality to its movement. A clinical score of 2 represents a more pronounced head turn and poor righting ability. As with an atypical score of 1, the mouse has directionality to its movement and may have slight difficulty with balance. A clinical score of 3 represents an inability to walk in a straight line. The mouse will have difficulty balancing and may use the side of the cage to help right itself as it walks. A clinical score of 4 represents a mouse laying on its side, unable to walk due to balancing issues. The mouse may be able to drag itself along the bottom of the cage but may have directionality to its movement. A clinical score of 5 represents continuous rolling unless supported. A mouse that reaches this score should be humanely euthanized. A clinical score of 6 represents a mouse found dead in its cage. A score of 6 is unusual and causes of death other than EAE should be investigated.",

The SJL model of EAE is advantageous for these experiments since these mice exhibit a relapsing-remitting phenotype. If a drug treatment prevents myelin-axon degeneration, an improvement in clinical scores will be observed (Figure 6 ). Pathological assessment of myelin must corroborate a reduction in myelin damage consistent with improved clinical scores. To quantitatively evaluate myelin integrity, DAB staining of myelin basic protein (MBP) is performed, followed by statistical analysis of the optical density for this staining (Figure 7) . To further substantiate that neuroinflammation is sustained or decreased by therapeutic interventions, reactive gliosis can be assessed by measuring mean fraction area for reactive gliosis as described above (Figure 3) . To corroborate that a therapeutic intervention is directly protecting the CNS without immunomodulatory effects, attenuation of immune cell infiltration into the CNS and proliferation in the spleens must be discounted. To address this, methods for brain and spinal cord assessment of immune cell infiltration and assessment of peripheral T cell proliferation and activation should be performed as described above (Figures 4 and 5) . Taken together, therapeutic agents that block cell injury in the CNS with no evidence of a reduction in CNS-infiltrating T cells or proliferation of T cells in the periphery are CNS-protective treatments.

Treatment after onset of symptoms implies that immune cells have entered the CNS and have caused some damage.

Therefore, it is necessary to use flow cytometric analysis and immunohistochemistry to look at how immune cells are affected in the periphery and CNS, whether immune cells have entered the CNS, and how the CNS reacts to treatment. While flow cytometric analysis of the spinal cord can determine how many cells have entered the CNS at a given time, one cannot determine that this effect is due to reduced immune cell trafficking unless proliferation of immune cells is unaffected in the spleen. It is therefore necessary to analyze both peripheral and CNS tissue and determine what results mean mechanistically when both tissues are compared. It is also possible for immune cell activity profiles to be altered by treatment, for example having a switch in a pathogenic helper T cell-heavy profile to a regulatory T cell-heavy profile. Looking at markers for different cell types and comparing percent expression between treated and untreated animals is therefore also an important consideration. An emerging concept in MS research suggests that B cells play an important role in autoimmune demyelination. This is based on studies showing that B cells are necessary for the reactivation of T cells 20 . This concept is supported by the success of treatments such as rituximab, an antibody against CD20 expressed on the surface of B cells 21, 22 . As demonstrated by the success of the monoclonal antibody ocrelizumab in clinical trials, drugs targeting different epitopes of CD20 may improve the efficacy of B cell-targeted therapeutics 23 .",

Commensal gut microbiota can heavily influence disease pathogenesis 24 ; therefore, mice housed in different colonies and even in different cages can have vast differences in disease severity. Accordingly, it is always preferable where possible to use littermate controls raised in the same cage for experiments involving EAE.

Furthermore, to extend the exploration of pharmacological agents that are neuroprotective, markers of axonal transection and neuronal death should be included. Another area of importance is remyelination. Injured axons are unable to remyelinate lending further support that neuroprotective therapies should be an important part of remyelination therapies. Additionally, unmyelinated axons are more vulnerable to injury than myelinated axons. This suggests that when an axon becomes demyelinated therapeutic interventions that promote timely remyelination will prevent axonal injury. To explore these avenues, other in vivo models for demyelination and remyelination may be used (i.e., cuprizone and lysolecithin). The method described herein focused on assessing neuroprotection by quantifying myelin loss. For the evaluation of remyelination the number of progenitor cells as well as their ability to proliferate and mature would also be important to investigate. With the mention of these alternative models, one must also consider different models of encephalitis that are virally mediated. There are two well-characterized RNA viral models that produce myelin loss: one is Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis, a non-enveloped Picornaviridae virus, and the other is mouse hepatitis virus, a member of the Coronaviridae virus family 25, 26 .",

Perfusion should be performed in a fume hood. 3. Remove brains and vertebral columns as described in steps 3.1.4 -3.1.6. Tie vertebral columns to sticks with string to ensure straight alignment of the spinal cord. 4. Put brains in scintillation vials labeled with the animal's ID with about 20 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, and spinal cords in 50 ml conical tubes labeled with the animal's ID with about 50 ml of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS to post-fix overnight. 5. To cryoprotect brains, rinse 3 times in 1x PBS and store at 4 o C in 30% sucrose in 1x PBS. Allow the brains to drop to the bottom of their containers (about 3 days). 6. Remove calcium from the vertebral column by rinsing it 3 times in 1x PBS and placing it in a large volume (about 50 ml for a mouse spinal cord) of 0.5 M EDTA in 1x PBS (starting pH will be ~10; pH to ~7.8 with 6 N HCl) for 2 -3 weeks until the bone is no longer rigid. Cryoprotect the vertebral column by following step 4.1.5. 7. Embed brains and vertebral columns in OCT following the sub-steps below as soon as they drop to the bottom of their containers. 1. Make a mixture of 1 part 30% sucrose in 1x PBS and 2 parts OCT (for example, add 15 ml 30% sucrose in 1x PBS to 30 ml OCT). 2. Add OCT/sucrose mixture to the embedding mold (22 x 22 x 20 mm for brains and 22 x 30 x 20 mm for spinal cords) until it is about \u00bd full. 3. Cut vertebral columns into 6 equally-sized pieces using a razor blade and place into a 22 x 30 x 20 mm embedding mold facing forward for coronal spinal cord sections. Place whole brains into 22 x 22 x 20 mm molds facing forward. 4.Add OCT/sucrose mixture to cover the tissue and let it sit for 1 hr. so bubbles can escape. During this hr, add 2-methylbutane to a dish that can hold embedding molds for flash-freezing. Place the dish on dry ice and cover to pre-cool. 5.

To begin the extracellular stain, centrifuge cells at 410 x g for 5 min, flick off supernatant, and resuspend pellet in 50 \u03bcl of surface stain cocktail containing fluorophore labeled antibodies against CD4 (1:200, 1 \u03bcg/ml), TCR\u03b2 (1:200, 1 \u03bcg/ml), and viability dye (1:500) diluted in PBS for 15 min on ice. Centrifuge cells at 410 x g for 5 min and flick off supernatant. Wash cells 2x in 200 \u03bcl PBS then centrifuge at 410 x g for 5 min. 4. After removing the extracellular stain, initiate the intracellular staining procedure by fixation/permeabilization followed by intracellular staining. 1. To begin, flick off supernatant and fix/permeabilize cells with Foxp3 transcription factor staining reagents 17 (according to manufacturer's instructions; see Materials List) for 30 min to overnight at 4 Wash cells in 150 \u03bcl permeabilization buffer from the kit and centrifuge plate at 410 x g for 5 min. Flick off supernatant and stain cells in 50 \u03bcl permeabilization buffer with fluorophore labeled-antibodies against IL-17A Centrifuge cells at 410 x g for 5 min and flick off supernatant. To remove excess antibodies wash 3x in 200 \u03bcl permeabilization buffer then centrifuge at 410 x g for 5 min. Flick off supernatant and resuspend in 200 \u03bcl PBS. 4. Analyze cells by flow cytometry, gating on live CD4 Aspirate media and resuspend pellet in 2 ml ACK lysing buffer at RT to lyse red blood cells for approximately 3 min. 3. Bring tube to 15 ml volume with media and strain over a 70 \u03bcm cell strainer into a new tube.",
