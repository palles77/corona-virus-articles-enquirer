Mice infected experimentally with various strains of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), most notably A59 or JHM, have been studied as a model of viral infection of the central nervous system (CNS). In this model, the virus replicates in glia (both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes 1\"2) with detectable viral RNA and antigen in neurons ~-4 and causes an encephalomyelitis. Results of some studies have suggested that neurons may provide a means of viral transport within the CNS 3'4. Clearance of virus occurs within 2-3 weeks postinfection (pi) and requires both CD8 \u00f7 and CD4 \u00f7 T cells 6'7. The CD8 \u00f7 cells were suspected\" of acting as cytotoxic effector cells, and recent data demonstrating that CD8 \u00f7 cytotoxic T cells specific for viral proteins are present in the CNS of mice infected with JHM suggests that this is indeed the case s.",

Early experiments demonstrated by electron microscopy the presence of virions in oligodendrocytes and led to the suggestion that viral cytolysis of oligodendrocytes was responsible for demyelination 12' 13. There is now substantial evidence suggesting participation of the immune system in the pathogenesis of chronic demyelination. Wang et al. TM have shown that irradiation of JHM-infected mice prevents demyelination and that the transfer of T cells from immune mice can partially restore disease. Furthermore, JHM infection of rats results in an autoimmune reaction against myelin basic protein ~s (MBP) and JHM infection of mice leads to autoreactive T cells of unknown specificity ~6. Both CD4 \u00f7 and CD8 \u00f7 T cells are localized to foci of JHM-induced demyelination and appear to be activated (S. Perlman, personal communication). Zimprich etal. ~7 also demonstrated CD4 \u00f7 and CD8\u00f7T cells in the demyelinated lesions induced by J HM in rats. Enhanced expression of MHC RNA or antigens in CNS-derived cells has been reported in both A59 ~8' 19 and JHM 2\u00b0 infections. The induction of MHC antigens on glial cells may be part of an immune-mediated process that leads to demyelination.",

Our approach used mice carrying a deletion in the/Y2-microglobulin (/~2M) gene which prevents the expression of functional MHC class I molecules and the maturation of CD8 \u00f7 T cells. Consequently, these/Y2M-/-mice are more susceptible to virus infection and do not clear virus as efficiently as normal C57BL/6 mice. However, demyelination in the brain and spinal cord occurs in some mice despite the absence of CD8 \u00f7 cells.

            "text": "Initial experiments showed that/Y2M -/-mice were more susceptible to MHV-A59 following intracerebral (ic) inoculation of virus than were C57BL/6 (B6) mice. Infection of p2M -/-mice with 5000 plaque forming units (PFU) of A59 (one LDso for B6 mice) reproducibly killed /~2M -/-mice within 10-14 days. Consequently, we determined the LDs0 of A59 in/~2M -/-mice as well as in both parental strains, B6 and 129. 21 As shown in Table 1 , the LDs0 of A59 in /~2M -~-mice is 103-to 104-fold lower than in either/Y2M \u00f7~\u00f7 parent. In addition, we determined the LDs0 for C12, a fusion defective and attenuated mutant of A59. 22' 23 The LDs0 of C12 in B6 mice was previously determined to be 106 pfu. 23 Although C12 retained its attenuated phenotype, the LDs0 for C12 in /~2M -~-mice was 10\"-fold less than in B6 mice. The lower pfu per LDs0 observed for A59 in/~2M -/-mice compared to either parental mouse strain shows that the susceptibility of/~2M -~-mice is unique and is not a trait derived from either parent. CD8*.T cells were shown previously to play an important role in the clearance of MHV-JHM from the CNS of B6 mice. 6' 7 The absence of a detectable CD8 \u00f7 T cell population in naive/~2M-/-mice led us to examine the possibility that A59 would not be cleared efficiently and that a persistent infection of the CNS might result. For these experiments,/Y2M -~-mice were inoculated ic with 5-20 pfu of wild type A59. (Three different amounts of virus were used for inoculation to ensure that we would have enough animals to measure replication of virus. We observed that 5 pfu (1 LDs0) did not reliably result in virus replication in all animals inoculated and that 20 pfu (4 LD60s) resulted in a significant amount of mortality.) At selected times postinfection (pi) mice were sacrificed, perfused with PBS, and the brain, spinal cord, and liver removed. The tissue was homogenized and assayed for infectious virus. During the first 7 days pi, titers in the brain rose rapidly, achieving peak titers of 108 pfu/g (Fig.  1A) . Clinical signs of disease usually appeared at this time and were evidenced by ruffled fur and ataxia. Levels of virus remained relatively stable between 7 and 14 days pi with little evidence of clearance until day 15. During this time the mice developed increasingly severe disease which often presented as hind limb paralysis; most deaths occurred during the second and third week pi. Infection of B6 controls with 5000 pfu (approx. 1 LDs0) also led to a rapid increase in virus titer during the first week, but in contrast to infection of/~2M-/-mice, virus clearance was essentially complete by 2 weeks pi (Fig. 1A) . Similar patterns of virus growth in the liver of B6 and/t2M -~-mice were observed with transient growth followed by clearance in B6 mice but growth to high titer and delayed clearance in/~2M -~-mice (data not shown).",

One half of each tissue was fixed in buffered formalin and used for histopathologic examination whereas the remaining half was homogenized and used for titrations. Titration of these samples showed that with two exceptions, virus was cleared from the brains by 30 days pi (Fig. 1B) . One animal killed at 60 days pi without obvious physical signs of disease had 5 x 104 pfu per g of tissue. The other animal was killed at 76 days pi with severe hind limb paralysis and had a similar virus titer in the brain. Despite these two exceptions, clearance of virus from the CNS of/Y2M -/mice was generally complete by 30 days pi.",

To determine if the lack of CD8 \u00f7 cells altered the occurrance or severity of demyelination, we infected B6 mice with 200 pfu of either wild type A59 or C12 and prepared sections of brain and spinal cord 35 days pi. In wild type infected B6 mice, four of seven (57.1%) mice showed lesions with 27 of 144 (18.8%) quadrants positive (Table 3 ). This is in marked contrast to C12-infected B6 mice. Here, only one of seven (14%) mice exhibited demyelination, and in this one animal, only one lesion was observed among 144 quadrants examined. Therefore, the attenuated phenotype of C12 (Table 1) is also reflected in the severity of demyelination in ic-infected B6 mice. Inoculation of the same dose ofC12 into/~2M -/-mice induced demyelination in four of 11 animals, and examination of LFB-stained sections revealed lesions in 3% (4 of 132) quadrants. This frequency is not significantly different from that observed in B6 mice (p >0.05 by the Mann-Whitney U test) and argues that the absence of CD8 \u00f7 T cells does not result in a reduced levels of demyelination. More recent experiments support a role for an immunopathological mechanism by showing that irradiation of mice within the first week of infection prevented demyelination. 14' 28 Demyelination could be partially restored with the adoptive transfer of T cells from immune donors. While the evidence for an immune-mediated mechanism in MHV-induced demyelination is strong, it is important to consider that both mechanisms may contribute to disease. Indeed, it has been suggested that direct viral cytolysis/cytotoxicity may be operational during the early phase (7-10 days) of disease and an immune-mediated component (with or without viral involvement) in the later subacute phase. 24 In the experiments reported here, we took advantage of the availability of/?2M -/mice 21 to investigate the role CD8 \u00f7 T cells play in MHV-induced subacute demyelination. If CD8 \u00f7 T cells are significant in the induction of demyelination, the subacute disease might be expected to decrease substantially. In contrast, if the pathway to demyelination does not involve CD8 \u00f7 cells, but is due to either another immune cell or to oligodendrocyte degeneration, the frequency of demyelination should be unaffected or possibly enhanced since CD8* cells are required for viral clearance from the CNS and virus replicates to higher levels in their absence (Fig. 1A) .",

Measurement of antibody responses in/~2M -/-mice following infection with either Theiler virus 3\u00b0' 3~ or influenza virus 28 show that neutralizing antibody levels are similar to those in p2M */* mice, indicating that humoral responses could also play a role in the clearance of A59 from tttese mice.",

Infection of/~2M -/-mice with Theiler's virus results in delayed viral clearance and demyelination.30. 3~ Interestingly, H-2 b haplotype mice are usually resistant to Theiler's virus-induced disease; in the absence of CD8 \u00f7 T cells, however, clearance of virus is delayed and demyelinatiog does occur. A difficult question to answer is whether MHV-induced demyelination in B6 mice is more extensive or severe than in/~2M -/mice. Previous studies have shown an inherent inefficiency in successfully infecting mice with low doses of virus (Gombold ~and Sutherland, unpublished data). Therefore, the 5% demyelination observed in wild type-infected/~2M -/-mice can only be taken as a lower limit of the actual frequency. It was for this reason that C12 was used in the second group of experiments. C12 is attenuated in both B623 and ~2M -/mice (Table 1 ) which allowed us to use higher doses of virus. The attenuation of C12 may be reflected in the extent of demyelination seen in infected B6 mice; compared to wild type virus at the same dose (200 pfu), C12 caused 25 times less demyelination (18.8% vs 0.7%)\u00b0 However, the inoculation of the same dose of C12 into/~2M -/-mice resulted in levels of demyelinationthat are not statistically different from C12-infected B6 mice. Therefore, neither the loss of CD8* T cells nor the elevated titers of virus that occur in /~2M -/-mice lead to a change in the level of demyelination. We are cautious about extending this conclusion to wild type virus, however, because the levels of demyelination may be less with C12 than with wild type A59.",

Routine analyses of cells from the spleen and lymph nodes from naive p2M -/-animals failed to detect expression of/~2M or CD8* cells (data not shown), in agreement with the original observations on these mice. 21 It has been demonstrated recently, however, that/~2M-/-mice are competent to mount a CD8* response against allogeneic tumor cells after in vivo priming. 32-34 Presumably, therefore, the low level of expression of MHC class I heavy chain on the surface of the cell in the absence of/~2M 3s is sufficient to select for low numbers of CD8 \u00f7 cells which recognize such ligands after suitable in vivo expansion. It should be noted that the response to allogeneic MHC molecules usually occurs at very high frequency in normal naive mice; 0.3 to 1% of peripheral T cells will respond to alloantigen 36 in the absence of in vivo expansion. Nevertheless the presence of CD8 \u00f7 T cells in/~2M -/-mice, which can be expanded by in vivo manipulation, raises the possibility that such cells may be recruited during the acute or chronic phase of MHV infection. This would require, however, the presentation of antigenic peptides by MHC class I heavy chain alone, which has been shown not to occur except in the presence of/~=MY -39 In contrast, alloresponses are thought to be mediated by a wide variety of ligands which include a large set of endogenously and exogenously derived peptides in association with the allogeneic MHC, in addition to the MHC molecule itself. 4\u00b0 It is not surprising therefore that the low number of CD8* T cells in/~2M -/mice can find a suitable stimulus within this population of ligands. We believe, therefore, that it is highly unlikely that CD8 \u00f7 T cells competent to respond to MHV are present in these animals and this belief is supported by our finding that these animals are almost incapable of mounting a protective immune response against the virus.",

Spinal cord sections from mice killed from 36-60 days after inoculation\u2022 All sections were formalin fixed, paraffin embedded and stained with luxol fast blue. White matter demyelinating lesions are indicated by arrows or arrowheads. Panels A and B. Sections from a /t~M /-mouse inoculated with MHV-A59. Panel A shows a cross section of the entire spinal cord exhibiting focal mononuclear inflammatory infiltrate in the meninges adjacent to the anterior and posterior midline. In addition, a demyelinating lesion is observed in the anterior column of the white matter ( x 40). Panel B shows a higher magnification of the area of demyelination ( x 100).Panels C and D. Sections from a B6 mouse inoculated wih MHV-A59. Panel C shows a cross section of the entire spinal cord showing focal meningitis and extensive demyelination in both anterior aspects of the cord and one of the lateral columns. A sharp border between the demyelinating lesion and the intact myelin is shown by the arrows. Note that the border between gray and white matter becomes obscured in the demyelinated areas. Panel D shows a higher magnification of an area of demyelination and inflammation ( x 200). Panels E and F. Sections from a fl=M / mouse inoculated with the C12 variant of MHV-A59. Panel E shows a cross-section of the spinal cord showing focal meningitis; an area of demyelination and inflammation in the lateral aspect of the cord is indicated by the arrows ( x 40). Panel F shows a higher magnification of the area of demyelination and inflammation ( x 200). Reproduced here at 70%.
