Using two-fluorochrome immunofluorescence, our present study shows that though there is extensive myelin loss and necrosis in the brain stem of mice with HSV encephalitis, only some oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglial cells are infected. T cells that express CD4 or CD8 and a large number of CD4 +, F4/80 + macrophages are present in perivascular infiltrates close to and in contact with HSV-infected cells in areas of massive myelin loss. These findings suggest that the resultant infiltration of immune cells into the brain during HSV-1 infection may cause as much damage as the virus itself. 0165-5728/89/$03.50 ",

Chart, Department of Microbiology, UMDS, Guy's Campus, London Bridge, London SE1 9RT, U.K. cells (Nash et al., 1980; Nagafuchi et al., 1982; Larsen et al., 1983; Nash and Gell, 1983; Sethi et al., 1983) , less is known of the effect of T lymphocytes on the pathology of HSV-l-induced disease. It was demonstrated that after corneal infection of HSV-1, athymic mice suffered milder CNS pathology than do immunocompetent mice (Townsend, 1981) , suggesting that T cells may produce significant central nervous system (CNS) damage. Similarly, immunosuppression of mice with cyclophosphamide prior to infection resulted in a marked reduction of mononuclear infiltrates and myelin destruction in the CNS compared with non-immunosuppressed mice, though both groups of mice showed comparable virus and serum neutralising antibody titres (Townsend and Baringer, 1979; Altmann and Blyth, 1985) . These studies suggest that the immune response triggered during HSV-1 infection and the resultant infiltration of immune cells into the CNS can, under certain circumstances, cause as much damage as the virus itself. While previous reports have shown cellular infiltrates into the brain during HSV-1 infection (Townsend and Baringer, 1979; Townsend, 1985) , the cell types have not been identified or characterised.",

In this study, therefore, we have used cell type-specific markers which would allow unambiguous identification of the different types of neural or immune cells in the brain. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is an astrocytespecific protein (Bignami et al., 1972) , galactocerebroside (GC) is the major galactosphingolipid of myelin on the surface of oligodendrocytes while CD8 and CD4 are specific cell surface molecules of cytotoxic/suppressor and helper (inducer) T cells respectively. The rat monoclonal antibody F4/80 is directed against a 160000 Da plasma membrane glycoprotein on mature mouse macrophages (Austyn and Gordon, 1981) . By marking specific cell types with antibodies conjugated to one fluorochrome, we have been able to study the expression of HSV or CD4 antigen on these cells or of their spatial relationship to other HSV-infected ceils by using antibodies conjugated to a different fluorochrome. We report here evidence obtained from double-label indirect immunofluorescence that oligodendrocytes, astrocytes and microglial cells in the brain stem of mice showing clinical signs of viral encephalitis are infected with HSV-1, A large number of CD4 +, F4/80 + macrophages and some T cells that express CD4 or CD8 are present in perivascular infiltrates in the vicinity as well as in contact with HSV-infected cells and this is also an area of massive myelin loss.",

            "text": "In order to determine which cells are infected, sections were double-labelled with anti-HSV antibody and with antibodies specific for the glial surface markers, galactocerebroside of oligodendrocytes and GFAP of astrocytes. Some oligodendrocytes (Fig. 2 ) and astrocytes (data not shown) were infected. Since oligodendrocytes are myelin-forming cells while astroeytes reportedly function as physical and nutritional supporting cells for other glial cells, it is conceivable that infection of such cells and the resultant cytocidal effect would contribute to myelin loss. However, although there was extensive myelin destruction accompanied by necrosis within the brain stem, the proportion of infected ghai cells was small. It is therefore unlikely that myelin loss is due entirely to infection of glial cells, and further studies were made of the infiltrating cells which were concentrated in the infected areas. Monoclonal antibodies YTS 169.4 (anti-CD8), GK 1.5 (anti-CD4) and F4/80 (a mature mouse macrophage marker) were applied in a double-label technique to localize cytoxic/suppressor T cells, helper (inducer) T cells, and macrophage/monocytes respectively relative to HSV-infected cells in the sections. As shown in Fig. 3 , CD8 + cells (straight arrow) occur perivascularly in small clusters in the vicinity of necrotic areas of infected cells (curved arrow) and they also occur individually or in groups of a few cells in the brain parenchyma. Occasionally they can be seen next to an infected cell. In contrast, the CD4 + cells (broad arrow in Fig. 4 ) occur in large numbers as rounded lymphocyte-like cells localised mainly in perivascular cuffs. Again these are mainly in the vicinity of necrotic areas of infected cells in the brain stem and occasionally a CD4 + cell (arrowhead) can be seen in contact with an infected cell ( Fig. 4a and b) . Though the majority of CD4 + cells are not infected, some of them (curved arrow) appear to be ( Fig. 4a and b) . This is in agreement with recent evidence that T lymphocytes when activated can support otherwise non-permissive HSV replication (Braun and Kirchner, 1986) . Like the CD4 + cells, the F4/80 + cells are localised as rounded cells in perivascular infiltrates in the vicinity of infected cells and some of them are infected (data not shown). In addition, there is also a diffuse distribution of F4/80 + microglial-like cells in the parenchyma (Fig. 5a) . Such distribution and morphology is in sharp contrast to the less abundant F4/80 + mi- croglial cells present in the brain stem parenchyma of normal mice (data not shown). The similar distribution seen with the CD4 + and F4/80 + cells in the infected sections and the large number of CD4 + cells detected prompted us to investigate this further. Using double labelling, it was seen that among the perivascular infiltrates, all the rounded F4/80 + cells (arrow) were also CD4 positive ( Fig. 5a and b) whereas only some of the CD4 + cells were F4/80 negative (data not shown). Most other F4/80 + microglial-like cells in the parenchyma were CD4 negative ( Fig. 5a and b) . This result is consistent with a recent report (Perry and Gordon, 1987 ) that monocytes and macro-phages express CD4 antigen, and that microglial cells can modulate CD4 antigen levels after inflammation and changes in the blood-brain barrier. Such CD4 antigen expression appears to coincide with a change in morphology of microglia and may represent a process of cellular activation. Because of this, it is conceivable that some of the CD4+-infected cells seen may be CD4 + microglial cells. Therefore HSV infection of brain cells can lead to an accumulation of macrophages which may be due to an invasion and proliferation of blood-derived monocytes and/or activation of microglial cells.",

These findings suggest that immune cells may be involved in myelin destruction and are consistent with previous reports that T cells may produce significant CNS pathology during HSV encephalitis (Townsend and Baringer, 1979; Townsend, 1981; Altmann and Blyth, 1985) . The precise role of these cells in the pathology of HSV-l-induced encephalitis is at present unclear. It is, however, hkely that this may be mediated via lymphokines. Activated macrophage damage to myelin may be by direct contact or by the production of neutral proteases which can degrade myelin basic protein in vitro (Cammer et al., 1978) . Since encephalitogenic T cell clones specific for myelin basic protein have been shown to induce experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and glial cells can be induced to express MHC class I or class II antigen (Ting et al., 1981; Hirsch et al., 1983; Fontana et al., 1984; Wong et al., 1984; Fierz et al., 1985; Massa et al., 1986; Susumura et al., 1986) , it is conceivable that such cells may present viral antigen or myelin basic protein as a bystander effect to class II-restricted CD4 + encephalitogenic T cells (Yasukawa and Zarling, 1984; Sun and Wekerle, 1986) or to class I-restricted CD8 + cytotoxic cells, both of which type of T cell subsets are present at the lesion.",
