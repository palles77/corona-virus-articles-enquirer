These rapidly elongating cells require tip-focused endomembrane trafficking for the deposition and recycling of proteins, membranes, and cell wall materials. Most of the image-based data published to date are subjective and non-quantified. Quantitative and comparative descriptors of these highly dynamic processes have been a major challenge, but are highly desirable for genetic and chemical genomics approaches to dissect this biological network. To address this problem, we screened for small molecules that perturbed the localization of a marker for the Golgi Ras-like monomeric G-protein RAB2:GFP expressed in transgenic tobacco pollen. Semi-automated high-throughput imaging and image analysis resulted in the identification of novel compounds that altered pollen tube development and endomembrane trafficking. Six compounds that caused mislocalization and varying degrees of altered movement of RAB2:GFP-labeled endomembrane bodies were used to generate a training set of image data from which to quantify vesicle dynamics. The area, velocity, straightness, and intensity of each body were quantified using semi-automated image analysis tools revealing quantitative differences in the phenotype caused by each compound. A score was then given to each compound enabling quantitative comparisons between compounds. Our results demonstrate that image analysis can be used to quantitatively evaluate dynamic subcellular endomembrane phenotypes induced by bioactive chemicals, mutations, or other perturbing agents as part of a strategy to quantitatively dissect the endomembrane network.",

Tip growth requires high levels of tip-focused endomembrane trafficking to deposit lipids, proteins, and cell wall materials to facilitate rapid growth (Hepler et al., 2001) . Pollen tubes must form an elongating tube that travels from the surface of the stigma to deliver the sperm to the ovule (Lord, 2000) . This rapid tip growth is facilitated by the coordination of the actin cytoskeleton and a highly active secretory system (Hepler et al., 2001) .",

When bound to GDP, RABs are inactive; however, when bound to GTP, they are activated and interact with downstream effector proteins (Stenmark and Olkkonen, 2001) . Although many RAB proteins are found in yeast, plants, and mammals, of the three, RAB2 is found only in mammals and plants (Rutherford and Moore, 2002) . The Arabidopsis thaliana ortholog RAB B1 and the mammalian RAB2 are involved with vesicle maturation of the anterograde trafficking pathway from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi stacks and localizes primarily in the Golgi (Rutherford and Moore, 2002) . In Nicotiana tobaccum (tobacco), RAB2 is found predominantly in pollen grains, pollen tubes, and root hairs, probably due to the high secretory demands of the two cell types. Transcripts are detected in floral buds and lateral roots, though this might be due to their presence in pollen and root hairs (Cheung et al., 2002) . When fused to GFP, RAB2 is observed in Golgi stacks that are highly active within the germinating pollen grain as well as the elongating tube (Cheung et al., 2002) . This localization can be exploited to study endomembrane trafficking in a developing pollen tube. Because the ER and Golgi are major components along the secretory pathway, it can be inferred that, if agents such as bioactive small molecules perturb this pathway, global secretion will be significantly impaired, allowing the effect of the small molecules to be identified by microscopy.",

Since endomembrane trafficking is a physical phenomenon that can be observed by microscopy, it can be quantified and subjected to statistical analysis. Indeed, our ability to quantify distribution, sizes, and rates of endomembrane compartments in many organisms and tissue types has been growing over the past two decades (Pyke and Leech, 1991; Derksen et al., 1995; Logan et al., 2003; Rink et al., 2005; Pochynyuk et al., 2007; Ketelaar et al., 2008; Sparkes et al., 2008; Kato et al., 2010; Collinet et al., 2010; Salomon et al., 2010) . Earlier studies used various methods to quantify trafficking that were limited by the available technology. Initial investigations utilized transmission electron microscopy and manual measurement of organelles. This was used to infer growth rates based on mathematical models (Ketelaar et al., 2008) or by calculating organelle distribution (Derksen et al., 1995) . Although informative, these studies observed frozen or fixed tissue rather than live cells, which provide a more accurate depiction of cellular processes.",

To account for this, video data can capture movements and morphological changes of cellular compartments in real time while simultaneously measuring several features in animal cells (Collinet et al., 2010) and endomembrane trafficking in plant pathogen-infected leaf epidermal cells (Salomon et al., 2010) . To visualize and quantify video images from cells displaying rapid growth and highly dynamic trafficking, we used germinating pollen as a model system. Our present study combines quantitative video analysis with bioactive chemicals to rapidly and controllably perturb trafficking, permitting the quantitative and comparative description of compounds affecting intracellular trafficking in pollen grains.",

Classical genetic approaches are limited by functional gene redundancy because mutation of a single gene can result in a lack of phenotype due to compensation. Alternatively, when an essential gene is mutated, embryo lethality can result. These obstacles can be circumvented by a chemical genomics approach that uses small molecules to temporarily modulate protein function. Small molecules often bind to proteins, transiently inhibiting proper function. This marriage of synthetic chemistry and biology coupled with the grand scale of genomics is a powerful approach that produces large amounts of useful phenotypic data prior to genetics (Hicks and Raikhel, 2012) . However, the powers of chemical biology and genetics are both limited by an inability to accurately quantify trafficking processes to obtain objective descriptors to compare the dynamics in the presence of different inhibitors or mutations. For example, due to the high-throughput nature of chemical screening, data analysis should be quantitative and automatable to accommodate large image data sets.",

Compounds were screened for those that inhibited germination or altered tube morphology, both of which are dependent upon proper tip-focused vesicle trafficking. In a developing pollen tube, vesicle traffic follows a distinct reverse fountain flow in which cargo moves towards the growing tip on the sides of the tube and cargo moving from the tip moves down the center of the tube (Pierson and Cresti, 1992) .

Images were collected for each compound, analyzed using the Imaris image analysis software package, and organized into groups that exhibited the same or similar phenotypes ( Figure 1 ). Table 1 shows the number of compounds resulting in each phenotype observed. To focus our efforts on compounds that showed the most dramatic effects, a subgroup of six compounds were selected which caused disruptions in the localization of RAB2:GFP associated with endomembranes ( Figure 2 ). The compounds that comprised this subgroup were termed RAB2 effectors (RAEs). Compared to untreated controls, disruptions in the localization of RAB2:GFP were manifested as agglomerations ( Figure 3 ) which we termed 'RAB2 bodies'. The bodies were presumed to be derived from Golgi stacks and ER. RAEs 6 and 7 elicited similar phenotypes, suggesting a similar mode of action and structure. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis indicated that both RAEs 6 and 7 have a nitro group along with a nitrile group next to a double bond. These compounds disrupted RAB2:GFP movement or localization and therefore globally altered trafficking in the cell, allowing measurement of these changes.",

Our 'difference index' was developed to give an integrated quantitative value to describe the degree to which each compound affected the area, velocity, straightness, and intensity of each agglomeration (Table 2 ). This straightforward index was the sum of the squares of the normalized value for each measure multiplied by an assigned weighting factor. Because it was difficult to determine whether one feature might play a larger role in the identity of a compound, each feature was given equal weight. However, our approach can permit alterations in the weighting of particular phenotypes as necessary.",

            "text": "We utilized tobacco pollen as an efficient system to screen for chemicals that inhibit endomembrane trafficking. In a previous study (Drakakaki et al., 2011) , more than 46 000 chemicals were screened in tobacco pollen. Of these compounds, 360 were found to be bioactive, affecting morphology or development of the pollen tube. Our goal was to utilize this screening system to identify compounds among the 360 that would perturb the secretory pathway in pollen. We reasoned that the tracking of Golgi bodies that were perturbed in movement and other descriptors would offer an ideal model to develop a video-imaging approach to quantify and compare the dynamics of trafficking. Golgi compartments are relatively easy to visualize and are mobile within the pollen grain and tube in this rapidly growing organism. In the past, imaging fixed tissue and single still frame images have limited quantitative studies of endomembrane dynamics. The development of powerful computational tools such as commercially available Imaris image analysis software packages have allowed for the quantification of trafficking parameters in living pollen tubes over time, providing a more accurate measure of in planta conditions. Six compounds were identified that altered the localization and/or movement of RAB2:GFP. Upon quantification of size, velocity, straightness, and intensity, the compounds RAEs 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 formed two phenotypic classes. The first group caused modest changes in size, velocity, straightness, and intensity, whereas the second caused dramatic changes in these descriptors. The first group, which comprised RAEs 1, 2, and 5, resulted in smaller agglomerations whose movement was modestly reduced compared to the untreated controls. This was reflected in their difference indices, which were 1.88, 2.14, and 1.12, respectively. Because this is a relative index, the score of the untreated pollen is 1.00. Greater deviations from 1.00 indicate greater relative differences in dynamics compared to the untreated condition. Interestingly, RAE 5 initially grouped with RAEs 6, 7, and 8 but received a score of 2.12, which grouped it with the weaker compounds RAEs 1 and 2. More specifically, whereas RAE 5 was similar to RAEs 6 and 7 in terms of percent velocity and percent straightness of untreated RAB2 Golgi bodies, it was much similar to RAEs 1 and 3 in terms of percent area of normal RAB2 Golgi bodies and essentially unchanged in percent intensity of normal (Table 2) . RAE 5 RAB2 bodies were of size and intensity similar to the untreated bodies, but were less mobile and directional.",

            "text": "Interestingly, RAEs 6 and 7, two of the more potent compounds, have a nitrile and nitro group in common. The nitrile group can undergo a nucleophilic reaction that is facilitated by the nitro group to irreversibly bind with proteins (Beck, 1978; Habibi et al., 2012) . Likewise, RAE 8 contains a functional group containing N-ethylmaleimide (NEM). NEM is a Michael acceptor, which adds nucleophiles such as the thiols in cysteine residues and is a commonly used cysteine modifier (Crankshaw and Grant, 2001) which could lead to irreversible target binding. This could very well be the case with RAE8. In fact, soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor adaptor protein receptors (SNAREs) are, by definition, sensitive to NEM, suggesting that the target of RAE 8 might conceivably be a specific SNARE (S\u00f6llner et al., 1993) . Because RAE 8 is predicted to be an irreversible inhibitor, Multidimensional Protein Identification Technology (MudPIT) would be a promising approach for target identification. However, it is beyond our scope to develop an image analysis approach to quantify endomembrane dynamics. Although it is intriguing to consider the reversibility and targets of RAEs, this is beyond our goal of developing a technically robust video-imaging tool to quantify trafficking. This approach can be used for the rapid characterization and management of small molecules. This method has the ability to streamline chemical genetic screens and aid in experimental design. It is important to note that other automatic or semi-automatic image acquisition modalities can be used as well as freely available image analysis software. When analyzing data, the limitations of scale are determined by the resolution of the image and the frame rate at which the video data were collected, not necessarily the image analysis software. One advantage of our approach to classifying small molecules is the difference score. This will help facilitate the classification of compounds into meaningful clusters based on bioactivity as a quantitative measure of vesicle dynamics (Drakakaki et al., 2011) . Though each feature value was given equal weight, one could increase the weight of any given feature, tailoring this score to any application. However, the difference index can only take into account phenotypes that can be quantified and the number of features measured determines the usefulness and flexibility. In addition, the score is highly dependent on the control phenotype and can only describe changes in preexisting conditions. It is not helpful in describing new phenotypes that were not represented in the control condition.",
