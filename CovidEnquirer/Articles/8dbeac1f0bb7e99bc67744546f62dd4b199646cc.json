The results show that (IP) cocaine significantly increased vlNAcc DA release (p < 0.0001) and 5-HT release (p < 0.0012). Each of the four parameters of cocaine-induced psychostimulant behavior was concurrently and significantly increased as well (ambulations: p < 0.0001; rearing: p < 0.0008; stereotypy: p < 0.0004; central ambulations: p < 0.0082). Moreover, exactly coincident data points for DA and 5-HT release occurred 10 and 40 rain after (IP) cocaine administration. Cocaine-induced DA and 5-HT release were highly and positively correlated during the first hour of study (p < 0.01). As expected, increased DA release in vlNAcc after cocaine administration was significantly and positively correlated with classically DA-dependent behaviors (first-and second-hour effects) (p < 0.01) and with the 5-HT-ergic behavior, central ambulations (/7 < 0.01). Also, cocaine-induced 5-HT release was significantly and positively correlated with 5-HT behavior (/7 < 0.01). However, not as expected, classically DA-dependent behaviors were more positively correlated with cocaineinduced 5-HT release in vlNAcc throughout the two-hour period of study. Thus, the present findings show that 5-HT is a comediator with DA in the cocaine response in vlNAcc. Importantly, 5-HT may signal the known DA response to cocaine.",

            "text": "Serotonin Ventrolateral nucleus accumbens (vlNAcc) Anxiety Agoraphobia THE relevance of A~0 nucleus accumbens (NAcc) dopaminergic (DAergic) function to brain reward seems sufficiently explicit. Particularly, in paradigms of classical self-stimulation reinforcement phenomena two distinct models for the neuronal modus operandi of DA in the acute reinforcement process have been proposed. The first has been called \"the two neuron\" model, in which descending medial forebrain bundle (MFB) fibres synapse in A~0 somatodendrites, ventral tegmental area (VTA), and subsequently give rise to ascending projections to NAcc the reward signal (56, 64) . In the second model, the \"modulatory model,\" the reward signal may be carried by non-DAergic fibres via an oblique rather than direct Am0 neuronal pathway from A~0 somatodendritic VTA to nerve terminal NAcc (23, 65; cf. 58 for review). Interestingly, the relevance of DAergic functionality in A~0 circuits to cocaine-induced brain reward also seems explicit. The first studies to describe this cocaine-Al0-DA relationship (52, 53) precede several studies of supporting evidence, predicated on the acute (single dose) effects of cocaine in NAcc (6,7,29,34,62; cf. 33 for review), and also precede evidence for an acute cocaine-DA functionality in A~0 somato-dendrites, VTA as well (3, 8, 11, 21, 46) .",

            "text": "At first glance, since only the neurotransmitter DA is involved in these previous studies, acute cocaine brain reward could be analogous to the \"two neuron\" model of brain reward. New neurochemical data, though, implicate serotonin (5-HT) as a co-modulator mechanism for the SC and IV cocaine-induced DAergic response in A~0 neuronal circuits (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . Moreover, electrophysiological studies show a role for a 5-HT-ergic mediation in the mechanism of action of acutely administered cocaine (16, 17, 20, 42, 62) . Other studies have assayed acute cocaine-induced 5-HT-ergic effects on reuptake processes, in vitro (22, 31, 54, 55) ; release processes, in vivo (7); behavior, in vivo (18, 47, 48) ; and synthesis processes post mortern (24) . Furthermore, there is evidence that acute iontophoretic applications of DA and 5-HT in combination more efficiently mimic the effect of cocaine on NAcc neurons than application of either DA or 5-HT alone (63) . Thus, a concept of acute cocaine-induced brain reward encompassing a 5-HTergic component is unfolding. Such a concept could interestingly be analogous to the \"modulatory model\" of brain reward.",

Provocatively, the noted abrupt rise and fall in each of the cocaine-induced psychostimulant behaviors occurred when 5-HT release underwent a divergence in direction from concurrent DA release.

Using light microscopic immunocytochemistry and silver intensification procedures, with anterograde and retrograde tracing tract studies, we have found in vlNAcc a core which contains a dense terminal field of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)that is, TH-IR axons that have an extensive overlap with 5-HT-IR axons in the periphery within the core (45) . Thus, a DA-5-HT-ergic interaction may play a critical role in cocaine's manipulation of the compensatory negative feedback pathway between vlNAcc and VTA in the A10 circuit. A likely scenario mechanistically for enhanced 5-HT release in vlNAcc after (IP) cocaine, may be compensatory negative feedback due to decreased 5-HT cell firing in DR (16, 17) . Alternatively, a cocaine-induced 5-HT reuptake inhibition, combined with the increased release of 5-HT at vlNAc\u00a2, may stimulate autoreceptors that act presynaptically at 5-HT somatodendrites to decrease DR cell firing.",

Psychostimulant behaviors have been termed dysfunctional, nonadaptive, composite aggregates of subsystems which mediate movement along independent spatial dimensions (61) . In this view, psychostimulant behaviors occur as a result of the initial activation and then deactivation of DAerglc systems. However, in another view, the neurotransmitter DA functions in mesolimbic and nigrostriatal neuronal circuitry differentially; locomotor activity is primarily controlled by NAcc (ventral striatum) and stereotypic fine movements are primarily controlled by dorsal striatum (51) . Placing the present findings within the latter framework, cocaine induced an increase in DA release in vlNAcc that was correlated as expected with cocaine-induced increased locomotor activity. Correspondingly, cocaine-induced maladaptive rearing behavior and stereotypic fine movement behavior were correlated with increased DA release as well. This response too was expected (i.e., based on the postulated partial mediation of these behaviors by NAcc). Also, predictably, the behavioral profiles for the classically DA-dependent behaviors (running, rearing, and fine movement behaviors) are remarkably similar. Indeed, the behaviorai profiles for rearing and fine movement are superimposable, differing only in degree, thereby supporting the concept of rearing as a simple vertical extension of a maladaptive head movement (61) .",
