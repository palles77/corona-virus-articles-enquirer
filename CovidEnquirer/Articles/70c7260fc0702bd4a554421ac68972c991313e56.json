Analysis of allele 60 effects revealed that the founder PWK/PhJ was the main driver of low SARS-CoV titer in the 61 lung ( Fig. 1A) , and PWK/PhJ also had lower titers than any other founder strain at four DPI 62 (Gralinski et al., 2015) . We therefore used private SNPs or In/Dels found in PWK/PhJ to reduce 63 the potential targets in the QTL to seven ncRNAs and 74 genes for downstream analysis. 64",

Sixty seven preCC mice had both 66 microarray and titer data available, of which sixty had titers above the limit of detection 67 (Gralinski et al., 2015) . Of the 74 candidate genes, 54 had one or more probes on the 68 microarray (Table S4) Table S5 ). Using 70 infection data from the founder mice, Muc4 RNA expression levels mimicked the allelic effects 71 of the QTL with PWK/PhJ mice exhibiting low Muc4 RNA levels (Fig. 1C ). Other potential 72 targets included Lrrc33, Sec22a, Parp14, and Ildr1; however, these genes either have little 73 known linkage to viral replication and the immune response (e.g., Lrrc33, Sec22a, and Ildr1) or 74 the directionality of the correlation did not support their relationship to viral titer in the lung 75 (Parp14). For Muc4, high levels of expression at mucosal surfaces and in various human 76 cancers have been reported (Andrianifahanana et al., 2001; Chaturvedi et al., 2008; Kamikawa 77 et al., 2015) . In addition, Muc4 plays a role in cell and anti-apoptotic signaling (Chaturvedi et al., 78 2008; Funes et al., 2006; Moniaux et al., 2007) . Together, the data suggest that Muc4 may play 79 a role in viral titers at day 4 post SARS-CoV infection. 80",

In contrast, Muc4 -/mice have augmented disease early 154 during infection, displaying a biphasic swelling pattern. At days 2-4, both male and female mice 155 have increased footpad swelling compared to control mice.

In contrast, mice with the C56BL/6J allele were 204 associated with high titer and high expression of Muc4. Furthermore, PWK/PhJ mice encode 205 functional variants in Muc4 that are not present in the other seven founder strains. It is 206 therefore possible that C57BL/6 genetic background for the Muc4 -/mice, as opposed to a 207 PWK/PhJ background, obfuscated any role for Muc4 in the regulation of viral titer; this possibility 208 is especially relevant given that the hypothesized role of Muc4 is in the context of complex 209 signaling pathways requiring multiple molecular partners, rather than a direct role such as the 210 physical barrier function of mucins. Alternatively, Muc4 may simply not impact viral titer following 211 SARS-CoV infection; this leaves the possibility that other genetic targets within the chromosome 212 16 QTL are responsible for limiting SARS-CoV titers at later time points. Furthermore, the 213 existence of multiple titer-driven QTLs reaffirms that no single gene is expected to serve as the 214 sole driver of SARS-CoV titer. Yet, despite the lack of QTL validation, these studies still 215 identified a role for Muc4 in viral pathogenesis. 216 A surprising outcome from these studies was the demonstration of sex-specific and 217 increased disease severity in Muc4 -/female mice infected with SARS-CoV. Females lacking 218 Muc4 consistently demonstrated increased susceptibility to SARS-CoV-induced disease, while 219 males did not. These results affirm the National Institute of Health emphasis on conducting 220 animal studies in both male and female subjects (Clayton and Collins, 2014; National Institutes 221 of Health, 2015).

SARS-CoV 234 infection of female Muc4 -/mice, and CHIKV infection of both male and female Muc4 -/mice, 235 resulted in more severe disease following infection. For SARS-CoV, loss of Muc4 exacerbated 236 weight loss and increased lethality; surprisingly, less histopathologic damage was observed in 237 the Muc4 -/lungs following infection despite augmented inflammatory cytokines. The results 238 suggest that the loss of Muc4 may exacerbate systemic disease and delay the repair/recovery 239 processing in the lung following SARS-CoV infection.
