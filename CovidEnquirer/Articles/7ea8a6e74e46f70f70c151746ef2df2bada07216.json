(d) Ubc, a housekeeping gene involved in cellular ubiqutination, was used as a positive control of staining. Dapb, a gene from E. coli, was used as a negative control (data not shown). Supplementary Figure 8. WNV infection of different neurons in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum from brains of wild-type and Ifnar -/mice. Brains from wild type and Ifnar -/-C57BL/6 mice were harvested at day 6 (wild type) or day 4 (Ifnar -/-) after i.c. infection with 10 1 PFU of WNV. Viral titer was measured by plaque-forming assay on BHK21-15 cells. Solid lines represent the median viral titers and reflect data from six to ten mice per genotype. Supplementary Figure 9. Infection of neurons in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum from brains of fatal human WNV cases. Brain sections from seven fatal human cases of WNV encephalitis were stained with rat anti-WNV antisera (brown) or pre-immune sera. Infected CN and Purkinje neurons of the cerebellum are indicated by white arrows and black arrow heads, respectively. Insets are high-power images of each case.
