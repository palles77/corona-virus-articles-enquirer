            "text": "Electron Probe Analysis. Medical microprobe analysis is usually accomplished on an electron microscope equipped with an energy dispersive x-ray spectrometer. This type of analysis is commonly referred to as electron probe x-ray microanalysis. All elements with an atomic number equal to or greater than beryllium can be detected and usually quantitated. 2 Although microprobe analysis was initially used primarily as a research tool, this is no longer the case. Microprobe findings now have diagnostic, therapeutic, a n d / o r legal significance. 3 For example, the identification and characterization of intrapulmonary deposits is important not only in determining a patient's diagnosis, but also in some instances as a source of evidence for medicolegal situations. Accurate identification of the material involved may allow recognition of sources of exposure and lead to measures to reduce exposure and prevent the possibility of harm to others. Thus microprobe analysis can be an important tool in occupational medicine and public health. Currently the most commonly studied clinical conditions include the pneumoconioses, especially asbestosis and related conditions such as mesotheliomas (Fig 1) , \"hard metal\" pulmonary fibrosis, and other mineral-induced pneumoconioses.4, 5",
