The emerging SARS-CoV-2, a beta coronavirus, can cause COVID-19, officially named by the World Health Organization (WHO) on February 11, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 is highly infectious; the entire population is generally susceptible, and respiratory droplets and contact are the main routes of transmission. 3, 4 Patients usually have a history of epidemiological exposure. Maternal and neonatal infections have been reported, with the youngest reported so far only 30 h old in China. Aerosol particles carrying viruses may be another way of transmission, and there is still no evidence of vertical mother-to-fetus intrauterine transmission. 5 It is generally believed that the incubation period is between 3 and 7 days on average, with 1 day as the shortest and 14 days longest. 3,6",

Most infected children have mild clinical manifestations, and the prognosis is good. Most of the pediatric patients have recovered within 1-2 weeks after onset. It is very uncommon to progress to lower respiratory tract infections. Data from adults showed that severe cases tend to have difficulty breathing 1 week after the onset of the disease. 3 Severe cases can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, refractory metabolic acidosis, and coagulation dysfunction, but such severity is rare in children. 3, 8 The first pediatric critically ill patient was reported from Wuhan Children's Hospital. 8 The 1-year-old boy was admitted because of intermittent diarrhea, vomiting for 6 days, and fever with shortness of breath for half a day. On the second and the seventh days of admission, the pharyngeal swab SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid test was negative, but the test was positive on the eighth day. The child's chest radiographs showed pneumonia in the right lung on the day of admission. The child was immediately sent to the intensive care unit and intubated. The patient's condition improved and was successfully weaned off from the ventilator on the 10th day of admission. The patient eventually recovered fully. From the report, it is apparent that children remain susceptible to the infection, and severe infection could occur.",

However, a study of nine pregnant women with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 pneumonia suggested that there is currently no evidence of intrauterine infection caused by vertical transmission from mother to child. 10 Newborns may still acquire a SARS-CoV-2 infection through close contact with infected mothers. The diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 neonatal infection should meet all of the following criteria: (1) at least one clinical symptom, including unstable body temperature, low activity or poor feeding, or shortness of breath, (2) chest radiographs showing abnormalities, including unilateral or bilateral milled glass opacities, (3) a SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosis in the patient's family or caregivers, and (4) close contact with people who may have or have confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, patients with unexplained pneumonia, or wild animals in the animal market or wild animals. All possible or laboratory-confirmed neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infections should be admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. The efficacy of antiviral drugs is uncertain in children, and antimicrobial agents are only applicable to patients with possible or proven bacterial infections. If newbornsalso present with respiratory distress syndrome, administration of high-dose pulmonary surfactant, nitric oxide inhalation, and high-frequency oscillatory ventilation should be considered. In critically ill newborns, intravenous administration of glucocorticoids or immunoglobulins, sustainable kidney replacement, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation may also be considered. 11",
