Daily injections of CsA (50 mg/kg) inhibited the expression of the MHV3-induced ependymitis, meningitis. hydrocephalus and vasculitis, The effect was preserved even if CsA treatment was initiated 15 days after virus infection but was lost if CsA treatment was given later on or for a shorter period of time. Viral titers in brains of chronically infected mice were not affected by CsA treatment. During the first week following MHV3 infection, CsA treatment increased both the percentage of acute death (31 vs. 10%) and the viral titers in brain and liver of infected mice. In this model, the timing of CsA treatment appeared critical for the balance between its beneficial effect on CNS lesions and the risk of increased acute mortality.",

These differences, although statistically significant, were not as dramatic as in other experimental models testing CsA effect on acute viral diseases. Thus, when BALB/c mice were infected with herpes virus type 2, the acute mortality increased from 20% in control infected animals to 90-100% in CsA-treated mice (Armending, 1982a, b) . A similar increase in acute mortality after CsA treatment was observed in mice suffering from myocarditis after coxsackie B3 infection (O'Connell, 1986) or from interstitial pneumonia after vesicular stomatitis virus infection (Charan, 1986) . On the other hand, CsA treatment did not modify acute mortality and/or virus titer in organs of mice infected either by influenzae (Schiltlmecht, 1985) , mouse cytomegalovirus (Gui, 1982) or lymphochoriomeningitis virus (Loliger, 1985) . Gathering these different experimental data, variations in the effect of CsA on an acute viral infection might depend upon (a) the mechanism of the virus-induced lesions: CsA appears to decrease lesions induced by an acute post-viral immune response (Loliger, 1985) but to increase acute cytopathogenie lesions due to the viral replication itself (Chaaran, 1986; O'Connell, 1986) ; (b) the dose of CsA used: CsA titers in blood, however, were usually not available in previous experimental reports; (c) the timing of CsA treatment: death rate increased significantly only if CsA treatment was 55 started at the same time as the virus injection, as we observed in the present report. These different factors have to be carefully analyzed to evaluate the benefits and risks of a CsA treatment during human inflammatory diseases potentially induced by a viral infection.",

On the other hand, long-term CsA or olive oil treatment of uninfected animals induced a mortality rate of 13 and 8%, respectively.

            "text": "The neuropathological consequences of MHV3 infection (meningitis, hydrocephalus and vasculitis) were absent in 93~ of CsA-treated mice compared to 36% of untreated mice. During the chronic CNS infection induced by MHV3, the meningitis and the later appearing vasculitis reflect the intracerebral hyperimmune response induced by viral inoculation. This post-viral immune response is in part under T cell control as judged by its suppression by cyclophosphamide (Tardieu, 1982) or CsA (present report). Physiopathologic mechanisms leading to development of hydrocephalus are still unclear: the high affinity of MHV3 for ependymal cells (Tardieu, 1986 ) suggests a poten-tial direct effect of the virus on ependymal cells. Moreover, cyelophosphamide in spite of its inhibitory effect on meningitis had no effect on hydrocephalus (Tardieu, 1982) suggesting that meningitis is not the main cause of hydrocephalus. The efficacity of CsA to suppress hydrocephalus development in MHV3-infected mice is particularly striking when CsA treatment is started at the same time as virus injection. This suggests that ependymitis, which participates in hydrocephalus formation may depend for its induction not only on the direct effect of the virus on ependymal cells but also on an early cytotoxic immune response against virus-infected cells. Outside the CNS, a previous report showed that CsA treatment can reduce the chronic inflammation of lungs induced by influenza A virus with a concomitant alteration of the delayed-type hypersensitivity against the virus (Schiltknecht, 1985) . In the CNS an effect of CsA on chronic immune response has been suggested by the inhibitory effect of CsA on the expression of experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE) (Armending, 1982a, b) and by the inhibitory effect of CsA on inflammation and demyelination in the spinal cord of mice persistently infected with Theiler murine encephalomyelitis virus (Rodriguez, 1986) . In this last experimental model, the decreased demyelination correlated with a decreased proliferation of T lymphocytes to virus and myefin antigens.",
