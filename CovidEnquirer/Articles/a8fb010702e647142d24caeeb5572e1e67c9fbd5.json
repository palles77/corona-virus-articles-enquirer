Additionally, the increases observed in circulating levels of the HMGB1 protein were positively correlated with the severity of the disease in human and animal models. Complete inhibition or neutralization of HMGB1 may attenuate the severity of these diseases, decrease the incidence of organ dysfunction and improve survival, and consequently there is a burgeoning interest in HMGB1 as a therapeutic target. Among the strategies investigated, agents which bind to HMGB1 and neutralize its activity, including antibodies raised against HMGB1 and molecules which inhibit HMGB1 activation or its interaction with specific receptors, are gathering attention.",

            "text": "HMGB1 has two separate and characteristic DNA-binding domains, termed the HMG A and B boxes. Each domain contains ~80 amino acid residues with a of molecular mass of ~10 kDa. The B box domain contains the pro-inflammatory cytokine functionality of the molecule, whereas the A box region exerts an antagonistic, anti-inflammatory effect, and is a putative therapeutic target (7) . The purified A box has been identified as an antagonist of the pro-inflammatory actions of the HMGB1 B box, since it competes with HMGB1 for receptor activation and attenuates the HMGB1-induced release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (6) . The HMGB1 A box markedly ameliorated damage status. For example, the administration of the HMGB1 A box in a mouse model of transient coronary vessel occlusion was associated with a marked attenuation of tissue damage, whereas systemically administered recombinant HMGB1 protein increased the severity of the damage by an appreciable extent (14) . The administration of the A box markedly enhanced cardiac allograft survival, and it was associated with reduced levels of expression of tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interferon (IFN)-\u03b3 and HMGB1 in allografts (13) . The administration of the HMGB1 A box protein to wild-type mice, into which HMGB1 had been injected directly into the hippocampus, led to a marked attenuation in HMGB1-induced seizure severity (15) . In a model which emulated collagen-induced arthritis inflammation, the damage was markedly attenuated by inhibitors of HMGB1, including anti-HMGB1 antibodies and HMGB1 A box protein (11) . Additionally, the administration of the A box afforded a high level of protection against sepsis lethality, reduced the mean arthritis score, and circumvented disease-induced weight loss and the histological severity of arthritis (16) . Consequently, counteracting extracellular HMGB1 with its specific antagonist, the HMGB1 A box, may offer a novel method for therapeutic intervention.",

SUMO and its associated enzymes are present in all eukaryotes, and are highly conserved from yeast to humans, although they are absent in prokaryotes (19) (20) (21) . SUMO, fused at the N-terminus with heterologous proteins, was revealed to improve the folding of the protein of interest, to enhance its level of expression and to protect the protein from degradation via its chaperoning properties (22, 23) .

To assess the anti-inflammatory function of the HMGB1 A box following its expression and purification, the cell viability was evaluated following LPS treatment with or without HMGB1-A-Box incubation. After treatment with 20 \u00b5g/ml LPS for 1 h, the HMGB1-A-BOX protein at final concentrations of 100 and 200 \u00b5g/ml were added into the experimental groups and incubated for 2, 6, 12, 24 or 48 h.

By contrast, the cell viability was gradually increased over time on addition of the HMGB1-A-BOX protein, and this increase was dose-dependent (Fig. 3) (16) . Furthermore, HMGB1 protein released by LPS-activated RAW 264.7 cells has been demonstrated to stimulate macrophages to release TNF\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 (12) . Therefore, an objective of the present study was to observe the effect of the purified HMGB1-A-BOX protein on the levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 stimulated by LPS/HMGB1 in the supernatant.

The maximum inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 was achieved following 48 h incubation with HMGB1-A-BOX and reached ~30.20% (P<0.05; Table I ).

However, the size of the SUMO-fused HMGB1-A-BOX protein, as determined by SDS-PAGE analysis, appeared to be marginally larger than the predicted size. The possible explanation for this phenomenon may be attributable to the SUMO protein itself: SUMO is a ubiquitin-like protein, which is able to form tertiary structures with itself (17), which consequently leads to increases in molecular weight. This was commonly observed when other SUMO-fusion proteins were being expressed. The sought-after target protein, HMGB1-A-BOX, is a low-molecular-weight protein of ~10 kDa. SUMO proteases have been observed to successfully cleave a broad range of sizes (6-110 kDa) of partner proteins fused to SUMO (17) . The achievement in obtaining purified HMGB1-A-BOX protein with the SUMO-fusion expression system used in the present study also supported the capability of this expression system to accommodate SUMO fusion partner proteins.",

            "text": "Since the A box region of HMGB1 exerts an antagonistic, anti-inflammatory effect with therapeutic potential, the ultimate goal for expressing and purifying HMGB1-A-BOX is for therapeutic interventions. The production of therapeutic proteins is required to be rapid, efficient and cost-effective. Furthermore, tags should be removed in order that the protein activity is neither attenuated nor modified. Different methods used in preliminary investigations to express the HMGB1-A-BOX protein failed to yield satisfactory results (data not shown). The yields of the HMGB1-A-BOX fusion protein obtained with a glutathione S-transferase (GST) tag were acceptable, although removal of the GST tag affected the activity of the target protein. Expressing the target protein without a GST tag led to low solubility. One advantage of the SUMO-fusion technology used in the present study is that 10.8 mg soluble HMGB1-A-BOX protein of a purity >90% was obtained from 15 l bacterium solution. SUMO fusion was reported to enhance protein expression, solubility and purification in prokaryotes (22) . This fusion technology is able to improve the expression of the recombinant proteins by protecting them from degradation. In addition, SUMO has an external hydrophilic surface and inner hydrophobic core, Table I . Effect of the HMGB1-A-BOX protein on the levels of TNF\u03b1 in the supernatant (pg/ml).

Furthermore, the presence of the His-tag on SUMO and the SUMO protease provides a simplified means of purification to obtain high levels of the target proteins. Notably, the lack of an endogenous SUMO protease in prokaryotes facilitated the use of SUMO as a purification tag in E. coli. SUMO proteases are accurate and efficient agents at cleaving the SUMO tag and in allowing for retention of the desired N-terminus, without the extraneous residues, which are usually produced by other proteases, since SUMO proteases recognize the tertiary structure of the SUMO tag instead of peptide sequences. The use of the SUMO-fusion expression system in the present study has overcome several problems, including low protein yield, precipitation of the target protein and a failure to recover active, structurally intact protein.",

A previous study has reported that the recombinant HMGB1-A-BOX protein may attenuate the development of the inflammatory disease, thromboangiitis obliterans, in rat models, which provided further evidence that HMGB1-A-BOX may be a putative therapeutic protein for the treatment of certain inflammatory diseases (25) . Furthermore, the truncation of HMGB1 into individual structural domains revealed that HMGB1-A-box, a DNA-binding motif, specifically antagonizes the activity of HMGB1 and rescues mice from lethal sepsis (9) . Accordingly, strategies that target HMGB1 with specific antibodies or antagonists are potentially useful as therapies for lethal systemic inflammatory disease. The recombinant A box of HMGB1 obtained with SUMO fusion technology in the present study was demonstrated to attenuate the levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in the supernatant, and to ameliorate LPS-impaired cell viability. In addition, this technology has allowed the production of active HMGB1-A-BOX protein with a high yield and purity, which is valuable for producing high levels of this target protein for subsequent therapeutic studies.",
