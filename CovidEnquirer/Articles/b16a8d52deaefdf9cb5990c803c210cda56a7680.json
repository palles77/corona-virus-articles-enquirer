The Spike (S) protein is one of the main structural proteins of PEDV capable of inducing neutralizing antibodies in vivo. Herein, we generated three distinct DNA constructs in the eukaryotic expression plasmid pVAX1; one encoding the S protein [pVAX1-(PEDV-S)], the second encoding the N-terminal fragment (S1) [pVAX1-(PEDV-S1)] containing potent antigenic sites, and the third expressing the porcine interleukin-18 (pIL-18) [pVAX1-(IL-18)]. Immunofluorescence assays in BHK-21 cells demonstrated successful protein expression from all 3 constructs. Kunming mice were injected separately with each of these constructs or with a pVAX1-(PEDV-S1)/pVAX1-(IL-18) combination, an attenuated PEDV vaccine, or vector only control. Animals were examined for T lymphocyte proliferation, anti-PEDV antibodies, IFN-\u2425 and IL-4 protein levels, and cytotoxic T cell function in mouse peripheral blood and spleen. In all cases, results showed that pVAX1-(PEDV-S) and the combination of pVAX1-(PEDV-S1) with pVAX1-(IL-18) induced the strongest responses; however, pIL-18 had no adjuvant effects when given in combination with pVAX1-(PEDV-S1).",

The disease was first reported in England in 1971 (Oldham, 1972) . It has since been reported in many areas worldwide. The first link between the disease and the PEDV was identified in 1977 (Pensaert and Bouck, 1978) . The virus is an enveloped coronavirus with a positive-stranded RNA genome that encodes four major structural proteins; spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M) and envelope (E) proteins. Although conventional inactivated and attenuated vaccines are widely used in some areas in China, such vaccines have some drawbacks such as recovery of virulence, spread of viruses, high cost and poor protection efficacy. Therefore, development of novel and effective vaccines is necessary for control of PED.",

The N-terminal portion of the S protein of several coronaviruses has been shown to contain key antigenic sites responsible for eliciting humoral and cellular immune responses (Delmas et al., 1986; Gebauer et al., 1991) .

A sense primer P1 (5 -GGGGGGATCCATGAGGTCTTTAATTTAC), and two antisense primers P2 (CCCCGAATTCTTAAATACTCATACTAAA) and P3 (5 -CCCCGAATTCTCATCTCTGCACGTGGAC) which contain BamHI (P1) and EcoRI (P2 and P3) restriction enzyme sites (underlined), were used for PCR. The amplification profile for the full length S gene (primers P1/P2) was as follows: 95 \u2022 C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 94 \u2022 C for 2.5 min, 56.8 \u2022 C for 2.5 min, and 72 \u2022 C for 5 min. A final extension of 72 \u2022 C for 10 min was performed at the end of the cycling period. The amplification profile for PEDV-S1 gene (primers P1/P3) was the same as for the PEDV-S gene except that the annealing temperature was raised to 54.8 \u2022 C. Plasmid pUC18-(IL-18) containing the full-length swine interleukin 18 gene was used as template for PCR. The sense and antisense primers P4 (5 -GGGGGGATCCATGTACTTTGGCAAGCTT) and P5 (5 -CCCCGAATTCCTAGTTCTTGTTTTGAACA) included BamHI and EcoRI restriction enzyme sites (underlined), respectively. The PCR profiles included 95 \u2022 C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 94 \u2022 C for 0.5 min, 56.5 \u2022 C for 0.5 min, and 72 \u2022 C for 1 min followed by a final extension of 72 \u2022 C for 10 min. All PCR products were purified, restriction enzyme digested and ligated into the similarly digested eukaryotic expression vector, pVAX1 (Invitrogen, USA). After transformation, clones were picked and validated by DNA sequencing. The plasmids were designated pVAX1-(PEDV-S), pVAX1-(PEDV-S1) and pVAX1-(IL-18), respectively.",

Furthermore, in porcine mucosal tissues IL-18 may advance immune responses to invading pathogens (Foss et al., 2001) . As such, we hypothesized that IL-18 might act as a suitable adjuvant to help protect against a Th1 inducing pathogen, i.e. PEDV. For this reason, we evaluated synergistic effects between the PEDV-S1 and pIL-18 by means of DNA vaccination. Preliminary experiments demonstrated via immunofluorescence assays that the cloned and transiently transfected S and S1 genes along with the pIL-18 gene were indeed capable of expressing the protein constructs in BHK-21 mouse cells.",

In this study, spleen and blood-derived lymphocytes from immunized mice clearly showed that co-immunization with pVAX1-(PEDV-S1) and pVAX1-(IL-18) significantly induced T cell proliferation relative to controls (<0.01). Cytotoxic T-cell activity was also validated indirectly by monitoring cell lysis through increased LDH levels resulting from damaged cells (Yokozawa et al., 2000) . Elevated LDH levels were observed in all but control treatments where the highest activities occurred in pVAX1-(PEDV-S1) and pVAX1-(IL-18) immunized mice. Changes in the serum IgG levels in particular between 7 and 35 dpi clearly showed that the plasmid constructs induced effective humoral responses capable of neutralizing the virus and that this neutralizing effect was strongest for the full-length S protein. However, unexpectedly, functioned only in tandem with pVAX1-(PEDV-S1) to affect both proliferative and virus neutralizing responses but exerted no adjuvant effects. This is likely the result of different and unrelated mechanisms that gave rise to these changes.",

It is still unclear as to why such a deviation from the norm occurred here; however, some studies suggest that the level of infection and therefore the level of antigen presentation can affect Th1/Th2 profiles (Claerebout et al., 2005) . These data in conjunction with virus neutralization studies suggest that IFN-\u2425 does not play a major role in protection.",
