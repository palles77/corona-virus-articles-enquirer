In a retrospective study of foals with diarrhea presented to the University of Florida, rotavirus was the most frequently detected infectious agent (20% of cases). 20 Equine rotaviruses only cause clinical disease in foals and are considered primarily species specific; for example, cattle rotavirus affects cattle and not horses or humans. However, a recent report suggested that an unusual equine strain (H-1) may have originated from a porcine rotavirus strain that was transmitted to horses because at least 9 of 11 of its gene segments were found to be of porcine virus origin. 21 No natural reservoir for equine rotavirus has been identified. Mares may shed the virus subclinically, although this is transient and not considered to be as significant in magnitude as from diarrheic foals. 22 Considering the large concentrations of virus shed into the environment (10 11 particles/g feces) by diarrheic animals, as well as the ability of the virus to remain viable for as long as 9 months, 23 the potential for an outbreak after the first clinical case is very real.",

Omeprazole oral paste (GastroGard, Merial, Duluth, GA) facilitates healing of equine gastric ulcers and is approved for treatment of foals greater than or equal to 4 weeks of age but has been studied and can be used in younger foals. 40, 41 Other antiulcer medications include H2 antagonists such as ranitidine (6.6 mg/kg PO q8h), famotidine (2.8 mg/kg PO q12h), or cimetidine (12-20 mg/kg PO q8h). However, ranitidine has exhibited a blunted duration of alkalinizing response in clinically ill neonatal foals. 42 Ranitidine has some prokinetic properties and should be used with caution in foals with dysmotility. Sucralfate can also be used (20 mg/kg PO q6-8h) to potentially promote ulcer healing. Because sucralfate may inhibit the absorption of other oral medications, it should not be administered at the same time as other drugs. 43 Supportive care and hygiene are critically important for foals with rotaviral diarrhea to avoid pressure ulcers, scalded perianal skin, and secondary infections. Foals recumbent in soiled surroundings are predisposed to secondary problems such as infected skin wounds and pneumonia. Stalls should be kept as dry and clean as possible and should be heavily bedded.

It is labeled for treatment of diarrhea caused by Cryptosporidium and Giardia infections in humans older than 1 year of age. A randomized clinical trial showed that NTZ decreased the duration of rotaviral diarrhea in hospitalized pediatric human patients. 44 However, diarrhea and colitis are risks associated with NTZ use in horses, and it should therefore be used with extreme caution until further studied.",

            "text": "Since 1996, the Equine Rotavirus Vaccine (Pfizer Animal Health, Madison, NJ) has been marketed under conditional license (U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA]). The vaccine contains an inactivated strain of a G3 equine rotavirus serotype (H2 strain or G3P [12] ) in a metabolizable oil-in-water adjuvant. 11 This vaccine is administered intramuscularly to pregnant mares at 8, 9, and 10 months of gestation to heighten colostral immunity. Each pregnancy requires revaccination with 3 doses. This vaccine has been utilized extensively in equine intensive locales in central Kentucky, Florida, Newmarket in the United Kingdom (UK), and other major breeding centers in the United States, UK, and Ireland. Antirotaviral antibodies are concentrated in colostrum and absorbed by suckling foals. 11, 12 In one study, foals of 100 vaccinated and 65 unvaccinated mares were studied. Vaccinated mares had received an inactivated rotavirus (G3P2, G3P12, and G6P1) vaccine at 9 and 10 months of gestation. The morbidity of diarrhea was 30% in foals born to vaccinated mares, in contrast to 80% in foals from unvaccinated mares. Duration of diarrhea was shorter in foals in the vaccinated mare group (1.8 days versus 7.3 days). Importantly, there was 0% shedding detected in the diarrheic foals born to vaccinated mares, as opposed to 80% shedding in the diarrheic foals for enteric pathogens, and viral particles were not observed on EM. Coronavirus was identified in intestinal tissues of the foal by immunohistochemistry using BCV-specific monoclonal antibodies and in feces using an antigen-capture ELISA designed for BCV detection, indicating a lack of sensitivity of EM in this case. 47, 53 The foal's serum antibody titer to BCV increased over an 8-day period from 1 : 25 to 1 : 100. 2 Despite the reports of probable coronavirus infection in foals, there were no definitive descriptions of ECoV isolation from sick horses before 2000. 47, 63, 64, 69, 70 The first isolation and characterization was described in 2000 from the feces of a 2-week-old Arabian foal. 53, 75 The foal had diarrhea and fever, which persisted for 6 days, after which the foal recovered with medical treatment.",

Seven percent (7/96) of clinically healthy horses on the premises were fecal positive. 74 The most common clinical signs were anorexia (88%), lethargy (78%), and fever (73%). 74 Other signs included changes in fecal character (soft-formed to watery) and colic, but these were in a minority of horses. The morbidity ranged from 20% to 57% on affected premises. Clinical signs resolved in most horses within 1 to 4 days. Approximately 6.8% of horses were euthanized because of the severity of clinical signs, including acute neurologic disease or marked endotoxemia. Common hematologic changes included leukopenia with neutropenia and/or lymphopenia. Shedding in feces generally occurred for a few days. In this report, follow-up fecal samples were available for seven horses, and PCR detection of ECoV persisted for 3-9 days. 74 A recent coronavirus outbreak occurred in Japan, involving 204/650 (31%) horses. 76 Fever was found in 96% of horses, and only 13% developed diarrhea and/or colic. Most horses recovered in 2-4 days, except for those with watery diarrhea which took 5-10 days. Two horses (0.98%) with watery diarrhea and stomatitis died.

Virus replication in vivo can be either disseminated, causing systemic infections, or restricted to a few cell types, often the epithelial cells of the respiratory or enteric tract and macrophages, causing localized infections. Coronavirus replication takes place in the cytoplasm of infected cells. 52 Like rotavirus, coronavirus causes damage to the villi of the intestinal mucosa, resulting in loss of absorptive capacity, leading to a malabsorptive diarrhea. The course of disease is typically initiated in the proximal small intestine.",

Serum antibody titers to coronavirus were evaluated by serum neutralization (SN) test using bovine coronavirus (BCV), which is closely related antigenically to ECoV. 53, 61, 62 Two horses were seropositive for BCV 1 month before transportation (titers 10 and 40). These horses were transported in the same vehicle as four horses that were seronegative to coronavirus. The four seronegative horses seroconverted after transportation (titers between 10 and 20 within 1 month), but none developed clinical signs, and a direct relationship between disease and coronavirus infection could not be confirmed. 61 This study suggested that ECoV could possibly spread among horses while they are stabled together or during transport, although this requires confirmation. This hypothesis is consistent with serologic evidence that BCV or its related virus is widely prevalent in horses in Japan. 61, 62 Coronavirus-like particles have been observed by negativecontrast EM in fecal samples from healthy and diarrheic foals, 63-68 from one foal with combined immunodeficiency syndrome and diarrhea, 69 and from adult horses concurrently diagnosed with Neorickettsia risticii, the causative agent of Potomac horse fever. 70 Concurrent infections with rotavirus 65, 66 and Cryptosporidium 69 have also been reported in foals.",

In human patients, a fourfold increase in titer to coronavirus is indicative of recent active infection. An antemortem diagnostic panel for ECoV can include assay for serum antibody titer to BCV and fecal capture ELISA evaluation for coronavirus antigen. 47 However, RT-PCR of fecal samples is currently more practical (and rapid) for use by practitioners.",
