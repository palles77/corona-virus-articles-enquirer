Development of new and hnproved immunologic assay systems has paved the way for accurate and reliable rapid diagnostic tests that detect viral antigens in clinical specialens. We conducted a careful and elaborate study in which radioimmunoassay for antigen detection was compared with u battery of tissue culture systems for viral isolation and iden-ti#Tcati(m. Using a lTne plastic catheter, a specimen of mucus was aspirated from the nasopharynx o.f patients with clinical signs and symptoms of acute viral upper respiratory tract infections. Each spechnen was divided into two portions; one was used to inoculate a variety o.f tissue culture cell lines and the other was used for radioimmunoassay tests for influenza A and B. adenavirus, parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3, and respiratory syncytial virus. Radioimmunoassav results campared very favorably with the tissue culture data with on/v one exception-adenovirus. Essentially this degree of accuracy and reproducibility was obtained with an enzrnle-liaked imnmnosorbent assay test. which has replaced radioimmunoassa.r.

            "text": "Diagnosis of viral infections of the respiratory tract is relatively inefficient. This is due to several factors, one of which is the isolation of the virus in tissue culture systems because some of the agents--rhinovirus or coronavirus--cannot be cultivated in a practical manner. Others, such as respiratory syncytial virus, have a low rate of efficiency of cultivation. Another factor is the quality of the specimen; the presence of viral immunoglobulin A-antibodies in the mucus secretions, or virus inactivation due to improper storage or prolonged transport time of the specimen to the laboratory. A third factor relates to the prospects of a virus being present in the specimen. For example, in the case of influenza the chance for the isolation of the agent decreases rapidly 3 days after onset of clinical symptoms. Finally, the time required for virus isolation, including tissue culture cultivation, hemadsorption, and typing of the virus isolate, generally requires 3-10 days, a time lapse that cannot be tolerated if useful cooperation with the clinician is to be maintained.",

The first successful efforts in this direction were made by Gardner and McQuillin (1968) in London, Grandien (1985) in Stockholm, Halonen et al. (1983) in Turku, and others (Orstavik et al., 1980; Berg et al., 1980; Chao et al., 1979; Daisy et al., 1979: Fulton and Middleton, 1974) . These scientists improved the application of immunofluorescence techniques for the rapid diagnosis of respiratory tract diseases. As viewed by the European Group for Rapid Viral Diagnosis, this was reasonable progress in rapid diagnosis of viral diseases. Although immunofluorescent staining of cells removed from the nasopharynx is a rapid method, it is also subjective and requires a highly skilled microscopist. The preparation of the smears (usually at the bedside) is another critical problem. Furthermore, this method has not been automated, and is restricted to a relatively small number of samples per day.",

The specimens were obtained from both hospitalized patients and from patients seeing physicians in the clinic or office. The patients were mainly children of both sexes, ranging in age from 4 wk to 14 yr, who had clinical symptoms of acute respiratory disease, and were examined within the first 3 days after onset of clinical symptoms. The samples were obtained by aspiration from the nasopharynx with a fine plastic catheter through the nostrils of patients. By this method, usually 0.2-2.0 ml of mucus was easily obtained. Furthermore, we learned that this method is more readily tolerated by the patient than are throat swabs because the vomiting stimulus is avoided. For further handling the aspirated specimens were divided in two parts; one was diluted 1:10 with Eagle's medium containing antibiotics and inoculated on tissue cultures of primary African green monkey kidney cells, on human diploid fibroblasts, or on FL cells. The tissue cells were observed for cytopathic effect or hemadsorption. If positive they were propagated further in deembryonated eggs and examined with the electron microscope. The second part of the specimen was diluted 1:5 with phosphate buffered saline containing 20% FCS, 2% Tween 20, and 10 -~ merthiolate. After sonication to dissolve the mucus, the material was stored at -70\u00b0C until tested with the RIA or the ELISA procedure. The RIA was performed on polystyrene beads coated with antivirus guinea pig immunoglobulin G (IgG) purified by immunosorbent chromatography. After over-night adsorption of the sample preparation, rabbit antivirus immunoglobulin was added and allowed to react for 1 hr; this was followed by the addition of labeled sheep antirabbit IgG. Binding ratios of 2.1 or greater compared with control preparations were considered positive.",
