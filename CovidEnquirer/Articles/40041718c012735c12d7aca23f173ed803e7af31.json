It is the interplay between the immune system and the invading pathogens, mobilizing in turns hordes of specialized cell populations, shaped and tuned by eras of co-evolution. But as expected from any highly complex, multi-leveled system, it is not entirely predictable. The work of Yanfen Ma and colleagues in this issue prove how unforeseeable the genetic manipulation of the pathogen can be, where the simple insertion of a transgene produces an attenuated strain even in the absence of triggering the intended suicide mechanism [1] . Vaccination started long before the molecular details behind infection, contagion and immunity were elucidated, and vaccine production has partially stayed a carefully supervised empirical science. Several attenuated strains used for vaccination arose by chance over passages, while the very necessity to maintain and amplify the strains requires further passaging, rendering vaccine production also a major logistic challenge, in order to assure the safety, quality and homogeneity of products over the world, including the panoply of issues linked to the preservation, transport and administration of the vaccines [3] .",

MERS originated in bats, uses camels and dromedaries as an animal reservoir, can be transmitted from human to human and elicits respiratory distress plus multiorgan failure in its victims, with a fatality rate of about 35% [5] . However, despite the repeated call from scientists and several valuable discoveries which could probably be transformed into treatments and vaccines [6] , the pharmaceutical companies showed limited interest in investing into MERS, as the disease kept a relatively low profile over the past three years and numerous other catastrophes fought simultaneously for economic and media attention. Now, at the time of mid-June, MERS accounts for 162 cases of infection, 19 casualties and over 6000 quarantined people and the need for efficient countermeasures urges [7] .

As vaccination works by herd immunity to dyke up the spread of infectious pathogens, it requires a vast majority of individuals to conform to mandatory vaccination, notably members of specific professions such as health care workers [9] . However, the mentality of the modern Western world has shifted to the worship of the individual, asserting round the clock that it is the duty of society to insure its unconditional well-being, and not that it might be the individual's duty to ensure the society's wellbeing. Accepting a minor risk at the individual level in order to decrease the risk at the group level has become way less self-evident for a generation that has never witnessed the real ravages of vaccine-preventable diseases but is rather obsessed with the precise caloric content of 100% organic quinoa instead.

Such an inducible strain could be useful as a vaccine to induce protective immunity. Once a protective immune response is present, any latent parasites could be eliminated by inducing the detrimental/toxic gene, producing a \"sterile\" immunity.

            "text": "Biosketch e Dr. Huan Huang Huan Huang holds both a degree of Medicine as well as of Molecular Biology and Biochemistry. After having been an assistant professor of internal medicine at the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou College (China) from 1988 to 1991, he moved to the Albert Einstein College of Medicine (USA) where he has successively worked as a research associate, instructor and assistant professor at the Department of Pathology. Since 2007, he occupies the position of an associate professor in this department. Dr. Huang's studies focus on the molecular disease mechanisms of Trypanosoma cruzi and the genetic manipulation of the parasite. He made substantial contributions to the research on Chagasic cardiomyopathy, cAMP-signaling and Mitogen Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs) in T. cruzi and Toxoplasma gondii.2. Interview with Dr. Huan Huang 1. What triggered your interest in generating an attenuated live vaccine against Trypanosoma cruzi and why did you opt for the inducible suicide system?",
