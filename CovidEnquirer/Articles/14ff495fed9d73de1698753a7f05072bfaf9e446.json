            "text": "Infections with Eimeria parasites can lead to severe diarrhoea with considerable clinical and economic consequences in firstyear grazing stock. To identify and characterise the cause of diarrhoea observed during previous years, 164 animals on 14 dairy farms in northwestern Germany were included in this study. The calves were physically and parasitologically examined prior to turnout and until 21 days post turnout (d.p.t.). Mean animal weights decreased from 194.9 kg at the start to 189.3 kg bodyweight at the end of the study. In all herds, oocyst counts were very low prior to turnout and increased after the calves had been kept on pasture for at least 7 days. On Day 9 post turnout, 90% and at the end of the study (21 d.p.t.) 70% of all animals showed Eimeriapositive faecal samples. During the course of the study, 79 (48.2%) animals passed faecal samples with more than 100,000 oocysts per gram. The predominant species identified was Eimeria alabamensis, which accounted for more than 83% of the oocysts counted. These parasitological findings matched the clinical observations. Diarrhoea was found in 130 (79.3%) of the study animals. At 5 d.p.t. and thus prior to the rise of faecal oocyst counts, a significant increase in diarrhoea was recorded. Calves showing diarrhoea excreted statistically significantly more often over 100,000 E. alabamensis oocysts per gram faeces (0.28; p = 0.0002) than calves without diarrhoea. Diarrhoea was also found during significantly more study days in animals with high oocyst counts (0.39; p = 0.0001). These data indicate that in endemic areas first-year grazing calves must be considered at risk to develop clinical coccidiosis due to E. alabamensis infection during the first 2-3 weeks post turnout. #",

In cattle, several Eimeria species have been shown to be capable of establishing clinical disease associated with watery to bloody diarrhoea, high morbidity, and, depending on which Eimeria species is dominant, high mortality rates as well. In the field, infections with more than one species were commonly found, but monoinfections were observed in some cases (Gr\u00e4fner et al., 1982; Svensson et al., 1993) . Investigations performed in Sweden and Germany have unambiguously identified Eimeria alabamensis as the predominant species in grazing cattle with clinical coccidiosis. Other species frequently found were Eimeria bovis, Eimeria auburnensis, Eimeria zuernii, Eimeria ellipsoidalis and Eimeria bukidnonensis (Svensson et al., 1993 Svensson, 1997) . In Germany, clinical outbreaks of coccidiosis have occurred in grazing cattle in 17 herds from eight large cattle enterprises in the northern part of the former GDR (Gr\u00e4fner et al., 1982) . In three herds, E. alabamensis monoinfections were recorded, and this species was predominant in ten of the remaining herds with polyinfections. Infections with E. bovis dominated in four herds, while in one herd the three species E. alabamensis, E. bovis, and E. zuernii were present. Experimental infections and data obtained during field studies have demonstrated that the prepatent period of E. alabamensis ranges between 6 and 10 days (Hooshmand-Rad et al., 1994; Svensson et al., 1994) . Clinical symptoms started 3-7 days post experimental infection (Hooshmand-Rad et al., 1994) and were observed to become prevalent at 5 days following turnout on contaminated pasture . Apart from watery diarrhoea, other symptoms shown by experimentally infected calves were poor appetite, depression, abdominal pain, and reduced growth rate (Hooshmand-Rad et al., 1994) . Significant reduction in weight gain was also found in natural infections. Compared to calves kept on clean pastures, the difference amounted to more than 24 kg during a period of 24 days and actually resulted in weight loss of 18 kg during that time . Mortality of E. alabamensis-infected cattle appears to be low and remains below 1% even when polyinfections are present (Gr\u00e4fner et al., 1982) .",

For the complete study period, an average of 43.6% (S.D. 23.3) of the calves on the 14 sites had more than 100,000 Eimeria opg at least once. The relative peak of samples with such high counts for E. alabamensis was reached at Day 9 post turnout (Fig. 4) . One week later the number of calves shedding over 100,000 E. alabamensis oozysts per gram fell to zero (Fig. 4) . The number of E. bovis and E. zuernii positive calves peaked at Days 12 and 9 post turnout, respectively (Figs. 5 and 6). Both the mean E. bovis and the mean E. zuernii opg counts remained below 500 during the course of the study (data not shown). The statistical examination of the data revealed that calves which showed signs of diarrhoea were significantly more often excreting over 100,000 E. alabamensis oocysts per gram faeces (0.28; p = 0.0002) than those without diarrhoea. Of the 130 animals for which diarrhoea was recorded, 72 were found to shed more than 100,000 E. alabamensis oocysts per gram. Also, the number of days on which animals showed diarrhoea was correlated with high oocyst shedding (0.39; p = 0.0001). Among the group of animals with high oocyst counts, this was particularly true for 24 animals where persistence of diarrhoea for more than 1 week up to the end of the study was observed, compared to a total of nine with lower counts. Within the latter group, only two animals showed diarrhoea later than 8 days post turnout. Accordingly, the number of days where animals showed high E. alabamensis oocyst counts correlated with the number of days when diarrhoea was present (0.28; p = 0.0003). Out of a total of 79 calves showing faeces with more than 100,000 oocysts per gram for at least 1 day, 72 had diarrhoea.",

The district in which the current investigation was performed represents one of the most intensive dairy areas in Germany. Following repeated reports about cases of first-year grazing calves showing diarrhoea and weight loss during the first weeks following turnout, the present study was initiated to investigate the possible involvement of coccidia. The pattern of E. alabamensis infections in first-year grazing calves is characterised by significant increases in oocsyt counts starting at approximately 7-9 days post turnout (Svensson, 2000) . Infections are considered to be mainly caused by oocysts which persist on the pasture from the previous grazing season (Gr\u00e4fner et al., 1982; Svensson et al., 1993 Svensson et al., , 1994 . A similar scenario was encountered in the present study. However, the high degree of reproducibility with which the parasitological and clinical parameters developed throughout the conduct of the study at the different sites was unexpected. In all herds and in nearly all calves, E. alabamensis oocsyts were found, and in approximately 80% clinical Eimeriosis was diagnosed. The spectrum of Eimeria species encountered in the present study includes those found most often in an earlier study in northeastern parts of Germany (Gr\u00e4fner et al., 1982) . Similarly, E. alabamensis and E. bovis were the most prevalent species. At turnout, a significant number of animals showed E. alabamensis-positive faecal samples in spite of the fact that this pathogen is considered to be an infection acquired during the first few days of grazing (Gr\u00e4fner et al., 1982; Svensson et al., 1993) . However, it is also known that calves may be infected before turnout, which usually leads to the excretion of low oocyst numbers. E. alabamensis oocysts can be transmitted by feeding contaminated hay even when it has been stored for 8 months (Faber et al., 2002; Svensson, 1997) . In-house infection and latent infections could relapse if animals are stressed during turnout (Levine, 1985) . Reports have discussed a possible reactivation of arrested endogenous stages as a response to stress, such as unfavourable weather (Marquardt, 1976; Parker et al., 1986; Step et al., 2002) .",

            "text": "Only a few reports are available on the clinical significance of naturally acquired bovine coccidiosis. Here, the calves on all farms started to show clinical symptoms of watery diarrhoea approximately 2 days before the increase in oocyst output began. Similar findings were reported in Swedish first-year grazing calves kept on permanent pastures which were proven to be contaminated in the previous year (Svensson, 2000) . No animal died during the course of the present study, but one calf had to be treated palliatively. In the years preceeding and following this study, calves from the same farms have died, with signs of clinical coccidiosis during the first 2 months following turnout (data not shown). In contrast to E. bovis-dominated infections, coccidiosis predominantly caused by E. alabamensis is known to show a low morbidity. Nevertheless, such natural infections may contribute to reduced weight gain during the first months of grazing and may occasionally require treatment to avoid a fatal outcome of the disease. In the present study, infections with E. alabamensis were the most prevalent, showing the highest intensity in the faecal samples. Since E. bovis is more virulent than E. alabamensis, animals with E. bovis opg counts lower than 100,000 could also have been clinically affected, and these infections must also be considered as a cause of diarrhoea. Data from experimental (Hooshmand-Rad et al., 1994) but also natural E. alabamensis infections have shown that clinical signs of diarrhoea develop and peak within the first week post turnout. Essentially, the same was observed in the present study. In contrast, following infection with E. bovis and E. zuernii, the first signs of clinical disease are seen approximately 2-3 weeks post infection (Daugschies et al., 1986; Mundt et al., 2005) . Therefore, the fact that diarrhoea began to develop after only 4 days post turnout in the herds investigated here, with the highest incidence at 6 days post turnout, suggests that the main cause of disease during this phase of the study can be attributed to infections with E. alabamensis. Furthermore, the low mean E. bovis and E. zuernii opg counts suggest that these pathogens did not unduly contribute to the clinical effects seen in this study.",

However, even by repeated application of these drugs for several days, the clinical symptoms can only be reduced but not effectively eliminated. A sulphonamide bolusbased treatment, which has been studied in Sweden, was shown to be significantly effective in reducing weight loss and oocyst output in treated calves (Svensson, 1998) . Immunisation has also been discussed as a possible option for prevention in preliminary investigations (Svensson et al., 1996) . However, to date, the prophylactic and curative options are unsatisfactory in many countries. The known anti-coccidial compound toltrazuril has been shown to clinically cure Eimeria-infected calves and reduce oocyst output (Emanuel et al., 1988; Pilarczyk, 2001) but is not yet registered for use in cattle. From the data shown here, we conclude that clinical symptoms due to Eimeria spp. infections in endemic areas regularly occur during the first 1 or 2 weeks following turnout.",
