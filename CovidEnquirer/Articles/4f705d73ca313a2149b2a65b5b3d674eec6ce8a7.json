The association between fall exacerbations and viral respiratory tract infections (RTI) remains uncertain. Objective: To investigate the number of fall exacerbations and the incidence of RTIs in a pediatric asthmatic population using an at-home mucus collection methodology. Methods: This was a 16-week, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group exploratory study. Children, 4e11 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of asthma requiring use of an inhaled corticosteroid, a morning peak expiratory flow !70% predicted and a history of !1 asthma exacerbation during the previous respiratory viral season were eligible for enrollment. Subjects were randomized (1:1) to receive fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (FP/SAL) 100/50 mcg or FP 100 mcg prior to starting school. Subjects collected mucus samples using an at-home kit when they experienced respiratory symptoms. Mucus samples obtained during symptomatic periods were analyzed for common respiratory viruses by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. The number of exacerbations requiring systemic corticosteroids was recorded. Results: In total, 339 (FP/SAL, n \u00bc 171; FP, n \u00bc 168) subjects were randomized and included in the intentto-treat population; 292 (86%) completed the study. Of the 537 mucus samples collected, 64% tested positive for viruses, but only 6% of positive samples were associated with an asthma exacerbation. Exacerbations were infrequent, with only 41 subjects reporting 49 exacerbations in total. Adverse events were reported in 66% of subjects. Conclusions: In a susceptible population, the fall asthma exacerbation rates in children were low despite frequent detection of viral RTIs. NCT01192178; GSK ID: ADA113872.",

            "text": "The pediatric asthma population, with a past history of fall exacerbations, is particularly vulnerable to respiratory infection upon return to school. This study set out to identify a pediatric population (4e11 years of age) at least 2 weeks prior to returning to their school, who were considered at risk for seasonal exacerbation based on recent prior history of exacerbation requiring treatment with SCS, emergency room (ER) visits or hospitalization. To investigate the viral etiology of exacerbations as they occurred during the fall season, this study utilized an at-home, symptom-driven, method for collection of mucus samples which were subsequently analyzed for viral content. As exacerbations are rare events, this study was not designed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in exacerbation rates between treatment groups but rather to explore the relationships between treatment, respiratory symptoms, exacerbations, and viral etiology. Mucus sample collection was triggered by the presence of worsening asthma and/ or cold symptoms. Samples were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the presence and identification of virus. The date of mucus collection, the asthma and/or cold symptom pattern, viral etiology, and date of exacerbation treatment facilitated the investigation of the association between viral presence and asthma exacerbation. This is the first study in an at-risk pediatric population to prospectively explore viral etiology and association with fall asthma exacerbations through symptom-driven collection of mucus samples. It differs from many previous studies in that nasal mucus samples were collected in real time from children following a report of moderate-to-severe respiratory symptoms, rather than at the time of or shortly after asthma exacerbation. As the study design allowed for more frequent mucus collection, above and beyond times of exacerbation, this study allowed for the observation of viral infection patterns throughout the fall period. The results presented here demonstrate the feasibility of at-home mucus collection in a randomized, clinical trial setting, and provide evidence that the majority of viral infections in children being treated with control medications for persistent asthma do not cause exacerbations of asthma.",

This study design is in contrast to observational, cross-sectional, or cohort studies in which adherence to asthma control medications preceding the exacerbation is presumably low and in which nasal samples were collected at scheduled times [28] . Additional strengths of the study included a design which required the population to enter the study in a 2-week period in early August 2010; this enabled treatment of the entire study population for a minimum of 2 weeks prior to the start of most traditional school calendars. Also, the study employed \"just in time\" mucus sample collection that was driven by the presence of moderate-to-severe upper respiratory symptoms and/or by the presence of signs of worsening asthma. Doing so demonstrated that symptom-driven, at-home, sample collection is feasible in a randomized controlled trial setting. Even though mucus collection was dependent on the parent's and child's compliance with the procedure at-home, this feature allowed for accurate classification of exacerbations in terms of viral etiology. The study also used a stringent and generally accepted definition of asthma exacerbation that required either SCS use, an acute care visit or hospitalization in accordance with the statement from the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society on asthma control and exacerbations [29] . One limitation of this study was its inability to detect treatment differences, as a result of its exploratory design and the low number of viral RTI-associated exacerbations observed in the study population. Another limitation was the lack of a placebo arm, which would have enabled an assessment of the effect of asthma maintenance treatment on viral etiology and exacerbation rates. Previous randomized pediatric studies and retrospective cohort analyses of populations with similar exacerbation risk and impairment have demonstrated that approximately 30% of subjects experience an exacerbation during the fall [24,30e32], 2.5-fold higher than the 12% exacerbation rate reported in the current study with FP and FP/ SAL maintenance therapy. Further placebo-controlled studies are required to examine the effect of maintenance therapy on exacerbations of asthma.",
