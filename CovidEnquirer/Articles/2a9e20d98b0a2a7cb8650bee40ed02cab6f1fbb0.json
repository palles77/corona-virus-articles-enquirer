There was an immediate need to develop and implement procedures and guidelines specifically relevant to SARS. All the new guidelines were focused on containment of the disease and protection of all patients, health care workers and visitors. The great challenge was to manage a disease about which very little was known, and about which knowledge would be constantly emerging.",

Isolation rooms and units were identified and prepared for patient use. The Women and Children's Health Program prepared protocols to manage care of SARS patients in the Maternal Newborn areas, as well as in Pediatrics. Since the programs consist of services at two sites, it was decided that the higher risk unit would become the triage and isolation unit for birthing patients. When other local hospitals had to close their services due to SARS, women were redirected to this unit to receive care. The nurses assumed the added workload with caring and stamina.",

The plan of care for women who have been contacts of SARS patients, and who remain asymptomatic, includes providing LDRP care in a birthing room using respiratory isolation precautions. If a mother and her newborn are stable, they are discharged 24 hours postpartum to complete their quarantine period at home with Public Health follow-up. A woman requiring cesarean birth will remain with her healthy newborn in the birthing isolation room, where she will receive all needed nursing care, to decrease the potential for exposure in other areas of the hospital. Women who require isolation would be managed in the birthing unit and then transferred to a designated SARS Alliance hospital. Transfer protocols for women and newborns requiring tertiary-level care and retro-transfer procedures were developed at the provincial level and implemented locally.",

This was increased to two support persons when the restrictions were relaxed. Babies in the NICU and pediatric patients may have two parents with them (plus two significant oth-ers). Asymptomatic women have been encouraged to breastfeed in the absence of evidence to the contrary. The lessons learned from this experience have included an increased appreciation for the level of integration that exits within the health care system as evidenced by the impact on all hospitals when one or two hospitals are closed and their staff are placed on quarantine. The present system for emergency codes doesn't address a situation such as SARS; a code for a nonsentinel event such as \"infectious disease\" would be useful.",
