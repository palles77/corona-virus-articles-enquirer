In addition to evaluating and managing the usual array of community-acquired infections, the clinician must be prepared to diagnose and treat a host of uncommon and potentially life-threatening pathogens. This diseases range from widespread tropical diseases such as malaria to the more exotic and lethal viral hemorrhagic fevers. A thoughtful approach guided by geographic patterns of illness offers a reliable method for determining the most likely sources of fever in the returned traveler as well as a focused diagnostic and treatment strategy.",

Other infectious diseases may lead to significant morbidity and mortality if not rapidly identified and treatment initiated. With the current ease and rapidity of global travel, the likelihood that exotic infectious agents may appear at any given hospital has increased significantly. The search for these rare diseases should not, however, come at the expense of a ''common sense'' approach to the evaluation of the febrile patient. Additional information about specific international travel destinations can help guide the evaluation while suggesting more likely infectious agents that may be endemic to that region.",

Through a simple triage tool that uses criteria including recent fever, travel to a country endemic for VHF, travel outside urban areas or contact with animals, they demonstrate that patients with moderate or high risk for VHF can be identified without the need for unnecessary hospitalization or extensive use of viral polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. Expanding this methodology to account for other potential infectious agents that may present to a given hospital or emergency department can provide some guidance for clinicians who may encounter febrile patients who have recently returned from any geographic region, unwittingly harboring undiagnosed viral, bacterial or parasitic infection.",

Freedman et al., in a recent review of GeoSentinel infectious disease surveillance data gathered on more than 17,000 patients from 30 sites worldwide, found that significant regional differences were noted among ill returned travelers. 4 Specific destinations were associated with increased probability of certain diseases, potentially guiding diagnostic and empiric treatment strategies.",

Consumption of untreated water or unpasteurized dairy products can lead to hepatitis A (in an unvaccinated traveler), salmonellosis, shigellosis, as well as parasitic infections such as giardiasis. 6 Although substantially less common, rare food-borne illnesses such as cholera may also occur. The incidence of traveler's diarrhea has been estimated to be as high as 20e60% in visitors to underdeveloped nations and the GeoSentinel data also confirm this finding, describing a high frequency of all types of diarrheal illness among returned travelers. 7 A history of insect bite or unexplained soft tissue infection or abscess should prompt the clinician to consider vector-borne illness. Malaria, as previously noted, has historically been the most common cause of febrile illness in returned travelers requiring hospitalization. The diagnosis of malaria should be considered even in patients without a clear history of mosquito exposure and in those who have taken appropriate malaria chemoprophylaxis. A missed or delayed diagnosis of malaria can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Because of its high incidence among returned travelers, thick and thin blood smears for malaria should be obtained for any febrile patient who has had recent travel to areas where malaria is endemic, especially, sub-Saharan Africa, Central and South America and Southeast Asia. Other vector-borne diseases which may present with fever include dengue, yellow fever, rickettsial diseases such as African tick fever, and trypanosomiasis. A history of yellow fever vaccination, required by many countries prior to travel to endemic areas, makes the disease much less likely, although it cannot be entirely excluded. Also, vaccination histories may be inaccurate. 8",

Incubation times greater than 21 days are seen in tuberculosis, amebic liver abscess, rabies and leishmaniasis. While an incubation period of 21 days is generally seen in acute HIV infection, the onset of HIV seroconversion illness may vary considerably. 9 Similarly, malaria can present with fever of variable onset, with more delayed presentations seen in patients taking ineffective prophylaxis. Fever patterns, although often non-specific, may suggest certain etiologies. Periodic fever spikes, long considered characteristic of malaria, may take some time to become established, limiting their utility in the diagnosis of early disease.

While these basic laboratory tests are unlikely to yield a definitive diagnosis, they may be useful in detecting more subtle abnormalities such as eosinophilia in parasitic infection or underlying metabolic disorders. Thick and thin blood smears for malaria should be obtained for travelers to tropical regions, and stool studies including stool culture, fecal leukocytes, ova and parasite assays should be ordered for patients complaining of diarrheal illness. Serum samples should be drawn and set aside for subsequent testing if rickettsial or arboviral diseases are a consideration. 6 Comparison of acute phase antibody titers to subsequent, convalescent phase assays can be useful in tracking the course of a disease. In the rare situation where patients are suspected of harboring highly pathogenic illnesses such as hemorrhagic fever viruses, plague or anthrax, all specimens from such patients should be regarded as high risk. Laboratory personnel who may be handling these specimens should be notified before processing any sample so that tests may be carried out without risk of transmission of infection to laboratory personnel.

In patients with suspected VHF infection, the use of impermeable gowns, N-95 masks, face shields or goggles, as well as negative-pressure isolation rooms with dedicated medical equipment for each patient (such as stethoscopes and blood pressure cuffs) is imperative, as is the restriction of access by nonessential staff and visitors. 10 These precautions also apply to other airborne illnesses that carry significant potential risk for staff or patientepatient transmission such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus.

Bloody diarrhea and the presence of fecal leukocytes are more associated with invasive infections such as salmonellosis or shigellosis. More specific anti-infective therapies for such illnesses as malaria, rickettsial infection or typhoid fever should be instituted only after initial investigations or clinical findings suggest these etiologies.
