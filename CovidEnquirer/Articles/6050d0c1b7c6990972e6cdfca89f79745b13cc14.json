By monitoring endoglycosidase H resistance, we measured the loss from the ER-ERGIC-cis-Golgi cycle of ERGIC-53. A domain exchange approach with the plasma membrane reporter protein CD4 showed that the transmembrane and the lumenal domains are not sufficient, while the cytoplasmic domain of ERGIC-53 is required and sufficient for pre-medial-Golgi localization. However, the ERGIC-53 cytoplasmic domain on CD4 lead to in-creased ER-staining by immunofluorescence microscopy indicating that this domain alone cannot provide for unbiased recycling through the ER-ERGIC-cis-",

Here, membrane proteins enter budding vesicles and are transported to the next compartment, where they are recognized by a receptor and sorted into vesicles destined for recycling to the compartment of origin (Pelham and Munro, 1993) . Such a process was described for type I membrane proteins of the ER that contain a COOH-terminal di-lysine ER-retrieval signal, KKXX or KXKXX, in their cytoplasmic domain (Jackson et al., 1990) . In mammalian and in yeast cells these proteins can leave the ER and recycle from a post-ER compartment (Jackson et al., 1993; Gaynor et al., 1994; Townsley et al., 1994) . Di-lysine signals were shown to bind coatomer in vitro (Cosson and Letourneur, 1994) and mutations in yeast coatomer subunits effect the intracellular retention of di-lysine proteins in vivo (Letourneur et al., 1994) . These findings support a coatomer-mediated retrieval mechanism for di-lysine ER proteins.",

The cytoplasmic domain possesses three determinants all of which are required for correct targeting within the ER-ERGIC-cis-Golgi recycling pathway: a functional di-lysine ER-retrieval signal, KKFF, a targeting determinant adjacent to the membrane, RSQQE, and two COOH-terminal phenylalanines that reduce the retrieval efficiency of the di-lysine signal and modulate the RSQQE targeting determinant. Thus the ER-retrieval signal, although critical for retaining ERGIC-53 in the ER-ERGIC-cis-Golgi recycling pathway, is not sufficient for the correct distribution throughout these compartments. Targeting of ERGIC-53 depends on a complex interplay of multiple determinants.",

The introduced c-myc epitope tag was recognized by the epitope-specific mAb 9E10 (Evan et al., 1985) both in indirect immunofluorescence experiments (Fig. 2 , e and f) and immunoprecipitation (Fig. 3) . In pulse-chase experiments GM and overexpressed wild-type ERGIC-53 displayed virtually identical expression levels and oligomerization (Fig. 3) , and the localization revealed by immunofluorescence microscopy indicates that the modifications did not alter the intracellular distribution compared to overexpressed wild type (Fig. 2 ). However, both overexpressed proteins showed a staining of the cell periphery (Schindler et al., 1993) and T4 comprises the hydrophobic residues 375-395 of human CD4 (Maddon et al., 1985) . typical for ER, and led to a comparable fraction of transfected ceils exhibiting surface staining (compare Fig. 2 , c and d with e and f). Cells expressing identical levels of ERGIC-53 or GM bound equal amounts of radio-iodinated mAb to ERGIC-53 suggesting identical loss of both proteins from the ER-ERGIC-cis-Golgi recycling pathway (data not shown). After immunoprecipitation of GM with mAb 9El0 against the c-myc epitope, digestion with endo H confirmed that the introduced N-glycosylation consensus site was glycosylated and that the oligomerization state of GM was identical to that of ERGIC-53 (Fig. 3) . The kinetics of oligomerization of endogenous ERGIC-53 in nontransfected cells and that of overexpressed GM or ERGIC-53 in transfected cells was identical (not shown), indicating that the overall folding of GM is indistinguishable from ERGIC-53, and overexpressed ERGIC-53 and GM showed the same half-life in pulsechase experiments (not shown). In Fig. 3 hardly any endogenous ERGIC-53 is coprecipitated with GM demonstrating that disulfide-linked heterooligomers between GM and endogenous ERGIC-53 should not influence the interpretation of a mutational analysis. We conclude that overexpression of the GM construct in COS-1 cells fulfills the criteria required for a mutational analysis of the targeting determinant(s) of ERGIC-53. ",

Transfected COS cells were analyzed by a double immunofluorescence procedure which allowed differential staining of the cell surface and intracellular membranes ( Fig. 5 ; see Materials and Methods). Overexpressed CD4 showed strong surface staining under nonpermeabilized and a perinuclear intracellular staining under permeabilized conditions. The perinuclear staining most likely represents newly synthesized protein in transit through the Golgi as well as internalized CD4 concentrated in endosomes and/or lysosomes. Overexpressed CD4 chimera IAT53C53 and L4T4C53, on the other hand, showed no surface staining but a strong staining indicative of the ER: reticular intracellular staining with a nuclear ring (Fig. 5 , c-f). It is important to note that this staining is distinct from an E R G I C pattern (see also Fig. 8 B) . For L4T4C53, a few cells exhibited surface staining (insert in Fig. 5 , e and f). To confirm these results biochemically, transfected COS cells were pulse--chased and the immunoprecipitates were digested with endo H (data not shown). In contrast to wild-type CD4, the chimeras remained endo H sensitive after prolonged chase times indicating a pre-medial-Golgi localization, which is in line with the ER-staining observed in Fig. 5 . We conclude that the cytoplasmic domain of ERGIC-53 is sufficient for premedial-Golgi targeting.",

Surprisingly, deletion of up to seven amino acids, which eliminated the putative KKXX ER-retrieval signal, did not substantially change the rate of endo H resistance compared to wild type (Fig. 6, lines 2 , 3, 4, and 6). These results suggest that the inner five amino acids R S Q Q E adjacent to the transmembrane domain act Figure 5 . Double-immunofluorescence analysis of surface and intracellular CD4, 1_AT53C53 and L4T4C53. Transfected COS cells were cooled to 4\u00b0C and incubated with mAb 6D10 (IgG1), against CD4, followed by IgGl-specific goat antimouse-FITC to stain protein at the cell surface (b, d, and f). The cells were then fixed and permeabilized followed by an incubation with mAb HP2/6.1 (IgG2a), against CD4, and goat anti-mouse IgG2a-specific goat anti-mouse-TRITC staining the intracellular protein (a, c, and e). The DNA's used were CD4 (a and b), L4T53T53 (c and d) and L4T4C53 (e and Y3-Bar corresponds to 10 ~m in a, b, c, d and 22 ~m in e and f. as a targeting determinant. To exclude conformational artifacts due to truncation, which might slow down exit from the ER, we restored the authentic tail length by re-adding seven alanines to the R S Q Q E , and we deleted the KKXXmotif in L53T4C53. Both constructs showed equal endo H resistance and oligomerization equal to wild type, strongly arguing against a truncation artifact (Fig. 6 , lines 5 and 7). We conclude that the five residues R S Q Q E adjacent to the transmembrane domain constitute a targeting determinant. Figure 6 . The cytoplasmic domain of ERGIC-53 contains a KKXX-retrieval signal and a second targeting signal adjacent to the membrane. Endo H resistance was determined after 5 rain of pulse with [35S]methionine followed by 60 min of chase as described in Fig. 4 a. The mutations indicated were all constructed in a GM background, except mutation 5 that was constructed in L53T4C53 (see Fig. 1 ). The amino acid sequence of the cytoplasmic domain is given in the single letter code with construct 1 representing the wild-type sequence. The values given are means + SD of triplicate cultures treated in parallel. Surface appearance of the overexpressed proteins was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy staining the cell surface with mAb 9El0 at 4\u00b0C before fixation and permeabilization as described in Fig. 2 . We next studied the role of the lysines in the cytoplasmic domain of ERGIC-53 (Fig. 6, line 9) . A construct with two correctly positioned lysines ( -3 / -4 from the COOH terminus) but lacking the terminal phenylalanines did not acquire endo H resistance and was not transported to the cell surface. This construct is significantly different from construct 1 (Fig. 6, wt) , containing the terminal phenylalanines and from construct 7 (Fig. 6 ) that contains only the RSQQE determinant. It also confirmed that transport of ERGIC-53 to the Golgi and the cell surface was not simply a question of enforced overexpression but an intrinsic property of the cytoplasmic domain.",

High expression levels lead to saturation of the recycling pathway and result in staining of the cell surface and the endosomal system, a condition that renders a morphological analysis impossible (see also Fig. 2) . To determine the role of the cytoplasmic targeting signals in maintaining ERGIC-53 within the ER-ERGIC-cis-Golgi cycle, COS cells were transfected with the cDNAs corresponding to the constructs in Fig. 7 with the cytoplasmic domains: RSQ-QEAAAKKFF (wild type), RSQQEAAAKKAA, RRA-AAAAAKKFF, and RRAAAAAAKKAA. 16 h after transfection, corresponding to a threefold increased expression of mutant versus endogenous ERGIC-53 (data not shown), mutant protein was selectively visualized with the mAb against the c-myc epitope. Overexpression of GM with the cytoplasmic sequence RSQQEAAAKKFF lead to the characteristic concentrated perinuclear pattern (Fig. 8 A, a) observed for endogenous ERGIC-53 (Fig. 8  B, b) , whereas substitution of the terminal phenylalanines by alanines (RSQQEAAAKKAA) lead to a typical ER pattern with a pronounced staining of the nuclear envelope and less concentration in a perinuclear area (Fig. 8 A,  b) . This finding emphasizes the importance of the phenylalanines in targeting. Proteins terminating in RRAAAA- periphery (Fig. 8 A, c and d) . The finding that neither of the two ER-retrieval signals alone was capable of mediating wild-type targeting showed the requirement for the RSQQE determinant for targeting. Therefore, ERGIC-53 localization requires all three features in the cytoplasmic domain of ERGIC-53: a di-lysine ER-retrieval signal, a RSQQE targeting determinant and two COOH-terminal phenylalanines modulating both targeting determinants. That the different mutants show differences in their distribution also argues against binding of the mutants to calnexin or even endogenous ERGIC-53 via their carbohydrate moiety as an explanation for their targeting within the ER-ERGIC-cis-Golgi cycle.",

L4T4C53 showed mostly an ER pattern with a strong nuclear ring clearly distinct from endogenous ERGIC-53 (Fig. 8 B, a and b) , while localization of a construct containing both the cytoplasmic and the lumenal domain of ERGIC-53, L53T4C53, was indistinguishable from GM (not shown). This difference in localization may be due to the reduced influence of the RSQQE determinant in the CD4-chimera L4T4C53. Indeed a CD4-chimera lacking the KKFF-retrieval signal, L4T4C53 (K-4stop), acquired 32% endo H resistance after 1 h of chase (not shown) considerably more than the 12% for the corresponding mutation in L53T4C53 (Fig. 6 , line 5).

This assay reveals subtle changes in the overall retention of GM mutants in the pre-mediaI-Golgi recycling pathway, provided the expression levels of the different constructs are comparable, a condition that was met in our experiments. However, the assay does not discriminate between recycling of overexpressed ERGIC-53 (GM) from post-medial-Golgi compartments and transport to the cell surface. Three findings argue against a major contribution of recycling from late Golgi sites. First, ER-localized GM in highly overexpressing COS cells failed to costain with FITC-ricin, a lectin recognizing -(1,4)-linked galactose added in the trans-Golgi (not shown). Jackson et al. (1993) reported ER staining by Helix pomatia lectin (recognizing terminal GalNAc) and peanut lectin (recognizing terminal Gal-(1,3)-GalNAc) in cells overexpressing an O-glycosylated CD8/E19 chimeric protein possessing a di-lysine ERretrieval signal. While this result is evidence for recycling of a di-lysine protein via the Golgi apparatus it does not necessarily indicate recycling from the trans-Golgi. Helix pomatia lectin recognizes terminal GalNAc added both in the cis-Golgi (Roth et al., 1994) and the trans-Golgi (Roth, 1984) , and peanut lectin binds glycans in the medial-Golgi (Roth, 1987) . Second, we found a strict correlation between the acquisition of endo H resistance and mislocalization to the cell surface of the different mutant proteins. Third, we have shown that ERGIC-53 contains a functional di-lysine ER-retrieval signal, and a recycling pathway from the ERGIC and the cis-Golgi is consistent with the major localization of coatomer, the putative receptor for di-lysine signals (Oprins et al., 1993; Cosson and Letourneur, 1994; Letourneur et al., 1994) . Collectively, our data argue against ERGIC-53 recycling from the trans-Golgi to biosynthetically earlier compartments. We conclude therefore that the acquisition of endo H resistance reflects loss of intracellular retention of ERGIC-53.",

However, the cytoplasmic domain alone is not sufficient to target a monomeric reporter protein, L4T4C53, identically to endogenous ERGIC-53. A comparison of the acquisition of endo H resistance between monomeric L4T4C53 K(-4)stop and oligomeric L53T4C53 (K-4)stop, both lacking the KKFF ER-retrieval signal, is most consistent with the idea that the RSQQE determinant is reduced or nonfunctional in the monomeric background. But how could oligomerization influence the RSQQE determinant? Two of the four cysteine residues, which could potentially link ERGIC-53 oligomers by disulfide bridges, are located within a 15-amino acid distance from the transmembrane domain. Provided these cysteines covalently link the ERGIC-53 oligomers in the immediate vicinity of the membrane, this could actually lead to a close apposition of the RSQQE determinants on the cytoplasmic side of the membrane.

Alternatively, ERGIC-53 may act as a chaperone downstream of calnexin Helenius, 1994) adding an additional level of quality control in the maturation process of glycoproteins. Either of these functions would involve the lumenal domain. Ligand binding may exert an allosteric effect on the cytoplasmic domain modulating the interaction with coatomer and thereby regulate the cycling of ERGIC-53. If so, a contribution of the lectin domain to sorting would only be apparent at moderate expression levels when enough ligand is available.

Localization of ERGIC-53 in the ER/ERGIC/cis-Golgi system is a result of retrieval and retention. In line with the most recent suggestion that COP's may not be involved in anterograde transport but in selective retrieval of di-lysine-signal-bearing proteins (Letourneur et al., 1994; Pelham, 1994) it is conceivable that KKFF is a retrieval signal whose binding to COPs is weak due to the presence of two COOH-terminal phenylalanines. Reduced COP binding may result in less efficient retrieval that in turn would shift the overall distribution from ER to ERGIC. In contrast, RSQQE together with the lumenal domain may function as a retention signal leading to the known concentration of protein ERGIC-53 in the ERGIC. Subcellular fractionation and COP binding studies will be required to test the role of the individual targeting determinants.",

Subcellular fractionation experiments indeed showed that endogenous ERGIC-53 is retrieved to the ER from two sites.
