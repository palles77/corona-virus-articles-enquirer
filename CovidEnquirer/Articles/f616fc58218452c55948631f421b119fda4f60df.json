            "text": "Aminopeptidase N (CD13) is a widely expressed ectoenzyme with functions that do not always depend on its enzymatic activity: an aspect that has been overlooked. Numerous CD13-targeting tools have been developed in the last few years. Several of them are already undergoing clinical trials, and there are promising reports on the effectiveness of others in animal models of disease. However, their efficacy might be obscured by their effects on unrecognized functions of CD13, resulting in unexpected complications. The purpose of this review is (i) to discuss the various functions ascribed to CD13 and the possible mechanisms behind them and (ii) to consider some of the questions that need to be answered to achieve a better understanding of the biological relevance of these functions, a more precise interpretation of the results obtained after their manipulation and a more rational design of CD13-targeting agents.",

            "text": "CD13, a moonlighting ectoenzyme Proteins recognized to have multiple functions have been termed 'moonlighting proteins' [1] . Ectoenzymes are perfect examples because the number of functions in which they are implicated is rapidly growing [2] . Here, a variety of functions of one member of this family, aminopeptidase N (APN, also known as CD13; EC.3.4.11.2), will be discussed, demonstrating that this protein can be considered a moonlighting ectoenzyme. Importantly, many of the functions attributed to CD13 have been observed after crosslinking with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) [3, 4] , overexpressing or silencing the protein in various cell lines [5] or blocking its enzymatic activity with chemical inhibitors [6] , but a CD13-deficient animal has only recently been described [7] . Therefore, although the in vivo relevance of many of these functions has not yet been determined, the interest in CD13 as a therapeutic target has been progressively increasing [8, 9] . Surprisingly, one aspect that is rarely considered is the fact that CD13 is a multifunctional protein and thus its ligation or the inhibition of its enzymatic activity might result in complex and systemic effects. This is a common limitation of enzyme inhibition therapy, but it was not anticipated for CD13-targeting drugs because of a lack of knowledge of some functions of CD13. This problem might be exacerbated by the also unrecognized fact that enzymatic activity-dependent and -independent functions appear to act in concert. For these reasons, it is important to review the data on all putative and established functions of CD13 and to discuss the possible molecular mechanisms involved so that further investigation aimed towards the clarification of some of these aspects is stimulated.",

Their receptors are designated by the chemokine subfamily name followed by the letter 'R' (e.g. CXCR1). Ectoenzyme: an enzyme situated on the outer surface of a cell's membrane so that its active site is available to the exterior environment of the cell. Endocytosis: a process of internalization of extracellular material (liquids or small solid particles) into various intracellular compartments by invagination of the cell membrane. Fcg receptors: receptors for immunoglobulins of the IgG subtype. They are expressed in most leukocytes and are responsible for the effector functions of antibodies. They are important modulators of the immune response. Glycoforms: versions (isoforms) of a protein that differ on the type of glycan attached to them (i.e. two proteins would be of the same glycoform if they carried the same glycan). These differences in glycan composition occur during post-translational or co-translational modifications. Therefore, the amino acid sequence does not vary between glycoforms of the same protein.",

This phenomenon could explain some of the functions that are triggered by antibodies that do not block the enzymatic activity but that could reduce the membrane levels of CD13 [4] and, therefore, the aminopeptidase activity. Several molecules known to be associated with CD13 appear to regulate its trafficking as a mechanism to regulate its function [12, 13] . The potential importance of endocytosis in the regulation of the functions of CD13 is underscored by the reported mutations, single site polymorphisms and differences in the splicing frequencies of the human CD13 gene in patients with hematological malignancies. Some of these mutations lead to altered trafficking of CD13 [14, 15] , which could have pathophysiological implications.",

The region of hCD13 between amino acids 288 and 295 has been identified as essential for HCoV-229E infection [24, 25] . Enzymatic activity inhibitors or mutations of the active site do not affect virus binding to CD13. In most cases, CoVs of the serogroup 1 use CD13 as a receptor in a species-specific manner. However, feline CD13 serves as a receptor for all group 1 CoVs [26] . Differences in glycosylation between CD13 from the different species constitute one of the most important determinants for the species specificity of its receptor function [25] .",

First, CD13 is differentially expressed in discrete states of differentiation of normal and neoplastic myeloid cells. This phenomenon accounts for its well-recognized utilization as a diagnostic marker of certain types of leukemia and lymphoma. For instance, CD13 is expressed on the majority of leukemic myeloblasts in acute myeloid leukemia, and although it is expressed by lymphocytes at their earliest stages of differentiation, it becomes negative as these cells mature [35] . Second, CD13 expression is regulated by differentiation agents, such as phorbol esters, transforming growth factor-b (TGF-b), interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10 [36] . Finally, chemical inhibitors, such as bestatin and leuhistin, are known to modulate cellular differentiation in vitro. Although the specificity for CD13 has not always been demonstrated, in many cases blockade of the binding of bestatin by anti-CD13 antibodies results in a complete abrogation of its effect on differentiation. The phenomenon depends on the induction of the expression or secretion of growth factor or cytokine receptors, probably by inhibition of the enzymatic processing of peptides involved in their regulation [37] .",

In this regard, it has also been reported that high levels of hCD13 correlate with leukemic-cell resistance to apoptosis. This resistance is overcome by treatment with bestatin, suggesting an involvement of the enzymatic activity [42] . However, the intracellular concentrations of bestatin appear to be important for its effect on cell proliferation, suggesting a mechanism different from inhibition of membrane-bound CD13 [43] . Furthermore, bestatin appears to exert its effect on proliferation even in cells that do not express detectable levels of CD13. Therefore, further work is necessary to clarify the role of CD13 in cell proliferation because inhibitors of its enzymatic activity might act through CD13-independent mechanisms. However, the effect of mAbs and the reported regulation of CD13 expression by cell-cycle-related transcription factors [44] support a direct participation of CD13 in this process. Regardless of the mechanism, the clinical use of these chemical inhibitors might be hindered by their effect in cell proliferation and therefore this is an aspect that requires further investigation. Additionally, it has recently been shown that bestatin enhaces the sensitivity of cervical cancer cells to radiation, underscoring the Box 1.

Three-dimensional models of human APN/CD13 (hCD13) and the crystal structure of APN from E. coli have been published [92] [93] [94] [95] . In the latter, a four domain organization was described in which the catalytic domain interacts with all other domains and the active site is inside a cavity covered by the C-terminal a-domain. This structure might not be shared by hCD13 because their sequence identity is low and hCD13 is a membrane-bound dimer. However, epitope mapping studies and mutations of the catalytic site of hCD13, as well as similar structures in other metallopeptidases of the M 1 family, support an interaction between domains and a buried active site [93, 96] . A small entrance to the catalytic site would explain the restricted activity of hCD13 to short peptides (Figure 2b ). With regard to the conformations that might distinguish CD13 in tumors from normal vasculature [72] , distinct conformations depending on the relative positions of the monomers and their mode of interaction have been reported for rabbit and pig CD13, which are both dimeric, membrane-bound proteins [97] . Conformational changes associated with substrate binding might correspond to changes in the inter-monomeric spacing rather than on the intramolecular conformation of each monomer, and mAb crosslinking might trigger signaling because of the shortening in distance between monomers during oligomerization.",

Stable expression of membrane-bound CD13 on CL1-0 tumor cells or incubation with sCD13 greatly increases their migratory capacity. Cells expressing an enzymatically inactive mutant of CD13 also show increased migration, although they show less migration than cells expressing the enzymatically active form. CD13-targeting siRNA and highly specific chemical inhibitors block both the migration of endothelial cells (ECs) through matrigel and their motility during wound healing assays [5] . An anti-CD13 mAb was identified among mAbs raised against human fibrosarcoma cells and screened for inhibition of cell motility.

(b) Substrate or inhibitor binding to the initial contact site induces a conformational change that exposes the cryptic active site as well as other cryptic epitopes that lie close to it, resulting in activation or inhibition of the enzymatic activity [22] . This conformational change might also involve the release of galectins and, consequently, the concomitant unmasking of the carbohydrate moieties involved in ligand binding, which could explain the potentiation of signaling functions by substrates [78] . Upon the exposure of cryptic epitopes, anti-CD13 autoantibodies or ligands (c,d) bind to and crosslink CD13, resulting in oligomerization and signaling. In the absence of a pre-bound substrate, oligomerization by multivalent ligands, such as antibodies and viruses, might be sufficient to trigger signaling or internalization [3, 4] . (e) Additionally, substrate, antibody or virus-associated proteins regulate the endocytosis of CD13 [4, 11, 12] , which might constitute a mechanism of signaling and inhibition of its enzymatic activity and could be responsible for its dissociation from galectins and adaptor molecules.

            "text": "The function of CD13 in cholesterol uptake has stronger experimental support. It has been reported that CD13 is a target for Ezetimibe (Merck/Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals), an inhibitor of cholesterol intestinal absorption [62] . Although another protein, Niemann-Pick C1-like 1 (NPC1L1), was proposed to be the main target for the drug [63] , it has recently been reported that Ezetimibe is equally capable of reducing cholesterol uptake in NPC1L1deficient and wild-type mice [64] . Binding of photoreactive Ezetimibe to a 145 kDa protein on enterocyte membranes was shown to be sufficient for the effect of the drug, and purification of this protein identified it as CD13. Inhibition of cholesterol absorption by binding of Ezetimibe analogs to CD13 does not affect its enzymatic activity. Instead, it has been proposed that CD13 participates in the endocytosis of cholesterol by enterocytes and that binding of Ezetimibe to CD13 could: (i) affect its association with lipid rafts, inducing its internalization; (ii) downregulate the expression of raft-associated proteins implicated in cholesterol uptake (e.g. Fcg receptors and CD36); and/or (iii) interrupt the association of CD13 with Fcg receptors or CD36 by inducing a conformational change [65] . Because a functional cooperation between CD13 and Fc receptors has been reported [18] , a link between the role of CD13 on cholesterol uptake and Fcg receptor function can be proposed. It is known that lipoproteins regulate Fcg receptor expression and Fcg-receptor-mediated phagocytosis. Thus, given the importance of cholesterol uptake by phagocytes in atherosclerosis and the fact that Ezetimibe blocks CD13 and, to a lesser degree, CD10 participate in the metabolism of enkephalins. CD13 hydrolyses the N-terminal Tyr-Gly bond of Leu-enkephalin and Met-enkephalin, which might account for the short half-life of these peptides in vivo. Although resistant to hydrolysis by CD13, the neuropeptide substance P inhibits enkephalin cleavage by CD13 [101] . Angiotensins CD13 hydrolyzes the N-terminal Arg of angiotensin III to generate angiotensin IV. In normotensive and hypertensive rats, infusion of CD13 into the third ventricle causes lowering of blood pressure. Aminopeptidase inhibitors block this drop in blood pressure and increase vasopressin release as a result of the subsequent increase in the half-life of angiotensin III. Dietary salt regulates the expression of CD13 in the kidneys, and CD13 is more highly expressed in the kidneys of Dahl salt-resistant rats than in those of Dahl salt-sensitive rats. CD13 reduces basolateral Na + /K + ATPase levels via angiotensin IV receptor signaling [86] . Tuftsin",

CD13 is not an exception. Its role in the process of capillary tube formation and as a marker of angiogenic vessels has been extensively investigated. Studies using phage display technologies to identify tumor-homing peptides resulted in the discovery of the asparagine-glycine-arginine (NGR) peptide, which resembles the integrin-binding peptide arginine-glycineaspartic acid (RGD) [67] . Coupling antitumor drugs to the peptides RGD-4C or CNGRC (Cys-Asn-Gly-Arg-Cys) resulted in increased efficacy and lower toxicity. RGD peptides bind to av-integrins. However, the RGD-4C peptide does not compete for integrin binding with phages displaying the NGR motif, which suggested the existence of a different receptor for NGR. The sequence W N / D DGWL was identified as a peptide mimic of the binding site of the RGD peptide on integrins. The fact that this sequence is present in the extracellular domain of CD13 (amino acid 404) led to the discovery that CD13 functions as a receptor for NGR in tumor blood vessels and other vessels undergoing angiogenesis [67, 68] . Several studies have demonstrated the dramatically improved capacity of various drugs to target tumor angiogenic vessels in vivo when coupled to NGR or NGR-peptide liposomes [69] [70] [71] .",

However, it was demonstrated that NGR-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and certain CD13-specific antibodies bind exclusively to CD13 expressed in tumors and not to CD13 expressed in normal tissues. This suggested that a different isoform of CD13 is expressed in tumors, further underscoring the potential of the NGR peptide for tumor targeting [72] . Others have shown that although NGR-TNF does have some cytolytic activity towards CD13-expressing myeloid cell lines, this activity might depend on its binding to TNF receptors and not to CD13. However, the dose of peptide is critical. Thus, low doses of the drug permit efficient targeting without TNFreceptor-dependent toxicity [69] . Finally, the usefulness of NGR peptides as tools for detecting cardiac angiogenesis provides further evidence of the specificity of NGR peptides for angiogenic vasculature and expands their use to diagnostic applications [73] .",

However, high doses of bestatin and antibodies were required, raising concerns over the potential therapeutic use of these tools. A recent publication addresses this concern, showing that continuous treatment with therapeutic doses of bestatin, but not other aminopeptidase inhibitors, results in abrogation of capillary tube formation, suggesting that the effect of bestatin is not specific for CD13 [6] . Nevertheless, many other studies have demonstrated the capacity of both bestatin and anti-CD13 antibodies to block angiogenesis in vivo, as well as the potential prognostic significance of CD13 in relation to angiogenic properties in some types of cancer [46] . Finally, CD13-null mice have unequivocally proven the importance of this molecule in angiogenesis [7] . These mice have dramatically decreased retinal neovascularization under hypoxic conditions, as well as reduced angiogenic responses to growth factors. One of the mechanisms involved appears to relate to the association of CD13 with galectin-3 in ECs [75] . Galectin-3 has been proposed as a therapeutic target for tumors originating from malignant endothelia. Therefore, the functional association between CD13 and galectin-3 underlines their importance for antiangiogenic therapies.",

More recently, it was found that crosslinking of CD13 on human monocytes results in a strong homotypic aggregation (HA) phenomenon that is signal-transduction-dependent but independent of enzymatic activity.

            "text": "For the time being, it appears straightforward to predict that the most promising approaches are those using CD13 to target drugs into tumor vessels instead of those directly modulating CD13 functions. The NGR peptide, when coupled to TNF-a, melphalan, doxorubicin, interferon-a and endothelial-monocyte-activating polypeptide II, has already been demonstrated to improve their efficacy in vivo [84, 85] . However, although the current reports are -Binding to discrete glycoforms of the protein could be used for tissue specific targeting or for the design of recombinant antibodies [20] -Some antibody clones could be used for signaling modulation or inhibition of viral infection promising both with regard to the low antigenicity of the peptide and to its specificity for tumor vessels, the potential of targeting other cell types, such as myeloid cells, has not been completely ruled out. New insights into these issues will hopefully result from basic research and clinical trials currently under development, in which understanding the mechanism of action of the drug will be a major goal. Finally, except for some studies on the regulation of blood pressure and nociception by CD13 in rodents [86] , many of the functions discussed here have been observed in vitro exclusively. Only recently have animal models of diseases, such as IBD and experimental autoimmune encephalitis, been utilized [83] . Therefore, given the importance of some of the functions discussed and the dramatic effect of CD13 manipulation in vitro, the next challenge for translational progress in the field will be to take these studies into in vivo systems to allow a better understanding of their real pathophysiological relevance, as well as more rational design of CD13-targeting drugs. Two of the most critical aspects yet to be studied (Box 2) are the threedimensional structure of the human protein and the expression profile of the different glycoforms or conformations of the protein in normal and diseased human tissues.",

Are there distinguishably different glycoforms or conformations of CD13 in normal versus diseased tissue that can be used to improve the targeting properties of the NGR peptide or to design new targeting peptides? Does virus binding to CD13 trigger signaling cascades that modify the migratory or adhesive properties of the infected cells? Is this a common mechanism of coronavirus or other viral infections? Do CD13-specific autoantibodies participate in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases? How is the trafficking of CD13 regulated? Is ligand-induced endocytosis a mechanism of regulation of its enzymatic activity? What is the importance of the association between CD13 and proteins such as galectin-3 and galectin-4 in vivo? Does CD13 participate in the physiological uptake of cholesterol? Is the cooperation between CD13 and Fc receptors relevant for cholesterol uptake by monocytes in the atherosclerotic plaque? 35",

Dimerization occurs between domains VII from each monomer, as indicated by AE signs. N-glycosylation sites are indicated with black arrows and O-glycosylation sites with pink arrows. Amino acids (aa) forming each domain are indicated on the left. Modified from Ref. [16], with kind permission of Springer Science and Business Media. According to the authors, the original model was based on electron microscopic studies of the purified enzyme, knowledge of the exon-intron organization of the gene and computer-aided structure predictions. (b) Schematic hypothetical four-domain model of human CD13, as proposed in Box 1. The possible conformational changes occurring upon substrate binding and the available data on the structure of other human enzymes were taken into account to modify the previous model. The active site (domain III) would be covered by the Cterminal domain (IV)",
