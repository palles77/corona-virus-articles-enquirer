            "text": "fections such as the common cold, coronavirus pathogenesis research has focused primarily on animal infections. Rodent infections with neurotropic strains of MHV have been studied as models for acute and chronic virus-related neurological disease.9,39so Strain JHM (MHV-JHM) is highly neurotropic and causes a fatal acute encephalitis following intranasal inoculation of suckling and adult C57B1/6 mice.\" Mice passively immunized against the virus or infected with an attenuated strain do not develop an acute encephalitis, but instead often manifest a chronic demyelinating disease characterized by hindlimb paralysis. 6,10, '8,26,53 This virus-induced demyehnation serves as a model for multiple sclerosis. Evidence from several studies indicates that MHV enters the CNS via the olfactory nerve following intranasal inoculation and spreads to many of the primary and secondary connections of the main olfactory bulb (MOB). 32'*o,54-55 Both chemical deafferentation and surgical removal of the MOB prior to intranasal inoculation prevent CNS entry and show that virus entry via the trigeminal nerve is insignificant.2,s6 The structures infected by MHV-JHM and the temporal sequence of their infection strongly suggests that this virus, like many other neurotropic viruses, spreads transneuronally into and throughout the CNS. E. M. BARNETT PI u/ HSV-I is a human pathogen which usually causes recurrent, localized vesicular lesions. but is also an important cause of sporadic cases of severe encephalitis. HSV-1 causes encephalitis in mice and rats following intranasal inocuIation'Y~47 and, unlike MHV-JHM, can enter the rodent CNS from peripheral inoculation sites such as the tongue,74 the eye3' and the tooth pulp (Barnett E. M., Jacobsen G. and Perlman S., unpublished data). As is the case with MHV-JHM, the pattern of the resulting infection is suggestive of transneuronal movement of virus and, as such, HSV-1 has proved useful for tracing neural circuits. 5, 28, 47 Our initial studies with MHV-JHM suggested that after intranasal inoculation the virus spread along different pathways from the MOB as compared to previous studies with HSV-1. For example, several workers47,75 reported HSV-1 infection of the locus coeruleus (LC) in rats and mice following MOB infection, whereas we could not detect MHV-JHM in this structure. Based on these preliminary results, we determined the extent to which these two neurotropic viruses infected different CNS structures after infection of the MOB. Although studies have been performed describing the pattern of virus spread for wild-type and attenuated strains of several neurotropic viruses, 8,36,U this is the first to compare the transneuronal spread of two different viruses using exactly the same experimental design. The possible differential spread of viruses throughout the brain has important implications for the use of viruses such as HSV-1 as neuroanatomical tracers, as it has been generally assumed that such viruses spread nonspecifically throughout the CNS along all the available pathways from an infected structure. Such differential localization would also suggest that different viruses could cause different neurological diseases, depending on precisely which connections of the olfactory nerve were infected.",

This finding suggests that either MHV-JHM lacks the ability to infect noradrenergic fibers arising from the LC or, alternatively, that the virus does not cross the appropriate synapses to gain access to LC terminals. Recent studies indicate that, in the rat, the noradrenergic input from the LC terminates in the internal and external plexiform layers and granule cell layer in the MOB, but not in the glomerular layer.48 The granule cells of the MOB form dendrodendritic contacts with mitral and tufted cells,62 which provide efferent fibers of the MOB. A failure of MHV-JHM to enter the granule cells via the dendrodendritic contacts with the mitral and tufted cells would prevent access to the noradrenergic input from the LC. Inability of MHV-JHM to infect LC neurons appears more likely since MHV-JHM infection of the internal granular layer of the MOB was seen following intranasal inoculation. In addition, direct MOB inoculations of MHV-JHM, which would be expected to expose LC terminals to virus, did not result in infection of this structure.

In addition, the cellular location of the receptor on neurons might determine whether anterograde transneuronal movement occurs.

This specificity suggests that different viruses will be useful for analysing different neural circuits originating from a structure.
