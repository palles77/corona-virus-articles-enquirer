These samples were submitted by veterinary clinics in Japan (Aomori, Tochigi, Ibaraki, Saitama, Chiba, Tokyo, Kanagawa, Osaka, Hyogo, Kochi and Okinawa). Viral RNA was extracted from rectal swabs using the High Pure Viral RNA Isolation Kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) following the attached instructions. cDNA was amplified by PCR using specific primers as shown in Table  1 . PCR was performed using the method of Takano et al. [13] . ELIF-ELIR used to detect CCoV-I also detects FCoV-I. Thus, the ORF3f-ORF3r primer set which specifically detects only CCoV-I was also used. The CCoV gene was detected in rectal swab samples collected from dogs. CCoV N gene was detected in 27/101 (26.7%). CCoV-I S gene, CCoV-II S gene and CCoV-I specific ORF3 gene were detected in 21/101 (20.8%), 2/101 (2.0%) and 24/101 (23.8%), respectively. On the basis of the rate of CCoV N gene-and ORF3 gene-positive CCoV-infected dogs, the type of CCoV detected in samples from CCoV-infected dogs was CCoV-I in 88.9%. The CCoV-I S gene fragments (PCR products generated using ELIF-ELIR) were sequenced as described by Takano et al. [15] . Amino acid sequences were deduced from the CCoV-I S gene detected in 4 dogs with diarrhea symptoms (Nos.9, 19, 27 and 33) and 2 dogs without diarrhea symptoms (Nos. 55 and 73) (Fig. 1A) . All of 6 CCoV strains detected in this study were classified into the clade of the other CCoV-I (Fig. 1B) .",

We retrospectively investigated the seroprevalence of CCoV-I in dogs in Japan during 1998 to 2006. Serum samples from 695 dogs collected from various regions throughout Japan were examined for the prevalence of antibodies to FCoV-I and CCoV-II by neutralization test. These samples were submitted to veterinary clinics in Japan: the Hokkaido region (Hokkaido); the Tohoku region (Aomori, Akita, Miyagi, Yamagata and Fukushima); the Kanto region (Tochigi, Ibaraki, Gunma, Saitama, Chiba, Kanagawa and Tokyo); the Chubu region (Niigata, Nagano, Toyama, Ishikawa, Fukui, Shizuoka, Yamanashi, Aichi and Gifu); the Kinki region (Osaka, Kyoto, Nara, Shiga, Mie and Hyogo); the Chugoku region (Okayama, Hiroshima, Tottori and Yamaguchi); the Shikoku region (Tokushima, Ehime and Kochi); and the Kyushu region (Fukuoka, Nagasaki, Kumamoto, Oita and Miyazaki). Of the 695 serum samples used, 405 were collected from dogs with an unclear vaccination history. The remaining 290 samples were collected from dogs previously treated with CCoV vaccine. Neutralization test was performed by using modified method based on the report described by Takano et al. [14] . Briefly, Serial two-fold dilutions of the test sera were mixed with an equal volume of FCoV-I KU-2 strain (isolated in our laboratory) or CCoV-II 1-71 strain (supplied by Dr. E. Takahashi of the University of Tokyo) suspension containing approximately 200 TCID 50 /100 \u00b5l, and mixtures were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 60 min. Each mixture was inoculated into fcwf-4 cells in 96-well microplates, followed by incubation at 37\u00b0C for 3 days in an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 . The antibody titer was expressed as a recipro-cal of the highest dilution of the test sera that completely inhibited the cytopathic effect. 540 (77.7%) of the 695 sera were positive for neutralizing anti-FCoV-I antibodies, and the neutralizing antibody titers ranged from 1:5 to 1:80. Neutralizing anti-FCoV-I antibodies were detectable in sera collected in 1998 (positive rate: 86.7%, 52 of 60 serum samples). The antibody-positive rate tended to decrease after 2001.",

Based on this finding, CCoV-infected dogs younger than one year old are likely to develop diarrhea, whereas one-year-old or older dogs are unlikely to develop The ORF 3 gene was detected in 88.9% of the CCoVinfected dogs. Since the CCoV ORF 3 gene is specific to CCoV-I [7] , this finding confirmed the presence of CCoV-I in Japan, as reported by Soma et al. [12] , and suggested that CCoV-I is dominant in CCoV-infected dogs in Japan. When the CCoV-I infection rate was compared between dogs younger than 3 months old and 3-month-old or older dogs, no difference was noted, and the CCoV infection rate in dogs younger than 3 months old was similar to that in 2-year-old or older dogs.

Thus, using canine sera collected between 1998 and 2006, the presence of anti-CCoV-I antibody earlier than 2007 was investigated employing the neutralizing antibody test. However, in the absence of CCoV-I laboratory strain, we used FCoV-I that shares high sequence homology in the S protein with CCoV-I. Neutralizing anti-FCoV-I antibodies were detected in serum samples from dogs in Japan. It was assumed that the neutralizing anti-FCoV-I antibody-positive dogs had been: i) infected with CCoV-I showing high-level genetic homology with FCoV-I or ii) infected with FCoV-I. It is also strongly suggested that CCoV-I-infected dogs and FCoV-I-infected dogs were mixed in the dogs from which sera were collected. However, regarding ii), to our knowledge, infection of a dog with FCoV has not been reported. In any case, it was clarified that 77.7% of dogs in Japan possess antibodies against FCoV-I and/or CCoV-I. It is suggested that FCoV-I and/or CCoV-I are widely prevalent in dogs in Japan since 1998. To closely investigate CCoV-I or FCoV-I infection in dogs, it is necessary to perform similar tests using both CCoV-I and FCoV-I. However, no assay detecting only anti-CCoV-I antibodies is available. Development of a method to detect anti-CCoV-I antibodies is desired.",

A dot indicates conserved amino acid indentity. B) A phylogenetic tree prepared based on the amino acid sequence of the C-terminal of S protein. The phylogenetic analysis is based on the deduced amino acid sequence of the 99 amino acids of the C-terminal of S protein. Phylogenetic relationships were determined using the neighbor-joining algorithm, and branching order reliability was evaluated by 1,000 replications of a bootstrap resampling analysis.
