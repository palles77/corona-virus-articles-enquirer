ORFs 2 to 7 were cloned in plasmids downstream of the Sp6 RNA polymerase promoter, and the translation of transcripts generated in vitro yielded proteins that could be immunoprecipitated with porcine anti-LV serum. Synthetic polypeptides of 15 to 17 amino acids were selected\" from the amino acid sequences of ORFs 2 to 7 and antipeptide sera were raised in rabbits. Antisera that immunoprecipitated the in vitro translation products of ORFs 2 to 5 and 7 were obtained. Sera containing antibodies directed against peptides from ORFs 3 to 7 reacted positively with LV-infected alveolar lung macrophages in the immunoperoxidase monolayer assay. Using these antipeptide sera and porcine anti-LV serum, we identified three structural proteins and assigned their corresponding genes. Virions were found to contain a nucleocapsid protein of 15 kDa (N), an unglycosylated membrane protein of 18 kDa (M), and a glycosylated membrane protein of 25 kDa (E). The N protein is encoded by QRF7, the M protein is encoded by ORF6, and the E protein is encoded by ORF5. The E protein in virus particles contains one or two N-glycans that are resistant to endo-iS-N-acetyI-Dglucosaminidase H. This finding indicates that the high-mannose glycans are processed into complex glycans in the Golgi compartment. The protein composition of the LV virions further confirms that LV is evolutionarily related to equine arteritis virus, simian hemorrhagic fever virus, and lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus.",

Blood samples were taken 42 days after infection. Gene-specific rabbit sera directed against ORFs 2 to 7 were obtained by use of synthetic peptides of 15 to 17 residues containing an amino acid sequence specific for each ORF. The amino acid sequences were selected on the basis of hydrophilicity, which was determined by the algorithms of Hopp and Woods (1981) and the antigen prediction program Asciflex (Janin, 1979; Parker et aL, 1986) . The peptides were conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin. SPF rabbits were immunized intramuscularly and subcutaneously with 1 mg peptide conjugated to keyhole limpet hemocyanin in complete Freund's adjuvant. After 1 month, the rabbits were given a booster injection of the same amount of conjugated peptide in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. The rabbits were bled at 12 weeks after the first immunization. Sera were tested for their reactivity with the various peptides in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), using pep'~ides coated to M96 plates (Suter, 1982) . Sera were also tested for their reactivity with viral antigen in an immunoperoxidase m0n01ayer assay (IPMA), essentially as described by Wensvoort et al. (1991) . Porcine alveolar lung macrophages were seeded in microtiter plates as described and grown for 16 hr. Then 50 #1 medium containing 10 3-104 TCID~o LV was added, and the macrophages were grown for 24 hr. The plates were then fixed and stained with the rabbit antipeptide sera and goat anti-rabbit IgG horseradish peroxidase, as described. As previously established, these incubation times resulted in 30% of the macrophages being infected and showing good cytoplasmic staining in IPMA. Sera 690, 694, 698, 704, 710, and 714 directed against ORFs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, respectively, were selected for further use in immunoprecipita-ti0n and Western blot analysis of viral proteins produced in vitro or in vivo.

ORFs 2 to 7 are 128 to 265 amino acids in length and possibly encode structural proteins of LV (Table 1) . These ORFs contain putative Nglycosylation sites, which may mean that they encode gtycoproteins. ORFs 2, 3, and 5 contain a hydrophobic amino terminus followed by a putative signal cleavage site as predicted by the method of Von Heijne (1986). These sequences may be involved in the transport of ORFs 2, 3, and 5 to the endoplasmic reticulum. ORF4 also contains an N-terminal hydrophobic sequence, but no signal sequence cleavage site was predicted. Hydrophobic sequences encoded at the carboxy termini of ORFs 2 and 4 and in the middle of the coding region of ORF5 may function as membrane anchors. ORF6 contains three putative membrane-spanning fragments at the N-terminus. The hydrophobicity profile of this protein is comparable to that of the membrane protein M of coronaviruses and toroviruses and the proteins encoded by ORF6 of LDV and EAV (Meulenberg eta/., 1993a) . This suggests a similar membrane topology and membraneassociated function. In contrast to the amino acid sequence of ORFs 2 to 6, the amino acid sequence of ORF7 is basic, it does not contain hydrophobic segments. Because the amino acid sequence of ORF7 closely resembles that of other viral nucleocapsid proteins, it is thought to be the nucleocapsid protein of LV.",

Figure 1 shows the translation products analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The apparent sizes of the products, translated in the absence of microsomal membranes were 26 kDa for ORF2, 27 kDa for ORF3, 19 kDa for ORF4, 20 kDa for ORF5, 18 kDa for ORF6, and 15 kDa for ORF7. Although the sizes of these proteins, determined by SDS-PAGE, do not necessarily correlate with true molecular weights, they are in fair agreement with the sizes that were estimated from the amino acid sequence (Table 1) . Translation of the transcripts of ORFs 2 to 5 in the presence of microsomal membranes resulted in larger products, the major protein bands being 30, 45, 31, and 25 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1) . The presence of microsomal membranes during translation did not affect the sizes of the gene products of ORFs 6 and 7. The expression of the ORF6 gene product was somewhat higher when microsomal membranes were added during in vitro translation. Maybe these membranes enhance translation or increase the stability of the membrane protein encoded by ORF6. The results indicate that the gene products of ORFs 2 to 5 were glycosylated during in vitro translation, whereas the gene products of ORFs 6 and 7 were not. The shift in size of the glycosylated gene products of ORFs 3 and 4 with 7 and 4 putative glycosylation sites, respectively (Table 1) , was greater than the shift in size of the gene products of ORFs 2 and 5 with both 2 putative N-glycosylation sites ( Table 1 ). The glycosylation of the gene products of ORFs 2 to 5 that were synthesized in the presence of microsomal membranes was further confirmed by digesting the products with PNGaseF, an enzyme which cleaves off N-glycans. This procedure reduced the size of the gene products of ORFs 2 to 5 to the size of the unglycosylated gene products (data not shown). For ORFs 2, 4, and 5 also a product of smaller size than the unglycosyiated products was observed, when translated in the presence of microsomal membranes (Fig. 1) , and increased in intensity after PNGase treatment (data not shown). These products may represent unglycosylated gene products from which the Nterminal signal sequence is cleaved off during membrane insertion. For ORF2 a second protein of smaller size than the unglycosytated protein was observed upon Fla. 2. RIP and SDS-PAGE of radiolabele.d proteins encoded by 0RFs 2 to 7 synthesized in vitro. The transcripts of the ORFs were translated in the absence (-) or presence (+) of microsemal membranes (M) and were immunoprecipitated with convalescent serum 21 collected from a pig infected with LV (A). As a control, the in vitro translation products of Brome mosaic virus (BMV) RNA (supplemented with the in vitro translation kit of Pharmacia) were immunoprecipitated with serum 21 (indicated as ORFC). The in vitro translation products of0RFs 6 and 7 and BMV RNA (indicated with C) were also immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody SDOW17 raised against a United States isolate of LV (B). Identical precipitation reactions were obtained with monoclonel antibodies SDOW12, WBE1, and WBE4 to WBE6. translation in the presence of microsomal membranes (Fig, 1) . The nature of this protein is not understood. The translation products of ORFs 6 and 7, when generated in the presence of microsomal membranes, did not change in size after treatment with PNGaseF (data not shown). This finding indicates that the putative N-glycosylation sites of ORFs 6 and 7 are not in fact glycosylation sites, at least in in vitro experiments.",

Serum 21 recognized three structural proteins with an apparent molecular weight (MW) of 25, 18, and 15 kDa (Fig. 4A ). in addition to these three proteins, two faint bands of 28 and 42 kDa were observed. These were not detected on the control strip incubated with a negative pig serum. Antipeptide serum 704 (specific for ORF5), recognized the 25-kDa protein (E) and a faint band of 42 kDa. We concluded that the E protein is encoded by ORF5. The much fainter protein band observed at 42 kDa might be a home-.or heterodimer of the ORFS-encoded protein, still present to a limited extent under denaturing conditions. Antipeptide serum 710 stained an 18-kDa protein (M), indicating that this structural protein is expressed from ORF6. Antipeptide serum 714 reacted with a 15-kDa protein (major band) and a 28-kDa protein (minor band). This finding proves that the 15-kDa protein (N) is encoded by ORF7.

To establish whether these proteins are similarly glycosylated in vivo, we treated purified LV with PNGaseF. The treated and untreated virus preparations were analyzed on Western blots stained with convalescent serum 21 and the antipeptide sera specific for ORFs 5, 6, and 7. As is shown in Fig. 4B , after treatment with PNGaseF the apparent MW of the E protein was reduced to approxirnately 17 to 18 kDa. The apparent MW of the dimer of the E protein was reduced from 42 to 34 kDa. The size 0fthe M and N proteins remained the same before and after treatment with PNGaseF. These results show that E is an N-glycosylated structural protein, whereas M and N are not. Furthermore, these results are in line with our endoglycosidase studies on in vitro translation products, mentioned above. If the apparent size difference (_+7 kDa) between the unglycosylated and glycosylated E protein correlates with true molecular weight, this would suggest that both putative N-glycosylation sites are functional in vivo. The 17-to 18-kDa backbone of the unglycosylated E protein (which was also observed after PNG-aseF treatment of the ORF5-encoded gene product translated in the presence of microsomal membranes)was smaller than the ORF5-encoded gene product (20 kDa) translated in the absence of microsomal membranes (Fig. 1) . This finding suggests that the signal sequence of ORF5 is removed during membrane insertion. The E protein was also treated with EndoH (an endoglycosidase that digests N-linked high-mannose N-glycans but not complex N-glycans) and was shown to be resistant, although not completely (Fig. 4C) . A shift in apparent molecular weight of +1 kDa was observed. We cannot explain this slight reduction in size after EndoH treatment. The EndoH digestion of other substrates was complete, under identical conditions. Although proteins containing both EndoH-resistant and EndoH-sensitive oligosaccharides have been observed by others (Vennema et al., 1990; Doyle eta/., 1986) , a shift in apparent molecular weight of +1 kDa, if correlating with true molecular weight, is too low to account for one EndoH-sensitive oligosaccharide. The E protein was completely resistant to endo-/~-galactosidase (Fig. 4C ). This indicates that E, in contrast to G~, the counterpart of E in EAV (de Vries etaL, 1992) , does not contain N-acetyllactosamine residues.",

These proteins have apparent molecular weights of 15, 18, and 26 kDa and are designated N, M, and E, respectively. The 15-kDa protein (N) is encoded by ORF7 and is not N-glycosylated.

The identity of the nucleocapsid proteins of EAV and LDV was established by virus fractionation experiments. After the virus particles were treated with detergent, only the N proteins of 15 to 16 kDa cosedimented with the viral genome in the bottom fractions of a sucrose gradient (Brinton-Darnell and Plagemann, 1975; Michaelides and Schlesinger, 1973; Zeegers et a/., 1976) . In a sucrose gradient layered with NP-40-treated LV virions, the N protein was found in the bottom fraction of the gradient at a density of 1.18 g/cm 3, whereas the M and E proteins cosedimented in the middle of the sucrose gradient at a density of 1.10 g/cm 3.

The E protein incorporated in virus particles was sensitive to PNGaseF, but partially resistant to EndoH. These findings indicate that during virus maturation, E is transported through the Golgi apparatus and its N-linked oligosaccharides undergo Golgi-specific modifications. The apparent size of E decreased about 1 kDa when virions were treated with EndoH, indicating that it contains an EndoH-sensitive Nglycan moiety. However, if this reduction correlates with true molecular weight, it is too small to account for one N-glycan moiety being removed by EndoH. We cannot explain this reduction.",

G~ migrated as a heterogeneous protein of 30 to 42 kDa on SDS-PAGE, because a variable number of lactosamine repeats were added to the N-linked core oligosaccharide. The E protein of LV, however, was not susceptible to endo-/3-galactosidase. Therefore the maturation of the N-linked oligosaccharide side chains of the E and G~ protein is probably different. The topology of the E protein is still unknown. Both the E and G~ proteins contain a large internal hydrophobic region, which might anchor these proteins in the membrane.",

(1993) in cell lysates of 0L2621 cells infected with LV or with a United States isolate of LV. Although we have generated gene-specific antipeptide sera, which recognized the N-glycosylated in vitro translation products of ORFs 2, 3, and 4, we were not able to detect the proteins encoded by these ORFs in cell lysates or purified LV. Perhaps these proteins were expressed only at very low levels in CL2621 cells and only small amounts of these proteins were incorporated in virus particles. Furthermore, the affinity of the polyvalent sera and monospecific peptide sera might not be high enough to detect such low amounts of protein. Alternatively, the ORF2, 3, and 4 gene products may be present in heterocomplexes that are not denatured under the conditions used. We do not yet know whether the gene products of ORFs 2 to 4 are structural proteins. The hydrophobicity profile of ORF2 of LV is similar to that of ORF2 of EAV and LDV. The gene product of ORF2, a 25-kDa glycoprotein designated Gs, was detected in a purified virus preparation of EAV (de Vries et aL, 1992) . It constituted only 1-2% of the virion protein and was not recognized by a polyvalent antivirion serum. Therefore it is not clear whether this protein is only incidentally incorporated into virions or is present in the virion preparation because it is contaminated with cellular proteins.",

The virus growth and cell labeling conditions must be improved in order to increase the amount of label incorporated in proteins of LV, which may allow us to perform pulse-chase experiments in labeled cells and RIP assays on purified labeled LV particles. In addition, the generation of more monospecific or monoclonal antibodies recognizing the gene products of ORFs 2 to 6 will be useful for further elucidation of the function and topology of these proteins. Until now, only monoclonal antibodies recognizing the N protein of LV have been isolated (Nelson et aL, 1993; Drew eta/., 1994) .",
