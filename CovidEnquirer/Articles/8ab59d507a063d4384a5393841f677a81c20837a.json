To stop the spread of an emerging disease, it is important to practice prevention guidelines correctly. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to investigate factors influencing preventive behavior against MERS-CoV among Korean nursing students. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study using a questionnaire survey. Data were collected from 429 nursing students from three colleges of nursing in Korea from June 25 to July 3 in 2015.",

Such behavior was also high in relation to the variables of perceived risk (\u03b2 = .232, p b .001), older students (\u03b2 = .202, p b .001), knowledge level (\u03b2 = .153, p b .01), and female respondents (\u03b2 = .115, p b .05). Conclusion: Preventive behavior against emerging infectious diseases such as MERS-CoV was found to be affected most significantly by attitude and risk perception. It is crucial to provide nursing students with information or knowledge, but it is also important to help those in nursing education recognize that active preventive behavior can prevent this infectious disease and stop its spread.",

Considering that patients continued to be diagnosed with MERS even during the period of data collection, this score is not satisfactory. This result suggests that nursing students need special education on emerging infectious diseases and have preventive behaviors actively reinforced during a disease outbreak. The authors' university stopped nursing students' hospital practice, provided hand sanitizer in each lecture room, and required that students' temperatures be checked regularly as part of its preventive measures against infection during the outbreak. However, there was no education specifically on MERS-CoV and preventive behaviors against this contagious disease.

Previous studies on MERS and SARS found women to be more likely to perceive risk (Brug et al., 2004; Khan et al., 2014) . In addition, a previous report that perceived SARS risk was correlated with preventive behavior (Brug et al., 2004) explained that gender is a factor influencing preventive behavior. However, because approximately 90% of the participants of this study were women, it is hard to generalize this result. Expanding the sample to include both men and women evenly and analyzing the correlations and mediating effects of the three variables of gender, risk perception, and preventive behavior would address this limitation.",

Lastly, because there was not a standardized scale designed to measure attitude toward infection control, the authors developed and used a new tool to evaluate this factor in relation to MERS-CoV, and psychometric properties were not extracted separately for the scale in factor analysis. Thus, attitude toward MERS-CoV measured in this study might not reflect psychometric properties adequately.",
