The number of radiographs obtained for each patient ranged from 4 to 50 (mean SD = 17.18 9.84). The hospitalized days ranged from 11 to 29 with a mean of 18.17 days; thus, an average of approximately one radiograph was obtained each day for each patient, particularly during the critical period.

The radiographic findings were recorded without the knowledge of the clinical data but with the knowledge that the patients were victims of suspicious or probable cases of SARS. Any differences in opinion were resolved by consensus. On each radiograph, each lung was divided into upper, middle and lower lung zones transversely, with each zone spanning one-third of the craniocaudal length of the lung. The severity of the SARS-related lesions within each lung zone was evaluated by scoring the radiographs with a four-point scale based on visual assessment, as follows: 0 = normal, 1 = up to one-third of lung zone involved, 2 = between one-third and two-thirds of lung zone involved, and 3 = more than two-thirds of lung zone involved. The scores for all 6 zones on each radiograph were added to provide a cumulative score that had a range from zero to 18 (Figs. 1, 2) . In addition, data collected from all available chest radiographs included the following: whether the SARS-related lesions were unilateral or bilateral; were associated with radiographically identifiable pleural effusion (defined as increased pleural density with obscuration of the costophrenic sinuses and the hemidiaphragm with meniscus-shaped or horizontal upper border); mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy (defined as widening or increased opacity of the mediastinum and pulmonary hila); cavitary lung lesions. The mean radiographic score for each patient during hospitalization was obtained by summation of the radiographic score on each radiograph divided by the total number of radiograph obtained. The maximal radiographic score for each patient represented the worst condition of lung opacities during the clinical course.",

In patients with SARS, the mortality rate for patients over the age of 50 years was 13 times higher than for patients younger than 50 years (17) . In contrast, two of our three expired patients were younger than 50 years; such an inconsistency might be partly attributed to a small number of patients in this series, a variable virulence of the infective agent, and the immune status of the host (17, 39) .",
