            "text": "Notably, there are limited data available to assess temporal trends in drug-resistant tuberculosis in high tuberculosis burden countries with concomitant high HIV prevalence. In South Africa, estimated tuberculosis incidence is declining by 0\u00b75% annually, most likely driven by increased coverage of antiretroviral treatment for HIV. 7 By contrast, drug-resistant tuberculosis as a proportion of tuberculosis increased between two national surveys in 2001 and 2012, primarily driven by an increase in rifampicin mono-resistant tuberculosis. 8 Systematic reviews suggest an association between HIV and drug-resistant tuberculosis, with increased risks of drug-resistant tuberculosis in individuals who are tuberculosis treatment naive, suggesting a stronger association for transmitted resistance than acquired. 9 However, HIV infection has also been associated with increased drug-resistance acquisition during tuberculosis treatment. 9 Taken together, these data suggest that any association between HIV and drugresistant tuberculosis depends on the epidemiological setting and highlight the necessity of improved tuberculosis drug-resistance surveillance in settings with a high HIV prevalence. 9 Until 2018, recommended treatment for drugresistant tuberculosis required lengthy courses of often toxic and ineffective drugs, with a treatment success of approximately 50%. However in the past 2-3 years, new and repurposed drugs have become available, allowing for shorter, all-oral, and more effective drug-resistant tuberculosis treatment regimens. 10 These regimens, combined with rapid diagnostics, offer the potential for improved treatment access even in the most resource-constrained settings. However, such scale-up will require substantial commitment, both on the part of governments of high-burden countries and global funders, if we are to avert a situation in which drugresistant tuberculosis becomes the new normal.",

Importantly, despite many WHO MERS expert group and other stakeholder meetings that have defined priority research needs, major knowledge gaps remain in the epidemiology, transmission, pathogenesis, and phylogenetic evolution of MERS-CoV. 6, 7 Major opportunities for appropriate longitudinal and cross-sectional studies to fill these gaps from the recurrent community and nosocomial outbreaks of MERS in Saudi Arabia are being missed. By contrast, several studies done after the 2015 MERS outbreak in South Korea yielded important epidemiological, clinical, virological, and management outcome data. 8 MERS-CoV sequence variants were detected during the South Korean outbreak, with some mutations incorporated into the circulating virus. Remarkably, the most extensively studied mutations, which occurred in the surface glycoprotein were not predicted. 8 The surface glycoprotein is crucial for virus entry and during the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic it evolved to bind more tightly to its cellular receptor. By contrast, changes detected in MERS-CoV-surface glycoprotein appeared to decrease binding and were expected to decrease virulence and transmissibility; 8 however, these changes could be beneficial to the MERS-CoV by facilitating evasion of the antibody response.",

And how do patients without contact with camels acquire the disease? Sequence analysis of MERS-CoV isolated from patients in the Middle East revealed mutations in the virus, most of which were transient with reversion to wild type sequence, 9 which is inconsistent with continuing adaptation to humans. Many of the virus variants were observed circulating in camels at the same time, 13 suggesting continuing camelto-human transmission, which might have obscured adaptive changes in the human virus. Small differences in sequences were observed when east African and Saudi Arabian MERS-CoV isolates were compared, with more substantial differences observed when compared with west African MERS-CoV, including deletions detected in west African MERS-CoV. 12 These differences might contribute to diminished transmission; however, another possibility is that differences might occur in human-camel contact in Africa versus the Middle East. Camel workers and owners have close contact with camels and thus have increased prevalence of MERS-CoV immunopositivity (3-67%) than the general population (0\u00b715%). 14,15 Camel workers have mild or subclinical disease, and they might transmit MERS-CoV either directly or indirectly to more susceptible individuals (eg, those with comorbidities) who would present as sporadic cases.",

First, continuous sequence analysis of MERS-CoV in endemic countries is needed to establish viral evolution, as was the case in the South Korean outbreak. Second, increased understanding of camel-human interactions and patterns of camel grazing in Africa and the Middle East could provide insight into transmission differences. Third, an effective vaccine for humans is the best way to prevent spread of MERS but logistical issues because of the small number of sporadic MERS cases in different geographical locations need to be overcome. Alternatively, vaccination of juvenile camels might block transmission. Fourth, development of antiviral and other therapies for MERS-CoV would improve patient outcomes and, by decreasing virus burden, could decrease transmission. Finally, continued efforts to educate camel workers about infection control measures, such as handwashing and wearing protective gear when handling camels, especially juvenile ones with upper respiratory tract infections, will be crucial in minimising transmission.",

Although coordinated global strategies have been developed and implemented for the prevention and control of NTDs, 1 the WHO list of NTDs omits an important disease: intestinal amoebiasis caused by Entamoeba histolytica, a silent killer in many low-income countries. E histolytica is the second leading cause of parasitic diseases glo bally 2 and causes substantial morbidity and mortality through invasive amoebic colitis and amoebic liver abscess.Patients with intestinal amoebiasis remain predominantly as asymptomatic carriers and invasiveness occurs only in a few individuals. Methodological difficulties result in variable estimates of the prevalence of intestinal amoebiasis, ranging from around 8-14% 3, 4 to as high as 40%. 5 In an era of global travel, E histolytica is the third most frequently isolated intestinal pathogen among travellers returning from low-income countries to higher-income countries presenting with infectious gastrointestinal disease. 6 The heavy burden of this intestinal pathogen becomes a greater threat to human life when invasiveness results in amoebic liver abscess. Amoebic liver abscess is the most common form of extra-intestinal amoebiasis and the fourth leading cause of mortality worldwide due to any parasitic infection, with an estimated 50 000 deaths annually caused",
