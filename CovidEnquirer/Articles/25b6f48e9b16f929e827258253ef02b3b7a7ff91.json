            "text": "WHO guidance, released in May, 2013, established that estimates of disease severity are key for risk assessment of novel infl uenza viruses. 1 Unfortunately, epidemiological assessment of severity is diffi cult in the context of an emerging disease, when estimates are most needed to guide pandemic response. The case fatality risk is an estimate of the proportion of patients with a specifi c disease who have died; however, both the numerator and denominator of this estimator are elusive. [2] [3] [4] Case detection is typically skewed towards patients with severe disease; laboratory-based case ascertainment can vary geographically and temporally; and there are delays between onset, death, and report ing, potentially leading to overestimation or under estimation of fatality risk. 2, 4 Much work has been done to refi ne estimates of case fatality risk in the wake of the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome and the 2009 infl uenza pandemic. 2 Diff erent denominators have been con sidered, including patients who have been admitted to hospital, 5 symptomatic cases, 5 and all individuals with serological evidence of infection. 6 From a statistical point of view, survival analysis provides an appropriate framework to quantify case fatality with right-censored outcome data. 2, 5 In The Lancet, Hongjie Yu and colleagues assess the clinical severity of human infection with avian infl uenza A H7N9 virus on the basis of data from 123 patients with laboratory-confi rmed infection who were admitted to hospital between March and May, 2013, in mainland China. 5 They estimate that the fatality risk for all ages was 36% (95% CI 26-45), and note that nearly all patients were admitted to an intensive care unit, received mechanical ventilation, or died (83%, 76-90). 71 (58%) of the patients were aged at least 60 years, and fatality risk was higher for these individuals (49%, 36-63) than for younger patients (18%, 6-29; p=0\u00b70019), as is typical of infl u enza infection. 6 To obtain an estimate of symptomatic case fatality risk, Yu and colleagues 5 extrapolated the total number of symptomatic individuals infected with avian infl uenza A H7N9 virus on the basis of the number of mild cases detected through routine infl uenza-like illness surveillance in Shanghai and Nanjing-the most aff ected cities. They estimate that the symptomatic case fatality risk could be between 160 (95% CI 63-460) and 2800 (1000-9400) per 100 000 symptomatic cases. This estimate is highly sensitive to assumptions about testing propensity, surveil lance coverage, and health-care seeking behaviour.",

Similarly, severity estimates for avian infl uenza A H7N9 virus will be refi ned as the fate of all patients admitted to hospital is resolved and as serological attack rates become available (attack rates could be generated from cross-sectional surveys because background population immunity is low 16 ) .",

            "text": "A remaining question relates to the age distribution of symptomatic infections should a zoonotic infl uenza virus acquire person-to-person transmissibility. So far, the age distribution of reported cases of infection with avian infl uenza A H7N9 virus has been skewed towards old ages, which is probably explained by behavioural age diff erences in exposure to the animal reservoir. 17 The age distribution of cases would probably shift towards younger ages in a full pandemic, resulting in a diff erent and potentially decreased case fatality risk. Another issue would be to account for potential changes in disease severity as the virus rapidly evolves. Although conventional wisdom stipulates that virulence attenuates as a pathogen adapts to a new host, animal experiments suggest that infl uenza virulence could increase simultaneously with genetic drift. 18 Furthermore, evidence from the 1918 pandemic suggests that the situation can escalate: case fatality risk increased by six times from the summer to the autumn of 1918. 19 The good news is that numbers of cases of avian infl uenza A H7N9 virus infection have stalled, probably in response to pre-emptive closures of live bird markets. However, the threat of this virus persists, and continued monitoring of infections, together with near-real-time estimation of case fatality risk and serological surveys, remains crucial. Investment in robust hospital surveillance of respiratory infections in a few globally sampled sites, combined with laboratory testing, would help to produce comparative severity estimates for novel and existing viral threats. Yu and colleagues 5 have provided the best severity estimates for avian infl uenza A H7N9 virus in view of the available information at this point in time; however, public health experts will have to make policy decisions on the basis of uncomfortably broad confi dence limits. Although progress has been made in reducing global maternal mortality, an estimated 287 000 women still died in 2010. 1 Maternal mortality disproportionately aff ects families living in low-income and middleincome countries, and most of these deaths are preventable. Eff ective and cheap interventions exist to prevent death from the major causes, including haemor rhage, hypertensive disease, sepsis, and septic abortion. What is lacking is evidence on imple mentation in view of local contexts, resource constraints, and cultural norms. 2 For many years, WHO has championed multidisciplinary maternal mortality audit as essential for reducing deaths. 3 For audit to achieve change, there must be willingness to identify problems, with leadership capable and motivated to institute changes. Audit involves far more than just counting deaths. Perhaps not surprisingly given the complexity of multidisciplinary audit, to date evidence from randomised trials that show a reduction in maternal deaths has been poor. 4 In The Lancet, Alexandre Dumont and colleagues address this knowledge gap with fi ndings from the QUARITE trial. 5 This cluster-randomised trial was done in 46 hospitals across Senegal and Mali. The authors assessed a complex intervention of maternal mortality audits, leadership development, training in emergency obstetric care, and outreach health practitioner education. Data for more than 190 000 women were collected over 4 years, giving the study power to detect a change in mortality. The intervention was based on the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada ALARM (Advances in Labour And Risk Management) International Program. This programme uses adult learning techniques to teach essential evidence-based obstetric skills. 6 Hospitals allocated to the control group did not partake in the intervention and continued usual care.",
