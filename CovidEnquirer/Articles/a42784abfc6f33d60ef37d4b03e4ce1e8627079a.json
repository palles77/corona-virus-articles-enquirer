Therefore, patients with positive nucleic acid tests or typical imaging findings are sent to a designated infectious disease hospital for isolation, observation, and treatment. If the imaging diagnosis is ignored, it may greatly threaten medical personnel and the public. Early imaging features of the disease in the chest include multiple small patchy opacities and interstitial changes. In the advanced stage, multiple ground glass-like opacities can be seen, often in both lungs. In severe cases, obvious consolidation is present. These findings are not accompanied by pleural effusion. If there are typical imaging features of coronavirus pneumonia, a nucleic acid test is not required to confirm the diagnosis (6) .",

Many countries have instituted measures to stop the spread of the virus throughout the world. Currently, many hospitals in China have only limited amounts of medical supplies. As one of the first areas in which patients are seen, the radiology department should not delay the use of hierarchical management of the department. Our department is a noncentralized isolation hospital outside of the Hubei region. The patients are diverse, and the medical staff is at risk of infection. Although there may be some deficiencies in the regionalized management of our institution, preliminary prevention and control work can still be promptly instituted. In the face of acute infectious diseases, including SARS, MERS, Zika virus infection, and Ebola virus infection (7), it is very important to maintain strict isolation procedures in the radiology department. This not only protects the medical staff but also improves their clinical work (8) .",
