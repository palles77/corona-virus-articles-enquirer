Recent studies point out to a cell entry mechanism of this virus similar to other enveloped viruses, such as HIV-1. As it happens with other viruses peptidic fusion inhibitors, SARS-CoV S protein HR2-derived peptides are potential therapeutic drugs against the virus. It is believed that HR2 peptides block the six-helix bundle formation, a key structure in the viral fusion, by interacting with the HR1 region. It is a matter of discussion if the HIV-1 gp41 HR2-derived peptide T20 (enfuvirtide) could be a possible SARS-CoV inhibitor given the similarities between the two viruses. We tested the possibility of interaction between both T20 (HIV-1 gp41 HR2-derived peptide) and T-1249 with S protein HR1-and HR2-derived peptides. Our biophysical data show a significant interaction between a SARS-CoV HR1-derived peptide and T20. However, the interaction is only moderate (K B = (1.1 T 0.3) \u00c2 10 5 M \u00c01 ). This finding shows that the reasoning behind the hypothesis that T20, already approved for clinical application in AIDS treatment, could inhibit the fusion of SARS-CoV with target cells is correct but the effect may not be strong enough for application.

            "text": "The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was caused by a novel coronavirus, the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [1 -5] . As SARS-CoV can replicate in an animal reservoir, it might be reintroduced in the human population (even as a more dangerous strain), originating a seasonal disease [6] . Considering that there is no specific treatment for this infection, it is necessary to develop antiviral agents to prevent possible future epidemics. Coronavirus are enveloped viruses and their entry into target cells is mediated by the spike (S) envelope glycoprotein [5, 7] . Although SARS-CoV S protein can be classified as a class I viral fusion protein, some features set it apart: for instance, cleavage between the S1 and S2 subunits of the S protein is not a requirement for fusion [5, 7] . The S1 domain (N-terminal region) contains the sequence responsible for the binding to the SARS-CoV cell receptor ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) [8, 9] . The S2 domain (membrane-anchored C-terminal region) mediates membrane fusion, and contains two heptad repeat regions, HR1 and HR2, forming coiled-coil structures [10 -14] . In a number of viruses, including SARS-CoV [10 -14] , HR regions have determining importance for viral fusion: these regions form a six-helix bundle structure, consisting of an inner trimeric coiled coil formed by HR1 domains, with HR2 domains surrounding the trimer, packed in antiparallel orientation. This structure brings the viral and cellular membranes into close proximity, leading to membrane fusion. Synthetic peptides derived from the HR were shown to inhibit infection by either retroviruses 0304 (e.g., [15 -18] ), paramyxoviruses (e.g., [19] ) or coronavirus (e.g., [20] ). The peptides derived from the HR2 region can inhibit infection by interfering with the six-helix bundle formation. Thus, based on the behavior of other enveloped viruses like HIV-1, recent studies have suggested a cell entry mechanism of SARS-CoV similar to viruses with class I viral fusion proteins [10 -13] . The potential of HR2-derived peptides as inhibitors of SARS-CoV infection was demonstrated [10, 12, 14] . In addition, based on a structural analysis of HIV-1 gp41 and SARS-CoV S protein, Gallaher and Garry proposed that T20 (enfuvirtide) could inhibit SARS-CoV infectivity, although with a limited activity [21] . T20 is a HIV-1 gp41 HR2-derived peptide that blocks entry of HIV-1 into the target cells, which is already in clinical use [22] . T-1249 is a secondgeneration HIV-1 fusion inhibitor with promising results [23] . In the present study, we have explored the potential of the HIV-1 HR2-derived peptide T20 and the related peptide T-1249 against SARS-CoV, using S protein HR1-and HR2-derived peptides ( Table 1 ). The results obtained confirmed the occurrence of an interaction between the HIV-1 peptides and peptides derived from SARS-CoV HR1 as speculated [21] . However, the interaction does not seem to be strong enough to grant therapeutic efficiency, which justifies the limited activity foreseen by Gallaher and Garry [21] and recently confirmed in infectivity assays [24] .",

It was shown before that this probe can be used to study peptide assemblies [30] . Therefore, we used the increase in ANS fluorescence intensity (increased quantum yield) to study the existence of hydrophobic binding between T20 or T-1249 and S peptides because this binding may lead to the formation of hydrophobic grooves where ANS can insert, with a concomitant increase in fluorescence intensity. To evaluate peptides interactions, pair-wise tests were carried out. Small amounts of one peptide were added to the other peptide/ANS sample. For each pair of studied peptides, reverse titration (i.e., titration of the first peptide with the second) was also carried out. To take into account eventual self-aggregation of the titrating peptide, all peptides were used to titrate ANS samples in buffer. The results show that Pep 1D ( Fig. 2A) , T-1249 (Fig.  2C ) and Pep 1E (data not shown) self-aggregate. However, the ANS fluorescence increase observed with the addition of Pep 1D to T20 is larger than the observed with Pep 1D alone (selfaggregation), which is indicative of mutual binding between these peptides- Fig. 2A . The T20/Pep 1E mixture also indicates interaction (data not shown). Although similar, T-1249/Pep 1D results exhibit a larger variability (Fig. 2C) . T-1249 does not interact with Pep 1E. Both T20 and T-1249 show no evidence of interaction when the other two S peptides are used (results for the T20/Pep 2B and T-1249/Pep 2B systems are shown in Fig. 2B and D, respectively, as an example). No DMSO effect on ANS fluorescence was detected. Peptides Pep 1D and Pep HR2 interact with each other (data not shown), in agreement with the results obtained by Liu et al. [12] . This result serves as a positive control of the method.",

HR2 peptides compete for binding to the HR1 region of the SARS-CoV S protein, blocking the six-helix bundle structure formation, and thus inhibiting fusion [10, 12] .

            "text": "T20 fluorescence increases in the presence of Pep 1D or Pep 1E (although with a better signal/noise ratio in the first case), but not in the presence of the other S peptides. The same occurs for T-1249, although the results are not so evident. This increase in the fluorescence quantum yield probably indicates tryptophan residues exposure to a less polar environment, protected from the aqueous environment [34] , revealing peptides interaction. Alternative explanations, such as a decrease in Trp fluorescence quenching by other peptide residues, cannot be ruled out. Nevertheless, the increase of ANS fluorescence intensity in the peptide/peptide titrations is an evidence for the formation of hydrophobic pockets. To assure that such increase is not due to the self-aggregation of the titrating peptide, instead of inter-association of different peptides, control experiments were performed in the absence of the titrated peptides. Although self-aggregation occurs for T-1249, Pep 1D and Pep 1E, a T20/Pep 1D inter-association of hydrophobic nature is evident. However, the titration of T20 with Pep 1D does not lead to precisely the same result as the opposite titration. The addition of Pep 1D to T20 lead to an ANS fluorescence increase larger than the increase caused by Pep 1D self-aggregation alone. The addition of T20 to Pep 1D does not result in a similar fluorescence increase. This occurs because T20 is not able to destroy Pep 1D aggregates, which prevent peptides interaction in a larger extent. The T20/Pep 1E and T-1249/Pep 1D systems lead to low signal/noise ratios, preventing straightforward conclusions. Yet, T-1249 and Pep 1E show no evidence for interaction. Both T20 and T-1249 show no interaction with HR2-derived peptides detectable by ANS fluorescence. fluorescence difference spectra (k em = 603 nm). The spectra were obtained by subtracting the excitation spectrum before the addition of peptides from the excitation spectra after the peptides addition (15 AM). Before subtraction, the spectra were normalized to the integrated areas so that the difference spectra reflect only the spectral shifts. (A) T-1249, (B) T20 and (C) S peptides.

            "text": "Di-8-ANEPPS was used to probe the peptides interaction with membranes. It is known from other studies that both T20 and T-1249 interact with membranes to a reasonable extent [31, 32] . In agreement with the previous results, T-1249 is the peptide that presents the most extensive interaction with membranes. From the comparison between all the fluorescence difference spectra intensity obtained (Fig. 3) , it can be concluded that the S peptides have a very low or even null partition to membranes. T20 and T-1249 membrane partition experiments were done in the absence and presence of S peptides (Fig. 4) . T20 partition curves in the absence and in the presence of Pep 1D do not overlap. One possible explanation is that peptides interact in the aqueous medium and this additional equilibrium (interaction) competes with partition, decreasing the molar fraction of the molecules in the lipidic bilayers. The same occurs for T-1249/Pep 1D and for both peptides in the presence of Pep 1E. However, the statistical quality of the results worsens in these cases. In the presence of Pep 2B or Pep HR2, the partition of both T20 and T-1249 is not affected. It is possible to quantify the equilibria balance and rationalize the altered partition plots (Appendix A). This analysis takes into account the partition of T20 and T-1249 to LUV of POPC and the interaction in the aqueous medium with S peptides. Data fitting with Eq. (A1.7) (Appendix A) for T20 in the presence of Pep 1D (Appendix A; Fig. A1 .2) leads to a binding coefficient of K B = (1.1 T 0.3) \u00c2 10 5 M \u00c01 (means T standard deviation of four replicates). This value is in between the values obtained for very strong and specific binding, such as the binding of the S1 domain of SARS-CoV to ACE2 (\u00a810 8 M \u00c01 ; Ref. [35] ) and the values expected for moderately specific association pairs (\u00a810 2 M \u00c01 ; Ref. [36] ).",

Taking into account that T20 is an HR2-derived peptide and Pep 1D is an HR1 peptide, our results seem to confirm at a first glance that SARS-CoV could be inhibited by T20, in agreement with the speculative reasoning by others [21] . Nevertheless, the interaction is too moderate to be able to provide therapeutic efficiency, even keeping in mind that SARS-CoV HR2 peptides are less potent fusion inhibitors than the corresponding HR2 peptides from other viruses [10, 12] . For SARS-CoV, the inhibitory peptides concentrations were in the micromolar range, while T20, for instance, has activity in the nanomolar range against HIV-1 entry. Although the inhibitory properties of HR2 peptides could be affected by many different factors, SARS-CoV six-helix bundle lower stability, caused by a weaker interaction between the HR1 and HR2 regions, could be directly correlated with a lower potency of the HR2 peptide in blocking the formation of this structure [10, 12, 37] .",
