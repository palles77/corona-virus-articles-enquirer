Our previous studies have demonstrated that the vaccines based on the RBD in the spike protein of SARS-CoV ( Figure 2A ) induced the most potent neutralizing antibody responses and protective immunity in vaccinated animals, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] suggesting that the RBDs in the spike proteins of other viruses that cause emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases, such as influenza virus ( Figure 2B ), HeV and NiV ( Figure 2C ), may also serve as targets for developing vaccines to prevent corresponding infectious diseases. 18 Here, we reviewed important advances in the development of antiviral vaccines that mainly target the RBD of spike proteins of some viruses which have caused serious emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases during the past three decades, and assess the feasibility of applying similar strategies in the design and development of vaccines against other emerging and re-emerging viruses.",

After it originated in Guangdong Province of China in 2002, 3 SARS rapidly spread to 29 countries and areas around the world. SARS-CoV, the causative agent, was identified in April 2003. 19 A total of 8098 SARS cases with 774 deaths were reported during the 2003 outbreak. Although SARS-CoV was believed to be eliminated from human circulation in July 2003, its brief recurrence in laboratory workers in China between late 2003 and early 2004 and its ubiquity in nature both pose a threat for its reemergence in human populations through zoonotic reintroduction, laboratory escape, or bioterrorism. 20 Thus, there is an urgent need for effective strategies against this devastating viral agent, especially in high-risk groups, including the elderly, healthcare workers and laboratory personnel.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV primarily transmits via droplets (respiratory secretions) and close person-to-person contact. It may exist in respiratory secretions, stools, urines and sweats in SARS patients. After entering the body, the virus binds to its receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, 21, 22 which expresses on the primary target cells, pneumocytes and enterocytes in the respiratory system, and other susceptible cells, such as intestinal mucosal cells, renal tubular epithelial cells, cerebral neurons and immune cells. 23 After permeating these cells, the virus replicates and is released to infect new target cells ( Figure 3 ). The production and activation levels of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines are remarkably elevated, causing significant lung tissue damage that results in atypical pneumonia with rapid respiratory deterioration and failure. 24 The S protein and its RBD of SARS-CoV SARS-CoV is an enveloped virus containing a single and positivestranded RNA. The genome RNA encodes nonstructural replicase polyprotein and structural proteins, including spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. 2,25 SARS-CoV 14, 17, 79 The residue numbers of each region represent their positions in the S protein of SARS-CoV. (B) RBD in influenza virus HA. Taking H5N1 as an example, HA consists of a globular 'head' HA1 subunit containing the receptor-binding domain RBD and a membrane proximal HA2 subunit with a-helical stalk region (FP). The leading sequence (SP) is located at the N-terminus of HA1. There is a protease cleavage site between HA1 and HA2 subunits characterized by specific amino acid sequences, e.g., RERRRKKR. HA1 and HA2 subunits were connected by interchain disulfide bond from HA1-aa14 to HA2-aa137. 80 infection can trigger a series of humoral and cellular immune responses, mainly targeting the S protein. 26, 27 The S protein of SARS-CoV is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein with its N terminus on the surface of the infected cell or the virus particle. Its precursor, consisting of 1255 amino acids (aa), can be cleaved by proteases into the surface subunit S1 (aa 17-680) and the transmembrane unit S2 (aa 681-1195) 28, 29 (Figure 2A ). S1 recognizes and binds to host cell receptors, leading to the conformational changes of S2 that mediate viral fusion between the viral envelope and the host cell membrane. 30 The minimal RBD of SARS-CoV S protein is located in the S1 subunit (aa 318-510) and is responsible for viral binding to host cell receptors 31, 32 (Figure 2A ). Besides the main receptor, angiotensinconverting enzyme 2, there are several alternative receptors, such as dendritic cell-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing non-integrin and/or liver/lymph node-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing integrin. 33 Two residues (aa 479 and aa 487) in RBD determine SARS progression and tropism, and their mutations may enhance animal-to-human or human-to-human transmission. 29 Some residues (aa 109, 118, 119, 158, 227, 589 and 699) in S protein are critical for dendritic cell/lymph node-specific intercellular adhesion molecule-3-grabbing integrin-mediated virus entry. 34 Vaccines based on the RBD of SARS-CoV S protein The roles of S protein in receptor binding and membrane fusion make it a perfect target for vaccine and antiviral development. Several vaccine candidates based on the full-length S protein of SARS-CoV have shown high immunogenicity in inducing neutralizing antibody responses and protection against SARS-CoV challenge. 8, 9 However, these vaccines may also induce harmful immune responses that cause liver damage in the vaccinated animals 10 and/or enhance SARS-CoV infection through an antibody-dependent mechanism. 9 All of these have raised significant concerns about the safety and ultimate protective efficacy of vaccines based on the entire S protein.",

Each of the single-chain monomers is initially synthesized as a precursor polypeptide, HA0, which is then cleaved by host proteases into two subunits, HA1 and HA2. The HA1 subunit is mainly responsible for receptor binding. It mediates viral attachment to the cellular receptors of the target cells known as sialic acid of glycoproteins and glycolipids. 45 Different HAs of IAVs recognize different sialic acid receptors. For example, the HAs from humans bind preferentially to sialic acids in the a (2,6) linkage, while those from avians and equines recognize a (2,3) linkages. It appears that the HAs from swine may recognize both a (2,3) and a (2,6) linkages. 46 After viral attachment to the target cells, the HA2 subunit located at the membrane-proximal helix-rich stem region mediates virus entry into the target cell by fusion of the viral envelope and the cellular membrane via the fusion peptide at the N-terminus of HA2. 45 The HA2 N-terminal fusion peptide contains the highly conserved sequence among all IAVs, and neutralizing epitopes targeting this region have been identified. 47 As the main region for binding cellular receptors, RBD is located at the membrane-distal end (HA1) of each HA monomer, spanning less than 300 aa (from residues around 105 to residues around 319, depending on different HAs). The receptor-binding site is composed of three structural elements, including the 190-helix (HA1 188-190) , the 130-loop (HA1 134-138) and the 220-loop (HA1 221-228), as well as several conserved residues at the W153, H183 and L194 positions. 45 The RBD of HA is the primary target of neutralizing antibodies, based on which anti-IAV vaccines can be designed and developed. 48 ",

However, these vaccines are mainly administered parenterally, limiting their ability to induce high immunity and efficacy in preventing heterologous virus infection. 49 Therefore, live-attenuated, cold-adapted influenza vaccines have been produced to increase immunogenicity. When injected intramuscularly into mice, these live influenza virus-based vaccines induced greater protection than those based on the inactivated virus. 50 Unfortunately, a safety concern arose from the possibility of recovering virulence or the potential re-assortment of the viruses with circulating influenza viruses. Although other available influenza vaccines, including those based on DNA, protein and viral vectors, as well as virus-like particles, may induce immune responses and/or protection against IAV infection, 51,52 their capacity to elicit highly potent and broad immune responses and protection is greatly restricted.",

            "text": "Discovery of the neutralizing epitopes in the RBD of IAV Neutralizing antibodies play critical roles in protecting against IAV infection. The neutralizing antibodies could be induced by virus infections or raised by vaccination with specific antigens. The produced antibodies may neutralize various viruses by first recognizing and targeting specific positions (epitopes) of viral antigens. Currently, a number of neutralizing epitopes have been identified by binding of the neutralizing antibodies to the exposed loops surrounding the receptor binding site of HA protein and interfering with virus attachment, or selecting antibody escape mutants. 53 Using genome-fragment phage display libraries, a group from the US Food and Drug Administration was able to map the epitopes of the neutralizing monoclonal antibody (mAb) FLD21.140 into two aa clusters in the RBD, 121-SWS-123 and 164-YNNT-167, the highly conserved sequences among clades 1, 2, 5, 6 and 8 of H5N1 viruses. 48 Using yeast surface display of neutralizing mAb NR2728 with a full-length H5 HA, researchers identified a conformation-dependent neutralizing epitope in the interface overlapping the receptor binding site of HA1. Another conformational epitope adjacent to the RBD was identified by mapping mAb S139/1 with HA. This mAb showed Receptor-binding domains-based antiviral vaccines SB Jiang et al 4 cross-reactive neutralization and HA inhibition against particular strains of H1, H2, H3 and H13 subtypes of IAVs. 54 Conformational neutralizing epitopes covering residues 125-129 and 157-169 at the apex of the RBD were identified by co-crystal structure of the 1918 HA with 2D1 mAb from a survivor of the 1918 Spanish flu. These epitopes were conserved in pandemic viruses causing the 1918 Spanish flu and 2009 swine-origin IAV. 55 Studies on the HA of Qinghai-type influenza H5N1 virus revealed other antigenic epitopes at the globular head region of H5 HA containing residues 113, 117, 118, 120 and 123. 56 Neutralizing epitopes at residues 260 and 261 of RBD were also identified using H5N1-specific neutralizing monoclonal Ab 9F4. These residues are well-conserved across different clades of H5N1 strains. 57 In addition to the above neutralizing epitopes identified by antibody binding assays, several immunodominant epitopes were identified by selection of escape mutants using neutralizing mAbs. These neutralizing epitopes cover residues at positions 138, 140, 155, 159, 189, 194, and 218 of RBD. 58 Other conserved neutralizing epitopes in the head region of HA1 were identified from naturally occurring antibodies F045-092 and F026-427. 59 The neutralizing epitopes at residues 178-181 and 227-239 of the receptor binding site of HA globular region were identified by two human neutralizing antibodies, B-1 and D-1, to H3N2 derived from different donors. These neutralizing epitopes are proven to be highly conserved in human H1N1, swineorigin pandemic H1N1, human H5N1 and avian H5N1 strains. 60 It was also reported that a neutralizing mAb, CH65, was capable of recognizing the receptor-binding pocket of IAV H1N1 HA, indicating that broad neutralization of IAV could be achieved by antibodies targeting the RBD pocket. 61 Prospective development of novel influenza vaccines based on the neutralizing epitopes in RBD of the IAV HA1 Identification of the above neutralizing epitopes in the RBD region brings hope for the development of innovative vaccines because the identified epitope regions may be applied as novel vaccine targets. Vaccines based on these neutralizing epitopes could induce neutralizing antibodies against a broad spectrum of IAV strains. Studies on the development of such vaccines have been initiated, and some of them have shown promising results. 62 It is reported that an E. coli-expressed recombinant protein, HA 63-286 -RBD, containing HA-RBD of the A/H1N1/2009 influenza virus, is immunogenic with the capacity to trigger neutralizing antibodies and induce protective activity in the tested ferret model. 63 Studies have shown that recombinant vaccines targeting the globular head RBD region fused to flagellin of Salmonella typhimurium fljB gene induced protective immunity to H1N1 and H5N1 infections in challenged mice. 62 It was demonstrated that a recombinant oligomeric protein covering H5N1 (A/Vietnam/ 1203/2004) HA1-RBD neutralizing epitopes elicited potent neutralizing antibodies in the vaccinated mice against homologous and heterologous H5N1 strains and protected ferrets from homologous and heterologous H5N1 challenge. 48 Previous studies by the same group also demonstrated the protective immunity of vaccines containing H1N1 (A/California/07/2009) HA1-RBD region against challenge of H1N1 pandemic influenza virus. A report by Prabakaran and colleagues indicated that a recombinant baculovirus-expressed trivalent vaccine covering the major neutralizing epitopes in the RBD of H5N1 effectively neutralized viruses from clades 1, 2.1, 2.2, 4, 7 and 8 of H5N1 and protected 100% of the mice against challenge with three different clades (clade 1.0, clade 2.1 and clade 7.0) of H5N1 strains. Our recent studies also revealed that a recombinant HA1-Fdc vaccine containing RBD neutralizing region induced high titers of antibodies that cross-neutralized clades 0, 1, 2.2 and 2.3.4 of H5N1 strains and completely protected vaccinated mice against high-dose lethal challenge of different strains of H5N1 covering clades 0, 1 and 2.3.4. 64 The above findings further support our hypothesis that the neutralizing epitopes in the RBD of IAV HA are attractive targets for development of universal influenza vaccines, which can be used to prevent future influenza pandemics or epidemics caused by emerging or re-emerging IAV strains.",

As newly defined viruses, HeV and NiV belong to the family Paramyxoviridae and genus Henipavirus. 5 The broad species tropism and the ability to cause severe diseases in both humans and animals distinguish HeV and NiV from other zoonotic viruses. Symptoms of HeV and NiV infection of humans can be respiratory, including hemorrhage and edema of the lungs, or encephalitic, resulting in meningitis. The principal natural reservoirs for HeV and NiV are pteropid fruit bats; however, recent evidence of henipavirus infection has been found in a wider range of species, including flying foxes, humans, cats, horses, rabbits and laboratory rodents 6 ( Figure 4) . Because HeV and NiV can potentially cause significant morbidity and mortality in humans, with consequent major economic and public health impact, they are classified as biological safety level-4 pathogens. 65 Both HeV and NiV have non-segmented, negative-stranded RNA genosomes consisting of transcription units encoding six major structural proteins, including nucleocapsid protein (N), phosphorprotein (P), matrix protein (M), fusion protein (F), glycoprotein (G) and large protein (L). 66 The G protein, which contains a length of 602 aa, is responsible for virus binding to the receptor and entry into the host cell.",

Mutations of some residues in the RBD of the G protein significantly impaired viral binding and fusion activities. 68 The G protein of HeV or NiV is comprised of a short cytoplasmic tail, a transmembrane domain, a stalk region and a globular head domain 68 ( Figure 2C ). The globular head region of the G protein contains the minimal RBD (aa 439-468) 68 (Figure 2C ). The G protein of HeV or NiV appears to be the dominant target antigen for neutralizing antibodies. 69 While no vaccines are available for the prevention of henipavirus disease in humans, several G protein-based henipavirus vaccine candidates have been tested in three different animal models. 70 Two of them using ALVAC canarypox as vector showed protection against NiV infection in pigs. A recombinant soluble G protein-based vaccine adjuvanted with CpG was shown to induce strong immune responses in a ferret NiV infection model, which could protect cats from NiV infection. 71 The first human neutralizing mAb, m101, with exceptional potency against HeV and NiV, was identified in 2006. 72 A panel of 17 alaninescanning mutants of the G protein of HeV was tested for binding ability to the human neutralizing antibodies m101 and m102.4. It was found that the binding of HeV G mutants D260A, G439A, K443A and K465A to both m101 and m102.4 was almost completely eliminated, while the binding activity of mutants G449A and D468A was significantly decreased. 73 These results suggest that the epitopes of the neutralizing antibodies overlap the RBD of HeV or NiV G proteins and that some discontinuous residues located in the RBD are critical for HeV or NiV binding to its receptors ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3. 74 Based on these findings, the design of an RBD-based henipavirus vaccine to prevent HeV or NiV infection is very feasible.",

Our recent studies have shown that vaccination of mice with the fusion protein HA1-Fdc, which consists of H5N1 HA1, a trimeric motif foldon and a human immunoglobulin G Fc fragment, resulted in induction of potent neutralizing antibody responses and complete cross-clade protection against H5N1 infection, 64 including elucidation of neutralizing mAbs whose epitopes were mapped to RBD (unpublished data). All these findings support the feasibility of developing RBDbased influenza vaccines. It is anticipated that these RBD-based influenza vaccines could be effective against divergent IAV strains, including those that may cause future influenza pandemics or epidemics.",
