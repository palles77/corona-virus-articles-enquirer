            "text": "The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to synthesize ds and ss probes for the detection of bovine coronavirus (BCV) using recombinant plasmids as template molecules. The ds probes detected a minimum of about 2 x 10' viral genomes after exposure for 1 h, a detection limit similar to nick-translated probes after exposure of the films for 60 h. More than 8 h exposure to blots probed with these ds probes resulted in complete darkening of the film. The ss probes, synthesized by asymmetric PCR on linearized plasmids, permitted the detection of 5 x 104 genomes, which equalled the capacity of random-primed probes. Prolonged exposure did not increase the background as in case of ds PCR-probed blots. Probes, synthesized by asymmetric PCR and random-priming were labeled to similar specific activities and were better in terms of sensitivity and detectability as opposed to nick-translated probes. However, the specificity of detection with ss probes as to random primed probes was increased further. About 10 viral genomes, after fragment-specific amplification by PCR, were detected by agarose-gel analysis. PCR-probe synthesis was simple, highly reproducible, and allowed the synthesis of probes for specific fragments.",

            "text": "Neonatal diarrhea in newborn calves is a syndrome of great etiological complexity. The major infectious organisms associated with the disease are coronaviruses, rotaviruses, and enterotoxigenic E. coli (Mebus et al., 1973; Bridger et al., 1978; Saif et al., 1986) , while several conditional factors play an influential role in disease development. Numerous tests for the detection of bovine coronavirus (BCV) have been established. These tests include hemagglutination (Van Balken et al., 1978/79; Sato et al., 1984) and serological methods (Barnett et al., 1975; Crouch et al., 1984; Reynolds et al., 1984; El Ghorr et al., 1988) . In the last few years molecular probing of BCV-RNA has been reported for detection either after isolation of the nucleic acid from purified virions (Shockley et al., 1987) or after direct spotting of the virus (Verbeek and Tijssen, 1988) . Detection by molecular probing of porcine (Shockley et al., 1987) and human coronaviruses (Myint et al., 1989) in clinical specimens has also been described. Direct detection of BCV in clinical specimens, however, requires several modifications such as the elimination of macromolecules, competing with the virus for binding sites on the nitrocellulose, and the amplification of detection signals (Verbeek et al., 1990) .",

Similar conditions were applicable for the asymmetric PCR, except for the addition of only the RNAcomplementary primer and an amount of 110 ng template DNA. Reaction mixtures were overlaid with paraffin oil and subjected to 15 amplification cycles in the Perkin-Elmer Cetus automated thermal cycler. The different steps of a cycle included a denaturation for 1 min at 94\u00b0C annealing for 1 min at 52\u00b0C and a Tuq-mediated primer extension for 3 min at 72\u00b0C. A final 10 min incubation at 72\u00b0C was included before purification of the PCR-probes by spin-column chromatography, using Sephadex G-50. The ds probes were heat-denatured and the complete reaction mixture was added to 2 ml hybridization solution, covering about 24 cm' nitrocellulose. The reaction mix of the purified ss probes was added to the prehyb~di~ation solution without previous heat denaturation. The specific activity was calculated for optimal PCR, considering the limiting amount of [o?'PJdCTP as the only dCTP precursors. A maximum of about 170 ng DNA could have been synthesized under optimal conditions, taking into account that only 1 in 3 dCTP molecules are radioactively labeled in the commercial preparation (3000 Ci/mmol). An estimated specific activity of 1.2 x lo9 cpm/pg was obtained, assuming a 60% scintillation counting efficiency. Comparison of the incorporation obtained with the theoretical maximum incorporation yielded a PCR \"P incorporation efficiency of about 10%.",

            "text": "Using a different approach, specificity, detectability and sensitivity were improved by applying PCR to synthesize ds and ss probes from cDNA regiofis in the ~cornb~~t plasmid only. The exposure times could be reduced for ds probes to about 1 to 8 h to obtain detection limits similar to those observed with tiick- Table 1 ). Exposure times of more than 8 h resulted in strong background signals, probably caused by binding of small, labeled molecules to membrane nitrate residues (Albretsen et al., 1988 ). These small molecules may have been synthesized by PCR as a result of insufficient dCTP precursors, or as primer-dimers. This background may be reduced by purification of the full-length ds probes by agarose-gel electrophoresis (Schowalter et al., 1989) or by increasing hybridization and washing stringencies. Hybridization of control pUC-DNA with ds probes, produced by PCR from cDNA in recombinant plasmids, resulted also in significant radioactivity signals (data not shown). This background was likely caused by vector-probe molecules, due to readthrough of the polymerase into vector sequences of the original template molecules during amplification. Synthesis of vector-probe molecules may probably be limited by optimization of the PCR or by using the isolated cDNA-inserts as templates for amplification. Detection with PCR-produced ss probes from linearized template molecules also improved test sensitivity and detectabili~ as compared to nick-translated probes (Figs. 1 and 3) . Particularly, specificity was improved as a result of reduced hybridization to pUC-DNA (data not shown). The at least 30-fold increase in sensitivity observed by Albretsen et al. (1988) using ss instead of ds probes (Albretsen et al., 1988) was, however, not confirmed.",

The open circles designate the hybridization positions of oligonucleotide probes, used in BCV detection. The restriction endonuclease SalI site in the polylinker of pUC-19, directly flanking the cDNA sequences, was used to linearize recombinant plasmid pN17 (Clone N17) for ss probe synthesis by incubation with the RNA complementary primers (*) only.",
