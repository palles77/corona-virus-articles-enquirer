The process uses broad-range polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify nucleic acid targets from large groupings of organisms, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry for accurate mass measurements of PCR products, and base composition signature analysis to identify organisms in a sample. We demonstrate this principle by using 14 isolates of 9 diverse Coronavirus spp., including the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). We show that this method could identify and distinguish between SARS and other known CoV, including the human CoV 229E and OC43, individually and in a mixture of all 3 human viruses. The sensitivity of detection, measured by using titered SARS-CoV spiked into human serum, was \u22481 PFU/mL. This approach, applicable to the surveillance of bacterial, viral, fungal, or protozoal pathogens, is capable of automated analysis of >900 PCR reactions per day.",

By amplifying gene targets conserved across groups of organisms, broadrange PCR has the potential to generate amplification products across entire genera, families, or, as with bacteria, an entire domain of life. This strategy has been successfully used with consensus 16S ribosomal RNA primers for determining bacterial diversity, both in environmental samples (5) and in natural human flora (6) . Broad-range priming has also been described for detection of several viral families, including CoV (7), enteroviruses (8) , retroid viruses (9) , and adenoviruses (10) . The drawback of this approach for epidemiologic applications is that the analysis of PCR products for mixed amplified samples requires sequencing hundreds of colonies per reaction, which is impractical to perform rapidly or on large numbers of samples. New approaches to the parallel detection of multiple infectious agents include multiplexed PCR methods (11, 12) and microarray strategies (13) (14) (15) . Microarray strategies are promising because undiscovered organisms might be detected by hybridization to probes designed to conserved regions of known families of bacteria and viruses.",

We use broad-range PCR to generate amplification products from the broadest possible grouping of organisms, followed by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and base composition analysis of the products (16, 17) . The base compositions of strategically selected regions of the genome are used to identify and distinguish organisms in the sample. Enhanced breadth of priming is achieved through the use of primers and probes containing 5-propynyl deoxycytidine and deoxyuridine nucleotides that offer increased affinity and base pairing selectivity (18, 19) . Positioning the 5-propynyl primidine-modified nucleotides at highly conserved positions enables priming at short consensus regions and significantly increases the extent to which broad groups of organisms can be amplified. Table 1 lists all the CoV used in this study. Multiple sequence alignments of all available CoV nucleotide sequences from GenBank were scanned to identify pairs of potential PCR priming loci. Two target regions were selected in CoV ORF-1b (annotations based on Snijder et al. [20] ), 1 in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and the other in Nsp14 (Table 2 ). 5\u2032 propynyl-modified pyrimidine nucleotides (shown in bold) were positioned at universally conserved positions within these primers to extend the breadth of broad-range priming to allow efficient PCR from all CoV species tested.",

All aspects of pulse sequence control and data acquisition were performed on a 1.1 GHz Pentium II data station running Bruker's Xmass software (Bruker Daltonics). Inputs to the signal processor are the raw mass spectra for each of the parallel PCR reactions used to analyze a single sample. The ICR-2LS software package (23) was used to deconvolute the mass spectra and calculate the mass of the monoisotopic species using an \"averagine\" fitting routine (24) modified for DNA (Drader et al., unpub. data). Using this approach, monoisotopic molecular weights were calculated. The spectral signals were algorithmically processed to yield base composition data as described previously (25) . The amplitudes of the spectra are calibrated to indicate the number of molecules detected in the mass spectrometer versus m/z and the m/z values are corrected by using internal mass standards. The algorithm computes the organism's identity and abundances consistent with observations over all the PCR reactions run on the input sample.",

In the first, RNA was isolated from serum containing 2 concentrations of the virus (1.7 x 10 5 and 170 PFU/mL), reverse transcribed to cDNA with random primers, and serially diluted (10-fold), before PCR amplification with both RdRp and Nsp14 primer sets. By using this approach, the assay was sensitive to \u224810 -2 PFU per PCR reaction (\u22481.7 PFU/mL serum). We estimated the number of reverse-transcribed SARS genomes by competitive, quantitative PCR with a nucleic acid internal standard (data not shown). Analysis of ratios of mass spectral peak heights of titrations of the internal standard and the SARS cDNA showed that \u2248300 reverse-transcribed viral genomes were present per PFU, similar to the ratio of viral genome copies per PFU previously reported for RNA viruses (26) . By using this estimate, PCR primers were sensitive to 3 genome equivalents per PCR reaction, which is consistent with previously reported detection limits for optimized SARS-specific primers (27, 28) . In the second method, we spiked 10-fold dilutions of the SARS virus into serum before RT-PCR and could reliably detect 1 PFU (\u2248300 genomes) per PCR reaction or 170 PFU (5.1 x 10 4 genomes) per mL serum. The discrepancy between the detection sensitivities in the 2 experimental protocols described above suggests that losses were associated with RNA extraction and reverse transcription when very little virus was present (<300 genome copies) in the starting sample in serum. This finding is consistent with results for direct measurement of RNA viruses from patient samples (26) . Therefore, in a practical experimental analysis of a tissue sample, the limit of sensitivity was \u22481 PFU per PCR reaction.",

A series of nested ovals represents subgroupings of species, where the maximal distance between known members of a subgroup is represented by the \u2206 m next to the oval. By using the above classification metric, SARS-CoV would be considered the first member of a new group of CoV, not a member of the core group 2 cluster, although it would be placed closest to group 2 (\u2206 m < 10.2). These findings are similar to those recently described by Snijder et al., who used sequence data from the replicase genes (5,487 bp) in ORF1b and suggested that the SARS-CoV was most closely related to and possibly an early split-off from group 2 CoV (20) . However, substantial space exists around SARS-CoV where as yet undiscovered SARS-CoV could populate a subgroup without being confused with the group 2 or other CoV.

Broad-range PCR reactions are capable of producing products from groups of organisms, rather than single species, and the information content of each PCR reaction is potentially very high. Further, in many cases, including the SARS-CoV detection described in this article, priming across broadly conserved regions provides adequate species detection and taxonomic resolution. In cases where additional subspecies level classification becomes important, broad primers can be followed up with more species-specific primers that can detect even single nucleotide changes (SNPs) or alternatively, larger regions of the identified species can be analyzed by sequencing. Despite the advances in high throughput sequencing, however, it is impractical as a front-end detector in a routine survey and detection setting. The mass spectrometer is capable of analyzing complex PCR products at a rate of \u22481 minute per sample. Because the process is performed in an automated, microtiter plate format, large numbers of samples can be examined (>900 PCR reactions/day/instrument), which makes this process practical for large-scale analysis of clinical or environmental surveillance samples in public health laboratory settings. The current generations of ESI mass spectrometers used in the detector cost approximately U.S.$150,000 and can be operated 24 hours per day by trained technicians. Tools for analyzing mass spectrometry data are widely available and are described in detail elsewhere (23) (24) (25) .
