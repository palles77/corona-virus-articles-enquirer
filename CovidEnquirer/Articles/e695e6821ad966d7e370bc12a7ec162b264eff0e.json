It is characterized by aggressive behavior, onset at young age, and early relapse. 3, 4 TNBC is insensitive to endocrine and HER2-targeted therapy, and therefore, chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment. Although some clinical trials found that TNBC is more sensitive to platinum-based chemotherapy, 5, 6 taxane/anthracycline-based regimens are still standard and preferred regimens for TNBC patients in the adjuvant setting. 7 3802 liao et al However, not all TNBC patients respond to chemotherapy, which suggests that TNBC is more than a single disease. 8 Identifying biomarkers to further subdivide TNBC patients with distinct outcome is of great importance.",

But till now, there is no research about polymorphisms in AURKA or AURKB and prognosis of TNBC patients.

AURKA gene is an oncogene located on chromosome 20q13. Polymorphisms in AURKA gene are associated with risk and intrinsic subtype of breast cancer. 20, 21 In the study by Ruan et al, 22 High AURKA expression was strongly associated with decreased survival of breast cancer (P = 0.0005), and it was an independent prognostic marker in the study by Nadler et al. 25 In TNBC patients with AURKA high expression, the risk of distant recurrence peaked at the first 3 years and declined rapidly thereafter, whereas patients with AURKA low expression showed a relatively constant risk of recurrence during the entire follow-up period. Univariate and multivariate analysis showed that overexpression of AURKA predicted poor OS (P = 0.002) and progression-free survival (P = 0.012) in TNBC. 26 AURKA had been reported to interact and phosphorylate several important proteins involved in stress response and cell cycle checkpoint after DNA damage. 27 Overexpression of AURKA led to diminished transcriptional activity and increased degradation of p53, causing checkpoint defects and genetic instability and ultimately facilitating cancer development and progression. 28 AURKB gene is located on chromosome 17p13. In German population, 29 synonymous AURKB rs2241909 (885A>G) polymorphism resulted in an increased familial breast cancer risk for carriers of the homozygous 885G genotype (OR = 1.45, 95% CI = 1.05-2.0, P = 0.02). There have been debating data regarding the role of the AURKB expression in cancer prognosis. Zhang et al 30 found that AURKB expression was correlated with the proliferation index (P < 0.001) and p53 expression (P = 0.014) in breast cancer tissues. Higher expression of AURKB is significantly correlated with the poor survival in these cases (P = 0.038).",

            "text": "All patients in our study received taxane-based adjuvant chemotherapy. Taxanes are microtubule targeting agents (MTAs), which are most widely used drugs in adjuvant setting for TNBC patients. The cytotoxic action of these compounds is mediated primarily through their binding of \u03b2-tubulin monomers, leading to microtubule stabilization, thus blocking their depolymerization and subsequently triggering cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase. 31 Considering the role of Aurora kinases in spindle formation and the reported extent of their deregulation in cancer, we hypothesize that polymorphisms in AURKA or AURKB might contribute to taxane resistance and then influence the survival of cancer patients. Zhang et al 30 demonstrated that in breast cancer patients who received neoadjuvant chemotherapy (containing sequential taxane and anthracycline-based regimens), elevated expression of AURKB contributed to chemoresistance (P = 0.011). In taxane-resistance breast cancer cell lines, expression of AURKA was significantly higher. Knockdown of AURKA not only markedly decreased the expression of P-gp but also downregulated the P-gp function in resistant breast cancer cells. The results indicated that AURKA plays a crucial role in paclitaxel-resistant breast cancer. 32 However, the underlying mechanisms of these SNPs on survival of TNBC are not yet clear and need to be further investigated. By silico analysis of prediction of binding motifs, Mesic et al 33 indicated that polymorphic sites in AURKA and AURKB could bind different transcription factors. As for AURKA rs8173, when the G allele was present, C/EBPalpha, C/EBPbeta, and NF-1 transcription factor binding motifs were recognized, whereas when the same region contained the C allele, additional E2F and RAR-\u03b2 transcription factor motifs were identified. In the case of AURKB rs2289590, when the A allele was present, PEA3 and TFII-I binding motifs were recognized. In contrast, when the C allele is present, PEA3, TFII-I, and YY1 binding motifs were identified. Since YY1 expression level and/or activity is associated with unchecked cell proliferation, resistance to apoptosis, metastasis, and tumor cell resistance to chemo-therapeutics, 34 the binding of an additional YY1 protein in the presence of C allele may alter the level of AURKB expression and then influence the survival, which might be a possible explanation for our result that AURKB rs2289590 A allele was significantly associated with better DFS.",
