Early warning of such communicable diseases before the onset of symptoms can potentially improve both patient care and public health responses. An example of such an early warning system is the PRESAGED (Presymptomatic Agent Exposure Detection) system [1] which uses host-based physiological signals to detect an individual's exposure to pathogens, such as viruses and bacteria, before overt symptoms emerge and infectiousness is peak. In animal models, the PRESAGED algorithm has been shown to provide two to three days of early warning before the onset of incipient symptoms (e.g., fever), independent of the particular pathogen, exposure route, pathogen dose, or animal species [1] . These results are consistent with findings of Speranza et al. that show presymptomatic upregulation in biomarkers potentially linked to pathogen exposure around the same time in non-human primates exposed to Ebola [2] . Numerous efforts have evaluated epidemiological models to characterize the disease transmission dynamics and the effectiveness of public health interventions of past outbreaks [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] , including effort by Chowell et al [14] that examines the impact of a hypothetical early diagnostic capability (based on advancements in bioassay tests) for containing the spread of Ebola. We posit that a comprehensive simulation capability is essential for assessing the potential impact of a host-based early warning system.",

For each policy-dependent model, we simulated outbreak scenarios and calculated the size of the outbreak (total number of infections) and the operational burden (total number of lost duty days resulting from quarantine or isolation). These metrics were used to understand the trade space for the different policies.

This approach splits a given population into separate compartments defined by their relationship to a disease outbreak [15] : scenarios can be simulated by changing the rate parameters of the ODEs linking the population compartments. Furthermore, this approach allows quantitative projections of how many people are exposed to a pathogen and become sick under different outbreak conditions. While the SEIR model is mathematically rigorous and often has good predictive utility during an outbreak, the SEIR model requires several assumptions. First, the model assumes there is a fixed population N, with no births or deaths other than those resulting from the infectious disease. Second, it assumes the population is homogeneously mixing, that is the transmission between any two individuals is equally likely. Third, the model assumes that exposed individuals become infectious after a fixed incubation period, thus not accounting for individual variability of disease progression for the young, elderly, or immunocompromised. Finally, the model assumes that all recovered individuals are immune to further infection and thus do not re-enter the susceptible class. While any of these assumptions may fail to hold in particular contexts, abiding by them allows for greater mathematical tractability and offers similar relative output trends.",

In a fixed population represented in the SEIR model, the reproduction number can be calculated from parameters in the model as \u211b 2 = 0 . The solutions of the SEIR model are functions of the number of individuals in each compartment with respect to time, i.e., # , # , # , and # . We solve this numerically by using an ODE solver in MATLAB\u00ae. An example output of the full SEIR model is shown in Figure 2a . Here, we begin with a population of N = 1000 people (roughly equivalent to a large battalion), and consider a scenario where 300 individuals are exposed to some pathogen at time, = 0 ( #42 = 700, #42 = 300, #42 = #42 = 0). If we assume a particular infectious pathogen has a contact rate, = 0.75, with an incubation period of two days, = 0.5, and an infectious period of five days, = 0.2 (similar properties to a highly contagious flu virus), the solution to the SEIR model shows that nearly the entire population will contract the disease over the course of a month. Figure 2b focuses on the number of cumulative infections, a metric for assessing the overall size of the outbreak over time.

To quantitatively evaluate an outbreak scenario with additional measures, the parameters and compartments of the SEIR model can be modified to reflect policy choices or new early warning technologies. Two policies currently considered as standards in handling possible outbreaks rely on self-monitoring to implement voluntary isolation or quarantining all individuals that may have been exposed to a pathogen. Isolation applies to individuals who are already ill, whereas quarantine applies to individuals who may have been exposed but have not yet shown symptoms. The first policy, self-monitoring and reporting, which assumes individuals self-report when they develop symptoms, allows for additional infections during the time delay between the onset of symptoms and isolation; however, it does not account for the logistical and financial cost of quarantine. The second policy, quarantining the entire population, is effective in reducing additional transmissions but has a prohibitively onerous costs for large populations. In an effort to explore the impact of a host-based early warning system, we modified the SEIR model to simulate a third policy, quarantine-on-alert, in which individuals are only quarantined when prompted by a host-based early warning system. We hypothesized that the early notification of incipient illness will allow for reductions in pathogen transmission while minimizing the number of quarantined individuals. We then assessed each of these three new policy-dependent SEIR models.",

As shown in Figure 6 , the quarantine-all policy eliminates opportunities for further pathogen transmission; however, it also results in the quarantine of healthy individuals who have not been exposed, contributing to immense productivity losses, extreme logistic burdens associated with providing accommodations for an entire population, and acute civil rights concerns. Furthermore, the assumption that transmission is zero within the Q compartment may not be realistic because transmission for some pathogen may occur before overt symptoms and isolation. This quarantine-all policy could result in the illness of people who, if not for the quarantine, would never have been exposed to the pathogen. In the numeric solution for our SEIR Model with a quarantine-all policy enacted, the population of each compartment versus time, which notably does not include an exposed compartment, is shown in (a). In (a) are individuals suspected to be exposed and quarantined initially, until they either fall ill (and are isolated) or are released after the quarantine duration (21 days).

We integrated the early warning performance metrics from our PRESAGED algorithm-populationwide probability of early detection, daily false-alarm rate, and early detection time-into a base SEIR model. As shown in Figure 7 , a host-based early warning system would trigger exposed individuals to transition into quarantine at a rate characterized by the product of the parameters \u03bb and PD. The parameter \u03bb is an early detection rate defined as the inverse of the system's average early detection time for a given pathogen. The parameter PD is the population-wide probability of early detection, i.e., the fraction of the exposed population that will present early detections of pathogen exposure prior to becoming infectious. Missed detection cases, when the system fails to produce an early warning, occur with a probability of 1 -PD across the exposed population. For this policy, false alarms of the host-based early warning system would cause healthy individuals to be incorrectly quarantined. Our model takes this notion into account by adding a transition rate from the susceptible to the quarantined compartment, characterized by a daily false-alarm rate \u03ba, the probability of an individual's early warning system presenting a false alarm on a given day. . The quarantine-on-alert policy has effectively reduced the additional disease cases and has largely limited those in quarantine to those individuals who were initially exposed.",

We varied these parameters in simulations of a mass exposure to an infectious pathogen occurring in a population of 1,000 people. All scenarios were simulated over 50 days. Because we fixed the exposure time for all cases to t = 0, rather than using the quarantine release rate \u03b5, all individuals in quarantine were returned to the susceptible compartment at t = 21 days (the maximum incubation period). We defined policy outcomes via two metrics derived from the policy-dependent SEIR model outputs as shown in Figure 9 . The first, lost duty days, is the percentage of total number of days of work productivity that are lost because of quarantine and isolation in the 50-day simulation; this percentage is proportional to the integral of the curves in Figure 9a . The second metric, cumulative infections, is the percentage of the population that has been infected by the end of the simulation (Figure 9b ). These two metrics characterize a trade space for evaluating QIT policies under different circumstances, as any measure that reduces the number of people in quarantine and isolation may be expected to increase the likelihood of infection in the population. While these metrics are helpful for evaluating the impact of various policy choices, they are by no means comprehensive and particularly do not consider the financial or other costs associated with quarantine.

Because a high initial exposure greatly increased the likelihood of infectious individuals transmitting the pathogen to those susceptible, even a short delay in isolating infectious individuals lead to more infections. The reduction of cumulative infections for all notional early warning systems, relative to the self-monitoring policy, was less prominent than in scenarios of low initial exposure as the initial exposed population was close to saturation. In effect, for these extreme cases of mass exposures, the more aggressive policies (i.e., a high-sensitivity early detection system or quarantining everyone) may be more effective.",

However, this illustration of QIT risk analysis captures only a subset of the factors that must be considered in the formulation of a rational, effective QIT policy. The context of the scenario will ultimately inform where the ideal operating point would be. For example, the number of total infections may be interpreted differently depending upon the virulence of the disease. The tolerance for new infections may be low if the consequences are high, such as if the infection is almost always fatal or is associated with severe symptoms and long-term complications. Additionally, the availability of diagnostic tests may further refine the use of early warning capabilities; a more sensitive early detection capability could be combined with a cued use of diagnostic testing to form a much more targeted approach, reducing costs and the likelihood of a false detection. While the results we presented are a first attempt at understanding the potential utility of a host-based early warning system during an outbreak, a comprehensive risk assessment of a QIT policy must consider a range of factors:",

For instance, antiviral drugs (such as zanamivir and oseltamivir/Tamiflu) are most effective in the first ~48 hours of symptoms [8, 17, 18] ; PRESAGED-enabled early warning would allow much faster prescription, use, and potentially more profound therapeutic impact for current dosage recommendations. Triggering the use of diagnostics early would allow clinicians to target drugbased interventions, such as using the precise antibiotic for bacterial infections rather than relying on broad-spectrum versions that contribute to the evolution of drug-resistant bacteria (\"superbugs\"). Finally, simple supportive care for mild infections, e.g., having rehydrating solutions or over-the-counter symptom-relieving medications available, could ease the burden on health care workers in hospitals, nursing homes, or college campuses. All of these exciting possibilities could be enabled or improved with earlier detection. All rights reserved.
