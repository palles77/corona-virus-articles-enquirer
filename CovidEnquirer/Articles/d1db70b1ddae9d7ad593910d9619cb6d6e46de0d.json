When compared with glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde, 0.1% paraformaldehyde was found to be the fixative of choice for the detection of these determinants on the membranes of infected cells. Among dehydrating fixatives, 80% acetone or a mixture of acetone and ethanol or of acetone, methanol and ethanol were found to be the best fixatives for the detection of these viral determinants wh;ch are expressed in infected cells. In the case of acetone, the temperature of fixation and its concentration in the fixative preparation were found to be important. The treatment of 0.05% glutaraldehyde-fixed, infected cells with 0.1% saponin or 0.1% paraformaldehyde-fixed, infected cells with l%NP-40 led to satisfactory detection of viral determinants. Using Triton X-100 to render cells permeable, the quanqties of N and M antigen detected in TGEV-infected cells prefixed with either 0.05% glutaraldehyde or 0.1% paraformaldehyde were equal to those of 80% acetone-fixed, TGEV-infected cells while the quantity of S antigen detected was diminished. The effect of other detergents such as zwittergent, emoigen BB, Chaps and N-lauroylsarcosine on the detection of viral determinants was also studied.",

Fixation with FA at different concentrations led to irregular patterns for antibody binding to M and S determinants (Fig. la) . FA at high concentrations caused a decrease of antibody binding to S determinant but an increase of the M determinant up to 175% of controls at a FA concentration of 0.5%. The levels of antibody binding to M and S determinants were very low using fixation with GA at different concentrations (Fig. lb) . and $ (51-13) determinants were expressed as percentages compared with the value obtained with 0.1% paraformaldehyde-fixed, TGEV-infected cells. The degree of antibody binding to the N (22-6) determinant was expressed as a percentage compared with that obtained with 80% acetone-fixed, TGEV-infected cells.",

The increase in acetone concentration parallelled the increase of detectable N antigen.

Similarly, comparisons of cell treatment with permeabilizing agents (Figs. 4, 5 and 6) lead to the conclusion that the TGEV antigens were readily detected in PFA-fixed cells which were then permeated with 1% NP-40 and in GA-fixed cells which were then permeated with 0.1% saponin.",

The author also found that where a MAb specific for virus NP was used in liT, staining was only seen following FA fixation but this was not the case for MAb specific for RSV envelope glycoproteins. The latter generally gave good results with either fixative. Similarly, FA fixation seemed to preserve Borna virus-specific antigens better than acetone/methanol or acetone fixation and the labelling was pronounced when using MAb (Pauli et al., 1984) .

However, both surface and cytoplasmic antigens were detected after acetone fixation. This is due to the fact that after PFA fixation me cell membrane was still intact but became permeable after acetone fixation. Thus MAbs also bind to cytoplasmic viral antigens (T6 et al, 1991) . It seems that acetone fixation at -20\u00b0(: had no effect on the accessibility of the N determinant to the MAb. The same results (data not shown) were also obtained in TGEV-infected cells which were fixed with either act/meth or act/meth/eth using two different fixation procedures. It would seem that the stronger the permeabilizing capacity of the fixative, the more N antigen but less M and S antigens were detected. Consequently, the interpretation of results comparing aldehyde and dehydrating fixatives should take this observation into consideration.",
