The remainder of each mRNA is derived from a protein-coding exon that is not linked to the mini-exon. We propose that medRNA is spliced in trans to de-novo-initiated transcripts of protein-coding genes. This frans splicing model predicts that the downstream portion of medRNA will be part of a branched structure and then be released as a free product (minRNA). We demonstrate that significant levels of minRNA exist in trypanosome RNA. Furthermore, minRNA can be released from high molecular weight RNA by a HeLa cell SlOO \"debranching'lextract. Wa conclude that frans splicing is the physiological process by which mature mRNA molecules are synthesized in trypanosomes.",

The 5'-most 35 nucleotides of medRNA, corresponding to the mini-exon sequence itself, are immediately followed by a consensus 5' splice signal (GUAUGA) . Similarly, immediately upstream of all proteincoding exons examined (Bernards et al., 1984; Boothroyd and Cross, 1982; Clayton, 1985; Gonzalez et al., 1985; Kimmel et al., 1985; Liu et al., 1983; Michels et al., 1986; Pays et ai., 1982; Sather and Agabian, 1985; Swinkels et al., 1986; Tschudi et al., 1985; Van der Ploeg et al., 1982) , there is a consensus 3' splice site ([C/U],NNAG). Together with the fact that the mini-exon repeats and at least some structural genes are on different chromosomes (Van der Ploeg et ai., 1984 : Guyaux et al., 1985 , these ObseNalions have led to the suggestion that mRNAs in trypanosomes are generated by a novel process termed \"discontinuous transcription\" to reflect the fact that a chimeric RNA is generated by transcription of two unlinked loci (reviewed in Boothroyd, 1985; Borst, 1986) .",

In the transcription-reinitiation model, medRNA is synthesized first and then used as a primer for reinitiation of transcription upstream of the structural gene. In the second model, the two RNA molecules are independently transcribed and then ligated end-to-end. In both of these models, a contiguous precursor RNA is thus formed that, as described above, would have consensus splice-site signals at the exon-intron boundaries. Both of these models predict, therefore, that a conventional intramolecular splicing event is responsible for processing of the precursor RNAs into a mature mRNA. A third model proposes that the two RNA molecules are transcribed separately, but that the two exons are then combined by an i~termQ~ecu~ar splice (i.e., in tfans).",

Here, we demonstrate that precisely such a molecule exists in substa.ntiai amounts in the trypanosome.

            "text": "Using a synthetic oligonucleotide probe, we previously reported the detection of a unique 137 nucleotide transcript from the mini-exon repeat, the first 35 nucleotides of which correspond to the mini-exon sequence itself (Campbell et al., 1984) . In subsequent analysis using hybridization probes with substantially higher specific activity, we consistently observed an additional, minor product of approximately 100 nucleotides (data not shown). The RNA used in these latter experiments was prepared from purified trypanosomes by a procedure involving many manipulations, and thus was subject to possible artifacts. We therefore chose to repeat these experiments using RNA prepared by the most rapid method possible. To do this, infected rats with high parasitemia were exsanguinated, and the RNA was rapidly extracted with hot phenol The boxed region of pMES.1 represents the 1.35 kb SauBA-Sau3A mini-exon repeat, which has been completely sequenced (Campbell et al., 1984) . The filled-in portion of the insert corresponds to the 35 bp mini-exon, and position +I is the start site of transcription in vivo. The hatched portion represents nucleotides +36 to +137 of medRNA, which we have termed the mini-intron (see text). The sequence of the mini-exon repeat spanning the splice junction is shown; the arrow indicates the position of the 5'splice site. The positions of relevant restriction sites are also shown. Refer to Experimental Procedures for description of the construction of the probes. A 5'-32P-labeled end is indicated by an \"x': and a 3'-32P-labeled end is indicated by an '0\". as described in Experimental Procedures. Forty micrograms of this RNA was fractionated on a denaturing polyacrylamide gel, transferred to Genetrans paper, and probed with an antisense RNA probe corresponding to the sequence from +58 through +183 relative to the start site of transcription of medRNA (see Figure 1 ). The resulting autoradiogram ( Figure 2 ) reveals two bands: one species of 137 nucleotides (medRNA, as previously reported) and one species of about 100 nucleotides, present at about 12% of the medRNA level (as determined by densitometric analysis of the autoradiogram shown). The hybridization at the very top of the gel is probably nonspecific since it is also observed when total yeast RNA is electrophoresed and similarly probed (data not shown). With such probes, the smaller species was consistently detected in this RNA preparation, in total RNA extracted by guanidine isothiocyanate or guanidine-HCI, and in nuclear RNA (data not shown). The size of this smaller RNA species is approximately that predicted for a by-product of trans splicing (see above). We chose, therefore, to determine if it had the exact termini predicted by such a model.",

To do this, total RNA was fractionated on a polyacrylamide gel, which was then sliced, and the RNA from individual slices was electroeluted. The eluant of each fraction was coprecipitated with the same 5' - Total trypanosome RNA (100 ug) was denatured in formamide and then fractionated on a 5% polyacrylamide-7 M urea gel. The gel was cut into 14 pieces (13 of 1.0 cm and the fourteenth of 0.5 cm), and the RNA was electroeluted as described in Experimental Procedures. Sl nuclease protection using the 5'-end-labeled probe corresponding to nucleotides +18 to +I10 (see Figure 1 ) was performed as outlined in Experimental Procedures. The resulting DNA was denatured and then electrophoresed on an 8% polyacrylamide-7 M urea sequencing gel. An autoradiogram of radiolabeled markers (pAT153 cut with Mspl) run in parallel with the fractionated RNA is shown above the lanes; markings indicate the limits of each gel slice. The numbering of the lanes (l-14) refers to the gel slices, beginning at the top of the gel. In lane C, only 100 frg of yeast tRNA carrier was included in the hybridization reaction. Lane M contains DNA size markers (Mspl fragments of pAT153), whose lengths are indicated at right. end-labeled probe used in the experiment described in Figure 3 , and standard Sl nuclease protection reactions were performed (Figure 4) . The major protection of fulllength probe observed in fractions 6 and 7 in Figure 4 represents hybridization of the probe to medRNA. Background protection of full-length probe in other fractions probably represents back-hybridization between the two strands of the input probe. The only fraction to show protected species of less than full length is fraction 8, which comprises RNA molecules of 90-110 nucleotides ( Figure  4 ). This fraction showed three protected species in the size range 74-78 nucleotides. This is the same pattern of bands observed in Sl nuclease protection experiments on total RNA described above, and thus confirms that an RNA molecule of about 100 nucleotides is responsible for the protection at position +36 noted in total RNA. When primer extension experiments were performed using sizefractionated RNA and the Y-end-labeled primer described in Figure 1 , a product extended to position +36 was found in only those fractions corresponding to the lOO-mer, whereas the full-length extension product (to position +l) was present only in fractions containing medRNA (data not shown).",

            "text": "The most likely interpretation of these results is that a bond, similar to the 5' -2' branch produced in cis splicing (Ruskin et al., 1984; Padgett et al., 1984) links the minRNA to the high molecular weight RNA and that the HeLa cell extract is specifically cleaving at this site, resulting in the release of the minF?NA. The only plausible alternative to this explanation is that the extract is specifically recognizing the 5' splice site of medRNA and cleaving it to release the minRNA. Although medRNA does contaminate the high molecular weight fractions, there is no correlation between its amount and that of the minRNA generated by treatment with the extract. For example, as shown in Figure 6C , the amount of medRNA in pooled fractions 13-18 is about five times that in fractions 1-6. Yet, as seen in Figure 6B , the opposite applies to minRNA: the amount in pooled fractions 13-18 is substantially less than that in pooled fractions l-6. Figure 6B further demonstrates that the HeLa cell extract can release minRNA from poly(A)+ RNA that lacks medRNA. We therefore discount the possibility that the HeLa ceil extract is cleaving medRNA, and conclude that the minRNA is associated with high molecular weight RNA as part of a branched structure. This branching is most likely a resuit of a 5' 2' phosphodiester bond between the guanosine at the Yend of minRNA(position +36; see Figure 1 ) and some nucleotide (adenosine, by analogy to cis splicing) within the intron portion of a precursor RNA. A more detailed model for this is presented and discussed below.",

This model proposes that the first step in Vans splicing is cleavage at the 5' splice site of medRNA coupled to branch formation at a site upstream of the 3' splice site in the acceptor RNA (aRNA). The mini-exon sequence is then linked to the protein-coding exon of the aRNA to yield a mature mRNA and a branched structure composed of the two introns. The final step is the debranching of the two introns, resulting in three products: a mature mRNA including the Y-most 35 nucleotides of medRNA, a segment of unknown length corresponding to the intronic sequences upstream of the protein-coding exon, and a mini-intron comprising the 3' -most 102 nucleotides of medRNA.

Second, \"conventional\" introns (i.e., those immediately flanked by adjacent exons) have not yet been observed in any trypanosome gene so far examined nor, to our knowledge, in any gene from an equally primitive eukaryote.

Based on the above, the simplest interpretation would be that cis splicing evolved from trans splicing at some point after the kinetoplastids split away from the main line of the eukaryotic evolutionary tree. This would be in conflict with recent suggestions that cis splicing of the sort discussed here existed in bacteria, but disappeared in these and other fast-growing organisms (introns are very rare in yeast) because of selection against such energetically expensive pathways (discussed in Gilbert et al., 1986; Sharp, 1985) . An alternative explanation for the apparent absence of cis splicing in trypanosomes might be that cis splicing cannot coexist with trans splicing because of the molecular chaos that would resuit if independent protein-encoding exons were randomly spliced together in trans without regard to their coding potential. Obviously, one way around this latter problem would be for the trans splicing machinery to recognize only the mini-exon and the most upstream exon of an aRNA as substrates. Such a constraint could explain the strong conservation of the mini-exon sequence in the different genera of the Kinetoplastida, although the presence of the same consensus sequence directly at the 5' splice sites of medRNA and the cis splicing substrates of higher organisms does not suggest any obvious specificity.",
