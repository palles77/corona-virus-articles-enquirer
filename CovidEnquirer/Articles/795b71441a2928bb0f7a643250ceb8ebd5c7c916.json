This is because of the proclamation of the prophet's father, Ibrahaam, when he called all mankind to perform Hajj. That is why all Muslims on Earth feel that they have to visit Mecca and Kaaba on a specific date and time, and that is the reason this small location hosts one of the largest human gatherings in the world. Hajj is one of the five pillars of Islam that every financially and physically able Muslim must perform once in his/her lifetime. For 14 centuries countless millions of Muslim men and women from the four corners of the earth have undertaken pilgrimage to Mecca.",

C. Climate Mecca features an extremely arid climate. Unlike other Saudi Arabian cities, Mecca retains its warm temperature in winter, which can range from 18 C (64 F) at night to 30 C (86 F) in the afternoon. Summer temperatures are very hot and break the 40 C (104 F) mark in the afternoon dropping to 30 C (86 F) in the evening. Rainfall in Mecca is infrequent and falls between November and January. Mecca in summer time are very hot and Heatstroke cases frequent during the pilgrimage to Mecca, for example August 1985, 2000 cases of heatstroke were reported and more than 1000 of these individuals died within a few days. 3 Other medical facilities during the Hajj season include a huge number of mobile and temporary clinics that are set up in and around the sites of Mina, Muzdallifah and Arafat. The vast majority of these however will be located near the Jamaraat. They are often poorly signposted. However the clue is wherever there is a mass of stationary ambulances there is likely to be a mobile clinic. 4 The Ministry of Health of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia seeks to serve the pilgrims, and it strives to provide all health services that help the pilgrims and non-pilgrims to perform the rituals of Hajj with ease and convenience. Based on its faith in the importance of utilizing technology to facilitate and accelerate the work of health institutions spreading in the Kingdom in general, and those located in the areas performing Hajj in particular, the Ministry of Health takes pride, in calling all related Health agency and related sectors, (Civil defense, Police, traffic agency, communications agency and media) to participate in this human Mass gathering and potential disaster. 5 ",
