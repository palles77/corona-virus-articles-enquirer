Their long, skinny shape allows ferrets to follow prey down into burrows and flush them out so they may be captured with nets or snares. Ferrets are popular indoor pets in the United States. Most American ferrets come from large ferret farms or ranches where they are neutered and de-scented at an early age. Despite their domesticity and popularity, ferrets are poorly understood. There are many state, county, or city laws that describe them as ''wild,'' ''non-domestic,'' or ''dangerous'' animals [2] .",
