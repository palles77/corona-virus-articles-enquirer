Test showed that 3 literatures have certain heterogeneity(Chi2=5.26,P=0.07, I2=62%), so the random effect model was adopted; The individual OR effect showed differently, but combined OR effect was 3.53 (95%CI, 1.95-6.38), indicating the incidence of severe risk of the patients with polypnea/dyspnea was 3.53 times higher than those none.

One possible explanation was that in previous reports, the sample size of patients was relatively small or it came from the early epidemic phase of NCP.NCP patients had the different clinical classification of disease severity. Non-severe NCP was with fever, respiratory tract symptoms, and image findings of pneumonia.Severe NCP met diagnostic criteria[26]. This review found preliminary evidence from three literatures that fever, polypnea/dyspnea and diarrhea are statistically significant diagnostic indicators for severe NCP patients and Polypnea/dyspnea was most predictable.Clinician had to arouse great attention on diagnostic value of them in future.In the early stages of NCP nonspecific signs and symptoms may be clinicallyindistinguishable from other common infectious diseases, especially winter respiratory virus. These characteristics of NCP had some similarities with SARS-CoVand MERS-CoVinfections[27.28]. However, patients with COVID-19 rarely had obvious signs and symptoms of upper respiratory tract (nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, runny nose, sore throat). In addition, intestinal signs and symptoms such as diarrhea were rare in NCP patients, while about 20-25% of patients with MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV infection had diarrhea. It should be noted that fever of NCP(10.8%) patients was more common than SARS-CoV (1%) and MERS-CoV(2%)[29].",
