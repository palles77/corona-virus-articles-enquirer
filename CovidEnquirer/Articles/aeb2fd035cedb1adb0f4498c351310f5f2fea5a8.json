            "text": "For many enveloped viruses, binding to a receptor(s) on a host cell acts as a first step in a series of events culminating in fusion with the host cell membrane and transfer of genetic material for replication [for review see 1,2 ]. The envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer on the surface of HIV is responsible for receptor binding and fusion. While Env can tolerate a high degree of mutation in five variable regions (V1-V5), and also at N-linked glycosylation sites that contribute roughly half the mass of Env, the functional sites for recognition of receptor CD4 and co-receptor CXCR4/ CCR5 are conserved and essential for viral fitness.

Thus, they are attractive immunogens for vaccine development [for review see [5] [6] [7] [8] ]. Here we present high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) structures of subtype B B41 SOSIP Env trimers in complex with CD4 and antibody 17b, or with antibody b12, at resolutions of ~3.7 \u00c5 and ~3.6 \u00c5, respectively, and compare them to cryoEM reconstructions of ligand-free B41 SOSIP Env trimers or in complex with either CD4 or CD4bs antibody PGV04, at ~5.6 \u00c5, ~5.2 \u00c5 and ~7.4 \u00c5, respectively. Consequently, we present the most complete description and understanding of the CD4/17b-induced intermediate and provide the molecular basis of the receptor-binding induced conformational change required for HIV-1 entry into host cells. Both CD4 and b12 induce large, previously uncharacterized conformational rearrangements in the gp41 subunits, and the fusion peptide becomes more buried in a newly formed pocket. These structures provide key details on the biological function of the type I viral fusion machine from HIV-1 as well as new templates for inhibitor design.",

To study the molecular basis of conformational changes resulting from binding of receptor to HIV-1 Env, we obtained a cryoEM map of fully glycosylated B41 SOSIP.664 14 (a solubilized and stabilized version of Env) in complex with two-domain soluble CD4 (sCD4) and the CD4-induced antibody 17b at ~3.7 \u00c5 resolution (B41 CD4/17b ) ( Fig. 1a ; Extended Data Fig. 1 ; Extended Data Table 1 ). We also obtained a ~5.6 \u00c5 cryoEM map of ligand-free subtype B B41 SOSIP.664 (B41 LF ) and show it to be structurally comparable to subtype A BG505 (Extended Data Fig. 2c-f ). Like BG505 SOSIP.664, B41 SOSIP.664 is a stable, native-like trimer that induced autologous neutralizing antibody responses in rabbit immunization studies 15 but can adopt slightly more open conformations (partially open) when analyzed by negative-stain EM, and has a lower melting temperature compared to BG505 14, 16 (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b) . Despite differences in their biophysical properties, the structure of B41 LF (Extended Data Fig. 2f ) adopts a closed, pre-fusion conformation nearly identical to the analogous BG505 SOSIP.664 structure (PDB 4ZMJ) 17 .",

In our B41 CD4/17b cryoEM map that contains the complete gp120, most of V1/V2 that extends parallel to CD4 is disordered in the region that was truncated in the core gp120 construct used for crystallography (residues C131 to N187) (Extended Data Fig. 3b ).

These changes propagate across gp120 to the C1 region (residues 63-72; \u03b10), which is poorly ordered in pre-fusion Env trimer structures ( Fig. 1b; Fig. 2c ). \u03b10 adopts a stable alpha-helical conformation via transit into a pocket that was sterically occluded by the close juxtaposition of gp120 and HR1 in gp41 in the closed, pre-fusion trimer (Extended Data Fig 3d; SI Video 3). An additional rearrangement of two mannose residues in the D1 arm of the highly conserved N262 glycan into a new pocket underneath the base of V3 further stabilizes the helical conformation of \u03b10 and establishes a direct link between the co-receptor binding site and gp41 ( Fig. 2c; Extended Data Fig. 4c ). Due to the rotation of gp120, \u03b10 now caps the HR1 helix (\u03b17) of the gp41 subunit from a neighboring protomer, which was previously capped by \u03b11 in gp120 from within a protomer (Fig. 2b) . The functional role of \u03b10 that we describe here supports a different conclusion than one based on a recently published lowresolution structure of CD4 bound to an Env trimer in a closed conformation claiming that CD4 makes specific contacts with C1 in the adjacent protomer 21 . In our structure, all of the highly conserved residues claimed to interact with CD4 during its initial pose form intra-gp120 stabilizing interactions in the open CD4-bound structure presented here (Fig. 3d) . Mutation of these residues lead to a loss of infectivity 21 ; in light of the present work, likely due to destabilization of the conformation competent for co-receptor binding.",

            "text": "Additional cryoEM reconstructions were produced to test the effect of sCD4 alone on Env conformational changes, and compare a with a different Env genotype, BG505 (Extended Data Fig. 1d ). Within the limits of resolution we observed only slight differences, whether B41 or BG505 SOSIP was used, and whether 17b is present or not (Extended Data Fig. 3c , Extended Data Fig. 4d ). The V3 loop remains unresolved in reconstructions of B41 or BG505 SOSIP in complex with sCD4, suggesting that sCD4 alone is responsible for the gp120 rearrangements and exposure of the co-receptor site, and suggesting that 17b does not induce further conformational changes (Extended Data Fig. 4f ). VRC01-class antibodies 22 bind the CD4bs but do not induce global conformational changes in the Env trimer while another CD4bs neutralizing antibody, b12, has been shown to engage Env in a different manner 9, 14, 23 . To better understand the conformational changes induced by b12, we generated cryoEM structures of B41 SOSIP.664 in complex with either CD4bs antibody PGV04 (B41 PGV04 ) or b12 (B41 b12 ) to resolutions of ~7.4 \u00c5 and ~3.6 \u00c5, respectively ( Fig. 4a ; Extended Data Fig. 1 ; Extended Data Fig. 5a , c). While B41 PGV04 was nearly identical to BG505 SOSIP.664 in complex with VRC01-like antibodies, B41 b12 promoted a large-scale change in Env away from the closed pre-fusion conformation similar to B41 CD4/17b (Extended Data Fig. 5b, d, e) . Specifically, B41 b12 exhibits a large rigid body movement of all three gp120 subunits with respect to the trimer axis and concomitant rearrangement of the gp41 helices (discussed below) ( Fig. 4c ; Extended Data Fig. 5d ). Despite the gp120 rearrangements, the V3 loop remains sequestered beneath V1/V2 and the co-receptor binding site is inaccessible ( Fig. 4b ; Extended Data Fig. 6b ). Thus, while b12 makes similar interactions with Env as CD4 it does not induce a conformational change in V1/V2 relative to gp120 ( Fig. 4b ; Extended Data Fig. 4e) . Notably, the subtle rearrangement of mannose residues in the N262 glycan observed in B41 CD4/17b is not seen in B41 b12 , and density for the \u03b10 region is highly disordered. Thus, functional progression of the Env requires both a rigid body movement of gp120 and CD4-induced allosteric changes within gp120 to expose the co-receptor binding site. Unlike CD4, b12 is sterically occluded from binding the closed pre-fusion conformation of Env (Extended Data Fig. 4b ; Extended Data Fig. 6c-f ), suggesting that transient opening of the trimer is required for b12 epitope exposure. Upon binding, b12 prevents reversion back to the closed pre-fusion state (Extended Data Fig. 6d ).",

FP, which is fully resolved to the N-terminal residue A512 in B41 b12 and L515 B41 CD4/17b , undergoes a large conformational rearrangement upon entry into this pocket , and is stabilized by many newly formed interactions. For example, K574, which forms a salt bridge with D107 of gp120 in the closed pre-fusion state, undoes this interaction upon translocation of \u03b11 induced by CD4/17bbinding, but forms a cation-\u03c0 interaction with gp120 F53 ( Fig. 3b ; Extended Data Fig. 7a ). All three residues (F53, D107, K574) are >99% conserved and the interplay between them likely contributes to two stable states (Extended Data Table 2 ). In fact, mutational analysis demonstrates that introduction of an F53A mutation not only decreases infectivity but also leads to greater gp120 shedding 18, 24 . The gp120 interface with gp41 \u03b17 in B41 CD4/17b is further stabilized by highly conserved residues that do not make any productive interactions in the pre-fusion state (Fig. 3b) . Finally, despite the larger conformational change, conserved phenylalanine residues in the FP and FPPR provide additional stabilizing interactions (Fig.  3e ). In addition to formation of new contacts, the intermediate state exemplified by B41 CD4/17b also retains some stabilizing features of the closed pre-fusion state ( Fig. 3c ; Extended Data Fig. 7f ). Altogether, this extensive network of interactions between highly conserved residues suggests that the CD4/17b-bound state represents a stable, fusion intermediate wherein the fusion peptide is embedded inside the trimer distant from the host membrane and therefore requiring further triggering by co-receptor engagement.",

Our studies describe Env, even when stabilized by SOSIP mutations, as a dynamic molecule that fluctuates between closed and open pre-fusion states. In the open conformation, we now see that the FP is structured and sequestered near the core of the trimer. We hypothesize that the FP may transition between solvent-exposed and sequestered conformations based on \"breathing\" in the trimer. The structure of FP in our b12-or CD4/17b-bound structures could therefore be used to inform structure-based design of stabilized or cyclic fusion peptide mimetic inhibitors of HIV 25, 26 .",

CD4, on the other hand, induces a series of allosteric changes that propagate across gp120 and expose the co-receptor binding site. While the co-receptor binding site is accessible in the CD4-bound structure, it is unclear how further conformational changes in the trimer are triggered by interaction with CCR5/ CXCR4, although the glycan at N262 and formation of \u03b10 likely play a role in signal transmission. Based on the disposition of the co-receptor binding sites three copies of CCR5 27 could bind to the trimer in this conformation. Interestingly, CCR5 forms a crystallographic dimer in the x-ray structure 27 that when docked on top of our trimer structure spans across two gp120 subunits and could potentially interact with two coreceptor binding sites simultaneously (Extended Data Fig. 8 ). Overall, our structural studies have unlocked the molecular details of the first step in the CD4 receptor-mediated fusion process of Env, but the role of the co-receptor remains to be elucidated.",

Particles contributing to classes that did not produce clear structural features were discarded, leaving 98,845 particles. Next, to separate the different particle populations, this stack was subjected to competitive sorting using 3 initial models -trimer alone, trimer + sCD4, trimer + sCD4 + 17b Fab -in an identical manner as previously described 39 . This resulted in three separate stacks containing 69,105 particles (trimer alone), 6,342 particles (trimer + sCD4), and 23,398 particles (trimer + sCD4 + 17b).

The crystal structure of b12 Fab docked into the B41 b12 cryoEM map, revealing that the elbow angle is preserved (middle). When aligned to gp120, the x-ray model reveals a slightly different b12 angle of approach with respect to the cryoEM model (right). These differences may arise due to a more stable, neutralization resistant Tier-2 virus (B41) versus a more flexible lab-adapted Tier 1 BaL pseudovirus, the stabilizing SOSIP modifications used in the soluble constructs (although none are located at the CD4bs epitope or gp120 core), or the low resolution of the cryoET map. (c) The pre-fusion arrangement of gp120 does not allow for b12 binding to B41 SOSIP. 664 due to clashes between the framework regions of the antibody and portions of a neighboring gp120 monomer (V3 and glycans). (d) Rotation of the N197 glycan requires the gp120 subunits to open up and move away from one another. (e,f) Glycan N197 in the b12 epitope acts as a steric barrier in the pre-fusion state and rearranges and moves away from the b12 epitope to allow for b12 binding.

The top of the HR1 helix is capped by the \u03b11 helix of the same protomer in the pre-fusion state (left). CD4binding results in the formation of helix \u03b10, which now caps HR1 of a neighboring protomer (middle). A zoom in of the \u03b10-HR1 interaction reveals that it is downstream to the engineered I559P mutation and likely a feature in native Env (right). (c) The D1 arm of glycan N262 rotates into a newly formed pocket on gp120 (left) positioned under the coreceptor binding site at the base of V3, providing a link between the co-receptor binding site and gp41. The \u03b10 helix region is generally disordered in all published crystal structures of SOSIP trimers as evidenced by higher B-factors for this segment relative to the average gp120 value for each structure (right).",
