That is, with the exception of a few highly evolved examples, they are able to take up nutrients from the environment, grow and self-replicate independently of other living cells. Their biochemical pathways are similar to those of other organisms, but they are morphologically less complex than the cells of higher organisms. The adjective 'prokaryotic' distinguishes the absence of membrane-bound organelles characteristic of bacteria from the 'eukaryotic' cell characterized by the presence of a nuclear membrane.",

It consists of a backbone of N-acetyl-glucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid residues linked to polypeptides, polysaccharides and lipids, called 'peptidoglycan'. Peptidoglycan is responsible for the rigidity of the cell wall, and maintenance of the characteristic shape of an organism. Gram's stain differentiates bacteria into those that take up and retain a complex of crystal violet and iodine, and those that do not. This ability is a function of the cell wall. Gram-positive organisms (stained blue/black) have a cell wall consisting largely of peptidoglycan linked to teichoic acids. In contrast, the cell wall of Gram-negative organisms (usually counterstained pink) is far more complex with an outer membrane of lipoprotein and lipopolysaccharide (also unique to bacteria), separated from the peptidoglycan layer by the periplasmic space. This arrangement has important consequences for the ability of Gram-negative bacteria to neutralize the activity of certain antimicrobial agents such as the cell wall active \u03b2-lactams (penicillins and cephalosporins). Peptidoglycan is synthesized with the assistance of transpeptidases, also known as penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs), which are a target for \u03b2-lactams. This group of antibacterial agents is thus acting against a metabolic pathway unique to bacteria, with consequent low toxicity to eukaryotic cells. The presence of \u03b2-lactamases in the periplasmic space may result in the bacteria being resistant to these agents. Mycoplasmas are unique among bacteria in not having a rigid cell wall, while the chlamydiae lack peptidoglycan. Not surprisingly, these bacteria are essentially resistant to \u03b2-lactams. of bacteria include: morphology, staining reaction, need for oxygen, utilization or production of various chemicals, chemical constitution and, increasingly, genomic make-up. The latter includes genome size, guanosine and cytosine ratio (GC ratio) and DNA relatedness as determined by hybridization and sequencing techniques.",

The surface (e.g. an initially sterile burn) will soon become colonized with whatever organisms are around.

More sophisticated evasive mechanisms include the production of proteases that cleave IgA, a feature of pathogens invading via mucosal surfaces such as Neisseria spp., or coating with host proteins, such as fibronectin as found in T. pallidum.

Sensitive bacteria will not survive in the presence of antibiotics, and even if clinically resistant may not be recoverable on artificial media. The correct transport medium should always be used for swabs, to maintain the balance of organisms as similar to the clinical situation as possible, and to ensure the likely survival of pathogens. Because organisms will continue to divide at ambient temperature, specimens should be kept at +4\u00b0C and transported to the laboratory as soon as feasible. Some organisms, for example chlamydiae and viruses, survive better at \u221270\u00b0C. The use of a conventional deep freeze at \u221220\u00b0C is satisfactory for preserving bacteria and storing serum samples, but is lethal to chlamydiae. Exceptions to these rules are fastidious organisms such as the gonococcus, which do not survive well out of the clinical situation and should be either direct plated at the bedside or rapidly transported to the laboratory. To increase the likelihood of a positive result, liquid pus should always be preferred to a swab dipped in the pus; gas liquid chromatography which in skilled hands can rapidly discriminate different anaerobes is now rarely used in practice. Different antigen or genome tests require different collection media, even where the same organism is being detected.

It is never possible to speciate organisms on microscopy.

Culture of organisms is necessary in most circumstances to define a full picture of the organisms colonizing or infecting a particular site. Sites that are normally sterile, such as blood and cerebrospinal fluid, should present little problem to the laboratory as any organism ought to be significant. However, the possibility of contamination of the specimen during collection, even under optimal conditions, may make interpretation difficult.

Non-culture detection tests provide two useful functions. First, they may be used in situations where rapid diagnosis has important therapeutic and public health consequences, e.g. in meningitis. Second, the tests are useful to diagnose pathogens that are difficult or slow to isolate in the laboratory. The best example of this group is in the diagnosis of chlamydial infection. Because of the need for cell culture to isolate the organism, the development of non-culture detection tests has served to highlight the prevalence and importance of the organism, and also to make diagnostic facilities more widely available. The disadvantage is that the tests are of variable sensitivity, and in some hands specificity is less than optimal. Direct immunofluorescence tests are of good sensitivity, but are subjective; in contrast enzymeimmunoassay systems are of high specificity, but generally of lower sensitivity.

Gonococcal and chlamydial infections affect the cervix, causing upper genital discharge. Bacterial vaginosis, gonococcal and chlamydial infections all predispose to ascending infection resulting in endometritis and salpingitis, with the attendant sequelae of ectopic pregnancy or infertility. Bacterial vaginosis also appears to be a factor in the pathogenesis of pre-term labour.",

            "text": "Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria Table 7 .2 lists some of the more medically important bacteria. Staph. aureus is distinguished from other staphylococci by production of coagulase. Increasingly, these organisms are proving to be resistant to the antistaphylococcal \u03b2-lactam antibiotics (penicillins and cephalosporins). Such strains are designated methicillin-resistant Staph. aureus (MRSA) after the now obsolete antibiotic used as a laboratory test to detect them. Strains are frequently also multi-resistant, and some are able to spread easily through clinical areas (epidemic MRSA -EMRSA). MRSA are usually no more virulent than other coagulase-positive staphylococci, and frequently colonize wounds and carrier sites. However, when they do cause infection the antibiotic choice is considerably limited compared with methicillin-sensitive strains. Streptococci are divided into three broad groups based on their haemolysis of horse blood agar. Strains producing partial haemolysis (resulting in a greenish pigmentation of the agar) are termed \u03b1-haemolytic. This group comprises a number of commensal strains found particularly on the skin and in the mouth ('viridans' streptococci), but they are also important pathogens in deep-seated abscesses and endocarditis. The pneumococcus and enterococci (Enterococcus (Streptococcus) faecalis and Ent. faecium) are also important members of this group. Pneumococci are showing increasing resistance to penicillin. The enterococci are frequent super-infecting organisms, particularly associated with cephalosporin therapy. Glycopeptides (vancomycin and teicoplanin) are often required to treat enterococcal infection; consequently the emergence of vancomycin-and teicoplanin-resistant strains (VRE) is a major worry. Complete haemolysis is termed \u03b2-haemolysis. Organisms in this group are further subdivided into the Lancefield Groups A to O. Some \u03b1-haemolytic strains also have Lancefield antigens, e.g. the enterococcus is Lancefield Group D. The major human pathogens are in Groups A, B, C and G. However, members of these four groups may also occur as normal human flora. The Group A streptococcus is the most important pathogen (Str. pyogenes) and remains fully sensitive to penicillin. The third broad group is the non-haemolytic streptococci, which are commensal organisms, although anaerobic streptococci may cause wound infections.",

The downward displacement autoclave relies on the incoming steam to displace air from the load. Any combination of air and steam will result in sterilizing conditions not being achieved. Therefore a downward displacement autoclave using the UK cycle cannot be used to sterilize wrapped loads or loads with narrow lumens, such as liposuction cannulae. To achieve reliable air removal and steam penetration, a vacuum autoclave is required, which draws a high prevacuum before steam is introduced to the autoclave chamber. It is important that the instruments placed in a downward displacement autoclave are packed loosely, not placed within impervious containers. In contrast a high vacuum autoclave is packed tightly to physically remove the bulk of air in the chamber. Recently, benchtop vacuum autoclaves have been developed. These allow small wrapped loads or a few items with lumens to be processed away from sterile service departments. These machines must not be overloaded. The quality of water used to generate the steam is also important. Water for irrigation should be used in benchtop autoclaves and changed at least daily; this prevents the build-up of pyrogens such as endotoxin, which may remain despite the organisms being killed.

The definitive host is the cat, both domestic and wild cats, in which the sexual cycle occurs in the intestine. Human infection rates may be as high as 90% in some populations. Infection is most often acquired by ingesting bradyzoites in undercooked meat. It may also follow ingestion of oocysts containing tachyzoites resulting from the sexual cycle in the intestine of a cat, which are then excreted in its faeces. Cat litter trays and garden soil contaminated with cat faeces are a likely source to be avoided in pregnancy. After ingestion, the tachyzoites are distributed to many organs and tissues via the bloodstream and invade nucleated cells in all parts of the body and fetus. They multiply within the host cells, disrupting them by producing tissue cysts containing large numbers of slowly metabolizing bradyzoites. Focal areas of necrosis occur in many organs, particularly the muscles, brain and eye. Human infection is usually subclinical but may produce a glandular fever-like syndrome or choroidoretinitis. Transplacental infection may occur during an acute infection in the mother, which may not be diagnosed but may result in serious disease in the fetus.

With negative-strand viruses, a complementary RNA copy of the viral genome, or part of it, acts as messenger RNA. One further group of RNA viruses known as reversi viruses replicates by reverse transcription of viral genomic RNA to form a DNA intermediate, from which both messenger RNA and progeny viral genomes are transcribed.

Each step bears a constant relationship to its neighbours around a central axis which could be represented by the well of the staircase. Cubic symmetry is more complex and describes a group of regular units which have symmetry properties in common with a cube. Specifically for viruses, it includes the tetrahedron, octahedron and icosahedron. Most viruses exhibiting cubic symmetry that infect humans have icosahedral symmetry (Fig. 7.4) .

Naturally acquired infection with a particular strain of influenza A or B results in long-term immunity to that strain, but not those influenza strains which have exhibited major antigenic changes (antigenic shift) or even minor degrees of variation (antigenic drift). Others cause persistent infections, in which the patient often remains infected for life. Persistent infections may be characterized by an acute phase of infection, which may or may not be symptomatic, followed by life-long latency, where the virus persists in a nonreplicative form with restricted viral gene expression. Subsequent reactivations of infection may occur, although in the immunocompetent person reactivated infection is usually more limited than primary infection, and may be asymptomatic. This pattern of persistence is typical of herpesviruses such as herpes simplex virus (HSV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV).

The following criteria for early delivery have been proposed by Wong et al (2003 There seems to be no reason for elective pre-term delivery in those women who are relatively well with SARS infection. Pregnant women should be treated empirically since a laboratory diagnosis may be prolonged.

In developing countries, infection is usually contracted heterosexually. In Britain, HIV infection tends to be concentrated in London. In its inner-city areas, up to 0.5% of pregnant women are now HIV-1 positive. In the absence of treatment with a combination of antiretroviral drugs, HIV-1 is transmitted to the fetus of infected mothers in about 12-15% of cases. Combination antiretroviral therapy has reduced the HIV transmission rate, and studies suggest that chemotherapy together with delivery by caesarean section further reduces the risk of transmission to 1-2%. Infection may be transmitted in utero but occurs more frequently during delivery, or when breastfeeding. In contrast to HIV-1, HIV-2 is transmitted in only about 1% of cases, and this is almost certainly a manifestation of the much lower maternal viral load present. If HIV infection occurs in utero, it is usually possible to establish a diagnosis during the first few weeks of life. If infection occurs during delivery or via breastfeeding, or in infants born to mothers on antiretroviral treatment, it may take considerably longer to establish a diagnosis of HIV infection in infancy. Diagnosis of HIV infection in infancy is usually made by detecting the virus by whether using molecular methods to detect HBV DNA in mothers with anti-HBe may detect those with high levels of viraemia, whose children should be given active/passive vaccination.",

The prevalence among pregnant women in some inner-city areas in London is about 0.25%.

Although it is recommended that women with evidence of a recurrent lesion at delivery should deliver by caesarean section, transmission is rare; studies from the Netherlands have shown that the risks of acquiring neonatal HSV following caesarean section and vaginal delivery are not significantly different. Testing mothers with a history of recurrent herpes, or whose partners give a history, is no longer recommended, since virus shedding in late pregnancy does not correlate with transmission to the neonate.

Infants delivered of mothers who are HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and 'e' antigen (HBeAg) positive should be protected by the administration of hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and HBV vaccine (active/passive immunization) at birth. Provided a full course of vaccine is given (three doses and a booster), this procedure will effectively reduce the risk of persistent HBV infection in the infant by about 95%, thereby reducing the risk of long-term chronic liver damage and primary hepatocellular carcinoma. Infants delivered of mothers who have antibody to HBeAg (anti-HBe) should be given HBV vaccine without HBIG. Infants whose mothers are HBsAg positive without 'e' markers, or where the 'e' marker status has not been determined, or whose mothers had acute hepatitis B during pregnancy, should be given active/ passive immunization. There is currently a debate on riers. The prevalence of antibodies among antenatal patients in London and Birmingham is 0.14-0.26%.
