Non-fat, 1% and 2% skim milk, at 5.8%, 5.0% and 5.3% Try/LNAA%, respectively, are only 23%, 6% and 12% above the benchmark sorghum (4.7%) and yogurt is below it (\u00c050%), as previously noted. Whole milk, with a Try/LNAA% of 11.3%, has about twice the tryptophan of the lower-fat milks. Dieticians need to consider the relative tryptophan levels to prevent developmental delays and also to ensure that apparently normal children develop to their full potential.

We propose that these cells be taken from elder individuals, whose immunity has seen them through many a battle with diseases over time, and be transfused in small quantities, sufficient to direct the development of other lymphocytes, into young infants. This, of course, is only after testing for blood group and other compatibilities.",

The assumption has generally been that SAM-e produces antidepressant effects by serving as a cofactor for methyltransferase enzymes [2] , but the true mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of SAM-e are still unknown. Renshaw et al. [15] proposed that increases in adenosine (Ado), a major metabolite of SAM-e, or its nucleotides, may mediate the antidepressant effects of SAM-e [15] . Ado monophosphate (AMP), Ado diphosphate (ADP), and Ado triphosphate (ATP) comprise the ''adenylate pool,\" meaning AMP + ADP + ATP. Researchers have found that Ado can produce antidepressant effects in animal models of depression, and those effects seem to be mediated by changes in a variety of neurotransmitter systems [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] .",

SAM-e increases Ado formation by serving as a cofactor for numerous methyltransferase enzymes [2] , and the S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) formed as a product of those transmethylations can then be hydrolyzed, by SAH hydrolase (SAHH), to Ado and homocysteine [2] .
