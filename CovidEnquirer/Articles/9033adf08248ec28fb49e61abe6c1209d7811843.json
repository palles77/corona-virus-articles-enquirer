            "text": "Transcription of hepatitis B virus (HBV) from the covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) template is essential for its replication. Suppressing the level and transcriptional activity of cccDNA might have anti-HBV effect. Although cellular transcription factors, such as CREB, which mediate HBV transcription, have been well described, transcriptional coactivators that facilitate this process are incompletely understood. In this study we showed that CREBregulated transcriptional coactivator 1 (CRTC1) is required for HBV transcription and replication. The steady-state levels of CRTC1 protein were elevated in HBV-positive hepatoma cells and liver tissues. Ectopic expression of CRTC1 or its homolog CRTC2 or CRTC3 in hepatoma cells stimulated the activity of the preS2/S promoter of HBV, whereas overexpression of a dominant inactive form of CRTC1 inhibited HBV transcription. CRTC1 interacts with CREB and they are mutually required for the recruitment to the preS2/S promoter on cccDNA and for the activation of HBV transcription. Accumulation of pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) and cccDNA was observed when CRTC1 or its homologs were overexpressed, whereas the levels of pgRNA, cccDNA and secreted HBsAg were diminished when CRTC1 was compromised. In addition, HBV transactivator protein HBx stabilized CRTC1 and promoted its activity on HBV transcription. Our work reveals an essential role of CRTC1 coactivator in facilitating and supporting HBV transcription and replication.",

Upon viral entry and release of genetic material, covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA) is generated from relaxed circular DNA (rcDNA) and complexed with different viral proteins, histones, transcription factors and coactivators to form a nuclear minichromosome, which serves as a central template for all HBV transcription (4, 5) . Transcription of pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) from cccDNA is rate-limiting in genome amplification and replication. cccDNA can be amplified through an unknown mechanism (6) . The stability of the cccDNA pool is a major determinant in viral clearance. cccDNA is refractory to antivirals such as nucleoside or nucleotide analogs. cccDNA is also accounted for viral relapse after cessation of anti-HBV therapy (5) . cccDNA is therefore an important target for better control and elimination of HBV infection (7, 8) . In line with this, understanding the mechanism by which HBV transcription from cccDNA is regulated might reveal new strategies for therapeutic intervention.",

It acts as a transcriptional activator that modestly activates cellular transcription factors including CREB, NF-B and AP1 (17) . HBx is required for HBV transcription and productive infection in vivo (18, 19) . HBx does not bind DNA. Its ability to activate HBV promoters is mediated through CREB (10, 20) . Mechanistically, HBx enhances CREB dimerization and potentiates coactivator function of p300/CBP (20, 21) . However, the interplay among HBx, CREB and CRTCs in HBV transcription remains to be understood. Particularly, it will be of interest to see whether and how HBx interacts with and modulates CRTC activity.",

In contrast, the mRNA levels of all three CRTCs were comparable in the presence and absence of HBV ( Figure 1C) , indicating that the effect on CRTC1 occurs at protein but not mRNA level. To verify CRTC1 expression in natural infection of HBV, we examined a small number of HBV-positive or HBV-negative human liver tissues.

CRTCs potentiate CREB-dependent transcription depending on the promoter context (32, 33) . Although CRE elements are found in preS2 and X promoters of HBV (10, 11) , it remains to be determined whether they are activated by CRTCs. With this in mind, we asked how CRTCs might affect transcriptional activity of these two promoters. All three CRTCs were expressed to comparable levels in HepG2 cells (Figure 2A ). Whereas all three CRTCs activated preS2 promoter significantly ( Figure 2B , groups 2-4 compared to 1), they had minimal or no influence on basal activity of X promoter in the same setting ( Figure 2C ). Hence, CRTCs are capable of activating HBV transcription from the preS2 promoter.",

            "text": "The importance of CREB in HBV transcription prompted us to investigate whether CRTC1 activation of the preS2 promoter requires CREB function. As a first step, we gen- erated additional reporter constructs in which the CRE elements in the preS2 promoter were disrupted. Similar constructs were previously described (10) . Indeed, progressive removal of CRE elements effectively blunted CRTC1 activation of the preS2 promoter ( Figure 5A , groups 5 and 6 compared to 4). Next, we asked whether functional CREB is critical in supporting CRTC1 activity by overexpressing A-CREB, a dominant inactive form of CREB (34) . CRTC1 activation of the preS2 promoter was erased by A-CREB ( Figure 5B , groups 3 and 4 compared to 2). Reciprocally, CREB activation of the preS2 promoter was progressively suppressed when we increased M1-CRTC1 expression in HepG2 cells ( Figure 5C , groups 3 and 4 compared to 2). In line with this, the recruitment of CRTC1 to preS2-CRE was abrogated when A-CREB was overexpressed in pHBV1.3D-transfected HepG2 cells ( Figure 5D , group 4 compared to 3). Reciprocal immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting experiments confirmed the formation were used to deplete endogenous CRTC1 at a concentration of 100 nM. siNC was used as a negative control. Endogenous CRTC1 in siRNA-transfected HepG2 cells was analyzed by western blotting at 72 h post-transfection using rabbit anti-CRTC1. Concurrently, total RNA was extracted and cDNA was synthesized. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed to analyze the relative levels of CRTC1 and CRTC2 transcripts. The difference between bars 1 and 5 is statistically significant by Student's t test (P = 0.0018, highlighted with **). The difference between bars 2 and 6 is statistically not significant (n.s.) by Student's t test (P = 0.74). (E) CREB recruitment to pre-S2 promoter was diminished in CRTC1-compromised HepG2 cells. After 24 h of CRTC1 knockdown, pHBV1.3D was transfected into HepG2 cells for another 48 h. ChIP was performed as in Figure 2D . The differences between groups 2 and 3 (P = 0.00023, highlighted with ***) as well as between groups 2 and 4 (P = 0.013, highlighted with *) are statistically significant; AU: arbitrary unit. (F) Knockdown of CRTC1 repressed pgRNA expression. The differences between groups 2 and 3 (P = 0.00031, highlighted with ***) as well as between groups 2 and 4 (P = 0.022, highlighted with *) are statistically significant by Student's t test. (G) Knockdown of CRTC1 dampened cccDNA level. Nuclear cccDNA was analyzed as in Figure 3B . The differences between groups 2 and 3 (P = 0.00012, highlighted with ***) as well as between groups 2 and 4 (P = 0.0089, highlighted with **) are statistically significant by Student's t test. (H) CRTC1 is required for production of cell-free virus. After 24 h of CRTC1 knockdown, pHBV1.3D was transfected into HepG2 cells for another 48 h. Culture medium was centrifugated to remove debris and then detected for HBsAg using Monolisa TM ULTRA kit (BioRad). Relative HBsAg level in siNC-transfected cells was taken as 1. The differences between groups 2 and 3 (P = 0.00071, highlighted with ***) as well as between groups 2 and 4 (P = 0.0047, highlighted with **) are statistically significant by Student's t test. The difference between groups 4 and 5 is statistically significant by Student's t test (P = 0.0014, highlighted with **); vec: empty vector. (B) CRTC1 activation of preS2 promoter was blunted by dominant inactive CREB. HepG2 cells were transfected with preS2-Luc (100 ng), a fixed amount of pcDNA3.1-V5/His-CRTC1/2/3 (100 ng) and escalating amounts of A-CREB plasmid (10 and 20 ng). The differences between groups 2 and 3 (P = 0.0010, highlighted with **) as well as between groups 2 and 4 (P = 0.00099, highlighted with ***) are statistically significant by Student's t test. (C) CREB-mediated preS2 promoter activation was ablated in the presence of dominant inactive CRTC1. HepG2 cells were transfected with preS2-Luc (100 ng), a fixed amount of Tag2B-CREB (100 ng) and escalating amounts of M1-CRTC1 plasmids (25 and 50 ng). The differences between groups 2 and 3 (P = 0.0045, highlighted with **) as well as between groups 2 and 4 (P = 0.00040, highlighted with ***) are statistically significant by Student's t test. (D) CRTC1 recruitment to preS2 promoter was prevented when CREB function was compromised. ChIP was performed as in Figure 2D . The difference between groups 3 and 4 is statistically significant by Student's t test (P = 0.00036, highlighted with ***); N.D.: not detected. Figure S2A and B) . Hence, CRTC1 requires and cooperates with CREB to stimulate HBV transcription.",

Similar results were also obtained for CRTC2 and CRTC3 (data not shown). In addition, CRTC1 was detected in the HBx immunoprecipitate ( Figure 6C , lane 3 compared to 2), indicating their association in cultured cells. Interestingly, the protein bands of both CRTC1 and HBx were more prominent when they were co-expressed ( Figure 6C , lane 3 compared to 1 and 2), implicating a mutual stabilization effect. Unexpectedly, an additional slow-migrating HBx species was observed when CRTC1 was co-expressed ( Figure 6C , lane 3 compared to 1).

To explore whether HBx might affect the stability of CRTC1 through a similar mechanism, we compared the interaction of HBx with CRTC1 and its active nonphosphorylatable form, CRTC1-S167A. When CRTC1 and CRTC1-S167A were co-expressed with HBx in HepG2 cells, similar amounts of CRTC1 protein were found in the HBx immunoprecipitate (Supplementary Figure S3 , lane 3 compared to 2). In addition, both forms of CRTC1 enhanced the recruitment of CREB to the HBx-containing complex, but to similar extent (Supplementary Figure S3 , lanes 2 and 3 compared to 1). Thus, HBx has no binding preference to CRTC1-S167A. On the other hand, when we overexpressed CREB, the association of HBx and CRTC1 was not affected (Supplementary Figure S4 , lane 4 compared to 3). Consistent with results in Supplementary Figure S3 , both CRTC1 and CREB were found in the HBx precipitate (Supplementary Figure S4 ).

The K0 mutant of ubiquitin prevents polyubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation, but allows mono-and multi-ubiquitination, which might be linked to lysosome-dependent degradation (36, 37) . If mutual stabilization of HBx and CRTC1 is mediated solely through polyubiquitination and proteosome, their levels should be unchanged or increased in the presence of MG132 or ubiquitin-K0. Interestingly, the steady-state levels of CRTC1 and HBx decreased only slightly when the cells were treated with MG132 ( Figure 7F , lane 4 compared to 3), implicating a role for proteosome in the stabilization effect. However, the expression of ubiquitin-K0 abrogated this stabilization effect almost completely ( Figure 7F , lane 5 compared to 1-4). Although there was no simple interpretation to this result, one possibility is that mono-or multiubiquitination of HBx and CRTC1 might promote their proteosomal degradation. Plausibly, the stability of HBx and CRTC1 might be governed by multiple mechanisms involving ubiquitination, proteosome and lysosome.",

Our demonstration of CRTC activation of the preS2 but not the X promoter of HBV ( Figure 2 ) supports the notion that the coactivator function of CRTCs in HBV transcription is also promoter context dependent. Although the exact promoter context that governs CRTC requirement is not currently understood, a comparison of the preS2 and X promoters sheds some light on this issue. Noteworthily, there are two consecutive CREs in the preS2 promoter, both of which are required for optimal activation by CRTC1 ( Figure 5 ). In contrast, only one single CRE has been found in the X promoter (11) . Further experiments should therefore be performed to determine whether this difference in the number of CREs might be decisive in promoter responsiveness to CRTCs.",

However, an indirect stimulatory role of CRTC2 on the core promoter mediated through PGC1\u2423 has also been suggested (13) . We also observed a modest activation of the preS1 and core promoters by all three CRTCs (Supplementary Figure S1) . However, since no CRE has been found in these promoters, their general and mild activation by CRTCs is likely mediated indirectly through a CREB-regulated gene such as PGC1\u2423. Thus, the influence of CRTCs on HBV transcription might be exerted through both direct activation as demonstrated in our study and an indirect effect as suggested for CRTC2 (13) . Particularly, the stimulatory effect of CRTCs on pgRNA expression (Figure 3 ) could be mediated through the core promoter.",

It is noteworthy that small molecule activators and inhibitors of LKB1 and its downstream protein kinases, including metformin and salicylate, have been well documented (16, 40) . We have recently shown that LKB1 and its downstream kinases potently suppress transcriptional activity of CRTC1 and CREB in the context of human T-cell leukemia type 1 virus infection. In addition, the activation of these kinases using small molecule agonists such as metformin exhibits strong antiretroviral effects (27) .

This stabilization unlikely occurs at the mRNA level since CRTC mRNAs remained unchanged in pHBV1.3D-transfected cells ( Figure 1C ) in which HBx was abundantly expressed ( Figure 1B ). In addition, the stabilization of HBx was seen not only when it was expressed from a plasmid in transfected HepG2 cells but also when it was expressed in HepG2.2.15 cells from its own promoter in the HBV genome (Figure 7) , which is not responsive to CRTCs (Figure 2 ). The mechanism by which HBx and CRTC1/2 proteins mutually stabilize each other warrants further study. First, the functional domains in HBx and CRTC1/2 that mediate their interaction and stabilization should be determined. CRTC3 is more divergent from CRTC1/2 and smaller in size; comparative analysis might reveal why CRTC3 was not stabilized by HBx (Figure 7) .",

Further investigations are required to resolve this discrepancy and to clarify whether and how other viral proteins might affect CRTC2 protein expression. Second, the slow-migrating form of HBx detected in the presence of CRTC1/2/3 (Figure 7) should be further characterized. Particularly, whether it represented mono-or multi-ubiquitinated HBx should be clarified. Finally, exactly how stability of HBx and CRTCs in HBV-infected cells would be regulated through ubiquitination and proteolysis should be clarified. HBx has previously been shown to stabilize AIB1 oncoprotein by preventing its ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation (42) . In view of the minimal to mild effect of MG132 on the mutual stabilization of HBx and CRTC1 (Figure 7) , a role for polyubiquitination and proteosome was suggested. However, the abrogation of the mutual stabilization effect by ubiquitin-K0 pointed to another direction. This discrepancy should be resolved in future work. The possibility that HBx and CRTC1 might be mono-or multi-ubiquitinated and then degraded by the lysosome should be experimentally validated. Alternatively, K63-linked or other types of polyubiquitination of CRTC1 suppressed by ubiquitin-K0 might be required for its stabilization. Our data cannot exclude that multiple mechanisms might operate in the control of HBx and CRTC stability. Further investigations should be performed to determine the involvement of proteosome, lysosome and different types of ubiquitination in the destruction of HBx and CRTCs in HBV-infected cells.",

This is generally consistent with the notion that CRTC1regulated HBV transcription is influential in viral replication. The decline of cccDNA level upon CRTC1 suppression ( Figure 4 ) is noteworthy. It raises one interesting possibility that compromising CRTC1 might destabilize cccDNA. Histone hypoacetylation is known to regulate cccDNA transcription (43) . APOBEC3-mediated cytidine deamination has recently been shown to trigger specific degradation of cccDNA (8) . Whether and how CRTC1 recruitment to cccDNA and its post-translational modifications might affect cccDNA stability and function merit further investigations.",

CRTC1 might plausibly play a role in both acute and chronic phase of HBV infection.
