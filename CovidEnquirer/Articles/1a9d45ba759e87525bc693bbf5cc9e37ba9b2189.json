            "text": "This study presents data from a prospective study of adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP). Of 493 patients included in the study, 223 (45.2%) were aged \u2021 65 years, and 265 (53.7%) had one or more underlying diseases, mostly chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus or dementia. In total, 281 microorganisms were identified in 250 (50.7%) patients, with two or more pathogens detected in 28 (5.7%) cases. Microbial diagnosis varied according to age, severity, co-morbidity and site-of-care, but there was much overlap among groups. Streptococcus pneumoniae was the single most prevalent organism in outpatients, patients admitted to hospital, and patients who died, either as a single pathogen or combined with another organism. Infections caused by 'atypical' pathogens were seen across all groups, including the elderly and patients with co-morbidities. Mortality varied according to the pneumonia severity index (PSI) of the pneumonia patient outcomes research team. Shock (OR 34.48), an age of > 65 years (OR 25) and altered mental status (OR 9.92) were factors associated independently with 30-day mortality. Key findings from this study were the advanced age of the population with CAP, and the high prevalence of dementia as an underlying disease. The study also revealed that microbiological diagnosis of CAP remains problematic. Although certain epidemiological features may help to predict the microbial aetiology, the overlap among groups reduces the usefulness of this information in guiding therapeutic decisions. Greater effort should be made to improve identification methods for microbial pathogens causing CAP.",

While most studies suggest that current levels of b-lactam resistance do not usually result in treatment failures among patients with pneumococcal pneumonia [19, 20] , therapeutic failures attributable to macrolide-resistant S. pneumoniae have been reported among patients treated with an oral macrolide who required admission subsequently with S. pneumoniae bacteraemia [21, 22] . However, the availability of newer fluoroquinolones with greater activity against S. pneumoniae and other respiratory pathogens, as well as novel immunochromatographic assays to detect S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila antigens in urine, have facilitated the medical management of CAP [23] [24] [25] .",

The aim of the present work was to provide a comprehensive overview of the current clinical and epidemiological features of CAP by conducting a prospective population-based study with two major advantages: (1) the inclusion of consecutive patients covering a broad clinical spectrum of CAP; and (2) an extensive microbiological workup, including detection of urinary antigen for S. pneumoniae and L. pneumophila, and standard serological tests and criteria for atypical and virus pathogens. A previous report evaluated the Binax immunochromatographic assay for detection of S. pneumoniae urinary antigen in the same patient cohort [32] . The present study presents a complete analysis of the epidemiological features, microbial diagnosis and outcome for these patients.",

All adult patients ( \u2021 15 years) from this Health Authority with signs and symptoms compatible with pneumonia over the 24-month study period were eligible for inclusion in the study. The study was approved by the local Ethical Committee. Attending clinicians were asked to consider the possibility of pneumonia in any patient with an acute illness and symptoms suggesting lower respiratory tract infection, including a new cough with high fever or chills, pleuritic chest pain, dyspnoea or prolonged fever. Patients were evaluated clinically and roentgenographically, and those with a provisional diagnosis of CAP were seen by a study investigator to confirm the diagnosis. CAP was defined as an acute illness associated with at least one of the following signs or symptoms: fever, new cough with or without sputum production, pleuritic chest pain, dyspnoea or altered breath sound on auscultation, plus a chest radiograph showing an opacity compatible with the presence of acute pneumonia. Patients who had been hospitalised previously within 2 weeks of a current diagnosis of pneumonia were excluded.",

The uniform sampling in all groups of patients, the comprehensive search for microorganisms, and the use of standard diagnostic tests and criteria to establish the aetiological diagnosis form an important addition to our present knowledge of the epidemiology of CAP. Among the most interesting observations from the cohort were the older age of the population, compared with previous population-based studies [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] , and the high prevalence of dementia as an underlying disease. The older age of the population may have accounted in part for the higher proportion of patients admitted to hospital compared with other population-based studies carried out in the last decade. In the present study, dementia emerged as a significant co-morbid illness in patients with CAP, ranking after chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes mellitus. Pneumonia is one of the most serious medical conditions seen in late-stage dementia, and is a common cause of death in these patients [40] . The high prevalence of dementia observed in the present study is probably related to population ageing, which was also reflected in the older age of the patients included in the study. Although Alzheimer's disease is an increasing problem in the elderly, affecting 4.5 million individuals in the USA alone [41] , the presence of dementia was not found to be a major risk factor for CAP in epidemiological studies published in the last decade. However, a recent study of CAP in patients aged \u2021 80 years admitted to hospital found that dementia was the fourth most common underlying disease after chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic heart disease and diabetes mellitus [42] . Patients with dementia may be particularly susceptible to pneumonia because of their swallowing difficulties and the use of sedative medications, which are factors that have been found to increase the risk of pneumonia in elderly patients living in long-term care facilities [43, 44] . The problem of pneumonia in patients with dementia may be more serious in the future in view of forecasts of a continued increase in the number of individuals with Alzheimer's disease [41] .",

The results obtained showed a high proportion of patients with pneumococcal CAP. S. pneumoniae was the most frequent organism identified, both in outpatients and in patients requiring admission to hospital, and it was also the most frequent pathogen involved in mixed infections and in fatal cases.

The lack of a reference standard for diagnosis, combined with the occurrence of epidemic outbreaks during some studies, may account in part for the wide variations in the reported incidence rates. In order to determine the significance of C. pneumoniae as a cause of pneumonia in a population, it is critical to use standard diagnostic tests and criteria, and to perform studies for a sufficient length of time to avoid any seasonal bias. The present study used CDC criteria [48] for diagnosing definite acute infection by serology, and patients were recruited over a 2-year period.

In contrast, pneumonias caused by Legionella were seen with similar frequency in young and older individuals, and in patients with or without co-morbidities. Although Mycoplasma and Chlamydia infections were more common in the youngest patients, 22% of all cases of pneumonia caused by these organisms occurred in patients aged > 65 years.

The incidence of CAP caused by atypical pathogens, including M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae, was highest among outpatients, but was also high among hospitalised patients. The importance of M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae and Legionella in pneumonias requiring hospitalisation has been highlighted in several previous studies of CAP [30, 51, 52] . Although atypical pathogens other than Legionella spp. have usually been associated with mild-to-moderate illness, severe cases requiring admission to an intensive care unit have also been reported [53] . In the CBPIS study [30] , pneumonia caused by M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae accounted for between 8% (using criteria for definite diagnosis) and 35% (using criteria for possible diagnosis) of all patients with pneumonia who required hospitalisation. A recent study found that CAP patients aged \u2021 60 years with Chlamydia infection had the highest hospitalisation rate, leading to the suggestion that pneumonia caused by Chlamydia can rival even pneumococcal pneumonia for severity [47] . However, little information was actually available on the severity at presentation of atypical pneumonia using a validated prognostic tool. The results of the present study, using the validated PORT prediction rule for 30-day mortality and medical complications to quantify severity of illness at presentation, suggest that the severity of CAP caused by atypical organisms may have been overestimated. Indeed, most patients with CAP caused by M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae had a disease of low severity, and all such patients had a favourable outcome. According to current recommendations [2] , most of these cases should probably have been treated at home.",

Recent populationbased data show that most cases of Legionella infection probably present as mild-to-moderate disease, rather than severe pneumonia [58, 59] . In the largest outbreak of Legionnaires' disease to date, with more than 800 cases reported, one-third of the patients were managed as outpatients and a case fatality rate of only 1.1% was observed [58] . In the present population-based study using the PORT classification, of 21 cases of Legionnaires' disease, 15 (71.4%) were classified within 'lowseverity' and six (28.6%) within 'high-severity' risk classes.

Thus, patients with CAP are often classified into groups, each with a list of likely pathogens and a suggested empirical therapy, based on stratification according to age, place of therapy, co-morbidity and severity [1] [2] [3] . The present data confirmed that microbial diagnosis varies according to epidemiological factors, but there was too much overlap between groups for this information to be used as a guide for therapeutic decisions. Selection of empirical therapy is complicated further by the marked increase in b-lactam and macrolide resistance among isolates of S. pneumoniae, and by the increasing concern about mixed infections [5, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . A low proportion of cases of CAP in the present study were considered to be of mixed aetiology. Mixed infections were seen across all age groups, including elderly patients, and in both hospitalised patients and outpatients [29, 30, 34] .",

In addition, recent data suggest an advantage in using an empirical b-lactammacrolide combination, rather than monotherapy, for the treatment of CAP that is associated subsequently with pneumococcal bacteraemia [16, 17, 64] . However, all of these investigations were retrospective, with design limitations and several sources of bias [65] . In the present study, combined therapy was not associated with a better outcome in the multivariate analysis when compared with monotherapy. Although the frequent involvement of pneumococci in mixed pneumonias would support a role for dual therapy in pneumococal infection, no association was demonstrated between combined antibiotic therapy and outcome in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia. Although these findings may argue against the use of dual therapy in patients with pneumococcal pneumonia, the results should be interpreted with caution because the relatively small size of the groups affects the power and general applicability of the findings. In addition, as stated in the updated guidelines for CAP from the Infectious Diseases Society of America [2] , until such time as a prospective, randomised trial clarifies this issue, identification of pneumococci should not prevent clinicians from pursuing other diagnostic possibilities (e.g., an 'atypical' co-pathogen), especially when the pneumonia is not responding to treatment.",

The study confirmed that microbial diagnosis of CAP remains problematic, and that the aetiology still cannot be identified in a considerable proportion of cases. Although certain epidemiological features may help to predict the microbial aetiology, the overlap between groups reduces the usefulness of this information in guiding therapeutic decisions. New microbiological techniques are required to improve the ability of laboratories to detect microbial pathogens causing CAP.",
