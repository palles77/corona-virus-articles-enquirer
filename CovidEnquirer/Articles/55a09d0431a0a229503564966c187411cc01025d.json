Several factors are sharpening the tension between the supply and demand for high quality health information, and the health-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) provide a high-profi le example. With thousands of indicators recommended but few measured well, the worldwide health community needs to focus its eff orts on improving measurement of a small set of priority areas. Priority indicators should be selected on the basis of public-health signifi cance and several dimensions of measurability. Health statistics can be divided into three types: crude, corrected, and predicted. Health statistics are necessary inputs to planning and strategic decision making, programme implementation, monitoring progress towards targets, and assessment of what works and what does not. Crude statistics that are biased have no role in any of these steps; corrected statistics are preferred. For strategic decision making, when corrected statistics are unavailable, predicted statistics can play an important part. For monitoring progress towards agreed targets and assessment of what works and what does not, however, predicted statistics should not be used. Perhaps the most eff ective method to decrease controversy over health statistics and to encourage better primary data collection and the development of better analytical methods is a strong commitment to provision of an explicit data audit trail. This initiative would make available the primary data, all post-data collection adjustments, models including covariates used for farcasting and forecasting, and necessary documentation to the public.",

            "text": "Health statistics, often viewed as a dry, dull necessity, are at the centre of several worldwide health controversies. Five factors are fuelling the tension between the supply and demand for high quality health information. First, the need for greater accountability and transparency from governments and international agencies is increasing the demand. Civil society groups, the donor community, scientists, and the public want to benchmark progress and performance of public health and medicine. An important example of this tendency is the emphasis on monitoring, including the health-related Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) 1,2 and the creation of the Healthcare Commission in the UK to independently monitor the National Health Service (NHS). 3 Second, the media, civil society, and the general public are more sceptical about both statistical and scientifi c claims. 4 An example is the public dismay about the confusing messages on fat in the diet over the past two decades. 5 Evidence of government manipulation of data during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic added to the decline in trust. 6 Third, many representatives of the technical and scientifi c community and the general public are becoming increasingly sophisticated consumers of information. The scope of relevant information is expanding from simple descriptive epidemiology about health to dimensions of public health and medicine such as quality, effi ciency, and equity. Consumers often need more detail including quantifi cation of uncertainty. Increased communication and access to diff erent views through the internet are driving scepticism and sophistication, which in turn adds to the broad demand for transparency and accountability.",

Yearly reports, websites, and other publications are regarded as necessary for sustaining political and fi nancial support for their programmes, and for maintaining political priority with governments in developing countries. One result of this response has been an explosion of proposed indicators that should be measured. For example, the Drug Action Programme at WHO has 98 indicators for monitoring structure, process, and outcome 8 and the HIV department has 35 indicators. 9, 10 An internal review presented to the WHO Director General in 2002 found that WHO recommended 3500 indicators covering all programme areas of the organisation.

Although there are many dimensions to improvement of health statistics, I concentrate on three issues that are central to fostering good practice in the use of health statistics: focusing on priority indicators; correct use of crude, corrected, or predicted statistics; and the need for explicit data audit trails. Taken together, addressing these issues would catalyse better worldwide health statistics practice and stimulate increased national interest in strengthening fundamental data platforms. I believe that increased focus on the production, analysis, and dissemination of priority health indicators will create demand for valid, reliable, and comparable health information, which will stimulate national eff orts to strengthen platforms for primary data collection. I do not discuss in detail the interventions that might be necessary to strengthen such platforms. The MDG health-related indicators are used throughout the paper to draw attention to the diffi culties with present indicators in terms of conceptualisation, implementation, and measurement. Although the MDG health-related indicators have been developed for high-level policy use, they represent the issues that generally apply to priority health indicators.

Use of partial or proxy measures runs the danger that they slowly become the de facto quantity of interest in policy debates, distracting attention from the original objective of a policy or programme. Even when an indirect or proxy measure is the only option, mapping from the units of that measure into units of the quantity of interest is preferable-eg, ratios of children surviving to children ever born mapped into child mortality. For intervention coverage indicators, the ideal is to measure the proportion of potential health gain that is delivered for a specifi c health problem. 13 The target for MDG4 is to reduce child mortality; the ideal intervention coverage would measure the proportion of child mortality reduction that could be achieved through the whole collection of aff ordable interventions that are delivered. Compared with this standard, measurement of only one intervention, measles immunisation in the MDGs, is capturing less than 5% of what can be delivered. If only one intervention is to be measured, preference should be given to the intervention that would have the biggest eff ect on the outcome if delivered. Because intervention coverage indicators have the potential to drive managerial attention and resource allocation, claims that part indicators such as measles immunisation are good proxies for the rest of child survival interventions are unproven. The potential for indicator-driven policy also argues for the use of composites capturing the coverage of a set of interventions targeting a health problem.",

The choice of groups for indicator disaggregation, such as rich and poor, urban and rural, occupation, race, or ethnic origin could profoundly change the comparisons of inequality across populations or over time.

These fi gures are subject to many drawbacks, including incomplete ascertainment, non-representativeness, instrument bias, misclassifi cation, and distortion. Incomplete ascertainment or incomplete coverage is a crucial diffi culty for vital registration systems and data from health-service providers. 18 Poor people and other disadvantaged groups often have the greatest health problems and do not get captured in these systems. For household surveys or other sampled data, non-representativeness can be a profound diffi culty. For example, monitoring of HIV seroprevalence in antenatal clinics is often undertaken in clinics with known high prevalence. 19 For many measurements and self-reported items on surveys, the instrument itself can be biased-eg, self-reported weights are systematically under-reported by women. 20 Where events need to be classifi ed into categories such as deaths according to the international classifi cation of diseases and injuries, misclassifi cation or inconsistent classifi cation is a common drawback. [21] [22] [23] Finally, where the stakes are high, producers of data might intentionally, or be encouraged to, distort data. Despite their restrictions, crude health statistics are proposed and used for monitoring. Figure 1 shows the MDG indicator malaria prevalence (notifi ed cases per 100 000) plotted against the prevalence of malaria parasites in blood as systematically reviewed by the MARA (Mapping Malaria Risk in Africa) project for sub-Saharan Africa. 24 Although the prevalence of clinical cases of malaria would not necessarily be perfectly correlated with parasitaemia, the absence of any relation even on log scale suggests that because of variations in ascertainment this MDG indicator cannot be used for any interpretation. In some cases, such as complete vital registration systems, crude statistics can be unbiased and appropriate for analytical use. Since bias in crude statistics is expected, the burden of proof should be to show that crude data are in fact unbiased before they are used for comparative purposes.",

The fi rst is forecasting, whereby a relation is established during a period of observation and then used to predict out of time into the future. A common use of forecasting is to update corrected statistics to a more recent period to produce series of comparable statistics for a base year, such as the MDG indicator data on maternal mortality ratio in 2000, or many statistics in the MDG database for indoor air pollution, water supply, or tuberculosis prevalence. Predictions are also frequently used to generate fi gures in settings where no primary data and thus no corrected statistics are available. Since the methods are identical to those for forecasting, prediction out of sample but in the same time period has been termed farcasting. An example of farcasting is MDG estimates of solid fuel use that have been based for many countries on models relating solid fuel use to GDP per capita in those countries with data. Predicted statistics have uncertainty resulting from model choice and parameter and unexplained variance in the model. Figure 3 provides trends for maternal mortality from 1990 to 2000 for Afghanistan, Angola, Pakistan, Nigeria, South Africa, Burundi, and Algeria. These trends are not based on any empirical measurements and are strictly from predictive models. Nevertheless, the trends are diff erent and show striking fl uctuations. In Pakistan, the maternal mortality ratio is predicted to be increasing, although in Nigeria the ratio is predicted to be declining. Since these trends are not based on any real fi ndings, to infer diff erent amounts of progress on this MDG target would be completely without basis. The MDG database does not provide uncertainty for the trends in this indicator or other predicted indicators.",

For example, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report on levels of obesity by state with self-reported weights and heights in the behavioural risk factor surveillance system survey, which are known to underestimate obesity by roughly 50%. 20 By reporting crude statistics, the onus for correction of known bias to allow for interpretation is shifted to the user. Although this approach makes the task easier for the data generator, it is predicated on a strange premise: the users, including policymakers and the concerned public, are in a better position to adjust for known bias than is the health statistician.

First, several countries in greatest need will have little or no data to report, and if no statistics are reported the topic will lose policy attention. Second, worldwide advocacy needs information on global monitoring. Although the use of predicted statistics to bring attention to a diffi culty seems warranted both nationally and internationally, the temptation to use such information once produced for actual monitoring and even assessment is very great. I believe that if predicted statistics are to be used in such cases, the user must make it very clear that predicted statistics are being used and this use should not become a routine activity. Therefore, publication of databases of annual predicted fi gures, such as for some MDG indicators, does not seem justifi ed. Reported indicator series should, at an absolute minimum, indicate whether fi gures are based on crude, corrected, or predicted values.

A sceptical user should be able to reproduce every fi gure including all steps along the way. Decision makers, the media, or the public are unlikely to use the explicit data audit trail, but the requirement to publish this trail will over time lead to improved practice. The expectation that peers in the technical community will be able to critique methods, suggest other data sources, and even generate alternative fi gures will provide a powerful incentive for improved measurement.",

There are three diffi culties, however, that have restricted the adoption of this approach. First, documentation of all adjustments for known bias and the use of farcasting and forecasting models is time-consuming and expensive. Second, transparency about how some estimates are generated can increase debate about the validity of fi gures in the short term, which is a concern for some programme managers. Third, the component of the explicit data audit trail that calls for primary data to be accessible to the public or at least to interested analysts might confl ict with national privacy laws governing data collection, which is a very important issue. In some countries such as the USA, data are becoming harder to obtain. For example, the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) has stopped releasing mortality data for counties because of privacy concerns.",

In 2002, Mexico passed a sweeping freedom of information act and set up a Federal Institute for Access to Public Information about Mexico, which guarantees unprecedented access to any information held by the government. 39 In India, the Right to Information Act of 2005, seems to provide similar access to information. 40 Various other countries are pursuing similar legislation. 41, 42 Balancing privacy concerns with the need for information to be in the public domain to create a culture of transparency will be a major challenge in the coming decades. Once individual identifi ers such as names and addresses have been removed from survey, census, or vital registration data, privacy concerns revolve around the possibility that, with some investigation, individuals could be identifi ed. 43 For example, perhaps only one 84-year-old woman died in Omaha county, USA, so that the analyst could with further investigation fi nd the name of this individual and what she died of. Such a hypothetical possibility must be balanced against the damage to the community by suppression of health information that could improve population health. In the case of death data in the USA, the NCHS position is hard to understand since death certifi cates for all individuals including names are public records that can be obtained in every state.",

However, in some cases arguments about data confi dentiality are used by institutions to avoid the release of data to other groups. Datasets are often viewed by researchers or organisations as private possessions. Data, of course, are a classic example of a general public good. There is a potential cost that could ultimately be counted in human health of keeping data from the public domain. The principle of an explicit data audit trail and replicability might also be preserved if mechanisms exist to allow restricted access to various datasets with stronger safeguards. Journals such as The Lancet, funding agencies, and governments all have an important part to play in transformation of the culture of data from a feudal to an open democratic model.

Analyses based on these priority indicators can foster demand from decision makers, the media, civil society, the technical community, and the public for better health measurement.

Overall, the set of indicators, the measurement strategies, and the implementation of the MDG health-related indicators is very poor. At least half the indicators are not of high enough public-health importance to warrant major international attention or investments in their assessment. Data availability for developing countries overall is 15%, and even in 2000 when a special eff ort was made, it reached 44%. Most of these fi gures are predicted statistics that do not provide a reasonable basis for monitoring progress. The dilemma is that data systems and measurements are so weak that only undernutrition, child mortality, measles immunisation, and attended deliveries have eff ective measurement strategies in place. WHO, UNICEF, UNAIDS, and other agencies responsible for monitoring the MDGs rely on using predicted statistics for most other indicators so that attention on the MDGs does not fade. Predicted statistics are a reasonable approach for identifi cation of diffi culties and for stimulation of policy interest. However, the worldwide community is failing in implementation of viable measurement strategies for real monitoring.",

The analysis in table 1, including data availability for each indicator, is strictly based on the offi cial UN MDG website;12 there could well be other surveys and analyses that are not used for MDG monitoring. The 45 indicators in the table could probably be decreased to 16 that have high public-health importance and contribute unique information. For example, for a set of priority indicators, overall coverage of clean water is probably enough instead of urban and rural breakdowns. Arguably, urban and rural breakdowns do not provide a deep insight into diff erences in clean water inequalities across countries.
