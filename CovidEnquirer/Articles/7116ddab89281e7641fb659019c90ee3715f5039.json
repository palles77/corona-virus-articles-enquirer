A 56 growing body of evidence, however, indicates that the healthy airways have a resident 57 microbiota which can vary between individuals[5-7] and can alter significantly as a result of 58 respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis, COPD and asthma [8] . 59 60 A previous study of children with PBB using 16S rRNA gene sequencing suggested that the 61 bacterial communities present in their lungs demonstrated similarities to those seen in 62 children with cystic fibrosis (CF) and non-CF bronchiectasis [9] . This study provided a useful 63 insight into the bacterial community associated with PBB, although the control subjects were 64 undergoing bronchoscopy for clinical indications and could not be considered to be 65 healthy [9] [10] [11] . 66 67 .

This has given the opportunity for a better 70 understanding of the microbiota of the healthy airway in childhood, as well as insight into 71 how it is perturbed in children with PBB. In addition, the validity of characterising the lower 72 airways microbiome using blind brushings through an endotracheal tube as opposed to more 73 invasive bronchoscope guided sampling has been investigated. 74 75 76 .

Haemophilus and 193 Neisseria OTUs were identified as being significantly increased in patients with PBB (P < 194 0.001) (S3 Fig). This result was backed up using indicator species analysis between the PBB 195 and control communities. Two OTUs were significantly associated with the PBB group, 196 Haemophilus_3673 (P = 0.043) and Neisseria_4022 (P = 0.05). Haemophilus_3673 was a 197 member of the top 20 most abundant OTUs observed. The control group had 35 OTUs 198 significantly associated, 9 of which were included in the top 20 most abundant OTUs. 199 200 Comparing the results of standard clinical bacterial culture to the 16s rRNA gene sequencing 201 results for the 24 PBB patients, 20 (83.33%) were culture positive. The four patients that 202 were culture negative were, by sequencing, dominated either by Moraxella, Neisseria or 203 Haemophilus OTUs. Whilst no patient cultured Neisseria, 5 of the patients were found to be 204 dominated by a Neisseria OTU from the sequencing results. Seventeen (70.83%) of the 24 205 patients cultured Haemophilus influenzae, while only 9 (52.94%) of the same patients were 206 found to be Haemophilus dominated by sequencing. Moraxella was cultured from 3 patients, 207 in two of the three Moraxella was found to be the dominant organism by sequencing. Another 208 2 patients, however, were dominated by the Moraxella OTU despite not being positive on 209 culture for the bacterium. Only fifteen of the 24 patients (62.5%) cultured the dominant 210 organism that was identified by sequencing. 211 if wheeze explained any of the variation in the bacterial community observed 217 between patients, wheeze diagnosis was investigated. No significant difference was observed 218 between patients with and without wheeze (R 2 = 0.048, P = 0.34) (S4 Fig). No control 219 patients were diagnosed with wheeze. 220 221 PBB patients were tested for the presence of respiratory viruses. The presence of a virus (R 2 222 = 0.166, P = 0.167) or number of different viruses present (R 2 = 0.227, P = 0.095) in patients 223 had no significant effect on the bacterial community composition. None of the 6 respiratory 224 viruses showed any significant effect on the bacterial community composition, rhinovirus (R 2 225 = 0.057, P = 0.266), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (R 2 = 0.048, P = 0.406), Coronavirus 226 (R 2 = 0.027, P = 0.844), human metapneumovirus (HMP) (R 2 = 0.052, P = 0.314), 227 adenovirus (R 2 = 0.008, P = 0.99), parainfluenza (R 2 = 0.057, P = 0.259). 228 229Sampling of mothers, Throat swabs versus Nose swabs230Mothers of 16 children (11 PBB cases and 6 healthy controls) were sampled using both nose 231 and throat swabs. To investigate if these sampling methods were comparable, samples were 232 rarefied to 1,154 reads (4 samples were lost after rarefaction) after which non-metric 233 multidimensional scaling (NMDS) using Bray-Curtis distance was used to investigate 234 clustering based on bacterial community similarity (S5Fig).was observed between the two groups of samples nose versus throat swabs. 239There was however a significant difference in richness (Z = 2.58, P < 0.01) with throat swabs 240 having more distinct OTUs than nose swabs. Additionally, bacterial abundance as determined 241 by qPCR was significantly higher in throat swabs compared to nasal swabs (Z = 2.84, P < 242 0.01) (S6Fig).Analysis by ADONIS confirmed these results, with 11% of the variation 243 between samples being explained by the sample type (R 2 =0.11, P = 0community within the lung of children under the age of 2 years, both with 247 (N=11) and without a PBB diagnosis (N=5), was compared to the bacterial communities 248 present in the nose and throat of their mothers.

Lower bar plot indicates the log10 copies per \u00b5l as provides the first insight into the composition of the bacterial community present 278 within the lungs of both healthy infants and children and those with persistent bacterial 279bronchitis. Investigation into the bacterial community within the lungs of these children 280 highlights the impact of PBB on the lung microbiota and provides insight into range of pulmonary diseases, including COPD, non-CF bronchiectasis and cystic 284 fibrosis, a reduction in the diversity and the appearance of dominant OTUs from potentially 285 pathogenic genera has been observed[16][17][18][19][20]. It is perhaps unsurprising therefore, that in the 286 present study a significant reduction in bacterial diversity associated with PBB was observed. 287288In this present study, Haemophilus, Neisseria, Streptococcus and Moraxella were all 289 represented amongst the dominant OTUs in PBB samples, although DESeq2 and indicator 290 species analysis showed that only a Haemophilus and a Neisseria OTU were significantly 291 associated with PBB. This is likely to be due to the number of patients dominated in this 292 particular sample set(Fig 3). Importantly in many cases the dominant organisms by 293 sequencing were not those identified by culture, highlighting the potential limitations of 294 traditional culture techniques the results of which typically dictate therapeutic strategies. It 295 has been previously observed that conventional microbiology has the potential to miss the 296 presence of potentially pathogenic organisms[16, 21]. 297298Sequencing identified a Neisseria OTU as dominant in a number of subjects in this study yet 299 culture failed to identify Neisseria in any patients. This failure to recognize organisms in 300 chronic airways diseases may account in part for the 'negative' culture results from BAL and 301 that are frequently encountered in the presence of purulent secretions. This 302 may be of particular importance when it comes to Neisseria species, which are commonly 303 found to colonise the nasopharyngeal mucosa[22]. Despite many Neisseria species being 304 considered non-pathogenic, they have been implicated in cases of pneumonia[23differences in the bacterial community of PBB patients whose parents were 308 smokers compared to non-smokers were found. However, due to the low number of309 individuals in this study we cannot exclude smoking having an effect on the bacterial 310 communities of children. It would be important to expand this research to include a much 311 larger sample set to investigate this further. 312 313 Wheeze is a common symptom associated with PBB [25], however in this dataset it was only 314 diagnosed in a subset of children suffering from PBB and not in controls. No difference in 315 the bacterial community was associated with a diagnosis of wheeze however, this may due study nose and throat samples were collected from mothers of children under 2 years 319 old and compared with the results from the lower airways of their offspring. Nose swabs from 320 mothers were significantly different from their own throat swabs, showing that there are 321 major differences between these areas of the upper respiratory tract. Previous studies have 322 shown that unlike the nose the bacterial community from the throat is more similar to that of 323 the lower airways[11]. It was hypothesised that the bacterial community present in the 324 respiratory tract of mothers and children would therefore potentially share similarities, due to 325 their close proximity and shared environments when children are under 2 years of age. In the 326 , and these samples were found to be dominated by the same organism. 330 331 The inclusion of lower airway samples from healthy controls provides a challenge, 332 particularly in paediatric studies, due to the invasive nature of the sampling methods required 333 to access the lower respiratory tract. This has resulted in many paediatric studies either 334 sampling the upper respiratory tract [26] or including \"controls\" with other respiratory 335 indications [9, 11]. Hilty et al. observed a decrease in the Proteobacteria and an increase in 336Bacteroidetes in controls compared to asthmatics, although only 3 of their 7 controls had no 337 respiratory symptoms[11]. The current study demonstrates that the data generated from a 338 blind brushing via an ET tube is comparable to that obtained by visualization using 339 bronchoscopy, the so-called non-blind brush, allowing the inclusion of healthy children 340 attending the hospital for reasons unrelated to respiratory symptoms. 341 342 This has important implications for future studies of the lower airways microbiota, 343 particularly those involving infants and children, as a non-invasive method will allow greater 344 number of subjects to be studied and affords the opportunity of conducting , the bacterial community within the lungs of children with PBB shows a 349 significantly lower diversity than that observed in healthy children. This is due to the high 350 levels of dominance of Haemophilus, Neisseria, Streptococcus and Moraxella. In many cases 351 organisms by sequencing were not those identified by culture. This study is the 352 first step in using next generation sequencing methods to increase our understanding of the 353 bacterial community within the lungs of children with PBB.
