In the first experiment sheep and cattle were inoculated with T. lestoquardi sporozoites. Surviving animals and naive sheep and cattle were, in the second experiment, inoculated with T. annulata. In the third experiment, naive sheep and sheep previously infected with T. annulata, were inoculated with T. lestoquardi. The following responses to inoculations were monitored: clinical and haematological signs of infection, appearance of parasitic stages of the parasites in lymph node biopsies and in peripheral blood and serological response to T. lestoquardi and T. annulata schizont antigens. While T. lestoquardi readily infected sheep and caused severe disease, it did not infect cattle. On the other hand, T. annulata infected both cattle and sheep. However, whereas cattle became severely affected, infected sheep showed mild clinical symptoms only and piroplasms did not develop. Despite their different behaviour in the host species examined, cross-immunity studies suggested that the parasite species are very closely related. Experiments in sheep indicated that T. lestoquardi infection protected against subsequent T. annulata infection. On the other hand, recovery from T. annulata infection did not prevent infection by sporozoites of T. lestoquardi, resulting in the establishment of schizonts and their Veterinary Parasitology 82 (1999) 179\u00b1192 0304-4017/99/$ \u00b1 see front matter # 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

In their mammalian hosts, the parasites have a complex life cycle, with sporozoites transforming into schizonts in white blood cells of the mononuclear lineage, followed by the development of piroplasms in erythrocytes. Identification of the Theileria species and characterisation of parasite stocks are based on different criteria such as vector specificity, parasite morphology, host specificity and pathogenicity, serological cross-reaction as well as cross-protection to other species within the genus (Uilenberg, 1981; Irvin and Morrison, 1987; Morzaria, 1989) .",

All naive sheep that were inoculated with sporozoites of the Lahr stock of T. lestoquardi developed malignant ovine theileriosis. Generalised lymph node enlargement and high fever were the most prominent symptoms of the T. lestoquardi infection. Another consistent finding was a marked fall in WBC counts, often resulting in leukopenia that lasted for several days. Anaemia was also recorded in all sheep that survived for more than 3 weeks. Although individuals showed a rather wide variation in range and magnitude of other clinical symptoms, the first appearance of parasites was quite uniform in all sheep. Schizontinfected cells were first seen in lymph nodes draining the site of inoculation but were later also demonstrated in peripheral blood and in lymph nodes at the contra-lateral side. Like in other Theileria infections, T. lestoquardi-infected sheep remained carriers of piroplasms for more than 8 weeks.",

Sheep and cattle thus differ significantly in their susceptibility to infection with T. lestoquardi, and although the numbers of cattle tested were too low to fully exclude the possibility, our data indicate that cattle do not become infected with this parasite. An attempt to infect cattle with a parasite of sheep described as T. hirci has been reported earlier (Raghvachari and Madhava Krishna Reddy, 1959) . While sheep were successfully infected by mechanical transmission of blood, their attempt to infect a calf failed. Moreover, neither Brown et al. (1998) nor Kirvar et al. (1998) , were able to demonstrate T. lestoquardi infection in cattle inoculated with the same stock of the parasite as used here.",

Also, prepatent periods to detection of schizonts and of piroplasms as well as antibody responses to schizont antigens were the same in both groups of calves. The clinical, parasitological and haematological reactions observed here were in agreement with those reported for calves undergoing primary T. annulata infection (Gill et al., 1977; Pipano et al., 1981; Innes et al., 1989; Preston et al., 1992) .

Of particular interest is the fact that in none of these sheep were piroplasms ever observed, indicating that T. annulata is unable to complete its life cycle in sheep. However, piroplasms may have developed at levels too low to be detected by microscopical examination of peripheral blood and no attempts were carried out to analyse whether ticks applied onto T. annulata-infected sheep were able to pick up infection.",

Moreover, both schizonts and piroplasms were demonstrated in all challenged sheep, albeit in some of them at lower levels than in sheep undergoing primary T. lestoquardi infection. Although these parasites in theory could be either T. lestoquardi or T. annulata, the fact that piroplasms also developed, which were never seen during primary T. annulata infection of sheep, made it more likely that they were T. lestoquardi.
