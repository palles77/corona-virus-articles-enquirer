At the simplest level there is the question of defining what disease is. An all-embracing definition would be that disease is a departure from the normal physiological parameters of an organism. This could range from a temporary and very minor condition, such as a slightly raised temperature or lack of energy, to chronic pathologic conditions that eventually result in death. Any of these conditions may result from a tremendous number of internal or external sources. There is rarely one single factor that \"causes\" a disease; most disease states are multifactorial at some level.",

The course of any virus infection is determined by a delicate and dynamic balance between the host and the virus, as described in Chapter 6. The extent and severity of virus pathogenesis is determined similarly. In some virus infections, most of the pathologic symptoms observed are not directly caused by virus replication but are to the side effects of the immune response. Inflammation, fever, headaches, and skin rashes are not usually caused by viruses themselves but by the cells of the immune system due to the release of potent chemicals such as interferons and interleukins. In the most extreme cases, it is possible that none of the pathologic effects of certain diseases is caused directly by the virus, except that its presence stimulates activation of the immune system.",

It is sometimes said that viruses would disappear if they killed their hosts. This is not necessarily true. It is possible to imagine viruses with a hit-and-run strategy, moving quickly from one dying host to the next and relying on continuing circulation for their survival. Nevertheless, there is a clear tendency for viruses not to injure their hosts if possible. A good example of this is the rabies virus. The symptoms of human rabies virus infections are truly dreadful, but thankfully rare. In its normal hosts (e.g., foxes), rabies virus infection produces a much milder disease that does not usually kill the animal. Humans are an unnatural, dead-end host for this virus, and the severity of human rabies is as extreme as the condition is rare. Ideally, a virus would not even provoke an immune response from its host, or at least would be able to hide to avoid the effects. Herpesviruses and some retroviruses have evolved complex lifestyles that enable them to get close to this objective, remaining silent for much of the time. Of course, fatal infections such as rabies and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) always grab the headlines. Much less effort has been devoted to isolating and studying the many viruses that have not (yet) caused well-defined diseases in humans, domestic animals, or economically valuable crop plants.",

This molecule is a protease that cleaves the p220 component of eIF-4F, a complex of proteins required for cap-dependent translation of messenger RNAs by ribosomes. Because poliovirus RNA does not have a 5 0 methylated cap but is modified by the addition of the VPg protein, virus RNA continues to be translated.

Although the basic biology of HIV is well understood (see Further Reading at the end of this chapter), scientists have never had a complete understanding of the processes by which CD4 1 T-helper cells are depleted in HIV infection, and therefore have never been able to fully explain why HIV destroys the body's supply of these vital cells. to infection with the virus, and following infection these cells may produce many new copies of HIV before dying. One explanation for CD4 1 cell loss is the \"runaway\" hypothesis, in which CD4 1 cells infected by HIV produce more virus particles, which activate more CD4 1 cells that in turn become infected, leading to a positive feedback cycle of CD4 1 cell activation, infection, HIV production, and cell destruction. Unfortunately, mathematical models consisting of a series of equations to describe the processes by which CD4 1 cells are produced and eliminated suggest that if the \"runaway\" hypothesis was correct, then CD4 1 cells in HIV-infected individuals would fall to low levels over a few months, not over several years as usually happens. This implies that the \"runaway\" hypothesis cannot explain the slow pace of CD4 1 cell depletion in HIV infection. That leaves open the question of what exactly is going on between the time someone becomes infected with HIV and the time that they develop AIDS.

As a retrovirus, the biology of HIV, including integration of the virus genome into host-cell chromosomes, is a major problem in eradicating the virus from the body (see Chapter 3). In HIV-infected people receiving antiviral therapy there is a reservoir of latently infected resting CD4 1 T cells. Many HIV patients can manage their infection with a cocktails of antiretrovirus drugs which can reduce their \"viral load\"-the amount of virus circulating in the blood plasma-to undetectable levels. But even in such \"noninfectious\" patients HIV is still lurking in gut tissues, and still infecting other immune cells in the blood. Mathematical modeling and clinical observations suggest it might not ever be possible to completely eradicate the virus from the body with current therapies. The hope is that new approaches such as RNAi (see Chapter 6) might one day be able to tackle this latent virus pool and completely eliminate the virus from the body, curing the infection. Recent work has focused on the development of therapies to disrupt virus latency and expose the virus to replication-blocking drugs and to the immune response which exists in HIV-positive people. Even if this is possible, the cost of these advanced therapies would be beyond the reach of developing countries where the majority of HIV-infected people live. It may be that adaptation of HIV to replication in humans may eventually temper the pathogenicity of the virus by lowering its replication capacity. However, this process will be speeded up by antiviral therapies in many different forms, including genetic, drugs, and vaccines.",

Dengue fever is normally a self-limited illness from which patients recover after 7\u00c010 days without further complications. Following primary infections, patients carry antibodies to the virus. Unfortunately, there are four serotypes of dengue virus (DEN-1, 2, 3, and 4), and the presence of antibody directed against one type does not give cross-protection against the other three; worse still is the fact that antibodies can enhance the infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells by Fc-receptor-mediated uptake of antibody-coated dengue virus particles (see Chapter 4). In a few cases, the consequences of dengue virus infection are much more severe than the usual fever. Dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) is a life-threatening disease. In the most extreme cases, so much internal hemorrhaging occurs that hypovolemic shock (dengue shock syndrome or DSS) occurs. DSS is frequently fatal. The cause of shock in dengue and other hemorrhagic fevers is partly due to the virus, but largely due to immune-mediated damage of virus-infected cells (Figure 7 .3). DHF and DSS following primary dengue virus infections occur in approximately 1 in 14,000 and 1 in 500 patients, respectively; however, after secondary dengue virus infections, the incidence of DHF is 1 in 90 and DSS 1 in 50, as cross-reactive but nonneutralizing antibodies to the virus are now present. These figures show the problems of cross-infection with different serotypes of dengue virus, and the difficulties that must be faced in developing a safe vaccine against the virus. Dengue virus is discussed further later in this chapter (see \"New and Emergent Viruses\").",

This might be either the overexpression of an oncogene under the control of a virus promoter rather than its normal promoter in the cell, or it may be the inappropriate temporal expression of an oncoprotein that disrupts the cell cycle. Chronic transforming retrovirus genomes do not contain oncogenes. These viruses activate c-oncs by a mechanism known as insertional activation. A provirus that integrates into the host-cell genome close to a c-onc sequence may indirectly activate the expression of the gene in a way analogous to that in which v-oncs have been activated by transduction (Figure 7 .8). This can occur if the provirus is integrated upstream of the c-onc gene, which might be expressed via a read-through transcript of the virus genome plus downstream sequences; however, insertional activation can also occur when a provirus integrates downstream of a c-onc sequence or upstream but in an inverted orientation. In these cases, activation results from enhancer elements in the virus promoter (see Chapter 5). These can act even if the provirus integrates at a distance of several kilobases from the c-onc gene. Transformation by the third class of retroviruses operates by quite a different mechanism. Human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV) and related animal viruses encode a transcriptional activator protein in the virus tax gene. The Tax protein acts in trans to stimulate transcription from the virus long terminal repeat. It is believed that the protein also activates transcription of many cellular genes by interacting with transcription factors (Chapter 5); however, HTLV oncogenesis (i.e., the formation of a leukemic tumor) has a latent period of some 20\u00c030 years. Therefore, cell transformation (which can be mimicked in vitro) and tumor formation (which cannot) are not one and the same-additional events are required for the development of leukemia. It is thought that chromosomal abnormalities that may occur in the population of HTLV-transformed cells are also required to produce a malignant tumor, although because of the difficulties of studying this lengthy process this is not completely understood.",

Several families of DNA viruses are capable of transforming cells (Table 7 .3). In general terms, the functions of their oncoproteins are much less diverse than those encoded by retroviruses. They are mostly nuclear proteins involved in the control of DNA replication which directly affect the cell cycle. They achieve their effects by interacting with cellular proteins which normally appear to have a negative regulatory role in cell proliferation. Two of the most important cellular proteins involved are known as p53 and Rb. p53 was originally discovered by virtue of the fact that it forms complexes with SV40 T-antigen. It is now known that it also interacts with other DNA virus oncoproteins, including those of adenoviruses and papillomaviruses. The gene encoding p53 is mutated or altered in the majority of tumors, implying that loss of the normal gene product is associated with the emergence of malignantly transformed cells. Tumor cells, when injected with the native protein in vitro, show a decreased rate of cell division and decreased tumorigenicity in vivo. Transgenic mice that do not possess an intact p53 gene are developmentally normal but are susceptible to the formation of spontaneous tumors; therefore, it is clear that p53 plays a central role in controlling the cell cycle. It is believed to be a tumor suppressor or \"antioncogene\" and has been called the \"guardian of the genome.\" p53 is a transcription factor that activates the expression of certain cellular genes, notably WAF1, which encodes a protein that is an inhibitor of G1 cyclindependent kinases, causing the cell cycle to arrest at the G1 phase (Figure 7 .7).

However, in addition to transcription, T-antigen is also involved in genome replication. SV40 DNA replication is initiated by binding of large T-antigen to the origin region of the genome (Figure 5 .12).

            "text": "The immediate-early proteins of adenoviruses are analogous in many ways to SV40 T-antigen. E1A is a trans-acting transcriptional regulator of the adenovirus early genes (see Chapter 5). Like T-antigen, the E1A protein binds to Rb, inactivating the regulatory effect of this protein, permitting virus DNA replication, and accidentally stimulating cellular DNA replication. E1B binds p53 and reinforces the effects of E1A. The combined effect of the two proteins can be seen in the phenotype of cells transfected with DNA containing these genes (Table 7 .4). However, the interaction of these transforming proteins with the cell is more complex than simple induction of DNA synthesis. Expression of E1A alone causes cells to undergo apoptosis. Expression of E1A and E1B together overcomes this response and permits transformed cells to survive and grow. Human papillomavirus (HPV) genital infections are very common, occurring in more than 50% of young, sexually active adults, and are usually asymptomatic. Certain serotypes of HPV appear to be associated with a low risk of subsequent development of anogenital cancers such as cervical carcinoma, after an incubation period of several decades. 500,000 new cases of cervical neoplasia are diagnosed every year, making this one of the three most common causes of cancer death in women globally. HPV is a primary cause of cervical cancer; 93% of all cervical cancers test positive for one or more high-risk type of HPV. Of the 60 HPV types currently recognized, only four seem to be associated with a high risk of tumor formation 18, 31, and 45) . Once again, transformation is mediated by the early gene products of the virus. However, the transforming proteins appear to vary from one type of papillomavirus to another, as shown in Table 7 .3. In general terms, it appears that two or more early proteins often cooperate to give a transformed phenotype. Although some papillomaviruses can transform cells on their own (e.g., bovine papillomavirus 1, BPV-1), others appear to require the cooperation of an activated cellular oncogene (e.g., HPV-16/ras). In bovine papillomavirus, it is the E5 protein that is responsible for transformation. In HPV-16 and HPV-18, the E6 and E7 proteins are involved.",

During the first half of the twentieth century, the pattern of occurrence of poliomyelitis in Europe, North America, and Australia changed to an epidemic one, with vast annual outbreaks of infantile paralysis. Although we do not have samples of polioviruses from earlier centuries, the clinical symptoms of the disease give no reason to believe that the virus changed substantially. Why, then, did the pattern of disease change so dramatically? It is believed that the reason is as follows. In rural communities with primitive sanitation facilities, poliovirus circulated freely. Serological surveys in similar contemporary situations reveal that more than 90% of children of 3 years of age have antibodies to at least one of the three serotypes of poliovirus. (Even the most virulent strains of poliovirus cause 100\u00c0200 subclinical infections for each case of the paralytic poliomyelitis seen.) In such communities, infants experience subclinical immunizing infections while still protected by maternal antibodies-a form of natural vaccination. The relatively few cases of paralysis and death that do occur are likely to be overlooked, especially in view of high infant mortality rates. During the nineteenth century, industrialization and urbanization changed the pattern of poliovirus transmission.

Both of these viruses are maintained by direct person-toperson transmission and have no known alternative hosts; therefore, it has been suggested that it was not until human populations in China and the Roman Empire reached a critical density that these viruses were able to propagate in an epidemic pattern and cause recognizable outbreaks of disease. Before this time, the few cases that did occur could easily have been overlooked. Smallpox reached Europe from the Far East in 710 AD, and in the eighteenth century it achieved plague proportions-five reigning European monarchs died from smallpox. However, the worst effects occurred when these viruses were transmitted to the New World. Smallpox was (accidentally) transferred to the Americas by Hernando Cort\u00e9s in 1520. In the next two years, 3.5 million Aztecs died from the disease and the Aztec empire was decimated by disease rather than conquest. Although not as highly pathogenic as smallpox, epidemics of measles subsequently finished off the Aztec and Inca civilizations. More recently, the first contacts with isolated groups of Eskimos and tribes in New Guinea and South America have had similarly devastating results, although on a smaller scale. These historical incidents illustrate the way in which a known virus can suddenly cause illness and death on a catastrophic scale following a change in human behavior.",

Dengue fever is also primarily an urban disease of the tropics, transmitted by Aedes aegypti, a domestic, day-biting mosquito that prefers to feed on humans. Some outbreaks of dengue fever have involved more than a million cases, with attack rates of up to 90% of the population. There are believed to be over 40 million cases of dengue virus infection worldwide each year. This disease was first described in 1780. By 1906, it was known that the virus was transmitted by mosquitoes, and the virus was isolated in 1944; therefore, this is not a new virus, but the frequency of dengue virus infection has increased dramatically in the last 30 years due to changes in human activity.",

However, both of these approaches present considerable difficulties, the former in terms of avoiding environmental damage and the latter in terms of understanding virus pathogenesis and developing appropriate vaccines (see Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes and was first isolated in 1953 in Tanzania. CHIKV is a member of the genus Alphavirus and the family Togaviridae. The disease caused by this virus typically consists of an acute illness characterized by fever, rash, and incapacitating joint pain. The word chikungunya means \"to walk bent over\" in some east African languages and refers to the effect of the joint pains that characterize this denguelike infection. Chikungunya is a specifically tropical disease, but was previously geographically restricted and outbreaks were relatively uncommon. The virus remained largely unknown until a major outbreak in 2005 and 2006 on islands across the Indian Ocean. Plausible explanations for this outbreak (and subsequent spread, which has continued) include increased tourism, CHIKV introduction into a naive population, and virus mutation. It is the last of those three factors which seems to be most significant in this case, with the outbreak strain showing a single amino acid change in the envelope glycoprotein which allows more effective transmission due to more efficient crossing of the mosquito gut membrane barrier. There is every possibility that CHIKV will continue to extend its territory.",

In recent decades, this virus has been a major agricultural pest in Asia, the Americas, Europe, and Africa. Its rapid spread has been the result of dissemination of its insect vector (the thrip Frankinellia occidentalis) and diseased plant material. TSWV is the type species of the Tospovirus genus and has a morphology and genomic organization similar to the other bunyaviruses (Chapter 3). However, TSWV undergoes propagative transmission, and it has been suggested that it may have acquired an extra gene in the M segment via recombination, either from a plant or from another plant virus. This new gene encodes a movement protein (Chapter 6), conferring the capacity to infect plants and cause extensive damage.",

I HHV-7: First isolated from human CD4 1 cells in 1990. Its genome organization is similar to but distinct from that of HHV-6, and there is limited antigenic cross-reactivity between the two viruses. Currently, there is no clear evidence for the direct involvement of HHV-7 in any human disease, but might it be a cofactor in HHV-6-related syndromes. I HHV-8: In 1995, sequences of a unique herpesvirus were identified in DNA samples from AIDS patients with KS and in some non-KS tissue samples from AIDS patients. There is a strong correlation (.95%) with KS in both HIV 1 and HIV2 patients. HHV-8 can be isolated from lymphocytes and from tumor tissue and appears to have a less ubiquitous world distribution than other HHVs; that is, it may only be associated with a specific disease state (cf. HSV, EBV). However, the virus is not present in KS-derived cell lines, suggesting that autocrine or paracrine factors may be involved in the formation of KS.

Because of their complex transmission patterns involving multiple host species, arthropod-borne viruses are difficult to control, let alone to eradicate. earlier discussion of dengue virus pathogenesis). Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) was first isolated from sheep in 1930 but has caused repeated epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa during the last few decades, with human infection rates in epidemic areas as high as 35%. This is an epizootic disease, transmitted from sheep to humans by a number of different mosquitoes. The construction of dams which increase mosquito populations, increasing numbers of sheep, and the movement of sheep and human populations are believed to be responsible for the upsurge in this disease. RVFV continues to extend its range in Africa and the Middle East and is a significant health and economic burden in many areas of Africa, remaining a serious threat to other parts of the world.The Hantavirus genus (Bunyaviridae) is a particular cause for concern. Hantaviruses cause millions of cases of hemorrhagic fever each year in many parts of the world. Unlike arboviruses, hantaviruses are transmitted directly from rodent hosts to humans (e.g., via feces) rather than by an invertebrate host. Hantaviruses cause two acute diseases: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS). HFRS was first recognized in 1951 after an outbreak among U.S. troops stationed in Korea. In 1993, HPS was first recognized in the United States, and a new virus, Sin Nombre, was identified as the cause. It is now known that at least three different hantaviruses cause HFRS and four different viruses cause HPS. By 1995, HPS had been recognized in 102 patients in 21 states of the United States, in seven patients in Canada, and in three in Brazil, with an overall mortality rate of approximately 40%. These statistics illustrate the diseasecausing potential of emerging viruses.West Nile virus (WNV) is a member of the Japanese encephalitis antigenic complex of the family Flaviviridae. All known members of this complex are transmissible by mosquitoes, and many of them can cause febrile, sometimes fatal, illnesses in humans. WNV was first isolated in the West Nile district of Uganda in 1937 but is in fact the most widespread of the flaviviruses, with geographic distribution including Africa and Eurasia. Unexpectedly, an outbreak of human encephalitis caused by WNV occurred in the United States in New York and surrounding states in 1999. In this case, the virus appears to have been transmitted from wild, domestic, and exotic birds by Culex mosquitoes (an urban mosquito that flourishes under dry conditions)-a classic pattern of arbovirus transmission. WNV RNA has been detected in overwintering mosquitoes and in birds, and the disease is now endemic across the United States, causing outbreaks each summer. This rapid spread into a new territory shows that spread did not rely on environmental factors such as climate change-the North American environment was already suitable for the virus once it had been introduced, probably via air travel from the Middle East.",
