Although oseltamivir resistance rates vary from region to region, 16% of isolates tested globally were found to be oseltamivir resistant by a histidine to tyrosine mutation of residue 275 of the neuraminidase gene of influenza A. In order to implement effective resistance testing locally a novel real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assay was developed for the detection of the H275Y mutation. To evaluate this method, 40 oseltamivir resistant and 61 oseltamivir sensitive H1N1 influenza isolates were tested using Sanger sequencing, which is the reference method for detection of resistance, pyrosequencing and the novel H275Y RT-PCR assay. In comparison to Sanger sequencing, the sensitivity and specificity of the H275Y RT-PCR assay were 100% (40/40) and 100% (61/61) respectively, while the sensitivity and specificity of pyrosequencing were 100% (40/40) and 97.5% (60/61) respectively. Although all three methods were effective in detecting the H275Y mutation associated with oseltamivir resistance, the H275Y RT-PCR assay was the most rapid and could easily be incorporated into an influenza subtyping protocol.",

By the end of the 2007-2008 influenza season the resistance rate to oseltamivir was 16% globally. Countries with little or no previous oseltamivir resistance, such as the United States, Canada and Norway reported resistance rates of 10%, 26% and 67% respectively (World Health Organization, 2008) . Early data from the Southern Hemisphere for the 2008 influenza season suggested oseltamivir resistance rates among H1N1 isolates of as high as 100% (Besselaar et al., 2008) . In addition to reports of resistance in seasonal H1N1 isolates, reports of oseltamivir resistance have also emerged in patients infected with H5N1 avian influenza (de Jong et al., 2005; Kimm-Breschkin et al., 2007; Le et al., 2005) , bringing into question the use of this antiviral for pandemic influenza treat-ment and prophylaxis (Moscona, 2005; World Health Organization, 2005) . This emerging oseltamivir resistance has prompted laboratorians to look at time effective means to identify H1N1 influenza with the H275Y mutation.",

However, genotypic methods such as Sanger dideoxy sequence analysis of the NA gene can also be performed to detect mutations such as H275Y that are associated strongly with oseltamivir resistance. While both phenotypic and sequencing methods are effective in detecting resistance, they can be labour intensive, have a long turn-around-time and be quite expensive, suggesting the need for a rapid, high-throughput approach to influenza drug resistance testing. In this study we introduce the utilization of a novel real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) assay for detection of the histidine to tyrosine mutation at residue 275. This assay is designed to produce a sigmoidal curve when an isolate is oseltamivir susceptible and no curve when an isolate is oseltamivir resistant, thus serving as a quick screening tool that can be incorporated into the influenza subtyping protocol.",

            "text": "Current TaqMan technology utilizes a minor groove binder (MGB) that forms a stable complex with the minor groove of singlestranded DNA, increasing stability and specificity (Afonina et al., 1996; Uchiyama et al., 2004) . Due to these qualities MGB probes AAATGCACCCAAT Reisdorf et al. (2008) are characterized by a shorter length and a higher melting temperature (T m ). MGB-based probes are therefore highly applicable for detecting the presence of polymorphic sequences (Uchiyama et al., 2004) ; however their increased stability may result in false positives. Probe cross reactivity is therefore one reason that MGB chemistry is not generally used to detect point mutations. To avoid incorrect assignment of the H275Y point mutation an effort was made to reduce binding to oseltamivir-resistant isolates which have a C\u2192T point mutation by designing the MGB probe to detect wildtype sequence only. To limit cross reactivity of similar sequences, the MGB probe was designed so that the MGB was linked to the mutable base pair. This was accomplished by designing the probe so that the C\u2192T mutation was 6 bp from the 3 of the probe, which is the site of MGB linkage. This study compares the utility of the H275Y RT-PCR assay to Sanger sequencing, which is the current reference method for H275Y detection, as well as pyrosequencing, an emerging method for the detection of the H275Y point mutation (Duwe and Schweiger, 2008) . Specimens used in this study were from a population that was moderately resistant to oseltamivir, with resistance rates of 17% in Ontario isolates in 2007-2008.",

For example, an allelic-discrimination (SNP) assay to detect the H275Y mutation has been published by Carr et al. (2008) . The novel H275Y RT-PCR assay reported here compares favourably with the Carr assay, exhibiting parallel test characteristics, no cross reactivity and a similar TAT. However, since the H275Y RT-PCR assay requires only one probe while SNP assays by nature utilize two probes, the H275 RT-PCR assay has a lower cost per test and can be multiplexed easily into influenza detection algorithms that are real-time PCR based.",

In addition, compensatory mutations in other genes, such as the hemagglutinin gene (Abed et al., 2002) or in conserved genes would not be recognized using this method. However, since oseltamivir resistance is mediated currently by the H275Y mutation globally, with emerging resistance in many jurisdictions (World Health Organization, 2008), a rapid and cost efficient screen targeted at H275Y is the only method for high-throughput resistance testing of clinical specimens.",
