However, influenza virus infections are often under-diagnosed. In addition, influenza viruses co-circulate with other respiratory pathogens that also cause influenza-like illness, hence it is important to differentiate influenza from other respiratory diseases (Nicholson et al., 2003) . In addition to the opportunity to administer early antiviral treatment, when available, rapid diagnosis of viral respiratory infections is associated with more judicious antibiotic use, prevention of nosocomial spread, reduced length of hospital stay, and, ultimately, with reduced costs (Barenfanger et al., 2000; Cox and Subbarao, 1999; Woo et al., 1997) . For these reasons, the availability of a sensitive tool for the diagnosis of influenza virus is of the utmost importance in order to optimize clinical management, reduce the risk of spread to contacts, and exclude influenza-like pathogens, as well as for the surveillance of influenza viruses in communities which, in turn, is important to provide information concerning the circulating subtypes, including potential avian influenza viruses.",

Some of these disadvantages may be overcome by the use of carry over prevention systems, such as uracil-N-glycosylase (UNG), and one step RT-PCR kits. Both methods add further complexity to the operative steps, and cDNA preparation is more suitable for respiratory samples, often undergoing multiple amplification reactions for respiratory virus panels. The recent approach based on real time PCR may help solve most of these issues. However, it should be considered that the end point PCR is still used in many diagnostic laboratories, therefore the method described in this paper should be a valid option for detection of influenza viruses in both upper and lower respiratory tract clinical samples, substantially contributing to establish the etiology of lower respiratory tract diseases and of influenza-like illness, and to study the prevalence of respiratory viruses.",
