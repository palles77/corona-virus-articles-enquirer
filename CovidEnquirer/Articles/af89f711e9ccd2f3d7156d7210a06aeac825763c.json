            "text": "Background: In the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak, finding viral nucleic acids on hospital surfaces suggested surfaces could play a role in spread in health care environments. Surface disinfection may interrupt transmission, but few data exist on the effectiveness of health care germicides against coronaviruses on surfaces. Methods: The efficacy of health care germicides against 2 surrogate coronaviruses, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), was tested using the quantitative carrier method on stainless steel surfaces. Germicides were o-phenylphenol/ p-tertiary amylphenol) (a phenolic), 70% ethanol, 1:100 sodium hypochlorite, ortho-phthalaldehyde (OPA), instant hand sanitizer (62% ethanol), and hand sanitizing spray (71% ethanol). Results: After 1-minute contact time, for TGEV, there was a log 10 reduction factor of 3.2 for 70% ethanol, 2.0 for phenolic, 2.3 for OPA, 0.35 for 1:100 hypochlorite, 4.0 for 62% ethanol, and 3.5 for 71% ethanol. For MHV, log 10 reduction factors were 3.9 for 70% ethanol, 1.3 for phenolic, 1.7 for OPA, 0.62 for 1:100 hypochlorite, 2.7 for 62% ethanol, and 2.0 for 71% ethanol. Conclusion: Only ethanol reduced infectivity of the 2 coronaviruses by .3-log 10 after 1 minute. Germicides must be chosen carefully to ensure they are effective against viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.",

            "text": "Health care-associated infections are responsible for thousands of deaths worldwide each year. 1 Approximately 5% of all nosocomial infections are because of viral exposure, 2 and, in pediatric wards, viruses account for at least 30% of health care-associated infections. Studies have shown viruses to be common in health care environments and capable of surviving for extended periods of time on environmental surfaces. 3 In these settings, health care workers, medical devices, and environmental surfaces can act as both a reservoir for infection and a mode of transmission of infection to patients and staff. 4, 5 In 2003, the nosocomial transmission of viral disease proved to be a major contributor to a worldwide outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by a novel human coronavirus (CoV) (SARS-CoV). Outbreaks of SARS occurred in multiple health care facilities, infecting patients, staff, visitors, and volunteers. 6 SARS-CoV was also found on environmental surfaces in hospitals where outbreaks occurred, 7 and studies demonstrated that it could survive on surfaces for 24 to 72 hours. 8 Airborne transmission was the main route of spread; however, Rabenau et al 9 observed that ''there are a number of instances when transmission occurred through other means that are often still not well defined, '' and other studies of outbreak settings showed that providing handwashing facilities reduced transmission in hospitals, 10 suggesting that hands and surfaces could have played a role in transmission. The outbreak highlighted the need for effective and quick evaluation of means for controlling the spread of nosocomial infection. 11 Disinfection of hospital surfaces is an effective measure for reducing the risk of exposure for health care workers and patients; 12 appropriate disinfection of contaminated surfaces and equipment is crucial in interrupting the spread of viruses such as SARS-CoV. 8, [13] [14] [15] However, to assist in the selection of appropriate germicidal agents for use against coronaviruses on hospital surfaces and equipment, data are needed on the effectiveness of commonly used hospital germicides against coronaviruses. These data must accurately reflect disinfectant efficacy against viruses under the conditions in which they occur on surfaces, such as desiccation and embedding in proteinaceous matrices. Many previous disinfection studies have used liquid suspension methods for testing germicide efficacy. [16] [17] [18] These studies report greater efficacy against viruses than studies performed with carrier methods. Viruses may be more resistant on surfaces than in suspension because they can adsorb to the surface or become embedded in organic material 19 and may be more difficult to inactivate with chemical germicides than viruses suspended in liquid. Thus, it is possible that suspension tests overestimate the level of antimicrobial activity of germicides against viruses on surfaces. Carrier-based methods may more closely resemble real environmental conditions in which viruses contaminate surfaces and provide a more conservative estimate of germicide activity against viruses that are dried onto environmental surfaces.",

The germicides selected were 4 surface germicides and 2 hand sanitizers. Although hand sanitizers are not used for surface disinfection, the quantitative carrier test can help determine whether or not the active ingredients are effective against coronaviruses. Germicide evaluation was done using 2 non-human coronaviruses as surrogates for the Coronaviridae family and pathogenic human coronavirus such as SARS-CoV. The family Coronaviridae is divided into 3 groups. Groups I and II include human, mammalian, and avian coronaviruses, and group III consists of avian coronaviruses. Although SARS is thought to be related to the group 2 coronaviruses, 20 and phylogenetic analyses have indicated it may be closely related to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), 21 there is still disagreement about the exact placement of SARS-CoV within the coronavirus family. 22 Based on this uncertainty, 1 representative of each group of mammalian coronaviruses was included in the study to determine whether there was any difference in their survival and persistence in water. The 2 viruses included in the study were transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a diarrheal pathogen of swine and a member of the group I coronaviruses, and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a pathogen of laboratory mice and a member of the group II coronaviruses. 20 ",

Each experiment was performed in duplicate. Each carrier was placed in a 24-well plate, and 20 mL of virus suspension was applied. The virus was allowed to dry for 2 hours. After drying, 50 mL of use-dilution germicide was placed on the dried virus suspension on 3 test carriers, and 50 mL of cell culture medium was placed on 3 control carriers. After 1-minute contact time, 950 mL of neutralizing solution was added to the 3 test carriers to halt virucidal activity, and 950 mL of cell culture medium was added to the control carriers. To elute viruses from carriers, 150 mL of 15% beef extract (pH 7.5) was then added to all 6 carriers. Carriers were agitated on a shaking platform (60 rpm) for 20 minutes. The liquid from each well was then recovered, diluted, and assayed for virus infectivity as previously described. To determine the reduction in virus infectivity, the concentration of virus per 20-mL sample volume was calculated. Reduction in viral titer was calculated using difference in virus concentration between test carriers and control carriers. Log 10 reductions were calculated for each germicide based on 6 independent exposure trials.",

The efficacy of 6 hospital surface germicides was tested against 2 coronaviruses, MHV and TGEV, used as surrogates for SARS-CoV. These findings expand the available data on disinfection beyond what has been previously studied using other surrogates such as human coronavirus 229E. Although 229E shares some tissue tropism with SARS, there are important differences. Studies of SARS patients and outbreaks demonstrated that SARS-CoV is also a fecally shed virus, with intestinal tissue tropism; 229E lacks this. This may indicate important differences in resistance to environmental stressors because fecally shed viruses must be able to survive the conditions in the gastrointestinal tract, including extremes of pH, abundance of other microbes, and bile salts. This gastrointestinal tropism has played an important role in at least 1 major outbreak; this suggests that surrogates such as MHV (a virus with multiple tropisms) and TGEV (an enteric virus) that reflect this diversity in tissue tropism are necessary.",

For MHV, the 3 ethanol-based germicides (71%, 70%, and 62% ethanol) gave the greatest reduction in infectivity, with log 10 reduction factors ranging from 1.5 to 4.9. This was greater than the reductions observed with hypochlorite, phenolic, and orthophthalaldehyde based germicides. These same performance trends are evident in tests of these germicides against TGEV. The ethanol-based germicides gave log 10 infectivity reduction factors ranging from 2.9 to 4.6, greater than those observed for hypochlorite, phenolic, and orthophthalaldehyde germicides. The phenolic and orthophthalaldehyde germicides had greater virucidal activity against TGEV than against MHV. However, only the reductions in infectivity by orthophthalaldehyde were significantly different between MHV and TGEV. Statistical analysis indicates that mean log 10 viral reductions differed significantly based on both the type of germicide and the type of virus tested and that there are interaction effects between germicide and virus type. Hence, both the selection of germicide and the type of virus will influence the resultant magnitude of reduction of virus infectivity titer.",

These findings are consistent with previous studies of coronavirus disinfection, but this study provides more precise estimates of inactivation on surfaces than have been previously observed with other human coronaviruses, such as 229E. Some previous studies of chemical disinfection of 229E have been limited by cytotoxicity problems that limited the ability to measure infectious virus reduction. 25 Sattar et al 26 found that 70% ethanol reduced human coronavirus 229E dried onto a stainless steel surface by .99.9%. This study shows that the actual reduction is slightly greater than 3-log 10 (3.9 for TGEV and 3.19 for MHV). The available data on disinfection of SARS-CoV itself are not extensive, partly because of the challenges of working with SARS. Much of the available data focuses on alcohols. Seventy percent ethanol was found in 1 study to inactivate SARS by .3 log 10 . 27 Rabenau et al 9 reported a log 10 reduction factor of .5 after 30-second contact time using 78% ethanol and 70% propoanol, a reduction that was actually greater than what they observed with other germicides classified as chemical steriliants.

Previous studies of coronavirus disinfection have found higher reductions with concentrations of hypochlorite greater than the recommended usedilution, suggesting these results are consistent with a concentration-dependent effect. Sattar et al 26 reported 99.9% reduction of viral titer for human coronavirus 229E when 0.10% and 0.50% sodium hypochlorite solutions were tested with 1-minute contact times.

The results of this study suggest that the 1:100 use-dilution should not be recommended for use on surfaces with suspected contamination by coronaviruses. Hypochlorite is an important environmental surface disinfectant in health care; without the flammability and rapid evaporation of ethanol, it is suitable for large surface area spills. Increases in both sodium hypochlorite concentration and contact time should be evaluated to determine whether these factors would improve virucidal activity of hypochlorite on hard surfaces to achieve a .3-log 10 reduction performance target.",

A concentration of 600 mg/L on a surface produced a log 10 reduction factor ,1 of MHV and TGEV in this study. The poor performance of hypochlorite against viruses dried into surfaces may be due to the high oxidant demand exerted by the proteinaceous cell culture medium matrix in which the viruses were suspended. This results in consumption of available hypochlorite by the proteins and other organic compounds (eg, amino acids) present in the matrix, rendering it unavailable for disinfection. Use of viruses suspended in a proteinaceous matrix simulates the real world conditions under which viruses shed by human hosts occur in health care environments. Viruses are not shed by an infected host as single purified particles; they occur as aggregates, surrounded by membranes and embedded in feces, mucus, and other proteinaceous matrices. Together, these results suggest that changing the recommended use-dilution of hypochlorite may address the problem of oxidant demand exerted by proteinaceous material such as body fluids and result in effective inactivation of coronaviruses shed from human hosts.",

This suggests that MHV is potentially a more conservative surrogate for evaluating disinfectant efficacy against SARS-CoV. These studies should be replicated using SARS-CoV to determine which surrogate virus is a more suitable model for the response of SARS to these germicides. There is still an important role to be played by surrogate viruses, especially for the evaluation of new disinfectants or the re-evaluation of use of current disinfectants (such as changes in dose and contact time); the available data suggest that both TGEV and MHV may serve as conservative surrogates for modeling control of SARS-CoV by health care germicides in worst case scenarios.",
