Computer analysis of the protein sequence revealed the characteristics of a class Ill membrane protein lacking a cleaved signal sequence but containing three successive transmembrane a-helices in the N-terminal half, much the same as the coronavirus membrane (M) protein. The disposition of the E protein in the membrane was studied by in vitro translation in the presence of microsomes and by subsequent proteinase K digestion. Only small portions of either end of the polypeptide were found to be exposed on opposite sides of the vesicle membranes. Experiments with a hybrid E protein (EM) containing the C-terminal tail of a coronavirus M protein, to which an anti-peptide serum was available, showed that this C-terminus was present at the cytoplasmic side of the membrane, which is another similarity to the coronavirus M protein. lmmunofluorescence experiments indicated that the EM protein, expressed by a recombinant vaccinia virus, accumulated in intracellular membranes, predominantly those of the endoplasmic reticulum. The common features of the torovirus E and the coronavirus M protein support our hypothesis that an evolutionary relationship exists between these groups of intracellularly budding viruses. o 1991 Academic PWSS, h.",

The replication strategy of the virus involves the generation of a 3'-coterminal nested set of four subgenomic mRNAs to express the viral structural genes (Snijder et a/., 1990a) . Apart from the smallest mRNA, which is monocistronic, the subgenomic mRNAs are structurally polycistronic but only their respective 5'terminal open reading frames are trans-lated (Snijder et a/., 1988) . By these characteristics the expression of the BEV genome is very similar to the mechanism used by coronaviruses (Spaan et a/., 1988) . In addition, a clear but distant ancestral relationship between the polymerase genes of both virus groups has been established (Snijder et a/., 199Oc) .",

Three putative membrane-associated proteins with M, of 75-lOOK, 37K, and 22K have been described (Horzinek et al., 1985) . Of these, the 75-l OOK moiety represents the N-glycosylated peplomer (P) protein which constitutes the BEV surface projections (Snijder et a/., 1990b) . The virus specificity of the 37K protein has become questionable since a corresponding gene has not been identified in the 3' part of the viral genome where the information for the structural proteins is clustered (Snijder et a/., 1990a) .",

This analysis is based on the calculation of the free energy cost of burying successive stretches of amino acid residues into a membrane. Using a 21 -residue moving window the pattern of Fig. 3A was generated. The plot shows a striking resemblance with the ones obtained earlier for the small envelope glycoprotein of several coronaviruses (e.g., Boursnell et al., Fig. 3B . Like the M protein, the predicted BEV polypeptide is generally rather hydrophobic except for its hydrophilic N-terminus. These features are indicative of a membrane protein with an internal signal sequence which may be present in the region between residues 30 and 115, where the plot in Fig. 3A suggests 3 membrane-spanning domains. Interestingly, as in most coronavirus M proteins a so-called surface helix is predicted immediately adjacent to the presumed third transmembrane domain. According to the method described by Eisenberg et al, (1984) residues 1 15 through 128 adopt this structure (values of mean hydrophobicity and mean hydrophobic moment approx. 0.1 and 0.65, respectively). Notably, this is the only region where the sequences of the BEV E protein and the coronavirus M proteins show similarity. As illustrated in Fig. 4 this is most obvious when comparing with MHV and bovine coronavirus (9 identities and 2 conserving substitutions within the 13-residue boxed domain). For the rest of the molecule the similarity was low and even strikingly absent in the region immediately C-terminal to the predicted surface helix. This is surprising since this domain has been extremely well conserved among coronaviral M proteins: except for the human coronavirus (HCV 229E) a stretch of 9 residues is essentially identical in all sequences known to date (Fig. 4) . With the exception of the small motif described above, no significant sequence similarities between the BEV E protein and other proteins (including the entries in the NBRF protein database) were detected.",

When the digestion was done after membrane permeabilization with saponin an additional fragment of approximately 1.3K was removed (lane 5). These results indicate that the two termini of the protein end up at opposite sides of the membrane, are exposed, and can be removed whereby a 18.4K protease-resistant polypeptide is left. When the proteinase K digestion was carried out after solubilization of the lipids with Triton X-100 a fragment of about 12.7K unexpectedly survived the treatment (lane 6). A resistant fragment of similar size was obtained when the translation had been done in the absence of microsomal membranes (lane 7) suggesting that part of the E protein is folded into a protease-resistant conformation also in the absence of membrane integration. Another important observation in this experiment was that translation of the pBSE1 RNA yielded the same product in the presence and in the absence of membranes (cf. lanes 2 and 3) . Therefore, no cleavage of a signal sequence seems to occur upon integration of the E protein in the lipid bilayer.",

Viral membrane proteins are considered to be important determinants in localizing the budding of enveloped viruses. Therefore, it was of interest to examine the E protein's intracellular transport. As we did not succeed in obtaining an antiserum to the protein suitable for use in immunofluorescence, we decided to exploit the hybrid EM protein described above, which contains a coronaviral tail. Recombinant vaccinia virus vEM was generated to express the EM protein in COS cells. Its correct expression was confirmed by immunoprecipitation using the MHV M specific anti-peptide serum (data not shown). The location of the EM protein was studied by indirect immunofluorescence on permeabilized COS cells expressing the protein and was compared to that of the MHV-A59 M protein which has been shown to accumulate in the Golgi apparatus in these cells (Rottier and Rose, 1987) . As shown in Fig. 6A the EM protein was localized intracellularly. Prominent reticular staining extending from the perinuclear region throughout the cell was observed. Also the nuclear membrane stained positive. The intracellular perinuclear staining remained stable even after incubating the cells for several hours in the presence of cycloheximide before analysis (data not shown). The more polarized fluorescence seen in vMinfected cells (Fig. 6B) is clearly different and typical for the localization of the MHV M protein in the Golgi complex. The faint staining over the nucleus is nonspecific as is clear from the control (Fig. SC) .",

Consequently, in virions the N-terminus will be exposed at the outside while the C-terminus will be buried inside the particle. The BEV E protein is not Nglycosylated upon in viva (data not shown) or in vitro expression, which can now be explained by its topology in the membrane: the only potential N-glycosylation site (amino acid position 208) is oriented towards the cytoplasm.",

The Golgi system was described as the most prominent site of budding but virus particles were also found to bud into non-Golgi smooth membranes and, at late stages of infection, even into the ER and the perinuclear space . We assume that the toroviral envelope proteins (E and P) play an important role in virus assembly. This implies that their intracellular localization may very well determine the budding site. Unfortunately we were unable to study the intracellular transport of the E protein itself due to a lack of suitable antibodies. We therefore constructed the EM hybrid protein assuming that the replacement of the cytoplasmic tail of the E protein by the corresponding tail of a similar coronavirus protein would not affect transport. Indeed, the available data do not indicate a role in targeting for the C-terminus of the M protein. for instance, replacing the cytoplasmic tail of the vesicular stomatitis virus G protein by that of the coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus M protein did not alter the cell surface expression of the resulting mutant G protein (Puddington et al., 1987) . Moreover, we have recently shown that deletion of the C-terminus from the MHV M protein does not alter its membrane topogenesis or its accumulation in the Golgi system (P. J. M. Rottier and 1. Krijnse Locker, unpublished observations).",

There was no indication of any accumulation in the Golgi apparatus. Apparently, the protein is not targeted to the major site of torovirus budding. Again, this is reminiscent of coronaviruses: whereas MHV is known to bud into pre-Golgi smooth membranes, the viral M protein when expressed from cloned cDNA accumulates in the Golgi complex (Rottier and Rose, 1987) . We interpret these data to indicate that in infected cells the envelope proteins interact with each other and possibly also with other viral factors resulting in their accumulation at the site where budding occurs.",
