Havlin (1989) points out that the cross-over value may be determined by r c 2 $ t c . Above the characteristic length, r c , the self-similarity of the surface is lost and the surface may be considered homogeneous. Above time, t c the surface may be considered homogeneous, since the self-similarity property disappears, and \"regular\" diffusion is now present. For a homogeneous surface where D f is equal to 2, and when only diffusional limitations are present, p \u00bc \u00bd as it should be. Another way of looking at the p \u00bc \u00bd case (where D f,bind is equal to two) is that the analyte in solution views the fractal object, in our case, the receptor-coated biosensor surface, from a \"large distance.\" In essence, in the association process, the diffusion of the analyte from the solution to the receptor surface creates a depletion layer of width (\u00d0t) \u00bd where \u00d0 is the diffusion constant. This gives rise to the fractal power law, \u00f0Analyte \u00c1 Receptor\u00de $ t \u00f03\u00c0D f, bind \u00de=2 . For the present analysis, t c is arbitrarily chosen and we assume that the value of the t c is not reached. One may consider the approach as an intermediate \"heuristic\" approach that may be used in the future to develop an autonomous (and not time-dependent) model for diffusion-controlled kinetics.",

This is just one possible method of analyzing the kinetics of the different analyte-recptor (hybridization reactions) presented in this chapter. Alternative expressions for fitting the data are available that include saturation, first-order reaction, and no diffusion limitations, but these expressions are apparently deficient in describing the heterogeneity that inherently exists on the surface. One might justifiably argue that the appropriate modeling may be achieved by using a Langmuirian or other approach. The Langmuirian approach may be used to model the data presented if one assumes the presence of discrete classes of sites (for example, double exponential analysis as compared with a single-fractal analysis). Lee and Lee (1995) report that the fractal approach has been applied to surface science, for example, adsorption and reaction processes. These authors point out that the fractal approach provides a convenient means to represent the different structures and the morphology at the reaction surface. They also draw attention to the use of the fractal approach to develop optimal structures and as a predictive approach. Another advantage of the fractal technique is that the analyte-receptor association (as well as the dissociation reaction) is a complex reaction, and the fractal analysis via the fractal dimension and the rate coefficient provides a useful lumped parameter(s) analysis of the diffusion-limited reaction occurring on a heterogeneous surface.",

            "text": "There is no nonselective adsorption of the analyte. The present system being analyzed may be typically very dilute. Nonselective adsorption would skew the results obtained very significantly. In these types of systems, it is imperative to minimize this nonselective adsorption. It is also recognized that, in some cases, this nonselective adsorption may not be a significant component of the adsorbed material and that this rate of association, which is of a temporal nature, would depend on surface availability. If the nonselective adsorption were to be accommodated into the model, there would be an increase in the heterogeneity on the surface, as, by its very nature, nonspecific adsorption is more homogeneous than specific adsorption. This would lead to higher fractal dimension values since the fractal dimension is a direct measure of the degree of heterogeneity that exists on the surface. Fiche et al. (2007) recently analyzed hybridization experiments on a DNA chip using surface plasmon resonance imaging (SPRi). These authors point out that to obtain quantitative results it is essential to clarify the heterogeneity of the hybridization of DNA on microarrays. The aim of their experiment was to obtain a detailed account of the equilibrium and kinetics of hybridization on a DNA chip. They point out that experimental results on a DNA chip are commonly analyzed using the Langmuir model (Peterson et al., 2002; Hekstra et al., 2003; Tawa and Knoll, 2004; Yu et al., 2004; Wark et al., 2005; Yao et al., 2005) . In most of the above mentioned studies the heterogeneity of the hybridization is generally not taken into account. Furthermore, Fiche et al. (2007) explain that as most of the experiments are done at room temperature effects on the equilibrium and kinetics properties are not taken into account. Thus, these authors analyzed temperature effects on DNA experiments. Fiche et al. (2007) performed hybridization experiments at different temperatures and target concentrations. All their probes had at their 5 0 end a 10-thyminespacer and a pyrrole (Py) moiety for the electropolymerization grafting method. Figure 11 .1a shows the binding and dissociation of the target T1 to the probe P14 (5 0 -Py-(T 10 )-GCC.TGG.ACG.ATA.CA-3 0 ) immobilized on the DNA chip. 14 refers to the number of hybridizing bases. A dual-fractal analysis is required to adequately describe the binding kinetics. A single-fractal analysis is adequate to describe the dissociation kinetics. The values of (a) the binding rate coefficient, k, and the fractal dimension, D f , for a single-fractal analysis, (b) the binding rate coefficients, k 1 and k 2 , and the fractal dimensions, D f1 and D f2 , for a dual-fractal analysis, and the dissociation rate coefficient, k d and the fractal dimension for dissociation, D fd are given in Table 11 .1. The values of the binding and the dissociation rate coefficients, and the fractal dimensions for the binding and the dissociation phase presented in Table 11 .1 were obtained from a regression analysis (Fiche et al., 2007) .",

            "text": "Also note that for the binding in the nonmatching (noncomplementary) case a single-fractal analysis is adequate to describe the binding kinetics. However, for the matching (complementary) case a dual-fractal analysis is required to describe the binding kinetics. This would indicate that, at least for this case, the binding of the matching (complementary) case is more complicated than that of the nonmatching (noncomplementary) case. No explanation is offered, at present, to help explain why this is the case. mer strand (bound DNA) immobilized via a phenylene-diisocyanate linker molecule on a glass substrate (Michel et al.,2007) . When only a solid line (--) is used then a single-fractal analysis applies. When both a dashed (---) and a solid (--) line are used then the dashed line represents a single-fractal analysis and the solid line represents a dual-fractal analysis. Figure 11 .7a shows the binding of SA-HRP and DAB in solution to the capture probe modified QCM electrode along with 1 mM detection probe. A dual-fractal analysis is required to adequately describe the binding kinetics. The values of (a) the binding rate coefficient, k, and the fractal dimension, D f , for a single-fractal analysis, and (b) the binding rate coefficients, k 1 and k 2 and the fractal dimensions, D f1 and D f2 , for a dual-fractal analysis are given in Tables 11.4 and 11.5. It is of interest to note that for a dual-fractal analysis as the fractal dimension increases by a factor of 3.51 from a value of D f1 equal to 0.7886 to D f2 equal to 2.7684, the binding rate coefficient increases by a factor of 41.96 from a value of k 1 equal to 1.0132 to k 2 equal to 42.513. Abad-Valle et al. (2007a,b) recently used an electrochemical enzymatic genosensor to analyze DNA single-base mismatches. These authors report that electrochemical transducers provide rapid and sensitive measurements. Besides, these devices are simple low cost, and exhibit the potential to be miniaturized. Abad-Valle et al. (2005) further explain that enzyme labels, due to their inherent amplification help permit an increase in assay sensitivity. Caruana and Heller (1999) .7 Binding (hybridization) of SA-HRP (streptavidin horseradish peroxidase) in solution to a capture probe on a QCM (quartz crystal microbalance) electrode along with a detection probe (Feng et al., 2007) . When only a solid line (--) is used then a single-fractal analysis applies. When both a dashed (---) and a solid (--) line are used then the dashed line represents a single-fractal analysis and the solid line represents a dual-fractal analysis. The values of the binding rate coefficient, k, and the fractal dimension, D f , for a single-fractal analysis are given in Tables 11.4 and 11.5. It is of interest to note that as one goes from the binding of the complementary DNA to the three base-mismatch strand in solution to the 30-mer 3 0 -thiolated DNA strand immobilized on the electrochemical genosensor, the fractal dimension increases by a factor of 1.427 from a value of D f equals to 1.9290 to 2.7520, and the binding rate coefficient, k increases by a factor of 3.353 from a value of k equal to 7.0291 to k equal to 23.569. Increases in the degree of heterogeneity or the fractal dimension on the sensor chip surface and in the binding rate coefficient are in the same direction. Wang et al. (2007) recently analyzed the binding of complementary ODN (ODN-P) (2-diolgonucleotide) and a noncomplementary ODN-N (nonmatching) to an electrochemical sensor with a EST2-A34 reporter. These authors used esterase 2-oligonucleotide conjugate as a sensitive reporter for the electrochemical detection of nucleic acid hybridization. Figure 11 .9a shows the binding of p-aminophenylbutyrate/esterase 2 from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius plus oligonucleotide (ODN) in solution to a site-specific manner ODN-P (perfectly matched; complementary) immobilized on an electrochemical biosensor surface. A dual-fractal analysis is required to adequately describe the binding kinetics. A single-fractal analysis is required to adequately describe the dissociation kinetics. The values of (a) the binding rate coefficient, k, and the fractal dimension, D f , for a single-fractal analysis, (b) the binding rate coefficients, k 1 and k 2 , and the fractal dimensions, D f1 and D f2 , for a dual-fractal analysis, and (c) the dissociation rate coefficient, k d , and the fractal dimension, D fd , for a single-fractal analysis are given in Tables 11.4 and 11.5. It is of interest to note that for a dual-fractal analysis, as the fractal dimension increases by a factor of 5.766 from a value of D f1 equal 0.4432 to D f2 equal to 2.556, the binding rate coefficient increases by a factor of 13.25 from a value of k 1 equal to 2.8403 to k 2 equal to 37.626. Increases in the degree of heterogeneity or the fractal dimension on the electrochemical biosensor surface and in the binding rate coefficient are in the same direction. Figure 11 .9b shows the binding of p-aminophenylbutyrate/esterase 2 from Alicyclobacillus acidocaldarius plus ODN in solution to a site-specific manner ODN-N (mismatch; noncomplementary) immobilized on an electrochemical biosensor surface. In this case, a triplefractal analysis is required to adequately describe the binding kinetics. The values of (a) the binding rate coefficient, k, and the fractal dimension, D f , for a single-fractal analysis, (b) the binding rate coefficients, k 1 and k 2 , and the fractal dimensions, D f1 and D f2 , for a dualfractal analysis, and (c) the binding rate coefficients, k 1 , k 2 , and k 3 , and the fractal dimensions, D f1 , D f2 and D f3 , for a triple-fractal analysis are given in Tables 11.4 and 11.5. The binding kinetics is a bit more complicated in this case (ODN-N; noncomplementary) when compared to the complementary (ODN-P) case, as for the ODN-N case a triple-fractal analysis is required to adequately describe the binding kinetics whereas for the complementary (ODN-P) case a dual-fractal analysis is adequate to describe the binding kinetics. It is of interest to note that for a triple-fractal analysis, as the fractal dimension increases by a factor of 1.358 from a value of D f2 equal 1.78902 to D f3 equal to 2.4304, the binding rate coefficient increases by a factor of 3.03 from a value of k 2 equal to 1.5596 to k 3 equal to 4.7240. Increases in the degree of heterogeneity or the fractal dimension on the electrochemical biosensor surface and in the binding rate coefficient are once again in the same direction. Uno et al. (2007) recently developed a peptide-nucleic acid (PNA)-modified IS-FET-based biosensor that they have used for the direct detection of DNA hybridization. These authors report that their IS-FET based biosensor uses the change in the surface potential on the hybridization of a negatively charged DNA. They explain that the use of PNA in their system permits the highly specific and selective binding at low ionic strength. Uno et al. (2007) point out that IS-FET based biological sensors are attractive in the sense that they are of small size and weight, provide a fast response, are portable, can be mass produced at a low cost, and are highly reliable. They further report that IS-FET-based DNA sensors have exhibited potential in clinical and research applications. Uno et al. (2007) report that the IS-FET can detect surface potential changes due to the surface adsorption of charged molecules in an aqueous environment (Souteyrand et al., 1997; Berney et al., 2000; Frits et al., 2002; Kim et al., 2004; Li et al., 2004) . Uno et al. (2004) and Ohtake et al. (2004) have shown that the hybridization of an immobilized PNA with a complementary DNA induces a decrease in the saturation current and a positive shift in the threshold voltage. Figure 11 .10a shows the binding of 5 mM target DNA2 (complementary to CYP2C9*2) in solution to CYP2C9*2 used as a probe and immobilized on a SPR biosensor surface (Uno et al., 2007) . This permitted these authors to analyze the molecular recognition at the solution-surface interface. A single-fractal analysis is adequate to describe the binding and the dissociation kinetics. The values of (a) the binding rate coefficient, k, and the fractal dimension, D f , for a single-fractal analysis, and (b) the dissociation rate coefficient, k d , and the fractal dimension, D fd , for a single-fractal analysis are given in Table 11 .6(a) and (b). In this case, the affinity, K (\u00bck/k d ) value is 30,347.2 (an extremely high value). Figure 11 .10b shows the binding of 5 mM target DNA with a single base mismatch 2 (complementary to CYP2C9*2) in solution to CYP2C9*2 used as a probe and immobilized on a SPR biosensor surface (Uno et al., 2007) . A single-fractal analysis is once again adequate to describe the binding and the dissociation kinetics. The values of (a) the binding rate coefficient, k, and the fractal dimension, D f , for a single-fractal analysis, and (b) the dissociation rate coefficient, k d , and the fractal dimension, D fd , for a single-fractal analysis are given in Table 11 .6(a) and (b). In this case, the affinity, K (\u00bck/k d ), value is 229.54. It is of interest to note that as the fractal dimension decreases by 2.26% from a value of D f equal to 2.6306 to 2.5712 the binding rate coefficient, k also decreases by 56.3% from a value of k equal to 131.10 to 57.253. Note that changes in the binding rate coefficient, k, and the fractal dimension, D f , or the degree of heterogeneity on the sensor surface are in the same direction. Figure 11 .10c shows the binding of 5 mM target complementary DNA (complementary to CYP2C9*2) in solution to CYP2C9*2 used as a probe with a single mismatch (CYP2C9*1) and immobilized on a SPR biosensor surface (Uno et al., 2007) . A single-fractal analysis is once again adequate to describe the binding and the dissociation kinetics. The values of (a) the binding rate coefficient, k, and the fractal dimension, D f , for a single-fractal analysis, and (b) the dissociation rate coefficient, k d , and the fractal dimension, D fd , for a single-fractal analysis are given in Table 11 .6(a) and (b). In this case, the affinity, K (\u00bck/k d ), value is 3.954. Figure 11 .11a and Table 11 .6(a) and (b) show the increase in the binding rate coefficient, k, with an increase in the fractal dimension, D f , for a single-fractal analysis. For the data shown in Figure 11 .11a and Table 11 .6(a) and (b), the binding rate coefficient, k, is given by:",

The fit is reasonable. Only three data points are available. The availability of more data points would lead to a more reliable fit. Only the positive error is shown in Equation (11.5c), since the error is large, and the affinity can only have positive values. The affinity, K, exhibits an order of dependence between one and a half and two (equal to 1.746) on the ratio of fractal dimensions, (D f /D fd ), present on the sensor chip surface. Uno et al. (2007) analyzed the SPR biosensor responses to PNA-DNA hybridization. These authors used CYP2C9*2 as the probe PNA and the target DNA was complementary CYP2C9*2 (target DNA2). They used target DNA concentrations in the 0.1-5.0 mM range. Figure 11 .12a shows the binding and the dissociation of 5 mM target DNA concentration in solution to the probe PNA immobilized on the sensor surface. A dual-fractal analysis is required to adequately describe the binding kinetics. A single-fractal analysis is adequate to describe the dissociation kinetics. The values of (a) the binding rate coefficient, k, and the fractal dimension, D f , for a single-fractal analysis, (b) the binding rate coefficients, k 1 and k 2 , and the fractal dimensions, D f1 and D f2 , for a dual-fractal analysis, and (c) the dissociation rate coefficient, k d , and the fractal dimension, D fd , for the dissociation phase for a single-fractal analysis are given in Tables 11.7 and 11.8. Note that for a dual-fractal analysis, as the fractal dimension increases by 38.9% from a value of D f1 equal to 2.1140 to D f2 equal to 2.9360, the binding rate coefficient increases by a factor of 6.40 from a value of k 1 equal to 43.465 to k 2 equal to 278.35. Note that changes in the fractal dimension or the degree of heterogeneity on the sensor chip surface and in the binding rate coefficient are in the same direction. k 1 and k 2 , and the fractal dimensions, D f1 and D f2 , for a dual-fractal analysis, and (c) the dissociation rate coefficient, k d , and the fractal dimension, D fd , for the dissociation phase for a singlefractal analysis are given in Tables 11.7 and 11.8. Note that for a dual-fractal analysis, as the fractal dimension increases by 26.4% from a value of D f1 equal to 2.2890 to D f2 equal to 2.8933, the binding rate coefficient increases by a factor of 4.58 from a value of k 1 equal to 49.086 to k 2 equal to 225.0. Note that changes in the fractal dimension or the degree of heterogeneity on the sensor chip surface and in the binding rate coefficient are once again in the same direction. Figure 11 .12c shows the binding and the dissociation of 1 mM target DNA concentration in solution to the probe PNA immobilized on the sensor surface. Once again, a dual-fractal analysis is required to adequately describe the binding kinetics. A single-fractal analysis is adequate to describe the dissociation kinetics. The values of (a) the binding rate coefficient, k, and the fractal dimension, D f , for a single-fractal analysis, (b) the binding rate coefficients, k 1 and k 2 , and the fractal dimensions, D f1 and D f2 , for a dual-fractal analysis, and (c) the dissociation rate coefficient, k d , and the fractal dimension, D fd , for the dissociation phase for a single-fractal analysis are given in Tables 11.7 and 11.8. Note that for a dual-fractal analysis, as the fractal dimension increases by a factor of 2.076 from a value of D f1 equal to 1.2392 to D f2 equal to 2.5728, the binding rate coefficient increases by a factor of 8.80 from a value of Table 11 .8: Fractal dimensions for the binding and the dissociation phases for the different target complementary DNA concentrations (in mM) in solution to a DNA probe, CYP29*2 immobilized on an ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (ISFET)-based biosensor (Uno et al., 2007) . Table 11 .7: Binding and dissociation rate coefficients for different target complementary DNA concentrations (in mM) in solution to a DNA probe, CYP29*2 immobilized on an ion-sensitive field-effect transistor (IS-FET)-based biosensor (Uno et al., 2007) . k 1 equal to 8.427 to k 2 equal to 74.183. It is seen that changes in the fractal dimension or the degree of heterogeneity on the sensor chip surface and in the binding rate coefficient are once again in the same direction. Figure 11 .12d shows the binding and dissociation of 0.1 mM target DNA concentration in solution to the probe PNA immobilized on the sensor surface. A single-fractal analysis is adequate to describe the binding and the dissociation kinetics. The values of (a) the binding rate coefficient, k, and the fractal dimension, D f , for a single-fractal analysis, and (b) the dissociation rate coefficient, k d , and the fractal dimension, D fd , for a single-fractal analysis are given in Tables 11.7 and 11.8. In this case, the affinity, K (\u00bck/k d ), is given by 1.046. No reason is given at present as to why at this lowest DNA target concentration (0.1 mM) in solution a single-fractal analysis is adequate to describe the binding kinetics, whereas at the higher DNA concentration in solution in the 1.0-5.0 mM range, a dual-fractal analysis is required to adequately describe the binding kinetics.",

The fractal dimension, D f2 , exhibits only a very low (equal to 0.103) order of dependence on the target DNA concentration in solution in the 1-5 mM range. Note that the fractal dimension is based on a log scale, and even small changes in the fractal dimension lead to significant changes in the degree of heterogeneity on the sensor chip surface. Blair et al. (2007) report that techniques have been used for the in situ quantification of DNA during enzymatic synthesis, for example, during a real-time polymerase chain reaction (Watzinger et al., 2006) . Blair et al. (2007) point out that hybridization probes involving \"molecular beacons\" is a DNA quantification method. They have a stem-loop structure with complementary ends that anneal to each other. A fluorophore and a quencher are at opposite ends. Blair et al. (2007) explain that the loop structure is complementary to the target. Thus, as the beacon binds to the target, the fluorophore is separated from the quencher. This leads to an increase in the fluorescence, and is proportional to the amount of the DNA produced Figure 11 .15 Increase in (a) the fractal dimension, D f1 and (b) the fractal dimension, D f2 with an increase in the target DNA concentration (in mM) in solution. (Tyagi and Kramer, 1996; Leone et al., 1998; Guilietti et al., 2001; Summerer and Marx, 2002; Marras et al., 2006) . Blair et al. (2007) have developed a novel hybridization-based assay for the real-time monitoring of RNA synthesis. In their method complementary nucleotides were used to quantify the amount of RNA production by T7 polymerase. Figure 11 .16a shows the binding and dissociation of RNA synthesized on a 420 nM template. The RNA concentration was determined by conversion using a calibration curve. A dual-fractal analysis is required to adequately describe the binding kinetics. A single-fractal analysis is adequate to describe the dissociation kinetics. The values of (a) the binding rate coefficient, k, and the fractal dimension, D f , for a single-fractal analysis, (b) the binding rate coefficients, k 1 and k 2 , and the fractal dimensions, D f1 and D f2 , for a dual-fractal analysis, and (c) the dissociation rate coefficient, k d , and the fractal dimension for the dissociation phase, D fd , for a single-fractal analysis are given in Tables 11.9 and 11.10. It is of interest to note that for a dual-fractal analysis as the fractal dimension increases by a factor of 1.35 from a value of D f1 equal to 1.6862 to D f2 r equal to 2.2812, the binding rate coefficient increases by a factor of 2.79 from a value of k 1 equal to 0.1909 to k 2 equal to 0.5324. The changes in the degree of heterogeneity on the sensor chip surface and in the binding rate coefficient are in the same direction. Figure 11 .16 Binding and dissociation of RNA synthesized on a (a) 420 nM template and a (b) 42 nM template (Blair et al., 2007) . When only a solid line (--) is used then a single-fractal analysis applies. When both a dashed (---) and a solid (--) line are used then the dashed line represents a single-fractal analysis and the solid line represents a dual-fractal analysis. Figure 11 .16b shows the binding and dissociation of RNA synthesized on a 42 nM template. A single-fractal analysis is adequate to describe the binding kinetics. The values of the binding rate coefficient, k, and the fractal dimension, D f , for a single-fractal analysis are given in Tables 11.9 and 11.10. Note that for the lower 42 nM template concentration a single-fractal analysis is adequate to describe the binding kinetics, whereas for the higher 420 nM template concentration a dual-fractal analysis is required to adequately describe the binding kinetics. This would seem to indicate that there is a change in the binding mechanism as one goes from the lower (42 nM template) to the higher (420 nM template) concentration. Blair et al. (2007) analyzed the kinetics of displacement as a function of target concentration. These authors incubated the pre-hybridized 22-nt FQ (fluorophore quencher) complex with varying concentrations of the ss DNA target at 37 C for 90 min. Figure 11 .17a shows the binding of the 500 nM target ss DNAS (T) in solution in a \"broken beacon\" assay.",

For this to occur, the characteristic length of the turbulent boundary layer may have to extend a few monolayers above the sensor chip surface to affect bulk diffusion to and from the surface. However, given the extremely laminar flow regimes in most biosensors this may not actually take place. The sensor chip (arrays/microarrays/DNA chips) surface is characterized by grooves and ridges, and this surface morphology may lead to eddy diffusion. This eddy diffusion can then help to enhance the mixing and extend the characteristic length of the boundary layer to affect the bulk diffusion to and from the surface.",

            "text": "The analysis of the different examples of the detection of analytes on arrays/microarrays/ DNA chips should encourage experimentalists to pay more attention to the nature of the surface, and how it may be manipulated in desired directions. Detection of analytes on arrays/ microarrays/DNA chips is bound to increase in the future as these \"tools\" find increasing applications in a wide variety of areas. This is of particular value primarily in the biomedical area, and also in other areas of application. For example, the identification of DNA sequences is of particular value in clinical pathology. A clinical pathologist is a medical doctor responsible for the diagnosis of diseases based on the analysis of body fluids, for example, blood and urine. The earlier one may detect and diagnose the probable onset of diseases the earlier one can begin the medical protocols necessary to help prevent, alleviate, or correct the onset of, especially, debilitating and intractable diseases. It is hoped that fractal analysis should be particularly helpful in providing a better understanding of the onset of diseases, particularly those that are insidious and debilitating. Any insight that is made available by such an analysis that helps in the management of intractable diseases should prove invaluable.",
