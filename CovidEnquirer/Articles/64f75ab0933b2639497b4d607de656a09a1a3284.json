We examined the evolutionary relationships between bat CoVs and their hosts by using sequence data of the virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene and the bat cytochrome b gene. Phylogenetic analyses showed multiple incongruent associations between the phylogenies of rhinolophid bats and their CoVs, which suggested that host shifts have occurred in the recent evolutionary history of this group. These shifts may be due to either virus biologic traits or host behavioral traits. This fi nding has implications for the emergence of SARS and for the potential future emergence of SARS-CoVs or related viruses.",

For example, CoVs from M. magnater and Myotis ricketti sampled in the same cave in Guangxi were divergent, although sample size was limited. Although Myotis ricketti has a closer phylogenetic relationship with T. pachypus, P. pipistrellus, and P. abramus than with M. magnater and S. kuhlii, its behavior and habits are closer to those of the last group. For example, Myotis ricketti and S. kuhlii bats roosts in caves (although S. kuhlii also roosts under palm leaves), whereas T. pachypus roosts inside bamboo and P. abramus roosts almost entirely in old buildings. Thus, it seems plausible that the close phylogenetic relationship between viruses harbored by Myotis ricketti and S. kuhlii refl ects the similar behavior and ecology of their hosts.",

For example, sister taxa within the genus Pipistrellus independently maintained 2 distinct viruses that share a most recent common ancestor. A similar relationship was apparent among the viruses of some closely related genera (e.g., Pipistrellus and Tylonycteris), whereby divergence of each genus was mirrored by divergence in viral phylogeny. However, viruses are usually thought to have evolved more recently than their hosts (31) . Thus, apparent coevolutionary patterns may refl ect either a high frequency of host shift among closely related bat species or simultaneous lineage splitting of hosts and viruses. Host shifts among related bats might be favored by a variety of mechanisms, including preadaptation to overcome immune defenses or greater rates of interspecifi c contact relative to distantly related bat species.

However, there are different scales of comparison between the Vespertillionidae, in which all but 1 CoV came from separate genera, and the Rhinolophidae, in which we examined a co-phylogeny of multiple species within 1 genus. Genetic diversity in the vespertilionids sampled was nearly double that of the rhinolophids, which was probably due to the greater number of species sampled and their broader taxonomic range. Despite this greater genetic diversity among vespertilionid bat hosts, the genetic diversity of CoVs did not differ between vespertilionids and rhinopholids. This diversity suggests that vespertilionids may maintain undiscovered CoVs or that rhinolophids might harbor disproportionate CoV diversity relative to diversity of their genus. We propose that future work may identify more vespertilionid bat CoVs, which would enable an accurate comparison of propensity for host shifts within this group.",

First, SARS-like CoVs and other rhinolophid CoVs (RfV1 and RpV1) show evidence of interspecies transmission. Second, CoVs from other bat groups that are phylogenetically much closer to RfV 1 and RpV 1 than to the SARS-like CoVs do not show evidence of successful host shifts.

Although we acknowledge that this interpretation may be limited by sample size, it may also indicate that rhinolophid bats, the hosts of a cluster of SARS-like CoVs within which human and civet SARS CoV nestle phylogenetically (6, 7) , are more likely to foster the host shifts of CoVs than are other bat species. The potential for close contact between bats, civets, and humans in the wildlife trade in southern China, coupled with a possible propensity of these bats to foster CoV host-shifts, could explain SARS-like CoVs as the source of SARS-CoV. This potential supports molecular results on bat CoVs that suggest a recent host shift from bats to civets or other animals and humans (34) . Such host shifts may indicate a risk posed by other bat CoVs for novel disease emergence. Finally, the ability of SARS-like CoVs to be transmitted between and establish in new species (i.e., to undergo host shifts) is consistent with other CoVs. This has been shown for several CoVs of livestock species (35) and has been used to support their inclusion as 1 of the groups of viruses most likely to be responsible for emerging zoonoses, even before the emergence of SARS (36) .",
