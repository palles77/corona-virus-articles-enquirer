Cavanagh (1983) provided evidence that each peplomer is a dimer or trimer of E2. The presence of two regions with heptad periodicity in the C-terminal half of the protein suggests that the monomers are held together by a complex interchain coiled coil (De Groot et a/., 1987c) .",

Moreover, such cell lines could be used to study virus assembly and membrane fusion. Here we report synthesis of FIPV E2 in bovine papilloma virus (BPV)-transformed Cl 27-cells. It is shown that the expression product induces fusion of FIPV-permissive feline cells and is immunogenic in mice. In addition, we describe two new BPV \"cassette\" expression vectors allowing (i) easy cloning of genes between promotor and termination sequences, (ii) easy replacement of promotor and termination sequences, and (iii) both transient and stable expression.",

Before cloning this gene into the expression vectors redundant noncoding sequences located at the 5' and 3' ends were removed. For trimming of the 5'end (extending 350 nucleotides from the E2 initiation codon), 16 ng of the synthetic oligonucleotide YTGTGCCATGAT-TGTGCT 3'(corresponding to position -6 to +l 1 of the E2 gene) was annealed in 10 m/l/l Tris-HCI, pH 7.5, 50 mlVl NaCl (total volume 30 ~1) to 1 pg of single-stranded DNA from a recombinant M 13 mp8 phage containing the (-)sense strand of the 5' terminal 1.4-kb Pstl fragment of pB1. Double-stranded DNA was synthesized by incubation with 0.05 mM dNTPs and 3 units Klenow DNA polymerase in a final volume of 40 ~1, for 15 min at room temperature. The DNA was precipitated with isopropanol, washed with 70% ethanol, and resuspended in 10 /*I 10 m/l/l Tris-HCI, pH 8, 1 mM EDTA. Subsequently, 15 ~1 of Sl buffer (30 mM potassium acetate, pH 4.6,0.25 n/l NaCI, 1 mMZnSO,, 5% glycerol) containing 7 units Sl nuclease (Pharmacia) was added; digestion was for 20 min at room temperature (Eghterdarzadeh and Henikoff, 1986) . After phenol extraction and ethanol precipitation, the DNA was digested with Pstl. Thus a 1058-bp fragment was generated corresponding to the 5' end of the E2 gene. This DNA was cloned into HindIll (blunt-ended with Klenow)/Pstl-digested pUC8 in the presence of BarnHI linkers. The ligation mixture was used for transformation of JM 109 according to Hanahan (1983) . Recombinant clones were selected by colony hybridization. The FIPV-specific inserts were sequenced. Plasmid pl A contained the 5' end sequence of the FIPV peplomer gene, starting 5 nucleotides upstream of the AUG co-don (1 nucleotide was lost probably by nibbling of the Sl nuclease), preceded by a BarnHI linker. Plasmid pl A was digested with Pstl and the 3000-bp Pstl fragment of B 1 was inserted in the correct orientation. The Accl site located 98 nucleotides downstream of the stop codon was used to remove the redundant sequences at the 3' end. As a result, the complete FIPV E2 gene was contained in a 4.3-kb BarnHI fragment.",

This effect was concluded to be E2 specific, since it was not induced by the BPV-transformed cell line AM2 synthesizing the MHV nucleocapsid protein nor by the RM(+)15 cell line producing truncated E2 transcripts. In addition, syncytia formation was inhibited in the presence of FIPV antiserum; preimmune serum from the same cat did not inhibited cell fusion (data not shown). Fusion did not occur between murine cells but depended upon the presence of feline cells, suggesting that for membrane fusion to occur binding of E2 to the FIPV cell receptor is required. A similar observation was made for cell lines expressing the envelope glycoprotein of human immune deficiency virus: polykaryocyte formation was restricted to cells bearing the CD4 receptor (Sodroski et al., 1986) .",

            "text": "In RM(+)19 ceils E2 was synthesized as a core-glycosylated protein of 180K. Removal of the oligosaccharide side chains by endo H reduced the size of the expression product to 160K (about the size of the FIPV E2 apoprotein) (De Groot et a/., 1987b). As shown by the fusion assay some of the E2 was transported to the plasma membrane. However, immunofluorescence studies suggested that most E2 was retained intracel-lularly. This was confirmed in pulse-chase experiments: of the E2 molecules labeled during a 1 -hr pulse about half was still completely sensitive to endo H treatment after a 2-hr chase. The remaining material was chased into immature endo H-resistant products 160K to 180K in length, probably representing partially processed medial Golgi forms (Dunphy and Rothman, 1985) . These results indicate that in RM(+)19 cells E2 is only slowly transported from ER to Golgi. For comparison, the VSV glycoprotein expressed in BPV-transformed Cl 27 cells is processed to the mature endo Hresistant form in less than 30 min (Florkiewicz et a/., 1983) . The slow maturation of E2 in RM(+)19 cells could be host cell determined: the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) acquired terminal glycosylation with a half-time of more than 2 hr in BPV-transformed Cl27 cells (Sambrook eta/., 1985) , while in simian CV-1 cells terminal glycosylation was completed within 40 min (Copeland et a/., 1986) . However, the slow rate of transport was also observed in various cell lines infected with a vaccinia virus recombinant expressing E2 of FIPV (Vennema et al., submitted). Since coronaviruses bud through pre-Golgi membranes (Tooze et a/., 1988) a delayed intracellular transport of free E2 is likely to be a prerequisite for efficient virus assembly.",

Although the titers were modest, we trust that higher titers can readily be obtained by using larger amounts of cell lysate and optimized immunization protocols. We would like to use RM(+)19 cells for immunization experiments in cats to further study the role of E2 in immunopathology and protection.",
