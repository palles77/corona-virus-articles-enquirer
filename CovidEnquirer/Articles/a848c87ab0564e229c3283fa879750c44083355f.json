            "text": "In late July 1976, there was an outbreak of severe pneumonia among individuals attending an American Legion convention at the Bellevue Stratford Hotel in Philadelphia, PA. Two hundred twenty-one individuals, predominantly men, were stricken, and 34 died. The investigation that followed identified a new bacterium, which was subsequently named Legionella pneumophila (1, 2) . Almost 50 years later, Legionnaires' disease is a nationally notifiable disease in the United States (3) . The CDC estimates that between 8,000 and 18,000 cases of Legionnaires' disease occur in the United States annually (4) . In addition, between 1995 and 2005, over 32,000 cases were reported to the European Working Group for Legionella Infections (5) . It has subsequently been learned that an unidentified gram-negative rod that was frozen in 1947 was later identified as Legionella sp., so the American Legion convention was not the first time Legionella was isolated from humans (6) .",

Legionella spp. are not transmitted person to person but through the air and in water. Symptoms of Legionnaires' disease include fever, a nonproductive cough, headache, myalgias, rigors, dyspnea, diarrhea, and delirium. Erythromycin and, later, ciprofloxacin were designated the initial drugs of choice for the treatment of legionellosis; however, newer macrolides, such as azithromycin or clarithromycin, and newer quinolones, such as levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, and gemifloxacin, have also been found to be effective (8) .",

Confirmation of identification is usually performed by staining with polyvalent conjugates containing monoclonal antibodies against the most common clinical isolates.

Superheating the water to >60\u00b0C (>140\u00b0F) can help dimin- ish the Legionella bioburden for short periods but must be repeated every 3 to 5 weeks. For disinfection, hospitals use 180\u00b0F water for a 2-hour flush. This is performed by zones so that patient care is not affected.
