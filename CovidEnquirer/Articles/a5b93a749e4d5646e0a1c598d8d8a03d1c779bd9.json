This paper evaluates the performances of common constant air volume (CAV) system and variable air volume (VAV) system when carbon dioxide and particles are significantly present in outdoor environment. Major system parameters including filter efficiency, occupancy number, ventilation air rate, and outdoor particle concentration are thoroughly examined. Firstly, a full-scale chamber experiment is performed to investigate the dynamics of CO 2 and airborne particles under steady and non-steady scenarios. The result is further validated with a previously-developed state-space model. Secondly, an exhaustive case study is conducted using an established mathematical model. In order to reduce CO 2 concentration, both CAV and CO 2 -based demand-controlled VAV may cause an undesirable increase in particle concentration when outdoor air is heavily polluted by particles. This dilemma requires further studies on the optimization of ventilation schemes.",

After the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and various avian influenza worldwide, there has been a speedy rush in studying the buildingrelated factors which are linked to the risk in airborne transmitted pathogens and indoor air quality (IAQ). The increasing concern over IAQ has highlighted the need for ventilation strategies suitable to control pollutant concentrations in indoor environments of buildings. One major challenge is the control of indoor particulate matter (PM) concentration, which is governed by a complex set of engineering factors and physical processes [2, 3] . Indoor particles can be generated from either indoor or outdoor sources. Indoor particles may arise from sources such as office printers, occupant activity, combustion related activities such as stove cooking [4] , and resuspension of deposited particles as a result of walking [5] . For residential buildings outdoor particles can enter buildings through penetration building cracks or window frames [6] whereas for commercial buildings, particles entry pathways are mainly through mechanical ventilation systems [7e10] . In fact, the increase of indoor fine particles concentration is mainly affected by outdoor traffic condition particularly in urban district [11e13] .",

The most common method is CO 2 -based DCV, which is particularly valuable in densely occupied environments such as offices, lecture theatre, and public buildings [22] . Based on the new standard ASHRAE 62.1, researchers have designed new implementation strategies of CO 2 -based DCV under this new standard [23e25] .

Next, a statespace model for the dynamics of CO 2 and airborne polydisperse particles recently developed by our group is applied to analyse the trend in the experimental findings. Afterwards, we performed an exhaustive case study using a new mathematical model. Both the experimental and the theoretical results support that the dilution of CO 2 with either CAV or CO 2 -based demand-controlled VAV causes an undesirable increase in indoor particle concentrations.

The chamber represents a typical office room with a variable refrigerant volume (VRV) airconditioning system. A CO 2 tank with a regulator was used to mimic the exhalation process of human subjects inside the office, and a heater box was introduced to replicate the thermal load in the space. According to the ASHRAE Standard 62.1 [18] , the average CO 2 released by one sedentary person is 0.31 L/min; therefore, the CO 2 generation was adjusted at a rate of 0.62 L/min for simulating an office with two persons inside. Usually, a lightly working or resting adult produces about 100 W of heat [27] . Therefore a heater box (0.6 m \u00c2 0.3 m \u00c2 1 m) with one 200 W light bulb was used in a simulation of a two-person working space. A fan was installed inside the heater box to ensure that the generated heat is evenly distributed within the box. A schematic diagram of the entire experimental setup is shown in Fig. 1 . Before starting the experiments, leakage test was conducted. Differential pressure of 20 Pa was applied and measured by a manometer when CO 2 was simultaneously injected to the room. Best-fitting of the CO 2 decay plot yielded the leakage rate, which is approximately 0.1 ACH under the specified pressure difference of 20 Pa and can be ignored compared to the supply air rate.",

A 24-jet nebulizer (BGI) was connected to the fresh air duct, whereby polydisperse particles were generated to model different ambient pollutant levels. An optical particle counter (983, Fluke) was used to record particle concentration in five specific particle size bins ranging from 0.3 to 9.99 mm, i.e., 0.3e0.49 mm, 0.5e0.99 mm, 1.0e1.99 mm, 2.0e4.99 mm, 5.0e9.99 mm. All other particles larger than 10.0 mm were also recorded in a separate bin. The unit recorded was in number per litre. The system parameters in this study were carefully chosen in order to best match the practical values. Two different ventilation rates were applied. A normal ventilation rate for a two-person office is 20 L/s, while 30 L/s was used for achieving a higher air quality. The choice of particle concentration is based field measurement at heavy traffic locations [28] ; particle concentration recorded is nearly 9.0 \u00c2 10 4 particle/cm 3 . Therefore, 9.0 \u00c2 10 4 and 5.0 \u00c2 10 4 particle/cm 3 were chosen to represent the worst and worse ambient cases, respectively. Four filters with different filtration efficiencies of 65% and a thickness of 150 mm was were tested herein, namely 150 mm thickness with 95% efficiency, 300 mm thickness with 95% efficiency, 150 mm thickness with 65% efficiency and 300 mm thickness with 65% efficiency. The concentration of generated particle was then measured at Test point 1 (TP1), where the nebuliser is connected. Sodium chloride (NaCl) suspension was used to generate solid testing particles. The particles were dried and their charges were neutralized to the Boltzmann charge equilibrium by passing them through a radioactive source Krypton-85 before connecting to the airconditioning system of the testing chamber.",

Afterwards, these particle concentrations are maintained at the same level during the rest of the operation period. It is found that filtration efficiency significantly influences PM concentration. For instance, under outdoor air particle concentration of 50 mg/m 3 and fresh air flow rate of 8.5 L/s/ p, filters with 40%, 60% and 80% filtration efficiency gives the mean PM 1.0-1.99 values of 11.4 mg/m 3 , 6.0 mg/m 3 and 2.5 mg/m 3 in 12 h, respectively. These results as mentioned above are all considered to be low. Nevertheless, when the filter efficiency is low, outdoor condition is adverse and fresh air flow rate is high, the indoor PM level cannot be ignored. Inferring from Tables 3e5, when outdoor concentration is 100 mg/m 3 , two cases exceed the WHO guideline which occurs at the 40% filter efficiency and the highest ventilation rate. The trend as mentioned above suggests that high fresh air flow rate does not always give better IAQ. When the outdoor condition is worsened with PM concentrations of 200 mg/m 3 , five out of six results of two lowest filter efficiency cases exceed the guideline considerably. One may considers lowering the fresh air flow rate under this adverse condition, leading to an increase of CO 2 level but in only marginal level. Another possible measure is to install filter with efficiency >80%. This will increase the air-conditioning running cost whenever the system is operating. In fact if the outdoor PM level is very high, in order to lower exposure, indoor cleaning devices, such as those install air filtration systems, can be an option. In fact this measure has been becoming more popular aiming at providing enhanced filtration during adverse ambient conditions [38] .",

Under a fixed ventilation rate, the maximum CO 2 concentration is the same as that of the CAV case. The average concentration is calculated in Tables 3e5. Good We assume that the outdoor CO 2 concentration is 400 ppm and initial indoor air However, slight difference can be observed and the trend is that VAV scheme would result in higher CO 2 concentration. Besides, the temporal variation between CAV and VAV is obvious. Under the VAV scheme, the CO 2 concentration is kept constant during the operation periods. This is because the fresh air is varied based on the number of people accommodated in the office space. The total fresh air is designed to dilute the exact CO 2 which is generated by exact occupants. Therefore, the ventilation system seems like a CO 2based DCV operation. In this case energy saving can be achieved during less people accommodation period. On the other hand, the particle concentrations level varies due to variation of the total supply of fresh air. Less fresh air causes less particle concentration indoors. The calculated mean as shown in Tables 3e5 shows that the particle concentrations mean values for CAV cases are consistently higher than those of VAV cases approximately 16%e24%. Besides the more the fresh air supplied, the more the energy is being consumed. By comparing between CAV and VAV cases, the energy impact in CAV case is quite obvious. It is because under the CAV the total ventilation air is kept at constant regardless of the people number. However, the energy supply for cooling and dehumidifying the hot and humid outdoor air is fixed. On the other hand, under the VAV case energy consumption is based on CO 2based DCV. Thus the energy demand is varied over operation period. It would result in less total energy consumption than that of the CAV case. Although it is not the scope of the present work, the energy consumption can be calculated by the ventilation air rate and its temperature different between outdoor and indoor temperature in terms of enthalpy.",

            "text": "The ventilation factors affecting indoor CO 2 and particle levels for CAV and CO 2 -based demand-controlled VAV systems remain to be elucidated. In this study, a state-space model was first validated by in-house experiments under both steady and unsteady ventilation rates. Good agreement between the experimental measurement and model prediction with respect to particle and CO 2 concentrations were found. Twenty-seven case scenarios studies were conducted from both CAV and VAV cases to explore the relationship among filter efficiency, ventilation rate, outdoor PM level and modes of ventilation. Normal ventilation rate of 8.5 L/s/p can lead to CO 2 concentration lower than 1000 ppm at CAV fresh air supply. Notwithstanding, the other two highest ventilation air flow rates results in even lower CO 2 concentration, however, it does not always give better IAQ if ambient PM level is severe. The results support the existence of an interaction between PM and CO 2 concentrations. It is shown that high efficiency filter plays a key role in the management of indoor PM concentration. In tackling those adverse ambient conditions, filter with efficiency >80% to be implemented is suggested. The result also shows that 16e24% less particle concentrations mean values were found in VAV cases than those in CAV cases. Our results also show that CAV and VAV systems, under low ACH situations, can meet the requirements of the particle and CO 2 concentrations of WHO 2005 [36] and HKEPD [37] standards. This study confirms that a dilemma to be further studied may occur in heavily polluted cities: dilution of indoor CO 2 Table 3 Results of maximum and mean values of PM 1.0e1.99 and CO 2 concentration at outdoor air particles of 50 mg/m.
