This equation illustrates PaO 2 as a minimal part of oxygen delivery at sea level unless the hemoglobin or arterial blood saturation is decreased severely [5] . The purpose of erythrocyte transfusion is to maintain or increase the oxygen carrying capacity of blood. There is almost no indication to transfuse a hemoglobin level greater than 10 g/dL but there is almost always an indication for hemoglobin less than 6 g/dL. Preoperative hematocrit and estimated blood volume can be used to predict transfusion requirements intraoperatively. One unit of packed red blood cells will increase the hematocrit by approximately 3% and the hemoglobin 1 g/dL in the average adult [6] . Estimated total blood volume is about 65 cc/kg of blood for women and 75 cc/kg of blood for men. The estimated total blood volume then is multiplied by the percent hematocrit (\u00c2/100), which gives the estimated red blood cell volume.",

His blood volume of 5250 cc multiplied by .45 will yield 2362.5 cc of erythrocytes. Using 30 as the previously targeted hemoglobin, his blood volume of 5250 *.30 will be 1575. Using these numbers, he will need to lose 2362.5 -1575 \u00bc 787.5 cc before his hematocrit decreases to 30. Red blood cell transfusions are indicated in symptomatic anemic patients to restore oxygen-carrying capacity and delivery. Blood viscosity is determined primarily by erythrocyte concentration. In anemia, blood viscosity can decrease severely, which, in turn, decreases the resistance to blood flow in peripheral blood vessels. The decrease in peripheral resistance returns larger than normal quantities of blood from the tissues to the heart, which greatly increases cardiac output. Hypoxemia also results from the decreased transport of erythrocytes, which further decreases peripheral vascular resistance, allowing more blood return to the heart, further increasing CO and myocardial oxygen consumption. Not only does anemia decrease oxygen delivery, it also increases cardiac output, myocardial oxygen consumption, and possibly the risk of end organ ischemia [4] .",

The inheritance of O does not create a functional enzyme. Patients make antibodies to the antigens that they lack. Type O people lack A and B antigens on their red cells, so they will have anti-A and anti-B antibodies in their plasma. These naturally occurring antibodies occur in patients even with no prior blood exposure. The antibodies produced against ABO antigens are IgM and capable of causing intravascular hemolysis if incompatible blood is transfused.",

Exogenous erythropoietin affects erythropoiesis in the same way. For elective postsurgical patients, erythropoietin will stimulate the rate of erythropoiesis to return RBC mass to a steady state. Exogenous erythropoietin will increase RBC mass in many anemic states and has been shown to do the same for preoperative surgical patients undergoing autologous blood transfusions. It has been demonstrated to decrease transfusion requirements in the postoperative period when patients are given erythropoietin preoperatively, provided there is iron available. It also can be given to anemic postoperative patients to increase the rate of recovery to normal hemoglobin levels. Perioperative erythropoietin is expensive but generally well tolerated, and with low doses costs may be comparable to preoperative autologous blood donation. This option increases the patient's red cell mass before surgery with exogenous erythropoietin. The efficacy of erythropoietin in reducing the volume of allogeneic blood transfused per patient and reducing the number of patients requiring transfusions is documented well in certain populations (renal insufficiency, anemia of chronic disease, refusal of transfusion) [1] .",

Numerous studies suggest that between 6 and 10 units of blood loss, replaced with packed RBCs and crystalloid solution only, a gradual prolongation of the prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT) can be detected, before signs of microvascular bleeding indicate the onset of early coagulopathy [29] . Factor assays at this time in elective cases, somewhere around one blood volume lost and replaced, will reveal significant decreases in fibrinogen, which may contribute to the generalized ooze on the surgical field [30] . In elective cases with significant ongoing blood loss, platelets decrease to abnormal levels relatively late. In trauma cases, however, thrombocytopenia may occur more rapidly, sometimes at less than one blood volume, so that defects in primary hemostasis (quantitative platelet function) may be the cause of the earliest microvascular bleeding. Maintenance of body temperature with fluid warming and forced air heating may prevent physiologic depression of clotting factor and platelet function, but in patients losing blood, a threshold eventually will be reached where blood components will be required, in addition to packed red cells and buffered salt solutions, to reverse the trend toward coagulopathy.",

Blood loss may result in anemia and coagulation abnormalities, but specific coagulation assays, even performed at the bedside, may take too long to perform to reflect rapidly changing conditions in the trauma patient. Such testing will serve to confirm the effects of ongoing therapy, rather than to guide future therapy in the acute situation. Coagulation factor therapy therefore is based on empiric assumptions related to estimated blood volume loss.",

Once triggered by the request of the anesthesiologist or surgeon, the blood shipments would continue uninterrupted under the protocol until the bleeding was controlled or the patient expired.",

During the first 10 units of blood loss, the primary need is for volume support with packed RBCs and crystalloid. Levels of specific clotting factors are maintained, but FTP usually is given to support blood volume and to attempt to control coagulopathy in its early phases. Between 10 and 15 units of blood loss, platelet levels and fibrinogen levels decrease rapidly, and replacement with platelet packs and cryoprecipitate may be necessary to support coagulation. By roughly one blood volume of blood loss, factor VII and other procoagulants may be reaching marginal levels, and early use of high-dose NovoSeven (4.8 mg) is included in the protocol at that time.",

In a group of 100 consecutive patients meeting MTP criteria, prior to beginning the protocol and treated with blood products at the direction of the anesthesiologist and trauma surgeon, patient survival at 30 days was 50%. In the first two years of the protocol, 30-day survival each year remained in the 50% range, which was no better than the control group. The amount of PRBC units transfused, as a marker of the number of blood shipments sent out on the protocol, appears to be reduced by 25% compared with the total PRBC units used for the control group. It would appear that patients are clotting better and bleeding less, assuming a homogeneous trauma population over the past 5 years. NovoSeven was introduced into wider clinical use after the control group was studied, however, so the reduction in total blood products might be due partly or solely to the use of rFVIIa, rather than to the greater use of procoagulants on schedule in the MTP. The number of patients on the MTP each year is roughly the size of the control group, (around 100), and ongoing analysis of variables within the survivor and nonsurvivor groups may yield further information (Ravinder Sarode, MD, personal communication, January 2007).",

Relieving the anesthesia and nursing personnel of continual worry about blood supplies during urgent trauma surgery has been of great benefit in the opinion of most involved staff. Outcome data to prove that the MTP is of benefit to the patients will be more difficult to produce, and benefit in terms of better clotting functions and improved survival may be several years away. Just the savings in blood products could be cited as an advantage, if further data analysis suggests that the roughly 25% decrease in blood product usage in massive transfusion using the protocol actually persists in the future data. It appears that the MTP has proven its worth in more convenience to medical and nursing personnel, even if patient benefit and cost savings are not entirely proven benefits at this time. ",
