Six hospitals were classified as computer record groups (CRG) and used their existing computerized record capabilities. The other 6 hospitals used a personal digital assistant (PDA) with customized software (PDA group). Data were evaluated by the health department epidemiologist using SaTScan, a modified version of a cancer cluster detection program, to look for clusters of cases above baseline over time and by Zip code.",

            "text": "Conclusions: The 12 hospitals participating in this study demonstrated that community-wide surveillance using computerized data was possible and that the 6 study hospitals using a PDA could quickly interpret emergency department patients' chief complaints. The emergency department chief complaints group could serve as a disease sentinel for the community. T he emergence of new diseases, specifically the global outbreaks of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, along with concerns of bioterrorism have fueled a widespread interest in monitoring health indicator data. The process of monitoring chief complaints or presenting symptoms is referred to as syndromic surveillance. Electronic patient information 1 and databases 2 can aid researchers in the use of syndromic surveillance by providing an additional method for detecting clinical features of illness prior to confirmed diagnosis. 3 Active monitoring of community health may provide early warnings of disease outbreaks resulting from bioterrorism or natural phenomena. 4 The current use of automated record-keeping systems may help to identify potential clusters of acute illnesses, track those illnesses, and detect trends for future analysis. 5 In light of advanced technological tools and methodologies, local emergency management personnel and hospital-based health care providers are re-evaluating current surveillance systems and response capabilities. These evaluations assist in identifying flexible and nontraditional ways of addressing the concerns raised about detecting potential acts of bioterrorism, 6 as well as identifying manifestations of naturally occurring disease. Syndromic surveillance and an astute clinician's observations enhance traditional disease surveillance and response.",

Projectspecific software can be developed quickly and implemented in any hospital with minimal cost. This same methodology was used during the 2003 and 2004 Derby Festivals, demonstrating the ability to re-implement the simple surveillance system. The ability to use a PDA for other uses or in other settings is an important factor for determining value. PDA software was written and tested, PDAs and associated equipment purchased, and individual hospital contacts identified and educated within 1 week. Equipment costs were minimal for the CRG and less than $250 for the PDAG. The lack of expense and ease of use demonstrate that the PDAs are flexible for use in such a short period of time. The highest costs were associated with the labor involved, especially for the IC/UL staff.",
