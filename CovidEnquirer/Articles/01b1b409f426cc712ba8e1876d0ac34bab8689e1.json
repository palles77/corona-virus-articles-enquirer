An entire batch of sows was followed during two successive reproduction cycles. Nasal, tonsillar and oropharyngeal swabs and blood samples were taken from each sow 9 and 4 weeks before farrowing and 1 and 4 weeks after farrowing. Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus parasuis and Streptococcus suis were detected from swab samples using PCR assays. Blood samples were tested for antibodies against M. hyopneumoniae, A. pleuropneumoniae serotypes 1-9-11 and 2, Porcine Circovirus type-2 (PCV-2) and Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome virus (PRRSV) by ELISA tests. Antibodies against H 1 N 1 , H 1 N 2 and H 3 N 2 Swine Influenza Viruses (SIV) of European lineages were tested by hemagglutination inhibition assay. The results indicated that S. suis is widespread among sows (67.1% of PCR-positive sows). A. pleuropneumoniae, P. multocida, and H. parasuis were detected by PCR in 30.9%, 24.6% and 23.4% of the sows, respectively. Antibodies against M. hyopneumoniae were recovered from more than 55% of the sows in all herds whereas the micro-organism was detected in 2.4% of the sows. Although PCV-2 and SIV infections were highly prevalent, the PRRSV infection patterns ranged from no infection in farms mildly affected by respiratory diseases to active circulation in more severely affected herds. The sow population thus constitutes a reservoir for a continuous circulation of respiratory pathogens and needs to be properly considered in control strategies.",

Indeed, the infection pressure had to be at a very low level throughout the pigs' lifetime in order to reduce disease severity. Particular attention to critical transmission points is required to reduce pathogen transmission between animals. For many of the microorganisms involved in respiratory diseases vertical transmission, relying on sow to piglet contamination, is suspected to occur in endemically infected herds during the suckling phase (Clark et al., 1991; Amass et al., 1996; Vigre et al., 2002; Zimmerman et al., 2006) . Sows can thus serve as a reservoir for the continuous circulation of infectious pathogens especially in farrow-to-finish systems, where both populations, (i.e., the breeding herd and the growing-finishing pigs), are reared on the same site (Calsamiglia and Pijoan, 2000; Sorensen et al., 2006) . Reducing the infection pressure in the sow herd may help to decrease spreading in the offspring. However, at present, little is known about the shedding and infection dynamics of respiratory pathogens, especially bacteria, in sow populations. Such information would be helpful to (i) properly design epidemiological studies for assessing/ understanding infection dynamics within a herd and detecting the risk factors of respiratory diseases, (ii) provide accurate information for modeling studies, i.e. parameterization and validation of epidemiological models, and (iii) implement adequate control strategies. The aim of the present study was therefore to describe the carrying and infection patterns of batches of sows to various respiratory pathogens during gestation and lactation in herds differently affected by respiratory disorders.",

Five herds were selected for different patterns regarding their respiratory health status in growing-finishing pigs and to tally with the most common herd health patterns, housing and herd management practices encountered in the field at that time. They were also selected for convenience as the farmer had to agree with our protocol. The screening visit took place 2-3 months before the present longitudinal field study was started. Clinical signs of respiratory disorders in the farrowing, post-weaning and finishing sections were recorded. Nasal, tonsillar and oro-pharyngeal swabs and blood samples were obtained from 30 pigs: 10 in the postweaning section, 10 at the beginning and 10 at the end of the finishing phase. Lungs from at least 30 of the sampled finishing pigs were collected at the slaughterhouse. Macroscopic lung lesions of pneumonia were scored (Madec and Kobisch, 1982) and samples of lung lesions were taken. Swabs and lung samples were examined by PCR in our laboratory to detect M. hyopneumoniae, P. multocida, A. pleuropneumoniae, H. parasuis and S. suis. All sera were analysed for the detection of antibodies to PRRSV and SIV (H 1 N 1 , H 3 N 2 and H 1 N 2 ).",

Parity distributions at each reproduction cycle are given for each herd in Table 3 . Sows from herd C were on average younger than those from the other herds since new breeding stock was introduced when moving from a 3-week to a 4-week batch interval. The high average parity in herd D was related to the breeding sows management policy (long lasting time of the sows).",

While S. suis, A. pleuropneumoniae, P. multocida and H. parasuis were the most frequent pathogens identified in the upper part of the airways of the sows, these pathogens were seldom detected in lung tissues of slaughtered pigs during the recruitment step. M. hyopneumoniae was indeed the only pathogen detected at slaughter from lungs of finishing pigs in all five herds. Even if the slaughtered sampled pigs were not the offspring of the sows followed in the present study, we can assume that other factors than the bacterial carrier state of the upper part of the respiratory tract of the sows may influence the infectious status of the lung in growingfinishing pigs. M. hyopneumoniae plays a central role in PRDC and is widespread in pig herds (Thacker, 2006) . Interestingly, even if the M. hyopneumoniae genome was detected in four out of the five selected herds, the micro-organism was relatively seldom identified at the sow level. The detection threshold of the simple PCR was estimated to be 10-100-fold higher than that of nested-PCR (Marois et al., 2007) . Therefore, this could have limited our capacity to detect sows carrying low numbers of M. hyopneumoniae (<1000 mycoplasma). The true prevalence of positive animals may in turn have been underestimated. On the other hand, when studying infection dynamics, the bacterial load carried by the animals is more important than a positive shedding status. Further studies using quantitative tests are needed to improve our knowledge on the course of M. hyopneumoniae infection under field conditions. Although M. hyopneumoniae DNA was not consistently detected, antibodies against the microorganism were recovered in sows from all herds. Positive reactions in serum from sows may reflect previous exposure to M. hyopneumoniae, as vaccination was not carried out in the investigated herds. Interestingly, in the herd that showed the lowest number of seropositive sows, M. hyopneumoniae carriage was not detected at any sampling time. It can be speculated that M. hyopneumoniae infection dynamics within the sow population remained limited in this farm. The fact that M. hyopneumoniae was detected in the upper respiratory tract of seropositive sows, indicated, as already reported (Sibila et al., 2007) , that circulating antibodies against M. hyopneumoniae did not prevent colonization of the airways. M. hyopneumoniae DNA was detected in sows from the first until the tenth parity suggesting that even the oldest sows may carry the organism and have the potential to spread the bacteria to susceptible animals, especially their offspring. In previous studies, relationships between sow parity and M. hyopneumoniae infection were inconsistent (Calsamiglia and Pijoan, 2000; Ruiz et al., 2003; grosse Beilage et al., 2009 ). Our study, being primarily descriptive, may lack sufficient power to find any significant association. Thus, further research seems to be required to conclude about the influence of sow age on M. hyopneumoniae infection, but, due to the expected low prevalence of carrier sows, altogether, these results emphasize the need to sample a large number of sows of different parity groups when assessing M. hyopneumoniae infection dynamics.",

These findings indicate that seroconversion is more likely to occur during the first two reproduction cycles and suggest that young sows are exposed to the micro-organism following their introduction in the breeding herd. Antibodies to the two considered serotypes were found in all herds. While the high seropositivity levels observed in herd C could be related to the vaccination, the antibodies detected in the four nonvaccinated herds indicated that sows were naturally infected. This also suggested that the infection is widespread among clinically healthy sow herds as reported for A. pleuropneumoniae serotype 2 (Levonen et al., 1994) . It should be noted that the infection pressure differed between farms, as revealed by the varying levels of seroprevalence between herds. Fig. 4 .

This is in line with a cross-sectional study showing that M. hyopneumoniae seropositivity in sows is influenced by various management factors (grosse Beilage et al., 2009 ). According to the results of the present study, the carrier state or serological status of the sows did not seem to be affected by whether they were in gestation or lactation. A decrease in the level of M. hyopneumoniae serum antibodies during the last month of pregnancy to the farrowing day was previously described (Wallgren et al., 1998) . Since the last sampling time during pregnancy was performed 4 weeks before farrowing, our sampling scheme may have limited the ability to detect such a reduction. Whatever the microorganism, a specific physiological stage with a maximum prevalence of carrier sows was not identified. Therefore, sampling sows at different gestation and lactation stages should be recommended, especially in cross-sectional studies looking for prevalence. On the other hand, the carrying patterns of the same batches of sows, especially for H. parasuis and S. suis, were different from the first to the second reproduction cycle suggesting a time effect on the level of carriage for a given batch. This tended to indicate that a batch effect is important to take into account in epidemiological studies as well as in diagnostic.",

            "text": "The seroprevalence of PCV-2 infection was high in the four herds we tested, hence confirming the widespread occurrence of PCV-2 in French sow herds as described earlier . Serological investigations also showed that SIV antibodies were highly prevalent in the sows which is consistent with the fact that viruses of H 1 N 1 and H 1 N 2 European subtypes are widespread in pig populations in France (Kuntz-Simon and Madec, 2009 ). HI tests revealed infections with H 1 N 1 and/or H 1 N 2 viruses, while H 3 N 2 antibodies could only be detected in vaccinated sows or as a result of cross-reactions in the HI test as already reported (Van Reeth et al., 2006) . The infection pattern of the sow batches towards PRRSV differed between the five herds in which the growing pigs were experiencing different levels of severity of respiratory disorders. While in herd A, being the less affected by respiratory diseases, PRRSV infection was not detected in the sows during the study, an increase in the frequency of PRRSV-seropositive sows was found in the herd the most severely affected by lung diseases in finishing pigs (herd E). This increase in seropositivity frequency indicated that PRRSV was actively circulating in the sow herd. A higher and stable frequency of PRRSV infection was recovered in the second herd with growing pigs severely affected by respiratory diseases. Conversely a lower and decreasing rate of infected sows was described in herd C, suggesting that the virus was no longer actively spreading in the sow population. In the latter herd, the growing-finishing pigs which were tested remained sero-negative throughout the course of the study (data not shown). In herd B, despite the use of a commercial inactivated vaccine against PRRSV, from 50% to 64% of the sows tested positive by serology. Under experimental and field conditions, some variations in seropositivity rates following vaccination with a killed vaccine have been described (Reynaud et al., 1999) . In the same line, Papatsiros et al. (2006) found that the humoral response of sows following two vaccinations was short, lasting 40 days after the booster vaccination. In the present study, the antibodies detected 72 days after the vaccination were probably related to active infection. In addition, the PRRSV antibodies detected in growing pigs confirmed that this herd was not virus-free.",

Therefore, these results suggest that the sow population needs to be properly considered in the measures taken to control respiratory diseases.
