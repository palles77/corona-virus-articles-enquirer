All type III IFNs initiate signaling processes through formation of specific heterodimeric receptor complexes consisting of IFN-\u03bbR1 and IL-10R2. We have determined the structure of human IFN-\u03bb1 complexed with human IFN-\u03bbR1, a receptor unique to type III IFNs. The overall structure of IFN-\u03bb1 is topologically similar to the structure of IL-10 and other members of the IL-10 family of cytokines. IFN-\u03bbR1 consists of two distinct domains having fibronectin type III topology. The ligand-receptor interface includes helix A, loop AB, and helix F on the IFN site, as well as loops primarily from the N-terminal domain and inter-domain hinge region of IFN-\u03bbR1. Composition and architecture of the interface that includes only a few direct hydrogen bonds support an idea that long-range ionic interactions between ligand and receptor govern the process of initial recognition of the molecules while hydrophobic interactions finalize it.",

For example, IFN-\u03bbs have been shown to inhibit infection by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) and the hepatitis B virus, 5,6 a number of respiratory viruses infecting epithelial cells (influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome), 7 and herpes simplex virus type 2 8 and cytomegalovirus (CMV). 9 Both type I and type III IFNs are co-produced by various nucleated cells in response to live viral infections and to a variety of stimuli (lipopolysaccharides, poly I:C, bacterial/viral DNA) triggering toll-like receptor signaling. 1 Moreover, both types of IFNs activate the same signal transduction pathways, including formation of the IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 transcription complex. 2 Both types of IFNs induce expression of the same set of genes 6, 10, 11 and, therefore, have very similar biological activities that include strong intrinsic antiviral activity. 1 However, whereas type I IFNs are able to activate a potent antiviral state in a wide variety of cells, 4, 12 type III IFNs are primarily active on epithelial cells. 13, 14 The cell-type selective action of type III IFNs is possible because each type of IFN engages its own unique receptor complex for signaling and because of the distinct expression pattern of IFN receptors. Type I IFNs signal through a common cellular IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor complex composed of two unique subunits, IFN-\u03b1R1 and IFN-\u03b1R2, which are ubiquitously expressed. 12, 15 However, type III IFNs signal through an IFN-\u03bb receptor complex, which consists of a unique IFN-\u03bbR1 chain and a shared IL-10R2 chain, the latter also being the second subunit of the IL-10, IL-22, and IL-26 receptor complexes. 1 In contrast to the ubiquitously expressed IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor subunits and the IL-10R2 chain, the IFN-\u03bbR1 chain is expressed primarily by epithelial cells and dendritic cells restricting action of type III IFNs to epithelial cells. 13 ,14 IL-10 has been shown to have low affinity for the IL-10R2 component of the receptor complex 16 and IFN-\u03bb1 is presumed to have low affinity for IL-10R2 as well.",

IFN-\u03bbs have been shown to reduce proliferation of several cancer cell lines such as the colorectal-cancer-derived HCT116 cells, 9 glioblastoma LN319 cells, 4 and aneuroendocrine BON1 tumor cells. 17 In certain esophageal cancer cell lines, it has been found that IFN-\u03bb1 can inhibit their growth through G1 phase arrest and have enhanced antitumor effects in combination with anticancer chemotherapeutics. 18 Other agents such as IFN-\u03b3 or the proteasome inhibitor Bortezomib can augment the antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of IFN-\u03bb in cancer cells. 19, 20 With the use of murine tumor models, IFN-\u03bb has been shown to inhibit the growth of MCA205 fibrosarcoma cells in vivo 21 and retard or suppress the growth of B16 melanoma cells 13, 22 and BNL hepatoma cells in mice. 23 These studies suggested that investigation of IFN-\u03bb could have benefits not only for treatment of viral diseases such as chronic hepatitis C but also as a cancer chemotherapeutic. Given the more limited expression of IFN-\u03bbR1 throughout the body, it is also likely that use of IFN-\u03bb as a treatment option would be generally tolerated better than treatment with more ubiquitously recognized IFNs, such as IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2.",

            "text": "All three known type III IFNs demonstrate limited amino acid similarity to both type I IFNs and IL-10related cytokines. 1, 12 On the other hand, the level of amino acid conservation is very high among members of the IFN-\u03bb family (96% similarity between IFN-\u03bb2 and IFN-\u03bb3), yet the activity of IFN-\u03bb3 and IFN-\u03bb2 differs by 16-fold, whereas IFN-\u03bb3 is 2-fold more active than IFN-\u03bb1. 24 Knowledge of the structural details of the IFN-\u03bb receptor complexes may provide insights into the differential activity of these cytokines. The known IFN and IL receptor subunits including IL-10R1 and IL-10R2 are structurally related, share a low degree of amino acid similarity in their extracellular domains (with the identity to IL-10R1 ranging from 11% to 13%), and belong to the family of class II cytokine receptors. 25, 26 Structures of several IFNs and IL-10 family members, as well as their dimeric and trimeric cytokine receptor complexes, have been elucidated by crystallography and NMR. [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] Structural information is available for the human and viral IL-10, 31,32 the latter from the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and CMV, as well as in complexes with IL-10R1. 16, 35, 36 IL-19 has had its structure determined in the absence of the receptor, 37 whereas IL-22 has been crystallized both alone 30, 38 and in complex with IL-22R1 39, 40 and IL-22BP. 41 All of the IL-10 receptor-ligand structures include a dimer of IL-10 binding to IL-10R1 in a 1:2 ratio. The ligand-receptor interface consists of residues residing on helix A, loop AB, and helix F of IL-10 and on inter-domain loops of IL-10R1, primarily stabilized by hydrophobic interactions. It has been suggested, based on the structure of IL-10 bound to IL-10R1, 35 that the receptor-binding site on IL-10 is shared by both IL-10R1 and IL-10R2. EBV IL-10 binds to IL-10R1 with 1000-fold lower affinity than IL-10 due to small changes in both EBV IL-10 positioning on IL-10R1 and inter-helix loops of EBV IL-10. 16 In contrast, CMV IL-10 exhibits affinity for IL-10R1 similar to IL-10 but differs in its inter-domain angle by 40\u00b0as compared to IL-10. 36 A model for binding of IL-10 to IL-10R1 and IL-10R2 has been proposed recently based on site-directed mutagenesis experiments, 28 updating the previously published model of the ternary IL-10/IL-10R1/IL-10R2 complex. 34 In addition, a model for the binding of CMV IL-10 to IL-10R1 and IL-10R2 has been proposed. 28 The crystal structure of isolated IFN-\u03bb3 has been determined recently. 29 It has shown the molecule to be a monomer highly similar to one domain of the domain-swapped IL-10 molecule, despite low sequence homology between the two proteins. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), some of which cause amino acid substitutions, within the type III IFN genomic locus are found in patients who spontaneously clear chronic HCV infection, as well as patients who respond well to IFN-\u03b1 treatment for HCV infection. [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] It is unknown how these variations affect the activity of the various members of the IFN-\u03bb family.",

The structures show a 1:1 complex between monomeric IFN-\u03bb1 and IFN-\u03bbR1, as opposed to the 1:2 complexes seen for IL-10/IL-10R1. The interface between the two proteins is highly hydrophobic in nature and the amino acid composition and bonding patterns suggest that electrostatic interactions may be responsible for initial ligand-receptor association, while hydrophobic interactions solidify the interaction. The overall folding of IFN-\u03bb1 and IFN-\u03bbR1 are similar to other cytokines and cytokine receptors, respectively, and the complex offers hints about how subtle variations between IFN-\u03bb1, IFN-\u03bb2 and IFN-\u03bb3 might influence the activity of the cytokines toward HCV.",

IFN-\u03bb1 used in crystallization experiments was expressed both in E. coli cells (IFN-\u03bb1 bac ) and in Drosophila cells (IFN-\u03bb1 ins ), whereas IFN-\u03bbR1 was expressed only in insect cells. 47 Both complexes were formed in a 1:1 molar ratio, purified, and crystallized. The details of expression, purification, crystallization, and data collection procedures have been previously described. 47 The crystal structures were solved using molecular replacement and revealed a complex consisting of IFN-\u03bb1 bound to IFN-\u03bbR1 in a 1:1 ratio.

            "text": "A molecule of IFN-\u03bb1 is composed of six helices (A-F; Fig. 1 ), with helices A, C, D, and F forming a classical up-up-down-down four-helix bundle. 48 Topologically, IFN-\u03bb1 is similar to IL-10 and to other members of the IL-10 family, particularly IL-19 37 and IL-22. 29, 38 A unique feature of the structure of IFN-\u03bb1 compared to the cytokines mentioned above is the absence of the short helix A\u2032 (which was not visualized in the electron density) preceding the main body of helix A. A similar feature has been found in the structure of IFN-\u03bb3, 29 whose amino acid sequence is 84% identical with IFN-\u03bb1, in spite of the fact that most of the differences were found at the N termini of the proteins, amino residues 1-13 ( Fig. 2 ). (Unless mentioned otherwise, IFN-\u03bb1 numbering has been used throughout this article.) IFN-\u03bb1 differs from the other two members of the type III IFN family by its pattern of disulfide bridges. Only five cysteines are present in IFN-\u03bb1, while IFN-\u03bb2 and IFN-\u03bb3 possess seven cysteines. The disulfides are formed in IFN-\u03bb1 between Cys49-Cys145 and Cys112-Cys171, whereas the disordered Cys15 is free. In IFN-\u03bb3, disulfide bridges are formed between Cys16 and Cys115, between Cys50 and Cys148, and between Cys167 and Cys174, whereas Cys48 is free in solution but makes an intermolecular disulfide bridge with Cys48 of a neighbor molecule in the crystal (IFN-\u03bb3 numbering). 29 Although the IFN-\u03bb1 used to make the IFN-\u03bb1 ins / IFN-\u03bbR1 crystals was produced in Drosophila S2 cells where N-linked glycosylation occurs, no evidence for its glycosylation at Asn46 was found in the electron density. This observation, however, is not a proof of the lack of glycosylation but most likely the result of the influence of the crystal-packing contacts between loop AB of IFN-\u03bb1 and helix D of a symmetrically related molecule that prevent the putative glycosylation at Asn46 from being visualized in the electron density.",

The domains are linked by a loop with a short helical turn in the middle of L7. An equivalent conformation was also found in other hematopoietic cytokine receptors and was labeled fibronectin type III domains. 50 The fibronectin type III domains are oriented with a domain angle of 112\u00b0to one another, with the ligand binding to the receptor at the apex between the two domains. The inter-domain angles were measured using C \u03b1 carbon positions of Glu104, Pro30, and His173 of IFN-\u03bbR1, which are equivalent to residues used to define the interdomain angle of IL-22R1. 39 The inter-domain angle is smaller than that reported for IL-22R1 but very another.

Second, the binding of IL-10 to its receptor may be influenced by the formation of dimers of IL-10. Given that the dimer of IL-10 is thought to be the functional form of the cytokine, the interaction with IL-10R1 may require a slightly different surface to accommodate IL-10.

When an alignment of the IFN-\u03bb1/IFN-\u03bbR1 complex to IL-10R1 or IL-22R1 is made using only IFN-\u03bbR1, the resulting position of IFN-\u03bb1 is drastically different from the modeled positions of cmvIL-10 or IL-22. As a result, IFN-\u03bb1 makes no contacts with IL-10R2 in its modeled position as part of the heterodimeric receptor complex. However, when the alignment of the IFN-\u03bb1/IFN-\u03bbR1 complex is made by matching IFN-\u03bb1 to cmvIL-10 or IL-22, IL-10R2 is positioned to make contacts with IFN-\u03bb1 (Supplemental Fig. S3a and S3b) .",

None of the variations occur at the interface between IFN-\u03bb1 and IL-10R2, with most of the residues modeled as exposed to solvent (Supplemental Fig. S3d ). This suggests that the IFN-\u03bb2/3 variations do not directly impact binding to either IFN-\u03bbR1 or IL-10R2 but rather indirectly impact binding to those receptor components through subtle rearrangements of IFN-\u03bb. These rearrangements of IFN-\u03bb may be enough to produce the 16-fold difference in activity seen between \u03bb2 and \u03bb3. 24 It is of interest to note that independent genome-wide association studies identified several SNPs within the region of the IFN-\u03bb3 gene, which were not only correlated with the spontaneous clearance of HCV 44 but also associated with sustained virologic response in patients with chronic HCV undergoing pegylated IFN-\u03b1/ribavirin combination therapy. [42] [43] [44] 46 These genetic variants within the IFN-\u03bb3 gene locus are likely to affect the level of expression and/or biological activity of IFN-\u03bb3. Interestingly, one of these SNPs causes substitution of Lys48 to Arg, representing the natural IFN-\u03bb2/3 variation. It remains to be studied whether this substitution affects receptor interaction and biological potency of IFN-\u03bb3.",

The structure of the complex suggests that long-range electrostatic interactions help to orient IFN-\u03bb1 for binding to IFN-\u03bbR1, while hydrophobic and nonpolar interactions solidify the interface between the ligand and the receptor. The structure offers insights into the phenotypes of IFN-\u03bb3 mutations in regard to its antiviral activity and suggests how variances between IFN-\u03bb members influence the differential antiviral activity of these cytokines.
