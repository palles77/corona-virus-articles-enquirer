Despite severe epidemic outbreaks on several occasions and lack of antiviral drug, not much progress has been made with regard to an epitope-based vaccine designed for HCoV. In this study, a computational approach was adopted to identify a multiepitope vaccine candidate against this virus that could be suitable to trigger a significant immune response. Sequences of the spike proteins were collected from a protein database and analyzed with an in silico tool, to identify the most immunogenic protein.",

Furthermore, conservancy analysis was also done using in silico tools and showed a conservancy of 64.29% for all epitopes. The peptide sequence could interact with as many as 16 human leukocyte antigens (HLAs) and showed high cumulative population coverage, ranging from 75.68% to 90.73%. The epitope was further tested for binding against the HLA molecules, using in silico docking techniques, to verify the binding cleft epitope interaction. The allergenicity of the epitopes was also evaluated. This computational study of design of an epitope-based peptide vaccine against HCoVs allows us to determine novel peptide antigen targets in spike proteins on intuitive grounds, albeit the preliminary results thereof require validation by in vitro and in vivo experiments.",

Usually, coronaviruses are classified into three groups (group I to III), based on their serological cross-reactivity. 3 Their classification is also supported by evolutionary analysis. 1 The group I viruses are animal pathogens, including porcine epidemic diarrhea virus and feline infectious peritonitis virus. The group II viruses are responsible for domestic animal pathogenic infections, and the final group III viruses are responsible for avian species infection. 4 However both the group I and group II viruses are considered HCoV. The protein molecules that usually contribute the structure of all coronaviruses are the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). HCoV is usually the causative agent of upper respiratory tract infections and also the causative agent of \"atypical pneumonia\", which was first identified in the People's Republic of China. 5 As nowadays, submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com",

The present conventional approach for vaccine development relies on antigen expression, in sufficient amount, from in vitro culture models; however, many antigens, while expressed sufficiently, may not be good candidates for vaccine. With these conventional approaches, it has not been possible to control different types of outbreaks of viral pathogens, such as recent avian and swine influenza strains, due to their time-consuming development process. Hence, the rapid in silico informaticsbased approach has gained much popularity with the recent advancement in the sequencing of many pathogen genomes and protein sequence databases. 8 The \"vaccinomics\" approach has already proven to be essential for combating diseases such as multiple sclerosis, 9 malaria, 10 and tumors. 11 However, these methods of vaccine development usually work through the identification of human leukocyte antigens (HLA) ligands and T cell epitopes, 12 which specify the selection of the potent vaccine candidates associated with the transporter of antigen presentation (TAP) molecules. [13] [14] [15] [16] Allergenicity assessment is one of the vital steps in the development of a peptide vaccine because when we provide the vaccine into the human body, it is detected as a foreign substance. As a result, inflammation occurs, demonstrating an allergic reaction. For the prediction of a B-cell epitope, hydrophilicity is an important criterion which is usually in the beta turns region. These assessments strengthen the possibility of the vaccine candidates. Therefore, our present study was undertaken to design an epitope-based peptide vaccine against HCoVs (229E, NL63, HKU1, EMC, and OC43) using the vaccinomics approach, with the wet lab researcher expected to validate our prediction.",

The region 73-95 (approximately 73-79 and 88-95) was considered as a \u03b2-turns region ( Figure 6 ). From the experimental evidence, it has been found that the flexibility of the peptide is correlated to antigenicity. 39 Hence, the Karplus and Schulz 34 flexibility prediction method was implemented. In this prediction method, the region of 75-95 was found to be the most flexible (Figure 7) . Finally, we launched the Bepipred linear epitope prediction tool. This program is based on a Hidden Markov model, the best single method for predicting linear B-cell epitopes. The result of analysis with this method is summarized in Figure 8 and Table 5 . By cross-referencing all the data, we predicted that the peptide sequences from 88-94 amino acids are capable of inducing the desired immune response as B cell epitopes. 48 etc has already been suggested. Though epitope-based vaccine design has become a familiar concept, in the case of HCoV there has not yet been much work done. The HCoV is an RNA virus, which tends to mutate more frequently than the DNA viruses. 49 These types of mutation mostly occur at the outer membrane protein, ie, at the spike protein. 50 These types of mutation increase the sustainability of the HCoVs, by ensuring their escape from both the cell-mediated and humoral immune responses. 51 Despite this, spike proteins have the most potential as a target for vaccine design because of their ability to induce a faster and longer-term mucosal immune response than that of the other proteins 52 and for this reason, has gained much popularity with researchers. 53, 54 From this aspect, a universal HCoV vaccine needs to be designed, in order to overcome the adverse effects of this viral infection. At present, vaccines are mostly based on B cell immunity. But recently, vaccine based on T cell epitope has been encouraged as the host can generate a strong immune response by CD8+ T cell against the infected cell. 55 With time, due to antigenic drift, any foreign particle can escape the antibody memory response; however, the T cell immune response often provides long-lasting immunity. Here, we predicted both B cell and T cell epitopes for conferring immunity in different ways, but other recent studies about HCoV represented the T cell epitope only, and we want to express our greater findings here. 56 There are several criteria that need to be fulfilled by a vaccine candidate epitope, and our predicted epitope fulfilled all the criteria. The initial criterion is the conservancy of the epitopes, which was measured by the IEDB conservancy analysis tool.

Having the same conservancy for all the epitopes, the KSSTGFVYF epitope possessed the highest amount of interactions with the HLA alleles. A very recent study showed a highly conserved sequence in RNA directed RNA polymerase of HCoVs; 56 nevertheless, our discovery of a spike protein with 64.29% conservancy among the 56 spike proteins has drawn much attention, and we consider this too as a epitope candidate for vaccine development. Population coverage is another important factor in the development of a vaccine. For the all predicted epitopes, the cumulative percentage of population coverage was measured. We found the highest population coverage in South Ireland, which was 90.73%, followed by Italy and North America, with 87.13% and 75.68% coverage, respectively. The HCoV was first found in Europe, 57,58 hence, we also observed the overall coverage in Europe and found this to be 82.59%. Oceania's region covered 79.08%. We also recorded 80. Kong, each year this virus caused about 224 hospitalizations per 100,000 population aged #6 years. 59 However, allergenicity is one of the prominent obstacles in vaccine development. Today, most vaccines stimulate the immune system into an \"allergic\" reaction, 60 through induction of type 2 T helper T (Th2) cells and immunoglobulin E (IgE). The AllerHunter score value is the probability that a particular sequence is a cross-reactive allergen. However, the threshold for prediction of allergen cross-reactivity is adjusted such that a sequence is predicted as a cross-reactive allergen if its probability is .0.06. Here, our proposed epitope's allergenicity score was 0.02, and thus it was considered as a nonallergen. According to the FAO/WHO evaluation scheme of allergenicity prediction, a sequence is potentially allergenic if it either has an identity of at least six contiguous amino acids or .35 percent sequence identity over a window of 80 amino acids when compared to known allergens. Hence, our query epitopes did ",
