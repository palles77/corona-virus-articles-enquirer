Tropical diseases contribute to significant mortality and morbidity. If diagnosed at the right time, tropical diseases have good prognosis too. Utilizing the useful function of supporting the cardio-pulmonary status in these critically ill disease states would save thousands of lives each year. As these diseases are not frequent in the West, apart from reporting the experiences in the form of an anecdotal case, much guidance is not available in their management. We hold the great responsibility of providing the world with guidance on managing these tropical diseases on ECMO. Some of the examples are: Severe malaria with ARDS, Tuberculosis with secondary infections, Typhus fevers, Rickettsiosis, ARDS in H1N1, Middle East Respiratory Distress Syndrome (MERS) virus and similar viral infections, Chagas disease, Legionellosis, Envenomations such as Scorpion sting with severe vaso-dilatory shock, Snake bites, Myocarditis due to Dengue, Diphtheria, Scrub typhus, Poisonings etc. The list could be longer and these patients could be supported with the underlying understanding of managing the reversible phase of these critically ill diseases with ECMO support when they don't respond to maximal conventional management (Table 1) .",

Besides the usual gram positive infections, increasing number of gram negative organisms are being reported as causative organisms. Management of multi-drug resistant strains and variability in availability of pure drug formulations might contribute to additional challenges. In-fact, infections are responsible for 20% increase in the mortality rate in ECMO outcomes compared to the western world [1] . When gas exchange can't be achieved with maximal conventional management, ECMO would be a potential option in these reversible conditions. In diseases such as Pulmonary/Miliary Tuberculosis, onset of secondary infections are sometimes responsible for life threatening ARDS. [5] are becoming increasingly noticeable as epidemics/endemics. Other known viral infections such as Respiratory Syncytial virus and Adenovirus are not only universally ubiquitous, but are also known to co-exist with other bacterial and viral infections.",
