            "text": "The Coronaviridae are a family of enveloped viruses with positive-sense, monopartite, single-46 stranded RNA genomes. At 27-32 kb, coronaviruses (CoVs) have the largest known RNA 47 lysis, caused stress-induced accumulation of ribosomes at the 5\u00b4 end of coding regions (CDSs; 103 [16] ). In this work, therefore, cells were not pretreated with CHX and were snap-frozen before lysis, 104 which avoids this artefact ( Table 1 ). Some of the most differentially transcribed cellular genes (ochre 113 points) are related to the host translational apparatus: Rplp1 -a ribosomal protein from the large 114 subunit; Eef1a1 -eukaryotic elongation factor 1A-1; Rps21 -a ribosomal protein from the small 115 subunit; Eif3f -eukaryotic initiation factor 3 subunit F; Eif3j1 -eukaryotic initiation factor 3 116 subunit J; and Eif2b3. This is also reflected in the gene ontology (GO) term enrichment analysis 117 ( Fig 1B; full results in Supplementary Table 2), which reveals that all GO terms enriched in the list 118 of genes significantly transcriptionally down-regulated in infection were related to protein synthesis 119 (blue points). 120 121 Several transcription-related genes were found to be transcriptionally up-regulated, for example 122 Polr2a, the gene coding for the largest subunit of RNA polymerase II (Fig 1A) . GO terms related to 123 transcription, for example \"transcription by RNAPII\" (GO:0006366), are also enriched in the up-124 regulated genes list. Many histones feature in the transcriptionally up-regulated gene list and, as 125 such, many histone-related GO terms are enriched in this list (Fig. 1B) . Significantly, the GO term 126 \"response to unfolded protein\" (GO:0006986) is enriched 4.85-fold in the list of genes 127 transcriptionally up-regulated during infection (p=0.046, FDR-adjusted p-value), with similar fold 128 6 changes observed for \"response to topologically incorrect protein\" (GO:0035966; 4.31-fold 129 enrichment; p=0.046) (Supplementary Table 2 ) and \"response to endoplasmic reticulum stress\" 130 (GO:0034976; 3.8-fold enrichment; p=0.012) (Fig 1B - note that these terms are clustered within 131 the \"response to unfolded protein\" GO term). Accordingly, some of the most differentially 132 expressed genes were involved in the UPR such as Herpud1 -homocysteine inducible ER protein 133 with ubiquitin like domain 1; Bip -immunoglobulin heavy chain-binding protein; Chac1 -134 glutathione-specific gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase 1; Chop -a C/EBP family transcription factor 135 involved in the ER stress response, and Xbp1 -X-Box Binding Protein 1 ( Fig 1A) . L19 (Rpl19), which has been reported to be unaffected by ER stress [22, 23] . Up-regulated 145 transcripts had qRT-PCR values broadly consistent with the RNASeq measurements ( Fig 1A and  146 1C) whereas there was a little more variation in the down-regulated transcripts, which may be partly 147 explained by the observation that Rpl19 itself was slightly, though not statistically significantly, 148 down-regulated (log 2 (fold change) = -0.34, p=0.37) (Fig 1A, yellow) . 149 150",

In some cases, for example Polr2a, the up-186 regulation of transcription is accompanied by down-regulation of TE (or vice versa); this leads to a 187 buffering effect that presumably results in relatively minor changes in protein levels. The top-centre 188 section of Fig. 2B shows genes that are transcriptionally up-regulated without any significant 189 change in TE (blue dots). Consistent with this, Chac1, Herpud1, Bip and Xbp1 are induced 190 transcriptionally by factors involved in UPR activation, but do not have increased TE as they are 191 not resistant to eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation [40-43]. Atf4, Slc35a4 and Atf5, in the lower right hand 192 quadrant of Fig 2B, are translationally resistant to p-eIF2\u03b1 but not transcriptionally induced by the 193 activation of UPR [32-36]. Gadd34 and Chop, in the upper right hand quadrant of Fig 2B, are both 194 translationally resistant to p-eIF2\u03b1 and transcriptionally induced by ATF4 [35,39,44-45]. However, 195 this transcriptional up-regulation is only statistically significant for Chop, setting it apart as a rare 196 example of a gene that is both transcriptionally and translationally up-regulated in MHV infection. 197 198 MHV infection and activation of the unfolded protein response 199 Although several studies [27, 46-48] have aimed to establish how each of the three UPR sensor 200 pathways may be involved during CoV infection, we wanted to take advantage of the data that 201 ribosome profiling provides to carry out a comprehensive analysis of specific arm of the UPR 202 response during MHV infection. In the mouse gene ontology database, the GO categories for each 203 of the three specific branches of the UPR activation, are too small for meaningful inclusion in the 204 enrichment analysis, probably due to incomplete annotation of these pathways in Mus musculus. In 205 order to analyse enrichment of UPR-related functions more thoroughly, lists of significantly 206 50]. Activated IRE1\u03b1 removes a 26-nt intron from unspliced Xbp-1 (Xbp-1u) mRNA 215 leading to a translational reading frame shift and a longer protein. The product of spliced Xbp-1 216 mRNA (XBP-1s) is an active transcription factor that up-regulates the expression of ER-associated 217 degradation (ERAD) components and ER chaperones. 17 Cl-1 cells were infected with MHV-A59 218 or incubated with tunicamycin, a pharmacological inducer of ER stress which activates all UPR 219 signalling pathways. Determination of Xbp-1 splicing was done by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-220 PCR) of total RNA extracted from 17 Cl-1 cells infected with MHV-A59 at 2.5, 5, 8 and 10 h p.i. or 221incubated with tunicamycin, using specific primers flanking the Xbp-1 splice site(Fig 3A). At all 222 timepoints, Xbp-1u was the predominant form in mock-infected cells whereas Xbp-1s was the major 223 species in tunicamycin-treated cells.

            "text": "-infected cells (MHV RiboSeq panels) and tunicamycin-treated cells (RiboSeq Tunicamycin 230 panel), an increased number of reads mapped in the +2 reading frame (yellow peaks) corresponding 231 to the Xbp-1u sequence, and downstream of the annotated main ORF stop codon (pink dashed line). of ER stress, ATF6 translocates from the ER to the Golgi apparatus where it is 235 cleaved by the proteases Site-1 (S1P) and Site-2 (S2P) [51]. After cleavage, the amino-terminus of 236 ATF6, containing a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transactivating domain, translocates to the nucleus 237 to up-regulate the ER chaperone immunoglobulin heavy chain binding protein (BiP). 17 Cl-1 cells 238 were infected with MHV-A59 or incubated with tunicamycin and analysed by Western blot for 239 ATF6 cleavage upon ER stress induction (Supplementary Figure 3A upper panel). However, we 240were unable to detect any differences in the blots of mock-infected, MHV-infected or tunicamycin-241 treated cells. Therefore, to analyse this UPR branch, we monitored BiP, whose mRNA or protein 242 levels serve as a proxy for activation of the ATF6 pathway (although its transcription caneventually 243 be regulated by other UPR factors such as XBP-1 and CHOP) [27,52]. Cells were harvested at 2.5, 244 5, 8 and 10 h p.i. and analysed by qRT-PCR in three biological replicates (plotted as the ratio of 245 transcription of BiP to the house-keeping gene Rpl19: Fig 3C). An increase in BiP transcription 246 compared to the house-keeping gene Rpl19 was observed in tunicamycin-treated (purple) and 247 MHV-infected cells (orange) from 2.5 to 8 h p.i. followed by a modest decline, whereas mock-248 infected cells (blue) showed no induction. Surprisingly, whereas Western blot analysis (Fig 3D) 249 confirmed induction of BiP protein in tunicamycin-treated cells by 8 h p.i., no such induction was 250 seen in MHV-infected cells. RNASeq and RiboSeq read counts of BiP at 5 and 8 h p.i. (Fig 2B and 251 Supp Fig 3B), revealed an increase in RNASeq reads in MHV-infected cells (Supplementary Figure 252 3B; Mock RNASeq compared to MHV RNASeq panels) consistent with the qRT-PCR results. 253 Although an expected increase in RPFs was seen in infection (Supplementary Figure 3B; MHV 254 RiboSeq panels), ribosome density was quite low in comparison to tunicamycin treated cells (6 h) 255 (Supplementary Figure 3B; RiboSeq Tunicamycin panel) and perhaps beyond the detection limit of 256 the immunoblots of Fig. 3D. inactive eIF2-GDP to active eIF2-GTP resulting in a general shutdown of protein 262 synthesis [54]. However, as previously described, translation of ATF4 is increased in this situation 263 [31,32,55] leading to the induction of its target gene Chop. To monitor activation of this pathway, 264 we analysed PERK, CHOP, ATF4 and p-eIF2\u03b1 expression by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. 17 265 Cl-1 cells were infected with MHV-A59 or incubated with tunicamycin for 2.5, 5, 8 and 10 h. As 266 shown in Fig 4A, Chop mRNA levels (measured as the Chop/RpL19 ratio) increased five-fold in 267 tunicamycin-treated cells (purple) compared to mock-infected cells (blue), and were stable over the 268 time course. In MHV-infected cells (orange), the ratio also increased from 2.5 to 8 h p.i. although 269 not to the level seen in tunicamycin-treated cells. Protein expression was determined by 270 immunoblotting using antibodies specific for MHV nucleocapsid protein (N), PERK, ATF4, p-271 eIF2\u03b1 and eIF2\u03b1, with GAPDH and eIF2\u03b1 as loading controls (Fig 4B). PERK, ATF4, p-eIF2\u03b1 and 272 eIF2\u03b1 ere at all time points in both tunicamycin-treated and MHV-infected cells (from 5 h p.i. 273 onwards). The multiple bands observed for PERK correspond to autophosphorylated species, 274 indicative of the activation of this kinase upon ER stress. To rule out the possibility that eIF2\u03b1 275 might also be phosphorylated as a response to protein kinase R (PKR) activation, we confirmed the 276 absence of phosphorylated PKR in Western blots (Supplementary Figure 3A, lower panel). 277 278 Subsequently, we analysed profiles of RiboSeq and RNASeq reads mapping to ATF4 in virus-279 infected and tunicamycin-treated cells (Fig 4C). Consistent with previous studies [31,32], 280 translation of the short (three codon) uORF1 (frame +2, yellow reads, nucleotides 399 to 407) was 281 observed under all conditions. In mock-infected cells, uORF2 was efficiently translated (Mock 282 RiboSeq panels; reads in yellow mapping to uORF2 indicated by a yellow rectangle, frame +2) thus 283 diverting scanning preinitiation ribosomes from accessing the main ORF (pink rectangle) to which 284 preinitation ribosomes were able to scan past uORF2 to translate the main ORF, leading 286 to a reduced density of ribosomes on uORF2 and a greatly increased number of RPFs mapping to 287 the main ORF. Tunicamycin-treated cells showed an intermediate ribosome distribution, but again 288 with efficient translation of the main ORF. 289 290 Polysome profiling of 17 Cl-1 cells infected with MHV-A59 291 Since total read counts are normalised by library size, ribosome profiling does not provide 292 information on total global translation levels. To further investigate virus-induced inhibition of 293 translation as a consequence of UPR activation and eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, analytical polysome 294 profiling (Fig 5A) was performed for mock-and MHV-infected 17 Cl-1 cells. Cytoplasmic extracts 295 were prepared in the presence of cycloheximide to retain intact monosomes and polysomes and 296 analysed by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. This revealed an accumulation of monosomes 297 (80S) in MHV-infected cells from 5 h p.i. onwards, consistent with inhibition of initiation. To 298 investigate whether the 80S ribosomes accumulating during MHV infection contain mRNA (as an 299 indicator of a translating ribosome), polysome profiling was repeated using a higher salt buffer (400 300 mM KCl; Fig 5B): a condition in which 80S ribosomes lacking mRNA dissociate into constituent 301 subunits. In mock-infected cells, a modest diminution of 80S levels was observed at 400 mM KCl 302 (mock 5 h, compare Fig 5A panel 2, and Fig 5B left panel), but a much greater reduction in 80S was 303 observed in MHV-infected cells (MHV 5 h p.i., compare Fig 5A panel 5 and Fig 5B right panel), 304 indicating that the vast majority of 80S ribosomes accumulating at this time point are not mRNA-305 associated. These data support the view that MHV-infection leads to translational shut-off via 306 inhibited initiation, consistent with the effects of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation. 307 308 Effect of the PERK inhibitor GSK-2606414 on MHV replication 309",

Despite the increased 319 virus protein synthesis, 17 Cl-1 cell monolayers infected with MHV-A59 in the presence of the 320 PERK inhibitor remarkably showed delayed formation of syncytia in comparison to untreated cells 321 at 8 h p.i.

            "text": "332 Determination of Xbp-1 splicing was carried out as earlier in MHV-infected cells at 5 h p.i. and 333 treated with different PERKi concentration. Xbp-1u was the predominant form in mock-infected 334 cells whereas Xbp-1s was the major species in MHV-infected cells in all cases (Fig 6F, used ribosome profiling and parallel RNASeq to investigate changes in the cellular 341 translatome and transcriptome in response to infection with MHV, a representative of the 342 Betacoronavirus genus of the Coronaviridae family. These studies provide the highest resolution 343 data to date on the translatome of cells during coronavirus-induced stress. 344 345 RNASeq libraries revealed that some of the most significantly up-regulated cellular transcripts in 346 virus-infected cells were part of the UPR (Herpud1 and Chac1) and changes in the translation 347 efficiency of cellular proteins were consistent with uORF-regulated responses to eIF2\u03b1 348 phosphorylation, including those previously implicated as effectors of the UPR such as Atf4, Atf5, 349Chop and Gadd34 [31-36,39]. These data confirm again that there is a close interplay between virus 350 infection and the UPR, with the host activating the UPR to combat the effects of virus infection, and 351 viruses sometimes manipulating the UPR to promote replication and pathogenesis [58-61]. The 352 intimate association of CoVs with the ER during replication results in ER stress responses as the 353 cell attempts to return to homeostasis [47, 62-66; reviewed in [67]). 354 355 The relative modulation of UPR branches differs between different CoVs [3,5,67]. For example, 356 SARS-CoV infection does not lead to Xbp-1 splicing [47] whereas the IRE1 pathway is activated by 357 infectious bronchitis virus or MHV infection or by MHV S protein overexpression [27,68]. In spite 358 of the observed Xbp-1 mRNA splicing during MHV infection [27], Xbp-1s protein had not 359 previously been detected in coronavirus-infected cells. In our study (5 and 8 h p.i. data sets)the ATF6 pathway by CoV infection has not yet been fully addressed. ATF6 cleavage 364 into its active form is observed during MHV infection but is significantly reduced at late time points 365 [27] although we could not detect the cleavage of this transcription factor by western blotting. In 366 addition, the trimmed ATF6 form is not detected in SARS-CoV infected cells [69]. Furthermore, 367ER stress-responsive promoters exhibit little activity under these conditions. In the present study, an 368 induction of BiP transcription due to ATF6 activation was observed to a similar extent in both369 tunicamycin-treated and MHV-infected cells, whereas BiP protein expression was only detected by 370 western blotting in tunicamycin-treated cells. Ribosome profiling data revealed that, in virus-371 infected cells, the level of RPFs corresponding to the BiP CDS was not as high as in tunicamycin-372 treated cells and this was probably the reason why this protein was not detected by western blot 373 analysis, although we can not rule out that BiP protein can be degraded as a response to MHV-374 infection at a post-translational stage. 375 376 With respect to UPR-related inhibition mediated by eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation, it has been shown that 377 infectious bronchitis virus activates or suppresses protein kinase RNA-activated (PKR) and PERK 378 during the course of an infection [70] whereas transmissible gastroenteritis virus protein 7 emulates 379 the function of DNA damage-inducible protein 34 (GADD34) to dephosphorylate eIF2\u03b1 [71]. Our 380 study reveals that MHV-A59 infection increases the level of p-eIF2\u03b1 and ATF4 from 5 h p.i. 381 onwards. The RiboSeq data also revealed decreased translation of the Atf4 uORF2 at 5 and 8 h p.i. 382 and a concomitant increase in translation of the main ORF. Although Bechill and colleagues [27] 383 failed to detect the products of ATF4 target genes, Gadd34 and Chop, during MHV infection by 384 western blotting, we found evidence supporting an increase in translation of Gadd34 and both 385 transcription and translation of Chop at later time points p.HR1) and PKR. Up to 5 \u00b5M of this inhibitor was well tolerated by 17 Cl-1 cells and, in 390 MHV-infected cells, the prevention of eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation alleviated the inhibition in translation 391 of cellular and viral proteins as expected. Surprisingly, the higher content of viral proteins did not 392 lead to a more prominent cytopathic effect but instead delayed syncytia formation and reduced viral 393 titre. Therefore, we conclude that UPR-mediated eIF2\u03b1 phosphorylation may be favourable to 394 MHV replication -perhaps by preventing translation of various anti-viral factors -and the 395 pharmacological manipulation of this UPR branch can be explored as a potential target for antiviral 396 intervention. Also, it will be interesting to investigate a potential additional role of this PERK 397 inhibitor in the translocation of the spike (S) protein and in the regulation of the assembly of MHVprovides information on initiating and elongating 80S ribosomes but (without 401 modification) it does not report on free monosomes nor small subunits at early stages in initiation 402 prior to formation of 80S complexes. Analytical polysome profiling showed an accumulation of 403 80S monosomes in MHV-infected cells from 5 h p.i. with the vast majority not being associated 404 with mRNA which is a typical outcome of impaired translation [72]. This suggests that protein 405 translation was inhibited at the stage of initiation probably due to the activation of the PERK branch 406 in response to ER stress and the concomitant phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 which can be alleviated by 407 treating MHV infected cells with an specific PERK inhibitor. Phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 (p-eIF2\u03b1) 408 forms a stable complex with eIF2B -the guanine exchange factor responsible for recycling inactive 409 eIF2-GDP to eIF2-GTP -which rapidly reduces the pool of available eIF2B. This prevents 410 recycling of the ternary complex of eIF2, GTP and Met-tRNAi and formation of the 43S pre-411 employ translational shutoff mechanisms to facilitate viral replication. On the 415 one hand, shut-off of host cell translation can redirect the translation machinery towards viral gene 416 expression if the virus has evolved non-canonical modes of translation, such as internal ribosome 417 entry site (IRES) mediated initiation. On the other hand, the shut-off of host cell protein synthesis 418 will inhibit a range of cellular anti-viral responses. Previous studies have shown that MHV can 419 induce host translational shutoff and mRNA decay in LR7 cells with the concomitant formation of 420 stress granules and processing bodies [26]. Furthermore, a number of reports have demonstrated 421 that CoV nsp1, the most N-terminal product of the replicase polyprotein, modulates host protein 422 synthesis. In different CoVs, nsp1 has been shown to associate with the 40S ribosomal subunit thus 423 preventing viral and cellular mRNA translation; induce cellular mRNA degradation via an 424 endonucleolytic mRNA cleavage in the 5\u2032 region of capped mRNA; and selectively target nuclear 425 host mRNAs and transport them to the cytoplasm for degradation [28-29,74-75]. The involvement 426 of nsp1 in host protein translation could not be ruled out in this study without a comparison with a 427 mutant virus lacking nsp1. However, the UPR-related translational modulation and the CoV nsp1-428 related modification of translation (and mRNA degradation) testify to the complexity of cellular 429 translational shutoff mechanisms utilised by CoVs. How MHV proteins can be synthesised in a 430 state of global translation inhibition has been the subject of previous speculation. Viral mRNAs 431 contain a common 5\u2032-leader sequence (65-90 nucleotides long) that could bind to the nucleocapsid 432 (N) protein to form a complex that might act as a strong translation initiation signal [76], or the 433 leader RNA sequence may bind to nsp1, protecting the viral mRNAs from nsp1-induced RNA 434 cleavage [75,77]. However, we found previously that virus mRNAs 2-7 were translated with 435 generally similar efficiencies during infection and, importantly, were not preferentially translated , this study provides a survey of coronavirus effects on the cellular transcriptome and 440 translatome, complementing previous investigations on the UPR and host cell shutoff during MHV 441 infection. The results of our analyses will help inform further investigations on host-CoV 442 interactions and several differentially expressed genes identified may help identify new targets vol/vol) fetal calf serum (FCS). Recombinant MHV strain A59 (MHV-A59) was derived as 451 previously described ([78], a kind gift of Dr Stanley Sawicki, University of Toledo, ATCC VR764). 452 Upon reaching 70-80% confluence, 17 Cl-1 cells were infected with MHV-A59 at MOI 10 in 453 infection medium [Hank's balanced salt solution (HBSS) containing 50 \u00b5g/ml DEAE-dextran and 454 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA)]. After 45 min at 37 \u00baC, the inoculum was removed and the cells 455 were incubated in DMEM containing 10% FCS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 \u00b5g/ml streptomycin at 456 37 \u00baC until harvest. 457 For the tunicamycin experiments, 17 Cl-1 cells were incubated in the presence of tunicamycin (2 458 \u00b5g/ml). 17 Cl-1 mock and MHV-infected cells were treated with different concentrations (1-5 \u00b5M) 459 of the PERK-inhibitor GSK-2606414 (PERKi), a kind gift of Dr Edward Emmott and Prof Ian 460 Goodfellow. PERKi was added to the cells just after the adsorption time and maintained until cells 461 were harvested. 462 463 Ribosomal profiling and RNASeq data: 17 Cl-1 cells were grown on 100-mm dishes to 90% 464 confluency and infected with MHV-A59 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. At indicated h 465 p.i., cells were rinsed with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS, flash frozen in a dry ice/ethanol bath and lysed 466 with 400 \u03bc l of lysis buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl 2 , 1 mM DTT, 1% 467 Triton X-100, 100 \u03bc g/ml cycloheximide and 25 U/ml TURBO DNase (Life Technologies)]. For the 468 tunicamycin experiments, 17 Cl-1 cells were incubated in the presence of tunicamycin (2 \u00b5g/ml) 469 and, after 6 h, cells were rinsed with 5 ml of ice-cold PBS and then flash frozen. The cells were 470 scraped extensively to ensure lysis, collected and triturated ten times with a 26-G needle. Cell 471 lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 13,000 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. Lysates were subjected to 472 Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq based on previously reported protocols [16,79]. Ribosomal RNA was 473 the very large amounts of vRNA produced during infection, mock samples were processed 477 separately from infected samples to avoid contamination. Ribo-Seq and RNA-Seq sequencing data 478 have been deposited in ArrayExpress (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress) under the accession 479 numbers E-MTAB-5391 and E-MTAB-6278. 480 481 Computational analysis of RiboSeq and RNASeq data: Reads were trimmed for adaptor 482 sequences, filtered for length > 25 nt, and reads mapping to Mus musculus rRNA (downloaded from 483 SILVA database) or MHV-A59 viral RNA (AY700211.1) (with up to 2 mismatches) removed, as 484previously described[16]. The remaining reads were aligned directly to the mouse genome (FASTA 485 and GTF gencode release M20, GRCm38, primary assembly) (with up to 2 ) [80]. Reads on protein-coding genes were tabulated using htseq-488 count (version 0.9.1), covering the whole gene for differential transcription analysis (parameters: -a 489 0 -m union -s yes -t gene) and just the CDS for the translation efficiency analysis (parameters: 490 htseq-count -a 0 -m intersection-strict -s yes -t CDS) , using the GTF file from the above gencode 491 release as the gene feature annotation [81].
