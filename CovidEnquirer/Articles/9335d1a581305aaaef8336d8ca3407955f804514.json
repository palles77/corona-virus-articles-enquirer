The whole process includes participants' communication and information sharing, opinions collection, knowledge acquisition, interaction between participants for idea generation, etc. Studies on computerized support for group activities since 1990s have begun to emphasize on explorations of procedural rationality, especially on argumentation and sense-making during problem-structuring process. Typical methods and tools include Dialog Mapping (gIbIS-based QuestMap, CogNexus Institute, California, USA), Cogni-tive Mapping (Decision Explorer, Banxia, Kendal, Cumbria, UK; Group Explorer, Phrontis, Banbury, Oxon, UK), Augmented Informative Discussion Environment (AIDE, ATR, Kyoto, Japan), etc. These tools reflect a trend toward supporting thinking visualization and generation of ideas for complex and wicked issues, such as applying brainstorming, cognitive mapping or voting to acquire scenarios, from where to conduct in-depth analysis, and modeling for final solutions of problems [1] . How to support group interaction to generate ideas is one of the most difficult areas among group support research. Group argumentation environment (GAE) is a type of distributed computerized tool designed to facilitate idea generation or knowledge creation during group-divergent thinking.",

Following are some typical applications and experiments, 1) XiangShan Science Conference [4, 6] 2) Analysis of various academic workshops, such as CSM'2003 and special session on meta-synthesis held at International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis on September 11, 2003 , the Workshop on Complexity of War held on October 17, 2003, the Sino-Japan Workshop on Meta-synthesis and Creativity Support Systems (MCSS'2005) held in Beijing on July 11-12, 2005, etc. 3) Faculty discussion on new policies toward the project management at Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science (AMSS) [7] 4) Analysis of the achievements of a major project on meta-synthesis study supported by Natural Sciences Foundation of China (NSFC) [8] 5) Workshop on Emergency Management for the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) crisis (held on June 6, 2003, and analyzed on January, 2005) 6) AMSS meeting on Strategic Development (April, 2005) 7) AMSS meeting on graduate education (May, 2006) All the above applications are mainly postanalysis of the event. The authors had attended some of the events. By various records of these meetings (such as audio records, paper notes, and newsletters), the process of these discussions is generated and specific tasks of mining and visualization are conducted. When GAE is applied to the analysis of the NSFC major project, the authors of study are \"participants\" of the discussion, the title of the paper is one utterance of the author, the given keywords of the paper are the keyword set of one utterance, and publishing time could be regarded as the addressing time. Thus, the group discussion about the meta-synthesis study is generated by all publications during the project period. All these trials help to test the functions of GAE and to bring out several further improvements. As a matter of course, GAE is originally designed to support online group argumentation. It is desperately expected to observe its various functions by online discussion process for feedback and effects. Subsequently, a real online experiment with GAE is addressed.",

That social event was invoked by Japan's bid for a permanent seat in the UN Security Council during the UN reform movement. The financial contributions to the UN budget and to the developing nations in the form of official development assistance are main reasons for Japan's bid. Because of the privileges of the UN Security Council and the historical reasons, various mass protests were held across many domestic cities in China. Also, there was a large-scale online voting, such as in sina.com.

Automatic affinity diagramming at GAE-BAR maps the whole utterance set into 16\u00d716 (or 8\u00d78, 24\u00d724) cells based on their spatial correspondence relationship shown at the personal viewer. The utterances which fall into same cell are regarded as one cluster. The number of utterances within one cell may reflect the density of viewpoints regarding the ideas. Thus, users can acquire a rough grouping regarding these viewpoints contributed by participants. Human analysts can go further and can refine such divergent thinking results, such as merging some adjacent groups with close contents and undertaking basic summarization, which may be extended as qualitative assumptions hypotheses about concerned topics. Figure 3 (d) is the affinity diagramming resulting from the spatial map as shown in Figure 3(a) . It could be seen that the utterances in one cell are related to each other. For example, all 10 utterances within cell [row=8, col=10] and four utterances within cell [row=8, col=11] are about some strategies and advice toward opposing the Japan's bid for a permanent seat in the UN Security Council , both cells could be then grouped into a single cluster. So are to cell [row=9, col=9] with eight utterances and cell [row=10, col=9] with four utterances, which reflect concerns on strategies regarding economic issues, such as \"boycott of Japanese goods\".",

Each utterance then corresponds to a complete graph. The aggregation of these graphs of all utterances leads to a keyword network of the concerned discussion, which may be viewed as a knowledge topology map. Network characteristics can then be acquired, such as component, cutpoint and subgroups [3, 10] for in-depth analysis from the perspective of complex networks. Fig.4 shows the keyword network of this experiment. Several cutpoints detected, such as \"Boycott of Japanese Goods\", \"Government Intervention\", and \"Improving the Competitiveness\" could be regarded as important ideas emerged by the group discussion. With the community (subgroup) of keywords detected from this network, more insights toward these concerned topics may be acquired together with clustering of keywords and affinity diagramming.
