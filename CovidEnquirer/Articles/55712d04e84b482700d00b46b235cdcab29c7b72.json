            "text": "The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was used to determine levels of specific IgG antibodies against measles, rubella, vaccinia, corona (OC43) and mumps viruses in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum of 18 patients with clinically definite multiple sclerosis (MS), 8 patients with optic neuritis (ON), 27 patients with other neurological disease (OND), and 88 control subjects without central nervous system disease. Serum antibody levels were not significantly different between the four groups. Differences in the frequency and levels of CSF antibodies between the four groups were observed. Control patients had serum/CSF antibody ratios from 2.0 to 3.0 (log) with an average of 2.5 corresponding to a 320-fold difference between serum and CSF antibody levels. MS patients had ratios from 1.1 to 2.1 with an average of 1.6. The average was 2.0 for the ON patients. The average for the OND patients was similar to the controls. The altered serum/CSF ratios for several viruses within an individual patient was similar. These results suggest that nonspecific immunostimulation is responsible for the increased levels of CSF virus antibodies. INTRODUCTION Increased antibody titers against several viruses have been lbund in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. The most constant finding has been elevated levels of measles antibodies but elevated rubella, herpes simplex, vaccinia and mumps antibodies also have been found (Haire 1977; Norrby 1978) . The relative amount of CSF antibodies compared to serum antibody levels is higher in many MS patients than in most controls and has been associated with an intrathecal synthesis of antibodies (Frick and Sheid-Seydel 1958; Tourtellotte and Parker 1966; Norrby 1978) . However, the low sensitivity of conventional serological techniques has limited the evaluation of CSF antibody levels in normal controls due to the low amounts of antiviral antibodies present. We have recently developed a sensitive enzyme immunoassay for virus antibodies (Leinikki and P~issil~i 1976; Leinikki et al. 1978) . By using this technique, we studied the occurrence and levels of CSF antibodies against unrelated viral antigens in MS and control groups.",

The role and evolution of viral antibodies in the CSF of MS patients is not understood. The diversity of the viral agents that have been implicated in MS makes it improbable that any of these agents or some cross-reacting, unknown agent would cause the simultaneous multiple antibody stimulus observed in this study. The best explanation is that the viral antibodies produced within the CNS of MS patients are related to the immunopathophysiology of the disease rather than a specific etiology. Altered serum/CSF virus antibody ratios have also been occasionally detected among patients with other neurological diseases (Norrby 1978; Iivanainen et al. 1981) . In diseases such as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) the serum/CSF antibody ratio is exclusively altered for measles virus antibodies (P. Leinikki, D. McFarlin, I. Shekarchi and J.
