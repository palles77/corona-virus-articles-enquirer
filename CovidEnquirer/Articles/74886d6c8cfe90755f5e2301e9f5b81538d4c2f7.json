Among RNA templates, hepatitis C virus (HCV) represents an excellent example to challenge the potential of LRP technology due to its extensive secondary structures and its difficulty to be readily cultured in vitro. The only source for viral genome amplification is clinical samples in which HCV is usually present at low titers. We have created a comprehensive optimization protocol that allows robust amplification of a 9.1 kb fragment of HCV, followed by efficient cloning into a novel vector. Detailed analyses indicate the lack of potential LRPmediated recombination and the preservation of viral diversity. Thus, our LRP protocol could be applied for the amplification of other difficult RNA templates and may facilitate RNA virus research such as linked viral mutations and reverse genetics.",

            "text": "Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is an indispensable technique in biomedical research. With known primer sequences, it can easily amplify a DNA target less than 3 kb but it has diminished power when the target is larger than 3 kb. In 1994, Barnes et al. [1] first hypothesized that the inability to amplify large DNA fragments was due to the misincorporation of nucleotides by most thermostable DNA polymerases, which resulted in premature termination of PCR. Based on this hypothesis, mixed polymerases, one of which has 3 0 -5 0 exonuclease ''proofreading'' activity to correct the misincorporation, have successfully amplified DNA targets up to 42 kb [2] . However, there has been limited success in applying this concept to the amplification of large RNA genomes that require the reverse transcription (RT) step prior to PCR amplification. Compared to the amplification of DNA targets, it is reasonable to hypothesize that the RT step is of crucial importance during long RT-PCR (LRP) performance when taking into account the following characteristics. First, in most situations, the solution buffers are not compatible between RT and PCR. Only part of the RT reaction can be used for subsequent PCR and thus reduces the sensitivity dramatically. Second, most RT enzymes have an inhibitory role for thermostable DNA polymerases [3] . Third, RT is conducted at temperatures ranging from 37\u00b0C to 50\u00b0C at which the RNA template may retain its secondary structure that makes RT stop prematurely. Such situations are even more challenging when trying to amplify full-length hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome, a positive sense single-strand RNA virus in the family of flavirividae. There is extensive secondary structure along the whole HCV genome [4] [5] [6] . Furthermore, HCV cannot be cultured in vitro. The only source of RNA template for LRP is clinical samples in which HCV has a low titer. In the present study, we have investigated each step for the LRP procedure and developed a robust ",

In some experiments, we mixed a RT enzyme with Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene), a similar strategy as used in long PCR, to improve full-length cDNA synthesis [8] . Second, previous studies showed certain chemicals might improve full-length cDNA synthesis in both quantity and quality. In this study, we tried different additives at various concentrations, including DMSO (5-10%) (Sigma), GC-Melt (0.5 M) (BD Biosciences), DTT (5-10 mM), trehalose (0.6 M) (Sigma) [9] , and betaine (2 M) (Sigma) [9] . Third, we designed a series of HCVspecific RT primers located at the 3 0 end of NS5B (Table 1 ). These primers were tested for efficient priming at different concentrations. Fourth, besides direct application of RT reaction in subsequent PCR, we also tried to purify RT reaction with or without RNase H digestion [11] prior to PCR, by using QIAquick PCR Purification Kit or QIAquick Nucleotide Removal Kit (Qiagen) or Dynabeads KilobaseBIND-ER Kit (Dynal) in which RT primers were biotinylated at their 5 0 ends. Finally, we also investigated the role of 7-deaza-2 0 -deoxyguanosine (Sigma) in the RT reaction that may improve the elongation in GC-rich domains [10] .",

Several groups have performed nested PCR of HCV 5 0 UTR after RT step, assuming a positive result as the indicator of full-length HCV cDNA synthesis. However, we found that multiple domains, located within 5 0 UTR, Core, E2, NS3, NS5a, and NS5b, respectively, could be successfully amplified after RT in which RT primers were omitted. This indicated the existence of extensive self-priming during RT presumably induced by HCV RNA secondary structure or oligonucleotides in extracted RNA template. Using the DNA Thermal Cycler 480, the whole procedure for LRP takes at least 2 days. We therefore amplified multiple small fragments (5 0 UTR, HVR1, NS3, NS5a, and NS5b) ( Table 1 ) by using the first round LRP product as the template. After the first round LRP, the effect of self-priming is reduced. The negative amplification of these small fragments indicated the absolute absence of full-length HCV cDNA and thus the second round LRP is not necessary. To test all LRP conditions and parameters alone or in combination, the optimization procedure consists of hundreds of protocols. Our approach that monitors the full-length cDNA synthesis based on first round PCR product, although not perfect, still improves experimental progress significantly.",

SuperScript III outperformed all other reverse transcriptases such as AMV, M-MLV, Expand Reverse Transcriptase, Transcriptor Reverse Transcriptase, SuperScript II, and rTth DNA polymerase. Robust LRP results were obtained when running RT with 200 U of SuperScript III at 50\u00b0C for 75 min, followed by inactivation at 70\u00b0C for 15 min. However, using a mixture of SuperScript III (200 U) and AMV (2.5 U) gave LRP results that were much more reproducible, with an increased yield. LRP was not successful using a mixture of RT enzyme and Pfu DNA polymerase, perhaps because the latter had low activity (<30%) in a nonoptimized buffer system under RT temperature (50\u00b0C) (Stratagene, personal communication). 2. All additives (except DTT) that we tested in the RT reaction had an adverse role for LRP. Although these additives have been reported to improve full-length cDNA synthesis, they may be not compatible with SuperScript III or rTth XL DNA polymerase. 3. The selection of RT primers is critical for successful LRP. The most satisfactory and reproducible results were obtained only when using QR2 as the RT primer (Table 1) . Interestingly, LRP did not work when replac-ing QR2 with QR264 or QR274, suggesting an appropriate T m value of RT primers was required. However, LRP failed when modifying other RT primers into a similar T m value as QR2. In contrast, reproducible amplifications were obtained with other serum samples in which QR2 had one or two nucleotide substitutions. These observations suggest that efficient priming for full-length HCV cDNA synthesis is domain-dependent. Additionally, unlike previous reports [30] , our LRP is acceptable with QR2 in broad range of concentrations from 0.0625 lM to 1 lM. 4. There was no obvious advantage but a reduced sensitivity when purifying RT reaction by using Qiagen spin columns or Dynabeads. Similarly, the use of 7-deaza-2 0 -deoxyguanosine in RT reaction or RNase H digestion was not advantageous.",

This makes it potentially promising to reconcile the two buffer systems, but information about additional buffer components is not available and therefore optimization cannot be performed. There was no improvement and sometimes even an adverse effect of other measures including the addition of additives (DMSO, betaine, and TMA oxalate) and the use of phosphorothioate or loop incorporated primers. However, Trnc-21, an oligonucleoide inhibitor to rTth DNA polymerase, was required for reproducible amplification. The minimum concentration of Trnc-21 is 0.4 lM.

            "text": "Long RT-PCR has been successfully used to amplify large or near full-length domains of RNA viruses, including human coronavirus [30] , poliovirus [34] , borna disease virus [35] , porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus [36] , coxsackievirus [37] , and hepatitis E virus [38] . It has also been applied to the amplification of cellular RNA derived from such genes as the neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) and polycystic kidney disease 1 (PKD1) genes [39, 40] . In these studies, a common feature was the availability of good RNA templates in both quantity and quality. In contrast, HCV cannot be easily cultured in vitro although there are recent reports of the establishment of HCV cell culture by using a special HCV genotype 2a strain JFH-1 [41] [42] [43] . Clinical samples from patients infected with HCV have a relatively low titer of viral RNA level. In addition, HCV holds a strong structure along with the whole genome [4] [5] [6] . These features may explain the limited success of LRP with HCV. While there have been occasional reports regarding the amplification of near full-length HCV genome [44, 45] , reproducible results were only obtained with the amplification of less than 5 kb fragments in HCV [7, 33, 46, 47] . In contrast, the protocol we have described here has considerable robustness. Besides the two serum samples that we used for optimizing our protocols, we successfully amplified a near full-length HCV genome from an additional 24 patient samples infected with HCV genotype 1a. We identified several critical factors for efficient amplification of a near full-length HCV genome. First, the RT step was conducted by using mixed enzymes, SuperScript III and AMV. SuperScript III is a mutant form of SuperScript II, which makes it fully active at temperature as high as 55\u00b0C. Potential RNA secondary structure could be melted at this temperature. However, incubation at 55\u00b0C resulted in decreased sensitivity perhaps due to the partial degradation of the RNA templates.",

            "text": "In the optimized protocol, we used 50\u00b0C for the RT reaction. It has been reported that AMV especially favors the reverse transcription of genes with GC-rich domains or strong secondary structure due to its stability at higher temperatures. It is not known how these two enzymes work together, but similar cooperativity has been observed for mixed DNA polymerases in long PCR [1] . In any case, we demonstrated that mixed RT enzymes improve fulllength HCV cDNA synthesis in both quality and quantity. Second, not all primers can effectively prime the synthesis of full-length HCV cDNA. In our experiments, only one primer, QR2, met this requirement, indicating the fulllength HCV cDNA synthesis is considerably dependent on the appropriate priming site. To some extent, this observation is consistent with a previous report in which differential priming of RNA templates resulted in obvious differences in both accuracy and reproducibility of RT-PCR [48] . Third, the use of Trnc-21 in PCR steps is recommended. Inclusion of Trnc-21 resulted in automated hot-start PCR amplification. Although there are several techniques available for the initiation of ''hot-start'' PCR, such as manual control, the use of wax, and the addition of antibodies to thermal stable DNA ploymerases, none of them is as efficient and convenient as Trnc-21. Finally, the primers for PCR procedures should have appropriate T m values dependent on the annealing/elongation temperatures. Our last optimization step for successful LRP was to raise the annealing/elongation temperature to 72\u00b0C in the second round of PCR, around 5\u00b0C above the primer T m values. The large difference between annealing/elongation temperatures and primer T m values resulted in non-specific amplification while a low annealing/elongation temperature less than 60\u00b0C always abrogated the amplification. There are two salient features for our LRP procedure: the lack of detectable recombination and the preservation of viral diversity, as estimated with samples LIV19 and LIV23. Recombination is generally explained by template switching during PCR, particularly when the synthesis of complementary strands is stopped prematurely. The lack of detectable recombination in our LRP protocol may have contributed to the reduced cycle numbers (60 cycles versus regular 70 cycles) and Vent DNA polymerase that is included within rTth DNA polymerase, XL, and has 3 0 -5 0 exonuclease proofreading activity. The HVR1 is located at the 5 0 end of HCV E2 domain and is the most variable region along the entire HCV genome. By comparing genetic parameters for HVR1 quasispecies profiles, our LRP protocol preserves viral heterogeneity, as also reported with a 5 kb HCV amplicon [33] . Furthermore, similar HVR1 quasispecies lineages were obtained with sample LIV19 while sample LIV23 displayed much different HVR1 quasispecies lineages derived from either the 1.38 kb or the 9.1 kb amplicon. By using clones as direct PCR templates, we failed to amplify HVR1 domain by screening 40 clones that had no correct insert confirmed with enzyme digestion after miniculture (data not shown). This excludes the possibility for the loss of potential HVR1 quasispecies lineages during the culture due to the instability of recombinant clones. Thus, these results again emphasize the bias of HVR1 quasispecies amplification when using different primer pairs as we previously reported [49] . Still, defective interfering particles (DIP) are another factor to be taken into account. The generation of DIP, natural viral mutants with large deletions in the genome, seems to be a general phenomenon for all viruses, including HCV [50, 51] . Quasispecies profiles contributed by DIP could be lost in our protocol since we gel purified only the 9.1 kb fragment prior to cloning. Taken together, the quantitation of viral diversity, if present at a high level within a given sample, is largely underestimated and/or biased by current protocols for PCR amplification and cloning.",

            "text": "The technology described here should be applicable to other HCV genotypes as well as other RNA viruses such as GB virus C, HIV, and dengue virus. With the amplification and efficient cloning of a near full-length viral genome, it is now possible to study linked mutations at genomewide scale. Linked mutation is a common strategy exploited by viruses to counter their loss of the fitness resulting from point mutations at immune and/or drug targets. The identification of common patterns of linked mutation is helpful for the improvement of combinational antiviral strategies. In addition, our LRP protocol preserves HCV diversity and has no detectable recombination induced by PCR. These characteristics make it possible to isolate dominant, subdominant, and minor viral variants within a complex virus population, which facilitates the approach of reverse genetics. An initial step in reverse genetics is to construct vectors containing full-length viral genomes, usually assembled by overlapped PCR products that represent viral consensus sequences. However, the consensus sequence is artificial in concept and is not necessarily the dominant viral variant. As a result, replication from infectious clones with consensus viral genome may not occur. This may partially explain why the infectious HCV clone of H77 consensus did not replicate in cell culture while the one with JHF1 did [41] [42] [43] . In contrast to the existence of multiple HVR1 quasispecies lineages in the patient H77 [52] , JHF1 was derived from a patient with fulminant hepatitis. The immunocomprised status in this patient resulted in an extremely homogeneous viral population by cloning analysis of HVR1 domain [53] . In such a situation, consensus viral sequence may be equal to authentic dominant viral variant that makes an ''infectious'' clone infectious. Fig. 4 . A representative neighbor-joining (NJ) tree constructed based on HCV E1 domain of 20 clones derived from 9.1 kb LRP product, which was amplified using mixed serum from samples LIV19 and LIV23. As expected, all clones are clustered into two groups, LIV19 and LIV23. There is no contradictory clustering for each clone in trees constructed with other seven domains, indicating the lack of LRP-mediated recombination.",
