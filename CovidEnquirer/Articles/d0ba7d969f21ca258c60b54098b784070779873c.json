The antibody was raised by intramuscular immunization to 10 White Leghorn hens, with inactivated human EV71 serving as the antigen. The titer and specificity of the antibody were analyzed from purified IgY in the egg yolks of immunized hens. Results indicate that the titer of IgY specific against EV71 increased from the third week after the first immunization. The content of total IgY was 190 \u00b1 26 mg/yolk, with an average concentration of specific IgY of 6.34 \u00b1 3.38 mg/yolk in the eggs from 3 to 18 wk after immunization. The results of the neutralization effect of specific IgY in EV71-challenged mice demonstrate that the EV71-specific IgY, either by intraperitoneal injection or oral administration, was able to significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality in EV71 infected mice pups.",

An increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria and the desire to treat pathogens that do not respond to antibiotics, such as viral pathogens, has prompted many researches to use antibodies as alternative to antibiotics [1] . IgY (immunoglobulin in yolk) antibodies are the predominant serum immunoglobulin in birds, reptiles, and amphibians, and are transferred from serum to egg yolk in the females to confer passive immunity to their embryos and neonates [2] . The potential of orally administered IgY for the prevention and treatment of many pathogens has been studied for many years, for Escherichia coli [3] , Helicobacter pylori [4] , Salmonella [5] , Rotavirus [6] , Staphylococcus [7] , Streptococcus mutans [8] , Yersinia [9] , Coronavirus [10] , and the Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus [11] . This paper evaluates the efficiency of IgY against enterovirus 71 (EV71).",

These virions consist of a non-enveloped capsid surrounding a core of single-stranded, positive-polarity RNA approximately 7.5 kb in size [12] . Since the initial description of EV71 in 1974 [13] , outbreaks of this virus have been identi-fied periodically in countries throughout the world, including the USA, Australia, Sweden, Japan, Bulgaria, Hungary, Hong Kong, and Malaysia [14] . In 1998, an outbreak of EV71 infections occurred in Taiwan, in which 405 children were hospitalized and 78 died [15] . EV71 infections are generally mild, like hand-foot-and-mouth disease (HFMD) and herpangina, but occasionally lead to severe diseases such as aseptic meningitis, poliomyelitis-like paralysis, and even fatal encephalitis in neonates [16] [17] [18] . In recent years, some efforts have been made to control EV71 infections. The most promising antiviral agents for EV71 are WIN-group compounds, which have undergone clinical trials [19, 20] . In addition, a research group from Taiwan has developed two candidate EV71 vaccines, including a formalin-inactivated whole virus vaccine and a VP1 expressing DNA vaccine [21] . The efficacy of both vaccine constructs is currently being tested in animal models.",

Researchers tried to block the replication of virus through binding the capsid of virus with some chemicals, such as pyridazinamines [22] , phenoxyl imidazoles [23] , or pleconaril [24, 25] . However, the treatment of EV71 with pleconaril was not significant, the binding of pleconaril with capsid was limited under higher viral concentration in vitro [26] . A specific antibody which could bind with the virus and hence reduce the contact of virus with host cells is an alternative choice. Human's immunoglobulin has been applied in the treatment of EV71 infections in babies whose immune system are not well-developed [27, 28] . There is no routine therapy for the treatment of EV71 infection with human's immunoglobulin so far. However, some animal model of EV71 challenged mouse has been developed, and provided some information about the protective effects of the neutralizing antibody on EV71 infection [29] . Compared to traditional antibody production, chicken as bio-factory can produce higher yield of IgY antibodies than mammals' IgG. A chicken can lay 280 eggs in a year and an egg yolk contains 100-200 mg of IgY antibodies.",

When one-day-old ICR mice were challenged with EV71 of strain MP4 with a dose of 10 5 pfu per mouse, the average morbidity was 96.5 \u00b1 6.1% in the control group.

We IP administrated the purified specific IgY derived from condensation of the immunized yolk WSF to EV71-challenged mice. This administrated was applied continuously for 3 days, from the day after viral infection (1 dpi) to the third day post infection (3 dpi). The therapeutic effects of IgY varied according to the neutralization titers of the specific IgY administered.

Only the group of titer 128 (trial 2) had some deaths after viral infection and IgY injections, with a mortality rate of 10%.

The second part of the animal tests involved oral administration of specific IgY to EV71 orally challenged mice. In trial 7, a dosage of 3 \u00d7 10 6 pfu MP4 strain EV71 was orally fed to pups 4 or 5 days old with a body weight of 2.5-3.0 g. The results indicated that if 100 l of specific IgY was orally fed 1 h before the viral challenge, the morbidity and mortality of challenged mice was 24% and 20%, respectively. Both morbidity and mortality were significantly reduced compared to those of the control group, at 69% and 62%, respectively (Table 4 ). When the specific IgY was given to the pups 1 h after the viral challenge, the infection rate was 38% with a final mortality rate of 31%. The morbidity and mortality rates of the specific IgY treatment groups were lower than those of the control group. Regardless of whether the IgY was fed 1 h before or after the viral challenge, virus neutralization by specific IgY was effective. Comparing the mortality of mice exhibiting infection symptoms, the IgY treated groups showed a similar rate to the control groups, which all exceeded 80%. The IgY application in trial 8 was similar to that in trial 7, changing only the age of challenged pups from 5-to 6-days old, with their body weight ranging from 3.0 to 3.5 g.

Also, the mortality in the IgY treated group among ill pups was lower than that in the control groups. Although the average mortality of IgY treated groups was as low as 8%, the control groups also exhibited a lower mortality (26.5%) than the control groups in trial 7.",

This variation in antibody pro-duction, based on the specific IgY production, might be the result of differences in individual immune responses [3] . The origin of antigen also plays an important role in the immune response, as different outer membrane proteins or fimbrial adhesions from the bacteria affected the rate of IgY production [5, 9] . When the protein antigen contained whole bacteria, or when the virus achieved better specific antibody production, the in vivo neutralization effect of the resultant antibody was also better [7] . This study used the whole virus as the antigen source to obtain a better IgY titer. The total protein obtained from an egg yolk by the water dilution method is around 595 mg per egg. This protein contains few lipids and lipoproteins, and accounts for one-sixth of the total protein of a yolk [42] . In this study, the purity of IgY in WSF was approximately 30-40% (Table 1 ). This demonstrates that the water dilution method can easily separate the IgY from other egg yolk components, as described previously [4, 34] .",

The results revealed no therapeutic effect. On the contrary, if the neutralization titer value of specific IgY was 128 or higher, the protective effects were significant (Table 2 ). Previous studies also show that this level of neutralization titer is effective for the serum IgG of mice [31, 35] . Compared to the control group, the mice in specific IgY treated group not only had a lower mortality, but also had normal weight gains. Most of the mice in control group showed a weight loss 5 days after the viral challenge, and continued to lose body weight until they died. Less than 10% of the sick mice in the control group survived the artificial infection of EV71 at a dose of 10 5 pfu per mouse. The surviving mice gained some weight despite showing signs of illness. After reaching a body weight of 4.5-5.0 g, they recovered from the infection and returned to healthy status. However, their subsequent weight gains were only 60-70% of the mice in the specific IgY treated group (data not shown). Some surviving mice also exhibited persistent paralysis of the hind limb and remained paralyzed for the rest of their lives, just like some children infected by EV71 [47] .",

In practical situations, children infected by EV71 will probably only receive the IgG treatment after they exhibit the typical symptoms. To determine the critical timing of effective treatment, trials 5 and 6 applied specific IgY treatment one and two days later, respectively. Clearly, the starting time of specific IgY injection was essential in reducing the mortality of infected mice. If IgY was given on 4-6 dpi, at which point most mice exhibited the symptoms of hind limb paralysis, only 37% of infected mice survived. It has been reported that on the first day of EV71 infection, the virus is kept in the small intestine, and then spreads to other organs on 2 dpi. The virus attacks most organs on 3 dpi, including the brain stem, lung, spinal cord, and muscle [31, 48] . If we started the specific IgY treatment on 2 dpi, which corresponds to the onset of clinical symptoms in children, then the therapeutic outcome was improved. In this case, the survival rate of the EV71-infected mice could be increased to 79%, highlighting the importance of the timing of specific IgY treatment. Before the on-set of clinical symptoms, specific IgY treatment has a better chance of achieving effective therapy. Some animal studies use oral feeding of egg yolk powder directly, without any purification of specific antibodies from the yolk [10, 49] . These studies prove the possibility of passive protection from the de novo form of yolk powder. In this study, 4 to 5 day-old mice were orally challenged with a viral dosage of 3 \u00d7 10 6 pfu per mouse. Challenged mice in the specific IgY-treated group showed a lower morbidity rate of 29% (12/41) than the control group, which showed a morbidity rate of 79% (38/48) . This indicates that the orally fed specific IgY effectively neutralized the viral attack in the gastroenteric duct, thereby blocking the infection of virus in challenged mice. The neutralization function appeared to be effective no matter if it was given 1 h before or after the viral challenge. The mortality among specific IgY treated mice was 24% (10/41), which was significantly lower than that of the control group, at 69% (33/48). However, the effect of specific IgY declined for pups aged 5 to 6 days old with a body weight ranging from 3.0 to 3.5 g. Previous research also shows that the age of mice affects the infection results [50] . Mice more than 6 days old would not be infected by EV71 after artificial challenge, indicating that the immune system of mice at this age could provide suitable protection.",

IgY raised against ETEC antigen has also been proven effective in controlling the diarrhea of piglets by oral administration [49] . Nevertheless, because the 4 to 6 day-old mice pups in this study could not consume egg yolk, we applied a purified antibody from IgY instead. This purified IgY, derived from the water soluble fraction of egg yolk, was more accessible to the gastric juice and easily exposed to digestive enzymes. The activity of might be influenced by the change of structure and loss of bioactivity [5, 7] . Based on the limitations of oral administration in suckling pups, a higher titer of IgY or a continuous treatment of IgY after viral challenge might achieve greater protection. This possibility is worthy of further research. The results of this study, however, indicate the potential of IgY in the prevention of EV71 infection in young children.",

However, a survival rate of 98.3% (60/61) was achieved if the challenged mice were IP injected, 1-3 dpi for 3 consecutive days, with a purified IgY antibody with a neutralization titer of 128 or more. When the challenge was carried out orally with a dose of 3 \u00d7 10 6 pfu per mouse, the lower morbidity in IgY treated group proved that the protection could be achieved by the neutralization of virus in the gastroenteric duct, thereby reducing the mortality of challenged mice. This is the first study to evaluate the effect of IgY treatment on EV71 infection, and our positive results indicate that further application in the prevention of EV71 is possible. In the form of an egg-yolk-added drink, yolk powder tablet, or capsule, it is can potentially be used to prevent the early infection of EV71.",
