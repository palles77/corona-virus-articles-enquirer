However, this unexpected theoretical analysis, if it is not flawed, gives us more practical opportunities to break the chain of infection of a pandemic using antiviral drugs and vaccines in association with well tried techniques such as quarantine (social distancing) basic hygiene and masks. Fortunately, there are now two classes of antiviral drugs, the neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs) such as oseltamivir and zanamivir, and the older M2 blockers such as amantadine and rimantadine [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] .",
