There are currently no licensed vaccines or treatments for SARS-CoV infections. Potential prevention and control strategies that show promise in vitro must be evaluated in animal models. The aged BALB/c mouse model for SARS supports a high level of viral replication in association with clinical illness and disease that mimics SARS in the elderly. We tested two preventive strategies, vaccination and passive transfer of serum antibody, to determine the extent of protection achieved against SARS-CoV challenge in this model. These approaches were able to achieve or induce antibody titers sufficient to reduce viral load, protect from weight loss and reduce or eliminate histopathologic changes in the lungs of aged mice. This study validates the utility of the aged BALB/c mouse model for evaluation of the efficacy of vaccines and immunoprophylaxis. Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

SARS-CoV was a zoonosis and although closely related viruses have been identified in civet cats and Chinese horseshoe bats, the animal reservoir from which the virus was introduced into the human population has yet to be definitively identified [1, 2] . Since July 2003, when the SARS outbreak ended, only a few cases of communityacquired and laboratory-acquired infection have occurred. The presence of an animal reservoir in nature suggests that the risk of re-introduction of a SARS-like CoV into humans remains, and efforts to develop prevention strategies continue. Animal models are needed to effectively test prevention strategies. Several animal species, including inbred strains of mice, have been found to support viral replication in the absence of clinical illness [3] . However, an animal model that mimics the natural course of disease affords a more stringent test of potential interventions. In several case series of SARS patients advanced age was a risk factor for severe disease, requiring intensive care and ventilatory support, as well as increased mortality [4] [5] [6] . We found that 12-14month old BALB/c mice support high and prolonged levels of viral replication in the lungs, signs of clinical illness and histopathological changes in the lungs including signs of acute and organized diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) [7] . Thus, this model reflected findings in elderly patients with SARS.",

Passive transfer of post-infection hyperimmune antiserum, derived from SARS-CoV infected mice, was shown to be effective in protecting immunologically na\u00efve, young mice from subsequent challenge with intranasally administered SARS-CoV [8] . Attenuated, recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) is known to be a good vector for the expression of foreign proteins inducing both humoral (antibodies) and cell mediated immunity to the expressed proteins [10] . rVSV vaccines expressing HIV Gag and Env proteins, induced a strong and long-lasting antibody recall [11, 12] . An attenuated rVSV virus expressing the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein efficiently expressed SARS-CoV S protein and conferred long-lasting protection from viral challenge in young mice [9] . Here we selected two preventive strategies that were effective in young mice, and evaluated them in old mice to determine if the immunoprophylactic measures that are effective in the young mouse are also effective in the more susceptible aged mouse. We tested the efficacy of passive transfer of postinfection murine SARS antiserum and active immunization with an rVSV vaccine encoding the SARS S protein (rVSV-S) in protection from challenge with intranasally administered SARS-CoV in this model.",

            "text": "Post-infection hyperimmune SARS antiserum was generated in BALB/c mice following both intranasal (i.n.) and intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of SARS-CoV (Urbani). The efficacy of passive transfer was tested in 12-monthold mice, in groups of 12, that received antiserum by i.p. injection. The negative control group received normal (nonimmune) BALB/c mouse sera (Harlan, Indianapolis, IA); the experimental groups received either undiluted post-infection hyperimmune SARS antiserum or a 1:4 dilution (in PBS) of the antiserum. Sera from the recipient mice were collected 24 h after i.p. injection, to determine the neutralizing antibody level achieved. Neutralizing antibody titers were determined by a micro-neutralization assay in Vero cell monolayers [8] . Mice were then challenged i.n. with 10 5 TCID 50 SARS-CoV (Urbani). On day 2 post-infection (p.i.), when virus titer in the lungs is expected to peak, four mice per group were sacrificed and lungs were harvested to determine levels of virus present [7] . Briefly, lungs were homogenized as a 10% (w/v) suspension, clarified by low speed centrifu-gation, and titered on Vero monolayers in 24-and 96-well plates [8] . Because infectious virus can be neutralized ex vivo in lung homogenates and this can affect virus titers, we confirmed the presence of virus in lung homogenates by quantitative PCR. Total RNA was isolated and purified from 10% (w/v) lung homogenates using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) with an on-column DNase digestion, as per manufacturer's protocol. RNA concentration was determined and 1 g was reverse transcribed using random primers included in the Stratascript First-Strand Synthesis System (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA). PCR reactions were performed at 59 \u2022 C for a total of 40 cycles using the Brilliant SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix (Stratagene) on an Mx4000 Multiplex Quantitative PCR System (Stratagene). SARS genomic RNA was amplified using forward primer 28411F (GGTGACGGCAAAATGAAAGAGC) and reverse primer 28725R (GGAGAATTTCCCCTACTG). 18S rRNA was amplified from each sample as an internal control using 18SF (GGTACAGTGAAACTGCGAAT) and 18SR (CAGT-TATCCAAGTAGGAGAG). C T is the cycle number when double stranded DNA was detected above background levels. Four mice per group were sacrificed on days 3 and 8 p.i. for evaluation of histopathologic changes. These time points were selected because at day 3 p.i., viral antigen and focal interstitial inflammation should be present and clearance of antigen accompanied by histopathologic changes indicative of lung repair should be visible by day 8 p.i. [7] . The lungs were inflated with 10% formalin and processed for histopathological examination. Pulmonary histopathology was evaluated and the distribution of SARS-CoV antigens was determined by immunohistochemical (IHC) staining [8] .",

The golden Syrian hamster model was used to study the control of infection when monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) were administered for prophylaxis or treatment [13, 14] . Used post-exposure, MAbs were able to alter the course and severity of SARS-CoV infection in hamsters. The hamster model, like the aged mouse model, supports replication of virus in the presence of significant pathological changes to the lungs. In this study we demonstrate the utility of the aged BALB/c mouse model for the evaluation of vaccines and immunoprophylaxis. The aged mouse model differs from the young mouse model in which the only measure of efficacy is quantitative virology. Viral replication in the lungs of young mice occurs in the absence of clinical illness, extra-pulmonary spread or elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines. Peak pulmonary viral titers of around 10 7 TCID 50 /g are seen on day 1 post-infection, with clearance by days 5-7. Histopathological exam two days post-infection reveals only mild focal peribronchiolar mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates with clearance of viral antigen by day 9 [8] . Aged mice allow analysis of four outcome measures: quantitative virology, clinical symptoms, histopathological changes and immunohistochemistry in the lungs. High titer viral replication is accompanied by significant weight loss on days 3-6 postinfection, with a nadir of 8% on day 4 post-infection and extra-pulmonary spread to the liver on days 2 and 5. Peak pulmonary viral titers of about 10 8 TCID 50 /g are seen on day 2 post-infection, with evidence of viral replication at a high titer through day 5. Multifocal interstitial lymphocytic infiltrates are seen by histopathology on day 5, with gradual resolution and repair on days 9 and 13 post-infection [7] . Complete protection from SARS-CoV infection in aged mice is demonstrated when animals achieve a high level of neutralizing antibody. This was seen when aged mice were passively immunized using murine SARS hyperimmune antisera. Even with low levels of SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibody after passive immunization, mice were partially protected from viral infection. A greater than 100-fold reduction in viral titer was observed in mice that received a 1:4 dilution of hyperimmune antisera compared to mice that received nonimmune mouse serum prior to challenge. Reductions in extent and duration of lung inflammation were seen when viral load was reduced by this level. No significant inflammation was found in mice that achieved sterilizing immunity. Thus, prior administration of SARS hyperimmune anitsera prevents viral replication and associated disease in aged BALB/c mice.",

            "text": "Although rVSV vaccines induce high and prolonged antibody responses in young mice we did not see a similar robust level of antibody response in old mice [9] . There are two possible explanations for the poor antibody response to SARS-CoV following immunization of aged mice with rVSV-S; either rVSV did not replicate efficiently or the response of old mice to the SARS-CoV spike protein is poor. Antibody titers to VSV in these mice were robust (data not shown, \u22651:1280), suggesting that the latter explanation is likely. A 10,000-fold reduction in viral load and protection from weight loss and histopathological changes were seen in mice that were immunized with rVSV-S vaccine compared to mice that received rVSV. A surprising finding was that this protection occurred in the absence of high neutralizing antibody levels. Protection from rVSV vectored vaccines is mediated by strong humoral and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses. A CTL response is in part responsible for the rapid control and clearance of many viral infections [10] [11] [12] . Although antibodies may have contributed to protection, we speculate that the efficacy of rVSV-S in old mice results from a strong CTL response. This speculation is further supported by the observation that although neutralizing antibody titers were lower, the reduction in pulmonary virus replication was greater in mice immunized with rVSV-S than in mice that were passively immunized with a 1:4 dilution of hyperimmune SARS antiserum. The aged mouse model, which mimics findings in elderly SARS patients, has proven to be a useful tool in the evaluation of strategies to prevent SARS-CoV infection. In this study, both passive antibody transfer and vaccination with a live virus vaccine were effective strategies to control viral replication and associated disease.",
