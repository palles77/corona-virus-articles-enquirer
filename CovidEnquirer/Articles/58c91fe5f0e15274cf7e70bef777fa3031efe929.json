The results show (figure A) that in 122 out of 125 samples rT3 levels were 4-9 times above the normal adult range. All children were euthyroid. In the other 3 cases (figure C) the rT3 was in the normal adult range. In these cases the slightly raised serum T3 levels and the normal serum T.S.H. levels suggested that the sera were from the mother since in cord-blood serum T3 levels are highly reduced and T.S.H. concentrations are normal or increased. The error could therefore be elucidated without further blood-sampling.",

Both cases cannot be strictly compared with the results obtained at birth in cord blood. For reasons given above, however, it seems unlikely that maternal T3 could influence the level observed in cord blood.",

            "text": "We conclude that screening for neonatal hypothyroidism with serum T3 could be of advantage and certainly deserves further investigation. This method is simple and hardly influenced by abnormal thyroxine-binding globulin, which greatly affects serum-T levels. It is likely that such a screening done at birth would permit early detection of congenital hypothyroidism and give the affected child the best chance of avoiding mental retardation. We want to draw attention to the hypothesis that E.N. is caused by ochratoxin A or other fungal toxins, proposed at the 2nd International Symposium on Endemic Nephropathy4 and referred to in your 1973 editorial.s This hypothesis was based primarily upon the striking similarities between E.N. and ochratoxin-A-induced porcine nephropathy. Ochratoxin A is a major disease determinant of naturally occurring nephropathy in pigs6 7 and poultry.' 9 Meat of pigs and poultry exposed to ochratoxin-A-contaminated feed contains residues of ochratoxin A,10 a heat-stable metabolite. Ochratoxin A has been encountered in 10-20% of homegrown cereals and pork meat in an endemic village in Yugoslavia.\" In the search for an environmental cause of E.N. ochratoxin A seems a likely candidate. The possible role of fungal metabolites in the aetiology of E.N. is further supported by the highly significant correlation between excess of rainfall over evaporation in harvest and initial storage periods and the number of people who die ofE.N. during the succeeding two years, observed in all three E.N. countries (Bulgaria, Romania, and Yugoslavia).\" A high water content in foodstuffs favours fungal growth and mycotoxin formation.",

Furthermore, if pig-borne coronavirus were the cause of E.N., would not one expect nephropathy among workers at pig slaughterhouses all over the world?",

Work of this type is now in progress at the Institute for Medical Research, Zagreb. Also important in this context is the possible detection and localisation of ochratoxin A in kidneys from E.N. patients. Work of this type, by use of immunofluorescence, is now in progress at our institutes. SiR,&mdash;The concentrated form necessary for presentation of data in your excellent letters section may occasionally lead some of your readers to suspect that authors have overlooked important, and even elementary, facts. Thus Fuller and McCartney'3 find it difficult to judge the significance of our data140n serum high-density lipoprotein (H.D.L.) levels in patients with coronary heart-disease (c.H.D.) because we did not give information on other variables. In fact we did not find any significant correlation between apo-AI-containing lipoprotein particles and other relevant indices (the fact that we did not measure H.D.L. cholesterol but apo-AI-containing particles is also relevant to the interesting letter by Lopes-Virella and Colwell\" Clearly, we would not have stressed the potential usefulness of H.D.L. determination if the data had suggested that quantitative H.D.L. variation largely reflects variation in other lipoprotein indices.",

The hypothesis was supported by some epidemiological data on E.N. pointing to pigs in the endemic villages as the source of infection with coronavirus. Georgescu et a1. have also demon-. strated virus-like particles in renal tissue from E.N. patients. Pursuing the virus hypothesis by serological investigations, however, led this group to conclude that evidence for a viral cause for E.N. is still entirely morphological. Macanovid et al.3 indicated that E.N. is an immunocomplex-type nephritis and pointed out that virus-like particles have been demonstrated in several other conditions without any causal association with the renal lesion in question.",
