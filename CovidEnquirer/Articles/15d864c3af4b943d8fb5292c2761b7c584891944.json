In the field of public health, China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) offers immense opportunities for partnership and collective actions involving multiple countries to combat globalization-linked infectious and/or chronic diseases, emerging pandemics, and outbreaks of potential threats to both laboratory information management systems and health information management. The national and global health challenges have increasingly proved that economic prosperity cannot be achieved when huge knowledge and capacity gaps exist in health systems. There is thus a need for public health initiatives aimed at strengthening the health systems beyond sovereign borders to influence global geo-economics. We highlight situational insights that offer approaches and strategies for increasing public health investment and capacity development in the countries along the Belt and Road, enhancing public and global health cooperation alongside participation in disease control and elimination, promoting public health governance and data sharing for pandemic threats, and building shared values and benefits in public health through Sino-African cooperation and the BRI. Our approach also examines the values of the China's BRI in relation to public health, projections and initiatives for increasing new investment and development capacity in public health systems, and enhanced public and global health cooperation and participation toward the BRI's framework and scope.",

The 65-plus integrated countries account for approximately 40% of global gross domestic product (GDP). [1] [2] [3] [4] With this aim in mind, China has already injected 40 billion USD worth of initial funds, with private investors setting up funds with an initial capital sum of 30 billion CNY in March 2017 to support the consortia of projects under this initiative. 1 The initiative held significant commercial, trading, and health potential -for the country and the involved partners in particular-in sustainable infrastructure, geo-economic influence and integration of bilateral and multilateral trade, health and education empowerment of the modern world, skills transfer, and innovation uptake and development. 1 ",

[5] [6] [7] China's engagement in global health, mainly in Africa and Asia-Pacific, has so far drawn on its unique strengths to deliver assistance through hospital construction, malaria and neglected tropical diseases control, education and training of health workers, drug donation, and cross-border infectious disease control (based on its experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome). 2, 5, 6, 8 It was apparent that China should now take the step to ensure that the OBOR, with its emphasis on development via infrastructure, did not conflict with the admirable aims set out in its own Healthy China 2030 blueprint. 1, 3 Rather, it should ensure that the two complement each other for China's internal good and for its foreign policy in relation to developing countries that are highly caught up in the Silk Road's momentum in terms of health, trade, and economic opportunities to achieve their sustainable development goals (SDGs).",

The BRI aimed to connect the Asian-Pacific Economic Area with the European Economic Area by building two maritime routes focused on cooperation and investments and based on collective responsibility to give basic services to the people along its corridor in order to improve their livelihoods and exploit new opportunities. At the same time, it aimed to enhance existing systems and infrastructure so that their beneficiaries can cope better with moving into the future while broadening the experience and engagement of Chinese experts, policymakers, and researchers in the international way of working and thinking about development cooperation and health investments worldwide, albeit mainly in Africa. 1, 5 China's multilateral approach to international diplomacy and foreign policy is growing. 3, 5 Having long sought to maintain a low profile on the global stage, it has in recent years begun to advocate a greater role for itself in the international order and the implications of global health. [1] [2] [3] 5 Chinese companies were also leaving the comfort of their home-based market and going overseas in pursuit of new markets and new machineries. 1,5 At the same time, increasing Sino-African relations have been the subject of scholarly debate, with supporters taking an optimistic and win-win partnership. 1, 3, 5, 7 According to China's Ministry of Commerce, Chinese companies have built 75 zones for economic and trade cooperation in 24 countries along Belt and Road routes, contributing more than 2.21 billion USD in tax revenue and creating almost 209,000 local jobs. 5, 7, 9 Chinese enterprises made a non-financial direct investment of 14.36 billion USD in 59 countries along the Belt and Road in 2017. Moreover, 7,217 overseas projects were agreed by Chinese enterprises within 61 countries along the Belt and Road, the value of the newly signed contracts amounting to 144.32 billion USD in cooperative deals in various fields, including infrastructure construction, financial collaboration, and cultural exchange projects, 1,3,5,7,9 aiming for win-win cooperation, common development, and shared prosperity.",

Increasing China's contributions to multilateral humanitarian assistance have been an important part of bridging substantial health gaps and inequities. 7, 9 The establishment of new and strategic Chinese leadership and think tanks for the creation and guidance of investment capital (money, infrastructure, and human) and exchange capacity building has been scaled up. For example, China launched an unprecedented public health emergency response to the Ebola outbreak in west Africa, dispatching 1,200 workers, infrastructure, and aid commodities to the affected populations in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea. 2, 3, 7, 9 China's development of health assistance and new investment funds are complementary and reinforcing; by developing infrastructure and providing medical supplies to Africa and Asia, China shapes a unique global engagement and strongly influences the contours of global health development. 7, 9 In 2013, China proposed its BRI to promote health and infrastructure, trade and commercial transactions, the connectivity of infrastructure, and policies, regulations, and economically viable high standards beneficial to the world and China, across the 100 partner countries in Asia, Africa, and Europe. 3 In affirming this course, exemplary initiatives, such as the 1,860 km Tanzania-Zambia Railway and other numerous megainfrastructural projects in Africa, have symbolized China's presence in Africa since the 1970s. 1,3,8,10",

It encompasses a range of issues, including e-commerce, the establishment of small and medium enterprises, sanitation, working conditions, hygiene, health screening, immunization, personal lifestyles. More recently, it includes community and institutional development, early warning systems, surveillance and detection-such as developing platforms that would make operational and epidemiological information publicly available to decision-makers in the event of an outbreak or potential health emergency-and investment in strengthening countries' biosecurity and pandemic preparedness through a focus on national-scale immunization programs. 1, 2, 6, 7, 9 Establishing national public health laboratory systems and emergency operation centers is necessary to ensure capacity building and the training of a local and global health security workforce, as well as cooperation to counter the rise in antimicrobial resistance epidemics, e.g., tuberculosis (TB) resistance. 2, 7, 9 A strategy with a definition of health that goes beyond the absence of disease, involving partnership and community participation and that requires governments, organizations, communities, and individuals to work together to improve healthcare quality delivery would be most effective. 1, 2, 6, 7, 9 Although we have learned much about what does and does not work since the publication of Health for All, there is still an ongoing need to capture evidence of good health practices that can inform future programs such as Leave No One Behind It is crucial to promote greater cooperation and good practice among practitioners, policymakers, and researchers to ensure that quality evidence is translated into real and practical action, health education, and development implementation. The BRI could help to support global economic growth and development across Africa, the Middle East, and Asia while seeking mutual benefits and sustainable cooperation. 1, 5 The BRI would also gain China more recognition globally and champion China's multifaceted global cooperation role by, for instance, setting up committees to coordinate approaches across different business activities, such as the 515 million USD financing of a power plant in Zambia, a 200 million USD loan for a Bangladesh electricity plant, and a 42 million USD export credit facility for a gas terminal in Sri Lanka, 1, 2, 6, 7, 9, 11 among other recent bilateral initiatives that have been commissioned. 8 Critically examining a range of public health challenges and needs is crucial to evaluating actionable evidence-based policy decisions, to designing improved public health programs, and to formulating effective strategies to detect, prevent, and control health problems. This was necessary in order to promote health and to frame the knowledge of public health within a development context in law and governance, global health, nutrition and public health, and prenatal and maternal health. [1] [2] [3] 7 It is also necessary to leverage the unique cross-disciplinary approach to understand the principles underlying research, policy, and practice in global health; to foster critical thinking; and to build transferable skills from a range of academic and professional backgrounds in the process of tackling local and global health issues and challenges. Nurturing continuous, progressive improvement of the health status of individuals and groups in a population is something that reflects the range of challenges we face at the start of the new century. Perhaps the overriding challenge, however, is to ensure that we do not forget the lessons of the past when developing new strategies and tactics or when strengthening health systems and universal health coverage under the conditions of a rising China-Africa cooperation investment momentum and multi-sectorial diversification.",

Successful interventions also tend to be sustained and delivered by well-trained and wellsupported workers. Success can be further increased if interventions take place within a supportive local/national strategic framework in which effective cross-sectorial and multidisciplinary collaboration is necessary to appreciate and analyze the state of public health and socio-economic indicators and drivers in low-and middle-income countries, and to design and evaluate evidence-based policies and action plans to address public health concerns. 1,2,5-7 Moreover, substantial experience of planning or implementing public health programs, of teaching or public healthrelated research, and of critical professional skills development is needed to tackle the rising chronic disease epidemics, rapid aging, and the resurgence on infectious diseases. These are achievable through improvements in global health policy, global health research, program management, and policy advice and advocacy at national and international levels with a new range of approaches to global health horizons. 3, 5, 7 These dimensions seem to be well articulated under the framework of OBOR public health initiatives.",

Health, technology, and information harnessing: This entails invigorating innovation through ideas, information, and technology sharing among countries, which translates to sustained economic development at a localized level. Public health vigilance, health service provision, and sustained research capacity act as core pillars of the anticipated project, with the potential to tap into over 65 countries-cumulatively accounting for approximately 40% of the world's GDP-and enhanced free trade operations. b. Facilitated trade and commerce: As the BRI takes center role in interconnecting markets along the proposed routes, and as inland infrastructure (in terms of roads) and sea routes through ports are opened up and spread, higher volumes of trade in terms of goods and services will be boosted, with quality providing a competitive edge. c. Increased energy resource security through a reduction in manufacturing and production costs, as well as efficiency through rigorous movement of fuel sources such as gas and oil. d. Progress toward planetary health-driven development: achieved through an enhanced one-health concept based on the wide economic scope of the BRI coupled with the effective coexistence of humans and their accompanying ecosystems. This would lead to a promising perspective in the project's objective of broader economic connectivity and empowerment, contributing to the budding and nurturing of cultural and knowledge exchange in agribusiness; effective health service delivery, management, and advancement; transfer of cutting-edge and digital technology innovation skills; implementation of early warning alert and emergency response channels; and sustainable gains in Sino-African cooperation synergy.",
