They all contain the so-called NTP motif, a constellation of conserved sequence elements characteristic of the catalytic sites of a vast class of NTP-utilizing enzymes [5-81. These elements are: (i) a flexible loop involved in the binding of the pyrophosphate moiety of NTP, with the consensus sequence G/AXXXXGKS/T (the so-called 'A' site), and (ii) a P-strand ending with an invariant Asp residue interacting with the Mg'+ coordinated with the same phosphates, with the consensus (Z)(Z)(Z)ZZD where Z is a hydrophobic residue (the so-called 'B' site). Apart from this consensus pattern, however, no significant similarities have been detected between different helicase sequences (strictly speaking, it was the A consensus only which was identified in most helicases; the B site usually was not recognized), with the exception of E. coli rep and uvrD proteins PI.",

            "text": "Here we delineate a distinct family of homologous proteins consisting of E. coli helicases (or helicase subunits) rep, uvrD, recB and recD. Unexpectedly, we discovered that the sequences of the conserved domains of these proteins are similar at a statistically significant level to those of a pair of herpesvirus proteins of unknown function and to a family of proteins involved in eukaryotic positive strand RNA viral replication. We suggest that the proteins of the latter two groups are involved in duplex unwinding during replication and recombination of viral DNA and RNA, respectively. the alignment was highly significant, with the alignment score exceeding the mean score for randomized sequences by more than 5 standard deviations (SD). In region II, the similarity of recB to the sequences of rep and uvrD was also significant, but that of recD to the 3 other sequences was less pronounced (about 3 SD). Still recD contained more than l/2 of the residues conserved in this region in rep, uvrD and,recB. Comparison of the conserved blocks of the 4 protein alignments shown in fig.1 with amino acid sequences of other helicases such as E. coli proteins recA, recF, uvrA, uvrB, dnaB, tray and rho, bacteriophage T4 uvsY protein, bacteriophage T7 gene 4 product, and polyomavirus T antigens did not reveal significant similarity. Thus, the 4 proteins characterized above constitute a distinct subset of bacterial helicases with a high degree of sequence conservation. Regions of significant similarity to the 3 conserved regions of rep/uvrD were detected in 2 subunits of recBCD helicase, recB and recD. The conserved segments of the 4 proteins were aligned by the program OPTAL (OPTimal ALignment) which performs optimal alignment of multiple amino acid sequences and its statistical evaluation by a Monte Carlo procedure [12] . The resulting alignment is shown in fig.1 . For regions I and III, Our bank of NTP motif containing proteins includes more than 100 species. Many of these are grouped into distinct families. We compared the consensus derived for the family of 4 E. coli helicases with those of other families. Unexpectedly, a striking resemblance has been noticed to the pattern of 1 of the 3 families of NTP motif containing proteins involved in the genome replication of eukaryotic positive strand RNA viruses [ 13-151. This family includes proteins of cy-and coronaviruses infecting animals and those of several plant virus groups. In fact, the RNA viral consensus has been found to constitute a subset of the helicase one, the former protein family being more variable than the latter (fig-l) . The conserved residues of the virus protein family are, like those of the helicases, distributed between 3 regions separated by divergent spacers of varying lengths. The sequences of the conserved domains of RNA viral proteins were aligned by OPTAL with those of recD as the differences in spacer lengths were minimal in this case as compared to the 3 other E. coli proteins. Two separate alignments were generated, one between the N-terminal conserved of RNA viral proteins [14,15] and the 2 N-terminal conserved regions of recD, and the other between the C-terminal subdomain and the 3rd conserved region. Both alignments were statistically significant, at levels of approx. 8 and 7 SD, respectively. Interestingly, the similarity between the sequences of the helicases and those of RNA viral proteins discussed here is generally higher than that between the 3 families of NTP motif containing proteins of positive strand RNA viruses (the 2nd and 3rd families include proteins of picorna-/como-and potyviruses, respectively [ 151). The joint consensus pattern for the 2 families includes 20 conserved residues. Further search of the sequences of NTP motif containing proteins for this pattern picked up 2 very similar herpesvirus proteins, BBLF4 protein of EBV and gene product 55 of VZV. Significant similarity (~5 SD) has been revealed upon alignment of region I of bacterial helicases and of regions II and III of RNA viral proteins with respective portions of the herpesvirus proteins.",

For the herpesvirus proteins, such a proposal seems natural, since the replication of the dsDNA of these viruses requires a helicase(s). Compatible with this proposal, proteins described here are among the most conserved between EBV and VZV [22], probably being vital for herpesvirus reproduction. As for RNA viruses, the need for a helicase seems less obvious as their genomes are ssRNA. However, it has been demonstrated in several systems that replication complexes isolated from cells infected with positive strand RNA viruses are capable of in vitro synthesis of only double-stranded replicative forms, and not of genomic ssRNA [23-251. In one case, that of TMV [25] , this has been shown to correlate with the absence in such preparations of ~126 which possesses NTP-binding properties [26] and, according to our hypothesis, may be a helicase. Thus one can hypothesize that the function of RNA viral proteins (domains) described here is NTP (probably ATP)-dependent unwinding of double-stranded template molecules in viral RNA replication ( fig.4) . It seems likely that they may also be involved in RNA recombination which readily occurs in plant viruses and in coronaviruses [27, 28] . The necessity for an energy-dependent unwinding function has already been postulated for another group of positive strand RNA viruses (the picornaviruses), based on some in vitro experiments with replication complexes [29, 30] .",

A potential DNA-binding domain of the classical helix-turn-helix type has indeed been identified in the domain of recB separating the 1st and 2nd conserved segments [3 11; we were able to demonstrate that this domain is conserved in similar locations in the other 3 E. coli proteins ( fig.1 ) and in the herpesvirus proteins (not shown), i.e. in all the DNA-binding proteins included in our set.",

Thus, within the holoenzyme, the functions of the subunits are probably specialized, recB being the helicase proper, and recD performing some ATP-dependent accessory function. A rather similar situation exists in 4 RNA viruses, Circles designate viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and triangles the proposed helicase.

Interestingly, the putative NTP-binding proteins of these viruses as well as recD contain substitutions of certain otherwise conserved amino acid residues ( fig.2 ), in line with the idea of functional diversification.

Significantly, the gene for recD, the protein most distantly related to others, is contained within one operon with that for recB [33] , making gene duplication a realistic possibility for their origin. The same appears certain for 2 closely related herpesvirus proteins and for RNA viral proteins as argued elsewhere [15] . The possibility of the 3 families constituting a single monophyletic superfamily is not as easily acceptable. Nevertheless, in our opinion, the arguments for this are rather compelling. Although statistically significant similarity could be established only for some pairs of conserved segments of the 3 protein families, they do form a contiguous 'network' in which each sequence block of a family is related to the respective block of at least one of the 2 other families at a meaningful level. Obviously, the fortuitous simultaneous appearance of all the 6 conserved blocks in the same order in the proteins of the 3 families is most unlikely, though it is not easy to estimate the exact probability due to highly variable spacer lengths. The complete consensus pattern of 20 conserved residues could not be found in any protein outside the delineated set as shown by screening of the translated version of Genbank (Rel. 38.0). These observations demonstrate that the group of proteins described here constitutes a distinct cluster among other NTP motif containing proteins.",
