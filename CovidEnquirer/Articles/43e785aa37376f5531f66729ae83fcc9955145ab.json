Yet, selection pressures driving DENV microevolution within human hosts (intrahost) remain unknown. We employed a whole-genome segmented amplification approach coupled with deep sequencing to profile DENV-3 intrahost diversity in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) and plasma samples from 77 dengue patients. DENV-3 intrahost diversity appears to be driven by immune pressures as well as replicative success in PBMCs and potentially other replication sites. Hotspots for intrahost variation were detected in 59%-78% of patients in the viral Envelope and pre-Membrane/Membrane proteins, which together form the virion surface. Dominant variants at the hotspots arose via convergent microevolution, appear to be immune-escape variants, and were evolutionarily constrained at the macro level due to viral replication defects. Dengue is thus an example of an acute infection in which selection pressures within infected individuals drive rapid intrahost virus microevolution.",

There are four closely related serotypes of DENV (DENV-1 to DENV-4), each of which encodes three structural proteins (Capsid [C] , pre-Membrane/Membrane [prM/M], and Envelope [E] ) and seven non-structural (NS) proteins (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5). Infections with DENV can result in a spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from asymptomatic infection to the debilitating acute febrile illness, dengue fever (DF), to the life-threatening dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) (WHO, 1997) . Major determinants of dengue pathogenesis include virulence of the infecting DENV strain, host genetic factors, and pre-existing host immune responses from prior infection(s) with a different DENV serotype (Halstead and Yamarat, 1965; Messer et al., 2003; Nguyen et al., 2008; OhAinle et al., 2011; Rico-Hesse et al., 1997) . In sequential infections, disease severity appears to be determined by a complex interplay of protective and enhancing components from pre-existing immunity to viral antigens (Halstead, 2009; Peiris and Porterfield, 1979; Rothman and Ennis, 1999) . Such intricacies of the human immune response to DENV infection have made it difficult not only to identify the precise mechanisms that trigger progression to severe disease but also to engineer vaccines and therapeutics for combating the disease.",

            "text": "Replication of DENV within each host produces a population of genetically related but distinct genomes (referred to as intrahost diversity) due to the error-prone nature of the viral replicase, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) (Domingo and Holland, 1997) . These intrahost variants are thought to serve as templates on which evolutionary mechanisms act to shape variation at the consensus level between hosts (i.e., interhost diversity), leading to the emergence of genetically distinct strains and genotypes of DENV. Genetic variations in intrahost populations have been proposed to influence disease outcome and pathogenesis in chronic human infections with RNA viruses such as HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Farci et al., 2002; Joos et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2008; Moreau et al., 2008; Sullivan et al., 2007) , which provide considerable time frames (months to years) for discernible virus evolution in response to intrahost selection pressures. Similar observations have also been reported in chronic infections with influenza virus and norovirus, viruses that are usually associated with acute infections (Bull et al., 2012; Debbink et al., 2014; Rogers et al., 2015; Valkenburg et al., 2013) . These studies have characterized the emergence of individual variants associated with immune evasion or drug resistance. Unlike chronic infections, only a handful of studies have reported on the evolutionary mechanisms and viral genetics driving virus evolution in acute human infections such as Ebola ( (Park et al., 2016) , and dengue (Parameswaran et al., 2012; Rodriguez-Roche et al., 2016; Sessions et al., 2015; Sim et al., 2015; Thai et al., 2012) , where virus evolution is severely constrained by time (days to weeks). Consequently, limited information exists about the fitness and pathogenesis profiles of individual intrahost DENV variants that emerge in acute human infections. Information on intrahost viral diversity can provide new perspectives in assessing infection outcome, disease pathogenesis, and vaccine or therapeutic efficacy in individuals with dengue or other closely related viral infections such as Zika.",

Reference genomes were reconstructed for each sample using Bowtie2 (Langmead and Salzberg, 2012) and SAMtools (Li et al., 2009) , and in-house python scripts were used to calculate variation at the nucleotide, codon, and amino acid levels for each locus in the DENV-3 coding region (see STAR Methods). After filtering for coverage (R1,000 reads) and Sanger quality scores (R30), median coverage per codon locus was 22,975 and 20,024 for read 1 and read 2 datasets, respectively. Only samples with R50% coverage of the DENV-3 genome were retained for downstream analyses; 68 PBMC and 31 plasma samples from 77 individuals, including paired PBMC-plasma datasets from 22 individuals, passed the threshold for genome coverage.

We compared the percent loci per protein that are variant in any sample between 1 and 2 dengue and found significantly fewer unique variant loci in 2 dengue cases, both in PBMC ( Figure 1A ; left panel, p < 0.001) and plasma ( Figure 1A ; right panel, p < 0.01) samples. These observations were not due to systematic disparities in the yields of viral RNA, since measures of genome equivalents (GE) per milliliter of extracted viral RNA were not significantly different between 1 and 2 cases for both PBMC and plasma samples ( Figure 1B ; left and right panels). Thus, DENV-3 appears to be evolving at fewer distinct loci genome-wide in 2 dengue compared with 1 dengue, suggesting that virus evolution is constrained by pre-existing immune pressures in 2 dengue. In addition, we examined the locations of unique variant loci on the exposed and membrane-associated surfaces of the E protein, which is a prominent target for antibody-mediated immunity in human dengue. We detected fewer unique variant loci across all samples in 2 dengue cases compared with 1 cases ( Figure 1C ; top and bottom panels) on both the exposed and the membraneassociated surfaces of E; much of this difference was contributed by PBMC-specific variant loci. Thus, consistent with genome-wide differences between 1 and 2 dengue, the breadth of the viral variant repertoire in E appears to be reduced in 2 dengue compared with 1 dengue. Such global differences in viral composition between naive individuals and individuals with pre-existing immunity to DENV indicate that the extent of diversity in the intrahost DENV-3 population is directed by the immune repertoire during acute dengue in humans. Further studies investigating particular epitopes will help resolve the specificities of pre-existing immune pressures contributing to differential rates of viral microevolution in 1 and 2 dengue.",

We examined the percent abundance of non-synonymous variants in PBMCs and plasma, binning loci by whether variants were found at levels R1% in PBMCs only (PBMCs), or in both PBMC and plasma samples (Both). The median percent abundance of variant DENV-3 genomes that were found in PBMCs only was significantly lower than the median percent abundance of variant genomes found in both PBMCs and plasma, for both non-synonymous and synonymous variants ( Figure 1D , left and right panels, p < 0.0001). Thus, variants that appear in both PBMCs and plasma are more abundant than variants that are restricted to PBMCs, suggesting that DENV variants found in plasma have been selected based on their intracellular replicative success in PBMCs.",

For instance, minimal intersection was detected in the locations of variant loci on the highly antigenic E protein ( Figure 1C , green loci), as well as in other proteins ( Figures 1E and S2A) , inferred from the presence of fewer green lines representing loci with R1% amino acid variants in both PBMC and plasma samples, compared with orange and red lines representing loci with R1% amino acid variants in PBMC or plasma samples, respectively. These findings were not due to differences in the depth of sequencing coverage (data not shown), or in the number of viral copies used as input for generating sequencing libraries (Figure S2B) , because these parameters were comparable between paired PBMC and plasma samples. These observations of largescale differences between plasma and PBMC DENV variant populations, when taken together with prior knowledge from human autopsy studies about the existence of significant non-PBMC compartments for viral replication in phagocytes, lymph node, spleen, alveolar macrophages in lung, and perivascular cells in brain (Aye et al., 2014; Balsitis et al., 2009; Jessie et al., 2004) , suggest contribution to plasma DENV populations from replication compartments other than PBMCs.",

However, prominent hotspots for diversity were identified in the majority (59%-78%) of samples at three codon coordinates: (1, 2) 214 and 215, corresponding to amino acids 100 and 101 in the membrane portion of prM/M (hereafter prM 100 and prM 101 ), and (3) 595, corresponding to amino acid 315 in the highly conserved AB-loop region in E Domain III (E 315 ) (Figures 2A and 2B) . To confirm the presence of the more abundant E 315 variant, we designed primers that specifically targeted and amplified either WT or E 315 DENV RNA and validated the specificity of these primers using RNA from WT or E 315 variant viruses ( Figure S3A ). We tested a subset of seven serum samples used in this study and were able to directly detect the E 315 hotspot variant at various levels in all seven clinical samples ( Figure S3B ).",

All other proteins (including E, which is shown as an example) exhibit no significant differences in % AA variants between PBMCs and plasma. **p % 0.0001, n.s., non-significant (Wilcoxon signed-rank test).

Hotspots detected were not PCR artifacts from the amplicon and library preparation (data not shown). Even at lower thresholds of R0.5% variant abundance, the prM 100 and prM 101 variants were only detected in a small number of PBMC samples (8.8%-13.2% of samples; Figure 2D ). The E 315 variants thus appear to originate in PBMCs (in addition to other cell types), whereas it is conceivable that the prM 100 arise in viral replication sites distinct from PBMCs, although we have not ruled out the possibility that these variants arose in PBMCs and are simply enriched in the extracellular environment. The prM 100,101 and E 315 variants constitute 2.2% and 1.9%, respectively, of an estimated 1.2 3 10 7 GE/mL of circulating viral populations in plasma (extrapolated from Figure 1F ; median yield of 1.2 3 10 6 GE in 50 mL of RNA extracted from 100 mL of plasma) from individuals with detectable levels (R1.0%) of these variants ( Figure S2C , median abundances). We also analyzed interhost diversity in 690 full-length DENV-3 consensus genomes (GenBank) and found that even though DENV-3 exhibited codon-level diversity at prM 100 and E 315 ( Figure 2E , left panel, red bars), virus populations were invariant in the interhost amino acid sequence at all three hotspots ( Figure 2E , right panel, red bars, and Table S2 ), suggestive of macro-evolutionary (i.e., consensus-level) constraints at these loci. In addition to major hotspots, we detected several minor hotspots, defined as loci with 1.0% or higher variant abundance in R10% of samples, in both PBMC and plasma samples ( Figure S2D , all minor hotspots marked with^). Of these minor hotspots, only one (codon 1071 in polyprotein) appeared to be shared between PBMC and plasma samples at a diversity threshold of 1.0% ( Figure S2D ). All minor hotspots (loci marked with^) exhibited interhost diversity at the codon level ( Figure S2E , left panel, red line, and Table S2 ), but interhost amino acid diversity was only observed at five out of nine minor hotspots ( Figure S2E , right panel, red line, and Table  S2 ). Overall, our findings demonstrate that hotspots for intrahost viral diversity can be detected in acute human dengue. Furthermore, the presence of hotspot variants at macroevolutionarily conserved loci highlight the importance of host-specific selection pressures in DENV-3 intrahost evolution.",

In samples with detectable levels of both prM variants at the population level, we observed that all haplotypes with the prM 100 variant also included the prM 101 variant (and vice versa), demonstrating that the prM variants were linked, i.e., present on the same variant viral genome ( Figure 3A , red arrowheads). Moreover, we identified haplotypes with variants at only one prM hotspot ( Figure S2F ), which implied that DENV-3 was evolving independently at each of the prM 100 and prM 101 hotspots. The prM 100,101 variant thus appears to be the result of sequential evolution at prM 100 and prM 101 on the same viral genome. Our haplotype analysis also revealed significant interhost diversity at three loci proximal to the prM 100,101 and E 315 hotspots ( Figures 3A and 3B ; black arrowheads). Four different haplotypes with a wide range of frequencies were detected among the consensus genomes in our samples, each with unique combinations of nucleotide diversity at these loci ( Figures  3A and 3B , and Table S3 ). Nucleotides at all three polymorphic loci were 100% concordant between the dominant WT consensus genome and the prM/M or E variant genome for all samples ( Figures 3A and 3B and Table S3 ; variant genomes marked with *). This was true even for samples with low-frequency consensus haplotypes (C-A-T and A-G-G haplotypes for prM/M and E, respectively), and for samples in which mixed infections with multiple WT haplotypes were detected (Figures 3A and 3B; genomes marked with #). The genetic concordance between WT and variant haplotypes in our samples strongly support the independent emergence and/or expansion of these hotspot variants within each individual, although we cannot completely exclude contributions from co-circulating variants at the prM 100,101 and E 315 loci. Taken together, our observations indicate that variants at the prM 100,101 and E 315 hotspot loci arose by convergent evolution during acute dengue, in at least four independent events, corresponding to the presence of the variants in four distinct haplotypes.",

We evaluated the replication phenotypes of WT and mutant viruses in C6/36 mosquito cells by directly competing each mutant virus with WT virus in co-infection experiments (Quiner et al., 2014) . Viral RNA mixtures from the input and from cellular supernatants collected 3, 4, and 5 days post infection (d.p.i.) were sequenced by the Sanger method to capture ratios of WT and mutant nucleotides at the prM 100,101 and E 315 hotspots using the polySNP program. The replicative index, calculated as the log 2 value of relative levels of WT and mutant viruses in the supernatant compared with relative levels in the input, was negative for prM 100,101 or E 315 mutant viruses at 3-5 d.p.i., indicating that both mutants were replication defective in C6/36 cells compared with WT ( Figure 4A ). In addition, we assessed the replication phenotypes of WT and mutant viruses in a human monocytic U937 cell line that expresses DC-SIGN, a co-receptor for DENV entry (Tassaneetrithep et al., 2003) (U937-DC-SIGN). Single infections were performed in U937-DC-SIGN cells with 625 GE/cell each of WT, prM 100,101 , and E 315 viruses. All three viruses were able to establish infection in U937-DC-SIGN cells; however, the percent of infected cells was considerably reduced in infections with prM 100,101 and E 315 variants compared with WT virus at 1, 2, and 3 d.p.i., as determined with both anti-E and anti-NS3 antibodies ( Figure 4B , left and right panels, respectively). No revertants were detected at 3 d.p.i. with either variant (data not shown). The E 315 variant also exhibited a temperature-sensitive (32 C versus 37 C) plaquing phenotype on baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) cells with better plaquing at 32 C, whereas the prM 100,101 variant plaqued relatively well at 37 C ( Figure S4 ). Our results thus demonstrate that the prM 100,101 and E 315 mutant viruses establish infections in C6/36 mosquito cells, U937-DC-SIGN human cells, and in BHK-21 mammalian cells with considerably reduced efficiencies due to the deleterious effects of these mutations on viral replicative ability.",

            "text": "The prM 100,101 and E 315 mutant viruses do not exhibit any defects in entry and behave similar to WT virus, as demonstrated by directly comparing entry capabilities of the three viruses using U937-DC-SIGN cells at 37 C ( Figure S5 ), suggesting that the replication defect for both prM 100,101 and E 315 mutant viruses is downstream of virus entry. We do not anticipate that these mutations have a direct impact on viral RNA replication, as none of the DENV structural proteins, except RNA elements in the Capsid gene (Byk and Gamarnik, 2016; Clyde et al., 2008; de Borba et al., 2015; Friebe et al., 2011; Selisko et al., 2014) , have been implicated in a direct role in RNA replication. In studies by Zheng et al. (2014) , mutations at prM 98 in DENV-1 were shown to result in impaired prM processing and decreased viral infectivity. prM 100 and prM 101 are situated only 2-3 amino acids away from prM 98 , and given the absence of entry and replication defects, we hypothesize that the prM 100,101 hotspot mutations likely impair prM processing and DENV infectivity, by a mechanism similar to prM 98 (Zheng et al., 2014) . Even though prM antibodies have been identified by several groups (Beltramello et al., 2010; Dejnirattisai et al., 2010) , the immune pressures driving evolution at the prM/M locus are poorly understood, and the origin of the prM 100,101 variant viruses remains elusive. In contrast, significantly more is known about the functionalities and antigenicity of loci in the E protein, and specifically the E 315 locus. Previous studies have shown that E 315 plays a pH-sensing role in mediating viral fusion with the endosome at the post-entry stage (Nelson et al., 2009) , suggesting that viruses with the E 315 hotspot mutation are likely impaired at the stage of viral membrane fusion with the endosomal membrane. Interestingly, the process of viral membrane fusion appears to be a significant target of anti-DENV antibodies during infection in humans, with fusion loop antibodies making up a significant proportion of the population of broadly reactive antibodies that are elicited during infection with DENV (Goncalvez et al., 2004; Lai et al., 2013) . Given the convergent nature of the immune response and the prevalence of the E 315 variant, it is conceivable that the E 315 variant arose as an immune-escape variant to fusion loop antibodies. Indeed, Goncalvez et al. (2004) demonstrated that after 11 cycles of passage in the presence of anti-fusion loop mAb 1A5, an escape mutation was isolated at E 317 in DENV-2, further supporting our claim that immune pressures exerted by fusion loop antibodies played a key role in convergent selection for variants at the analogous E 315 hotspot locus in DENV-3. Taken together, we conclude that the E 315 hotspot variant, despite possibly possessing an immune-escape advantage, is constrained to the intrahost evolutionary system because of the severe defects associated with viral membrane fusion post entry.",

In particular, we identified a highly prevalent DENV variant (E 315 ) that likely arose as an immuneescape variant in response to pressures exerted by fusion loop antibodies, yet was constrained by severe replicative defects likely incurred due to a deficiency in viral membrane fusion with the host endosome post entry. The identification of such convergent immune pressures that appear to result in the selection of prevalent immune-escape variants, especially ones that are constrained by replication defects or fitness costs, could be harnessed for intelligent selection of new candidates and targets for vaccine/drug design. Such snapshots of intrahost DENV diversity help to identify mechanisms driving virus microevolution in human dengue and provide new perspectives in assessing infection outcome, disease pathogenesis, and vaccine/ therapeutic efficacy in individuals.",

Plasma and PBMCs are collected from patients for three sequential days during the acute phase of illness, at convalescence (days 14-28) and longitudinally for 18 months. Criteria for identifying dengue-positive cases and for classifying by immune status are as described (Gutierrez et al., 2013; Narvaez et al., 2011) . Dengue cases are classified as DF, DHF, or DSS according to the 1997 WHO Dengue Guidelines (Narvaez et al., 2011; WHO, 1997) . Thirty-one plasma and 68 peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples from 77 individuals (including 22 with paired plasma and PBMC samples) were analyzed in this study. The gender identity as well as the age of the patients is listed in Table S1 . Extensive epidemiological and clinical data are available for these samples. The sample size for this study was determined by availability of pediatric patient samples for primary and secondary dengue cases caused by DENV-3 within a single endemic year (2009) (2010) . Subgroups within the 77 patients in the study were selected based on sample type (plasma versus PBMCs), clinical classification (for example, primary versus secondary dengue, Dengue Fever versus Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever and Dengue Shock Syndrome), or gene origin of variation (based on DENV-3 gene annotation).",

RNA was eluted in 50 ml of RNase-free water containing linear polyacrylamide (1 ml; Life Technologies), carrier RNA (0.1 ml; Qiagen), and SUPERase-In (1 ml; Life Technologies). Twelve RT/PCR amplifications were set up for each sample, with various combinations of forward and reverse primers (Table S4 ) and reagents from the SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR System (Invitrogen). For each reaction, we used 5 ul 500ml of U937-DC-SIGN culture medium at 4 C, and washed twice with 500ml PBS at 4 C. Then 350ml of lysis buffer was added to cell pellets, and RNA extraction was performed using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). qRT-PCR was performed as described above.",

All datasets were re-aligned to their corresponding consensus genomes using Bowtie2, and pileup files generated by SAMtools were filtered based on quality scores (R30). Fastq files for all the sequences generated in this study have been deposited into NCBI's Sequence Read Archive, and can be accessed using BioProject ID PRJNA394021. In-house scripts were used to calculate percent variant abundance in nucleotide, codon and amino acid coordinates at all loci with a minimum coverage of 5 reads. Threshold for Variant Abundance Replicate amplicon libraries were analyzed in a pairwise manner to set abundance thresholds for high-confidence variant detection. In replicate amplicon libraries from four PBMC samples, all variants that were detected at an abundance of R0.5% in replicate A were also detected in replicate B (Figure S1B, left panels) and vice versa",
