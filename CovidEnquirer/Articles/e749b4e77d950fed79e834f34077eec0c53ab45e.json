Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), which causes diarrhea in swine of all ages, is a worldwide-distributed alphacoronavirus with economic importance. Here, we screened PEDV RNA modification enzymes involved in regulating antiviral response. Whereas the PEDV nsp13 barely regulates type I IFN, inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF-a) and MHCII, nsp16 and nsp14 (to a lesser extent) down-regulate these antiviral effectors. Importantly, we found nsp16 KDKE tetrad appears to play a key role in interferon inhibition by mutating the D129 catalytic residue. Mechanistically, nsp16 down-regulates the activities of RIG-I and MDA5 mediated IFN-\u03b2 and ISRE. In turn, the mRNA levels of IFIT family members (IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3) was inhibited in cells overexpressing nsp16. In addition, nsp10 enhanced the inhibitory effect of nsp16 on IFN-\u03b2. Altogether these results indicate PEDV nsp16 negatively regulates innate immunity to promote viral proliferation. Findings from this study provides novel perspective to advance the understanding in the pathogenesis of PEDV.",

As multi-functional antiviral cytokines, type I interferons can be induced by virus infection, such as Sendai virus (SeV) (Schoggins et al., 2010) . Viral RNA is recognized as pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) by cytoplasmic sensors retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiationassociated gene 5 protein (MDA5) during viral infection (Meylan et al., 2006) . Next, RIG-I/MDA-5 binds to the mitochondrial adapter protein MAVS/IPS -1 , recruiting TNF receptor-associated factor 3/6 (TRAF3 and TRAF6) (Bradley and Pober, 2001) . TRAF3 activates I\u03baB kinase-\u03b5 (IKK\u03b5) inhibitor and downstream signaling of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1). The transcription factor NF-\u03baB and IRF3 are activated through different mechanisms. Activated IRF-3 and NF-\u03baB enter the nucleus and bind to the IFN-\u03b2 promoter, thereby activating transcription of IFN-\u03b2 (Thanos and Maniatis, 1995) .",

Accumulating evidence suggests that PEDV has developed a variety of strategies to evade the antiviral activities of IFN. Three PEDV nsps (nsp1, nsp3 and nsp5) have been identified as IFN-\u03b2 antagonists Jaru-Ampornpan et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2015) . PEDV nsp1 mainly disrupts the enhanceosome assembly of IRF3 and CREB-binding protein (CBP), resulting in degradation of CBP in the nucleus . PEDV nsp3 encodes papain-like protease 2 (PLP2) with deubiquitinating enzyme activity, which negatively regulates IFN-\u03b2 expression by removing ubiquitin chains from RIG-I (Jaru-Ampornpan et al., 2016) . PEDV nsp5 encoding a 3C-like protease specifically targets NEMO glutamate 231 (Q231) to cleave NEMO residues (Wang et al., 2015) . However, the effects and mechanisms of other PEDV non-structural proteins on type I interferons are still being studied extensively.",

The pathogenesis of these viruses might be related to the inefficient detection by the first line of antiviral response mediated by interferon (Rose et al., 2010; Devaraj et al., 2007; Li et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2011) . In order to evade recognition by the host viral RNA sensor RIG-I or MDA5, some virus encoded several methyltransferases involved in viral RNA capping to carry N7-methylation and 2\u2032O-methylation, similar to the host cell mRNA (Z\u00fcst et al., 2011a; Daffis et al., 2010; Furuichi and Shatkin, 2000) . For example, CoV nsp14 has been reported as a bifunctional enzyme with 3\u2032 -5\u2032 exoribonuclease (ExoN) and N7-MTase activities, and its N7-MTase activity is necessary to viral mRNA cap synthesis and prevents the recognition of viral mRNAs as \"non-self\" by the host cell (Becares et al., 2016) . Furthermore, ribose 2\u2032O-methylation in the cap structure of viral RNA contributes to escape from innate immune recognition. By biochemical assay, it was found that SARS-CoV nsp16 requires nsp10 as a stimulatory factor to execute its 2\u2032O-methyltransferase activity (Chen et al., 2011a) . However, the biological activity of PEDV-encoded methyltransferase in cells and their roles in innate immunity are not yet understood.",

Our results indicate that nsp14 and nsp16, which are methyltransferase in PEDV, are antagonists of innate immunity, and nsp16 is a more efficient regulator of immune-related genes. In addition, PEDV nsp16 is dependent on the KDKE tetrad to effectively reduce PEDV-induced IFN-\u03b2 production and promote virus proliferation. Interestingly, the phenomenon not only exists in the coronavirus, but also other virus, such as PRRSV, VSV. It's speculated that nsp16 is already partially active in absence of nsp10, or other cellular proteins replace the stimulatory factor role of nsp10. PEDV nsp16 appears to be a broadspectrum anti-innate immune enzyme. Our study provides a novel mechanism by which PEDV restricts interferon production and facilitate virus proliferation, providing a new means for prevention and control of PEDV.",

To explore whether three RNA modification enzymes (nsp13, nsp14 and nsp16) was involved in the regulation of innate immunity. Eukaryotic expression vectors for three RNA modification enzymes were successfully constructed and expressed (Fig. 1a) . Next, Flag-nsp13, Flag-nsp14, Flag-nsp16 expression Shi, et al. Virus Research 265 (2019) 57-66 plasmids or empty vector were transfected into IPEC-J2 cells, respectively, and then infected with 0.5 M PEDV for 12 h. The results showed that the expression of MHCI mRNA was significantly decreased when Flag-nsp13 was overexpressed in PEDV-infected cells, while nsp13 had no regulatory effect on other immune molecules compared with the control group (Fig. 1b) . Meanwhile, experimental data indicated that Flag-nsp14 or Flag-nsp16 expression inhibited PEDV-induced IFN-\u03b2 production, but nsp16 was more effective than others in inhibiting innate immune-related genes (Fig. 1c, d) . These data suggested that nsp16 appears to play a more important role in innate immunity control than nsp14. Later, we investigated the possible involvement of nsp16 in SeVtriggered IFN-\u03b2 signaling pathways processes. The results showed that nsp16 significantly inhibited the production of IFN-\u03b2 compared to other non-structural proteins or vector in IPEC-J2 cells (Fig. 1e) . The similar result was also observed in 293 T cells (Fig. 1f) . Consistently, the luciferase reporter system further confirmed that nsp16 inhibited IFN production in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1g) . Taken together, these data demonstrated that PEDV nsp16 negatively regulates IFN-\u03b2 production and antiviral immune responses.",

Importantly, the K-D-K-E, an invariant motif within the methyltransferase core required to mediate its activity, is highly conserved among all of the nsp16 (a) IPEC-J2 cells were transfected with pFlag-CMV2 (empty vector) or pFlag-CMV2-nsp13 (Flag-nsp13), pFlag-CMV2-nsp14 (Flag-nsp14), pFlag-CMV2-nsp16 (Flag-nsp16) plasmid respectively, the plasmid expression was detected by western blotting. (b-d) IPEC-J2 cells were transfected with empty vector or Flag-nsp13 (b), Flag-nsp14 (c), Flag-nsp16 (d) plasmid respectively. At 12 h post-transfection, cells were infected with 0.5 MOI PEDV for 12 h. The levels of IFN-\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, MHCI and MHCII mRNA were analyzed by qRT-PCR. (e) IPEC-J2 cells were transfected with empty vector, Flag-nsp13, Flag-nsp14, Flag-nsp16 plasmid respectively and stimulated with 0.1 MOI SeV or PBS (mock) for 12 h, IFN-\u03b2 mRNA levels were analyzed by qRT-PCR. (f) HEK293 T cells were transfected with Flag-nsp16 and stimulated with 0.1 MOI SeV for 12 h, IFN-\u03b2 mRNA levels were analyzed by qRT-PCR. (g) Increasing amounts (100 ng, 300 ng, 500 ng) of Flag-nsp16 or control plasmid together with IFN-\u03b2-luc reporter (50 ng), the LacZ (50 ng) were co-transfected in HEK293 T cells. At 12 h post-transfection, cells were infected with SeV (MOI 0.5) or not. After 12 h, the infected cells were collected and IFN-\u03b2 activation was analyzed by the luciferase reporter system. *P < 0.05**P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001 (analysis of two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post-test). Data are representative of three independent experiments. sequences detected in the CoV family (Fig. 2b) . The crystal structure of SARS coronavirus nsp16 has been resolved (Decroly et al., 2011) . PEDV nsp16 3D structure was modelled based on amino acid sequence homology (Fig. 2c) . Previous studies found that nsp16 lost the activity of methyltransferase when the tetrad aspartate was mutated to alanine (Feder et al., 2003) . PEDV nsp16 mutation (D129A) was unable to limit SeV-induced IFN induction in HEK293 T cells compared to Flag-nsp16 (WT) (Fig. 2d, e) . Taken together, these data indicated PEDV nsp16 inhibits PEDV-mediated IFN-\u03b2 production depending on its KDKE tetrad, indicating that inhibition of type I interferon production by nsp16 is associated with 2\u2032O-MTase enzyme activity. It is worth exploring that PEDV nsp16 also inhibits non-coronavirus mediated IFN-\u03b2 production in HEK293 T cells and its function depends on KDKE tetrad.",

In reporter assays, IFN-\u03b2 activation was triggered by poly I:C, RIG-I(N) and MDA5(N) respectively (Lin et al., 2016) . Compared to the control group, Flag-nsp16 (WT) but not Flag-nsp16 (D129A) reduced the RIG-I ligand poly I:C-induced IFN-\u03b2 activation (Fig. 3a) . Similarly, Flag-nsp16 significantly inhibited RIG-I-, MDA5-induced IFN-\u03b2 activation, while Flag-nsp16 (D129A) was not (Fig. 3b-c) . Consistently, ISRE activation triggered by poly I:C, RIG-I and MDA5 was downregulated by Flag-nsp16 (WT), and Flag-nsp16 (D129A)'s ability to inhibit ISRE Fig. 2 .

Consistently, the luciferase reporter system further confirmed that nsp10 was not an antagonist of interferon (Fig. 4b) . Then, the collective effect of PEDV nsp10 and nsp16 on interferon-mediated innate immunity was examined. Nsp10 significantly enhanced nsp16 inhibition of IFN-\u03b2 production in poly I:C-, RIG-I-and MDA5-stimulated interferon activation (Fig. 4c-e) . However, nsp10 did not alter the role of nsp16 (D129A) in poly I:C-, RIG-I-and MDA5-stimulated interferon activation (Fig. 4f-h) . Combined with Fig. 2 , PEDV nsp16 relies on the conserved KDKE motif to inhibit coronavirus-induced or non-coronavirus-induced IFN\u03b2 production and nsp10 enhances the inhibitory effect of nsp16.

Nsp16 promotes virus replication by suppressing cellular antiviral response PEDV nsp16 not only inhibits interferon produced by PEDV stimulation, but also non-coronal viruses such as SeV. Next, we attempted to determine if the antiviral effect of nsp16 is extensive. The IFIT (interferon-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats) family is a member of the interferon-stimulated gene that is regulated by viruses or interferons (Fensterl and Sen, 2015) , and IFIT proteins has been identified as potent antiviral proteins (Vladimer et al., 2014) . Three Sus scrofa IFIT family members (ISG56/IFIT1, ISG54/IFIT2, ISG49/IFIT3) detection primers were designed and the effect of PEDV nsp16 on the IFITs was detected. The results showed that nsp16 overexpression reduced the mRNA level of IFITs, especially IFIT1 (Fig. 6a) . The vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-GFP) was used to further substantiate the presence of biologically active IFN. Transfection with Flag-nsp16 was beneficial for VSV-GFP infection in IPEC-J2 cells (Fig. 6b) . Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) is also a positive-strand RNA virus, which has been found to be frequently mixed with PEDV in recent years. Interestingly, nsp16 also promoted the proliferation of PRRSV in 3D4/21 cells (Fig. 6c-e) . Furthermore, the expression of phosphorylated IRF3 in the interferon signaling pathway were also examined by western blotting. The results showed nsp16 inhibited IRF3 activation, while Flag-nsp16 (D129A) was not (Fig.6f) . Collectively, these data together reflect that nsp16 promotes virus replication by suppressing cellular antiviral response. ",

Studies have found that many viruses including coronaviruses developed a variety of mechanisms to evade innate antiviral immune responses, counteracting the antiviral effects of interferon, thereby establishing a persistent infection. For example, SARS-CoV nsp16 acts as a viral 2\u2032-O-MTase to escape innate immune recognition and facilitate viral replication (Minskaia et al., 2006b; Decroly et al., 2008; Z\u00fcst et al., 2011b) .

The PEDV mutant strain appeared in China until 2010, and its pathogenicity was significantly enhanced and rapidly spread (Sun et al., 2012) . The immunization of sows by passive immunization to protect newborn piglets is currently the main method of preventing PEDV. The existing PEDV commercial vaccine is based primarily on a live attenuated vaccine of the CV777 strain. Although the PEDV vaccine have improved in recent years, its immunoprotective effect is still insufficient (Changhee, 2015) .

Nsp13, nsp14 and nsp16 are mainly involved in the PEDV capping process and participate in the replication of the viral genome, and their role in the IFN signaling pathway is unclear. Here, we found PEDV nsp16 encoding 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase was an important interferon antagonist, both in PEDVinduced and SeV-induced interferon signaling pathways. PEDV nsp16 inhibited RIG-I-and MDA5-triggered signaling pathways and downregulated the activity of IFN-\u03b2 and ISRE promoters depending on the existence of the KDKE motif. Next, we examined the effect of nsp16 on PEDV viral load and found that Flag-nsp16 (WT) but not Flag-nsp16 (D129A) promotes PEDV proliferation. In addition, nsp16 promoted other non-coronavirus proliferation, such as SeV and PRRSV. Furthermore, the expression of nsp16 inhibited IRF3 phosphorylation in cells. The study indicated that PEDV nsp16 appears to be a broad-spectrum anti-innate immune enzyme. The pathogenesis of PEDV might be related to the inefficient detection by the first line of antiviral response mediated by interferon.",

Given that CoV nsp10 activates methyltransferase activity of nsp16, the data indicated that inhibition of type I interferon production by nsp16 was associated with its 2\u2032O-MTase enzyme activity. Additionally, PEDV nsp16 relies on the KDKE motif to inhibit virus-induced IFN\u03b2 production and improve virus replication. It is hypothesized that nsp16 can exert partially 2\u2032O-MTase activity independently in cells, or that there're unknown cellular proteins replacing nsp10 to activate nsp16 2\u2032O-MTase activity. After 24 h post-transfection, the cells were either mock-infected or infected with PRRSV at an 0.5 MOI at the indicated times. The loads of PRRSV N were tested by qRT-PCR, and PRRSV load was tested by TCID50 (d), and western blotting (e).
