ORF2 and ORF3 encode major (viral protein [VP] 1) and minor (VP2) capsid proteins. The GLPSG and YGDD motifs of the RdRp protein are conserved among all members of the family Caliciviridae (6) . The genus Norovirus currently comprises 5 genogroups, designated GI-GV, which can be grouped into at least 32 genetic clusters (2, 7) . Only viruses from GI, GII, and GIV have been associated with human disease. Recently, the fi nding of a novel GIV norovirus in a young dog (5) indicated that pets can be infected with NoVs.

Therefore, we tentatively classifed the Viseu strain, together with the Bari and Chiba strains, as a novel genogroup (GVI). To elucidate the potential pathogenic enteric role of the new canine NoV, we also tested all fecal specimens for CPV-2 and CCV, which are well-established enteric pathogens of dogs.

Because Portuguese law requires offi - cial shelters to provide sanctuary for unwanted animals and keep them as adoptable pets for a certain period, humans potentially could be exposed to canine NoV that could increase the possibility for the emergence of canine/human NoV recombinants and increase the likelihood of zoonotic transmission. Additional serologic studies are needed to determine the level of exposure to canine NoVs in dogs and humans similar to previous studies on bovine NoV (14) . Zoonotic transmission between dogs and humans is not new, and the close and often intimate interactions between these 2 species have been suggested as a major disease risk for humans (15) . Only a few studies on NoV infections in dogs have been reported (5, 13) . Experimental infections in gnotobiotic dogs could ultimately provide essential data for describing the prevalence of canine NoVs in dogs and their causal relationship with diarrhea.",
