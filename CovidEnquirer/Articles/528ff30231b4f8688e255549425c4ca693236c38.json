Clinical signs of infection include lethargy, an-orexia, vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and profound panleukopenia; mortality is highest in young susceptible cats. 12 In utero infection with FPV is a common cause of cerebellar hypoplasia. 12 Vaccination against FPV is highly recommended for all cats. Immunity to 'feline panleukopenia is primarily through antibody response to natural infection, vaccination, or passive transfer of maternal antibodies from queen to kittens. Maternal antibody may interfere with immunization when antibody titers are high during the neonatal period. Maternal antibody titers generally wane sufficiently to allow immunization by 12 weeks of age. 47 Immunity conferred by feline panleukopenia vaccines is considered to be excellent, and most vaccinated animals are completely protected from infection and clinical disease.

Experimental studies have shown that intranasal administration of canine parvovirus-2 vaccines to puppies is less effective than parenteral administration in overcoming maternal antibody interference (Ronald Schultz, PhD, personal communication, 2000). The most likely reasons are that fewer virus particles reach lymphoid tissue when the product is given intranasally compared with parenteral administration and viral replication in lymphoid tissue is required for immunization with MLV parvovirus vaccines. Although studies have not been performed in cats, the same phenomenon may occur in this species. Caution is appropriate when contemplating the use of intranasal FPV vaccines for primary immunization of kittens, especially those residing in environments where exposure to FPV is likely.",

Vaccination against FeLV is recommended for cats at risk of exposure (i.e., cats not restricted to a closed, FeLV-negative, indoor environment), especially those younger than 4 months of age. Vaccination is not recommended for cats with minimal to no risk of exposure, especially those older than 4 months of age. The ability of a particular vaccine brand to induce an immune response sufficient to resist persistent viremia varies from study to study.s3 Because protection is not induced in all vaccinates, preventing exposure to infected cats remains the single best way to prevent FeLV infection. Vaccination against FeLV does not diminish the importance of testing cats to identify those that are viremic. It is of critical importance that viremic cats not be in contact with other cats, especially those younger than 4 months of age. As a result, the FeLV infection status of all cats should be determined.13 Adverse events associated with vaccination against FeLV include local swelling or pain, transient lethargy or fever, and postvaccination granuloma formation. Although vaccine-associated sarcomas have been reported to develop in association with administration of other vaccines, current data suggest that they are more frequently associated with administration of FeLV vaccines and adjuvanted rabies virus vaccines. 28 If vaccination is deemed appropriate, annual revaccination is recommended. Cats should be tested for FeLV infection before initial vaccination and when there is a possibility that they have been exposed to FeLV since they were vaccinated. The enzyme-linked immu-nosorbent assay is the preferred screening test; the indirect immunofluorescent assay is the preferred confirmatory test.13 Individuals confirmed to be infected with FeLV need not receive FeLV vaccines, but they should be segregated from uninfected cats.",

            "text": "Feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) vary considerably in pathogenic potential and have historically been grouped into two biotypes: feline enteric coronaviruses, which typically cause subclinical to mild enteric infections, and feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) viruses, which cause FIP. Currently, PIP viruses are believed to be generated as mutant variants in feline enteric coronavirus-infected cats. 58 ,59 FCoVs are widespread in feline populations worldwide, with seropositivity rates highest in crowded multiple-cat environmentsY Transmission of the virus is mainly via the fecal-oral route. In environments in which FCoV infection is endemic (e.g., most multiple-cat environments), 35% to 70% of cats are shedding FCoVs in the stool at any given time. 16, 22 Most infected cats remain healthy, although a few (usually between 1% and 5%) ultimately develop FIP. Affected cats rarely survive regardless of treatment. 43 Kittens are most often affected with FIP, but the disease reportedly can develop in cats of all ages. A genetic predisposition has been suggested, with higher disease incidence in certain lines. 15, 43 Considerable controversy surrounds the ability of the currently available FIP vaccine (Primucell-FIP; Pfizer Animal Health, Exton, PA) to prevent disease. Some studies demonstrate protection from disease I9 ,24; others show little benefit from vaccination. 36 ,51 Antibody-dependent enhancement of disease in vaccinates has been demonstrated in experimental challenge exposUJ'e studies,50 but it is uncertain whether antibody-dependent enhancement occurs in a natural setting. Discrepancies between study results are probably attributable to differences in test methodology (e.g., strain and dose of challenge virus, genetic predisposition of the test animals). Protection from disease has not been demonstrated in animals vaccinated when younger than 16 weeks of age. Most kittens born and reared in environments in which FCo V infection is endemic are infected before reaching this age. l , 22 In these instances, vaccination of infected cats has not proven beneficial. At this time, there is no evidence that the vaccine induces clinically relevant protection, and its use is not recommended. canis infection is not recommended. At the time of this writing, the product has not been independently evaluated for efficacy. Based on studies conducted by the manufacturer, it is reasonable to consider vaccination as adjunctive treatment for individual infected cats 4 months of age or older to hasten resolution of clinical signs. If the vaccine induces an immune response that accelerates lesion resolution, the number of infectious fungal spores produced by vaccinates may be reduced as well; thus, it is reasonable to consider vaccination as one component of a comprehensive treatment program in multiple-cat environments in which M. canis infection is endemic. Nonetheless, the ability of this product to hasten elimination of endemic infections from such environments has not been evaluated. The revaccination interval is not stipulated on the label. Major adverse events reportedly associated with the use of this product are pain, temporary hair loss, and formation of sterile abscesses or granulomas at the vaccine site. 38",

The natural route of transmission in cats is believed to be via the aerosol or intranasal route. 8 Experimental challenge exposure studies have shown that B. bronchiseptica can act as a primary pathogen in cats; inoculation of specific-pathogen-free kittens results in self-limiting disease characterized by variable degrees of fever, nasal or ocular discharge, sneezing, induced or spontaneous coughing, pulmonary rales, and submandibular lymphadenopathy.8 Bronchopneumonia associated with naturally occurring B. bronchiseptica infection has been reported in kittens and adult cats. 60 Other factors, including nutritional status, overcrowding, coinfection with other agents such as FeV or FHV-1, and suboptimal hygiene, may influence the outcome of exposure. 41 .S 4 Seroprevalence surveys suggest that exposure to the organism is common, with infection rates varying from population to population. The highest rates of seropositivity (often over 80%) are found among cats in rescue shelters and multiple-cat households, especially when there is a history of respiratory tract disease. The lowest rates are found among cats in households with few cats and no history of respiratory tract disease. 4 \u2022 37 Similarly, isolation rates vary. B. bronchiseptica was isolated from the oropharynx in 19 of 614 (3.1%) asymptomatic cats and from the distal trachea in 6 of 614 (1%) asymptomatic cats from shelters in Lousiana. 2s In a recent survey of 740 cats in the United Kingdom, none of the household cats were found to be infected, but 9% of cats from breeding colonies and 19% of cats from rescue shelters were found to be carrying the organism. s In the same survey, 9% of healthy cats and 14% of cats with respiratory tract disease tested positive for the organism. An additional finding was a strong positive association between oropharyngeal isolation of B. bronchiseptica and residence in households containing dogs with a recent history of respiratory tract disease.",
