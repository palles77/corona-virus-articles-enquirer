            "text": "The objective of this cross-sectional study was to determine how management practices on California dairies may be associated with bovine respiratory disease (BRD) in preweaned calves. A convenience sample of 100 dairies throughout California, providing a study population of 4,636 calves, were visited between May 2014 and April 2016. During each farm visit, in-person interviews with the herd manager or calf caretaker were conducted to collect information about herd demographics, maternity pen, colostrum and calf management, herd vaccinations, and dust abatement. A random sample of preweaned calves was identified and evaluated for the presence of BRD using a standardized tool. A survey-adjusted generalized linear mixed model with a logit link function was fitted with calf as the unit of analysis and dairy as the random effect. Mean study herd size (\u00b1SE) was 1,718 (\u00b1189.9) cows. Survey-adjusted estimates of breed types in the sample were 81.6% (\u00b10.6) Holstein, 13.1% (\u00b10.4) Jersey, and 5.3% (\u00b10.5) crossbred or other purebred breeds, and calf sex proportions were 73.8% (\u00b11.0) female and 26.2% (\u00b11.0) male. Overall survey-adjusted BRD prevalence in the study herds was 6.91% (\u00b10.69). Housing factors positively associated with BRD were metal hutches compared with wood hutches [odds ratio (OR) = 11.19; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.80-44.78], calf-to-calf contact in calves >75 d of age (OR = 9.95, 95% CI = 1.50-65.86), feeding Holstein calves <2.84 L of milk or replacer per day (OR = 7.16, 95% CI = 1.23-41.68), and lagoon water used for flushing manure under hutches compared with no flush (OR = 12.06, 95% CI = 1. 93-75.47). Providing extra shade over hutches (OR = 0.08; 95% CI = 0.02-0.37), feeding calves at least 90% saleable milk (OR = 0.27, 95% CI = 0.13-0.54) or pasteurized milk (OR = 0.10; 95% CI = 0.03-0.36), and feeding >5.68 L of milk or replacer per day to Jersey calves (OR = 0.04; 95% CI = 0.01-0.28) were negatively associated with BRD. Our study identified management practices on California dairies with variability and that may contribute to differences in BRD prevalence, which will be incorporated into a risk-assessment tool to control and prevent BRD in preweaned dairy calves.",

In addition, 18.1% of preweaning heifers on dairy heifer-raising operations were reportedly affected by pneumonia, making it the second most common calf illness after diarrhea (USDA, 2012) .

The complexity of etiologic agents and predisposing factors for BRD combined with the difficulty of accurate diagnosis pose challenges in the prevention and control of this disease on the farm that may be addressed using a risk-assessment approach in combination with a disease-scoring system. A multitude of tests can be used to identify pneumonia calves in a herd; however, scoring systems require minimal training, are low cost, and can be reasonably accurate, making them a viable tool to estimate the disease burden in the herd (Love et al., 2014 (Love et al., , 2016b . Repeated use of a risk-assessment tool to target preventive management practices combined with a scoring system to benchmark the burden of BRD in a calf herd over time may offer a low-cost, rapid, and comprehensive control program for BRD. In contrast to a chronic disease, such as Johne's disease, where changes implemented to control the disease may not result in a reduction in incidence for many years, BRD primarily presents as an acute disease. With the daily influx of newborn calves, changes in incidence may be observed within months of implementation of the prevention or control program.",

            "text": "Dairies in California differ in many ways from dairies in other parts of the United States. For example, the average dairy herd size for California in 2016 was 1,249 milking cows, with herds up to 10,000 milking cows, whereas the latest report on dairy cattle management practices published by USDA categorizes herd sizes with more than 500 cows as large (California Department of Food and Agriculture, 2016; USDA, 2016a). Other differences include California's climate, which allows for year-round outdoor housing of calves and cattle, which is impractical in many parts of the country (Lago et al., 2006) . Climate and dairy management practices in California are not homogeneous across the state, however. As an example, in 2011, California held 22.6% of the nation's organic dairy cows, most of which were found in the northern part of the state . It is clear, that the development of a risk-assessment tool for California dairies cannot be based on national averages but should be based on data collected from within this unique industry. The objective of our study was to identify factors associated with BRD in preweaned calves on California dairies by correlating management practices on California dairy farms to prevalence of BRD in calves exposed to these practices. Our hypothesis was that BRD is associated with management practices related to risk factors for BRD, such as the amount of colostrum and milk fed, housing type, and vaccinations. The research described here is a further step in the development of a risk-assessment tool for BRD in preweaned calves on California dairies following the survey of management practices related to BRD in preweaned calves on California dairies (Love et al., 2016a) .",

In 2013, managers of 1,523 California dairy herds were surveyed using 2 mail questionnaires followed by a reminder card after each mailing. The survey aimed to identify the variety of management practices known to be associated with the incidence of BRD in preweaned calves with the purpose of characterizing these practices, comparing them across geographic regions of the state, and determining the principal components that explain the variability in management between herds (Love et al., 2016a) . Respondents to the survey were given the option of providing contact information if they were interested in participating in a follow-up study. In addition to respondents who showed willingness for a follow-up herd visit, we sought local dairies, veterinarians, consultants, farm advisors, and dairy owners through personal contacts to enroll farms. Emphasis was placed on inclusion of a wide range of herd sizes, geographical locations, and management styles into the sample. The study protocol was approved by the University of California at Davis Animal Care and Use Committee (Approval # 19241) .",

The 10 individuals conducting the interviews consisted of veterinarians, graduate students, research assistants, animal scientists, extension and outreach specialists, and farm advisors who were all familiar with the California dairy industry. All interviewers were trained on the use of the California BRD scoring system and were accompanied by a more experienced team member during their first farm visit. Interviewees were instructed to answer questions based on management practices in place only as far back as when the oldest calf eligible to be enrolled was born. The number of calves on the premises was determined as part of the questionnaire. Once the questionnaire was completed, study personnel proceeded to score a random number of calves based on the total number of calves on the farm to estimate the calf herd's BRD prevalence. The random sample was drawn from all individually housed calves and calves in groups on a milk diet and included calves that were recently weaned if still housed in a hutch. Sample sizes of calves to be scored for N = 100 (n = 44), 250 (n = 58), 500 (n = 66), 750 (n = 69), 1,000 (n = 70), and 1,500 (n = 72) calves on the farm were calculated per equation 1 and sheets with random numbers between 1 and N prepared in a spreadsheet (Excel 2007 . The sheet with the next larger N was used for selecting the sample of calves. Scoring started typically with the youngest calf followed by counting of hutches according to the random number sheet until the next calf on the list was reached and scored and so on until the oldest eligible calf was reached. Apart from the clinical signs that are part of the BRD score, the calf's ear tag number, sex, and date of birth were recorded. Breed was recorded as Holstein, Jersey, or other, the latter including other purebred breeds as well as crossbred animals. Hutch type for each calf was described in terms of floor and wall materials, whether a roof was partial, full, or absent, whether extra shade was provided, and the dimensions of the hutch or pen. In addition, the elevation of the hutch floor from the ground, the presence and type of a flush system for manure, and the number of calves in the enclosure were recorded as well as whether calf-to-calf contact with other calves was possible. Further, the distance from the hutch to the nearest dust area was measured. Maternity pens were visited, dimensions of pens were measured, and hygiene scores for 15 cows were assigned according to a 4-point system. A score of 1 indicated no manure soiling above the pastern; score 2 indicated manure soiling on the lower leg; score 3 indicated manure soiling on the upper leg, udder, and abdomen; and score 4 indicated manure soiling on udder or abdomen and toward spine (Farmers Assuring Responsible Management, 2016) . If fewer than 15 cows were present in the maternity pen, all cows present were scored. The dimensions of hutches (width and depth) as well as maternity pens and group pens (width and depth) were measured in feet and inches and transformed to metric measurements for analysis.",

Colostrum source was categorized as 100% individual cow or nursing from dam (R), 100% pooled from multiple cows, or a mix of those sources including colostrum replacer. Colostrum from individual cows and colostrum nursed from the dam were combined into a single category because the quality of the colostrum from these sources was regarded as equal. For those dairies that heat-treated their colostrum, the time between colostrum harvest and heat-treatment was categorized into either less than (R) or more than 6 h. The distribution of storage time for colostrum before feeding in hours underwent a square root transformation to achieve normality. If colostrum was stored for less than 2 h, zero hours were recorded for colostrum storage time. Storage temperature for colostrum was recorded as either room temperature (R), refrigerated, frozen, or first refrigerated then frozen. A variable for colostrum storage temperature had indicator variables for each of the 4 storage temperatures. The type of storage container for colostrum was dichotomized as solid (R) or bags, as thawing frozen colostrum stored in bags may achieve a more uniform increase in colostrum temperature compared with colostrum stored in plastic bottles and may result in less heat damage to immunoglobulins. The variable for percent of colostrum fed that is from firstcalf heifers was dichotomized into the categories any or no (R) colostrum from first calf heifers.

Four dairies let calves nurse from their dams to meet the calves' colostrum needs; hence, estimates for the amount of colostrum fed in the first 12 h on these dairies could not be made. In addition, a dichotomous variable for whether or not (R) colostrum was tested for immunoglobulin content and a dichotomous variable for whether or not (R) calves were assessed for failure of transfer of passive immunity based on serum total protein were explored in the model.",

This was done because these variables provide information about the whole cohort of preweaned calves and are not suitable for analyzing the association of management practices and BRD in individual calves. Data on the percent of calves raised on the premises from other dairies was dichotomized into any or no (R) calves from other dairies on the premises. The variable feeding order by age was created with indicator variables for the answer choices youngest typically fed first (R), calves fed in no particular order, and oldest typically fed first. Only 1 dairy in the sample used a BRD scoring system; hence, the variable describing use of such systems was dropped from analysis. As some dairies gave multiple answers to the question about what surfaces, driven on daily, cover the roads adjacent to the calf-raising area, dichotomized variables for paved, gravel, dirt, or other (hay, fly ash, and shavings) surfaces were created and analyzed as separate variables. Similarly, dichotomized variables for dust-abatement procedures were created describing whether or not water, magnesium chloride, or other dust-abatement measures (limiting speed, no driving through the area, restricting entry, oiling of driveway) were implemented (Amato et al., 2014) . For the question on how often dust was a problem in the area where preweaned calves were housed, a categorical variable was created with never as the reference and the indicator variables rarely (weeks pass without dust), no week passes by without dust, daily during the nonrainy season, and daily all year round.",

Dichotomous variables for each of the reported floor materials were specified where absence of the specific floor material was the R [concrete, rubber, sand, Tenderfoot (Tandem Products, Inc., Minneapolis), dirt, grass, wood, and bedding]. In addition, dichotomous variables for slatted floors (wooden floors with slats) and floors that allow airflow (slatted floors and Tenderfoot) were specified. Wall materials were categorized with indicator variables for only wood (R), only metal, only plastic, and a category for a mix of materials or group pens. Fourteen dairies had at least some hutches that were made of a combination of materials, such as wood and metal or metal and plastic. Calves housed in groups were added to the latter category to be able to assess the association of a single hutch material on an individually housed calf without losing group-housed calves or calves in hutches made from a mix of materials in the analysis. In addition, a dichotomous variable for solid walls (R) or nonsolid walls (wire metal or metal bars as material) was specified to explore an association with air flow in hutches and BRD. A categorical variable describing the presence and type of flush system under the calf hutches was specified with 3 levels: no flush (R), fresh water flush, or flush with lagoon water. A categorical variable describing the presence and type of extra shade structures above calf hutches was specified with levels no cover (R), partial roof, complete roof without side walls, complete roof with 1 to 3 side walls, and fully indoors.",

The number of times the bedding is changed in the calving pens was dichotomized into less than or equal to 5 times (R) and more than 5 times per month. Typical maternity pen bedding type was summarized into categories of plant fiber (almond shells, rice hulls, straw, wood shavings, sawdust, wood chips, cotton stock, recycled wood product), recycled manure (R), gypsum or lime, dirt (which included sand), and pasture. Those dairies that answered no maternity pen exists or no bedding in maternity pen were assigned to the category sand or dirt. Dichotomous variables were created for the presence or absence (R) of each type of bedding, as multiple dairies used more than 1 type of bedding. The data for the percent of calves removed in 1 h from the dam was dichotomized into \u226595 and <95% (R). Vaccine timing and frequency for cows and calves was dichotomized into whether a type of vaccine was given or not (R). The time since vaccination for each calf was estimated as the time between the reported age when calves receive a certain type of vaccine as stated by the interviewee in the questionnaire and the age of the calf at the time of visit. Dichotomous variables were created describing whether a certain type of vaccine was given at least 7 d before the visit to account for the fact that there is a variable lag time between vaccine administration and an immune reaction. Hygiene scores for up to 15 cows present in the maternity pen during the dairy visit were transformed into cumulative hygiene scores, which facilitated comparisons of percent of cows scoring 1, 1 and 2, or 1 and 2 and 3 versus the percent of cows scoring the respective remaining scores.",

Our results suggest that management relative to both housing and calf feeding practices may be the most important areas associated with the prevalence of BRD in young dairy calves on California dairies. Using lagoon water for flushing under hutches, the use of metal hutches, as well as calf-to-calf contact in older calves, and feeding Holstein calves \u22642.84 L of milk or replacer per day were all positively associated with BRD. Pasteurizing milk, feeding saleable milk, feeding Jersey calves more than 5.68 L of milk or replacer per day, and providing extra shelter were all negatively associated with BRD. Interestingly, no associations were found between vaccinating dams or calves or the amount or quality of colostrum fed and BRD. Management factors significantly associated with BRD in our study may reflect some of the areas where the California dairy industry is less uniform and where changes may have the biggest effect on BRD prevalence. Current knowledge based on numerous studies underscore colostrum management and vaccinations as important components of BRD prevention; however, the current study's dairies may have exhibited uniform colostrum and vaccination practices. The principal component analysis of a California survey on management practices related to bovine respiratory disease in preweaned dairy calves performed in 2013 identified calf housing as the component construct with the largest variation proportion (Love et al., 2016a) . The component construct contained the variables hutch style, calf contact, flush used, and waste milk fed to heifers. Three of these variables (hutch style, calf-to-calf contact, and flush) were significantly associated with BRD in our study, supporting the idea that these are areas of highly variable management on California dairies. Although we did not observe an association between the fourth variable in the construct (waste milk fed to heifers) and BRD in our study, we did observe a negative association between BRD and feeding saleable milk for at least 7 d, which is one of the alternatives to feeding waste milk.",

Herd sizes are expected to increase (USDA, 2016a), so the calves enrolled in our study likely represent a growing proportion of dairy calves raised in California. Nationally, Holsteins make up 86.0% (\u00b11.4 SE), Jerseys 7.8% (\u00b11.2 SE), and other breeds 6.2% of US dairy cows (USDA, 2016a), compared with 81.6% Holsteins, (\u00b10.6 SE), 13.1% Jerseys (\u00b10.4 SE), and 5.3% crossbred (\u00b10.5 SE) calves in our study. Jersey cows have increased in popularity over the last years in California due to their higher milk fat content and potential for higher feed-to-milk conversion ratios among other health related reasons (Mackle et al., 1996; Washburn et al., 2002; White et al., 2002) . Although no official statistics for California dairy breeds are available, it may not be unreasonable to assume that Jersey cows are more common in California than nationally. Organic farms make up 6.5% of California dairies and are overrepresented in our sample (21.0%; USDA, 2016b); however, this overrepresentation has the advantage of providing more accurate estimates for management practices from this sector of California's dairy industry.

Estimated odds ratios (OR) for joint effects for total volume of milk or milk replacer fed per day and breed on bovine respiratory disease (BRD) in 4,253 1 calves on California dairies was similar to the proportion of dairies that reported housing calves individually (93.3%) in the survey of California dairies by Love et al. (2016a) , but larger than the mean nationally (69.7%; USDA, 2016a). Given the similar order of magnitude in breed distribution and other factors, such as organic status and individual calf housing, results of our study could be extrapolated to dairies in California and elsewhere that fall within the study herds' description and climate.",

            "text": "Case definitions for BRD vary widely between studies and, therefore, any comparisons of results should be interpreted with caution. Some studies rely on treatment records by dairy staff, whereas others use certain clinical signs for diagnosis, which may also differ between studies. Most epidemiological studies on BRD in dairy calves report incidence rates rather than prevalence. Lago et al. (2006) found a prevalence of 14.3% in 225 dairy calves housed in barns in the winter in Wisconsin and diagnosed with the Wisconsin BRD scoring system for preweaned calves. Buczinski et al. (2017) found a median prevalence of 8% in the summer and 15% in the winter for lung consolidation diagnosed by ultrasound, consistent with BRD in preweaned calves in 39 dairy herds in Qu\u00e9bec. Indoor housing and poor ventilation are associated with BRD, so the higher prevalence in the Wisconsin and Qu\u00e9bec studies in the winter is not unexpected (Callan and Garry, 2002; Gorden and Plummer, 2010) . Both Buczinski et al. (2017) and Lago et al. (2006) reported a gradual increase in prevalence from birth to the sixth and seventh week of life, respectively; we observed a similar rise in prevalence, which continued until 65 d of age (Supplemental Figure S1 ; https: / / doi .org/ 10 .3168/ jds .2018 -14773). The fact that most of the calves in the current study were housed outdoors may explain the lower prevalence observed of 6.9%, comparable to what Buczinski et al. (2017) observed in the summer. Distributions of the percent of cases by age stratified by breed or region are shown in Supplemental Figures S2 and S3 (https: / / doi .org/ 10 .3168/ jds .2018 -14773), respectively.",

The role of lagoon water on a dairy as a source of infective agents has mainly been studied with respect to enteric pathogens, including Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis, Salmonella spp. and Escherichia coli and its effect on antimicrobial resistance in some of the pathogens (Aly and Thurmond, 2005; Grewal et al., 2006; Li et al., 2014; Ravva and Sarreal, 2014) . Alhamlan et al. (2013) found members of the Flaviviridae in lagoon water samples, a family of viruses that contains bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV). Although the viruses were not categorized to the species level in Alhamlan et al. (2013) , it is conceivable that lagoon water could be a potential source for exposure to respiratory pathogens if used as flush water, especially if aerosolized particles are created, potentially resulting in in-halation of pathogens. If flush water is close enough to hutch floors, calves could also be able to ingest or have direct exposure of oral or nasal mucosae to pathogens. In addition to BVDV, bovine coronavirus is shed via feces (Oma et al., 2016) and could cause respiratory disease in calves. The significance of lagoon water as a source of pathogenicity with respect to BRD should be further evaluated.",

Shade could reduce heat stress as well as protect from rain or frost, resulting in lower odds of BRD. The association between shade and BRD was not observed for shade structures with 1 to 4 sidewalls, which could be due to an offset of the benefits due to a lack of ventilation. Coleman et al. (1996) studied the effect of supplemental shade structures over polyethylene calf hutches in Alabama during the summer on feed consumption, growth, calf stress, and bedding contamination. Their study found no differences between groups in terms of health-related outcomes, but humidity and coliform counts in bedding were higher in shaded hutches, which may be due to the difference in climate between the 2 states, specifically the higher humidity in Alabama during the summer months.",

            "text": "Feeding pasteurized milk versus nonpasteurized milk, including milk replacer, was associated with reduced BRD prevalence. Numerous studies have underlined the importance of pasteurizing milk fed to dairy calves for the prevention of enteric disease as well as exposure to potential respiratory pathogens (e.g., Mycoplasma spp. or BVDV; Pf\u00fctzner and Sachse, 1996; Callan and Garry, 2002) . Mycoplasma spp. are mastitis pathogens that can be shed by clinically or subclinically infected cows and can colonize the nasopharynx of calves fed the milk resulting in otitis and respiratory disease (Pf\u00fctzner and Sachse, 1996; Walz et al., 1997) . Mycoplasma and other bacterial pathogens ingested in the milk can also spread hematogenously to the lungs, where they cause respiratory disease (Callan and Garry, 2002) . A study from Spain found decreased morbidity and mortality in calves with adequate transfer of passive immunity (\u22655.8 g/dL serum total protein) during the first 3 wk of life that were fed heat-treated colostrum and pasteurized milk versus those that received nonheat-treated colostrum and nonpasteurized milk (Armengol and Fraile, 2016) . A separate study by Godden et al. (2005) found a higher risk of pneumonia in calves fed milk replacer than for calves fed pasteurized waste milk. Those authors argued that the improved immune function was attributable to higher energy and protein intake or the presence of medium-chain fatty acids in the whole milk, which have shown antimicrobial effects in pigs. We also observed a negative association of feeding a diet consisting of at least 90% saleable milk for at least 7 d at time of farm visit with BRD versus any other milk diet, including waste milk or milk replacer. Several studies have evaluated the effect of milk intake volume on calf performance (Jasper and Weary, 2002; Johnson et al., 2017) . Studies evaluating the amounts of milk fed to calves on health outcomes have found mixed effects. Medrano-Galarza et al. (2018) found no associations between within-pen prevalence of BRD and peak milk allowance in a study of majority Holstein group-housed dairy calves fed with automated milk feeders. However, calves in that study were fed at least 4 L per calf per day before and at least 6 L per calf per day after introduction to the group pen. A different study, similarly found no difference in incidence of BRD between Holstein calves fed a maximum of 6 or 8 L of milk replacer per day in a randomized trial comparing performance and health response of dairy calves offered different milk replacer allowances (Bach et al., 2013) . Higher amount and quality of milk replacer fed was found to be associated with superior immune function in Jersey calves (Ballou, 2012) . The group of Holstein calves fed \u22642.84 L of milk or replacer per day in our study was fed less than the lowest amounts supplied to calves in the above-mentioned studies and were likely not able to consume enough starter to meet their nutrient requirements for growth and development if they were under 2 mo old (Jasper and Weary, 2002) . Results in our study showed increased odds of BRD for Holstein calves fed \u22642.84 L and decreased odds of BRD in Jersey calves fed >5.68 L of milk or replacer, which may reflect the effects of nutrition on immune function but should be interpreted with caution due to the relatively small samples in those categories, resulting in large confidence intervals for estimates. Restricting the analysis to calves \u226475 d of age did not change the sign or statistical significance of contrasts except for the comparison of >5.68 to \u22642.84 L of milk or replacer in Jersey calves, which became nonsignificant (P = 0.22). Future research should quantify the benefits of saleable milk compared with waste milk or milk replacer further, as well as how the association with BRD is modified by pasteurization and amount of milk fed in the major dairy breeds.",

            "text": "The current study found no significant associations between calf or dam vaccination status for respiratory pathogens and BRD in the study population. Due to the cross-sectional nature, it was not possible to ascertain the vaccination status of calves in the study with certainty, instead we relied on the in-person surveyreported vaccination protocols, although respondents were asked to answer the questions with respect to the current cohort of calves on their premises during the visit. If calves were older than the age of vaccination stated in the questionnaire they were considered vaccinated. However, the true vaccination status and time since vaccination may have been different for an unknown number of calves. No associations between reported vaccination status and BRD were found when calves at least 7 d older than age of vaccination were considered vaccinated to account for time to initiate an immune response. Our findings correlated with a randomized clinical trial by Windeyer et al. (2012) of 2,874 heifer calves on 19 commercials dairy farms in Minnesota and Ontario, in which they found no difference in risk of BRD between calves vaccinated at 2 or 5 wk of age or both with a commercial multivalent modified live vaccine against the common respiratory viruses compared with a placebo control group. Those authors cited interference by maternal antibodies, unresponsiveness of the neonatal immune system, timing of immunity relative to pathogen exposure, disease caused by pathogens other than the viruses in the vaccine, or herd immunity as possible explanations for their findings. The vaccination of dams may only be effective in preventing calfhood BRD in combination with adequate transfer of passive immunity. Many factors can affect the efficiency of transfer of passive immunity, from the amount, quality, and timing of colostrum fed to the storage time and temperature (Pithua et al., 2013 , Williams et al., 2014 , Lago et al., 2018 . It is possible that any positive effect of dam vaccination may have been diluted by other variables affecting transfer of passive immunity. In a longitudinal study following over 11,300 preweaned calves on 5 dairies in California and associating management factors to BRD in the calves, vaccinating dams with either a killed or a modified live vaccine reduced the risk of disease in calves. . The longitudinal study design combined with close follow-up of management practices by verifying changes every 1 to 4 mo in a few dairies may have been the reason that study found these associations, whereas in the present study they were not apparent. The complexity of factors involving vaccination of neonatal calves combined with the present study design make it difficult to extend recommendations based on our findings.",

Windeyer et al. (2014) reported serum total protein levels \u22655.7 g/dL during the first week of life as well as supplementation with an antibody product at birth to be negatively associated with BRD, but the predictive value positive was low (18%) when using serum total protein levels at the cutpoint of <5.7 g/dL to predict BRD. In a study by Virtala et al. (1999) , low postcolostral total serum IgG concentrations \u22641,200 mg/dL was associated with increased risk of BRD in a prospective cohort study of 410 preweaned heifer calves. Diagnostic accuracy of prediction in that study was 54%. Both groups of authors (Windeyer et al., 2014; Virtala et al., 1999) stated that additional factors could play a role in the development of BRD. The current study did not include data on failure of transfer of passive immunity for the study calves. The data on volume of colostrum fed as well as whether colostrum from first-calf heifers was used and if the quality of colostrum was assessed served as proxies for adequate passive transfer. The fact that all colostrum-management variables had to be assessed on a herd-level basis may have masked the effect of colostrum quality fed to individual calves in the study, as it was unknown which calves received colostrum from first-calf heifers or colostrum stored at a certain temperature or for a certain amount of time if there was variability within a dairy.",
