            "text": "Background: The aim of this study was to examine the rate of transmission of influenza and other respiratory viruses from children attending an Emergency Department to their family members in the household using active surveillance. Methods: A prospective hospital-based study was conducted over three consecutive winters (2006)(2007)(2008) in children aged <1-15 years presenting with influenza-like illness (ILI). 168 children with ILI and their healthy families were recruited over three winter seasons. Results: Respiratory viruses were detected in 101 (60.8%) children with ILI; in 91/166 (54.8%) a single pathogen was detected, and in the remaining 10 children more than one virus was detected concurrently. Influenza was the most common virus detected (34/101), followed by rhinoviruses (22/101) and adenoviruses (14/101). Of influenza viruses, 21/34 were influenza A and 13/34 influenza B. Meeting the clinical definition of ILI did not differentiate between influenza and other viruses. Clinical ILI developed within one week of follow up in 12% (26/205) of the family members who were swabbed. Viral pathogens were detected in 42.3% (11/26) of the symptomatic family members. In 6/11 cases the same virus was detected in the adult and child. The lower estimate of the household risk of transmission of respiratory viruses, based on concordant proven infection in both child and adult, from a single sick child to adult household contacts is therefore 3% per week. Conclusion: This study provides quantitative, prospective data on rates of household transmission of infection from children to adults.",

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most common viral cause of lower respiratory tract infection in young children, followed by parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) types 1, 2 and 3, influenza virus A and B, and adenoviruses. However, the characteristics of viral transmission are poorly understood. Significant understanding is required about the role of household contacts, persistence and recurrence, re-infection, potentially predisposing risk factors, age-related risks, and the effect of prior exposure and past strain infection are not well defined. Insight into the aforementioned information will arm us with more potent way of tackling infectious viral epidemics and lower the burden of healthcare cost.",

There was also no difference between laboratory positive and negative children in regards to the number or type of symptoms they reported. The factor significantly associated with children being diagnosed with a laboratory-confirmed infection was age \u22641 year (RR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.62-0.98, p = <0.05).

Viral pathogens were detected in 42.3% (11/26) of the symptomatic family members. In all 11 cases only a single pathogen was isolated: two cases each of RSV and adenovirus, and one case each of PIV-3 and coronavirus OC43. Other viruses detected included picornaviruses (4/11 rhinoviruses, 1/11 uncharacterized non-sequenced picornavirus). In 6/11 cases, the virus detected for the adult family members was the same as what was detected in their child. Only one case was detected where the parent had a laboratory-confirmed infection and the child did not. The lower estimate of the household risk of transmission of respiratory viruses, based on concordant, proven infection in both child and adult, from a single sick child to adult household contacts is therefore 3% per week. It is known that adults have a lower rate of laboratory detection of viral infections compared to children, and this was confirmed in our study, with only 42% of symptomatic family members compared to 60% of symptomatic children, being PCR positive for a respiratory virus. Based on symptoms, the rate of transmission could be as high as 12% per week. Of the adult family members interviewed, 38% (128/336) took time off work to care for their child.

As documented in this study, the rate of laboratory-confirmed illness was not related to the number of people living in the house. This is in comparison to many other studies in developed settings, which have found that the rate of infections within the household decreases with increasing household incomes, thought to be a reflection of household crowding [27] .

In Australia, the minimum cost of a visit to a GP's office is estimated as AU$33.20 (standard consultation rebate from Medicare). For this cohort of children, the cost of these visits would amount to AU$4070. The costs calculated here do not capture the full cost attributable to the illness. The direct out-of-pocket costs to individuals can be substantial and includes costs for pharmaceuticals (both over-the counter and prescribed), travel related costs for GP visits and hospital visits, and gap payments for GP's consultation. In addition, there are the costs associated with lost economic production. Of the family members interviewed, 38% took time to care for the child. Previous studies have shown that parental work loss for the care of sick children forms a substantial proportion of the total cost of influenza in children [28, 29] . Cohen and Nettleman [28] found that the mean duration of work loss (3.2 days) due to influenza in these children would translate into US $300 in lost wages (assuming US $93 for a day's salary for a parent in the United States).",

This is similar to the results from Tsolia et al. [30] who also found an excess of antibiotic use in their cohort of outpatient children (\u22656 months to <14 years) with influenza. They found that the most common reason for justified antibiotic administration was acute otitis media. In our study, 37% of the children who were PCR positive for influenza received antibiotics. In the comparator study, influenza accounted for 37% of all antibiotic courses given to outpatients with febrile respiratory infection during the period studied. The study by Neuzil et al. [31] also analyzed excess antibiotic use attributable to influenza. They found an average of 0.072 excess courses of antibiotics per preschool-aged child. The inappropriate or excess use of antibiotics could theoretically by reduced and perhaps avoided by inclusion of rapid influenza testing for evaluation of febrile infants on assessment during the influenza season as early antiviral treatment has been shown to reduce both the use of antibiotic treatment and the length of hospital stay [32] . As only 31% of the children recruited were under one year of age, the use and role of antivirals in these children could be considered.
