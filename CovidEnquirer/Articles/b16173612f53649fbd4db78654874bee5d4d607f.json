Our data indicate that a2NTD binds to the surface of monocytes. a2NTD was preferentially endocytosed by pro-inflammatory monocytes bearing a cD142 + cD16 + phenotype, which is associated with the monocyte-to-macrophage maturation process. Both a2NTD binding and internalization led to production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 by cD142 + cD16 \u2212 (classical) and cD142 + cD16 + (intermediate) monocytes. a2NTD was internalized via a macropinocytosis mechanism utilizing scavenger receptors. however, the inhibition of a2NTD endocytosis did not reduce cytokine production by monocytes. This points to the existence of two receptors that respond to a2NTD: scavengers receptors that mediate cellular uptake and an hitherto unidentified receptor stimulating the production of inflammatory cytokines.",

            "text": "Vacuolar ATPases (V-ATPases) are multi-protein complexes found on the surface of tumor cells. 1,2 V-ATPases impact on tumorigenesis at they acidify the extracellular environment via their proton pumping activity. This enables the maturation of pH-sensitive degradative enzymes such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), which promote tumor metastasis. 3, 4 Increased cell surface expression of V-ATPases has indeed been linked to tumor cell invasion. 5 Tumor cells secrete cytokines and other proteins that dictate various facets of the immune response that they will generate, including the activation and polarization of specific macrophage and neutrophil subsets. 6, 7 Cytokines such as interferon \u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) skew macrophages toward a classically activated phenotype called M1, which participates in tumor destruction. In contrast, cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-4, IL-13 and IL-10 promote the maturation of alternatively activated M2 macrophages. 8, 9 The M2 phenotype promotes tumor survival by favoring proliferation and tumor progression, 10 as well as by stimulating angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis. 11 M2 macrophages promote extracellular matrix remodeling 12 while at the same time regulating a complex chemokine network. 13 Blood monocytes are generally viewed as a heterogeneous population of cells that constitute the precursors to tissue macrophages. Monocytes are differentiated based on the cell surface expression of two markers: the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein CD14 and the Fc\u03b3 receptor CD16. In 2010, the nomenclature was modified to include three subtypes of monocytes based on these two markers. Classical monocytes display a CD14 ++ CD16 \u2212 phenotype and represent 80-90% of all monocytes. The minor populations consist of CD14 ++ CD16 + (intermediate) and CD14 + CD16 ++ (non-classical) monocytes. 14 Monocytes expressing both CD14 and CD16 show a more mature morphological and functional phenotype than their CD16 \u2212 counterparts and are thought to constitute the specific precursors of tissue-resident macrophages. 15 Our studies use this new classification system, however many of the references use the old nomenclature and so will be referred to as originally published.",

Representative images from three independent experiments are shown: pBMcs incubated at 4\u00b0c, followed (A) or not (B) by trypsin treatment; pBMc incubated at 37\u00b0c, followed (C) or not (D) by trypsin treatment. maintained at 4\u00b0C displayed reduced surface fluorescence (Fig. 2B) . In comparison, trypsin-treated cells cultured at 37\u00b0C exhibited a reduced surface staining but maintained the punctuate intracellular staining (Fig. 2D) . To eliminate non-specific phagocytosis as a mechanism of cellular uptake, neutrophils were separately examined. Neutrophils demonstrated much less endocytosis of a2NTD than monocytes, but slightly more than lymphocytes (Fig. S1) . Finally, the monocytic leukemia cell line THP-1 was also examined. While the uptake trend is similar in THP-1 cells and monocytes, the kinetics are much slower for the former. Indeed, after 2h at 37\u00b0C, only 17% of THP-1 cells were positive as compared with almost 75% of monocytes ( Fig. 1E and Fig. S2 ). Endocytosis of a2NTD is energy-dependent and requires structural proteins. In general, filamentous actin is required for receptor-mediated endocytosis. 20 The requirement for microtubules depends on the specific receptor that is involved. For example, the inhibition of microtubules blocks complement receptor-mediated, but not Fc receptor-mediated, particle internalization. 21, 22 Moreover, the addition of microtubule-depolymerizing agents such as nocodazole slows down adsorptive and fluid-phase endocytosis. 23, 24 In order to determine if actin or microtubules are important for a2NTD internalization, PBMCs were cultured with a2NTD in presence of cytochalasin D (CytoD), to inhibit F-actin filaments, and colchicines, to inhibit microtubules.",

To determine if different monocyte subsets preferentially internalize a2NTD, monocytes were stained for the surface markers CD14 and CD16 after incubation with a2NTD. CD14 ++ CD16 \u2212 cells constitute the majority of all monocytes, while CD14 ++ CD16 + and CD14 + CD16 ++ represent two minor subpopulations. 25 We were able to retrieve these three populations by flow cytometry ( Table 1) . Of note, nearly 100% of CD14 ++ CD16 + monocytes were positive for a2NTD endocytosis, as compared are ideal for studying binding in the absence of internalization. Conversely, both binding and internalization can occur at 37\u00b0C. 19 The temperature-dependent binding of fluorescent a2NTD to PBMC was determined at 4\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C, to confirm an internalization mechanism. There were more a2NTDpositive monocytes, as assessed by flow cytometry, at 37\u00b0C (75%) than at 4\u00b0C (15%) (Fig. 1E) . Cells were then treated with trypsin to remove any a2NTD bound to the cell surface. Thus, while trypsin reduced the number of a2NTD-positive cells in both temperature conditions, an increased number of fluorescent cells persisted at 37\u00b0C. Lymphocytes, which showed minimal binding to a2NTD, also exhibited minimal peptide uptake (Fig. 1E) .",

There was no significant difference in the production of TNF\u03b1 by cells treated with a2NTD and control cells (Fig. 4D) . Of note, the CD14 ++ CD16 + subpopulation invariably produced higher amounts of IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 than the other two subpopulations. In addition, the intracellular levels of IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 were greater than those of TNF\u03b1. This finding is consistent with our previous data demonstrating that monocytes produce more IL-1 than TNF. 16 LPS contamination of the recombinant peptide is always a concern when investigating inflammatory cytokines. A multiexperimental approach was used to investigate the presence of LPS contamination, including the Limulus assay and polymyxin B neutralization tests. The results (which have previously been published) demonstrated negligible levels of LPS and that cytokine secretion could not be inhibited by pre-treatment with polymyxin B. 16 Endocytosis of a2NTD occurs via macropinocytosis. To study the mechanism by which a2NTD is internalized, we examined three common pathways of cellular entry: clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveolin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis. 26 To rhis aim, PBMCs were pre-treated with distinct compounds that inhibit each of these pathways, followed by incubation with a2NTD. Chloropromazine (CPZ) and dynasore were used to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Neither of these inhibitors had an effect on a2NTD uptake (Fig. 5A) . Filipin and nystatin were used to inhibit caveolin-mediated endocytosis. Similar to the inhibitors of clathrinmediated endocytosis, filipin and nystatin did not affect a2NTD entry (Fig. 5B) . Rottlerin and dimethylamiloride (DMA) were used to inhibit macropinocytosis. In contrast to the other inhibitors, both DMA and rottlerin significantly inhibited the uptake of a2NTD. In particular, rottlerin inhibited a2NTD uptake by 63% and DMA by 83% (Fig. 5C) . unknown. There is evidence suggesting that scavenger receptors utilize macropinocytosis as one mode of cellular entry. 29, 30 Scavenger receptors recognize macromolecules with negative charges 31 as well as lipoproteins. 32 Previous findings indicate that a2NTD is associated with lipids 33 and the amino acid sequence of a2NTD carries a net negative change. We therefore examined whether scavenger receptors play a part in the endocytosis of a2NTD.",
