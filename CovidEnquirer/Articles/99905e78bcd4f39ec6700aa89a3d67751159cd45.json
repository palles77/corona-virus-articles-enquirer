Hundreds of new 1H-1,2,3-triazole structures have been analyzed since; some crystallographic data for representative examples (structures 5-12) are collected in Table 1 . Table 1 Selected bond lengths (in\u00c5) for 1,2,3-triazole derivatives 5-12 As can be seen in Table 1 , for N-1 substituted triazoles (structures 5-7), the N(1)-N(2) bonds (1.342-1.359\u00c5) are significantly longer than the N(2)-N(3) bonds (1.293-1.309\u00c5), reflecting more single-and more double-bond character, respectively. An electron-withdrawing substituent at C-4 (compound 5 vs. 6) shortens slightly the N(2)-N(3) bond and stretches the N(1)-C bond indicating that such derivatives should dissociate more easily. In 2-substituted triazole 8, both N-N bonds are approximately equal. However, when two substituents of different electronic properties are attached, as in compound 9, the N-N bonds differ substantially, with that closer to an electron-withdrawing substituent being shortened and that closer to an electron donor being elongated. This observation can be rationalized by contribution of resonance forms involving the amino and carbonyl groups at C-4 and C-5, respectively. For the same reason, the C(4)-C(5) bond in derivative 9 is the longest one in the series suggesting diminished aromatic character for this molecule.",

In this aspect, the average bond of the triazole system in compound 9 (1.355\u00c5) is the longest in the series 5-12 supporting the low aromatic character of this molecule. For comparison, the average bond length in molecule 8 is 1.348\u00c5. Triazole anion structure 10 reveals relatively short bonds with an average bond length of 1.341\u00c5. The triazole ring in ruthenium complex 11, with average bond length of 1.353\u00c5, exhibits similar character to that of molecule 9 due in part to its resonance involving the carbonyl group at C-4. In the relatively simple and electronrich molecule 12, the average N-N bond (1.322\u00c5) and N-C bonds (1.332\u00c5) are the shortest in the whole series. Table 2 lists bond lengths for the heterocyclic ring of the benzotriazole systems in derivatives 13-21. In comparison with 1,2,3-triazoles, N-1 substituted benzotriazoles have significantly longer N(1)-N(2) bonds (average 1.364\u00c5 vs. 1.352\u00c5) and somewhat longer N(2)-N(3) bonds (average 1.307\u00c5 vs. 1301\u00c5). In general, the C-N bonds and C-C bonds in the heterocyclic ring of benzotriazole derivatives are also slightly longer than the corresponding bonds in 1,2,3-triazoles. This causes the average heterocyclic ring bond in the whole series of benzotriazole derivatives 13-21 (1.361\u00c5) to be significantly longer than that in 1,2,3-triazole derivatives 5-12 (1.346\u00c5), reflecting the diminished aromatic character and therefore the higher reactivity of the benzotriazole system. a N(1)-C. b N(2)-N. c N(2)-C'.",

To clarify the picture, data for typical 4,5-dihydro-1H-1,2,3-triazoles (51-61) <2002J(P2)126> are collected in Table 7 . For the ring nitrogen atoms, the highest field resonance is always assigned to N-1. To distinguish positions of N-2 and N-3 resonances, which sometimes come close to each other, isotopic labeling at N-1 and N-2 is used. The data presented indicate that change of a N-1 substituent from aliphatic to aromatic causes moderate downfield shifts of the N-1 and N-3 resonances and a strong upfield shift of the N-2 resonance. This feature can be explained by the resonance effect of the aromatic ring. Electron-withdrawing substituents at C-4 shift strongly upfield the N-3 signals but do not significantly change the N-1 and N-2 resonances. Substituents at C-5 shift significantly upfield the N-1 resonances. An sp 2 C-5 atom shifts the N-3 resonance dramatically downfield, especially when a heteroatom is attached (structures 58-60).",

NMR studies of the equilibrium between products 63, 64, and 65, carried out in DMSO-d 6 are summarized in Table 8 . It is evident from the collected data that the equilibrium depends strongly on the substituent R. Electron-withdrawing substituents on the phenyl ring destabilize structure 63 but stabilize form 65. Ortho-substituents on the aromatic ring, both electron-donating and electron-withdrawing, strongly destabilize triazoles 63, but they stabilize open-chain form 64. The benzyl derivative exists almost exclusively in the triazole form 63 <2003CHE168>. Concentration of an ethanolic solution of dimethylglyoxime, cobalt(II) chloride and benzotriazole results in deposition of crystalline complex 68. The product is stable at room temperature; however, it slowly decomposes upon heating. Thermal analysis reveals that the compound releases first the chlorine atom and 50% of the benzotriazole content to form a new complex that is stable to 225 C. Probably in this new form, the benzotriazole moiety coordinates two cobalt ions simultaneously. Further heating to 350 C removes the benzotriazolyl moieties completely <2003JPY699>.

Some progress in this field provides finding of direct alkylation of benzotriazole with alcohols in the presence of triphenylphosphine and NBS <1997SC1613>. Presumably, the first step is formation of a reactive intermediate 81 that is attacked later by benzotriazole in the S N 2 fashion to give derivative 82 (Scheme 4). The reaction is regioselective and provides exclusively 1-alkyl-, 1-(arylmethyl)-, 1-(2-alken-1-yl)-, and 1-(2-alkyn-1-yl)benzotriazoles, respectively. Secondary alcohols give the corresponding alkyl derivatives in low yields, while tertiary alcohols do not alkylate benzotriazole under these conditions. In aqueous micellar medium using cetyltrimethylammonium bromide as a surfactant, benzotriazole is alkylated regioselectively at N-1 with n-propyl and n-butyl bromides, but activated alkylating agents (benzyl chloride, allyl bromide, phenacyl chloride, etc.) produce mixtures of benzotrizol-1-yl and -2-yl isomers in ratios varying from 55:45 to 80:20, respectively <2001BCJ2133>. Alkylation of benzotriazole with bis(2-chloroethyl) ether under these conditions provides a mixture of derivatives 83-85 with isolated yields of 13%, 32% and 22%, respectively (Equation 2). Use of ionic liquids as media for alkylation of benzotriazole provides generally higher regioselectivity; however, the trend is opposite to that under micellar conditions with phenacyl bromide and similar compounds providing exclusively benzotriazol-1-yl derivatives and n-alkyl halides giving mixtures of benzotriazol-1-yl and -2-yl derivatives in a ratio of 15:1 <2004H(63)1077>.

The reactions are believed to involve 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of tetrahydropyran to azides 287 with formation of relatively unstable triazolines 286. Opening of the triazoline ring results in zwitterionic structure 285 that is losing molecular nitrogen and rearranges to final product 289 by 1,2-hydrogen shift <2003JFC(120)65>. In a similar manner, reactions of azides 287 with dihydropyridines lead to N-alkanesulfonylimines 290, via labile triazolines 288 (Scheme 43) <2000JFC(106)133>.",

The method tolerates groups that may not be compatible with organomagnesium reagents. Contrary to the copper(I) catalysis, this method works also well with disubstituted acetylenes to provide 1,4,5-trisubstituted 1,2,3-triazoles. The suggested mechanism <2005JA15998> is presented in Scheme 188. Simultaneous replacement of two ligands in ruthenium catalyst 1143 (e.g., triphenylphosphine) by the azide and alkyne molecules generates active transition state 1144 promoting bond formation between the terminal atoms of the new ligands to give a six-membered ruthenocycle 1145. Finally, formation of the second bond between the reacting partners releases a molecule of triazole 1146 and recycles the catalyst. Treatment of 4-acetamido-3-arylazo-1,2,5-oxadiazole 2-oxides (furoxans) 1164 with aqueous NaOH results in formation of 4-acetamido-2-aryl-5-nitro-2H-1,2,3-triazoles 1169. According to the proposed mechanism, the anion derived from the acetamido group attacks N-5 of the furoxan system (form 1165) causing ring opening and formation of another oxadiazole ring (form 1166). Rotation of the large substituent at C-3 in oxadiazole 1166 brings the arylazo group to proximity of the ring (form 1167). In the following step, which is reverse to that shown as form 1165, an intramolecular attack of the arylazo group on oxadiazole 1167 causes ring opening with release of the acetamido group and formation of a new ring (form 1168). Acidification with hydrochloric acid stabilizes the system as triazole derivative 1169.

To promote a cascade rearrangement similar to that depicted in Scheme 193, furoxans 1171 have to be heated with potassium tert-butoxide in DMF.

Reactions of salts of 1,2,3-triazole with electrophiles provide an easy access to 1,2,3-triazol-N-yl derivatives; although, usually mixtures of N-1 and N-2 substituted triazoles are obtained that have to be separated (see Section 5.01.5). Another simple method for synthesis of such derivatives is addition of 1,2,3-triazole to carbon-carbon multiple bonds (Section 5.01.5). N-1 Substituted 1,2,3-triazoles can be selectively prepared by 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition of acetylene or (trimethylsilyl)acetylene to alkyl or aryl azides (Section 5.01.9). 5.01.11.1.2 C-Substituted 1,2,3-triazoles",

Among antitumor agents, vorozole (structure 1302) is a high-affinity competitive aromatase inhibitor, designed for inhibiting estrogen synthesis in patients with breast cancer <2001CNR8452, 2002JON1026, 2003STE1139>. Benzotriazole derivative 1303 exhibits remarkable activity against leukemia, ovarian, renal, and lung cancers <2003BMC1701>. The structures may be complex, like compound 1304 <2003BML1665>, or simple, like compound 1305 <2003FA33>, both of them exhibiting anti-inflammatory activities, although based on different principles. Nucleoside analog 1306 inhibits strongly helicase activity of hepatitis C virus <2003EJB1645>, whereas compound 1307 and several of its analogs show strong activity against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) <2003BML2141>.",
