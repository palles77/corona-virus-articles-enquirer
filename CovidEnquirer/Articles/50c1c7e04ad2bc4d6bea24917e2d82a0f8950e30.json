We aimed to investigate the gene expression differences of the complement system in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients with symptomatic PE and controls. Methods: Twenty cases of PE patients and twenty sex and age matched controls were recruited into the study. Human cDNA microarray analysis was used to detect the gene expression difference of the complement system between the two groups. Results: 1). Expression of twenty-one genes encoding complement components was detected. In PE patients, expression of the genes encoding C1q\u03b1, C1q\u03b2, C4b, C5 and Factor P was significantly greater (P b 0.05) than controls, while C6, C7, C9, mannose-binding lectin (MBL) and mannan-binding lectin serine peptidase 1 (MASP1) mRNAs were lower (P b 0.05) than controls. 2). Expression of seven genes encoding complement receptors was examined. In PE patients, CR1, integrin \u03b1M, integrin \u03b1X and C5aR mRNAs were significantly up-regulated (P b 0.01) compared with controls. 3). Seven genes encoding complement regulators were examined. The mRNA expression of CD59 and CD55 was significantly up-regulated (P b 0.05), whereas Factor I mRNA was significantly down-regulated (P b 0.05) in PE patients than controls. Conclusions: In PE patients, the mRNA expressions of complement components, receptors and regulators were unbalanced, suggesting dysfunction and/or deficiency of the complement system, which leads to decreased function of MAC-induced cell lysis in PE patients finally.",

The up-regulation of C1q\u03b1, C1q\u03b2 and C4b mRNAs in PE patients suggests that there exists pathogen invasion, leading to the activation of the classical pathway. When mannose-bind lectin (MBL) or Ficolin bind to carbohydrate on the surface of pathogens, the MBL-associated serine proteases (MASPs) are activated, then the lectin pathway is activated [12] . Previous studies have shown that people with MBL deficiency are susceptible to a variety of infections, especially when their adaptive immunity is immature [13] [14] [15] . Therefore, the down-regulation of MBL and MASP1 mRNAs in PE patients indicates deficiency or decline of the lectin pathway function in PE patients.",

Our results showed that the mRNA expression of CD59 and CD55 which is also known as decay acceleration factor (DAF) was significantly increased, however, mRNA expression of Factor I was significantly decreased. CD55, C4BP and Factor H can regulate the complement activation through inhibiting the activity of C3 convertase [10] . CD59 can bind to C8 (\u03b1 chain) and C9 during MAC complex formation and protects host cells from MAC-mediated lysis [17] . Thus, the up-regulation of CD59 and CD55 mRNAs suggests inhibition of MAC-mediated lysis in PE patients. However, in our present study, it is unclear whether the cause of the up-regulation of CD55 and CD59 mRNAs is inherited or acquired. It has been reported that Factor I deficiency was associated with recurrent bacterial infections [18] . In our present study, Factor I mRNA expression was down-regulated in PE patients compared with controls, suggesting that PE patients are susceptible to bacterial infections.",

To defend against pathogens, the innate immune system mainly comprises the complement proteins, phagocytes, and NK cells, whereas the adaptive immune system consists of T cells and B cells which produce antibodies when stimulated. Previously, we have reported that mRNA expression of genes associated with NK and T cells was down-regulated in PE patients [7] . We also reported that transmission electron microscopy showed rod-like bacteria in a patient with recurrent PE/DVT, indicating phagocyte deficiency in PE patients [19] . In addition, our previous studies showed decreased number of CD 3 + T cells and CD 8 + T cells, and an imbalance in the CD 4 + /CD 8 + ratio in patients with acute PE and CTEPH respectively [8, 9] . In our present study, several complement early components of the classical pathway and the alternative pathway and complement receptors mRNAs were significantly up-regulated, suggesting complement activation in PE patients. However, mRNA expression of several components of MBL pathway and the formation of MAC were significantly down-regulated, suggesting defective or reduced complement function in PE patients.",
