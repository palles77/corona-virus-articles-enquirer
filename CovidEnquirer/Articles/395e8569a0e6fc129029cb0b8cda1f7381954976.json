In reality, many hosts form multi-species aggregations and may be infected with an 22 assemblage of pathogens. We used a meta-transcriptomic approach to characterize the viromes of 23 nine avian species in the Anseriformes (ducks) and Charadriiformes (shorebirds). This revealed the 24 presence of 27 viral species, of which 24 were novel, including double-stranded RNA viruses 25 (Picobirnaviridae and Reoviridae), single-stranded RNA viruses (Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, 26 Picornaviridae), a retro-transcribing DNA virus (Hepadnaviridae), and a single-stranded DNA virus 27 (Parvoviridae). These viruses comprise multi-host generalist viruses and those that are host-specific, 28 indicative of both virome connectivity and heterogeneity. Virome connectivity was apparent in two 29 well described multi-host virus species (avian coronavirus and influenza A virus) and a novel 30 Rotavirus species that were shared among some Anseriform species, while heterogeneity was 31 reflected in the absence of viruses shared between Anseriformes and Charadriiformes. Notably, 32 within avian host families there was no significant relationship between either host taxonomy or 33 foraging ecology and virome composition, although Anseriform species positive for influenza A 34 virus harboured more additional viruses than those negative for influenza virus. Overall, we 35 demonstrate complex virome structures across host species that co-exist in multi-species 36 aggregations.",

Host community diversity is central to 44 pathogen dynamics (1, 2), and pathogen species richness, relative abundance, specificity and intra- 45 and inter-species interactions within assemblages likely have complex roles in modulating pathogen 46 levels within populations (1, (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . A significant limitation in studying viral communities in hosts is 47 that most viral species remained undescribed (9), such that viral ecology across multi-host systems 48 has been limited to \"single-virus\" dynamics, particularly in vertebrate systems (for example, 49 Influenza A virus [IAV] in avian populations). With the advent of unbiased, bulk 'meta-50 transcriptomic' RNA sequencing we can now explore, in more detail, how viral community structure 51 may be shaped by host-species interactions. 52 Birds of the orders Anseriformes and Charadriiformes, the central reservoirs for avian viruses such 53 as IAV, avian avulavirus and avian coronavirus (10, 11), form multi-host flocks, in which many 54 species may migrate, forage, or roost together (e.g. (12) . These flocks may comprise species along a 55 taxonomically related gradient and may utilize similar or different ecological niches in the same 56 environment. For example, in Australia, taxonomically related dabbling Grey Teals (Anas gracilis) 57 and Pacific Black Ducks (Anas superciliosa) may share the environment with the distantly related 58 filter feeding Pink-eared Duck (Malacorhynchus membranaceus). These multi-host flocks form 59 multi-host maintenance communities (6), with consequences for virus ecology, transmission, and 60 virulence (1, 13, 14) . 61 Studies of the ecology of IAV, the best studied multi-host virus in wild birds, have shown that not all 62 hosts are equal (15, 16 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

            "text": "Contigs were annotated, and phylogenetic treesinferred as per (25). Briefly, contigs greater than 118 1000bp in length were inspected using Geneious R10 (Biomatters, New Zealand), and open reading 119 frame corresponding to predicted genome architectures based on the closest reference genomes were 120 interrogated. Reads were subsequently mapped back to viral contigs to identify mis-assembly using 121 bowtie2 (28). Viruses with full length genomes, or incomplete genomes but that possess the full-122 length RNA-dependant RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene, were used for phylogenetic analysis. Briefly, 123 sequences of the polyprotein or gene encoding for the RdRp were aligned using MAFFT (29), and 124 gaps and ambiguously aligned regions were stripped using trimAL (30). Final alignment lengths for 125 each data set are presented in Table S2 . The most appropriate amino acid substitution model was 126 then determined for each data set, and maximum likelihood trees were estimated using PhyML 3.0 127 (31) with 1000 bootstrap replicates. Novel viral species were identified as those that had <90% RdRp 128 protein identity, or <80% genome identity to previously described viruses. All reads have been 129 deposited in the Short Read Archive (PRJNA505206) and viral sequences described have been 130 deposited in GenBank (MK204384-MK20441, MK213322-MK213337). 131 Relative virus abundance was estimated as the proportion of the total viral reads in each library 133 (excluding rRNA). All ecological measures were calculated using the data set comprising viruses 134 associated with \"higher\" vertebrates (i.e. birds and mammals), albeit with all retroviruses and 135 retrotransposons removed (hereafter, \"avian virus data set\"). 136 Analyses were performed using R v 3.4.0 integrated into RStudio v 1.0.143, and plotted using 137 ggplot2. Both the observed virome richness and Shannon effective (i.e. alpha diversity) were 138 calculated for each library at the virus family and genus levels using the Rhea script sets (32), and 139 compared between avian orders using the Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test. Beta diversity was 140 calculated using the Bray Curtis dissimilarity matrix and virome structure was plotted as a function 141 of nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) ordination and tested using Adonis tests using the 142 vegan (33) and phyloseq packages (34). To determine whether differences in virome composition can 143 be explained by host phylogeny (35), dendograms of beta diversity were constructed using the bray 144 curtis dissimilarity matrix using the vegan package incorporated into the hclust() function. 145 Dendograms representing library abundance and composition at the viral family, genera and species 146 level of taxonomy were also compared to the host phylogeny. For the species level comparison, we 147 used only those presented in Table S3 . Two phylogenetic tree congruence metrics were then 148 calculated to compare the match between the virome metric and host phylogeny: the matching cluster 149 Robinson-Foulds tree metric (36) was calculated using the phangorn package (37), and the 150 normalized PH85 metric (38) (39) was determined using the ape package (40). For both metrics, a 151 distance of 0 indicates complete congruence and 1, incomplete congruence. The phylogenetic 152 relationships among the avian host species were inferred using a maximum likelihood tree of the 153 cytochrome B mitochondrial sequences and accords with those determined previously (41-44). The 154 overall co-phylogenetic analysis was visualized using the phytools package (45). 155 Finally, the relative abundance of virus families between each avian host order (Charadriiformes 156 versus Anseriformes) was assessed using the wilcox test. Subsequently, log2 relative abundance was 7 We characterized the total transcriptome of nine avian species from the Anseriformes and 163 Charadriiformes (Table S1 ). Within each avian order, bird species were sampled across the same 164 spatial and temporal scales, although members of the Anseriformes and Charadriiformes were 165 sampled at different time points (i.e. years) and locations. This resulted in two bird communities 166 comprising five and four species, respectively (Table S1) (Table S1 ). There was no significant correlation 169 between RNA concentration and the number of reads, contigs or abundance demonstrating such that 170 this was not a source of bias ( Fig S1) . There was a large range in total viral abundance (0.14-10.67% 171 viral reads) and putative avian viral abundance (0.00083-0.327% viral reads) in each library (Table   172 S1, Fig 1) . In additional to avian viral reads, libraries had numerous reads matching arthropod 173 viruses and retroviruses (Fig 1) . Although these retroviruses are likely bird associated, the challenge 174 of differentiating between endogenous and exogenous retroviruses meant that they were excluded 175 from the analysis, as were those viruses most likely associated with arthropods, plants and bacteria. 176 A total of 24 of the 27 viruses identified in this study likely represent novel avian viral species (Table   177 S3, Fig 2, Fig S2) . Novel species were identified in the double-stranded RNA viruses (Fig S4) . Analysis of this short RdRp region also suggested that Red-necked Stint 186 avastrovirus is sister to a virus detected in Swedish Mallards, indicating that this new group may be 187 globally distributed (Fig S4) . A Group 1 Avastrovirus, Pink-eared Duck astrovirus was also 188 identified, and was a sister to Turkey astrovirus 2 (Fig S3, S4) . 189 Our study further expanded an unassigned avian specific genus of the Caliciviridae with the 190 identification of three new species, two from Pink-eared Ducks and one from Grey Teal. These 191 viruses form a clade comprising Goose calicivirus, Turkey calicivirus and a calicivirus previously 192 identified in Red-necked Avocets from Australia (Recurvirostra novaehollandiae) (Fig 3) .",

Three different Megriviruses were also 201 identified, two from Anseriformes and one from Charadriiformes. Finally, a number of 202 picornaviruses from unassigned genera similar to Pigeon picornavirus B were identified in 203 Charadriiformes (Fig 4, Fig S5) . These form a clade with a number of picornaviruses previously 204 detected in Red-necked Avocets from Australia. Two host libraries had more than one picornavirus 205 species (Red-necked Stint and Pink-eared Duck) (Fig 2) . 206 In addition to a previously described coronavirus, we identified a potentially novel species of 207 deltacoronavirus. Specifically, sharp-tailed Sandpiper deltacoronavirus was most closely related to 208 deltaviruses in wild birds from the United Arab Emirates and gulls from Europe (Fig S11) (Fig 5) . However, due to limited sampling in wild birds, this virus could be related to 218 other, currently unsampled, avian picorbirnaviruses. Two novel rotavirus species were also revealed 219 from these host species. Indeed, Grey Teals and Pink-eared ducks shared a rotavirus species, 220 distantly related to rotavirus G. This virus is one of three shared viruses in our entire dataset. Grey 221 Teals also carried a second rotavirus species, distantly related to rotavirus F (Fig S7) .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/528174 doi: bioRxiv preprint Chapparvovirus of the Parvoviridae (Fig 6) Hepatitis Virus (Fig S8) . 229 Previously described avian RNA viruses 230 Given their frequency in avian populations as described in numerous surveillance schemes, we 231 anticipated finding IAV, Avian avulavirus type 1 (formerly avian paramyxovirus type 1), and 232 members of the Coronaviridae in some of the species sampled. Not only did we detect these viruses, 233 but IAV and avian gammacoronavirus were shared across three different waterfowl libraries (Fig S9- 234 S10). Phylogenetic analysis of a partial RdRp revealed that the avian gammacoronavirus identified 235 here were most closely related to those already found in Australian wild birds (Fig S10) . 236 We identified two subtypes of influenza A virus -H9N1 and H3N1 (Fig S12, S13 ) -in Grey Teal 237 and Pink-eared Duck, respectively. Both H9N1 and H3N1 are rarely detected subtype combinations 238 in large waterfowl surveillance schemes (47, 48). Segments of these two viruses generally fell into 239 the geographically isolated \"Eurasian\" clade, with the exception of the NP segment that fell within 240 the \"North American\" clade, thereby demonstrating intercontinental reassortment in Australian 241 waterfowl viruses (Fig S12, S13) . Finally, although avian avulavirus Type 1 Class II Genotype 1b 242 are frequently isolated from wild birds globally, we detected a Class II Genotype 1a virus 243 infrequently isolated in wild birds (Fig S14) . This genotype has been previously isolated from (Table S1) . 254 As with abundance, there was marked heterogeneity in alpha diversity (i.e. the diversity of viruses in 255 each library) within the Anseriformes and Charadriiformes. In contrast to abundance, alpha diversity 256 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license is made available under a The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. It . https://doi.org/10.1101/528174 doi: bioRxiv preprint was higher in Anseriform than Charadriiform libraries at the viral family, genus, and species levels, 257 although this difference was not statistically significant (Fig S15-S17) . The lack of significance is 258 potentially due to the surprisingly high alpha diversity in Red-necked Stint compared to other 259 Charadriiformes, and the low alpha diversity in Pacific Black Ducks and Australian Wood Ducks in 260 the Anseriformes (Fig 7A, Fig S15-S18) . Hence, despite sampling multispecies flocks, there can be a 261 large variation in virome structure across species and potentially individuals. 262 There was also substantial variation in the viral genera and species composition within each library 263 ( Fig 7A, Fig S15-S18) . Members of the Picornaviridae, Caliciviridae and Reoviridae (genus 264 Rotavirus) were ubiquitous and full genomes or short contigs were found in almost every library, 265 often at high abundance ( Fig 7A, Fig S14, S16 ). In addition to picornaviruses and rotaviruses, the 266 Red-necked Stint had a highly abundant astrovirus (0.012%) and avulavirus (0.035%), while Sharp-267 tailed Sandpipers had a highly abundant deltacoronavirus (0.073%) that were not detected in other 268 Charadriiform libraries (Fig 7A, S17) . More viral families, genera and species were shared amongst 269 the Anseriformes, particularly between Grey Teal, Pink-eared Duck and Australian Shelduck. 270 Specifically, Grey Teal and Australian Shelduck shed avian gammacoronavirus at high abundance 271 (0.021% and 0.029%, respectively) and Grey Teal and Pink-eared Duck shed IAV, although at lower 272 abundances (0.0041% and 0.000728%, respectively) ( Fig 7A, Fig S17) . Overall, there were no 273 significant trends towards differential abundance of viral families between the Charadriiformes and 274 Anseriformes (Fig S19-S21) . Viruses from the Astroviridae, Calciviridae, Coronaviridae, 275 Picobirnaviridae, Picornaviridae, Reoviridae and Rhabdoviridae were found in both Anseriformes 276 and Charadriiformes, albeit with different abundance patterns (Fig S19-S21 ). Multiple genera of 277 picornaviruses were detected, but similarly without significant differences: most families and genera 278 were detected in both avian orders (Fig S19-S21 ). 279 Using a non-metric ordination method (NMDS) we found no clustering of viral family or viral genus 280 by host order with respect to virus abundance and diversity between libraries (i.e. beta-diversity) (Fig   281   S22 ). Similarly, there was no statistically significant clustering of viral families (R 2 = 0.13, df = 8, p 282 = 0.267) or genera (R 2 = 0.157, df = 8, p = 0.173) in the Charadriiformes compared to Anseriformes, 283 suggesting that despite taxonomic differences waterbirds share numerous viral genera and families. 284 We utilized a co-phylogenetic approach to better determine whether this lack of clustering was 285 associated with host phylogeny. Accordingly, a phylogram of beta-diversity was not congruent with 286 host phylogeny at the viral family, genus or species levels (Fig 7B, Fig S23-S24) Calidris sandpipers Sharp-tailed Sandpipers, Red-necked Stint and Curlew Sandpipers) do not 290 possess viromes that are more similar to each other than to those of more distantly related species 291 within the same avian order. Rather, the phylogram of beta diversity has clusters with a mix of 292 Anseriform and Charadriiform libraries, indicating connectivity of viral families and genera across 293 species of both avian orders (Fig 7B, Fig S23-S24) . Similarly, there was also no statistically 294 significant clustering by feeding mechanism in the Anseriformes (R 2 =0.56, df=4, p=0.2) or 295 migratory propensity in the Charadriiformes (R 2 =0.43, df=3, p=0.25) (Fig S22) suggesting that host 296 ecology may also play a limited role in shaping virome composition at the levels of viral family and 297 genus. 298 Assessing comparative virome structure at the viral family and genera level is critical in 299 demonstrating core viral families and genera in waterbirds. Species level analysis, albeit limited to 300 viruses in which we were able to assemble >1000bp, is a more accurate measure of connectivity and 301 heterogeneity of avian viromes. First, while there was no marked division in virome composition at 302 the level of viral family or genera between the Anseriformes and the Charadriiformes, there was such 303 a distinction at the level of viral species. Specifically, no viral species were shared between the 304 Anseriformes and Charadriiformes (Fig 3) , although the Anseriformes and Charadriiformes were 305 sampled at different time points and at different locations. Within the Anseriformes, three viruses 306 (influenza A virus, avian gammacoronavirus, and duck rotavirus G-like) were shared between three 307 libraries: Grey Teal, Pink-eared Duck and Australian Shelduck (Fig 3, Fig S23) . These shared 308 viruses were especially common in the viromes of the Grey Teal (80% of avian viral reads), 309 Australian Shelduck (82% of avian viral reads), and a small proportion of Pink-eared Duck avian 310 viral reads (17%). The two Anas ducks (Grey Teal and Pacific Black Duck), the most closely related 311 Anseriformes, did not share any viral species; surprisingly, the virome of the Pacific-Black Duck was 312 different from the three connected host species. Further, Grey Teal and Pink-eared Ducks, the most 313 taxonomically distinct waterfowl, shared two viral species, demonstrating the limited impact of host 314 phylogeny ( Fig S23) . These viruses were also shared across ecological niches (dabbling ducks and 315 filter feeding ducks), suggesting that co-occurrence was potentially responsible for their spread. 316 Within the Anseriformes we tested for the effect of virus-virus interactions on alpha diversity, 317 specifically whether the presence of IAV had an effect on virome abundance or composition. Despite 318 a low abundance of IAV in the libraries, there was a trend towards a higher alpha diversity of 319 viromes in Anseriform species positive for IAV (Grey Teal, Pink-eared Duck; Fig S25) at the viral 320 family, genus and species levels, although this was not statistically significant due to small sample 321 size. Furthermore, IAV positive libraries were adjacent to each on the NMDS plots, although this 322 .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/528174 doi: bioRxiv preprint clustering was not statistically significant (Viral Family R 2 =0.14, df=8, p=0.307, Viral Genera, 323 R 2 =0.14, df=8, p=0.224). This trend did not hold for avian gammacoronavirus in the Grey Teal and 324 Australian Shelduck libraries (Fig S26) . 325 Finally, the phylogenetic analysis did not reveal a clear host-taxonomic gradient in viral species 326 relationships. However, within the megriviruses (Picornaviridae), there appear to be large clades that 327 may reflect avian order, with the viruses identified in the Anseriformes and Charadriiformes falling 328 into two different clades. Furthermore, viruses from wild Anseriformes fall as sister taxa to 329 previously described duck and goose megriviruses (Fig S6) . In addition, this and our previous study 330 (25) identified a number of picornaviruses from an unassigned genus only found in Charadriiformes, 331 such that it might similarly represent a virus genus that is specific to a particular host order. 332 333",

Anseriformes and Charadriiformes are important reservoirs for the best described avian 336 virus, IAV, but are also central to the epidemiology of other multi-host viruses such as avian 337 coronavirus and avian avulavirus type 1 (10, 11, 24, (49) (50) (51) (52) (53) . As such, these avian hosts are excellent 338 model species for understanding the determinants of virome composition. Indeed, we detected all 339 these previously described low pathogenic avian viruses in our sample set, and coronaviruses and 340 influenza A viruses were shared across different Anseriform species. We also genomically described 341 24 novel viral species belonging to 10 viral families, including both RNA and DNA viruses. The 342 largest number and diversity of viruses belonged to the Picornaviridae, although a number of 343 rotaviruses and caliciviruses were also described. 344 Overall, the avian viruses identified in this study were most closely related to other avian viruses, or 345 in genera containing avian viruses. The exception is Grey Teal picorbirnavirus Y that occupies a 346 clade dominated by viruses from human and porcine hosts. Whether this represents a host switch, or 347 is due to lack of sampling in other hosts, will likely be revealed in additional metatranscriptomic The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

As these Anseriformes were sampled in the same 377 temporal and spatial frames, it is not unexpected that there was connectivity despite differences in 378 ecology and taxonomy. However, at the level of viral species there was no connectivity between the 379 Anseriform and Charadriiform libraries, although this may be due to the physiological differences 380 noted above or, more simply, that the ducks and wader viruses were sampled at different times and 381 places. Despite the lack of connectivity between the Anseriformes and Charadriiformes at a viral 382 species level, avian avulavirus 1 and deltacoronavirus detected in Red-necked Stint and Sharp-tailed 383 Sandpiper, respectively, have been previously described in Anseriformes (10, 51). This connectivity 384 between viromes is likely facilitated by the association of these birds to water. Specifically, viruses 385 such as IAV are thought to be primarily transmitted by the faecal-oral route, in which viruses 386 .

For example, within 359 the Charadriiformes, the closely related Calidris sandpipers (Scolopacidae) did not have similar 360 viromes and did not cluster as a group independently from Red-capped Plover, a member of a 361 different avian family (Charadridae). Alternatively, it is possible that aspects of host ecology, such as 362 foraging ecology, may be more important in shaping virome composition than host taxonomy (a 363 proxy for physiology). Specifically, differences in ecology may generate differences in virus 364 exposure across closely related hosts (11, 57, 58). The five Anseriform species studied here utilize 365 three different feeding ecologies -dabbling, grazing and filter feeding -while the four Charadriiform 366 species have different bill lengths and forage in different layers of sediment (12). Notably, however, 367 there was no clear difference in virome composition as a result of ecology. 368 Central to our study was considering virome structure in the context of a multi-host and multi-virus 369 model of virus-host interactions. Accordingly, the data generated here revealed large-scale 370 heterogeneity (abundance and alpha diversity) in virome composition at the levels of virus family, 371 genus and even species.

In particular, there are marked differences in susceptibility, pathology and 63 the subsequent immune response in taxonomically related species, or distantly related species within 64 similar ecological niches. For example, dramatic differences in viral prevalence exist within the Charadriiformes, such that Ruddy Turnstones (Arenaria interpres) may have an IAV prevalence of ~15%, compared to the negligible IAV prevalence in co-sampled Sanderlings (Calidris alba) sampled at Delaware Bay, USA (17). There are also major differences in the pathology of highly68 pathogenic IAV in Anseriformes both in the field and in experimental infections. Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) infected with the highly pathogenic IAV are thought to move the virus large distances 70 and remain free of clinical signs, while Tufted Ducks (Aythya fuligula), in contrast, experience 71 severe mortality (18-20). Following IAV infection, dabbling ducks of the genus Anas are believed to 72 develop poor immune memory (21), allowing IAV re-infections throughout their lives, in contrast to swans that have long term immune memory (22) and where re-infection probability is likely very 74 low in adults. These differences are driven by factors encompassing both virus (e.g. virulence, 75 transmission) and host (e.g. receptor availability, immune responses) biology (11). The goal of this study was to use the analysis of comparative virome structures, particularly virome 77 composition, diversity and abundance, as a means to describe the nature of host-virus interactions 78 beyond the \"one-host, one-virus\" model. Given their role as hosts for multi-host viruses such as IAV, 79 coronaviruses and avian avulaviruses, we used apparently healthy members of the Anseriformes and Charadriiformes as model avian taxa in these comparisons. In particular, we aimed to (i) reveal the 81 viromes and describe novel viruses in the bird taxa sampled, (ii) determine whether viromes of 82 different host orders have different abundance and viral diversity such that they cluster separately, 83 (iii) determine whether closely taxonomically related and co-occuring avian hosts have viromes that 84 are more homogenous, and (iv) identify the impact of host taxonomy, which we use as a proxy for 85 differences in relevant host traits (such as host physiology, cell receptors), in determining virome 86 structure. Overall, we reveal a combination of virome heterogeneity and connectivity across avian 87 species that are important reservoirs of avian viruses.
