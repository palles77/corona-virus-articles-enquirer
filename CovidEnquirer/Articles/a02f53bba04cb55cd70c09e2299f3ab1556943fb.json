Inputs included (1) sinusoidal oscillations of vagal tone with a 4-second period (respiration), slowly varying component of sleep-wake cycle, and randomly varying noise; (2) oscillator of sinus node with variation dependent on vagal tone and a random component based on previous exit block; (3) probability of exit block with threshold dependent on vagal tone.

Children with tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) show clockwise aortic root rotation and have an increased prevalence of coronary artery anomalies. Coronary artery anomalies are also common in brachycephalic dogs with pulmonary valve stenosis (PS).

Platelet function testing may be useful to identify if clopidogrel resistance occurs in cats. Plateletworks \u00d2 (PW) consistently detects clopidogrel effect in normal cats using ADP as agonist. In canine PW studies, arachidonic acid (AA) is as useful an agonist as ADP to detect clopidogrel effect, but there are no data for cats. Platelet Function Analyzer \u00d2 (PFA) inconsistently detects clopidogrel effect in normal cats using the collagen-ADP cartridge. This also occurs in humans, prompting development of the INNOVANCE \u00d2 P2Y cartridge, which consistently detects clopidogrel effect in humans and dogs. The objective of this study was to investigate PW-AA and PFA-P2Y in cats. Nine normal cats and 13 cats with cardiovascular diseases were studied. All had normal hematocrits and platelet counts. Blood samples were collected by jugular venipuncture. The 9 normal cats showed PW-AA %Aggregation (%Agg) = 83-97% and PFA-P2Y Closure Time (CT) = 38-111 seconds. For cats with cardiovascular diseases (one or both tests performed): a) 7 cats already receiving clopidogrel: PW-AA %Agg = 4-19% (n = 3) and PFA-P2Y CT >300 seconds (n = 6). b) 6 cats prior to starting clopidogrel: PW-AA %Agg = 21-96% (n = 5) and PFA-P2Y CT = 50-118 seconds (n = 3). For 3 of these 6 cats one or both tests were repeated while receiving clopidogrel: PW-AA % Agg = 0-12% (n = 3) and PFA-P2Y CT >300 seconds (n = 1). For both tests, differences between normal cats and cats being treated with clopidogrel were significant (P < 0.05). PW with AA agonist and PFA with P2Y cartridge may be highly sensitive to detect clopidogrel effect in cats. Fujii 1 , H. Sunahara 1 , K. Sugimoto 1 , T. Uehara 1 , Y.

The dogs were evaluated using echocardiography and a catheter for the measurement of their direct blood pressure during PDA occlusion. The diameter of descending aorta was measured using digital fluoroscopic cine loops. After PDA occlusion, the systolic blood pressure did not change; however, pulse pressure significantly decreased (P < 0.01) and diastolic blood pressure (DAP) significantly increased (P < 0.01). In a univariate analysis (n = 49), the low postoperative FS% was associated with an older age (P < 0.05), the increased postoperative diastolic blood pressure, and decreased pulse pressure (both with P < 0.01). In a multivariate analysis (n = 49), low postoperative FS% was associated with an older age (P < 0.05) and a decreased postoperative pulse pressure (P < 0.05). The diameter of the descending aorta significantly increased both in systole and diastole (both with P < 0.01) and the aortic FS% was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) just after PDA occlusion. In conclusion, left ventricle might not be able to contract after PDA occlusion because of increased DAP and decreased aortic compliance, i.e., the aortic valve more strongly closed and the aorta was rapidly dilated like a rupturing balloon due to trapping a large amount of blood into aorta. Of 146 canine HA cases identified during this time period, 12 (8%) also experienced CHF. Eight of these dogs had chronic mitral valve disease; the other 4 had dilated cardiomyopathy. Five of the 12 dogs experienced CHF after the first injection of DOCP; 3 of these had known pre-existing heart disease. The median time between the DOCP and CHF was 11 days (range 1-29 days).",

Despite the negative findings in this small, retrospective study, further study of the relationship between DOCP administration and CHF seems warranted. The oculocardiac reflex is the heart's physiological response to digital compression of the eyeballs, producing negative chronotropic and inotropic responses in healthy subjects. In this study, we investigated the autonomic imbalance in dogs with CHF due to myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD) by means of their individual response to that vagal maneuver. Fifty-two client-owned MMVD dogs (stages B1/B2/C/D) and twelve healthy dogs admitted for regular cardiac evaluation were recruited for a prospective observational study. Every dog had an ECG recorded for 5 minutes, and during the last minute both globes were compressed into the orbits using digital pressure until the 5 minute-recording was over. Twenty RR intervals were used to calculate the mean RR interval, the standard deviation of RR intervals, the root mean square of the successive differences in RR intervals and the vasovagal tonus index before eyeball compression and at approximately twenty seconds after compression started. The percent change of every surrogate was calculated. Although a significant difference was only documented for VVTI (P = 0.0419), the other surrogates did behave differently in stages C and D dogs as compared to B1 and B2 animals ( Figure 1 ). An explanation for this might be the parasympathetic withdraw in CHF, in addition to a subtle sympathetic activation due to discomfort, which was likely suppressed in dogs with preserved vagal response. Also, the sustained increased sympathetic activation rather than transitional sympathetic activation might be involved with the distinct response to OCR in symptomatic dogs as compared to the asymptomatic ones. In people, QT prolongation and instability are known to relate to ventricular arrhythmias. Since dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease are prone to developing ventricular arrhythmias, this study investigated whether indices derived from QT interval could be used to predict an increased likelihood of arrhythmias regardless of clinical signs. 167 client-owned MMVD dogs (stages B1/B2/C) admitted for cardiac evaluation were recruited for a prospective cross-sectional study. Every dog underwent an echocardiogram and ECG recording. Fifty consecutive QT intervals were measured for each dog. QTs were corrected for heart rate and used to calculate the average QT (QTa), QT variance (QTv), total instability (TI), short term (STI) and long term (LTI) instabilities. A significant difference between asymptomatic and symptomatic animals was documented for every parameter (P < 0.0001),with higher values found for stage C dogs. Significant difference between B1 and B2 also existed for QTa. An AUC >0.5 was found when QTa and STI were used to discriminate dogs with or without ventricular arrhythmias (Figure 1 ). Dogs with QTa >310 (sensitivity:56%/specificity:71%), and STI >11 (sensitivity:56%/ specificity:85%) were shown to be slightly (15%) and moderately (30-45%) more prone to developing ventricular arrhythmias, respectively. Also, an AUC > 0.5 was documented when every QT index was used to distinguish animals with remodeled (B2/C) and non-remodeled hearts (B1). QTa and QTv best discriminated B1 from B2/C dogs and B1/B2 from C dogs, respectively. Because an increased QT instability was shown in symptomatic patients, QT indices might translate into prognostic surrogates for arrhythmias and CHF in MMVD dogs. Brachycephalic syndrome is characterized by primary and secondary upper respiratory tract abnormalities, which may result in significant upper airway obstruction. Cardiovascular and hemodynamic changes may also be present. However, unlike upper respiratory abnormalities which have been intensely studied, there is a paucity of information regarding cardiovascular and hemodynamic changes related to the syndrome.",

Furthermore, their heart silhouette was considered bigger than CG (higher VHS index), with signs of right-side cardiac remodeling. However, no significant variations were observed on echocardiographic examination which could indicate signs of cardiac remodeling in both groups. The best performance obtained by the BG based on LVIDs and FS% variables could be explained by catecholamine release since there was no chemical restrain during examination procedure and these animals were more stressed at the examination table. It is believed that, since the animals on BG group were all young adults, with a mean age of 2.5 years, they did not have enough time to manifest all the complications, including cardiovascular and hematological, related to the syndrome. It is our belief that with aging thus, with progression of the condition, right-side cardiac remodeling, and alterations in blood gas and arterial blood pressure would be more evident. Even so, depending on severity, development of pre-capillary pulmonary arterial hypertension may also occur. Our results suggest brachycephalic syndrome may have effects over the cardiovascular system. Therefore, we encourage the need of a thorough investigation to better understand the cardiovascular changes related to brachycephalic syndrome in order to distinguish them from specific heart conditions, especially when attaining predisposing dog breeds. Mitral valve myxomatous degenerative disease (MVMD) is the main heart disease in dogs, whose evolution leads to significant secondary hemodynamic changes with activation of cardiac and neurohormonal compensatory mechanisms.

Stress echocardiography with dobutamine is commonly indicated to detect cardiac dysfunction in asymptomatic patients, evaluating myocardial contractile reserve and viability. Pharmacological stress test was performed with dobutamine to evaluate the myocardial function via two-dimensional speckle tracking in healthy dogs and in different stages of the MMVM. The study included 15 Beagle dogs, distributed in 3 groups and selected according to the internal diameters of the left ventricle in diastole and the aortic ratio (DIVEd/Ao). The groups were constituted: Group I (Control) -5 healthy dogs without MMVD; Group II -5 dogs with MMVD (DIVEd)/Ao ratio lower than 2.8; Group III -5 dogs with MMVD and DIVEd/Ao ratio higher than 2.8. The animals were submitted to the echocardiographic examination performed by a single operator and evaluation was performed before and after dobutamine infusion. Dobutamine was diluted in 5% glucose solution, following the progressive scheme: 5 lg/kg/minute for 3 consecutive minutes; 7.5 lg/kg/minute for 3 consecutive minutes; 10 lg/kg/minute for 3 consecutive minutes. The images were analyzed using the Syngo Velocity Vector Imaging (VVI) algorithm optical flow algorithm (SIEMENS \u00d2 ). Data were submitted to the normality test and to repeated measures analysis of variance and Tukey's test. The aim of this study was to evaluate the adaptations involving the left ventricle, across the gestational process and its diastolic function, using tissue Doppler echocardiography. Animals: 15 pregnant bitches, healthy aged 2-6 years and weighing between 5 and 15 kg. Heart rate and blood pressure clinical evaluation was performed, as well as echocardiography M-mode, spectral and tissue Doppler, in the estrous (EZ), every 15 days during pregnancy (PD 15, 30, 45 and 60) and 45 days post partum (PP). The variables from the evaluation were submitted to statistical analysis. Heart rate (HR) (P = 0.149) and systolic blood pressure (SAP) (P = 0.564) did not show significant changes during pregnancy. The parameters that have undergone significant changes were EF (P = 0.0016) and FS (P = 0.0019). AVVmax, PVmax, wave E'(s) S' (s) and S' (lat) being influenced by the gestational period (P < 0.05). These changes could be explained by cubic regression model. The E:A (P = 0.041) IVRT (0.044) relation and A '(lat) (0.023) also suffered influence of pregnancy, but had a nonparametric residual distribution. Pregnancy produces changes in maternal hemodynamics also influencing diastolic function. Myocardial contractility increases as a result of an improvement in systolic performance, while diastolic function changes significantly revealing a more compliant ventricle, which is the physiological response to increased volume and metabolic requirements due to gestation. Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a hemodynamic and pathophysiologic condition defined an increase in systolic pulmonary artery pressure greater than 30 mmHg. Classically, this condition can lead to right ventricular dysfunction, which is associated to poor outcomes, especially in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Unfortunately, right ventricular function in dogs with pulmonary arterial hypertension has been poorly investigated. Thus, the aim of the present study was to assess the right ventricular systolic function in dogs with tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary hypertension by echocardiographic evaluation.",

Results are summarized in Table 1 LASSBio 294 is a compound, developed by the Laboratory of Evaluation and Synthesis of Bioactive Substances (LASSBio \u00d2 ) of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ) made from the substrate safrole, a compound extracted from sassafras oil, found in Brazilians plants such as the cinnamon-white (Ocotea pretiosa). The inodilator effect of the compound has been demonstrated in bioassays, using isolated and intact aortic rings, and in whole hearts and fractions of myocardial of rats, suggesting that the mechanism of action for its vasodilatory effects is related to inhibition of phosphodiesterases, and the inotropic effect on the increased Ca 2 + uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In rats with experimentally induced myocardial infarction, LASSBio 294 decreased collagen deposition, presumably regulating inflammation mediators. In addition, it increased cardiac lusitropism, decreasing left ventricular filling pressure, modulating the action of the SERCA protein, increasing Ca 2 + uptake by the sarcoplasmic reticulum, inducing myocardial relaxation and improving diastolic function. In previous studies performed by these authors on healthy beagle dogs, the oral administration of the compound lowered blood pressure, without causing hypotension or other toxic effects and increased the shortening fraction by 19.1%. Faced with the need to test the compound in a non-rodent mammal with myocardial disease, it was proposed in this study to verify the action of LASSBio 294 (2 mg/kg, n = 7) on the cardiovascular parameters of New Zealand rabbits with dilated cardiomyopathy induced by doxorubicin, using pimobendan (3 mg/kg, n = 6) as a positive control, both treatments were administered every 12 hours for 30 days. DCM was induced by intravenous administration of 1 mg/kg of doxorubicin, twice a week for three weeks and weekly thereafter until FS = 25% or less was achieved. The animals were evaluated weekly by: electrocardiography, echocardiography, blood pressure measurement, chest X-ray and biomarkers of renal and hepatic function and myocardial injury. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Animal Use of the Federal University of Goias (UFG) under the protocol number 006 / 14. The data were submitted to analysis of variance and compared by means of Tukey test, adopting 5% of significance. Under these conditions, LASSBio 294 increased systolic function, increasing FS by 35% in the second week, and improved diastolic function in a superior manner to pimobendan, maintaining the E /A ratio <1 and E '/ A' <1 and reducing IVRT, without altering the arterial pressure or producing proarrhythmogenic or toxic effects and also, reduced the serum concentration of creatinine. However, it did not prevent the evolution of the congestive condition, since two animals presented pulmonary edema and effusions. Thus, the pre-clinical in vitro and in vivo testing stages of LASSBio 294 was concluded, and it was tested in rodent and non-rodent mammals, healthy and with induced DCM, with a positive inodilator and lusitropic effect. Therefore, it can be concluded that LASSBio 294 is a promising compound, which needs to be used in clinical trials with individuals with naturally occurring DCM, so that it can complete the necessary trials for its rise as drug, allowing an increase in the existing therapeutic protocols. Pulmonic stenosis (PS) is one of the most common congenital heart defects in dogs, affecting various canine breeds including English and French Bulldogs (FB). PS has been extensively described in English bulldogs. However, to the best of our knowledge, no specific study has been dedicated to PS in FB. The objective of this prospective observational study was therefore to document the epidemiological, clinical, and echocardiographic features, and risk factors for death in FB with PS. The study population consisted of 66 FB. In most cases (53/66, 80%), at least 2 obstructive lesions were observed (most commonly (42/66, 64%) valvular and supravalvular), using color-flow Doppler mode and 3-dimensional echocardiography. The median Doppler-derived peak transvalvular pulmonary gradient (DG) was high: 170 mmHg (lower-upper quartiles: 139-223 mmHg), with a DG \u2265200 mmHg in 33% of FB. Among the 51 FB for which a follow-up was available, 21/51 (41%) died, 67% (14/ 21) of all deaths being cardiac-related (CD) at a median age of 3.5 years. In univariate analyses, age (HR=2.2 per 1 year; P = 0.02), clinical signs at presentation (HR=3.7; P = 0.03), DG (HR=1.2 per 10 mmHg; P = 0.01), right ventricle dilation (HR=5.0; P = 0.04), moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation (HR=7.6; P < 0.01), and right-sided congestive heart failure (HR=4.8; P = 0.05) were significantly associated with time to CD. After adjustment for age and DG, tricuspid regurgitation remained significantly associated with time to CD (HR=5.1; P = 0.02). In conclusion, PS in FB are commonly severe and complex, with tricuspid regurgitation being an independent predictor of CD. Accurate measurements are integral for device selection and sizing to minimize complications associated with minimally invasive transcatheter closure of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), in particular regarding minimal ductal diameter (MDD) to device ratio depending on method of measurement. Standard measurements are typically obtained with two dimensional (2D) angiography and echocardiography. The aims of this study were to characterize PDA dimensions including MDD, ampulla diameter 3 mm above the MDD and morphology based on right lateral angiography, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) from the right and left imaging windows and 2D, biplane, and 3D transesophageal echocardiography (TEE).",

ANP levels increased post-treatment in all cases (mean AE standard deviation: pre = 292 AE 163 vs. post = 908 AE 866). NT-proBNP levels increased in 4 cases and decreased in 5 cases (pre = 6563 AE 2061 vs. post = 5627 AE 3026).

Carperitide is a human ANP agent, which is why we expected higher ANP levels post-treatment. We observed a decrease in NT-proBNP levels in all cases that were treated for more than 7 hours. This is thought to be due to a time lag until the half-life period of NT-proBNP and the stretch stimulation of the ventricular muscle, which are reflected in the blood concentration of NT-proBNP. In addition, the ventricular muscle stretch was inhibited by the decrease in left atrial pressure following the administration of carperitide, which lasted for more than 7 hours. Lastly, the decrease in aldosterone levels was thought to be due to the inhibitory effects of carperitide on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. This study suggested that carperitide administration is effective since pulmonary edema is improved and aldosterone is suppressed.",

MeanHR was 125 bpm (range 62-203 bpm), minHR was 82 bpm (range 37-163 bpm) and maxHR was 217 bpm (range 126-307 bpm). Sex, age, weight, cardiac diagnosis, and study site had no significant impact on survival. For every 10 bpm increase in meanHR, the risk of all-cause mortality increased by 35% (hazard ratio 1.35; 95% CI 1.17-1.55; P < 0.001). Median survival time of dogs with meanHR < 125 bpm (n = 23) was significantly longer (1037 days; range 524-open) than dogs with meanHR \u2265 125 bpm (n = 23) (105 days; range 67-267 days) (P = 0.0012). Only meanHR was independently associated with survival time (P < 0.003) by multivariate regression. Our results suggest that aggressive rate control in dogs with AF leads to reduced mortality and prospective studies targeting meanHR of 125 bpm or lower are indicated. This study aimed to evaluate left atrial volume (LAV) in dogs in different stages of chronic mitral valve disease (CMVD), and to evaluate the association of these values with congestive heart failure (CHF). Our hypothesis was that LAV increases with severity of CMVD and can be used to detect CHF in dogs with CMVD. Eighty dogs were included in a prospective crosssectional clinical study, grouped according to the staging of CMVD proposed by the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine (A, B1, B2 and C), based on clinical signs and echocardiographic evaluation. Left atrial volume was calculated using the biplane area-length method from the left apical two and four chamber views at the end of ventricular systole. The LAV was indexed to body weight. LAV/kg showed high values (P 25%-75% =3.91-6.81) compared with groups A (0.82 mL/kg, P 25%-75% =0.64-0.95), B1 (0.91 mL/kg, P 25%-75% =0.47-1.29) and B2 (2.23 mL/kg, P 25%-75% =1.93-2.85). Analysis of ROC curve for CHF diagnosis showed area under curve of 0.92 for LAV/ kg. A LAV/kg >3.26 mL/kg was the optimal cut-off identified for detecting CHF in dogs with CMVD with a sensitivity and specificity of 90%. In addition, when LAV is greater than this cut-off, it increases to 90% the probability to detect CHF (an increase of 40% in diagnostic capacity than pre-test), which allows for the decision to treat for CHF. In conclusion, left atrial volume increases with severity of CMVD and helps the detection of CHF in these dogs. The soluble fraction of ST2 (sST2) is the circulating isoform of ST2, a member of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor family. The sST2 is induced when cardiomyocytes and cardiac fibroblasts undergo mechanical strain, making it a promising biomarker of fibrosis and cardiac remodeling. sST2 has been widely studied in human medicine, and characterized as an important prognostic biomarker and an independent mortality predictor. However, there are no studies determining reference values or evaluating the influence of gender and age on sST2 in healthy dogs. Therefore, this study aimed to measure serum levels of sST2 in healthy dogs, in order to determine normal values for the study population and to evaluate the influence of gender and age on this biomarker concentration for future assessment of dogs with heart disease. With this purpose, a prospective cross-sectional clinical study was conducted, and included a sample of 60 healthy small-to-medium size dogs, males and females, adults of different ages. There was no significant difference in sST2 serum levels between males (22) and females (38) (P = 0.980) or between age groups in the study population (P = 0.358). The reference values found for the serum levels of sST2 in healthy dogs ranged from 36.94 to 44.67 pg/mL (CI 95%), with a mean value of 40.80 pg/mL. There was no influence of gender or age group on serum levels of sST2 for the assessed dog population. It was possible to suggest a reference range for the biomarker in healthy dogs. The soluble fraction of ST2 (sST2) is considered a cardiac biomarker, which is induced mechanically by the stretch of cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts. This biomarker has prognostic value in human cardiology, and it is considered an important independent mortality predictor. However, studies assessing sST2 in dogs are still lacking. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the utility of sST2, compared to NT-proBNP and cardiac troponin I (cTnI), for assessment of dogs with chronic mitral valve disease (CMVD). With this purpose, 151 dogs in different stages of CMVD were submitted to clinical exam, laboratory tests, cardiologic exams and measurement of sST2, NT-proBNP and cTnI. The results demonstrate that sST2 was higher in dogs in CHF compared to non-CHF dogs. However, when dogs were stratified according to CMVD stages, it was not possible to differentiate the stages based on sST2 concentrations. NT-proBNP and cTnI were higher in CHF dogs, as well as in more advanced stages of CMVD. There was correlation between sST2 and NT-proBNP and cTnI. Analysis of ROC curve for CHF diagnosis showed areas under the curve (AUC) of 0.66 for sST2, 0.86 for NT-proBNP and 0.76 for cTnI. As for prognosis assessment, sST2 concentrations higher than 40 pg/mL indicated higher mortality compared to groups with lower sST2 values. Results suggest that sST2's performance as a standalone diagnostic test is limited and inferior to the other studied biomarkers. However, sST2 seems to be a useful independent prognostic marker, and mortality predictor in dogs with CMVD. Chronic valvular heart disease (CVHD) is the most common morbidity, of great relevance in the internal medicine of small animals. The scope of the present study was to evaluate the main diagnoses performed in an 11-year (2005-2015) period at the cardiology unit of a teaching hospital. In the period of the study, 11,921 dogs were attended, with gender balance: 51% males and 49% females. Mongrel dogs and Poodles represented both 25% of the animals. The mean age of the patients was 129 months, of which 45% (5,387) sought the unit for pre-anesthetic evaluation. Excluding pre-anesthetic evaluation, CVHD accounted for 64% of the diagnoses, healthy dogs 19%, congenital anomalies 3%, arrhythmias 3%, pericardial effusion 3% (178) Retrospective review of medical records for dogs with MMVD was performed. Client-owned forty-eight dogs were included in this study. Every dog was presented for evaluation of heart disease: 34 dogs with MMVD (according to mitral regurgitation(MR) severity: mild, n = 12; moderate, n = 11; and severe groups, n = 11) and 14 healthy age and weight-matched controls. The conventional echocardiographic parameters including fractional shortening (FS), ejection fraction (EF), E velocity, E/A ratio, E/E' ratio, left atrium to aorta ratio (LA/Ao), end-systolic volumes indexed to body surface area in B-mode (EDVI B ), end-diastolic volumes indexed to body surface area in B-mode (ESVI B ) and PW TDI parameters were recorded.

Chronic mitral valvular disease (CMVD) is the most common acquired canine heart disease, characterized by resultant volume overload firstly leading to left atrial enlargement. Occasionally, dogs with CMVD concomitant with renal insufficiency are found. Pathological interactions exist between cardiovascular diseases and renal disorders, which was recently defined as cardiovascular-renal disorders (CvRD) in veterinary medicine. Although the mechanisms of CvRD are not yet fully understood, cardiac diseases and renal dysfunction have recognized as both important determinant of prognosis to each other. Of tools for evaluation of cardiac function, speckle-tracking echocardiography (STE) is newer technique that allows more accurate assessment of left atrial (LA) as well as left ventricular (LV) functions. In the present study, the aims were to evaluate LA and LV function using STE, to assess the correlation between the class of cardiac and renal disease, and to investigate the correlation among the class of renal disease, echocardiographic variables, and laboratory variables in different stage of CMVD dogs and CMVD dogs concomitant with renal disorders.",

The use of pimobendan in stage C dogs is well established, but has been debated due to the apparent preservation of the myocardial inotropism in these patients. Amlodipine is a vasodilator drug with no inotropic effects, usually used in stage D dogs. Ten dogs were randomized to group A and eleven to group B. Both groups were treated with furosemide and enalapril maleate, but group A dogs also received pimobendan (0.25 mg/kg BID) and the group B ones, amlodipine (0.1 mg/kg BID). All dogs were evaluated before the beginning of the medications (T0), thirty days later (T30) and sixty days after T0 (T60), observing changes in echodopplercardiographic and electrocardiographic examinations, as well as systolic blood pressure. There were no significant differences in electrocardiographic or systolic blood pressure measurements between the groups. The echodopplercardiographic examinations showed a statistically significant difference in speeds in Em waves, between groups at T0 and in the amlodipine group between T0 and T60 and speed of Am wave, between T30 and T60 times. These parameters may indicate a change in early myocardial relaxation. This is the first prospective randomized double blinded study comparing pimobendan and amlodipine in stage C CMVD dogs.",

Ultrafiltration (UF) has major advantages such as reducing the amount of blood transfusion and removal of various cytokines in human medicine. We performed MVP for dogs with spontaneous mitral valve regurgitation(MR) under CPB and investigated the effect of ultrafiltration. Twentytwo dogs diagnosed with severe MR that underwent MVP under CPB were included. Depending on whether or not ultrafiltration was used, it was divided into a non-UF group and a UF group. We performed CUF (Conventional Ultrafiltration) and MUF (Modified Ultrafiltration). The lowest hematocrit (Ht) value and Ht after the end of CPB in both groups were compared. The average of the lowest Ht during the operation was 23.0% in the non-UF (n = 11) group and 24.0% in the UF group (n = 11), and no significant difference was observed between the two groups. The average Ht after the end of the CPB was 29.0% in the non-UF group and 35.5% in the UF group. Thus the average Ht was significantly higher in the UF group (P = 0.01). We also analyzed cases with low body weight (5 kg or less) separately. There were 6 such cases in the non-UF group and 9 low body weight cases in the UF group. The lowest Ht and the Ht after the end of the CPB was significantly higher in the UF group. Notably, the average Ht after the CPB was 10% higher in UF group (36.0%) than in non-UF group (26.0%).The amount of cardioplegia sufficient to produce cardiac arrest varies depending on the specific case. This often results in excessive hemodilution. Since it helps to drain excess fluids under such circumstances, CUF is thought to contribute to the difference in Ht in this study. In addition, during MUF, residual blood in the extracorporeal circuit can be returned to the patient's body. As a result, the Ht after the end of the CPB were higher in the UF group than in the non-UF group. We conclude that UF during CPB increases the lowest Ht value during CPB and increases Ht after end of the CPB in dogs undergoing MVP. These difference are particularly noticeable in small dogs. T.

However, apparently does not improve the quality of life of patients undergoing to these interventions. Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is the second most common feline primary cardiomyopathy. However, few data are available regarding prognostic variables in large feline RCM populations. The aim of this retrospective study was therefore to analyze the clinical course of cats diagnosed with RCM between 2001 and 2015 at the Alfort Cardiology Unit, and to identify factors associated with cardiac death (CD). RCM diagnosis was based on the following echocardiographic criteria: left atrial (LA) or biatrial enlargement associated with normal or mildly altered left ventricle (LV). Cats with mildly altered LV should also have a restrictive LV filling pattern. Median survival time to CD and adjusted hazard ratios (HR) were estimated by Kaplan-Meier method and multivariable Cox models, respectively. The study population consisted of 92 cats with RCM. Most RCM cats (64/92, 70%) were symptomatic at the time of diagnosis, with dyspnea related to congestive heart failure in 57/64 cats (89%). Fifty-eight of the 72 RCM cats for which follow-up was available died (81%). CD represented 64% of all death causes, with a median survival time from diagnosis to CD of 667 days. Independently of age, biatrial enlargement and arrhythmia, the risk of CD was increased by both the LA on aorta (Ao) ratio and the presence of severe LA enlargement (LA:Ao ratio \u22652): HR=4.2 for a 1-unit increase, 95% confidence interval (CI)=[1.7-10.7] (P = 0.002) and HR=2.5, 95% CI= [1.1-5.6] (P = 0.003), respectively. In conclusion, CD is common in RCM cats, and LA enlargement is significantly associated with decreased survival time. Arterial thromboemboli (ATE) are a devastating consequence of heart disease in cats. Although the antiplatelet medication clopidogrel has shown superior efficacy to aspirin for prevention of cardiogenic ATE in cats, treatment failures with clopidogrel still occur. In humans, treatment failures are often attributed to variation in metabolism of clopidogrel to the clopidogrel active metabolite (CAM). The primary objectives of this project were to quantify variation in plasma CAM concentrations between cats and determine if these differences are correlated with variability in clopidogrel metabolism and/or body weight.",

However, there are no studies determining reference values or evaluating the influence of gender and age on Gal-3 in healthy dogs. This study aimed to establish reference intervals for Gal-3 in a healthy dog population and to evaluate the influence of gender and age on this biomarker concentration. A prospective cross sectional clinical study was conducted, and included a sample of 60 healthy smallto-medium size dogs, males and females, adults of different ages. Considering the gene homology of approximately 85% (http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/homologene) between canine and human Gal-3, human ELISA kit (KitRD#DGAL30, Quantikine ELISA, Fenix, USA) and canine (dog Galectina-3, EIAab \u00d2 , Wuhan EIAAB Science, China) were tested. Gal-3 concentration recovery for healthy dogs obtained with canine kit was significantly lower, with low repeatability and reproducibility, compared to the human kit, suggesting lower sensitivity of the canine Gal-3 kit used. Reference values obtained for human Gal-3 were 7.548 ng/mL (P 25%-75% = 8.933-10.960). There was no significant difference in Gal-3 serum levels between males and females (P = 0.2297) or between age groups \u22646 years and >6 years in the study population (P = 0.6936). The evaluation of the biological variation of this biomarker showed that concentrations of Gal-3 were unaffected by age and gender. These data suggest a reference range for the biomarker human Gal-3 in healthy dogs. Chronic mitral valve degeneration (CMVD) is a highly prevalent heart disease seen mainly in older small breed dogs. In order to follow the progression of heart failure (HF), galectin-3 (Gal-3) has been applied as a biomarker to identify pre-clinical cardiac diseases, progression and decompensation in human patients. This study aimed to establish the utility of this new biomarker, isolated or in association with Type B natriuretic pro-peptide (NT-proBNP) and cardiac troponin I to estimate short term prognosis in dogs with HF caused by CMVD. It was designed as a prospective cross-sectional clinical study with a longitudinal arm. One hundred thirty nine dogs were distributed among five groups with rigorous selection criteria, according to ACVIM CMVD staging (Control group: stage A-60 healthy small breed dogs, predisposed to CMVD; 28 dogs in stage B1, 20 dogs in stage B2, 20 dogs in stage C and 11 dogs in stage D), recruited from a Veterinary Teaching Hospital. Groups B1, B2, C and D had a second blood sampling at day 60. Measurements were obtained for human Gal-3, NT-proBNP and cTnI. Reference values obtained for group A for human Gal-3 were 7.548 ng/mL (P 25%-75% = 8.933-10.960). We concluded that the magnitude and variation observed in Gal-3 did not allow for detection of differences between stages of CMVD nor were capable of identifying patients in HF, compared to the other measured biomarkers, NT-proBNP and cTnI, already established for canine HF evaluation. Although not assessed in standard echocardiography, longitudinal myocardial fibers play an active role in ventricular contraction. Longitudinal Strain (LSt) and Tissue Motion Annular Displacement (TMAD) are techniques that evaluate these fibers. TMAD, which has not been investigated in dogs, is calculated as the dislodgement of a virtual point automatically determined between mitral's septal and lateral annulus toward the left ventricular apex. One of the reported advantages of TMAD over LSt is the possibility of having it calculated using images not suitable for strain analysis, as well as the reduced processing time. In this prospective cross-sectional observational study twenty-seven healthy dogs (1-14 years/2-32 kg) underwent an echocardiogram. Apical 4-chamber (AP4) and 2-chamber (AP2) images were obtained, which allowed the calculation of TMAD and LSt obtained from both images. Data underwent the Shapiro-Wilk test to check for a normal distribution. Results are shown in table 1. Similar TMAD and LSt was calculated from AP4 and AP2 images. No differences existed between males and females for TMAD-AP4, TMAD-AP2 and LSt. A positive correlation existed between TMAD-AP2 and LSt-AP2, Global LSt (combined AP4 + AP2 LSt) and body weight. Interestingly, TMAD correlated significantly with Ventricular arrhythmias (VA) were already demonstrated to be a concern in dogs with myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). The coupling interval (CI) and the prematurity index (PI) ( Figure 1 ) were shown to accurately differentiate benign and malignant VA in human beings, in which VA are known to be associated with an increased risk to either evolve into signs of heart failure or die suddenly. In this study, we investigated how the CI and PI perform in dogs with MMVD.",

We hypothesized that anatomical features of the heart and large airway were different, influenced by body size, and would relate to coughing when the heart enlarged. The purpose of this study was to compare relative heart volume and anatomical features of large airway in different body sizes using CT scan. Retrospective analyses performed on medical records of dogs without heart and lung disease that underwent CT scanning. Dogs (n = 209) were divided into 3 groups on the basis of body weight; small (<7 kg), medium (7 kg-20 kg), and large (\u226520 kg). The following parameters were calculated using OsiriX: thoracic volume, heart volume, relative heart volume to thoracic volume, heart length, distance from main stem bronchi to vertebra, tracheal diameter, and angle of bronchus. Relative heart volume was significantly large in small dogs (0.29 AE 0.070) and medium dogs (0.28 AE 0.061), compared with large dogs (0.23 AE 0.075). The relative distance from main stem bronchi to vertebra was significantly short in small dogs (0.10 AE 0.037), compared with medium (0.15 AE 0.043) and large dogs (0.19 AE 0.050). There was no significant difference in the angle of bronchus among the groups.

Two related Shiba Inu dogs were suspected to have neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (NCL) based on clinical signs, antemortem diagnostics, disease progression and autofluorescence of storage material on histopathology. A whole genome sequence (WGS) was generated with DNA from one affected dog using previously described techniques. The data were screened for potentially causal mutations in known NCL genes but no candidate variants were found. However, the WGS contained a novel homozygous deletion of a conserved codon in the HEXB gene (which encodes the beta subunit of beta-hexosaminidase). The deletion was not found in the WGS from 105 unaffected dogs of various breeds. The other affected Shiba Inu was also homozygous for this variant. Mutations in HEXB have been implicated in GM2 gangliosidosis (Sandhoff disease) in humans and in other dog breeds. Beta-hexosaminidase activity was measured in brain tissue from one of the affected dogs using previously described synthetic substrates. Activity against two different substrates was markedly reduced compared to a normal dog, consistent with Sandhoff-like disease (HEXB deficiency). Thus, we conclude that the HEXB mutation in these dogs caused GM2 gangliosidosis and led to their clinical signs. To our knowledge, this is the first report that GM2 gangliosidosis-associated storage material is autofluorescent. This study also demonstrates the utility of WGS for the efficient diagnosis of potentially heritable diseases in veterinary medicine by identifying a mutation that abolishes HEXB activity in Shiba Inu dogs.

Prospective studies will be required to determine whether a statistically significant correlation exists between HER2/neu status and patient outcome. Nevertheless, taken together, these data show that the majority of canine OSA express HER2/neu, and that dogs with tumors that have high HER2/neu combined scores have a tendency toward earlier metastasis and decreased OS. These data support the evaluation of HER2/neu targeted immunotherapies in both the prevention and possible treatment of metastatic OSA. Osteosarcoma (OSA) is the most common bone tumor in children and dogs; however, despite aggressive treatment, little improvement in survival times have been achieved in either dogs or people over the past 15 years. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression and play a fundamental role in cancer. Our laboratory previously identified a unique miRNA expression signature associated with canine OSA and found miR-34a expression to be significantly decreased in canine OSA tumors compared to normal canine osteoblasts. These data are concordant with recent studies demonstrating that miR-34a functions as a tumor-suppressor gene in human OSA and that loss of miR-34a is associated with a poor prognosis in human OSA patients. We hypothesize that loss of miR-34a generates a pattern of gene dysregulation that contributes to the pathogenesis of canine OSA.",

The American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine Oncology and Small Animal Internal Medicine listservs were used to solicit data pertaining to cases in which toceranib was used to treat canine GIST. Case data from 28 dogs with histopathogically confirmed GIST were received from 17 participating institutions. Dogs undergoing treatment other than surgical excision prior to toceranib were excluded. Clinical benefit (CB) was observed in 93% (26/ 28; 24 complete response [CR]/no evidence of disease [NED] , 1 partial response [PR] , 1 stable disease [SD] ). All dogs with microscopic disease experienced CB (21/21; 21 NED), while 71% (5/7; 3 CR, 1 PR, 1 SD) with gross disease experienced CB. Median duration of treatment in dogs experiencing CB was 36 weeks (1-159). At the time of data submission, 8/26 responding dogs were still receiving treatment and an additional 4/26 were experiencing continued NED following completion of prescribed therapy. In dogs with CB, the median toceranib dose was 2.6 mg/kg (0.5-3.5) and in 81% (21/26) was given three days per week. Treatment was well-tolerated with 57% (16/28) experiencing adverse events, a majority of which were Grade 1 or 2 gastrointestinal toxicities.

We hypothesized that OSA exosomes carry a unique cargo which manipulates healthy osteoblasts, resulting in alteration of bone turnover.",

Dogs receiving chemotherapeutics with currently perceived lower potential for CIVI may also benefit clinically from treatment with antiemetics and/or appetite stimulants. Further research to understand the true incidence and clinical impact of CIVI will contribute to development of guidelines to appropriately manage these effects in dogs. Cutaneous lymphoma represents 1% of skin tumors in dogs and is classified in epitheliotropic and nonepitheliotropic. Unlike the other anatomical forms of lymphoma, cutaneous lymphomas have a low response to the treatment, and dogs with nonepitheliotropic lymphoma have a lower survival time when compared to dogs with epitheliotropic form. The resistance of neoplastic cells to cytotoxic drugs is the major cause of failure of chemotherapy in cancer and one of multiple drug resistance mechanisms (MDR) is the active drug efflux mediated by ATP-Binding Cassette superfamily (ABC). Among these transporters is P-glycoprotein (ABCB1).The aim of this study was to investigate ABCB1 immunoexpression in cutaneous epitheliotropic and non-epitheliotropic lymphoma. Immunohistochemistry was performed in 18 paraffinembedded tumor samples of cutaneous lymphoma in dogs (11 nonepitheliotropic and 7 epitheliotropic) using CD20 and CD3 markers for immunophenotyping and ABCB1 antibody (C494 -Enzo Life Sciences \u00d2 ). It was found 5 epitheliotropic T-cells and 2 B-cells and 10 nonepitheliotropic T-cells and 1 B-cell lymphoma. Two samples of epitheliotropic lymphoma were negative for ABCB1 and the median percentage of labeled cells was 20% (0-40%) whereas in nonepitheliotropic lymphoma, all cases were positive for ABCB1 and the median percentage of labeled cells was 50% (20-90%) and statistical analysis showed a significant difference expression of this marker (P = 0.0162). In conclusion, the majority of cases with cutaneous lymphoma expressed P-glycoprotein and the subtype nonepitheliotropic showed higher labeled cells than epitheliotropic. Intestinal lymphoma is the main anatomical form of lymphoma diagnosed in cats. Cell proliferation indicators as Ki-67 expression and mitotic index may be important in assessing the clinical behavior of the tumor and to determine the degree of malignancy. The objectives of this study were to determine the expression of Ki-67 and mitotic index in intestinal lymphoma of cats and its relation with overall survival time. Forty-seven samples of cats with intestinal lymphoma were studied and immunohistochemical was performed for: CD3, PAX5 and Ki-67. The analysis of Ki-67 was made by counting 1,000 infiltrating lymphocytes in the tumor microenvironment and mitotic index was ranked as mild, moderate or high, by the evaluation of 10 microscopic fields at 409. The results showed a significant difference in the immunohistochemical expression of Ki-67 in B and T-cell Lymphoma (P = 0.001) with a median of 47.2% and 8.5%, respectively. The same was observed when comparing the histological type (lymphoblastic and lymphocytic), with a median of 40.5% and 8.2%, respectively (P = 0.002). Regarding mitotic index, two cats with lymphoblastic B-cell and one with lymphoblastic T-cell lymphoma showed high expression, while three animals showed moderate expression and the majority of cases, 41 animals (87.2%) had mild expression. In conclusion, Ki-67 expression was a better proliferative marker when compared to mitotic index in cats with intestinal lymphoma. Higher expression of Ki-67 was observed in those animals affected by lymphoblastic or B-cell and is related to low therapeutic response and shorter survival time. is typically caused by a growth-hormone (GH) secreting pituitary adenoma and is thought to be a common cause of feline diabetes mellitus. Medical pituitary inhibition has been challenging in some humans and cats with this condition. This could be related to variable expression of somatostatin (SSTR) and dopamine (DR) receptor expression. There are five different SSTR subtypes (SSTR1-5) and five different subtypes of DRs, with D2R being the predominant DR subtype in the human pituitary. Pasireotide, a somatostatin analogue with high binding affinity to SSTR1, SSTR2 and SSTR5, is effective at controlling GH secretion in feline acromegalics but somatostatin analogues with high binding affinity to SSTR2 (octreotide and lanreotide) are not.",

Specifically, this study focused on determining radioiodine dose by measuring thyroid gland size and percent of 99m TcO 4 uptake using thyroid scintigraphy. Hyperthyroidism was diagnosed in all cats by finding a serum T4 concentration above the reference interval and characteristics diagnostic of hyperthyroidism on nuclear scintigraphy. Scintigraphy was performed by obtaining images 30 minutes after IV administration of 3.0 mCi 99m TcO 4 . In cats in the novel dose group, percent dose uptake was calculated by drawing a region of interest around the thyroid gland lobe(s) and dividing the corrected counts (CPM) in the thyroid gland by the 99m TcO 4 dose (CPM). Cats with a percent dose uptake < 5%, 5-10%, and > 10% were calculated to receive 3 mCi, 3.5 mCi, or 4.5 mCi of 131 I, respectively administered subcutaneously. Thyroid size was assessed by a ratio of the thyroid ROI size (# of pixels) to the salivary ROI size (# of pixels) (TS). Cats with a TS ratio of <5, 5-10, and >10 were calculated to receive 3 mCi, 3.5 mCi, and 4.5 mCi of 131 I. The dose of 131 I to be given was first determined by measuring percent dose uptake. If the thyroid size fell into a higher dosing category than percent uptake, the dose was increased accordingly. Cats in the fixed dose group received a mean of 4.3 mCi of 131 I subcutaneously. Cats were evaluated 6 months after treatment to determine the functional status of the thyroid gland. Hypothyroidism was defined as having a serum T4 concentration below the reference interval and persistent hyperthyroidism was defined as having a serum T4 concentration above the reference interval 6 months post treatment. Fifty-eight cats were included in the novel dose group and the fixed dose group consisted of 25 cats treated prior to those in the novel dose group.

The influence of hyperthyroidism on serum SDMA concentrations warrants further investigation. Obesity is a frequent nutritional disorder in dogs and it is associated with several metabolic alterations and represents a risk factor for several systemic comorbidities. However, there is controversy about which of the adipose tissues contributes more to these complications in the canine species. The present study aimed to evaluate the subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue of ten obese female dogs and ten female dogs with eutrophic body condition, regarding adipocyte size and presence of leukocyte infiltration. The study was conducted with routine animals from the Veterinary Hospital, and all of the animals were submitted to a complete clinical examination, classification based on the body condition score and blood exams to exclude concomitant diseases. Fragments of subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue were obtained during electives ovariosalpingohisterectomy procedures, the samples were stained with Hematoxylin-Eosin and analyzed with Zeiss Microscope software. It was observed that obese dogs presented remarkably larger adipocyte size when compared to animals with ideal body condition, in a significance level of 5% through Student's T-test. Likewise, it was noted the presence of significantly higher leukocyte infiltrate in obese animals, in a significance level of 5% in the Kruskal-Wallis test, compared to animals with normal body condition that did not have leukocyte infiltration detected. However, the size of adipocytes and leukocyte infiltrate in obese animals did not differ significantly between the visceral and subcutaneous adipose tissue samples. It was concluded, therefore, that obesity in dogs is related with the increase of adipocytes and with presence of leukocyte infiltration, but it was not possible to state in this study that different fat deposits have differentiated metabolic and endocrine levels, which could interfere in a specific way in the inherent processes in obese and diabetic patients. Obesity is a frequent nutritional disorder in dogs and cats and it results in oxidative stress. The evaluation of oxidative stress can be performed through the process of lipid peroxidation, and malonate is one of the most abundant aldehydes. The evaluation method is called \"test for substances that react with thiobarbituric acid\" (TBARS). Objective of the present study is to evaluate oxidative stress by measuring the TBARS present in samples of obese dogs before and after the weight loss program. The work was carried out with routine animals of the Veterinary Hospital of the Pontifical Catholic University of Parana (located in Parana, Brazil). The animals were submitted to a complete clinical examination, blood count, biochemistry, urinalysis and systolic blood pressure measurement. Subsequently, they were classified as obese on the body scale; body mass index and percentage of body fat. The animals were divided into group 1 (pre-diet) and group 2 (post-diet). Ten obese animals were selected and submitted to a hypocaloric diet loss program. TBARS was performed using the Elisa technique. All animals in groups 1 and 2 presented TBARS values above the reference value, and there was a statistically significant reduction of the values from group 1 to group 2 (P = 0.034). Based on the results, it was concluded that obese dogs present higher production of lipid peroxidation than animals with ideal body scale, leading to the development of oxidative stress and elevation of TBARS concentrations. One of the most important endocrine tests for diagnosis and control of hyperadrenocorticism (HAC) in dogs is the ACTH stimulation. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of corticotropin inducing cortisol production in dogs. This possibility can be used as an alternative to tetracosactrin (Synacthen) which is, currently, the most used drug in this adrenal challenge test, mainly in Latin America.",

At Hypertriglyceridemia and elevated serum glucose were observed in dogs treated with chemotherapy associated with glucocorticoids. Further studies on these changes are necessary. In recent decades, the prevalence of feline hyperthyroidism (FHT) has increased significantly worldwide and is currently a major endocrine disease that causes high morbidity in middle-aged cats. Due to the lack of studies on this endocrine disease in Brazil, a retrospective study of stored serum samples from all cats older than eight years treated at the Veterinary Hospital of Anhembi Morumbi University (S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil) was carried out from January 2013 to January 2015, regardless of the main complaint that led them to be treated at the service. Thyroid function was evaluated through total thyroxine (T4T) measurements. A total of 212 cat serum samples were sent to a private laboratory, where T4T was measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA). Of the 212 assessed serum samples, 3.30% confirmed feline hyperthyroidism, 59.91% were within the normal range and 36.79% were below the normal value, suggesting sick euthyroid syndrome. In 2.35% of the samples, T4T values were close to the upper limit value, which raises the possibility that these cats had FHT, but whose comorbidities at the time of blood collection reduced T4T values in blood serum. We conclude that even though the prevalence of FHT in the assessed group was shown to be discreet, this clinical suspicion should be part of the differential diagnosis in cats aged \u2265 eight years. Endo-and exogenous hypercortisolemia is well known to associated with insulin resistance in dogs.

HT (tonicity > 315 mOsm/L) occurred more frequently in DD (45.9% vs 31.1% for NDD). The dMCV, a marker for HT, was significantly increased in DD (3.9 vs 1.7 fL for NDD). Increased dMCV predicted an elevated fructosamine (> 450 lmol/L) with 82.6% sensitivity and 42.8% specificity. The results show that stable, insulin-treated diabetic dogs frequently have HT and that GLU is the major osmole that contributes to HT in DD. An increase in dMCV is a modest predictor for serum fructosamine, suggesting the latter is an indirect marker for hypertonicity in DD. In conclusion, dogs with moderate/poor glycemic control show evidence of persistent HT, although additional studies are needed to investigate the role of persistent HT and its possible consequences for diabetic dogs.

A high prevalence of cholestatic disease, including gall bladder mucocele (GBM) has been reported in dogs with naturally-occurring pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism. Differences exist in the clinical features of dogs with PDH and concurrent cholestatic disease, and also is the management of these dogs with trilostane. In this study, 65 client-owned dogs with naturally-occurring PDH were analyzed. Each dog was treated with trilostane for at least 3 months before the study, and had a good clinical response, as determined by owners. Statistical comparisons of clinical signs, results of routine blood tests, basal and post-ACTH cortisol concentration, and optimal trilostane dosage were made after dogs were separated into the following 3 groups by ultrasonographic imaging: normal on ultrasound (NOU) group, cholestasis group, and GBM group. The GBM group had more severe clinical signs, and significantly different total serum cholesterol concentration and post-ACTH stimulation cortisol concentration at the time of diagnosis. Dogs that weighed <6 kg had a significantly higher prevalence of cholestatic disease than did the other dogs (P = 0.003). The optimal trilostane dosages for the GBM and cholestasis groups were 2.5 and 1.5 times the dosage of the NOU group, respectively (P < 0.001). Gall bladder disease associated with cholestatic disease is correlated with PDH in dogs, both in its clinical features and drug management. These findings may be associated with hypercholesterolemia, unidentified genetic factors, and the hydrophobic nature of trilostane.

In clinical practice, the TSH stimulation test is valuable for the diagnosis of hypothyroidism in dogs with a variety of NTIs, hyperadrenocorticism, or dogs administered glucocorticoids. The adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test is an excellent tool for assessing adrenal gland function in dogs. Among the various presentations of ACTH available for testing, the Depot Tetracosactide (Synacthen \u00d2 Depot) is economically advantageous in some countries, because of the volume and concentration of its ampoule (1.0 mg/1.0 mL). This advantage depends on the reuse of the surplus volume of the ampoule, as the indicated dose for dogs is 0.25 mL per dog. Our aim was to evaluate the effect of freezing on the biological activity of Depot Tetracosactide for the stimulation of adrenal gland in healthy dogs. Thirteen healthy adult dogs were submitted to ACTH stimulation test (0.25 mL/dog/IM) four times at intervals of two months between each test (0, 2, 4 and 6 months). The first stimulation test was done in every dog with the first aliquot of a fresh, refrigerated ampoule, opened at the time of application. The remaining three aliquots were stored at \u00c020\u00b0C in plastic syringes of 50 units protected from light. Samples for determination of serum cortisol by radioimmunoassay were obtained before, one and two hours after administration of the ACTH. All samples were thawed once and analyzed in duplicate by ANOVA. Serum cortisol levels did not differ significantly (P < 0.01) before or after freezing for all sampling times. We conclude that Depot Tetracosactide can be stored in plastic syringes at \u00c020\u00b0C for up to six months without interfering with the biological stability of the hormone. Portable blood glucose meters (PBGMs) are widely used because of their usefulness in the control of blood glucose levels. However, the accuracy of PBGMs has been questioned repeatedly, and factors that can interfere with blood glucose measurements have been identified.

Previous studies have shown a relationship between mucosal bacteria and host responses in cats with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and lymphoma (LSA). However, these earlier studies have not investigated the specific microbial etiologic factors nor the selective recruitment of mucosal tumor-infiltrating immune (CD11b+) cells which may promote tumor progression. The objective of the present study was to investigate the relationship between pro-inflammatory microbiota (including Fusobacterium spp., Helicobacter spp., Enterobacteriaceae) and mucosal CD11b+ cells in cats with small cell LSA vs. IBD. A retrospective analysis of cats diagnosed with intestinal LSA (n = 14) or IBD (n = 14) from 2010-2015 was performed. Following detailed diagnostic evaluation and confirmation of a histopathologic diagnosis, the mucosal microbiota of endoscopic intestinal biopsies of IBD and LSA cats was evaluated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) targeting the 16S rRNA genes of select pro-inflammatory microbiota. Host responses to microbial dysbiosis were studied using immunohistochemistry to identify cells of the gastrointestinal mucosa expressing intestinal NF-kB (p65) and CD11b+. Results indicated that most IBD/ LSA cats were middle aged or older having chronic gastrointestinal signs of several months duration. Analysis by FISH showed that mucosal bacteria (EUB) were uncommonly observed in the duodenum of diseased cats. The numbers of mucosal Bacteroides spp. and Clostridium spp. were increased (P < 0.05) in IBD cats as compared to cats with LSA. Conversely, total numbers of Fusobacterium spp. were increased (P < 0.05) in colonic tissues of cats with LSA vs. IBD (LSA: median 30 [range 0-378]; IBD: median 9 [range 0-346]). Moreover, the numbers of Fusobacterium spp. found within adherent mucus of colons in cats with LSA were increased (P \u2264 0.05) relative to other mucosal compartments. Mucosal cells expressing NF-kB and CD11b+ were increased (P < 0.05) in intestines of cats with LSA vs. IBD suggesting the presence of a pro-inflammatory microenvironment. In conclusion, alterations exist in the composition of the mucosal microbiota in cats with LSA and IBD. The intestine of cats with LSA is selectively enriched with bacterial species, including Fusobacterium spp. These microbiota may trigger recruitment of tumor-infiltrating immune (CD11b+) cells contributing to a pro-inflammatory environment that is conducive for intestinal LSA progression. Diarrhea and other sequelae of gastrointestinal hyperpermeability are common complications of antibiotic therapy. Akkermansia muciniphila is a mucin-degrading bacterium, positively associated with gastrointestinal epithelial health and decreased permeability.

Canine Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is believed to be a multifactorial disease due to an abnormal immune response to intestinal microbes in genetically susceptible individuals. IL-1b, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, has previously been shown to be elevated in biopsies of dogs with food responsive disease in a small number of cases. The purpose of this study was to investigate duodenal levels of IL-1b protein in a larger number of dogs with different clinical severity of IBD. Duodenal biopsies from ten dogs each with mild IBD (Canine Chronic Enteropathy Clinical Activity Index, CCECAI 0-5), moderate IBD (CCECAI 6-8), severe IBD (CCECAI \u22659) and dogs with protein-losing enteropathy (PLE), as well as 10 healthy Beagle dogs were included in the study. Biopsy samples were weighed prior to manipulation. Samples were homogenized at 20 Hz for 2 minutes in 500 lL homogenization buffer (PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20) with protease inhibitor cocktail. Tissue homogenates were centrifuged at 12500 RCF for 2 minutes and the supernatants frozen at \u00c080\u00b0C until the day of ELISA. Quantification of IL-1b protein expression was determined using a commercially available canine-specific IL-1b ELISA (Kingfisher Biotech Inc) following the manufacturer's assay instructions. All samples were analysed in duplicate. Median IL-1b expression (pg/ml/mg tissue) was 121.6 (range 38.3-219.4) in the severe IBD group; 19.7 (range 10.9-24.8) in the moderate severity IBD group; 13.3 (range 8.0-29.8) in the mild severity IBD group, 13.0 (range 8.0-27.9) in the PLE group, and 0.9 (range 0.3-1.4) in the healthy control dogs.

Imaging the jejunum in dogs is problematic. Ultrasound frequently misses mucosal lesions and traditional endoscopy does not typically reach the jejunum. ALICAM is a capsule endoscopy system that images the entire bowel. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively assess the frequency of jejunal lesions in dogs given ALICAM for gastrointestinal signs and/or laboratory abnormalities. A board-certified internist interpreted each study. Eight of 131 (6.1%) dogs had complete studies with lesions identified in the jejunum that were considered significant. Of the eight dogs with positive studies, 6 were given ALICAM for a regenerative anemia, while 2 had signs of overt gastrointestinal bleeding (melena). Five of 8 dogs had a normal gastrointestinal tract on ultrasound prior to ALICAM administration. One dog had a normal gastroduodenoscopy and a second dog had a normal gastroduodenoscopy and laparoscopy prior to ALICAM. ALICAM findings included ulcerated masses in 2/8 dogs, large erosions or ulcers in 4/8 dogs, and focal fluid, blood or mucosal abnormalities in 2/8 dogs. Following ALICAM, two dogs underwent manual push enteroscopy. In one case, the ulcerative lesions seen on ALICAM were not found. In the second case, the suspected lesion was identified and resected. A third dog had an exploratory laparotomy with subsequent identification and resection of the mass seen with ALICAM. ALICAM is useful in imaging the jejunum and should be considered an important diagnostic step in the work up of gastrointestinal disease, especially in cases of unexplained anemia where traditional endoscopy or ultrasound failed to identify a cause.

This difference was statistically significant (P = 0.002; Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test). Due to the retrospective nature of the study, metabolic markers of CBL deficiency could not be analyzed. Despite this limitation, our results suggest that oral CBL supplementation appears effective in treating dogs with EPI and subnormal or lownormal serum cobalamin concentrations. Since, according to the manufacturer, only traces of IF should be present in the PEz, this finding suggests that dogs, as has been demonstrated in humans, may have an IF-independent pathway for CBL absorption. Whether such an alternative pathway does exist in dogs requires further studies. Additionally, further studies comparing cellular cobalamin status after PO or PE supplementation in dogs with EPI are warranted. Three-dimensional organ-buds, or organoids, are a novel and organ mimicking in vitro model based on LGR5-positive stem cells that show realistic micro-anatomy. Recently, intestinal organoid cultures from various species including mice and humans have been described. However, canine intestinal crypt-derived organoids are not yet described. Since organoids can be infinitely expanded in culture, remain genetically stable, and can be differentiated to all cell types of the intestine, they represent an ideal in vitro model for intestinal diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease, virus infections, and drug screening.

It may further constitute a first step toward understanding the role of eosinophil degranulation in the pathogenesis of IBD in dogs. Proton pump inhibitor administration in humans is associated with an increased risk of enteric, particularly Clostridium difficile, infections. Omeprazole also alters the canine microbiome; however, no studies have explored its effect on the feline fecal microbiome and metabolome.

However, some bacterial genera were altered following omeprazole administration including an increased relative abundance of Streptococcus, Lactobacillus, Clostridium, and Faecalibacterium spp. and decreased Bifidobacterium spp. in all cats. The results of this pilot study suggest that omeprazole might have little impact on the feline fecal microbiome and metabolome when administered for 60 days or less. Larger studies are needed to confirm these results. There is evidence that oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of IBD in human patients particularly in the initiation and perpetuation of inflammation and in subsequent tissue damage. Oxidative stress occurs when there is a marked imbalance between the production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and their removal by antioxidants. Recent publications suggest that oxidative stress could also represent a significant factor in the pathogenesis of IBD in dogs. The objective of this study was to compare a panel of various serum biomarkers evaluating both the antioxidant response and the oxidative damage in dogs with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and healthy control dogs. Eighteen dogs with IBD and 20 healthy dogs were enrolled in the study. Trolox equivalent antioxidant capacity (TEAC), cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC), ferric reducing ability of the plasma (FRAP), total thiol concentrations, and paraoxonase 1 (PON1) activity were evaluated in serum to determine antioxidant response. To evaluate oxidative status, ferrous oxidation-xylenol orange (FOX), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and reactive oxygen species production (ROS) concentrations in serum were determined. Mean concentrations of all antioxidant biomarkers analyzed, with exception of FRAP, were significantly lower (P < 0.0001) in serum of dogs with IBD than healthy dogs. The oxidant markers studied were significantly higher (P < 0.0001) in serum of dogs with IBD than in healthy dogs. These findings support the hypothesis that oxidative stress plays an important role in the pathogenesis of IBD in dogs. L-lactate is generated from pyruvate via lactate dehydrogenase during normal cell metabolism. Lactobacillales (lactic acid bacteria) in the intestinal tract can synthesize both D-and L-lactate. Currently, serum lactate concentration is used as a marker of tissue hypoperfusion and hypoxia. Cases of D-lactic acidemia have been reported in dogs and humans with intestinal disease. Fecal lactate has also been shown to be increased in humans with short bowel syndrome and calves with diarrhea. Fecal lactate concentrations might serve as a marker of the microbial activity in the intestine. Therefore, the aim of this study was to analytically validate an enzymatic method for the measurement of both D-and L-lactate in canine feces.",

In humans, increased expression of membrane-bound CD25 has been reported in patients with autoimmune or inflammatory diseases, during transplant rejection, and some types of neoplasia. A soluble form of CD25 (sCD25) is generated by proteolytic cleavage and has a molecular mass of 45 kDa.

A positive correlation has been reported between the membrane expression of CD25 and the serum concentration of sCD25. In vitro, activated T cells and Tregs have been shown to shed sCD25, therefore high concentrations of serum sCD25 are thought to be reflective of a sustained immune activation.

However, kittens that died or were euthanized due to severe diarrhea harbored a significantly greater quantity of live EPEC and eae compared to kittens without diarrhea. Kittens diagnosed with EPEC had significantly greater severity of inflammatory infiltrates in the small intestine and colon and increased epithelial injury in the small intestine.

Future efforts to identify mechanisms responsible for susceptibility to EPEC-induced diarrhea will lead to advanced understanding of EPEC pathogenesis in kittens and children. The gut microbiota is important in maintaining intestinal health. Bile acids are increasingly appreciated to play a role in regulation of gut microbial composition and intestinal health. Bile acids are synthesized from cholesterol, conjugated in the liver, and once secreted into the gastrointestinal tract (GIT), undergo modification by certain members of the intestinal microbiota. Numerous bile acid receptors (e.g., farnesoid X receptor and G proteincoupled membrane receptor) have been identified along the GIT and are responsible for regulating metabolism and maintaining an anti-inflammatory environment in the gut. The aim of this study was to develop and analytically validate a gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry (GC/MS) assay for the identification and quantification of bile acids in canine feces.",

Many studies have evaluated the alteration of faecal microbiota in canine chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disease, and less research is focused on mucosal microbiota, especially in the ileum and colon. The objectives of the current study were to evaluate ileal and colonic mucosal microbiota in dogs with steroid responsive enteropathy (SRE) before and after 4 months of treatment, and to compare them to control dogs (CD).",

Larger prospective clinical studies are necessary to elucidate the mechanisms leading to this altered fecal composition despite enzyme replacement therapy. The aim of the present study was to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms using a genome wide association study (GWAS) which may confer genetic susceptibility or resistance to IBD. Genomic DNA was extracted from EDTA blood or saliva samples of 96 cases and 98 controls. Genotyping of cases and controls was performed on the Canine Illumina HD SNP array and data generated were analyzed using PLINK. Using Fst and logistic association analyses, we identified 16 candidate genes that have been previously reported to be associated with human IBD or are involved in the pathways that are linked to the disease. Eight of these genes, one (PTPRC; Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase, Receptor Type C) on chromosome 7 and seven (IL4, IL5, IL13, CSF2; Colony Stimulating Factor 2, SLC22A4 and A5; Solute Carrier Fami-ly22 member 4 and 5, IRF1; Interferon Regulatory Factor 1) on chromosome 11 have been identified in both approaches. In conclusion we identified 16 genes associated with IBD in GSDs. Our results suggest that Th2 cytokines could be implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD in GSDs. Targeted re-sequencing of the genes identified in our study will help to identify causative SNPs and consequently functional analysis of the causal SNPs reveal insights into mechanisms involved in pathogenesis on canine IBD. The purpose of this study was to analyze capsule endoscopy (CE) findings in hypoalbuminemic dogs. The records of 178 dogs given ALICAM for gastrointestinal signs and/or laboratory abnormalities were retrospectively assessed. Seventeen dogs were hypoalbuminemic and had complete studies. The mean AE SD albumin was 1.9 AE 0.4 g/dL, mean AE SD age was 7.5 AE 2.8 years, and mean AE SD weight was 20.5 AE 11.4 kg. Eight of 17 dogs had concurrent anemia. Prior to CE, 15 of 17 dogs had ultrasound examinations. The gastrointestinal tract (stomach, small intestine [SI], and colon) was normal (n = 8) or characterized by nonspecific wall thickening (n = 7). Seventeen of 17 CE studies were abnormal. Findings consisted of irregular/thickened mucosa with or without erosions (n = 6), numerous dilated lacteals (n = 4), severe erosions or ulcers with active bleeding (n = 2), mass (n = 2), hookworms (n = 1), SI nodules (n = 1), and lesions consistent with colonic vascular ectasia (n = 1). Lesions seen on CE (dilated lacteals, colonic vascular ectasia) were confirmed in two dogs that subsequently underwent traditional endoscopy. A third dog had gastroduodenoscopy prior to CE, which showed SI hemorrhage, but missed the SI nodules later identified with CE. A diagnosis of Strongyloides was made based on endoscopic biopsies and fecal Baermann test. A fourth dog with severe melena had a negative gastroduodenoscopy and laparoscopy, yet CE subsequently identified severe gastrointestinal erosions and ulcers thought to be secondary to NSAID administration. CE can be informative in dogs with hypoalbuminemia even when lesions are not identified with traditional endoscopy, surgery, or ultrasound. Severe acute pancreatitis (SAP) is associated with systemic complications and high mortality rate in dogs. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been investigated for their therapeutic potential in several inflammation models. This study investigated the effects of canine adipose tissue-derived (cAT)MSCs in a rat model of SAP induced by retrograde injection of 3% sodium taurocholate solution into the pancreatic duct. cATMSCs labeled with dioctadecyl-3,3,3 0 -tetramethylindo-carbocyanine perchlorate (1 9 10 7 cells/kg) were systemically administered to rats and pancreatic tissue was collected 3 days later for histopathological, quantitative real-time PCR, and immunocytochemical analyses. Greater numbers of infused cATMSCs were detected in the pancreas of SAP as compared to sham-operated rats. cATMSC infusion reduced pancreatic edema, inflammatory cell infiltration, and acinar cell necrosis, and decreased pancreatic expression of the pro-inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-a, interleukin (IL)-1b, -6, -12, -17, and -23 and interferon-c, while stimulating expression of the antiinflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 in SAP rats. Moreover, cATMSCs decreased the number of cluster of differentiation 3positive T cells and increased that of Forkhead box P3-positive T cells in the injured pancreas. These results indicate that cATMSCs can be effective as a cell-based therapeutic strategy for treatment of SAP in dogs.

A recent study by Weese and Jalali showed limited impact of refrigeration for 14 days on the feline and canine microbiota. This concurs with the current study, which demonstrated that maintaining feline fecal samples at ambient temperature up to 96 hours (4 days) has no demonstrable effect on the bacterial membership and structure. Results from LEfSe and random forest analysis also provides supportive evidence for the lack of difference between time points. Current research suggests that the use of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy to treat clinical diseases, such as chronic enteropathy, may be optimized through donor selection and pre-conditioning strategies. We therefore investigated the effects of several pre-conditioning methods and donor sex on in vitro cytokine production of adipose-derived canine MSC (cMSC). Passage 6 cMSC were generated from cryopreserved subcutaneous adipose tissue from 6 healthy, adult, intact dogs, 3 female and 3 male. cMSC were subjected to 6 different conditions: control, poly I:C, IFNc, TGFb, serum-free media, and a mixed hypoxic environment. Supernatants from the cMSC were harvested after 1, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours. Levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, TGFb, VEGF, and MCP-1 were determined by ELISA. IL-10 was below the level of detection in all samples. TGFb was measured in the wells that were treated with TGFb but was generally otherwise undetectable. IL-6 was only detected in relatively low levels in some samples from one male and one female donor. cMSC produced small to moderate amounts of IL-8 constitutively, which reached peak levels by 18 hours and was altered by pre-conditioning. cMSC produced large amounts of MCP-1 and VEGF, which were altered by pre-conditioning. Generally, the serum-free and the mixed hypoxic environment decreased production of all measured cytokines. Samples from the male donors showed significant donor variability compared to females suggesting that treatment success might be influenced by careful donor selection as well as pre-treatment conditioning, depending on the desired outcome.

Humans affected by autoimmune hemolytic anemia show several cytokine derangements, including a newly defined subset of T cells, Th17 cells secreting IL-17. IL-17 appears to have a critical role in the pathogenesis of AIHA in people, and work in mouse models of the disease indicates IL-17 as a potential treatment target. It was hypothesized that dogs with IMHA would display significant elevations in IL-17 concentrations compared to healthy controls.",

IL-17 was significantly increased at the time of presentation (D0) in dogs with IMHA (P = 0.0158) compared to healthy dogs as well at D2 (P = 0.0404). Over the course of hospitalization, IL-17 significantly decreased between D0 and D2 (P = 0.0146) and D0 and D4 (P = 0.0010) for the discharged patients (N = 19) . No changes in IL-17 levels were observed between D0, D2 and D4 among the dogs that were euthanized in hospital. There was no correlation between IL-17 concentration and bilirubin levels, lactate or any of the CBC parameters at the time of presentation or throughout the hospitalization. IL-17 is elevated in dogs with IMHA and seems to decrease when response to therapy is observed. Oxidative stress plays a considerable role in the pathophysiology of multiple diseases and has been well documented as a contributor to disease in both the human and veterinary literature. Oxidative stress results from the production of reactive oxygen species that cause cellular injury through direct and indirect mechanisms. One at-risk cell type is the erythrocyte, however, the role of oxidative stress in canine anemia has not been investigated. Oxidative stress is primarily assessed through the activity of antioxidant enzymes, the concentration of endogenous antioxidants, and byproducts of oxidative damage. The purpose of this study was to determine if oxidative stress is present in anemic dogs. We hypothesized that anemic dogs would have an alteration in the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx), a reduction of total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and an increased concentration of urinary F2-isoprostanes (F2IsoP, a byproduct of lipid peroxidation) when compared to healthy dogs.",

Further, dogs with a hemolytic anemia had lower mean GPx activity when compared to dogs with non-hemolytic anemia, but this difference did not reach significance (P = 0.51). However, this may suggest that the degree of oxidative stress may be more severe with hemolysis. TAC concentrations (P = 0.10) and urinary F2-isoprostanes (P = 0.75) did not significantly differ between groups. This is the first study in veterinary medicine demonstrating a glutathione peroxidase deficiency and subsequent oxidative stress in anemic dogs. Further studies are warranted to determine if antioxidant supplementation would improve survival and overall outcome as part of a therapeutic regimen for anemic states, especially those with hemolysis. Yunnan Baiyao is a popular Chinese herbal medicinal agent that has been used for its anti-inflammatory properties, hemostatic properties and wound healing properties in people for approximately a century. It has been recommended for use in dogs to control hemorrhage such as epistaxis or with splenic hemangiosarcoma. However there have been no studies evaluating the safety of Yunnan Baiyao for use in dogs and there have been no in vivo studies on the effect of Yunnan baiyao on coagulation parameters in healthy dogs. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of Yunnan Baiyao on the kinetics of hemostasis and to determine if there are any adverse effects associated with the administration of Yunnan Baiyao to healthy dogs. This study used six healthy purpose bred dogs. Baseline evaluation included a complete blood count, serum biochemistry profile, urinalysis, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, and hemostatic kinetics using ROTEM thromboelastrometry (EXTEM, INTEM, FIBTEM). ROTEM parameters assessed included clotting time, clot formation, clot stability and clot lysis. The dogs were administered oral Yunnan baiyao at a dose of 25 mg/kg orally once daily for 6 days. On day 2, day 4 and day 6 ROTEM thromboelastometry was again performed on all dogs. On day 6 a complete blood count, serum biochemistry profile, urinalysis, prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time was also performed on each dog. No significant changes were noted with treatment in any of the parameters monitored. No significant change in clotting times (P > 0.2), clot formation time (P > 0.2), and clot formation rate (P > 0.2) were noted when pre-treatment ROTEM values and post treatment ROTEM values were compared. From the results of this study we can conclude that Yunnan Baiyao is safe for administration to dogs and does not result in significant changes to baseline health parameters or coagulation parameters in healthy dogs. We hypothesized that NETs form during storage of canine RBCs, that prestorage LR reduces NETosis, and that application of supernatant from stored, non-leukoreduced (NLR) RBC units would induce NETosis in healthy canine neutrophils.",

DMSO is the standard solvent used for biotin, since biotin is insoluble in aqueous solutions. Biotin precipitates in DMSO solutions of 50% or less, and high DMSO concentrations are therefore needed for biotin labeling studies. Inadvertent dilution of DMSO in residual plasma during RBC labeling therefore has the potential to render biotinylation ineffective. Additionally, we found that different concentrations of DMSO cause variable lysis of RBCs: 60% DMSO (diluted in PBS) caused marked hemolysis, 50 and 100% caused moderate hemolysis, 30, 40 and 90% caused mild hemolysis, and 10, 20, 70 and 80% caused no hemolysis. Our findings suggest that transfusion studies using biotinylated RBCs may be susceptible to technique artifacts, with subtle variations in DMSO concentrations leading to either failure of biotinylation or inadvertent RBC damage. Biochemical and immunologic changes consistent with erythrocyte storage lesion have been described in feline packed red blood cell (pRBC) units. Oxidative damage occurs in stored human erythrocytes as evidenced by decreased glutathione concentrations, but this has yet to be investigated in cats. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of storage on glutathione, osmotic fragility, and methemoglobin reductase activity in feline pRBCs. Whole blood (60 mL) was collected from five healthy cats into blood bags containing CPDA-1. Each bag was split in half and pRBC units were prepared. For each cat, additive solution 3 (AS-3) was added to one of the units and pRBCs were stored at 4\u00b0C. Aliquots of each unit were sampled on days 1, 14, 28, 35, and 42 of storage and assayed for glutathione, osmotic fragility, and methemoglobin reductase activity. Friedman's test was used to assess changes over time. Glutathione decreased significantly with time in both AS-3treated and untreated pRBCs. Osmotic fragility increased significantly with time in untreated pRBCs, but did not change from baseline in pRBCs treated with AS-3. Methemoglobin reductase activity was unchanged in both treated and untreated samples. Storage of feline pRBCs over 42 days leads to glutathione depletion and increased osmotic fragility. These findings are further evidence for storage lesion in feline pRBCs. However, the addition of AS-3 mitigates the some of these changes and should be considered in the development of future blood product protocols. Fresh frozen plasma is used to treat a variety of conditions in critical illness. Plasma transfusion has the potential for causing adverse reactions and is a limited resource. There are currently no evidence-based plasma transfusion recommendations in dogs and cats. These include documented coagulopathy with bleeding or a planned invasive procedure (DC), warfarin reversal (WR), massive transfusion (MT), and factor deficiency (FD). The aim of this study was to determine if plasma transfusions in animals met guidelines used in human medicine. The medical record system was retrospectively searched for dogs and cats that had received plasma transfusion. The indication (s) for the transfusion recorded. The percentage in each category was recorded, as well as those cases with no clear indication. Survival was recorded.",

Clopidogrel bisulfate, a thienopyridine drug, causes irreversible inhibition of platelet aggregation in response to ADP and collagen, common initiators of clot formation.

This variable response to treatment may be due to alterations in the cytochrome P450 gene coding for enzymes responsive for clopidogrel metabolism, as several polymorphisms have been identified in humans. This is the first study to investigate the effect of the generic formulation of clopidogrel on platelet aggregation, but due to the low sample size, meaningful conclusions cannot be made about the varying response to the drug. Further studies should aim to increase sample size, and investigate metabolic, genetic, and other intrinsic factors that could affect drug efficacy.

The purpose of this study was to describe the frequency with which dogs treated for primary immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) at veterinary teaching hospitals are vaccinated after diagnosis, and investigate whether an association exists between vaccination and vaccine reactions (including but not limited to relapse of IMHA) in this population. A retrospective descriptive observational study was performed involving 66 dogs at 2 veterinary teaching hospitals: Colorado State University (57) and Oregon State University (9) . Medical records databases were searched for cases meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria for primary IMHA. Owners and referring veterinarians of identified dogs were contacted with a survey via postal mail to gather information regarding vaccination of the dog following diagnosis. Referring veterinarians were contacted by phone regarding vaccination history for each dog prior to diagnosis of IMHA. At least one survey was returned in 44 cases. Results indicated 22 dogs did not receive vaccinations after diagnosis, and 21 dogs did receive vaccinations after diagnosis. For the remainder of dogs, no survey was returned or the survey was excluded for inconsistency of information. Of the vaccinated dogs, only 2 possible vaccination reactions were reported (vomiting and urticaria in 1 dog, and worsening anemia in 1 dog). A date of vaccination prior to diagnosis was available for 46 dogs. The mean number of days between vaccination and initial diagnosis of IMHA was 351 days. These results indicate that vaccination occurred among nearly half of dogs diagnosed with IMHA, with rabies being the most common vaccine administered (19 of 21 dogs). This may reflect the legal requirement of rabies vaccination in most locations. Adverse events were uncommon overall, but comparison to the rate of adverse events in the general population was not performed. Finally, this study did not document a temporal relationship between vaccination and initial diagnosis of IMHA, although comparison to a control population is necessary to confirm this finding. Canine heartworm disease due to Dirofilaria immitis is an important disease causing hemostatic disorders. Although there are several studies showing the relationship between coagulation pathway and heartworm infection, most of studies have used conventional methods of laboratory assessment of hemostasis. There is a limitation in using conventional coagulation test to evaluate hypercoagulable state in heartworm infected dogs. Thromboelastography (TEG) provides a more truthful reflection of in vivo hemostasis compared to conventional coagulation tests in the diagnosis and monitoring of patients. In this study, we describe TEG findings in dogs with heartworm infection and compare their coagulation status as determined by TEG to clinical presentation, heartworm grade, and conventional coagulation tests.",

Dog with heartworm infection were graded to four groups according to blood work, radiography, echocardiography. Platelet count, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, plasma D-dimer concentration, plasma fibrinogen concentration, and thromboelastography were performed in the all dogs. In the results, the value of alpha showed a tendency to increase as the grade increased (table 1, P = 0.03), which indicates higher level of fibrinogen activation in more advanced grades. In the rank coefficient correlation between conventional coagulation tests and TEG, platelet had a significantly positive coefficient correlation with MA and G value in heartworm infected grade 1. An interesting result is that a dog diagnosed femoral arterial thromboembolism showed significantly hypercoagulable state in TEG, compared with conventional tests ( figure 1) . Also, the serial TEG analysis of a dog with disseminated intravascular coagulation represented more hypocoagulable state over time ( figure 2 ). This study suggests that application of TEG is helpful for diagnosis and treatment of heartworm infection in dogs. Ehrlichia canis infection in dogs can manifest with clinical signs related to bleeding and also commonly causes thrombocytopenia. The exact mechanisms of bleeding and thrombocytopenia are unknown but are thought to be related to processes such as vasculitis and immune and non-immune processes on platelets. It is also unknown why some dogs show signs of bleeding while other dogs do not despite significant thrombocytopenia. It is possible that platelets become activated during infection and/or blood clots become resistant to fibrinolysis which could prevent a bleeding phenotype.

Based off of the TEG tracings, Greyhounds appeared significantly hypocoagulable (decreased MA) and hyperfibrinolytic (increased LY30, LY60, and decreased CL30, CL60). Future studies should investigate whether hyperfibrinolysis contributes to the propensity to bleed in Greyhounds. The platelet aggregometry results were significantly lower for both agonists in Greyhounds as compared to Beagles which could be erroneously interpreted as decreased platelet function in this breed. Therefore, just as hematocrit and platelet count can affect TEG tracings, the same considerations should be applied to whole blood impedance platelet aggregometry. Both the high hematocrit and low platelet counts in healthy Greyhounds can potentially contribute to lower aggregometry readings due to suspected in vitro effects rather than reflecting true in vivo effects since other studies have demonstrated normal platelet function in Greyhounds. Therefore, it is not recommended to compare whole blood impedance platelet aggregometry measurements of Greyhounds to non-Greyhounds. Subject-based or population-based reference intervals should be established in this breed for accurate interpretation of results.

However, this may be an overrepresentation due to the popularity of the breed. More female cases had elevated hepatic Cu in all breeds with the exception of the West Highland white terrier, in which only male cases were identified. Affected dogs in this study were on average 7-8 years old at the time of diagnosis except for Doberman pinschers, which were on average younger. Higher levels of hepatic Cu were more likely associated with more severe inflammatory changes on histopathology. Coagulation abnormalities are common in human and veterinary patients with hepatobiliary disease. Due to the liver's complex and varied influence on hemostasis these derangements can result in a multitude of outcomes in the patient, including a propensity toward bleeding and/or thrombosis. Hepatic biopsy is commonly indicated in the diagnostic work-up of hepatobiliary disease in dogs, and increasingly performed via laparoscopy. Knowledge of a patient's hemostatic status prior to biopsy is considered essential to assess bleeding risk. However, conventional tests are not always accurate predictors of clinical bleeding. Additionally, newer techniques for evaluating the coagulation system have recently become available.",

In these 27 dogs, laparoscopic liver biopsy was safe and adequate samples to achieve a histologic diagnosis were obtained in all cases.

The records of 104 dogs and 30 cats that had a percutaneous ultrasound-guided liver biopsy were retrospectively reviewed.

Canine atopic dermatitis (CAD) is a common, chronic, genetically-predisposed, and relapsing inflammatory skin disease. CAD is a multifaceted disease resulting from a complex interaction between environmental and genetic factors. Both of these factors can shape skin barrier function and the immunological response of predisposed patients. CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + Regulatory T cells (Tregs) become known to prevent excessive immune responses through their immunoregulatory properties and therefore play a leading role in the maintenance of immunological homeostasis. There was only few researches that was performed to analyze the relationship between CAD and proportion of Tregs in periphery blood. In the present study, the aims were to assess the proportion of circulating Tregs (CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + , CD4 + FoxP3 + ) in the healthy and the atopic dogs to analyze implication of Tregs to CAD and to investigate the correlation of Tregs with CAD severity and age.",

This study demonstrated negative association between Treg frequency and disease severity. The numbers of circulating tregs of atopic dogs decreased as they got older. Francisella tularensis, a pathogenic Gram negative intracellular bacteria that causes pneumonia, skin lesions, and systemic illness known as Tularemia that can affect cats in certain regions of the United States. 12/15 lipoxygenase (LO) is an enzyme that utilizes arachidonic acid to produce anti-inflammatory mediators. Deletion would be expected to produce an increase in the severity of disease. Since 12/15-LO has a role in regulating inflammation, our hypothesis is pneumonic tularemia in mice would produce increases in morbidity and mortality. Francisella tularensis Live Vaccine Strain (Ft LVS) is pathogenic to mice but not to people. C3H wild type (WT) and 12/15 LO knock out (KO) mice were infected intratracheally with a sublethal dose of Ft LVS and their weights were monitored for 10 days. On day 10 post-infection the mice were euthanized and the lungs, spleens, and liver were collected for analysis. The cellular phenotype of infiltrating inflammatory cells, leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and KC levels were determined from lung tissue. Histopathology was assessed from the lung and liver, and splenic weights were determined. 12/15 LO KO mice had increased morbidity compared to WT mice indicated by their significant weight loss. KC, a chemoattractant for neutrophils, was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the lung tissue of KO mice. Inflammatory cells (neutrophils, T cells, and macrophages) and pulmonary histopathology scores were significantly higher (P < 0.05) in KO mice. In contrast LTB4, which assists in host defense was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) in 12/15 LO KO mice. Splenic weights were significantly (P < 0.05) higher than WT spleens correlating with the severity of disease. Given this information, 12/15 LO plays a role in regulating inflammation in pneumonic Tularemia. Eicosanoids are highly conserved among species and It is possible that 12/15 LO agonists may be used as natural therapeutics to aide in the resolution of pneumonia in domestic animals, but further studies are needed. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have immunomodulatory functions and differentiation capacity, conferring them with various clinical uses. Although MSCs have been applied in the treatment in various inflammatory diseases, mechanistic research on feline MSCs is lacking. Accordingly, in this study, we aimed to analyse the immunomodulatory mechanisms of MSCs isolated from feline adipose tissue (fAT-MSCs). Cytokine expression in RAW264.7 murine macrophages and allogeneic feline peripheral blood mononuclear cells (fPBMCs) was measured using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and compared according to the presence of fAT-MSCs. We also extracted RNA and collected supernatants from fAT-MSCs for measurement of soluble factor expression levels by qRT-PCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g., tumour necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), inducible nitric oxide synthase and interleukin (IL)-1b, were significantly decreased in coculture of mitogen-stimulated RAW264.7 cells with fAT-MSCs compared with that in RAW264.7 cells. Additionally, the expression of immunomodulatory factors from fAT-MSCs, including cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), transforming growth factor (TGF)-b, indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and hepatocyte growth factor, increased in the presence of RAW264.7 cells. Expression of proinflammatory TNF-a, interferon-c and IL-6 decreased, and expression of anti-inflammatory IL-10 increased during coculture of mitogen-stimulated allogeneic fPBMCs with fAT-MSCs. TGF-b, COX-2 and IDO expression and prostaglandin E-2 production from fAT-MSCs increased in the presence of allogeneic fPBMCs. Our data suggested that soluble factors secreted from fAT-MSCs play an important role in the immunomodulatory effects of these cells. These findings may be helpful in the application of fAT-MSCs to feline patients with immune-related diseases. Gene therapy is an emerging treatment modality in human medicine and animal models including dogs and cats are often used in preclinical studies to demonstrate efficacy and safety. Research into gene therapies for some conditions in animals has started as well. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) based vectors are among the most common delivery mechanisms. It is well established that antibodies to AAV vectors can impact the success of gene transfer. The primary objective of this study was to determine if pet populations have circulating antibodies to two AAV vectors used for gene therapy.",

A risk of reactivation of E. canis infection with immune suppression in previously treated dogs was considered minimum. Heartworm antigen testing is routinely performed to diagnose heartworm infections in dogs. The original diagnostic tests employed immune complex dissociation (ICD) methods to release antigen that was bound by endogenous canine antibodies. However, ICD methods were discontinued in the majority of commercially available assays due to improvements in assay technology (O'Connor T, et al. \"Immunoassay applications in veterinary diagnostics.\" In: Wild D, ed. The Immunoassay Handbook. 4th ed. Great Britain: Elsevier, 2013: 623-645). Interference from immune complexes is not unique to heartworm diagnostics and various methods are available for ICD. The purpose of this study was to evaluate different methods of ICD for the detection of free heartworm antigen by microtiter plate ELISA and evaluate the performance of ICD in pet dogs. The original, USDA licensed PetChek \u00d2 Heartworm Test (IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.) utilized pepsin at an acidic pH for ICD prior to antigen testing. Using a set of experimental samples, the pepsin method was compared to heat treatment, and acid treatment. All methods were found to release complexed antigen and produce positive results when the post-treatment samples were tested for heartworm antigen by microtiter plate ELISA. While heat treatment required a minimum of 600 lL of either serum or plasma, the pepsin and acid methods needed only 50 lL of the patient sample. To extend this to a field population, samples from 1115 patients were submitted to IDEXX Laboratories between 2014 and 2016 for investigation of discrepant heartworm results. Samples were evaluated with and without pepsin ICD using PetChek \u00d2 Heartworm. A total of 112 patients became antigen positive with the ICD protocol only, 122 were positive with and without ICD but demonstrated at least a 50% increase in plate absorbance (OD), and 109 were positive both with and without ICD but had minimal change in plate OD following ICD. The remaining 772 patients did not have detectable antigen with and without ICD. In a prospective study, dogs receiving pre-adulticide heartworm treatment consisting of a macrocyclic lactone in combination with doxycycline were evaluated in the same way. Serial samples from 12 dogs revealed that 3 had a reduction in free circulating antigen within 4 weeks of initiating treatment. In all cases, free antigen levels could be recovered with ICD. Heartworm antigen testing with ICD can be a valuable adjunct diagnostic for those patients who have discrepant results, have intermittently used a macrocyclic lactone, or are receiving treatment. There is no information about fecal shedding of feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) in cats after modified-live vaccination. Aim of this study was to provide information about parvovirus DNA-shedding in recently vaccinated, adult, healthy cats and to assess related factors using Chi-squared and Fisher 0 s exact test. Forty cats were included in the study and were vaccinated with a commercial FPV modified-live vaccine. Feces of cats was tested for the presence of parvovirus DNA on day 7, 14, 21, and 28 by quantitative real-time PCR. Pre-and post-vaccination serum antibody titers were measured by hemagglutination inhibition on day 0, 7, and 28. Almost one-third of the cats (12/40; 29.3%; 95% CI: 18.0-45.6) shed parvovirus DNA during the post-vaccination period. Parvovirus DNA was detectable up to 28 days after immunization. Parvovirus DNA-shedding was significantly associated with a lack of protective pre-vaccination antibody titers (P = 0.016; odds-ratio (OR): 6.44; 95% CI: 1.44-28.89) and with post-vaccination titer increases (P = 0.029; OR: 5.00; 95% CI: 1.17-21.39). Vaccinated cats can shed of parvovirus DNA at least up to 4 weeks after vaccination and shedding occurs more commonly in cats without protective titers. Post-vaccinal shedding thus can interfere with diagnosis in recently vaccinated cats that are presented with clinical signs suspicious for of panleukopenia. Feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1) is the most common feline infectious disease in cats, with over 90% of cats housed in group settings being infected. Liposome-TLR ligand complexes (LTLC) have been shown in mice to enhance innate immunity and induce non-specific protection against both viral and bacterial diseases. A new formulation of LTLC to be used as a mucosal immune stimulant (MucosImmune) has been shown to be safe and capable of stimulating local immunity in cats. The objectives of this study were to determine whether MucosImmune administered prior to FHV-1 experimental inoculation or at the first signs of clinical illness post-inoculation in kittens could lessen clinical signs and shedding of FHV-1 when compared to untreated controls.",

Sporotrichosis is the most frequent subcutaneous mycosis detected in urban areas, it is caused by zoonotic pathogenic species of Sporothrix schenckii complex that affects especially cats. In Brazil, due to a large outbreak of sporotrichosis in the city of Guarulhos (State of S\u00e3o Paulo), the disease has become notifiable. Clinically the disease is characterized as a subcutaneous mycosis, with papular lesions with nodular feature or ulcero-gummy. The definitive diagnosis is obtained by the isolation of the fungus in culture. However, the result can take weeks, resulting in a delay to start the appropriate treatment and disease could spread through other community members. The aim of this study was standardization of the diagnosis of feline sporotrichosis by Cell Block Cytology (CB). CB consists of immediate wet cell fixation in preservative liquid based cytology solution (Surepath, BD), and histological processing. We compared two collecting methods: fine needle aspiration (FNA) and exfoliative brushing (EB) with an endocervical brush. Ten samples of skin lesions of nine suspects cats were collected, (five samples with each method). EB allowed a cell thick sediment, and production of several histological sections, with a slide stained with periodic acid Schiff method. All samples collected by this method showed positive results for fungal structures. FNA cases revealed low cellularity and impossible histological processing. This standardization shows that CB processing is possible with EB of lesions and fixation in cytology preservative solution, allowing storage for up to a month after harvest and further testing, as immunohistochemistry. CB is an alternative for sporotrichosis diagnosis. Canine leptospirosis, a disease of worldwide distribution and significant zoonotic potential, is an acute bacterial infection of dogs caused by pathogenic spirochetes belonging to the genus Leptospira. Timely diagnosis of canine leptospirosis is important because early initiation of antibiotic therapy provides the greatest opportunity for a successful patient outcome. However, diagnosis is hindered by vague clinical signs and by diagnostic methods that can be difficult to interpret and require a lag time for results to be reported. A lateral flow test (WITNESS \u00d2 Lepto, Zoetis) has been developed for the detection of IgM antibodies to Leptospira, offering the advantage of a result in 10 minutes at the point-ofcare without the need for specialized equipment or expertise. Our hypothesis is WITNESS Lepto can detect IgM to four significant Leptospira serovars and will yield positive results earlier or concurrent to that of the microscopic agglutination test (MAT), the serological reference method for diagnosis of leptospirosis.",

In conclusion, WITNESS Lepto detects IgM to the four serovars included in this study and detects seroconversion earlier or concurrent to that of MAT. At the point-of-care, WITNESS Lepto may be useful as a screening test for acutely ill dogs suspected to have leptospirosis. Infection with Histoplasma capsulatum is routinely diagnosed in cats using a quantitative enzyme immunoassay (EIA) performed on urine +/or serum. Any level of antigenuria/antigenemia is considered indicative of active infection, and urine EIA has a > 90% sensitivity. The objective of this study was to determine if urine EIA results at the time of diagnosis (prior to the administration of antifungal agents) were predictive of outcome (i.e., survival to 6 months) for cats with histoplasmosis. Pre-treatment urine EIA results were available for 50 cats examined at four institutions between April 2012 and December 2015; 35 cats were alive at Day 180, 12 had died (median survival time: 24 days; range 2-124 days) and three were lost to follow up. For statistical purposes, positive results below the level of quantification (19 ng/mL) were listed as 19.1 ng/mL. The median EIA at the time of diagnosis for cats alive at 6 months was 5 ng/mL (range: 0-19.1); this was similar to findings for the non-survivors (median: 7.29 ng/mL; range of 0.78-19.1; P = 0.54) [ Figure 1 ]. Surviving cats were significantly younger (mean age: 6.9 yrs) than non-survivors (mean age 9.9 yrs; P = 0.03) but median body weights (3.8 kg v 3.6 kg) and rates of pulmonary involvement (22/35 v 9/12) were similar. These findings indicate that urine EIA results at the time of diagnosis are not predictive of outcome in cats with histoplasmosis and should not be used as a prognostic indicator. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus spp. (MRS) carriage rates in companion animals have been well described in North America and Europe but not investigated in Australia.

It has been proposed that a similar correlation exists for p27 antigen concentration. The purpose of this study was to utilize a next-generation microtiter plate ELISA to quantify p27 antigen concentrations and compare that with real-time PCR results for a population of samples obtained from the field. A total of 353 feline samples submitted between 2010 and 2015 to IDEXX Laboratories for RealPCR TM testing that included FeLV were utilized for the study. Matched plasma that had been stored frozen was tested using the PetChek \u00d2 FeLV 15 ELISA (IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.) for p27 antigen. Recombinant p27 protein was used to generate a standard curve for quantifying the results. Of the 89 FeLV PCR positive samples, 27 had crossing points (Cp) less than or equal to 21 and all had p27 concentrations greater than 50 ng/mL (average 286 ng/mL). Twenty-eight PCR positive samples had Cp greater than 30 and all had p27 concentrations less than 10 ng/ mL, with 19 having no detectable antigen. Of the 264 PCR negative samples, 24 samples had p27 antigen concentrations from 1-30 ng/mL. This study demonstrates a potential correlation between proviral DNA loads and the concentration of circulating p27 antigen. Results from the combined diagnostic methodologies may provide more objective information for staging (progressive or regressive-latent or regressive-focal) and monitoring FeLV infections. Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV) and Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) are globally distributed retroviruses capable of inducing fatal disease in cats. FeLV is spread primarily via saliva among cats in close casual contact whereas FIV is most commonly transmitted between combative cats through deep bite wounds. Rapid test methods for detection of FIV antibody and FeLV p27 antigen in blood are well established as standard practice among veterinarians to screen cats for these diseases. The purpose of this observational study was to evaluate macrogeographic trends in FIV and FeLV test results in pet cats over a 9-year period between 2008 and 2016. The data were mined from a comprehensive international database of SNAP \u00d2 Feline Triple \u00d2 , SNAP FIV/FeLV Combo, and SNAP FIV/FeLV Combo Plus field results and used to assess the frequency of singular and co-infections of these retroviruses in cats.

Gammaherpesviruses (GHVs) are members of an emerging subfamily of the Herpesviridae. The two major human GHVs, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), are clinically important pathogens because those viruses possess tumorigenesis potential especially in immune-compromised patients. In feline practice, we often experience tumor cases, especially lymphomas. Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) was a major cause for the development of lymphoma in the past days, however, the majority of lymphoma cases are shifting to FeLVfree cats. But the mechanism of tumorigenesis in these spontaneously developed lymphomas has not been well understood. Under this situation, GHV became a candidate which explain the lymphomagenesis in domestic cats. Recent study identified a novel GHV in domestic cats (Felis catus GHV, FcaGHV), and epidemiological surveys found that FcaGHVs are distributing in several countries including the United States, Australia, Singapore, Germany and Austria.

FcaGHV prevalence in Japan (1.4%) was lower than previously reported prevalence in other countries and areas (US, 16%; Europe, 16.2%). It was unable to determine the cause of this difference. However, Japanese isolates were identified to have close genetic relationship to domestic cat derived FcaGHV. This finding suggested that the virus is highly conserved in each animal species and GHV is harboring in host specific manner as well as other herpesviruses. The risk factor for GHV infection in Japanese cats was FIV infection and it was same as previously reported. But we have to clarify how FIV enhances the GHV infection and/or viremia. The clinical importance of GHVs infection in feline practice is still unknown. Further investigation will be necessary to identify the pathogenicity of GHVs in domestic cats. Zoetis has been conducting an ongoing surveillance program to evaluate the susceptibility trends of antimicrobial agents against canine and feline Escherichia coli (E. coli) pathogens isolated from Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) since 2011. The data were analyzed annually and the first five years of susceptibility data for amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ampicillin, cefovecin, cefpodoxime, ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, marbofloxacin, orbifloxacin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole and cephalexin are presented here. A total of 3,300 E. coli strains, isolated as the etiological agent in cats and dogs presenting with naturally occurring UTIs and being seen at primary/general care practices were submitted to this surveillance program by 16 veterinary diagnostic laboratories throughout the United States (US) and Canada. The Minimal Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) for all isolates were tested using a broth microdilution system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Oakwood Village, OH) that conforms to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) standards.",

A number of diagnostic modalities have been evaluated to aid in the diagnosis of Lyme disease in dogs, with serological testing proving to be the most beneficial. Antibodies against outer surface protein A (OspA), OspC, OspF and antibodies against the C6 peptide are currently used most frequently in commercially available serological assays. Antibodies against OspC are often the first detected in serum after a new exposure to B. burgdorferi. In humans with Ixodes spp. infestation, doxycycline treatment has been shown to block progression of B. burgdorferi infection but whether this occurs in dogs is unknown. The purpose of this study is to report the effect of doxycycline administration on serological responses to OspA, OspC, OspF, and C6 peptide in dogs experimentally infested with wild-caught I. scapularis.",

While only 1 dog may have spontaneously limited antibody production against all 4 peptides, all 3 dogs administered doxycycline during the acute phase limited antibody production. These results should be confirmed in larger numbers of dogs, but may suggest that treatment when OspC antibodies are first detected may block development antibody responses associated with chronic B. burgdorferi infection. A natural resistance of cats to leishmaniosis, primarily due to a cellular immune response, is widely suggested. Leishmanin skin test (LST) has been successfully used in humans and dogs and a positive LST result indicates exposure to Leishmania and a state of cell mediated immunity. A total of 96 cats, seronegative for FeLV and FIV, presenting to a Veterinary Teaching Hospital in an endemic area in Brazil, were evaluated by LST. Leishmania infection was confirmed in 56 cats by bone marrow qPCR, and 40 non-infected cats composed the control group. Among infected cats, 23/56 presented clinical signs and 33/56 were asymptomatic. Each cat was intradermally injected with a suspension of 4 9 10 7 L. chagasi promastigotes (inactivated in thimerosal solution), in the inner surface of the right thigh, and thimerosal solution was injected in the opposite limb. All control and infected cats tested negative to LST at any time reading (24, 48 and 72 h after inoculation). We expected that at least part of the 26 asymptomatic (and seronegative) cats presented a positive LST. In canine leishmaniosis (CanL) LST can detect a high proportion of asymptomatic dogs, although some of them have negative LST even in the presence of a cellular immune response. The method employed was previously used for CanL, and its potential immunogenicity was confirmed by promoting positive LST in five naturally infected and asymptomatic dogs from the same endemic area. However, the LST tested do not seem to be an adequate tool for the diagnosis of feline leishmaniosis. Transportation of blood from remote areas can be problematic. While DNA is generally stable and a number of studies have evaluated DNA extracted from dried blood of mammals, there is minimal information determining the sensitivity of different techniques using dog blood.

E. ewingii is the most prevalent tick-transmitted Ehrlichia spp. identified in dogs from the Southern US. Fever, lameness, neutrophilic polyarthritis and neurologic abnormalities are considered common clinical findings in dogs naturally-infected with E. ewingii; however, nonclinical dogs can be PCR+. To further assess the clinicopathologic features in E. ewingii PCR+ cases, we analyzed the medical records of 30 naturally-infected dogs. To be included in this study, dogs had clinical data, archived whole blood available from North Carolina State University-College of Veterinary Medicine, and were E. ewingii PCR (+) and PCR (-) for other vectorborne pathogens including Ehrlichia spp. (E. canis, E. chaffeensis, and Panola Mountain Ehrlichia), Anaplasma spp., Babesia spp., Bartonella spp., Hemotropic Mycoplasma spp., and Rickettsia spp. Based upon diagnostic and/or retrospective research testing, all 30 dogs satisfied the inclusion criteria. Frequently reported physical exam findings included joint pain and effusions 10/30 (33.3%); heart murmur 8/30 (26.75); organomegaly 7/30 (23.3%); vomiting 6/30 (20%) and fever 5/30 (16.7%).

Hematological and biochemical abnormalities included increased abnormal lymphocytes 18/28 (64.3%); neutrophilia 15/28 (53.6%), of which 9/15 (60%) were characterized by a left shift; anemia 14/28 (50%), of which 8/14 (57%) were characterized as regenerative; monocytosis 13/28 (46.4%); lymphopenia 12/28 (42.9%); thrombocytopenia 11/28 (39.3%); elevated ALP 13/26 (50%) and ALT 10/26 (38.5%), of which only two dogs were receiving corticosteroids; hypoalbuminemia 9/26 (34.6%); and elevated creatinine 6/26 (23.1%). Urinalyses abnormalities included albuminuria 11/20 (55%); proteinuria with inactive sediment 6/20 (30%); and bilirubinuria 6/20 (30%).

All dogs were Babesia spp., and Bartonella spp. seronegative. Using the SNAP \u00d2 4Dx \u00d2 Plus test kit, 23/29 (79.3%) serum or blood samples were Ehrlichia (+), 1/29 (3.4%) was Lyme (+) and all dogs were Anaplasma antibody (-) and Dirofilaria immitis antigen (-).

This hypothesis will be tested using inferential statistics and a large diagnostic data set from IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. The cause of proliferative urethritis (PU) has not been elucidated.

Thus, SDMA is a more reliable estimate of kidney function in cats and dogs with cancer. his study investigated water intake and hydration in healthy cats and evaluated a nutrient-enriched water on hydration. Domestic shorthair cats (N = 18; mean age 9.8 yrsAESD 2.5; BCS 5-7 on 9point scale) received either tap-water (W; N = 9) or test-water containing whey protein and glycerol (TW; N = 9) for 56 days. Prior to treatment, a 7-d baseline established daily W and food consumption using a 2-bowl monitoring system with ad libitum water and dry food. Blood and urine samples were collected on days \u00c01, 8, 15, 30, and 56 for urine specific gravity (USG), creatinine, and osmolality measurements. Endogenous creatinine-based glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was calculated from sample collection on days 28-30 or 31-33. Baseline W and calorie intake were similar between groups. Although no difference was observed between groups during the treatment phase, TW group had a daily liquid increase of 52%, with a median intake across all days that ranged from 5% to 254% increase. Variance was controlled post hoc with cats characterized as responders (R:consumption >25%) and nonresponders (NR) (W: 2R/7NR versus TW: 7R/2NR; P = 0.02). Daily urine volume (mL/kg BW) was higher (P = 0.02) in TW (15.2 AE SE 1.8) versus the W treated cats (10.3 AE SE 0.7), but no difference (P = 0.60) between groups for GFR (1.8 AE SE 0.1 versus 1.9 AE SE 0.2, respectively).

Serum osmolality was similar for both groups over the entire trial. This study suggests that specific nutrients added to a cat's water can improve liquid intake to significantly improve overall hydration, as determined by greater urine output and dilution, which may offer a health benefit to some cats in need of greater water consumption. Progressive interstitial nephritis (IN) is the primary cause of feline chronic kidney disease (CKD) which affects as many as 50% of elderly cats and prevalence increases with age. Vaccination has been shown to be a risk factor for development of feline CKD. The Crandell Rees feline kidney (CRFK) cell line is commonly used to grow viruses for use in feline vaccine production. Repeated administration of a vaccine containing CRFK remnants as a model for interstitial nephritis was shown to induce strong antibody responses against CRFK lysates and against alpha-enolase, an immunodominant glycolytic pathway enzyme found in all mammalian cells that has been studied as a marker of inflammatory diseases in people. The primary objectives of this study were to further evaluate this potential model for IN by assessing samples from the cats for cell-mediated immune responses to alpha-enolase, by evaluating serum cytokine concentrations using a commercially available kit, and by describing changes in renal alpha-enolase staining patterns.",

Although there has been no direct link made between parenteral FVRCP vaccines and feline interstitial nephritis to date, results of urinary cytokines and further assessment of alpha-enolase expression within feline kidneys will be used to continue evaluation of this potential IN model. Tamm-Horsfall Protein (THP) is exclusively synthesized by the distal nephron under physiological conditions. Therefore, it is expected larger amounts of this protein in the urine of healthy individuals. In chronic kidney disease (CKD) dogs, a few investigations have reported about the quantities of THP in urine. Lower urinary excretion of THP in CKD dogs might be associated with distal tubular injuries and/or to the loss of renal mass, and then, THP may act as a marker of disease progression. The aim of this study was to assess the role of THP as a marker of CKD progression in dogs. Nine clinically healthy dogs were recruited as control group. Forty CKD dogs were enrolled (IRIS staging, Stage 1, n = 10; Stage 2, n = 10; Stage 3, n = 10; Stage 4, n = 10). Western blotting of THP was performed, and the results of densitometry were expressed in mean AE SEM. Urinary immunodetection of THP was 100.0 AE 7.7% in control dogs, and 117.2 AE 10.8%, 86.0 AE 9.0%, 65.4 AE 8.7% and 46.7 AE 9.0% in CKD dogs in stages 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. Differences among all groups were observed, particularly between Stages 1 and 4 (P \u2264 0.0001). It is likely that progressive reduction in urinary excretion of THP may contribute to detect gradual loss of nephrons, and it may act as a marker of disease progression in CKD dogs.

            "text": "A weight gain of 37% in dogs does not appear to affect most routine markers of kidney function or GFR. Increased UPC does suggest that weight gain results in higher urinary excretion of protein as seen in humans. Additionally, CEUS was able to detect differences in blood volume and velocity of the renal medulla, which may indicate that structural and functional changes may have occurred as a result of weight gain. Further studies utilizing noninvasive markers or techniques to localize abnormalities in kidney function or injury in obese dog are warranted. Additional studies are also required to evaluate whether these changes are reversible after weight loss. Fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) is a bone-derived hormone that regulates phosphorus (P) and vitamin D metabolism. It was recently shown that dogs with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have increased FGF-23 concentrations. FGF-23 increases urinary fractional excretion of phosphorus (uFEP) in order to limit increases in serum phosphorus. The phosphaturic activity of FGF-23 is based on suppression of renal P reabsorption in the proximal tubules. Recently human studies showed that uFEP/FGF-23 ratio may reflect functional nephrons and the phosphaturic actions of FGF-23, and can be used as prognostic marker of CKD. A low uFEP/FGF-23 ratio may indicate a reduction in the number of functional nephrons and/or impaired FGF-23 signaling from Klotho (co-receptor for FGF-23) expression. The goal of this study was to evaluate whether uFEP/FGF-23 ratio reflect severity of CKD and could predict prognosis of CKD dogs. Sixteen CKD dogs were followed-up for 13 months or until death (IRIS stage 2, n = 5; stage 3, n = 11). Urinary and serum phosphorus as well as serum FGF-23 were measured at the first visit. The uFEP/FGF-23 ratio was determined in fifteen healthy dogs (mean AE SEM; 0.083 AE 0.024). Normophosphatemia (3.54 AE 0.07 mg/dL; range 2.3 to 5.4 mg/dL) was detected in all CKD dogs in stage 2 most of the times during the follow-up, and hyperphosphatemia detected in 8 out of 11 dogs in stage 3 (5.68 AE 0.23 mg/dL; range 2.5 to 16.0 mg/dL). The uFEP/FGF-23 ratio was 0.027 AE 0.014 in stage 2 CKD, and 0.006 AE 0.003 in stage 3 CKD (P = 0.0122). Serum FGF-23 concentrations were higher in stage 3 and even though FGF-23 was increased, there was no increment in phosphaturia. CKD dogs in stage 3 with lower uFEP/FGF-23 ratios had a poorer prognosis. Decreased survival was predicted when uFEP/FGF-23 ratios were less than 0.006 (survival up to 300 days). The worst prognosis occurred when uFEP/FGF-23 ratio was < 0.003 (less than 130 days survival). In conclusion, a low uFEP/FGF-23 ratio associated with normal to high serum FGF-23 concentrations supports a reduction in functional nephrons and/or impaired FGF-23 signaling from renal injury since increased FGF-23 should promote sufficient phosphaturia. Evaluation of Klotho (serum, urine, renal tissue) will be valuable to this question. Studies with larger population of dogs in various IRIS CKD stages will confirm the prognostic value of uFEP/ FGF-23 in dogs with spontaneous chronic kidney disease. Alpha-enolase, a ubiquitous, glycolytic enzyme known for catalyzing the conversion of 3-phosphoglycerate to phosphoenolpyruvate, has been implicated as a self-antigen in various autoimmune diseases. Autoantibodies in serum are capable of eliciting renal injury and ultimately can contribute to patient morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, endogenous renal alpha-enolase has been shown to be overexpressed in human patients with systemic lupus nephritis and mixed cryoglobulinemia. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is common in companion animals and affects a significant proportion of geriatric cats. While antibodies against alpha-enolase have been shown to be present in sera of cats, patterns of alphaenolase protein expression in the kidney has not determined in healthy or diseased cats. The purpose of this study was to identify and characterize alpha-enolase expression in renal tissues of cats with and without CKD.",

Metoclopramide was associated with prolonged hospitalization. Its use suggested real or anticipated POI in this study. The use of prokinetics in POI is contested in human medicine: they do not consistently decrease hospitalization, though they may improve feeding tolerance. Resection and anastomosis is expected to lengthen hospitalization. The period from birth through weaning represents a critical period in puppy development. Body composition during this preweaning period has not been well-studied because sedation was previously required for analysis. Quantitative Magnetic Resonance (QMR) is a noninvasive technology that does not require anesthesia and has been validated as a method to assess body fat, lean, and total body water (TBW) in companion animals. The objective of this study was to determine if QMR can be used to measure body composition in puppies during the preweaning period. Healthy newborn puppies (Labrador retrievers and beagles; n = 16/breed) were selected for this study. Body weights were collected and QMR scans were performed on awake and unrestrained puppies within 24 hours of birth, and then at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks of age. Differences in weight, percent lean, body fat, TBW, and lean mass hydration were assessed. Body weight was higher for Labrador retrievers at all timepoints (P < 0.05). Body fat percentage was significantly higher in beagle puppies at birth, 2, 4, and 6 weeks of age (P < 0.05). Although lean mass percentage was similar between breeds at birth, Labrador retrievers had significantly higher proportion at Weeks 2 and 4 (P < 0.05). No breed differences were observed in TBW percentage at any time period, but beagles had significantly higher lean mass hydration at birth (P < 0.05). These results indicate QMR can be used to detect differences in body composition during the critical preweaning period. Further research evaluating differences in body composition among dog breeds during growth is required. A retrospective study was performed to describe the underlying diseases, clinicopathologic abnormalities and prognosis associated with hypocholesterolemia in a population of cats presenting to a tertiary referral hospital between 2004 and 2016. Case inclusion criteria were: hypocholesterolemia, physical exam, CBC, serum biochemistry and urinalysis. When available, serum total T4, retroviral tests, imaging reports and necropsy reports were reviewed. For analysis, cats were categorized according to their disease by body system or etiology: neoplastic, infectious, sterile inflammatory, hepatobiliary, cardiac, gastrointestinal, malnutrition, toxin, neurologic and unknown.",

Mycophenolic acid, the active form of mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), is effective in controlling dysregulated lymphocyte responses associated with immune-mediated diseases. This drug has been shown to be promising for the treatment of multiple autoimmune diseases in dogs and cats. In humans, dose optimization and plasma drug concentration monitoring (TDM) are recommended in order to maximize the MPA effect, particularly in patients that require sustained immunosuppression. In humans, MPA is a highly protein bound drug (~97%). It is recommended to monitor free drug plasma concentration, as the free (unbound) MPA correlates with its immunosuppressive effect. It is likely that dogs and cats would also need TDM and optimization of dosage regimens. However, the extent of MPA plasma protein binding in dogs and cats are unknown. Importantly, the extent of MPA protein binding cannot be extrapolated from other species due to inherent differences in albumin structure and drug binding capacity.",

The CD4 cell activation assay was modeled on a commercially available human assay of activated CD4 positive T cell ATP synthesis that is marketed as a non-specific test of the efficacy of immunosuppressive agents. Briefly, CD4 positive cells were magnetically sorted from PBMCs following activation with ConA, cells were lysed to release intracellular ATP, a luminescence reagent (luciferin/luciferase) activated by ATP was added, and resultant bioluminescence was measured using a luminometer. B and T cell proliferation were evaluated by measuring incorporation of tritiated thymidine via a scintillation beta-counter following activation with PWM and ConA, respectively.",

A potential phenomenon of resistance to these antiplatelet effects has been documented in people and potentially in dogs. Aspirin resistance may be a contributing factor to the development of life threatening thrombi thus increasing the rate of morbidity and mortality in several canine diseases. Understanding the phenomenon of aspirin resistance and developing methods for predicting it could lead to improvements in survival in these patients. The cause of aspirin resistance remains unclear.

A single low dose (4 mg/kg) of aspirin was not sufficient to cause measurable inhibition of platelet aggregation in all dogs and resulted in ASA concentrations that were substantially less than those used in vitro. Aspirin responsiveness in vitro did not correlate with responsiveness in vivo in this scenario. The use of EDTA fluoride anticoagulant resulted in inhibition of conversion of ASA to SA suggesting successful inhibition of esterase activity. When storing dog plasma samples containing aspirin, the use of EDTA containing fluoride may prevent esterase hydrolysis of the ASA. Further investigation into the effects of esterase activity as a cause of aspirin resistance in dogs is warranted. Sildenafil citrate, a highly selective phosphodiesterase type V inhibitor, is used to treat pulmonary hypertension (PH) in veterinary medicine. Sometimes, patients with PH experience respiratory distress, and the oral administration of any type of drug to these patients can be fatal.

This effect, however, appears to be delayed for several weeks, suggesting that MMF may not be the ideal treatment choice for dogs with severe or emergent immune-mediated diseases that require rapid immunosuppression. The mechanism for this delay in the immunosuppressive effects of MMF has not been elucidated, although another purine synthesis inhibitor, azathioprine, is also reported to have a delayed effect, the cause of which has also not yet been determined. Diarrhea was, as has been previously reported, the most common dose-limiting side effect in our study. The exact mechanism of MMF-associated diarrhea has not been determined in either humans or dogs. Interestingly, in some dogs, drug-induced diarrhea, as with drug effects on lymphocyte proliferation, appears to be delayed until after the first week of therapy. Since a lower oral dose rate (10 mg/kg bid) of MMF still causes significant suppression of lymphocyte proliferation in some dogs, without associated diarrhea, this reduced dose rate warrants exploration in future pharmacodynamic studies. The enzyme cytochrome b 5 reductase (encoded by CYB5R3) detoxifies reactive metabolites of sulfonamide antibiotics. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) CYB5R3 729A>G was recently associated with sulfonamide hypersensitivity in dogs. This synonymous coding SNP may partially explain risk for this idiosyncratic drug reaction, however, the functional significance of this variant is unknown. Based on in silico predictions, we hypothesized that the 729A>G SNP would decrease protein synthesis and total cellular cytochrome b 5 reductase activity without decreasing mRNA expression in an in vitro model. HepG2 cells were transfected with an expression vector containing either wildtype (A) or variant (G) CYB5R3 cDNA and incubated for 48 hours. Cells were harvested and CYB5R3 mRNA, protein, and function were measured with qRT-PCR, immunoblots, and cytochrome c reduction assay, respectively. There was no significant difference in protein expression between the A and G alleles. mRNA quantification and cytochrome b 5 reductase activity assays are underway. Preliminary results do not support CYB5R3 729A>G as a functional variant leading to decreased cytochrome b 5 reductase expression. However, immunoreactivity is only a semi-quantitative measure of protein expression; results of mRNA and enzyme activity assays may better inform the mechanistic significance of 729A>G SNP in sulfonamide hypersensitivity in dogs. Cyclosporine is a potent immunosuppressive agent commonly used to treat immune-mediated disorders in dogs. Cyclosporine targets T lymphocytes by decreasing cytokine expression (IL-2, IL-4 and IFN-c) of activated T cells. Unfortunately, significant complications, such as life-threatening secondary infections, can sometimes arise as a result of cyclosporine administration, necessitating cessation of therapy. Once cyclosporine is stopped, the expectation is that the patient's immune system will completely recover, and commence functioning appropriately. Currently, it is unknown how quickly the immune system and T-cell function recover following the cessation of cyclosporine therapy. The objective of this study was to utilize a pharmacodynamic bioassay to quantify the average time it takes for T-cell function to return to pre-treatment levels in healthy dogs after cessation of an immunosuppressive dose of cyclosporine.",

We hypothesized that probiotics would modulate the respiratory microbiota in healthy cats, demonstrated by the detection of the probiotic bacterial species present in fecal samples and altered \"core\" airway microbiome communities in the respiratory tract.",

The probiotic capsule resolved to the OTU level consisted of the following taxa: genus Bifidobacterium (36%), Bifidobacterium animalis (23%), genus Streptococcus (26%), Lactobacillus zeae (12%), and genus Lactobacillus (3%). B. animalis and L. zeae were not detected in any sample site at baseline. L. zeae was detected in all sites post-treatment, and B. animalis was detected in OP, BAL, and feces, but not blood. The overall composition of the upper and lower airway microbiota underwent the most changes in regards to relative abundance of predominant OTUs with 4.8% and 6.9% of OTUs changing significantly in OP and BAL samples, respectively. In contrast only 0.5% of OTUs in feces changed significantly from baseline. PCA revealed distinct microbiomes in each site; samples clustered more tightly at baseline and had more variation after probiotic administration. This is the first study describing the effect of oral probiotics on the respiratory microbiota of healthy cats. Finding bacterial species present in the oral probiotics in the upper and lower airways provides pilot data suggesting that oral probiotics could be investigated as a tool to target dysbiosis occurring in inflammatory airway diseases such as feline asthma. Histoplasmosis is a common fungal infection that has the potential to result in severe clinical disease, with the majority of cats having pulmonary involvement. The purpose of this study was to evaluate thoracic radiograph findings in cats diagnosed with histoplasmosis. Medical records of cats presenting to the Oklahoma State University VTH between 2005 and 2015 were reviewed. Cats included in the study had orthogonal thoracic radiographs performed, a complete medical record, and a definitive diagnosis of histoplasmosis based on identification of H. capsulatum, positive urine antigen, and/or positive fungal culture. A radiologist blinded to the clinical severity of each patient evaluated all radiographs to determine the predominant pulmonary pattern and severity score (0normal, 1-mild, 2-moderate, 3-severe) for each lung lobe. Fortyseven cats (27 female, 20 male) were included in the study with a median age of 7 years (range: 0.7 -19 years) of which 32 (68%) were presumed to be alive at the time of this abstract. The predominant pulmonary pattern was bronchial in 38 cats (81%) and 6 cats (13%) had a mixed pulmonary pattern (combination of bronchial, interstitial, and/or alveolar). Three cats (6%) had bilateral pleural effusion and 3 cats (6%) had normal radiographs. All lung lobes were abnormal in the majority of cats and the median severity score of all lung lobes was 2 out of 3 (moderate). Feline histoplasmosis results in pulmonary abnormalities in the majority of cats infected, and the predominant pulmonary pattern is a moderate bronchial pattern with or without an interstitial component.

There are limited non-invasive methods available to evaluate lung mechanics. We hypothesized that inspiratory to expiratory change in lung area as assessed by fluoroscopy would result in reproducible measures that could be used for future evaluation of lung function and mechanics in dogs with respiratory disease. Forty-four conscious, unsedated dogs with no evidence of respiratory disease were minimally restrained in sternal recumbency. Tidal respiration was recorded fluoroscopically for 10 respiratory cycles, and maximal inspiratory and expiratory images from 3 respiratory cycles were evaluated. The number of pixels in the entire thoracic cavity was measured for both inspiration and expiration, and the average percent change in thoracic dimension was determined for each dog. This process was repeated using a hemithorax measurement that excluded the mediastinum and cardiac silhouette. Reference ranges with 95% confidence were computed using a non-parametric percentile distribution. Median percent change in thoracic dimension for the total thorax measurement was 12.5% (confidence interval of 8.91-23.97%). Median percent change for the hemithorax measurement (20.8%) was significantly different (P < 0.001) with a larger confidence interval of 14.32-37.61%, rendering it more responsive to lung area changes. Neither measurement technique was correlated with age, sex, thoracic conformation, BCS, or breed but varied with body weight above and below 10 kg. In conclusion, fluoroscopy provides a noninvasive and reliable measure of lung area changes during respiration in small and large dogs. Further investigations of lung area changes are required in dogs with respiratory disease to assess its utility in detecting dysfunction.

Lower glucagon expression in IR horses may be a result of compensatory downregulation of hormone secretion in response to hyperinsulinemia or hyperglycemia. Insulin dysregulation (ID), specifically hyperinsulinemia, has been identified as a cause of laminitis. Certain breeds are seemingly more susceptible. Understanding breed differences in insulin responses and measures of lipid metabolism/adipokines may be critical for identifying truly \"at risk\" individuals. Insulin-modified frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance tests (FSIGTT) (N = 90) and oral sugar tests (OST) (N = 82) were performed along with assessment of markers for lipid metabolism/adipokines (N = 90) in 5 breeds (Quarter Horses (QH), Arabians, Morgans, Welsh Ponies (WP), and Thoroughbreds). Minimal model analyses of the FSIGTT for insulin sensitivity (SI), the acute insulin response to glucose (AIRg), disposition index (DI), glucose mediated glucose disposal (Sg), the lowest glucose value (Gmin), and the deflection of glucose below baseline (dGB) were assessed. OST insulin thresholds, trajectories, and area under the curve (AUC) were assessed. Statistics included: multilevel regression analysis, regression modeling of time trajectories, one-way ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis test, ROC curve analysis (significant at P < 0.05). QH had higher SI than all other breeds, lower AIRg than WP and Arabians, and higher DI than Morgans. Arabians had higher AIRg than Morgans, and lower Sg than WP. Morgans had lower AIRg than WPs. Arabians, Morgans, and WP had lower Gmins than Thoroughbreds. Morgans had a greater dGB than QHs. Different OST insulin thresholds for ID existed between breeds. OST glucose and insulin trajectories and AUC were lowest in QH. Significant breed differences existed in nonesterified fatty acids, high molecular weight adiponectin, leptin, and triglycerides. Breed specific differences are important to consider when evaluating metabolic health. Insulin dysregulation, specifically hyperinsulinemia, has been identified as a cause of laminitis. Muscle and adipose tissue have large roles in insulin regulation and in the pathology of human metabolic syndrome, but these roles have not been well interrogated in horses. Tailhead adipose tissue (N = 76) and middle gluteal muscle (N = 28) biopsies were performed (4 equine breeds: Quarter Horses (QH); Arabians, Morgans, Welsh Ponies (WP)) to relate adipocyte area (AA) and muscle fiber type percent area and proportions to body condition score (BCS), total body fat mass (TBFM) (using the deuterium dilution technique) and minimal model parameters from a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGTT). Statistics included: Kolmogorov-Smirnov analysis, MANOVA, and Spearman correlation. Significance was set at P < 0.05. Overall BCS was weakly to moderately correlated to insulin sensitivity (SI), the acute insulin response to glucose (AIRg), and AA. TBFM was not correlated to SI and weakly correlated to AIRg and AA overall, but moderately correlated to AA in QH. QH had a significantly smaller AA than Arabians and WP but not Morgans. AA was weakly related to SI and moderately to AIRg. Baseline insulin concentrations were moderately correlated to Type 1 muscle fiber percent area and proportion. No breed differences existed between muscle fiber type area or proportion. There were breed differences in adipocyte, but not muscle histology. The weak correlations between BCS, TBFM and SI and AIRg suggest that adiposity may not be a key factor in determining metabolic fitness in horses. Equine metabolic syndrome (EMS), a clustering of metabolic disturbances resulting in insulin dysregulation and derangements in fat metabolism, is the most common cause of laminitis. Previous work from our lab has confirmed that the pathophysiology of EMS is complex, with both genetic and environmental factors contributing to the phenotypic variability in metabolic traits. The objective of this project was to identify genomic regions contributing to EMS by performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS) in a cohort of 232 Welsh ponies and 286 Morgan horses phenotyped for 11 metabolic traits. Genotyping was performed on one of three SNP arrays (54,000, 670,000 to 1,800,000 SNPs); genotype imputation allowed for generation of a uniform set of makers across platforms (~1.8 million SNPs). GWAS was performed using a mixed linear regression model with sex and age included as covariates. Within breeds, a total of 67 (Welsh ponies) and 116 (Morgans) significant loci were identified for the metabolic traits, of which 4 were shared between breeds. Loci were defined as shared if SNPs with a P-value < 1.00e-05 were within a 500 kb window of each other. Specifically, shared loci were identified on ECA10, ECA18, ECA20, and ECA3 for insulin levels post oral sugar test, and baseline non-esterified fatty acids, triglycerides, and ACTH, respectively, with a total of 75 candidate genes identified. These data confirm that EMS is a polygenic trait with risk loci unique to individual breeds as well as those shared between breeds. Future directions include interrogation of these regions through whole genome sequencing. The relationship between insulin dysregulation, dietary adaptation and aging is poorly understood yet critical to making dietary recommendations for horses at risk of insulin dysregulation and associated laminitis. In this study, the effect of age and diet on insulin and glucose dynamics was examined in 16 healthy Thoroughbred and Standardbred horses, divided into two groups: Adult (8.8 AE 2.9 years; mean AE SD) and Aged (20.6 AE 2.1 years). Four concentrate isocaloric diets: Base (low starch, low sugar), Starch (base plus kibbled corn), Fiber (base plus beet pulp and soybean hulls), and Sugar (base plus dextrose powder) were each fed for seven weeks (balanced four-way crossover). Horses were group fed low non-structural carbohydrate hay once daily, and individually fed concentrate meals twice daily. In the seventh week, insulin-modified frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance tests and oral sugar tests (OST) (0.25 mL/kg corn syrup) were performed. Data were analyzed with multivariable linear mixed regression (significance set at P \u2264 0.05). Acute insulin response to glucose (AIRg), OST_peak insulin, insulin area under the curve, and OST_insulin 75 minutes were higher in Aged than Adult independent of diet. Aged had higher AIRg and disposition index on Fiber and Sugar, and glucose effectiveness on Sugar than Adults adapted to the same diet. Adults had lower OST_insulin basal on Fiber compared to Sugar. Aged horses had higher OST_peak insulin than Adults on Fiber. Age and diet had an influence on insulin and glucose dynamics, and should be considered when evaluating a horse's metabolic status. Diagnosing and managing horses with metabolic disorders including obesity is challenging due to a poorly understood pathogenesis and lack of well-characterized risk factors and therapeutic options. In other species, differences in fecal bile acids (BA), fatty acids (FA), and sterols have been recognized in metabolic disease; however, these have not been reported for horses. Thus, the objective of this study was to compare fecal BA, sterols, and FA between obese and non-obese horses.",

Hart 1 . 1 University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA, 2 College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, USA Dendritic cells (DCs) are important in the immune response to bacteria, but foal DC function is not well characterized. Monocyte-derived DCs (MoDCs) were generated from 8 foals at 1, 7 and 30 days-of-age and 9 adult horses. MoDCs were incubated for 48 hours with or without killed Escherichia coli or Staphlococcous aureus antigen in the presence or absence of cortisol (15 lg/dL). MoDC expression of MHCII, CD86, and CD14 was measured with flow cytometry, and supernatant cytokine concentrations (IL-4, IL-17, IFN-gamma, IFN-alpha, and IL-10) were quantified with a fluorescent bead-based immunoassay. Effects of age and cortisol on MoDC variables were determined with mixed-effects linear models (significance P < 0.05). The percentage of cells expressing MHCII and CD86 was lower and CD14 was higher in 1-day-oldfoal MoDCs compared to horse MoDCs (P \u2264 0.006). Bacterial exposure alone did not alter surface marker expression in foal or horse cells, but exposure to bacteria with cortisol further reduced MHCII expression in foal cells (P < 0.001). Following bacterial exposure, 1-day-old-foal MoDCs produced significantly less IL-4, IL-17, IFN-gamma, and IFN-alpha and more IL-10 than horse MoDCs (P < 0.001). Following bacterial exposure, 1-day-old-foal MoDCs produced significantly less IL-4, IL-17, IFN-gamma, and IFN-alpha and more IL-10 than horse MoDCs (P < 0.001). Foal MoDCs exhibit phenotypic and functional immaturity that persists during the first month of life and is compounded by exposure to cortisol. Thus, foal DCs may be less effective at activating lymphocyte responses, which could contribute to foals' increased susceptibility to bacterial sepsis. Pulmonary neutrophilia is a characteristic finding in severe equine asthma (SEA or heaves) and is also common in moderate equine asthma (MEA, or inflammatory airway disease).

Four horses were experimentally infected with frozen feces containing approximately 10 9 genome equivalents of ECoV/g of feces collected from the intestinal lumen of a horse diagnosed with ECoV at necropsy. Four additional horses were exposed daily to the feces from the experimentally challenged horses.

EHV-1 or EHV-4 were shed by 3.6% of horses, which could have serious consequences if such animals were introduced into a large mixed population of susceptible horses upon entry into the USA. Foals are immunologically na\u20ac \u0131ve at birth, meaning they have had no exposure to foreign antigens and have therefore not yet mounted any type of protective immune response or accumulated significant levels of immunoglobulins (Ig). Ingestion and absorption of immunoglobulin-rich colostrum are the sole means of passive transfer in foals providing temporary protection from infection for the first few months of life. Current recommendations for optimizing colostral antibody transfer from mares to foals includes vaccination of the mare 4 to 6 weeks prior to parturition. This practice has been recommended to increase the serum antibody level in the dam; therefore the mare would concentrate a higher level of Ig in colostrum during the final two weeks of gestation. Although this management practice is widely accepted, it has not been adequately substantiated using evidenced-based medicine from adequately controlled studies. The purpose of this study was to determine if vaccinating pregnant mares approximately 4 to 6 weeks prior to foaling increases the IgG antibody transferred to foals specific for West Nile Virus (WNV) and Equine Influenza Virus (EIV). Twenty-seven pregnant adult Tennessee Walking Horse (TWH) mares ranging in age from 5 to 23 years were enrolled in the study. All mares were confirmed in foal via rectal palpation and confirmed via ultrasound. Mares were randomized into three treatment groups: G0 na\u20ac \u0131ve control group (no previous vaccinations; no vaccinations administered during the study); G1 vaccinated group (initial 2 vaccination series and revaccinated 4 to 6 weeks prior to foaling); and G2 vaccinated group (initial 2 vaccination series; no pre-foaling revaccination). Mares in G1 and G2 were administered Vetera \u00d2 4XP + WNV (eastern and western encephalitis, equine influenza clades 1 and 2 + WNV) labeled safe for use in pregnant mares. Following parturition, blood was collected and processed from each foal to determine IgG levels (passive immunity) and serum aliquots frozen at \u00c080\u00b0C. Serum was shipped to Gluck Equine Research Center, Lexington, KY for measurement of serum hemagglutination-inhibiting (HI) equine influenza virus antibody levels against Kentucky/14 (Florida clade 1) and Ayrshire/13 (Florida clade 2) reference strains and samples were shipped to Cornell Animal Health Diagnostic Center, Ithaca, NY for analysis of WNV IgG antibody levels measured by ELISA. The mean antibody level was reported accompanied by standard deviation and 95% confidence intervals. Serological titer values below the quantifiable limit were reported as '< 10' and the value of 5 was substituted for these analyses, which provided a conservative estimate. The null hypothesis there was no vaccination effect was tested with a mixed model repeated measures methodology with subject as a random effect. All pairwise comparisons were reported between vaccination groups. Models were run separately for each reference strain. P values < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.",

The results of this study supports the importance and recommendation to vaccinate broodmares 4 to 6 weeks before foaling not only for their own protection, but most importantly to maximize concentrations of immunoglobulins in their colostrum to be passively transferred to their foals. The purpose of this pilot study was to determine if C-reactive protein (CRP) or serum amyloid A (SAA) increase with equine protozoal myeloencephalitis (EPM) compared to other neurologic diseases. Accurate antemortem EPM diagnosis requires evidence of intrathecal antibody production (e.g. serum:CSF SnSAG2, 4/3 titer ratio < 100). Some advocate the use of acute phase proteins in addition to serology, which alone results in substantial false positives. Serum and CSF CRP and SAA were measured in 25 cases of equine neurologic disease: EPM (10), cervical vertebral stenotic myelopathy (CVSM) (10), neuroborreliosis (2), equine motor neuron disease (1), degenerative myelopathy (1), and leukoencephalomalacia (1). Nine of 10 EPM cases had serum:CSF SnSAG2, 4/3 titer ratios \u2264 25. The untested EPM case was confirmed postmortem, as were 4 other EPM cases. Nine of the 10 CVSM cases were confirmed postmortem, and the other case had a positive myelogram and SNSAG2, 4/3 titer ratio of 200. The remaining cases were diagnosed on postmortem exam. Serum CRP was not elevated in any case. Serum SAA was only elevated in the two cases of neuroborreliosis (132 mg/L and 460 mg/L; reference 0-20 mg/L) suggesting SAA may aid its diagnosis, but further testing is warranted. Neither serum CRP nor SAA increased in cases of EPM or CVSM. Cerebrospinal fluid CRP and SAA also failed to differentiate cases of EPM (CRP median 3.35 mg/L, range 0.19-13.43 mg/L; SAA median 0.1 mg/L, range < 0.1-2.4 mg/L) from CVSM (CRP median 4.015 mg/L, range 0.16-9.62 mg/L; SAA median 0.62 mg/L, range < 0.1-2.91 mg/L). Recurrent exertional rhabdomyolysis (RER) affects 5-7% of racing Thoroughbreds, Standardbreds and potentially Quarter Horses, A genetic basis has been proposed but not substantiated. Dysregulation of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium cycling has been suggested to cause RER. We hypothesized that calcium dysregulation in RER horses could be impacted by genes encoding newly discovered micropeptides such as sarcolipin (SLN), myoregulin (MRLN), DWORF and phospholamban (PLN) that modify the activity of sarcoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase (SERCA). The purpose of this study was to determine; 1) gene expression of SLN, MRLN, DWORF and PLN in equine muscle, 2) the coding sequence of these micropeptides and 3) potential differences in their coding sequence between controls and RER Thoroughbreds, RER Standardbreds and RER Quarter Horses. Gene expression was determined in gluteal muscle from 11 horses using Next generation sequencing. Sanger sequencing of SLN, MRLN and DWORF was performed on DNA isolated from blood or muscle tissue of a minimum of 9 RER horses per gene and 9 control horses selected from the Neuromuscular Diagnostic Laboratory.",

In contrast, equine MLN had one conservative amino acid substitution, DWORF 2 non-conservative amino acid substitutions and PLN was 100% orthologous to other species.

Similarly, in STDBs, small, moderate, and large effect SNPs explain 47%, 30%, and 23% variability, respectively. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified seven genomic regions of interest (ROIs) significantly associated with RER in TB (n = 491) and STDB (n = 476) horses: two in TBs, four in STDBs, and one shared locus. Of the 274 genes within these ROIs, 34 were computationally predicted to be candidate genes for rhabdomyolysis in humans. Variants in each ROI were identified using whole genome sequences from 10 RER and 10 controls in each breed. 189,610 total variants were discovered in the ROIs, with an average of 7.5 variants per kb. Of these variants, 47.5% were within genes, and 1.1% had putative functional effects. Variants will be prioritized based on segregation between RER and control horses and predicted functional effect. High-priority variants will be used to create an assay for genotyping in the entire GWAS population. The sepsis score (SS) has been used to diagnose or assume the presence of sepsis in newborn foals over the last thirty years. However, clinical experience and recent validation studies suggest that the SS is not as accurate to predict sepsis as in the original study. Therefore, a novel scoring methodthe foal survival score (FSS) was recently developed to predict likelihood of survival in sick newborn foals. Based on sensitivity and specificity, the FSS has good ability to predict survival; however, the association of the FSS with severity of illness remains to be determined. The lower the FSS the more likely is the foal to die. High SS indicates severe disease.

This study revealed that 10 days of valacyclovir treatment did not significantly alter viral kinetics of EHV-5 as measured by qPCR in nasal swabs, blood and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples. Exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH) is diagnosed and severity assessed by post-exercise tracheobronchoscopic examination (TBE), and/or enumeration of erythrocytes (RBCs) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). TBE EIPH scores range from 0 to 4, 0 indicating no EIPH. BALF RBC < 1000/lL indicates no EIPH. There is scant information regarding the relationship of TBE EIPH score to BALF RBC number. We hypothesized that BALF RBC was weakly correlated (r 2 < 0.20) with TBE score. TBE followed by BAL was performed 223 times on 151 different horses after treadmill (8 horses, 45 runs), racetrack (6 horses, 24 runs), or barrel racing (143 horses, 155 runs) exercise. TBE EIPH score ranged from 0 (n = 83) to 4 (n = 5). RBC number ranged from 0 to 994,000/lL. Eleven TBE scores were 0 despite RBC count > 1000/lL. There were 61 exams with TBE scores \u2265 1 but BALF RBC counts < 1000/lL. The relationship between TBE score and BALF RBC number was significant but weak (P < 0.001; r 2 = 0.19) after Spearman's evaluation. TBE EIPH score was weakly correlated with BALF RBC number and there were large ranges of BALF RBCs associated with each TBE score. An EIPH score of 0 does not rule out the occurrence of EIPH, but neither does a BALF RBC count < 1000/lL. The latter finding was unexpected and may be explained by fast clearance of the respiratory tract or lavage of an airway segment other than the one bleeding. The possibility of technical errors counting RBCs in some samples cannot be discounted. Exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH) refers to presence of blood in the airways caused by strenuous exercise. It has been documented in racing, polo and eventing horses, but little is known about EIPH in barrel racing horses. The purpose of this study was to test for the presence of EIPH in barrel racing horses, estimate its prevalence in the Pacific Northwest and determine whether a relationship between EIPH and performance exists.",

To our knowledge there is no data describing a population of competition ready Draft horses. Our objective was to determine the prevalence of silent cardiac arrhythmias in a population of Draft horses. A convenience sample of 245 Draft horses was studied at the 2015 Michigan Great Lakes International Draft Horse Show. Information gathered on each horse included signalment, history of poor performance, upper airway noise, myopathy, and cardiac arrhythmias or murmurs. All horses were auscultated on each side of the thorax for 30 seconds. A 30-second electrocardiographic (ECG) recording was then taken using a handheld recording device that transmitted to a smart phone (AliveCor \u00d2 ). ECG recordings were evaluated for rhythm and heart rate, P-R interval, and R-R interval were measured. The study population included 82 Percherons, 69 Belgians, 69 Clydesdales, 11 Belgian mules, 8 Shires, and 5 Percheron mules. Arrhythmias were found in four horses: atrial fibrillation (1), ventricular premature depolarizations (1), second degree atrioventricular block (2). None of these horses had a history of poor performance or known cardiac arrhythmias. We concluded that the prevalence of silent arrhythmias in well-conditioned, competitive Draft horses is low (2/245; 0.8%).",

Cortisol was extracted into methanol from ground hair and quantified using ELISA. HCC in mane samples from broodmares was greater than in tail samples. In all studied groups, segments further away from the hair root contained lower HCC. The decrease in hair cortisol concentrations between 1 and 2-months post-castration was significantly lower in castrated males than intact females. Cortisol accumulation in the month after castration could explain the significantly smaller decrease in HCC concentrations in males than females during the same time period.

Our group has demonstrated that up to 49% of Equine Metabolic Syndrome (EMS) phenotypic variability is explained by shared environment; however only 4-18% of this environmental variability is explained by diet, exercise and season, suggesting other environmental factors play a role in EMS.

Mean (range) ER-EDC concentrations were 279.66 (4.35-15,000) pg/mL plasma. EDCs were below the detection limit in approximately half of the horses. AICc statistics were used to determine the best linear multivariable regression model for EDC association with 9 EMS phenotypic variables. ER-EDC was associated with glucose after an oral sugar test (OST), glucose, insulin and insulin-OST. Overall, these results suggest that some of the unexplained environmental variance in individuals with EMS is due to EDC exposure, which is mediated in part through the estrogen and arylhydrocarbon receptors. Pituitary Pars Intermedia Dysfunction (PPID) has been described as one of the most common diseases of horses and ponies 15 years of age and older. Recently, the clinical signs of PPID have been divided into early and advanced clinical signs. Establishing a diagnosis of PPID in horses with early clinical signs is currently a difficult challenge facing equine veterinarians. Particularly difficult may be the diagnosis of horses with PPID in the equine athlete. Many of the same clinical signs identified in early or advanced PPID may be recognized in the sport horse along with tendon or suspensory ligament degeneration. Suspensory ligament injuries have been considered a common cause of lameness, in the equine athlete involved in competitive events. A recent histopathological study concluded that an association exists between PPID and suspensory ligament (SL) degeneration. The objective of this study was to identify the most common clinical signs associated with PPID in the sport horse. Sport horses >10 years of age, any breed, and sex were eligible for study enrollment as long as they were documented to be exhibiting one or more of the early or advanced clinical signs of PPID including suspensory ligament desmitis. Forty-nine horses were evaluated and included in the final data analysis with at least one clinical sign of early or advanced PPID. Demographic data, signalment, and a physical examination was conducted and each horse was tested for PPID using the TRH stimulation test measuring ACTH at 0 (T0ACTH) and 10 (T10ACTH) min. Insulin and glucose levels were also determined. Normal horses were excluded from the study. Blood samples were shipped overnight to the Animal Health Diagnostic Center, Cornell University, Ithaca, NY for analysis. The association between PPID status, based on ACTH and insulin results, and each of the demographic variables (age, sex, and breed), clinical signs, the two test result variables insulin and glucose were statistically evaluated individually using the Pearson chi-square test.

Veterinarians should include PPID in the list of differential diagnoses when examining sport horses with suspensory desmitis along with early and advanced clinical signs of PPID. To assess measurement of prolactin (PRL) concentration as a screening test for PPID, serum PRL concentration was compared between 31 horses that were enrolled in and 26 horses that failed inclusion criteria for the clinical efficacy study for pergolide. Enrollment required horses to have a hypertrichosis score \u22651 and either an elevated plasma ACTH concentration (\u2265 50 pg/mL) or abnormal overnight dexamethasone suppression test results. PRL was measured again after 3 and 6 months of treatment with pergolide in the horses enrolled in the study. PRL concentrations were compared by rank sum analysis and an ANOVA on ranks for repeated measures. A ROC curve was constructed to assess sensitivity and specificity of PRL at various cut-off values as a screening test for PPID. PRL was greater (P = 0.02) in enrolled (7.0 AE 8.2 ng/mL, mean AE SD) as compared to excluded (4.3 AE 2.6 ng/mL) horses. Area under the ROC curve was 0.68 (95% CI: 0.55-0.80).

In this cohort of horses, measurement of PRL did not appear to be a useful screening tool for PPID. Further, treatment of PPID-affected horses with pergolide did not decrease PRL. Pituitary pars intermedia dysfunction (PPID) has been considered the most common endocrinologic disorder of aged horses. The diagnosis of PPID is typical based on history, clinical signs and demonstration of endocrinologic dysfunction via diagnostic assay results. The most common diagnostic test utilized by veterinary practitioners for the diagnosis of PPID is currently measurement of basal plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) concentration. Determination of resting plasma ACTH concentration has been the most practical diagnostic test for PPID likely due to the ease of collection and the availability of seasonal reference ranges that allow for testing any time of the year. Multiple recommendations exist concerning the in vitro stability of ACTH. Most all recommendations state samples should be chilled promptly after collection. Multiple recommendations exist for the timing of centrifugation of chilled samples from sample collection. In the US, a discordance exists between laboratory recommendations concerning centrifugation time from sample collection; anywhere from 2 hours up to 4 hours from sample collection. Realistically, many equine ambulatory practitioners do not have the ability to centrifuge the sample within 2 to 4 hours. Based on this dilemma, the purpose of this study was to determine the stability of ACTH levels in blood samples with increasing duration from collection prior to centrifugation.",

In conclusion, dexamethasone administration appeared to suppress plasma ACTH concentrations for up to 36 hours and serum cortisol concentrations for at least 48 hours in healthy horses and horses affected by PPID. Studies with larger sample sizes may better distinguish differences in the response of the endocrine axis to dexamethasone treatment in healthy horses compared to horses with PPID. Inflammation is key in the development of post-operative ileus (POI) in rodents, with a similar pathogenesis likely occurring in other species. It is well established that dexamethasone reduces inflammation and therefore may reduce POI in horses. A retrospective study was performed to determine if dexamethasone reduces POI in horses with small intestinal (SI) disease, and to assess effects on incisional health and short-term survival. Data from all horses that underwent SI colic surgery and received 0.1 mg/kg dexamethasone intravenously during surgery (DEX) was extracted from clinical records (61 horses).

The null hypotheses were that PUL-042 would not increase the killing capacity of MDMs against either strain of R. equi and that PUL-042 would not have a synergistic effect on the killing capacity of MDMs when combined with clarithromycin.",

The CFUs were also determined at 48 hours post-infection (T48) with 1 of 4 treatments: no treatment (negative control), PUL-042 alone (PUL), clarithromycin alone (CLR), or a combination of PUL-042 and clarithromycin (PULC). The percentage of CFU reduction was determined by calculating the ratio of CFUs between T48 and T0 for each treatment and multiplying by 100%. Results showed that phagocytosis varied significantly (P < 0.05) among horses. Additionally, there was no significant difference in phagocytosis (i.e., T0 CFU) between strains (P = 0.27). For both macrolide-susceptible and macrolide-resistant R. equi, treatment with CLR or PULC had marked and significant (P < 0.05) reduction of CFU relative to either negative control or treatment with PUL; for both strains, there were no differences between control and PUL or between CLR and PULC.

Current surgical techniques for cervical stabilization are technically challenging and can result in significant complications. Also, they rely solely on compression and do not provide stabilization in tension, which can result in micromotion, potential catastrophic failure, and implant migration. Here we evaluated a novel technique for cervical vertebral interbody fusion in 6 horses with cervical vertebral compressive myelopathy (CVCM). Six horses diagnosed with CVCM with pre-operative ataxia grades ranging from 2-4/5 on the modified Mayhew scale underwent this novel approach. Two horses were compressed at 1 site and 4 were compressed at 2 sites (Table) . The surgical procedure consisted of creation of an intervertebral disc-space defect and placement of an intervertebral fusion device (IFD), 4 titanium polyaxial pedicle screws and 2 connecting rods secured with set-screws ( Figure) . All horses were re-evaluated at 7 days, 6 months, and 1-year postoperative. The procedures were approved by the Colorado State University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Surgery was performed safely and post-operative radiographs showed good placement of all IFDs, screws and rods in all horses. No implant failure or IFD displacement occurred up to 1-year post-operative. All horses improved within 3 months and by 1-year post-operative ataxia had reduced by 1-2 grades. The use of this novel fusion system requires less disc space removal, provides stabilization in compression and tension, and was technically straight-forward to perform. Surgery was performed successfully with improvement of clinical signs in all horses. This technique is a promising alternative to current surgical procedures for treatment of CVCM. Neuronavigation-guided intracranial surgery is increasingly common in veterinary medicine, although its use has not yet been described in equine species. The objective of this study was to determine the accuracy of neuronavigation-guided intracranial procedures in the horse using a standard fiducial array compared to anatomic landmarks for patient registration. Six equine cadaver heads were used for the study. CT images of each specimen were acquired, with the fiducial array rigidly secured to the frontal bone. Six targets were selected in each specimen. Patient registration was performed separately for 3 targets using the fiducial array, and 3 targets using anatomic landmarks. In lieu of biopsy, 22-gauge wire seeds were placed at each targeted site. Postoperative images were coregistered with the planning scan to calculate offset from the tip of the seed to the target. No statistical difference in accuracy between registration techniques was identified. The impact of surgeon experience was examined separately for each technique using a two-sample t-test and the experienced surgeon was significantly more accurate (1.35 mm, SD 0.69) than novice surgeons (4.04 mm, SD 1.78) using the fiducial array (P < 0.01). Although not statistically significant (P = 0.41), for the experienced surgeon the mean distance to target was smaller when registering with the fiducial array (1.35 mm) than natural landmarks (2.24 mm). In conclusion, surgeon experience impacts degree of accuracy. Data also suggest that registration using anatomic landmarks is feasible, but perhaps should be reserved for cases where a separate planning scan with fiducials cannot be performed.",

Respiratory burst was evaluated by chemoluminescence induced by opsonized zymosan in neutrophils. Luminol-emitted luminescence was measured at 37\u00b0C for 3 hours using a luminometer. The Different concentrations of TX and its combination with selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM) were evaluated (TX 0.5; 1; 2.5; 5; 7.5; 10; 15 and 20 lM; ICI 182,780 [high affinity estrogen receptor antagonist] 1, 10 and 100 nM; G15 [selective G-protein estrogen receptor antagonist] 1, 10 and 100 nM; b-estradiol 1, 10 and 100 nM; G1 [selective G-protein estrogen receptor agonist] 1, 10 and 100 nM; ICI 100 nM + TX 11.5 lM; G15 100 nM + TX 11.5 lM; b-estradiol 100 nM + TX 11.5 lM; and G1 100 nM + TX 11.5 lM). Phosphatidylserine expression was quantified by flow cytometry using a commercial Annexin V-FITC kit (BD Biosciences). Cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidity chamber (CO 2 5%) for 20 minutes with: DMSO 0.1% (vehicle), TX 11.5 lM,; b-estradiol 100 nM; ICI 100 nM; G15 100 nM and G1 100 nM. Results showed that TX inhibits neutrophil respiratory burst induced by opsonized zymosan in a dose dependent manner. Nuclear (17-b-Estradiol) and GPR30 cell membrane (G1) estrogen receptor agonists and their antagonists (ICI 182,780 and G15 respectively) do not block nor reproduce TX 0 s effect. Thus, TX does not inhibit respiratory burst through estrogen receptors. TX 11.5 lM also produced an increase in phosphatidylserine translocation, which was not observed with any of the SERM used. This shows a direct pro-apoptotic effect on neutrophils. In conclusion, TX 0 s inhibitory and pro-apoptotic effect on neutrophils seems to be independent of estrogen receptors. We hypothesized that magnesium sulfate (MgS0 4 ) has bronchodilator effects in severe asthmatic horses and potentiates the effects of inhaled salbutamol.",

Medical therapy alone has a high rate of recurrence, while surgical options can be costly and typically require general anesthesia in an already compromised patient.

More research is needed to determine the impacts of physiological differences and disease on the distribution and efficacy of commonly used drugs in neonatal calves. The objective of this project was to describe the ecology of host-adapted Staphylococcus spp. on the teat and inguinal skin of dairy heifers. A cross-sectional study including Holstein heifers (n = 106) at the University of Missouri Foremost Dairy was conducted. Heifers were randomly selected based on housing type and age group and enrolled in the following groups; preweaned heifers (n = 22), weaned heifers age 2-6 months (n = 15), young pasture raised heifers age 6-13 months (n = 26), pasture raised heifers age 13-18 months (n = 22), and breeding age heifers \u02c318 months (n = 21). Body site swabbing samples, which included a composite sample of all four teats and a second composite sample from the inguinal regions of each heifer, were collected. Swabbing samples were mixed with 10 mL of sterile saline, agitated, and plated on mannitol salt agar and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h. Up to 10 staphylococcal colonies, including at least one of each morphologically distinct colony type, were saved for analysis. Staphylococcal isolates were speciated using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight (MALDI-ToF) mass spectrometry or PCR amplification and sequencing of the rpoB or tuf gene. The Chi square or Fisher's exact test (as applicable) was used to investigate whether the prevalence of each staphylococcal species differed between the inguinal and teat region. Logistic regression models were used to investigate the relationship between heifer's age (continuous variable) and the probability of having a given body site colonized with a certain staphylococcal species.",

Of the 2,042 isolates, 1,359 were eliminated from the data analysis due to replication of a single species on the same body site, leaving 683 isolates. A total of 17 different staphylococcal species were identified. Staphylococcus aureus was more prevalent on teat skin than in the inguinal region (P < 0.01). All other staphylococcal species were equally distributed between the teat and inguinal region. For most species, colonization of the inguinal and teat region was associated with age of the heifer. Staphylococcus equorum, Staphylococcus lentus, Staphylococcus sciuri, and Staphylococcus vitulinus were more likely to be found on younger heifers, while Staphylococcus chromogenes, Staphylococcus devriesei, and Staphylococcus haemolyticus were more likely to be found on the older heifers. A diverse population of staphylococcal species was found on the teat and inguinal region of heifers, and staphylococcal populations tended to change with age. Some important host-adapted species frequently associated with intramammary infection, e.g. S. chromogenes, become more prevalent with age. Stress can negatively impact the health and productivity of lactating dairy cattle. The primary objective of this study was to determine the degree of stress experienced by dairy cattle around calving, and whether primiparous cattle were more stressed than multiparous cattle in the periparturient period.",

Quarter foremilk samples were collected from 117 dairy cows at dry-off. Quarter SCC was measured using Delaval \u00d2 cell counter (reference method; IMI=SCC>200,000 cells/mL), CMT, Somaticell \u00d2 , and three PortaSCC \u00d2 tests. Spearman correlation coefficient, area under the receiver operating curve (AUC), and kappa coefficient (j) were calculated. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Compared to the reference method, CMT had the highest correlation (rs=0.89), and at optimal cut-point (score \u2265 trace), AUC=0.88 and j=0.77. PortaSCC \u00d2 color test was the second best performing test (rs=0.82), but required 45 minutes to produce a result, and at the optimal cut-point (50,098 SCC/mL), AUC=0.91 and j=0.74. PortaSCC \u00d2 quick test was the third best performing test (rs=0.80), and at the optimal cut-point (54,482 SCC/mL",

The data obtained are in agreement with the literature that reveals CVHD and congenital anomalies as the most frequent cardiopathies. The significant decrease in the prevalence of CMD may be caused by despopularization of the breeds predisposed to DCM, while the increase of cardiac base neoplasias may be theorized by the improvement in canine nutritional management increasing survival of companion animals.

Agitation of the animals in each situation was also considered, in order to correlate it to different evaluators and anatomical cuff positions. For this purpose, 36 dogs, males and females, up to 20 kg were used. Each patient had their SBP measured by Doppler method by three evaluators, both on the left forelimb as the tail, in randomly selected order. Each evaluator classified the animal as calm or agitated. The results showed no difference in SBP measured between forelimb (136.8 AE 26.37, P = 0.3549) and tail (133.2 AE 25.64, P = 0.3062), with concordance between the anatomical positions. Measures obtained between evaluators with different degrees of experience did not differ (Forelimb: AE 24.44, P = 0.1257; evaluator C: 138.8 AE 31.14, P = 0.1322. Tail: evaluator A: 132.9 AE 28.33, P = 0.5157; evaluator B: P = 0.6715). Agitation of patients did not change between the anatomical positions and evaluators. SBP values and agitation decreased as the dogs get used to the measurements in forelimb. It was concluded that the measurement of SBP by Doppler method can be performed reliably in both forelimb and tail, and adequate instruction is enough to examiners measured precisely SBP.C41 EFFECTS OF ANTI-INFLAMMATORY GLUCOCORTICOIDS ON HEMODYNAMICS AND CARDIAC FUNCTION IN CLIN-ICALLY HEALTHY DOGS.

The objective of this study was to identify clinicopathologic features, treatment and outcome of horses with eosinophilic peritonitis.A retrospective study of medical records at the Veterinary Medical Teaching Hospital, University of California, Davis identified 8 horses with \u226510000/lL total nucleated cell count and \u22651000 eosinophils/lL in abdominal fluid samples.Arabians were overrepresented (P = 0.01, OR 8.6 [CI: 2.1-34.4]). The most common presenting complaint was colic (6/8). The median peritoneal total nucleated cell and eosinophil counts were 21,040/lL (range 10,000-75,000/lL) and 3786 cells/lL (range 1329-35,343/lL), respectively. Peritoneal fluid total protein concentration was increased (median 4.5, range 2.3-6.7 g/dL). All horses had peripheral eosinophilia (964, range 540-3144 cells/lL). Abdominal ultrasonography revealed gastrointestinal thickening (5/5) and lymphadenopathy (4/5). Microscopic evidence of eosinophilic infiltration of abdominal organs was present (5/6). Quantitative fecal egg counts were negative in 5/6 horses.Treatment included anthelmintics (8/8), antimicrobials (7/8), corticosteroids (4/8), flunixin meglumine (3/8) and cetirizine (1/8).All horses were discharged. Two horses were euthanized for colic 1 and 9 months after discharge. Five horses were alive at follow up (2-24 months). Horses treated with corticosteroids with serial abdominocenteses and CBC had improvement of the peritonitis and eosinophilia (3/3). Only 1/3 horses not treated with corticosteroids with serial abdominocenteses had improvement in abdominal counts, and 2/2 did not have improvement of eosinophilia.",

There is one FDA-approved omeprazole product (GastroGard \u00d2 ) for the treatment of gastric ulcers in horses. Lack of FDA-oversight can lead to undetermined and unregulated production quality. The objective of this study was to compare the production quality of compounded and illegally manufactured omeprazole products compared to GastroGard \u00d2 paste.Syringes of compounded omeprazole paste from 5 pharmacies, 8 illegally manufactured over-the-counter omeprazole products and 2 syringes of GastroGard \u00d2 were acquired. Syringes were radiographed using digital radiographic equipment, labelled to ensure specimen identity in the film. Syringe fill, air pocket presence and product consistency were evaluated. Results were reported using qualitative descriptors for levels of syringe fill and product consistency.All compounded and over the counter products had incomplete fill and air pockets clearly visible.
