We conducted a prospective study to figure out the viral epidemiology of bronchiolitis in Taiwan. Materials and methods: From January 2009 to March 2011, a total of 113 children with bronchiolitis, aged <2 years, hospitalized in Chang Gung Children's Hospital were randomly selected for viral etiology investigation. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained from each case and sent for viral detection by tissue culture, antigen test, and polymerase chain reaction. Results: A total of 120 viruses were detected from 113 children. Positive viral etiology was identified in 86 (76%) children. Mixed viral pathogens were found in 28 cases (25%). Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) was the most common pathogen and was identified in 43.4% of the cases. Human bocavirus (hBoV) was the second most common identified virus (in 19.5%), followed by human metapneumovirus (hMPV), rhinovirus, influenza viruses, and coronavirus OC43. In terms of clinical characteristics, no significant difference was found among the children with bronchiolitis either caused by different single or mixed viral infection. Conclusion: RSV was the most common etiologic agent for children with bronchiolitis in Taiwan. Newly identified viruses, including hMPV and hBoV, were also among the common causative agents. Clinical characteristics were not significantly different among the children with bronchiolitis caused by different viruses.",

It is characterized by acute inflammation, edema, and necrosis of epithelial cells lining small airways; increased mucus production; and bronchospasm. Clinical symptoms and signs of bronchiolitis typically include rhinitis, tachypnea, wheezing, cough, crackles, use of accessory muscles, and/or nasal flaring. 1, 2 With the development of molecular techniques and the availability of monoclonal antibodies for numerous viral species, detection of viral respiratory agents has been markedly improved in the past decades. These advances allowed re-evaluation of the role of various respiratory viruses in the pathogenesis of acute bronchiolitis. However, it is not infrequently seen that no causative agent can be identified in patients with bronchiolitis.",

            "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive viral etiology study of hospitalized pediatric patients with bronchiolitis, including newly identified respiratory viruses, in Taiwan. Results from the present study showed that RSV, hMPV, and hBoV were the most common viral pathogens for acute lower respiratory tract infection among hospitalized children, less than 2 years of age, in northern Taiwan.We demonstrated again that RSV remained the major pathogen in infants with bronchiolitis. 5,7 By thecombination of virus isolation and antigen test, RSV was detected in 43% of the patients in the current study. RSV bronchiolitis followed the biennial seasonal pattern of Taiwan, with peaks during the spring and the fall (April 2009, March 2010, and November 2010), which were consistent with those previously reported from Taiwan. 8 This this study was strengthened by the use of RT-PCR assays in combination with virus culture and immunofluorescent assay to detect respiratory viruses, including the newly identified viruses (hMPV, hBoV, and hCoV-NL63) and other viruses (RV, hCoV-OC43, and hCoV-229E), which may be responsible for bronchiolitis but not identified by routine virus tissue culture. With these technologies, we were allowed to detect up to 15 different viruses (groups) and could also explain a higher viral detection rate (79%) in the present study. In 57% of the patients, viruses other than RSV were identified; after RSV, the most frequently detected viruses included hBoV, hMPV, and RV. The prevalence rate for hBoV (16.7%) was the highest so far reported among infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis. 6, 9, 10 Calvo et alreported an incidence rate of 11.4% for hBoV detection and Midulla et al a rate of 12.2%. The role of these respiratory agents in causing single or multiple viral infections in bronchiolitis has not yet been thoroughly studied. These findings suggest that many other respiratory viruses, in addition to RSV, may also cause acute bronchiolitis.",

However, a trend related to older age in hBoVinfected children than in RSV-infected was observed in previous studies. 6, 10, 11 The proportion of RV infections (12.4%) in Taiwan is slightly lower than that reported from the USA (16%) and Spain (17.4%), 6,12 but higher than that from Italy (8.8%). 10 The prevalence rate of hMPV (14.4%) in this study was higher than in most previous reports (1.7e9%), 6,10,12 except in the report byXepapadaki et al 13 (16%) .",
