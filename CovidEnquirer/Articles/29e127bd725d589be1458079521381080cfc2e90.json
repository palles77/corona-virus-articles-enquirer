The phenylurea compound EDU (N-[2-(2-oxo-1-imidazolindinyl)ethyl]-N '-phenylurea) has been shown to protect plants from the damaging effects of ozone exposure. Models of rat lung injury, based on acute exposure to 2 ppm ozone for 3 hr and on exposure to 0.85 ppm ozone for 2 days, were used to determine whether EDU pretreatment of rats protected lungs from oxidant injury. Rats were pretreated with 100 mg/kg body wt EDU by ip administration for 2 days prior to and on the days of ozone exposure. No adverse toxicological effects of EDU pretreatment were observed. Lung superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activities were significantly enhanced from 636 to 882 U/ lung and from 599 to 856 U/lung, respectively. One day following acute exposure (2 ppm for 3 hr), an ozone-induced increase of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) from 0.01 to 1.18 million cells/lung was decreased to 0.68 million by EDU pretreatment. No alteration occurred in the degree of lung permeability indicated by increased lavage fluid albumin. EDU pretreatment also significantly decreased ozone-induced increases in PMN recovery after 2 days exposure to 0.85 ppm ozone from 5.54 to 2.12 million cells/lung. However, in this second case, EDU pretreatment reduced the observed ozone damage, indicated by a decrease in lavage fluid albumin and by a decrease in the macrophage and lymphocyte infiltration associated with this length of ozone exposure. The observation that EDU-treated cultured pulmonary arterial endothelial cells increased SOD and CAT activities identified a potential lung site of EDU interaction. These data demonstrated that although EDU pretreatment appears not to prevent initial ozone damage, it does reduce the infiltration of PMNs and might therefore prevent amplification of the injury associated with this cell type.

This increase in lavageable PMNs has previously been shown to be proportional to the length of ozone exposure and is associated with increased levels of lavage fluid albumin that are maximal at this 24-hr time point (Bassett et al., 1988a ). The second model involved studying the effects of EDU pretreatment on lung inflammatory responses over a longer time period of ozone exposure when both macrophages and PMNs are still infiltrating into the lung (Bassett et al., 1988b) and bronchiolar and alveolar epithelia are undergoing proliferative repair (Evans et al., 1976a,b) .

The animals remained in the chambers in sepa-rate stainless-steel wire cages with free access to food and water during and following exposures. The air flow to the chambers was adjusted to give at least 20 changes per hour, a relative humidity of 50-654, and a temperature of 20-25\u00b0C.

Bronchoalwolar lungs. Tracheas of anesthetized rats (sodium pentobarbital. 50 mgikg body wt. ip) were cannukdted. The chest cavity was opened and exsanguinated via abdominal arteries. The lungs were then gently lavaged with a single 7.5 ml vol ofwarm (37\u00b0C) phosphatcbuffered saline without Ca\" and Mg\" (PBS). The 101. ume of lavage fluid recovered was recorded and wa\\ found not to be affected by the ozone exposures used in this study. giving a mean value of 6.3 t 0. I ml (tSl,M n = 64). Cells and debris were separated by centrifugation and the resulting supematant was lyophilized and then analyzed for albumin content by standard assay procedure based on its color reaction with bromocresol green (Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO) that is read at 630 nm (Rodkey, 1965) . The recovery of cells was continued by additional lavages of the lung, employing a total volume of 50 ml of PBS containing 3 mM EDTA. Cells were separated from the lavage fluid by centrifugation and were then combined with the pelleted cells from the first lavage. The number oftotal cells recovered by lavage and the percentage of differential cell counts were then determined by standard procedures (Warrand Jakab, 1983) .",

A greater degree of lung damage was achieved with this ozone exposure protocol as indicated by a 17.5-fold increase in lavage fluid albumin recovered from the lungs of ozone-exposed control rats (Table 2 ). In contrast to the acute ozone studies, EDU pretreatment reduced the ozone-induced increase in lavage fluid albumin by 56% (Table 2 ). These data indicate that EDU pretreatment provided some protection against the greater degree of lung damage associated with this longer exposure to ozone. This greater than threefold enhancement was accounted for by increases in all cell types recovered. Macrophage numbers were significantly elevated by 2 17% (Fig. 3) . The appearance of 5.5 million PMNs in ozone-exposed lungs accounted for 44% of the total cells recovered, which compared with a value of less than 2% for air-exposed control rat lungs (Fig. 3B ). Lymphocytes were also elevated b\\ 450% following ozone exposure (Fig. 3C) . Although EDU pretreatment increased the total number of lavageable cells recovered as macrophages from unexposed lungs ( Table 2, Fig.  3A ), statistical analysis demonstrated this increase not to be significant (P > 0.05). On the other hand, EDU prerreatment did significantly prevent the increase in total numbers of cells associated with the ozone exposure (Table 2) . EDU decreased the number of PMNs recovered from ozone-exposed lungs by 62% and prevented the ozone-induced increases in lavaged macrophages and lymphocytes (Fig. 3) .",

The involvement of reactive oxygen intermediates in the adherence and subsequent migration of PMNs is suggested by the observation that hyperoxic exposure of cultured endothelial cells (Bowman et al., 1983) and perfused rabbit lungs (Krieger et al., 1985) increase adherence of PMNs. It is therefore possible that increased endothelial SOD and CAT activities decrease both endogenous and inflammatory cell productions of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide and so decrease PMN adherence and subsequent infiltration. It should be noted that the numbers of lavageable macrophages are diminished during the initial stages of lung ozone exposure (Fig. 2) (Bassett et al., 1988a , Coffin et al., 1968 . These cells, together with epithelial cells, represent possible sources of chemotaxins that initially call in the PMNs (Fox et al., 198 1) . EDU-induced increases in SOD and CAT activities of these resident lung cells might therefore alter the chemotactic responses that initiate infiltration of the circulating PMNs, macrophages, and lymphocytes.",

However, in the present acute exposure studies where rats were exposed for 3 hr to 2 ppm ozone, the observed EDU-induced decrease in PMN infiltration could not be correlated with any decrease in lavage fluid albumin. This observed permeability damage could therefore only be attributed to the direct interaction of ozone with lung tissue components and not to any contribution by the infiltrating PMNs. In contrast. the greater degree of permeability damage associated with 2 days of continuous exposure to 0.85 ppm ozone was diminished by EDU pretreatment and could also be correlated with decreases in both macrophage and PMN content of the lungs (Fig. 3 , Table  2 ). This latter observation suggests that these inflammatory cells are contributing to the observed lung damage during the prolonged exposures to ozone. The degree of PMN infiltration associated with the acute ozone exposures might therefore have been insufficient to differentiate between ozone and possible inflammatory cell-mediated damage. On the other hand, inflammatory cells are constantly infiltrating into the lungs of rats during the first 3 days of continuous exposure to 0.85 ppm ozone (Bassett et al.. 1988b) . Their oxidant-generating capacity might make a considerable contribution to the permeability damage observed after 2 days of ozone exposure, especially if they are maintained in an activated state. EDU pretreatment might therefore reduce the lung permeability damage associated with these prolonged ozone exposures, by decreasing inflammatory cell infiltration, and so diminish the exposure of the lung to reactive oxidant metabolites (Fox ('I ul., 1984; Repine, 1985; Shasby et al., 1982) .",
