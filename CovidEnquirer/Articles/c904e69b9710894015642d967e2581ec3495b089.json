COPD exacerbations are associated with increased airway and systemic infl ammation and physiological changes, especially the development of hyperinfl ation. They are triggered mainly by respiratory viruses and bacteria, which infect the lower airway and increase airway infl ammation. Some patients are particularly susceptible to exacerbations, and show worse health status and faster disease progression than those who have infrequent exacerbations. Several pharmacological interventions are eff ective for the reduction of exacerbation frequency and severity in COPD such as inhaled steroids, long-acting bronchodilators, and their combinations. Non-pharmacological therapies such as pulmonary rehabilitation, self-management, and home ventilatory support are becoming increasingly important, but still need to be studied in controlled trials. The future of exacerbation prevention is in assessment of optimum combinations of pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies that will result in improvement of health status, and reduction of hospital admission and mortality associated with COPD.",

An audit of hospital admissions showed that around 30% of patients presenting with an index exacerbation will be seen again and possibly readmitted with another (or recurrent) event within 8 weeks. 4 In a cohort of patients with moderate to severe COPD followed-up after exacerbation, 22% had a recurrent event within 50 days of the fi rst (index) exacerbation. Thus, such events are complex, and an initial exacerbation seems to increase susceptibility to a subsequent one. 5",

Additionally, many COPD exacerbations are not reported to health-care professionals and are either self-treated or left untreated. 1 The latest GOLD guidelines also indicate that exacerbations can be self-limiting, especially if of mild severity, and the phrase \"may warrant a change in regular medication\" has been incorporated. 7 However, health-care use can be used to defi ne exacerbation severity: often defi ned as mild if increases in regular inhaled medication are needed, moderate if courses of steroids or antibiotics are needed, and severe if the patient requires hospital admission.",

Thus we largely selected publications in the past 10 years but did not exclude commonly referenced and highly regarded older publications. We also searched the reference lists of articles identifi ed by this search strategy and selected those we judged relevant. Decisions to include specifi c references were based on authors' knowledge of published work, participation in expert meetings, and many years of research on the subject. Thus, this work is not an exhaustive systematic review of the burden and prevention of COPD exacerbations. However, it is an overview of current thinking on the importance of COPD exacerbations and how to prevent them based on research evidence and clinical practice. an exacerbation. Hurst and colleagues 8 did a large study of plasma biomarkers for COPD exacerbations, with 36 candidate molecules assessed in paired baseline and exacerbation plasma samples, and tested against a standard defi nition, meeting both health-care use and symptom-based criteria. To confi rm the diagnosis of exacerbation, the most selective biomarker was C-reactive protein (CRP) but this was neither suffi ciently sensitive nor specifi c alone. However, the combination of CRP with any increased major exacerbation symptom on that day (dyspnoea, sputum volume, or sputum purulence) increased the sensitivity and specifi city. Further research will aid in the understanding of mechanisms of COPD exacerbations and will lead to the development of more specifi c biomarkers.",

In stable COPD there is an increase in the CD8+ lymphocytes and macrophages in the bronchial mucosa and an increase in neutrophils with more severe disease. 14 In one study, where biopsies were done at exacerbation in patients with chronic bronchitis, increased airway eosinophilia was reported, although the patients studied had only mild COPD. 10 Modest increases were seen in neutrophils, T lymphocytes (CD3), and TNF alpha positive cells. However, in patients with more severe COPD, increases have been seen in airway neutrophils when stable that increase further at exacerbation. [10] [11] [12] Qiu and colleagues 11 have studied biopsies from patients with severe COPD, who were treated at exacerbation with tracheal intubation, and showed that there was pronounced airway neutrophilia, neutrophil elastase expression, and upregulation of neutrophil chemokine expression. However, studies in intubated patients with COPD are diffi cult, since the results can be complicated by secondary infection. Oxidative stress is a key factor in the development of airway infl ammation in COPD. A study has shown that patients with severe exacerbations who needed hospital admission or assisted ventilation have evidence of increased large airway interleukin-8 (IL-8) levels and increased oxidative stress. 12 Various markers of oxidative stress have been shown to rise in the airways with exacerbation such as hydrogen peroxide and 8-isoprostane and these markers can take some time to recover to baseline. 15 Upper airway infl ammation is increased in COPD patients, increases further at exacerbation, and is associated with lower airway infl ammatory changes. 13, 16 Systemic infl ammation increases at exacerbation and although the causes of this response in COPD are not clear, there is probably a spill-over of infl ammatory markers from the lungs. By contrast with stable disease, 16 exacerbations seem to be associated with a direct correlation between the degree of airway infl ammation and the size of the systemic acute-phase response. 13 Systemic infl am mation increases when the exacerbation is associated with bacterial and viral infection. 17 Several infl ammatory markers increase at exacerbation, such as plasma fi brinogen and CRP, that have been linked to increased cardiovascular risk. Respiratory infections have been associated with increased cardiac events 18 and thus a COPD exacerbation, especially if triggered by an infection, might also be associated with increased cardiac morbidity.",

There have been few such studies in the developing world, but a study from Hong Kong detected viruses in only 22% of exacerbations. 29 However, this study diff ered from others in the choice of assay and in that samples were taken from the upper airway rather than directly from the lower airway. A smaller study of 14 COPD patients admitted to hospital in Singapore reported that 64% of COPD exacerbations were associated with viruses although, like the Hong Kong study, most were associated with infl uenza virus, 30 which was possibly due to less frequent use of the infl uenza vaccine.",

A study investigating the benefi t of antibiotics in more than 300 acute exacerba tions showed a greater treatment success rate in patients treated with antibiotics, especially if their initial presentation was with the symptoms of increased dyspnoea, sputum volume, and purulence, than in patients who did not receive such treatment. 40 Patients with mild COPD obtained less benefi t from antibiotic therapy than those with more severe COPD. The results of a meta-analysis have shown that antibiotic treatment off ered a small but signifi cant benefi t in treatment failure and mortality. 41 Substantial progress has been made on investigat ing the role of bacterial infection at exacerbation, with the development of molecular typing methods allowing the detection of changes in bacterial strains, rather than species. Sethi and colleagues 42 have suggested that isolation of a new bacterial strain in COPD patients who were regularly sampled was associated with an in creased risk of an exacerbation. However, this fi nding does not conclusively prove that bacteria are direct causes of exacerbations, because not all exacerbations were associated with strain change, and not all strain changes resulted in exacerbation. The strain-specifi c immune responses to colonising bacterial species 43 provide some further evidence that bacteria are not just innocent bystanders in the lower airways during exacerbations.",

This observation might be due to the fact that not all exacerbations recover to baseline levels of symptoms and lung function. 3 The results of one audit showed that around 30% of patients seen at hospital with an index exacerbation will be seen again and possibly readmitted with a recurrent exacerbation within 8 weeks. 62 Patients with a history of frequent exacerbations also have increased airway infl ammation, 9 which could also contribute to the disease progression. 63 Why some patients have frequent exacerbations is not clear, although they possibly have increased susceptibility to respiratory viral infection. 25 Thus this group of COPD patients is important for targeting interventions that have the potential of reducing exacerbation frequency. COPD exacerbations have functional consequences. Spruit and colleagues 64 have shown that peripheral muscle weakness worsens during exacerbation, potentially contributing to reduced functionality and therefore to deconditioning (loss of fi tness). Patients who do not improve their walking distance within a month after exacerbation are more prone to be readmitted to hospital. 65 Donaldson and colleagues 66 have also shown that exacerbations are associated with a decline in outdoor activity for up to 5 weeks after the onset of symptoms. Patients who have frequent exacerbations had a faster decline in functional status, as measured by time spent outdoors, than patients with infrequent exacerbations (fi gure 3). Thus, patients with frequent exacerbations are more likely to become housebound and are a subpopulation that needs targeting for pulmonary rehabilitation programmes.",

[91] [92] Mahler and colleagues 91 found that the time to the fi rst exacerbation was longer with therapy with the long-acting beta agonist salmeterol, although the overall number of exacerbations during the study was small. The larger TORCH study 93 of 6112 COPD patients reported that salmeterol reduced exacerbation frequency compared with placebo over a 3-year period. In another study comparing salmeterol with the short-acting ipratropium and placebo, there was no diff erence in the eff ect in either treatment arm on exacerbation frequency. 94 Rossi and colleagues 95 compared two diff erent dosages of the inhaled bronchodilator formoterol with placebo or theophylline and concluded that formoterol was more eff ective and better tolerated than therapeutically appropriate doses of oral slow-release theophylline in symptomatic COPD patients. Furthermore, two studies reported that formoterol had no eff ect on total exacerbation frequency relative to placebo, though these studies did fi nd that the rates of steroid-treated exacerbations were decreased in the formoterol group. 96, 97 The balance of evidence favours a positive role for LABAs in decreasing exacerbation frequency, which might be the result of the inhibitory eff ect of \u03b2 2 -adrenoceptor agonists on plasma exudation and neutrophil migration, or possibly indicating an additional reduction in the expression of adhesion molecules. However, the likely pathway of action could be through a synergistic action on airway infl ammatory cells in those patients already receiving inhaled corticosteroid therapy. 98, 99 All of the major recent studies of combination therapy 75, 93, 96, 97 have reported that the combination of inhaled steroid and LABA is more eff ective than either individual drug alone in reducing exacerbation frequency. Thus, inhaled steroids are unlikely to be used as sole therapy for COPD patients in the future. The data from the TORCH study have confi rmed the eff ectiveness of the inhaled steroid-LABA combination in reducing exacerbation frequency, and the study has reported that the combination reduces hospital admission rates in COPD patients. 93 However, most of these studies have been done in patients with more severe COPD with an FEV 1 at less than 60% predicted (fi gure 4). The eff ect of the inhaled steroid-LABA combination on reducing exacerbations in patients with milder COPD is not clear, especially in those patients who have an increased exacerbation frequency.",

Two new receptorspecifi c phosphodiesterase inhibitors have been studied in COPD: cilomilast and rofl umilast, which are both phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors. A trial of cilomilast in COPD patients showed reduction in exacerbations in the cilomilast group. 104 Two studies of rofl umilast in COPD have been recently reported: Rabe and colleagues 105 have reported a reduction in exacerbations after 24 weeks therapy with rofl umilast, while Calverley and colleagues 106 studied rofl umilast in patients with GOLD stage III and IV in a 1-year trial and showed no overall eff ect on exacerbation rate, although patients with severe disease (GOLD stage IV) had fewer during the study period. Prevention of COPD exacerbations using this class of drugs is evolving and newer agents and more eff ective phosphodiesterase inhibitors will be developed with fewer adverse events. Tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 has an important role as a key mediator in COPD and has been a target for study. However, a trial of the anti-TNF\u03b1 antibody, infl iximab, showed no benefi t on any of the main trial outcomes and no eff ect of the therapy on exacerbation rate. 107 ",

This fi nding suggests that a course of pulmonary rehabilitation might reduce exacerbation severity rather than frequency by increasing the patient's knowledge of COPD and how to access health care or self-manage during an exacerbation. Pulmonary rehabilitation could thus reduce hospital stay but also encourage early presentation for exacerbation therapy, which reduces exacerbation length and thus the severity of the event. 115 Garcia-Aymerich and colleagues 116 have also shown in a 1-year study that patients with high levels of usual physical activity were at reduced risk of readmission to hospital. An intensive disease-specifi c self-management programme done in Canada has been shown to reduce hospital admission rate, 117 though a systematic review of nurse-led interventions failed to show a consistent eff ect on hospitalisation). 118 Casas and colleagues 119 have extended this approach by using a similar integrated care plan in two diff erent environments (Barcelona, Spain, and Leuven, Belgium), with similar eff ects on decreased readmission rates for COPD exacerbation. Patients with COPD are elderly, often with a degree of cognitive impairment and might have diffi culty with selfmanagement at exacerbations.
