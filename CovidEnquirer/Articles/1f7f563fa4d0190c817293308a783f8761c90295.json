This poses considerable logistic problems when preparing for, or dealing with, an epidemic. Some of these problems might be overcome by use of a compact reusable high-efficiency particulate air filtering mask that can be cut to size. We carried out a randomised controlled cross-over study to compare the efficacy of such a mask (Totobobo, Dream Lab One Pte Ltd, Singapore) with fit-tested N95 masks (1860 or 1860s or 1862; 3M, St Paul, MN, USA) in 22 healthy volunteers. The median (interquartile range) reduction in airborne particle counts was significantly higher [193-fold (145-200)] for N95 masks than for Totobobo masks [135-fold (83-184)] (P < 0.05). There was no statistically significant difference between the proportion of subjects achieving a reduction of 100-fold between N95 (19/22) and Totobobo (16/22) masks. We conclude that use of the Totobobo mask without fit testing cannot be recommended, but its performance is sufficiently promising to warrant further investigation.",

These data suggest that the use of Totobobo masks, even when cut to fit the subject's face, does not obviate the need for a mask-fitting programme.

If this finding is replicated, particularly in a population with different facial characteristics, then using the Totobobo mask in the panel of masks to be tested may reduce the number of masks that need to be tested before an adequate fit is found. This potential advantage, however, will need to be balanced against the time taken to trim the Totobobo mask to size.

Although the CI straddles 50%, this may be due to our small sample size. Comfort is an important issue when masks need to be worn for long periods of time. 9 Greater comfort may translate into greater compliance with proper use of the mask and hence greater protection in clinical use. The experience of our intensive care unit during the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic suggests that compliance is an important factor in determining the risk of occupational infection. 10 In theory, all subjects should have achieved a filtration factor 100 with the N95 mask, as they had previously passed a fit test with the same model of N95 mask. The lower than expected pass rate may reflect the fact that subjects did not undergo a regular fittesting programme. The US Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Centers for Disease Control and Protection recommends that workers using N95 respirators should have repeated fit-testing on a regular basis. Although this imposes a considerable logistic and financial burden and is controversial, our data suggest that a significant proportion of subjects may not be adequately protected without regular testing. 11 The results of a recent randomised controlled trial conducted in emergency departments and medical and paediatric wards suggest that surgical masks provide a similar level of protection to N95 masks against transmission of seasonal influenza. 12 However, we would be cautious concerning extrapolation of these data to all healthcare environments and to patients with influenza A H1N1 (2009) infection. The risk of healthcare worker infection relates to a number of factors including number of infectious particles produced by patients and the number of organisms that constitutes an infectious dose. 13 If the infectious dose is very small or the number of infectious particles produced is very high, then the benefit of the much higher filtration efficacy of N95 respirators should be greater. 14 These values vary with the organism and are currently unknown for influenza A H1N1. Furthermore, in certain areas, such as intensive care units, the frequent use of aerosolgenerating procedures will increase the number of infectious particles produced and therefore the likely benefit of N95 respirators.",

It is possible that the performance of the mask might not be as good if this training were conducted by an individual with less insight into the functioning of the mask. Second, our study was conducted in an exclusively Chinese group of subjects. Facial characteristics may vary between racial groups and it is possible that our results will not be replicated in other racial groups. Third, the sample size was too small to adequately assess the effect of type of mask on the proportion of subjects with an adequate fit or comfort. Fourth, the comfort of the masks was only superficially tested. However, our study was a pilot study designed to determine if the mask was worthy of more extensive investigation, and in this respect we believe it has generated useful data. Based on our findings we feel that a larger multi-racial study that assesses comfort as well as fit is warranted.",

The approximate retail prices (without bulk discount or delivery) of the masks are US$20 for the reusable Totobobo mask, with replacement filters costing US$1.60, and US $0.97 for single-use 3M 1860 respirators. Other factors that would need to be considered in a costing exercise are the costs of storage of masks, cleaning of Totobobo masks and fit-testing as well as bulk purchase discounts, and the number of times that a Totobobo mask can be reused.",
