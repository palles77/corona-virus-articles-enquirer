In this study, we investigated the importance of cellular and viral lipid rafts in PRRSV infection. First, we demonstrated that PRRSV glycoproteins, Gp3 and Gp4, were associated with lipid rafts during viral entry, and disruption of cellular lipid rafts inhibited PRRSV entry. We also showed the raft-location of CD163, which might contribute to the glycoproteins-raft association. Subsequently, raft disruption caused a significant reduction of viral RNA production. Moreover, Nsp9 was shown to be distributed in rafts, suggesting that rafts probably serve as a platform for PRRSV replication. Finally, we confirmed that disassembly of rafts on the virus envelope may affect the integrity of PRRSV particles and cause the leakage of viral proteins, which impaired PRRSV infectivity. These findings might provide insights on our understanding of the mechanism of PRRSV infection.",

Recently, there have been devastating outbreaks of atypical PRRS caused by a highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) strain in China, which is characterized by high fever, high morbidity, and high mortality in all age pigs (Zhou and Yang, 2010) . PRRSV has a very narrow cell tropism, showing a preference for cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage in vivo (Duan et al., 1997) . PRSSV is also sustained by MA-104 cell line derived from African green monkey kidney and its derivatives (MARC-145 and CL2621) in vitro (Kim et al., 1993) . This cell tropism is mainly determined by the presence or absence of specific receptors in the target cells. PRRSV enters cells via receptor-mediated endocytosis, and heparan sulfate, sialoadhesin, and CD163 are known as the main PRRSV receptors (Van Breedam et al., 2010a) . CD163, a macrophage differentiation membrane antigen belonging to the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) family, is shown to be capable of mediating PRRSV infection in non-permissive cells (Calvert et al., 2007) .",

            "text": "Lipid rafts are utilized in the lifecycle of numerous enveloped viruses. Many enveloped viruses exploit lipid rafts for their entry stages, in which the viral enveloped glycoproteins probably insert into lipid rafts to interact with the raft-located receptors or convert from their native state to activated form to initiate or facilitate viral internalization and/or fusion (Ahn et al., 2002; Bender et al., 2003; Popik et al., 2002) . Lipid rafts are also found in the intracellular structures and many special proteins such as arrays of signal transduction proteins and some viral nonstructural proteins are found in lipid rafts on plasma membrane and intracellular membranes, which contribute to efficient trafficking, replication, assembly, and budding (Aizaki et al., 2004; Barman and Nayak, 2007; Bhattacharya et al., 2006; Ono and Freed, 2001) . In addition, for certain viruses, the viral membrane shows similar structure to lipid raft in cell membrane, and is critical for their efficient infections (Brugger et al., 2006; Graham et al., 2003) . Recently, it was reported that cholesterol-depletion drugs could inhibit PRRSV infection and influence PRRSV entry to Marc-145 cells (Huang et al., 2011) . However, there is a lack of detailed and direct evidence to prove whether lipid rafts function in PRRSV entry process. Moreover, we still have little information about whether lipid rafts are required in PRRSV infection and how PRRSV utilizes lipid rafts. Here, we provide more evidence to verify that PRRSV entry is associated with lipid rafts. In addition, we show that lipid rafts in cell membrane play an important role in PRRSV replication and release, and lipid rafts in PRRSV envelope are also critical for its infection.",

Previous studies have shown that upon treatment with M\u03b2CD membrane cholesterol levels will remain low for 9-12 h (Li et al., 2007; Rojek et al., 2008) . Indeed, treatment with M\u03b2CD for 1 h effectively reduced the level of cellular cholesterol in both Marc-145 cells and PAMs by approximate 80-90% compared to that in untreated cells at the concentration of 20 mM (Fig. 1A) . Moreover, 2 h following treatment with 30 mM M\u03b2CD, the Marc-145 cells or PAMs retained relative viability of 100% compared with controls ( Fig. 1B) , ruling out the possible nonspecific effects of cytotoxicity caused by M\u03b2CD. Next, we treated Marc-145 cells with M\u03b2CD (0, 2.5, 5, 7.5, 10, and 20 mM) for 1 h prior to infection with PRRSV strain CH1a (MOI \u00bc1), and examined PRRSV infection using indirect immunofluorescent staining and quantified PRRSV titers of the supernatant 24 h post infection. As shown in Fig. 1C and D, CH1a infection was significantly inhibited by M\u03b2CD in a dosedependent manner. And a titer-reduction of more than 10 4 -fold was observed at the concentration of 20 mM when compared with the non-M\u03b2CD-treated cells (Fig. 1D ). To investigate whether this anti-PRRSV activity is strain specific, we did the same treatment with PAMs and then infected it with HP-PRRSV strain Hpv (MOI\u00bc 1). Our results showed that M\u03b2CD also inhibited Hpv infection in PAMs, and a more than 1000-fold suppression was observed at the concentration of 20 mM (Fig. 1E ).",

We then performed immunoblot analysis with fractions using antibodies that are reactive to individual viral envelope proteins (Gp3, Gp4, and Gp5) (Fig. 3A) . A moderate staining of Gp3 and Gp4 proteins was present in the caveolin-rich raft-fraction, indicating that PRRSV Gp3 and Gp4 enveloped proteins were associated with lipid rafts during entry. However, the protein Gp5 was almost excluded from the lipid raft fractions and recovered in non-raft fractions associated with the non-raft maker CD71 (Harder et al., 1998) . However, when the PAMs were pretreated with 20 mM M\u03b2CD for 1 h, we did not succeed in isolating lipid raft and Gp3 and Gp4 were recovered in the fraction with the non-raft protein CD71 (Fig. 3B) , These results suggest that lipid rafts might play a role in PRRSV entry.",

Since the enveloped proteins of PRRSV associated with lipid rafts on plasma membrane are Gp3 and Gp4 but not Gp5, we assume that CD163 might be located in lipid raft microdomains. To verify this hypothesis, we also studied the distribution of CD163 during PRRSV entry (Fig. 3A ). As expected, CD163 was found to be enriched in the raft-fractions, indicating that CD163 may be a raft-located receptor. However, it is also possible that binding of glycoproteins of PRRSV to rafts recruits CD163 to these domains from non-raft components. Thus, we next investigated whether CD163 was a raft-protein in uninfected cells. We transfected CD163 into Hela cells and then treated cells with 20 mM M\u03b2CD for 1 h at 24 h post transfection. The CD163 distribution on M\u03b2CD-treated cell membrane was compared with that of untreated cells using Immunofluorescent assay. As shown in Fig. 3C , CD163 proteins on untreated cellular membrane were speckled while these spots disappeared and changed into a uniform distribution on cellular membrane upon M\u03b2CD treatment. To further confirm the CD163 location in uninfected PAMs, we directly used sucrose gradients to isolate detergent-insoluble fractions from PAMs and performed immunoblot to analyze CD163 in fractions (Fig. 3D) . A substantial portion of CD163 was found to be restricted in the raft-fractions. These results suggest that CD163 proteins are distributed in lipid rafts on cell membrane in PAMs, which may mediate the association of PRRSV glycoproteins with rafts during viral entry.",

Some of these viruses induce distinct membrane structural scaffold to provide platforms for viral RNA replication, such as the formation of lipid raft associated HCV RNA replication complex (Aizaki et al., 2004; Gosert et al., 2002; Westaway et al., 1997) . Therefore, we attempted to investigate whether lipid rafts are required for PRRSV RNA production. We infected PAMs with the Hpv (MOI\u00bc1) and then replaced the cell medium with fresh medium containing 10 mM M\u03b2CD 12 h later. Viral RNA levels in cells were quantitated using real-time PCR at 0, 6, and 12 h after medium switching (Fig. 4A) . Compared with the PBS-treated cells, a significant reduction of the intracellular viral RNA was observed after M\u03b2CD treatment, suggesting that lipid rafts might be involved in PRRSV replication. Next, we further examined the distribution of Nsp9, the RNA dependent RNA polymerase of PRRSV after flotation analysis of PAMs which were infected with Hpv (MOI\u00bc1) for 24 h with 20 mM M\u03b2CD for 1 h, followed by replenishment with exogenous cholesterol at the indicated concentration for 1 h. Then the cells were incubated with CH1a (MOI \u00bc 5) and the internalized viral RNA level in cells was analyzed using real-time PCR. Cells without M\u03b2CD treatment and cholesterol replenishment were set as a control. The data represent the mean 7 standard deviation from three independent experiments. Significant differences compared with untreated group are denoted by * (Po 0.05), ** (P o0.01), and *** (Po 0.001).",

The permeabilization was defined as a greater decrease of the capsid protein relative to the envelope glycoprotein. Thus, depletion of cholesterol from viral envelope resulted in permeabilization of PRRSV virions. We also tested the viral RNA levels of the M\u03b2CDtreated CH1a virions to determine whether viral RNA is retained in PRRSV virions (Fig. 7B) . Our results showed little change in the amount of viral RNA in CH1a virions after M\u03b2CD treatment, suggesting that PRRSV particles do not lose viral RNA after permeabilization by M\u03b2CD. These results reveal that depletion of M\u03b2CD treatment. Virus prepared as above was analyzed for particle-associated viral RNA by real-time RT-PCR.

Under such condition, the efficiency of infection is dependent on the amount of cholesterol residual on cell membrane. Direct replenishment of exogenous cholesterol to cells after drug-mediated cholesterol depletion substantially restored PRRSV infection. These data indicate that the efficiency of PRRSV infection at least in part is associated with the cholesterol level on cell membranes. Molecular simulations of model membranes show that the integrity of lipid raft microdomains is sensitive to minor changes of cholesterol (Risselada and Marrink, 2008) . Thus, cholesterol is a major component of lipid raft microdomains, and manipulation of cholesterol present within membranes is frequently used to implicate lipid rafts. Therefore, we further investigated whether and how PRRSV infection was affected by cellular lipid rafts. PRRSV entry process is mediated by receptor-specific endocytosis, where the virus attachment, internalization and membrane fusion occur sequentially . Previous study has reported the significant suppression of cellular cholesterol depletion on PRRSV entry, which is in consistent with our results . These results are similar to the findings observed on some other members of the order Nidovirales such as HCoV-229E, MHV and SARS-CoV (Choi et al., 2005; Li et al., 2007; Nomura et al., 2004; Thorp and Gallagher, 2004) . However, how lipid rafts contribute to PRRSV entry is not explicit, Although it has been reported that Gp4 is located in lipid rafts when it is exogenously expressed in HeLa cells and that Gp4 and CD163 co-located in lipid rafts in a porcine kidney cell line (Du et al., 2012) , there is no direct and convincing evidence to show the association of Gp4, CD163, and other glycoproteins with lipid rafts in PAMs during PRRSV entry. By the use of Triton X-100 extract and discontinuous sucrose gradient fractionation, we showed that the viral envelope proteins Gp3 and Gp4, but not Gp5, were partitioned in lipid rafts during virus penetration of PAMs. These results correspond well with their roles in PRRSV entry. Gp5 interacts with the sialoadhesin receptor to mediate virus-cell binding and initial endocytosis (Van Breedam et al., 2010b) , while Gp3 and Gp4, which form trimers with Gp2, interacting with CD163 are essential for the following internalization and fusion (Van Gorp et al., 2010) . These data imply that lipid rafts probably utilize cellular receptor CD163 to mediate its association with PRRSV envelope proteins during entry. Consistent with this assumption, we showed that CD163 was mainly located in lipid raft microdomain of PAM membrane, and the distribution of the CD163 on cell membrane was found to be altered by cholesterol depletion. Moreover, PRRSV enters cells by a process of clathrin-mediated endocytosis which is distinguished from lipid raft-mediated endocytosis pathway (Kreutz and Ackermann, 1996; Mercer et al., 2010; Nauwynck et al., 1999) . Therefore, we infer that lipid rafts probably contribute to membrane fusion but not endocytosis in PRRSV entry. The glycoproteins-receptor interaction may trigger the raft clustering to form platforms, which may function in PRRSV membrane fusion.",

            "text": "Viral RNA replication is a multistep process involving a replication complex that is formed by viral and cellular components with the viral genomic RNA template. This replication complex is embedded within particular virus-induced membrane vesicles, which serve as the anchoring sites for the PRRSV replication complex to mediate migration of the replication complex between cellular organelles (Bost et al., 2003; den Boon and Ahlquist, 2010; Netherton and Wileman, 2011) . In the present study, a significant reduction of the intracellular viral RNA resulted from cholesterol depletion, indicating that lipid rafts are probably involved in PRRSV RNA production. PRRSV replication is directed by at least 14 replicase proteins that have both common enzymatic activities, especially the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase Nsp9 (Fang and Snijder, 2010; Yun and Lee, 2013) . Flotation analysis of infected PAMs showed that Nsp9 was distributed in lipid raft fractions. Thus, lipid rafts might serve as the sites for viral RNA replication complex anchored to PRRSV-induced special membrane structural scaffold. However, the precise mechanism for this association of special membrane structure with viral replication complex remains to be determined. Membrane lipid rafts have been implicated in the assembly and release of many enveloped viruses. Our results also showed that lipid raft disruption increased the release of PRRSV particles. For some virus such as influenza virus, lipid rafts and their underlying cortical cytoskeleton probably provide a framework for specific and ordered viral protein-protein interactions required for proper assembly (Roberts and Compans, 1998; Simpson-Holley et al., 2002) . Cholesterol depletion could induce rearrangement of the cortical actin cytoskeleton in many cells and cortical actin rearrangements also could induce reorganization of lipid raft microdomains (Chadda et al., 2007; Francis et al., 1999; Simpson-Holley et al., 2002) . Therefore, perturbation of actin cytoskeleton caused by cholesterol depletion might contribute to the enhanced release of PRRSV particles envelope proteins. However, no increase in viral RNA level or virus infectivity was observed for the PRRSV particles released from lipid raft disrupted cells. It is possible that lipid raft disruption might induce abnormal assembly and release of PRRSV particles.",

            "text": "Cholesterol depletion may also mediate disruption of PRRSV particles and directly cause the reduction in viral infectivity. PRRSV virions contain a certain amount of cholesterol and this lipid feature seems to be critical in sustaining its integrity. Our results showed that both CH1a and Hpv infectivity was decreased in a dose-dependent manner when the viruses were treated with cholesterol-depletion drug. Measuring the residual cholesterol in PRRSV virions exposed to increasing concentrations of M\u03b2CD indicated that the loss of infectivity was closely associated with reduction in virion cholesterol. The loss of viral infectivity after cholesterol depletion is likely due to partly structure destruction such as loss of viral structure proteins or loss of viral RNA. Indeed, PRRSV viral envelopes were permeabilized when treated with M\u03b2CD at a high concentration, evidenced by the loss of PRRSV nucleoprotein (N). Accordingly, we were unable to completely restore virus infectivity by adding back cholesterol to permeabilized virions. Presumably, even though the large holes in the viral membrane can be repaired by cholesterol, patching the membrane probably cannot overcome the loss of critical viral proteins. Recent cryo-electron tomographic structure determination of PRRSV has provided a possible model for the nucleocapsid-RNA organization in the virion. This model speculates that two layers of N dimers form a linked, twisted chain with the RNA in the middle, and this chain is then bundled into a roughly spherical shape that leaves a hollow interior (Dokland, 2010; Spilman et al., 2009) . The disordered appearance of the PRRSV core may suggest a more loosely organized nucleocapsid which makes it easier for the N protein to leak upon M\u03b2CD treatment. However, the permeabilization of PRRSV virions may not be enough to result in the loss of the entire genome. Therefore, disassembly of lipid rafts on the virus envelope affected integrity of viral envelope and caused the viral envelope leakage of viral proteins to adversely affect virus infectivity.",

These findings promote us to further investigate how viral proteins are associated with lipid rafts and how lipid raft domains function in the organization of a mature PRRSV particle production.

Briefly, PAMs were scraped with a rubber policeman into ice-cold PBS and collected by centrifugation at 1000g for 3 min at 4 1C. Then pelleted cells were lysed using 0.3 ml of ice-cold TNE buffer (25 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA) containing 1% Triton X-100 (Merck), 1 mM NaF, and a cocktail of protease inhibitors (Thermo) at 4 1C for 30 min with gentle agitation. Then, the cell lysates were centrifuged at 4 1C for 10 min at 3500g to remove nuclei and insoluble materials. The supernatants were collected and mixed with equal volumes of 80% (wt/vol) sucrose in TNE buffer and then placed in the bottoms of ultracentrifuge tubes. A discontinuous sucrose gradient was formed by sequentially overlaying 2.1 ml of 30% and 1.2 ml of 5% sucrose in TNE buffer. These mixtures were centrifuged at 4 1C for 18 h at 250,000g in a SW 55 Ti rotor (Beckman). After centrifugation, lipid rafts could be visible as an opaque band at the boundary between the 5% and 30% sucrose solutions. A total of 11 gradient fractions were collected from the top to bottom and stored at \u00c0 80 1C until use.",
