            "text": "Ethnopharmacological relevance: Worldwide, one of the drivers of substitution and adulteration is the cost of the natural resources (plants, animals, fungi) that are ingredients of traditional medicines. Relatively few studies have been done that link prices of traditional medicine ingredients to what drives changes in price, yet this is an important topic. Theoretically, prices have been widely considered as an economic indicator of resource scarcity. Rare, slow growing medicinal plants sell for high prices and common, less popular species for low prices. Price levels also influence the viability of farming vs. wild harvest (and incentives to overharvest high value species when tenure is weak). Prices can also influence the harvesting or buying behaviour of harvesters, traders or manufacturers. When prices are high, then there is a greater incentive to use cheaper substitute species or adulterants. As previous studies on herbal medicine ingredients have shown, adulteration applies in a wide variety of cases, including to some Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) species. Aim of the study: The aim of this study was to gain a better understanding of which factors influenced changes in the market prices of document prices for four popular, but very different traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) species (2002 -2017). Materials and methods: Fluctuations in market prices were followed over a 15-year period (2002-2017) for four very different TCM ingredients: two plant species (one wild harvested for fruits (Schisandra sphenanthera Rehder & E.H. Wilson) the other in a transition from wild harvest to cultivation (Paris polyphylla Smith), an animal species (the Tokay gecko (Gekko gecko L.)) and the entomophagous \"caterpillar fungus\" (Ophiocordyceps sinensis (Berk).

            "text": "Results: High prices of medicinal plants are widely considered to reflect resource scarcity. Real-time market prices for three of the four very different TCM species we studied all showed major price fluctuations. The exception was P. polyphylla, whose wild populations are widely known to be increasingly scarce, where there was a steady increase in price, with few fluctuations in the upward price trend. The three other species showed significant price fluctuations. These were driven by multiple factors. Ecological and biogeographic factors that influence abundance or scarcity of supply certainly played a role. But other factors were also influential. These included both national and global economic factors (the influence of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC)), national policy changes that in turn influenced businessmen giving expensive gifts (that included O. sinensis)), climate change (influencing fruiting success of S. sphenanthera), price speculation by traders and lack of information (e.g: reduction in G. gecko prices due to traders incorrectly believing that domestication would increase supplies). Conclusions: Price fluctuations in the four TCM species we examined are influenced by many factors and not just resource scarcity. And the situation is more complex than the trajectory based on Homma's (1992) model, where he predicted that higher prices would result in a shift to cultivation, thus replacing wild harvest. In case of both O. sinensis and P. polyphylla, Homma (1992 Homma ( , 1996 was right in terms of scarcity and high prices stimulating a major investment in cultivation (P. polyphylla) and artificial production (O. sinensis). But in both cases, intensive production through cultivation or artificial propagation do not yet occur on a large enough scale to reduce harvest of wild stocks. Substitution and adulteration occur with all four species. Improving information to https://doi.",

Price increases provide an incentive to unscrupulous suppliers to adulterate with cheaper or more common species. Despite the links between prices, efficacy and traditional medicine supplies, few studies have been done on what influences medicinal product prices. High prices can also drive over-exploitation and unsustainable use. While scarcity of supplies of popular, wild harvested traditional medicines can drive up prices, there are few long-term studies of the different factors that influence traditional medicine prices. Yet studies of price trends are relevant to a better understanding of sustainable wild harvest, cultivation and product quality.",

            "text": "The economic theory that prices are an economic indicator of resource scarcity has been criticised by economists such as Norgaard (1990) and Neumayer (2000) in the case of a broad category of natural resources, although not applied to traditional medicines. More generally, for non-timber forest products (NTFP's), several researchers have developed hypotheses that link commercial market demand to the selective harvesting of economically valuable forest products (Homma, 1992 (Homma, , 1996 Godoy and Bawa, 1993; Wilkie and Godoy, 1996) . Homma (1992 Homma ( , 1996 , for example hypothesized that as commercial demand for a forest product grew, more and more of the forest product would be harvested. Then, as quantities and quality from wild plant populations declined, prices would increase. With reduced supplies, Homma (1992) suggested that higher prices consequently resulted in a shift to cultivation of forest products to replace wild harvest. Prices paid for medicinal plants also are an important factor that influences whether cultivation is economically viable or not (Schippmann et al., 2003) . Development of new products can also influence prices and a shift to alternative supply sources. Development of TAMIFLU\u2122 (oseltamivir phosphate), in which shikimic acid (sourced from Chinese star anise (Illicium verum Hook f.)) is a major ingredient (Wang et al., 2011) stimulated research into microbiological methods of producing shikimic acid (Bochkov et al., 2012) and also drove up prices of this medicinal spice. Creative marketing and expansion into international markets (Potterat, 2010) have certainly stimulated cultivation of wolf-berry species (Lycium barbarum L. and Lycium chinense Mill.).",

According to Winkler (2002) , citing on-going research by Yonten Gyatso, 15th century Tibetan medical texts recorded use of O. sinensis, about 300 years before the first records in Chinese medical texts. Prices for O. sinensis have been high for centuries. For example, in one of the earliest western accounts of the O. sinensis trade, by Du Halde (in 1736), O. sinensis was worth four times its weight in silver (Pegler et al., 1994) . Unlike many non-timber products, O. sinensis can account for a high proportion of household cash income to collectors and traders in remote parts of the Himalaya. Winkler (2008) , for example records that income from sale of O. sinensis frequently represents 70-90% of household income.",

An example of export trade in S. sphenanthera is given in this special issue and the properties and uses of this species are summarized in Cunningham and Brinckmann (2010) . Panossian and Wikman's (2008) review of research on Sphenanthera chinensis (Turcz.) Baill. is also relevant to S. sphenanthera. The P. polyphylla trade is reviewed elsewhere in this special issue (Cunningham et. al., in press) and its uses were reviewed by Shah et al. (2012) , so are only dealt with briefly here. P. polyphylla is best known for the steroidal compounds that speed up blood coagulation and as an important ingredient in Yunnan Baiyao (literally \"Yunnan White Powder\") that was invented in 1902 and been a feature of firstaid kits in China for decades. Between 800 and 1050 t of P. polyphylla rhizomes are sold annually (Cunningham et al., 2018, this issue) . One indicator of future demand for products containing P. polyphylla is the growth of the company most closely linked to Yunnan Baiyao medicinal powder. Since 1995, the Yunnan Baiyao Group has grown rapidly as an international business, doubling it's revenue to USD3.4 billion in 2016, with rising profit margins and growing market capitalization (to over US$13 billion) (Schuman, 2017) . This paper is divided into two components. Firstly, we present the results of tracking price changes and secondly, discuss the relevant links between prices, product quality, cultivation initiatives and conservation efforts before concluding.",

Major fluctuations in market prices assessed for the 15-year period (2002-2017) for four very different TCM ingredients: two plant species (one wild harvested for fruits (Schisandra sphenanthera Rehder & E.H. Wilson) the other in a transition from wild harvest to cultivation (Paris polyphylla Smith), an animal species (the Tokay gecko (Gekko gecko L.) and the entomophagous \"caterpillar fungus\" (Ophiocordyceps sinensis (Berk). G.H. Sung, J.M. Sung, Hywel-Jones & Spatafor). All of these species are in commercial trade, but the main reason why they were chosen is that they represented a spectrum of life-forms, a variations in geographic range and habitat specificity (from wide geographic range in the case of G. gecko to habitat specific (O. sinensis) and price ranges (from US$8.06 CNY/kg for G. gecko for to US$18726 to US$30250 CNY/kg for O. sinensis in 2016). In an influential analysis of commonness or rarity, Rabinowitz et al. (1986) developed an approach to characterize the geographic distribution, habitat specificity and relative population sizes of plant species. The first choice is whether the species has a wide or narrow geographic distribution. The second choice, within that distribution, is whether the species has a wide or narrow habitat specificity. We used this to contrast the relative \"supply status\" of four focal species in this study (Table 1) , also noting additional factors that influenced supplies of each species during the study period.",

The main driver for the increasing S. sphenanthera price since 2006 ( Fig. 7) is that S. chinensis prices have been increasing rapidly, despite the fact that S. chinensis is cultivated. However, within the overall trend of an increasing price are significant fluctuations. These have diverse causes, including changeable weather influencing fruit production (Fig. 8) . From field experience, we know for example that unseasonal cold weather during the flowering season causes flowers to drop off and results in low S. sphenanthera fruit yields and reduced fruit harvests that in turn affect the market price.

In terms of declining supplies driving up demand, P. polyphylla shows the closest fit to this trend, with relatively low price volatility (Fig. 5) . But drivers and price volatility also vary across species. The views of the economists Norgaard (1990 Norgaard ( , 1991 and Neumayer (2000) are supported by our study, which showed that with the possible excpetion of P. polyphylla, price fluctuations in the TCM case are also influenced by many factors and not just scarcity. Many TCM traders are risk-averse and collectively, their buying behaviour is an important driver of price declines. In some cases, for example with O. sinensis, specialist traders of this caterpillar fungus also speculate, driving prices higher (Fig. 4 , price increase 1 (in 2007/8). Improving information to medicinal plant traders on the supply status of TCM stocks, whether from wild harvest or from cultivation could benefit product quality, cultivation initiatives and conservation efforts. Norgaard (1990) , in considering the interplay between resource stocks, scarcity and prices for those resources, has criticised of the common (Ricardian model) approach that is based on the logic that \"if resources and scarce and resource allocators are informed of this scarcity, then economic indicators will reflect this scarcity\". In their study of the traditional medicines trade in South Africa, Williams et al. (2007) show links between supply, demand and the market values of medicinal plants and the risk of overharvest were more complex than earlier studies (such as Cunningham, 1991) suggested. With traditional medicinal plant prices in South Africa, Williams et al. (2007) found that resource scarcity was just one of several factors that influenced a species' overall value. We agree with Williams et. al's (2007) conclusion, based on our study of 15-years of price fluctuations in the four focal TCM species. In addition to rising prices with increasing scarcity, price/ kg was influenced by two categories of factors. Firstly, factors that influence prices due to their influence on demand and secondly, factors that influence supplies. From our study, it is clear that declines in sources medicinal plants, fungi or animals goes beyond fundamental influences on supply (geographic distribution, habitat specificity, population size and growth rates). Substitution and adulteration occur, but in different ways across the four species. Each of these categories of factors that influenced the price of the four focal species is discussed in detail in the sections below, noting that not all of these factors are independent of each other.",

Substitution can be legitimate, when, as Foster (2011) points out, \"Substitution may involve offering one substance in place of another more expensive ingredient, or substituting one substance for another that might not be readily available or available only at a much higher price. If knowingly offered by both seller and buyer as a \"substitute\" for another substance, then the practice may be socially (and economically) acceptable, depending upon the cultural context\". There may also be cases where adulteration is unintentional or accidental, due to poor quality control measures in the supply chain. Nevertheless, improved supply chain management is important for many reasons. Substitution of I. verum, with toxic Illicium species (Illicium anisatum L. and Illicium lanceolatum A.C. Smith) can be resolved through better knowledge of the fruit characteristics of these three species (Wang et al., 2011) .",

So it is possible that some substitution may be occurring due to the lower price of S. sphenanthera. The Pharmacopoeia of the People's Republic of China   Fig. 1 . Tokay gecko prices 2002-2017 giving reasons for volatility: 1. Price increased in a short period due to increased capital flow in the Tokay gecko market in that year; 2. Price of Tokay geckos declined due to some TCM traders having the incorrect information that Tokay geckos had been successfully domesticated, with the expectation of large quantities of farmed geckoes entering the market. This did not occur. But nevertheless, many \"risk-averse\" TCM traders took a \"wait-and-see\" attitude on buying Tokay geckos and the price declined. 3. The price of Tokay geckos declined because the price rose too high in previous year and TCM traders held off from buying until the price fell; 4. The same happened in 2012, where the price dropped rapidly after a price increase in 2011; 5. The prices of Tokay geckos declined due to overall price declines across the TCM market; 6. The same reason for a decline occurred in late 2015 and into 2016 due to an overall decline in the TCM market. 7. Prices of Tokay geckos increased due to lower supplies and higher market demand in 2017. (State Pharmacopoeia Commission of the PRC, 2005) gives the \"indications for use\" for both S. sphenanthera and S. chinensis, and at the same dosage level. Other than substitution between these two species, adulteration with other species is not evident. Substitution of P. polyphylla also occurs due to the rising cost and scarcity of P. polyphylla, rhizomes, with rhizomes from several other Paris species being used and substitutes for P. polyphylla. And from a conservation perspective, the use of above-ground parts of P. polyphylla (Qin et al., 2018) would even be desirable, if this offers an acceptable form of substitution from a health perspective. With O. sinensis, adulteration can have negative health consequences. The high prices for O. sinensis (Fig. 4) occasionally result in a range of adulterants, including metal inserted into the bodies of the caterpillars to increase their weight and therefore payments to unscrupulous sellers. This may be the cause of lead-poisoning from consuming O. sinensis (Wu et al., 1996) . But this form of adulteration only works in the short term, affecting seller credibility and prices in the longer term. The need to detect adulteration where metal is inserted into the bodies of O. sinensis infected caterpillars has also stimulated O. sinensis traders to either invest in large scanners for quality control (Fig. 9) . As an additional back-up, some traders use hand-held metal detectors that they run over the caterpillar fungus bodies to detect metal inserts..",

Two of the four types of upgrading identified by Humphrey and Schmitz (2000) applied to the value-chains of the TCM species we studied. These were firstly, process upgrading, where new technology improves product quality (such as use of compressed air to clean O. sinensis (Fig. 3) or kiln drying of flattened Tokay geckos (Fig. 2) . The second type of upgrading, product upgrading, is not indicated in wholesale price data, but certainly occurs further along the value-chain where TCM products are developed into diverse and more sophisticated product lines, with higher values per unit volume. Examples are luxury packaging for O. sinensis used as expensive gifts and preparation of extracts of S. sphenanthera in Shanghai before export to the USA.",

            "text": "Prices of just one of the four focal species, O. sinensis, have been influenced by anti-corruption policy. While the background to this is straightforward, the reason why this influences caterpillar fungus prices requires careful consideration. Why did an anti-corruption campaign influence O. sinensis prices since early 2013 (see Fig. 4 )? After all, policies to deal with corruption have been an issue of public concern in China well before 2013 (He, 2000) . An important factor is that President Xi Jinping was elected in March 2013 and his anti-corruption campaign is considered \"more sustained and severe than any previous one\" Fig. 7 . S. sphenanthera prices 2002-2017 giving reasons for volatility. Since 2006, a fundamental driver of price increases for S. sphenanthera fruits has been the \"ripple-effect\" of price increases in the cultivated northern Schisandra (S. chinensis). 1. Prices increased due to a combination of lower production and lower stored stocks from the previous year's harvest. 2. Prices declined due to higher harvest levels and some TCM traders selling at a low price. 3. Prices increased due to cold climate and low fruiting success that reducing the production in mid-2007. 4. Prices declined due to the larger quantities that were harvested. In addition, as many TCM traders are risk-averse, the TCM traders took a \"wait-and-see attitude\", possibly also as a result of the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). 5. Prices increased due to increased market price and high market demand for the cultivated alternative species, Schisandra chinensis. 6. Prices kept dropping due to high stocks of S. sphenanthera and low demand from TCM traders. 7. Prices increased due to reduced production (because of drought) and increased commercial demand from traders. 8. Prices were in decline due to increased stocks and lower levels of buying by TCM traders. 9. Prices increased due to reduced production and more traders buying S. sphenanthera. Fig. 8 . A.

(Shambaugh, 2015) . Understanding guanxi is central to answering the question about how O. sinensis prices. Social networks and gift exchange to build them are well known and well studied across many cultures (for example, Mauss's, 1954 classic anthropological study) . Guanxi has a long history in China and refers to a process where good relationships are developed between individuals, creating \"obligations for a continual exchange of favours\" (Dunfee and Warren, 2001) . There are different types of guanxi, with some types associated with bribery and corruption (Braendle et al., 2005) . One of the gifts used to build guanxi are containing beautifully presented O. sinensis in sumptuously decorated boxes, often with red and yellow silk linings. Part of that anti-campaign since March 2013 has been to discourage influential individuals in accepting receiving expensive gifts or from attending luxurious banquets. And this, in turn, has influenced the decline in O. sinensis prices due to a decrease in their use as expensive gifts.",

And shown in Table 1 , the focal species range from very widely distributed (G. gecko) to the narrow distribution and complex life history of O. sinensis. Tokay geckos (Fig. 1a) , for example, are widespread through South Asia (Bangladesh, Bhutan, NE India, Nepal) and South-east Asia (Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand) through to New Guinea (West Papua province, Indonesia), Tokay geckos have also adapted to living in people's homes and in cities. Although a very large bodied gecko species, their behaviour and reproductive biology have also enabled this species to also become invasive in Brazil and the southern USA (Florida) (J\u00fanior, 2015) . With this widespread distribution and adaptiveness, local over-exploitation is likely, but extinction is not. However, Gu et al. (2011) point out that due to habitat loss and hunting, G. gecko populations have declined significantly, with the resultant listing of G. gecko as a \"Class 2 State Key Protected Animal\" in China. Within it's geographic range, P. polyphylla also occurs in a variety of habitats across a wide altitudinal range (from 100 to 3500 m asl). Despite a relatively wide geographic range and occurrence across diverse habitats, wild populations of P. polyphylla are in decline due to high impacts of selective harvest to collect the perennial rhizomes. And so does S. sphenanthera occurs in forests and thickets across a wide altitudinal range (700-200 m asl) in western and south-west China (in Anhui, Gansu, Guizhou, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Sichuan, NE Yunnan and Zhejiang) . O. sinensis on the other hand is restricted to the high altitude Himalaya (above 3000 m asl.)",

In the case of plants, fruit harvest (S. sphenanthera) has a lower impact than digging out rhizomes (P. polyphylla). With G. gecko, whole animals are harvested and with O. sinensis, the entomophagus fungi occur on their dead hosts (Hepialid moth larvae). Harvest impacts on P. polyphylla are discussed elsewhere in this special issue and wild populations are in decline (Cunningham et al., in press) . O. sinensis populations also commonly considered to be declining due to overexploitation (Negi et al., 2006) combined with habitat loss (Liang et al., 2008) . Winkler (2008) , on the other hand suggests that O. sinensis is only moderately vulnerable to overharvest. We agree with Winkler (2008) apart from one concern: climate change. Not only is resource management made more complex due to the complex life cycle of this entomophagous fungus and it's high price (see Fig. 4 ), but may also due the effects of a warmer world on the high altitude habitat (3000-5000 m asl) of O. sinensis, as we discuss in the next section.",

From field observation during a project on the S. sphenanthera trade in Sichuan, it is clear that unseasonal cold weather causes major declines in S. sphenanthera fruit production. Fluctuations in O. sinensis numbers may also be related to weather rather than to the effects of collecting. High yields probably relate to weather patterns in the preceding year, where relatively warm, high rainfall conditions caused by the monsoon and affects fungal spore dormancy on one hand, and the population dynamics of the Swift moth (Hepialid) caterpillars which O. sinensis spores infect on the other. High caterpillar numbers plus good weather for fungal spores result in high fungal caterpillar infection rates and consequent high yields to O. sinensis collectors, with consequent price decreases (Fig. 4 , arrow 4 in 2015/2016). In the longer term, the picture may be bleak. Climate change is widely recognized across the Himalaya, exemplified by the Minyong glacier retreating over 200 m in just four years (Miura, 2007) . Neither Stone (2008) nor other researchers working on O. sinensis harvesting have mentioned climate change, however. Interestingly, in a study of Metarhizium flavoviride W. Gams & Rozsypal, an entomophangous fungus in the same family as O. sinensis (the Clavicipitaceae), Hong et al. (1997) ,showed that spore viability and spore survival rates declined rapidly under moister, warmer conditions. The implications of that experimental study for climate change effects on wild O. sinensis are worrying. In addition, the complexity of O. sinensis dependence on the population dynamics of Hepialid moths and their food-plants shows how sustainable harvest becomes very complex and very challenging to manage at multiple spatial and time scales.",

In the O. sinensis case, Homma (1992 Homma ( , 1996 was right: there has been a major investment in artificial production of O. sinensis, as Yue et al. (2013) describe in their review of cultivation methods for O. sinensis. These range from culture of fruiting bodies through to inoculation of moth (Thitarodes armoricanus Oberth\u00fcr) larvae with mature fruiting bodies or cultured strains, then rearing infected larvae in underground areas planted with the larval food-plants. Products containing extracts from artificial cultivation are sold in China in capsule form. The relatively low price for products from artificial mycelial cultures is an indicator of consumer preference for the real thing: wild harvested O. sinensis. Yet farming of O. sinensis still needs to expand to a large scale, despite the amazingly high price for this product (Table 1) . Successful cultivation does occur in China for many faster growing TCM species, including L. barbarum (goji) (Wei et al., 2006) , P. polyphylla (Fig. 5 and Cunningham et al., 2018) and S. chinensis (bei wu weizi). Li et al. (2015) reported that there are at least 29 areas in Yunnan where P. polyphylla is cultivated, with the highest production in Ludian, near Lijiang. Overall, there are between 3000 and 3500 ha of P. polyphylla under cultivation in China due high prices coupled to strong government and industry support. Yet prices for P. polyphylla rhizomes continue to increase, with no sign, as yet, of the decline in wild harvest predicted by Homma's (1992) model in response to cultivation. One reason for this is in Yunnan, most cultivated P. polyphylla is grown for the lucrative seed market and the rhizomes are not harvested. But in time Homma (1992) could be correct.",

The decline in the prices of G. gecko in 2005/2006 due to traders believing that Tokay geckos were now successfully domesticated (Fig. 1) is a good example. Which ironically would go against the Homma (1992 Homma ( , 1996 trajectory, if traders factor in lower prices when cultivation really does occur, but needs to be profitable to expand. Captive breeding of Tokay geckos does occur in South-east Asia, but not on a scale at would support the export of millions of Tokay geckos to China (Nijman and Shepherd, 2015) . And this misinformation is not restricted to G. gecko market traders, but also appears to be a misconception in some exporting countries. In 2014, for example, following a decision by the Indonesian Ministry of Forestry allow to Indonesian six companies to export over three million \"live captive-bred\" Tokay Geckos for the pet trade, Nijman and Shepherd (2015) carefully examined the logistics and financial needs of Tokay gecko domestication. They concluded that \"the investments in terms of infrastructure, space, financial commitments and staff are not matched by the amount of money that can be made from the export of Tokay Geckos, especially if they are indeed intended for use in traditional medicines. In the authors' view it is impossible to maintain and breed these animals yearround and make a profit\u2026.. The inescapable conclusion is that if the quantities reported in trade are accurate, they can only be sustained through the routine laundering of wild-caught individuals and their export as dead specimens, rather than live for the pet trade. There is no legal trade in dead Tokay Geckos from Indonesia\".",
