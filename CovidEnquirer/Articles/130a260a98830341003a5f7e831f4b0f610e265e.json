Suckling mice born to unimmunized dams rapidly succumb to an acute encephalomyelitis . MHV-JHM can be isolated from the brains and spinal cords of maternal antibody-protected mice when the late onset disease becomes clinically apparent, showing that the virus must be present in these mice when they are still asymptomatic . To determine which cells of the central nervous system (CNS) were potential reservoirs for the virus during the asymptomatic period, tissue sections were assayed simultaneously by immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescence staining for the presence of viral antigen and for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), a marker for astrocytes. 2 The results indicate that 20% (range 0-52%) of the MHV-JHM infected cells in asymptomatic mice were astrocytes . In mice symptomatic with late onset hindlimb paralysis, a higher percentage of infected cells were astrocytes . These results indicate that astrocytes are a target cell in both symptomatic and asymptomatic mice persistently infected with MHV-JHM, and suggest that the astrocyte is a potential cellular reservoir for MHV-JHM in asymptomatic mice .",

Since viral antigen can be detected in the CNS of most mice, it is likely that the brain or the spinal cord is the source for reactivated virus . In this study, we have analyzed MHV-JHM infected cells in tissue sections from the brain and spinal cord for glial fibrillary acidic protein (G FAP), a specific marker for astrocytes 2 and compared the results to a similar analysis of cells in mice with acute encephalomyelitis or with hindlimb paralysis . The results are summarized in Table 1 Acute encephalomyelitis in suckling mice born to unimmunized dams Viral antigen was readily detected in these mice and 35% of the MHV-JHM infected cells in the mouse which was studied were also positive for GFAP ( Table 1) . Some of these cells had the typical morphology of astrocytes with multiple thin processes radiating out from the cell body whereas others resembled large reactive astrocytes (large cells with hypertrophied cytoplasm) ( Fig . 1 (A) and (B) ) . The majority of infected astrocytes, however, were small cells without typical morphology and stained less darkly for GFAP .

Many of the infected astrocytes in these mice were small cells which lightly stained for GFAP, although some with the typical morphology of astrocytes were also observed . This frozen section, from the cerebral grey matter of a mouse with acute encephalomyelitis shows a large, reactive astrocyte (arrowheads) infected with MHV-JHM . A few isolated, uninfected astrocytic processes are also evident . The section is from a 15-day-old suckling mouse born to an unimmunized dam and inoculated at 10 days of life . This section was counterstained with hematoxylin .

The processes of one of these astrocytes also contained viral antigen (small arrowheads) . The majority of infected cells in all mice resembled this latter cell, although associated astrocytic processes were usually not apparent . Also shown in this figure are several uninfected astrocytes with typical morphology (one is marked with an arrow) . This section was very lightly stained with hematoxylin so that the nuclei of GFAP-negative cells are not apparent .

Asymptomatic mice born to immunized dams A large fraction (60%) of the mice born to immunized dams and inoculated with virus developed no clinical disease . Viral antigen was present in only a few cells, and the percentage of virus positive cells also positive for GFAP varied greatly between mice, ranging from 0% to slightly over 50% (Table 1) . Positive cells were usually isolated and were not surrounded by an inflammatory response, although occasional small clusters of infected cells were observed . The infected astrocytes were present for the most part in the cerebral grey matter . As in the mice with the acute encephalomyelitis, some of the infected cells had the typical morphology of astrocytes but the majority were small cells which were less intensively stained for GFAP ( Fig . 1 (C) and (D) ) .",

In some mice however, sections from different portions of the brain were analyzed and showed similar percentages of infected astrocytes, suggesting that in some cases, the different percentages reflected biological differences between infected animals . Alternatively, it is possible that a higher percentage of astrocytes was infected in all mice, but that G FAP was no longer detectable in many of the infected cells as they degenerated .",

Specifically, we showed that suckling C57BL/6 mice born to dams immunized with MHV-JHM were protected against the acute, invariably fatal, encephalomyelitis .' However, 40% of the mice developed a symptomatic, demyelinating encephalomyelitis with extensive destruction in the white matter of the brainstem and spinal cord at 35 days post infection (p . i .) (range 23-60 days p .i .) . Viral antigen could be detected in most mice, whether symptomatic or not, although virus could only be isolated from mice with clinical disease .Author to whom correspondence should be addressed . 0882-4010/87/010309+06 $03 .00/0",
