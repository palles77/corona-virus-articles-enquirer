It has been estimated that viruses that target sea-dwelling organisms, such as algae, turn over half of the world' s biomass each day. As such, viruses are an important part of the ecological balance on earth. Of the vast collection of ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) viruses, research has focused on the tiny fraction that cause disease in humans, domestic animals, and crops. Modern virology, coupled with public health initiatives, has seen many triumphs including the development of effective vaccines against yellow fever, poliomyelitis, smallpox, mumps, measles, rubella, hepatitis A and B, and papillomavirus-associated cervical cancer. The global eradication of smallpox and poliovirus as well as the prediction and successful prophylactic vaccination against influenza represent tremendous gains for public health. Antiviral therapy against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and some herpesviruses, as well as rapid detection and containment of emerging viruses such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) illustrate the successful application of viral research programs as well as the need for ongoing efforts focused on rapid identification and elucidation of viral distribution, kinetics, and pathogenesis. With the growth of knowledge about replication, transmission, and disease, viruses have also taken the stage as possible biowarfare, bioterrorist, and criminal agents.",

The purpose of this chapter is to introduce basic concepts in virology and to provide several examples of how current technology has been used to identify and track viral pathogens. The first part of the chapter discusses virus structure, replication strategies, classification, and evolution. The second part highlights the varied modes of transmission, infection, and disease manifestations as they relate to the different diagnostic methods for virus identification. We follow this with examples of how emerging viruses were identified and tracked (Sin Nombre, Nipah, West Nile, SARS coronavirus, and monkeypox). With regard to viral forensics, the Schmidt case is a fascinating example illustrating how the study of RNA virus evolution and relatedness was used in a criminal investigation. Finally, we provide a few snapshot views into new technologies that allow the creation of manmade or \"engineered'' viruses, some exciting new frontiers in viral diagnostics, and a few thoughts on the future of virology.",

Virus particles are either enveloped or nonenveloped. Enveloped viruses contain one or more envelope glycoproteins embedded in a lipid bilayer that is acquired by budding through host cell membranes. Nonenveloped viruses are made up of a tight protein shell. In both kinds of viral particles, the envelope or protein shell serves to protect the viral genome from the hazardous extracellular environment, since without such protection, the fragile nucleic acid genome would be vulnerable to physical, chemical, and/or enzymatic destruction. Surface proteins also harbor functions required for virus entry into host cells. Inside the virus particle, the viral genome is associated with one or more proteins to form a complex usually referred to as the nucleocapsid. In addition to nucleic acid binding proteins, some viruses also carry enzymes required to initiate replication (like polymerases). Although not all virus particles are highly structured, two kinds of symmetry are common. Helical symmetry is reflected by the arrangement of the protein subunits in a \"spring-like'' or stacked lockwasher fashion, whereas icosahedral symmetry comprises 20 triangular faces that form the surface of a sphere. In the simplest icosahedral capsid, one protein subunit is at each triangular point of the 20 faces, requiring 60 total subunits.",

            "text": "Among the enormous variety of host cell types, how does a virus choose which cell to commandeer for its own replication and propagation? The surface of an enveloped virus particle contains virus-specific proteins that mediate viral recognition of host cell targets. The membrane surface of a host cell is riddled with numerous macromolecules including glycoproteins, glycolipids, and carbohydrate residues that have specific host functions serving as transport channels, mediating signaling pathways, and assisting in antigen presentation. While these macromolecules may be essential for host cell survival and function, some of these macromolecules also serve as receptors for virus particles. The presence of the host cell receptor is essential for viral attachment, but the mere presence of the receptor does not confer upon the cell the ability to support virus replication. Some viruses (such as HIV) require a coreceptor for viral entry without which the virus may be able to bind to the host cell membrane but remain unable to enter the cell. If the virus is not enveloped or is a naked particle, the viral capsid undergoes a conformational change upon binding that releases energy used to breach the host membrane, allowing viral entry. Delivery of viral nucleocapsid, and hence the genome RNA or DNA, occurs via fusion of the virus particle with cellular membrane either at the cell surface or after endocytosis. Virus genome replication can occur either in the cytoplasm or the nucleus, and all viruses usurp the host cell translational machinery to produce virus-specific proteins.",

Virologists have devised classification systems to describe and identify viruses based on observed similarities and differences. Initially, the decision of how to classify a virus was rooted in understanding the host and tissue infected by the virus, the resultant disease process, and the method of transmission. As technology advanced, the classification criteria shifted to include physical properties such as virion morphology, stability, filterability, and antigenicity. With the development of negative-staining electron microscopy that allowed scientists to visualize the virus particle, the classification of viruses changed to comprise descriptions of virion size, morphology, and surface characteristics. Finally, technological advances including polymerase chain reaction (PCR), DNA sequencing, monoclonal antibody production, and DNA microchip analysis have allowed researchers to differentiate between single-nucleotide changes present in viral genomes. The complete genomes of numerous viruses have been sequenced, allowing for the identification of species, strains, and mutants that could never before have been possible. When very little information is known about an emerging infection, the classification system and its wealth of descriptive information is useful; predicting possible routes of transmission and pathogenic consequences based on information known about similar well-studied and previously classified viruses may significantly impact public health practices while the new etiologic agent is under study.",

Large DNA viruses can not only recombine with each other but also contain genes usurped from the host. RNA tumor viruses have incorporated cellular oncogenes that lead to transformation in some cell types. For RNA viruses, recombination probably occurs via incomplete synthesis and template RNA switching during negative-strand synthesis. This process occurs with high frequency in poliovirus infection, with an estimated 10%-20% of poliovirus genomic RNA recombining in a single growth cycle. 5 In polio eradication efforts, a live virus preparation consisting of three separate attenuated poliovirus strains was used. Despite the safety of each attenuated strain, some vaccinated patients did develop poliomyelitis. Through genetic testing of patient isolates, it became clear that the recovered virus was not the same as the administered vaccine, and that neurovirulence had been restored by recombination among the three attenuated strains. [6] [7] Reassortment can also occur when two related viruses with segmented genomes infect a single cell. For example, reassortment is responsible for gen-erating new influenza A strains that are antigenically different enough from previous strains to infect and cause disease. Besides the annual flu season, severe pandemics have occurred such as the Spanish flu of 1918, the Asian flu of 1957, the Hong Kong flu of 1968, and the Russian flu of 1977. 8 Influenza virus infects several animal hosts, including humans, pigs, horses, and its natural reservoir, waterfowl. The two major antigenic proteins of this virus, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NP), can be reassorted between different influenza viruses, generating new strains different from the two parental strains (called antigenic shift). Each influenza strain is given a code which identifies its HA and NP proteins. The Spanish flu was caused by the H1N1 strain, the Asian flu was strain H2N2, the Hong Kong flu was strain H3N2, and the Russian flu was strain H1N1. 9",

Effector T cells specific for virus antigen stimulate B cells to secrete virus-specific antibodies. There are two predominate types of antibodies produced in response to virus infection, IgM and IgG. The first antibody produced is the IgM isotype and is present in the blood within days and remains in circulation for several months. As the adaptive response develops, B cells switch antibody isotypes to secrete the IgG form. Investigators use the detection of antibodies as indicators of virus exposure, and can utilize knowledge of the presence of specific isotypes to discern acute infection from past or chronic infection. Detection of IgM or rising titers of IgG points to a recent virus exposure. Virus-specific antibodies are also used as tools in numerous serological assays.

The virus concentration varies in the body over the course of infection and may actually not be present when symptoms bring the patient to medical attention. The virus may have been cleared from the area of disease, or the symptoms may reflect damage induced by the immune system rather than direct virus pathology. It is therefore critical to obtain samples early in the infection and from multiple locations in the body. The most common site to look for virus is in the blood. Other clinical samples are generally collected near the site of virus-induced disease or based on known routes of virus transmission. Mosquitoes can deposit West Nile virus and dengue into the skin; poxvirus and papillomavirus replication can create lesions and warts; the perfuse spread of Ebola allows detection even in the skin. For respiratory infections, samples may include nasal and throat swabs as well as nasopharyngeal aspirates and bronchial lavage fluids. Urine and stool samples are collected for enteric disease, and cerebral spinal fluid is obtained when neurological symptoms are present. Viruses may be very labile, and care must be taken to avoid exposure to harsh treatments such as extreme pH, direct sunlight, and freezing temperatures in order to preserve the potential for identification and study. Generally, samples are transported on ice and evaluated in the lab as quickly as possible.

Continuously replicating cell lines are the most convenient, with an infinite capacity to be passaged. Human specimens are clarified and treated with antibiotics before addition to cell culture. The inoculated cells are monitored for any detectable morphologic changes and periodically harvested for other serological assays. There are specific culture conditions for particular viruses. For instance, viruses from the conjunctiva, nasal and respiratory tracts are incubated at cooler temperatures resembling the exterior of the body, and viruses entering cells via fusion proteins requiring cleavage need to have trypsin added to the culture media. Some viruses cannot be cultivated in cell lines but require that clinical samples be injected into suckling mice by specially trained personnel and examined for virus using serological methods.

Viruses frequently infect animal or insect vectors that serve to pass the virus to humans. By identifying the virus through sequence analysis, a hypothetical reservoir can be predicted by the placement of the sequence on the phylogenetic tree, since viruses that share a mode of transmission often cluster together. More than one type of vector may be used within the same family of viruses, but individual members depend on a particular vector. Viruses from the family Bunyaviridae can be transmitted to humans by such pests as ticks, mosquitoes, flies, and rodents. The particular vector utilized often distinguishes individual subgroups within the family. Phylogenetic trees have been instrumental in proving virus transmission through family members, hospital settings, and susceptible members of a population. By comparing the virus sequence isolated from a patient to virus sequences isolated from individuals in the population transmission routes can be deduced. For example, it can be concluded that a doctor became infected from a patient seen at a hospital rather than from the general community if the virus sequences from doctor and patient are more similar than sequences found in the population.",

Viruses isolated from reservoirs in different geographic locations can define where people became infected. Arenaviruses are carried by rodents, but domestic rodents are often responsible for causing infections rather than rodents found in the fields or forests. By analyzing virus sequences obtained from infected patients and from house, field, and forest mice, the group of mice serving as a reservoir can be determined, and public health measures to prevent rodents from entering homes can be implemented. The origin of a virus outbreak can involve larger geographic areas. As the SARS outbreak demonstrates, importation of new viruses is an increasing global health concern. By accessing a database of virus genomes from around the world, a new virus outbreak could be rapidly identified as having been imported from another land. As viruses travel, some viruses become endemic, and it is necessary to distinguish between endemic and imported outbreaks to allow appropriate control measures to function. Viruses may also cause seasonal outbreaks. Influenza varies its genome with each year of infection. By understanding the extent to which the virus alters its genome from year to year, phylogenetic analysis assists in predicting the next year' s strain and allows scientists to begin production for the upcoming yearly vaccine.",

            "text": "In May 1993, a clinician reported a cluster of cases presenting with nonspecific illness, fever, headache, and cough that rapidly progressed to respiratory distress. The patients were young, previously healthy, and lived in rural areas in the four-corners region bordering Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Utah. By early June 1993, 24 cases had been reported with a mortality rate approximately 75%. 11, 12 Patient blood and autopsy tissues were sent to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for investigation. Diagnostic assays failed to identify known causes of respiratory illness; however, patient samples cross-reactived with antibodies to four different hantaviruses. Using hantavirus sera, immunohistochemistry detected hantavirus antigen in autopsy tissue from the lung and other involved organs. 13 Hantaviruses are RNA viruses with a genome in three segments and a member of the family Bunyaviridae. Previous outbreaks of hantaviruses involved patients with renal disease leading to hemorrhagic complications, not respiratory distress. Hantaviruses are classified into four antigenic groups, and each strain of hantavirus is tightly associated with a specific rodent host. Although hantaviruses have a worldwide distribution, the dependence on a particular species of rodent host restricts the geographical range. Hantaan (HTN) is associated with the field mouse in Korea, China, and eastern Russia and causes hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS). Seoul (SEO) causes moderate disease in Korea and China and is associated with urbanized rats. A milder form of HFRS is caused by the serogroup Puumula (PUU) in Scandinavia and Europe and is transmitted by the bank vole. At the time of the four-corners outbreak, the only North American hantavirus identified was Prospect Hill (PH), which was detected in two rodent isolates of meadow voles and not associated with any human illness. Patient samples from the U.S. four-corners region cross-reacted with hantavirus antigen and allowed epidemiologists to expand their assays to include RT-PCR and narrow the search for the host to local rodents. The virus was unable to be cultured from patient samples; therefore, molecular identification was crucial for identification. Partial sequences were available for HTN, SEO, PUU, and PH in a database and used to design PCR primers based on conserved areas of the virus glycoprotein. Nucleic acid was extracted from autopsy tissue, and a PCR product was detected in two cases using primer pairs based on PUU and PH. The PCR product was sequenced, revealing a 70% sequence similarity between the new virus and PH and PUU. 14 New primers were designed and could detect products in all current cases. The sequence of the new virus was identified, and the nucleocapsid protein was expressed in bac-teria and purified and used as a recombinant antigen in other serological assays. 15 The new virus was eventually named Sin Nombre virus (SNV).",

The predominant species was the field mouse, Peromyscus maniculitis, and approximately 30% had anti-hantavirus antibodies detected in an IgG ELISA. PCR revealed that 82% had detectable virus in the blood, indicating high viremia even in the presence of circulating antibodies. Sequences from rodent and human cases isolated in the four states were aligned, and identical nucleotide substitutions were present in the rodent and human cases from the same location, indicating that transmission occurred from the field mouse to the human cases. 14 Transmission occurred by inhalation of aerosolized rodent urine. Ecologists reported an increase in the population of field mice during that year due to a surplus food supply. The arid conditions of the southwest and the close proximity of the mice and the patients also contributed to transmission. In this outbreak, there were no reports of human-human transmission. 16 The discovery of SNV led to a heightened awareness and search for other American hantaviruses. Field investigations and retrospective serological studies identified additional hantaviruses in North America. 17 The North American viruses show an 80%-95% similarity, but are always found only in their specific rodent species. 18 The detection of the new hantaviruses is enhanced by the use of diagnostic reagents developed in this outbreak and refined as new viruses are identified. Additional cases have also been detected in South America. In 1995, Andes virus was isolated in Argentina, the only documented case of human-human transmission. 19 Hantavirus outbreaks have also been identified in Chile, Paraguay, Bolivia, and Brazil, causing both respiratory illness and some renal hemorrhagic disease.

            "text": "After the SNV outbreak, efforts increased to study the relationships between hantaviruses and the rodent hosts worldwide. Phylogenetic analysis of rodent and human virus sequences has shown a close evolutionary relationship, and hantaviruses are often used as models of coevolution. A particular genotype of hantavirus persistently infects one species of rodent even though other rodent hosts may be present in the same environment. This remarkable coexistence has been mapped through changing landscapes. As a rodent species radiates farther away into another habitat, it may evolve into a separate, but genetically similar, species. The hitchhiker hantavirus also evolves with the rodent host, becoming genetically distinct from viruses associated with the ancestral species. This ancient relationship has been mapped using phylogenetic trees, which display common ancestral species as clusters that diverge and separate with geographical and genetic distance. The topology of the rodent tree can be compared and reveals similar patterns with topology of the associated hantaviruses. 20 Phylogenies have been performed on rodent family, subfamily, genus, and species using mitochondrial DNA. Phylogenetic trees of hantaviruses reveal a similar branching pattern to the rodent tree. Viruses that infect the same subfamily of rodents form identical clades, and closely related hantaviruses are grouped in the same tree pattern as their rodent reservoirs. Although rare, there have been instances of transmission of one virus to another rodent species. This provides another example of molecular evolution where virus segments can mix in the host and form reassorted viruses containing combinations of different virus segments. This can contribute to genetic diversity. Reassortment of the segmented genome has been found in nature and in mixed virus infections in tissue culture, but only between very closely related viruses. 21 Phylogenetic analysis performed on more than one virus segment tests for the chance of reassortment. Even in geographical locations where different rodent species may overlap, virus-host switching and reassortment are very rare events. Each hantavirus is associated with a primary rodent host, and usually a particular rodent species will be the primary reservoir of a single hantavirus. The tight correlation of virus and rodent host in the phylogenetic trees supports the concept of coevolution between virus and host. All subfamilies of the family Muridae have a hantavirus-rodent relationship. Fossil records estimate the rodent families Muridae to have split into the current subfamilies during the Miocene period, indicating that hantaviruses have been associated with their rodent hosts for 30 million years, an association that began before the division of the rodent family. 22 The coevolutionary relationship and worldwide distribution of hantavirus illustrates that the 1993 SNV outbreak was not due to the emergence of a new virus or virus with an increased virulence, but simply the detection of an ancient virus.",

            "text": "Between the autumn of 1998 and spring of 1999, an outbreak of acute fever with encephalitis occurred in peninsular Malaysia and Singapore, with 265 cases resulting in 105 deaths. The outbreak was associated with a respiratory illness of pigs, and the primary human cases were individuals who had close contact or occupational exposure to pigs. 23 The initial report was released in late September 1998, attributing the cause of illness to mosquito-borne Japanese encephalitis virus (JE). JE is endemic to the region and was believed to involve pigs as amplifiers of virus. Ministries of Health began mosquito control measures and vaccination campaigns to block JE infection. 24 By February 1999, the outbreak continued to spread as pigs were moved from the western-central region in the state of Perak to three other farms located in the southern states of Selangor and Negri Sembilan, the largest pig-rearing areas in Southeast Asia. Pigs were also exported to two farms in Singapore and resulted in 11 cases and two deaths. Singapore suspended pig importation from Malaysia, and no more cases were reported. Epidemiological analysis discredited JE as the infectious agent of the outbreak, since communities located near the pig farms did not become infected and immunization and vector control programs were having no effect on the increase of cases. As the outbreak continued, new attempts were made to find the pathogen. 25 In March 1999, a virus was isolated by inoculating CSF obtained from fatal cases into Vero cells. The presence of multinucleate syncytia in infected cell culture implicated a paramyxovirus. Thin-section EM detected filamentous nucleocapsids with the hallmark herringbone pattern and also captured virus budding from the plasma membrane, both characteristic of paramyxoviruses. 26 The new virus was named Nipah. A fortuitous event in the identification of the virus was the observed cross-reactivity between sera against Nipah and the paramyxovirus, Hendra virus. No other paramyxovirus sera reacted with Nipah samples. 25 Hendra virus was identified in 1994 as the cause of respiratory illness in three regions of Queensland, Australia, resulting in the deaths of thoroughbred horses. A horse owner also died of respiratory distress and a stable-hand was infected, but survived. Another individual who assisted with a horse autopsy became ill with a meningitis-like infection and recovered (temporarily), but one year later developed progressive neurological complications and eventually died. 27 Hendra virus was isolated from his CSF. To test for other potential infections, reagents for an IgM and IgG ELISA and antibodies for IHC were developed.",

Most of the pigs in case farms were IgG-positive for Nipah, yet only a minority displayed any illness and only 5% were fatal. 28 Pigs had a definite respiratory disease comprising a distinctive cough with some developing encephalitis. The primary mode of transmission was suspected to be from respiratory secretions and aerosolized droplets from infected pigs. Domesticated dogs and cats, a few ponies, and bats also tested positive for Nipah. Human autopsy results revealed that the primary pathology was secondary to multiorgan vasculitis due to infected endothelium where multinucleate syncytia with viral antigen were detected. The cerebral cortex and brainstem were also damaged, and neurons were found to have virus inclusion bodies. Nipah antigen was also detected, but to a lesser extent in the lungs, heart, kidney, and spleen, consistent with a systemic infection. 26 An RT-PCR assay was developed using degenerate paramyxovirus primers annealing to the P gene. Sequencing revealed a 78% similarity between Nipah and Hendra, but less than 50% identity to other members of the Paramyx ovirinae subfamily. 29 The Paramyxoviridae family is divided into two subfamilies, the Paramyxovirinae and the Pneumovirinae. The Paramyxovirinae is separated into three genera; however, phylogenetic analysis did not cluster Nipah and Hendra into any one of the three genera.

And last, this case illustrates that virus distribution can be tracked by monitoring those infected as well as its vector.",

The controversy continued as other independent researchers believed the virus to be Kunjin virus, another closely related arbovirus. 36 It was later confirmed that the agent was indeed WNV through independent genetic testing by the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID). 33 The cause for confusion was due to the close relationship between WNV and SLE. Both flavivirieses share significant similarity in their envelope proteins and some antibodies cross-react. Another compounding factor was that WNV had never been seen before in the U.S., although it was responsible for outbreaks in other geographic locations, including Africa, Europe, and the Middle East.",

RT-PCR methods for detecting WNV-specific RNA have been used extensively for detection in tissues and CSF. Blood banks now use RT-PCR to screen the blood supplies, due to the high incidence of asymptomatic WNV-infected donors: 23 persons have been reported to have been infected with WNV after receiving transfusions from 16 WNV-infected blood donors. 38, 39 West Nile virus was also identified as the agent responsible for the deaths of birds observed throughout the New York area. This has become a very important observation, for geographical mapping of the dead birds is valuable for tracking WNV infection as it continues to spread to other states and countries. The CDC stated: \"dead-bird-based surveillance has proven to be the most sensitive method for detecting WNV presence in an area.'' However the CDC goes on to state \"mosquito-based surveillance remains the primary tool for quantifying the intensity of virus transmission in an area, and should remain the mainstay in most surveillance programs for WNV and other arboviruses.'' In addition to mosquito and dead-bird surveillance, the CDC as well as state organizations tracked live birds, equine WNV infections, and obvious human infections. These data showed that the virus was continuing to spread westward (Figure 4 .5). Computer-assisted tracking services like Arbonet and the U.S. Department of the Interior website, 40 provide up-to-date tracking information.

            "text": "In November 2002, several hundred cases of severe, atypical pneumonia were reported from the Guangdong province in southern China. An infected medical doctor from Guangdong carried the virus to Hong Kong, where he stayed for one night on the 9th floor of the Hotel Metropole. Subsequently, at least 16 guests and visitors to the 9th floor of the hotel became infected and spread the illness to Vietnam, Singapore, and Canada. Hospitals became new epicenters of infection as health care workers and family members became infected. In March 2003, the World Health Organization (WHO) recognized that SARS had become a worldwide health threat, and released a global alert on travel to screen air passengers departing from affected areas. Cases of suspected SARS continued to be reported in new areas including Thailand, Europe, the United Kingdom, and the U.S., but the most heavily affected areas were in China and Hong Kong. In early April, the virus was isolated and identified as a novel coronavirus, SARS-associated coronavirus, or SARS-CoV. The numbers of cases increased at a staggering pace with over 5,000 cases on April 28, 6,000 cases on May 2, and 7,000 cases on May 8 from over 30 countries on six continents. 42 Travel warnings were issued for Toronto, Canada, where an imported case of SARS established an outbreak in a hospital with over 100 cases, which subsequently spilled over into the community. Travel restrictions also applied to Beijing and Guangdong, China and Hong Kong. Although transmission was assumed to be primarily from secreted virus in respiratory fluids, another mode of transmission was found in an outbreak in a Hong Kong apartment building. Improper plumbing in the Amoy Gardens apartment complex probably allowed virus-contaminated sewage to be introduced into the water supply, resulting in almost 300 cases from one building. Epidemiologists began to link a few individuals as sources responsible for infecting a large number of people. These \"super spreaders'' are individuals who for unknown reasons were capable of transmitting infection to over 100 people. In Singapore, one individual traveling from the Hotel Metropole was credited for infecting 103 out of 203 cases. Despite these few instances, transmission was primarily due to close contact with infected individuals and remained in the hospital epicenters where import cases had harbored the virus. Rarely, secondary outbreaks in the community occurred. This required containment measures to be enacted. Local authorities began voluntary and mandatory quarantine procedures and eventually, the number of new cases began declining. Officials declared regions to be free of SARS when no new cases were identified after 20 days, twice the time of an incubation period. By early July 2003, there were no new cases of SARS reported. As of September 2003, WHO reported an estimated 8,098 cases and 774 deaths from the SARS-CoV. 43 The rapid identification of a virus as the etiologic agent of SARS allowed public health officials to address the public on how to kill the virus, any treatment options, and use knowledge of other animal coronaviruses to form hypotheses regarding origin and transmission. The virus was isolated by inoculation of Vero E6 and NCI-H292 cells from an oropharyngeal specimen obtained from a fatally infected SARS patient. 44 The cells showed CPE with cell rounding in focal areas that were refractile to light. The infected cell cultures were treated for thin-section and negative-stain electron microscopy, where the particles were detected with the distinctive halo of the Coronaviri dae (Figure 4.3) . Investigators were extremely fortunate to have an isolate propagating and causing an obvious cytopathic effect in cell culture. Coronaviruses are notorious for being difficult to culture, requiring specific cell lines with supplements, organ culture, or animals. The characteristic particles identified using electron microscopy enabled researchers to swiftly focus on a specific virus group. Coronaviridae have three serological groups. Using infected Vero cells as a source of SARS-CoV antigen, antibodies specific for each coronavirus group were tested. Only antibodies from group I recognized SARS-CoV-infected cells. Antibodies from groups I, II, and III all failed to detect virus antigen in autopsy samples despite the presence of syncytial cells and other signs of pathology. Infected Vero cells were again used as antigen to detect the presence of SARS-CoV antibodies from patient samples. Patient sera with high titers of SARS-CoV-specific antibodies were used to develop an ELISA. SARS-CoV antibodies were later raised in animals injected with virus infected cell culture. Random samples from the population did not have detectable IgG antibodies, implying that SARS-CoV had not previously been circulating and instead was a newly emerged virus. 44 The SARS-CoV was also identified using RT-PCR with a broadly reactive primer set designed based on the polymerase gene. The entire genome was sequenced and phylogenetically compared to other coronaviruses. SARS-CoV was placed equidistant from all other animal and human coronaviruses in all gene regions. This implied that the SARS-CoV did not arise from recombination from any known coronavirus, nor did it help identify the host. To verify SARS-CoV as the actual agent responsible for disease, two cynomolgus macaques were inoculated with a Vero cell culture infected with serum from a fatal SARS case. SARS-CoV was detected in nasal secretions and fecal material by RT-PCR and immunofluorescence. The virus sequence was identical to the inoculated virus. 45 Histopathology showed cell damage in the lungs, and both macaques seroconverted, proving Koch' s postulate for SARS-CoV as the causative agent. 46 With SARS worldwide, the number of samples requiring diagnostics grew. Designation of SARS-CoV as a biosafety level 3 virus required specialized laboratories, so the WHO coordinated diagnostic labs from nine countries to work together to standardize diagnostic assays, supply similar reagents, ensure proper equipment availability, and analyze results in a comparable manner. Communication was vital with daily teleconferences, secure web sites, and exchange of patient samples and autopsy materials. 43 The SARS epidemic demonstrates how a delay in reporting and an incorrect diagnosis can allow an epidemic to spread. Initially, the Chinese government misdiagnosed the infectious agent as Chlamydia and underestimated the ease of transmission and potential dispersal throughout the region. Epidemiologists from the WHO were not permitted into the Guangdong province until May 2003, but by then the virus had spread all over the globe. Investigators were distracted by reports of fatalities from a virulent strain of avian influenza, which had resurfaced in Hong Kong in late February 2003. Also, the human metapneumovirus, which also causes respiratory illness, had been identified in cell cultures inoculated with some samples from SARS patients. It was later concluded that the newly identified coronavirus was responsible for SARS, and the metapneumovirus was simply circulating concurrently in some populations.",

The CDC confirmed cases using a variety of laboratory techniques including propagation in tissue culture, PCR, immunohistochemical testing, and/or EM. 48 Monkeypox virus got its name when it was first discovered in 1958, after several laboratory monkeys became infected with the virus. There have been few reports of this virus, which is native to rainforest regions of Central and Western Africa. However, in 1996-1997 an outbreak occurred in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where monkeypox was positively identified in 72 cases spanning thirteen villages. 49 The virus has been found to infect native squirrels, shrews, monkeys, and Gambian rats among other animals representing 14 species. 48 The cause of the epidemic is a result of handling or consuming contaminated bush meat and foodstuffs. The virus was spread most likely through person-to-person contact, due to closequarters habitation. Of the cases documented, six deaths occurred, accounting for a 3% case-fatality rate. 49 In the U.S. outbreak several states linked the purchases of the prairie dogs to particular pet stores. The trace-back investigation revealed all of these pet stores purchased prairie dogs from a distributor in Illinois. Through PCR-based genetic testing, the CDC uncovered prairie dogs at the Illinois dealer tested positive for monkeypox. How did these prairie dogs become infected with a virus native to Africa? This distributor, on April 21, 2003, received a shipment of African Gambian rats and dormice. These were then tested by the CDC, and found to be infected with the virus. Investigators then were able to track the rodent shipment to a Texas distributor, which was the initial point of entry for several rodent species imported from Ghana on April 9, 2003 . Several of these imported animals were infected with monkeypox. Finally a source for the monkeypox entry into the U.S. was located. A schematic illustration of the trace-back investigation is shown in Figure 4 .7.",

Schmidt. 50 The uncontested facts in this case are that a gastroenterologist from Lafayette, Louisiana broke into the home of his former mistress and office nurse late at night on August 4, 1994 , and that he argued with her and gave her an intramuscular injection. He claimed it was a vitamin B shot. She claimed it was HIV. She had begun feeling ill several months after the injection, and a blood test in January 1995 revealed that she had become infected with HIV. She was a periodic blood donor, and based on tests of those previous blood donations, had a clear record without prior infection. She did not engage in any behaviors placing her at high risk for infection, and her sexual contacts over the previous nine years all tested negative for HIV. He was a community leader and Vietnam War veteran. Schmidt admitted to having a long-term affair with her, but maintained the infection was not his doing. She went to the District Attorney' s office to file charges on learning that she was HIV-positive. Moving quickly, the DA' s detectives obtained a search warrant and proceeded to the accused physician' s office, where they seized his record books for blood samples drawn from patients and a vial of blood sitting in the refrigerator in a back room in his office. This was unusual; patients' blood samples were sent to the lab soon after being drawn, and none were routinely stored there. The physician claimed that this sample, drawn from one of his HIV-positive patients, was for his own use and research. Was the physician telling the truth? Might this blood sample link the physician to his nurse assistant and former mistress' infection? The next logical step in the investigation would clearly be phylogenetic analyses. Phylogenetic analyses of viral DNAs showing little or no relationship between HIV lineages from the nurse and the alleged source (the blood vial seized from the physicians office) could help demonstrate the physician' s innocence, whereas a close, sister relationship among those lineages, in the context of an epidemiological sampling of HIV, would be consistent with the physician' s alleged role in transmission.",

This analyses does provide more direct evidence about the direction of infection, with the clear implication that viruses from the alleged source were used to infect the victim. Viral lineages from the alleged source diverged prior to divergences among the victim' s viruses.

Over the last 30 years, the recombinant DNA revolution has changed virology forever. Besides its impact on our ability to study specific viral nucleic acids and proteins, recombinant DNA technology (and PCR) sped up our ability to determine complete viral genomic sequences and create specific viral variants. The ability of scientists to engineer novel viruses varies greatly. Small positive-strand RNA viruses of bacteria, plants, and animals provided some of the first examples where infectious virus was produced via recombinant DNA. More recently, it has also become possible to engineer the >29-kb RNA genome of coronaviruses and both monopartite and segmented negative-strand RNA viruses. Viruses in the family Reoviridae, with double-stranded RNA genomes, have proven more difficult. For herpesviruses, whose genomic DNA is infectious, the same technologies used for cloning large pieces of chromosomal DNA have been applied successfully to propagate overlapping fragments of entire herpesvirus genomes. For the poxviruses, whose genomic DNA is not infectious, recombinant viruses are generated within infected cells by homologous DNA recombination between a plasmid containing the engineered segment and an infecting parental virus.",

Viruses are usually highly adapted to a particular niche, and most mutations are deleterious. Propagation of pathogenic viruses in cell culture often leads to adaptation to that environment and attenuation in their animal host. Recombinants or chimeras between even closely related viruses are usually impaired relative to either parent. We do see examples, however, of viruses that are benign in one animal host but highly pathogenic in another species. This is often the case in epizootic emerging viruses. An extreme example of host species-specific pathogenesis is the myxoma poxvirus, which causes a benign cutaneous fibroma in wild rabbits of the Americas but a highly lethal disease in the European rabbit. This virus was used for biological control of feral European rabbits in Europe and Australia. In 2001, an Australian group published a paper describing the construction of recombinant mousepox virus expression interleukin-4 (IL-4) and its pathogenesis in mice. 54 This study provides a striking and sobering example of an engineered virus with enhanced pathogenicity. IL-4 is a cytokine that regulates the immune response at various levels. The recombinant mousepox virus suppressed both innate and adaptive immune responses that normally control infection and was lethal for otherwise genetically resistant mice. Moreover, even animals that had been previously vaccinated and protected from virulent mousepox were susceptible to lethal infection by the mousepox-IL-4 recombinant virus. This study raises obvious concerns about the efficacy of current vaccination against modified versions of the smallpox virus.",
