            "text": "The aim of this study was to decipher the molecular epidemiological and antigenic characteristics of infectious bronchitis virus strains (IBVs) isolated in recent years in southwestern China. A total of 24 field strains were isolated from diseased chickens between 2012 and 2016. Phylogenetic analysis based on S1 nucleotide sequences showed that 16 of the 24 isolates were clustered into four distinct genotypes: QX (37.5%), TW (16.7%, TWI and TWII), Mass (8.3%), and J2 (4.2%). The QX genotype was still the prevalent genotype in southwestern China. Recombination analysis of the S1 subunit gene showed that eight of the 24 field strains were recombinant variants that originated from field strains and vaccine strains. A new potential recombination hotspot [ATTTT(T/A)] was identified, implying that recombination events may become more and more common. The antigenicity of ten IBVs, including seven field strains and commonly used vaccine strains, were assayed with a viral cross-neutralization assay in chicken embryonated kidney cells (CEK). The results showed that the ten IBVs could be divided into four serotypes (Massachusetts, 793B, Sczy3, and SCYB). Sczy3 and 793B were the predominant serotypes. Six of the seven field isolates (all except for cK/CH/SCYB/140913) cross-reacted well with anti-sera against other field strains. In conclusion, the genetic and antigenic features of IBVs from southwestern China in recent years have changed when compared to the previous reports. The results could provide a reference for vaccine development and the prevention of infectious bronchitis in southwestern China.",

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly contagious disease in chickens that causes significant economic losses to the worldwide poultry industry (Colvero et al., 2015) . The etiologic agent of IB is the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a member of the Coronaviridae family, in the subfamily coronaviridae and genus gamma-coronavirus. The IBV genome is 27.6 kb and encodes at least four structural proteins, including the spike glycoprotein (S), membrane protein (M), small membrane protein (E), and nucleocapsid protein (N) (Ujike and Taguchi, 2015) . The major immunogen of IBV is the S1 subunit protein, which contains epitopes that can induce the production of specific neutralizing antibodies and the hemagglutination inhibition antibody. IBVs from different serotypes usually exhibit poor cross-protection (Li et al., 2012) . Due to the incomplete proofreading mechanism of the RNA polymerase and the gene recombination during genome replication, IBV genomes are constantly evolving, and new IBV variant strains are always arising (Baker and Lai, 1990; Lai, 1992) .",

Although the wide use of vaccine strains, such as H120, M41, 28/86, 4/91, and ma5, has successfully prevented IB epidemics on most farms, immune failure is still reported frequently as the result of infections with strains that differ serologically from the vaccine strains. Therefore, continuing analysis of the genetic evolution and antigenic relatedness among field isolates and vaccine strains may provide critical insight for vaccine strain selection and vaccine development. Our previous study revealed that isolates obtained between 2008 and 2009 from the Sichuan province belonged mainly to a group of QX-like strains (79% QX-type; 5% TWI-type) (Zou et al., 2010) . In a later report from other researchers, QX-type and TWI-type IBVs accounted for 37% and 37%, respectively, in Sichuan area during 2011-2012 . While in Southern China, picture was quite different, cK/CH/LSC/99Itype was the predominant genotype and no QX-type strains were isolated during 2013 (Mo et al., 2013) . So the genetic character of IBVs from China varied according to time and regions. For the antigenic features of IBVs isolated in recent years from China, less attention was given. A report showed that 28 IBVs from Guangxi of China in 2009- Infection, Genetics and Evolution 45 (2016) ",

Another report showed the serotype of TWI-type strains were different from Mass-type in Taiwan in 2000 (Wang and Huang, 2000) .

After filter sterilizing with a 0.22 \u03bcm filter membrane, 0.2 mL sample was inoculated into the allantoic cavity of 9-to 11-day-old SPF embryos. The embryos were incubated at 37\u00b0C and examined twice daily for their viability. The allantoic fluids were harvested after 36 h incubation, and three blind passages were conducted. The presence of IBV was verified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of the N gene (Zou et al., 2010) . The existence of other five pathogens, H9 subtype Avian influenza virus (H9 AIV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), Marek's disease virus (MDV), bacteria and Coccidiosis in those samples were verified by following the methods of other reports (Abu-Akkada and Awad, 2012; Chen et al., 2012; Li et al., 2010; Rui et al., 2010; Tian et al., 2011) .",

The major genotype circulating around the world, however, is the QX type. In our study, 24 IBVs were isolated from H120-and 4/91-vaccinated chickens. Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 gene showed that those 24 IBVs could be primarily grouped into four genotypes, with QX-type strains (9/22) dominating. Many scholars have recently prepared QX vaccine strains for use as a candidate vaccine in China (Huo et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2015) , but there is still no official approval for field application of a QX-like vaccine in China. Considering the possibility of recombination between vaccine strains or between vaccine strain and field strain to generate variants, field application of new attenuated live vaccine such as QX-like vaccine should be carefully assessed before implementation.",

Most scholars classify Variant-2 strains into the cK/CH/LSC/ 99Itype or SAIBK type, but our RDP and Simplot analysis showed that Variant-2 strains are the result of a recombination event between a QX-type and a cK/CH/LSC/99I-type (SAIBK-type) strain. Both the TWI and TWII type were first identified in Taiwan, and the isolation of TWI-type strains in China has increased in recent years (Fu-yan, 2013; Zhang et al., 2016) , while TWII-type strains were first identified in China in 2012 . In our study, we not only identified TWII-type strains among our samples, but we also discovered recombinant IBVs originating from QX-type and TWII-type strains. How TWII and associated recombinant strains appeared in flocks from southwestern China remains unknown. Measures should be taken to prevent the evolution of new variants and recombinant variants, such as strengthening supervision of the poultry trade, limiting the number and type of live vaccine strains, and increasing the biosecurity level of chicken farms.",

            "text": "The S1 glycoprotein carries most of the neutralizing epitopes in the IBV genome, and the S1 subunit gene is highly variable. Gene mutations may be introduced into the viral genome by viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases, which display incomplete proofreading capabilities (Denison et al., 2011 (Denison et al., 2011 , and gene recombination can occur via a genomic template switching mechanism (Lai, 1992) . The homology sequences between the donor and acceptor genome are usually required for the copy-choice of homologous recombination, and the RNA secondary structure such as hairpin structure could also influence the recombination process (Lai, 1992; Nagy et al., 1998) . Mutation and recombination of the S1 gene may lead to the emergence of new variants, genotypes, or serotypes . In this study, we found that mutations in the S1 subunit gene were mainly located in the three hyper-variable regions (HVR) (data not shown), which is consistent with our previous study (Zou et al., 2010) . For the recombination occurred in the S1 gene, previous studies have demonstrated that most crossover occur at a relatively conserved sequence near the HVR (Wang et al., 1994) . However, this was not the case for three of the four putative recombination events detected in this study. The breakpoint site in the Variant-1 group was located at a conserved sequence in the HVR, while that in the Variant-3 group was located in a variable region outside of the HVR. Recombination hotspots are generally believed to be located adjacent to putative breakpoint sites, CT(T/ G)AACAA, CTTTTG, and CTTTTG(C/T) are usually considered to be potential hotspot sequences. In this study, the hotspot sequences above were not observed near the breakpoint sites, but a potentially new, A-T rich hotspot sequences, ATTTT(T/A), was observed near the breakpoint sites of the S1 subunit gene. Sequence analysis of recombinant IBVs in other reports (Mo et al., 2013; Thor et al., 2011) showed that ATTTT(T/A) was also observed near the breakpoint sites in some of the strains (Date not shown). Previous report had shown that AUrich sequence could be the important recombination-promoting signals of Brome Mosaic Virus (BMV) (Shapka and Nagy, 2004) .",

As most IBV isolates do not produce significant CPEs in CEK cells, IBVs should be allowed to adapt to CEK cells before neutralization assays. In this study, H120, 4/91, and M41 were used as vaccine controls, as they represent the most commonly used vaccine strains. Results of the cross-neutralization assay showed that all of the analyzed strains could be grouped into four serotypes: Mass, 793B, Sczy3, and SCYB. The cross-neutralization ability of 4/91 was higher than that of H120, which may explain why the immunogenicity of 4/91 is higher than that of H120 in field applications. However, the antigenic relatedness between some field strains and 4/91 was also low, which may explain immune failure in flocks vaccinated with 4/91. Sczy3 and SCYB were two serotypes that differed from that of the H120 and 4/91 vaccine, and the cross-neutralization abilities of strains in the Sczy3 serotype were higher than those of strains in the SCYB serotype. Representative strains in the Sczy3 serotype may therefore be more suitable for vaccine development than those in the SCYB serotype.",

            "text": "In general, there is a correlation between S1 gene homology and the level of cross-protection between strains, with strains in the same serotype usually sharing N95% amino acid identity and strains from different serotypes sharing b 85% amino acid identity (Cavanagh, 2005) . However, in this study, some strains with high amino acid identity (99.4%), such as cK/CH/SCYB/140913 and cK/CH/CQKX/150203, exhibited low antigenic relatedness, corroborating a previous study that showed that strains with low amino acid identity could also display high antigenic relatedness (Sjaak de Wit et al., 2011) . It is unclear which amino acids play key roles in determining the serotype of IBVs, and genetic analysis could not be used to evaluate antigenic differences between IBVs. Furthermore, we found that some IBV strains, such as cK/CH/SCDY/ 141030, could be grouped into more than one serotype, similar to the results of other reports (Cowen and Hitchner, 1975; Winterfield and Fadly, 1972) . This phenomenon may be explained by the existence of common VN epitopes present in different IBV genes. For example, in cK/CH/SCDY/141030 and Sczy3, two common VN epitopes (87PPQGMAW93 and 412IQTRTEP418) (Zou et al., 2015) were observed in the S1 genes of both strains. Although the five VN epitopes in the HVRs were quite different between strains cK/CH/SCDY/141030 and H120, other common VN epitopes may be located in the S2 and N proteins of these two strains, as there are reports that the S2 and N proteins may induce neutralizing reactions (Ignjatovic and Sapats, 2005; Koch et al., 1990) .",
