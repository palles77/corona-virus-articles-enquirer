In this study, Bmp38 and BmS6K were identified as differentially expressed proteins from iTRAQ database. Bmp38 and BmS6K were expressed, and recombinant proteins were purified. The bioinformatics analysis showed that both proteins have serine/threonine-protein kinases, catalytic domain (S_ TKc) with 360 and 753 amino acids, respectively. The real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) results suggest that Bmp38 and BmS6K had high expression in the midgut and hemolymph. The comparative expression level of Bmp38 and BmS6K in BC9 was upregulated than in P50 in the midgut after Bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus (BmNPV) infection. Western bolt results showed a positive correlation between RT-qPCR and iTRAQ data for Bmp38, but BmS6K data showed partial correlation with iTRAQ. Injection of anti-Bmp38 and anti-BmS6K serum suggested that Bmp38 may be involved against BmNPV infection, whereas BmS6K may require phosphorylation modification to inhibit BmNPV infection. Taken together, our results suggest that Bmp38 and BmS6k might play an important role in innate immunity of silkworm against BmNPV.",

MAPKs have been widely identified from vertebrates to invertebrates, which involve in different signaling transduction pathways (Roux and Blenis 2004) . MAPK family can be classified into three major groups: extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), C-Jun N-terminal Kinases (JNKs), and p38 MAPKs (Marie Cargnello 2011). In addition, MAPKs are triggered by phosphorylation of conserved TxY motifs present in their Ser/Thr kinase domains. Among them, p38 and ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) are members of MAPKs play a wide range of functions in various biological processes including apoptosis, pathogen infection, cell differentiation, inflammatory response, UV stress, and environmental stress (Yee et al. 2004 , Regan et al. 2009 , Fenton and Gout 2011 . Both p38 and S6K MAPK homolog have been studied in vertebrates and invertebrates (Han et al. 1998, Fenton and Gout 2011) .",

S6K1 and S6K2 when interact with Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, their kinase activities are increased (Kuang et al. 2008) . The loss of S6K in Drosophila leads to small cell size and body (Montagne et al. 1999) .

The near-isogenic line BC9 (LC 50 = 2.27 \u00d7 10 6 ) was constructed according to protocol of Wang et al. (2017) . In brief, susceptible strain P50 were crossed with resistant strain A35, and progeny was repeatedly backcrossed with the P50 for nine generations, and each progeny was screened with BmNPV. Hence, the genetic background of BC9 is much similar to the P50, but BC9 should have the resistant background derived from A35. All larvae were reared as described previously (Yu et al. 2017b) . Briefly, fresh mulberry leaves were used to feed larvae. The first-to third-instar larvae were raised in artificial climate chamber at temperature 26 \u00b1 1\u00b0C with relative humidity of 75 \u00b1 5% at 12 h day/night cycles, and temperature 24 \u00b1 1\u00b0C was used for fourth-and fifth-instar larvae with the same relative humidity and photoperiod as mentioned previously.",

In the early stage after BmNPV infection (0-6 h), BmNPV proliferation was nearly undetected in the midgut-hypodermic injection and midgut-oral infection (Fig. 1) . As the infection progressed, BmNPV copy numbers increased significantly from 13.9 to 1,746.7 within 6-48 h in the susceptible P50 midgut injected. In contrast, the BmNPV proliferation rate was low in the resistant BC9 midgut injected, which slowly increased to 683.2 at 48 hpi and 11,210.8 at 72 hpi. In the midgut oral, the relative copy numbers of GP41 showed a similar pattern. The BmNPV copy numbers increased from 82.2 to 8,178.0 within 6-48 hpi in the susceptible P50. However, in resistant BC9, BmNPV proliferation was significantly slower with the relative copy number increasing from 6.5 to 2,216.2 within 6-48 hpi (Fig. 1) . These results indicated that viral proliferation was faster in midgut oral than in midgut injected. In addition, we also found that 48 hpi was critical time point when BmNPV copy numbers showed a significant difference between resistant strain BC9 and susceptible stain P50.

Furthermore, the Bmp38 expression levels in P50 (susceptible strain) and BC9 (resistant strain) were upregulated in the midgut, silk gland, integument, and hemolymph after BmNPV infection, whereas its expression level was downregulated in the fat body and head for P50 and was upregulated for BC9 after BmNPV infection (Fig. 6A) . Western blot results also showed that Bmp38 expression was relatively higher in the midgut, hemolymph, and fat body, which also validated our RT-qPCR results. However, no obvious hybrid band for Bmp38 was detected in the integument according to western blotting (Fig. 6B) . The RT-qPCR results indicated that BmS6K showed a different expression pattern with Bmp38. The BmS6K expression was also observed in every tissue examined, with the highest expression level in the hemolymph and midgut. The lowest expression was observed in the silk gland. Interestingly, unlike Bmp38, the expression between P50 (susceptible strain) and BC9 (resistant strain) of BmS6K was similar in the hemolymph and midgut, which was upregulated in P50 and BC9 after BmNPV infection. BmS6K expression level was downregulated in the head after BmNPV infection (Fig. 6C) . The translation level of BmS6K exposed that BmS6K had comparatively higher expression levels in the head, followed by the fat body.

MAPKs consist of three subfamilies including ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK (Johnson and Lapadat 2002 , Roux and Blenis 2004 , Huang et al. 2009 ). The activation of MAPKs depends on phosphorylation of certain motifs found in activation loop. The p38 MAPK and S6K are important proteins of MAPK family. Evidence showed that p38 MAPK and S6K play vital role in both vertebrates and invertebrates (Roux and Blenis 2004, Fenton and Gout 2011) . However, studies on p38 and S6K MAPK proteins in silkworm had not been reported previously. Therefore, in the present study, we identified B. mori p38 and S6K proteins from iTRAQ database. The sequence analysis showed that Bmp38 and BmS6K contain S_TKc domain with 360 aa and 753 aa, respectively. Multiple sequence alignment of Bmp38 and BmS6k with other organisms (having known functions) revealed common features in all of them, e.g., activation loop and motifs. The phylogenetic analysis provided evidences that Bmp38 and BmS6K homologous are highly conserved in vertebrates and invertebrates.

To date, there are no reports on S6K functions against pathogens. We observed the transcription and translation level of B. mori S6K. Our results showed that BmS6K expression was higher in the hemolymph and midgut after BmNPV infection. The translation results showed that BmS6K expression was higher in the head, followed by the fat body. The transcription results of BmS6K in the midgut after BmNPV infection revealed that BmS6K expression was at peak at 12 h postinfection, then its expression decreased slightly at 24, 48, and 72 h, but it was still significantly upregulated. The translation data also correlate with the transcription data. Moreover, we found that BmS6K translation data are somewhat consistent with the iTRAQ and need further attention.",

The results indicated that Bmp38 blocking increased the relative copy numbers of viral genes when compared with control. It has been reported that silence of p38 from Chinese shrimp (Fenneropenaeus chinensis) revealed its role against white spot syndrome virus (He et al. 2018) . Pharmacological inhibition of p38 MAPK by SB203580 affected the replication of influenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus (Marchant et al. 2010) . Therefore, we speculated that Bmp38 might be involved in BmNPV resistance. The RSK family comprised a group of highly related serine/threonine kinases that regulated diverse cellular processes, including proliferation, cell growth, and motility. Members of RSK family contained RSK1, RSK2, RSK3, and RSK4. Among them, activated RSK2 was shown to phosphorylate several transcription factors response to viral infection (Yan et al. 2018) . Surviladze et al. (2013) revealed that activation of PI3K/Akt/ mTOR could phosphorylate S6K to further activate the downstream signal pathways in response to human papillomavirus type 16 infection. In case of BmS6K, the relative copy numbers of viral genes were significantly upregulated than CK. We considered that BmNPV resistance of BmS6K required phosphorylation modification. Therefore, the specific reasons need to be conducted. The abovementioned results suggested that blocking of Bmp38 and BmS6K in BC9 (resistant strain) might participate in BmNPV proliferation.",
