In addition to ligands detected by natural RNA controllers, RNA can bind to various types of molecules including antibiotics, dyes, fluorescent probes, and proteins with specificity and sensitivity similar to protein-based controllers [3] . Binding events can be readily associated with regulatory activities because of the flexibility of RNA, which allows transformation between alternative structures. Moreover, the regulatory activity of RNA can be modulated or even designed by adjusting base pairings that largely determine intra-and intermolecular interactions. Finally, because of the small size of RNA controllers (generally <200 nt), they impose lower burdens on cells compared to protein-based controllers which require longer mRNA transcripts and translation into proteins [4] . This small size also permits construction and examination of numerous variants in a high-throughput manner to create and optimize new controllers.",

Binding of a cognate metabolite to the sensor, an RNA aptamer, induces structural changes of the expression platform to control gene expression. Each riboswitch component can be engineered independently because of the modularity of this system. Riboswitch aptamers are primary choices for modification to broaden the range of ligands. For example, specific nucleotides in the addA riboswitch aptamer from Vibrio vulnificus were fully mutagenized based on its crystal structure [5 ] ( Figure 1a ). Mutant riboswitches were screened for orthogonal gene activation using a library of non-natural analogues of the original ligand, adenine. Mutant riboswitches activated gene expression upon addition of ammeline or azacytosine, but showed no response to adenine. Furthermore, additional aptamer-ligand pairs were discovered in a subsequent analogue screening study [6] . This approach was applied to identify novel aptamer-ligand pairs by altering the specificity of the PreQ 1 class I riboswitch from Bacillus subtilis [7] . Aptamers of natural riboswitches were utilized as scaffolds to select aptamers for new ligands. Nucleotides in the binding pockets of natural aptamers were randomized to produce potential aptamer libraries for in vitro selection (SELEX) [8 ] (Figure 1b ). Selected aptamers for 5-hydroxytryptophan and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine were successfully coupled to the readout domain, producing fluorescence upon binding of their cognate ligand in vitro and in vivo. The ability of natural aptamer scaffolds to properly fold in the cellular context ensures that aptamers evolved in vitro can be successfully employed in riboswitch construction for in vivo applications.",

As a result, aptazymes for small molecules, antibiotics, and proteins were developed based on hammerhead ribozymes. Additionally, newly discovered ribozymes were employed to construct new aptazymes. A twister ribozyme was utilized to build two-input logic gates by attaching two distinct aptamers at different positions on a single ribozyme scaffold [18] (Figure 2a) .

In contrast to prokaryotic translation which requires a ribosome binding site inside mRNA, eukaryotic translation generally utilizes a 5 0cap to recruit ribosomes. Therefore, a general approach for developing translation-regulating riboswitches in prokaryotes involving inserting aptamers upstream of the ribosome binding site is not applicable to eukaryotes. Thus, alternative mechanisms were exploited. For example, internal ribosome entry site (IRES) was utilized to rationally design riboswitches that activate or repress gene expression [20, 21] . Aptamers were placed upstream of IRES and several base-pairing sequences were designed to control the formation of critical structures (PK-III) depending on ligand binding (Figure 2b ). Another example utilized an unusual mechanism known as ribosome shunting. On a special mRNA, a ribosome that translated an upstream short open reading frame can bypass a strong stem structure and land on a specific site downstream to reinitiate translation of a downstream ORF. This stem was replaced with aptamers to control the formation of the stem in response to ligand binding [22] (Figure 2b ). Ribosomal frame-shifting was also employed for dynamic control of the reading frame [23] . A theophylline aptamer was inserted along with a switch hairpin in the extra stem-loop of SARS coronavirus \u00c01 programmed ribosomal frameshifting pseudoknot stimulator (Figure 2b ). Binding of theophylline induced formation of a pseudoknot structure essential for \u00c01 frameshifting, and the reporter gene in the \u00c01 frame was translated.",

These theoretical foundations were united with various algorithms to predict RNA structure [31] [32] [33] , enabling the forward design of dynamic RNA controllers (Figure 3a ). In general, specific regions in RNA controllers critical for ligand-induced regulation are randomized to generate sequence libraries. Next, computational methods predict the secondary structures of the sequence variants in the presence or absence of a ligand and screen them according to predefined criteria. The criteria include successful folding of the ligand binding pocket and rejection of any unwanted structures.

A detailed understanding of the mechanisms and structures of natural riboswitches enabled re-engineering of ligand-binding pockets or expression platforms. Diverse RNA-based regulatory mechanisms were exploited in combination with naturally occurring aptamers or artificial aptamers to create dynamic RNA controllers. Mechanistic models for RNA-based regulations and algorithms for predicting RNA structure allowed establishment of computational methods for de novo design of dynamic controllers. Advances in in vitro and in vivo selection made the development of dynamic RNA controllers that functions in vivo much more achievable. Consequently, RNA-based dynamic controllers were implemented in various applications ranging from highthroughput screening of metabolites to inducible control of cellular processes.",

            "text": "Although significant progress has been made in designing dynamic RNA controllers, several improvements are required. First, efficient methods of discovering novel RNA-based regulatory elements are necessary because natural RNA controllers can be used as foundations for artificial controllers and provide additional design principles. High-throughput screening of novel regulatory elements based on next-generation sequencing [57] , transcriptome-wide probing of RNA structures in vivo [58, 59] , or bioinformatics-based comparative genomics [60, 61] were recently demonstrated. Next, prediction algorithms for RNA structure should be refined and improved considering that the regulatory activity of RNA is largely determined by its structure. For instance, accurate calculation of the contributions of pseudoknots, non-Watson-Crick base pairings, and ligand binding would considerably improve the accuracy of structure prediction and computational design of dynamic RNA controllers. Finally, in vitro and in vivo selections should be designed deliberately to complete the development process. The computational design approaches can narrow down the number of candidates for dynamic RNA controllers after extensive in silico screening of vast sequence spaces. In vitro and in vivo selections can then be performed to empirically validate each design in a high-throughput manner in an environment where the dynamic RNA controllers should work. The potential of empirical selection should be further explored because the quantitative properties of RNA controllers can be modulated using well-designed in vivo selection schemes [43 ] . Emerging approaches in the development of dynamic RNA controllers will expand the repertoire of genetic parts for applications in metabolic engineering and synthetic biology. Future innovations in the methods for discovering natural parts, predicting RNA structure, and empirically selecting candidates will dramatically improve the design process.",

Twister ribozyme has two stems that can be combined with two distinct aptamers simultaneously to construct two-input logic gates. (b) Eukaryote-specific translation regulation mechanisms are exploited to create new dynamic RNA controllers. Left: Modulator sequence, anti-anti-IRES sequence (aaIRES), and anti-IRES sequence (aIRES) are designed to sequester the pseudoknot III (PK-III) which is an essential element of IRES system in the absence of ligand. When the ligand is bound to an aptamer, aaIRES and aIRES hybridize, forming PK-III. Middle: Ribosome cannot translate a downstream ORF (dORF) after translating a short ORF (sORF) in the absence of ligand. When the ligand is bound to an aptamer, an essential stem structure is formed, allowing the ribosome to shunt and reinitiate translation of the downstream ORF. Right: \u00c01 programmed ribosomal frameshifting stimulator is formed when the ligand binds the aptamer. The ribosome shifts the reading frame at a slippery sequence.
