The relationships of the two smallest IBV mRNAs, A and B, to the cloned sequences were established by restriction fragment hybridisation to Northern blots. The 5'-termini of mRNAs A and B were located on the clones by Sl mapping. DNA sequencing of cloned sequences corresponding to the intergenic boundaries of mRNAs A and B was carried out. Homologies between the sequences at these boundaries were observed. infectious virus bronchitis Beaudette, gene cloning, intergenic sequences",

            "text": "The genome of a coronavirus is typically an RNA of 15-20 kilobases (kb) with positive polarity . A series of viral mRNAs have been identified in infected cells . Thus six major species of viral RNA have been observed in IBV-infected cells; they have been designated A-F with A being the smallest and F, which is the same length as vii-ion RNA, being the largest (Stern and Kennedy, 1980a) . The gross sequence reltionships between the genomic RNA and subgeno~c mRNAs have been established for IBV using the technique of oligonucleotide mapping (Stern and Kennedy, 1980b) . These data demonstrate that the mRNAs are a 3'-coterminal ('nested') subset of the genomic RNA sequence. The assignment of polypeptide coding to the mRNAs by in vitro translation studies has lent support to the idea that each mRNA gives rise to one major primary translation product encoded by the 5' sequences of each mRNA which are not present in the smaller mRNA species and that the other coding regions 3'-wards of this region are not translated at high efficiency (Stern et al., 1982) . Studies of UV inactivation of viral mRNA synthesis have thrown light on the basic mechanism by which the subgenomic RNAs are produced during IBV replication; they are synthesized independently rather than by cleavage of a genome-length precursor (Stern and Sefton, 1982) . Recently, oligonucleotide mapping of mRNAs, sequencing of cDNA clones of mRNAs and direct sequencing of mRNAs and the genome of another coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) have demonstrated that mRNA synthesis involves fusion of a 5'-terminal 'leader' sequence from the genomic RNA to the 'body' of each subgenomic mRNA (Lai et al., 1982 (Lai et al., , 1983 Spaan et al., 1982 Spaan et al., , 1983 . The oligonucleotide mapping data obtained for IBV mRNAs (Stern and Kennedy, 1980b) do not provide evidence for the existence of 'leader' sequences.",

The viral origin of the inserts was demonstrated by hybridisation with a probe prepared by polynucleotide kinase labelling of alkali-treated, full-length IBV genomic RNA. The absence of plasmid sequences interspersed with viral sequences was confirmed by hybridisation with nick-translated pAT153. The presence of poly(A) sequences from the 3'-terminus of the virus genome in cloned sequences was detected using polynucleotide kinaselabelled alkali-treated poly(U). The end of the clone bearing the cloned poly(A) sequences was identified by blotting and poly(U) hybridisation of restriction digests of appropriate clones. Ultimately restriction sites were mapped in 25 of the clones and this enabled the construction of a continuous map, 3.3 kb in length, which included the 3'-terminus of the viral genome.",

These data are summarised for mRNAs A, B, C and D in Table 1 . Data for the PvuII/PstI and AccI/AccI, AccI/PstI fragments are presented in Fig. 2 . It can be seen that the fragments derived from the end of the C5.136 insert which is nearest to the 3'-end of the viral genomic RNA invariably hybridise to all mRNA species, while the fragments derived from the 5'-end of the insert hybridise only to mRNAs C and D. Thus both the PvuII/PstI fragments hybridise to all four mRNAs while the AccI/AccI fragment hybridises to mRNAs B, C and D, and the 940-bp AccI/PstI fragment hybridises to mRNAs C 3, AccI/AccI 390 bp fragment; 4, AccI/PstI 940 bp fragment. Replicate strips were cut from a single nitrocellulose filter and hybridised with the labelled restriction fragments. Molecular weight estimates for the mRNAs were obtained from the positions of unlabelled ribosomal RNAs from chicken and E. coli. and D. The data presented in Table 1 show that the 5'-terminus of mRNA A lies between the PvuII and TaqI sites while the 5'-terminus of mRNA B lies between the two AccI sites. This experiment thus establishes the gross relationship between the cloned sequences and IBV mRNAs A and B.",

The results are presented in Fig. 3 . The lengths of the protected fragments estimate the positions of the S-termini of mRNAs A and B in relation to the restriction map of the cloned sequences. Thus the 5'-terminus of the 'body' of mRNA A lies approximately 128 bp 5'-wards from the PvuII site and the 5'-terminus of mRNA B lies approximately 431 bp 5'-wards from this site. In all Sl mapping experiments there was protection of the full length labelled restriction fragment (up to the 5'-end of the cloned sequences) without evidence of a protected species slightly shorter than this which might correspond to a 5'-terminus of mRNA C. It was thus possible to locate the 5'-termini of mRNAs A and B with sufficient accuracy to obtain sequence data and examine them for features of possible significance.",

These are the first sequence data obtained from clones of coronavirus genomic RNA. The significance of the observation of a series of sequences repeated at these intergenic boundaries is unclear at the present time, but it seems likely that they are important in the synthesis of viral mRNAs rather than being involved in mRNA binding to ribosomes (Kozak, 1983) . The finding that the synthesis of viral mRNAs in MHV infection involves fusion of a 5'-leader sequence to the mRNA bodies makes it possible that a similar mechanism operates for synthesis of viral RNAs in IBV infection.",

The IBV sequences show no significant homology with the equivalent MHV sequence; however, low G content is common to both IBV and MHV boundary sequences. Only one boundary sequence is available for MHV (derived from cDNA clones of mRNAs rather than genomic RNA) and it is thus impossible to make other types of comparison at the present time (Spaan et al., 1983) . It is possible that the sequences may be involved in base pairing with sequences present in a putative leader sequence or that they are recognised directly by the viral RNA polymerase. The observation that a nine-base sequence present once at the A/B boundary is present twice at the B/C boundary suggests the possibility that the degree of iteration might control the rates of synthesis of viral RNAs by increasing the probability of polymerase binding at the repeated site. However, the observation that in cytoplasmic RNA preparations from IBV-infected cells the abundance of mRNA A is greater than that of B (Stern and Kennedy, 1980a) indicates that, if this is so, other factors must also be involved. It will be important to establish the relationships of the sequences identified here to any leader sequences present on IBV mRNAs A and B, but elucidation of their role will probably depend on studies of the mechanism of the viral RNA polymerase responsible for mRNA synthesis.",
