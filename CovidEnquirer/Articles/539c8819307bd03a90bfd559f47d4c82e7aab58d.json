The hairpin part is predicted in the same way as Stem 1 hairpin. o In BWYV PSK 1, the duplex part is predicted from INN-HB model (39) with 5\u0384CF/3\u0384GQ free energy increment (Table 1) . o In BWYV PSK 2 and its mutants, the free energies of duplex parts are derived from optical melting result (-12.9 kcal/mol) of model duplex 5\u0384GAACAAACGG3\u0384/3\u0384AACUUGUUUGF5\u0384 (Table 1) , by making it less favorable by 1.9 kcal/mol for 3\u0384 dangling AA (62). Additional assumptions described on the figures are used to estimate stability increments for the fluorescent end of the duplex. The hairpin part and duplex part are coaxially stacked onto each other and stabilize the \"reference\" structure (63).",
