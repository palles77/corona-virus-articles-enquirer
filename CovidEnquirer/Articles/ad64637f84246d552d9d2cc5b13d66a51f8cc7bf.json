This was largely spread by direct or indirect contact with large respiratory droplets, although airborne transmission has also been reported. High infection rates among HCWs led initially to the theory that SARS was highly contagious and the concept of 'super-spreading events'. Such events illustrated that lack of infection control (IC) measures or failure to comply with IC precautions could lead to large-scale hospital outbreaks. SARS was eventually contained by the stringent application of IC measures that limited exposure of HCWs to potentially infectious individuals. As the 'global village' becomes smaller and other microbial threats to health emerge, or re-emerge, there is an urgent need to develop a global strategy for infection control in hospitals.",

This was reinforced with the reporting of 'super-spreading events'. 2, 5, [12] [13] [14] [15] The concept of super-spreading events has been proposed to explain incidents where a SARS patient infects many more persons than would be expected. Such events contributed to large-scale nosocomial outbreaks and have been attributed to the lack of stringent IC measures in hospitals. However, this does not fully explain these events and further research is required to understand the underlying risk factors. Aerosol-generating procedures have been associated with increased risk of transmission through the aerosolisation of virus-containing particles. 16 In addition patients with unrecognised SARS, particularly those with atypical presentations were the source of a number of nosocomial outbreaks. 13, 15 As the outbreak evolved SARS was shown to be only moderately transmissible with an estimated basic reproductive number of approximately three. 17, 18 The basic reproductive number refers to the average number of secondary cases generated by one primary case in a susceptible population. For SARS this is much lower than for influenza, and unlike influenza and other viral respiratory diseases, SARS-CoV has a long incubation period (up to 14 days), with the viral load peaking during the second week of illness and appearing to be highest in patients with more severe disease. 2 This may explain why transmission has not been identified in asymptomatic patients or after symptoms have resolved, and why transmission mainly occurs in hospitals.",

There were reports that masks, fit testing and fit checking practices varied and did not always take place. 28 However, subsequent evidence has shown that the use of a mask, either surgical or an N95 respirator (or equivalent), was protective compared to no mask. 28 It was also reported from Toronto that SARS was less likely to develop if a mask was used consistently with each patient contact. 29 This is supported by evidence from Hong Kong which suggests that HCWs who used complete precautionary measures were less likely to become infected than those who omitted even one precautionary measure. 30 However, there is evidence that some HCWs were infected with SARS following exposure to aerosol-and droplet-generating procedures despite wearing full PPE (that is N95 mask (or equivalent), gown, eye protection and gloves). 6, 16, 19, 31 A number of reasons were proposed for this including incomplete compliance with infection control guidance such as removing PPE unsafely, reuse of single use PPE, not having masks correctly fitted prior to use and not using eye protection. In contrast, a retrospective study reported that 70% (72/102) of HCWs in the United States who cared for SARS patients did not use eye protection. 32 Furthermore, no documented transmission of SARS-CoV was reported, even among those who had been within 3 feet of a confirmed case.",

Others constructed new isolation wards and rooms or carried out extensive engineering modifications to existing structures. 22, [36] [37] [38] Those lacking such facilities and resources responded with innovative solutions. Three examples were: hospital staff attempting to create negative-pressure relative to hallways by using fans and windows opening to the exterior; the development of guidelines to enable the re-use of respirators; and the erection of glass walls in hallways to create anterooms to patients' rooms. 7, 22 Physical space separation There is evidence indicating that the risk of developing SARS was related to proximity to a case. 2, 5, 39, 40 In one study a 'Hierarchy of Risk' was developed which showed that the risk of infection increased with proximity of contact, and that in the absence of aerosol-generating procedures, exposures !1 m from a case of SARS (with or without contact) were those that posed the highest risk. 2 These results suggest that physical separation of SARS patients from HCWs, hospital visitors and other patients should reduce the transmission of SARS. Indeed, in many of the areas with a large number of SARS cases several different measures were implemented in order to do this. These included the rapid identification and isolation of possible SARS patients waiting in Emergency Departments; isolating potential SARS patients either individually or in cohorts; designating lifts for use by potential SARS cases only; and, using anterooms for the donning and removal of PPE. 3, 7, 22, 23 Handwashing Despite a number of studies demonstrating that handwashing is effective in reducing the transmission of pathogens, it is recognised that compliance among HCWs is poor. 41, 42 Although there have not been any formal evaluations of the impact of handwashing on SARS-CoV transmission, recent evidence indicates that HCWs who washed their hands while caring for SARS patients were less likely to develop SARS compared to those that did not. 30 Environmental decontamination SARS-CoV is present in all body fluids making precautions with waste disposal essential. There is also evidence of probable survival on inanimate hospital surfaces for up to 72 h. 11 The cleaning and disinfection of environmental surfaces in hospitals employing commonly used disinfectants is believed to be effective against SARS-CoV. 11 There is little research evidence, however, regarding the effectiveness of this practice in reducing hospital transmission of SARS.",

Functions of the hospital ICC should include outbreak investigation, surveillance, reviewing local epidemiological data, educating staff, patients and visitors, developing and promoting local guidelines and estimating resource needs.

The design of health care facilities is therefore important and should support HCWs in their implementation of IC procedures. IC practitioners should be consulted when designing new hospitals and when other hospital buildings are being redesigned or renovated. 52 Prompt diagnosis is critical for any effective IC programme. This requires reliable and effective methods of surveillance with early detection of outbreaks and contact tracing in both the healthcare setting as well as in the community. As clinical diagnosis may not always be sufficiently reliable, rapid isolation and strict IC practices will need to be applied. Also, given that the clustering of fever and respiratory tract illness in HCWs was a feature of SARS, clusters of infection among staff members should be recognised and investigated.",

Recent events such as the SARS, Ebola and avian influenza outbreaks and the continuing rise of healthcare associated infections, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), have challenged the international public health community to apply the lessons learnt from IC practices during the 2003 SARS outbreak on a global basis. Indeed, international experts and policy makers have gathered at regional consultations supported by WHO and recommended that a global strategy be developed for IC practices in order to establish international minimum standards. 49 In the wake of SARS, IC has been provided with a window of opportunity to revolutionise the way it is viewed and ensure that in future it is considered as a high priority. SARS has clearly demonstrated that IC is not only about implementing and following guidelines or knowing how to don and remove PPE. It is also about surveillance, surge capacity, information provision, consistent application of IC measures and an appropriate and adequate public health infrastructure. Many of the IC measures implemented during SARS are yet to be formally evaluated. Nevertheless, the literature clearly demonstrates that failure to implement appropriate IC procedures and apply them consistently was an important factor in the hospital transmission of SARS. It is now upto IC practitioners to harness momentum generated by SARS into actions that will improve local, national and global infection control infrastructure.",
