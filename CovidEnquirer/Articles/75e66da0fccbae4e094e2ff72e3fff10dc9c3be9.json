Since such a small proportion of cells are infected in the macrophage cultures, it has not been possible to detect intracellular viral components in cell culture extracts. Because of the technical difficulties inherent in studying LDV replication in tissue culture, neither the gene order nor the replication stategy of this virus have yet been delineated. In order to obtain the information needed to definitively classify LDV, we have begun to map the structural proteins of the neurotropic isolate of LDV (LDV-C; 13) on the viral genome. LDV-C (approximately 2 X 10\" IDS,,) was purified from blood plasma taken from 50 CD-1 mice (Charles River Breeding Laboratories, Boston, MA) as previously described (8). The viral structural proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred electrophoretitally to a polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane (Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) using a modified Towbin Tris-glycine buffer (12.5 mM Tris, 96 mAI glycine, pH 8.3) containing no methanol (14). After staining with Coomassie blue, the Vpl protein band, which migrated with an apparent molecular weight of 14,000 Da (data not shown), was excised from the PVDF membrane and analyzed in an Applied Biosystems Model 475A protein sequencer. Automated protein sequence analysis was performed in the gas phase mode with on-line PTH analysis using a Model 120A analyzer as previously described (15). The following N-terminal 33 amino acid sequence was obtained for Vpl :",

The genomic RNA of LDV-C was recloned as previously described (8) using calf thymus (ct) pentameric DNA for priming. Both strands of the double-stranded cDNA clones were sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method as previously described (8) until complementary overlapping sequences were obtained within each clone. As shown in Fig. 1 , four ct-primed clones (b24, b63, b104, and ~44) were found to contain long poly(A) tracts at one end. These four clones completely overlap the unique sequence of the dt4 clone. The longest poly(A) tract found among these clones was 52 nucleotides in length which is very close to the length of the 3' terminal poly(A) tract (approximately 50 nucleotides) previously estimated directly from the LDV genomic RNA (7). Two additional clones, b90 and a16, further extended the 5'end of this sequence (Fig. 1) .",
