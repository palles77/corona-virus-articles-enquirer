Streamline 25 column (ID = 25 mm) was used as a contactor and Streamline chelating adsorbent immobilized with Ni 2+ ion was used as affinity adsorbent. The dynamic binding capacity of Ni 2+ -loaded Streamline chelating adsorbent for the NP protein in unclarified feedstock was found to be 2.94 mg ml \u00c01 adsorbent at a superficial velocity of 200 cm h \u00c01 . The direct purification of NP protein from unclarified feedstock using expanded bed adsorption has resulted in a 31% adsorption and 9.6% recovery of NP protein. The purity of the NP protein recovered was about 70% and the volume of processing fluid was reduced by a factor of 10. The results of the present study show that the IMA-EBAC developed could be used to combine the clarification, concentration and initial purification steps into a single-step operation.",

Typically, the feedstock (cell lysate) contains particulate materials, which have to be removed prior to further purification steps. Centrifugation and filtration are the two most widely used techniques for the removal of biomass or cell debris [9] . However, these clarification methods possess several disadvantages such as time consuming, substantial protein loss, and high operational and capital costs. Indeed, our previous study showed that about 80% of the NP protein of NDV was lost during the clarification step using centrifugation [10] . After clarification step, the supernatant has to be concentrated using ammonium sulphate precipitation, dialyzed and purified through sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. These purification steps are very costly and labour intensive and not scalable. Hence, there is a need to develop a simple and scalable purification process for recombinant NP protein.",

EBA has been used for the clarification and purification of biological suspensions containing very small particles such as cell debris [13] . EBA processes employ the flow of fluid through an initially packed bed structure to achieve a contactor with a high-fluid voidage. A stable bed is formed with adsorbent having a well-defined distribution of bead sizes [14] . Under these circumstances, the larger/heavier adsorbent beads will locate near the bottom of the bed, whereas the smaller/lighter adsorbent beads will locate near the top [15] . The high-fluid voidage allows for unhindered passage of cells, cell debris and other particulates during the application of crude feed to the column.",

EBA has been used successfully with a number of different feedstocks such as bacterial [17] [18] [19] , yeast [20] , mammalian cell [14] fermentation broths and transgenic milk [21] . Recent work has also demonstrated the application of EBA employing immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) for the purification of histidine-tag proteins from various sources [22, 23] . The recombinant NP of NDV has been previously tagged with hexa-histidine residues [7] that facilitated its adsorption onto the immobilized metal affinity (IMA) adsorbent.

The equilibrium adsorption data in various pH of clarified and unclarified feedstock are summarized in Table 1 . The results show that the optimal binding pH for NP protein onto the Streamline chelating for both feedstocks is pH 8. Indeed, Clemmitt and Chase [26] have reported that the range of pH for the adsorption of proteins onto a metal-IDA adsorbent is between 7 and 8. The adsorption of protein onto the immobilized metals occurs at pH higher than its pK a . Since the pK a of histidine residues is about pH 7 [27] , pH 8 has become the optimal pH for its binding. However, further increase of pH to 8.5 has substantially reduced the binding capacity of Streamline chelating adsorbent. The highest equilibrium binding capacity of Ni 2+ -loaded Streamline chelating adsorbents for NP protein achieved at pH 8.0 was about 13.74 and 10.90 mg ml \u00c01 of adsorbents for unclarified and clarified feedstocks, respectively. The results show that the binding capacity of Streamline chelating adsorbent was not affected by the presence of biomass.

The n and U t values were determined from the linear regression of the Richardson-Zaki equation. The value of the n for the buffer and the presence of biomass was 5.23 and 5.17, respectively (Table 2) . These values correspond to the theoretical value of 4.8, which is normally used in the laminar flow regime [30] ; thus, the bed was assumed to be stable upon expansion in the presence of biomass. The U t for the adsorbent fluidized in the feedstock suspension, 865.4 cm h \u00c01 , is less than the value in the buffer because of the greater viscosity and density of feedstock suspension than the buffer. The linear flow rate intended to be used for bed equilibration and adsorption, 200 cm h \u00c01 , is far lower than the U t .

Fig. 4 shows the breakthrough curve for the NP protein from unclarified feedstock onto Ni 2+ -loaded Streamline chelating adsorbent in an expanded bed. The NP protein was efficiently captured from the unclarified feedstock. In this study, the dynamic binding capacity of Ni 2+ -loaded Streamline chelating adsorbent for the NP protein in unclarified feedstock was found to be 2.94 mg ml \u00c01 adsorbent at a superficial velocity of 200 cm h \u00c01 . Therefore, the optimal loading of unclarified E. coli feedstock (0.98 mg ml \u00c01 NP protein) that could be applied onto the 100 ml of adsorbent is about 300 ml.

The unclarified feedstock was applied to the expanded bed at a flow velocity of 200 cm h \u00c01 , which corresponded to an expanded bed height of 41 cm. The stepwise elution is often selected for large preparative applications because it is technically simpler and reproducible compared to gradient elution [32] . Table 3 shows that the direct purification from unclarified feedstock using IMAC-EBAC has resulted in a 31% adsorption and 9.6% recovery of NP protein. It was a great improvement compared to the 1.3% final yield obtained from the multistep conventional methods involving centrifugation, precipitation, and ultracentrifugation [10] . Unbound and weakly bound proteins were eliminated with elution buffer containing low imidazole concentration (50 mM). The NP protein was subsequently eluted from the column by applying elution buffer containing high imidazole concentration (350 mM). Fig. 7 shows the SDS-PAGE analysis of protein from elution fractions collected from the second elution, while lane 5 in Fig. 5 is the pool of these elution fractions. Fig. 6 shows the elution profile of both elution 1 and elution 2. Peak 1 represents the proteins eluted from elution 1 (50 mM imidazole) and peak 2 represents the proteins eluted from elution 2 (350 mM imidazole). Peak 1 of Fig. 6 and lane 4 of Fig. 5 show that eluate 1 contains higher amount of contaminating proteins and only about 2% of NP proteins were present. Approximately, 38 mg or about 31% of bound NP protein has been eluted from the adsorbent by elution buffer with high imidazole concentration. Substantial amount of protein with molecular weight lower than 60 kDa was found in the eluate 2 (Fig. 5 , lane 5 and Fig. 7) . These impurities could be either the contaminating protein that was not removed during elution 1 or the degraded NP protein. Indeed, Wizemann and von Brunn [33] have also reported the presence of protein slightly below the size of target protein in the eluate during the purification of hepatitis B virus nucleocapsid protein using Ni 2+ -chelate affinity chromatography and regarded it as an N-terminal degradation product of the target protein.",

The results of the present study showed that it is possible to recover NP protein directly from unclarified feedstock utilizing IMA-EBAC. A two-step elution protocol was used to elute NP protein from the adsorbent. The protocol employed elution buffer containing 50 mM imidazole that is capable of eliminating high amount of contaminating proteins and elution buffer containing 350 mM imidazole that efficiently elutes large amount of NP protein from the adsorbent. The elution of NP protein was performed in packed bed mode in order to reduce fraction volumes and to concentrate the NP protein. The combination of clarification, capture and purification in a single-step in IMA-EBAC has substantially reduced the downstream processing time, volume of processing fluid, as well as capital and operational costs involved.
