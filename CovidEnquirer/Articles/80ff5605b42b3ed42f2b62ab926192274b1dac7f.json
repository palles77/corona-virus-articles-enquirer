Tissue lymph enters the lymph node via one or more afferent vessels and percolates through a series of reticuloendothe-lial-lined channels that coalesce and drain through an efferent lymphatic vessel. Particulate matter is phagocytosed by macrophages lining the lymphatic channels. Once phagocytized, foreign proteins become bound to major histocompatibility (MHC) antigens and are presented on the surface of macrophages. Foreign proteins bound to MHC class II molecules on the surface of dendritic cells, in combination with other cell surface receptors and secreted cellular signals (interleukins), are required for activation of T-helper lymphocytes. These lymphocytes can in turn activate na\u00efve B-lymphocytes. Alternatively, memory B-lymphocytes may be directly activated by dendritic cells. Once activated, Band T-lymphocytes proliferate to create a pool of lymphocytes that have the ability to recognize and bind the inciting foreign protein. In addition, activated T-lymphocytes and macrophages release cellular signals (cytokines) that induce leukocyte chemotaxis and increase vascular permeability.",

Clearly, the definitions of these categories are arbitrary, and many infectious processes are associated with symptom duration that fits into more than one category. In general, however, acute lymphadenitis, which can be 2 weeks in duration, is due to either a viral or bacterial invasion. Chronic lymphadenopathy is more likely to be due to a neoplastic process or invasion by an opportunistic organism. Subacute lymphadenitis, which is 2 and 6 weeks in duration, encompasses a much broader group of potential etiologies. In practice, surgeons seldom are involved in the care of patients with acute lymphadenitis unless the lymph nodes become suppurative. Most of these patients improve during a course of antibiotic therapy prescribed by their primary care physician.",

More specific symptoms include skin changes and pain in the region of the nodal swelling, as well as at more distant sites. A history of recent upper respiratory tract symptoms, sore throat, ear pain, toothache, insect bites, superficial lacerations or rashes, and exposure to animals may suggest possible etiologies. In addition, a history of recent travel, exposure to individuals that are ill, and immunization status should be sought. Finally, patient age is another important consideration, since lymphadenopathy in young children is overwhelmingly due to infectious etiologies, whereas adenopathy due to neoplasia increases in the adolescent age group. Findings on physical examination may also suggest an etiology. Cervical lymph nodes are frequently palpable in children; however, lymph nodes larger than 10 mm in diameter are considered abnormal. As noted previously, the location of involved nodes may indicate a potential site of entry and should prompt a detailed examination of that site. Erythema, tenderness, and fluctuance suggest an acute process, most likely attributable to a bacterial invasion. Involvement of bilateral cervical lymph nodes suggests a viral origin. The characteristics of the nodes are also important. Nodes involved in neoplastic processes frequently are firm and fixed, whereas those due to infectious agents tend to be softer in consistency and often slightly mobile. Other physical abnormalities, including respiratory findings, skin lesions, hepatosplenomegaly, and adenopathy in other parts of the body may also suggest an etiology.",

Leukocyte counts and markers of inflammation (C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate) are usually abnormal but nonspecific. Although a left shift (ie, increased percentage of immature white cells) on the leukocyte differential count suggests a bacterial etiology, this etiology frequently is suggested by the clinical presentation alone. Any material that has been aspirated due to fluctuance should be sent for culture and sensitivity. These cultures may show an organism that is resistant to prior antibiotic therapy, but occasionally they are negative due to eradication of the infectious agent by a prior course of antibiotics. Blood cultures should be obtained in any patient that appears toxic. Cultures of other sites that appear to be the primary site of the infection (eg, pharynx) should also be obtained, although results from pharyngeal cultures may not correlate with organisms isolated from a nodal abscess. 1 In contrast, laboratory evaluation plays a crucial role in determining the etiology of subacute, chronic, and generalized lymphadenopathy. Serologic tests for Bartonella henselae, syphilis (VDRL), toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), tularemia, brucellosis, histoplasmosis, and coccidiomycosis may suggest an infectious agent. A strongly positive intradermal tuberculin skin test is consistent with an infection due to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, whereas a lesser reaction to tuberculin skin testing is more consistent with a nontuberculous mycobacterial infection. Finally, serologic testing for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) should be considered in any patient with at-risk behaviors, generalized lymphadenitis, and unusual or recurrent infections caused by opportunistic organisms. Figure 2 presents a suggested algorithm for the diagnostic evaluation of a child with cervical lymphadenitis. 2",

Chest radiographs with two views should also be obtained in any patient with either symptomatic or asymptomatic cervical adenopathy. This is done to rule out critical airway compression if a biopsy under general anesthesia is planned. Other findings on plain radiographs may include bony lesions consistent with osteomyelitis or tumor involvement, evidence of hepatic and/or splenic enlargement, and/or calcifications involving the liver or spleen, suggesting a chronic granulomatous infection.

Advantages of US are that it is noninvasive and avoids ionizing radiation and can be performed without sedation in almost every patient.

Because staphylococci and streptococci are the most common pathogens, initial therapy usually includes a \u2424-lactamase resistant antibiotic; this agent is used because of the high incidence of penicillin resistance in isolated staphylococci. Very young patients or patients with severe symptoms (eg, cellulitis, high fever, or respiratory distress) may require hospitalization for initiation of parenteral antibiotic therapy and close observation. For older patients with dental or periodontal disease, the antibiotic regimen should include coverage for anaerobic oral flora (ie, penicillin V or clindamycin). Therapy is usually administered for 10 days and continued for at least 5 days beyond resolution of acute signs and symptoms. If a primary site is identified, cultures should be obtained and treatment is directed at that site as well. In most cases, symptomatic improvement should be noted after 2 to 3 days of therapy, although complete resolution of nodal enlargement may require several weeks. Failure to improve, or worsening of the patient's clinical condition, should prompt further diagnostic evaluation, including aspiration and culture, and consideration of an alternate antibiotic regimen. An etiologic agent can be recovered by needle aspiration of an affected node in 60% to 88% of cases. 2 The largest node with the most direct access is typically the best target for aspiration. The node should be entered through an area of healthy skin. Aspirated material should be examined by Gram stain and acid-fast stain and cultured for aerobic, anaerobic bacteria, and mycobacteria. If no purulent material is aspirated, a small amount of nonbacteriostatic saline can be injected into the node and then aspirated to obtain material for culture.",

This approach is particularly attractive when treating fluctuant nodes in cosmetically important areas. However, adequate drainage by aspiration may be difficult, if not impossible, in the uncooperative child or when the abscess cavity is loculated. These patients often require operative drainage under general anesthesia. At the time of operative drainage, an attempt should be made to open and drain all loculations. Specimens should be sent for Gram stain and aerobic and anaerobic cultures and for acid-fast stains and mycobacterial culture. Material for KOH prep and fungal cultures should be sent if the patient is immunocompromised, and tissue should be sent for histologic examination if there is suspicion of neoplasia.
