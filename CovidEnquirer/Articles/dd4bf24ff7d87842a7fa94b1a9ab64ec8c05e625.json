            "text": "Twenty specific pathogen free cats were experimentally infected with a virulent catpassaged type I field strain of FIPV. Eighteen cats succumbed within 2-4 weeks to effusive abdominal FIP, one survived for 6 weeks, and one seroconverted without outward signs of disease. A profound drop in the absolute count of blood lymphocytes occurred around 2 weeks post-infection (p.i.) in cats with rapid disease, while the decrease was delayed in the one cat that survived for 6 weeks. The absolute lymphocyte count of the surviving cat remained within normal range. Serum antibodies as measured by indirect immunofluorescence appeared after 2 weeks p.i. and correlated with the onset of disease signs. Viral genomic RNA was either not detectable by reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) or detectable only at very low levels in terminal tissues not involved directly in the infection, including hepatic and renal parenchyma, cardiac muscle, lung or popliteal lymph node. High tissue virus loads were measured in severely affected tissues such as the omentum, mesenteric lymph nodes and spleen. High levels of viral genomic RNA were also detected in whole ascitic fluid, with the cellular fraction containing 10-1000 times more viral RNA than the supernatant. Replicating virus was strongly associated with macrophages by immunohistochemistry. Virus was usually detected at relatively low levels in feces and there was no evidence of enterocyte infection. Viral genomic RNA was not detected at the level of test sensitivity in whole blood, plasma, or the white cell fraction in terminal samples from the 19 cats that succumbed or in the single survivor. These studies reconfirmed the effect of lymphopenia on disease outcome. FIPV genomic RNA was also found to be highly macrophage associated within diseased tissues and effusions as determined by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry but was not present in blood. \u00df",

Many experimental FIPV infection studies have also been limited to the final disease outcome, e.g., the testing of vaccine candidates for efficacy or testing of various types and biotypes of feline coronavirus isolates for disease potential (Pedersen, 2009 (Pedersen, , 2014a . Still other experimental studies have concentrated on specific virus-or host-related inflammatory or immune responses, also measured mainly in terminally ill cats (Pedersen, 2014a) . There are several longitudinal studies which have followed the entire disease course, but these studies were concerned mainly with disease signs such as fever, antibody responses and cytokine expression and not with viral loads in various tissues (Pedersen and Boyle, 1980; Weiss and Scott, 1981; Gunn-Moore et al., 1998a) . Only one other temporal study has been performed on FIPV levels in peripheral blood of experimentally infected cats (de Groot-Mijnes et al., 2005) . Although the authors suggested that there was a significant viremia associated with disease, viremia was erratic, observed mainly at week one post-infection and terminally, and the levels of viral genomic RNA, even when detected, were never high.",

            "text": "The emphasis of FIP diagnostics has long been on developing a simple blood test that would reliably and specifically detect the causative virus (Pedersen, 2014b) . Herrewegh et al. (1995) reported on the detection of viral RNA in blood serum or plasma of cats experimentally and naturally infected with FIPV using a nested RT-PCR that amplified a sequence within the 3 0 -UTR that was highly conserved among 10 different FIPV and FECV isolates. They were able to detect feline coronavirus RNA in the serum, plasma or ascitic fluid of 14/18 cats with naturally occurring FIP. Unfortunately, they were also able to detect viral RNA in the plasma of 2/7 healthy cats that were concurrently shedding FECV in their feces. An attempt was made to eliminate this problem of specificity by developing an RT-PCR that would only measure forms of coronavirus mRNA that were replication competent (Simons et al., 2005) . The rationale was that FECV would not replicate in the blood; therefore, the replicative form of genomic RNA would only be found in the blood of cats with FIP. The authors reported that this test was highly accurate in identifying cats with FIP. Shortly thereafter additional studies using the same assay demonstrated replicating forms of RNA in the blood of healthy cats infected with FECV (Can-Sahna et al., 2007; Kipar et al., 2010) , casting doubts on the specificity of such tests. The ability of FECV to replicate in blood monocyte/macrophages was also reported by other groups (Vogel et al., 2010) . Chang et al. (2012) subsequently identified two specific mutations within the fusion peptide of the spike protein of FIPVs that were not present in parent FECVs. These would seem to be logical mutations to incorporate into a RT-qPCR. However, a more recent study by Porter et al. (2014) demonstrated the presence of coronavirus with the FIPV-specific fusion peptide mutation in tissues of healthy cats. They concluded that the spike fusion region specific mutation was an adaptation of FECV for growth in blood monocyte/ macrophages and not directly related to disease. However, all of these various tests and objections are moot if FIPV genomic RNA is not consistently present in detectable levels by RT-qPCR in blood or blood fractions in cats with FIP.",

The specificity of the fluorogenic RT-PCR was confirmed by sequencing the plasmid pT7-StFCoV by the chain termination method (Microsynth, Balgach, Switzerland). The Real-time PCR was run with three contamination controls including regular negative controls, negative extraction controls and laboratory monitoring for the absence of random positive PCR signals. To eliminate PCR product carry over, all reactions included the AmpErase UNG system (Pang et al., 1992) . Absence of PCR inhibition is confirmed by using a spike-in internal positive control. This procedure was reportedly 10-100 times more sensitive in detecting FIPV mRNA than that achieved with a nested RT-PCR that was described earlier (Herrewegh et al., 1995) . The sensitivity of the assay plotting cycle threshold (CT) values against FIPV genomic RNA copy numbers is shown in Fig. 1 .

The occurrence of fever coincided with the appearance of serum antibodies, as has been previously shown (Pedersen and Boyle, 1980; Weiss and Scott, 1981) . There was no relationship between the magnitude of the antibody response and disease outcome, with the highest titer being found in one cat that lived 6 weeks before succumbing. The relationship between the onset of disease signs and appearance of antibodies was not coincidental. Previous studies have shown that virus neutralizing antibodies to S gene epitopes play a key role in enhancing disease by facilitating the uptake of FIPV by macrophages (Hohdatsu et al., 1998; Dewerchin et al., 2006) and participating in antigen/ antibody/complement mediated vasculitis (Pedersen and Boyle, 1980; Jacobse-Geels et al., 1982) .

A similarly profound decrease in blood lymphocytes has been previously associated with disease signs in experimental FIPV infection (Dean et al., 2003) , and varying degrees of lymphopenia are a common feature of naturally occurring FIP (Pedersen, 2009) . Although T lymphocytes were entering diseased tissues, their proportion was low compared to macrophages and their numbers not appear sufficient to be solely responsible for the pronounced lymphopenia. Previous studies have associated lymphopenia in cats with experimentally induced FIP with a major apoptotic event (Dean et al., 2003) . Apoptosis of lymphocytes has been implicated as a cause of lymphopenia and associated immunodeficiency in other virus infections (Razvi and Welsh, 1993) .",

This conclusion has been mirrored by Fan et al. (2014) , who postulated that ''depending on intensity of the apoptosis of healthy cells, the apoptosis can either promote or comfort the long-term evolution of HIV infection.' ' We did not determine the lymphocyte subclasses that were most affected although the severity of the lymphocyte depletion suggested that both T and B subsets were involved. However, previous studies indicate that T cells, NK cells and T regs are most severely reduced in cats with naturally and experimentally induced FIP (Dean et al., 2003; Vermeulen et al., 2013) .",

It was not surprising to find high levels of virus terminally in grossly diseased tissues such as omentum, spleen and mesenteric lymph node and in abdominal effusions, and lower levels in organs such as liver, kidney, heart and lung that did not show gross parenchymal involvement. The levels of viral genomic RNA paralleled the intensity of the inflammatory response, which in turn paralleled the numbers of infected macrophages in the tissues or effusion. The selective targeting of macrophages by FIPV, which has been previously demonstrated (Pedersen and Boyle, 1980; Kipar et al., 1998) , was reconfirmed by immunohistochemistry of heavily involved tissues such as the omentum, spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes and caecum, and ascitic fluid. Cells present in the ascitic fluid, which were predominantly macrophages, contained from 90 to 99% of the virus present in the each sample. The most parsimonious scenario would be that virus released from infected macrophages is immediately taken up by other macrophages and that this cycle builds in intensity over time as more and more virus is produced and more and more macrophages either arrive from the blood as monocytes or proliferate locally from adventitial progenitors (Psaltis et al., 2014) . The strict containment of an infectious agent in a single cell type such as macrophages is reminiscent of fastidious mycobacterial diseases of cats (Malik et al., 2013) and tuberculosis of humans (Mehrotra et al., 2014) .",

(1998b) used RT-PCR to detect FIPV genomic RNA in whole blood or plasma of 80-90% cats with FIP, both directly and after co-cultivation with WFE cells; plasma was just as likely to test positive as whole blood. However, they also found that 83-89% of healthy cats from FECV enzootic households also tested positive. de Groot-Mijnes et al. (2005) described a viremic phase in a subset of cats with FIP but virus loads were derived from RT-qPCR and RT-PCR data, as well as other data not shown. Moreover, virus levels where elevated usually at week one and terminally and were usually associated with CT values from 36 to 40. We conclude that viremia even in cats with highly fulminant experimentally induced FIP is either nonexistent or below the reliable detection limits of highly sensitive RT-qPCR at all stages of the infection. Virus detection should concentrate on tissues and effusions containing FIPV infected macrophages.",
