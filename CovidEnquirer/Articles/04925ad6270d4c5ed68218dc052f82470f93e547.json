Methods: This multicentre randomized controlled trial focused on adults with LRTI not suspected for pneumonia. Patients were randomized to receive either antibiotic (amoxicillin 1 g) or placebo three times daily for 7 consecutive days using computer-generated random numbers (follow-up 28 days). In this secondary analysis of the trial, symptom duration (primary outcome), symptom severity (scored 0e6), and illness deterioration (reconsultation with new or worsening symptoms, or hospital admission) were analysed in pre-specified subgroups using regression models. Subgroups of interest were patients with a (strictly) bacterial, (strictly) viral, or combined infection, and patients with elevated values of procalcitonin, C-reactive protein, or blood urea nitrogen. Results: 2058 patients (amoxicillin n \u00bc 1036; placebo n \u00bc 1022) were randomized. Treatment did not affect symptom duration (n \u00bc 1793). Patients from whom a bacterial pathogen only was isolated (n \u00bc 207) benefited from amoxicillin in that symptom severity (n \u00bc 804) was reduced by 0.26 points (95% CI \u00c00.48 to \u00c00.03). The odds of illness deterioration (n \u00bc 2024) was 0.24 (95% CI 0.11 to 0.53) times lower from treatment with amoxicillin when both a bacterial and a viral pathogen were isolated (combined infection; n \u00bc 198). Conclusions: Amoxicillin may reduce the risk of illness deterioration in patients with a combined bacterial and viral infection. We found no clinically meaningful benefit from amoxicillin treatment in other subgroups. R. Bruyndonckx, Clin Microbiol Infect 2018;24:871 ",

Antibiotic treatment is of limited benefit both overall and in subgroups at higher risk of an adverse course. Nevertheless, antibiotics are prescribed for most patients with LRTI [2e5] . Primary analysis of the largest trial to date, the Genomics to combat Resistance against Antibiotics in Community-acquired LRTI (GRACE; http://www.grace-lrti.org) randomized placebo controlled trial (RCT), found no clear evidence of a clinically meaningful benefit from treatment with amoxicillin [2] . A follow-up analysis that examined the benefit of amoxicillin in clinically defined subgroups of patients with LRTI who are most likely to be prescribed antibiotics (i.e. patients with green sputum or those with significant comorbidities) found no clear evidence of meaningful benefit from amoxicillin even in these subgroups [3] . Only those patients with evidence of pneumonia on chest X-ray benefited from amoxicillin treatment [6] .",

In summary, non-pregnant adults presenting to primary care with acute cough, in whom pneumonia was not suspected, were recruited between November 2007 and April 2010 by primary care physicians in 16 networks across 12 European countries (Belgium, England, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, and Wales). Patients who did not consume antibiotics in the month before consultation were randomized to receive either an antibiotic (amoxicillin 1 g) or a placebo three times daily for 7 consecutive days. All patients were asked to complete a symptom diary daily until their symptoms had settled (up to a maximum of 28 days). The diary recorded the severity of cough, phlegm, shortness of breath, wheezing, runny nose, chest pain, muscle ache, headache, disturbed sleep, feeling unwell, fever, and interference with daily activities. Symptoms were scored on a 7-point scale (0: normal/not affected, 1: very little problem, 2: slight problem, 3: moderately bad, 4: bad, 5: very bad, 6: as bad as it could be) [10] . For each patient, a nasopharyngeal swab was taken on the day of presentation. This sample was then analysed using bacterial and viral polymerase chain reaction analysis. We tested for both bacterial pathogens (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis, Legionella pneumoniae) and viral pathogens (rhinovirus, influenza virus, coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, polyomavirus, bocavirus) [11] . Samples with a pathogen present, either bacterial or viral, were referred to as confirmed infections. Samples in which a bacterial pathogen was detected were referred to as bacterial infections. If no viral pathogens were present in these samples, they were referred to as purely bacterial infections. Samples in which a viral pathogen was detected were referred to as viral infections. If no bacterial pathogens were present in these samples, they were referred to as purely viral infections. Samples in which both a bacterial and a viral pathogen were detected were referred to as combined infections. Note that these categorizations are not mutually exclusive. Within 24 hours of presentation to the GP, a venous blood sample was obtained. CRP and BUN were measured using the conventional immunoturbidimetric method. PCT was measured using a rapid sensitive assay [11] . We defined an elevated CRP, PCT, and BUN as the top 25% of measurements in our patient population (referred to as high CRP, high PCT, and high BUN, respectively).",

Previous analyses from this GRACE trial of amoxicillin versus placebo in patients presenting with acute LRTI in primary care found that amoxicillin provided little benefit, both overall and in patients aged 60 and above. In fact, amoxicillin treatment was even associated with slight harm, in that more patients experienced side effects than were prevented from experiencing illness deterioration [2] . A secondary subgroup analysis found that only those patients with significant comorbidities (mostly asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) benefitted from amoxicillin treatment in terms of reduced symptom severity between days 2 and 4 after first consulting in primary care.

Given that the amoxicillin treatment is on average ineffective in patients with a purely bacterial infection, the effect of antibiotics in patients with a bacterial infection is driven by the effect in those patients with a combined infection. Assuming that this effect was not a result of chance, it may be biologically plausible: viral infections may predispose to secondary bacterial infections by causing mucosal damage or inflammation, lead to a longer or more severe illness course, and thus make these patients more likely to benefit from amoxicillin [17e19]. However, the number of patients with a combined infection (9.6%; 199/2056) who could potentially benefit from antibiotic treatment indicates that the clinical impact of developing prediction rules or point of care tests for such patients is limited: 50 patients would have to be tested with a range of bacterial and viral diagnostic tests to identify five who have a combined infection, and all of these would have to be treated for one individual to benefit. Not only would such a policy need to be shown to be cost-effective in the short term, but the potential medicalization of illnesses (by signalling to the population that people with LRTI need to be tested) would have to be considered. Neither symptom duration nor symptom severity were clearly affected by amoxicillin treatment, and the odds of illness deterioration was influenced by amoxicillin treatment only in a very specific subgroup. The potential benefits of amoxicillin treatment should therefore be balanced against side effects, such as diarrhoea, nausea, or skin rash and the long-term risk of antibiotic resistance [20] . Thus, most of these patients should probably not be prescribed an antibiotic, and/or clinicians could consider using a delayed antibiotic prescription to avoid inappropriate use of antibiotics [21] . Nevertheless, it is important to be aware of the potential harm caused by under-treatment of a combined infection, so all patients must be given clear advice about when to reconsult. ",

Some of the subgroups we studied were small, increasing risk of a Type II error. The subgroup with combined bacterial and viral infection was also not specified in advance, which increases the risk of a 'false positive' result (type I error) from multiple comparisons, and thus the results should be interpreted with caution. Similarly, the impact of amoxicillin on symptom severity among patients with a purely bacterial infection was of borderline significance, and was also of doubtful clinical importance. In contrast, the impact of amoxicillin treatment on reducing the risk of illness deterioration in patients with a bacterial infection, and in patients with a combined infection, was highly statistically significant.",
