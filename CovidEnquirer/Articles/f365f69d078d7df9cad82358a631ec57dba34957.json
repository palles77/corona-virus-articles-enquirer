Positive selection was not detected and mutation rates ranged from 10 \u22124 to 10 \u22126 substitutions/site/year for Mass and Conn IBV types where attenuated live vaccines are routinely used to control the disease. In contrast, for CAL type viruses, for which no vaccine exists, positive selection was detected and mutation rates were 10 fold higher ranging from 10 \u22122 to 10 \u22123 substitutions/site/year. Lower levels of genetic diversity among the Mass and Conn viruses as well as sequence similarities with vaccine virus genomes suggest that the origin of the Mass and all but one of the Conn viruses was likely vaccine virus that had been circulating in the field for an unknown but apparently short period of time. The genetic data also identified a recombinant IBV isolate with 7 breakpoints distributed across the entire genome suggesting that viruses within the same serotype can have a high degree of genetic variability outside of the spike gene. These data are important because inaccurate measures of genetic diversity and mutation rates could lead to underestimates of the ability of IBV to change and potentially emerge to cause disease.",

Serotype-specific attenuated live vaccines are routinely used to control the disease, yet IBV remains one of the most widely reported respiratory diseases of chickens worldwide resulting in significant economic loss due to reduction in weight gains and feed efficiency, and condemnations at the processing plant. The virus can also cause permanent oviduct damage in layers and some strains of the virus cause nephritis, which when severe can result in significant mortality.",

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus is an enveloped, positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus with a genome size of approximately 27 kb (Holmes, 1991) . The 5 two-thirds of the genome, approximately 21 kb, encodes two large overlapping open reading frames (ORFs), 1a and 1ab, which encode 15 non-structural proteins (nsps), nsps 2-16 (IBV does not have nsp 1) including a papainlike protease 2 (the PL1 protease is truncated and non-functional in IBV), a main protease, the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) and several other non-structural proteins involved in making up the replication transcription complex. The remaining one-third of the genome encodes four structural proteins; spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), and a number of nonstructural proteins. The spike glycoprotein of IBV forms projections on the surface of the virion. Spike is post-translationally cleaved into S1 and S2 subunits with the S1 subunit forming the outermost portion and S2 forming a stalk like structure that is embed in the viral membrane. The S1 subunit contains hypervariable regions that play a role in attachment to host cell receptors, membrane fusion and entry into the host cell, and it contains conformationally-dependent virus-neutralizing and serotype-specific epitopes (Cavanagh et al., 1998; Niesters, 1987 It is extremely difficult to control IBV because little or no cross protection occurs between numerous different types of the virus. Coronaviruses evolve by a process of natural selection working on mutations and recombination events (Domingo and Holland, 1997; Moya et al., 2004; Vijaykrishna et al., 2007) . These factors contribute to diverse subpopulations of the virus that continually emerge to form new and variant IBV types. In the absence of a specific vaccine, the mutation rate for the hypervariable region in the S1 gene of the 793/B type of IBV was reported as 3 \u00d7 10 \u22123 substitutions/site/year (Cavanagh et al., 1998) while the mutation rate for the GA98 virus, which emerged as a result of selection pressure driven by vaccine usage, was reported to be 1.5 \u00d7 10 \u22122 substitutions/site/year in the hypervariable region of S1 (Lee and Jackwood, 2001) .",

We sequenced the full-length genome from 11 IBV field isolates of three different serotypes, Massachusetts (Mass), Connecticut (Conn) and California (CAL) isolated over a 41, 25 and 8-year period respectively. The genome sequences were aligned and phylogenetic analysis was conducted to examine genetic relationships between the viruses. Estimates of the rates of mutation were calculated and evidence of recombination was investigated for each of the full-length genome sequences. To our knowledge, this is the first study to identify polymorphisms and determine mutation rates using full-length genome sequences of IB viruses isolated over a multi-year time span.",

Viral RNA extraction, amplification and genome sequence determination Viral RNA extraction, reverse transcription and polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), library construction and sequencing were conducted as previously described (Jackwood et al., 2010) . Briefly, the viruses were filtered through a 0.8 m filter then through a 0.22 m filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA) and viral RNA was purified using the High Pure RNA Isolation Kit according to the manufacturer's recommendation (Roche Diagnostic Corporation, Foster City, CA). The RT-PCR amplifications were performed with the Takara RNA LA PCR kit (Takara Bio Inc., Otsu, Shiga, Japan) using a random primer and an amplification primer in a strand displacement amplification reaction following the manufacture's protocol. The sequence of the random reverse transcription primer was 5 -AGCGGGGGTTGTCGAATGTTTGANNNNN-3 , and the amplification primer sequence was 5 -AGCGGGGGTTGTCGAATGTTTGA-3 . Both primers were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc. (IDT, Coralville, IA). A master mix for the RT reaction was prepared, which included MgCl (5 mM), 10X RNA PCR buffer (1\u00d7), dNTP mixture (1 mM), RNase inhibitor (1 units/l), reverse transcriptase (.25 units/l), 5 degenerate primer (2.5 M), and RNA (5.75 l/reaction) then 10 l per sample was aliquoted in a thermocycler tube. The RT reaction conditions were 10 min at 30 \u2022 C for the primer annealing then 1 h at 50 \u2022 C for extension followed by a five-minute incubation at 99 \u2022 C for inactivation of the enzyme and a 5-min period at 5 \u2022 C. A PCR master mix, which included at the final concentrations: MgCl (2.5 mM), 10X LA PCR Buffer (1\u00d7), sterilized distilled water (32.25 l), Takara LA Taq (1.25 U/50 l), and 5 primer (0.2 M) was prepared and 10 l of the RT reaction was added to 40 l of the mix.

            "text": "The majority of emerging infectious diseases are caused by RNA viruses. Presumably, high rates of mutation and rapid replication drive their evolution. Infectious bronchitis virus, like most RNA viruses, undergoes a high rate of genetic change that contributes to diverse subpopulations of the virus that continually emerge to form new variants of existing strains as well as completely new types of the virus. New variants and types of IBV are defined by the sequence of the spike glycoprotein and/or by specific antibodies against spike, and for many IBV types, only spike sequences are available. To examine sequence changes not only in spike but also over the entire length of the genome, we sequenced the full-length genomes of 5 Mass type, 4 Conn type and 2 CAL type IBV field viruses that were isolated over a 41, 25 and 8 year period respectively. All of the viruses were obtained from chickens with clinical signs of the disease. Alignments of the full-length genome sequences showed that the Mass viruses had \u226592.4% identity (\u226593.7% if the recombined IBV/Mass/06 is not included), the CAL viruses had \u226593.8% identity and the Conn viruses varied the least, at \u226599.8% identity. Examination of the mutation rates for the ORF1ab, S1, E, M and N genes showed, in general, that the CAL viruses had rates between 10 \u22124 and 10 \u22122 substitutions/site/year, whereas the Conn and Mass viruses had lower mutation rates that ranged from 10 \u22124 to 10 \u22126 substitutions/site/year. In addition, the E gene in the Conn viruses showed no signs of change. Although the egg passage level of all the viruses used in this study was relatively low (\u226415 passages) it is possible some genetic changes could have been introduced as a result of propagation in embryonated eggs. However phenotypic change is likely to be minimal since it typically takes 75 or more egg passages to attenuate IBV and in a study that examined genetic changes in the highly variable S1 gene following 10 passages in embryonated eggs, five viruses had no changes, two viruses had only 2 nucleotide changes one virus had only 1 change (McKinley et al., 2008) .",

It has been shown that IBV can be shed for long periods of time and that vaccine viruses can persist in the field and revert to cause disease (Farsang et al., 2002; Jackwood et al., 2009; Matthijs et al., 2008; Naqi et al., 2003) . Thus, it is possible that vaccine viruses are more likely to be isolated from the field because they may be more abundant having displaced field viruses of the same type or because they are more easily isolated since they are adapted to grow in embryonated eggs. Because the Mass and Conn type viruses were isolated from clinically diseased chickens suggests that if they were originally vaccine viruses then they have likely acquired the sequence changes necessary for pathogenicity. Further studies would need to be conducted on vaccine viruses and pathogenic strains to gain a better understanding of the molecular changes necessary for coronavirus reversion to pathogenicity.",

            "text": "Recombination contributes to the genetic diversity of coronaviruses and can lead to the emergence of new viruses and outbreaks of new diseases (Holmes, 2009; Jia et al., 1995; Woo et al., 2009) . Although the IBV/Mass/06 virus is identified as a Mass type virus based on characterization of the spike glycoprotein, it was shown herein to be a recombinant virus with Conn and CAL viruses as major parents. Eight regions defined by 7 breakpoints distributed across the entire genome were identified. Region VII was similar to other Mass type viruses, which was expected because that region includes the entire S1 gene. However, CAL like sequences were found in regions I, III and V, Conn sequences were found in regions II, IV and VIII, and region VI was found be similar to the H120 Mass type vaccine strain. High frequencies of recombination including recombination events between vaccine and field strains have been reported for IBV (Brooks et al., 2004; Cavanagh et al., 1992; Fang et al., 2005; Jackwood et al., 2010; Kottier et al., 1995b; Lee and Jackwood, 2000; Yu et al., 2001) . In addition, IBV pathogenicity was shown to be polygenic, involving spike as well as replicase proteins (Ammayappan et al., 2009; Armesto et al., 2009; Cavanagh, 2007; Hodgson et al., 2004) . Although IBV type is defined by the spike glycoprotein, our data shows that viruses within the same type can have vastly divergent sequences in other regions of their genome including regions that contain genes important for pathogenicity. If recombination occurs outside of the spike gene where a pathogenic field virus acquires attenuated vaccine virus sequences, the outcome would likely be a relatively benign virus regardless of the virus types (spike sequences) involved. Furthermore, if a vaccine virus circulating in a flock recombines with a pathogenic virus outside of the spike gene, resulting in the vaccine virus becoming pathogenic, the outcome is still likely to be of little or no consequence since the birds would presumably be immune to the unchanging spike. However, in the event that a pathogenic field virus recombines with either a vaccine virus or another pathogenic virus and acquires a new or unique spike glycoprotein gene, the outcome could be the emergence of a new virus capable of causing disease. This was recently shown for TCoV (Jackwood et al., 2010) . Although new coronaviruses can emerge and cause disease as a result of recombination it appears that the emergence of most variant or new IBV types is due to accumulation of mutations in the spike glycoprotein over time (Cavanagh et al., 2005; Jackwood et al., 2005 Jackwood et al., , 2007 Lee and Jackwood, 2001; Nix et al., 2000) . Thus, until pathogenicity genes can be specifically identified, monitoring the spike gene in IBV appears to be the most reliable measure of genetic change leading to the emergence of new viruses capable of causing disease. This is the first study to identify genetic changes and mutation rates using full-length genome sequences of IBVs isolated over many years. Our data show that mutation rates are lower and that positive selection was not occurring for IBV types where attenuated live vaccines are used compared to an IBV type were no vaccine exists, suggesting that the virus isolates examined were re-isolated vaccine viruses that have been circulating in the field for a relatively short-period of time. This observation is extremely important because it could lead to incorrect estimates of mutation rates for RNA viruses where modified live vaccines are used to control the disease. In this study, we also identified a recombinant IBV isolate with two major parents and no fewer than 7 breakpoints distributed across the entire genome. Although recombination among coronaviruses can contribute to genetic diversity of the virus and recombination has been shown to lead to the emergence of new viruses, it appears that monitoring mutations in the spike gene that accumulate over time is currently the best method of identifying potentially new genetic variants and IBV types capable of causing disease.",
