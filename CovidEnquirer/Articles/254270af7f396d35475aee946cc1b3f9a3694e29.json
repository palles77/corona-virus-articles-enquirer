Recent work identified memory-like CXCR5 + TCF1 + CD8 + T cells that sustain T cell responses during persistent infection and proliferate upon anti-PD1 treatment. Approaches to expand these cells are sought. We show that blockade of interferon type 1 (IFN-I) receptor leads to CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell expansion in an IL-27-and STAT1-dependent manner. IFNAR1 blockade promoted accelerated cell division and retention of TCF1 in virus-specific CD8 + T cells. We found that CD8 + T cell-intrinsic IL-27 signaling safeguards the ability of TCF1 hi cells to maintain proliferation and avoid terminal differentiation or programmed cell death. Mechanistically, IL-27 endowed rapidly dividing cells with IRF1, a transcription factor that was required for sustained division in a cell-intrinsic manner. These findings reveal that IL-27 opposes IFN-I to uncouple effector differentiation from cell division and suggest that IL-27 signaling could be exploited to augment self-renewing T cells in chronic infections and cancer.",

Exhausted T cells display poor effector functions and increased surface expression of multiple inhibitory receptors which maintain the hyporesponsive state (Barber et al., 2006; Blackburn et al., 2009) . Blockade of inhibitory receptors can rescue specific functions and enhance their ability to control persistent viral infections and cancer (Barber et al., 2006; Blackburn et al., 2009; Pardoll, 2012) . Recently, a subpopulation of exhausted, memory-like, self-renewing CD8 + T cells expressing CXCR5 and the transcription factor TCF1 was identified in mouse persistent lymphocytic choriomeningitis mammarenavirus (LCMV) clone 13 (Cl13) infection and cancer models and patients infected with hepatitis C virus and HIV (He et al., 2016; Im et al., 2016; Leong et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2016; Utzschneider et al., 2016; Wu et al., 2016; Petrovas et al., 2017; Wieland et al., 2017) . These CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells, also termed T follicular cytotoxic cells (Leong et al., 2016) , were required to sustain antiviral T cell responses to chronic infections (Utzschneider et al., 2016) and provide the proliferative burst and effector function following anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy (Im et al., 2016) . Given the efficacy of anti-PD-1 in cancer therapy coupled to the fact that only a finite number of PD-1-responsive CD8 + T cells exist in patients , understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell differentiation and expansion will provide crucial knowledge for improving the efficacy of immunotherapy in both persistent infections and cancer.",

Multiple transcription factors controlling CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell generation have been identified: in addition to TCF1, which is required for CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell formation, there are CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell-promoting transcription factors BCL6 and FOXO1 and CXCR5 + CD8 + T cellrestraining factors BLIMP1, ID2, IRF4, RUNX3, and STAT4, which favor effector CD8 + differentiation (Leong et al., 2016; Utzschneider et al., 2016 Utzschneider et al., , 2018 Man et al., 2017; Shan et al., 2017; Danilo et al., 2018) . Despite recent understanding of the transcription factors required for CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell generation, less is known about how specific cytokine inputs regulate CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell differentiation and expansion. To date, only type 1 IFN (IFN-I) and have been demonstrated to directly regulate the CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell population, with both cytokines reported to negatively control CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell formation Danilo et al., 2018) . During clonal expansion, effector differentiation is coupled to cell division (Lin et al., 2016) . In the course of viral infection, TCF1 hi cells can enter a rapid-amplifying state that is characterized by a higher expression of effector-associated molecules such as T-bet and IFN\u03b3 compared with quiescent TCF1 hi cells (Lin et al., 2016) . Whether IFN-I restrains CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells by promoting loss of TCF1 in all CD8 + T cells, or by inhibiting division of TCF1 hi cells, is unknown. Moreover, cytokines that positively regulate CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell differentiation or expansion are yet to be identified (Hashimoto et al., 2019) .",

            "text": "Most studies focusing on how IL-27 signaling regulates T cell responses center on modulation of CD4 + T cell subsets (Hunter and Kastelein, 2012) . Effector CD8 + T cell responses seem to be attenuated by IL-27 during coronavirus and influenza infections (de Aquino et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2014) , but not LCMV Cl13 infection (Harker et al., 2013) . IL-27 enhances the expansion of memory CD8 + T cells following subunit vaccination or tumor challenge (Liu et al., 2013; Pennock et al., 2014) but not vaccinia virus vaccination, and Sendai and influenza virus-specific memory CD8 + T cells seem to lose responsiveness to IL-27 (Perona-Wright et al., 2012) . IL-27 also promotes CD8 + T cell function in vitro (Morishima et al., 2005) , whereas others reported direct suppression of IFN\u03b3 production by IL-27 (Liu et al., 2014) . Even in cancer, some have observed enhancement of CD8 + responses by IL-27 (Salcedo et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2013) , while others attribute induction of an inhibitory gene program in CD8 + T cells to IL-27 (Chihara et al., 2018) . Thus, the regulation of CD8 + T cell responses by IL-27 is complex, and IL-27's effect on CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells is unknown. Here we uncover a role for IL-27 in promoting amplification of CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells, preventing death of rapidly proliferating nonterminally differentiated virus-specific cells, and show that this effect is dependent on STAT1 and IRF1 and is unique to IL-27 among IL-12 family cytokines.",

Here we asked whether virus-specific CD8 + T cells generated in an IFN-I-deficient environment would respond differently than CD8 + T cells generated in an IFN-I-replete environment.

Strikingly, among the top 15 genes most significantly up-regulated in aIFNAR1-versus isotype-treated mice were Cxcr5, Tcf7, and Id3 ( Fig. 1 C) . These genes mark the recently identified population of CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells, characterized by a lower degree of exhaustion and higher proliferative potential. Moreover, genes associated with effector function such as Gzmb were significantly down-regulated in the aIFNAR1 group (Fig. 1, C and D) . Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of genes that distinguish CXCR5 + TIM3 \u2212 CD8 + T cells from their CXCR5 \u2212 TIM3 + counterparts (Im et al., 2016) showed a significant up-regulation of the CXCR5 + TIM3 \u2212 gene signature in aIFNAR1-treated mice (Fig. 1 E) . Indeed, when we examined specifically CXCR5 + P14 and CXCR5 \u2212 P14 cells using RNA-seq data (Leong et al., 2016) , the transcriptional variance separating CXCR5 + from CXCR5 \u2212 P14 cells was described by the same principal component as variance separating P14 cells from aIFNAR1-versus isotype-treated mice (Fig. 1 F) . These results suggest that IFNAR activity skews CD8 + T cells toward the CXCR5 \u2212 phenotype. Accordingly, in WT mice treated with aIFNAR1 versus isotype antibodies, we observed a significant increase in the percentage and total number of virus-specific CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells (Fig. 1 G) . We also observed commensurate increases in the expression of BCL6 and TCF1, transcription factors required for CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell differentiation, following IFNAR1 blockade (Figs. 1 H and S1 C). Moreover, the increases in CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell numbers following aIFNAR1 Figure 1 . Blockade of IFN-I promotes the expansion of virus-specific CXCR5 + TIM3 \u2212 CD8 + T cells.

At 8 dpi, 10 5 P14 cells were sorted from these mice and then adoptively transferred into another two groups of CD90.2 + mice, followed by LCMV Cl13 infection the next day.

(C-F) P14 cells were transferred into isotype-or aIFNAR1-treated mice, followed by LCMV Cl13 infection the next day.

Publicly available datasets revealed that purified CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells express higher levels of ISGs and IFN-I receptor genes compared with CXCR5 \u2212 effector cells, suggesting that CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells are more sensitive to IFN-I than CXCR5 \u2212 CD8 + T cells ( Paradoxically, ISGs were also significantly up-regulated in virus-specific CD8 + T cells from aIFNAR1-treated mice compared with isotype-treated controls (Fig. S2 B) . Given that mice were treated with aIFNAR1 antibody 24 h before infection, the observed up-regulation of ISGs at 9 dpi could potentially be explained by a rebound in IFNAR signaling in aIFNAR1-treated mice. To determine whether latent up-regulation of ISGs was required for CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell expansion, we administered aIFNAR1 continuously throughout Cl13 infection and examined virus-specific CD8 + T cells by RNA-seq and CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells by flow cytometry. Continuous aIFNAR1 treatment still caused a significant expansion of percentage and number of virusspecific CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells (Fig. S2 C) . However, ISGs were significantly down-regulated overall in virus-specific CD8 + T cells from the continuously treated mice (Fig. S2 D) , apart from a limited number of individual ISGs such as Irf1. These results suggest that global up-regulation of ISGs is not required for CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell expansion. IFN-I is known to activate STAT1 and STAT2, which can signal either as homodimers or as part of the STAT1-STAT2-IRF9 heterotrimeric complex (IGSF3). To determine how IFN-I prevents CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell expansion, we treated STAT1deficient and STAT2-deficient mice with aIFNAR1 and isotype control antibody and analyzed CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells at 9 dpi. Although aIFNAR1-treated STAT1-deficient mice exhibited a slight increase in the frequency of CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells among virus-specific CD8 + T cells, the total number of CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells was unaffected by aIFNAR1 treatment (Fig. 2 C) . In contrast, STAT2-deficient mice experienced an inversion of the effect that aIFNAR1 has on CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells in WT mice: percentages and numbers of CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells were high in isotype-treated STAT2-deficient mice compared with WT controls and significantly decreased upon aIFNAR1 treatment ( Fig. 2 D) . These data suggest that IFN-I signaling through STAT2 restrains CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell expansion, whereas STAT1 is required for aIFNAR1-mediated CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell expansion.",

Among STAT1 activators are two cytokines of the IL-12 family: IL-27 and IL-35 (Vignali and Kuchroo, 2012) . We tested whether cytokine subunits of the IL-12 family played a role in the expansion of CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells after IFNAR1 blockade. Mice deficient in p40, a component of IL-12 and IL-23 cytokines, responded similarly to WT mice upon aIFNAR1 treatment (Figs. 3 A and S3 A). In contrast, CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell expansion was completely abolished in mice deficient in EBI3 (a component of IL-27 and IL-35 cytokines; Figs. 3 A and S3 A). Mice treated with aIFNAR1 also showed a significant increase in percentage and total number of CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells in inguinal lymph nodes compared with isotypetreated controls, and this effect was fully dependent on EBI3 (Fig. S3 B) . Further, deficiency of p35 (an IL-35-specific subunit) or deficiency of IL-6 allowed normal CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell expansion following aIFNAR1 treatment (Figs. 3 A and S3 A). These data suggest that IL-27, but not IL-12, IL-23, IL-35, or IL-6, is required for aIFNAR1-induced CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell expansion.",

RT-PCR revealed a slight increase in the abundance of IL-27 (p28) transcript in spleens of aIFNAR1-treated mice (Fig. 3 D) . However, there was a more than twofold increase in the expression of GP130 subunit of the IL-27 receptor on virus-specific CD8 + T cells following aIFNAR1 treatment compared with isotype control treatment (Fig. 3 E) . The mRNA level of Il27ra was also increased in P14 from aIFNAR1-treated hosts (Fig. 3 F) . Moreover, treatment of cells with recombinant IFN-I led to a significant reduction in the expression of GP130 at both mRNA and protein levels (Fig. 3 G) . These observations suggest that IFN-I directly modulates IL-27 signaling by reducing the expression of IL-27R subunit GP130. In summary, these results show that IL-27 signaling is required for the expansion of CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells upon aIFNAR1 treatment, but that IL-27 treatment is sufficient to drive an expansion of CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells even in the presence of IFN-I signals.",

Interestingly, the proportion of CD8 + T cells among splenocytes and the total number of GP33-specific CD8 + T cells at 9 dpi were the lowest in Il27ra \u2212/\u2212 mice treated with aIFNAR1 of all experimental groups (Fig. 4 A) . We therefore asked whether CD8 + T cell-intrinsic IL-27 signaling was required for clonal expansion following aIFNAR1 treatment. To address this, WT CD45.1 + mice were subjected to lethal irradiation followed by bone marrow transplantation of 50% CD45.1 + Il27ra +/+ and 50% CD45.2 + Il27ra \u2212/\u2212 bone marrow, treated with aIFNAR1 or isotype antibodies, and infected with Cl13 (Fig. 4 B) . There was a slight but significant excess of CD45.2 + (Il27ra \u2212/\u2212 ) versus CD45.1 + (WT) cells in the spleens of the infected chimeric mice (Fig. S4 A) . Although we saw a modest increase in the percentage of GP33specific CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells in CD8 + T cells originating from IL-27R-deficient CD45.2 + bone marrow, the GP276-specific CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells did not increase in percentage or total number in aIFNAR1-versus isotype-treated mice (Figs. 4 B and S4 B) . In comparison, CD45.1 + bone marrow gave rise to T cells that produced CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell increases after aIFNAR1 treatment similar to those of WT mice. Moreover, the percentage of GP33specific T cells of CD8 + T cells were similar across all groups except for Il27ra \u2212/\u2212 CD8 + T cells in aIFNAR1-treated mice, in which the GP33-specific proportion was dramatically reduced (Fig. S4 C) . Collectively, these data show that cell-intrinsic IL-27R is required for the aIFNAR1-induced expansion of CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells and suggest that IL-27R compensates for the loss of CD8 + T cell-intrinsic IFNAR signaling.",

Recipient mice treated with isotype control showed similar proliferation profiles for Il27ra \u2212/\u2212 and WT P14 cells at 2 and 3 dpi (Fig. 4 , C and D). In contrast, aIFNAR1-treated mice exhibited a significant increase in divided P14 cells, and most of these proliferating cells were TCF1 hi compared with isotype-treated mice (Fig. 4 , C and D). Although IL-27R deficiency seemed to have no effect on the proliferation of TCF1 hi P14 cells, there was an excess of Il27ra \u2212/\u2212 P14 cells that had undergone at least one division compared with their WT counterparts (Fig. 4 C) , and this was associated with a larger Il27ra \u2212/\u2212 P14 versus WT P14 cell pool at 2-3 dpi in each recipient mouse (Fig. 4 E) . However, Il27ra \u2212/\u2212 P14 cells were unable to maintain the accelerated division and were outnumbered by WT P14 cells from day 4 onward (Fig. 4 E) . In accordance with the reduced abundance of Il27ra \u2212/\u2212 P14, we observed a decreased proportion of Il27ra \u2212/\u2212 versus WT P14 in S phase of the cell cycle from day 3.5, and this difference became more dramatic at 6 dpi (Figs. 4 F and S4 F). In addition, Il27ra \u2212/\u2212 P14 cells were more susceptible to caspase-3-dependent cell per group, and data are representative of three independent experiments.

In a mixed adoptive transfer experiment analogous to the experiment above, significantly fewer Stat1 \u2212/\u2212 P14 cells were recovered from recipient mice following infection, which could be due to activation-induced cell death as previously reported in vaccinia infection (Quigley et al., 2008) .

These results suggest that CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells are sensitized to IL-27-mediated STAT1 activation by IFNAR1 deficiency.",

Hierarchical clustering of IL-27SGs by expression revealed distinct groups of genes (Fig. 5 D) . A large cluster of shared targets of IFN-I and IL-27 was attenuated by aIFNAR1 treatment (Fig. 5 D, top cluster) , suggesting these genes are unlikely to mediate the CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell-expanding effects of aIFNAR1. However, a separate cluster of IL-27SGs comprising genes with unattenuated or increased expression following aIFNAR1 treatment emerged (Fig. 5 D, middle cluster) . Notably, this cluster featured Serpina3g and Bcl3, important prosurvival factors of memory CD8 + T cells (Mitchell et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2004) , and Irf1, which regulates clonal expansion of CD8 + T cells during viral infection (Brien et al., 2011) . IL-27R is required for the expression of Serpina3g and Irf1 in aIFNAR1-treated mice, because IL-27R-deficient mice showed significantly reduced expression in both the single-dose and continuous treatment experiments (Fig. 5 B) . In addition, the transcription factor Irf8, previously shown to regulate proliferation of CD8 + T cells, was induced by IL-27 in CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells and significantly reduced in Il27ra \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 5 B) . Taken together, these results suggest that IL-27 might be required for the expression of prosurvival and cell cycle-controlling genes in CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells under IFNAR-attenuated conditions.",

Consistently, T cell-intrinsic IL-27 signaling is required for the expression of negative regulatory molecules on tumorinfiltrating CD8 + T cells in a mouse melanoma model (Chihara et al., 2018) , IL-27 was dispensable for memory CD8 + expansion following Listeria and vaccinia virus vaccinations (Pennock et al., 2014) , and virus-specific memory CD8 + T cells seem to eventually lose IL-27 responsiveness (Perona-Wright et al., 2012) . However, IL-27 also elicits powerful antitumor effects directly dependent on CD8 + T cells (Hisada et al., 2004; Salcedo et al., 2004 Salcedo et al., , 2009 Liu et al., 2013) , drives CD8 + T cell proliferation and IFN\u03b3 production (Mayer et al., 2008; Schneider et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2013) , and augments memory CD8 + expansion following subunit vaccination (Pennock et al., 2014) . Here, we showed that IL-27 promotes CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell expansion. Treatment of LCMV-infected mice with recombinant IL-27 was sufficient to drive an increase in frequency and number of virusspecific CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells. IL-27 and IL-27R were also required for the expansion of CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells induced by IFNAR blockade. Our observations of IL-27-driven CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell expansion in a persistent infection further support the stimulatory function of IL-27. Which factors dictate whether IL-27 elicits suppressive or activating effects on CD8 + T cells is unknown; one possibility is that IL-27 up-regulates prosurvival factors in CD8 + T cells under limited inflammation, such as during subunit vaccination, with localized tumors, or in a persistent phase of viral infection. If these genes can be induced redundantly by other cytokines, the suppressive effects of IL-27 might dominate.",

In CD4 + T cells, IL-27 can induce Tcf7 (encoding TCF1) expression, suggesting that IL-27 might promote CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell differentiation by sustaining TCF1 levels.

IFN-I, acting in concert with TCR activation (termed \"in-sequence\"), acts as a costimulatory cytokine and enhances effector function through STAT4; however out-of-sequence action (where IFN-I signal precedes TCR stimulation) has potent antiproliferative and apoptotic effects mediated by STAT1 (Platanias, 2005; Crouse et al., 2015) . Both IFN-I and IL-27 enhance effector CD8 + T cell generation and function and induce the expression of T-bet (Hibbert et al., 2003; Morishima et al., 2005 Morishima et al., , 2010 Mayer et al., 2008; Schneider et al., 2011) . However, whereas IFN-I favors short-lived effector cell formation, IL-27 also supports memory precursor-like effector cell formation (Liu et al., 2013) . Moreover, whereas STAT1 activation by IFN-I has antiproliferative effects in CD8 + T cells, IL-27 activation of STAT1 is not known to inhibit proliferation in this cell type. On the contrary, IL-27 simultaneously increased STAT1 protein levels, STAT1 phosphorylation, and proliferation in human CD8 + T cells (Schneider et al., 2011) . According to our competitive cell transfer studies, IFN-I couples cell division to loss of TCF1, particularly in rapidly dividing cells. In contrast, IL-27 allowed fast-dividing TCF1 + cells to sustain proliferation and avoid cell death, thereby uncoupling rapid division from TCF1 loss. IL-27 induced prosurvival genes Serpina3g, encoding cathepsin B inhibitor Spi2A, which is required for the maintenance of central memory CD8 + T cells (Liu et al., 2004; Byrne et al., 2012) , and Bcl3, another inhibitor of cell death in activated CD8 + T cells (Mitchell et al., 2001; Valenzuela et al., 2005) . Given the increased cell death in IL-27R-deficient P14 cells compared with WT P14 cells in mice treated with anti-IFNAR, it is likely that IL-27-dependent induction of prosurvival genes prevents attrition of TCF1 hi cells undergoing division.",

Consistently, IL-27 induced STAT1 phosphorylation more strongly in anti-IFNAR-versus isotype-treated mice, and IL-27 achieved a stronger fold induction of target genes in Ifnar1 \u2212/\u2212 compared with WT CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells. Moreover, deletion of STAT2, which acts downstream of IFN-I but not IL-27, led to increased frequency and number of virus-specific CXCR5 + TIM3 \u2212 CD8 + T cells. STAT2 is also required for the antiproliferative effect of IFN-I on IL-2-induced thymocyte proliferation (Gimeno et al., 2005) , suggesting type 1 interferon's antiproliferative effect on TCF1 + CD8 + T cells could be mediated by the STAT1-STAT2-IRF9 complex, whereas IL-27's protective effect is mediated by STAT1 homodimers. These results, along with the requirement of STAT1 for CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell expansion following anti-IFNAR treatment, suggest that the relative magnitude of IFN-I and IL-27 signaling on TCF1 hi cells influences CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell expansion via differential control of STAT1 and STAT2.",

            "text": "IL-27 was also required for IRF1 expression, a transcription factor we found to be essential in a cell-autonomous manner for the expansion of CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells following IFNAR blockade. IRF1 is a known regulator of CD8 + T cell differentiation and was recently shown to signal downstream of IL-27 in inducing type 1 regulatory CD4 + T cells in a STAT1-dependent manner (Brien et al., 2011; Karwacz et al., 2017) . Irf1 is also an ISG, but IL-27 induced Irf1 more strongly than IFN-I, and Ifnar1 deletion further increased the magnitude of its induction by IL-27. We observed that IL-27 endows rapidly dividing CD8 + T cells with high IRF1 levels. IL-27R-deficient virus-specific (P14) CD8 + T cells underwent rapid division shortly after infection but were unable to sustain this, gradually being outcompeted by WT cells. In competitive transfer experiments, IRF1-deficient P14 cells showed highly similar kinetics to Il27ra \u2212/\u2212 P14 cells and exhibited reduced frequency of CXCR5 + cells compared with WT P14 cells in the same host. This suggests that IL-27R supports CXCR5 + CD8 + T cell expansion in part by inducing sustained IRF1 expression. Irf1 \u2212/\u2212 P14 cells retain some ability to expand following anti-IFNAR treatment, suggesting that other IL-27 target genes play a role, possibly by decreasing the rate of cell death in proliferating Irf1 \u2212/\u2212 CXCR5 + P14 cells.",

For example, CXCR5 + CD8 + T cells are essential for the proliferative burst of CD8 + T cells following anti-PD1 treatment (Im et al., 2016) . Anti-PD1, which belongs to the class of checkpoint inhibitors, has become standard of care in the treatment of certain cancers. IL-27 has shown beneficial effects on antitumor CD8 + T cell responses (Murugaiyan and Saha, 2013) . It would be interesting to test whether IL-27 can enhance the ability of anti-PD1 treatment to drive the proliferation of CD8 + T cells in cancer patients.",

(B) WT mice were subjected to lethal irradiation (2\u00d7 450 rad) followed by transplantation of an equal mixture of bone marrows from CD45.1 + IL27R-WT mice and CD45.2 + IL27R-deficient mice. 2 mo later, mice were treated with IgG1 isotype control or aIFNAR1 antibody 1 d before infection with Cl13. Shown are percentages and total numbers of splenic CXCR5 + TIM3 \u2212 follicular cytotoxic T cells derived from CD45.1 WT and CD45.2 + IL27R-deficient bone marrow in mice treated with isotype control or aIFNAR1 antibody as described above. (C-E) WT CD90.1 + and Il27ra \u2212/\u2212 CD90.1 + CD90.2 + P14 cells were labeled with CTV and adoptively transferred to WT CD90.2 + recipients that were treated with aIFNAR1 or isotype. The mice were infected with Cl13 the next day, and splenic P14 was analyzed at day 2 (C), day 3 (D), or days 2-6 (E) after infection.
