            "text": "Background: Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infections often manifest severe respiratory symptoms, particularly in patients with a past history of allergic disease. Most of these findings were reported during the 2009 pandemic. The purpose of this study was to detail the clinical characteristics of influenza virus-induced lower respiratory infection (LRI) during the A(H1N1)pdm09-predominant 2015e2016 season. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical characteristics of influenza-induced LRI cases in children admitted to a tertiary children's hospital. Molecular diagnostic evaluation was performed on samples obtained from the most severe cases. Results: We identified 66 patients with influenza-associated hospitalization and included 21 patients with influenza virus-induced LRI for analyses. Twelve patients (57%) were admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit, seven (33%) required mechanical ventilation, and three (14%) required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Plastic bronchitis (PB) was identified in six patients (29%), among whom a past medical history of asthma or food allergy were noted in all six patients. A past history of allergic disease was more common among patients with, than among those without, PB (p \u00bc 0.009). A(H1N1)pdm09 was detected from all the PB cases, and phylogenetic analyses of the hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes demonstrated that this virus belonged to subclades 6B.1 and 6B.2. In the six PB cases, we found one patient with H275Y mutation in neuraminidase. Conclusion: Allergic disease was a risk factor for developing PB due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 infection during the 2015e16 season.",

Severe respiratory failure associated with plastic bronchitis (PB), a condition characterized by rigid branching mucus casts that obstruct the airway, was also reported in 2009 season [3e5] . Chronic lung disease, immunosuppressive status, cardiac disease, pregnancy, diabetes mellitus, obesity in adults, and asthmatic status in children were identified as risk factors for developing severe respiratory failure due to H1N1pdm09 infection during the 2009 season [6, 7] .",

National surveillance in Japan during the 2015e2016 season reported that H1N1pdm09 accounted for 86% of cases of influenza A virus infection [9] . Although the clinical features of pediatric patients with H1N1pdm09 in the 2009 season have been documented, clinical information regarding H1N1pdm09 infections in other seasons is relatively scarce. In general, we hypothesize that influenza pandemics tend to be more severe than seasonal outbreaks due to the lack of host immunity. However, risk factors for developing severe complications during a pandemic might differ from those in seasonal outbreaks due to differences in host immunity or genetic changes in the circulating strain. These questions require further research to be answered.",

Total nucleic acids were extracted from specimens, which were additionally taken from endotracheal tube aspirates, from all patients who had PB using the QIAamp DNA Mini kit (QIAGEN) and analyzed by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) using the Fast-track Diagnostics respiratory pathogens 21 (FTDRP21) multiplex assay kit (Fast-track Diagnostics, Luxembourg).

Genome sequencing for the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) genes was performed using specific primers (Supplemental table: Table S1 ).

Table 1 shows the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients at the time of admission. Males predominated (n \u00bc 15, 71%), and the median age was 7 years. Nine (42%) patients had a history of asthma and all patients with a neurologic disease (n \u00bc 4, 19%) had cerebral palsy, two of whom had had a tracheostomy. Only four (19%) patients received the influenza vaccine during this season. Patients who were admitted to the intensive care unit, required mechanical ventilation, and required ECMO comprised 57%, 33%, and 14% of the study pool, respectively. Six patients received the diagnosis of PB and required mechanical ventilation, while among these three also required ECMO for pulmonary support. Table 2 shows the details of these cases. Major underlying conditions in the cases with PB were asthma (n \u00bc 5, 83%) and food allergy (n \u00bc 3, 50%). Among the patients with asthma, two had moderate persistent asthma and were using inhaled corticosteroid as a controller, and three patients had intermittent asthma which did not require a controller. The median of white blood cell count on admission was 15790/ml (range 9730/mle19050/ml), which were neutrophil predominant (median: 91%, range: 72%e96%) with eosinophils accounting for less than 2% (median: 0.6%, range 0.1%e1.9%).",

The high affinity of H1N1pdm09 to the lower respiratory tract has been reported in animal models and suggests the existence of specific virulence factors accountable for host-pathogen interactions [21] . The phylogenetic analysis of the HA and NA genes from all cases of PB observed in this study showed that these genes belonged to subclades 6B.1 and 6B.2, which were the commonest circulating strains during the 2015-16 season [9] . We also performed full genome sequencing for two specimens obtained from the patient 2 and 5 who required ECMO, without finding any variations known to be associated with virulence. Although limited, these data suggested that the patients' host factors, rather than a viral factor peculiar to these severe cases, were more important for developing severe respiratory failure. Antiviral drugs may improve the outcome of severe respiratory failure due to influenza. A previous report suggested that a delay in administering antiviral drugs might be associated with increased severity [22] . However, PB in most of our patients progressed rapidly within one day of onset, making early antiviral therapy difficult. The median time from onset of fever to admission was two days, the time-frame within which 76% of the patients were admitted. Therefore, our findings may support the importance of immunization in the prevention of severe influenza. Although our study was not designed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine, previous reports have shown a vaccine efficacy rate of 61%e63% against A(H1N1)pdm09 and prevention of hospitalization in 76% of cases [8, 23] . The rate of immunization was four in 21 (19%) in the admitted patients and one in six (17%) in PB, which was lower than the general immunization rate of 50% in Japan [24] . Thus, our findings support the current recommendations to vaccinate children.",
