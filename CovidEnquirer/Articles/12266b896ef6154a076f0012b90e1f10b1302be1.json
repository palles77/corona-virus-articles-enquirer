            "text": "Background: Human rhinovirus (RV) is the most common respiratory virus and has been associated with frequent and severe acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI). The prevalence of RV species among HIVinfected children in South Africa is unknown. Objectives: To describe the prevalence of respiratory viruses, including RV species, associated with HIV status and other clinical symptoms in children less than two years of age with and without ALRI in Pretoria, South Africa. Study design: Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected from 105 hospitalized ALRI cases and 53 non-ALRI controls less than two years of age. HIV status was determined. Common respiratory viruses were identified by PCR, and RV species and genotypes were identified by semi-nested PCR, sequencing and phylogenetic tree analyses. Results: Respiratory viruses were more common among ALRI cases than controls (83.8% vs. 69.2%; p = 0.041). RV was the most commonly identified virus in cases with pneumonia (45.6%) or bronchiolitis (52.1%), regardless of HIV status, as well as in controls (39.6%). RV-A was identified in 26.7% of cases and 15.1% of controls while RV-C was identified in 21.0% of cases and 18.9% of controls. HIV-infected children were more likely to be diagnosed with pneumonia than bronchiolitis (p < 0.01). RSV was not identified in any HIV-infected cases (n = 15) compared with 30.6% of HIV-uninfected cases (n = 85, p = 0.013), and was identified more frequently in bronchiolitis than in pneumonia cases (43.8% vs. 12.3%; p < 0.01). Conclusions: RV-A and RV-C are endemic in South African children and HIV infection may be protective against RSV and bronchiolitis.",

However, advanced diagnostics are largely limited to the developed world and studies investigating a comprehensive range of pathogens are lacking in African countries. The majority of respiratory viral aetiological studies in Africa have utilized traditional cell culture and serological methods, and data for viruses other than respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are scarce. Studies of ALRI in African children published as recently as 2013 did not screen for common respiratory viruses such as human rhinovirus (RV), coronavirus and bocavirus [3] . http RV is the most common virus identified in children with respiratory infections worldwide and is responsible for upper and lower respiratory tract infections including pneumonia and bronchiolitis. The identification of a third RV species, RV-C, first reported in 2006 [4, 5] has led to several investigations of its prevalence, conducted predominantly in developed countries. The majority of these studies in hospitalized children found that RV-C was the most prevalent RV species and was often associated with wheezing, asthma and ALRI [4, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Only three studies have investigated the prevalence of RV species in African children [13] [14] [15] , one of which was in South African children with acute wheezing illness. Our first hypothesis was that RV, and more specifically RV-C, is the most common and severe cause of ALRI in young South African children.",

Genotypes were assigned based on comparisons of the 5 non-coding region sequences with those of 101 classical serotypes as well as 52 newly identified genotypes using ClustalX software (Conway Institute, University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland).

Cases and controls were recruited equally throughout the four seasons (p = 0.223). Comparing viral identification between the four seasons, overall among the cases and controls, we observed significant seasonality patterns for RSV, coronavirus, influenza and metapneumovirus. RSV was identified more often in autumn (43.2%) and winter (48.6%) than in spring (8.1%) and summer (0%, p < 0.001), coronavirus was identified more often in winter (57.9%) and spring (36.8%) than in autumn (5.3%) and summer (0%, p = 0.035), influenza was identified most in spring (80%, p = 0.012) and metapneumovirus was identified more often in autumn (50.0%) and winter (40.0%) than in spring (10.0%) and summer (0%, p = 0.050). RV was equally prevalent throughout the seasons. In cases alone, the observed seasonality patterns were significant for RSV (p < 0.01) and influenza (p < 0.01). No seasonality patterns were observed for controls alone.",

RV-A and RV-C were of similar prevalence, challenging our hypothesis that RV-C is the most common cause of ALRI in South African children. In the only other study of RV species in South African children, RV-C was the most prevalent [13] . However, Smuts et al. investigated young children with acute wheezing illness rather than ALRI. Only two studies investigated the prevalence of RV species in children with ALRI in Africa with one reporting RV-A as the most common species in children with ALRI [15] and the other finding no difference in the prevalence between RV-A and RV-C between ALRI cases and controls or between ALRI severity groups [14] . Further investigations including different ALRI clinical groups may help ascertain the role of RV species in ALRI. This is the first study to describe the prevalence of RV species among HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected young South African children with ALRI. Contrary to our hypothesis, respiratory viruses were not more common in HIV-infected children than in HIVuninfected children. Surprisingly, RSV was more common in HIV-uninfected children than in HIV-infected children. Consistent with our findings, a recent study from South Africa also found that RSV and metapneumovirus were identified less frequently in HIV-infected children than in HIV-uninfected children [26] . However, Moyes et al. found that HIV-infected children in South Africa had a higher risk of hospitalization with RSV-associated ALRI than HIV-uninfected children [27] . In another South African study, HIVinfected children had a higher prevalence of KI polyomaviruses and coronavirus-OC43 and a lower prevalence of human bocavirus and WU polyomaviruses than in HIV-uninfected children [18] . There are limited viral data on HIV-infected children with ALRI [24, 28] and further studies including a larger HIV-infected cohort are needed.",

Since we cannot differentiate asymptomatic from symptomatic infection, a virus-positive NPA suggests, but does not prove causation.
