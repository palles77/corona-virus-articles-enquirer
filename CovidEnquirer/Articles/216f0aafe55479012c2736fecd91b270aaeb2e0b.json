The immunogenic epitopes G5-24 from the rabies virus (RV) glycoprotein, and 5B19 from murine hepatitis virus (MHV) S-glycoprotein were successfully displayed on the surface of TMV, and viruses accumulated to high levels in infected leaves of Nicotiana tabacum Xanthinn. The peptide RB19, which contains an arginine residue plus the 5B19 epitope fused to the CP (TMV-RB19), resulted in the induction of necrotic local lesions on inoculated leaves of N. tabacum Xanthi-nn and cell death of infected BY2 protoplasts. RNA dot blot assays con\u00aermed that expression of the acidic and basic pathogenesis-related PR2 genes were induced in infected Xanthi-nn leaf tissue. TMV that carried epitope 31D from the RV nucleoprotein did not accumulate in inoculated tobacco leaves. Analysis of hybrid CPs predicted that the isoelectric points (pI):charge value was 5.31: \u00c0 2 for wild-type CP, 5.64: \u00c0 1 for CP-RB19, and 9.14: 2 for CP-31D. When acidic amino acids were inserted in CP-RB19 and CP-31D to bring their pI:charge to near that of wild-type CP, the resulting viruses TMV-RB19E and TMV-4D:31D infected N. tabacum Xanthi-nn plants and BY2 protoplasts without causing cell death. These data show the importance of the pI of the epitope and its effects on the hybrid CP pI:charge value for successful epitope display as well as the lack of tolerance to positively charged epitopes on the surface of TMV.",

Plant viruses are of special interest as carriers of immunogenic peptides and for use as potential vaccines, in part because they are not infectious in humans and other animals. Compared to most animal viruses, the structure of most plant viruses is very simple, and are often formed with a single coat protein (CP) type. Most plant viruses are not enveloped, and many accumulate to very high levels in their host. For these reasons, viruses such as tobacco mosaic tobamovirus (TMV), cowpea mosaic comovirus (CPMV) and johnsongrass mosaic potyvirus (JGMV) have been investigated for their potential use as epitope presenters with different degrees of success (Haynes et al., 1986; Hamamoto et al., 1993; Usha et al., 1993; Jagadish et al., 1993; Fitchen et al., 1995; Sugiyama et al., 1995; Turpen et al., 1995; Beachy et al., 1996; Lomonossoff & Johnson, 1996) .",

We investigated whether or not the PR2 genes are activated in BY2 protoplasts and in N. tabacum Xanthinn and Xanthi-NN plants following infection by w.t. TMV or TMV mutants. RNA dot blot analyses were performed using total RNA puri\u00aeed from protoplasts (at 24 and 36 h.p.i.), Xanthi-nn (4 d.p.i.), and Xanthi-NN (4 d.p.i.) plants inoculated with TMV-RB19, TMV-RB19E or w.t. TMV-U1. 32 Plabeled DNA molecules speci\u00aec to acidic or to basic PR2 gene were used as probes. There was little or no induction of acidic or basic PR2 mRNA in BY2 protoplasts infected with w.t. TMV or with hybrid viruses (data not shown). In contrast, TMV-RB19 induced accumulation of acidic and basic PR2 gene expression in inoculated leaves of N. tabacum Xanthi-nn and Xanthi-NN ( Figure 6 ). In Xanthi-NN plants inoculated with TMV-RB19, basic PR2 gene expression was about two times greater than that on TMV inoculated Xanthi-NN plants, whereas the accumulation of acidic PR2 mRNA was about the same in both plants ( Figure 6 ). On inoculated leaves (IL) of N. tabacum Xanthi-nn plants, high levels of mRNAs of acidic and basic PR2 gene expression was observed after inoculation with TMV-RB19, but not by w.t. TMV or TMV-RB19E ( Figure 6 and data not shown). Basic PR2 gene expression was induced in inoculated leaves, but not in non-inoculated upper leaves (SL; Figure 6 (a)). However, basic PR2 mRNA levels in Xanthi-nn inoculated with TMV-RB19 was about 20 times higher than in Xanthi-nn leaves inoculated with w.t. TMV, and about three to \u00aeve times higher than in Xanthi-NN leaves inoculated with TMV or TMV-RB19 (Figure 6(a) ). In contrast, the accumulation of acidic PR2 mRNA in Xanthi-nn inoculated with TMV-RB19 was similar to that observed on Xanthi-NN inoculated with TMV or TMV-RB19 (Figure 6(b) ). These studies demonstrate that the hypersensitive response on Xanthi-nn plants resulting from TMV-RB19 infection triggered the expression of the acidic and basic PR2 genes. ",

CP molecules have presumably evolved a variety of functions (e.g. ef\u00aecient assembly), and in some cases, play an important role in virus movement and/or replication (Matthews, 1991) . Mutations in viral CP can cause loss of certain CP functions (Bendahmane et al., 1997) .

The 23 amino acid residues of peptide G5-24 from the RV glycoprotein, and the ten amino acid residue peptide containing the 5B19 epitope from MHV spike protein, were successfully exposed on the surface of TMV. The respective viruses, TMV-G5.24 and TMV-5B19, systemically infected N. tabacum Xanthi-nn. However, insertion of the peptide 31D from the RV nucleoprotein in TMV CP (TMV-31D) reduced the infectivity of the hybrid virus TMV-31D in plants. In BY2 protoplasts TMV-31D replicated and CP-31D accumulated to high levels (Figure 3(b) ). The results indicate that the lack of virus accumulation in infected plant leaves may result from interference with local movement. This important \u00aending remains unexplained, since it has been shown that local cell to cell spread of TMV does not require CP. A possible explanation for these results is that leaf cells that are infected are killed before local spread can occur.",

Infection by this virus produced necrotic lesions on N. tabacum Xanthi-NN similar to those produced by w.t. TMV. However, in contrast to w.t. TMV, TMV-RB19 induced a hypersensitive response (HR) on the systemic host N. tabacum Xanthi-nn. In this case the addition of a single Comparison of the hybrid CPs that did not cause necrosis on Xanthi-nn plants with those that did, led us to propose that the overall charge of the CP is important in inducing necrosis. The peptides that, when inserted in the CP, resulted in a pI equal to or lower than the w.t. CP (e.g. G5-24, 5B19, and 5B19L; Figure 1 (a); Table 1 ), were successfully displayed on TMV particles, and the chimeric viruses caused systemic infections. In contrast, peptides that resulted in a pI of the CP that is higher than that of w.t. CP resulted in the induction of HR (Table 1) . Altering the pI:charge value in hybrid CP to bring it near to that of w.t. CP, 5.31: \u00c0 2 (by inserting Asp to Glu residues before or after the peptide) eliminated the necrotic reaction and resulted in local and systemic infection (Table 1) . These results con\u00aermed the importance of pI:charge value of the hybrid protein, and show that highly positively charged peptides can in\u00afuence the interaction of TMV with the host. In contrast, negatively charged epitopes are more tolerated than are positively charged epitopes (e.g. G5-24 and 5B19L peptides; Table 1 ). These principles were recently applied to successfully generate new hybrid TMV constructs that express the MG3 epitope from the lymphocyte choriomeningitis virus ( TMV induces local necrotic lesions on N. tabacum Xanthi-NN as a result of the N resistance gene (Whitham et al., 1994) and an uncharacterized interaction with TMV replicase (Padgett & Beachy, 1993; Padgett et al., 1997; Abbink et al., 1998) . Although N. tabacum Xanthi-nn lacks the N gene, the hybrid virus TMV-RB19 induced HR on these plants. The mechanism of induction of HR by TMV-RB19 on Xanthi-nn plants is not known. However, the signal transduction pathway that results in HR on Xanthi-NN and Xanthi-nn may, at least in a part, be different. This is supported by the observation that TMV-RB19 induces cell death in infected BY2 protoplasts whereas w.t. TMV does not. Furthermore, protoplasts derived from Xanthi-NN plants do not die when infected with TMV (Otsuki et al., 1972) . It is known that infection by TMV induces the expression of the basic PR2 gene in the inoculated leaves and the expression of the acidic PR2 gene both locally and systemically in Xanthi-NN (Brederode et al., 1991; Heitz et al., 1994) , but not in Xanthi-nn plants that lack the N gene (Linthorst, 1991) . In contrast to Xanthi-nn plants inoculated with w.t. TMV, Xanthi-nn plants that produce necrotic lesions following inoculation with TMV-RB19 resulted in the expression of the basic and the acidic PR2 genes. These results indicate that the HR observed in the Xanthi-nn plants inoculated with TMV-RB19 may share a portion of the HR signal transduction pathway with the HR in Xanthi-NN.",

Accumulation of (a) basic and (b) acidic PR2 mRNA in N. tabacum Xanthi-nn and Xanthi-NN plants following inoculation with TMV-U1 or TMV-RB19 at 4 d.p.i. RNA dot blots were performed using similar amounts of total RNA and then hybridized with sequences to detect (a) basic or (b) acidic PR2 gene expression. The signal intensity of the isotope label was measured using phosphoimager followed by Multi-Analyst computer program analyses (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), and the relative values are displayed as graphs. may reside in the fact that TMV-RB19 and TMV-5B19 assemble to form virus particles which are very insoluble in plant cells. Indeed, electron microscopy experiments showed that virus particles were recovered from membrane-rich fractions rather than from a soluble supernatant fraction. This may indicate that insertion of the RB19 or 5B19 peptides at the C terminus of TMV CP creates a domain on the surface of assembled viruses that interacts with and destabilizes cellular membranes, thus causing BY2 cell death. Porta et al. (1994) studied the expression of an epitope from foot-andmouth disease virus (FMDV) on the surface of CPMV and found an unusual af\u00aenity of the hybrid CPMV-FMDV with cellular membranes. Porta et al. (1994) proposed a direct involvement of three amino acid residues (Arg-Gly-Asp) of the FMDV epitope in af\u00aenity with the membrane. The predicted hydrophobicity of the CP-5B19 and CP-RB19 compared to w.t. CP suggests that both proteins may create hydrophobic domains at the C terminus of the hybrid CP that is not present in w.t. CP. This domain may interact with and anchor the CP and/or the virus with cell membranes.",

Total RNA was puri\u00aeed from N. tabacum Xanthi-nn and Xanthi-NN plants four days post-inoculation with TMV-RB19 or TMV-U1. Leaf discs (1 cm in diameter) containing necrotic lesions were collected and total RNA was puri\u00aeed as follows. Leaf discs were homogenized in the extraction buffer (0.2 M Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.1 M LiCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1 % (w/v) SDS). The homogenate was extracted with phenol/ chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and RNA were then precipitated in the presence of 3 M LiCl. The pelletted RNA was resuspended in H 2 O and then precipitated in the presence of 2.5 volumes of ethanol. RNA dot blots were performed by applying similar amounts of total RNA onto a nylon membrane; blotted RNAs were hybridized with sequences to detect acidic or basic PR2 genes expression using speci\u00aec PR2 DNA sequences as described by Karrer et al. (1998) . After stringent washes the intensity of the radioactive label was measured using a phosphoimager followed by Multi-Analyst computer program analyses according to the manufacturers recommendations (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).",

Proteins were extracted from infected leaves or from puri-\u00aeed virus, separated by SDS-PAGE, and stained with Coomassie blue or electroblotted to nitrocellulose membrane and reacted with anti-5B19 or anti-TMV antibodies. Samples are from plants inoculated with TMV-5B19 (sample 2), TMV-RB19E (sample 3), TMV-U1 (sample 4) or from healthy plant (sample 1). Mw, protein molecular mass in kDa. (b) Immunogold labeling of TMV-RB19E and TMV-U1 (negative control) using monoclonal antibody raised against the 5B19 peptide. Electron microscopy was performed on Phillips CM100 electron microscope at magni\u00aecation of 39,000 \u00c2 .
