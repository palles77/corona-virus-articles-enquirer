However, for many other diseases, correlations of efficacy are less obvious or yet to be agreed. By definition of perceived need, we are most acutely aware of the requirement of effective vaccines against infectious agents, pathogens ancient, re-emergent and new, yet the opportunities for manipulation of immune responses offer potential in the prevention and treatment of a far larger diversity of diseases. From these, immunomodulation in cancer, allergy and autoimmune disease are also considered here.",

In the case of TB, recent literature has correlated the production of interleukin 4 (IL-4) and IL-4\u03b42 (a splice variant of IL-4 and an IL-4 antagonist) with the propensity of a latently infected host to succumb to active tuberculosis. The production of IL-4\u03b42 is correlated with the control of the disease [11] . Focus on the type of immune response needed to engender protection against TB seems to be orientated (convincingly) towards suppression of IL-4 and the long standing dogma advocating the importance of Th1 type cytokines (such as interferon gamma, IFN-\u03b3) in TB resistance [12, 13] .",

Opinion is divided as to what type of immune response is required in the control of HIV. Neutralizing antibodies might be efficient in blocking virus particles but poorly effective against cellassociated virus, whereas some cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are effective against virally infected cells but not against free virus particles. Latent infection facilitates immune evasion and the rate of mutation inherent in HIV also facilitates evasion (by escape from responding T cells [14] ). Promising vaccine strategies will likely depend upon highly conserved epitopes and upon vaccine strategies that induce potent immune responses capable of driving cytotoxicity and producing broadly effective neutralizing antibodies [15] .",

The understanding of the pathogenesis of allergic and autoimmune diseases has led to several proposed associations and causes for these diseases. It has been shown that highaffinity T cells can out-compete lower-affinity T cells during responses to antigen in vivo [16] . Competition between T cells provides the basis for the argument that maintaining a balanced peripheral immune system might also be a side effect of normal competition for shared resources within an intact immune system [17] , a mechanism proposed to be responsible for the increased occurrence of these diseases, where hypersensitivity is normally passively controlled by expansion of immune cells specific for prevalent infectious agents. Autoimmunity can have strong associations with exposure to crossreactive proteins, and genes encoding major histocompatibility complex (MHC) are strongly associated with some autoimmune diseases, but this is markedly less so for allergy. Allergy and autoimmunity are thought to differ by virtue of their regulation through central and peripheral tolerance. Genetic predisposition and environmental exposure are believed to play key roles in the development of asthma and atopy [18] , with the significant increase in the incidence of these disorders thought to provide evidence for the involvement of various environmental factors, especially in developed countries [19] .",

The identification of potentially useful antigens is greatly facilitated by improved molecular biology techniques, such as microarray technology (discussed further below), but the elucidation of their full potential might rely on the development of effective delivery systems and adjuvants. Many adjuvants are based on microbial components but others, traditionally aluminium salts and more recently emulsions and surfactant based formulations, exploit different mechanisms of action. Particulate delivery can be mediated by polymer [often poli(lactideco-glycolide)] microparticles, immunostimulatory complexes, liposomes and virosomes [31] . Possible advantages of particulate delivery are that antigen and coadjuvant can be delivered to the same cell and particulates have excellent potential for targeting cells of the immune system [32] .

The development of cell-culture technology that could replace the egg-based manufacturing process might facilitate faster production of much-higher antigen yields [4] . Live vaccines generally possess a natural adjuvant capability that is built on the evolved ability of our immune system to recognize many facets of potentially dangerous microbes and they have contributed immeasurably to the control of disease. Although some live vaccines might have undesirable characteristics, such as the mutation of polio virus and persistence of viruses such as varicella zoster virus, their use has been, and indeed remains, able to significantly reduce the impact of associated diseases [35, 36] . Viruses and bacteria as carriers of heterologous antigens and genes have received considerable attention over previous decades, and generation of auxotrophic mutants, as well as the use of other replication incompetent vectors and of reassortant viruses generated by the addition of RNA segments to viruses with segmented genomes, such as influenza and rotavirus, indicates the potential inherent in these efficient types of vaccine. In an interesting utilization of viral replication, a self-replicating RNA vector encoding a model antigen (\u03b2-gal), which was shown to protect mice against subsequent tumour challenge with colon carcinoma cells engineered to express \u03b2-gal, was also shown to effectively induce apoptosis in transduced cells [37] . The observed apoptosis also facilitated enhanced uptake by dendritic cells and was likely mediated by the presence of double-stranded RNA in replication of the virally derived genome. Double-stranded RNA is recognized by Toll-like receptor (TLR) binding. Different TLRs recognize different surface and intracellular components of microorganisms. The interaction between a TLR and a microbial component triggers the activation of the innate immune system and www.drugdiscoverytoday.com the initiation of acquired immunity [38] . The elucidation of these pathways sheds light on mechanisms of adjuvant action and provides a basis for the inclusion of such potent agents and their analogues in vaccine design.",

For example, the level of protection required in a population (herd immunity) will be different and this could allow theoretical flexibility in vaccine efficacy.The application of molecular biology techniques can be crucial in the identification of new candidate antigens and subsequent determination of vaccine efficacy using adjuvants can feed knowledge back to correlates of protection in terms of immunological markers.This knowledge can then be used in choice of appropriate adjuvants and formulation.The key implication projected by this schematic is that for the greatest challenges in vaccine development the cyclical generation of knowledge provides a strong role for rational design. * Can be protective or therapeutic. ** Including reverse vaccinology and associated technologies.",

The proposed opportunities for vaccines against HIV and TB are summarized in Figure 3 ; the rationale for elicitation of successfully neutralizing antibodies against HIV is centred upon increasing the immunogenicity of poorly immunogenic peptides, modification and/or removal of hypervariable regions and mimicking viral conformational changes. One of the hottest areas of interest regarding new vaccine development surrounds the Phase III efficacy trials and prospective licensure of two vaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV) [47] . The vaccines, one from Merck and one from GSK, are effectively vaccines against cervical cancer; the (now) unequivocal link between this common virus, which rarely causes serious disease in itself, and cervical cancer found credence as long ago as the 1970s. The production of both vaccines (the Merck vaccine produced in yeast administered with an aluminium adjuvant and the GSK vaccine in baculovirus with the adjuvant AS04; aluminium and bacterial lipid already approved for use in Europe) has its basis in work that elucidated the production and self-assembly of virus-like particles of the HPV outer L1 and L2 coat proteins [48, 49] in various cell types.",

However, group B meningococcus has represented a particular challenge because of the sequence variation of surface proteins and crossreactivity of the capsular polysaccharide Proposed opportunities for vaccination against TB and HIV. In both cases, the utilization of adjuvants capable of driving the required type of immune response can be used.This can be based on our current understanding of TLR interaction, and studies that manipulate this understanding might also serve to elucidate complex interactions during infection and disease. (a) According to recent models, antigen specific CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, \u03b3\u03b4 T cells and CD1 restricted T cells, all participate in protection against M. tuberculosis infection in response to antigen presentation by macrophages (M\u03a6) and dendritic cells (DC), probably also involving crosspriming, where mycobacterial antigens are transferred from infected M\u03a6 to DC. It is unlikely that the induction of IFN-\u03b3 or the production of inducible nitric oxide synthase alone is enough to control TB infection, and evidence indicates that there might be another role for CD4+ T cells.The development of pre-and post-exposure vaccines will likely require antigens expressed by M. tuberculosis under pre-and post-exposure conditions, respectively. Interestingly, nonpolymorphic CD1 restricted T cells are thought to have evolved as a result of prolonged interaction with mycobacteria, indicating the extent of the impact of mycobacteria on its mammalian host. (b) For vaccines against HIV, it seems increasingly likely that strategies will depend upon highly conserved epitopes and on vaccine strategies that induce potent immune responses capable of driving cytotoxicity, as well as broadly reactive, highly effective neutralizing antibodies.Target antigens might very probably be different for each of these strategies.

In this case, reverse vaccinology was convincingly applied to overcome these problems by alternative means [51] . Screening of DNA fragments, discarding likely cytoplasmic protein sequences and known Neisseria antigens, extensive cloning and expression of identified candidate genes allowed selection of antigens that were found not only to offer significant potential for protection against group B meningococcus but also to facilitate crossprotection against heterologous strains. Also worth mentioning is the technique of molecular breeding or gene shuffling, where reassembled chimeric genes are created from a selection of homologous gene sequences. The related sequences are denatured, annealed and subsequently extended in what is in effect a self-priming polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that takes advantage of crossovers, deletions, insertions, inversions and point mutations, as occurs in natural evolution (hence the term 'molecular breeding'). Proteins and genes with enhanced activity are then selected for inclusion in further rounds of molecular breeding. This has a proven application for the generation of enzymes with markedly enhanced activity [52] and the enhancement of the functions of a diverse range of proteins, such as green fluorescent protein [53] and IFN-\u03b1 [54] . This technique is thought to be superior to other methods that employ random mutagenesis, such as error-prone PCR (hence the phrase 'the rational basis for irrational design' [55] ), but the screening of candidate antigen genes is necessarily expensive in terms of resources and time if it is compared for example to the screening of an enzyme. Their potential has been noted with relevance to allergy vaccines [56] , as pre-existing immunity is the therapeutic target and screening of allergen variants might be somewhat more practicable.",

The ability of infectious agents to induce rapid, innate immune responses to molecular patterns provides the basis for adjuvant immunotherapy of cancers.
