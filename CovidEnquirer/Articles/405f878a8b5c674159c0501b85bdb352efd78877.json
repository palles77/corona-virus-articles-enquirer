Although amylase and lipase are poor predictors of pancreatitis in cats, a trypsin-like immunoreactivity assay has now been validated (Texas A & M University, College Station, TX). It can be used to support the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis (increased) or exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (decreased) in cats (see Chapter 36). If a cat with suspected pancreatitis has abdominal effusion, measure lipase concentrations in the serum and effusion; if pancreatitis is present, effusion lipase is usually greater than serum lipase. 8.

A cotton swab is gently introduced 3-4 em through the anus into the terminal rectum, directed to the wall of the rectum, and gently rotated several times. Placing a drop of 0.9% NaCI on the cotton swab facilitates passage through the anus but does not adversely affect cell morphology. The cotton swab is rolled on a microscope slide gently multiple times to give areas with varying thickness; three slides are usually made. After air drying, one of the slides can be stained with Diff-Quick or Wright's-Giemsa stains. The slide should be examined for white blood cells and bacteria morphologically consistent with Campylobacter jejuni or Clostridium perfringens. Histoplasma capsulatum or Prototheca spp. may be observed in the cytoplasm of mononuclear cells. Methylene blue in acetate buffer (pH =3.6) stains trophozoites of the enteric protozoans. Iodine stains and acid methyl green also are used for the demonstration of protozoans. Acid-fast or monoclonal antibody staining (Meridian Diagnostics, Cincinnati, OH) of a fecal smear should be performed in cats with diarrhea to aid in the diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis. Cryptosporidium parvum is the only enteric pathogen of approximately 4-6 f.IIIl in diameter that stains pink to red with acid-fast stain.

Sugar centrifugation can be used for routine parasite evaluation and may be superior to many techniques for the demonstration of oocysts of Toxoplasma gondii and C. parvum.
