Attention to the concerns of the community and local interests is a major theme that carries forward in the system of biosafety oversight today. This key element has served to preserve public trust in the safety of the life sciences research enterprise. In retrospect, the risks of recombinant DNA technology that were feared early in its evolution did not materialize. That fact notwithstanding, the development of a scientifically based oversight system with the IBCs as the centerpiece permitted the safe development of recombinant DNA as an essential technology in research. Over the years, oversight by IBCs has proven critically important to ensuring safety throughout various research fields -medical, occupational, environmental -as well as in promoting responsible scientific practice. Due to the dynamic nature of the life sciences there remains an ongoing need to assess biosafety dimensions of the research being conducted and to manage any risks associated with work. As life sciences research continues to advance, many lines of research, particularly involving highly pathogenic organisms, continue to generate public concern. Financial support for life sciences research comes primarily from publicly derived tax dollars, and so the life sciences community must demonstrate to the public that it is being a responsible steward of those funds. IBCs today remain critically important in preserving public trust and thus facilitating continued scientific progress. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the institutions it funds must continue to ensure that IBCs are equipped to fulfill their responsibilities so that biosafety risks are responsibly managed and public safety and trust are preserved.",

With the advent of recombinant DNA techniques in the early 1970s, a debate arose in the scientific community regarding the potential health and environmental risks of genetically manipulated organisms. The public also became involved in this debate. The concern about the dangers of emerging recombinant DNA technologies led to the scientific community calling for an unprecedented voluntary moratorium on certain experiments with recombinant DNA until the risks could be further characterized and procedures developed to minimize those risks. Scientists called for the formation of a national oversight body to ensure public discussion and ongoing oversight of this emerging technology [3] . One of the outcomes of this process was the formation of the National Institutes of Health Recombinant In the mid-1970s, recombinant DNA was a nascent and poorly understood technology, but was emerging as an important tool for conducting biomedical research. The public was apprehensive about this novel technology, related to the potential impact on the environment and public health, as well as a host of ethical and social issues due to its capacity to modify the molecular centerpiece of life. The debate over safety captured congressional attention, resulting in over a dozen legislative proposals that would have statutorily imposed a number of restrictions on the development and use of this technology [4] . A number of local jurisdictions were also considering similar ordinances that would have precluded the use of recombinant DNA altogether. Most notable among these was the city of Cambridge, Massachusetts, that in 1977 became the first jurisdiction in the United States to directly regulate basic scientific research using recombinant DNA [5] . The Cambridge Recombinant DNA Technology Ordinance also established strict oversight of university and commercial laboratories that engaged in recombinant DNA research. The requirements set forth in that city ordinance were based on the NIH Guidelines and the Cambridge Biosafety Committee carried out enforcement. The Committee, staffed by the Cambridge Public Health Department, is comprised of Cambridge residents and still operates to this day.",

Unlike the statutes being contemplated, the NIH Guidelines were intended to be a \"living\" document detailing required biosafety practices for institutions and investigators to follow, consonant with current scientific understanding. By design the NIH Guidelines is a dynamic document that maintains its relevance by evolving along with science and technology and it has undergone multiple revisions since 1976. In 1978, almost immediately after the completion of the first iteration of the NIH Guidelines, the then-Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (now the Department of Health and Human Services) held a national conference to take a fresh look at the state of our understanding of risks posed by recombinant DNA technology. Up to that time, the RAC had reviewed every single recombinant DNA protocol that was conducted. NIH decided that RAC review of all protocols, as well as other restrictions on the field of research outlined in the first iteration of the NIH Guidelines, were no longer necessary. Instead, the transparency provisions of the oversight system and public access to the institutional review processes were enhanced, substituting for the diminished role of the RAC in protocol reviews. Toward that end, several revisions were made to the NIH Guidelines including significantly increased public access to information about recombinant DNA research activities and public participation in the administration of the NIH Guidelines in local communities. The NIH Guidelines originally required that no less than 20% of the IBC would be comprised of members who had no affiliation with the institution and were in a position to represent community interests. The changes to the NIH Guidelines eliminated the \"no less than 20%\" clause and instead, required there be at least two IBC members who had no affiliation with the institution and were in a position to represent community interests. Furthermore, important records of the IBC, including minutes, memoranda of understanding and agreement, registration documents, and other materials submitted to the Federal government had to be made available to the public upon request.",

Among these were a coalition of religious leaders who asked then President Reagan's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Biomedical and Behavioral Research -a group set up to look at the ethics of human subjects research -to undertake the special topic of genetic engineering with humans [7] . The result of that analysis was the report \"Splicing Life: The Social and Ethical Issues of Genetic Engineering with Human Beings (1982) .\" This report was conveyed to the RAC for its consideration, which led the RAC to recommend a number of changes to the NIH Guidelines that went into effect in April 1984. These included giving IBCs the formal mandate to review and approve human gene transfer (HGT) research. Subsequently in 1986, a document titled \"Points to Consider in the Design and Submission of Gene Therapy Trials to the NIH\" was developed by the RAC, and incorporated into the NIH Guidelines as Appendix M. It outlined for IBCs the kinds of matters they were expected to evaluate when reviewing proposals for the administration of recombinant DNA to human subjects in clinical trials at a time of substantial advances in HGT, coincident with the first gene transfer trial being approved by the NIH Director in 1989.",

The NIH, in consultation with the Federal ex-officio members of the RAC, determined that it would make more sense to consolidate all of the requirements concerning the containment of recombinant DNA into the NIH Guidelines. Consequently, the USDA guidelines were incorporated into the NIH Guidelines as Appendices P (for plants) and Q (for animals).

The NIH director at the time called for a thorough analysis of the investment that NIH was making in the field of HGT research, and the optimal mechanisms for NIH oversight of the field. This was accomplished through the efforts of two committees: The Orkin-Motulsky Committee looked at the question of NIH's investment in the field and concluded that, while the field still had great promise, progress was hampered by gaps in scientific knowledge, and the Committee urged the NIH to fund proportionately more basic research to build a stronger scientific foundation that would inform clinical science [8] ; the Verma Committee looked at optimizing the value of the RAC and concluded that it was not necessary for the RAC to publicly review every protocol submitted to the NIH, nor was it necessary for NIH to approve every protocol. IBCs and other bodies such as the Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had approval authority, and the RAC process could be of optimal value as a means of informing the deliberations of these other groups. Consequently, they recommended that the RAC only review in public those protocols that raise special or novel scientific, safety, or ethical issues [9] . The recommendations of the Verma Committee were embodied in the October 1997 revisions to the NIH Guidelines and eliminated the need for the NIH to approve each HGT trial.",

At the time, it was likely that most research with synthetic nucleic acids also involved the use of recombinant techniques and thus was already covered by the NIH Guidelines. However, this change was designed to be forward-looking, recognizing that new technologies can rapidly expand. The amendment to the NIH Guidelines also made it clear that the focus of biosafety review for new genetic constructs should focus on the product, not the technique used to produce it.

[11] presented the results of a 2010 survey conducted to examine trends in IBC practices. The authors compared their results to similar surveys that they conducted in 2002 and 2007. The results of the 2010 survey showed that IBCs have made significant improvements since 2002 in levels of staffing support, conducing training, and increasing transparency to the public and overall compliance with the NIH Guidelines. A primary reason cited by the authors for the improvement in IBC performance is the NIH site visit program. Of the institutions that responded to the survey, 80% stated that they believed the NIH site visit enhanced the institutions' oversight of recombinant and synthetic nucleic acid molecule research. The results of the survey also showed that institutions that have undergone site visits were better poised to effectively carry out their responsibilities under the NIH Guidelines than institutions that have not had a site visit. This can be attributed to the awareness-raising nature of the NIH site visit program. For example, the survey found that 85% of institutions that had a site visit have reported an incident involving a significant problem, violation of the NIH Guidelines, or a significant research-related accident or illness to NIH, while only 25% of the non-site-visited institutions had reported such incidents as required by the NIH Guidelines. Similarly, 70% of respondents who had received a site visit have PI training in place, whereas only 44% of institutions that have not had a site visit have similar training. The NIH has noted that incident reporting compliance increases after a site visit because the importance of incident reporting is strongly emphasized during the site visits.",

First, it was quickly realized that NIH would not be able to perform a site visit to all of the registered IBCs (~890 in 2014). The Self-Assessment Tool was created to encourage institutions to assess their own programs using the same performance indicators as NIH does during a visit.

The tool poses a question, lists the citation of the NIH Guidelines that is pertinent and then provides NIH's guidance on how the requirement should be addressed by the institution.

A review was then carried out as part of NIH's ongoing evaluation of its oversight framework for gene transfer and recombinant DNA research. In 2013, the NIH Director commissioned the Institute of Medicine (IOM) to establish an independent committee to specifically look at the question of whether HGT research raises issues of concern that warrant extra oversight by the RAC in the form of the review of individual clinical protocols and, that if such oversight was warranted, to recommend criteria to guide when the RAC should review this research.",

            "text": "In September 2014, the USG issued a Policy for Institutional Oversight of Life Sciences Dual Use Research of Concern [19] . The policy requires research institutions to establish a process for identifying dual use research of concern and articulates and formalizes the roles and responsibilities of institutions and investigators when they are conducting research supported by the Federal government that falls under the scope of the policy, with the aim of preserving the benefits of life sciences research while minimizing the risk that the knowledge, information, products or technologies generated by such research could be used in a manner that results in harm. Institutions subject to the policy are required to establish and implement internal policies and practices that provide for the identification and effective oversight of dual use research of concern. A key responsibility is the establishment of an Institutional Review Entity (IRE) to execute the requirements of the policy. While the policy states that \"a range of mechanisms for fulfilling the role of an IRE are acceptable as long as the review entity is appropriately constituted and authorized by the institution to conduct the dual use review,\" it is likely, that in many instances, institutions will choose to utilize their IBCs to perform the functions of the IRE. The NIH and the other Federal government agencies that conduct or support life sciences research, have developed a number of resources to assist IREs in their review of research that is potentially dual use research of concern.",

Today, our understanding of recombinant DNA technology and its attendant risks is far greater, and although many of the initial fears about the technology have turned out to be unfounded, there remains the need to be vigilant over many aspects of the research enterprise. Capabilities in the life sciences have advanced rapidly in the past four decades and our capacity to manipulate organisms is likely to continue to advance at a similar, if not accelerating, pace for the foreseeable future.",

The public continues to be pointedly concerned about many aspects of life sciences research, especially in the context of human studies and research involving infectious agents. While the public continues to support biomedical research, its trust in the endeavor may be fragile. The IBCs have been central to a transparent demonstration of the ability of the scientific community to serve as responsible stewards of publicly funded research, and in helping to earn and preserve the trust placed in it.",
