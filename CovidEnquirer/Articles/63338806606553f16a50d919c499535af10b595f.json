We enrolled children aged 1-19 years with radiographically proven bronchiectasis unrelated to cystic fibrosis. At the start of an exacerbation, children were randomly assigned to oral suspensions of either amoxicillin-clavulanate (22\u00b75 mg/kg, twice daily) and placebo or azithromycin (5 mg/kg per day) and placebo for 21 days. We used permuted block randomisation (stratified by age, site, and cause) with concealed allocation. The primary outcome was resolution of exacerbation (defined as a return to baseline) by 21 days in the per-protocol population, with a non-inferiority margin of -20%. We assessed several secondary outcomes including duration of exacerbation, time to next exacerbation, laboratory, respiratory, and quality-of-life measurements, and microbiology.

            "text": "Although exacerbations are triggered often by viral infections, 4 antibiotics are commonly used. [8] [9] [10] Treatment is guided ideally by lower airway microbiology but such data are often unavailable in children unable to provide sputum for culture. Thus, empirical antibiotics are frequently necessary. The Australian and New Zealand guidelines for bronchiectasis recommend amoxicillinclavulanate as the first-line empirical oral antibiotic therapy for non-severe exacerbations in children. 11 European guidelines do not name the antibiotics but refer to a paper that recommends amoxicillinclavulanate. 10, 12 Amoxicillin-clavulanate is active against Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Moraxella catarrhalis, the three bacterial pathogens detected most often in high densities in the lower airways of children with bronchiectasis. 13 However, amoxicillinclavulanate requires multiple dosing per day and can cause gastro intestinal symptoms. Oral azithromycin is attractive as an alternative first-line therapy because of its long half-life, which means it can be taken less frequently, and is well-tolerated by children. In disadvantaged communities, twice-daily dosing of antibiotics such as amoxicillin-clavulanate is not always feasible, and might result in children with exacerbations receiving suboptimal treat ment, risking continuing symptoms and antibiotic resistance. Three randomised controlled trials 14 did not show that azithromycin was superior to amoxicillinclavulanate for treating paediatric community-acquired pneumonia. However, azithromycin is still used in some settings as first-line treatment of acute exacerbations in children with underlying bronchiectasis. 15 We therefore tested whether daily oral azithromycin was non-inferior to oral amoxicillin-clavulanate for resolving exacerbations by 21 days of treatment. We also assessed the effect of the interventions on exacerbation duration, time-to-next respiratory exacerbation, lung function, quality of life, systemic inflammation, antibiotic resistance, and treatment-related adverse effects, and describe the point prevalence and diversity of respiratory viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydiales spp during exacerbations.",

The resolution percentage was informed by a pilot study of 15 children treated with oral amoxicillin-clavulanate for a non-severe exacerbation in which 12 (80%) children had their symptoms resolved by day 21.

By contrast, the median time to next exacerbations was similar in both groups (table 2, appendix p 6). The likelihood of having an exacerbation during follow-up was similar between groups: in the per-protocol, the hazard ratio was 0\u00b78 (95% CI 0\u00b75-1\u00b72; p=0\u00b73) and in the intention-to-treat group it was 0\u00b78 (95% CI 0\u00b76-1\u00b72; p=0\u00b75). Similarly, we detected no significant differences between groups for changes in inflammatory biomarkers, FEV 1 % predicted, or parent cough-specific quality-of-life scores (table 3) .",

There were no signifi cant differences between groups for the outcomes of the time to next exacerbation, inflammatory markers, FEV 1 % predicted or quality-of-life scores, but azithro mycin resistance in bacterial pathogens was more common in the azithromycin group. Gastro intestinal problems, including nausea and diarrhoea, were the most common drug-related adverse events with no significant difference between the two antibiotics. Although adherence was 10 percentage points better in the amoxicillin-clavulanate group, this difference was not statistically significant. Although both antibiotics were generally well tolerated, nine children in each treatment group withdrew from the trial because of vomiting. Almost half the children had respiratory viruses detected at the beginning of an exacerbation, while atypical pathogens were rare. The 20% non-inferiority margin is relatively wide, but without placebo-controlled trials of amoxicillin-clavulanate or azithromycin to guide the treatment of bronchiectasis exacerbations in children, the non-inferiority margin was based on respiratory physicians' expert opinion for a clinically acceptable loss of efficacy compensated for by azithro mycin's more favourable dosing profile.",

In the past two decades, bronchiectasis has been recognised increasingly as a relatively common, but often underdiagnosed and under-researched chronic disease. 1 Because the lower airway microbial profiles in children with bronchiectasis differ from adults with this disorder and from children with cystic fibrosis, 22 having data from children with bronchiectasis is important. This trial is also the first to compare amoxicillin-clavulanate with azithromycin using a non-inferior hypothesis that was determined a priori. Amoxicillin-clavulanate was used as the reference treatment because in Australia and New Zealand it is the recommended first-line anti biotic for outpatient manage ment of children with bronchiec tasis when lower airway specimens are unavail able. 11 Similarly, the latest European adult guidelines 12 refer to an earlier publication listing amoxicillin-clavulanate as the first option for acute exacerbations in adults with bronchiectasis, but without P aeruginosa infection; however, the guidelines do not explicitly recommend amoxicillin-clavulanate in this setting. Although antibiotics underpin the treatment of bronchiectasis exacerbations, 12 the optimum duration of treatment and dosing regimen is unknown. European guidelines recommend 14 days of therapy, but stated that the level of evidence was very low and based on intravenous rather than oral antibiotics. Although 2 weeks is the standard in routine clinical practice, we chose 3 weeks of antibiotics in this trial on the basis of our prior data. In our prospective cohort study 23 of 69 children followed up for 900 child-months, 36 (23%) of 158 exacerbations were treated with intravenous antibiotics following persistence of symptoms-ie, the exacerbation had not resolved. Generally, patients were admitted to hospital 3-5 weeks following the initiation of oral antibiotics and resolution occurred within the next 2 weeks. In addition, from our pilot work involving 15 children, based on validated diary cards, 18 we found that six (40%) were cough free by day 7, nine (60%) by day 14, and 12 (80%) by day 21 and day 28.",

The review showed that clinical failure, microbial eradication, and adverse events measured after 10-14 days were not significantly different between treatment groups. However, most studies were of uncertain methodological quality. A subgroup analysis of adults with acute bronchitis showed that clinical failure was significantly lower in the azithromycin group. 14 Nevertheless, none of these studies included patients with bronchiectasis or used a pre-defined non-inferiority hypothesis, which limits the validity of their overall conclusion. 20 By contrast, an investigator-blind ran domised controlled trial 24 of 730 children with acute otitis media (with tympanocentesis to identify bacterial pathogens), reported that amoxicillin-clavulanate was significantly more efficacious than azithromycin at producing clinical cures (90\u00b75% vs 80\u00b79%, p<0\u00b7001).

This finding is consistent with earlier studies and presumably reflects common usage of macrolides in these patients and in the community. 15 Unlike other respiratory pathogens, azithromycin-resistant S aureus strains might persist following cessation of the antibiotic, 26 and is of concern, especially in settings where meticillin-resistant S aureus is already prevalent. 15, 26 Indigenous children who, as in this study, are over-represented among patients with bronchiectasis, 27 also have high rates of local and invasive infections with S aureus, including meticillin-resistant S aureus. 28 Increasing macrolide-resistance could therefore complicate the treatment of extra pulmonary infections in these high-risk populations.",

            "text": "Notwithstanding the novelty of our study, it has several limitations. There were unequal numbers of patients in the two treatment groups, probably as a result of block randomisation and site-specific stratification based on age and cause, leading to 16 concurrent randomisation lists. Nevertheless, the groups were evenly matched. Second, the optimum antibiotic doses for treating bronchiectasis exacerbations are unknown. The commonly used dose for the 7:1 formulation of amoxicillin-clavulanate available in Australia and New Zealand of 45 mg/kg per day is efficacious for treating children with protracted bacterial bronchitis; 29 hence, the pragmatic dosing chosen for the study. However, 80 mg/kg per day of amoxicillin is recommended for treating childhood pneumonia in settings of antibiotic resistance. 30 Similarly, without studies comparing different doses of azithromycin to treat lower respiratory tract infections or bronchiectasis exacerbations, we used the commonly recommended 5 mg/kg per day regimen, which corresponded with total weekly dosing of 30-35 mg/kg used successfully in a trial 17 of long-term azithromycin to reduce exacerbation frequency in children with bronchiectasis. Third, the time to next exacerbation was based on parental recall of symptoms. Although some exacerbations might not have been recorded, there is no reason to believe that this would have been unevenly distributed between treatment groups. Fourth, only children not requiring hospital admission for an exacerbation were randomly assigned, which could explain such favourable resolution rates (77%). However, enrolling children deemed unwell enough to need intravenous antibiotics to an oral antibiotic trial is ethically unacceptable. Last, because most children are unable to expectorate, deep nasal swabs were collected as described previously. 17 Although such specimens reflect poorly the lower airway microbiology, knowing nasopharyngeal carriage is more important from a community perspective because this is the principal reservoir for spreading antibiotic-resistant bacteria. 25 In conclusion, when treating children with a non-severe exacerbation of their bronchiectasis, we found that oral azithromycin was non-inferior within a 20% margin to oral amoxicillin-clavulanate. The compromise when using azithromycin instead of amoxicillin-clavulanate is that the exacerbation may last as much as 4 days longer, and the potential risks of inducing macrolide resistance should also be considered. Azithromycin should therefore be regarded only as an alternative treatment for bronchiectasis exacerbations in children with penicillin hypersensitivity or if there is a high-risk of poor adherence with multiple daily dosing and directly observed therapy is possible. Further randomised controlled trials in other populations of patients with bronchiectasis are needed to validate the results of the present study. Until these data are available, amoxicillin-clavulanate remains the empirical first-line therapy of choice for treating nonsevere exacerbations of bronchiectasis in children.",
