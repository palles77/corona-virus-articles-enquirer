Moreover, knowledge of the incubation period helps to assess the effectiveness of entry screening and contact tracing. The distribution of the incubation period is also used in estimating the size of the epidemic [3 -5] and the transmission potential [6, 7] . In absence of data on the 2019-nCoV incubation period, the WHO has worked with a broad range of 0 to 14 days, the CDC has taken a range of 2 to 14 days, and several studies have assumed incubation periods of SARS or MERS coronaviruses.",

We fitted three parametric forms for the incubation period distribution to these ranges: the Weibull distribution, the gamma distribution, and the lognormal distribution. We used a Bayesian approach to fitting, that allows for the use of prior knowledge to inform the analysis. We specified strictly positive flat prior probability distributions for the parameter values of the three distributions (supplementary material S2), which ensured our estimates are conservative. Because of the high number of observations, the impact of the priors on the outcome was negligible. We used a uniform prior probability distribution over the exposure interval for the moment of infection for each case. We sampled from the posterior distribution using the rstan package [9] in R [10] (supplementary material S3). Figure 1 shows the time line for each case, where the cases without a maximum incubation period lack an unexposed (gray) period. However, the estimated infection times for these cases are close to the end of the exposure window, informed by the cases that do have a maximum incubation period.",
