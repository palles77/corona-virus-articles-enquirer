[8] The most representative PPE item for preventing droplet and airborne transmission is the respirator. The American Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines recommend extended use and limited reuse of N95 filtering facepiece respirators that are certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). [9, 10] N95 respirators are intended to block the invasion of particles such as pathogens or droplets with diameters between 0.02 and 0.2 mm and filter over 95% of the fine particles without resistance to oil particles. [9] In European medical environments, the FFP3 filter respirator certified in accordance with the European type respiratory protection standard EN 149 is recommended. [11] Unfortunately, healthcare providers can still be exposed to infectious agents while wearing certified N95 respirators. The protection performance of N95 respirators is dependent on the filter's performance and sealability, which is determined by the shape of the sealing surface, the pressure generated by the respirator, the breathing flow rate, and the wearer's movements. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Face seal leakage is the main component of respirator leakage. [11, 13] Thus, N95 respirators need to be evaluated to confirm sufficiently tight sealability in order to prevent infection transmission. Moreover, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) (29 CFR 1910.134 ) requires an annual respirator fit test to confirm the fit of any respirator that forms a tight seal on the wearer's face before it is used in the workplace. There are qualitative fit tests (QLFTs) and quantitative fit tests (QNFTs) that are approved and recommended by OSHA. [18] The QLFT is based on the wearer's senses of taste and smell using isoamyl acetate, saccharin, Bitrex (denatonium benzoate), or irritant smoke. The QNFT measures the fit factor by numerical value using the fit test equipment and eight movements performed for 1 minute each: normal breathing, deep breathing, moving head side to side, moving head up and down, bending over, talking, and normal breathing again. [19] In addition to the fit test, there have been many efforts to improve the protection performance of the N95 respirator in the medical environment. Many invasive techniques, such as endotracheal intubation or chest compressions, increase the risk of infection by creating droplets. Kang et al [20] demonstrated that using a video laryngoscope rather than a direct laryngoscope in endotracheal intubation may reduce the risk of infection by reducing respirator leakage. Shin et al [21] showed that it is possible to improve the protection performance of N95 respirators when performing chest compressions, which can cause leakage of a respirator, if a respirator is appropriately selected and the wearer is trained to wear a respirator.",

In the preliminary study that was conducted to calculate the number of samples, four participants were assessed for the fit factor before and after the training during the movement of grimacing. The mean and standard deviation of fit factor before training were 43.1 and 73.3, and the mean and standard deviation of fit factor after training were 86.5 and 75.4. Using Gpower 3.1.9.2 (Heine Heinrich University, Dusseldorf, Germany), the calculated effect size was 0.58, the alpha error was 0.05, and the power was 0.8. The calculated number of samples was 21, and thus, 23 participants were enrolled considering a 10% dropout rate.",

            "text": "Healthcare providers working in the EMC are at the forefront of exposure to infection. An N95 or higher filter respirator is recommended to be worn to prevent droplet or airborne transmission. [9] However, the protection performance of the respirator could be poor due to leakage between the face and respirator. This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of training wearing an N95 or higher filter respirator on healthcare providers in the EMC. Many training methods for protective performance have been developed. There are four different types of training media: (1) printed training books, (2) noninteractive videos, (3) computerbased training, or (4) direct interactive training. [27] Additionally, there are several ways in which participants can obtain feedback: (1) direct feedback by educator, (2) fit check (self-check), and (3) real-time quantitative test using the PortaCount Plus. Eckerman and Lundeen demonstrated the superiority of direct interactive training for teaching occupational safety and health information in working adults. [29] Therefore, we selected direct interactive training as the training method and real-time feedback by educator and fit check. Respirator use is a multistep process including correctly donning the gear, making adjustments for a secure facial seal, confirming the fit, and properly removing the respirator. In this simulation study, educators took note of the above procedures and provided detailed and practical training to each participant on each procedure and gave feedback. For each of the procedures, we were especially careful about putting the straps in place because this mistake was often made during the procedures. [27] As shown in Tables 2 and 4 , this simulation study revealed that training healthcare providers in the EMC could significantly improve the fit factor and adequate protection rate of the three types of respirators. The clinical experience of all participants in this study was more than three years, and they had been trained to wear respirators and had experience wearing respirators. Nevertheless, proper protection performance of the respirator could not be expected before training and was improved after training. As seen in Table 4 , particularly adequate protection showed 100% of normal breathing after training regardless of respirator type. The training on respirators for healthcare providers in the EMC helped to improve protection performance. Considering that the training time was less than 30 min and that the training consists of feedback by the educator and a fit check Table 2 Comparison of fit factors determined by the quantitative fit test before and after fitting training for the three types of respirators. by the participants, the improvement effect of training on the protection performance of the respirator can be judged to be large without other equipment and long training times. The protection performance of respirators was improved after training, but it is also important to choose the right respirator because the respirator with the highest protective performance was still the highest after training. Therefore, the choice of a proper respirator is important. [8] The fit factor and adequate protection rate were the lowest during grimacing regardless of the type of respirator (Table 4 ). In the grimacing movement, the fit factor before training was 10 (5-31) for cup-type, 24 (8-84) for fold-type, and 9 (5-18) for valve-type (Table 2) , and the adequate protection rate before training was 0% (0-2) for cup-type, 5% (0-35) for fold-type, and 0% (0-0) for valve-type (Table 4 ). During the grimacing movement, the fit factor after training was 50 (17-127) for cup-type, 157 (37-200) for fold-type, and 40 (20-99) for valvetype (Table 2) , and the adequate protection rate after training was 18% (0-92) for cup-type, 81% (9-100) for fold-type, and 0% (0-43) for valve-type ( Table 4 ). As we can see, it was difficult to say that adequate protection was achieved. Grimacing movement disturbs the adhesion between the face and the filter respirator and causes leakage. Even if one wears an N95 respirator, he/she should avoid movements that disturb adhesion, such as grimacing movements, where the risk of transmission exists.",

            "text": "After all the simulations were completed, participants were asked which respirator they would like to wear in the clinical situation of outbreak of infectious disease. Of the participants, 10 (45.5%) preferred the valve-type, 9 (40.9%) preferred the foldtype, and 3 (13.6%) preferred the cup-type respirator. The cuptype respirator is made of a hard material, so the pressure on the face produced by the strap and the respirator is felt to be greater than that of other types of respirators, resulting in discomfort and decreased preference. In one study, cup-type respirators were proved to produce greater pressure at the same fit factor than fold-type respirators. [30] Valve-type respirators were preferred because they allowed the wearer to feel more comfortable due to the valve, which reduced breathing resistance. [30, 31] In cases of outbreaks of new infectious diseases or biological terror attacks, N95 or higher filter respirators should be worn for a long time. In one study, wearing a respirator for a long time did not create clinical physiological burdens. However, wearers showed subjective discomfort and symptoms. [32] If the respirator causes discomfort, compliance with wearing respirators could be reduced. Therefore, wearing comfortable and preferred respirators is important. [33, 34] The better the adhesion of the respirator, the more the pressure on the face and the discomfort increases. Decreased pressure between the respirator and face can be comfortable but leaky. [30, 32] A fold-type respirator can be preferred to cup-type when it is necessary to wear the respirator for a long time, since a cup-type respirator creates increased pressure at the same fit factor compared with a fold-type respirator. [30] There are some limitations to this study. First, the three filter respirators are not the same grade and classification. The researchers used three types of filter respirators that were routinely used in Korea during the outbreak of MERS. The cuptype (3M 1860) and fold-type (3M 1870) respirators are NIOSH certified N95 filter respirators, while the valve-type (3M 9332) respirators are FFP3 filter respirators certified in the European standard EN 149. Second, there are hundreds of filter respirators, but only three types of filter respirators were used in this study. Third, participants in this study worked in only one EMC, and only two nurses participated. Because healthcare providers have different training and clinical experience depending on the institute and occupation, conducting simulations including more occupations and institutions is necessary. Fourth, only one method of training was selected. Fifth, this study did not investigate the sustained effect of training. OSHA requires respirator users to be trained and pass the fit test annually.
