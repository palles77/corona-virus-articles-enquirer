Apart from higher pollution emissions due to human activities in densely populated street canyons, stagnated air flow due to closely packed tall buildings means lower dispersion potential. The coupled result leads to frequent reports of high air pollution indexes at street-side stations in Hong Kong. High-density urban morphologies need to be carefully designed to lessen the ill effects of high density urban living. This study addresses the knowledge-gap between planning and design principles and air pollution dispersion potentials in high density cities. The air ventilation assessment for projects in high-density Hong Kong is advanced to include air pollutant dispersion issues. The methods in this study are CFD simulation and parametric study. The SST keu model is adopted after balancing the accuracy and computational cost in the comparative study. Urban-scale parametric studies are conducted to clarify the effects of urban permeability and building geometries on air pollution dispersion, for both the outdoor pedestrian environment and the indoor environment in the roadside buildings. Given the finite land resources in high-density cities and the numerous planning and design restrictions for development projects, the effectiveness of mitigation strategies is evaluated to optimize the benefits. A real urban case study is finally conducted to demonstrate that the suggested design principles from the parametric study are feasible in the practical high density urban design.",

Nonetheless, the roadside concentration of NO 2 continues to increase [4] . Similar findings are also being reported in Europe by EEA [2] . High hourly, daily, and annual average concentrations of NO 2 have been recorded at the road-side stations in the Central, Causeway Bay, and Mong Kok areas in Hong Kong. Air pollution far exceeds the limits recommended by the WHO [4] . The three areas are high-density metropolitan areas and traffic hotspots. As shown in Fig. 1 , vehicles crowd the streets of highdensity urban areas in Hong Kong. The reported higher concentration of NO 2 is the result of the larger NO 2 percentage in total traffic emissions [2, 5] and of poorer urban air ventilation in high-density urban areas [6, 7] . The bulky building blocks, compacted urban volumes and very limited open spaces seriously block the pollutant dispersion in these deep street canyons [8, 9] . Therefore, apart from having control measures to decrease vehicle emissions, understanding pollutant dispersion as related to the urban planning and design mechanism is necessary in order to guide policymakers, planners, and architects in making better evidence-based decisions.",

Therefore, the reciprocal relationship between them requires research on the environmental sensitivity of urban planning and design, in order to positively address their negative consequences on urban air quality. Mirzaei and Haghighat [21] provided a systematic approach to quantify the outside environment in the street canyon. Huang et al. [20] studied an actual urban case of middensity layouts. Hang et al. [8] conducted a study on the effects of varying building heights on street level air pollutant dispersion and Eefents et al. [22] reported the effects of canyon indicators such as Sky View Factor (SVF) on the concentration of NO and NO x . Buccolieri et al. [23] clarified the influence of the building packing density on the pollutant concentration. Richmond-Bryant [24] related the fluid properties and canyon geometries, such as the Reynolds number and canyon height, with air pollutant retention by field measurement data at Manhattan and Oklahoma. However, the direct understandings for design strategies behind a decrease in pollutant concentration through urban morphological mechanisms, particularly for high-density cities, remains little known. Further parametric studies are needed to extend the study findings for practical design applications. Bridging the knowledge gap between high-density urban design and air pollutant dispersion mechanisms in the urban street canyons is necessary to provide guidance for planners, designers and policymakers.",

These insights are helpful to avoid the mistakes that cannot be easily corrected at the late stages of the design practice. The results of this study are intended to facilitate a paradigm shift from the typical experience-based ways of designing and planning to a more scientific, evidence-based process of decision making, which is necessary to cope with the needs of designing high density cities [28] .",

These studies evaluate the effects of future urban developments, based on the current planning trend, on air pollutant dispersion in the street canyons. The knowledge of the efficacy of various mitigation strategies for better air quality at urban areas is provided. Given the finite land resources in high-density cities and the numerous planning and design restrictions for development projects, the evaluation of the effectiveness of mitigation strategies is needed to optimize the benefits.

The Eulerian and the Lagrangian methods are widely used to model air pollutant dispersion [15, 30, 31] . Compared with the Lagrangian method, which considers the species as a discrete phase, the Eulerian method considers species as a continuous phase and is solved based on a control volume, which is similar in form to that for the fluid phase [30, 31] . Therefore, the Eulerian method is more convenient for calculating the air pollutant concentration, which was the index this study used to evaluate air pollutant dispersion. Another reason for choosing the Eulerian method was that it has lower computational demands than the Lagrangian method, which needs to track more than several million particles in the large computational domain for outdoor environment simulation. The Eulerian method has been validated by researchers comparing the simulated data with wind tunnel experiment results [15, 30] .",

However, all RANS models overestimated the concentrations at the middle and top lines (X/H \u00bc 0.5 and 1, respectively), particularly at the windward side of the street canyon. Among the models, the SST keu model (the red dash line) performed best in terms of air pollutant modeling at the windward side. The special near-wall region (the shear layer) treatment by the standard keu model [32, 35] was considered helpful for estimating the air pollutant concentration near surface regions. Balancing the computational cost and accuracy, for this study, the SST keu model was selected as the preferred turbulence model to simulate the air pollutant dispersion of the cases in the parametric study.

For example, the results of the parametric study of the wing wall for room ventilation by Givoni [39] were implemented by the Hong Kong government [40] . For results of parametric studies to be relevant, scenarios should resemble the reality [40] . An urban-scale model is therefore used in this study to obtain realistic parametric simulation results.

In Cases 5 and 6, even though wind speed and turbulence intensity largely decreased above the height of the building permeability, the normalized concentration remained at a low level because the building permeability let clean air flow horizontally into the street canyon, diluting and transporting air pollutant out of the street canyon. The building permeability in Case 4 was achieved by building separations that range from the ground level to the top of the building. Therefore, the strategy in Case 4 was better than in other cases. The building porosity in Case 6 provided more building permeability than Case 5, so that the pollutant dispersion in Case 6 was better than Case 5.",

The performances of various modeling methods (LES and RANS) that are provided by ANSYS Fluent were investigated by cross-comparing with wind tunnel experiment results. Although LES is clearly more accurate than the RANS, the accuracy of the RANS model is sufficient to test the effects of planning and design activities on air pollutant concentration. Among the RANS models, the SST ke u model had the best performance because of the special nearwall region treatment using the standard keu model. 2) The simulation results validated that mitigation strategies for the air pollutant dispersion are necessary in the planning and design of high-density urban areas. In current urban conditions, traffic air pollutants are seriously concentrated in the deep street canyon. If current planning and design activities do not change, these conditions will worsen with future urban development.
