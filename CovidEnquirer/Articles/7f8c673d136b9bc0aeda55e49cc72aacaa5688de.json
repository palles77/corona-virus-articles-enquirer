To expedite the advancement of our knowledge we leverage the data about the related coronaviruses that is readily available in public databases, and integrate these data into a single computational pipeline. As a result, we provide a comprehensive structural genomics and interactomics road-maps of 2019-nCoV and use these information to infer the possible functional differences and similarities with the related SARS coronavirus.

Materials) the two proteins had large sequence inserts. In particular, wNsp3 had a novel large (25 -41 res., depending on the alignment method) insert between its two putative functional domains homologous to N-terminal domain and adenosine diphosphate ribose 1\u2033 phosphatase (ADRP) of SARS [53, 54] (Suppl. Materials). Interestingly, the closest matching peptide, apart from the virus itself, was found in C-Jun-amino-terminal kinaseinteracting protein 4 (Seq. id is 46%) of Labrus bergylta, a species of marine ray finned fish. Being significantly more diverse than the other three structural proteins, wS was found to have 4 inserts (4-6 res.) that seemed unique to 2019-nCoV and two additional inserts shared with human SARS proteins (Suppl. Materials). Three recent strains of bat SARS-like coronavirus from 2013, 2015, and 2017 share extremely high   proteome similarity with 2019-nCoV   The unusually low conservation of ORF6, ORF8, and surface proteins between 2019-nCoV and human SARS, bat coronavirus, as well as another bat betacoronavirus BtRf-BetaCoV, prompted us to perform an expanded search for ORF8 homologs using NCBI BLAST's blatp tool against a large non-redundant protein sequences repository (nr) [55] . Our search resulted in three new homologs of ORF8 from three different isolates of bat SARS-like coronavirus: bat-SL-CoVZC45 (GenBank ID: MG772933, collected in 2017), bat-SL-CoVZXC21 (GenBank ID: MG772934, collected in 2015), and RaTG13 (GenBank ID: MN996532, collected in 2013) that shared a striking similarity with wORF8, unseen in other strains before: the sequence identities between each of these three homologs and wORF8 ranged between the 94 and 95%. Further analysis showed that the proteomes of these isolates shared even higher sequence identity with the other proteins of 2019-nCoV: from 88.4% to 100% for 2015 and 2017 isolates, and even higher 97.4%-100% for the 2013 isolate (Supl .

First, similar to other viruses, the 2017 and 2015 isolates did not have the four sequence inserts that were found in wS. Second, neither of the two isolate had the large insert between the tow domain of wNsp3 of wORF1ab described above. On the contrary, the 2013 isolate had both, the four sequence inserts in its surface protein, matching those in wS and the large insert in Nsp3 although the sequence is different from that one in wNsp3. The main difference between 2019-nCoV and 2013 isolate is the lack of Orf10 in the latter: while genomic sequences of both 2015 and 2017 isolates can be translated into a protein product that shares 97.4% of sequence identity (Supl. Table S1 ), because of a single nucleotide deletion in that region one cannot translate a full-length ORF10 in RaTG13: the resulting frameshift causes a premature stop-codon when translating the sequence.",

For two proteins, wN and wNsp3, multiple domains were The structural analysis of the modeled proteins combined with the sequence conservation analysis revealed several findings. First, we found that the mutated residues tend to locate on the protein's surface, supporting the previous observations in other families of RNA viruses that the core residues of viral proteins are more conserved than the surface residues [48, 56, 57] . Furthermore, in a substantial number of proteins, distributions of mutated positions exhibited spatial patterns, with groups of mutations found to form clusters on the protein surfaces (Fig.2) .

The same interaction is also inferred from structural modeling in 2019-nCoV between wS and ACE2, but might be disrupted due to a substantial number of mutations in the receptor binding site of wS while another recent study proposed that the interaction will be preserved [65] . Similar to SARS-CoV [66] , wS protein in 2019-nCoV is expected to interact with type II transmembrane protease (TMPRSS2) [67] and is likely to be involved in inhibition of antibody-mediated neutralization. Thus, wS remains the important target for vaccines and drugs previously evaluated in SARS and MERS while a neutralizing antibody targeting the wS protein could provide passive immunity [68] . In addition, there are 7 interactions from SARS-CoV determined from structural characterization of the protein complexes that are predicted to be either conserved or potentially disrupted in 2019-nCoV (green edges in Fig. 1 ). An important target for vaccines and drugs is the surface (S) protein which has been evaluated in SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV with an idea that a neutralizing antibody targeting wS protein could provide passive immunity for 2019-nCoV [68] .",

Fifth, the information on the evolutionary differences and conservations observed between the protein sequences of 2019-nCoV and the related coronaviruses and extracted from the above protein sequence alignments will mapped onto the structural models of the 2019-nCoV proteins to determine if the protein-and ligand-binding site are functionally conserved.",

First, by making the structural road map and the related findings fully available to the research community, we aim to facilitate the process of structure-guided research, where accurate structural models of proteins and their interaction complexes already exist. Second, by providing a comparative analysis between the new virus and its closest relatives from the perspective of protein-and ligand-binding, we hope to help experimental scientists in their understanding of the molecular mechanisms implicated in the infection by the new coronavirus as well as in the process of vaccine development and antiviral drug discovery. Through integrating the information on structure, function, and evolution in a comparative study of 2019-nCoV and the closely related coronaviruses, one can make several preliminary conclusions. First, the extended peptide sequence newly introduced to wNsp3 between two structurally, and possibly functionally, independent domains of this protein, might act as a long inter-domain linker, thus extending the conformational flexibility of this multi-domain protein. Second, the presence of the four novel inserts and one highly variable region of the surface protein wS and the analysis of this large-scale sequence changes with respect to intra-viral and viral-host interaction leads us to conclude that these inserts might have structural impact on the homo-trimeric form of the protein as well as the impact on the functions carried out by NTD domain.

Next, to create an integrated network, the two individual networks were imported in Cytoscape [79] and merged to form a unified interactome representing both intra-viral and virus-host interactions. Finally, we include our predictions from structural modeling of 2019-nCoV intra-viral and virus-host interactions, surveyed recent literature on predicted 2019-nCoV interactions and annotated them accordingly in the unified interactome. The unified interactome consists of 125 proteins (94 host proteins) and 200 unique interactions. In addition, network analysis is performed to compute a set of topological statistics (degree distribution, clustering coefficient, and other important characteristics) to characterize parameters of the three networks, before which the networks are pruned for duplicate edges. Finally, the 200 putative interactions were annotated based on the extent to which the protein binding sites of the 2019-nCoV proteins were altered, compared to their SARS homologs. Based on the evolutionary conservation analysis of the putative protein binding sites extracted from the modeled complexes, some interactions were annotated as potentially disrupted.Availability: All data generated in this work is freely available to the research community via Korkin Lab web-server (korkinlab.org/wuhan).",
