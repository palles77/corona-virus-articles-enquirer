Methods: A retrospective observational study was conducted, with a sample size of 523 paediatric patients, diagnosed with an URTI during the period of June 2003 to 22 June 2005. The study was conducted at five Primary Health Care Facilities in North Trinidad. Results: The three most frequent URTIs diagnosed were non-specific URTI, common cold, and acute tonsillitis in rank order. Four patterns of prescribing were identified, (1) no drug therapy [1.9%]; (2) antibiotic therapy alone [6.1%]; (3) antibiotic and symptomatic therapy [53.0%]; and (4) symptomatic therapy alone [39.0%]. The, most frequently prescribed antibiotics were penicillins (amoxicillin [46.3%] and amoxicillin/clavulanate [5.3%]) and a macrolide (erythromycin [6.1%]). The three symptomatic agents most frequently prescribed were paracetamol [40.1%]; diphenhydramine [29.1%]; and normal saline nasal drops [14.2%]. In 112 cases with swab analyses done, of these, 98.2% revealed a growth of commensals only, while 1.8% grew pathogenic micro-organisms. Of the cases showing commensal growth only, 84.6%",

The former is free of cost to the client at all levels and for all services. While all pharmaceutical agents are free they are limited in range and the majority are generic brands. This service is managed by the Ministry of Health and funded by the state. Private health care is based upon fee for service, is costly and affordable mainly by high income earners.",

Five public health facilities were randomly selected for this study, four of which had independent routine swab analysis performed by the National Surveillance Unit. A paediatric patient was a subject 12 years or below and an antibiotic was defined as a substance with bactericidal or bacteriostatic effects. The term is often extended however to include synthetic antibacterial agents, not produced by microbes 24 , such as sulfonamides and quinolones, which was adopted in this study. The diagnoses of URTIs for the purposes of this study are: the common cold, acute pharyngitis, acute tonsillitis, sinusitis, acute otitis media, viral URTI, influenza and non-specific URTI. Exclusion criteria were (1) age equal or lower 13, (2) subjects immunocompromised, malnourished or infected by laboratory confirmed resistant strains of pathogens and chronic respiratory tract diseases and (3) a subject without a definite diagnosis of URTI. Data were analysed using Minitab version 14. 25 Data from throat swabs performed under the National Surveillance Programme conducted at four (4) of the health facilities studied were collected and used for analysis. Swabs were taken from children presenting with complaints of an upper respiratory tract infection and were obtained on the same day as the physician's visit and were independent of physician consultation. These swabs were transported in commercially available transport media to the Microbiology department of the Port of Spain General Hospital where they were initially plated on blood agar containing antibiotic strips to detect sensitivity. The common cold and non-specific URTI were also the only two diagnoses made in children over 9 years of age. Disease occurrence and gender were not associated except for otitis media in which 11(79%) of the 14 cases occurred in boys. Four patterns of prescribing were observed, (1) There was a significant association between antibiotic prescribing and therapy for relief of symptoms [p=0.021] so that antibiotic prescription was likely to be given with a prescription for symptom relief. In 112 of the 523 cases studied throat swabs were analysed for culture and sensitivity. In 110 [98.2%] participants growth of commensals only was reported, and only two subjects had pathogenic organisms; one with streptococcus pyogenes and the other with Staphilococcus aureus. In children harbouring commensals, 52.7% were diagnosed with a nonspecific URTI, and 34.8% had the common cold. In the one patient in whom Staphlococcus aureus was isolated, a diagnosis of the common cold was made, the patient received amoxicillin/clavulanate and the sensitivity report indicated resistance to ampicillin. In the patient with Streptococcus pyogenes, the child had non-specific URTI, received amoxicillin, and the sensitivity report indicated resistance to amoxicillin.",

            "text": "The three most frequent URTI's diagnosed in children were non-specific URTI, common cold and acute tonsillitis. The diagnosis of non-specific URTI's may reflect difficulty by physicians in our setting to precisely identify the diagnosis and aetiology. The recognition by physicians that bacterial URTI's are infrequent is in part due to the lack of local evidence that emphasises this feature of URTI's which in turn facilitates the misconceptions regarding antibiotics and URTI's. There were no gender differences in the occurrence of URTI except for acute otitis media in which there were more boys [78.5%] than girls [21.5%] . We find this difficult to explain as did Pukandor et al who reported similar findings. 26 Four patterns of prescribing prevail in community health care in Trinidad: (1) A large percentage [59.1%] of patients was prescribed antibiotics for URTIs contrary to evidence based practice. 1, 13 The factors contributing to this prevailing pattern of prescribing in our setting is a complex process involving both patient and physician factors. Public misconceptions on the effectiveness of, and indications for, antibiotics exist. Patients presenting with an acute febrile illness often believe that infection is the problem and antibiotics is the answer. Thus patient expectations significantly influence prescribing even if the physician judges that antibiotics are not indicated. Lack of continuing medical education among primary care physicians not presently a legal requirement for continuing to practice may also contribute, as more primary care physicians are more likely to initial see these patients than paediatricians. 27 Amoxicillin was the most frequently prescribed antibiotic a finding similarly reported by Britt et al. 28 However, in our setting, the choice of this antibiotic may be influenced by the ease of availability at public health pharmacies where antimicrobials are often available without prescription. 29 In addition, 51% of patients with the common cold received an antibiotic contrary to evidence based guidelines. Even with a mucopurulent rhinitis (thick, opaque, or discoloured nasal discharge) which frequently accompanies the common cold antimicrobial treatment is not indicated unless it persists without improvement for 10 to 14 days. 30 More than 50% of patients with a non-specific URTI received an antibiotic which is not recommended as it does not enhance illness resolution or alter the rates of complications. 7 A large percentage (82.1%) of patients with other URTIs (acute tonsillitis, acute otitis media, viral URTI, influenza, and acute pharyngitis) also received an antibiotic. Almost all patients (23/24) with a diagnosis of acute tonsillitis were prescribed antibiotics. Thus is not unusual as physicians are more concerned with the prevention of rheumatic fever especially as laboratory support is inadequate and treatment of Group A streptococcal infection with antimicrobial therapy should be initiated within 9 days of onset to be effective in the prevention acute rheumatic fever. 31, 32 All patients diagnosed with acute otitis media were treated with antibiotics. While antimicrobials are indicated for treatment of acute otitis media, diagnosis requires documented middle ear effusion and symptoms and signs of acute local or systemic illness. 33 The pressures of large volume clinics and the difficulty to follow up patients may strongly influence physicians to use antimicrobials. Eight of the 14 patients diagnosed with acute otitis media received amoxicillin. Any decision to treat children with acute otitis media with an antibacterial agent, requires that amoxicillin be prescribed because of its safety, low cost, acceptable taste, and narrow microbiologic spectrum. 34, 35 Treating influenza without established secondary bacterial infection with antibiotics has not proven beneficial 36 ,37 yet eight of the nine patients diagnosed with influenza received antibiotics. Only 2 [1.8%] of the 112 children who had swab analyses showed growth of bacterial pathogens supporting the evidence that most URTIs are of viral origin.",

Acute tonsillitis, acute otitis media and acute pharyngitis together accounted for only 8.4% of all children studied and no child had a diagnosis of sinusitis. Looking at the distribution of cases by age nonspecific URTI was the most common diagnosis in patients 0-2 years [225/392, 57.4%] and 3-4 years [42/84, 50%].
