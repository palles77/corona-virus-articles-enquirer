Objective: We hypothesized that early prebiotic or probiotic supplementation would reduce the risk of virus-associated RTIs during the first year of life in a cohort of preterm infants. Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov no. NCT00167700), 94 preterm infants (gestational age, > _32 1 0 and < _36 1 6 weeks; birth weight, >1500 g) treated at Turku University Hospital, Turku, Finland, were allocated to receive oral prebiotics (galactooligosaccharide and polydextrose mixture, 1:1), a probiotic (Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, ATCC 53103), or placebo (microcrystalline cellulose) between days 3 and 60 of life. The primary outcome was the incidence of clinically defined virus-associated RTI episodes confirmed from nasal swabs by using nucleic acid testing. Secondary outcomes were the severity and duration of RTIs. Results: A significantly lower incidence of RTIs was detected in infants receiving prebiotics (rate ratio [RR], 0.24; 95% CI, 0.12-0.49; P < .001) or probiotics (RR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.28-0.90; P 5 .022) compared with those receiving placebo. Also, the incidence of rhinovirus-induced episodes, which comprised 80% of all RTI episodes, was found to be significantly lower in the prebiotic (RR, 0.31; 95% CI, 0.14-0.66; P 5 .003) and probiotic (RR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.24-1.00; P 5 .051) groups compared with the placebo group. No differences emerged among the study groups in rhinovirus RNA load during infections, duration of rhinovirus RNA shedding, duration or severity of rhinovirus infections, or occurrence of rhinovirus RNA in asymptomatic infants. Conclusions: Gut microbiota modification with specific prebiotics and probiotics might offer a novel and cost-effective means to reduce the risk of rhinovirus infections.

The number and severity of respiratory tract infections (RTIs), the most common cause of pathogen-related infant morbidity in developed and developing countries, has been shown in some studies to be reduced by probiotic or prebiotic intervention, although the effects are not well established. 3, 4 Premature infants lack initial maturation signals for their immature immune system, and their stepwise compositional development of the gut microbiota is disturbed. This is due to delayed introduction of enteral feeding, lack of fresh breast milk, frequent antibiotic use, and the neonatal intensive care unit environment. 5 Consequently, these infants have a heightened susceptibility to infections.",

The infants were recruited between the first and third days of life. The inclusion criteria were as follows: gestational age between 32 1 0 and 36 1 6 weeks, birth weight of greater than 1500 g, and absence of any congenital defects preventing enteral nutrition. The standard of care in our unit is to give either maternal or pasteurized donated breast milk to all preterm infants. The study complied with the Declaration of Helsinki, as revised in 2000. Written informed consent was obtained from the parents of the infants, and the study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Hospital District of South-West Finland. The major challenge in this trial was the recruitment of patients. In Finland the use of commercially available probiotic Abbreviations used RR: Rate ratio RSV: Respiratory syncytial virus RTI: Respiratory tract infection products, even among newborns, is highly widespread, and most of the parents recruited did not want to participate in the study because they wanted to give their infant probiotics.",

Categorical variables were analyzed by using the x 2 test and the Fisher exact test for dichotomous variables. Univariate associations between continuous variables were analyzed by using ANOVA or the Kruskall-Wallis test. Negative binomial regression was used to compare the incidence of RTIs or rhinovirus infections among the study groups. The results are given as rate ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs. In addition, this association was studied by using antenatal steroids, delivery method, sex, postnatal antibiotics, and older siblings at home as covariates. Because the same child could have multiple viral episodes, the following analyses were made with repeated-measures methods. Viral copy numbers were compared between the study groups by using nonparametric repeated-measures analysis. Comparisons between groups were made by using generalized estimating equations for the duration and intensity of clinical symptoms. Associations between the area under the curve of viral copy numbers and duration and severity of symptoms were studied by using mixed models.",

Our results support previously published randomized, double-blind prebiotic and/or probiotic trials conducted in healthy term infants during the first year of life, with the incidence of clinical RTIs representing outcome (Table V) , [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] and extend these to an objective characterization of the viral cause. In contrast to earlier studies, this study was conducted in premature infants, and supplementation commenced within the first week of life, which might have increased the protective efficacy against RTIs. Moreover, the effect exerted by prebiotics tended to outweigh that of the probiotic. One putative explanation for this finding might lie in the pre-existence of bifidobacteria-dominated gut microbiota in our breast-fed preterm population, 6 which strengthens the effect of prebiotics in selective stimulation of the growth of beneficial intestinal microorganisms. 2 In this preterm population the protective effect of prebiotics and probiotics achieved against RTIs and rhinovirus infections was shown to extend throughout the 12-month follow-up period.

            "text": "J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL VOLUME 133, NUMBER 2 when the child's immunologic phenotype is consolidated can thus confer clinical benefits beyond the intervention period, as we have previously documented in the risk reduction of eczema at the age of 7 years with a perinatal probiotic intervention. 18 Our observation is in agreement with the programming theory, whereby early-life exposures can carry effects into later life, with this now being extended to microbial contact. 19, 20 In fact, this is in accordance with a previously published clinical study in which early colonizers were shown to have potential to exert their immunologic effects years later. 21 Moreover, prevention of early rhinovirus infections might be of great clinical importance in that early rhinovirus infections have recently been recognized as a major predisposing factor in the development of asthma. 22 The rationale of probiotic use in the prevention of RTIs is based on their ability to reduce pathogen colonization in the respiratory epithelium and to regulate not only mucosal immunity through activation of inflammasomes but also systemic immune responses. 23, 24 The health benefits of probiotic bacteria in viral diseases, previously best demonstrated in gastrointestinal infections, are related to maintenance of epithelial barrier integrity, production of antimicrobial factors, control of the balance between proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, and reinforced production of antigen-specific secretory IgA. 25 Most importantly, probiotics have been shown to regulate the expression of genes related to innate immune-mediated cytokine responses in the intestinal 26 and also the respiratory mucosa, creating an anti-inflammatory milieu and thus modulating beneficially respiratory mucosal antibacterial and antiviral immunity. 27, 28 Recently, in mouse model studies lactobacilli induced changes in expression of interferon-stimulated genes and increases in IFN-g, IL-6, and IL-10 levels, with beneficial modulation of the respiratory mucosal antiviral immunity. 27 These mechanisms are analogous to the shielding effect of breast-feeding against gastrointestinal infections and RTIs, being mediated by passive immune protection by IgA and oligosaccharides and by colonizing bacteria and their growth factors and molecules regulating microbial recognition. 29 Rhinovirus is the most commonly detected respiratory tract virus, with a wide range of clinical presentations. 30, 31 In this study up to 6 rhinovirus infections were recorded in a year in our preterm population, although the overall rate of RTIs was low. There are few putative explanations for this: the majority of the infants (65%) were firstborn, all of them were breastfed, and only 10% were in day care at the age of 12 months. Interestingly, prebiotics and probiotics prevented symptomatic infection but not the occurrence of rhinovirus RNA in asymptomatic infants. In agreement with the findings of Jansen et al, 32 the rhinovirus RNA copy number was found to be lower in asymptomatic infants. There was a significant correlation between rhinovirus RNA load and the duration of clinical symptoms. Although both prebiotic and probiotic supplementation prevented rhinovirus infections, the intervention had no effect on the duration or severity of symptomatic rhinovirus infections. Furthermore, neither of the interventions influenced the duration of viral shedding. A new observation was that the period of rhinovirus RNA shedding was significantly shorter among the asymptomatic infants. We focused here on premature infants being physiologically immunodeficient because of an immature innate immune system. In this study 83% of the infants in the placebo group had at least 1 RTI during the first year of life. Preterm infants have significantly reduced proinflammatory cytokine (IL-1b, IL-6, and TNF-a) responses, and they produce decreased amounts of antiviral IFN-a. 5 The mechanisms involved lie in reduced pattern recognition receptor expression. On the other hand, they tend to mount aberrant responses to antigen challenges with an overexpression of proinflammatory cytokines, which leads to an overwhelming hyperreactive state. In consequence, this can lead to increased susceptibility to viral infections. It is also well established that prematurity is the major risk factor for severe RSV infections, 33,34 and many recent studies have shown that premature infants also have severe rhinovirus infections. 35, 36 There are important limitations to our study. We studied preterm infants, which could question the generalizability of our results to full-term and older infants. Furthermore, a substantial number of premature infants who underwent randomization could not be evaluated for the 12-month study period. Additionally, it must be acknowledged that not all prebiotics and probiotics are the same, and drawing conclusions on the relationship between such interventions and the effects of any other prebiotic supplementation or probiotic species is not possible. On the other hand, our study is the first to report the effect of prebiotics and probiotics on the prevention of defined viral RTIs in a preterm cohort. The results enhance the placebo-controlled evidence noted in several reviews (also the Cochrane review), 3,4,37 especially data for infancy. Our study also provides novel clinical evidence as to rhinovirus RNA shedding and its relation to the clinical picture in symptomatic and asymptomatic infants. Furthermore, given the fact that probiotics are live microorganisms and that both probiotics and prebiotics possess numerous immunologic properties, uncertainty still prevails regarding the long-term safety of their use among preterm infants during the period when the child's immunologic phenotype is consolidated. The absence of adverse effects in this study cohort represents safety documentation for the use of these prebiotics and probiotics in this sensitive infant population.",

RTIs are a major cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide, particularly during the first years of life, with rhinovirus being the main pathogen responsible for this socioeconomic burden. Although strict hygiene measures have been shown to reduce viral transmission and thus diminish the incidence of rhinovirus infections, no definitive preventive measures have thus far been discovered for the effective control of this entity. On the basis of our results, gut microbiota modulation with specific prebiotics, probiotics, or both could offer a cost-effective tool in the fight against RTIs, hopefully also in the developing world.",
