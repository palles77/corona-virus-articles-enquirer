Oral and respiratory tract infections caused by bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae pose a particular threat because of the rise of antibiotic-resistant strains, with vulnerable patient populations at high risk of infection [2, 3] . Seasonal endemic viruses such as influenza are another significant cause of respiratory infection; worldwide, annual influenza epidemics are estimated to result in about 3-5 million cases of severe illness and about 250,000-500,000 deaths [4] . In addition to seasonal endemic viruses, emerging and re-emerging virus outbreaks such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) require close contact for human-tohuman transmission and can spread nosocomially [5, 6] . Unlike the remaining four coronaviruses, which are typically associated with mild, self-limiting respiratory illness, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV cause severe respiratory symptoms and are associated with considerable mortality [7] . There is no vaccination or any specific antiviral treatment available for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Outbreaks can, however, be quickly and effectively controlled with preventive strategies based upon early accurate viral diagnosis, knowledge of the current epidemiological season and effective hygiene practices to decrease the risk of transmission [8] .",

            "text": "Effective hand hygiene minimises transmission of pathogens from contaminated hands of an infected individual through either direct person-to-person contact or indirectly via contamination of surfaces [9, 10] . Respiratory pathogens such as influenza are also transmitted via airborne dispersion of small particle aerosols (B 5 lm) when an infected individual breathes, coughs or sneezes [11] , while respiratory syncytial viruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV can be spread by large droplets propelled through the air and inoculated into the eyes, nose and mouth at close range [12] . Considering these modes of transmission, oral hygiene by gargling, together with hand washing and mask use [13] , may be beneficial to help minimise the risk of both community-and hospitalacquired respiratory infections. Gargling is also deemed to bring about favourable effects through removal of oral/pharyngeal protease that helps viral replication [14] . Effectiveness of the antiseptic agent in killing pathogens is paramount in selecting gargles/mouthwashes for protective hygiene and can be achieved by ensuring that antiseptic agents pass a standard bactericidal or virucidal activity test. A rapid action is also desirable, as the length of time that individuals are willing or able to keep the product in the oral cavity is limited.",

PVP-I has well-established general antimicrobial activity, demonstrating in vitro efficacy against gram-positive, gramnegative and some spore-forming bacteria (clostridia, Bacillus spp.) and mycobacteria [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] and a wide range of enveloped and nonenveloped viruses [21] [22] [23] . Recent in vitro studies have demonstrated rapid virucidal activity of PVP-I products against Ebola virus, MERS-CoV and European reference enveloped virus [modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA)] [24, 25] . Considering the proven in vitro efficacy, gargling with PVP-I may be an effective method of preventing the spread of respiratory viruses when an individual is contaminated by the airborne/droplet route or after uptake via the mouth (such as when touching the mouth or food with contaminated hands). The benefit of gargling with PVP-I has already been noted in Japanese clinical respiratory guidelines [26] .",

For all virus testing, AEC (dilution 1:500) was used to visualise antibody binding and infected cells were stained red. Stained cells were examined with a light microscope. The cells were examined microscopically for cytopathic effects (CPE). SARS or MERS infected cells were not stained, but examined microscopically for infectivity and cytopathic effects.",

Against bacteria, Shimizu et al. demonstrated complete efficacy of PVP-I 0.2% solution against clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Alcaligenes faecalis and Alcaligenes xylosoxydans within 30 s using a simple methodology (the broth turbidity method) [18] . In another study, low concentrations of PVP-I gargle/mouthwash (0.23-0.47%) killed methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, including multidrugresistant strains, within 15-60 s in the presence of oral organic matter from healthy volunteers, while 0.02% benzethonium chloride (BEC) and 0.002% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) were ineffective [32] . In a study comparing the bactericidal activities of three gargle/mouthwashes against isolate and standard strains of grampositive (MRSA) and -negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae), PVP-I (diluted 15-, 30-and 60-fold) elicited rapid killing of all three strains after 30 s of exposure, while cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) was effective only against gram-negative strains after 60 s of exposure, and CHG was ineffective [33] .",

Application of PVP-I products with concentrations of 0.23-1% for 1-2 min reduced SARS-CoV virus infectivity from 1.17 9 10 6 TCID 50 /ml to below detectable levels in a study by Kariwa et al., although shorter contact times were not investigated [23] . Ito et al. reported a reduction in viral infectious titres of avian influenza A viruses (H5N1, H5N3, H7N7 and H9N2) to below detectable limits by incubation for only 10 s with six different PVP-I products including 0.23% gargle and 0.23% throat spray [34] . The anti-influenza activity of PVP-I involves inhibition of viral haemagglutinin binding activity and viral neuraminidase catalytic hydrolysis [35] . In the present study, PVP-I oral solution at a concentration of 0.23% was also effective against non-enveloped rotavirus without interfering substance after 15 s of exposure, which is in contrast to in vitro work by Steinmann et al. [36] , in which 7.5% PVP-I handwash was not active against the non-enveloped viruses tested, and by Sauerbrei and Wutzler [37] , in which PVP-I took 5 min to inactivate polyomavirus SV40 and adenovirus. In this study, the virucidal and bactericidal activity of PVP-I gargle/mouthwash was evaluated within a short exposure time (15 s) to reflect a similar or shorter time than the actual gargling time in real-life conditions, since the length of time that individuals are willing to keep an antiseptic product in the oral cavity is limited. PVP-I oral solution at a concentration of 0.23% was effective against all pathogens tested in this study after the minimum contact time of 15 s, regardless of protein load (except rotavirus, which was tested without protein load). Pathogens are eradicated by the active moiety (non PVP-bound 'free' iodine) being released into solution from the PVP-I complex, penetrating the cell wall and inactivating cells by forming complexes with amino acids and unsaturated fatty acids, resulting in impaired protein synthesis and alteration of cell membranes [38] . This basic mechanism of action leads to strong microbicidal activity expressed by multiple modes of action that include the disruption of microbial metabolic pathways, as well as destabilisation of the structural components of cell membranes, causing irreversible damage to the pathogen [39] .",

            "text": "The results of this study suggest that the use of PVP-I gargle/mouthwash may be a useful protective measure against oral and respiratory tract infections. Indeed, following the H1N1 swine flu outbreak in 2009, Japan's Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare recommended daily gargling as a protective hygiene measure to prevent upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) [40] , a practice supported by findings from studies that examined the role of gargling in both healthy individuals and those with frequent or persistent URTIs [14, 41, 42] . Limited clinical studies have been performed that used PVP-I gargle/mouthwash to reduce the incidence of respiratory infections in different settings. Shiraishi and Nakagawa showed a mean reduction rate in bacterial count immediately after gargling of 99.4% for PVP-I in volunteers (compared with 59.7% for CHG and 97.0% for CPC) and a significantly lower absence rate due to URTIs at a Japanese middle school where the use of PVP-I gargle was encouraged compared with schools where PVP-I gargle was not used [33] . In patients with chronic respiratory diseases, gargling with PVP-I was found to reduce the episodes of infections with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus (including MRSA) and Haemophilus influenzae by half [41] . Studies of prophylactic use of PVP-I gargle in patients requiring intubation have also shown significant reductions in oropharyngeal bacterial counts [43] . Oral hygiene using PVP-I may be of particular benefit in certain patient groups such as immunocompromised patients at risk of prolonged virus shedding (which can increase the potential for resistance to antiviral drugs and for nosocomial transmission), patients with influenza to reduce the risk of secondary bacterial infection (that may appear, e.g., as otitis media in children and thus avoid the need for antibiotics) and possibly in hospitalised patients to prevent the spread of influenza during high season.",
