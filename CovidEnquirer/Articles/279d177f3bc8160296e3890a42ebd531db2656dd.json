The objective of the research is to assess the impact of Maryland NH infection preventionists (IPs) on NH quality measures. Methods: Two hundred thirty-four NHs were queried through mailed survey. These survey data were then linked with 2008 quality data from Nursing Home Compare and the On-line Survey Certification of Automated Records. Results: Three of the 8 quality measures examineddinfluenza vaccination for both short-and long-stay residents and pressure ulcer prevention in high-risk residentsdwere significantly associated with the number of IPs. None of the quality measures were shown to be significant with IPs who received specialized training on infection prevention and management compared with those who did not receive specialized training. Conclusion: IPs play a critical role in preventing and managing health care-associated infections in nursing homes, especially in the areas of influenza vaccination and pressure ulcer prevention among high-risk nursing home residents. Quality measures that reflect the effects of IP training may not have been elucidated yet. Further research is needed to support the IP role in order for policy to advocate for increased IP funding.",

            "text": "Health care-associated infections (HAIs) are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in US nursing homes (NHs) with between 1.6 and 3.8 million infections and almost 388,000 deaths occurring annually in this setting. 1 The costs associated with infections in NH settings have a significant impact on the health care system, with annual estimates ranging from $38 to $137 million for antimicrobial therapy and $673 million to $2 billion for hospitalizations. 2 Infections are the reason for one-fourth of all hospitalizations from long-term care facilities. 3, 4 Therefore, the importance of infections in NHs extends beyond just these facilities because millions of NH residents every year are transferred to and from acute care settings and can potentially spread pathogens between settings. 5 Furthermore, outbreaks occur frequently, endemic rates of infection are substantial, and antibiotics are often inappropriately prescribed, leading to greater susceptibility to antibiotic-resistant organisms. 6 NHs have been scrutinized in recent years regarding their handling of HAIs. One study found an average of 15% of all NHs per year received a deficiency citation for infection control from 2000 to 2007. These deficiency citations were received while state surveyors conducted an inspection of the facility. Several staffing levels were also associated with receiving a deficiency citation for infection control. Furthermore, approximately 9% of all NHs per year receive a hand hygiene deficiency citation (ie, F-tag F-444). An upward trend is also evident, with the average yearly percentage of citations increasing from 7.37% (in 2000) to 11 .98% (in 2009). 7 One method of preventing and managing HAIs in NHs is through the facility's infection prevention and control program. The Nursing Home Reform Act mandated that NHs were to have a functioning infection control program in place. 8 These programs are to be multifactorial 9 in nature and include surveillance, outbreak investigations, isolation procedures, educational programs for both employees and residents, antibiotic stewardship, employee and resident health programs, hand hygiene approaches, and reporting procedures. 5 In summary, the research shows that infection control guidelines and infection definitions varied widely across NHs 10 ; NHs only spend an average of 8 hours per week on infection control; and few NHs have a full-time infection preventionist (IP) devoted to preventing infections and managing the infection control program. 11 Maryland is one state that had improved the quality of IPs in NHs. After finding in a statewide study that IP support in NHs was significantly less than in hospitals (in terms of number of IPs per beds and infection control training), 12 it was determined that NHs in this state could benefit from training and regulatory upgrades sponsored by the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (DHMH). The DHMH subsequently rolled out a combined approach to both revise the state regulations aimed at requiring at least 1 designated IP in each NH as well as providing a basic infection control training course for these designated IPs. This course would seek to train these long-term care IPs in 3 basic skills: (1) infection surveillance techniques, (2) isolation and multidrugresistant organism precautions, and (3) recognition and management of outbreaks. Additional information, such as hand hygiene, environmental infection control, tuberculosis prevention, microbiology, and immunization of health care workers, is also covered in the curriculum. This initiative resulted in an increased number of trained IPs in NHs; the NHs with trained IPs responded more quickly to an outbreak than NHs without trained IPs. 13 Whereas some research supports that IPs can result in improved outcomes (eg, reduced infections), 14 this link has not been studied in the NH setting. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the impact of NH IPs on NH quality measures. Specifically, we sought to understand better the relationships among the number of IP staff, IP training, and preventing and managing infections. We hypothesize that a higher number of IPs is associated with better quality in NH settings and whether the IPs' basic training in infection prevention and control is associated with better quality in NH settings.",

Table 1 lists the NH characteristic variables that were used in this analysis as control variables. The variables included in the analyses were derived from the prior research in this area that has examined NH quality. 15, 16 Quality measures As quality indicators for the analysis, the NH quality measures reported on the NHC Web site were used (www.medicare.gov/ NHCompare). NHC is a Web-based report card providing public information on all Medicare and Medicaid certified NHs. Five quality measures were examined in this investigation as the dependent variables: percent of residents with pressure ulcers (high risk and postacute), indwelling urinary catheter, urinary tract infection, pneumococcal vaccination provided (short-stay and long-stay residents), and influenza vaccination provided (shortstay and long-stay residents). These quality measures were chosen based on their relationships to HAIs. These measures have been studied extensively and are generally thought to represent infections in NHs. 9, [17] [18] [19] OSCAR OSCAR data contain information collected as part of state/ federal NH inspections. NHs that accept residents with Medicare and/or Medicaid payments are surveyed. This includes approximately 97% of NHs in the United States. The survey process occurs approximately yearly and includes the recording of many characteristics of the NH (eg, number of beds) and aggregate characteristics of residents (eg, number with dementia). The data are commonly used as a secondary source of NH characteristics. 20 Facility characteristic variables included in this research are Medicaid resident occupancy, private-pay occupancy, size, ownership, chain membership, and occupancy rate. The percent of residents paid for by Medicaid or private pay were used as measures of Medicaid resident occupancy and private-pay resident occupancy, respectively. The number of NH beds was used as a measure of size. Two classes of facility ownership were used: for-profit and not-forprofit. Two classes of chain membership were used: chain and nonchain. The overall occupancy rate is the percent of beds occupied by residents. Three different types of nursing staff were included in the analyses: the number (measured as FTE) of registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, and nurse aides per 100 beds. An average activities of daily living (ADL) score was used to represent case mix. For each of 3 ADL questions (eating, toileting, and transferring) in the OSCAR, a score from 0 to 3 was assigned for using no assistance, moderate need for assistance, and high degree of need for assistance, respectively. These scores were then summed, with higher scores indicating a greater average ADL impairment within the facility.",

This would seem to support the hypothesis that NHs with greater FTEs of an IP are associated with higher quality in terms of influenza vaccination (both short-and long-stay residents) and preventing pressure ulcers in high-risk residents.",

Influenza is a frequent cause of upper respiratory infections in NHs and is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. 21 Prevention through a rigorous vaccination program can significantly reduce a NH's likelihood of experiencing an outbreak. In recent years, widespread communication regarding influenza prevention such during the 2009 H1N1 in pandemic and the 2003-2004 epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome has also increased the awareness for NHs to prevent influenza outbreaks from occurring. 22 Although significant variability exists, an increased number of NH residents now receive the influenza vaccination. 10, 23 This likely can partially be attributed to the inclusion of influenza vaccination as a quality measure. As our study demonstrates, IPs also contribute to increased compliance to this quality measure initiative.",

Nearly 25% of residents admitted to NHs are colonized with MRSA, and another 10% will acquire the organism during their stay. 24 Pressure ulcers are a predominant site for MRSA; thus, their prevention is critical, 25 especially because infected pressure ulcers are costly to treat. 9, 26 IPs play a critical role in both preventing pressure ulcers and reducing the occurrence of MRSA-infected wounds.",

One explanation for this is that these quality measures have not received a great deal of attention in prevention of outbreaks, for example. Only recently have catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) garnered increased attention outside of the hospital setting through national quality improvement initiatives. This is now changing, however. The Department of Health and Human Services National Action Plan for the prevention of HAIs in long-term care settings intends the focus to increase on various infections and their associated metrics, such as facility enrollment in the National Healthcare Safety Network, urinary tract infections/ CAUTIs, Clostridium difficile infection, resident influenza and pneumococcal vaccination, and health care personnel influenza vaccination. 27 Whereas education and professional training has been regarded as one method of increasing infection prevention and control knowledge, 9 this study did not show a significant difference between those IPs who were specially trained to the IPs who were not when examining the quality measures for infections. It is possible that infection control training focuses more on the prevention, control, and epidemiology of resident care management and less on the quality improvement strategies methodology. The quality measures that reflect the long-term effects of IP basic training have not been elucidated. When the Department of Health and Human Services plan begins to be implemented however, IPs will be the individuals to gather the surveillance data and enter it into National Healthcare Safety Network and to initiate any prevention modalities to prevent and/or reduce these infections. The future, therefore, may find that having IPs who have received basic training in infection prevention and control programs will significantly impact current and future quality indicators. Whereas many NHs may have IPs functioning in multiple roles (such as that of the director of nursing, charge nurse, or in-service nurse), 9 we did not account for this in the analysis. In Maryland data, there were no IPs who performed their infection prevention and control job full-time. Of the 123 responding facilities, the IPs performed at least 1 other function and usually 3 or 4.",

The updated surveillance guidance includes revised definitions to standardize terminology regarding infections 29 and provide data for better surveillance of HAIs in NHs. Also, further discussion in how this reporting system can complement the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality's common format for reporting HAIs 30 is also needed so that multiple forms of reporting do not hinder the reporting process. 31 However, without substantial infrastructure supports and government requirements in place, the implementation of such quality improvement programs may be futile. Previous research has cited that, whereas infections are extremely common, outbreaks are reported less often than less frequently occurring events such as abuse. 32 This study identified that NHs with greater FTE support of an IP resulted in better outcomes in some areas. Thus, further research in the role of reporting outbreaks and quality improvement strategies to prevent and track infections in NHs is critical, especially in NHs where minimal support is provided. For example, in the aftermath of severe acute respiratory syndrome, the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long Term Care provided funding to increase IPs in long-term care homes to prevent and better manage future outbreaks of HAIs. 33 Future research examining the cost of IPs and the effectiveness and proper staffing levels for the IP is needed for policy to further guide clinical care.",
