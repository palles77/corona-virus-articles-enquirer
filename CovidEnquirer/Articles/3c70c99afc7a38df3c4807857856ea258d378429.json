In Pompe disease (also known as 18 Glycogen Storage Disorder type II), the accumulation of undegraded glycogen in lysosomes 19 leads to cellular dysfunction, primarily in muscle and heart tissues. Pompe disease is an active 20 candidate of clinical research, with pharmacological chaperone therapy tested and enzyme 21 replacement therapy approved. Despite production of large amounts of recombinant GAA 22 annually, the structure of GAA has not been reported until now. Here, we describe the first 23 structure of GAA, at 1.7\u00c5 resolution. Three structures of GAA complexes reveal the molecular 24 basis for the hundreds of mutations that lead to Pompe disease and for pharmacological 25 chaperoning in the protein. The GAA structure reveals a surprising second sugar-binding site 26",

Electron density is missing for loops 116-122, 199-205, and 782-792. 125 Presumably, the flexible loops in the intact protein limited the resolution of the intact GAA 126 crystals. After cleavage of the three loops, the remaining fragments remain associated by non- Active site and ligand binding 136 The active site of GAA is an acidic pocket at the base of a conical funnel lined by hydrophobic 137 residues in the (\u03b2/\u03b1) 8 barrel catalytic domain (Fig. 1, Fig. 2, and Fig. 2 supplement A) . The To better understand substrate recognition in GAA, we determined complexes of the enzyme 155 with isomaltose and maltotriose (di-and tri-saccharide fragments of glycogen) at 2.0 and 1.9\u00c5 156 resolution, respectively. The structures show glucose present in the active site with no clear proximity of active site residues D282, M519, and R600, \u03b2-linked substituents beyond a 161 hydroxyl are sterically blocked, and thus we conclude that the \u03b2-glucose appears in the active 162 site after cleavage of \u03b1-linked substrate and subsequent ring opening of the \u03b1-glucose product. 163 Residues D404, D616, and H674 confer glucose substrate specificity by hydrogen bonding to 164 hydroxyls on the ligand (Fig. 2) . Hydrophobic residues W376, L405, I441, W481, W516, M519, 165 W613 and F649 contribute to active site architecture and substrate binding. We also determined the complex of GAA bound to 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) (Fig. 2) shallow cleft in the N1 domain 34\u00c5 away from the active site ( Fig. 3 and Fig. 3 supplement A) . 176 In the second site, the non-reducing ends of isomaltose and maltotriose bind identically, with 177 hydrogen bonds between the glucose hydroxyls and the side chain of D91 and the main chain per side chain atom possessing less than 2 \u00c5 2 , between 2-9 \u00c5 2 , and above 9 were considered 249 buried, partially buried or exposed respectively.

The glycogen model fits into the two GAA binding sites with only 198 minor adjustments of two dihedrals.

            "text": ". Of the Pompe disease-associated mutations, 245 are missense mutations leading to substitutions of single amino acids. To better understand genotype-phenotype correlations in Pompe disease, we mapped the 245 reported missense mutations onto the structure (Fig. 1 supplement B). 64% of all pathological point mutations map to the catalytic domain, 22% map to the N2 domain, and the remaining 14% map to the other three domains. Changes in buried residues are found more often than in surface residues: 23% of all buried residues have a Pompe disease-associated mutation, while only 5% of surface residues do (Fig. 4 supplement A). Because missense mutations in buried residues are most common, Pompe disease is primarily a disorder of protein Human GAA was expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells(Moreland et al., 2005). GAA (in 50mM sodium phosphate pH 6.2, 4% mannitol and 0.01% Tween 80) was incubated with proteinase K at a molar ratio of 280:1 at 37\u02daC for 20 hours. The protease was removed by size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75 10/300 GL column (GE) equilibrated with 50mM sodium phosphate pH 6.2 and 250mM NaCl.Protease-treated GAA was concentrated to 7-20mg/ml in 20mM Bis-Tris, pH 6. The protein was mixed 1:1 to 1:3 with crystallization solution containing 100mM sodium HEPES, pH 7.5, 2% (v/v) PEG 400 and 2M ammonium sulfate. Crystals took two to six months to grow in sitting drop vapor diffusion experiments. Crystals were transferred into harvest buffer (100mM sodium HEPES, pH 7.5, 3% (v/v) PEG 400, and 2.2M ammonium sulfate) and flash cooled in harvest buffer with 20% glycerol added. To form complexes, crystals were soaked in harvest buffer supplemented with ligand, either 2mM DNJ for 12 hours, 10% (w/v) isomaltose for 2-10 minutes, or 10% (w/v) maltotriose for 2-10 minutes. Prior to cooling, the ligand soaks were shifted to harvest buffer containing 2mM DNJ and 20% glycerol or harvest buffer containing 20% saccharide. X-ray diffraction data were collected on beam line 14-1 of Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource at 1.1808\u00c5 wavelength. Diffraction data were indexed and integrated using iMosflm, and scaled and reduced in space group P2 1 2 1 2 1 using Aimless (Evans andMurshudov, 2013) and Ctruncate (Stein and Ballard, 2009). Molecular replacement was performed in AMoRe (Navaza, 1994) from the CCP4 suite (Cowtan et al., 2011) using the 44% identical N-terminal subunit of human maltase-glucoamylase (PDB code 2QLY) (Sim et al., 2008), resulting in an initial R-factor of 46%. Subsequent building and refinement was performed in Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004) and Refmac5 (Murshudov et al., 2011), respectively. Figures were constructed in Pymol (Schr\u00f6dinger, 2015) and PovScript (Fenn et al., Accessible surface area per residue was calculated using Areaimol in CCP4 (Cowtan et al., 2011) and then ported to Excel for further analysis.
