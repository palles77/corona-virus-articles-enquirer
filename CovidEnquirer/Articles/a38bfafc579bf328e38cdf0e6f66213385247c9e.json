            "text": "The precise role of interleukin (IL)-10 in breast cancer is not clear. Previous studies suggested a tumorpromoting role of IL-10 in breast cancer, whereas recent discoveries that IL-10 activated and expanded tumor-resident CD8 + T cells challenged the traditional view. Here, we investigated the role of IL-10 in HLA-A2-positive breast cancer patients with Grade III, Stage IIA or IIB in-situ and invasive ductal carcinoma, and compared it with that of IL-2, the canonical CD8 + T cell growth factor. We first observed that breast cancer patients presented higher serum levels of IL-2 and IL-10 than healthy controls. Upon prolonged TCR stimulation, peripheral blood CD8 + T cells from breast cancer patients tended to undergo apoptosis, which could be prevented by the addition of IL-2 and/or IL-10. The cytotoxicity of TCR-activated CD8 + T cells was also enhanced by exogenous IL-2 and/or IL-10. Interestingly, IL-2 and IL-10 demonstrated synergistic effects, since the enhancement in CD8 + T cell function when both cytokines were added was greater than the sum of the improvements mediated by each individual cytokine. IL-10 by itself could not promote the proliferation of CD8 + T cells but could significantly enhance IL-2-mediated promotion of CD8 + T cell proliferation. In addition, the cytotoxicity of tumor-infiltrating CD8 + T cells in breast tumor was elevated when both IL-2 and IL-10 were present but not when either one was absent. This synergistic effect was stopped by CD4 + CD25 + regulatory T cells (Treg), which depleted IL-2 in a cell number-dependent manner. Together, these results demonstrated that IL-2 and IL-10 could work synergistically to improve the survival, proliferation, and cytotoxicity of activated CD8 + T cells, an effect suppressible by CD4 + CD25 + Treg cells.",

            "text": "Interleukin (IL)-10 is a pleiotropic cytokine with complicated roles in tumor progression and antitumor immunity (Oft, 2014) . IL-10 could suppress the expression of MHC class II and CD80/CD86 in antigen-presenting cells (Hashimoto et al., 2001) , and promote alternative activation of macrophages (Nakamura et al., 2015) . IL-10 could also limit the extent of inflammation by inhibiting the expression of proinflammatory cytokines from T cells and macrophages (Ouyang et al., 2011) . These functions of IL-10 might suppress antitumor immunity but were essential for the suppression of tumor-promoting inflammation (Oft, 2014) . IL-10-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation in T cells and macrophages was critical to the prevention of inflammatory bowel disease, a common preceding event to colorectal cancer (Mager et al., 2016) . Interestingly, several recent studies indicated that IL-10 also promoted antitumor immunity through proinflammatory actions. IL-10 \u2212/\u2212 mice succumbed to more rapid tumor metastasis with a lack of intratumor expansion of CD8 + T cells and reduced major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules (Mumm et al., 2011) . Injection of pegylated IL-10 significantly elevated the levels of interferon (IFN)-\u2425 and granzymes in tumor (Mumm et al., 2011; Mumm and Oft, 2013) . In addition, IL-10 was required for the activation of tumor-resident, but not lymph node-resident, CD8 + T cells (Emmerich et al., 2012) . Together, these partially contrasting results suggest that the role of IL-10 in tumor is likely context-dependent.",

All rights reserved. exact mechanism underlying its pathology is still unknown. Like in other tumors, the role of IL-10 in breast cancer is also unclear. Breast cancer patients tended to present elevated serum IL-10 (Hamidullah Changkija and Konwar, 2012) . The significance of the correlation between IL-10 concentration and breast cancer prognosis was dependent on the patient cohort, types of treatment, and the location of IL-10, but most studies demonstrated that higher IL-10 levels were associated with worse disease status (Chavey et al., 2007; Hamidullah Changkija and Konwar, 2012) . However, since breast cancer cells, but not normal breast tissues, directly expressed IL-10 (Chavey et al., 2007; Venetsanakos et al., 1997) , the high IL-10 expression might be a result rather than the reason of cancer progression. Also, whether IL-10 could activate and expand tumor-resident CD8 + T cells is yet unclear in breast cancer.",

IL-2 and IL-10 synergistically increased the survival of activated, but not quiescent, CD8\u00b1 T cells CD8 + T cell is considered the main effector cell in antitumor immune responses (Kilinc et al., 2009 ). Both IL-2 and IL-10 demonstrated anti-apoptotic function in CD8 + T cells (Liu et al., 2010; Oft, 2014) . We first found that breast cancer patients presented elevated serum IL-2 and IL-10 levels than healthy individuals (Fig. 1A) . To compare and contrast the roles of IL-2 and IL-10 on CD8 + T cell survival, CD4-depleted PBMCs from breast cancer individuals were unstimulated or stimulated through the T cell receptor (TCR) with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies, in the presence of no additional cytokine (None), additional IL-2 (+IL-2), additional IL-10 (+IL-10), or additional IL-2 and IL-10 (+IL-2 + IL-10). CD4 + T cells were depleted because they could secrete high amount of IL-2 and IL-10 and produce confounding results. The survival of CD8 + T Fig. 1 . IL-2 and/or IL-10 addition significantly improved the survival of TCR-stimulated CD8 + T cells.

After short-term (24 h) incubation, no significant differences in the apoptosis level of CD8 + T cells among various treatment conditions were observed (Fig. 1C) . However, after longer-term (72 h) incubation, in TCR-stimulated CD8 + T cells, the addition of either IL-2 or IL-10 had suppressed the level of apoptosis, compared to those with no additional cytokine (Fig. 1C) . When both IL-2 and IL-10 were added, the increase in the survival rate of TCR-stimulated CD8 + T cells was higher than the increases in IL-2 alone and IL-10 alone combined. Interestingly, this effect was only observed in TCR-stimulated, but not unstimulated CD8 + T cells, as the viability in TCR-stimulated CD8 + T cells presented lower viability than unstimulated CD8 + T cells when no additional cytokine was added (Fig. 1C) .",

IL-2 alone promoted the proliferation of TCR-stimulated CD8 + T cells. While IL-10 alone did not significantly increase the proliferation of TCR-stimulated CD8 + T cells, the IL-2 and IL-10 combined resulted in the highest frequency of dividing CD8 + T cells (Fig. 3B) .

However, the CD4 + CD25 + Treg cells were shown to have crucial antiinflammatory properties in breast cancer (Curiel, 2007; Watanabe et al., 2010) . Therefore, we decided to examine the actions of Treg cells on the effects of IL-2/IL-10 on CD8 + T cells. Foxp3 represents the canonical transcription factor for Treg cells. Foxp3 + T cells were concentrated in the CD25 + fraction of CD4 + T cells (Fig. 4A and C) . We fractionated total CD4 + T cells into CD25 + and CD25 \u2212 fractions, with greater than 91.5% purity for the CD25 + fraction and 99% purity for the CD25 \u2212 fraction (Fig. 4B  and D) . Each fraction was then added to the TCR-stimulated CD4- Fig. 2 . IL-2 and/or IL-10 addition helped TCR-stimulated CD8\u00b1 T cells to maintain their cytotoxicity. The MCF-7 breast cancer cell line was labeled with Cr-51 and was used as target cells. 0% specific lysis corresponds to the spontaneous Cr-51 release level and 100% specific lysis corresponds to the Cr-51 release level when 1% Triton X-100 was used to lyse all target cells.

We next investigated the effect of CD4 + CD25 + Treg cells on the concentration of IL-2 and IL-10, and found that the addition of CD4 + CD25 + Treg cells significantly reduced the concentration of IL-2 in a cell number-dependent manner (Fig. 5D) . However, CD4 + CD25 + Treg cells did not directly suppress the transcription of IL-2 mRNA in CD8 + T cells (Fig. 5E ).

IL-2 and/or IL-10 addition increased the proliferation of TCR-stimulated CD8\u00b1 T cells. CD8 + T cells in CD4-depleted PBMCs were labeled with CFSE and TCR-stimulated with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 monoclonal antibodies (3 g/mL each) for 72 h and were harvested for flow cytometry examination. (A) The percentage of dividing cells (bold numbers) was gated as CFSE-low cells. Panels shown were already gated on CD3 + CD4 \u2212 CD8 + T cells. (B) The frequencies of dividing cells in None, +IL-2, +IL-10, and +IL-2 + IL-10 conditions after 72 h TCR-stimulation of CD8 + T cells. (C) The number of CD8 + T cells, counted in flow cytometer, at the end of 72 h TCR-stimulation, starting from 10 6 CD8 + T cells per condition. The statistical difference between each experimental group and the corresponding None control group was examined by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test.

CD4 + CD25 + Treg cells or CD4 + CD25 \u2212 T cells were added to the +IL-2 + IL-10-treated TCR-stimulated CD8 + T cell culture for 72 h. The (A) viability, (B) cytotoxicity (E/T = 100/1), and (C) level of proliferation in CD8 + T cells were examined. The statistical difference between each experimental condition and the CD4-depleted control was examined by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test. (D) The supernatant IL-2 and IL-10 level when CD4 + CD25 + Tregs were added at various concentrations for 72 h, in TCR-stimulated CD4-depleted PBMCs. Each condition was supplemented with 3 g/mL IL-2 and 3 g/mL IL-10 initially. (E) The mRNA expression of IL-2 and IL-10 in CD8 + T cells at the end of the 72 h incubation, relative to GAPDH mRNA level.

Growing amounts of evidence suggest that IL-10 is more than a regulatory cytokine in antitumor immune responses. Both the proinflammatory and antiinflammatory actions of IL-10 have been implicated in the development as well as the suppression of tumor. On the tumor-suppressing side, IL-10 inhibits Th17 inflammation and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u2423 and IL-23 enrichment, which could exert tumorigenic effects (Langowski et al., 2006) . IL-10 also induces the activation and expansion of tumor-resident CD8 + T cells (Emmerich et al., 2012) . On the tumor-promoting side, IL-10 is highly expressed in cancerous breast tissues but not the normal breast tissue, and is associated with higher grades of breast cancer in some studies (Chavey et al., 2007; Hamidullah Changkija and Konwar, 2012) . These contrasting observations suggest that the precise role of IL-10 in cancer is Fig. 6 . IL-2 and IL-10 synergistically improved the cytotoxicity of tumor-infiltrating cells but could be suppressed by CD4 \u00b1 CD25\u00b1 Treg cells. (A) Freshly isolated CD4-depleted tumor-infiltrating mononuclear cells were TCR stimulated in None, +IL-2, +IL-10, and +IL-2 + IL-10 conditions for 72 h, after which the cytotoxicity of tumor-infiltrating CD8 + T cells was examined at 50/1 E/T ratio. The statistical difference between each experiment and the None control was examined by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test. (B) Various concentrations of circulating CD4 + CD25 + Treg cells were added in the IL-2 and IL-10-treated TCR-stimulated tumor-infiltrating CD8 + T cell during the 72 h incubation, after which the cytotoxicity was examined at 50/1 E/T ratio. The statistical difference between each experiment and the 0 control was examined by one-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett's test. Bars represent SEM. ns: not significant. **P < 0.01. ***P < 0.001. context-dependent. In this study, we showed that the full antitumor capacity of IL-10 likely required the concurrent presence of IL-2. First, we found that after long-term TCR stimulation, the CD8 + T cells in breast cancer patients tended to undergo apoptosis, a phenomenon suppressible by IL-2 and/or IL-10 ( Fig. 1) . The cytotoxicity of TCR-stimulated CD8 + T cells also tended to decrease over time, a trend that could be reverted by IL-2 and IL-10 (Fig. 2) . IL-2 significantly increased the level of proliferation in TCR-stimulated CD8 + T cells, while IL-10 did not (Fig. 3) . Combining these results, IL-10 seemed to function primarily by improving the survival, but not the proliferation of TCR-stimulated CD8 + T cells. A similar role of IL-10 was previously discovered in acute coronavirus-induced encephalitis, where highly activated CD8 + T cells transiently expressed IL-10 while maintaining their cytotoxic functionality (Trandem et al., 2011) . Notably, the addition of IL-2 and IL-10 demonstrated synergistic effects, because when both IL-2 and IL-10 were present, the improvement in CD8 + T cell survival, proliferation and cytotoxicity was higher than the sum of the improvements mediated by each individual cytokine. Furthermore, the tumor-infiltrating CD8 + T cells presented low cytotoxicity and could be rescued by neither IL-2 nor IL-10 alone but by the combined effects of IL-2 and IL-10 ( Fig. 6 ). Together, this study offered a possible explanation to the partially disagreeing observations regarding the role of IL-10 in cancer, that the specific outcome of IL-10 enrichment was dependent on IL-2. This study also suggested that a combination of IL-2 and IL-10 might be incorporated in future immunotherapies.",

First, we found that breast cancer patients had higher serum IL-2 and IL-10 concentrations than healthy individuals, suggesting that the immune system was more activated in breast cancer patients (Fig. 1) . However, the concentration of intratumoral IL-2 and IL-10 was not examined in this cohort of patients due to a lack of more tumor samples. It is also unclear why tumor-infiltrating CD8 + T cells presented lower cytotoxicity than corresponding peripheral blood CD8 + T cells. In normal breast tissue resected together with the tumor, very few tissue-infiltrating CD8 + T cells could be recovered. Therefore, a \"normal\" control was lacking in experiments performed on tumor-infiltrating T cells. Furthermore, the majority of the conclusions were derived using isolated PBMC subsets in an in vitro environment while ignoring potential in vivo interactions. Therefore, further studies in animal models are necessary to confirm the concentration, function, and interactions of IL-2 and IL-10 in the tumor microenvironment.",
