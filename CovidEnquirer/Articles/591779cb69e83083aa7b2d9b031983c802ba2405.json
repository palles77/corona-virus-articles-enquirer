Methods: RT-PCR assays were carried out to screen for the presence of respiratory syncytial virus A and B, adenovirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza viruses 1 to 4, influenza virus A and B, metapneumovirus, bocavirus, coronavirus OC43/229E and NL63, and enterovirus in nasopharyngeal secretions of 55 KD patients and 78 control subjects. Results: Virus detection rates in KD patients and control subjects were 32.7% and 30.8%, respectively (P=0.811). However, there was no significant association between the presence of any of the 15 viruses and the incidence of KD. Comparisons between the 18 patients with positive RT-PCR results and the other 37 KD patients revealed no significant differences in terms of clinical findings (including the prevalence of incomplete presentation of the disease) and coronary artery diameter. Conclusion: A positive RT-PCR for currently epidemic respiratory viruses should not be used as an evidence against the diagnosis of KD. These viruses were not associated with the incomplete presentation of KD and coronary artery dilatation.",

The association rate of KD with antecedent respiratory illness has been reported to be 56 to 83% 1, 2) . Laboratory evaluation for detection of respiratory viruses is occasionally performed in febrile children with respiratory symptoms before confirmation of the diagnosis of KD. Recently, molecular diagnostic tests, such as real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), have been more frequently used as a laboratory method, because molecular diagnostic tests for the detection of all epidemic respiratory tract infection-related viruses allow a thorough etiological assessment and better management of children with respiratory tract infection 3) . However, we propose that identification of respiratory virus during the diagnostic evaluation of febrile children with respiratory symptoms cannot be used as exclusive evidence against the diagnosis of KD. In one study without control subjects, the identification rate of respiratory viruses through multiplex reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR in children with KD was reported to be 22% 4) .",

We collected nasopharyngeal swab samples from 55 of these patients. Parents of the remaining 14 patients refused participation. Among 55 subjects, 48 (87.3%) fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for KD 6) , and 7 (12.7%) were diagnosed with incomplete KD. Diagnostic criteria of KD were fever, defined as body temperature above than 38\u00b0C persisting \u22655 days, and a presence of \u22654 principal featureschanges in extremities, polymorphous exanthema, bilateral bulbar conjunctival injection without exudates, changes in lips and oral cavity, and cervical lymphadenopathy (\u22651.5 cm diameter) 6) . Fever duration of 3 or 4 days was permitted on establishing a diagnosis. An incomplete KD was diagnosed in a case with persisting fever and 2 or 3 principal features but without alternative diagnosis. Refractory cases are those in which fever persisted or recurred after 36 hours of initial infusion of immunoglobulin. We recruited 3 age-matched healthy control subjects from a day nursery and a kindergarten for every 2 children with KD within 1 month of the recruitment of patients. Children who have had a fever with respiratory symptoms within the previous month were excluded from the control group. A presentation of significant symptom usually from the respiratory tract infection-rhinorrhea, cough, or sputum was defined as respiratory symptom. Nine of the children with KD were matched with only one control subject due to failure of recruitment (in 7 cases) and loss of samples during processing (in 2 cases). A final group of 78 control subjects were recruited, and samples of nasopharyngeal swab were collected from them. The patients were subdivided into RT-PCR positive and negative groups. Clinical and echocardiographic data during the acute phase of illness were surveyed by review of the medical records. Coronary artery dilatation was defined according to the recommendation by Japanese Ministry of Health 7) .",

However, we failed to recruit control subjects and process samples on several occasions, with the result that the ratio of patients to controls was slightly less than 1.5:1. Additionally, the age was higher in controls, although we think that it was not so critical. Age range of controls also was in high prevalent age range of KD.
