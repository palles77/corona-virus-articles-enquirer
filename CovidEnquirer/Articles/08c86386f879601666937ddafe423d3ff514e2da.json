            "text": "What exactly is disaster medicine? If you have decided to purchase and read this book, it is likely a question you have wrestled with. Disaster itself is not an easily defined entity, thus the new medical specialty evolving around it is continuously undergoing metamorphosis. Because a disaster is a local event, throughout history, the local medical responders have cared for the victims of disaster. The same medical personnel who provide health care on a daily basis also assume the responsibility of providing care to patients with illness or injury resulting from a disaster. Unlike other areas of medicine, however, the care of casualties from a disaster requires the health care provider to integrate into the larger, predominantly nonmedical multidisciplinary response. This demands a knowledge base far greater than medicine alone. To operate safely as part of a coordinated disaster response, either in a hospital or in the field, an understanding of the basic principles of emergency management is necessary. Now we begin to see the evolution of the specialty of disaster medicine. To respond properly and efficiently to disasters, all health care personnel should have a fundamental understanding of the principles of disaster medicine (which incorporates emergency management in its practice) and what their particular role would be in the response to the many different types of disasters.",

Although disaster medicine is not yet an accredited medical subspecialty, those who practice it have been involved in some of the most catastrophic events in human history. Practitioners of presentday disaster medicine have responded to the aftermaths of the tsunami in Southeast Asia, 1 Hurricane Andrew, 2 the Haiti Earthquake, 3 the Madrid Train Bombings, 4 and the World Trade Center Attacks, 5 to name a few. During the past several decades, we have seen the first applications of basic disaster medicine principles in real-time events, and as demonstrated by the devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and the devastating Ebola Outbreak of 2014-2015, there is sure to be continued need for such applications.",

As active members of their community, emergency specialists should take part in mitigation and preparedness on the hospital, local, and regional levels. Once disaster strikes, their role continues in the response and recovery phases. By participating in the varied areas of disaster preparation and response, including hazard vulnerability analyses, resource allocation, and creation of disaster legislation, the emergency medicine specialist integrates into the disaster cycle as an active participant.

            "text": "Over the course of recorded history, natural disasters have predominated in frequency and magnitude over human-made ones. Some of the earliest disasters have caused enormous numbers of casualties, with resultant disruption of the underlying community infrastructure. Yersinia pestis caused the death of countless millions in several epidemics over hundreds of years. The etiologic agent of bubonic plague, Y. pestis, devastated Europe by killing large numbers of people and leaving societal ruin in its wake. 6 During the writing of this chapter, an Ebola outbreak raged in West Africa, along with concern that a worldwide pandemic might ensue. 7 The 2014 and 2015 Ebola and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) outbreaks have proven that, despite the passage of time and the great advances in medicine, the world continues to be affected by disease outbreaks. In addition, diseases that have been eradicated have the potential of being reintroduced into society, either accidentally from the few remaining sources in existence around the world, as in the 2015 measles outbreak in the United States, or by intentional release. Such events have the potential of devastating results, as the baseline intrinsic immunity the world population developed during the natural presence of the disease has faded over time, putting much larger numbers of people at risk. Finally, with the advent of air travel allowing people to be on the opposite side of the world in a matter of hours, the bloom effect of an outbreak is much harder to predict and control. Disease outbreaks that were previously controlled by natural borders, such as oceans, no longer have those barriers, making the likelihood of worldwide outbreak much greater now than it was hundreds of years ago. We saw evidence of this in 2014, with Ebola-infected patients arriving in Spain and the United States from West Africa. During that outbreak, naysayers to intrusive actions such as quarantine and travel restrictions cited following the \"science\" learned since the disease emerged in central Africa in the 1970s. The problem with such logic was that Ebola had never before been seen in urban settings such as Nigeria, New York City, and Dallas, Texas. Transmission parameters in such settings were truly uncharted waters for the medical community.",

Considering that the earthquakes that caused these tsunamis occurred hours before the devastation, it is difficult to understand how today's advanced society, able to travel far into space among other great achievements, was unable to mitigate against some of the most deadly natural events in recent history. The realization that disaster can strike without warning and inflict casualties on the order of the 2004, 2010, and 2011 earthquakes and tsunamis, despite our many technological advances, serves as a warning that mitigation, preparedness, response, and recovery to natural disaster must continue to be studied and practiced vigorously.",

However, the 2015 flood in Peru that killed 20 people and tropical storm in Madagascar that killed 14 have also been called disasters. Likewise, the 2003 explosion of the space shuttle Columbia on reentry into Earth's atmosphere that killed the crew of seven astronauts onboard has often been referred to as the Columbia Disaster in the lay press. How can an event resulting in the loss of seven people be placed in the same category as one that kills hundreds of thousands? Herein lies the paradox of disaster. What is it?

Clearly, this definition does not allow one to justify the use of disaster in describing that horrific accident, which brings to light a discrepancy in how disaster specialists and the public term events. The Columbia accident, as an example, does not meet any accepted criteria of disaster. It was, however, an exceedingly tragic event, seen by millions on television, as it was unfolding. It was tragic by the word's very definition in the Cambridge Dictionary: \"A very sad event, especially one involving death or suffering.\" Public perception of such events may cause this misnomer, with a tragic incident being termed a disaster.

The role of medicine and emergency medical services in disaster response has abundant historical precedence. Responsibility for the care of the injured from a disaster has been borne by the emergency specialist or its equivalent throughout history. Therefore disaster medical response, in its many forms, has been around for thousands of years. Whenever a disaster has struck, there has been some degree of a medical response to care for the casualties. In the United States, much of the disaster medical response has followed a military model, with lessons learned through battlefield scenarios during the last two centuries. 9 The military experience has demonstrated how to orchestrate efficient care to mass casualties in austere environments. However, it does not translate directly into civilian practice. For instance, scenarios encountered on the battlefield with young, fit soldiers injured by trauma are vastly different from those encountered in a rural setting, where an earthquake may inflict casualties on a population with baseline malnutrition or advanced age. With this realization came the need to create disaster medicine as an evolution from the military practice. This recent organization of the medical role in disasters into a more formalized specialty of disaster medicine has enabled practitioners to define further their role in the overall disaster preparedness and response system.",

Disaster medicine is predicated on the principle of providing care to the most victims possible, as dictated by the resources available and by patient condition and likelihood of survival. This amounts to a balance of needs versus assets, an equation that can change over time as more resources are pulled into the response. Thus the triage of patients in disasters is fluid and should be repeated regularly. Disaster triage involves assigning patients into treatment categories based on their predicted survivability. This triage process may dictate that the most severely injured patient is not given medical care but rather, it is given to a less critically injured patient. To the best of his or her ability, the triage officer must make a determination as to whether, in the environment of the specific disaster and the availability of resources, a given patient has a significant probability of survival or does not. If it is the latter, disaster triage principles mandate that care be given to the patient with a higher likelihood of survival. This basic disaster triage principle can have a profound psychological effect on the care provider. As a physician, one is trained to render care to the sick and not to leave the side of a needy patient.
