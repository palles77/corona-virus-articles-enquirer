This technique lacks the sensitivity and specificity of Western blot analysis and cannot differentiate exposure to S. neurona, the causative agent of EPM, from exposure to S. fayeri, a common parasite of equine skeletal muscle. 5 Western blot analysis is based on electrophoretic separation of proteins from cultured S. neurona merozo ites. Separation of parasite proteins permits evaluation of serum and CSF samples for the presence of antibodies that react with S. neurona-specific proteins.",

High seroprevalence among clinically normal horses limits the value of serum testing.

Seroprevalence among horses with neurologic disease, however, has been twice that of the general horse population.

It has been found that peracute cases initially may test negative and that long-term cases with permanent CNS damage also may test negative. Apparently, some horses also respond poorly and do not produce detectable amounts of parasite-specific antibody. False positive results also may occur. The percentage among horses without detectable histopathologic lesions of EPM, however, has been low. Blood contamination of CSF during collection has been the most common reason for false-positive CSF results. Samples that contain obvious blood contamination may be confounded and should be avoided. New samples should be drawn in a few days. Centrifugation and removal of red blood cells does not correct the problem. Serum antibodies will remain in the CSF supernate. Blood-brain barrier compromise also may allow serum antibodies to pass into CSF. The immunoglobulin G (IgG) index/ albumin quotient developed by Dr. Frank Andrews (University of Ten nessee, Knoxville, TN) permits accurate evaluation of blood-brain barrier integrity and provides valuable assistance for interpretation of EPM test results. 1",

The nucleotide sequence of each primer was selected to match a small piece of the parasite or target DNA to be amplified.
