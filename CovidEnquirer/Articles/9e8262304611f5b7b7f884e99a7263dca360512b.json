Due to the tendency for untranslated regions of genes to diverge after duplication, the identity between the 3' untranslated regions of the tracheal (7A) cDNA and the stomach 2 cDNA indicates that both are products of the same gene. In view of this, the substantial extension of the 5' end of the tracheal7A cDNA beyond that of the stomach 2 cDNA (determined by primer extension to be full length) denotes the occurrence of tissue-specific RNA processing.",

            "text": "Primer extension data also show that the transcription start site of the tracheal 7A cognate mRNA is approximately 220 bp upstream of that of the stomach 2 cognate mRNA. This could occur by one of two mechanisms. First, stomach 2 and tracheal 7A cognate mRNAs may have two different transcription start sites in exon 1. Ifso, genomic DNA would be identical to 7A, up to and including the u extra\" 5' sequence not present in stomach 2 cDNA. Alternatively, 7A may span an intron, with its transcription start site occurring in a previously unrecognized upstream exon. In that case, genomic DNA would correspond to 7A sequence up to a point, but diverge at the intron-exon boundary. Comparison of 7A and genomic sequences reveal that the latter is the case, since the 5' end of 7A consists of 11 bp not present in a 3 kB genomic clone spanning this region. The interface between the 11 bp and the remainder of the 7A cDNA has the general properties of a splice site. This suggests that the 7A cognate mRNA contains at least one additional exon as compared to the stomach 2 cognate mRNA. Further, the presence of a TATA box approximately 30 bp upstream of the transcription start site of stomach 2 (within the 5' untranslated region of 7A) suggests that an alternate promoter drives expression of this gene in the trachea. This promoter could mediate phenotype-specific lysozyme synthesis. SESSION 7 ways, environmental stimuli trigger the synthesis or activation of transcription factors in specific cell types. II Once activated, transcription factors can enter the nucleus and interact with regulatory DNA sequences on specific genes to upregulate or downregulate transcription. Our objective was to analyze the regulatory DNA sequences and corresponding transcription factors for lysozyme and mucin genes to shed light on the molecular events mediating serous and mucous cell-specific gene expression. To do this, it was necessary to first isolate cDNAs encoding lysozyme and mucin, and subsequently use them to isolate genomic clones containing DNA regulatory sequences. T he human respiratory tract is a system of tubes leading air from outside the body to a site of close contact with capillary beds where O 2 and CO 2 exchange occurs. While passing through the conducting airways, air is warmed, humidified, and cleansed by contact with a mucus layer lining the inner surface of the airways. The mucus layer is fonned by the composite secretions of mucous cells in the epithelium lining the airway lumen and submucosal gland cells. The glands are, by volume, the major component of the secretory system. I Glands lie in the submucosa of all cartilaginous airways and communicate with the airway lumen through ducts. Microscopic analysis reveals two gland cell types: serous cells and mucous cells. 2 Whereas serous cells secrete bactericidal proteins such as lysozyme and lactoferrin, mucous cells primarily secrete mucin. 3 During fetal development, the airway glands develop by downgrowth of the epithelium into submucosal connective tissue. 4 \u2022 S The gland buds first consist of relatively undifferentiated cells containing abundant glycogen and no secretory granules. 6 . 7 Within a few days, serous and mucous granules appear,6.7 reflecting the acquisition of mature phenotype. Thus, from a common stem cell, two subpopulations emerge: one producing lysozyme and lactoferrin and the other, synthesizing mucin. We are interested in the molecular events mediating the commitment of stem cells to each of these two pathways. These events are not only significant in the context of development, but also playa role in maintaining a balanced proportion of cell types throughout adult life. It is important to understand the mechanisms underlying serous and mucous cell differentiation because diseaserelated abnormalities in the functioning of these mechanisms could have critical effects on the rheology and antibacterial properties of the secretion.",

The DNA from dog, co~and rat, digested with the same enzymes, yielded multiple bands. Pursuing studies in the rat, we performed northern blots using RNA from the intestine, airways, and heart of specific pathogen-free (SPF) rats. As expected from the positive southern blot, rat RNA hybridized strongly with SMUC-4I. In the SPF rats, intestinal RNA produced an intense, polydisperse signal, (maximum size 13 kb), whereas that from the airways and heart was negative. The airway negativity is consistent with the fact that mucous cells are rare in SPF rats. 22 ,Z3 The negative hybridization result in the airways of SPF 46S rats was reversed in rats that lived in the animal colony for 1 to 3 weeks. Serum analysis revealed that some rats spontaneously became infected with Sendai virus, Corona virus, or CAR bacillus. All rats with signmcant antibody titers for Sendai virus showed mucin hybridization signals. The SPF rats, as well as those infected by other pathogens, did not. Mucin hybridization signals obtained from airway RNA of Sendai virus-infected rats that were also exposed to S02 showed signals more intense than those from rats with infection alone.J4 These data indicate that infection and irritation increase mucin mRNA steady state in rat airways. This does not seem to occur secondary to mucous cell mitosis because mucous cells (containing electron lucent secretory granules) do not incorporate 3H thymidine during the period of mucin mRNA induction.IS Further, mucous cells have not been observed to incorporate 3H thymidine during the period of rapid mucous cell increase following cigarette smoke exposure. 16 In the absence of mucous cell mitosis (as reflected by lack ofDNA synthesis), it seems likely that the observed increases in mucin mRNA reflect environmental stimulation of mucin gene transcription, possibly an early event in mucous cell differentiation and hypersecretion.",

            "text": "Based on this interpretation, we are now attempting to obtain rat airway mucin cDNAs and genomic clones containing the mucin promoter. Screening a cDNA library made from the airway RNA of rats infected with Sendai virus and exposed to S02, we have isolated several candidate clones. Clones RAM-3 and RAM-7 contain inserts encoding threonine-rich polypeptides. RAM-7 encodes threonine/isoleucine repeats. 27 Both cDNAs hybridize to airway RNA from Sendai virus-infected, S02-exposed rats, but not to that from SPF rats. If further characterization confirms their identity as mucin cDNAs, we will use them to isolate genomic clones containing the mucin promoter. Transfection analysis of mutagenized genomic clones should reveal those DNA sequences responsible for upregulation and downregulation of transcription. Transcription factors activated by injury to airway epithelium may eventually be found to mediate the abrupt increases in mucin mRNA steady state we have observed. The 38 amino acid peptide, which we have named tracheal antimicrobial peptide (TAP), was isolated by a combination of size-exclusion, ion-exchange, and reverse-phase chromatographic fractionations using antimicrobial activity as a functional assa~The yield was approximately 2 J-Lglg of wet mucosa. The complete peptide sequence was determined by direct peptide sequence analysis and from a cloned cDNA. Mass spectral analysis of the isolated peptide was consistent with the sequence and indicated the participation of 6 cysteine residues in the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds. The size, basic charge, and presence of 3 intramolecular disulfide bonds are similar to, but clearly distinct from the defensins, a well characterized class of antimicrobial peptides from mammalian circulating phagocytic cells. The putative TAP precursor is predicted to be relatively small (64 amino acids), and the mature peptide resides at the extreme carboxy-terminus and is bracketed by a short putative propeptide region and an inframe stop codon. The mRNA encoding this peptide is more abundant in the respiratory mucosa than in whole lung tissue.",
