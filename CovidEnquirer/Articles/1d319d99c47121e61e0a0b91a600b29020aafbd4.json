For hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, apoptosis and other forms of cell-death have been observed in vitro and in vivo but the detailed understanding of this intricate viral-host interplay is unclear. This study examined the role played by the HCV p7 protein in the induction of cell-death. By measuring caspase-3/7 activation and cleavage of endogenous PARP, two hallmarks of apoptosis, the overexpression of p7 protein was shown to induce apoptosis in Huh7.5 cells. Furthermore, p7-induced apoptosis is caspase-dependent and involves both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Similar to the M2 protein of influenza A virus, p7-induced apoptosis is independent of its ion channel activity. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments further showed that both M2 and p7 interact with the essential autophagy protein Beclin-1. However, only the M2 protein could cause an increase in the level of LC3-II, which is an indicator of autophagic activity. Thus, although the p7 protein is functionally similar to the well-characterized M2 protein, they differ in their activation of autophagic cell-death. Taken together, these results shed more light on the relationship between the HCV p7 ion channel protein and cell-death induction in host cells.",

In fact, HCV infection is the most frequent indication for liver transplantation in developed countries (Brown, 2005) . Currently, about 130-170 million or 3% of the world population are estimated to be infected with HCV; with about 3-4 million new infections per year (WHO, 2012) . HCV has a high degree of genetic diversity, so it is classified phylogenetically into six major genotypes and several subtypes (Simmonds, 2004) . The HCV genome of \u223c9.6 kb encodes a unique open reading frame that is translated into a precursor polyprotein of \u223c3000 residues. Co-and post-translational processing of the polyprotein by both viral and cellular proteases yields three structural (core, E1 and E2), six non-structural proteins (NS2-NS5), and a small membrane ion channel protein (p7) (Lin et al., 1994) ; the protein of interest in this study.",

            "text": "The HCV p7 protein, a small (63 amino acid) hydrophobic protein located between the structural and nonstructural region of HCV, is not clearly identified as structural or nonstructural protein, although it has been shown to be a transmembrane protein (reviewed in Khaliq et al., 2011) . HCV p7 is classified as a viroporin, a group of small hydrophobic proteins encoded by a variety of RNA viruses that oligomerize to form pores (ion channels) in host-cell membranes through which viruses can enter/exit as well as contribute to virus assembly and pathology of disease by altering membrane permeability and disrupting ion homeostasis in cells (Gonzalez and Carrasco, 2003) . The precise role of p7 in the HCV life-cycle has been hard to define. However, some recent papers have implicated p7 in the assembly and release of virus particles, mostly acting in concert with other viral proteins (reviewed in Khaliq et al., 2011; Steinmann and Pietschmann, 2010) , and in a genotype-specific manner (Steinmann et al., 2007) . For example, a strain-specific tripartite relationship between core, p7 and NS2 has been reported to be responsible for modulating the subcellular localization of core (Boson et al., 2011) and NS2 (Tedbury et al., 2011) , which is independent of p7's ion channel activity. Similarly, it has been shown that mutations in the p7 protein, either singly or in combination with E2 glycoprotein enhances several-fold production of infectious virus particles in cell culture (Kim et al., 2011) . Thus, p7 unlike other viroporins such as M2 of influenza A virus and Vpu of HIV-1, is absolutely essential for HCV replication in vitro (Brohm et al., 2009; Steinmann et al., 2007) .",

            "text": "Cell death regulation is an important determinant in the survival of most viruses, therefore, many viruses encode proteins that interfere with cell death signaling pathways, skewing it in their favor . For HCV, both proapoptotic and prosurvival properties have been attributed to different HCV proteins (reviewed in Aweya and Tan, 2011; Fischer et al., 2007) . HCV p7 like other members of the viroporins (e.g., HIV-1 Vpu, human Tcell lymphotropic virus-1 p13II, hepatitis B virus X protein, and influenza virus PB1 ORF2), might be targeted to the mitochondrial membranes where it modulates apoptosis by altering the mitochondrial membrane permeability. However, there is currently limited information on the apoptotic activity of p7 except that reported by Madan et al. (2008) who demonstrated that the p7 protein of genotype 1b HCV induces caspase-dependent apoptosis via the mitochondria in baby hamster kidney cells. Since the genotype 2a JFH1 strain is the only one that can replicate efficiently in permissive cells, such as Huh7.5 cells, without adaption, this study sought to examine how p7 protein of this strain modulates cell-death and how similar it is to the M2 ion channel protein of influenza A virus, which is a well characterized viroporin. We were able to show that HCV p7 protein induces caspase-dependent apoptosis which is independent of its ion channel activity, and although p7 protein shares a couple of functional properties with M2 protein of influenza A virus, they seem to differ in their induction of autophagic cell death.",

Similarly, the p7 mutants were generated by 2 rounds of PCR: the first round of PCR was used to generate 5 and 3 fragments of p7 containing the appropriate alanine or glutamine substitutions; these were then amplified into full-length p7 using end primers for the p7 gene and cloned into pXJ40flag vector using BamHI and XhoI sites.

The level of apoptosis induced, as measured by caspase-3/7 activity, was observed to be significantly inhibited by the pan-caspase inhibitor but not the irrelevant peptide, suggesting the involvement of a caspase-dependent pathway in p7-induced apoptosis ( Fig. 2A) . Consistently, there was only a low level of cleaved PARP, as detected by Western blot analysis, in the p7overexpressing cells treated with zVAD-fmk treated cells (Fig. 2B , middle). However, a high level of cleaved PARP was observed in the p7-overexpressing cells that were treated with zFA-fmk ( Fig. 2A , densitometry values below). To confirm the involvement of caspases in p7-induced apoptosis, the terminal uridine nick 3 endlabeling (TUNEL) assay was performed.

            "text": "Since p7 induces apoptosis via caspase-dependent pathway, the next step was to determine which of the caspase-dependent pathways are involved. To examine this, cell permeable nontoxic peptide caspase inhibitors that bind irreversibly to activated caspases and which have a short half-life (Ekert et al., 1999; Garcia-Calvo et al., 1998) and specific for different caspases, namely caspase-3 (zDEVD-fmk), caspase-8 (zIETD-fmk) and caspase-9 (zLEHD-fmk), were added to the cells 6 h post-transfection. As shown in Fig. 3A , the level of p7-induced apoptosis after about 24 h post-transfection, as reflected by the caspase-3/7 activity in the cell lysate, was significantly inhibited by all three caspase inhibitors, but not by the irrelevant peptide (zFA-fmk). However, high levels of cleaved PARP were still observed in cells treated with the caspase inhibitors despite the low caspase-3/7 activity (Fig. 3B, middle) . This could possibly be due to the cleavage of PARP by caspaseindependent events (Yang et al., 2004) and other caspases in the absence of caspase-3 or caspase-7 activation. Indeed, it has been reported that PARP can be cleaved by other proteases and proteaselike molecules as well as several caspases (Fernandes-Alnemri et al., 1995; Germain et al., 1999; Lippke et al., 1996; Malireddi et al., 2010; Muzio et al., 1996; Orth et al., 1996; Tewari et al., 1995) albeit at lower efficiency than by caspase-3 or -7. Similarly, the number of TUNEL-positive cells was not much different between cells treated with the irrelevant peptide (zFA-fmk) and the three caspase inhibitors (Fig. 4, lower panel) . One could therefore speculate that, probably because p7-induced PARP cleavage and DNA fragmentation are late apoptosis events (Collins et al., 1997; Duriez and Shah, 1997) , they could not be completely blocked when a caspase inhibitor that is specific for only one of the caspases is used. Nevertheless, our results showed that p7-induced apoptosis is indeed caspase-dependent and involves activation of both caspase-8 and -9 which are initiator caspases of the death receptor (extrinsic) and mitochondria-mediated (intrinsic) pathways, respectively, and found upstream of caspase-3/7, the executioner caspases.

Moreover, H17, located within the amino-terminal transmembrane domain of p7, has been implicated in p7's ion channel function, and has also been shown to share functional similarity with H37 of the influenza A virus M2 ion channel protein (StGelais et al., 2009 ). However, the p7 of genotype 2a has an additional H31, which is found in only a few other genotypes and thought to partly influence the gating function of p7 (Brohm et al., 2009; Montserret et al., 2010) . Thus, in order to express p7 lacking ion channel activity and to eliminate the probable influence of H31, both H17 and H31 were substituted with A to generate a double substitution mutant p7H17AH31A. Using the membrane permeabilization assay (see Section 2 for details), the overexpression of p7 resulted in the permeabilization of the cell membrane, as the translation of p7 protein was clearly inhibited in the presence of Hygromycin B (Fig. 5A, left panel) . In contrast, the overexpression of p7H17AH31A seems to have little effect on membrane permeability as the addition of Hygromycin B did not inhibit the translation of p7H17AH31A to a great extent (Fig. 5A,  right panel) .",

When these dibasic residues in p7 are substituted by A or Q, the ion channel activity of p7 is lost and the production of infectious particles is reduced (Griffin et al., 2004; Steinmann et al., 2007) . To determine if these amino acid residues are essential for the apoptotic activity of p7 protein, substitution mutants were generated in the background of genotype 2a HCV p7 protein. Using the membrane permeabilization assay, we demonstrated that these mutants lacked ion channel activity (results not shown). However, compared to the wild-type p7 protein, overexpression of the mutants had a significantly lower level of caspase-3/7 activity (Fig. 6A ). Both single and double substitution mutants were expressed at higher levels than the wild-type p7 protein, indicating that the lack of apoptosis is not a consequence of lower protein expression levels (Fig. 6B, top) . As it has been reported that these residues (R33 and R35) are important in maintaining the topology of p7 (Steinmann et al., 2007) , the mutants could not induce much apoptosis as the wild-type p7 probably because they are orientated wrongly in the host membranes.",

HCV p7 protein does not induce autophagic cell death but can interact with Beclin-1 Based on the above characterization of p7, it seems that p7, like M2 protein, can induce caspase-dependent apoptosis, but this is independent of ion channel activity. M2 has also been shown to block autophagosome fusion with lysosomes and resulting in cell death (Gannage et al., 2009) . Thus, to examine if p7 protein behaves in the same manner as M2, Huh7.5 cells were transfected with plasmids for expressing p7 and M2 and their effects on the conversion of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) from isomer I to isomer II (LC3-I to LC3-II) was analyzed using Western blot. However, M2 failed to block macroautophagy probably due to the low transfection efficiency in Huh7.5 cells (data not shown). Hence, the experiment was repeated using the highly transfectable 293FT cells (Invitrogen) which is derived from human embryonal kidney cells transformed with the SV40 large T antigen to allow very high levels of protein expression from vectors containing the SV40 origin (http://products.invitrogen.com/ivgn/product/R70007). The results showed that both p7 and M2 induce apoptosis in 293FT cells when overexpressed ( Fig. 7A and B) , which is consistent with p7 induction of apoptosis in Huh7.5 cells (see above) and M2 in BHK cells (Madan et al., 2008) . Interestingly, the levels of activated caspase-3/7 as well as cleaved PARP were much higher in the cells Fig. 4 . Detection of HCV p7 induced apoptotic cell by TUNEL assay. The DeadEnd TM Fluorometric TUNEL System from Promega Corporation (Madison, WI) was used to measure the activation of caspase-3/7 in Huh7.5 cells that were transiently transfected with empty vector or flag-tagged p7. The cells were treated with an irrelevant peptide (zFA-fmk) or caspase-3, caspase-8 and caspase-9 inhibitors (zDEVD-fmk, zIETD-fmk and zLEHD-fmk). At 24 h post transfection, the cells were fixed and permeabilized, and TUNEL assay was performed. over-expressing p7 compared to those over-expressing M2. In lane 2, the major band for M2 is \u223c20 kDa, which is the expected molecular weight, but there are also some higher molecular weight bands. These are likely to be oligomers of M2 which are resistant to boiling, 20 mM dithiothreitol, and 1% SDS (which are found in the Laemmli SDS loading buffer) as we have previously observed the same phenomenon with another transmembrane protein (Tan et al., 2007) .",

Autophagic cell death and programmed necrosis (necroptosis) are cell death mechanisms which are also important in viral infections and are thought to be exploited by viruses for their survival (Edinger and Thompson, 2004; Park et al., 2012) . There is also some crosstalk or interrelationship between the different cell death mechanisms which are exploited by some viruses for their survival in the host, as reported for influenza A virus which determines the death of its host by inducing apoptosis and blocking autophagy (Gannage et al., 2009) . With some recent studies suggesting that HCV induces caspase-independent cell death such as autophagy (reviewed in Dreux and Chisari, 2011) , it is possible that HCV, like influenza A virus, might also be exploiting the interrelationship between apoptosis and non-apoptotic cell death for its survival in the host. Incidentally, the protein of interest in this study, p7 protein, happens to share some functional relationship with influenza A virus M2 protein (Mihm et al., 2006) , so it is tempting to speculate that p7 and M2 might play similar roles in cell death modulation.",

Since the genotype 2a JFH1 strain is the only one that can replicate efficiently in permissive cells, such as Huh7.5 cells, without adaption, this study focuses on characterizing the cell death pathways activated by the p7 protein of the JFH-1 strain. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the p7 protein of genotype 2a has been shown to induce apoptosis to a similar level as that of genotype 1b p7 (Fig. 1) . As for genotype 1b p7, the result is similar to the observation by Madan et al. (2008) except that Huh7.5 cells were used in this study while BHK cells were used in the previous study. Further characterization of the apoptosis induced by the p7 protein of genotype 2a reveals that p7-induced apoptosis was efficiently blocked by a pan-caspase inhibitor as well as inhibitors specific for caspases 3, 8 or 9 (Figs. 2 and 3) . In mammalian cells, apoptosis can be induced via two major pathways; the death receptor pathway (extrinsic pathway), triggered by the binding of FasL to Fas (CD95), with caspase-8 as the initiator caspase; and the mitochondria-mediated pathway (intrinsic pathway), induced by the mitochondria in response to DNA damage, oxidative stress and viral proteins, with caspase-9 as the initiator caspase (Kumar, 2007) . Thus, our results confirm that p7induced apoptosis is indeed caspase-dependent and involves both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways.",

Although, details and the exact function of most ion channels in apoptosis mediation are currently unknown, it is believed that some viruses employ the control of ion channel homeostasis to promote viral persistence (Mankouri et al., 2009) . A recent study has demonstrated a relationship between ion channel activity and apoptosis by showing that the caspase-dependent apoptosis induced by the SARS-coronavirus 3a protein (which possesses ion channel activity) is abolished when its ion channel activity is blocked (Chan et al., 2009 ). In the case of p7, substitution of the two histidine residues (H17 and H31), which have been implicated in the gating function of p7 (Brohm et al., 2009; Montserret et al., 2010) , with alanine, did not reduce its apoptotic activity greatly (Fig. 5B) , although the resultant double mutant had lost most of its ion channel activity (Fig. 5A) . It thus suggests that the caspase-dependent apoptosis induced by p7 protein is independent of its ion channel function. Nevertheless, p7 has to be properly folded and maintain the correct topology in the cell membranes in order to induce apoptosis as single or double substitution of the dibasic amino acid residues R33 and R35, to glutamine (Q) in the background of genotype 2a HCV p7 protein significantly reduced the level of apoptosis induced by p7 (Fig. 6) and to function as an ion channel. This observation is in line with a previous report that mutating the dibasic motif of p7 can substantially impact on the polyprotein processing and thus distort the topology of p7 protein (Steinmann et al., 2007) .",

            "text": "Recent studies (reviewed in Eisenberg-Lerner et al., 2009; Gordy and He, 2012; Zhou et al., 2011) have shown that there seems to exist a connection between pathways that regulate autophagy and apoptosis, with a number of molecules including Bcl-2 family proteins, Beclin-1, caspase-8, caspase-9, phosphoinositide-3-kinase class I, and ceramide implicated in the control of both apoptosis and autophagy. Apart from apoptotic or caspase-dependent cell death, HCV is reported to induce non-apoptotic cell death such as autophagy (reviewed in Dreux and Chisari, 2011) . In one such report, when the autophagy machinery of HCV-infected hepatocytes was interrupted, it resulted in the induction of apoptosis (Shrivastava et al., 2011) . Thus, it is believed that HCV exploits the autophagy pathway for its propagation and survival in the host, although the biological significance of this in the lifecycle HCV is still unclear (Taguwa et al., 2011) . Similarly, the pro-apoptotic M2 ion channel protein of influenza A virus is reported to cause accumulation of autophagosomes by blocking their fusion with lysosomes which thus leads to apoptosis of the infected cells (Gannage et al., 2009 ). Since both p7 and M2 are viroporins and are known to induce caspase-dependent cell death, several experiments were therefore conducted to determine if the p7 protein behaves like M2 protein of influenza A virus. Our results showed that unlike M2, the overexpression of p7 did not significantly increase the conversion of LCI to LCII (Fig. 8) or the accumulation of GFP-LC3 puncta (Fig. 9A) suggesting that probably p7 was not involved in autophagosome maturation despite the fact that both flag-tagged M2 and p7 could interact with endogenous Beclin-1 in co-immunoprecipitation experiment (Fig. 9B) . Since a number of viral proteins including M2 have been reported to interact with Beclin-1 and thus interfere with the class III PI3K (UVRAG-Beclin-1-hVps34) complex's function in autophagosome maturation (Dai et al., 2012; He and Levine, 2010; Munz, 2011) , it is therefore tempting to speculate that probably M2 and p7 bind to different domains in the class III PI3K complex, with only M2 able to interact with and inhibit autophagosome maturation (Gannage et al., 2010) .",

            "text": "Taken together, these results indicate that HCV p7 protein induces caspase-dependent apoptosis which is independent of its ion channel activity. Although p7 and M2 share some functional properties in terms of ion channel and pro-apoptotic activity, they seem to differ in their abilities to induce autophagic cell death. Further studies are underway in our laboratory to identify residues or motifs that are responsible for the apoptosis activity of p7. The HCVcc system will then be used to generate mutant virus containing mutation(s) that abolishes p7 pro-apoptotic activity and establish the functional significance of the apoptosis activity of p7 during HCV infection. In addition, identification of these residues will allow the study of the interaction between HCV p7 and other viral and host factors in cell death signaling during an infection.",
