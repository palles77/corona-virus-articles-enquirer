It contains nutrients like carbohydrates, protein, fat, vitamins, and minerals, which provide nutritional support for the growth and maintenance of an organism. On the other hand, it is also a major cause for the ill health of people around the globe, as it acts as a common transmission route of diseases due to the presence of microorganisms and contaminants (Odeyemi and Sani, 2016) . Food supports the growth of microorganisms, and sometimes it contains antinutritional components and toxins that a plant or animal produce for self-defense from which these foods are obtained (Adams and Moss, 2008) . Microorganisms causing food-borne illness are found in a wide range of foods with various virulence factors and may illicit a diverse range of adverse responses that may be acute, chronic, or intermittent. Some microbial pathogens are invasive and may cause generalized infection; other pathogens produce toxins that cause severe damage in susceptible tissues and organs. The complications normally require medical care and frequently result sometimes in hospitalizations. There may be a risk of mortality, as not all the patients recover fully and may suffer from residual symptoms throughout life (Forsythe, 2002) .",

In England and Wales, the medical costs and value of lives lost due to just five food-borne illnesses were estimated to be d300\u00c0700 million per year (Roberts, 1996) . In 1999 the cost of food poisoning in Australia was estimated to be $2.6 billion per year by ANZFA (The Australia New Zealand Food Authority) and in Canada is US$ 1.3 billion per year (Todd, 1989) .

Flagella are peritrichous in position and form central or subterminal oval spores. Serologically, C. botulinum is classified into seven different serotypes (A\u00c0G). They produce eight different toxins recognized as A, B, C 1 , C 2 , D, E, F, and G; all are neurotoxins except C 2 . Among all outbreaks of botulism, most of them are associated with fish and seafood products. Botulism in animals is predominantly associated with types C and D and rarely with types A and B. On the basis of physiological diversity within species, C. botulinum are divided into four groups (Table 12 .1). Members of group I are proteolytic, members of group II are nonproteolytic and can grow and produce toxin at refrigerated temperature (i.e., 3 C). Group III members produce toxin types C and D, and group IV produce serological type G toxin, and some nontoxigenic clostridia are also placed in this group (Hall et al., 1985; Adams and Moss, 2008) . Botulism is widely distributed in many parts of the world, as C. botulinum is a soil saprophyte. Food storage and management habits vary in different parts of the globe, which decides the fate of botulinum toxin exposure to the human population. Outbreaks associated with consumption of toxin-containing food are common in Europe and the northern United States, while outbreaks in cattle on pastures have been reported mainly from the United States, Australia, and South Africa (Radostits et al., 2007) .",

The type C strain was found in soils of the Gulf Coast, while type D was present in alkaline soil of western parts of the United States. The hay made at a time of mouse plague has been reported to be a source of this illness in Australia. An incident took place in California where 427 out of 444 lactating Holstein cows died after feeding on feed contaminated with botulinum type C toxin from the carcass of cat. Although spores of C. botulinum are present throughout the world, most of the outbreaks of botulism have been recorded at north of the Tropic of Cancer, except in Argentina. The geographical prevalence of the disease is linked with some important observations such as home canning of fruits and vegetables in most tropical countries (Jay, 2000; Moeller et al., 2003; Radostits et al., 2007) .",

This protoxin is activated by proteolytic cleavage of 150 kDa chain linked with disulfide linkage, into 50 (light) and 100 kDa (heavy) protein chains by host proteolytic enzyme trypsin.

Salmonella may execute several mechanisms to skip acidic pH of the stomach, and reaches to the small intestine. Microflora of the intestine provide protection against colonization of pathogen to some extent, but administration of antibiotics kills normal microflora and helps the colonization of pathogen. In the intestine, salmonella uses mannose-resistant fimbriae to adhere to epithelial cells, and they are then engulfed by epithelial cells using receptor-mediated endocytosis. This is a prerequisite for pathogenicity, and it is responsible for nonphagocytic entry of pathogen into the host cell (Bryan et al., 1971; Adams and Moss, 2008) . The ruffles assist uptake of the bacterium in membrane-bound vesicles, which often coalesce. The organism replicates in these vesicles and is subsequently released from the cells (Walderhaug, 2007) . Advances in molecular techniques have revealed that a signaling molecule is synthesized on a 35\u00c040 kb region of bacterial chromosome called \"pathogenicity island,\" which is responsible for the perversion of host cell and leads to uptake of bacterium (Adams and Moss, 2008) .",

Shigella sonnei was the largest contributor (80.5%) followed by Shigella flexneri (12.6%), Shigella boydii (0.2%), and Shigella dysenteriae (0.1%) (NCEZID, 2018) .",

Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) invades epithelial cells of the colon like Shigella but does not produce toxin.

Analysis of data of the last 10 years from CDC showed that the frequency of food-borne disease outbreak due to Salmonella is very high. In the last 10 years, 35 different strains of Salmonella have caused 67 outbreaks, and a total 6214 people were affected, 1409 were hospitalized, and 16 people died. Similarly, four different strains of E. coli have killed 5 people, 843 people suffered, 324 were hospitalized in 24 outbreaks. Cyclospora cayetanensis caused 2242 cases of foodborne illness; out of them, 109 were hospitalized in 5 outbreaks. In two outbreaks of V. parahaemolyticus, 130 people were affected and 15 were hospitalized. L. monocytogenes has proven to be the most virulent bacteria, causing 14 major outbreaks in the last 10 years.

Y. enterocolitica belongs to Enterobacteriaceae, gram-negative, facultative anaerobic, catalase-positive, and oxidasenegative responsible for gastroenteritis (Vemula et al., 2012) . One hundred and fifty individuals were affected by the outbreak at Kharar town (Punjab) reported in 2009 after consuming kheer contaminated with S. enteritidis (Dikid et al., 2009 ). In the state of Madhya Pradesh (India), more than 100 children and adults were affected after consuming a snack tikki made up of potato balls fried in vegetable oil. Clinical and food samples were isolated and investigated in which S. aureus was found to be the pathogen of this outbreak (Nema et al., 2007) .

High concentration of \u03b1-solanine is unsafe for human consumption (Dalvi and Bowie, 1983; Jones, 1995) as it leads to inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, cell membrane disruption. Manifestations include itchiness in the neck region, increased sensitivity called hyperesthesia, drowsiness, stomach pain, labored breathing, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (Shibamoto and Bjeldanes, 1993) .

According to a study, about 250,000\u00c0370,000 people die every year due to ingestion of pesticides (Gunnell and Eddleston, 2003; Gunnell et al., 2007) . Study conducted during 2010\u00c014 has shown that total average annual pesticide use (kg/ha) in Japan during 2010\u00c014 was highest (18.94), followed by China (10.45), Mexico (7.87), Brazil (6.166), Germany (5.123), France (4.859), United Kingdom (4.034), United States (3.886), and India (0.261) (Zhang, 2018) . Humans and animal are exposed to pesticides in many ways, including drinking water, food, inhalation, and oral and dermal contact (EFSA, 2008) . Exposure to these pesticide mixtures may have deleterious long-lasting impacts on human health in the long term. In studies carried out in Western countries, it was observed that pesticides cause and increase intensity of neurodevelopmental abnormalities, cancer, and chronic degenerative diseases (Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2013) .",

Infection of poliomyelitis remains asymptomatic for 3\u00c05 days; after that, mild illness (abortive poliomyelitis), aseptic meningitis (nonparalytic poliomyelitis), and paralytic poliomyelitis take place. This disease has been associated with crippling deformities affecting thousands of lives throughout the world (McQuillen and McQuillen, 2005) . Most outbreaks of hepatitis A and E occur due to ingestion of fecal contaminated water and food. Hepatitis A and E viruses multiply in endothelial cells of gut and then are carried via blood to the liver. Incubation period ranges from 2 to 6 weeks. Symptoms include fever, malaise, anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. Pale yellow-colored pigment is released into body tissues and urine due to liver damage. This situation is called jaundice. Identification of the source is difficult because of the long incubation period (Adams and Moss, 2008) .

B and G refer to blue and green light emission by these compounds under ultraviolet light. Aflatoxins produced by these fungi are known to induce hepatocellular carcinoma in human and animals (Wu, 2013) . These mycotoxins induce acute aflatoxicosis; manifestation includes abdominal pain, pulmonary edema, vomiting, and fatty infiltration and necrosis of the liver. Most cases of acute aflatoxicosis in humans were reported from developing nations (Shank et al., 1971) . During the 1970s, about 97 fatal cases of aflatoxicosis were reported from western India due to consumption of heavily molded corn (Krishnamachari et al., 1975; Bhat and Krishnamachari, 1977) .",

F. verticillioides is a plant pathogen and grows universally on maize and produces ear rot. Maize is the main staple food of the Republic of Transkei in Southern Africa (southeastern region), where the frequency of human esophageal cancer is very high. Fumonisins have been implicated with esophageal cancer in the Republic of Transkei . Fumonisins are of three types, fumonisin FB 1 , FB 2, and FB 3 . FB2 and FB 3 are the cocontaminators (Wu, 2013) . Fumonisins resembles sphingosin; it consists of 20 carbon aliphatic chains with two ester-linked hydrophilic side chains. Toxicity of fumonisins can be explained on the basis of its competition with sphingosin in sphingolipid metabolism (Riley et al., 1996) .",

These fungi are pathogens of cereal crops worldwide and produce zearalenone as a side product of cell metabolism (Bennett and Klich, 2003) . Chemically, zearalenone ( Fig. 12.5B ) is resorcyclic acid lactone described as 6-(10-hydroxy-6-oxo-trans-1-undecenyl)-B-resorcyclic acid lactone (Cheeke, 1998) . This toxin produces estrogenic effects on farm animals (Schwarzer, 2009) . Clinical symptoms include increased uterine size and secretions, swelling of the vulva, hyperplasia of mammary glands and secretion, increased incidences of pseudopregnancy, decreased libido, infertility, stillbirth, and complications of vaginal and rectal prolapses (Gupta et al., 2018) . In humans, studies reported that zearalenone acts as a ligand for pregnane X receptor (hPXR), which activate transcription factors involved in the expression of many hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes, including cytochrome P450 enzymes (Ding et al., 2006) . In vitro studies carried out with different human cell lines revealed the effect of zearalenone on human estrogen and androgen receptors. Zearalenone found agonist in MCF-7 cells (breast cancer cell line) for estrogen receptor alpha (hER\u03b1) and antagonist for androgen receptor (hAR) in PALM cell line (Gupta et al., 2018) .",

Infection of liver fluke is a food-borne trematodiases, and its transmission takes place through contaminated undercooked aquatic food. Infection of liver fluke is most prevalent in Southeast Asia and Latin America. International travel, human migration, and food trade pose the threat of spreading infection to the other parts of the world.

The rapid globalization and ease of transportation of food across the countries are often the cause of spread of food-borne pathogens from one part to the world to another. To deal with food-borne illnesses, it is necessary rather mandatory to regulate the process of food from \"farm to fork\" with stringent hygienic practices. There are agencies in every country vis-\u00e0-vis international agencies, which have framed regulations and laws in this concern that need to be strictly implemented by the regulatory bodies and observed by the food producers, processors, and traders to reduce the spread of food-borne illnesses.

In addition, the rise in international trade in food has augmented the risk of transmission of food contaminants from one country to another, and the need to estimate the risk that infectious agents pose to human health has become crucial. Global emergence and reemergence of food-borne pathogens have made microbiological safety of food an important issue (Odeyemi and Sani, 2016) . Globally, more than 250 sources of food-borne diseases have been identified. The increase in the incidence of food-borne diseases has led to the imposition of several food quality regulations in different countries (Scallan et al., 2011) . Although the globalization and liberalization of world food trade offer many benefits and opportunities, these present new risks of microbial pathogen from the original point of processing and packaging to the consumers' locations thousands of miles away because of the global nature of food production, manufacturing, and marketing to spread. Most of the countries have introduced food control systems to ensure that foods are safe for human consumption so that people are protected against unsafe, adulterated, or poor-quality food (Gauthier and Mahabir, 2012) .

Food laws mainly contain a basic food act and regulations, sometimes food standards, lists of food additives, chemical tolerances, and others are also included in the basic food laws. The act itself sets out principles, while regulations contain various categories of products coming under the sovereignty. Food standards are components of the enforcement structure and are meant to implement the basic food laws as part of the regulation or separate enactments. The basic food laws should include the purposes and scope of the law, definitions of basic concepts, inspection and analytical procedures, enforcement, regulations for additives, pesticides, contaminants, and penalties.

The risk assessment according to the CAC is a scientifically based process with hazard identification and characterization, exposure assessment, and risk characterization (FAO/WHO, 2003) . It provides an estimate of the possibility and severity of food-borne illnesses that is useful in determining hazards and their reduction to acceptable levels. The risk assessments and safety evaluations are dependent on available best scientific information, systemizing inputs from many authorities and publications (WHO, 2015; FAO/WHO, 2006a ,b, 2015 FAO, 2016) . At present, there are the following international scientific committees that provide advice to Codex, governments, industries, and researchers worldwide: The JECFA is an international expert scientific committee that is organized jointly by FAO/WHO and was established in 1956, primarily to assess the security of food additives. Now its function also includes assessment of food safety, naturally occurring toxicants, contaminants, and residues of veterinary drugs in foodstuff (FAO/WHO, 2003; FAO, 2005) . The committee establishes acceptable daily intakes (ADIs), prepares specifications on purity of food additives, recommends maximum residue limits (MRLs), and decides norms for detecting and quantifying residues in foods. JECFA has evaluated more than 1300 food additives with 17 maximum levels (MLs) for contaminants over 4037 MLs covering 303 food additives, and MRLs for residues of veterinary drugs is 610, covering 75 veterinary drugs in foods (FAO/WTO, 2017). As on today, it has evaluated more than 2500 food additives, 40 contaminants, and residues of 90 veterinary drugs (http://www.fao.org/food/ food-safety-quality/scientific-advice/jecfa/en/). It serves as a scientific advisory body to FAO, WHO, CAC, and some nations use its particulars in framing their own regulations and standards. Mainly information to the Codex is furnished by the Codex Committee on Food Additives and Contaminants (CCFAC) and the Codex Committee on Residues of Veterinary Drugs in Foods (CCRVDF) (Forsythe, 2002; FAO, 2005; FAO/WHO, 2015) .",

For the preparation of standard proposed, initially the Commission considers and reviews the project document and makes a decision whether the proposed standard should be developed, and then the Commission Secretariat may arrange and circulate the proposed draft standard to member governments, observer organizations, and other Codex committees for two rounds of comments and specific advice. It may take several years to develop standards.

The TBT agreement includes all types of standards covering quality requirements for foods and put emphasis on international standards. It also includes all measures designed to protect the consumers against fraud and deception (Forsythe, 2002; FAO/WHO, 2002; Masson-Matthee, 2007) . Because of WTO, TBT and SPS agreement the Codex Alimentarius standards have become the baseline references for consumer protection vis-\u00e0-vis safe food production. Hence, the CAC has become the important baseline for the international as well as national food safety requirements. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) decision on SPS states that no member countries are prevented from adopting and enforcing measures required to protect humans, animals, and plant health (GATT, 1994) .",

WTO members negotiate and supervise the implementation of rules under trade agreements and examine the trade plans of its members (Acharya, 2016; WTO, 2010) .

At the time of the GATT, the WTO was on ordinary customs duties (tariffs); today, it also includes all other measures that affect trade internationally.

ISO 22000 specifies the requirements for implementing food safety management systems in all types of organizations along the food chain, ranging from production transport and storage to producers of equipment, packaging material, and additives. It has been placed with ISO 9001 in order to increase the conformity of the two standards. It combines the concepts of the hazard analysis and critical control points (HACCP) and the CAC (FAO/WHO, 2003) . ISO is also developing additional standards that are related to ISO 22000. These standards are known as the ISO 22000 family of standards. The new standards are developed by authorities from the food industries along with specialized international agencies and in cooperation with Codex, systemize relevant national and international food laws, and integrate HACCP principles (Gauthier and Mahabir, 2012 , https://www.iso.org/iso-22000-food-safety-management. html).",

In spite of significant advances in food science and technology, food-borne diseases and illness are the rising cause of mortality and morbidity in many countries. Although a number of food-borne pathogens from different groups have been identified, still there is lack of accurate data on the full extent and cost of food-borne diseases that has been a major obstacle to address food safety issues. In order to fill this gap, different local and international regulatory bodies, standards, and laws are available that comply with safety and regulatory requirements related to food products. These provide the framework for uniformity of quality and safety of food products and thus help in improving the efficiency of production and reduction in the cost and also open borders for the free transport of food products around the globe. A number of challenges including changes in environmental conditions that lead to food contamination, changes in food production and supply, changes in consumer preference and habits, and emergence of newer pathogens, toxins, and antibiotic resistance still exist that need to be taken care of. The challenges for food regulators are to maintain a food regulatory system that delivers safe food for the people and also to maintain public confidence in the food regulations.",
