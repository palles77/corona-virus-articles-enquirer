Historically, cytologic techniques, histopathologic techniques, and microbiological cultures are used for the demonstration of the presence of the organism and serologic antibody titers for the demonstration of immune response to an infection. However, these techniques have inherent deficiencies. Cytologic and histopathologic techniques require the organism to be large enough to be seen microscopically and in sufficient numbers for visualization. The sensitivity of organism visualization for diagnosis often decreases as disease progresses because the host's immune response decreases the number of organisms in the body. Microbiological culture requires specific knowledge of the organism's requirements for growth and may require specific handling for organism preservation and culture periods longer than are clinically useful. Immune response to an organism, as demonstrated by serum antibody titers, can be sensitive but requires days to weeks for a host response and demonstrates only exposure to the organism and not the disease secondary to the organism or even the current infection.",

Because most veterinarians rely on the proper use of molecular assays on a daily basis to practice high-quality veterinary medicine, this article provides a brief overview of the technologies available, their shortcomings and advantages, and the current clinical applications of the technologies in feline medicine.",

This probe is then added directly to a clinical sample, either a fluid or tissue section. Multiple probes, with different fluorescent tags, can be added to a single sample, allowing for the detection of several organisms in a single assay. This technique of hybridization of a probe to a target sequence in an organism was one of the first applied techniques in human clinical medicine but has not gained widespread use in feline medicine. This technique is still used routinely to monitor the viral load in patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus undergoing antiviral therapy. The feline therapeutic correlate, treatment of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), has not advanced to as finely tuned a protocol. Probe hybridization is rapid, user friendly, and simple to perform. This technique also removes the need for specialized culture conditions, but sensitivity of this technique is poor compared with other molecular techniques. Prior enrichment of the sample via microbiological culture improves sensitivity but increases the time needed for the assay and requires knowledge of the microbiological cultural demands of the organisms, eliminating many of the advantages of the technique for clinical application. This technique remains useful for the detection of slow-growing organisms, such as fungi and mycobacteria, in the presence of other more rapidly growing organisms in culture and for the rapid quantification of the organism load in a nonenriched clinical sample.",

In situ hybridization allows the user to determine if certain bacterial species are associated with inflammation or are beyond the superficial layers of the gastrointestinal tract. Fluorescent molecules are the most common signaling mechanism used, and in this case, the method is abbreviated FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization).

This powerful tool uses the cyclic amplification of a strand of DNA using a proprietary enzyme to produce an exponential number of identical copies to a detectable level (Fig. 1A) . The DNA is then analyzed, usually on a gel, to determine if it is of the predicted size for the reaction (see Fig. 1B ). Application of this technique allows for the detection of minute numbers of organisms in a very small sample, an advantage in feline medicine given the size of patients. PCR is superior to probe hybridization techniques in sensitivity because of this amplification. Although the exponential amplification of the original target provides the greatest advantage of this technique, it is also the basis of the greatest downfall, contamination. Initially, PCR was restricted to highly specialized research and diagnostic laboratories. Commercially available kit-based ) is then visualized using gel electrophoresis.

Quantification by traditional endpoint PCR is difficult because after so many amplification cycles, most samples yield essentially the same amount of product because some limiting reagent would have been completely consumed before the final amplification cycles. In 1992, Higuchi and colleagues 5 reported a technique for monitoring the production of DNA during each amplification cycle so that the original quantity could be extrapolated by the identification of the logarithmic amplification phase of each individual reaction. This technique uses fluorescent dyes or probes that produce a signal after formation of the product (Fig. 2) . During each amplification cycle, a detector records the amount of fluorescence in the sample. Gene expression is commonly measured using qPCR and has been used in many disease states in felines to evaluate host response to an infection. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Pathogen detection and load determination are some of the many applications of this technology. This assay has all the advantages of traditional endpoint PCR (sensitivity, specificity), offers a more rapid result, and has the ability to quantitate microbial DNA or RNA load. However, with these improvements additional concerns regarding quality control have been added. The fluorescent dyes and probes used to detect the PCR product allows for even more sensitive assays and susceptibility to contamination leading to false-positive results. Accuracy of quantitation is reliant on the availability of a reproducible high-quality standard curve. In an attempt to regulate this rapidly expanding field, minimum laboratory standards have been proposed. 13 Although these guidelines can be used to evaluate the quality of a published protocol, many diagnostic laboratories use proprietary reactions that are not subject to peer review. But because of this practice, the practitioner needs to request the evaluation data from the diagnostic laboratory to evaluate the clinical utility of the assay until it has been evaluated in a peer-reviewed journal.",

It is anticipated that many more applications will be developed in the upcoming years, and it is the responsibility of the clinician to maintain the knowledge of the current literature to apply these new assays in an appropriate manner. Molecular assays simply indicate the presence of a microbial DNA or RNA and not that of the disease. The ability of an assay to detect an organism is measured by its sensitivity and specificity: the frequency at which an assay can detect an organism (sensitivity) and not other organisms (specificity). The true measure of a test for disease diagnosis is the predictive value. Positive predictive value (PPV) is the measure of a test's ability to predict the presence of disease, and negative predictive value (NPV) is the ability of an assay to predict the absence of disease. However, most diagnostic laboratories can report only sensitivity and specificity because they are easier to calculate, and hence the onus of remembering the predictive values of an assay for the syndrome being assessed is on the clinician.",

            "text": "Although Cryptosporidium spp infection is common, it is unusual to find Cryptosporidium felis oocysts using fecal flotation in cats. Acid-fast staining of a thin fecal smear is cumbersome and insensitive. Antigen assays titrated for use with human feces are inaccurate when used with cat feces. Thus, PCR may aid in the diagnosis of cryptosporidiosis in dogs and cats and has been shown to be more sensitive than immunofluorescence assays (IFAs) in cats. 19 Cryptosporidium spp PCR assays are indicated in IFA-negative cats with unexplained small bowel diarrhea and when the genotype of Cryptosporidium is to be determined. However, Cryptosporidium felis infection in cats is common, and so positive test results do not always prove that Cryptosporidium felis is the cause of the clinical disease. No drug is known to eliminate Cryptosporidium spp infections and small animal strains are not considered significant zoonotic agents; so PCR is not currently indicated in healthy animals. PCR assays are also available for the detection of DNA of Tritrichomonas foetus, Salmonella spp, Campylobacter spp, Clostridium spp, parvoviruses, and T gondii, and RT-PCR assay is available for coronaviruses. Trophozoites of T foetus can often be detected on wetmount examination of fresh feces, which can be completed as an in-clinic test. The DNA of T foetus can be detected in healthy carrier cats, and so positive test results do not always prove illness from the organism. 20 In cases with suspected salmonellosis or campylobacteriosis, assessment should be done by culture rather than by PCR to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. In dogs, the PPV of Clostridium spp PCR assays on feces is low, and if the assay is used, it should be combined with enterotoxin assays. Information in cats is currently lacking. At present, there is noevidence that parvovirus PCR assays on feces is superior to currently available antigen assays and that currently used PCR assays for panleukopenia virus amplify vaccine strains. Oocysts of T gondii are shed only for about 7 to 10 days, and millions of oocysts are generally shed during this period, making the organism very easy to identify. Thus, PCR assays are usually not needed to diagnose this infection. Because virus isolation is not clinically practical, RT-PCR is used most frequently to detect coronavirus RNA in feces. However, positive test results do not differentiate feline infectious peritonitis (FIP)-inducing strains from enteric coronaviruses.",

In at least 2 studies of experimentally infected cats, Mhf was found to be apparently more pathogenic than Mhm. It seems that Mtc has intermediate pathogenicity. Diagnosis is based on demonstration of the organism on the surface of erythrocytes on examination of a thin blood film or PCR assay. The number of organisms fluctuates, and so blood film examination results can be false negative up to 50% of the time. It may be difficult to find the agent cytologically, particularly in the chronic phase. Thus, PCR assays are the tests of choice because of their sensitivity. 21 Primers that can amplify the DNA of all the 3 hemoplasmas are available. qPCR assays can be used to monitor copy numbers during and after treatment but do not have greater sensitivity, specificity, or predictive value than conventional PCR assays. 22 PCR assays should be considered in the evaluation of cats with unexplained fever or anemia and that are cytologically negative for the hemoplasmas. In addition, the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine recommends screening cats for hemoplasmas by PCR assays for their use as blood donors. 23 Many cats are carriers of the relatively nonpathogenic Candidatus Mhm, and so positive test results may not always correlate to the presence of the disease (poor PPV).",

However, bacteremia can be intermittent and false-negative culture or PCR results can occur, limiting the predictive value of a single battery of tests. Although serologic testing can be used to determine whether an individual cat has been exposed, both seropositive and seronegative cats can be bacteremic, limiting the diagnostic utility of serologic testing. Thus, testing healthy cats for Bartonella spp infection is not recommended at present. 28 Testing should be reserved for cats with suspected clinical bartonellosis. Because Bartonella spp infection is so common in healthy cats, even culture-or PCR-positive results do not prove clinical bartonellosis. For example, although DNA of Bartonella spp was detected in more number of cats with fever than in pair-matched cats without fever, the test results in healthy cats were still commonly positive. 29 A combination of serology and PCR is a rational approach to the evaluation of cats with suspected bartonellosis.",

Comparisons between different tests have shown that the results of most assays are comparable. 31 Results of virus isolation or RT-PCR on blood are positive in some serologically negative cats. False-positive reactions can occur using ELISA; hence, positive results of ELISA in healthy or lowrisk cats should be confirmed using Western blot immunoassay. Kittens can have detectable colostrum-derived antibodies for several months. Kittens younger than 6 months that are FIV seropositive should be tested every 60 days until the result is negative. If antibodies persist at 6 months of age, the kitten is likely infected. Virus isolation or RT-PCR on blood can also be performed to confirm infection.

At each step, fluorescence is measured, allowing for the extrapolation of the amount of product present during each replication phase.
