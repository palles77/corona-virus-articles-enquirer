It was observed that the substitution of fl-cyclodextrins with galactose end arms induces the better recognition by a cell-linked galactose-specific lectin. The physicochemical effects of the fl-CD derivatives on membranes were estimated using red blood cells and the effects on the viability of yeast and human rectal tumor ceils were appreciated by measuring the mitochondrial deshydrogenase activity. The substitutions of the fl-CD ring by sugar antennae decrease the negative physicochemical effects of the fl-CD, ie their hemolytic properties. However, these substitutions induce significant modifications of the biological properties of the molecules, particularly the cytotoxicity and the growth of eukaryotic cells.",

Therefore it appeared necessary to test the effect of these carrier molecules on such cells.Tumour cells can be resistant to a variety of chemotherapeutic drugs of different structures (multidrug resistance or MDR) by expressing a transmembrane P-glycoprotein (P-gp) on their cell surface. Colon and renal tumors are relatively refractory to chemotherapy and are known to express Pgp. Drug carrier systems are widely studied to circumvent this obstacle [13] .
