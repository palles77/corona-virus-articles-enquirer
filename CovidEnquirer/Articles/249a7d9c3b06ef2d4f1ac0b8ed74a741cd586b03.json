Infection of the rat CNS, before weaning, may result in development of an acute, fatal encephalitis or a slowly progressive, chronic and sometimes remitting, paralytic disease characterized by foci of demyelination (Nagashima et uL, 1978; Sorensen et uL, 1980) . Immunohistopathologic analysis of rat CNS from animals undergoing the chronic type of disease reveals that JHMV infects neurons and oligodendrocytes (Nagashima et al, 1978; Sorensen et ak, 1984) . Since, however, in the rat intracerebral (IC) inoculation of MHV3 can result in virus replication without overt symptoms of disease (Hirano et aL, 1980) , there is an implication that this serotype is tropic for cells other than neurons and oligodendrocytes.",

We, therefore, undertook to study the replication and tropisms of CV, utilizing such a simplified CNS system so as to be able to control more precisely the parameters relevant to cell-virus interactions. This enabled us to define, with greater certainty, the tropisms of the virus serotypes, MHV3 and JHMV, for different neural cells. Furthermore, the age-dependent loss of infectability in young rats could now be examined in relation to the continuing, time-related in vitro program of differention occurring in neural cells explanted from newborn animals (Abney et aL, 1981; Pfeiffer et al., 1981; McMorris, 1983) .",

Inoculation with MHV3 of the astrocytes resulted in formation of infectious particles which simulated that described in the case of mixed cultures ( Fig. 2A) . Thus, cultures seeded at 5 X lo5 cells/cm' produced a maximum of approximately lo6 PFU/ml, those seeded at 2 X lo5 cells/cm2 approximately lo3 to lo6 PFU/ml and those at lo5 cells/cm' or less only about lo2 to lo4 PFU/ml depending on the m.o.i. used to initiate infection. Evidently the yields, in terms of plaqueforming units/cell, were not in direct proportion to the cell number but were related to the space between cells. Furthermore, the rapidity of the CPE manifested was also directly related to cell density, being detectable earlier and with greater frequency in the denser cultures. Identity of the cdl type in shaken cultures replicating JHMV. Once it had been established that JHMV could persistently infect shaken cultures it was essential to ascertain whether these cells were, indeed, oligodendrocytes. For this purpose, indirect immunolabeling was carried out to associate the presence of viral antigen(s) with markers for the oligodendrocytes. Characterization of living oligodendrocytes was conducted employing monospecific R > GC antisera (Raff et aL, 1978) . It was observed that the majority, over 70%, of the cells were GC positive and, therefore, oligodendrocytes (not shown). For correlating presence of oligodendrocyte-specific and viral antigens within the same cells, fixation and permeation with acetone permitted simultaneous labeling with two specific antisera and different fluorochromes. The oligodendrocyte-specific cytoplasmic antigen, myelin basic protein (MBP), was detected with R > MBP monospecific serum. JHMV antigen(s) were detected by polyclonal antibodies raised in mice, as described under Materials and Methods. The data, illustrated in Figs. 3B, C revealed conclusively that MBP and viral antigens coexisted when the oligodendrocyte cultures were established at medium cell density and examined 20 days postexplantation and 10 days after infection. When oligodendrocytes were seeded at low cell density and examined at 10 days postexplantation and 2 days after inoculation, virus antigen occurred with equal frequency within cells that were either MBP positive or negative (Figs. 3E, F) . This implies that younger cultures contained fewer cells with MBP, consistent with Barbarese et aL (1981) who showed MBP to be a differentiation marker for oligodendrocytes in vitro.",

A summary of the data, in Table  3 , clearly shows that this treatment suppressed virus production, whereas in the appropriate controls virus formation persisted. When checked at 3 and 5 days following immune lysis, the oligodendrocyte cultures did not resume JHMV production. Additional controls, using astrocytes infected with MHV3 and JHMV chronically infected LMTK-cells (Mizzen et aL, 1983) , showed that R > GC antibody and complement did not suppress the infections.

To ascertain whether oligodendrocyte differentiation also influenced virus replication, oligodendrocytes were assayed for CNPase and challenged with JHMV at intervals following explantation. Data, summarized in Table 4 show that enzyme induction was maximal by the 15th day and remained at a high level beyond the 21st day, in general agreement with results reported previously (Sprinkle et al, 1978; McMorris, 1983) . JHMV replication was reproducibly suppressed sometime between the 15th and 21st days. With VSV, by contrast, there was no evidence of an age-related inhibition of replication. Another approach for testing the relationship between differentiation and JHMV production was to treat oligodendrocytes with dbcAMP either 48 hr prior to or following inoculation. The data, summarized in Table 5 , revealed that cultures treated 48 hr prior to inoculation failed to replicate the virus, whereas cultures treated after inoculation continued to produce progeny. Data, presented in Table 6 , reveal that both 1 mM dbcAMP and '7 pM papaverine (the latter being an inhibitor of CAMP phosphodiesterase which indirectly causes the accumulation of intracellular CAMP), were effective in repressing JHMV formation in oligodendrocytes seeded at medium density. It may be highly significant that cell density has a profound influence on the efficacy of dbcAMP.Thus, unlike medium density cultures, cells seeded at the high density were unaffected by 1 mM dbcAMP but were influenced by 5 and 10 n&f dbcAMP with respect to suppression of virus replication (Table 6) .",

The closely parallel, age-related, inducibility of disease in animals and infectability of freshly explanted oligodendrocytes by the neurotropic agent JHMV, reported here, is remarkable. This suggests that the in vitro tropism of this virus strain reflects accurately its propensity for cells of the CNS in the rat. Furthermore, the idea that JHMV has specific tropism for the oligodendrocytes is supported by data derived from an application of molecular probes and immunopathology to CNS samples from afflicted or asymptomatic animals (Sorensen et d, 1984) . Therefore, it is very likely that progress of the chronic, demyelinating disease is related to infection of the oligodendrocyte. One might also presume that tropism of MHV3 for astrocytes, causing a persistent in vitro infection, does not lead to development of an overt CNS disease in the rat because the astrocyte, by virtue of its proliferative capacity, is not eliminated from the CNS as a critical, functional, component.",

Moreover, with both types of cultures production of infectious virus is profoundly inhibited or entirely suppressed at elevated temperatures, approximately 39.5\". Analogous data have been obtained with other neurotropic agents, among them measles and HVJ (Lucas et aL, 1978; Ogura et aL, 1984) . Evidently, similar host cell control over virus production is exerted by primary neural cells, suggesting that the efficiency of virus replication and spread within the CNS may be under close control of the host. It is noteworthy that JHMV replication in explanted oligodendrocytes is influenced more profoundly by cell density than by the m.o.i. employed, implying that cell-cell contacts impart a fundamental influence upon the spread of virus and maintenance of persistence. Thus, in sparsely seeded cultures, where cell contacts are infrequent or absent, virus production is low and transient. By comparison, with greater density, permitting frequent cell-cell contacts, the infection is characterized by development of syncytia and prolonged, persistent release of JHMV, sometimes to titers as much as 4 logslo greater than those produced by cells in sparse cultures.",

With this in mind it should be noted that rat oligodendrocytes in vitro exhibit an age-related control over the infection, perhaps as a consequence of the differentiation process. In this connection, there is evidence to show that in neonatal and embryonic cultures from rat brain, certain characteristics of differentiation, such as the induction of MBP Pfeiffer et al, 1981) and CNPase McMorris, 1983) , appear on schedule during development as regulated by the in vitro \"time clock\" period. The consequence of differentiation on virus replication in neural cells, whether on the positive or negative side, has also been documented for other neurotropic agents, among them MV and rubella virus (Miller et d, 1982; Van Alstyne et cd, 1983 ). It may not be a mere coincidence that the maximal increase in CNPase occurs both in tivo and in vitro at about 15-20 days postpartum (Sprinkle et al, 19'78; McMorris, 1983) , closely coincident with the time period at which rats become insusceptible to disease produced by JHMV; the key factor in regulation of infectability of oligodendrocytes could be their state of differentiation with respect to the elaboration of myelin. This notion is supported by our experiments concerned with elevation of intracellular CAMP, either directly or by inducers, since the intracellular concentrations of this metabolite in neural cells is closely related to induction of terminal functions in the differentiation process (Gilman et c& 1971; Ruben et a& 1975; Greengard, 1978; Miller et cd, 1982) .",
