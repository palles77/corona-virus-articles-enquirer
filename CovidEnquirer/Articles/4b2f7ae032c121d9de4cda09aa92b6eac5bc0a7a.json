We reviewed the existing literature from 2007 to April 2013 and expert opinions about clinician engagement and education for critical care during a pandemic or disaster and off er suggestions for integrating ICU clinicians into planning and response. Th e suggestions in this article are important for all of those involved in a pandemic or large-scale disaster with multiple critically ill or injured patients, including front-line clinicians, hospital administrators, and public health or government offi cials.",

            "text": "A systematic literature review was performed and suggestions formulated according to the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) Consensus Statement development methodology. We assessed articles, documents, reports, and gray literature reported since 2007. Following expert-informed sorting and review of the literature, key priority areas and questions were developed. No studies of suffi cient quality were identifi ed upon which to make evidence-based recommendations. Th erefore, the panel developed expert opinion-based suggestions using a modifi ed Delphi process. RESULTS: Twenty-three suggestions were formulated based on literature-informed consensus opinion. Th ese suggestions are grouped according to the following thematic elements: (1) situational awareness, (2) clinician roles and responsibilities, (3) education, and (4) community engagement. Together, these four elements are considered to form the basis for eff ective ICU clinician engagement for mass critical care. CONCLUSIONS: Th e optimal engagement of the ICU clinical team in caring for large numbers of critically ill patients due to a pandemic or disaster will require a departure from the routine independent systems operating in hospitals. An eff ective response will require robust information systems; coordination among clinicians, hospitals, and governmental organizations; pre-event engagement of relevant stakeholders; and standardized core competencies for the education and training of critical care clinicians.

In the event of resource scarcities and excess demands, access to care will be restricted, and the level of care will be altered (see \"Surge Capacity Principles\" article by Hick et al 1 in this consensus statement ). Overall, this involves a shift from individual patient-based medicine to population-based medicine. Th e requirement to restrict and alter standards of medical care inherent in the shift to population-based medicine is perhaps one of the most challenging transitions for clinicians to make in delivering critical care to an overwhelming number of patients.

Do cultural diff erences indicate a need for diff erent methods of disaster education for the public? What types of education are the most suitable to prepare for future pandemics and disasters? Is disaster education able to motivate clinicians to undertake specifi c preparedness activities vs experiencing a disaster? Conclusions Engagement of clinicians, administrators, and the public prior to a pandemic or disaster is an important aspect of preparedness so that there is an improved understanding of resources, triage priorities, and situational awareness. Failure to address these issues poses a risk for preventable morbidity and mortality and is just as important as the \"space, staff , and stuff \" that are the logistical portion of usual pandemic and disaster preparedness activities. We also need to improve our understanding of engagement gaps and commit to addressing these for future pandemic and disaster preparedness in health-care systems.",
