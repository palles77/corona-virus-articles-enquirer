The elimination of infectious agents which act as undefined experimental factors has attracted much attention over the last decades. There is no difference between the use of animal models for antimicrobial research and other kinds of animal research. However, it should be obvious that if animals are to be used as reliable tools for experimental infection, spontaneous infections should not be allowed to interfere. Therefore, microbiologists should feel a special obligation to define the health of their laboratory animals. In this chapter some examples will be given of how poor health status may interfere with animal models for antimicrobial research, and precautions to avoid such interference will be described.",

Examples of infectious agents which are of importance for antimicrobial animal models are listed in Tables 6.1-6.3. Some of these may cause disease in laboratory animals, and such disease might interfere with research. However, if animals are clinically ill, they are seldom used for experiments, and therefore research interference is more to be feared from those complications which are not clinically observable. Some microorganisms only have the ability to influence the animal temporarily, while others act through a long period of the animal's life, maybe lifelong. The impact on animal models in antimicrobial chemotherapy differs between different viruses. Clinically apparent viral disease is seldom seen in laboratory animals, while all viruses may have an impact on the immune system and may contaminate biological products sampled from animals. The strains listed are examples. Several viruses which may infect the species included are not given here as they are less common. A comprehensive list may be found in Hansen et al. (1994) . The table does not include primates, as different primate species harbour a wide range of viruses. A comprehensive list referring to primates may be found in Working Committee for SPF and Gnotobiotic Laboratory Animals (1980). (1980) and a more detailed list for the other species may be found in Hansen et al. (1994) .",

One of the most common errors in transportation is the use of vehicles without proper ventilation, cooling or heating, which may be the cause of various grades of respiratory infection, often with opportunistic bacteria, such as Stapkylococcus spp. and Pseudomonas spp., involved. Primates are often transported long-distance by air, during which journey they are handled by untrained staff.

Therefore, it should be noted that it has recently emerged as an opportunistic parasite in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected humans (Desplazes et al., 1996) . Dermatophycoses, i.e. skin infections with Trickophyton and Microsporum spp., may occur in a wide range of laboratory animals. Cats, in which the infection is often asymptomatic, impose the highest risk for humans. The coccidium Toxoplasma gondii may also occur in a wide range of species, but its natural reservoir is in the cat, and care should be taken only to purchase cats free of this infection. In pigs the major risk seems to be development of erysipeloid after contact with pigs infected with Erysipelotkrix rkusiopatkiae, a Gram-positive rod found in most agricultural pig herds (Takahashi et al., 1987) . Non-human primates share a range of infections with humans. Although most research primates of the western world today are purpose-bred, they are in general not produced under hygienic regimes as strict as those which are applied to rodents. Therefore, primates should be regarded as a risk for human health. The most serious problem is herpesvirus type B, which in macaques produces symptoms equivalent to herpes simplex in humans, while in humans it may cause fatal encephalitis (Weigler, 1992) . The virus is present in several commercial breeding colonies. Humans bitten by seropositive monkeys should as a routine be treated with acyclovir. Hepatitis viruses of various types, especially type A, are of greatest concern, when working with chimpanzees (Friedmann et al., 1971) , although it should be noted that antibodies may be found in other primate species as well. It is, however, not clear whether these are due to viruses capable of infecting humans or just equivalent monkey strains without such a potential. Fatal filoviruses, i.e. Ebola and Marburg, are not present in commercial colonies and can simply be avoided by not purchasing wild-caught monkeys.",

Larger-scale production in isolators is, however, expensive, and therefore most laboratory animals are bred in a barrier unit, i.e. a unit where materials are decontaminated before introduction and the staff showers on the way in (Figure 6.1) . Barrier-bred animals do not have a fully known flora, but they can be kept free of some specified agents. Before being moved from isolators into the barrier unit, the animals are often given a starter flora consisting of, for example, lactobacilli and some anaerobic rods. Furthermore, they catch microorganisms of human origin from the caretakers. All this becomes \"the normal flora\" (Hansen, 1992) . Members of this flora can also interfere with some kinds of research, e.g. in immunosuppressed animals (Table 6 .4).",

All commercial vendors issue reports on the health monitoring performed in their colonies (Table 6 .6), and animals should never be purchased without first having studied such a report. Typical intervals between screening of colonies are 6-12 weeks for rodents and 6 months for larger animals such as rabbits, pigs, dogs and cats. Results of health monitoring are historical, i.e. animals may become infected in the period between two samplings, and therefore infected animals may have been used for research, before the infection has been discovered. Although the number of animals to sample for health monitoring can be judged from statistical principles (Hansen, 1993) , such statistical principles are not commonly applied in health monitoring, and therefore infections listed as \"not found\" in health-monitoring reports may be present but not found due to the use of too few animals. The typical sample size ranges from 6 to 10 animals. If this sample size is used to screen for Clostridium piliforme in rat colonies by the means of serology it would be statistically valid, while it would not be if pathology is used due to the lower sensitivity of the histopathological methods . To minimize such concerns about the microbial status of laboratory animal guidelines relating to a number of species have been published in Europe (Hem et al., 1994; Kraft et al., 1994) . These guidelines list what to test for, how often to do it and how many animals to sample. In general, it is a sound principle to ask commercial vendors for health reports issued according to these guidelines, but it should be noted that the guidelines do not ensure statistical validity (Hansen, 1996) . Animals bred behind a barrier and being currently health-monitored are sold under different terms, among which microbiologically defined seems to be the most precise ( Figure 6 .1). Rodents, rabbits, pigs, cats and dogs can be purchased as microbiologically defined at several commercial vendors all over the world.",

For quarantine housing a ventilated rac k may be used. This is a cage system where each cage can be singleventilated. In this system different deliveries may be isolated from one another; this is not possible in a common quarantine facility. Alternatively, animals may be quarantine-housed in isolators. All primates, no matter what their origin, should be quarantined for at least 30 days before entering a running primate facility. During this period the animals should be inspected for signs of clinical disease and screened for unwanted infectious agents, especially those with a zoonotic potential, such as herpesvirus type B, Salmonella spp. and Skigella spp. During quarantine experiments should not be performed on the animals.",

In recent years polymerase chain reaction has been used as a supplement to the MAP test (Yagami et al., 1995) .
