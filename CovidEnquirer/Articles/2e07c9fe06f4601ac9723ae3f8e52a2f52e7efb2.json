Previously, Asian manufacturers did not themselves market novel vaccines in Europe or the United States, choosing to distribute their innovative products, such as acellular pertussis and live attenuated varicella vaccines, through multinational companies. However, an increasing global integration is taking place, as multinational companies acquire Asian manufacturers (e.g., Sanofi-Aventis, France, acquired Shantha Biotechnics, India); Asian companies acquire or obtain technologies and distribution rights from European countries (e.g., inactivated polio vaccine by Serum Institute of India Ltd. acquiring Bilthoven Biologicals, Netherlands; Astellas, Japan, acquiring recombinant influenza hemagglutinin from Protein Sciences, U.S.; Thai Government Pharmaceutical Organization acquiring chimeric JE vaccine from Sanofi-Pasteur, France; and Biological Evans, India, acquiring JE vaccine from Intercell AG, Austria); and vaccine codevelopment is agreed between entities in developed and Asian countries (e.g., genetically modified, inactivated HIV vaccine codeveloped by Sumagen, Korea, and the University of Western Ontario, Canada; mycobacterial proteinAg85A candidate tuberculosis vaccine codeveloped by Tianjin CanSino Biotechnology, China, and McMaster University, Canada; universal influenza vaccine codeveloped by Xiamen Wantai and Sanofi-Pasteur, France; and novel pneumococcal conjugate vaccine codeveloped by SK Chemicals, Korea and Sanofi-Pasteur, France). 2, 4, 5 The role of Asian companies as developers and providers of neglected and improved vaccines for the region and, for developing countries more generally, is an emerging trend as illustrated by the joint research activity agreement between the National Research Council, Canada, and the Chinese National Biotec Group that covers development of H. influenzae type a and Hib bivalent conjugate vaccine, novel mucosal adjuvants and therapeutic vaccines against Helicobacter pylori infection, and cell culture manufacturing platforms for viral and vectored vaccines. A Korean-manufactured biosimilar (generic) biological, infliximab, now is licensed in Europe, a step toward commercial expansion of Asian region-manufactured biologicals to developed countries. The emergence of Asia as the base of new multinational vaccine companies with broad development, production, and distribution capabilities is on the horizon, even as consolidation of existing companies occurs elsewhere. [6] [7] [8] The broad income range within countries in the region results in large population segments that have sufficient means to pay for vaccines out-of-pocket. Even among countries that otherwise qualify economically for Gavi funding (e.g., India), substantial numbers of families can avail themselves of vaccines not covered by the national EPI, resulting in a two-tiered system of vaccination, paralleling the public-private dichotomy of healthcare delivery in general. Practitioners serving these and expatriate families generally follow current U.S., European, or Australian vaccine recommendations, or some modification of those schedules.",

However, since first being reported in 1957, the virus has been found in other areas of India including the Kutch and Saurashtra parts of Gujarat state, Andaman Islands and West Bengal.

The disease attack rates reported were 0.15% (14/9072) among persons receiving one dose and 0.047% (10/21,083) among recipients of two doses, respectively, compared to an attack rate of 0.870% (325/37,373) in unvaccinated persons, for vaccine efficacies of 82.4% and 94.8%, respectively. 14 The vaccine was subsequently commercialized and is produced by the state Institute of Animal Health and Veterinary Biologicals, Hebbal, Bangalore, and has been central to KFD prevention efforts in the state of Karnataka. Annual vaccinations have been done since 1990 in the Shimoga and adjacent districts wherein two doses of the vaccine were administered in individuals 7 to 65 years of age at an interval of 1 month. Periodic boosters were also administered after 6 to 9 months. However, recent observations suggest a lower field effectiveness than had been reported previously, especially following a single dose, while overall coverage has also been low. Between 2005 and 2010, effectiveness among individuals Perceptions of the value of vaccines and their risks also range widely, regionally and within individual countries, from largely enthusiastic acceptance and even demand for additional routine vaccinations (e.g., for JE vaccine in southern and Southeast Asia) to a degree of skepticism equal to, if not more deeply and widely held, than vaccine hesitancy in Europe and the United States. Within the last 20 years, Japan discontinued routine childhood vaccine programs for combination measles-mumps-rubella, influenza, and JE, and withdrew recommendations for the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine for adolescents, owing in several of instances, to incorrectly thinking that coincidental adverse events were causally related. The requirement for subcutaneous, as opposed to IM administration for all vaccines, exemplifies the misattribution of adverse reactions, arising in this case from an extrapolation of muscle contractures resulting from repeated IM administration of antibiotics, to other intramuscularly administered products, including vaccines. 9, 10 The extrapolation has had unintended consequences of impeding the licensure of vaccines with newer adjuvants with mechanisms of action that require IM administration. With the global spread of information, concerns over the thimerosal content of childhood vaccines and vaccine-associated autism have been as active a parental concern among middle-class families in developing countries as elsewhere. Parental refusal of routine JE vaccination in Korea and significant declines in vaccine coverage occurred in a different context after seven cases of temporally related cases of anaphylactic shock and neurological disease, including five deaths, occurred in 1994. The cases could not be excluded as causally related to administration of the mousebrain-derived vaccine, prompting a national debate and establishment of a vaccine adverse events reporting scheme, a national vaccine injury compensation system, and introduction of a live attenuated JE vaccine derived from a nonneural tissue substrate. 11 From this mosaic, we describe some common themes, highlighting representative approaches and unique issues that hold a wider interest. Because they are covered elsewhere in this volume, we have not reviewed specific vaccines of regional concern (e.g., pandemic influenza and JE vaccines) or vaccination topics common to developing countries (e.g., initiatives surrounding injection safety, measles and neonatal tetanus elimination, and polio eradication, nor financing mechanisms). We concentrate, instead, on other aspects of vaccine development and implementation, organized by the steps of vaccine development, approval, production, recommendation, and delivery. We also focus on childhood vaccines and vaccination and on selected countries in the region.",

Newer vaccine approaches (e.g.., chimeric or virus protein subunit vaccines) are being investigated to potentially replace the current vaccine. Elsewhere, a nearly identical strain to the KFDV was isolated from a patient suffering from acute febrile illness from Yunnan province, China in 1985. Seroprevalence studies indicate that KFDV (or the Nanjianyin virus or a related tickborne flavivirus) may be present in various parts of southwestern China. 16 In 1995 a virus similar to KFDV called Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus was isolated from patients with febrile illness in Saudi Arabia. 17 Overall, 10 cases with two deaths occurred in sheep and camel handlers exposed to a tick Ornithodoros savignyi. The disease has now been confirmed to be more widespread in the country than previously considered. 12 As tickborne diseases are \"diseases of place,\" KFD virus itself, if it spreads, is likely to disseminate locally. Nevertheless, the discovery of antigenically related viruses elsewhere, such as Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus, suggests a potential for more widespread use of KFD vaccine, depending on public health needs.",

The etiologic agent eluded investigators until 1976, when a novel bunyavirus, HTN virus was isolated from the striped field mouse, Apodemus agrarius, which proved to be the principal viral reservoir in most areas of Asia. Later, antigenically related SEO virus was isolated from Rattus rattus and Rattus norvegicus, explaining the occurrence of sporadic HFRS cases and outbreaks in urban areas.

No systemic reaction was found among 396 vaccinees and mild local reactions were observed in two (0.5%). 24 The purified, bivalent GKC vaccine was tested for protective efficacy in a nonrandomized trial among 225,576 subjects, 16 to 60 years of age; 112,143 persons received the two primary doses with an interval of 14 days and a booster dose at 6 months; 113,433 persons were unvaccinated. The two groups were similar in age distribution. During 3 years of follow-up, 22 HFRS cases were found in 337,812 person-years among the unvaccinated, a rate of 6.51 per 100,000, compared with none in the vaccinated 334,086 person-years, a reduction of 100%. 25 Several manufacturers have adapted their processes from primary gerbil or hamster cells to continuous Vero cells. The purified, bivalent Vero cell-derived vaccine administered in two doses separated by 14 days, induced neutralizing antibody against HTN virus and SEO viruses in 90.12% (73/81) and 91.35% (74/81) adult volunteers, respectively. 7 Mild systemic reactions were observed in 3.66% (12/328) and mild local reactions in 1.83% (6/328) of vaccine recipients. 26 The immunogenicity and safety profiles of the Vero cell-derived, purified bivalent vaccine were similar in children and older adults. 27 Based on the above data, a schedule of two primary doses with an interval of 14 days, plus a booster at 6 months, has been recommended for the purified bivalent GKC-, PHK-, and Vero-cell-derived vaccines.",

The vaccine's effectiveness was thus estimated at 98.06%, 88.24%, 88.54%, and 89.64%, respectively, for the four study periods. The effectiveness was underestimated because the year of onset of HFRS was unknown for 36 cases, all of whom belonged to the unvaccinated group and were not included for analysis. 10 The overall HFRS attack rate was 0.13% (24/18921) in the vaccinees and 2.18% (123/5635) in the unvaccinated subjects, a reduction of 94.04%. 28 A long-term study of the monovalent PHK-derived SEO virus vaccine also was conducted among adults 15 to 60 years old in a SEO virus-predominating area, from 1995 through 2005. 11 Only three primary doses were given at 0, 7, and 28 days without a booster. Seven HFRS cases were found in 1,467,188 subjects in the vaccine group, a rate of 0.48 per 100,000, and 412 cases were found in 6,379,278 controls, a rate of 6.46 per 100,000, with an overall reduction of 92.61% (95% CI, 87.09% to 98.13%) during the 11 years of the study. The vaccine's effectiveness was estimated at 100% for the first year, 95.56% for the second year, and 92.61% for the 11th year. The rate reductions in other years were approximately 92%. 29 A SMB-derived HTN virus vaccine also was developed in the Republic of Korea and is available for at-risk individuals. The incidence of HFRS in China and Korea has declined in the last 10 years with the introduction of vaccination and probably, more importantly, because of urbanization, rural economic development leading to improved (cement) houses, and grain harvesting and storage practices, resulting in reduced exposures to the rodent reservoir. This trend has been most evident in rapidly developing areas of southeastern China and likely will continue in other regions, leading to a diminution of disease incidence and, potentially, discontinuation of routine vaccination in endemic provinces.",

However, the 10-nation Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN; includes Brunei-Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam) in 1992 initiated efforts for a subregional regulatory harmonization scheme to reduce differences in technical requirements and regulatory procedures for pharmaceuticals. 30 A 1999 harmonization initiative, under auspices of a Pharmaceutical Product Working Group, aimed to remove barriers to regional commerce and to eliminate technical barriers to trade without compromising product quality, efficacy, and safety. Eventually, a subregional central or mutual-recognition procedure similar to that of the European Union could be envisioned. Importantly, local clinical trials are not required for registration under abbreviated pathways specified by the ASEAN Common Technical Dossier if the vaccine was approved and licensed by a benchmark regulatory agency, resulting in a certificate of pharmaceutical product. By contrast, the national regulatory authorities of China, India, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan have required local clinical trials before or after registration, and in other countries, while data in local populations may not be required for registration, those data are important in deliberations on a vaccine's inclusion in the national schedule. For dengue, a disease of special public health urgency regionally, the global debut of candidate vaccines in the region is being considered, with individual country vaccine registrations ahead of approval by a benchmark agency and provision of a certificate of pharmaceutical product.

Although a growing number of private manufacturers have emerged, especially in China and India, in other countries, national and local government manufacturers continue to be important sources of certain vaccines and biologicals for domestic needs (e.g., the Government Pharmaceutical Office in Thailand, Research Institute for Tropical Medicine in the Philippines, Biofarma in Indonesia, the National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology in Vietnam, and the Central Research Institute and local government institutes in India).

A reliable supply of inexpensive diphtheria and tetanus toxoids combined with whole-cell pertussis (DTwP)-Hib-HepB combination vaccines, made possible largely by Indian and Korean manufacturers, has facilitated the introduction of Hib antigen into schedules of economically disadvantaged countries that otherwise would not have adopted the monovalent vaccine. Similarly, provision of measles and measles containing vaccine by Indian manufacturers was key to the elimination of that disease in Latin America and the current state of polio elimination could not have been achieved without supplies from Asian regional manufacturers.

The WHO through the DCVRN has been actively working toward harmonizing procedures in affiliated countries, including China, India, and Indonesia, to bring those regulators under the WHO prequalification umbrella and to facilitate approval and supply of their products for Gavi and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF). 31 The requirement of some national regulatory authorities for clinical data in local populations is based on a concern that racial, ethnic, or environmental differences could affect responses of the local population, both immunologically and in their risk for adverse events. Genetically based differences in drug pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, as well as disease risk, increasingly have been recognized, including immune responses to vaccines. Studies of antibody responses to pneumococcal conjugate vaccines in Asia, for example, have found higher prevaccination and postvaccination antibody titers among Philippine and Taiwanese infants compared with European or historical control subjects, and in Korea, a considerably higher proportion of subjects were seropositive to meningococcal serogroup W135 polysaccharide at baseline than in the United States.

            "text": "In many examples, regulatory systems and processes in the region have had the effect of markedly slowing or effectively blocking the introduction of novel vaccines developed externally. In China, the introduction of an internationally registered and otherwise widely used product nevertheless necessitates recapitulating the entire clinical development program in China, including Phase I studies, despite an abundance of previously scrutinized evidence. This requirement introduces a delay of a decade or more for registration of internationally developed, as opposed to domestically developed, vaccines. Specifications in national pharmacopeias that deviate from established compendia, for example, exclusion of well-accepted excipients or methods, also have seriously impeded or prevented registration of foreign products or, when imposed with a revision of the pharmacopeia, have led to withdrawal of a previously registered product. Clinical trial processes also have hindered local introduction of established or novel products (e.g., a 2013 Indian Supreme Court ordered suspension of ongoing clinical trials and reexamination of previously approved trials was followed by a wholesale revision of clinical trial guidelines, leading to a temporary cessation of all industry-sponsored clinical trial activity). The potential inclusion of video recording of the informed consent process, newer insurance requirements and further proposed but unclear amendments to the Drug and Cosmetics Act that could impose criminal penalties against trial investigators for poorly defined violations may further limit trial activity. 39 China and Indonesia place severe restrictions on the exportation of clinical samples from study subjects, thereby requiring that validated laboratories and procedures are established locally, adding a barrier that has led to delays of or avoidance of clinical studies in those countries. Whether resulting from inexperience, a dearth of trained personnel, trade protection, or other reasons, administrative mechanisms in In most countries in the region, public health authorities now draw on external advisors to help formulate national vaccine recommendations in National Immunization Technical Advisory Groups (NITAG), resulting, in part, from activities of the Supporting Independent Immunization and Vaccine Advisory Committees Initiative (at the Agence de M\u00e9decine Pr\u00e9ventive). [41] [42] [43] [44] The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in Taiwan and Korea, Expert Committee on Immunization in Singapore, Chinese Expert Committee on EPI, Hong Kong Scientific Committee on Vaccine Preventable Diseases, Immunization Committee of the Indonesian Pediatric Society, National Technical Advisory Group for Immunization in India, and the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunization are examples of such medical advisory groups. In China, vaccine recommendations are made through the National Centers for Disease Control based on recommendations of the Chinese Expert Committee on EPI under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare; however, provincial or local Centers for Disease Control may issue independent recommendations for specific vaccines or modify the national recommendation for routine vaccines (see Tables  75.1 ",

Even for low-middle-income countries in the region, the total per capita expenditure for all healthcare may be less than the cost of a full course of a novel vaccine! On the other hand, national schedules in the region can be as comprehensive as to include the HPV vaccine (Australia) and influenza and varicella vaccines (e.g., Korea, Taiwan). At the same time, Hib vaccine still is not recommended in some jurisdictions with high per capita income (Hong Kong, Singapore). To some degree, the seemingly paradoxical recommendations of relatively high-income countries in the region reflect different social expectations of personal responsibility in healthcare purchases (see subsequent text). As shown in Table 75 .1, some national schedules provide optional recommendations for some antigens; in many countries where government tenders choose specific manufacturer products, specific combinations are recommended in the national schedule. In addition, for some antigens, provincial-specific recommendations address regional differences in risk (e.g., for routine group AC meningococcal vaccine in China; for JE vaccine in Sarawak, Malaysia, and for the Torres Straits, Australia; and for rabies vaccine [preexposure] in areas of the Philippines). be classified as either \"routine\" or \"voluntary,\" based on available data; the technical recommendation is considered by the Tuberculosis & Infectious Diseases Control Division which makes the administrative decision for the vaccine's inclusion in the national schedule; however, that decision requires additional legislative approval whether the disease (category A or B) qualifies for full or partial vaccine funding (up to circa 70%), respectively. The recommendation process is even lengthier than appearances suggest, as the Immunization Policy and Vaccination Committee does not convene a deliberative vaccine working group until after the product is registered, unlike the parallel activities of the U.S. ACIP and Food and Drug Administration. Only then does the committee assemble a dossier (Fact Sheet) that establishes the epidemiology of the disease and its local burden; if insufficient data are available, de novo studies might be required to establish need. The overall interval between vaccine approval and issuance of a recommendation typically is 3 years. Other Asian countries have similar or even lengthier intervals between vaccine registration and full EPI implementation. In Thailand, for example, after a preliminary NITAG recommendation, a new vaccine is implemented in a pilot program to establish effectiveness and to collect additional safety experience. Such a program may be gradually extended to other localities over a period of as long as a decade before the antigen is provided nationally. For diseases with regional differences in disease burden, high-risk provinces may be covered first (e.g., JE vaccine initially was introduced in Thailand to eight high-incidence provinces and progressively, from 1990 to 2000, to all 76 provinces, while local production was established and expanded). For new, often costly vaccines, phased introduction provides a mechanism to accommodate their full EPI coverage costs over time. In the interim, local governments of wealthier provinces or municipalities have issued their own recommendations for vaccines to be reimbursed (e.g., Shanghai provides pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine free of cost to older adults and Bangkok established a school-based HPV vaccination program, while neither vaccine is included in respective national schedules).",

As vaccines generally are available free in public clinics, even in affluent countries, families may obtain them in government clinics or hospitals (e.g., in Singapore, \u224860% of families obtain vaccines through the government system of polyclinics and hospitals). However, to avoid long waiting times and rotating staff at public clinics, many families opt to obtain these otherwise free vaccines privately and to pay out-of-pocket at pediatric, general practitioner, or other private clinics. In addition, as newer vaccines may be delayed in their introduction to the national reimbursement scheme, it is common for parents to pay voluntarily for these vaccines (see earlier). As might be expected from the distribution of income, the proportion of children vaccinated in government primary health centers is higher in rural areas. Overall, approximately 90% of children in Thailand and 70% in Malaysia are vaccinated through public channels.

Between 2005 and 2025, the birth cohort of Asia will decrease slightly from 76.1 to 72.2 million, and the population of children 0 to 4 years old will hold nearly constant while the number and proportion of adults from 15 to 64 years will increase dramatically, and the number of people older than 65 years of age will nearly double, from 250.6 to 480.6 million. A demographic crossover point with more adults 60+ years of age than children younger than 15 years of age was reached in Europe in the 1990s, and will occur within another generation in Asia (Fig. 75.2) . 46 With the exception of almost universal EPI programs of tetanus toxoid vaccination of pregnant women, adult vaccination has been viewed mainly in the context of travel, as in group A meningococcal vaccine for the Hajj, and in tropical Asia, influenza vaccine Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization-eligible countries (shaded) have similar coverage rates of basic vaccines as countries at higher levels of economic development, illustrating the success of Expanded Programme on Immunization. 71  71  71  75  40  91  91  91  91  94  92  97  97  97  97  93  91  97  97  97  97  94  89  90  99  90  90  99  96  92  92  77  92  90  63  91  99  99  99  99  99  99  99  99  94  94  72  67  70  20  74  42  85  85  86  4  84  79  98  99  95  93  98  99  98  98  99  99  93  93  99  32  99  99  99  99  99  99  95  97  97  97  97  99  97  87  87  86  87  82  95  97  96  97  97  95  99  36  41  36  21  70  42  98  98  98  98  97  97  75  72  76  72  86  80  92  92  92  92  88  92  93  92  92  92  86  72  72  72  72  61  58  68  68  69  68  70  94  94  88  94  90  53  97  97  97  95  95  83  83  85  83  76  99  99  99  99  99  99  96  96  97  96  92  92  99  99  99  99  94  82  82  82  82  70  98  98  98  99  99  99  99  99  99  97  99  59  59  93  59  98 47 Hepatitis A, interestingly, is now principally a risk in the cohort of young adults who were raised in an era of economic development and improved sanitation and who therefore lack natural immunity but were born before routine childhood vaccination was implemented. 48 A catch-up program to address this epidemiological shift has been recognized by adult vaccination recommendations in some countries (see Table 75 .3). In China, adult measles vaccination is under discussion, as more than 100,000 cases have occurred annually in recent years, in equal proportion in adults older than 20 years and in infants who had not received their first vaccine dose. Growing awareness of adult vaccination is reflected in an increasing number of countries with adult vaccination recommendations (see Table 75 .3). Two other population trends that will influence the demand for vaccines and channels for their delivery are urbanization and income disparity. 37 The urban-dwelling population in Asia is projected to increase by almost a billion persons between 2005 and 2025, from 1.5 billion to 2.4 billion, while the rural population will decline only slightly. Urban crowding is likely to affect the transmission patterns of certain person-to-person transmitted diseases and even of infections acquired from environmental sources. Dengue, for example, is transmitted by mosquito vectors that are more prevalent in urban environments; the already great need for a dengue vaccine will almost certainly increase with the growth of urban centers. 49 While the growing size and number of large cities may increase transmission of certain infections, delivery of vaccine and of healthcare in general is better organized in cities than in rural areas. Specific interventions are needed to ensure that the existing disparity in access to healthcare between urban and rural dwellers does not widen.",

While vaccines are regarded by many as a public good to be provided as a government service, as mentioned, access to the increasing number of new vaccines is likely to be stratified by income level and ability to pay, as governments must choose among increasingly costly vaccines and other health interventions. As shown in Table 75 .1, pediatric societies in a number of countries promulgate recommendations emulating those of the U.S. ACIP, and these schedules, aimed at practitioners serving private-paying families, may diverge increasingly from the national EPI schedules benefiting the majority of children in those countries. How the public and governments will respond to an increasing disparity of what has been perceived as a basic medical service remains to be seen.",

Governments and ASEAN have expressed increased interest in providing for national and regional vaccine security. The collaboration of industry sponsors with nongovernmental organizations and government in public private partnerships for new product development has been highlighted by the successful introduction of vaccines and drugs for several neglected diseases, for which the DCVMN view a responsibility. For example, the Japan International Cooperation Agency and Kitasato Daiichi Sankyo provided technical assistance to establish domestic measlesrubella vaccine production in Vietnam's public corporation, Center for Research and Production of Vaccines and Biologicals, POLYVAC. At the same time, the entry of nongovernmental organizations as actual sponsors of novel vaccine development for certain target diseases introduces competition with DCVMN manufacturers and multinational companies that might also consider similar development programs. Asian academic institutions and companies possess elements The crossover point when the population of adults older than 60 years of age exceeded the population of children younger than 14 years of age was crossed in Europe around 1995; that crossover is projected to occur in Asia around 2037, within a generation from now. for travelers to temperate locations. However, the severe acute respiratory syndrome and pandemic H1N1 outbreaks and the regional threat of H5N1 influenza have focused attention on routine seasonal influenza vaccination for the first time in many countries, beginning with elderly populations, and the role of children in influenza transmission is being recognized while it is rediscovered in Japan. As a result of high pediatric vaccination coverage in developed countries in the region, JE has become almost exclusively a disease of adults older than 45 years of age, reflecting the intrinsic biological susceptibility of older adults to neurotropic flaviviruses and suggesting a of the scientific and technical expertise needed to develop vaccines for current and emergent needs and, seemingly, the will to establish themselves on the global stage and contribute to their development. Regional institutions responded rapidly to threats of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome virus and Ebola virus with candidate vaccine development even when transmission was geographically remote. Further participation of regional institutions in global responses in the future is likely.",

As resources are unavailable in many countries to establish and maintain a fully functioning national control laboratory, a regional network has been proposed as an approach to share expertise and to divide workload, while at the same time standardizing methods and criteria. Field surveillance of adverse events following immunization is another area requiring strengthening. Investigations of adjuvanted H1N1 and H5N1 pandemic and prepandemic vaccines administered in Korea and Taiwan, respectively, illustrated the interest in and epidemiological capacity of local investigators but also the limitations of existing systems and databases.
