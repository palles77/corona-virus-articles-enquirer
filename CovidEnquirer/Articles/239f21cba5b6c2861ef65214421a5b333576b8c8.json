            "text": "Bovine rotavirus (BRoV) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) are major enteric viral pathogens responsible for calve diarrhoea. They are widespread both in dairy and beef cattle throughout the world and causing huge economic losses. The diagnosis of these agents is very difficult due to non-specific nature of lesions and the involvement of some intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors. We performed postmortem of 45 calves, which was below three months of age. Out of 45 necropscid calves, three (6.66%) cases were positive for BRoV and four (8.88%) cases were found positive for BCoV, screened by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Further RT-PCR positive cases were confirmed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in paraffin-embedded intestinal tissue sections. Three cases of enteritis caused by BRoV showed the hallmark lesions of the shortening and fusion of villi, denudation and infiltration of mononuclear cells in the lamina propria. The BRoV antigen distribution was prominent within the lining epithelium of the villi, peyer's patches in the ileum and strong immunoreactions in the lymphocytes and some macrophages of the mesenteric lymph nodes. Four cases in which BCoV was detected, grossly lesions characterized by colonic mucosa covered with thick, fibrinous and diphtheritic membrane. Histopathologically, jejunum showed skipping lesion of micro-abscesses in crypts. The BCoV antigen distribution was prominent within the necrotic crypts in the jejunum and cryptic micro-abscesses in the colon and ileum. It is the first report of BRoV and BCoV antigen demonstration in the jejunum, colon, ileum, Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes of naturally infected calves from India by using IHC.",

Economics of any livestock farm dependent on the health of its neonates, which are the future herd [1] . Despite the fact, neonatal calves are abysmally cared, with the result significant morbidity and mortality of these calves incurred huge economic consequences. Amongst various causes, the calf diarrhoea (enteritis) is a commonly reported disease worldwide in cattle. Diarrhoea is a multi-factorial disease, which accounts for 57% of mortality in < 1 month old calves [2] . In diarrhoeic calves, although co-infection observed frequently, but at times a single etiology can also be the cause in some cases. Major enteric viral pathogens responsible for calf diarrhoea are mainly Rotavirus and Coronavirus. Of late, newer emerging enteric pathogens such as Torovirus, Norovirus, Nebovirus, Enterovirus, Calcivirus and Parvovirus have also been added to the list of diarrhoea causing agents [3] . Co-infection with more than one pathogen is more frequent and often worsens the symptoms. The tetrad of Rotavirus, Coronavirus, Cryptosporidium, and Escherichia coli accounts for 75-95% of infection in neonatal calves worldwide, of which especially rotavirus and coronavirus account for 27-36% and 20-26% infections, respectively [4] [5] [6] [7] . Among all pathogens, rotaviruses are the leading cause of calf diarrhoea, and coronaviruses are a major contributor to it [4, 5, 8, 9] . The coronavirus infect both small intestine and large intestine to cause severe disease [10] . In calves, group A rotavirus and coronavirus, either single or in combination, are predominately associated with neonatal (mostly up to 5-15 day old) diarrhoea [11] [12] . The diagnosis of diarrhoea (enteritis) cases is cumbersome due to non specific nature of clinical signs/lesions, interaction of polymicrobial agents and involvement of intrinsic and extrinsic risk factors [13] .",

Bovine coronavirus is capable of infecting mature epithelium of small intestine and large intestine. Villi of the affected small intestine and colonic crypts become atrophic, and the lamina propria becomes necrotic and lumen of hyperplastic crypts filled with necrotic debris [15] .

PCR reaction was carried out in 0.2 ml PCR tubes containing reaction mixture of 6.0 \u03bcL of PCR Master Mix 2\u00d7 (Takara, City), 0.5 \u03bcL of forward primer (10 pmol/\u03bcL) and reverse primer (10 pmol/\u03bcL), 1 \u03bcL of cDNA (200 ng/\u03bcL) 12.00 \u03bcl of Nucleasefree water. The tubes were then placed in a thermocycler and PCR cycling conditions were used with initial denaturation of 95\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles [denaturation (94\u00b0C, 10 s); annealing (48\u00b0C, 20 s), extension on (72\u00b0C, 30 s)] and a single cycle of final extension at 68\u00b0C for 7 min. Amplified products were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis (1% w/v) at 100 V for 1 h in TAE buffer with 0.5 \u03bcg/ mL ethidium bromide and viewed under UV transilluminator (Geldoc, USA).",

After wiping around the section carefully, Goat antimouse IgGs secondary antibodies HRP conjugated (Invitrogen) diluted at 1:500 were applied to cover the moist section and incubated for 1 h in a humid chamber. Following three PBS (pH 7.2) washing of 5 min each, the section was covered with 3, 3-diaminobenzidine (DAB, Sigma Chemicals, USA) as a substrate, which gave brick red (reddish brown) colour. DAB substrate solution was prepared by adding 1 drop of DAB chromogen to 1 ml of DAB buffer. The reaction was terminated before generalized background staining appeared in the negative controls by rinsing in double DW. Sections were then counter stained for 1-2 min with Mayer's haematoxylin. After dehydrating in ascending grades of alcohol, sections were mounted with cover slips using DPX mountant.",

The recovered cases of diarrhoea might suffer with production losses even more than anticipated. The diarrhoea due to rotavirus and coronavirus in infants of humans, neonates of mammalian and avian species is a worldwide problem. The age has been found to be the greatest influencing factor in causing rotavirus and coronavirus infections. In our study calves below 1-month of age suffered with these pathogens. The same has been described by previous workers for occurrence of rotaviral and coronavirus diarrhoea in neonatal calves [20] : [21, 22] . The reason for high occurrence of these pathogens below one-month of age could be due to less developed immune system in neonates and the lack of adequate amount of maternal antibodies in the colostrum [23] , so the free sites are available for attachment of virus to sialic acid or galactosidase receptors of enterocytes. These receptors disappear with the increasing age of neonates [24] .",

Similarly, the extra-intestinal lesions in mesenteric lymph nodes (lymphocytes depletion and antigen detection by IHC) were also matched with the findings of previous workers, who described the depletion of lymphocytes from the germinal centers of lymphoid follicles of mesenteric lymph nodes and detection of rotavirus antigen by direct immunofluorescence technique in calves [27, 28] : [29] .

The histopathological lesions of coronavirus were colocalized with viral capsid protein in the jejunum and mesenteric lymph nodes, indicated that the lesions observed were due to coronavirus infection and replication. In present study the bovine coronavirus antigen distribution was prominent within the lining epithelium of the villi, jejunum, ileum, colon and mesenteric lymph nodes which was accordance with [31] ; who demonstrated coronavirus antigen in intestine of calves by immunohistochemistory, which was negative for RT-PCR. It is the first report of BRoV and BCoV antigen demonstration in the jejunum, colon, ileum, Peyer's patches and mesenteric lymph nodes of naturally infected calves from India by using immunohistochemistory. Overall, the findings suggest that, the BRoV and BCoV caused calf diarrhoea with specific lesions in the intestines (enteritis) and mesenteric lymph nodes. These lesions might have resulted into morbidity and mortality in bovine calves below 3 weeks of age. Further studies are needed to elucidate the pathogenesis by which BRoV and BCoV spread beyond the intestine and cause disease other than enteritis. Understanding the immuno-pathogenesis at subtle level would further enhance our knowledge in adopting better measures to control the BRoV and BCoV associated diarrhoea in bovine calves.",
