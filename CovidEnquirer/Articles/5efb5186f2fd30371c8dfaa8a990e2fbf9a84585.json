The viral infection causes a series of respiratory illness including severe respiratory syndrome, indicating the virus most likely infects respiratory epithelial cells and spreads mainly via respiratory tract from human to human. However, viral target cells and organs haven't been fully determined, impeding our understanding of the pathogenesis of the viral infection and viral transmission routes. According to a recent case report, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in a stool specimen [1] , raising the question of viral gastrointestinal infection and fecal-oral transmission route. It has been proved that SARS-CoV-2 uses ACE2 as a viral receptor for entry process [2] . ACE2 mRNA is highly expressed and stabilized by B 0 AT1 in gastrointestinal system [3, 4] , providing a prerequisite for SARS-CoV-2 infection. To further investigate the clinical significance of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in feces, we examined the viral RNA in feces from 71 patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection during their hospitalization. The viral RNA and viral nucleocapsid protein were examined in gastrointestinal tissues from one of the patients.",

Since viruses spread from infected to uninfected cells [6] , viral specific target cells or organs are determinants of viral transmission routes. Receptor-mediated viral entry into a host cell is the first step of viral infection. Our immunofluorescent data showed that ACE2 protein, which has been proved to be a cell receptor for SARS-CoV-2, is abundantly expressed in the glandular cells of gastric, duodenal and rectal epithelia, supporting the entry of SARS-CoV-2 into the host cells. ACE2 staining is rarely seen in esophageal mucosa probably because esophageal epithelium is mainly composed of squamous epithelial cells, which express less ACE2 than glandular epithelial cells. ",

Although viral RNA was also detected in esophageal mucous tissue, absence of viral nucleocapsid protein staining in esophageal mucosa indicates low viral infection in esophageal mucosa.After viral entry, virus-specific RNA and proteins are synthesized in the cytoplasm to assembly new virions[7], which can be released to gastrointestinal tract. Thecontinuous positive detection of the viral RNA from feces suggests that the infectious virions are secreted from the virus-infected gastrointestinal cells. Recently, we and others have isolated infectious SARS-CoV-2 from stool (Manuscript under revision), confirming the release of the infectious virions to the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, fecal-oral transmission could be an additional route for viral spread. Prevention of fecal-oral transmission should be taken into consideration to control the spread the virus. Our results highlight the clinical significance of testing viral RNA in feces by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) since infectious virions released from gastrointestinal tract can be monitored by the test. According to the current CDC guidance for disposition of patients with SARS-CoV-2, the decision to discontinue Transmission-Based Precautions for hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patientsis based on negative results of rRT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 from at least two sequential respiratory tract specimens collected \u226524 hours apart[8]. However, we observed in more than 20% of SARS-CoV-2 patients that the viral RNA remained positive in feces even after negative conversion of the viral RNA in respiratory tract, indicating that the viral gastrointestinal infection and the potential fecal-oral transmission can last even after viral clearance in respiratory tract. Therefore, we strongly recommend that rRT-PCR testing for SARS-CoV-2 from feces should be performed routinely in SARS-CoV-2 patients, and Transmission-Based Precautions for hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 patients should continue if feces tests positive by rRT-PCR testing.",

Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens tested positive by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. Chest CT presented with multiple ground-glass opacities, coinciding with previous report 1,2 showing evidence of pneumonia in both left and right lungs. His wife and daughter tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and admitted to the hospital on January 18, 2020. On hospital days 1 through 3, the patient remained fever with stable vital signs. The oxygen saturation remained above 95% with high-flow oxygen therapy. Empiric antimicrobials with oseltamivir and moxifloxacin was given during this period of time. On hospital day 4, the patient developed severe respiratory distress with the PaO 2 /FiO 2 decreasing to 130 and was immediately transferred to the intensive care unit receiving an intubation and mechanical ventilation. Along with sedation, prone position mechanical ventilation was applied for 12 hours per day and low tidal volume was set. The PaO 2 /FiO 2 increased to 350 immediately after intubation, but decreased gradually again in the following several days to the lowest level of 70 at 10 days after admission. Meanwhile, the chest X-ray showed extensive bilateral consolidation. And the emergent veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) was applied at the same day. On day 10, coffee ground gastric contents were observed from the gastric drainage tube and fecal occult blood tested positive, indicating upper gastrointestinal bleed. Gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed to determine the exact location of bleeding. Mucosa damage in esophagus was observed under endoscopy. Biopsy samples were taken from esophagus, gastric, duodenum and colon for histopathological and immunofluorescent staining. 1 day after treatment with octreotide and esomeprazole, gastrointestinal bleeding stopped. As of February 12, 2020, the patient remained hospitalized. The vital signs are stable with mechanical ventilation, V-V ECMO, and low dose vasopressors. There is no obvious evidence of other organs dysfunction.",
