            "text": "Breda virus (BRV), a member of the genus torovirus, is an established etiological agent of diarrhea of cattle, which is found as two separate serotypes, BRV-1 and BRV-2. In this study, a 7.5 kb fragment of the BRV-1 genome that bracketed the genes for the structural proteins of BRV was amplified by long RT-PCR and the amplicon purified and sequenced directly. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of four open reading frames (ORF) corresponding to the peplomer (S), envelope (M), and nucleocapsid (N) genes, and an ORF for a novel 1.2 kb gene located between the M and N genes. This new gene was identical in nucleotide sequence to the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) gene of BRV-2. With the exception of this new ORF, BRV-1 manifests 80% nucleotide sequence identity with the torovirus prototype, Berne virus (BEV) in the 7.5 kb region from the 3% end of the genome that contains the genes for the structural proteins. A 504 base segment containing the ORF for the BRV-1 N gene was amplified by RT-PCR, and cloned into an Escherichia coli expression system. The resulting protein was purified by SDS-PAGE and used to immunize guinea pigs. Hyperimmune serum was reactive with bovine torovirus (BTV) and human torovirus (HTV) antigens. By immunoelectron microscopy, it was shown to aggregate broken but not intact torovirus particles from BTV-positive fecal specimens. By immunoblot, the hyperimmune serum reacted specifically with the 20 kD N proteins of both BTV and HTV, as well as with the expressed N protein. BRV-1 and BRV-2 immune sera from gnotobiotic calves, but not human convalescent sera from HTV-infected patients, reacted with the expressed N protein by immunoblot. These findings were applied to the design of a dot blot assay that could specifically detect BTV and HTV from fecal specimens.",

This virus was found to be morphologically similar and antigenically related to the torovirus prototype, Berne virus, which is a recognized infectious agent of horses (Weiss et al., 1983) . Breda viruses are relatively pleomorphic particles that can be difficult to recognize by electron microscopy, and cannot as yet be propagated in cell culture. Hence, serological methods have generally been used for the routine identification of this agent (Brown et al., 1987; Koopmans et al., 1989) . On the basis of results from hemagglutination inhibition (HI) tests, enzyme-linked immunosorbant assays (ELISA), and immunoelectron microscopy (IEM), two serotypes of BRV have been recognized. Breda virus serotype 1 (BRV-1) represents the original isolate from Iowa, and serotype 2 (BRV-2) includes a second isolate from a colostrum-deprived calf in Iowa, and an isolate from a diarrheic calf in Ohio (Woode et al., 1985) .",

The latter findings revealed the presence of a novel 1.2 kb hemagglutinin-esterase gene located between the M and N genes that is not present in BEV, although the nucleotide sequence at the 3% end of this gene was shown to be highly similar to the X pseudogene of BEV (Cornelissen et al., 1997) .

The organization of the BEV genome and its replication strategy has been described by Snijder et al. (1990a) who showed that the BEV genome is a single-stranded positive sense RNA of approximately 26-28 kb in length. The organization of this genome is similar to that of avian infectious bronchitis virus, mouse hepatitis virus and equine arterivirus with which there is evidence of common ancestry Snijder and Horzinek, 1993; Snijder et al., 1994) . Based on the genome organization and replication strategies of these viruses, the coronaviruses, toroviruses, and arteriviruses have recently been assigned to a new order, the Nido6irales (Cavanagh, 1997; DeVries et al., 1997) . Sequencing of the 15 kb from the 3% end of the BEV genome has revealed the presence of five ORFs that encode the genes for the polymerase 1a (POL1a), the polymerase 1b (POL1b), the peplomer, the envelope, and the nucleocapsid protein (Snijder et al., 1990a) . One putative nonfunctional ORF (X) located between the M and N genes has also been identified (Snijder et al., 1990a .",

Sequence analysis of the BRV-1 amplicon revealed the presence of four ORFs that bear strong sequence similarities to corresponding ORFs of BEV, and have the capacity to code for all of the viral structural proteins. Sequencing the amplicon directly is advantageous since it inherently provides the consensus sequence, and RNA viruses are typically quasi-species (Holland et al., 1992) .

The nucleotide and amino acid sequences of the BRV-1 HE gene are identical to those of the BRV-2 HE gene. Hence, the BRV-1 HE displays the properties of an N-glycosylated protein, and may also possess acetylesterase activity since it contains the putative F-G-D-S acetylesterase catalytic site that is conserved among the HE proteins of coronaviruses, ICV, and BRV-2. This HE gene homolog has also been found to be present in the HTV genome (Duckmanton et al., unpublished data) . Thus, to date, BEV is the only torovirus that was not found to contain the HE gene and it has been suggested that BEV lost the 5%-most portion of its HE gene during tissue culture adaptation and the HE gene may be present in the natural BEV virion.",

By immunoblot, the gpHIhN serum reacted specifically with a 20 kDa protein in BTV-positive fecal specimens as well as HTVpositive specimens, demonstrating antigenic cross-reactivity among these toroviruses at the N gene level. This suggests a high degree of sequence homology between the HTV and BTV N genes, which is consistent with our previous observation that the nucleotide sequence in the 3% end of the HTV genome encompassing a portion of the N gene has been shown to be 92% identical to BRV-1 in this area (Koopmans et al., 1991; Duckmanton et al., 1997) . Cross-reactivity between toroviruses has previously been demonstrated with BEV preparations found to react with bovine convalescent sera by IEM (Beards et al., 1986) , and BRV antigens and BEV antibodies found to be reactive by immunofluorescence microscopy assays (IFA), ELISA, and IEM (Beards et al., 1986; Weiss and Horzinek, 1987) . In addition, HTV particles were found to be coated and aggregated after addition of calf sera containing antibodies to BRV (Beards et al., 1986) . Lastly, human stool specimens documented to contain HTV particles by electron microscopy were also shown to be reactive in a torovirus-specific ELISA based on BRV antiserum (Koopmans et al., 1993) .",

            "text": "It was therefore surprising to note that no such cross reactivity could be demonstrated between the expressed BRV N protein and human convalescent sera from torovirus pateints, even though these sera were previously shown to react with torovirus-positive human fecal specimens by HI and IEM (Duckmanton et al., 1997) . However, this result is consistent with immunoblot analyses done previously using these human acute/convalescent paired sera, whereby the convalescent serum was only found to react specifically with a 75-90 kD band representing the peplomer protein. This suggests that, following a torovirus infection, the major immune response in humans is to the torovirus peplomer protein and not to other structural proteins such as the nucleocapsid. This type of response has also been demonstrated in the coronaviruses (Schmidt and Kenny, 1981; Battaglia et al., 1987) . Conversely, the convalescent serum from gnotobiotic calves infected with BRV was reactive with the expressed BRV N protein. This could reflect a stronger response to the N protein by the calf immune system particularly since it is to the homologous virus.",

As shown by EM and IEM, many BRV-1 particles in stool samples are partly disrupted and their nucleocapsids exposed. Thus, once these agents are bound to a nylon membrane, it is possible to specifically detect them using designated antisera to the N protein. The speed and facility of the dot blot give it good potential as a practical immunospecific method for the diagnosis of bovine torovirus in veterinary practice. The strong cross-reactivity of the serum with HTV-positive specimens demonstrated by immunoblot and by this assay shows that the dot blot may also be useful for the diagnosis of torovirus in the human population.",
