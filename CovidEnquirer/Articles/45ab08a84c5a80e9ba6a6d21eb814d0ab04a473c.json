In this study we have defined a novel post-RER, pre-Golgi compartment where unassembled subunits of rubella virus (RV) E1 glycoprotein accumulate. When RV E1 is expressed in CHO cells in the absence of E2 glycoprotein, transport of E1 to the Golgi complex is arrested. The compartment in which E1 accumulates consists of a tubular network of smooth membranes which is in continuity with the RER but has distinctive properties from either the RER, Golgi, or previously characterized intermediate compartments. It lacks RER and Golgi membrane proteins and is not disrupted by agents which disrupt either the RER (thap-sigargin, ionomycin) or Golgi (nocodazole and brefeldin A). However, luminal ER proteins bearing the KDEL signal have access to this compartment. Kinetically the site of E1 arrest lies distal to or at the site where palmitylation occurs and proximal to the low temperature 15~ block. Taken together the findings suggest that the site of E1 arrest corresponds to, or is located close to the exit site from the ER. This compartment could be identified morphologically because it is highly amplified in cells overexpressing unassembled E1 subunits, but it may have its counterpart among the transitional elements of non-transfected cells. We conclude that the site of E1 arrest may represent a new compartment or a differentiated proximal moiety of the intermediate compartment.",

It is widely believed that no specific signals are required for exit from the ER or intra-Golgi transport (69) ; however, proteins must undergo proper folding and in many cases oligomerize to become transport competent (22, 43, 50) . Proteins exit the ER system in vesicular carders derived from transitional elements (42) and pass through pre-Golgi elements before entering the Golgi complex (52) . Pre-Golgi structures appear to represent the site of budding of certain viruses (61, 63) , the site of the low temperature (15~ (52) block and the site of accumulation of certain transmembrane and secretory proteins (48, 54, 66) .",

To further address aspects of ER to Golgi transport, we have studied the expression and intracellular transport of the structural proteins of rubella virus (RV). RV, a Togavirus that assembles 1. Abbreviations usedin thispaper: BFA, Brefeldin A; BiP, binding protein; DFBS, dialyzed fetal bovine serum; dhfr, dihydrofolate reductase; DSP, dithiobis succinimidylpropionate; PDI, protein disulfide isomerase; RER, rough ER; RV, rubella virus. on intracellular membranes (2, 68) , contains two type I membrane envelope glycoproteins E2 and E1 (12, 40, 67) which are thought to form a heterodimeric complex within the ER. Transient expression of RV E1 and E2 together or E1 alone in COS cells resulted in accumulation of the proteins in a post-RER, juxtanuclear compartment believed to be part of the Golgi complex (20) . In the present study we have further characterized the site of arrest of E1 by analysis of stably transfected CHO cells expressing El. We found that when RV E1 and E2 are expressed together in CHO cells they are targeted to the Golgi; however, when E1 is expressed alone it is arrested in a novel, post-RER/pre-Golgi compartment composed of tubular smooth membrane elements that appear to be located near the site of exit from the ER. In this paper, we have characterized this compartment and found that it has distinctive properties from either the RER or the Golgi complex.",

To circumvent this and other possible cellular perturbations associated with transient transfection, we constructed stably transfected cells lines expressing moderate levels of E1 and E2 together or E1 alone. Stable cell lines were obtained by cotransfecting dhfr-CHO cells with plasmids containing genes for RV structural proteins and the plasmid pFR400 which contains the selectable marker dhfr (57) . Selection was based on the ability of transfectants to grow in nucleoside-free medium. Clones were isolated and screened for expression of RV antigens by indirect immunofluorescence and radioimmunoprecipitation. E1 glycoprotein in CHO ceils expressing both RV E2 and E1 (CHOE2E1 cells) was localized in the Golgi region (Fig. 1, A and B) , whereas in CHO cells expressing E1 alone (CHOE1 cells), the glycoprotein was localized in large compact structures often located adjacent to the nucleus ( Fig. 1 C) . In some ceils only a single large structure (up to 2-3 t~m) was observed, while in others, two or more larger staining masses were evident in addition to many smaller ones. These structures were not part of the Golgi complex since they were not stained by antibodies to o~-mannosidase II ( Fig. 1 D) . Incubating cells in cycloheximide for up to 6 h did not affect the distribution of E1 (not shown). CHO ceils constitutively expressing E2 alone also did not contain the heavily stained cytoplasmic structures found in CHOE1 cells. Instead E2 antigen was distributed throughout the RER and Golgi membranes and at the cell surface (not shown). The results indicated that when E2 and E1 are expressed together they are targeted to Golgi elements, whereas E1 accumulates in a compartment of unusual morphology when expressed without E2.",

Since E1 is very cysteine rich (12) , the mobility shift is most likely due to formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds. Species with molecular weights expected of E1 dimers and trimers were also observed in nonreduced samples (Fig. 5 A, 2\u2022 3\u2022 however, no large aggregates which would be expected to be retarded at the top of the separating gel (34) were evident before or after the 2 h chase.",

A 60-rain labeling period was used to ensure that endogenous proteins that might be associated with E1 were labeled as well. When immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, slightly less monomeric and dimeric E1 was seen after cross-linking due to formarion of larger oligomers with an apparent molecular weight >200 kD (Fig. 5 A, arrowhead) . Crosslinking efficiency in intact cells was not improved substantially by increasing the concentration of DSP up to 1 mg/ml (not shown). Cross-linking efficiency was improved greatly by adding DSP to radiolabeled cells at the time of lysis. Cells were lysed in the presence of the nonionic detergent NP-40 (without SDS) so as not to disrupt protein-protein interactions. Under these conditions, cross-linking efficiency was much greater as very little monomeric E1 remained; however, no large aggregates were seen at the top of the resolving blocked in a pre-Golgi compartment. Subconttuent monolayers were pulse labeled with [35S]cysteine for 30 min and then chased in complete media containing excess unlabeled cysteine for the indicated time periods (h). Cells were lysed and E1 was recovered from the postnuclear supernatants by incubation with human anti-RV serum and Omnibind agarose beads. Samples were divided into three aliquots and treated with or without endo H (H lanes) or endo D (D lanes) or incubated without enzyme ( -lanes). The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 10% polyacrylamide gels and fluorographed. Golgi-specific processing of E1 glycans is indicated by an arrowhead. 14Clabeled protein standards (kD) are included for reference. In the endo D lanes the E1 bands appeared to be compressed in the chased samples. This flattening effect on E1 was most likely due to BSA (in the endo D preparation) which migrates slightly above El. gel (Fig. 5 B, -f3ME) . Rather, the E1 monomers, dimers, and trimers were cross-linked into oligomers >200 kD that possibly represent pentamers and hexamers (Fig. 5 B, arrowheads) . These oligomers presumably consisted mainly of El, since no other proteins including BiP (78 kD) specific to the cross-linked samples were evident after cleaving the crosslinker with /3-mercaptoethanol (Fig. 5 B, +BME) . Since CHO BiP can be radiolabeled with cysteine and contains 60 lysine residues (59) (some of which would be expected to be available for cross-linking with DSP), we would expect to be able to detect BiP under these conditions if it were associated with El. Furthermore, E1 from CHOE1 cells was recognized by four different mAbs which specify important immunologic epitopes, suggesting that E1 is properly folded (not shown).",

To determine if ER markers were present at the site of E1 arrest, we used antibodies to various resident proteins of this organelle in double immunofluorescence experiments. A polyclonal antiserum that recognizes four RER membrane proteins (33) gave a reticular cytoplasmic staining pattern typical of the RER; however, no staining of the El-containing compartment was evident (Fig. 6, A and B) . Similarly, a polyclonal antibody to a 160-kD ER membrane protein (obtained from D. Meyer) and another antiserum to three other integral membrane proteins of the RER (15) did not label the site of E1 accumulation (not shown). The fact that very little reticular ER staining for E1 was evident (Fig. 6 A) suggests that E1 rapidly leaves the RER after translocation. In contrast to that of RER membrane proteins, the distribution of two KDEL-containing content proteins, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), and BiP, partially overlapped with that of E1 (Fig. 6, C-F) . However, these proteins were clearly not concentrated in this compartment.",

To determine if proteins can enter and leave these structures and reach the Golgi complex, CHOE1 cells were infected with the ts045 strain of VSV. At 39.5~ the G protein of ts045 does not enter the Golgi complex due to a temperature-sensitive transport defect, but when shifted to 32~ the protein rapidly exits the ER and is transported through the Golgi to the cell surface (24, 28) . When CHOE1 cells were kept at 39.5~ VSV G protein was present in both the PER and the E1 tubular network (Fig. 10, A and B ). This indicates that although unable to enter the Golgi complex, G protein had access to the site of E1 arrest at the restrictive temperature. To follow the movement of G protein out of the ER system, infected cells were first incubated at 39.5~ and subsequently shifted to 32~ with cycloheximide present. By 5 min after shift to the permissive temperature, G protein could be seen within vesicular structures surrounding the tubular network and throughout the cytoplasm (Figs. 10, C and D) , G protein was seen in similar vesicular structures when infected cells were held at 15~ following G protein buildup at 39.5~ (Fig. 10  L) .

Subconfluent monolayers of CHOEI cells were pulse labeled for 60 min with [3sS]cysteine and chased for various time periods.

When pulse-chase experiments were carried out in the presence of chloroquine, the drug had very little if any effect on the rate of El proteolysis (not shown) rendering it unlikely that El is degraded in an acidic compartment such as lysosomes or endosomes. Double immunofluorescence experiments indicated that the tubular networks did not contain the lysosome markers Igpl20 (30) and cathepsin D, or the endosome marker, mannose-6-phosphate receptor (not shown).

Another key question that remains unanswered is: How is E1 retained and concentrated at the exit site? We can rule out that arrest is due to formation of covalent aggregates due to misfolding of E1 since no large disulfide-linked complexes were detected, and the glycoprotein was recognized by a number of mAbs that bind conformation-dependent epitopes. Also, it is unlikely that retention is due to stable interaction with BiP, and associations with other proteins were not detected.

It is the part rough/part smooth transitional elements of the ER that are presumed to represent the exit site for vesicles shuttling between the ER and Golgi complex or the ER and the intermediate compartment; however, the morphology of this region varies considerably from one cell type to another as detailed below. One possibility is that the El-containing tubular networks may arise as a consequence of extensive proliferation of smooth regions of the ER which correspond to transitional elements. The fact that the Elcontaining compartment is not destabilized by Ca 2+ removal is in keeping with the model proposed by Sambrook (51) which predicts that transport vesicles bud from regions of the ER that are not sensitive to fluctuations in calcium ions. Our findings are compatible with the assumption that proteins in transit to these specialized extensions of the ER may still be associated with molecular chaperones and enzymes required for attainment of correct tertiary structure such as BiP and PDI, respectively. Upon arrival at this juncture, properly assembled transport-competent protein complexes would presumably then enter transport vesicles, and the chaperone proteins could be returned to the PER by diffusion, or they may enter the vesicles, leave the ER system, and be returned via receptor-mediated retrieval from a salvage compartment (39) . By contrast unassembled subunits that are unable to enter the transport vesicles are retained by some unknown mechanism and are ultimately degraded. Alternatively, these membranes may develop from other as yet uncharacterized subregions of the ER. The situation will be clarified only when antibodies to resident proteins of the El-containing compartment are generated which should allow identification of these membranes in nontransfected cells.",

Unlike the structures described in this paper which form relatively homogeneous tubular networks, smooth ER of this type is not arranged in tubules and is often interspersed with other organelles such as mitochondria (41) . Several other ER-associated specialized pre-Golgi smooth membrane compartments have been described previously including, dilated smooth membrane cisternae that are the intracellular site of mouse hepatitis virus (61), spleen focus forming virus, and murine leukemia virus (63) budding in certain cell types; a smooth ER subcompartment consisting of anastamosing tubules where concentration and assembly of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan precursors is believed to take place in chondrocytes (66); \"crystalloid smooth ER\" found in mutant CHO cells synthesizing massive amounts of the resident ER membrane protein HMG CoA reductase, (11) , which ts045 G protein can also enter and exit (4); flattened smooth cisternae postulated to be amplified transitional elements in continuity with the PER in transfected COS cells expressing a rat growth hormone-influenza hemagglutinin chimeric protein (48) . None of these structures resembles morphologically the Elcontaining compartment described here; however, the latter compartment may be functionally equivalent since the growth hormone-influenza hemagglutinin protein remained endo H-sensitive and was modified with palmitate (47, 48) . The only other structures described to date that morphologically resemble the El-containing tubules are those that develop after endocytosis of SV-40 in CV-I cells; however, these tubules do not appear to be involved in exocytic processes, because newly synthesized virus particles do not enter them (23) .",

            "text": "The intermediate compartment was originally defined as a system of vacuoles located between the ER and cis-Golgi which newly synthesized viral proteins could enter at 15~ (52) . Although the intermediate compartment is still poorly defined, a number of properties and functions have been ascribed to it including; (a) palmitylation of viral membrane proteins (6); (b) budding of mouse hepatitus virus coronavirus (61) ; and (c) site of localization of certain membrane proteins (53, 54) . Originally, it was proposed that the intermediate compartment was the site where retrieval of KDELbearing proteins occurred. However, more recently this process has been suggested to occur in the Golgi complex (29) . An intermediate compartment would be expected to have physical properties and resident proteins distinct from the PER and cis-Golgi, and results obtained by Schweizer and colleagues demonstrate that such is the case (56) . The structure described in this paper shares some of the characteristics attributed to the intermediate compartment, such as, (a) palmitylation which occurs either proximal to or at the site of E1 accumulation; (b) it is not affected by agents which disrupt the Golgi or ER; and (c) it lacks RER and Golgi resident membrane proteins. It differs, however, in that transport of E1 is arrested proximal to the 15~ compartment as defined by transport of VSV G protein. This raises the question of how the compartment we have partially characterized and the intermediate compartment interact. The presence of physical connections between them seems unlikely. Rather, it seems more likely that a round of vesicular transport is required for passage of proteins from the site of E1 arrest to the pre-Golgi vacuoles that constitute the 15~ intermediate compartment.",

            "text": "Except for PDI and BiP which only partially overlap with El, no other marker proteins have been found that colocalize to the site of E1 arrest. HMG CoA reductase remains a potential marker; however, we were unable to detect this protein by immunofluorescence in our CHOE1 cells, presumably because expression levels of this enzyme are low except in these cells containing amplified copies of the gene. The GTPbinding protein rablb, which colocalizes with tab2 to the intermediate compartment (10) and is found predominantly in smooth ER fractions of tissue homogenates (45) also represents a potential marker, but we were not able to ascertain by immunofluorescence whether or not it was present at the site of E1 arrest. Similarly, our attempts to label CHOE1 cells using antibodies to the 72-kD KDEL receptor (65) or gp58 (53) were unsuccessful. We did not try p53 (54) The results presented here as well as those reported by others (11, 61, 63, 66) demonstrate that the smooth membrane pre-Golgi compartments that lie between the RER and cis-Golgi are diversified in organization and function and have the capacity to undergo amplification. They also raise the possibility that the smooth membrane pre-Golgi compartments may consist of two or more distinct subcompartments with different specialized functions. We consider that the site of E1 arrest may represent a new compartment or alternatively a differentiated proximal moiety of the intermediate compartment (54, 55) . Without appropriate markers it is difficult to know where to draw the line between the ER and intermediate compartments. The high level of expression of E1 in the CHOE1 cells should facilitate the isolation of the El-containing tubular elements by cell fractionation and immunoisolation, and make it possible to characterize the resident proteins of this novel compartment.",
