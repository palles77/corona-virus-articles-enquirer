The psychological impact of stressful events related to an infectious disease outbreak may be mediated by peoples' perceptions (Wu et al., 2009 ).

Experience in the early days of this outbreak taught us the paramount importance of a few frequently recurrent clinical themes. First, insomnia is possibly the first casualty of such outbreak and, therefore, it is important to restore sleep. Staff and patients should be educated on sleep deprivation and insomnia. Second, most people cope very well in their own way and benefit a great deal of a relatively small quotient of shared concern, good information, and support. Third, when individuals are facing such a crisis, they should feel that they are not alone. All efforts to overcome interpersonal isolation, from joke sharing in the nursing station to conference calls, have important roles in times of severe strain and stress (Folkman and Greer, 2000) .",

Some methods used in the SARS outbreak could be helpful for the response to the 2019-nCoV outbreak. Multidisciplinary mental health teams established by health authorities at regional and national levels (including psychiatrists, psychiatric nurses, clinical psychologists, and other mental health workers) should provide mental health support for patients and health workers. Specialized psychiatric treatments and appropriate mental health services and facilities should be supplied to patients with comorbid mental disorders. In addition, health workers and patients should receive clear communication with regular and accurate updates regarding the 2019-nCoV outbreak, in order to address their sense of uncertainty and fear. Treatment plans, progress reports, and health status updates should be given to both patients and their families. Furthermore, safe services should be set up to provide psychological counseling using electronic devices and applications (such as smartphones and WeChat) for not only the affected patients, but also their families and members of the audience. Safe communication channels for patients and their families, such as smartphone communication and WeChat, should be encouraged to decrease isolation.",
