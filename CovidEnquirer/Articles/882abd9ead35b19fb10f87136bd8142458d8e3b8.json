            "text": "Keywords: protein grafting; flexible backbone design; epitope scaffold; immunogen design Computational grafting of functional motifs onto scaffold proteins is a promising way to engineer novel proteins with pre-specified functionalities. Typically, protein grafting involves the transplantation of protein side chains from a functional motif onto structurally homologous regions of scaffold proteins. Using this approach, we previously transplanted the human immunodeficiency virus 2F5 and 4E10 epitopes onto heterologous proteins to design novel \"epitope-scaffold\" antigens. However, side-chain grafting is limited by the availability of scaffolds with compatible backbone for a given epitope structure and offers no route to modify backbone structure to improve mimicry or binding affinity. To address this, we report here a new and more aggressive computational method-backbone grafting of linear motifs-that transplants the backbone and side chains of linear functional motifs onto scaffold proteins. To test this method, we first used side-chain grafting to design new 2F5 epitope scaffolds with improved biophysical characteristics. We then independently transplanted the 2F5 epitope onto three of the same parent scaffolds using the newly developed backbone grafting procedure. Crystal structures of side-chain and backbone grafting designs showed close agreement with both the computational models and the desired epitope structure. In two cases, backbone grafting scaffolds bound antibody 2F5 with 30-and 9-fold higher affinity than corresponding side-chain grafting designs. These results demonstrate that flexible backbone methods for epitope grafting can significantly improve binding affinities over those achieved by fixed",

Protein grafting has been applied to design inhibitors, 1 to stabilize structures of functionally important transient states, 2, 3 to increase the specificity and affinity of binding interactions, 4 to introduce catalytic activities into proteins, [5] [6] [7] [8] to dissect the interactions of binding partners, 9 to improve vaccine epitope presentation, [10] [11] [12] and to present functional sites on proteins with desirable characteristics such as reduced size or high stability. 13, 14 Typically, protein grafting relies on identifying scaffolds with local backbone structure similar to the functional motif to be transplanted, followed by altering the scaffold sequence to accommodate the respective motif. Therefore, the ability to graft a motif onto a scaffold is limited by the complexity of the motif and the availability of scaffolds with suitable structure.",

As shown for the 2F5 and 4E10 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that neutralize diverse strains of the human immunodeficiency virus, epitope scaffolds bind their target antibody with high affinity and are able to elicit structure-specific immune responses. 15, 16 In other studies, immunogens designed by epitope transplantation elicited structure-specific responses targeting a snake toxin, 10 the yeast transcription factor GCN4, 11 and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus S glycoprotein. 12 Epitope scaffolds can thus serve as vaccine candidates or as reagents to map different sera specificities.

In this procedure (Fig. 1) , the side chains of a linear epitope were transplanted to other proteins that had exposed backbone segments conformationally similar to the backbone of the antibody-bound epitope. Despite our previous success with side-chain grafting, this method has two significant limitations: first, it relies on the existence of scaffolds with exposed backbone structurally similar to a given epitope, and second, when such scaffolds can be identified, the displayed epitope conformation differs slightly from the antibody-bound epitope conformation due to the imperfect match between the backbone of the native scaffold and that of the epitope (RMSD is typically \u223c 1 \u00c5); this in turn might affect the affinity of the designed antigen-antibody interaction.

Rather than transplanting the side chains of a functional motif onto a preexisting scaffold backbone, backbone grafting replaces the native backbone of a candidate scaffold with the desired backbone conformation of a functional motif (Fig. 1) . Thus, epitope backbone grafting imposes the conformation of a given epitope onto a scaffold and integrates that epitope conformation into the scaffold through backbone remodeling and sequence design in regions flanking the epitope. Previous studies [17] [18] [19] [20] successfully modeled protein backbone regions with atomic accuracy using computational approaches. However, none of these studies attempted to maintain a predefined sequence or structure during backbone remodeling but rather iterated between sequence design and structure optimization steps to identify the most favorable solutions energetically. In contrast, backbone grafting of linear motifs maintains the sequence and structure of a functional motif while building novel interactions to integrate the transplanted motif with the scaffold.",

In the matching stage for backbone grafting, all possible alignments were tested for the N or C terminus of the epitope over the whole structure of the three parent scaffolds (PDB IDs: 2cx5, 1wnu, and 1zko). In this alignment procedure, backbone atoms on one end of the epitope were superimposed onto the scaffold backbone, and RMSD values were measured between the other end of the epitope and proximal positions on the scaffold. Epitope alignments were selected if the non-superimposed end was closer than 3 \u00c5 from a scaffold backbone residue and if the alignments satisfied additional filters that assessed potential clashes between the epitope and the scaffold and between the antibody and the epitope presented in the scaffold context. The resulting matches were restricted further, for the purpose of comparing backbone grafting scaffolds directly with side-chain grafting scaffolds. Only backbone matches that placed the epitope at the same scaffold position as in the side-chain grafting designs were chosen for subsequent computational design. The native scaffold backbone corresponding to the epitope was removed and replaced by the epitope itself per the alignment, resulting in scaffolds anchoring the epitope at one end and leaving an open gap at the opposing end (Fig. 5 ). Backbone steric clash filters were then assessed to check the suitability of the scaffold to accommodate the epitope shape.",

In this stage, the amino acid identity of the scaffold and epitope-antibody complex was changed to alanine for efficient sampling and scoring. During loop closure, the values for the dihedral angles of four scaffold residues and one epitope residue were allowed to vary on each side of the grafted epitope while the backbone of the remaining residues was held fixed. Thus, the conformation of the epitope itself was held fixed except for the \u03d5 and \u03c8 angles for single residues at the epitope termini. Throughout the process, the antibody was kept in fixed rigid-body orientation relative to the epitope. Once a satisfactory closure was achieved, a backbone refinement step was employed to correct problematic backbone conformations modeled in the previous stage. The full sequence information was then recovered and the region of the scaffold adjacent to the binding interface was subjected to a round of sequence design in the presence of the antibody using a high-resolution energy function. Scaffold residues were designed if they were located within 4 \u00c5 of either the grafted epitope, defined as intra-design residues, or the antibody, defined as inter-design residues. During the automated design process, intra-design residues were allowed to change to any amino acid except cysteine, while inter-design residues were changed to either serine, alanine, glycine, or threonine. This stage of the procedure ensured that the grafted backbone interacted favorably with the rest of the scaffold and that the antibody could productively bind the resulting epitope scaffold only through epitope-mediated contacts. Finally, all-atom loop refinement 30, 31 was employed to refine the conformation of the backbone regions that were allowed to change during the process. On the resulting epitope scaffolds, there is a very slight deviation (backbone RMSD b 0.2 \u00c5) between the modeled conformation of the epitope and that of the native antibody-bound epitope. This is because the conformations of the N-and C-terminal epitope residues were altered during the loop closure stage to connect the epitope with the scaffold. Outside these peripheral residues, the epitope conformation on the scaffold perfectly matches that of the antibody-bound epitope.",

The different backbone conformations in the epitope region led to the design of different sequences in the backbone grafting designs compared to the sidechain grafting designs (Fig. 6c) . The sequence changes in epitope backbone grafting designs were deemed to be beneficial by stabilizing the epitope conformation, by favoring the epitope backbone conformation in the particular scaffold region, by transplanting additional epitope residues, or by improving the overall characteristics of the resulting epitope scaffold. A total of 5000 backbone grafting variants were designed on each of the three scaffolds. Designs were filtered and ranked according to the following criteria: (1) the energy of the scaffold alone and in complex with the antibody, (2) the theoretical binding energy (E complex \u2212 E partner1 \u2212 E partner2 ), (3) the final values of the backbone dihedral angles moved during the procedure, and (4) the overall core packing of the scaffold. For each of the three scaffolds, the backbone grafting method generated at least 10 models that scored better on all the criteria than the corresponding side-chain grafting designs. Three or four design variants based on each of the parent scaffolds were selected for experimental characterization based on sequence and structure diversity. Following visual inspection of the selected models, one additional round of human-guided computational sequence design was performed to correct the following defects: solvent-exposed hydrophobic groups, buried hydrogen donor or acceptor groups, and non-epitope-mediated contacts to the antibody. This stage corrects for any imperfections due to incomplete sampling and inaccuracies in the Rosetta energy function by manually restricting the set of amino acids allowed at a given position during the computational procedure-for example, only polar residues are allowed at solvent-exposed position on the scaffold.",

However, during backbone grafting, the orientation of the epitope relative to the scaffold was changed such that L86 could be accommodated on BB_2cx5 variants. The higher affinity of BB_2cx5 designs could thus be partially explained due to extra contacts between L86 and 2F5 mAb.

As in the 2cx5 case, small sequence differences were responsible for the enhanced 2F5 binding. Four residue changes relative to SC_1wnu were common to all the BB_1wnu variants (T22A, D26A, P50L, and G54A) and two additional mutations were particular to BB_1wnu_001 (I55W and I58M) (Fig. S3) . Figure 7h shows the locations of these mutations on the crystal structures of SC_1wnu and BB_1wnu_001. Three of these mutations (T22A, I55W, and I58M) add interactions between the epitope and the scaffold, and one (D26A) removes nonspecific contacts between the epitope scaffold and the predicted 2F5 orientation upon binding. Similar to the 2cx5 case, the new rigid-body orientation of the epitope relative to the scaffold in the BB_1wnu designs allowed the transplantation of additional gp41 residues (L663 and A667) from the native 2F5 epitope to the backbone grafting scaffolds (mutations P50L and G54A). Together, these two residues contribute 11% of the buried surface in the 2F5-gp41 complex (PDB ID: 1tji); this could explain the increased affinity of BB_1wnu designs over SC_1wnu. None of the three backbone grafting designs based on the 1zko parent protein showed significant 2F5 binding. The 1zko side-chain grafting design had similarly low 2F5 affinity (K d N 2 \u03bcM). These results together suggest either that the epitope sequence is incompatible with the structure of the native 1zko protein or that there are unaccounted clashes in the modeling of the antibody-scaffold interaction in both SC and BB designs. Backbone grafting was thus unable to \"rescue\" this particular epitope scaffold, but backbone grafting performed no worse than side-chain grafting. Overall, of the 10 backbone grafting designs, 9 were purifiable and 6 bound 2F5 better than the corresponding side-chain grafting designs.",

The backbone conformation of a 15-residue segment was modified to transplant the 2F5 epitope to BB_1wnu_001, and over this region, the computational models showed an RMSD of 1.1 \u00c5 to the crystal structure. The epitope conformation presented on SC_1wnu accurately mimicked the epitope conformation induced by 2F5 upon gp41 peptide binding (backbone RMSD values of 0.9 \u00c5) and could interact with 2F5 when the antibodyscaffold complex was modeled (not shown). In the case of BB_1wnub, although the conformation of the epitope is very similar to the conformation of 2F5-bound gp41 (RMSD = 0.5 \u00c5), modeling the interaction of 2F5 with the determined structure resulted in significant backbone clashes between the antibody and regions of the scaffold that were not modified during the computational procedure. Given the high affinity of the interaction between 2F5 and BB_1wnu_001 (K d = 9 nM), these clashes suggested that the solution conformation of the epitope is different from the one present in the crystal structure, which is affected by crystal packing or that there is enough flexibility in the epitope region to allow for conformational changes upon 2F5 binding. The structures of BB_1wnu and SC_1wnu were very similar (backbone RMSD of 1 \u00c5), but there were considerable differences in the epitope region (RMSD of 2.2 \u00c5) ( Fig. 7g and h) . The DKW motif in SC_1wnu was located between a proline and a glycine that were mutated to leucine and alanine, respectively, in BB_1wnu (P50L and G54A mutations in Fig. 7h ). These two residues are equivalent to L663 and A667 of the 2F5 epitope on gp41 and contribute additional contacts to the antibody. Furthermore, in BB_1wnu, these two residues interact with M58, which is mutated from an isoleucine in SC_1wnu.",

Further, backbone grafting scaffolds had higher affinity than comparable side-chain grafting scaffolds based on the same parent scaffolds, in two of three cases. In the third case (1zko), neither the side-chain grafting nor the backbone grafting scaffolds had significant affinity for the 2F5 antibody; thus, backbone grafting was unable to rescue a failed scaffold in that case, but there was no evidence that backbone grafting was less successful than side-chain grafting.

In the matching stage of backbone grafting, candidate scaffolds are selected based on their ability to accommodate only the terminal residues of the epitope as well as the ability to sterically accommodate the epitope shape. This is in contrast to the matching stage of epitope side-chain grafting in which candidate scaffolds must structurally match all the backbone residues of a given motif. However, integrating and stabilizing the desired conformation of an epitope on a scaffold are more challenging in the case of backbone grafting. While epitope stabilization is intrinsic to the side-chain grafting procedure, backbone grafting relies on the ability of the computational protocol to accurately engineer and model novel protein backbone segments and to identify sequence changes on the scaffold to stabilize the desired epitope conformation. Therefore, for the transplantation of a given epitope, side-chain grafting may be more efficient if appropriate candidate scaffolds can be identified, while backbone grafting would be required in cases when no suitable scaffolds exist for side-chain grafting. However, a key finding of this study is that backbone grafting scaffolds can achieve higher affinities than side-chain grafting scaffolds in some cases. This demonstrates that flexible backbone modeling can improve the design of high-affinity epitope scaffolds, even in cases where side-chain grafting is possible.",

The 2F5 affinities of the first-generation epitope scaffolds were initially determined by Ofek et al. by SPR with the epitope scaffold immobilized on the sensor chip and 2F5 Fab injected as analyte (measured K d values between 0.6 and 18.8 nM). 15 In a subsequent study by Guenaga et al., 26 these interactions were measured in the same format employed here-2F5 IgG immobilized on the chip and the epitope scaffold injected as analyte-and with one exception (ES2, K d = 1.1 nM), the reported 2F5 affinities were lower than those determined by Ofek et al. (K d values between 41 and 85 nM) . Furthermore, as noted in the follow-up study by Guenaga et al., the actual K d values for the 1:1 interaction between 2F5 and some of the firstgeneration epitope scaffolds might be even higher, due to the possible oligomerization of epitope scaffolds that may have led to avidity gains in the measurements. No solution multimeric state or thermal stability data were reported by those two studies on the first-generation epitope scaffolds. The epitope scaffolds described in this study were shown to have high melting temperatures and to be monomeric in solution, and the determined dissociation constants represent true measurements of the 1:1 interaction between 2F5 and the epitope scaffolds (with the noted exception of SC_2cx0a). Overall, 10 of the epitope scaffolds discussed here bound 2F5 with K d values between 1 nM and 100 nM. These epitope scaffolds present between 62% ( 660 ELDKWA 667 ) and 74% ( 661 LELDKWA 667 ) of the 2F5 binding area on gp41, while the first-generation epitope scaffolds displayed 87% ( 659 ExLELDKWAxL 669 ) of the binding area and allowed one additional hydrogen bond across the interface (gp41 Gln 658 O-2F5 Gln L27 N \u025b2 ). Given the similar affinities, this suggests increased epitope stabilization and/or better conformational mimicry on the epitope scaffolds designed in this study. To further support this, the kinetic association rates (k on ) of the epitope scaffolds discussed here (values between 5 \u00d7 10 5 and 10 7 M \u2212 1 s \u2212 1 ) are at least 1 order of magnitude faster than the k on values of the first-generation epitope scaffolds, except for ES2 (k on = 10 6 M \u2212 1 s \u2212 1 ). 15 The epitope scaffold with the highest affinity in this study, BB_2cx5_001 (K d = 1.4 nM), was engineered by backbone grafting. Its 2F5 affinity is in the same range as that of the longer, full-length gp41epitope (K d = 4.5 nM) and that of the best first-generation 2F5 epitope scaffold (ES2, K d = 1.1 nM), which also presented a longer stretch of the epitope.",

The majority of previous protein grafting studies relied on grafting the side chains of a given functional motif onto regions of high structural homology of candidate scaffold proteins. These approaches are restricted by the existence of structurally characterized scaffolds with exposed backbone similar in conformation to a particular motif. To avoid this limitation, numerous efforts involved the grafting of motifs located on common secondary-structure elements, such as single \u03b1-helices and polyproline type II helices, 2,32-35 \u03b1-helical coiled coils, 3, 9, 11, 12, 36 and \u03b2-sheets, 10, 13, 14, 37 to analogous regions on heterologous proteins. In contrast, backbone grafting of linear motifs requires reduced structural similarity between a functional motif and candidate scaffolds, since only the termini of the motif, rather than the entire backbone length, have to be structurally matched with a scaffold for transplantation. Furthermore, backbone grafting has the added ability to alter the backbone conformation of a candidate scaffold and to engineer interactions between the transplanted motif and the scaffold such that the desired structural conformation of the motif is stabilized. Therefore, backbone grafting may allow transplantation of structurally diverse linear functional motifs when no suitable scaffolds exist for side-chain grafting. Although the new protocol presented here is capable in principle of aggressive scaffold remodeling and design, the results presented here only validate this method for motif transplantation into structurally similar regions of target scaffolds. Further studies will assess the ability of this computational method to graft functional motifs into scaffold regions with low structural homology.",

In the binding interface optimization, the native rotamers of epitope side chains were transplanted to variants of the candidate scaffolds in which the identity of all other scaffold residues were initially changed to glycine. Maintaining the full sidechain detail of the epitope residues and the antibody, both side-chain and rigid-body degrees of freedom at the antibody-scaffold binding interface were simultaneously minimized. 38 The temporary usage of glycine during this step for scaffold residues noncritical for binding ensures that extraneous or glancing interfacial interactions from the original scaffold residues do not exist and allows for a computational speedup during the minimization. Subsequently for sequence design, the native side chains of the scaffold outside the epitope region were recovered and the scaffold was further designed in the context of its complex with 2F5 mAb. Residues within 4 \u00c5 of the epitope were considered \"intra-design\" positions and all residues of the scaffold within 4 \u00c5 of the antibody were defined as \"interdesign\" positions. During the automated design process, inter-design residues were changed to either serine, alanine, glycine, or threonine, while the intra-design residues were allowed to change to any amino acid except cysteine. A Rosetta energy-based \u0394\u0394G was calculated between the epitope scaffolds and the antibody, and scaffolds that showed unfavorable interactions were discarded. Finally, a step of human-guided design was performed to optimize the scaffolds further, such as removing scaffold-mAb contacts outside the epitope, reverting scaffold mutations not affecting the scaffold-mAb interaction back to the native scaffold residues, and eliminating unpaired cysteines and undesired functional sites.",

In N2C alignment, the backbone atoms (N, C, and C \u03b1 ) of the N terminus residue of the epitope were aligned on candidate scaffolds and RMSD values were measured between the C terminus of the epitope and proximal residues on the scaffold. In C2N alignment, the backbone atoms (N, C, and C \u03b1 ) of the C terminus residue of the epitope was aligned on candidate scaffolds and RMSD values were measured between the N terminus of the epitope and proximal residues on the scaffold. Scaffolds with RMSD values below 3 \u00c5 were considered a preliminary match. For each match, the native scaffold backbone corresponding to the epitope was removed and replaced by the epitope itself per the alignment. This resulted in scaffolds anchoring the epitope at one end and leaving an open gap at the opposing end. Two steric clash filters using the Lennard-Jones component of the Rosetta energy function were then applied as an elementary assessment of the ability of the scaffold to accommodate the epitope shape. Only matches passing both filters continued onward to the grafting stage. The first \"intraclash\" filter evaluated the clash of the newly placed epitope backbone against the existing scaffold backbone. The presence of steric clash beyond a threshold indicates that the resulting epitope-scaffold backbone may selfintersect in an irrecoverable manner and that the match should be removed from consideration. For this study, the threshold for intra-clash was 1000 Rosetta energy units. The second \"inter-clash\" filter evaluated the clash of the antibody backbone, as placed in the match-derived rigid-body orientation relative to the epitope, against the existing scaffold backbone. Matches presenting an excessive amount of inter-clash beyond a threshold (a value of 3000 Rosetta energy units in this study) are indicative of anti-complementarity at the interface between antibody and scaffold and were removed from further consideration.",

In this stage, the amino acid identity of the scaffold and epitope-antibody complex was temporarily changed to alanine. The usage of alanine allows for a relatively neutral sampling of backbone dihedrals in Ramachandran space during loop closure, as we do not know prior to sequence design what the optimal sequence of the moveable residues should be. In addition, it ensures that extraneous or glancing interfacial interactions from the original scaffold do not exist, and the reduced number of atoms allows for a computational speedup. During loop closure, the values for the dihedral angles of four scaffold residues and one epitope residue were allowed to vary on each side of the grafted epitope, while the backbone of the remaining residues was held fixed. For each mobile residue, two sets of 200 backbone fragments, one set each of fragment length 3 and fragment length 1, were selected randomly based upon the preexisting secondarystructure type (loop, helix, or sheet) present in the scaffold and epitope. Throughout the process, the antibody was kept in fixed rigid-body orientation relative to the epitope, allowing the antibody to swing with the epitope as the epitope moved during loop closure. The polypeptide chain was considered closed when the chainbreak score 30 was less than 0.2. Additionally, the Ramachandran score 28 for any residue with modified backbone dihedrals was required to be less than 1.5 to ensure that no backbone dihedrals significantly violated the allowed space of Ramachandran angles. Due to the number of moveable residues (10), each loop closure attempt consisted of 1000 total cycles of the procedure. A total of five loop closures were attempted, and the three best-scoring closed epitope scaffolds were allowed to move to the next stage of the procedure.",

Since the prior loop closure procedure was performed using a low-resolution scoring function, issues with the backbone such as improper clashes could have been introduced. Backbone refinement therefore consisted of utilizing all-atom loop refinement while the scaffold was still all-alanine in sequence 30 to allow for adjustments based primarily on the backbone and not side-chain interactions. Problematic backbones with large clashes were expected to fail to re-obtain proper loop closure geometry during loop refinement. Subsequently, the same closure conditions employed during the prior loop closure procedure were checked again, and any epitope scaffolds failing those conditions were removed from further consideration. Full-sequence and side-chain information of both epitope scaffold and antibody were then recovered, and a full-atom design stage was employed to ensure that the grafted backbone interacted favorably with the rest of the scaffold and that the antibody could bind to the resulting epitope scaffold. This design stage used the identical inter-and intraresidue classification as presented in epitope side-chain grafting. Finally, all-atom loop refinement was performed to refine the regions of the backbone that were allowed to change during the grafting process, allowing the epitope scaffold to settle into a final state. 30 Resulting epitope scaffolds were ranked based on their predicted ability to bind 2F5, their protein core interactions, the number of buried hydrogen donors or acceptors, and the values of the dihedral angles in the regions allowed to move during loop closure.",

Experimental electron density maps were calculated with CNS 42 and interpreted using the program Coot. 43 The resulting model was refined with CNS. Ramachandran plot statistics were calculated using Coot. 43 Solvent molecules were picked with the CNS algorithm using the following input parameters: (1) a peak over 3.5 \u03c3 in the difference electron density map and (2) at hydrogen bond distance from neighboring donor or acceptor atoms. Statistical data for data collection and model refinement are given in Table 3 . Figures were prepared using the program PyMOL.",
