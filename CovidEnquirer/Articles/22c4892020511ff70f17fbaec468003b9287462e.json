In further in vivo voltammetric studies, the effects of SC cocaine on synaptic concentrations of DA and 5-HT were studied in the chloral hydrate-anesthetized paradigm in two neuroanatomic substrates, NAcc and mesoaccumbens somatodendrites, the ventral tegmental area (VTA-At0), in a doseresponse fashion (10, 20 , and 40 mg/kg) in six separate studies. Moreover, in two additional in vivo voltammetric studies, again using the chloral hydrate-anesthetized paradigm, the impulse flow blocker, ~-butyrolactone (3,-BL) (750 mg/kg, IP), was studied alone and in combination with SC cocaine (20 mg/kg) to determine whether or not cocaine can act by presynaptic releasing mechanisms for DA and 5-HT. The results show that IV cocaine concurrently and significantly increased DA and 5-HT release in the NAcc (p < 0.001, p < 0.0005, respectively) at both doses tested. Moreover, IV cocaine effects on DA and 5-HT release were significantly and positively correlated (p < 0.01). On the other hand, SC cocaine concurrently and significantly decreased DA and 5-HT release in NAcc (/9 < 0.0001) and VTA (p < 0.0001) at each separate dose tested. SC cocaine effects on DA and 5-HT release were significantly and positively correlated across dose and neuroanatomic substrate (p < 0.01). Furthermore, the ~/-BL studies indicate that cocaine's action includes a presynaptic release mechanism for the biogenic amines. Summarily, the data show that a consideration of the route of cocaine administration is crucial in determining the underlying neurochemical basis for cocaine.",

            "text": "In vivo electrochemistry (voltammetry) THERE is a general consensus from clinical and preclinical studies that cocaine has specific dopaminergic (DAergic) influences associated with its craving or craving-like syndrome (15, 20, 25, 30, (42) (43) (44) 46) . Predominantly, the evidence shows that the behavioral types of cocaine reinforcement involve an operative mesoaccumbens DAergic hyperfunction in Al0 nerve terminals [nucleus accumbens (NAcc)] (7, 11, 24, 27, 40) and in Al0 somatodendrites [ventral tegmental area (VTA)] (9) . Of necessity, though, the correlation between cocaine-induced enhancement of dopamine (DA) overflow and its associated behavior was demonstrated in the freely moving animal para-digm. In this paradigm, adequate recovery from surgery precludes anesthetic consequence. On the other hand, studies of the electrophysiological effects of cocaine on impulse frequency rates (cell firing) of DA neurons in the VTA have been examined in animals anesthetized with chloral hydrate (16) . Therefore, because pre-and postsynaptic release mechanisms are contingent upon somatodendritic impulse frequency rates, nuances in DA cell responsiveness due to either or both general and local anesthesia deserve consideration. Recent reports have shown that chloral hydrate, a general anesthetic, changes a) the basal activity, b) the pharmacologi-cal responsiveness, and c) the spontaneous activity (burst firing) of mesolimbic mesoaccumbens DA neurons; suppression of burst firing occurs in a continuum with effects of general anesthetics > local anesthetics > no anesthetic (18, 28) . Given this caveat, we assessed the effects of IV cocaine on synaptic concentrations of DA in the NAcc and VTA in the chloral hydrate-anesthetized paradigm. The IV route of administration was chosen for direct comparison to electrophysiological studies. Moreover, further studies were done to assess the effect of cocaine when it is administered SC because no neurochemical studies of this kind have been addressed, despite the early data distinguishing the pharmacokinetic effects of IV and SC cocaine (36) .",

A sequence of events occurred in the analytic study of the 5-HT organization in brain that initially demonstrated a prominent transtegmental 5-HT fiber pathway in the A~0 region that begins in the median and dorsal mesencephalic raphe nuclei and curves ventrally across the VTA to communicate in the medial forebrain bundle (MFB) (38, 48) .

An additional injection of chloral hydrate (0.1 cc) was administered every 40 min to maintain adequate depth of anesthesia; leg flexion and corneal and pinnal responses were assessed. The indicator (working) microelectrode was slowly inserted (0.5 mm in l min at 5-min intervals) into ventrolateral NAcc and into VTA in separate groups of animals using the stereotaxic coordinates of Pelligrino and Cushman (39) . The stereotaxic coordinates were: NAcc: from bregma A = 2.6, ML = +2.5, and DV = -7.3; VTA: from bregma P = 2.8, ML = +0.9, and DV = -8.6. An Ag/AgC1 reference microelectrode and stainless steel auxiliary microelectrode combination was placed in contact with dura. Each microelectrode of the three-microelectrode assembly was constructed in this laboratory. Body temperature was continuously monitored with a rectal probe attached to a thermometer (Fisher Scientific, Fadem, N J) and was continuously maintained at 37 _+ 0.5\u00b0C with an Aquamatic K module heating pad (American Hospital Supply, Edison, N J).

Dopamine and 5-HT were detected within 10-15 and 10-13 s, respectively, and sequentially in two separate waveforms on the in vitro and in vivo voltammogram in both the NAcc and VTA. DA was the first signal and 5-HT the second to be detected in the time course of the applied potential (Eapp). Eap for DA is +0.140 + 0.015 V. Even at high concentrations, the anionic metabolite of DA, 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), was not detected. At high concentrations, however, ascorbic acid (AA), the cofactor in the DA biosynthetic pathway, was detectable but at a different Eap than that for DA or 5-HT. The neurotransmitter 5-HT was detected within a 10-13 s time period at an Eap of + 0.290 + 0.015 V. Neither the metabolite of 5-HT, that is, 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), nor uric acid (UA), which is a constituent of brain with similar electroactive Eap properties to those of 5-HT, was part of the 5-HT signal. In vivo electrochemical parameters such as E~p for DA and 5-HT are the same in the VTA as in NAcc, given that conditions of temperature, pH, resistance, capacitance, time constants, sensitivities, and preconcentration procedures are not changed. Each voltammogram is completed within 60 s in vivo. Initial potential (Eapp) was -0.200 V; the end E~pp was +0.400 V; the scan rate was 10 mV s-~. Potentials were applied to the working microelectrode with respect to an Ag/ AgC1 microelectrode (with 0.16 M saline) by a CV37 detector potentiostat (BAS, West Lafayette, IN). The CV37 was electrically connected to a Minigard Surge Suppressor (Jefferson Electric, Magnetek, NY), which was then connected to an isolated electrical ground. There was a 6-min interval between the completion of one voltammogram and the 2-min cell activation for the next voltammogram. Non-Faradaic charging current (Cdt) was eliminated in the first 25 s of each scan. Coulombic efficiency for the detection of 5-HT was two-to threefold greater than that for DA as shown by previous in vitro studies (4, 5) .",

Because the actual detection time for DA is 10-15 s, the 070 change in synaptic concentrations of DA at each data point, postcocaine, represents a 10-15 s current change (pA) from baseline, that is, current detected within a discrete synaptic environment of the NAcc or VTA at the microelectrode surface within a 10-15 s time period in the presence of cocaine vis-a-vis the absence of cocaine.

Taken together with other studies showing comparable IV cocaine-DAergic effects in the NAcc in the freely moving animal paradigm (11, 24, 40) , the data show that the general anesthetic effects of chloral hydrate do not influence the response of DA in the NAcc to IV cocaine. Previous findings have also posited a lack of local anesthetic involvement in the Al0 response to IV cocaine (16) . Too, the present results are in agreement with previous in situ studies, using the anesthetized paradigm, that show that IV cocaine increased extracellular DA concentrations in the NAcc (35) and increased extracellular DA concentrations in both the NAcc and VTA (3) . Consistent with the latter study, baseline DA concentrations in the VTA were generally less than those in the NAcc. However, it is noteworthy that the comparison between the two studies is relative, that is, whereas each dialysate sampling (3) of DA is integrated over 20 min, each in vivo electrochemical sampling of DA occurs within 10-15 s. Moreover, the present data are consistent with the literature with respect to the time course effects of IV cocaine (3, 35) . Indeed, the significantly increased DA release, which remains visible 60 min after IV cocaine administration (1 mg/kg) despite decreased levels of cocaine in the NAcc (37), may help explain the addictive potency of cocaine. Notably, new findings show that 5-HT release is significantly increased in the NAcc after IV cocaine in the chloral hydrate-anesthetized preparation. The 5-HT effect is concurrent and correlated with the DAergic response; this is particularly interesting because somatodendritic cell firing rates in the VTA and DR after cocaine also parallel each other, at least acutely (13, 16) . The results are in clear agreement with current thinking that cocaine-induced terminal reuptake inhibition (22, 45) , which would also elevate synaptic DA and 5-HT, can produce a silencing of VTA and DR cell firing.",

This discrepancy may indicate further the involvement of a long loop negative feedback interplay. Importantly, though, it may have additional implications, that is, other actions, are involved in the systemic effects of cocaine. Correspondingly, cocaine has long-lived and powerful peripheral vasoconstrictor effects. In fact, cocaine is the only local anesthetic that is a vasoconstrictor (41) . Cocaine has been shown to increase the vasoactive sensitivity and/or maximum response of the coronary and femoral artery to other vasoactive substances, NE, 5-HT, and the thromboxane A 2 analog, U-46619 (26) . Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic effects of cocaine are highly dependent upon route of administration. Nayak et al. (36) reported that the tl/2 of acute IV cocaine is 0.3 and 0.4 h in blood and brain, respectively, whereas the fl/2 of acute SC cocaine is 0.8 and 1.0 h in brain and blood, respectively; cocaine is seen in brain 4 h after SC administration (36) . Thus, cocaine via the SC route provides longer-lasting effects than the IV route, in part due to local vasoconstriction and in part due to absorptive processes, which are inherently eliminated with IV injection.",

The results repeat previous studies showing that the DAergic response to SC cocaine (20 mg/kg) was decreased in the NAcc in the chloral hydrate-anesthetized rat (10) . A colocalization of DA and 5-HT was apparent and the decrease in biogenic amine release, coinduced by cocaine, was highly correlative. The neuroanatomic substrate VTA appears more vulnerable than does the NAcc to the biogenic amine effects of SC cocaine, although the NAcc was significantly affected. However, perhaps most contributory from the present findings is the demonstration that \"route of administration\" of cocaine significantly affects the neurochemical DA and 5-HT response to cocaine. The data lend an explanatory note to previous data showing that the route of administration of cocaine, even on an acute basis, influences behavior differently (31) and that even the pattern of cocaine administration within any one route may evoke differential responses (29) . Importantly, if one can assume identical cell firing effects with both SC and IV cocaine in the VTA and DR, the present data reveal that increased synaptic concentrations of DA and 5-HT at the neuronal terminal may not be necessary for, or are uncoupled with, cocaine's action on somatodendrites.",

The data are supported clinically; surgery is complicative in the cocaine-addicted patient (17) . Moreover, the general anesthetic effects that influence the DAergic reaction to SC cocaine in the anesthetized paradigm do not cross over to the 5-HTergic response in DA pathways in the conscious paradigm (7) .",

Because the disposition of SC cocaine is long lived, further opportunity is provided for metabolite derivation. One cocaine metabolite, benzoylecgonine, itself is a potent vasoconstrictor with vasoactive properties greater than NE and cocaine (33) . Interestingly, benzoylecgonine does not increase reinforcement behavior and also does not displace [3H]cocaine binding (46) . Thus, it is possible that the action of SC cocaine in the chloral hydrate-anesthetized rat paradigm is due to the formation of benzoylecgonine.",

SC cocaine did not further significantly alter synaptic concentrations of DA in the NAcc in the presence of neuronal impulse flow inhibition with \"r-BL. Therefore, other data that show that available synaptic DA is necessary for the action of cocaine (8, 12) are supported. The data agree with another report showing that cocaine does not reverse 3~-BL-altered DAergic function (19) . Also, the evidence presented for a presynaptic 5-HTergic releasing mechanism is in agreement with a previous report (8) . The evidence is more conclusive here for 5-HT than for DA because the electroactive species for 5-HT is exactly subtended when neuronal impulse flow is blocked. Alternatively, the explanation for the 5-HTergic effects of cocaine after 3,-BL, may be simply that the cocaine-induced 5-HT reuptake inhibitory effects are seen after release mechanisms are blocked.",

[ANOVA: F(2, 10) = 15.04, p < 0.0010, N = 5]. Posthoc analysis further showed that the statistically significant differences between basal synaptic concentrations of DA and cocaine-induced synaptic concentrations of DA occurred at each of the doses tested (0.5 mg/kg: Fisher's PLSD = 9.303, Scheffe's F = 6.264; 1.0 mg/kg: Fisher's PLSD = 9.303, Scheffe's F = 14.57). Cocaine significantly increased the in vivo electrochemical signal for 5-HT over the 2-h, two-dose period of testing [ANOVA: F(2, 10) = 17.973, p < 0.0005, N = 5]. Posthoc analysis further revealed that the statistically significant differences between endogenous synaptic concentrations of 5-HT and cocaine-induced synaptic concentrations of 5-HT took place at each of the doses tested (0.5 mg/kg: Fisher's PLSD = 6.239, Scheffe's F = 5.675; 1.0 mg/kg: Fisher's PLSD = 6.239, Scheffe's F = 17.877). The 5-HTergic responsiveness to cocaine very closely parallels that of DA. DA and 5-HT values are significantly and positively correlated [Pearson product: rto)= 0.810, z = 1.1270, p < 0.01]. At the completion of the 0.5-mg/kg dose effect, DA and 5-HT return to baseline to 106 and 107\u00b070 above basal values, respectively. DA and 5-HT are coincident immediately after and 50 and 60 min after the lower dose of IV cocaine and at 30 min after the higher dose of IV cocaine. Both DA and 5-HT increase after IV cocaine in a dose-dependent fashion. Figures 2a-c show the temporal effects of SC cocaine on synaptic concentrations of DA in the NAcc and VTA in the chloral hydrate-anesthetized paradigm. Figure 2(a) shows that SC cocaine (10 mg/kg) significantly decreased synaptic concentrations of DA in the NAcc and VTA [NAcc: ANOVA, F(3, 15) = 94.093,p < 0.0001, N = 5; VTA: ANOVA, F(3, 15) = 39.837, p < 0.0001, N = 5].

However, synaptic concentrations of DA in the NAcc and VTA did not continue to decrease further than was seen at the 20-mg/kg dose. Indeed, DA synaptic concentrations, although still significantly decreased from control values, increased above those of the 20-mg/kg dose and showed a trend toward baseline values at the end of the study. Posthoc analysis revealed that DA was significantly decreased in each of the 3 h tested both in the NAcc and VTA (NAcc: Fisher's PLSD = 2.645, Scheffe's F = 27.080, 51.384, and 49.708 for h 1, 2, and 3, respectively; VTA: Fisher's PLSD = 4.919, Scheffe's F = 46.05, 78.229, and 57.912 for h 1,2, and 3, respectively).

The VTA also seems the more vulnerable neuroanatomic substrate vis4t-vis the NAcc insofar as 5-HT is concerned [ANOVA, ]. 5-HT in the NAcc and VTA was significantly and positively correlated [Pearson product: rto)= 0.936, z = 1.7047, p < 0.01]. Cocaine dose dependent effects on 5-HT were also positively and significantly correlated (r > 0.843, z > 1.2212, p < 0.01). Like DA, synaptic concentrations of 5-HT in NAcc and VTA did not decrease further than did the 20 mg/kg dose effect. Figures 4(a) and 4(b) describe the response of DA and 5-HT neurons in the NAcc to 7-BL alone and in combination with SC cocaine (20 mg/kg). In Figure 4(a), 7-BL significantly decreased the electroactive species for DA [ANOVA, F(1, 5) = 26.209, p < 0.0037, N = 7] for the hour tested. The general anesthetics, ~-BL plus chloral hydrate, were toxic in most animals within approximately 40-50 min after 7-BL injection. One can reasonably assume that the general anesthetic effect of 7-BL (50) and that of chloral hydrate proved a respiratory challenge that could not be overcome in an approximate two thirds of the subpopulation. On the other hand, 7-BL produced a transient but significant decrease in 5-HT [ANOVA, F(I, 5) = 14.095, p < 0.0132, N = 7] that lasted for 30 min and then significantly increased for 30 min [ANOVA, F(1, 5) = 13.186,p < 0.015, N = 2-7].",

It is important to note, though, that the DA decrease after SC cocaine, which was seen after 3,-BL impulse blockade, is a composite of a continuing blockade of DA impulse flow. 7-BL has a long-lasting effect on DA neurons (unpublished data from this laboratory). Too, in this group, data points are diminished toward the 60-min mark because the combination (a) Effectof 7-BL (750 mg/kg, IP) on synaptic concentrations of DA and 5-HT in the NAcc in the chloral hydrate-anesthetized paradigm (N = 7). *p < 0.05, 95% CL.
