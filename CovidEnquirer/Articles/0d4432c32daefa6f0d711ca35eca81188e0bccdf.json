Prior analyses of SARS-CoV revealed that it utilizes a structurally unique three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot to stimulate high rates of -1 PRF, that it also harbors a -1 PRF attenuation element.

Here we present a comparative analysis of the original SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 frameshift signals. Structural analyses reveal that the core -1 PRF signal, composed of the U UUA AAC slippery site and three-stemmed mRNA pseudoknot is highly conserved. In contrast, the upstream attenuator hairpin is less well conserved. Functional assays revealed that both elements promote similar rates of -1 PRF and that silent coding mutations in the slippery site strongly ablate -1 PRF activity.

            "text": "the slippery site and its placement in relation to the incoming translational reading frame is critical: it must be N NNW WWZ (codons are shown in the incoming or 0-frame),where N is a stretch of three identical nucleotides, W is either AAA or UUU, and Z \u2260 G. The linker region is less well-defined, but typically is short (1 -12 nt long) and is thought to be important for determining the extent of -1 PRF in a virus-specific manner. The function of the downstream secondary structure is to induce elongating ribosomes to pause, a critical step for efficient -1 PRF to occur [reviewed in(9)]. The generally accepted mechanism of -1 PRF is that the mRNA secondary structure directs elongating ribosomes to pause with its A-and P-site bound aminoacyl-(aa-) and peptidyl-tRNAs are positioned over the slippery site. The sequence of the slippery site allows for repairing of the tRNAs to the -1 frame codons after they \"simultaneously slip\" by one base in the 5' direction along the mRNA. The subsequent resolution of the downstream mRNA secondary structure allows the ribosome to continue elongation of the nascent polypeptide in the new translational reading frame. The downstream stimulatory elements are most commonly H-type mRNA pseudoknots, so called because they are composed of two coaxially stacked stem-loops where the second stem is formed by base pairing between sequence in the loop of the first-stem loop, and additional downstream sequence (10). The SARS-CoV pseudoknot is more complex because it contains a third, internal stem-loop element(11)(12)(13).Mutations affecting this structure decreased rates of -1 PRF, and had deleterious effects on virus propagation, thus",

            "text": "-CoV2, the etiological agent of COVID-19, is a member of the coronavirus family (1). Coronaviruses have (+) ssRNA genomes that harbor two long open reading frames (ORF) which occupy the 5' ~ two-thirds of the genomic RNA (ORF1 and ORF2), followed by several ORFs that are expressed late in the viral replication cycle from subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) (Fig. 1A) (2). In general the immediate early proteins encoded by ORF1 are involved in ablating the host cellular innate immune response, while the early proteins encoded in ORF2 are involved in genome replication and RNA synthesis. These functions include generation the minus-strand replicative intermediate, new plus-strand genomic RNAs, and subgenomic RNAs which mostly encode structural, late proteins. ORF2 is out of frame with respect to ORF1, and all coronaviruses utilize a molecular mechanism called programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (-1 PRF) as a means to synthesize the ORF2 encoded proteins (3, 4). -1 PRF is a mechanism in which cis-acting elements in the mRNA direct elongating ribosomes to shift reading frame by 1",
