There is a high homology (69% identical at the protein level) between the 2 isoenzymes. ALT2 has a wider organ distribution, including skeletal muscles and adipose tissue. To date, however, the clinical significance of ALT2 in the diagnosis of liver disease remains to be defined. 8 Aminotransferase activities may be measured by several methods such as chromatography, spectrophotometry, fluorimetry, and colorimetry. 9 Although the assay results may differ slightly according to the method used, there is a high degree of correlation between the 2 most common methods, namely colorimetry and spectrophotometry, particularly near the normal range. 9 Recently, there has been renewed attention about what constitutes the normal range for serum activities of aminotransferase, particularly ALT. Traditionally a level around 40 has been considered the upper limit of normal based on the mean and standard deviation calculated in apparently healthy reference subjects. 9 There is an increasing consensus that the conventional normal range may have been set too high, because the reference subjects presumed to be healthy may have included individuals with asymptomatic liver disease, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and chronic hepatitis C. When more stringent criteria are applied to exclude subjects with a high probability of liver disease, the upper limit of the normal range becomes considerably lower. Prati and colleagues 10 analyzed samples of blood donors carefully selected to exclude those at risk of liver disease by using criteria such as normal body mass index (BMI), normal cholesterol, triglyceride, and glucose levels, and no potentially hepatotoxic medications. The upper limit of normal ALT in that study was determined to be 30 U/L for men and 19 U/L for women. Although these updated normal values are frequently cited, one may note that they way the upper limit of normal was set in that particular study was different from the usual convention. Whereas most laboratory normal ranges are taken from the middle 95%, ie, 2.5th to 97.5th percentiles of the population, Prati and colleagues 10 chose to take the lower 95th percentile as normal. The authors believe that the normal ranges proposed in that study are set too low.",

In other words, normal ALT is not necessarily healthy ALT. In a large population-based study from South Korea, serum ALT activity measured at baseline was correlated with subsequent mortality. In particular, compared with men with ALT less than 20 IU/L, those with ALT of 20 to 29 IU/L had a 2.9-fold increase in liver mortality and those with ALT of 30 to 39 IU/L had a 9.5-fold increase in mortality. 2 The authors also have evaluated ALT and AST activities as a predictor of future mortality. Using population-based data in Olmsted County, AST and ALT results in a given year were correlated with subsequent all-cause mortality. Similar to the data by Kim and colleagues, 3 there was a positive correlation between the standardized mortality ratio and the aminotransferase results. Further, the increase in mortality could be discerned with aminotransferase values less than the upper limit of normal set by the laboratory at that time.",

Several factors such as age, sex, and BMI influence its activities in subjects without known liver disease. 11 In addition, an early study by Friedman showed that ALT elevation was intermittent in 36% and persistent in 28% during up to 7 months of observation. 12 One limitation of the study is that it included a large proportion (63%) of patients who were consuming alcohol regularly, making it possible that not all of the fluctuation of ALT was simply a result of its variability. A subsequent study by Lazo and colleagues 13 investigated variability of liver enzymes using the samples of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Out of nearly 20,000 survey respondents, 1864 had 2 biochemical assessments separated by a mean of 18 days. In the initial testing, 6.2% and 5.9% had abnormal AST and ALT, respectively, using normal ranges defined by the laboratory. Of those with initially elevated results, more than 30% (35.6% for AST and 31.2% for ALT) were reclassified as normal in the follow-up tests. As expected, mildly elevated of AST and ALT were more likely to normalize on repeat testing; most people who transitioned from abnormal to normal had initial elevation within 1.1 to 2.0 times the normal range. Another element of intraindividual variability in aminotransferases is diurnal variation. According to Cordoba and colleagues, 14 ALT level is lowest at night and highest in the afternoon.",

In early NAFLD, ALT is usually higher than AST (AST/ALT < 1). 17 As NAFLD advances and causes liver fibrosis, the AST/ALT ratio reverses to the degree that ALT in patients with cirrhosis from NAFLD may be normal. 18 This trend is reflected in the NAFLD fibrosis score (\u00c01.675 1 0.037 \u00c2 age [years] 1 0.094 \u00c2 BMI [kg/m 2 ] 1 1.13 \u00c2 impaired fasting glucose/diabetes [yes 5 1, no 5 0] 1 0.99 \u00c2 AST/ALT ratio \u00c0 0.013 \u00c2 platelet [\u00c210 9 /L] \u00c0 0.66 \u00c2 albumin [g/dL]), which may be used to estimate liver fibrosis. 19 ",

Idiosyncratic reaction is not very common and, by definition, unpredictable. Essentially any medication can cause idiosyncratic reaction, including over-thecounter medications such as ranitidine. The latent period can be up to several months before the onset of idiosyncratic features. 25, 26 Occasionally DILI may be accompanied by a hypersensitivity reaction (ie, fever, rash, eosinophilia). 24 These characteristics of DILI make its diagnosis sometimes difficult -careful history taking with a high index of suspicion is needed for the diagnosis. Liver biopsies have a limited role in the diagnosis and differential diagnosis of DILI, because histologic features of DILI are often nonspecific and not distinguishable from those of viral or immune-mediated injury. 27 Careful exclusion of other diagnoses and assessing response to withdrawal of the suspected drug constitute an important diagnostic and therapeutic step. Rechallenge of the offending drug is reserved for selected situations whereby the benefit of the drug outweighs the risk of potentially severe hepatotoxicity.",

Among these, hepatitis A and E viruses cause acute infection, whereas hepatitis B, C, and Hepatitis A can be diagnosed with the detection of immunoglobulin M (IgM) antihepatitis A virus (HAV) in serum. 28 The diagnosis of hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is usually made by the detection of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), although sometimes anti-hepatitis B core antibodies may be the only clue to the diagnosis. 23 Hepatitis D virus (HDV) can replicate only in a host with HBV infection. HDV RNA by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most reliable test. IgM or immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-HDV can be used, whose sensitivity is less than that of the HDV RNA RT-PCR method. 29, 30 Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection can be screened by anti-HCV antibodies and confirmed with HCV RNA detection. 31 For the diagnosis of hepatitis E virus (HEV), anti-HEV antibodies (IgM/IgG) may be used. However, the availability of tests for HEV has been limited in the United States. 32 Systemic infections with viruses such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV), herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV), and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, may cause elevated aminotransferase. Aminotransferase elevation caused by EBV is usually seen in conjunction with acute mononucleosis. It is usually self-limited, even though chronic infection is possible. 33 Similarly, in immunecompetent hosts, CMV infection presents as subclinical or mild symptomatic cases and resolves by itself. CMV infection is more serious in immune-compromised hosts, including patients with AIDS and solid organ recipients, in whom disseminated infection may cause major organ damage or mortality. 34 HSV hepatitis is most commonly seen in neonatal, pregnant, or immune-compromised patients. Many cases present with fulminant hepatitis with high mortality. 35 ",

Because it is not increased in bone disease, a concomitant elevation of alkaline phosphatase and GGT would suggest a hepatobiliary source rather than a skeletal source. The other common use of GGT is in patients with suspected ALD, as GGT can be induced by alcohol ingestion. Medications such as barbiturates and phenytoin may also increase GGT, presumably by the same mechanism. Recently, several reports correlated elevated GGT with increased mortality. Compared with reference populations with normal GGT, those with increased GGT had higher mortality from liver disease, cancer, and diabetes, as well as cardiac disease. 51, 52 Because of the nonspecific nature of serum alkaline phosphatase and GGT results, greater than 1.5 times that of upper limit of alkaline phosphatase and greater than 3 times that of GGT have been suggested as thresholds for a diagnostic workup in asymptomatic patients. 44 Careful history and physical examination is the first step in evaluation, together with abdominal ultrasonography. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) as well as serum markers such as antimitochondrial antibody can be used for the evaluation of the hepatobiliary system.
