To mitigate the problem, application of some innovative air filtering devices has been generally recognized as one of the effective ways. This study adopted an action research-dominated approach to test whether the indoor air quality in the tested hotel rooms meets the recognized standard, and measure the pollutant removal efficiency of three types of air purifiers. Focus group discussion was carried out to ascertain the difference in hotel managers' understanding of indoor air quality research before the experiment and management response after the experiment. The result of field test indicates that the actual performance of the purifiers is not as good as the manufactures claim. The management response study also ascertains that hotel department heads' awareness, exposure and training in relation to IAQ testing is limited.",

Many researchers have identified that cleanliness is the most important attribute influencing the decision of selecting hotel accommodation (Weaver and Oh, 1993; Callan and Bowman, 2000; Lockyer, 2005) . Therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that good indoor air quality (IAQ) should also be an important attribute for hotels. This is especially true as hotel guests typically comprise a high proportion of international travelers and a good mix of dignitaries and officials who demand high IAQ. Equally, inadequate IAQ invariably brings complaints (Bohdanowicz and Martinac, 2002) .",

            "text": "generally considered to be the most robust indicator of adverse (mortality) impacts in epidemiologic cohort studies of long-term exposure. They are so small that they can get deep into the lungs and cause serious health problems. An extensive epidemiological literature relates PM2.5 to adverse health impacts (Pope et al., 2002; Pope and Dockery, 2006; Dockery, 2009) . Latterly, the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) officially classified air pollution mixing with suspended particles in the air as a level 1 carcinogen. It stated that there is \"sufficient evidence\" that exposure to outdoor air pollution causes lung cancer and also linked it with an increased risk of bladder cancer. Such exposure has increased significantly in China (IARC, 2013) . Since the ventilation systems need to regularly draw outdoor air into buildings, hotel guests who staying indoor still have to breathe the polluted outdoor air if there is no air filtration equipment in hotels. Therefore, travelers who plan to come to China are increasingly concerned about air quality. According to the China National Tourism Administration, from January to June in 2013, the total number of foreign arrivals dropped by 5% to just under 13 million compared with the same period in 2012 (Watt, 2013) . There are also other types of indoor air pollution in China apart from such incoming outdoor air pollutants. One of them is smoking. In China, smoking in hotel guest rooms still prevails except on non-smoking floors. Cigarettes generate high amounts of toxic air pollutants which also include PM2.5. These pollutants may be carcinogenic, or may cause other non cancer-related health problems (Facchini et al., 1992; Rimm et al., 1993; Hu et al., 2001; Komiya et al., 2006) . The other possible source for indoor air pollution in hotels is renovation. As stated by Meckler (1996) , renovation work could be the greatest source of IAQ problems for buildings. Many interior materials contain volatile organic compounds (VOCs) which cause discomfort to the respiratory system and irritation to eyes (Burton, 1997) . The increasing occurrence of poor levels of IAQ may be linked to the shortening length of the renovation cycle in hotels in recent years, and the opening of more new hotels which is set to grow further in coming years. One study has indicated that most new hotels in the Pearl River Delta of China were more polluted than older hotels and residential buildings (Chan et al., 2009a,b) . In addition, poorly designed, maintained or operated air-conditioning and ventilation systems can also cause indoor air problems (Kuo et al., 2008) . Many studies have shown that ventilation systems may occasionally act as a source of pollutants, such as microbes, chemical compounds or odors (Lysne et al., 1999; Sundell et al., 1993; Bj\u00f6rkroth et al., 1997) .",

Since then, this concept has become divided into a wide spectrum of approaches including action research, action science, system intervention and action inquiry (List, 2006) . Our investigation is characterized by the involvement of researchers with a goal to achieve an enhancement of hotel IAQ by using air purification technology in the studied hotel (Baskerville and Wood-Harper, 1996; Baskerville and Pries-Heje, 1999) . Differing from the typical consultancy approach and that of contracted research, which usually provides technical or specific deliverables, the action research in this case set out to collect hoteliers' real responses by direct observation and discussion via participation. The follow-through participation process included initiating the project, participating in meetings, exchanging views, installing air purifiers, cleaning air ducts, providing technical and professional knowledge guidance, checking equipment performance, collecting data, performing analysis, delivering findings and gauging management response. Through the process, researchers were able to professionalize the hotel department heads using three technical meetings, seven semi-technical meetings, six informal discussions and one \"wrap-up\" focus group discussion. The researchers' aim was to produce valid knowledge and act as a facilitator by proposing the topic, formulating the action research scenarios and compiling all the collected data (Waser and Johns, 2003) . More importantly, the use of action research allowed the investigators to gain an in-depth and thorough understanding of how the company's management responded to the processes and findings about the application of air-cleaning technology. Compared with other techniques, which use questionnaires and interviews to obtain responses, the action research methodology in this case may greatly reduce \"noise\" in the data collection process and ensure a high degree of data reality.",

The international hotel selected is a 27-storey building with a vertical ventilation system. The air pump is located in the roof of the hotel building, meaning that the lower the floor is the less fresh air it receives. These rooms are all standard two-bed rooms with separated fan coil units (FCU). The room area is about 40 m 2 with most of the floor covered by carpet, which is a potential pollutant source for total volatile organic compounds (TVOC), except the entrance area and wash room which are paved with marble. The hotel had 22 guest floors and 8 of them were non-smoking floors. Our study was taken in a non-smoking floor. Three types of air cleaners and the effectiveness of air duct cleaning were tested in this research. Due to the restriction of the field condition, the air duct cleaning is confined to the cleaning of the air duct in the sampled rooms only. L brand fixed air cleaner was installed on the ceiling of Room 1 in front of the fresh air supply duct. L brand movable air cleaner and P brand movable air cleaner were placed in the corner of Room 2 and Room 3 respectively. The remaining room, Room 4, was used to test air duct cleaning. Specifications of the three air cleaners are listed in Table 1 . All the air cleaners and associated filters are brand new before testing. Currently there is no compulsory national standard on for air purifiers in China, therefore many air purifier manufactures have taken advantages of this loophole and failed to accurately inform consumers about the functions and capabilities of their products. In this study, both L brand and P brand are vague about their product specifications in terms of removal efficiency. Information about under what conditions for efficiency are not available in their product manuals.",

For measuring the TVOC, A ppbRAE 3000 monitor was used for continuous recording of TVOC concentrations for eight hours. The ppbRAE 3000 can detect a very wide range of VOCs, including benzene, isobutene, methylene chloride, hexane, toluene, trichloroethane, styrene, heptane, perchloroethylene, and etc. The lamp and sensor of ppbRAE 3000 were manually cleaned before the testing in order to avoid the drift of photoionization detector. Prior to sampling, the ppbRAE 3000 monitor was calibrated by a calibration gas (isobutylene) with a known concentration of 10 ppm supplied by the manufacturer. For individual VOC sampling, a canister sampling method was used. A batch of pre-cleaned canisters for sample collection was evacuated before sampling. Time-integrated VOC air samples were obtained by using mass flow controllers at a flow rate of 0.0042 l/min for 8 h. After sampling, the canisters were immediately transported to an authorized air laboratory supplier for GC/MS (gas chromatography/mass selective) analysis. A NUTECH Cryogenic Concentrator was used for sample pre-concentration and followed by an Agilent 6890/5873 GC/MSD system to conduct the analysis.

The background level of TVOC in the studied rooms ranging from 116 to 185 ppb, which are far lower than those measurements (1035 g/m 3 \u2248 260 ppb) in earlier studies in eight hotels in factory region (Chan et al., 2009a,b) . When the result was compared with the TVOC findings (62 g/m 3 and 120 g/m 3 \u2248 16 ppb and 30 ppb) in home and hostels, the study observed that the result is higher than the measured levels of TVOC in homes and hostels (Kumar et al., 2014) . This is probably due to the use of more decorative materials with adhesive agents. Because there are indoor TVOC pollutant sources and the air conditioning was turned off for movable air cleaners, another method of calculating the removal efficiency of air cleaners was employed in this study, as shown in Table 5 . The TVOC accumulation rate was measured before and after running the air cleaners. Table 5 illustrates the rate of increase of TVOC levels in tested rooms when the ventilation system was shut down. Thus it could be deduced that there is an indoor source of TVOC in these two rooms. It could also be observed that both air cleaners were slowing down the increase rate of TVOC in rooms. L brand movable air cleaner removed the TVOC concentration by 67.8 ppb per hour, while the P brand movable air cleaner reduced the TVOC concentration by 102.2 ppb per hour.",

The measured data are shown in Table 6 and these results indicate that the microbial pollution in guest rooms could be controlled by air cleaners. Before running the air cleaners, the highest concentrations of bacteria and fungi were both found in Room 1, at 930 cfu/m 3 and 670 cfu/m 3 respectively. After running the air cleaner for 24 h, the concentrations dropped to 460 cfu/m 3 and 340 cfu/m 3 , which were below the recommended values. In addition, the values for outdoor bacteria and fungi concentrations were generally higher than the indoor concentrations, which indicated that these microbial pollutions were more serious in the outdoor environment than in the indoor space. The bacteria and fungi in rooms are more likely to be transferred from the outdoor environment, rather than originating indoors. It should be noticed that the bacteria concentration in Room 3 increased after the cleaner had been running. Considering that the TVOC level in Room 3 also increased after running the P brand air cleaner, it is likely that the P brand movable air cleaner in Room 3 had reached its saturation and was releasing trapped pollutants back into the indoor air. This reflects the main problem with mechanical filters that they act as a pollution source if they are not properly used (Zhang et al., 2011) .",
