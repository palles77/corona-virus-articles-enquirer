We report the synthesis and evaluation of triazole-containing compounds able to bind the FSS with high affinity and selectivity. Readily accessible synthetically, these compounds are less toxic than previously reported olefin congeners. We show for the first time that FSS-targeting compounds have antiviral activity against replication-competent HIV in human cells, including a highly cytopathic, multidrug-resistant strain. These results support the viability of the HIV-1 FSS RNA as a therapeutic target and more generally highlight opportunities for synthetic molecule-mediated interference with protein recoding in a wide range of organisms.",

            "text": "T here is a rapidly expanding recognition that RNA is of high significance as a therapeutic target. 1, 2 In addition to the importance of coding regions of mRNA, noncoding RNA sequences (including miRNA, lncRNA, and others) and structured, regulatory regions of RNA found within coding sequences have been demonstrated to have critical roles in human health and disease. Recent work has revealed the utility of RNA-targeted compounds in the treatment of splicing diseases, 3\u22128 and as candidate antibiotics via modulation of bacterial riboswitch activity. 9 Finally, RNAs of potential therapeutic significance have also been identified in pathogenic agents, including viruses such as HIV, SARS, and HTLV. 10 One RNA sequence that is particularly attractive both as a model system for fundamental studies of RNA-targeted compound design and as a potential drug target is a highly stable RNA hairpin that serves as a regulatory element in the translation of Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins in HIV-1. 11, 12 Specifically, the mRNA encoding these proteins carries a stop codon at the end of the gag gene. In a significant majority of cases (90\u221295%), the ribosome reads to the end of the gag reading frame, reaches this stop codon, and produces only Gag, a polyprotein that is further processed to yield HIV-1 structural proteins. However, in approximately 5\u221210% of all gag-pol mRNA translation events, interaction of the ribosome with a particular stemloop within the gag-pol transcript (the HIV-1 Frameshift Stimulating Stemloop, or HIV-1 FSS RNA) causes it to slip back one nucleotide on an upstream U-rich \"slippery sequence\" (Figure 1 ). When the ribosome resumes the process 25 The slippery sequence is indicated in red, and the frameshift-stimulating stemloop (FSS) employed in these studies is highlighted with a yellow box. of translation, it does so in a new reading frame (a \u22121 ribosomal frameshift 13 ). As such, it no longer recognizes the gag stop codon and instead continues to process the mRNA until full-length Gag-Pol is produced. Pol consists of vital enzymes of HIV-1 including HIV protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase. It is absolutely required for the production of infectious virons. Although a detailed mechanism of frameshifting remains elusive, the high conservation of the FSS RNA sequence in HIV-1 isolates 14 combined with experimental work demonstrating changes in frameshifting frequency as a function of mutations to this RNA 15, 16 suggest that its presence and structure are critical. Alterations in the Gag:Gag-Pol ratio in either direction have been found to substantially reduce the infectivity of product virions. Thus, compounds able to bind this RNA and influence frameshifting have been posited as a new class of anti-HIV agents. 11, 12 To address the general problem of identifying selective binders for biomedically relevant RNA targets, we have developed a discovery protocol based on initial rapid identification of hit molecules using Resin-Bound Dynamic Combinatorial Chemistry (RBDCC) 17, 18 followed by an iterative medicinal chemistry approach to affinity maturation. As part of this process, it is necessary to convert the disulfide moiety used as a \"mutatable\" group in RBDCC to a nonreducible functional group suitable for further studies in a biological context. Thus far, we have focused on the use of olefins as disulfide isosteres (or, more appropriately, \"bioisosteres\" 19 since the geometry is by no means identical). This strategy has resulted in compounds with relevant activity in vitro and in vivo, including compounds targeting the HIV-1 FSS. 20\u221222 Our prior efforts toward enhancing the affinity and selectivity of HIV-1 FSS-targeted compounds via directed analog synthesis culminated in the recent disclosure of a series of N-methyl amides with exceptionally high affinity to and selectivity for the FSS RNA. 22 Compound 2, for example ( Figure 2 ), was found to have a dissociation constant (K D ) for the FSS RNA of 13.0 \u00b1 5.0 nM via surface plasmon resonance, approximately 5-fold tighter binding than 1. Compound 2 was also found to inhibit HIV infectivity in a pseudotyped (singlecycle) HIV assay. We have also successfully employed this approach to address a sequence of relevance to triplet repeatmediated splicing disease (Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1, DM1), 23 yielding compounds with activity in a DM1 mouse model. 24 While the affinities and activities of RNA-binding compounds we have synthesized to date incorporating an olefin bioisostere have been encouraging, we sought an alternative disulfide replacement that would permit simpler and more readily scalable synthesis. To that end, the 1,4-triazole substructure seemed particularly attractive, given the highly robust metal-catalyzed Huisgen cycloaddition conditions that have been developed for its synthesis. 26, 27 Despite the immense body of literature on the use of triazoles in chemistry, including in peptidomimetics, 28, 29 and in RNA-binding compounds, 30\u221232 there are relatively few examples of this substructure serving as a bioisosteric replacement for a disulfide. In addition to its first reported use in 2004, 33 Suga and colleagues successfully employed intramolecular triazole formation as a disulfide replacement in the context of bicyclic peptides, 34 and a ruthenium-catalyzed cyclization strategy has been described by the Kolmar group for the synthesis of 1,5-disubstituted triazole analogs of cyclic disulfide-containing trypsin inhibitors. 35 In the latter case, inhibitory activity of the triazole peptidomimetic was found to be similar to that of the parent disulfide. Subtle differences between the native disulfide and isosteric triazole have also been reported to have a negative effect on biological activity, however, causing unfolding of insulin glargine analogs. 36 The structural similarities of 1,4-disubsituted triazoles, disubstituted olefins, and disulfides are readily apparent from DFT calculations ( Figure 2) ; however, differences are also obvious. With its calculated local minimum 86.6\u00b0torsional angle, consistent with the well-established reference value of 90\u00b0for L-cystine, 37 the disulfide bond torsional landscape is quite different from either the olefin or triazole. The distance between flanking alpha carbons is most similar for the trans olefin (5.77 \u00c5 vs 5.74 \u00c5 for the disulfide). This distance is slightly shorter for the cis olefin (5.32 \u00c5), and over an \u00c5ngstrom longer for the triazole (6.94 \u00c5). Electrostatic potential surfaces are also quite different for the three substructures, with the triazole presenting the most overall negatively charged surface. Nonetheless, pendant functionality is capable of being positioned in a similar orientation, and thus we anticipated that the 1,4-triazole would be a suitable disulfide and olefin substitute in HIV-1 FSS binding compounds.",

Therefore, we measured binding constants by surface plasmon resonance (SPR; Table 1 ). In this assay, RNA is immobilized on the SPR chip while the compound is flowed through in solution. This allows for determination of kinetic rate constants of binding as well as thermodynamic parameters. 39 A comparison of the measured affinities for 1 and 3 indicates that substitution of triazole for olefin has no effect on affinity (within error). N-methylation of 3 had only a modest effect on affinity; compound 7 displayed the highest affinity with a binding constant 6-fold tighter than 3. As with previously described N-methyl amide analogs such as 2, affinity enhancements are largely driven by an increase in on-rate (k a ). This is consistent with the hypothesis that N-methylation reduces the complexity of the ground state conformational ensemble and favors a conformer or conformers able to bind the RNA, and with the known propensity of N-methylation to alter peptide conformation. 40 In order to test selectivity, SPR measurements were made using a competitive assay, in which a mixture of the compound plus a 5-fold excess of yeast tRNA (relative to compound concentration) in solution was flowed over the SPR chip. Of course, this constitutes an even larger excess of tRNA over the amount of HIV-1 FSS RNA immobilized on the sensor chip, and as such represents a stringent assay. We observed that, of the compounds tested, only 7 showed a significant change in K D in the presence of tRNA.",

Error is derived as the standard deviation from the mean of the averaged individual fits. a spread of toxicities. Differences between compounds 5 and 6 were particularly unexpected as these compounds are chemically similar; while compound 5 has a toxic dose, TD 50 , of \u2265110 \u03bcM, compound 6 was found to be roughly twice as toxic (TD 50 = 60 \u03bcM). Flow cytometry revealed that the permeability of triazole analogs largely followed their methylation pattern, with tetra-N-methyl compound 7 displaying the greatest cell permeability, and the non-N-methylated compound 3 the least (Supporting Information). These results are consistent with trends previously observed for compounds 1 (unmethylated olefin) and 2 (tetramethylated olefin), which are provided in the figure for reference. We further evaluated compound selectivity by examining the effect of 0, 6.83, and 20 \u03bcM concentrations of compound 7 on HEK293T cells by RNaseq. A total of 17 872 transcripts were analyzed for each condition. The set of significantly altered genes relative to control (0 \u03bcM compound) for the two concentrations was compared using the Web tool Interacti-Venn. 42 One of the 6.83 \u03bcM-treated samples behaved as an outlier, and therefore the analysis was conducted both with and without considering this sample. Disregarding the outlier sample revealed 53 transcripts with a statistically significant change in both the 6.8 and 20 \u03bcM compound-treated conditions ( Figure 4 ). Of these, only two showed a greater than 2-fold change (considered biologically significant 4 ) in both sets: Genbank IDs RWDD4P2 and ElF4A1P2, both pseudogenes. Inclusion of the outlier sample in the analysis resulted in only a subset (13) of these transcripts called differentially expressed. Therefore, although we cannot a priori conclude that inclusion of the outlier is not biologically relevant, its exclusion produces the most conservative estimate of compound 7's effect on HEK293T cells. The 20 \u03bcM-treated samples showed a few additional transcripts with significant changes. These included the expressed genes early growth response 1 (EGR1; log 2 (fold change) = 1.69), microtubule associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta 2 (MAP1LC3B2; log 2 (fold change) = 5.56), phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase type 2 beta (PI4KIIB; log 2 (fold change) = \u22121.66), and ubiquitin specific peptidase 41 (USP41; log 2 (fold change = \u22127.85). While the tested concentration is lower than that at which changes in WST-1 metabolism indicative of toxicity were observed (vide supra) for compound 7, these additional changes may reflect compounddependent increases in cell stress and will be examined further. Overall, however, the low number of significantly altered transcripts, and in particular the near absence of expressed genes altered, highlights the selectivity of compound 7 despite its status as the least-selective of the triazole analogs studied, based on tRNA competition SPR.",

Cotransfection of a vesicular stomatitis virus type G (VSV-G) plasmid provides the envelope functionality in trans to enable production of single-cycle infectious virions. Visualizing GFP production through fluorescence microscopy also allows for a qualitative assessment of virion production in producer cells. Virions produced after a 24-h incubation with various concentrations of compounds were harvested and used to infect TZM-bl reporter cells with virion quantities first normalized via a p24 ELISA assay. TZM-bl cells express luciferase upon infection with HIV 44 (via the HIV LTR promoter), providing a quantitative readout of infectivity. Indinavir, an FDA-approved protease inhibitor, 45 was employed as a positive control. We observed that compounds 3\u22127 substantially decreased virion production in a concentration dependent manner, as evidenced by a decrease in GFP fluorescence (Supporting Information).

In preliminary experiments with compounds 2, 3, and 7, one-half of the medium was harvested at 2 days postinfection and replaced with an equivalent volume of medium \u00b1 compound. The medium removed was examined for viral particles using a p24 ELISA assay. This procedure was repeated at days 4 and 6 postinfection. These experiments revealed a dose-and time-dependent inhibition of HIV IIIB for all three compounds (Supporting Information), with very low (compound 3) or undetectable (compounds 5 and 7) levels of virus present for the highest doses at days 4 and 6 postinfection. Subsequently, full dose\u2212response profiles were obtained for compounds 3, 4, 5, and 7, at 6 days postinfection ( Figure 6 ). IC 50 values were obtained via four-parameter logistic fits of these data. They indicate similar potencies for 3, 4, and 5 (15.33, 10.17, and 14.23 \u03bcM, respectively), and a somewhat higher potency for compound 7 (4.86 \u03bcM). Decreases in virus were not due to inhibition of cell growth; indeed, more cells were present in the compound-treated wells than in the untreated but virus-infected wells at day 6 (Supporting Information), as measured by Alamar blue assay. This effect is striking and consistent with compound-mediated protection from virus-induced apoptosis. Such an effect has been seen with other anti-HIV agents. 51 Compound 7 proved toxic to HIVinfected MT-2 cells at concentrations above 15 \u03bcM.",

Our past work demonstrated the feasibility of degrading the infectivity of pseudotyped HIV via FSS RNA-targeted compounds. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that this strategy can also yield compounds able to strongly inhibit replication of a laboratory strain of HIV in human T cells, and one compound inhibits a highly cytopathic, multidrug-resistant strain. This is a critical step in the validation of the HIV-1 FSS RNA as a therapeutic target. It is also important to note that frameshifting is not limited to HIV-1. It is widely used in many pathogenic viruses (for example, the SARS coronavirus 55,56 and HTLV-2 57 ) and also in eukaryotes, including humans. 58, 13, 59 These recoding processes are all possible control points for driving therapeutic outcomes. As such, the approach we have applied to frameshifting in HIV-1 should be extendable to synthetic molecule control over a broad range of recoding events. In the broader context of RNA recognition, this work also demonstrates that the use of 1,4-disubsituted triazoles as disulfide bioisosteres is effective.",
