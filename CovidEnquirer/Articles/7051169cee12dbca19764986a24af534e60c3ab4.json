            "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the major immune-mediated demyelinating human disease, affecting more than 2.5 million people [1] . It is characterized by varying amounts of demyelination, remyelination, inflammation, gliosis and axonal injury [1, 2] . In the majority of patients, the disease starts with a relapsing course (relapsing/remitting MS), followed by a progressive phase (secondary progressive MS) years later. In other patients, the relapsing form is missing and the disease is progressive right from the beginning (primary progressive MS). The mechanisms responsible for lesion induction and progression are complex and heterogeneous, and likely reflect different causes and immunopathogenetic mechanisms [3, 4]. A pathohistological comparison revealed that while focal, heavily inflamed, white matter plaques dominate in acute, relapsing MS, a more diffuse inflammatory process that affects the whole central nervous system is associated with massive cortical demyelination and diffuse axonal injury in progressive MS [5]. Based on these findings, Lassmann suggested that progression to progressive MS is associated with the development of a compartmentalized immune response, including intrathecal antibody production trapped behind a closed blood-brain barrier [6, 7]. The currently available antiinflammatory, immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapies which successfully reduce the severity and rate of relapses, however, frequently fail to prevent clinical and pathological deterioration of patients with progressive MS [6].",

Conclusively, although transcriptional changes were dominated by the adaptive immune response, the main pathways associated with demyelination included up-regulation of toll-like receptor 4 and down-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis. Cholesterol biosynthesis is a rate limiting step of myelination and its down-regulation is suggested to be involved in chronic demyelination by an inhibition of remyelination.",

The recent demonstration of early onset axonal pathology in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis led to the conclusion, that Wallerian-type primary axonal pathology due to neuronal death in the acute polioencephalitic phase of the disease induces the first foci of inflammation and myelin breakdown in the spinal cord [11, 12] . Subsequently, a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction develops against the virus [13] , which triggers a cascade of events in which pro-inflammatory cytokines released from virus-specific CD4 \u03e9 T cells cause macrophage-induced bystander demyelination and release of endogenous myelin antigens [14] . Tissue damage and demyelination are exacerbated due to epitope spreading of CD4 \u03e9 T cells and delayed type hypersensitivity reaction against myelin epitopes [15] . It has been shown that macrophages are of special importance in the pathogenesis of demyelination in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis. They represent the main antigen presenting cells [16] , important effector cells of the delayed type hypersensitivity reaction [17] [18] [19] and the main reservoir for virus persistence [20] . Similarly in many chronic MS cases, remyelination is sparse or absent in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis, despite the presence of intralesional oligodendroglial progenitor cells [10, 21] . In contrast to Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis, a fast and complete remyelination occurs in most other models of MS [22] [23] [24] [25] . Rodriguez suggested that the balance of de-and remyelination ultimately determines the outcome of an acute attack in MS and, possibly, the development of secondary progressive disease [3] . We recently reported that the failure of remyelination is due to an inhibited differentiation of oligodendroglial progenitor cells in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis [10] . Possible differentiation-inhibiting mechanisms include a non-permissive environment, axonal loss or the inability of chronically demyelinated axons to be remyelinated [26, 27] .",

A comparison of the target sequence of the probe set with the murine nucleotide sequences stored in the GenBank employing BLASTN 2.2.19\u03e9 revealed a 100% homology of the target sequence with either IgG2c and IgG2a [41] . Thereby it was demonstrated that Affymetrix probe set 1425385_a_at cannot differentiate between the expression of IgG2c and IgG2a. The k-means cluster II included 57 genes which were up-regulated from 14 to 196 dpi. The genes within this cluster demonstrated high fold changes, but in contrast to k-means cluster I, a more pronounced peak at 98 dpi ( Fig. 4A and B) . The genes belonging to k-means cluster II were significantly enriched in gene ontology terms related to the immune response, defence response, antigen processing and presentation of exogenous peptide antigen via MHC class II and response to other organisms (Table 1) .

Furthermore the MBP \u03e9 white matter area was assessed, to quantify the amount of demyelination (Fig. 5E ). Immunohistochemistry displayed multifocal to coalescing parenchymal inflammatory infiltrates as well as a progressively decreasing MBP immunoreactivity (Fig. 6) (Fig. 5A-D) . The MBP \u03e9 area was significantly decreased at 196 dpi in TMEVinfected compared to mock-infected mice (Fig. 5E) . The mean amount of each cell type or investigated protein was correlated to the respective gene expression employing Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, using the data from both groups and all four experimental days (n \u03ed 47; Table 3) . Notably, the genes coding for the analysed proteins were all contained in the list of the 1001 differentially expressed genes (Table S1 ). All investigated genes displayed a significant, moderate to high, positive correlation between the level of transcription and the amount of the corresponding antigen, substantiating the microarray results (Table 3) . (FCGR1, FCGR3, FCER1G) , and complement components 1 (C1) and 3 (C3) . These results strongly support the recent observation of a robust intrathecal production of IgG antibodies by CD138 \u03e9 plasma cells in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis [45] . Furthermore, a local antibody production seems to be the best explanation for the higher antibody titres in the CNS compared to serum in about one-third of mice 3 weeks after TMEV infection [46] . The relative higher up-regulation of IgG2c compared to IgG1 in the present study could be an indirect hint towards a Th1-type response [40, 47] . Although detectable in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis in vivo, a contribution of anti-MBP antibodies to demyelination is unlikely [48, 49] . In contrast, a monoclonal antibody raised against TMEV was shown to be myelinotoxic due to cross-reaction with galactocerebroside of the myelin sheaths [50, 51] . Antibodies against galactocerebroside were also detected in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis, in vivo.",

            "text": "from the spinal cord of mice with Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis is well documented [58] . The importance of MHC class II expression for virus clearance in the acute phase of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis is shown by the occurrence of a severe polioencephalitis in MHC class II deficient mice [59] . In contrast, MHC class II restricted presentation of myelin epitopes could be a key event in the stimulation of autoreactive B cells. Similar to the present study, up-regulation of MHC class II molecules has been observed in MS and EAE [56] . The upregulation of antigen processing and presentation via MHC class II molecules, and the humoural immune response within the demyelinated spinal cord in this study is in agreement with the hypothesis formulated by Lassmann that a local immune reaction trapped behind a closed blood-brain barrier represents a key pathomechanism in progressive MS [6] . The presented analysis of microarray experiments employing sequential significance analysis, clustering and detection of significantly enriched pathways has the advantage of providing a broad overview of the main transcriptional events at a low and controlled error rate of 1.0% false positives, but it does not directly link the transcriptional changes to the observed pathology. Therefore we used an alternative approach employing a recently developed random forest machine learning algorithm, which directly detects pathways related to demyelination as observed by MBP immunohistology [37, 60] . Accordingly, lipid, sterol and cholesterol biosynthesis, neurite morphogenesis and TLR4-induced immune reactions showed intimate associations to demyelination in this study. The observed down-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis is suggested to be directly linked to chronic demyelination, possibly by inhibition of remyelination. The down-regulated genes CYP51, DHCR7, DHCR24, FDFT1, FDPS, IDI1, NSDHL and SQLE are members of the mevalonate pathway downstream of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase and represent potent therapeutic targets for cholesterol-lowering agents [61] . Notably, the genes with the highest importance scores for cholesterol biosynthesis identified by LeFE (DHCR7, FDPS, NSDHL) displayed q-values above the 0.01 threshold employed in significance analysis, highlighting the fact that both approaches use independent criteria for pathway selection. Similar to the present study, a microarray analysis of MS cases revealed down-regulations of multiple genes related to lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis and specific myelin proteins, suggesting not only reduced levels of myelin but also a reduced capacity for repair [55] . Another microarray study of progressive MS revealed a down-regulation of DHCR7 not only in the lesions but additionally in the normal appearing white matter, suggesting that the downregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis precedes demyelination [54] . At least 70% of myelin dry weight consists of lipids, especially cholesterol [62] , and cholesterol availability represents a rate limiting factor for myelination [63] . Mice with a conditional FDFT1 mutation in oligodendrocytes display a robust quantitative impairment of myelination without ultrastructural defects or massive biochemical alterations of the generated myelin [63] . Mice with generally disrupted cholesterol biosynthesis, like DHCR7 -/mice show severe malformations of the central nervous system and die soon after birth [64] . In accordance with our hypothesis, that the down-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis is the primary cause for chronic demyelination by an inhibition of remyelination, this study also showed a progressive down-regulation of MBP mRNA and antigen, as reported previously for Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis [10, 65] [43] . The present study showed an association between demyelination and multiple categories centred on an up-regulated TLR4 expression. In the normal human central nervous system TLR4 expression is restricted to microglia, whereas in MS lesions microglia/macrophage as well as astrocytic expression is described [68] . In contrast, TLR4 expression has been observed in meninges, choroid plexus and circumventricular organs in the normal rat brain. However, after LPS stimulation TLR4 was also detected in rat microglial cells [69] . Activation of TLR4 in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis is suggested to be induced through damage-associated molecular patterns (alarmins) such as high mobility group box protein-1 and S100 proteins from necrotic cells and fragmented hyaluronic acid from the extracellular matrix [70] [71] [72] . Interestingly TLR-4 is known to promote precursor B cell maturation, and could be a potential co-stimulatory signal for the marked up-regulation of the intrathecal humoural immune response already described in the current study [73] . Furthermore, activation of macrophages through TLR4 induces TNF-\u2423 expression [74] . Notably in this study, two clusters of functionally related genes were found to be involved in processes which activate pathways resulting in the formation of TNF. TNF-\u2423signalling represents a well-described pathway leading to a downregulation of myelin synthesis and oligodendrocyte apoptosis [75] [76] [77] . TLR4-mediated microglial activation in vitro leads to enhanced oligodendroglial and neuronal toxicity [78] . In contrast, the outcome of TLR4 activation of microglia/macrophages in vivo is more complex and can be rather beneficial [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] . For example, TLR4-activated microglia induce the proliferation of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in vivo [82] . Further studies are needed to elucidate the role of TLR4 in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis.",

Alternatively, a differential expression of genes related to neurite morphogenesis can also result from secondary axonal pathology or disturbances in the cholesterol metabolism [64] . The presented results are in accordance with a microarray study from progressive MS, which revealed many differentially expressed genes operative in neural homeostasis [54] . Another microarray study of MS revealed that neuron-specific genes are generally decreased in the lesions [55] . Interestingly the most important genes in the categories neurite morphogenesis and axonogenesis included the diffusible guidance protein NTNG1, which is involved in the pathogenesis of neural malformations in DHCR7 -/mice, which display a lacking cholesterol biosynthesis [64] . However, further studies are needed to explain the observed changes and to assess their relationship to early onset (primary) and secondary axonal injury in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis.",

            "text": "In this study, IgG \u03e9 cells displayed the highest negative correlation to MBP gene expression (r \u03ed -0.690), pointing towards an association between the humoural immune response and demyelination. Since the employed polyclonal goat antimouse IgG (H \u03e9 L)-antibody reacts with the heavy and light chains, it is assumed to cross-react with all classes of immunoglobulins. Therefore, the immunohistologically detected IgG \u03e9 cells include both plasma cells as well as B cells. Furthermore, positive labelling of other cells bearing surface bound immunoglobulis has to be taken into account and may contribute to the marked difference observed in the numbers of IgG \u03e9 cells and CD45R/B220 \u03e9 B lymphocytes in the present study [84] . Especially the presence of autoreactive anti-galactocerebroside antibodies bound to oligodendrocytes and myelin and immunoglobulins reacting with Fc-receptors on macrophages should be taken into consideration [50, 51] . Furthermore CD107b \u03e9 cells displayed the second highest negative correlation to MBP gene expression (r \u03ed -0.649). The antigen detected by the employed monoclonal rat antimouse CD107b antibody is a lysosome-associated membrane protein also known as LAMP-2 or Mac-3, with an especially high expression in macrophages and granulocytes [85, 86] . Granulocytes can be easily detected based on their nuclear morphology and are not involved in the inflammatory process in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis. We could not detect a significant amount of CD107b \u03e9 microglia or other cells within the spinal cord parenchyma of mock-infected control mice. Similarly, no definitive microglial expression was demonstrated in another immunohistological study describing the tissue distribution of Mac-3 [87] . However, Mac-3 \u03e9 resident microglial cells were non-enzymatically isolated from mouse brains by others [88] . We assume that the CD107b \u03e9 cells detected in the present study are most likely bloodborne macrophages, which are known to play a key role in TMEV persistence and demyelination [20, 89] . In summary, this study revealed that most of the transcriptional changes in Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis are upregulations in the chronic phase of the disease, functionally related to the adaptive immune response. Furthermore, we provided evidence that intrathecal antibody production contributes to the pathogenesis of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis. However, the processes with the highest association to demyelination included a down-regulation of lipid and cholesterol biosynthesis, an upregulation of innate TLR-4 triggered immune responses and differentially expressed neurite morphogenesis. Based on these findings we suggest that a down-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis may be the rate-limiting step inhibiting fast and efficient remyelination in chronic demyelinating conditions like Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis and certain MS cases.",

The density of CD3, CD45R/B220, IgG and CD107b \u03e9 cells per spinal cord was counted as described [10]. The MBP \u03e9 white matter area was measured employing the analysis 3.1 software package (SOFT Imaging system, M\u00fcnster, Germany) as described [10, 17]. RNA was isolated from quick frozen spinal cord specimens using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) including DNAse digestion followed by an additional purification step employing the RNeasy MinElute Cleanup Kit (Qiagen). RNA quality was controlled using the Agilent 6000 RNA Nano kit and an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, B\u00f6blingen, Germany). A total of 250 ng RNA of each sample was amplified and labelled with the MessageAmp II-Biotin Enhanced Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). A hybridization mixture containing 10 g of fragmented and labelled cRNA was hybridized to Affymetrix mouse genome 430 2.0 arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) in a rotating hybridization oven at 45\u040aC for 16 hrs. Afterwards the arrays were washed and stained with a solution containing R-phycoerythrin-streptavidin employing the Affymetrix GeneChip Fluidics Station 450 (Affymetrix). Scanning was performed with an Affymetrix GeneChip Scanner 3000 (Affymetrix).

Similar to the present investigation, co-regulation of cholesterol biosynthesis and MBP transcription is EAE[43], thereby preventing an independent evaluation of the long-term effects on remyelination. Notably, while short-time in vitro incubation of rat oligodendroglial progenitor cells and human oligodendrocytes with a HMG-CoA reductaseinhibitor enhances process extension and differentiation, longtime incubation results in process retraction and cell death[67]. While the first beneficial effect seemed to be induced via inhibition of a RhoA GTPase, the detrimental long-term effects are at least partially reversed by cholesterol or isoprenoid treatment. Although the transferability of these in vitro results to the in vivo situation remains to be investigated, further studies in chronic progressive demyelinating models like Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis are suggested to unravel the role of altered oligodendroglial cholesterol biosynthesis on de-and remyelination and for risk assessment of the current treatment trials of cholesterol lowering drugs in MS",
