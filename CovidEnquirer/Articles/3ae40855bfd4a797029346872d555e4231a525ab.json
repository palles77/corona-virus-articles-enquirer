Recently, analyzed the complete genomes of 409 PEDV strains form different countries, which were classified into five subgroups strains (GI-a, GI-b, GII-a, GII-b, and GII-c) [14] . Recombination analysis indicated that the GII-c subgroup strains evolved from a recombination event between subgroups GI-a and GII-a. These data suggest that the Chinese PEDV pandemic strains have undergone genetic variations, leading to the genetic diversities of PEDV pandemic strains.",

Identification of the PEDV-positive samples was performed according the methods described by [12] . Viral isolation was conducted in accordance with the PEDV isolation protocol described by Jiang et al. (2018) [24] . Upon the development of a cytopathic effect (CPE), the viruses were harvested from the culture supernatant for serial passages. The isolated viruses were identified by electron microscopy (EM) and with the use of an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA). For the IFA, Vero cells were inoculated with PEDV isolates at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 for 36 h and then were fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%). After blocking with 5% skim milk for 2 h at room temperature, the cells were incubated with primary monoclonal antibodies (dilution, \u00d7 500) against the spike (S) protein of PEDV for 1 h at 37\u00b0C followed by fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated donkey anti-mouse antibody against immunoglobulin G (dilution, \u00d7 2000; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The monoclonal antibodies against the spike (S) protein was kindly provided by the Division of Swine Digestive System Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. The cells were then observed under a fluorescence microscope. For EM, the samples were negatively stained as previously described (Jiang et al., 2018) . The viral suspension was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 30,000\u00d7g for 30 min to pellet the viral particles, which were negatively stained with 2% phosphotungstic acid (pH 7.0). The negatively stained samples were examined using a Hitachi-7650 transmission electron microscope (Hitachi, Ltd., Tokyo, Japan). The PEDV isolate was named strain HM2017.",

Briefly, Vero cells were incubated with serially diluted PEDV strain HM2017 in post-inoculation medium at 37\u00b0C for 2 h under an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 . Afterward, the medium was removed and the cells in each well were overlaid with 2 mL of post-inoculation medium containing 1.5% agarose. After the overlaid medium had solidified, the cells were grown at 37\u00b0C under an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 to promote plaque formation. Macroscopically visible plaques were picked with a pipette pick, dissolved in 1 mL of DMEM, frozen and thawed for three times after receiving poison, and then inoculated in Vero cells for propagation in preparation for the next round of plaque purification. The plaque purification operation was repeated five times. After incubation for 48 h, the agarose was covered. When plaques grew to the proper size, the cells were fixed in paraformaldehyde (4%) for 2 h and the plaques were visualized by staining with crystal violet. Viral growth curves of PEDV strains HM2017 in Vero cells was constructed according to the median tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ). Briefly, Vero cells were seeded in the wells of 96-well plates at a density of 10 5 cells per well in 100 \u03bcL of medium and incubated for 48 h at 37\u00b0C under an atmosphere of 5% CO 2 . Afterward, the medium was removed and 100 \u03bcL of 10-fold serial dilutions of the virus were added to each well. The cytopathic effect was examined every 12 h for 5 days post-inoculation. The viral titer was determined according to the Reed and Muench method [25] . The classic PEDV strain CV777 was used as a control. PEDV strain CV777 (GenBank accession no. KT323979; group I) was kindly provided by the Division of Swine Digestive System Infectious Diseases, State Key Laboratory of Veterinary Biotechnology, Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.",

Twenty-four newborn piglets were selected and confirmed to be negative for PEDV, transmissible gastroenteritis virus, and porcine rotavirus with the Colloidal gold rapid detection kit (BioNote, Hwaseong-si, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea). Then, the piglets were randomly assigned to one of two groups, i.e., the PEDV HM2017 inoculation group (n = 18) or the control group (n = 6), which were housed in separate cages. Piglets in the inoculation group were orally inoculated with 3 mL of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 1.33 \u00d7 10 6 TCID 50 of PEDV strain HM2017, while the control group was orally administered 3 mL of virus-free DMEM.

Sequence comparisons of the whole genomes revealed nucleotide homologies of 96.1%-99.7% between strain HM2017 and 532 PEDV reference strains (GI-a, GI-b, GII-a, GII-b, and GII-c). The genome-based phylogenetic tree showed that the 533 PEDV strains were classified into two groups: group I (GI: classical strains) and group II (GII: variant strains). Group GII was composed of three subgroups GII-a, GII-b, and GII-c (Fig. 3A) . The PEDV strain HM2017, which was identified in the present study, was clustered into the subgroup GII-a, which consists of the strain HM2017 and 384 PEDV reference strains from China during 2011-2018. The PEDV strains of the subgroup GII-a formed different clades, exhibiting genetic diversities. The S gene was 4158 nucleotides in length, encoding a protein of 1386 amino acids (aa). Sequence analysis of the S protein of HM2017 strain showed that compared with PEDV strain CV777, two insertion were found at positions 58-59 (a 4-aa insertion of QGVN) and 135-136 (a 1-aa insertion of N), and a 2-aa deletion (DI) and 1-aa deletion (Y) were found at positions 158-159 and 1194 (amino acids are numbered according to the S protein of the PEDV strain CV777). Phylogenetic analysis based on the S gene indicated that the HM2017 strain belonged to subgroup GIIa (Fig. 3B) . Genomic similarity analysis revealed that PEDV strain HM2017 exhibited divergence from the reference strains of group GI and subgroup GII-c at part of the S1 gene.

Microbial Pathogenesis 140 (2020) 103922 to immune pressures and the high mutation rate of the RNA genome, and formed various subgroups or clusters. The various epidemic strains of PEDV differ in virulence and immunity, leading to incomplete immune protection of commercial vaccines against infection with various PEDV epidemic strains. In order to investigate the genetic evolution and pathogenic characteristics of PEDV, viral isolation was conducted using PEDV-positive samples collected in China from 2015 to 2018. In the present study, the PEDV strain HM2017 was successfully isolated from Virus titers at different time points were determined and the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) was calculated. Asterisk (*) indicates a significant difference between PEDV HM2017 strain and PEDV CV777 strain (*, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.01). Vero cells and showed good cellular adaptability, as the viral titer of passage 15 was 1.33 \u00d7 10 7 TCID 50 /mL. The PEDV strain HM2017 was classified to the variant subgroup GII-a. Moreover, PEDV strain HM2017 was strongly virulent to suckling piglets, as characterized by severe clinical symptoms, high viral RNA titers shed in feces, gross lesions within the small intestine, shortening of the small intestinal villi, and a mortality rate of 100% by 84 hpi. The global PEDV strains are classified into the classic GI group and variant GII group [4, 6] . The PEDV strains in the variant GII group are closely related to the frequent occurrence of porcine epidemic diarrhea, which has resulted in huge economic losses to the pork industry worldwide [9, 13] . The PEDV strains in the variant GII group appear to be genetically diverse with a gradual increase in number reported globally. reported that group GII PEDV strains can be classified into subgroups GII-a, GII-b, and GII-c, according to phylogenetic analysis of 409 complete genomes of global strains, of which the GII-c is a newly discovered subgroup [14] . In fact, the GII-c subgroup was genetically separated from the GII-a subgroup due to the inconsistent topologies between the S gene and other genes. In the present study, a genome-based phylogenetic tree of 532 global PEDV reference strains was generated. These PEDV reference strains included subgroups GI-a, GI-b, GII-a, GII-b, and GII-c (the genotype of each has been defined in previous studies). In the present study, PEDV strain HM2017 and 384 Chinese PEDV reference strains formed the group GIIa, and the PEDV strains from the subgroup GII-a showed genetic diversities. The results of genomic similarity analysis indicated that the PEDV strain HM2017 exhibited high similarity with these reference strains from the subgroups GII-a and GII-b. The PEDV HM2017 strain identified in our study and seven reference strains formed a unique clade, differing genetically from other reference strains of the subgroup GII-a. These data suggest that Chinese PEDV subgroups GII-a strains have undergone genetic variations, forming potential novel clades. The pathogenicity of different PEDV subgroups has been widely investigated and many reports have confirmed that the PEDV strains of the subgroups GII-a and GII-b are highly pathogenic to suckling piglets, with infection manifesting as severe clinical symptoms with watery diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration, high viral loads shed in the stool, severe lesions within the intestine, as evidenced by thin-transparent intestinal walls and intestinal villus atrophy or shedding, loss of bodyweight, and rapid death [19, 20, 29, 31, 32] . In the present study, PEDV strain HM2017 of subgroup GII-a was strongly virulent to suckling piglets, similar to that of the PEDV strains of subgroups GII-a and GII-b [5, 33] . However, as a slight difference, 66.67% (12/18) of the experimental animals infected with strain HM2017 developed only mild diarrhea at 12 hpi, while strain HM2017 caused a significant increase in body temperature at 36 hpi with fecal shedding of high titers of viral RNA at 12 hpi and 100% mortality by 84 hpi [34] . Moreover, the viral loads were notably high in the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum, and colon of the animals infected with strain HM2017, which is agreement with the report by Jung et al. (2014) [32] . Additionally, PEDV strain CH/JLDH/2016, which was classified into subgroup GII-a, was also highly pathogenic to piglets [18] . These data demonstrate that the PEDV strains of the developing GII-a subgroup are highly virulent and pose a serious threat to the pig populations in China.",

Viral titers, representing viral proliferation in vitro, is an important indicator of PEDV candidate vaccine strains. Lin et al.

Shi et al. (2017) reported that the viral titer of the intestinal epithelial cell-adapted PEDV strain NJ reached 10 5.5 TCID 50 /mL at passage 45 [37] . reported that the viral titer of PEDV strain PED-CUP-B2014 was 10 6 TCID 50 /mL at passage 40 [38] . Lee et al. (2015) reported that the infectious viral titers of PEDV strain KNU-141,112 during the first 30 passages ranged from 10 5.1 to 10 8.2 TCID 50 /mL [31] . In the present study, PEDV strain HM2017 exhibited good in vitro cellular adaptability. The infection titer of the 15th generation of viruses in Vero cells was 1.33 \u00d7 10 7 TCID 50 / mL, which was greater than that of the control PEDV strain CV777. The infection titer of the 15th generation of PEDV strain HM2017 was similar to that of PEDV strain KNU-141,112, but higher than other previous reports to varying degrees. These data demonstrate that the GII-a subgroup PEDV strain HM2017 has potential as a vaccine candidate strain.",

PEDV strain HM2017 appeared to be highly virulent in suckling piglets, with disease characterized by severe clinical manifestations and intestinal lesions followed by relatively rapid death of the infected animals. PEDV strain HM2017 was well adapted to Vero cells, as evidenced by the rapid growth. Together, these data suggest that the prevalence of HM2017-like strains of the developing PEDV subgroup GII-a should be widely monitored in China and efficient vaccines should be developed based on these strains.",
