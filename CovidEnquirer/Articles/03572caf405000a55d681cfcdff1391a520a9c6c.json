In the capture ELISAs the agreement between detection in milk and serum samples was 94% for IgA and 86% for IgM. The correlation between log 10 titres in milk and serum was r0.82 (P<0.001) for IgA and 0.84 (P<0.001) for IgM. Milk seemed a better target than serum for diagnosing speci\u00aec IgA at low levels. There was no variation in the isotype-speci\u00aec BCV antibody titres between healthy quarters of the same udder, but subclinical mastitis was associated with higher levels of IgA antibodies and weak false IgM positive reactions in undiluted milk. Bovine IgA and IgM antibodies in milk and serum showed high stability towards freezing and thawing and storage at room temperature.",

Faecal detection of the virus in EM is time consuming and laborious and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) shows low detection rates in adult cattle (Smith et al., 1998) and in conventionally reared calves (personal observations). Attempts at diagnosing these infections serologically are often problematic because in adult cattle high BCV-speci\u00aec serum IgG levels are often encountered in the acute samples, presumably due to reinfections with the virus, obscuring the detection of a possible titre increase in paired samples. Since adult cattle usually are seropositive (Alenius et al., 1991; Tra \u00cave \u00c2n et al., 1998) , maternal antibodies frequently obliterate the detection of infection in calves (Atterhem et al., 1996) . There is also a demand for serologic tests that do not require the cumbersome and expensive paired samples necessary for an IgG-based diagnosis. In the light of these facts, diagnostics based on speci\u00aec antibodies of the IgA and IgM isotypes would be highly desired improvements.",

The level of total IgA in bovine serum is usually lower than that of total IgM (Butler, 1983) . IgA does not show obvious virus neutralising activity measured by in vitro assays (Kimman et al., 1987b) . However, local IgA antibodies have been shown to protect from mucosal infection in vivo (Liew et al., 1984; Renegar and Small, 1991) . Earlier IgA protection was thought to be conveyed only by preventing the adherence of micro-organisms to mucosal surfaces. Recent work has indicated that other possible modes of action are trapping of intracellular viral precursors and submucosally invading virus, followed by excretion into the lumen of the mucosal organ (Rosenthal and Gallichan, 1997) . Serum IgA responses were detected after both the \u00aerst and the second experimental infection with BRSV in the respiratory tract of colostrum-deprived calves (Kimman et al., 1987a, b) . Mice immunised intranasally with human RSV ISCOMs also showed IgA responses in serum after both the \u00aerst and second inoculation in contrast to the IgM response that was only detectable after the \u00aerst immunisation (Hu et al., 1998) .",

In the capture system, where isotype-speci\u00aec antiserum or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are bound to the solid phase, the BCV-speci\u00aec IgA suffers only from the competition with IgA carrying other speci\u00aecities.

Work with the indirect IgA and IgM ELISAs was discontinued because of low sensitivity, and for the iIgM test also because of a high background level. The sensitivity and speci\u00aecity of the capture ELISAs could not be evaluated against reference methods for BCV-speci\u00aec IgA and IgM since such methods are not available. Instead, the accuracy of the capture ELISAs was proven by the \u00aending that the IgA and IgM results were in good agreement with the IgG1 level in all samples where it was possible to establish the timing of the BCV infection. The cIgA ELISA seems to be most promising since no false positives were recorded, while two cows in the otherwise BCV antibody negative reference herd showed false cIgM positive reactions in serum, but not in milk. These false positives could not be completely ruled out as unspeci\u00aec reactions since they did not react with the control antigen. IgM rheumatoid factors (RF) are well known to cause false positive reactions in IgM analyses on human sera (Salonen et al., 1980; Meurmann, 1983) and have also been described in bovine sera (Ungar-Waron and Abraham, 1991; Graham et al., 1998) . We have not further explored possible RF reactions in this study, but analysing IgM in milk might be a way to avoid RF interference. Reproducibility of the cIgA and cIgM ELISAs was high in the within-plate comparison. The between-plate variation was larger, but quite acceptable in view of the analyses being done during an evaluation period of 6 months. Individual milk and bulk milk samples proved suitable for detection of both IgA and IgM BCV-speci\u00aec antibodies. This is the \u00aerst report, to our knowledge, of IgA and IgM detection in bovine milk for serologic diagnostic purposes. To fully quantify an IgA response in mucosal secretions in relation to that in serum, the level of speci\u00aec IgA should be related to the level of total IgA, because total IgA varies with the amount of secretion produced (Hordnes et al., 1997; Hu et al., 1999) . Milk is a specialised and easily accessible form of mucosal secretion and possibly a more stable source of IgA than for example respiratory secretions, indicated by the fact that there was such a high correlation (r0.82) between IgA titres in milk and serum in this study. In contrast, anti-RSV IgA in respiratory, intestinal and genital secretions of mice showed no correlation to the speci\u00aec IgA levels in serum (Hu et al., 1999) . No obvious variations in milk level of BCV-speci\u00aec IgA due to lactational stage were seen in Herd AN cows during the observation period of 1 year. In other samples, however, we noticed a small to moderate rise in milk IgA and IgG1 levels shortly before drying off (data not shown), most likely due to the higher total concentration of IgA (Guidry et al., 1980) . No colostrum or dry period secretion IgA levels were tested in our study. For three cows in Herd RU serum IgA was on the border of the detection limit. Milk, as expected, gave more consistent results than serum when analysing weak IgA responses.",

This is not surprising, since most of the IgA and some of the IgM are locally produced in the udder (Lascelles et al., 1981) where local in\u00afammation and cytokine activity are likely to affect the Ig production. It is also possible that differences in milk volume between quarters, not measured in this study, accounted for some of the titre differences. Serum IgG1 leaking into in\u00afamed udder tissue may explain the IgG1 variation (though small) between quarters seen in one cow. Only one cow had both high cell counts and IgM levels (Table 4 ). This cow did not show any titre difference between quarters in IgM corresponding to the difference in IgA level. For routine diagnostic purpose differences between healthy quarters, i.e. with low cell counts, are suf\u00aeciently small to give reliable results in the IgA and probably also in the IgM test. In milk with high cell counts weak false positive IgM reactions can be eliminated by using a higher CO for undiluted milk or by diluting the milk.",

IgM was detectable for at least 2\u00b13 weeks after the outbreak in both serum and milk from all primarily infected animals and bulk milk. Surprisingly, IgM was detected in milk from all three and in serum from two of the reinfected cows. In the study of Kimman et al. (1987b) IgM was not detectable in serum after experimental BRSV reinfection 4 months after the primary infection. Our results, however, show that in \u00aeeld outbreaks with longer intervals between infections probably with different strains of the virus, speci\u00aec IgM can be detected after the reinfection, especially in milk. Conclusions about the usefulness of reinfection IgM responses for diagnostic purposes are dif\u00aecult to draw from the results of these few animals. Clearly, the short duration of the response in some animals is a limitation. Low levels of IgM were detected beyond 2 months after the outbreak started in milk from four cows and in serum from two calves. Such reactions were not present in the \u00aerst samples of the study, but are of doubtful diagnostic value and might not be speci\u00aec for BCV. The cows in Herd AN showing BCV reinfection responses probably had made their primary contacts with the virus on other farms. Two of them were introduced into the herd (purchased) as adults (Table 3 ) and the third reinfected cow was probably also introduced, since her ID number did not coincide with the ID series of the home-raised animals. All other cattle tested in the herd showed primary responses to BCV, which is in accordance with the approximate 12-year interval since the previous WD outbreak on the farm.",

Serum IgA responses in calves experimentally infected with BCV (Saif, 1987) were much shorter than in our study, as expected from the detection in indirect ELISA. In our study, in contrast to other \u00aeeld studies (Heckert et al., 1991c) , we were able to \u00aend seronegative cattle that became naturally infected, which facilitates the evaluation. Serum IgA responses detected using an isotype capture ELISA in seronegative calves naturally or experimentally infected with BRSV were also very short and mean peak levels were lower (Kimman et al., 1987a, b) compared with our results. Reasons for this discrepancy may be differences in sensitivity of the ELISAs or that BCV causes a more extended course of infection than BRSV. The levels and kinetics of the IgM response and the \u00aerst detection of IgA in the naturally infected calves in the studies of Kimman et al. corresponded well with our results.",

The higher peak levels of IgA in milk and sera shown by these cows compared with the primarily infected ones indicated that boosting of the IgA response occurs, as was also seen in the experimental calf studies with BCV (Heckert et al., 1991a) and BRSV infection (Kimman et al., 1987a) . The three originally reinfected cows also displayed the highest IgA titres at the 6-months sampling, indicating that these cows probably would have retained detectable IgA levels longer than the originally primarily infected ones. Serum IgA levels were correlated with protection from respiratory challenge with in\u00afuenzavirus in mice (Liew et al., 1984) . Likewise, detection of, or a certain level of, systemic IgA might be used as a marker for protection in the bovine. The reinfection contracted by most animals in Herd AN before the 9-months sampling was subclinical to the farmer, indicating protection against disease. Symptoms were not even noted in the two bull calves that were IgA negative at the time of reinfection. Calves and young stock, however, are often asymptomatic in WD outbreaks among cows (Hedstro \u00c8m and Isaksson, 1951; Roberts, 1957) .",
