Predicting the peak arrival time and evaluating the effectiveness of the control measures will play a decisive role in ensuring the smooth operation of the social economy. In this paper, two main areas (Hubei and other regions outside Hubei in China) are focused on for larger scale analysis. Li et al [17] conducted an in-depth analysis of the effects of traffic blockage and medical quarantine. It is shown that the quarantine is very effective for epidemic control, which can reduce the number of infections by nearly 90%.",
