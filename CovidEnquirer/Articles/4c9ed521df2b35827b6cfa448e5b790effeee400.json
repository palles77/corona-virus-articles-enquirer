            "text": "Influenza vaccines that can be administered intranasally or by other needle-free delivery routes have potential advantages over injected formulations in terms of patient compliance, cost, and ease of global distribution. Supramolecular peptide nanofibers have been investigated previously as platforms for vaccines and immunotherapies and have been shown to raise immune responses in the absence of exogenous adjuvants and without measurable inflammation. However, at present it has not been tested whether the immunogenicity of these materials extends to the intranasal route. Here we investigated the extent to which self-assembled peptide nanofibers bearing an influenza peptide epitope elicit antigen-specific CD8 + T cell responses when delivered intranasally, and we compared these responses with those elicited by subcutaneous immunization. Peptides containing an epitope from influenza acid polymerase (PA) and the Q11 self-assembly domain formed nanofibers that were avidly taken up by dendritic cells in lung-draining mediastinal lymph nodes after intranasal immunization. Intranasally delivered nanofibers generated greater antigen-specific CD8 + T cell responses in the lung-draining lymph nodes than subcutaneous immunizations while retaining the non-inflammatory character of the materials observed in other delivery sites. The CD8 + T cells elicited systemically were functional as assessed by their ability to produce IFN-\u03b3 ex vivo, lyse epitope-pulsed target cells in vivo, and diminish viral loads in infected mice. Compared to subcutaneously delivered nanofibers, intranasally delivered peptide nanofibers significantly increased the number of persisting antigen-specific tissue resident memory CD8 + T cells in the lung, allowing for a more rapid response to infection at 6 weeks post-vaccination. These results indicate that intranasally delivered self-assembled peptide nanofibers are immunogenic when delivering CD8 + epitopes without adjuvant or CD4 + epitopes, are non-inflammatory, and promote more lung-resident memory CD8 + T cells compared to subcutaneous immunization.",

            "text": "Influenza is a significant problem in global health [1] , and vaccination is the most promising means for diminishing its impact. To improve patient compliance and global accessibility, needle-free immunization systems have received considerable interest [2, 3] . Annual seasonal influenza vaccines are recommended by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but the nasally administered live-attenuated vaccine FluMist (AstraZeneca) has not been recommended in the past two seasons because its efficacy was found to be inferior to injected trivalent inactivated virus (TIV) formulations [4] . Transcriptome analysis has revealed that intranasal vaccines and TIV vaccines induce different gene signatures, with TIV vaccines inducing genes associated with B cell/antibody responses and intranasal vaccines eliciting an enrichment of genes highly expressed in T cells and monocytes [5] . The mechanisms that lead to differential immune responses and varying efficacy remain to be fully investigated, nevertheless these observations underscore the need for improved nasally administered vaccines. In particular, vaccines capable of eliciting strong cytotoxic CD8 + T cell responses and tissue resident memory T cells (T RM ) in the lung would be most advantageous. Such vaccines could offer rapid clearance of the influenza virus upon subsequent exposure and the possibility of broad protection. For instance, Stambas et al. demonstrated that CD8 + T cells pulsed with peptides from nucleoprotein (NP 366-374 , ASNENMETM) and acid polymerase (PA 224-233 , SSLENFRAYV) were able to clear multiple strains of influenza virus in a cell number-dependent manner [6] . Supramolecular peptide nanofibers have received interest recently as vaccines and immunotherapies for applications ranging from infectious disease [7] [8] [9] [10] to drug addiction [11] , chronic inflammation [12] and cancer [13, 14] . In many cases, the nanofibers do not require supplemental adjuvants to be immunogenic [8, [12] [13] [14] [15] . While examples of peptide or protein nanoparticle vaccines delivered intranasally exist in the literature [16] [17] [18] [19] , supramolecular peptide nanofibers have yet to be studied systematically in the context of intranasal delivery. This leaves open the questions of whether these nanofibers retain their intrinsic immunogenicity by this route and whether the immune responses elicited differ significantly from those elicited by injected formulations. Among the advantages of supramolecular peptide vaccines are chemical definition, modularity afforded by their non-covalent construction, and their minimally inflammatory nature [7] . Together these properties allow for the adjustment of the strength and phenotype of the immune responses they raise [8] . Nanofiber formulations can be achieved in a straightforward manner by synthesizing peptide epitopes from selected antigens in tandem with self-assembling peptides such as the \u03b2-sheet forming peptides Q11 [7] [8] [9] 12, 15, 20] or KFE8 [11, 21] , or the \u03b1-helical fibrillizing peptide Coil29 [13] . After subcutaneous injection, supramolecular nanofibers can stimulate strong cytotoxic CD8 + T cell responses with or without any adjuvants [9] . Recently, the Rudra group showed that Q11 nanofibers carrying the ovalbumin SIINFEKL epitope were able to elicit SIINFEKL-specific CD8 + T cells without any adjuvants, and vaccinated mice were able to maintain body weight following sub-lethal influenza challenge using PR8-OVA influenza virus [9] . In that study, a booster immunization was administered intranasally, but primary immunizations were administered via injection. Ding et al. reported that a CD8 + epitope from HIV (SLYNTVATL) conjugated to the self-assembling peptide EAK16-II induced antigenspecific CD8 + T-cell responses when co-delivered with a TLR 7/8 agonist [22] . Another report indicated that influenza virus-like particles containing expressed hemagglutinin (HA) and the matrix protein M1 were able to stimulate HA-specific CD8 + T-cell responses after intranasal delivery [23, 24] . Together, these previous studies suggested that adjuvant-free peptide nanofibers containing influenza peptide epitopes may be able to elicit CD8 + T-cell responses in the lung after intranasal priming and boosting, a hypothesis that we tested here.",

Formulations did not contain additional CD4 + epitopes. The PA epitope was chosen because it has been reported that adoptively transferred PA-specific CD8 + T cells were able to clear virus in mice [6] . We tracked the uptake of PAQ11 nanofibers in the draining mediastinal lymph nodes and studied the antigen cross-presentation of another CD8 + T cell epitope, SINNFEKL, in vitro using a reporter cell line. We next evaluated the recruitment of inflammatory cells and the production of inflammatory cytokines in the lung after intranasal administration. Importantly, we compared systemic and lung-resident CD8 + T-cell responses between the intranasal and subcutaneous routes, and we studied the ability of vaccinated mice to control virus infection in the lung. This is the first report, to our knowledge, on eliciting lung-resident CD8 + T-cell responses using intranasally delivered peptide nanofibers without any adjuvants or dependence on CD4+ T cell epitopes.",

Peptide identity was confirmed by MALDI. Peptides were purified by reverse phase HPLC, lyophilized, and stored at \u221220\u00b0C before use. To enable detection of nanofiber uptake by flow cytometry, 5-(and-6)-Carboxytetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA)-conjugated SIINFEKLQ11 (SIINFEKLQ11-TAMRA) was synthesized via N-terminal on-resin conjugation using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) coupling. To prepare nanofibers, dry peptides were combined such that final nanofiber formulations contained 1.33 mM PAQ11 (or SIINFE-KLQ11 for uptake and presentation studies) and 0.67 mM Q11. Dry powders were intermixed by vortexing and dissolved in ultrapure water at a concentration of 8 mM total peptide (4\u00d7 final concentration). After overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C, peptide solutions were diluted to 2 mM in 1\u00d7 PBS using ultrapure water and 10\u00d7 PBS; the addition of PBS induced final fibrillization of the product. The resulting nanofibers containing 2 mM peptide were incubated at room temperature for 3 h before use. Endotoxin levels were measured using the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate chromogenic endpoint assay (Lonza, Allendale, NJ, USA). Endotoxin levels for all formulations were below 0.5 EU/mL, which is within acceptable limits for in vivo animal studies [25] . For uptake studies, nanofibers contained 0.01 mM of fluorescent SIINFE-KLQ11-TAMRA. Sheared nanofibers were prepared by passing through a 0.8 \u03bcm membrane using an Avanti Mini Extruder. This method reduced the length of the nanofibers from hundreds of nanometers long to an average of 82 nm.",

In previous studies of nanofiber uptake after intraperitoneal injections, it was determined that such TAMRA-positive DCs had internalized the labeled peptides rather than merely binding them on their surfaces [7] . In contrast with peptide nanofibers, TAMRA-labeled soluble epitope peptide did not result in any detectable TAMRA-positive cells in the draining mediastinal lymph nodes, possibly because it was more quickly degraded than the peptide nanofibers. No uptake was observed for DCs in the BALF or in the lung in either group (data not shown) consistent with the possibility that the nanofibers drained into and were taken up by DCs in the mediastinal lymph nodes. Although it is possible that some of the intranasally administered material reached the stomach or was taken up by APCs in the nasal mucosa, the detectable uptake of the nanofibers by APCs in the lung-draining mediastinal lymph nodes indicated that a considerable proportion reached the lung.",

C57BL/6 mice were intranasally immunized with PAQ11 nanofibers, soluble PA peptide, Q11 nanofibers, or PAQ11 nanofibers that had been sheared and rendered into short assemblies by passing through an 0.8 \u03bcm filter in a mini extruder apparatus. Mediastinal lymph nodes were collected, and PAspecific CD8 + T cell responses were quantified using PA: H-2D b tetramers 10 d after primary immunization. As shown in Fig. 4A , shearing of the nanofibers abolished the production of PA-specific CD8 + T cells, confirming that the integrity of the PAQ11 nanofibers was critical for their immunogenicity via the intranasal route. This was additionally supported by the finding that no detectable PA-specific CD8 + T cells were observed after intranasal immunization with soluble PA peptide (Fig. 4A) . Q11 (lacking the PA epitope) has also been shown previously to be non-immunogenic when it lacks competent epitopes attached to it [15] , and Q11 nanofibers mixed with soluble peptide epitopes are likewise non-immunogenic [15, 33] , illustrating that the complete formed nanofiber with attached epitopes is likely necessary for the immunogenicity observed intranasally. These results indicated that extending the PA epitope with a C-terminal Q11 domain and self-assembling the peptide into nanofibers enabled it to raise epitope-specific CD8 + responses in the lung-draining lymph nodes without additional adjuvants.",

Splenocytes were used rather than lymph node cells to ensure sufficient cell numbers for the experiment.

The result of the in vivo cytotoxicity assay was consistent with those of the IFN-\u03b3 ELISPOT assays, as PAQ11 immunizations generated elevated CTL function against PA-pulsed, but not control peptide-pulsed targets, compared to control mice immunized with Q11 (Fig. 4C) .",

PAQ11 nanofibers elicited negligible infiltration of neutrophils and eosinophils in the lung, comparable to the administration of PBS (Fig. 5A and B) , whereas LPS elicited considerable neutrophil and eosinophil infiltration. Consistent with these findings, PAQ11 did not elicit any detectable GM-CSF, IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, or TNF in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and these cytokine levels were undistinguishable from negative control PBS injections. In contrast, LPS induced considerable production of IL-6 and TNF (Fig. 5C ).

Mice were vaccinated intranasally or subcutaneously with PAQ11 and boosted 28 d later, and CD8 + T cell responses were evaluated in the lungs 10 d after boosting. Ten minutes prior to killing, mice were injected intravenously with 3 \u03bcg PE-Cyanine7 conjugated anti-Thy1.2 antibody. Bloodborne cells are immediately available for labeling in this procedure and are labeled as Thy1.2 + , whereas tissueresident cells are protected from antibody labeling within this timeframe and are not labeled with anti-Thy1.2 antibody. Thus, PA antigenspecific CD8 + Thy1.2 \u2212 T cells are designated as tissue resident (TR) cells. It was found that intranasally administered PAQ11 induced significantly greater frequencies and absolute numbers of Thy1.2 \u2212 CD8 + T cells in the lungs compared with subcutaneous PAQ11 administration ( Fig. 6A and B) . Additionally, more PA-specific CD8 + T cells were present within the TR population compared to the circulating population of CD8 + T cells for mice that had been intranasally immunized with PAQ11 ( Fig. 6C and D) . Next, we determined whether the induced TR PA-specific CD8 + T cells expressed CD69, an early activation marker typical of tissue resident memory T cells (T RM ). Significantly greater frequencies and absolute numbers of CD44 hi CD69 + CD8 + T RM cells were present in intranasally immunized mice compared with subcutaneously immunized mice (Fig. 6E, F) . Collectively, these results demonstrated that intranasal vaccination with PAQ11 established a robust TR PA-specific CD8 + T cell response in the lung, whereas subcutaneous immunization with the same material was not able to achieve this result.",

These prior studies were performed with subcutaneous, foot-pad, or intraperitoneal delivery routes. Here, Q11-based peptide nanofibers continued to exhibit this non-inflammatory character after intranasal delivery, an impressive observation given the lung's exquisite sensitivity to particulate matter, which triggers inflammatory responses and adverse pulmonary events [39] . This finding is also important for the potential clinical development of supramolecular peptide assemblies, as other adjuvanted systems can engage inflammatory pathways such as Toll-like receptor signaling, the inflammasome, or both. The avoidance of exogenous adjuvant and the reliance on short synthetic peptides may also provide the materials with enhanced thermal stability [20] , also of key importance for vaccines and immunotherapies for the developing world.",

This is an unexpected finding since CD8 + cells activated in the absence of CD4 + T cell help develop into memory cells that cannot undergo clonal proliferation upon secondary challenge [40] [41] [42] . Furthermore, Laidlaw et al. reported that CD4 + T cells were also necessary for the development of T RM during influenza infection in mice [43] . In contrast, we show here that immunization with PAQ11 without a CD4 + T cell epitope and without adjuvant can still elicit functional T RM memory cells that expand rapidly upon intranasal influenza infection. Finally, we show that the CD8 + response was localized to the lung, and that T RM responses within the lung were considerably superior for intranasally delivered nanofibers, while subcutaneous vaccination resulted in stronger systemic responses. Although the present study is focused on influenza, this combination of induced T RM responses without significant inflammation may also benefit vaccines against other respiratory infectious diseases such as group A streptococcus, corona viruses, hantavirus, and others. Implementation of the intranasal Q11 approach for each would involve the identification of competent epitopes, either singly or in combination, and optimization of their doses and stoichiometries.",

T-cell epitope/B-cell epitope combinations have been shown previously to function well both in the Q11 system [8, 12] and in the Coil 29 system [13] . It would also be interesting to investigate whether additional CD4 + T-cell help, provided by co-assembling a strong and promiscuous CD4 + epitope, would augment the CD8 + responses elicited by PAQ11. Further, additional B cell epitopes and additional CD8 + epitopes could all be envisioned for augmenting the vaccine's protective efficacy. Because we saw only modestly improved clearance of PR8 influenza infections after immunization, this may be a fruitful strategy for further development.",

Compared with subcutaneous injections, intranasally delivered peptide nanofibers produced greater CD8 + T cell responses in lung-draining lymph nodes, greater numbers of tissue resident T cells and a more rapid tissue resident memory response to influenza infection. After intranasal administration, these immunological outcomes were achieved without measurable inflammation in the lung.",
