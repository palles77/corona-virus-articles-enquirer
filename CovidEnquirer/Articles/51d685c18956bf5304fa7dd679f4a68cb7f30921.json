Most of the detergents used in this study solubilized G in a 4 5 monomeric form . However, when CHAPS was used, G had a sedimentation coefficient of 9 S . This high sedimentation coefficient allowed its further separation from Ml and M2 . Using electron microscopy of negatively stained samples, we studied the morphology of G on virus and after detergent extraction . End-on views of G on virus clearly showed triangles consisting of three dots indicating the trimeric nature of native G . End-on views of CHAPS-isolated G showed very similar triangles confirming that, using this detergent, G was solubilized in its native trimeric structure . Electron microscopy also showed that G had a \"head\" and a \"stalk\" and provided the basis for a low-resolution model of the glycoprotein structure .",

It constitutes the spikes which protrude from the viral surface and plays a critical role in virus infection . First, it initiates the interaction between the virus and the target cell : it is responsible for virus attachment to specific receptors on the cell (Wunner at at, 1984) and, therefore, is important in determining the tissue tropism of the virus (Kucera at at, 1985 ; Coulon at at, 1989 ; Lafay et al., 1991) . Second, after attachment to the host cell and internalization of the virion via the endocytic pathway, the G protein mediates the low pH-induced fusion of the viral envelope with the endocytic vesicle membrane (Mifune at al., 1982 ; Gaudin et al ., 1991 a) . Finally, the G protein stimulates the host immune system and induces the synthesis of neutralizing antibodies (Wiktor et al., 1973) .",

In the presence of 1 % CHAPS (16 .2 mM), G had an apparent sedimentation coefficient of 9 S ( Fig . 2A) and could be separated from the two other proteins (Fig . 113 ) . This sedimentation coefficient was very similar to that of native influenza HA (9 S) (Brand and Skehel, 1972) and VSV glycoprotein (8 S) (Doms etal., 1987) , both of which are trimeric . However, as the hydrodynamic properties of a protein may be significantly modified in the presence of detergent, we looked for other evidence to confirm the trimeric nature of the native rabies virus glycoprotein . The oligomeric structure of G also appeared to be crucially dependent on the CHAPS concentration : increasing the concentration to 2% (32 .4 mM) rendered G monomeric while decreasing the CHAPS concentration to 0 .5% (8 .1 mM) led to self-aggregation of G . Therefore, the purification protocol described under Materials and Methods was routinely used for further experiments .",

The virus particles were deformed during the preparation procedure which helped visualization of G as it spread out the proteins so that individual complexes could be seen . Seen in side view, G looked like a head on a thin stalk, resembling the influenza neuraminidase (Ruigrok etal., 1986) .

Upon close examination, we could discern three major types of shape labeled B, C, and D in Fig . 4A , that are shown with higher magnifi- Figure 4B shows a side view of isolated spikes ; a head on a stalk with a total length of 13 .2 nm, the head being 6 .1-nm wide and 5 .0-nm high . Isolated spikes were 4 .9 nm longer than spikes extending from the membrane of virus, which was consistent with the additional presence of the transmembrane (residues 440-461) plus cytoplasmic parts (462-505) of G . About 25% of the spikes measured (the criterium for selection being a stalk with a head) were longer than 13 .2 nm and showed a separate peak in the length distribution of 16 .1 \u00b1 0 .4 nm (n = 34) (see Fig . 5 ) . This higher value might be caused by a different orientation on the grid of one or both extreme ends of the molecule, or by different conformations of the molecule . Different orientations of the amino terminus of the adenovirus fiber protein also resulted in different overall lengths (Ruigrok et al ., 1990) . Figure 4C shows the spike in end-on view, similar triangles as shown for the end-on view of G on virus, indicating clearly the trimeric nature of the spike formed by G . The side of the triangle measured 8 .8 nm which was more than the average width of the head (6 .1 nm) when seen in side view . The monomers making up the trimer seemed to have come somewhat apart when G was adsorbed head-on on the carbon film . Figure 4D shows doublets of trimers that are associated via their hydrophobic transmembrane parts . The total length of a doublet was 21 .6 nm which agreed with twice the length of detergent-isolated G minus one transmembrane plus cytoplasmic part (13 .2 + 13 .2 -4 .9) . The length of these doublet was well defined and the length distribution showed only one peak . This suggested that the single trimers with the length of 16 .1 nm had a length extension at their N-terminal end when compared with the 13 .2-nm spikes . Possibly, the cytoplasmic part of G of the 16 .1-nm spike is folded differently, or is lying on the carbon film in a different manner than that of the 13 .2-nm spike . Model drawings of G on virus, detergent-isolated single trimers, and doublets are shown in Fig . 6 . Drawings of G on virus and detergent-isolated G, single trimers, and doublets . The dimensions are indicated but note that forthe width of the heads we used the measurement of the sides of the triangles of the end-on orientation of G on the carbon film, which differs from the direct measurement of the width (see text) . The transmembrane plus cytoplasmic parts of detergent-isolated G are shaded . In the drawing of the single trimer of detergent-isolated G, we have not taken into account the fraction of molecules that had a length of about 16 non . The length of spikes extending from the viral membrane was 8 .3 \u00b10 .6 nm (number of measurements : n = 80) ; the height of the head of viral G was 4 .8 i 0 .7 non (o = 22), the side length of the triangles observed on virus was 8 .4\u00b1 1 .1 nm (n = 41) . the length of detergent-isolated spikes was 13 .2 \u00b1 0 .6 nm (n = 95), and the height and the width of their head were, respectively, 5 .0 \u00b1 1 .0 nm (n = 43) and 6 .1 \u00b1 0 .9 nm (o = 47), whereas the side length of isolated triangles was 8 .8 \u00b1 0 .6 nor (n = 93) .

(1991) using a cross-linking reagent on G expressed in Hela cells from cloned cDNA . This trimer can be solubilized RABIES VIRUS GLYCOPROTEIN IS A TRIMER 6 3 1 detergent isolated G 13 .2nm 4 under its native quaternary structure with CHAPS, a zwitterionic detergent . However, once the glycoprotein is solubilized, this trimeric organization is not very stable and appears to be sensitive to most of the detergents that we used . Such an instability has also been reported in the case of VSV : solubilized with OG, VSV G appeared to be monomeric (Crimmins et al., 1983) while, solubilized with Triton X100 at acidic pH, VSV G appeared to be trimeric (Doms et al., 1987) . Such a stabilization of the oligomeric structure at acidic pH was not observed in the case of rabies virus G (Whitt et at, 1991 ; this work) . Apparently, the oligomeric organization of the rhabdovirus glycoproteins is less stable than that of influenza virus hemagglutinin of which the trimeric organization is resistant to most detergents such as Triton X100 (Skehel et al., 1982) , Brij 36T (Skehel etal., 1982 ; Ruigrok et al., 1986) , OG (Ruigrok etal., 1986) , and C 12 E a (Stegmann et al., 1987) . This relative instability may also explain why the trimeric end-on view of detergent-isolated G and G on deformed virus shows a larger width (8 .8 and 8 .4 nm, respectively) for the head than detergent-isolated G in side view (6 .1 nm) . Numerous viral external proteins such as the adenovirus fiber (Ruigrok et al., 1990) , the reovirus cell attachment protein 1 (Strong et at, 1991) , the corona-virus spike protein (Delmas and Laude, 1990) , the rhabdovirus glycoproteins (Doms et al., 1987 ; this work) , and the hemagglutinin of influenza virus (Wilson et al., 1981) , which are implicated in receptor recognition and/or carry the membrane fusion properties of the virion, are trimeric . This might have some biological significance and may reflect similarities in the mechanisms involved in receptor recognition and/or membrane fusion .",
