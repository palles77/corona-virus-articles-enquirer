However, the synonymous codons are not randomly chosen within and between genomes, which is referred to as codon usage bias (Grantham et al., 1980; Marin et al., 1989) . This phenomenon has been observed in a wide range of organisms, from prokaryotes to eukaryotes and viruses. Studies on codon usage have identified several factors that could influence codon usage patterns, including mutation pressure, natural or translational selection, secondary protein structure, replication and selective transcription, hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity of the protein, and the external environment (Gu et al., 2004; Liu et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2013; Moratorio et al., 2013; Sharp et al., 1988; Tao et al., 2009 ).

This is an interesting aspect of ZIKV evolution, however, the codon adaptation index analysis was only conducted in H. sapiens and Ae. aegypti and lacked some of the recently sequenced ZIKV genomes from the outbreak regions. As ZIKV is carried and transmitted by many types of Aedes mosquitoes other than Ae. aegypti, most notably Ae. albopictus (Duffy et al., 2009) , understanding the evolutionary adaptation of viruses to their hosts and vectors is essential for developing effective surveillance, diagnostic, and preventive strategies. Based on the recently available sequence data from the outbreak and the broad range of the ZIKV vectors, we investigated the evolutionary adaptation of ZIKV to its transmission vectors and host to identify the potential cause of the ongoing massive ZIKV outbreak.",

            "text": "The workflow of phylogenetic and codon based analyses followed was similar as reported previously by us for CHIKV (Butt et al., 2014) and Marburg viruses (Nasrullah et al., 2015) . The analyzed ZIKV genomes (n = 27) clustered into three separate groups of Asian, West African and East African genotypes where all of the recently reported outbreak sequences clustered into Asian genotype group. Although, we also noted that NS1 gene had the highest adaptation towards H. replicate successfully in multiple hosts therefore, a virus may have to create a dynamic balance of both codon adaptation and codon deoptimization that could enable efficient replication and survival possibilities in multiple hosts of variable codon usage patterns. In such cases, we suspect that a single CAI observation is not enough to completely decipher the evolutionary patterns for such multi-host pathogen. We therefore, conducted similarity index and relative codon deoptimization index (RCDI) analyses to further investigate magnitude of ZIKV evolution under the influence of multiple hosts. ZIKV coding sequence were found to have highest codon deoptimization towards Ae. albopictus whereas, lowest codon deoptimization trends were noted for Ae. aegypti and H. sapiens. As reported previously, a low RCDI might indicate high adaptation to a host that comes in agreement to overall high CAI of ZIKV coding sequences towards H. sapiens and Ae. aegypti. On the other hand, a low RCDI is indicative that some viral genes are expressed in latency phases or even that the virus might present a low replication rate for successful establishment in a host with alternative codon usage patterns (Puigbo et al., 2010) . Furthermore, according to the similarity index analysis, Ae. albopictus is probably the new preferred vector of ZIKV because the selection pressure exerted by Ae. albopictus on all three ZIKV genotypes is greater than the selection pressures imposed by Ae. aegypti or H. sapiens (Figure 1 ). The similarity index was found to be highest for Ae. albopictus whereas, lowest was noted for H. sapiens.",

It is not known yet how ZIKV responds and manages within multiple vectors which are although member of same species but still demonstrates differences in certain aspects of genetic and environmental preferences. Currently, there is no reported genome sequence of ZIKV isolated from Ae. aegypti or Ae. albopictus populations of the affected areas. So, at this stage it is unclear if anyone or both types of Aedes are also actually harboring similar ZIKV strains as that of reported from the outbreak regions. By looking at previously reported ZIKV strains, there is only a single strain that was isolated from Ae. aegypti in 1966 (GenBank ID: HQ234499). Although, this strain clusters within Asian genotype group, by looking at correspondence analysis plots, it is clear that this strain contains several differences at individual gene levels from the rest of Asian strains (Figure 2) . Whether these genome level differences are host specific warrants further investigations. In current scenario, host-vector-virus triangle highlights an important matter of concern towards reevaluating the current surveillance, eradication and preventative strategies for ZIKV which for now appear to be largely focused on A. aegypti only.",
