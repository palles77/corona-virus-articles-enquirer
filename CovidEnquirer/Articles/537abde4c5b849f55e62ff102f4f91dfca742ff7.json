The number and the distribution of single nucleotide variations (SNVs) and insertions and deletions, with respect to a \"profile\", were determined and discussed (\"profile\" being a sequence containing the most represented letter per position). Distribution of substitution categories per codon positions, as well as synonymous and non-synonymous substitutions in coding regions of annotated isolates, was determined, along with amino acid (a.a.) property changes. Similar analysis was performed for the spike (S) protein in all the isolates (55 of them being predicted for the first time). The ratio Ka/Ks confirmed that the S gene was subjected to the Darwinian selection during virus transmission from animals to humans. Isolates from the dataset were classified according to genome polymorphism and genotypes. Genome polymorphism yields to two groups, one with a small number of SNVs and another with a large number of SNVs, with up to four subgroups with respect to insertions and deletions. We identified three basic nine-locus genotypes: TTTT/TTCGG, CGCC/TTCAT, and TGCC/TTCGT, with four subgenotypes. Both classifications proposed are in accordance with the new insights into possible epidemiological spread, both in space and time.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), potentially fatal atypical pneumonia, first appeared in Guangdong province of China in November 2002 and soon afterward, within six months, spreaded all over the world (30 countries including China, Singapore, Vietnam, Canada, and USA), killing more than 700 people (1) . In less than four weeks after the global outbreak, a novel member of Coronaviridae family, namely SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was identified in the blood of respiratory specimens and stools of SARS patients, and confirmed as the causative agent of disease according to the Koch postulates (2) . Soon afterwards, first fully sequenced genomes of viral isolates were published (3, 4) . In 2005 the number of fully sequenced viral isolates exceeds one hundred (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez). SARS-CoV probably originated due to genetic exchange (recombination) and/or mutations between viruses with different host specificities (5, 6) . Since coronaviruses are known to relatively easily jump among species, it was hypothesized that the new virus might have originated from wild animals. The analysis of SARS-CoV proteins supports and suggests possible past recombination event between mammalianlike and avian-like parent viruses (6) . Common sequence variants define three distinct genotypes of the SARS-CoV: one linked with animal [palm civet (Paguma larvata)] SARS-like viruses and early human phase, the other two linked with middle and late human phases, respectively (7, 8) . SARS-CoV has a deleterious mutation of 29 nucleotides relative to the palm civet virus, indicating that if there was direct transmission, it went from civet to human, because deletions occur probably more easily than insertions (5) . However, more recent reports indicate that SARS-CoV is distinct from the civet virus and it has not been answered so far whether the SARS-CoV originated from civet, or civet was infected from other species (9, 10) . The genome is relatively stable, since its mutation rate has been determined to be between 1.83\u00d710 -6 and 8.26\u00d710 -6 nucleotide substitutions per site per day (11) .",

It exhibits three peak-regions of T nucleotide in the second quarter of the genome (ORF 1a), and rather stable behavior in the third quarter of the genome (ORF 1b), as also observed by Pyrc et al (32) for a group of coronaviruses (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV, and HCoV-OC43). Deviation of percentage of nucleotides over 250-nt blocks from the corresponding percentage in the whole dataset is given in Figure S2 . Except for 3' UTR where T nucleotide is underrepresented with even about -13%, the highest excess from the average is about +10% in four peaks, which is exhibited again by T nucleotide, three of them being between positions 7,000 and 11,000 (ORF 1a), complementary with the nucleotide A represented with -10%, and the fourth one in the S protein. Otherwise the nucleotides' offset oscillates rather regularly between -5% and +5% from the average.",

Still, they could be differentiated on the basis of their genome polymorphism, i.e., the number and sites of SNVs and insertions and deletions (INDELs). Analysis of genomic polymorphism of the isolates resulted in the following two facts (Tables 1, S1, and S2). Firstly, two isolates, HSR 1 and AS, coincided with the \"profile\" on all the \"non-empty\" positions (see Materials and Methods) up to the poly-A sequence. Secondly, three isolates had large number of undefined nucleotides (N), either as contiguous segments (Sin3408 in ORFs 8a, 8b; Sin3408L in ORF 1b), or as scattered individual nucleotides or short clusters (SinP2) ( Table S2 ). Isolate Sin3408 was the only one that has a 34-nt longer 5' UTR as compared with the \"profile\". Thus these three isolates were not considered to be reliably compared with others. Shaded entries correspond to annotated isolates. Identification (Label and ID) is given in accordance with the labels and identifiers from Table S1. The four SNVs columns correspond to: the total number of SNVs, the number of SNVs in genes, in 5' and 3' UTRs, and in IGR. The seven columns named INDELs include the number of deletions at the 5' end (5' del), the length of long insertions (longIns) and long deletions (longDel), the number and length of short insertions (shortIns) and short deletions (shortDel) in the form a \u00d7 b where b denotes the length and a denotes the number of occurrences, the number of deletions at the 3' end (3' del), and the length of a poly-A sequence at the 3' end (3' poly-A). Classification includes two columns. The Type column corresponds to the nine-locus nucleotides that are given in the form NNNN/NNNNN and represent nucleotides at (relative to CLUSTAL X output) positions 9,420, 17,604, 222,274, 27,891 / 3,861, 9,495, 11,514, 21,773, 26,534, respectively (absolute HSR 1 positions 9,404, 17,564, 22,222, 27,827 / 3,852, 9,479, 11,493, 21,721, 26,477) .

Its close relationship to the classification proposed in the paper suggests that classification of SARS-CoV isolates might be obtained by applying the computational analysis based on genome polymorphism. All the isolates were classified according to their genome polymorphism-SNVs and INDELs, the procedure being proposed in our previous paper (57). Since SNV contents turned out to be a more distinguishable property than the presence of INDELs, as the first classification criterion we took the number and positions of SNVs. For the \"profile\" isolate, as the referent isolate, number of SNVs for different isolates varied from 0 (HSR 1, AS) to 78 (ZMY 1) ( Table 1) . All the isolates were classified into two groups based on the number of SNVs with the \"profile\"-those with less than or equal to 11 SNVs, and those having more than 11 SNVs.

It also takes into account different evolutionary pathways between pairs of codons. The DnaSP program may run with or without an outgroup. The ratio Ka/Ks is considered as a selection parameter (Ka/Ks > 1 is usually interpreted as an indicator of positive selection). The coefficients Ka, Ks, as well as the ratio Ka/Ks were calculated first for the S protein in all the isolates in the dataset, without an outgroup. Since among the 91 isolates there were 89 human patients' isolates and 2 palm civet isolates (SZ3, SZ16), we then calculated the Ka and Ks coefficients and the ratio Ka/Ks for the 89 human patients' isolates only, without an outgroup, too. Eventually, we ran the program for all the human patients' isolates and each of the palm civet isolates as the outgroup, in order to test the hypothesis that the S gene was subjected to positive selection during virus transmission from animals to humans.",

Positions of multiple SNVs have been chosen in order to reduce the chance of erroneously determined SNV. There were 91 such SNV sites with 288 SNVs. It is interesting to notice that there were no multiple base substitutions (more than two different bases) in any of these positions. There were 227 transitions at 75 sites and 61 transversion at 16 sites, out of which 5 were in structural proteins: 2 in S, 2 in E, and 1 in M proteins.
