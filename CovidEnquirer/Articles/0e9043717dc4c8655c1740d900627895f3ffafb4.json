Feline coronavirus most frequently causes inapparent enteric infection with fecal shedding of virus. Mild enteritis and diarrhea are seen rarely (see Chapter 14) . A mutation of feline coronavirus during intestinal replication enables it to infect macrophages and cause FIP. Despite its name, the lesions of FIP are widespread and not restricted to the peritoneum. Effusive and non-effusive forms of FIP occur. Since its recognition in the 1950s, FIP has been one of the most studied diseases of cats, yet a definitive diagnostic test, an effective treatment, and a reliable vaccine are lacking. With the decline in prevalence of feline leukemia virus from vaccination, FIP has become the deadliest infectious disease of cats.",
