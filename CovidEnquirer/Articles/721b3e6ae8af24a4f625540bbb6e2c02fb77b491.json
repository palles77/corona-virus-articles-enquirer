A correlation between the mechanical strength of mRNA pseudoknots and frameshifting efficiency has previously been found; however, the physical mechanism behind frameshifting still remains to be fully understood. In this study, we utilized synthetic sequences predicted to form mRNA pseudoknotlike structures. Surprisingly, the structures predicted to be strongest lead only to limited frameshifting. Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of pulse labelled proteins revealed that a significant fraction of the ribosomes were frameshifted but unable to pass the pseudoknot-like structures. Hence, pseudoknots can act as ribosomal roadblocks, prohibiting a significant fraction of the frameshifted ribosomes from reaching the downstream stop codon. The stronger the pseudoknot the larger the frameshifting efficiency and the larger its roadblocking effect. The maximal amount of full-length frameshifted product is produced from a structure where those two effects are balanced. Taking ribosomal roadblocking into account is a prerequisite for formulating correct frameshifting hypotheses.",

            "text": "Here, we focus on the frameshifting signal found in several viruses (1) , including infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) and SARS-CoV. The signal leads to programmed ribosomal \u00c01 frameshift, whereby multiple proteins are produced from a single polycistronic messenger RNA (mRNA) (4, 5) . The frameshift efficiency, i.e. the fraction of ribosomes, which change reading frame, is important to ensure a correct stoichiometric relationship between the different products of translation. It has been shown that altered frameshift efficiency has detrimental effects on the proliferation of HIV-I and the yeast L-A viruses (6, 7) . In order to induce \u00c01 frameshift, these viruses rely on three physical features on the mRNA: a heptanucleotide sequence, a spacer and a downstream structure (8) . The heptanucleotide sequence, called the slippery sequence, is where the \u00c01 frameshift occurs and typically has the following sequence: X XXY YYZ, where X, Y and Z denote nucleotide species and spaces indicate initial reading frame. The spacer is a stretch of 6-9 nt positioning the ribosome correctly at the slippery site when encountering the downstream structure. The downstream structure is most often found to be a pseudoknot. The pseudoknot structure probably functions as a physical barrier deforming upon approach of the translating ribosome (9) , thereby assisting the frameshifting process; however, geometry and surface charge of the structure may also play a role for the frameshifting (10) .",

However, many frameshift signals deviate little from those described for the virus-derived system used here and many signals are of such general character that ribosomes from different kingdoms of life will respond to them by shifting frame (12) . This happens not always with the same efficiency as in the original organism (12, 13) and there are even examples found where a frameshift element can direct the ribosomes into \u00c02 or +1 frameshift depending on the test organism (14) . Here, we challenged E. coli ribosomes by constructing artificial frameshifting signals containing pseudoknot-like structures with strong stems. Using a refined frameshift assay, involving two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis of pulse labelled proteins, we show that a significant amount of frameshifted ribosomes permanently stall within the strongest pseudoknots which therefore efficiently act as roadblocks.",

The fully assembled and translating 70S or 80S ribosomes seem to be more robust. It is, however, broadly accepted that mRNA secondary structures can function as obstacles to translating ribosomes (17, 18) although examples exists of large secondary structures in mRNA that are translated without any ribosomal delay (19) . Nevertheless, there is compelling evidence from in vitro experiments showing that ribosomes may pause upstream to such structures, most pronounced if the structures form pseudoknots (20) (21) (22) . Possibly the lack of rotational freedom in the helix of stem 1, due to the pairing in stem 2, makes pseudoknot structures harder to 'unzip' by the ribosome than simple stem-loop structures (23) . This may explain why pseudoknots can pause ribosomes. Examples from nature show the existence of diverse peptide sequences, often present in regulatory circuits, which will stall ribosomes (24), but to our knowledge, a permanent halt of ribosomes caused by mRNA structures has not been shown previously.",

            "text": "Recent single molecule investigations suggest that the mechanical strength of pseudoknots correlate with the ability of the pseudoknot to stimulate frameshift (25) (26) (27) , at least in a certain interval. However, the calculated Gibbs free energy does not always correlate with frameshift efficiency. Not only the strength of the stems, but also the interaction between the loop and the stems might be of importance for the ability to induce frameshift and for the overall mechanical strength and brittleness of the structure. If the pseudoknot becomes too strong the ribosome, frameshifted or not, might not be able to open it and continue translation, whereby the pseudoknot acts as a roadblock. Often in literature (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) frameshifting assays were performed on constructs exhibiting the common feature that the stop codon for the normal reading frame was located at the entrance of the pseudoknot (or inside the pseudoknot) and the stop codon for the successful \u00c01 frameshift was located downstream of the pseudoknot. In most frameshifting assays, the amount of frameshifting is determined by quantifying the amount of full-length frameshifted versus non-frameshifted products. However, for this to be a correct measure, the frameshifted ribosome must continue translation through the pseudoknot and beyond to the \u00c01 frameshifted stop codon. If the \u00c01 frameshifted ribosome permanently stalls inside the pseudoknot, it would falsely be interpreted as if the ribosome did not frameshift. Therefore, there is a serious pitfall in the classical methods which renders the amount of frameshifted ribosomes to be non-correctly determined, i.e. be underestimated, potentially leading to false hypotheses regarding the physical mechanism of frameshifting.",

Given the limited resolution of SDS-PAGE, it is, however, impossible to clearly differentiate between polypeptides produced by ribosomes that terminate at the in-frame UAA stop codon and ribosomes that undergo \u00c01 frameshift but stall within the pseudoknot.

However, the ratio was significantly larger than 1 for the more artificial pseudoknots which acted as roadblocks for a large amount of frameshifted ribosomes. The length of stem 1 did not significantly influence on the amount of frameshifted or stalled ribosomes. Interestingly, within pseudoknots with the same overall structure (22/6a-c) 22/6a stalls a significantly higher fraction of frameshifted ribosomes than 22/6b (verified by Student's t-test, n = 4, a = 0.05, P = 0.012), which again stalls more than 22/6c.

If such truncated transcripts were abundant, it would be difficult to distinguish between protein products from ribosomes stalled within the pseudoknot and protein products originating from ribosomes ending translation at 'non-stop' mRNAs having their 3 0 -ends within the pseudoknot sequence. In the latter case translation would be terminated by tmRNA trans-translation thus rendering the protein products unstable due to the tmRNA-encoded tag (36) . In the following subsections 'Identification of transcripts from the T7gene10-PK-lacZ gene fusions', 'Messenger RNA stability' and 'Coupling between translation and transcription is required for full-length transcripts', we will show that the observed proteins did indeed originate from stalled ribosomes and that they were not caused by other effects.",

Here, our gene10-lacZ fusion was even longer and transcription should take $120 s. Accordingly, all induced strains included in Figure 4 show a distinct smear of mRNA fragments recognized by all three probes. In order to examine the half-life of our artificial transcripts, we made experiments where transcription from the P tac promotor was stopped due to removal of the inducer ( Figure 5 ).

This fragment includes the transcription start in the 5 0 -end and the pseudoknot in the 3 0 -end. We suggest that the pseudoknot acts as an exonuclease barrier like the natural stem-loop structure in the 3 0 -end of the wild type lacZ transcript (37) and thereby induces a degradation intermediate of a distinct length with increased half life compared to unstructured mRNA sequences like those from construct 0. Alternatively, but not mutually exclusive, a pseudoknot acts like a rho-independent termination signal to the RNA polymerase.

These two downstream stop variants ('DS. stop' in Figure 6 ), which did not contain a stop codon upstream from the structure, expressed significantly more full-length ('Fl') transcript and only insignificant amounts of premature transcription stop fragment ('SP') compared to their sister constructs containing the UAA stop codon upstream from the structure ( Figure 6 ). Our control construct, PK401, which stimulated 14% frameshift, showed no premature transcription stop fragment ('SP') and therefore no change in transcription pattern was observed as a consequence of removing the upstream UAA stop codon ( Figure 6 ) thus confirming that the major effect causing the 'SP' fragment is polarity in the lacZ gene and not transcription termination caused by the pseudoknot sequences. Also, the very short band marked by 'asterisks' that appeared from the 22/6a construct was not present in the 'DS. stop' variant ( Figure 6 ).

            "text": "The structures analysed in this study are artificial and were designed to fold into pseudoknot-like structures with a gradually increasing mechanical strength. The mechanical strength was adjusted by changing the base pairs of the two stems, which seems to be a reasonable way of crudely varying the mechanical strength, as the energy involved in base pairing is higher than the energies involved in, e.g. the electrostatic interaction of the loop with the stems. It is, however, likely that the loop-stem interaction, surface charges or other players than just mechanical strength influence frameshift stimulating effect of mRNA structures. As there is a consensus in recent literature that pseudoknot mechanical strength correlates with frameshifting efficiency (23) (24) (25) , it was intriguing that the amount of frameshifted product was reduced by the stronger pseudoknot 22/6a compared to the weaker 22/ 6b or c ( Figure 3A ). This proved to be caused by stalling of a significant amount of frameshifted ribosomes by the strong pseudoknots ( Figure 3B ). Future studies will show whether significant stalling can also be caused by naturally occurring pseudoknots.",

No evidence was found of a specific population of transcripts that could explain the amounts of protein products attributed to originate from pseudoknot-stalled ribosomes. Also, our protein-stability assay showed that the translational products from the stalled ribosomes were stable for at least 80 min (Supplementary Figure S1) , thus indicating that the stalled ribosomes are not rescued by tmRNA and that the stalled proteins do not originate from truncated mRNA.",

A pulse chase experiment (Supplementary Figure S2 ) revealed that within 16 min there was no sign of a redistribution of label between the stalled spots and the stop codon-terminated downstream stop product, thus proving the possibility of very slow ribosomes to be unlikely. It is possible that the newly discovered ribosome rescue factor, ArfA (39) could be active at pseudoknot-stalled ribosomes and that nascent proteins would be more stable than if saved by tmRNA. However, as can be seen in Supplementary Figure S3 , the growth of strains expressing pseudoknot 22/6a was severely affected by induction and showed a decrease in growth rate correlating to the amount of stall product observed. Because ribosomes are limiting in growing cells (40) , the sequestration of ribosomes by engagement in induced overexpression of a gene from a plasmid will often cause a strain to grow slower than the uninduced counterpart. The enhanced reduction in growth rate upon induction of 22/6a compared to the 0 construct (Supplementary Figure S3 ) could indicate that stalled ribosomes were not rescued at a sufficiently high rate and we suggest that either the ribosomal rescue systems were titrated by the large amount of mRNA induced from the plasmid alleles, or alternatively, that no rescue is possible for pseudoknot-stalled ribosomes.",

Possibly, evolution optimized viral pseudoknots to balance these two effects. Hence, in measurements of frameshifting efficiency it is important to take into account the roadblocking effect of mRNA pseudoknots. Figure 7 . Model of frameshifting efficiency. Increasing the strength of a pseudoknot causes the pseudoknot to induce frameshifting at a higher frequency. However, the stronger the pseudoknot the larger the likelihood that it will act as a roadblock for the ribosome, reducing the amount of frameshifted product produced. The optimal frameshifting efficiency is achieved by balancing the two contributions.",
