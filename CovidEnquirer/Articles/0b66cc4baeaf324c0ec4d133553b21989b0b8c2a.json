However, although a protein product has been identified from the 3c open reading frame, to date the coding function of 3a and 3b has not been established. We present nucleotide sequence data suggesting that each of the three open reading frames is conserved in a variety of different IBV strains and further show, through the preparation of monospecific antisera against bacterial fusion proteins, that IBVinfected cells contain small amounts of the products of these ORFs. In vitro translation studies using synthetic mRNAs containing the 3a, 3b, and 3c open reading frames suggest strongly that all three proteins can be translated from a single molecular species, and expression studies carried out in intact cells support this conclusion. Thus mRNA3 of IBV appears to be functionally tricistronic.",

            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the type species of the Coronaviridae, a family of viruses which possess a large continuous positive-sense singlestranded RNA genome. The genomic RNA of these viruses is capped and polyadenylated and is by itself infectious (Schochetman eta/., 1977; Lomniczi, 1977) , indicating that it can act directly in the infected cell as a virus mRNA. Boursnell et al. (1987) , through cloning of cDNA, deduced the complete nucleotide sequence of the genomic RNA of IBV and showed it to be 27 kb in length, with at least 10 distinct open reading frames (ORFs). However, it appears that most of these are not translated from genomic RNA but are expressed from a set of subgenomic mRNAs. Available evidence indicates that in virus-infected cells, six subgenomic mRNA species are produced. These mRNAs, designated 2 to 6 (the genomic mRNA is designated mRNA1) (Cavanagh et a/., 1990) , range in length from about 2 to 7 kb and have been shown to share a common 3' terminus and to form a \"nested\" set structure (Stern and Kennedy, 1980a, b) . Three of these, mRNAs 6, 4, and 2, appear to be functionally monocistronic; in vitro translation studies have shown that they encode the major virion structural proteins nucleocapsid (N-mRNAG), membrane (M-mRNA4), and spike (S-mRNA2), and in each case the expressed ORF is the only one which is not present on the next smallest mRNA in the nested set ( Fig. 1) . Each of the other mRNAs, however, contains more than one ORF in its \"5' unique\" region, suggesting that it may be function-ally polycistronic. We describe here studies designed to test this possibility for mRNA3.",

We have previously shown that one of these, 3c, is indeed expressed in IBV-infected cells (Smith et a/., 1990) , but so far the coding function of 3a and 3b has not been definitely established. We report that infected cells also contain proteins corresponding to the 3a and 3b ORFs, indicating that mRNA3 is indeed functionally polycistronic.

Additional IBV strains were grown in eggs to produce genomic RNA for nucleotide sequencing. These strains were: USA/M41/41 (isolated in 1941); UW183/66 (Dawson (1987) . An extraction solution was prepared by mixing at 65\": 250 g guanidinium thiocyanate (Fluka); 17.6 ml of 0.75 M sodium citrate, pH 7; 26.4 ml of 10% sarcosyl; 293 ml of water. On the day of use 72 ~1 of 2-mercaptoethanol was added per 10 ml of the extraction solution. Clarified allantoic fluid from eggs infected with IBV was centrifuged at 34,000 Q for 90 min to pellet virions. The pellet was resuspended in 2 ml of extraction solution and the following solutions were added sequentially: 0.2 ml 2 M sodium acetate, pH 4.0; 2 ml phenol; 0.4 ml chloroform/isoamyl alcohol mixture (49:l). The mixture was shaken for 5 min and centrifuged at 10,000 Q for 20 min at 4\". RNA was recovered from the aqueous phase by ethanol precipitation and centrifugation.

A similar picture emerged from comparative analysis of the 3c ORFs, with the Beaudette and M41 strains once again forming rather distinct group from the others. In this case, however, although the beginning of the ORF (i.e., the first Met codon) occupies an identical genetic location in each case, the point at which the ORF terminates is somewhat variable, with the 322/82 ORF truncated by 16 amino acids in comparison to the Beaudette strain, and the 68/84 and 183/66 ORFs missing 3 and 2 amino acids, respectively.

Although a relatively high background of nonspecific precipitation was observed, the anti-3a serum detected a weak band with the electrophoretic migration expected for 3a, as judged by comparison with in vitro-translated 3a. That this does indeed represent the product of the 3a ORF is suggested by the fact that this protein was not precipitated from the same lysate by either preimmune serum or by hyperimmune sera directed against other PEX fusion protein. In addition, it was not detected in mock-infected control lysate using either specific or nonspecific antisera. The protein was not detectable in unprecipitated infected ceil lysates, even after a long exposure, suggesting that it is present in very small amounts. The anti-3b antiserum was likewise able to precipitate, although very weakly, a small protein of the size ex- petted for the 3b product as judged by its coelectrophoresis with in vitro-translated 3b. Once again comparison with control immunoprecipitations from infected and mock-infected cells supports the idea this is indeed the 3b product.

To investigate this possibility directly, mRNAs containing the three ORFs were synthesized artificially using the T7 phage RNA polymerase and tested in the wheat germ cell-free translation system for their ability to direct synthesis of each protein. Plasmids plBT4, plBT5, and PIBTG (Fig. 6a) were digested with Hindlll and transcribed in vitro using T7 RNA polymerase. The resulting transcripts were then translated in wheat germ cell-free extracts (Fig. 6b) . RNA transcripts from HindIll-digested plBT4 plasmid DNA, which should contain each of the 3a, b, and c ORFs, directed the synthesis of a protein of MW approximately 12K, corresponding to the 3c product (Smith et al., 1990 ) and in addition a large amount of a smaller proteins of approximately 7K, the expected MW of the 3a products. A faint band migrating slightly more slowly than this protein was also observed; this protein is of the expected size for a product of the 3b ORF. RNA transcripts from Hindlll-digested plBT5, which contained only the 3b and 3c ORFs, directed the synthesis of two products migrating at the positions of 3b and 3c as above. Similarly, one major product, which migrated at the position of 3c, was produced from plBT6 transcripts. Further evidence for the identity of these products was obtained by translation of mRNA from HindIll-, A&l-, and Xbal-digested plBT4. As predicted, the 12K protein was not synthesized in response to transcripts from Pvull-digested plBT4 DNA (containing only the 3a and b ORFs), suggesting that it does indeed represent the products of 3c (Fig. 6b) . Translation of RNA from Xbaldigested plBT4DNA (containing the 3a ORF alone) produced only a small protein of approximately 7K, confirming its identity as a product of the 3a ORF. During the course of these experiments, we constructed an additional series of plasmids, bearing 3c alone, 3b + 3c, and 3a f 3b + 3c (plBT1, plBT2, and plBT3, respectively, Methods), which differed in that they were based on a different T7 promoter-containing plasmid and lacked any globin sequences upstream or downstream of the IBV ORFs. Translation of mRNAs transcribed from these plasmids is shown in Fig. 6c . Once again the polypeptides produced were of the expected sizes for the products of the 3a, 3b, and 3c ORFs. The translation product of plBTl-derived RNA included two minor species running just below 3c; the higher of these bands appears to represent a product derived by internal initiation from the residual portion of the M gene present at the 3'end of the transcript, since it was not seen when shorter transcripts were translated; the lower of the two probably represents a premature termination product related to 3c. One surprising aspect of these results was that the relative proportions of the proteins synthesized in response to plBT3-derived mRNA differed markedly from those observed on translation of mRNA from plBT4 in that with plBT3, the 3c protein was clearly the most abundant product, initiation at the 3a and 3b ORFs occurring very inefficiently. Other studies underway in this laboratory suggest that this difference may be due to the fortuitous formation of some kind of secondary or tertiary RNA structure by the vector-derived 5' noncoding sequence of this particular mRNA, which blocks synthesis of 3a and 3b, but not 3c; the effect was not seen with synthetic tricistronic mRNAs containing other 5 noncoding sequences, and it could be abolished by a number of single nucleotide substitutions near the 5' end (data not shown). Further work is in progress to investigate this phenomenon. Interpretation of the translational patterns produced by these tricistronic mRNAs, however, is complicated by the close similarity in molecular weight between the 3a-and the 3b-encoded products and the difficulty in routinely separating the two proteins by gel electrophoresis. In order to facilitate further studies on initiation at each of the three ORFs, we therefore altered plBT4 by site-directed mutagenesis to fuse the 3a, 3b, and 3c ORFs together (plBMG), thereby creating one continuous 3abc ORF. Since the ORFs overlap to some extent, in different reading frames, this can be accomplished through the introduction of a single additional nucleotide within the overlap between 3a and 3b and two additional nucleotides within the overlap between 3b and 3c, at positions which would be unlikely to influence the efficiency of initiation at the subsequent start codon (see Methods and Fig. 6a ). The rationale for this is that if translation of the 3a, 3b, and 3c ORFs can be initiated separately as expected, a mRNA bearing this continuous ORF should yield three new products with MW 27K (corresponding to the 3abc fusion protein), 20K (3bc fusion protein), and 12.4K (3c protein alone). Figure 6b shows that mRNA transcribed from /-/indIlldigested plBM6 does indeed encode polypeptides of the expected MW. Moreover, the proportions of the three products synthesized in response to this mRNA, taking into account the number of methionine residues carried by each, are broadly similar to those of the separate proteins translated from plBT4-directed mRNA.",

The point at which the leader joins the body of the subgenomic mRNA is characterized by a core region of homology (CTTAACAA), and for mRNA3 the precise sequence at the junction between the leader and the body has been established (Brown et al,, 1986) . We therefore wished to investigate the effect on the translational capacity of the artificial IBV mRNA3 of an authentic IBV 5'leader sequence.

The result of this experiment is shown in Fig. 8 . Transient expression of a protein with the characteristics of 3abc was clearly detectable in cells transfected with plBTl3, but not in untransfected cells. In addition a protein corresponding to the 3bc ORF was also produced, indicating that initation of translation had occurred at both the 3a and the 3b start sites. It was more difficult to detect a product initiating at the 3c start site, although a faint band was observed (migrating just below the background band).

These novel proteins are of the expected size for the products of the 3a and 3b ORFs, that is 6.7K and 7.4K, respectively, and furthermore they comigrate during SDS-gel electrophoresis with the 3a and 3b proteins synthesized by in vitro translation of synthetic mRNAs.

            "text": "How might the expression of all three ORFs be achieved from a single species of mRNA? The pattern of translation observed in vitro from mRNAs containing all three ORFs suggested that initiation occurred most efficiently on the ORF nearest the 5'end of the mRNA, 3a, with the two downstream ORFs being translated much less frequently. The sequence around the 3a start codon (CUGUUUGAUGAUC) has U at position -3 and A at +4; around the 3b start codon (UAGA-CUAAUGUUA) it has C at position -3 and U at +4; and around the 3c start codon (UCAGGUGAUGAUG) it has a G at position -3 (for both possible start codons) and A at +4. According to Kozak's scanning model for translational initiation (Kozak, 1989 ) the utilization of an AUG codon as an initiation signal for translation is determined both by its location within the mRNA molecule and by the sequences surrounding it (sequence context). From a survey of known initiation signals, Kozak (1987) concluded that the optimal sequence context for initiation of translation is 5'-CCACCAUGG, with the presence of a purine residue at the -3 and +4 positions being of primary importance for the efficient recognition of the AUG as initiation signal. However, if the sequence context around the AUG is suboptimal, ribosomes may fail to initiate and could therefore scan past, initiating instead at AUG codons located downstream. By these criteria, the 3a and 3b initiation codons are in a relatively poor context for ribosome recognition, while the 3c initiation codon is in a relatively good context. It seems therefore that a \"leaky scanning\" model (Kozak, 1989) could explain the pattern of expression of mRNA3; most ribosomes scanning from the 5' end of the mRNA would initiate at 3a, but a proportion would pass on to the next possible AUG, at the beginning of 3b, and those failing to initiate here would proceed to the start of 3c. Consistent with this possibility, the nucleotide sequence of 3a and 3b contains no AUG triplets, in any reading frame, other than those linearized at different points. The plasmids were constructed as described under Methods and in Fig. 2 7. (a) Diagram of plasmids plBTl2 and plBTl3 showing the T7 promoter site, the 5' UTR (constructed to correspond to the natural IBV mRNA 5' leader sequence) in relation to the 3a, b, and c ORFs, and the restriction enzyme sites used to linearize the plasmids for in vitro transcription. Also shown are the sizes of the in vitro translation products expected from initiation at the beginning of each of the three ORFs on mRNA transcribed from plasmids linearized at different points.

Translation products were labeled with [36S]methionine, separated on a 22% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, and detected by fluorography. HMW, molecular weight markers. used for initiation. However, in IBV-infected cells it appeared that the 3c polypeptide was more abundant than 3a or 3b, which would be surprising if 3c were only recognized by ribosomes which failed to initiate at 3a and 3b (particularly in view of our results indicating that the 3a initiation codon could function efficiently during in vitro translation). Direct comparison of the relative amounts of the 3a, 3b, and 3c polypeptides in infected cells, however, rests on the assumption that the antisera directed against 3a, 3b, and 3c recognize their targets with similar efficiencies; this appears to be the case using in vitro-synthesized proteins (data not shown), but may not be the case for the native proteins produced in infected cells. Nevertheless it remains quite possible that the 3c ORF may be translated from mRNA3 by some alternative to the leaky scanning mechanism. Synthetic tricistronic mRNAs derived from the plasmids plBT3 and plBT4 directed the synthesis of similar amounts of 3c in vitro, whereas production of 3a and 3b was very much lower from plBT3 transcripts (Fig. 6) , suggesting independent translational initiation of 3c. We are currently investigating this possibility further.",

The predicted amino acid sequence of these proteins, compared with the Beaudette strain(Boursnell eta/., 1985), is shown in Figs. 3a and 3b, and their comparative features are listed inTable 1. It is evident that the 3a ORF is highly conserved in position, length, and sequence similarity. The 3a ORFs of the Beaudette and M41 strains are particu-larly closely related, with the other strains appearing to form a rather more distant group. The amino acid variation observed in these strains, however, did not in general alter the overall hydrophobic character of the protein observed originally by Boursnell et al.(1985). The 3b ORF, although also similar in position and length in each case, showed greater diversity in sequence, with the 322182, 68184, and 183166 strains again appearing closely related to each other, but up to 22% differentTABLE1 can be induced in Escherichia co/i POP2136 cells COMPARISON OF THE POSITION OF TRANSLATION STOP CODON AND THE (which carry a temperature-sensitive repressor) simply NUMBERS (%) OF AMINO ACID DIFFERENCES IN mRNA3 OF FIVE DIFFERENT by increasing the culture temperature to 42\".
