Of these, 3,686 (98%) were located in Canada or the United States. In Germany, 6 laboratories received at least 1 of 3 samples, 2 for virus antigen detection and 1 for virus culture; all contained live virus and were formatted identically. No information on infectivity or virulence of the samples was available. Because of the absence of human-to-human influenza A H2N2 virus transmission since 1968, this situation provided the rare opportunity to investigate whether infections with this strain had occurred in any of the laboratories.",

No notable abnormalities were present on thoracic radiograph, abdominal ultrasonograph, urinalysis, and tests for feline leukemia and immunodeficiency virus. Skin biopsy specimens were collected for histologic examination, and swabs of the exudates were submitted for bacterial culture. Histopathologic findings demonstrated ulcers and dermal granulation tissue with linearly arranged eosinophils, mast cells, neutrophils, and plasma cells between dense, homogeneous collagen bundles (sclerosing dermatitis). This pattern of inflammation is distinct from most staphylococcal infections of the skin, and it has been suggested that this uncommon histologic finding in cats is associated with methicillin-resistant staphylococcal infection (1) .",
