Studies have shown that the interpersonal transmission ability of COVID-19 corresponds to SARS, but its doubling time (6 to 7 days) is shorter than that of SARS (about 9 days) [1, 7] , and the passage interval of COVID-19 is also relatively short. The second generation of COVID-19 cases unrelated to Wuhan has gradually appeared, which has also contributed to a sharp increase in short-term confirmed cases, resulting in a serious situation of COVID-19 prevention and control, and thus it is now very difficult to predict the epidemic trend.",

The information of 853 confirmed COVID-19 patients obtained from the website of health committees of 18 provinces. A descriptive epidemiological analysis method was employed to carefully analyze the epidemic characteristics. Subsequently, the COVID-19 epidemic data in Wuhan and other inland regions of China was analyzed separately and compared. A multivariate function model was constructed based on the confirmed COVID-19 case data. Results The growth rate of new cases and deaths of COVID-19 were significantly faster than those of 2003-SARS. The number of confirmed cases in Wuhan and other inland areas both showed increasing trends. 853 confirmed COVID-19 cases aged 1 months to 94 years and the average age was (45.05 \u00b1 17.22) years. The gender ratio (M: F) was 1.12: 1. Conclusions The fatality rate of COVID-19 is lower than that of 2003-SARS and the cure rate is higher. The age of COVID-19 patients is mainly concentrated in the 30-50 years old (60.61%). The harm of the first-generation COVID-19 patients is higher than that of secondary cases.

The main process of COVID-19 in China was shown in Figure 7. Meanwhile, governments across China were also actively adopting strict measures. The appropriate performance of the Chinese government and local governments at all levels to deal with COVID-19 was due to the experience accumulated in the SARS disposal process and the great development of public health system in the past 17 years. The COVID-19 epidemic has brought a significant impact on the health and normal lives of the residents and the social and economic development of China. In addition, it was catching up with the Chinese Lunar New Year, and the above adverse effects are even more prominent. However, until now, the etiology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of COVID-19 are unclear, which has made it difficult to effectively contain the epidemic. Under this background, the latest data of COVID-19 epidemic was collected to conduct a detailed analysis, and compared with the relevant characteristics of 2013-SARS.
