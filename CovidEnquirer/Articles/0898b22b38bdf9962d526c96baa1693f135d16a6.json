            "text": "The hepatitis E virus (HEV) ORF1 gene encodes the non-structural polyprotein wherein the 'X-domain' still remains poorly defined. Cellular X-domain associated macrodomain protein/ADP-ribose-1\u2033-monophosphatase (Appr-1\u2033-pase) activities are also reported in coronaviruses (CoV), including identification of its homologs in alpha and rubella viruses. The present study investigated the role(s) of X-domain residues in HEV replication cycle. In silico analysis showed a high degree of evolutionary conservation of X-domain (a.a. 785-942) a.a. positions wherein the N-terminus residues 'Asn806, Asn809, His812, Gly815, Gly816, and Gly817' formed a potential catalytic-site homolog of CoVAppr-1\u2033-pase. To experimentally test this prediction, X-domain 'active-site' residues were subjected to mutational analysis using the HEV-SAR55 replicon (pSK-GFP). FACS analysis of mutant RNA transfected S10-3 cells showed that Gly816Ala and Gly817Ala constructs completely abrogated HEV replication, similar to their Gly816Val and Gly817Val counterparts. However, 'Gly815Ala' mutant replicated very poorly in contrast to 'Gly815Val' that completely abolished GFP synthesis. Furthermore, while 'Asn806Ala' mutant retained RNA replication, the 'Asn809Ala' and His812Leu mutants showed non-viability. Notably, in a sequential-nucleotide mutation analysis, the dispensability of X-domain in HEV replication at transcriptional level has already been demonstrated (Parvez, 2013b) . Taken together, the present data strongly argue for an essential role of X-domain residues (Asn809, His812, Gly816 and Gly817) at post-translational level, indicating its involvement in viral replication. In conclusion, the speculated regulatory role of ORF1 X-domain in HEV replication cycle critically depends on the 'Asn, Asn, His, Gly, Gly, Gly' segment/secondary structure. Nevertheless, further biochemical or biophysical characterizations of HEV X-domain associated Appr-1\u2033-pase activity would only confirm its biological significance in virus or host-pathogenesis.",

Classified as the only member of the Hepeviridae family, human HEV is recognized with at least four genotypes (HEV1, HEV2, HEV3, and HEV4). Compared to HEV1 and HEV2, HEV3 and HEV4 have potential zoonosis in swine, including some other mammalian species such as boar, deer, rat, rabbit, camel, and bat (Meng, 2013) . The virus is non-enveloped with a plus-sense, single-stranded RNA genome (~7.2 kb) that contains three open reading frames: ORF1, ORF2 and ORF3 (Tam et al., 1991) . Of these, ORF1 gene is the largest (5109 bases) that codes for the non-structural/replicase polyprotein of 1703 a.a. (~186 kDa), essential for viral replication cycle (Ansari et al., 2000; Parvez, 2013b) . Based on amino acid (a.a.) sequence homology of plus-strand RNA virus polyproteins, Koonin et al. (1992) had proposed methyltransferase (MeT), papain-like cysteine protease (PCP), prolinerich (P), RNA helicase (Hel/NTPase) and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) as well as undefined 'X' and 'Y' domains within HEV ORF1.",

Further, each amplicon was digested with Dpn I (Invitrogen, USA) in a 10 \u03bcl reaction volume at 37\u00b0C for 1.5 h. The digested mix (5 \u03bcl each) was transformed into DH5\u03b1 XL-blue competent cells (Strata gene, USA) by the heat-shock method and plated on ampicillin-containing agar plates. Following an overnight incubation at 37\u00b0C, bacterial colonies were picked and plasmids (Qiagen Plasmid Mini-prep Kit, Germany) were screened by restriction digestion. Mutant plasmids were confirmed by DNA sequencing (Invitrogen, USA) and stocks were prepared (Qiagen Plasmid Maxi-prep Kit, Germany).",

Notably, the 'Gly \u2192 Val' mutants had been previously studied (Parvez, 2013b) . Since differential phenotypic effect of 'Gly \u2192 Val' compared to 'Gly \u2192 Ala' had been observed on enzymatic activity in RUBV, the 'Gly \u2192 Ala' mutants were compared with their 'Val' counterparts. FACS analysis showed GFP-positive and negative cells in pSK-GFP-WT and pSK-GFP-G816V transfection controls, respectively (Fig. 4) . Of the mutant replicons, Gly816Ala and Gly817Ala constructs completely abrogated HEV replication, similar to their Gly816Val and Gly817Val counterparts, respectively (Fig. 4) . However, the Gly815Ala mutant replicated very poorly (~30%) in contrast to Gly815Val that rendered GFP synthesis similar to wild-type. Furthermore, upstream to 'Gly' triad, while the Asn806Ala mutant retained RNA replication by approximately 65% compared to wild-type, Asn809Ala and His812Leu mutants showed non-viability (Fig. 4) .

            "text": "Plus-strand RNA virus encoded X-domain associated Appr-1\u2033-pase activity has been identified in HCoV-229E, SARS-CoV and TGEV, including its homologs in bovine transmissible virus (BoTV), RUBV, SFV, and HEV (Gorbalenya et al., 1991; Koonin et al., 1992; Putics et al., 2005; Draker et al., 2006) . The predictions on potential active site residues derived from crystal structure as well as genetically-close viral X-domains, and available HEV sequence homology analysis led to map X-domain 'Asn806, Asn809, His812, Gly815, Gly816, and Gly817' stretch that could constitute the HEV Appr-1\u2033-pase active site. In the published Xdomain crystal structures, the Appr-1\u2033-pase active site includes a 'His' followed by 'Gly-Gly-Gly' residues and two upstream 'Asn' residues. The 'Gly' triad forms part of the loop that connects 'Asn' containing \u03b2strand 3 and \u03b1-helix 1. Similarly, in the ADPR-binding site of the CoV X-domains, the cleft is lined by the 'Gly' triad at the C-terminus of the \u03b23-\u03b12 (L5) loop wherein the second Gly makes a bond with the distal ribose (Egloff et al., 2006) . This prediction (of putative HEV Appr-1\u2033-pase active-site) was further tested experimentally using the pSK-GFP (viral full-length genomic replicon)/S10-3 culture system. In the present study, the replicon contained GFP reporter gene in place of HEV ORF2 coding sequences that could allow monitoring of viral RNA replication (Emerson et al., 2004) . In our RNA transfections,~50-60% cells show GFP-positivity with wild-type replicon compared to mock or Gly816Val/Gly817Val mutant-transfected GFP-negative cells (fluorescence microscopic observations). All a.a. mutant replicons were therefore, compared with controls for their replication fitness or viability by FACS scoring of GFP-positive/negative cells. In TGEV, papain-like protease 1(PL1 pro ) was shown to cleave the polyproteins (nsp2/nsp3) at Gly879-Gly880 within the 'Gly878-Gly879-Gly880' triad of the downstream X-domain that had an Appr-1\u2033-pase activity, too . Likewise, downstream to its protease domain, RUBV polyprotein cleavagesubstrate Gly1300-Gly1301 within the X-domain 'Gly1299-Gly1300-Gly1301' triad has been characterized (Chen et al., 1996) . In line with this, I have previously demonstrated the indispensability of ORF1 Xdomain Gly816-Gly817 residues in the conserved 'Gly815-Gly816-Gly817' triad in HEV replication that was however, predicted as viral PCP cleavage-substrate (Parvez, 2013b) . This is supported by the yeast macrodomain protein crystal structure (Allen et al., 2003) suggesting the viral 'Gly' triad's contribution in substrate-binding through mainchain atoms. Because the HEV X-domain Gly \u2192 Val (larger, branched side-chain) mutants had already been characterized (Parvez, 2013b) , in the present study, the three 'Gly' were substituted with small sidechain residue 'Ala'. Thus, the three 'Gly \u2192 Ala' mutant replicons were analyzed along with their 'Gly \u2192 Val' counterparts to see their differential effects, if any, on HEV RNA replication. FACS analysis of transfected cells revealed that 'Gly816Ala and Gly817Ala' completely abrogated RNA replication, similar to 'Gly816Val and Gly817Val', respectively. However, 'Ala' mutant of 'Gly815' produced very little GFP, in contrast to its 'Val' counterpart that completely abolished GFP synthesis. This was in absolute agreement with RUBV X-domain 'Gly1299-Gly1300-Gly1301' triad where the second and third 'Gly' when substituted to either 'Val' or 'Ala' produced non-viable replicons in cultured cells (Chen et al., 1996) . In a biochemical study, Putics et al. (2005) showed that the 'Gly \u2192 Val' substitutions reduced the CoV X-domain associated Appr-1\u2033-pase activities more strongly than the corresponding 'Gly \u2192 Ala' changes. Importantly, while the 'Gly' triad is conserved in most CoVs, the TGEV and feline CoV (FCoV) analogs have Met and Val, respectively at the first place (Fig. 1B) , and substitution of the second or third 'Gly' dramatically changes the X-domain structure. This strongly supports the essentiality of 'Gly816 and Gly817' residues in HEV X-domain activity and virus replication.",

In this study, while the HEV Asn806Ala mutant replicated to 2/3rd efficiency, Asn809Ala and His812Leu mutants completely abolished RNA replication. This was in conformity with HCoV-229E and SARS-CoV X-domain catalytic center residues where the second 'Asn' was reported essential for Appr-1\u2033pase activity (Karras et al., 2005; Putics et al., 2005) . Notably, in a sequential mutation analysis, the dispensability of X-domain nucleotides (nos. 2396-2910) in virus replication at transcriptional level has been clearly demonstrated (Parvez, 2013b) . Taken together, the present data therefore, strongly argue for an essential role of X-domain a.a. residues (Asn809, His812, Gly816, and Gly817) at post-translational level, indicating its enzymatic (most likely, Appr-1\u2033-pase) activity in HEV life cycle.",

And interestingly, while the animal CoV, HCoV-229E X-domain was shown to bind ADP-ribose in vitro, its homolog of avian CoV, the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) failed to do so despite structural similarity (Piotrowski et al., 2009 ). An explanation for this could be the host/substrate-specific activity of Appr-1\u2033-pase that might provide a selective advantage in viral replication or/and modulation of host-factors during natural infection. In conclusion, the regulatory/catalytic role of ORF1 X-domain in HEV life cycle critically depends on 'Asn806, Asn809, His812, Gly815, Gly816, Gly817' sequences/secondary structure elements that could be further modulated by the upstream PCP/P-domain. Nevertheless, biochemical or biophysical characterization of ORF1 X-domain associated Appr-1\u2033pase activity, including identification of relevant substrate(s) and their significance in virus or/and host remains inconclusive.",
