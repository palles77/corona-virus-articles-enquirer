We observed the highest viral load in throat swabs at the time of symptom onset, and inferred that infectiousness peaked on or before symptom onset. We estimated that 44% of transmission could occur before first symptoms of the index. Disease control measures should be adjusted to account for probable substantial pre-symptomatic transmission.",

Whereas a recent study from Wuhan reported that virus was detected for a median of 20 days (up to 37 days amongst survivors) after symptom onset, 11 infectiousness may decline significantly after 10 days. 12 Together this supports our findings that the infectiousness profile may more closely resemble that of influenza than of SARS (Figure 1a ), although we did not have data on viral shedding before symptom onset for COVID-19. 9, 13 Our results are also supported by reports on asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission. 14, 15 For a reproductive number of 2.5, 2 contact tracing and isolation alone are less likely to be successful if more than 30% of transmission occurred before symptom onset, unless >90% of the contacts can be traced. 16 Such high ascertainment is more likely achievable if the definition of contacts covered 2-3 days prior to symptom onset of the index case, as is being done in Hong Kong since 22 February and in mainland China since 21 February. Even when control strategy is shifting away from containment to mitigation as the pandemic unfolds, contact tracing would still be an important measure, such as when there are superspreading events that may occur in frail and high-risk groups such as nursing homes or hospitals.

Second, the serial intervals from clear transmission chains, combined with information on the incubation period distribution, were used to infer the infectiousness profile as described below.",

Infectiousness, i.e. transmission probability to a secondary case, would then increase until reaching its peak (Figure 1 ). The transmission event would occur at time tI with a probability described by the infectiousness profile \u03b2(tI -tS1) relative to the illness onset date, assuming a gamma distribution. The secondary case would then show symptoms at time tS2, after the incubation period that is assumed to follow a lognormal distribution g(tS2 -tI). Hence the observed serial intervals distribution f(tS2 -tS1) would be the convolution between the infectiousness profile and incubation period distribution. We constructed a likelihood function based on the convolution which was fitted to the observed serial intervals, allowing for the start of infectiousness around symptom onset. Parameters were estimated using maximum likelihood. We also performed sensitivity analyses by fixing the start of infectiousness at day 4 and 7 respectively before symptom onset and inferred the infectiousness profile.",

Serial samples were collected from some but not all patients for clinical monitoring purposes. We collected information reported on possible human-to-human transmission pairs of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients from publicly available sources including announcements made by government health agencies and media reports in mainland China /regions outside of China. A transmission pair was defined as two confirmed COVID-19 cases who were identified in the epidemiologic investigation showing a clear epidemiologic link with each other and one case (infectee) was highly likely infected by the other (infector), by fulfilling the following criteria: 1) the infectee did not report a travel history to an area affected by COVID-19 or any contact with other confirmed or suspected COVID-19 cases except for the infector within 14 days before symptom onset; and 2) the infector and infectee were not identified in a patient cluster where other COVID-19 cases had also been confirmed; and 3) the infector and infectee pair did not share a common source of exposure to a COVID-19 case or a place where there were COVID-19 case(s) reported. We excluded possible transmission pairs without a clear exposure history reported prior to symptom onset. Data of possible transmission pairs of COVID-19 were extracted, including age, sex, location, date of symptom onset, type or relationship between the pair cases, and time of contact of the cases.",
