Main protease (M pro ) of SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is an important target to discover pharmaceutical compounds for the therapy of this life-threatening disease. During the course of screening new anti-SARS agents, we have identified that a series of unsymmetrical aromatic disulfides inhibited SARS-CoV M pro significantly for the first time. Herein, 40 novel unsymmetrical aromatic disulfides were synthesized chemically and their biological activities were evaluated in vitro against SARS-CoV M pro . These novel compounds displayed excellent IC 50 data in the range of 0.516e5.954 mM.",

Its sudden emergence and rapid outbreak during 2002e2003 had resulted in~800 deaths among >8000 reported individual cases worldwide [1] . Although the SARS epidemic had been under control for years, reemergence of this threatening illness is still a possible risk and potentially new strains of SARS can be more dangerous than the previous ones. A number of important targets have been recognized to take part in the biological events critical to SARS-CoV replication, among which a papain-like protease (PL pro ) and a chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro ) are of significant importance to design anti-SARS inhibitors [2] . The 3CL pro , also known as the main protease (M pro ), has attracted much attention, which could be revealed from numerous publications about novel inhibitor discovery. Crystal structures of SARS-CoV M pro , either free enzyme alone or in complex with an inhibitor, had been determined to facilitate the structural and functional investigation of this protease [3, 4] . The active site of SARS-CoV M pro contains Cys145 and His41 to constitute a catalytic dyad, in which cysteine functions as the common nucleophile in the proteolytic process.",

The inhibitory activities of these compounds were then validated by in vitro protease assays. In most cases the kinetic study indicated that the inhibitor is involved in an irreversible process by forming a covalent bond with Cys145, while in some other cases the inhibition is actually a reversible behavior. The reported SARS-CoV M pro inhibitors covered a variety of different chemical scaffolds, which contain peptidomimetic compounds, 3-quinoline carboxylic acid derivatives, thiophene-2-carboxylate derivatives, zinc-conjugated compounds, cinanserin, calmodulin, keto-glutamine analogues, anilide, bifunctional boronic acid compounds, isatin derivatives, etacrynic acid derivatives, serine derivatives, trifluoromethyl ketones, acetamides, pyrazolone and quercertins [5e12] . It is a pity that research on drugs and vaccines towards SARS or SARS-like coronavirus has not brought any candidate for clinical use. Hence there still exists an urgent need to discover and identify new SARS-CoV M pro agents, especially those compounds from totally new chemical families, to develop effective therapy against this fatal viral infection.",

There are a few cases that simple disulfides such as diallyl disulfide and dimethyl disulfide exhibit hypochlorous acid scavenging activity and tyrosinase inhibitory activity ( Fig. 1A) [14, 15] . The unsymmetrical disulfide compounds are useful tools in the research of dynamic combinatorial chemistry [16] . These compounds have also been reported to display a variety of biological activities. For examples, Turos et al. reported that some unsymmetrical aryl-alkyl disulfides were inhibitors of methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus anthracis (Fig. 1B ) [17] , while Khosla and co-workers published some unsymmetrical disulfides that could selectively inhibit extracellular thioredoxin (Fig. 1C ) [18] . Yoon et al. showed that some unsymmetrical disulfide compounds were inhibitors of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Haemophilus influenzae, by interfering with acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS), a key enzyme in the biosynthesis pathway of branched chain amino-acids (Fig. 1D) [19, 20] . In the past of our research, we found that some unsymmetrical aromatic disulfides could inhibit plant AHAS and was useful for herbicide research (Fig. 1E) [21, 22] .",

It is a quite straightforward nucleophilic substitution, in which the thiol group in the mercapto compound serves as a nucleophilic reagent and attacks the sulfur atom in the arenesulfenyl chloride. Most yields for the reactions were satisfactory, showing that this is a simple and easy procedure to produce unsymmetrical aromatic disulfides, superior to the synthetic route developed by Hahn et al. [26] . In Hahn's paper, moist tetrahydrofuran gave better yields than dried benzene as the solvent for the reaction, so the authors added 5e10 M equivalent of water to the reaction mixture and observed satisfactory yields. Thus, the presence of water was thought to be preferable for the reaction by Hahn et al. [26] . In our synthesis experiment, only ethyl ether was used as the solvent and no additional water was added to the reaction, nevertheless, we observed very high yields for most of the target compounds.",

We then measured the enzymatic velocity of SARS-CoV M pro versus substrate concentrations in the presence of either 3-31 or 3-39 (Part 3 of the supplementary data). The lines displayed in reciprocal plots intersect at a same point, indicating that both inhibitors serve as a non-competitive inhibitor with a < 1 (Part 3 of the supplementary data) [27] . On this basis, the kinetic parameters (aK i \u00bc 0.20 mM, K i \u00bc 0.24 mM) of 3-31 were determined [28] (Fig. 3) , which clearly proved that, the noncompetitive inhibitor 3-31 is characterized by smaller equilibrium-binding constant compared to some known inhibitors such as N3 (K i \u00bc 9.0 mM) and N9 (K i \u00bc 6.7 mM) [3] .",

It is known that, if a disulfide reacts with another thiol to give a new disulfide, the thiols that are parts of the old disulfide can also react directly with this thiol to form the same new disulfide [29] . We tested the biological activities of different aryl thiols derived from our disulfides, and no inhibition of SARS-CoV M pro could be detected for any of them even at very high concentration. Accordingly it seemed unlikely that Cys145 formed a eS-Sbond by reacting with the target disulfide compounds. Another method to rule out this possibility is to determine the change of the molecular weight of the protein before and after inhibition [30, 31] . If the disulfide compound reacts with Cys145, the molecular weight would have a shift after SARS-CoV M pro is inhibited, and this is approximately the mass of half moiety of the unsymmetrical disulfide. Bearing this in mind, we measured the molecular weight of protease before and after inhibition by three disulfide compounds with significant structure difference (3-8, 3-31 and 3-39, data shown in part 4 of the supplementary data). However, no such assumed shift in the molecular weight was observed to support this idea.",

Therefore, in silico molecular docking technique was utilized to predict possible binding modes of the disulfide compounds with SARS-CoV M pro . In our previous study, we had docked a small library of isatin compounds to the active site of AHAS and probable binding modes were predicted by FlexX [32e37]. Here similar strategy was adopted to carry out database docking. After investigation of the resulting docked conformations, nineteen compounds were found to overlay one another quite well (Part 5 of the supplementary data), while all the other twenty-one compounds were in unreasonable binding space, and they failed to overlay well with one another. Thus, the docked conformations of the nineteen compounds were thought to be the possible binding conformations in this study. Compound 3-31 was chosen to depict the binding mode of the disulfide inhibitors. Fig. 4 is a two-dimensional illustration of the interactions between the inhibitor and the surrounding residues of SARS-CoV M pro drawn by LIGPLOT [38] . The location of 3-31 has some overlap with the inhibitor N9, the inhibitor in the original pdb file. The compound binds with SARS-CoV M pro via multiple hydrogen bonding contacts and hydrophobic contacts. Phe140, Leu141, His163, Met165, Glu166 and His172 form hydrophobic interactions with the small molecule, while Asn142, Gly143 and Cys145 form intermolecular H-bond with the inhibitor. The predicted binding mode therefore provides a useful clue to understand the possible molecular basis of these inhibitors.",

In the present study, in an effort to develop non-peptidic anti-SARS inhibitors, we have identified for the first time, that some unsymmetrical aromatic disulfides are excellent inhibitors of SARS CoV M pro , the mechanism of which seems distinct as they are reversible and mpetitive inhibitors.
