            "text": "Since the first establishment of hESC in 1998 (Thomson et al., 1998) , hESCs have been cultured in conditions using mouse derived fibroblasts, such as mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and STO as feeder cells. However, concerns remain regarding the potential risks of cell line contamination by unknown components secreted from these animal derived materials, therefore, studies have been performed to overcome these challenges (Soong et al., 2013) . For example, studies have examined the replacement of mouse derived fibroblasts with human tissue-derived feeder cells, such as human foreskin fibroblasts, fetal muscle fibroblasts (Richards et al., 2002) , umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells (Ding et al., 2012) , marrow stromal cells (Havasi et al., 2013) , and placental cells (Park et al., 2011) . Additionally, researchers have also attempted the development of extracellular matrix and xeno-free medium, which can be used in feeder-free conditions for cultures without feeder cells . There have also been continuous efforts to maintain hESCs efficiently and stably and establish new cell lines in the developed culture conditions. Human amniotic fluid cells (hAFCs) have been used for prenatal genetic diagnosis to examine the possibility of fetal abnormalities, these cells can be easily obtained from pregnant women through second midtrimester amniocentesis (Prusa & Hengstschlager, 2002) . Although few studies have characterized the various types of cells found in amniotic fluids, cells in amniotic fluids have been shown to be capable of differentiating into three germ layer cells. Thus, these cells have the potential for applications as materials for studies of neuronal differentiation or as stem cells (Prusa & Hengstschlager, 2002; Kook et al., 2006) . Amniotic fluid derived stem cells have intermediate characteristics between hESCs and adult stem cells and express markers such as CD29, CD90, and CD105, which are expressed in bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells. These cells also express markers of the undifferentiated state of hES cells, including Oct-4, Nanog, SSEA-4, and TRA1-81 (Bajek et al., 2014) . In particular, Oct-4, a representative marker for undifferentiated hESCs, has been shown to be expressed in 90% of amniotic fluidderived stem cells (Prusa et al., 2003) . Moreover, hAFCs have been shown to have higher reprogramming efficiency for establishment of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) than somatic cells (Galende et al., 2010) . In addition, in studies using hAFCs as feeder cells, Kim et al. (2004) successfully cultured hESCs using hAFCs as feeder cells instead of mouse derived fibroblasts, which are more commonly used. Other reports have also described the maintenance of the undifferentiated state of hESCs using human amniotic fluid cell-derived stem cells as feeder cells without the addition of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (Ma et al., 2014) , and new hESC lines have been established using amniotic fluid-derived mesenchymal stem cells as feeder cells (Soong et al., 2013 ).",

Several factors should be tested for in human derived materials or cells to be used as biological medicines (Cobo et al., 2005) Recently, studies in hPSCs, including hESCs, have focused on the next stage in clinical application, necessitating compatibility of cell therapy products with clinical application, the final goal of stem cell studies. Therefore, in addition to these changes, efficient culture conditions must be established for growth of hESCs by reducing animal derived components and replacing them with humanized or human derived materials in the basic cell culture environment. Studies should also be conducted with xeno-free and feeder-free environments that culture without feeder cells. In addition to improvement of culture conditions, quality management of cultured hESCs and standard procedures, including detection of microorganisms, viruses, and animal derived materials, for identification of inappropriate harmful substances need to be developed and standardized for production of clinical grade hESCs. This is the next preparatory step for the application of hESCs as cell based therapy in regenerative medicine.",

While these culture conditions are efficient for maintaining the undifferentiated state of hESCs, they are not suitable for use in clinical applications owing to risks of infection by various viruses and pathogens from the feeder cells and media used and the risks of contamination with other unknown components (Hovattta, 2006; Mallon et al., 2006). Therefore, researchers have attempted to reduce the use of animal derived materials and have focused on the development of new xeno-free culture conditions to completely exclude these materials. For example, human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) have been successfully cultured using human derived feeder cells",

In addition, it is essential to check for infections based on newly discovered, high risk infectious diseases, including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a nonviral infectious disease, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).For studies on clinical grade hESCs, the Reubinoff team reported the establishment of a clinical grade hESC line in xeno-free, GMP grade human derived feeder cells in 2012. This research team established and cultured clinical grade hESCs in xeno-free culture conditions using human derived feeder cells, including umbilical cord, foreskin, and fetal muscle cells that were cultured in a GMP grade clean room. They also verified the safety of all materials used in culture through quality management at each experimental step. In addition, they monitored steps required for verification of hESCs to be used as cell therapy products in the future, including tissues used as feeder cells, screening of embryo donors, establishment of hESCs, culture, freezing, characterization, and stem cell banking, and they established guidelines for ethical and systemic limitations and regulation of experimental methods in detail for clinical applications, providing a solid foundation for clinical grade studies(Tannenbaum et al., 2012). Based on these stem cell investigations, internationally standardized guidelines and regulations have been developed for individuals countries, including safety tests for quality assurance of basic cell cultures of hESCs and cell lines, and for institutional conditions according to various guidelines at the clinical stages required for hESCs to be approved as medical products.",
