Viruses most frequently identified were rhinoviruses, 6 respiratory syncytial virus 7 and human coronavirus. 8 The most often studied respiratory viruses have been rhinoviruses, which are also the most important common cold viruses. The detection rates vary widely between 0 and 40% for rhinoviruses. 6, 8, 9 The positive viral findings in MEE suggest a possible role of respiratory viruses in the pathogenesis of OME. However, the presence of (rhino)viral RNA may also represent non-causative remnants of an earlier respiratory infection. A substantial proportion of respiratory infections have also been shown to be caused by enteroviruses as well as the newly discovered human bocaviruses. 10, 11 Although enteroviruses replicate most prolifically in the gastrointestinal tract, there is increasing evidence to suggest that enteroviruses are also important in causing common cold. 12 Enteroviruses have not, however, been included in studies with MEE from OME children. The putative role of the newly discovered parvovirus, the human bocavirus, in OME is not yet established. In order to understand the pathogenesis of OME and its possible viral associations, more information is needed.",

Rhinovirus RNA can remain detectable by PCR up to 8 weeks in MEE 8 and if the child had a rhinovirus infection during the weeks preceding surgery, the possibility of coincidental positive rhinovirus findings cannot be excluded. It is, however, a limitation of our study that we do not have information on respiratory symptoms of the children for the pre-surgical period as long as 8 weeks. In fact, it would have been difficult to find otitisprone children without respiratory infection during the season of contagious infections from early fall until late spring.",

In earlier papers, however, rhino-and enteroviruses may not have been differentiated, but rather grouped together in case the primers were derived from the highly conserved 5 non-coding region. In contrast, in our study, after this first step, virus group specific probes were used to differentiate HRVs from HEVs. Unfortunately, the method we used is not without shortcomings 15 as some rhinovirus prototypes (namely HRV 45, 51, 65, 71 and 87) were detectable only with the enterovirus probe and not with the rhinovirus probe, which leads to misidentification of these HRV prototypes and therefore to a shift forward to a higher prevalence of HEV infections. Nevertheless, our method is not validated for detecting species C rhinoviruses, the importance of which in the development of otitis media has recently been discovered. 19 It is likely that the identification of missed positives with a proper method should raise the prevalence of HRV infections even further. It is of note, however, that when enteroviruses were studied separately enterovirus RNA was detected in only one of 37 MEE samples in children with OME. 6 In contrast, we have found the prevalence of enterovirus in MEE samples as high as 29.3%. Whether this reflects ongoing asymptomatic enterovirus infections is not known. Alternatively, positive results might be based on the remnants of previous infections. Mere detection of viruses in the MEE does not, therefore, necessarily indicate a causal relationship between virus infection and the concurrent disease.",
