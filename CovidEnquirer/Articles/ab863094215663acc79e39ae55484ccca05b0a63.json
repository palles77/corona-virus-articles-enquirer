            "text": "Pathogens and eucaryotic cells are active partners during the process of pathogenicity. To gain access to enterocytes and to cross the epithelial membrane, many enterovirulent microorganisms interact with the brush border membrane-associated components as receptors. Recent reports provide evidence that intestinal cell differentiation plays a role in microbial pathogenesis. Human enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) develop their pathogenicity upon infecting enterocytes. To determine if intestinal epithelial cell differentiation influences EPEC pathogenicity, we examined the infection of human intestinal epithelial cells by JPN 15 (pMAR7) [EAF+ eae+] EPEC strain as a function of the cell differentiation. The human embryonic intestinal INT407 cells, the human colonic T,, cells, the human undifferentiated HT-29 cells (HT-29 Std) and two enterocytic cell lines, HT-29 glc-/+ and Caco-2 cells, were used as cellular models. Cells were infected apically with the EPEC strain and the cell-association and cellentry were examined by quantitative determination using metabolically radiolabeled bacteria, as well as by light, scanning and tranmission electron microscopy. [EAF+ eae+] EPEC bacteria efficiently colonized the cultured human intestinal cells. Diffuse bacterial adhesion occurred to undifferentiated HT-29 Std and INT407 cells, whereas characteristic EPEC cell clusters were observed on fully differentiated enterocytic HT-29 glc-/+ cells and on colonic crypt T,, cells. As shown using the Caco-2 cell line, which spontaneously differentiates in culture, the formation of EPEC clusters increased as a function of the epithelial cell differentiation. In contrast, efficient cell-entry of [EAF+ eae+] EPEC bacteria occured in recently differentiated Caco-2 cells and decreased when the cells were fully differentiated. Our results provide evidence that the intestinal cell differentiation could play a dual role in EPEC pathogenesis: it up-regulates intestinal cell colonization and down-regulates intestinal cell invasion.",

Enterovirulent microorganisms colonize the intestinal mucosa via bacterial surface-associated products encoded by the virulence genes. After attachment to specific brush border receptors, enterotoxigenic pathogens produce cytotonic toxins, which bind to their brush border receptors and increase intracellular CAMP and cGMP through stimulation of 'adenylyl cyclase systems. For other enterovirulent bacteria, cell-attachment produces brush border lesions, rearrangements of cytoskeletal proteins, induction of protein phosphorylation, and increases in intracellular calcium concentration and permeability of the tight junctions. Enteroinvasive microorganisms enter the cell, multiply, and cause cell death and exfoliation. As a consequence, rapid migration of crypt cells along the crypt-villus axis occurs and the mucosal surface is reduced and is characterized by a high number of immature intestinal cells, which have a minimal capacity for NaC1-coupled transport, a state of base-line secretion of anions and poor digestive-absorptive functions for nutrients.",

            "text": "To approach in vitro the situation that would mimic in vivo intestinal infection, studies of development of intestinal bacterial pathogenic processes require appropriate cellular models. Indeed, the intestine presents a particular situation due to the rapid epithelial cell renewal, with proliferating crypt cells being undifferentiated and with the differentiation occuring during the crypt-to-villus migration of nondividing cells. The establishment of colon carcinoma cell lines [20] exhibiting characteristics of mature enterocytes or muco-secreting cells has provided an invaluable tool for study of intestinal cell functions, since there are similarities between adenocarcinoma cell lines in culture and small intestinal cells (for reviews see [37, 611) . Recent reports suggest that the enterocytic cell differentiation plays an important role in the development of bacterial pathogenicity. Indeed, for enterotoxigenic bacteria intestinal cell differentiation up-regulates cell colonization [5, 14, 28, 29, 451 . In contrast, it downregulates the cell-entry of enteroinvasive bacteria [3] . It is of interest to study the influence of enterocytic cell differentiation on the pathogenicity of enterovirulent bacteria, which develop their pathogenicity by two separate and successive processes such as cell-association followed by cell-entry.",

Occasionally, EPEC are involved in diarrhea in nurseries and day-care centers in developed countries. Studies of pathogenicity of EPEC have been conducted using non-intestinal and intestinal epithelial cells in vitro (for review see [lo] ). EPEC promotes a three-stage process of infection. The first stage involves adherence of bacteria to enterocytes in a pattern termed \"localized adherence\" (LA) involving EPEC adherence factor (EAF). The second stage features signal transduction leading to protein phosphorylation, elevation of intracellular calcium concentrations, and effacement of microvilli. The third stage is characterized by close attachment to the epithelial membrane by intimin, a 94-kDa outer membrane protein encoded by the E. coli attaching and effacing (ege A) locus.

This growth adaptation is followed by the emergence of differentiated populations of either absorptive or mucus-secreting cells.

            "text": "Work presented in this communication analyses the cellassociation and the cell-entry of [EAE+ eae+] EPEC bacteria in human cultured enterocyte-like cell lines as a function of cell differentiation. With the [EAE+ eae+] JPN 15 (pMAR7) EPEC strain we observed that the localized circumscribed clusters characteristic of EPEC adherence [32, 43, 541 occured only in differentiated enterocyte-like HT-29 glc-/+. Moreover, we observed that the cluster-localized binding of EPEC bacteria to Caco-2 cells, which spontaneously differentiate in culture [5] , developed in parallel with cell differentiation, disclosed by immunofluorescence labeling of sucrase-isomaltase, a differentiation-associated brush border hydrolase [55] . It has been widely documented that the adherence of EPEC to eucaryotic nonintestinal epithelial cells is dependent on an adhesive factor encoded by the EAF plasmid (for a review see [lo] ), and the formation of clusterlocalized EPEC microcolonies is due to the bundle forming pili (BFP) encoded by the 60-MDa epec adherence factor (EA) plasmid [9, 24, 251 . Induction of BFP synthesis was recently examined [59] . As observed with HEp-2 cells, EPEC localized adhesion: (i) develops after a latent period and (ii) localized adhesion is induced by the bacterial growth conditions associated with changes in the outer membrane proteins of the bacteria. In contrast, our results suggest that a bacterial response, i.e., the synthesis of BFP, may be triggered by specific contact-dependent signals, which are themselves induced by the expression of an unknown epithelial differentiationassociated receptor. It is well established that during differentiation expression of functional apical or baso-later-a1 membrane-associated components takes place. For example, expression of microvillar proteins [34, 411, membrane-anchored hydrolases such as sucrase-isomaltase [50, 511 and dipeptidyl peptidase IV [6] , apical membrane transporters [37] , and basolateral receptors [33, 46, 471 is up-regulated as a function of enterocytic differentiation. Our group and others have recently demonstrated that brush border receptors for the adhesive factors of enterotoxigenic E. coli [5, 28, 291, Clostridiurn dificile [14] or for E. coli enterotoxin [4, 401 are expressed at the apical side of intestinal cells during cell differentiation. In contrast, we have recently observed that the cell-entry of Yersinia is down-regulated by intestinal cell differentiation [3] . Finally, it has been noticed that viruses interact both with brush border and baso-lat-era1 components to enter the intestinal cells [16-18, 57, 58, 601. Beneath the localized microcolonies the close association of EPEC bacteria with the apical intestinal cell A membrane is accompanied by characteristic ultrastructural brush border lesions referred to as \"attaching-effacing\" (AE) lesions [31, 32, 431 . The eaeA locus, originally designated aea [S, 26, 271, and the eaeB gene, located downstream of eaeA, are necessary for intimate attachment [ l l , 121. It was previously reported that a subset of EPEC bacteria enters within the epithelial cells after developing the close association with the cell membrane, followed by the attaching-effacing lesions (for review see [lo] ). The cell-entry of [EAF+ eae+] JPN 15 (pMAR7) EPEC within the enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells appears to occur at a very low level that as compared with Yersinia pseudotuberculosis [3] . We observed that the EPEC cell-entry during the differentiation of Caco-2 cells was very different from the EPEC cell-association. Efficient EPEC cell-entry occured at the beginning of differentiation and then decreased. In contrast, for the JPN 15.96 strain the loss of the EPEC large plasmid, which encodes a positive regulatory factor that increases eaeA expression [26] , results in the abolishment of cell- entry. It is clear that the brush border cytoskeletal structure and composition particularly, the assembly of the brush border cytoskeleton from its consistent proteins, evolve during differentiation; [37] . This progressive process occurs in vivo when cells become terminally differentiated along the crypt-villus axis. In vitro throughout differentiation and immediately after confluency, the organization of the apical surface of the cultured intestinal cells undergoes a series of changes [48, 491. It is possible that at the stage where irregular microvilli are present cell-entry of EPEC bacteria occurs more easily or more rapidly than when the microvilli are fully organized.",

EPEC causes brush-border lesions [3 1, 32, 431 and decreases the transepithelial electrical resistance accross polarized monolayers of epithelial cells [ 11. Moreover, EPEC triggers profound changes in enterocytic cells: rearrangments of the host cell cytoskeleton [31, 531, release of inositol phosphate [13, 211 and activation of host cell tyrosine kinases [39] . In parallel with this pathogenic effect on mature enterocytes, it is possible that EPEC, by mobilizing the cytoskeletal components, affect the assembly and the spatial organization of the brush-border during intestinal cell differentiation. Indeed, we observed that EPEC invades human cultured intestinal cells when the differentiation commences. Most of the cell cytoskeletal components affected during EPEC attaching-effacing lesions and EPEC cell-entry are involved in the establishment and the maintenance of the epithelial cell polarity [19, 371. In consequence it may alter the functionality of several brush border components which play a fundamental role in the vectorial movement of ions, water, and macro-",
