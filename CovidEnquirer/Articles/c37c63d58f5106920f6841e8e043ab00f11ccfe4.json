The lack of formal internal medicine training is to some extent compensated for by the fact that, in Sweden, ID departments normally care for patients with respiratory tract infections, hepatitis, pyelonephritis or surgical infections. \u2022 Similar to the situation in the USA, some countries, e.g., Finland, have chosen to make ID a subspecialty of either internal medicine or paediatrics. It is notable that in many countries infections are included in general paediatrics and are not considered to require special training. \u2022 In the UK, a new curriculum for training of specialists in 'infection' has recently been introduced. Under this programme, the physicians receive approximately 3 years of training in each of the specialties: internal medicine, clinical IDs and clinical microbiology. Although the training period is longer than normal, it provides an optimal basis for an ID specialist. The ID specialty is today recognised in most European countries, notable exceptions being Austria, Belgium and Spain. In most countries the ID physicians serve as consultants and have relatively few, if any, beds of their own. However, in some countries, e.g., Sweden, there are relatively high numbers of beds in ID departments. Advantages of the latter system are that the capacity for effective isolation of contagious patients is increased and that the staff members have special training in preventing the spread of infections.",

Since then the world has seen the emergence of several important infections. Examples are acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In addition, the rapid development of new microbiological techniques has made it possible to identify the aetiology of many important infections, such as those caused by Legionella pneumophila, Helicobacter pylori, several new viruses causing infectious hepatitis, and viruses causing haemorrhagic fevers. In many cases these discoveries have led to the development of effective treatments.",

The earlier this is done, the easier it will be to contain an outbreak. An excellent example is the SARS epidemic. The first wave of some 300 patients with severe respiratory tract infections in the Guangdong province was noted as an accumulation of cases of atypical pneumonia. It was dismissed by local authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO) as not being a new influenza outbreak and not having any connections with avian influenza. However, only days after the worldwide dissemination from the index case at Hotel Metropole in Hong Kong, it became obvious, through observation by physicians in Hong Kong and Hanoi, that this was a completely new ID outbreak, which required extraordinary actions. Rapid recognition of the SARS outbreak also made it possible to contain the infection despite the fact that it had spread worldwide at an early stage.",

Optimal handling of outbreaks requires building of networks within healthcare and public health agencies. Key actors at the local level, in addition to the ID specialists, are the clinical microbiologists, hospital hygiene specialists, epidemiologists and public health organisations. When an epidemic results in large numbers of patients requiring hospital care, the local hospital authorities will have an important role to play. On the national level, most countries have infection control agencies, which, as early as possible, should be informed about suspected outbreaks. Internationally, the European Union network for surveillance of IDs should be contacted, as should the WHO. These contacts should be made through the national infection control agency. On a European level, it is likely that in the future the coordinating role within Europe will be taken over by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control.",

Today, such resistance is creating problems with handling a broad range of infections. In most countries, antibiotic resistance is very common in staphylococci, enterococci, pneumococci, enterobacters and non-fermenting Gram-negative species such as Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, resistance to one of the main agents (rifampicin and isoniazid) is common and the frequency of multiresistant strains is increasing. Resistance is also creating clinical problems in viral infections. This is most pronounced for anti-retroviral drugs, and primary resistance, i.e., resistance to one or more anti-HIV drugs at the time of acquisition of the infection, is not uncommon. In parasitology, resistance to anti-malarial drugs is an increasing problem, which has led to a recommendation to use combination therapy for prophylaxis and treatment, something that is often not affordable in developing countries.",

By education of colleagues and the general public, improper use of antibiotics should be avoided or reduced. It seems clear that in most countries there is a marked overuse of antibiotics [2] . Proper sampling from patients with infections should facilitate identification of resistant organisms. When infections caused by resistant organisms occur in a hospital setting, the ID specialists, together with the hospital hygiene specialists, should initiate necessary measures to avoid dissemination. In this respect, it is important to remember that more and more elderly people with serious conditions are cared for outside of hospitals, in nursing homes or even in their own homes. It is not unusual for these patients to harbour resistant bacteria as a result of more or less indiscriminate use of antibiotics. Again, the best way to reduce the consequences of such resistance is to increase the sampling for microbiological investigations, so that, when such a patient is hospitalised, adequate isolation and hygienic measures can be taken.",
