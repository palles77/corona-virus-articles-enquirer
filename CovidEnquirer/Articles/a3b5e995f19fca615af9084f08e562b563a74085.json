            "text": "This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors Isolation is an established part of any infection prevention programme. Its purpose is to prevent the transmission of antibiotic-resistant pathogens, those that are highly contagious or cause serious infection. [1] The effectiveness of isolation has been questioned however [2] [3] [4] [5] and it can be challenging to undertake, especially if patients' lack of understanding of the need for segregation, boredom or distress result in uncooperative behaviour. [6] Although single rooms are assumed to reduce infection risk, evidence of ability to contain spread is equivocal [7, 8] and a recent study conducted in an all-single-room hospital was unable to demonstrate lower infection rates than in hospitals where most care takes place in open wards. [9] This study identified advantages and disadvantages of single room accommodation, whereas isolating infectious patients is generally assumed to result in adverse outcomes. [10] A systematic review reported eight years ago indicated higher levels of anxiety, depression, perceptions of stigmatisation and a higher incidence of falls, medication errors and other incidents that detract from patient safety among patients who were isolated compared to those who were not. [11] This review reported studies undertaken before 2010 and included patients whose experiences are unlikely to be comparable: children and adults and those isolated to reduce their own risk of infection as well as infectious patients. The review was not reported according to standards currently expected for systematic reviews [12] and presents a qualitative description of patient outcomes only. A more rigorous and up-to-date systematic review is indicated in view of increasing concern about satisfaction with health care and patient safety and increasing emphasis on infection prevention as part of the global strategy to reduce risks of antimicrobial resistance. [13] We undertook a systematic review of the literature to establish the effects of infection related isolation on psychological and non-psychological care-related outcomes in adults. This review is therefore more focussed than that previously undertaken which also included those in protective isolation, and contains a significant body of literature published since 2010.",

A number of studies provided data on those under contact precautions, but no comparative data and so were not included.

There were significant declines in mean scores related to control and self-esteem, and in many studies increases in the mean scores for risk of anxiety and depression. However, these findings were not consistent, and some larger studies showed little or no difference between the groups for these outcomes. These are shown in Figures 1 and 2 Studies not reporting the raw data showed that contact precautions were associated with depression OR 1.4 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.5) but not anxiety OR 0.8 (95% CI 0.7 to 1.1) in a non-ICU population. [40] There was also an association with delirium OR, 1.40 (95% CI 1.24 to 1.51); although this was primarily among those who were newly diagnosed as needing isolation OR, 1.75 (95% CI 1.60 to 1.92, p<0.01) rather than those who had been under contact precautions for their entire stay OR 0.97 (95% CI 0.86 to 1.09, p=0.60). [16] Another study showed no difference in the median values for the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale anxiety or depression scores (HADS-A and -D), or the EuroQol Visual Analogue Scale EQ VAS scores. [41] For non-psychological outcomes, using a difference in the risk of +/-20% of an event as being a measure of clinical significance it appears there was a trend for less attention to be given to, and for more errors to occur in those who were isolated.",

[1] This review has shown that there are a number of apparently negative aspects to contact Although at times there are discussions as to the necessity of contact precautions for drug resistant organisms, with some arguing that that there is mixed evidence for or against their use [46] another recent review has concluded that they are of great importance in the control of epidemic and endemic multidrug-resistant microorganisms. [47] The ethics of using contact precautions and other forms of isolation rely on a positive assessment of the balance between the risks and benefits of this to the individual concerned and that of the broader population of patients and staff. [48] However, even when this assessment is positive, it is important to ensure that any harm to the individual is minimised.",

In addition to the certainty of evidence and resource requirements, it also requires consideration of: the balance of desirable and undesirable effects; the impact upon equity; and the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. [49] The last two of these might have very different outcomes when considered at the population and individual levels; and there is certainly evidence here that for the individual patient the balance of desirable and undesirable effects might be very different to that of the broader population. However, within the broad population of infected or potentially infected patients, some groups might have different needs. For example a study of people isolated for MERS found that while access to telephones reduced anxiety and anger; access to email, text and internet increased these. [50] This was not an area investigated in any depth in these studies. Another area where information may be lacking is that of age, as older people in particular might feel sadness and loneliness more; and gender, as women were more concerned about precautions and transmission while men were more resigned, rational and tended to cope better. [51] In some countries, such as the United States single-rooms have become the standard for new hospitals and so one might expect fewer adverse effects if everyone is in a single room, this being the norm. However it may be that a single room is necessary but not sufficient for these findings, and that it is the combination of a single room with an infection that leads to these results. Certainly it is far from clear that the long list of advantages claimed for single rooms which include reduced stress, the ability to deliver better care, and a lower probability of dietary or medication errors apply to this group of patients. [52] Caring for patients in single-rooms does have many challenges, but there is evidence that these can be mitigated in a general population; [9] however the expanding literature on how this can be done in a general population does not necessarily apply here due to the necessity of isolation procedures which are, by design, 'a barrier'. Therefore patients' needs for greater social interaction will need a solution quite benefit of choice about this which single rooms offer does not apply here. [53] Although this review has quantified the extent of the problem, we have not been able to find solutions in the literature. Care might be improved through increased staff attention with more resources being allocated to these patients, although the extra cost of contact precautions is already considerable, one estimate being that it was an extra $158.90 (95% CI $124.90 to $192.80) per patient day. [54] Alternatively new ways of working might be developed, perhaps using technology to mitigate some of these problems. What these might be is not clear however.",

[6] Although single rooms are assumed to reduce infection risk, evidence of ability to contain spread is equivocal [7, 8] and a recent study conducted in an all-single-room hospital was unable to demonstrate lower infection rates than in hospitals where most care takes place in open wards. [9] This study identified advantages and disadvantages of single room accommodation, whereas isolating infectious patients is generally assumed to result in adverse outcomes. [10] A systematic review reported eight years ago indicated higher levels of anxiety, depression, perceptions of stigmatisation and a higher incidence of falls, medication errors and other incidents that detract from patient safety among patients who were isolated compared to those who were not. [11] This review reported studies undertaken 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   5   before 2010 and included patients whose experiences are unlikely to be comparable:   children and adults and those isolated to reduce their own risk of infection as well as infectious patients. The review was not reported according to standards currently expected for systematic reviews [12] and presents a qualitative description of patient outcomes only. A more rigorously reported and up-to-date systematic review is indicated in view of increasing concern about satisfaction with health care and patient safety and increasing emphasis on infection prevention as part of the global strategy to reduce risks of antimicrobial resistance. [13] We undertook a systematic review of the literature to establish the effects of infection related isolation on psychological and non-psychological care-related outcomes in adults. This review is therefore more focussed than that previously undertaken which also included those in protective isolation, and contains a significant body of literature published since 2010.",

Of these 13 studies provided data suitable for the calculation of risk ratio, 5 giving psychological outcomes, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] and 12 non-psychological; [19, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] and 8 provided data for the calculation of standardised mean differences, 6 giving psychological outcomes, [21, 30, [33] [34] [35] [36] and 2 non-psychological. [29, 37] A further 6 studies did not provide raw data but are included in the results; 3 each giving psychological outcomes [38] [39] [40] and nonpsychological outcomes. [17, 41, 42] Meta-analyses were possible on two outcomes: anxiety and depression from 8 studies using standardised mean difference. [19] [20] [21] 30, [33] [34] [35] [36] Where only risk ratio data were given [20, 21] conversion to standardised mean difference was undertaken using the Campbell Collaboration calculator (https://campbellcollaboration.org/research-resources/effect-sizecalculator.html). [43] Where it was not possible to pool outcome data because of methodological and clinical heterogeneity, the data from studies are shown as forest plots but without meta-analysis. The forest plots contain results from the studies where sufficient data were given to calculate either the risk ratio or standardised mean difference. A number of studies provided data on those under contact precautions, but no comparative data and so were not included. [44] [45] [46] [47] Because of the large number of non-psychological outcomes for which RR could be calculated, it was decided that a change of 20% (i.e. a RR of 0.8 or less, or 1.2 or more) would be clinically significant, regardless of the statistical significance. This appear to be significant cause for concern regarding bias within the limitations inherent in these study designs. Most studies used established or validated tools [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [23] [24] [25] 27, 29, 30, [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] or clinical outcomes. [22, 26, 28, 31, 32] The data from the comparative studies suggest that although in many cases infective isolation precautions make little difference to psychological outcomes, where it does make a difference this is primarily negative. There were significant declines in mean scores related to control and self-esteem, and in many studies increases in the mean scores for risk of anxiety and depression. However, these findings were not consistent, and some larger studies showed little or no difference between the groups for these outcomes. These are shown in Figures 1 and 2 respectively. Studies not reporting the raw data showed that contact precautions were associated with depression OR 1.4 (95% CI 1.2 to 1.5) but not anxiety OR 0.8 (95% CI 0.7 to 1.1) in a non-ICU population. [41] There was also an association with delirium OR For non-psychological outcomes, using a difference in the risk of +/-20% of an event as being a measure of clinical significance it appears there was a trend for less attention to be given to, and for more errors to occur in those who were isolated.",

[50] The ethics of using contact precautions and other forms of isolation rely on a positive assessment of the balance between the risks and benefits of this to the individual concerned and that of the broader population of patients and staff.

In addition to the certainty of evidence and resource requirements, it also requires consideration of: the balance of desirable and undesirable effects; the impact upon equity; and the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. [52] The last two of these might have very different outcomes when considered at the population and individual levels; and there is certainly evidence here that for the individual patient the balance of desirable and undesirable effects might be very different to that of the broader population. email, text and internet increased these. [53] This was not an area investigated in any depth in these studies. Another area where information may be lacking is that of age, as older people in particular might feel sadness and loneliness more; and gender, as qualitative data suggest that women in isolation were more concerned about precautions and transmission while men were more resigned, rational and tended to cope better. [54] In some countries, such as the United States single-rooms have become the standard for new hospitals and so one might expect fewer adverse effects if everyone is in a single room, this being the norm. However it may be that a single room is necessary but not sufficient for these findings, and that it is the combination of a single room with an infection that leads to these results. Certainly it is far from clear that the long list of advantages claimed for single rooms which include reduced stress, the ability to deliver better care, and a lower probability of dietary or medication errors apply to this group of patients. [55] Caring for patients in single-rooms does have many challenges, but there is evidence that these can be mitigated in a general population; [9] however the expanding literature on how this can be done in a general population does not necessarily apply here due to the necessity of isolation procedures which are, by design, 'a barrier'.",

A more rigorously reported and up-to-date systematic review is indicated in view of increasing concern about satisfaction with health care and patient safety and increasing emphasis on infection prevention as part of the global strategy to reduce risks of antimicrobial resistance. [13] We undertook a systematic review of the literature to establish the effects of infection related isolation on psychological and non-psychological care-related outcomes in adults. This review is therefore more focussed than that previously undertaken which also included those in protective isolation, and contains a significant body of literature published since 2010.",

This model assumes that the observed effect from each study is estimating a related but different true effect, allowing for between-study variation to be calculated in the form of heterogeneity statistics. All calculations and plots were produced using the meta and metafor packages in R. [14] [15] [16] Where raw data were not provided the summary results are given in the text but not the forest plots. All data relevant to the study are included in the article or uploaded as Supplementary File 3. Where it was not possible to pool outcome data because of methodological and clinical heterogeneity, the data from studies are shown as forest plots but without meta-analysis. The forest plots contain results from the studies where sufficient data were given to calculate either the risk ratio or standardised mean difference. A number of studies provided data on those under contact precautions, but no comparative data and so were not included. [44] [45] [46] [47] The data from the comparative studies suggest that although in many cases infective isolation precautions make little difference to psychological outcomes, where it does make a difference this is primarily negative. There were significant declines in mean scores related to control and self-esteem, and in many studies increases in the mean scores for risk of anxiety and depression. However, these findings were not consistent, and some larger studies showed little or no difference between the groups for these outcomes. These are shown in Figures 1 and 2 respectively. For non-psychological outcomes, using a difference in the risk of +/-20% of an event as being a measure of clinical significance it appears there was a trend for less attention to be given to, and for more errors to occur in those who were isolated.",

Data on these outcomes are given in Figures 5 and 6 , and the non-clinically significant risks in the email, text and internet increased these. [53] This was not an area investigated in any depth in these studies. Another area where information may be lacking is that of age, as older people in particular might feel sadness and loneliness more; and gender, as qualitative data suggest that women in isolation were more concerned about precautions and transmission while men were more resigned, rational and tended to cope better. [54] In some countries, such as the United States single-rooms have become the standard for new hospitals and so one might expect fewer adverse effects if everyone is in a single room, this being the norm. However it may be that a single room is necessary but not sufficient for these findings, and that it is the combination of a single room with an infection that leads to these results. Certainly it is far from clear that the long list of advantages claimed for single rooms which include reduced stress, the ability to deliver better care, and a lower probability of dietary or medication errors apply to this group of patients. [55] Caring for patients in single-rooms does have many challenges, but there is evidence that these can be mitigated in a general population; [9] however the expanding literature on how this can be done in a general population does not necessarily apply ",

[6] Although single rooms are assumed to reduce infection risk, evidence of ability to contain spread is equivocal [7, 8] and a recent study conducted in an all-single-room hospital was unable to demonstrate lower infection rates than in hospitals where most care takes place in open wards. [9] This study identified advantages and disadvantages of single room accommodation, whereas isolating infectious patients is generally assumed to result in adverse outcomes. [10] A systematic review reported eight years ago indicated higher levels of anxiety, depression, perceptions of stigmatisation and a higher incidence of falls, medication errors and other incidents that detract from patient safety among patients who were isolated compared to those who were not. [11] This review reported studies undertaken before 2010 and included patients whose experiences are unlikely to be comparable: children and adults and those isolated to reduce their own risk of infection as well as infectious patients. The review was not reported according to standards currently expected for systematic reviews [12] and presents a qualitative description of patient outcomes only. A more rigorously reported and up-to-date systematic review is indicated in view of increasing concern about satisfaction with health care and patient safety and increasing emphasis on infection prevention as part of the global strategy to reduce risks of antimicrobial resistance. [13] We undertook a systematic review of the literature to establish the effects of infection related isolation on psychological and non-psychological care-related outcomes in adults. This review is therefore more focussed than that previously undertaken which also included those in protective isolation, and contains a significant body of literature published since 2010.",

Purely symptomatic/disease progression outcomes were not included, neither were those looking at patients isolated due to immunosuppression. Studies not containing comparative data between those isolated and not isolated were also excluded. Due to the variety of different settings and methods it was deemed that the methodological and clinical heterogeneity was too broad to pool results; apart from those related to anxiety and depression, for which results were pooled using the random-effects model. This model assumes that the observed effect from each study is estimating a related but different true effect, allowing for between-study variation to be calculated in the form of heterogeneity statistics. All calculations and plots were produced using the meta and metafor packages in R. [14] [15] [16] Where raw data were not provided the summary results are given in the text but not the forest plots.

Of these 13 studies provided data suitable for the calculation of risk ratio, 5 giving psychological outcomes, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] and 12 non-psychological; [19, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] and 8 provided data for the calculation of standardised mean differences, 6 giving psychological outcomes, [21, 30, [33] [34] [35] [36] and 2 non-psychological. [29, 37] A further 6 studies did not provide raw data but are included in the results; 3 each giving psychological outcomes [38] [39] [40] and nonpsychological outcomes. [17, 41, 42] Meta-analyses were possible on two outcomes: anxiety and depression from 8 studies using standardised mean difference. [19] [20] [21] 30, [33] [34] [35] [36] Where only risk ratio data were given [20, 21] conversion to standardised mean difference was undertaken using the Campbell Collaboration calculator (https://campbellcollaboration.org/research-resources/effect-sizecalculator.html). [43] Where it was not possible to pool outcome data because of methodological and clinical heterogeneity, the data from studies are shown as forest plots but without meta-analysis. The forest plots contain results from the studies where sufficient data were given to calculate either the risk ratio or standardised mean difference. A number of studies provided data on those under contact precautions, but no comparative data and so were not included. [44] [45] [46] [47] The studies included were primarily single-centre and consisted of case-control, cross-sectional and cohort studies. Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottowa scale, full details of each study and its risk of bias are in the Supplementary File 5. [48] Overall, although these studies have limited generalisability, there did not appear to be significant cause for concern regarding bias within the limitations inherent in these study designs. Most studies used established or validated tools [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [23] [24] [25] 27, 29, 30, [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] or clinical outcomes. [22, 26, 28, 31, 32] The data from the comparative studies suggest that although in many cases infective isolation precautions make little difference to psychological outcomes, where it does make a difference this is primarily negative. There were significant declines in mean scores related to control and self-esteem, and in many studies increases in the mean scores for risk of anxiety and depression. However, these findings were not consistent, and some larger studies showed little or no difference between the groups for these outcomes. These are shown in Figures 1 and 2 respectively. For non-psychological outcomes, using a difference in the risk of +/-20% of an event as being a measure of clinical significance it appears there was a trend for less attention to be given to, and for more errors to occur in those who were isolated.",

In addition to the certainty of evidence and resource requirements, it also requires consideration of: the balance of desirable and undesirable effects; the impact upon equity; and the feasibility and acceptability of the email, text and internet increased these. [53] This was not an area investigated in any depth in these studies. Another area where information may be lacking is that of age, as older people in particular might feel sadness and loneliness more; and gender, as qualitative data suggest that women in isolation were more concerned about precautions and transmission while men were more resigned, rational and tended to cope better. [54] In some countries, such as the United States single-rooms have become the standard for new hospitals and so one might expect fewer adverse effects if everyone is in a single room, this being the norm. However it may be that a single room is necessary but not sufficient for these findings, and that it is the combination of a single room with an infection that leads to these results. Certainly it is far from clear that the long list of advantages claimed for single rooms which include reduced stress, the ability to deliver better care, and a lower probability of dietary or medication errors apply to this group of patients.

These data come from studies carried out in a variety of countries and different types of facilities; although there are few data from particularly vulnerable populations such as the elderly.Although at times there are discussions as to the necessity of contact precautions for drug resistant organisms, with some arguing that that there is mixed evidence for or against their use[49] another recent review has concluded that they are of great importance in the control of epidemic and endemic multidrug-resistant microorganisms.[50] The ethics of using contact precautions and other forms of isolation rely on a positive assessment of the balance between the risks and benefits of this to the individual concerned and that of the broader population of patients and staff.[51] However, even when this assessment is positive, it is important to ensure that any harm to the individual is minimised.One way of balancing the various priorities is to use the GRADE Evidence to Decision Framework, which provides criteria for making recommendations at the individual, group and policy-levels, and provides a number of highly patient focussed criteria for doing this. In addition to the certainty of evidence and resource requirements, it also requires consideration of: the balance of desirable and undesirable effects; the impact upon equity; and the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention.[52] The last two of these might have very different outcomes when considered at the population and individual levels; and there is certainly evidence here",

Technology might be particularly useful in reducing adverse events such as medication or clinical errors; although increasing satisfaction and some areas of quality are more likely to be achieved by increasing the availability of staff and other people. The extent to which scarce resources are allocated to this may be driven in part by the longevity of any negative effects; which current literature is not really able to clarify. To understand this longituduinal studies are needed.15 strengthen the evidence on this. In some cases large effect sizes were accompanied by very wide confidence intervals, suggesting that studies were underpowered, thus studies with larger sample sizes would be useful. It would also be useful if there were more consistent methods of examining and reporting these data, particularly outside of the realms of depression and anxiety where the variety of methods makes analysis of the body of evidence difficult. We were also unable to assess whether these effects varied according to reason for isolation; or to understand if they are likely to be longterm or simply temporary phenomena.Although these data suggest that there is a problem, there is a clear gap both in what we know about improving the experience of isolation and what can be done in practical terms to make it more tolerable for patients and their families.
