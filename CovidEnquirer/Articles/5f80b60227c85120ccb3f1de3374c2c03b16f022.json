            "text": "Type I interferons (IFN-a and -b) play an important role in the innate host defense against viral infection by inducing antiviral responses. In addition to direct antiviral activities, type I IFN serves as an important link between the innate and adaptive immune response through multiple mechanisms. Therefore, the outcome of a viral infection can be affected by IFN induction and the IFN sensitivity of a virus. North American porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) field isolates were studied with regard to IFN-a sensitivity and induction in order to understand the role of type I IFN in PRRSV pathogenesis. PRRSV isolates were differentially sensitive to porcine recombinant IFN-a (rIFN-a) and varied in their ability to induce IFN-a in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAM) cultures as measured by a porcine IFN-a specific ELISA on cell culture supernatants. Fifty-two plaques were purified from three PRRSV isolates (numbers 3, 7, and 12) and tested for IFN sensitivity and IFN induction. Plaque-derived populations were composed of heterogeneous populations in terms of IFN-inducing capacity and sensitivity to rIFN-a. When macrophages infected with isolates 3, 7, or 12 were treated with polycytidylic acid (polyI:C), IFN-a production was enhanced. Cells infected with isolate 3 and treated with polyI:C showed the most consistent and strongest enhancement of IFN-a production. It was demonstrated that the relatively low concentrations of IFN-a produced by isolate 3 contributed to the enhanced IFN-a synthesis in response to polyI:C. Isolates 7 and 12 significantly suppressed the enhanced IFN-a production by isolate 3 in polyI:C treated cells. To determine if suppression was at the level of IFN-a transcription, quantitative RT-PCR was performed for IFN-a mRNA and compared to GAPDH and cyclophilin mRNA quantification. However, the relative number of IFN-a transcript copies did not correlate with IFN-a protein levels, suggesting a post-transcriptional mechanism of suppression. In summary, these results demonstrate that PRRSV field isolates differ both in IFN-a sensitivity and induction. Furthermore, a PRRSV field isolate strongly enhance polyI:C-induced IFN-a production in PAM cultures and this priming effect was suppressed by other PRRSV isolates. #",

            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is one of the most economically important diseases of swine. This disease was first detected in the U.S. in 1987 (Keffaber, 1989) and in Europe in 1990 (Wensvoort et al., 1991) . The etiologic agent for this disease, PRRS virus (PRRSV) is an enveloped, positive-stranded RNA virus that is a member of the Arteriviridae family, order Nidovirales. The fulllength genomic sequence has been determined for PRRSV isolates of both European and North American lineage (Allende et al., 1999; Meulenberg et al., 1993; Nelsen et al., 1999; Shen et al., 2000; Wootton et al., 2000) . Molecular analysis of the prototype PRRSV VR-2332 and Lelystad strains (U.S. and European isolates, respectively) has suggested that divergently evolved strains emerged on two continents almost simultaneously, perhaps due to similar changes in swine management practices (Murtaugh et al., 1995; Nelsen et al., 1999) . Analysis of partial genomic sequence data for hundreds of PRRSV strains reveals extensive diversity but also well-conserved regions (Andreyev et al., 1997; Meng et al., 1995; reviewed by Meng, 2000) .",

            "text": "Disease caused by PRRSV is characterized by severe and sometimes fatal respiratory disease and reproductive failure. Infection with PRRSV also predisposes pigs to infection by bacterial pathogens as well as other viral pathogens (Benfield et al., 1992) and PRRSV is a key etiologic agent of the economically important porcine respiratory disease complex (PRDC). The most consistent pathological lesions caused by PRRSV during acute infection are interstitial pneumonia and mild lymphocytic encephalitis Plagemann, 1996; Rossow et al., 1995 Rossow et al., , 1996 . Tissue macrophages and monocytes are the major target cells during both acute and persistent infection (Molitor et al., 1997) , although pneumocytes and epithelial germ cells of the testes have also been shown to be infected (Sur et al., 1996 (Sur et al., , 1997 . It is important to note that clinical disease caused by PRRSV is highly variable, ranging from mild, subclinical infections to acute deaths of adult animals . The differences in virulence have been attributed to numerous factors including host genetics, management practices, and virus strain heterogeneity (Halbur et al., , 1996 (Halbur et al., , 1998 Keffaber, 1989; Wensvoort, 1993) . After the acute phase of PRRSV infection, which is typically characterized by viremia and clinical disease, many pigs fully recover yet carry a low-level viral infection for an extended period of time. Under experimental conditions, persistent infection with PRRSV has been well documented (Albina et al., 1994; Allende et al., 2000; Christopher-Hennings et al., 1995; Horter et al., 2002; Sur et al., 1996; Yoon et al., 1993; Wills et al., 2003) . These ''carrier'' pigs are persistently infected with PRRSV and shed the virus, either intermittently or continuously, and may infect na\u00efve pigs following direct or indirect contact. Most notably, infectious virus has been recovered for up to 157 days postinfection .",

A protective immune response is possible since it has been demonstrated that previous exposure can provide protection when pigs are challenged with a homologous strain of PRRSV (Lager et al., 1999) . However, protective immunity has never been consistently demonstrated for challenge with heterologous strains (Lager et al., 1999; Mengeling et al., 2003) .",

The type I IFN response serves as an important link between the innate and adaptive immune response through multiple mechanisms (reviewed by Biron, 1998) . Type I IFN: (i) promotes the development of CD8 + T cell response (reviewed by Boehm et al., 1997) , (ii) regulates the expression of many proteins responsible for generating antigenic peptides to be displayed in association with MHC class I (reviewed by York and Rock, 1996) , (iii) enhances differentiation of dendritic antigen-presenting cells (Luft et al., 1998) , (iv) stimulates the division of memory T cells by inducing IL-15 (Tough et al., 1999) , (v) contributes to prolonging the lifespan of activated T cells (Marrack et al., 1999) , and (vi) enhances IgG production and down-regulates IgE secretion in B cells (Finkelman et al., 1990 (Finkelman et al., , 1991 .",

Type I IFN has been shown to activate or induce the synthesis of several proteins including 2,5oligoadenylate synthase (OAS), double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR), Mx and ribonuclease L (RNase L) (Vilcek and Sen, 1996) , all of which result in induction of an antiviral state (reviewed by Samuel, 2001) . Not surprisingly, many viruses have evolved specific mechanisms to counteract the IFN response. For example, the hepatitis B virus ORF-C product and terminal protein (Whitten et al., 1991) , the human papillomavirus (HPV)16 E6 and E7 proteins (Park et al., 2000; Ronco et al., 1998) , and the influenza A virus NS1 protein (Talon et al., 2000) are viral proteins that have been shown to inhibit IFN synthesis. Some viral proteins, such as the adenoviral E1A (Zhang et al., 1996) , Sendai virus C proteins (Komatsu et al., 2000) and Simian Virus 5 protein V (Didcock et al., 1999) , block IFN signaling via the Jak-STAT pathways. Additionally, Herpes virus, SV40 and EMCV are known to block IFN-induction of the 2,5-OAS/RNase L system (Vilcek and Sen, 1996) .",

In the absence of PRRSV, polyI:C failed to induce IFN-a at 6 h, although IFN-a was induced at later time points.

In this study, North American PRRSV field isolates were evaluated with respect to induction, sensitivity and suppression of an in vitro IFN response in PAM cultures. Our results show that these isolates are sensitive to rIFN-a in a dosedependent manner, but are generally poor inducers of IFN in vitro. Notably the extent of the sensitivity and induction of IFN not only differed between PRRSV isolates, but also showed variation among the plaquederived populations within each isolate. Two of the field isolates studied were able to suppress the IFN-a production of cells dually-treated with polyI:C and a third North American PRRSV isolate. While considerable variation was noted for the levels of IFN-a measured between replicates, most likely due to the variability of alveolar macrophage function among pigs (du Manoir et al., 2002) , the trends observed were consistent between experiments. Taken together, these results demonstrate that North American PRRSV isolates differ in the ability to induce or suppress IFNa, which may contribute to both virulence differences commonly observed among PRRSV infections and the failure of PRRSV infection to consistently induce a rapid and robust sterilizing immune response.",

The data presented herein demonstrated that North American PRRSV field isolates were differentially sensitive to the in vitro antiviral effects of rIFN-a and the use of plaque-derived populations from these field isolates demonstrated that closely related variants of PRRSV may differ in their IFN responses. Similarly, it has been shown that the sensitivity of reovirus, hepatitis C virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) to type I IFN antiviral activity differs among viral strains (Enomoto et al., 1996; Moskophidis et al., 1994; reviewed by Samuel, 1998) . A previous study suggested that significant differences of IFN-inducing capabilities could be a quasispecies marker of Fig. 6 .

Polyclonal antibody against porcine IFN-a (50 neutralizing units/ml) was added into cell cultures at the time of infection. At 12 h p.i. cell culture media was replaced with media containing polyI:C (20 mg/ml). After additional 6 h incubation, cell culture media was collected and analyzed for IFN-a production by using porcine specific ELISA. One unit/ml of rIFN-a is equivalent to 26 pg/ml. *, Significant difference compared to polyI:C treated and isolate 3 infected cells (P < 0.05). vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) (Marcus et al., 1998) . In contrast to the results presented herein, a study using the European PRRSV strains SDRPI and SDRPII found no strain differences in IFN-a sensitivity or induction, despite differences in clinical virulence (Albina et al., 1998a) . Previous experimental work has demonstrated evidence of a relationship between IFN phenotypes and virulence for other viruses. For example, virulent measles virus induces lower levels of IFN than attenuated strains and IFNresistant strains can establish persistent infections of the central nervous system (Carrigan and Knox, 1990 ). It has also been shown that the capability of noncytopathic bovine viral diarrhea virus to establish persistent infections in the early fetus is related to its ability to suppress type I IFN synthesis (Charleston et al., 2001) . Future in vivo studies will be needed to determine if the IFN phenotypes described in the present study are related to PRRSV virulence or persistence.",

            "text": "In the present study it was shown that polyI:C treatment of PRRSV-infected cells resulted in greatly enhanced IFN-a production, especially in PAM cultures infected with PRRSV isolate 3. Similar phenomenons have been reported by other studies. IFN-inducing Listeria monocytogenes (Havell, 1986) and type I IFN pretreatment (Rosztoczy and Megyeri, 1989) enhanced IFN production by polyI:C, Sendai virus, or endotoxin. A plausible mechanism of this enhancement is by positive feedback regulation of type I IFN synthesis, in which a weak IFN-a/b signaling contributes to the enhancement of IFN-a/b synthesis due to the accumulation of transcription factor IRF-7 (reviewed by Taniguchi and Takaoka, 2001) . This positive feedback loop of IFN synthesis could be efficiently induced by a small amount of IFNa produced during the first 12 h after isolate 3 infection, resulting in amplification of the IFN-a response to polyI:C. Consistent with this possibility was the observation that neutralizing antibody against IFN-a remarkably reduced IFN-a production by polyI:C in cells infected with isolate 3, and that 1 U/ml of rIFN-a added to poly I:C treated cells greatly increased the levels of IFN-a detected. Tolllike receptor 3 (TLR3) which recognizes polyI:C (Alexopoulou et al., 2001) could be also involved in the enhancement of IFN production. Measles virus strains with IFN-b inducing properties up-regulated the expression of TLR3 resulting in enhanced IFN-b production in response to polyI:C (Tanabe et al., 2003) . Therefore IFN produced by isolate 3 may act through a similar mechanism to up-regulate TLR3 expression followed by increased IFN-a production after polyI:C treatment.",

In the present study, the levels of PRRSV IFN induction were typically too low to use in a similarly designed suppression experiment. Therefore the suppressive effect of PRRSV isolates 7 and 12 on IFN-a production was evaluated in cells infected with isolate 3 and treated with polyI:C, and significant suppression of IFN-a was demonstrated. European PRRSV was also shown to suppress IFN-a production by TGEV, both in vitro and in vivo (Albina et al., 1998a) . However, this result was not corroborated in vivo by another group using the closely related porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) (Buddaert et al., 1998) . Microarray experiments have indicated that polyI:C, IFN and viruses induced different subsets of the same cellular genes by activating diverse signaling pathways (Geiss et al., 2001) . Since IFN-a production was enhanced by the addition of polyI:C, it is likely that PRRSV isolates 7 and 12 suppress an IFN-a synthesis pathway activated by isolate 3 and polyI:C but not polyI:C alone. It has been shown that viruses which are resistant to the effects of IFN or can suppress IFN production have increased opportunities to spread before activation of the adaptive immune response (Moskophidis et al., 1994; Naniche et al., 2000) . Mouse models of viral infection have clearly demonstrated that disrupting the IFN response leads to higher levels of viral replication. Mice deficient in an IFN receptor exhibited increased susceptibility to LCMV (van den Broek et al., 1995) and extensive spread of LCMV infection correlated with an isolate's relative resistance to IFN-a/b and IFN-g (Moskophidis et al., 1994) .",

            "text": "Viruses can suppress IFN-a synthesis both at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level. Many viruses prevent mRNA synthesis of IFN-a through various mechanisms but VSV inhibits IFN-a synthesis by shutting down the host protein synthesis (Ahmed et al., 2003) . The present study showed that PRRSV stimulated IFN-a mRNA synthesis but inhibited IFNa protein expression. This result suggests that the mechanism by which PRRSV isolates suppress IFN-a production is mediated by generally inhibiting host protein expression or by specifically inhibiting IFN-a protein expression. Half-life times of IFN mRNA and protein could be different and that might be responsible for differences between mRNA and protein levels of IFN. However, increases in IFN-a mRNA expression for PRRSV infected PAM cultures were consistently detected at multiple times postinfection, yet for cells infected with isolate 7 or 12 very low to undetectable levels of IFN-a protein were typically observed at all times p.i. Thus, although the mechanisms of IFN-a suppression by PRRSV remain to be elucidated, data presented herein show that it is likely to be post-transcriptional in nature.",

            "text": "While the immune response against PRRSV is poorly understood, experimental work has demonstrated that the adaptive immune response of PRRSVinfected pigs is generally ineffective (Horter et al., 2002; Mengeling et al., 1996; reviewed by Murtaugh et al., 2002; Wills et al., 1997 Wills et al., , 2003 . Specific evidence of this includes a slow neutralizing antibody response, which is typically not detected until 3 weeks p.i. (Albina et al., 1998b) and does not reach maximum levels until 10-18 weeks p.i. (Nelson et al., 1994; Yoon et al., 1995) . Wide variation has been shown in individual animals, with some studies demonstrating that many infected animals fail to develop a neutralizing antibody response (Loemba et al., 1996; Nelson et al., 1994) . While the importance of a cell-mediated response for protection against PRRSV has not been debated, the effectiveness of this response during the early phases of disease also appears to be suboptimal (reviewed by Murtaugh et al., 2002) . For example, the T-cell response to PRRSV is weak and transient and cannot be restimulated for more than 4 weeks post-challenge (Meier et al., 2000; Molitor et al., 1997) . Additionally, IFN-g responses of PRRSV-infected pigs were relatively weak and increased slowly in comparison to pseudorabies virus infected pigs (Meier et al., 2003) . Although the precise mechanisms for the ineffective nature of the adaptive immune response to PRRSV is not known, PRRSV evasion of the innate immune responses, such as the type I IFN response, may set the stage for subsequent subversion of the adaptive immune response.",

            "text": "In conclusion, the data presented in this study demonstrates that North American PRRSV field isolates are distinctively different in their in vitro IFN phenotypes, a difference that could contribute to the variable clinical signs and pathology observed in PRRSV infections. Moreover, the lack of IFN response following infection with PRRSV could be involved in the establishment of persistent infections or secondary bacterial and viral infection, both of which are characteristic of PRRSV infections in swine. However, in vivo studies are required to fully define the role of type I IFN in PRRSV pathogenesis and virulence. The mechanisms involved in enhancement of IFN-a by PRRSV infected and polyI:C treated cells remains to be elucidated. Additionally, it will be important to determine whether PRRSV generally inhibits host protein synthesis or specifically downregulates IFN expression and to identify the viral proteins that contribute to the different IFN response among PRRSV isolates. Knowledge about the role of IFN in PRRSV pathogenesis will provide new hypotheses for improved vaccines or methods to modulate the immune response in order to more effectively control PRRSV infection.",
