            "text": "CXR at the 4 th day of admission DISCUSSION Middle East respiratory syndrome is a viral respiratory illness that was first identified in Saudi Arabia in September 2012. It is caused by a novel coronavirus (called MERS-CoV) (1). Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that produce a wide spectrum of illnesses in humans, from the common cold to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The MERS-CoV genetically and epidemiologically differs from the previously recognized coronaviruses such as the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which caused the SARS pandemic in south east of Asia in 2003-2004. A number of viruses in this family also cause disease in animals. The World Health Organization (WHO) was informed of a total of 1595 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection, including 571 deaths (current outbreak situation in the Republic of Korea and China as of 11 September 2015 with 186 confirmed causes and 36 deaths) (2). The main source of MERS-CoV has not yet been clearly understood. Although not established, the infection could be primarily zoonotic in nature, with limited human-tohuman transmission. Molecular investigation indicated that bats in Saudi Arabia might play a role in human infection (10). Previous experience with animal and human coronaviruses and seroepidemiological studies from dromedary camels demonstrated a high prevalence of antibody reactive to MERS-CoV (3). Strains of MERS-CoV that contest human strains have been isolated from camels in Egypt, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. These investigations supported a scenario of a virus reservoir in bats with a peridomestic animal such as the camel as intermediate host, which may in fact be the immediate source of human infection(11). Genetic sequencing data revealed a close link association between the virus found in camels and that found in human(12). These studies supported the hypothesis that camels or camel related products are the expected source of infection in humans (3).Most MERS-CoV cases have been reported in adults (median age approximately 50 years, and male , and rapidly progressive pneumonitis, respiratory failure, septic shock and multi-organ failure resulting in death(1,13,14). Most hospitalized MERS-CoV patients have had underlying medical disorders such as diabetes, hypertension, chronic cardiac disease, and chronic renal disease or immunosuppression but MERS-CoV infections were seen in previously healthy cases(14).Data suggest that MERS-CoV presents primarily with respiratory symptoms (similar to those found in SARS-CoV) as a flu-like illness with signs and symptoms of pneumonia. Common symptoms in patients with MERS-CoV include fever, chills/rigors, headache, non-productive cough, dyspnea, shortness of breath, myalgia and gastrointestinal symptoms. However, SARS infections did not cause renal failure, unlike MERS-CoV (13, 14). Among confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported to date, the case fatality ratio is approximately 28-30% (2, 13). Although MERS-CoV has low overall person-to-person transmission potential, most MERS-CoV cases are acquired through person-to-person transmission (15), including the most recent South Korean outbreak of MERS in 2015 (4, 5, 6, 7, 16). Human-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV can occur in health care providers and may be associated with substantial morbidity and occasionally mortality (10). A significant fraction of MERS cases were linked to the healthcare setting, ranging from 49% for the nosocomial outbreak in Jeddah and Saudi Arabia in 2014 (17) to 100 % for both the outbreak in Al-Hasa, Saudi Arabia, in 2013 (10) and the recent outbreak in South Korea in 2015 (16).",

            "text": "Potential routes of transmission included respiratory droplets (was the most likely mode of transmission), with the possibility of direct or indirect contact and airborne transmission during aerosol-generating procedures as other possible routes of transmission(20). One study showed that many healthcare workers were involved in aerosol generating procedures, such as intubation (71.4%), airway suctioning (57%) and sputum induction (28.6%)(21).Base on the WHO disease outbreak news, 6 cases of MERS-CoV infection have been reported from Iran; 5 cases in Kerman Province during May-July 2014 and 1 case in Kahnooj city in March 2015 (22). Since most cases of disease have been reported in the Middle East especially Saudi Arabia, the risk of returning Hajj pilgrims contracting and spreading MERS-CoV from Saudi Arabia is high (23) and owing to the nosocomial nature of the last outbreak, it is particularly important to identify cases and stop similar preventable tragic outbreaks, with training of the epidemiological determinants, molecular diagnostic tests and management in health care workers and reporting suspected and confirmed cases. The center for disease control recommend that travelers to countries in or 266 Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) Tanaffos 2015; 14(4): 262-267 near the Arabian Peninsula protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including MERS, by washing their hands often and avoiding contact with persons who are ill. If travelers to these regions have fever and symptoms of respiratory illness during their trip or within 14 days of their return, they should seek medical care (24). Prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV Infection in health care services. It is not always possible to detect patients with MERS-CoV early enough because, like other respiratory infections, the early symptoms of MERS-CoV are nonspecific. Therefore, health-care workers should always follow standard precautions for all patients, regardless of their diagnosis. Droplet precautions should be added to the standard precautions when providing care to patients with symptoms of acute respiratory infection; contact precautions and eye protection should be added when caring for probable or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection; airborne precautions should be applied when performing aerosol generating procedures (25). At this time there is no definite therapy or effective vaccine for MERS-CoV. The clinical experience from SARS suggests that a number of interventions including ribavirin with and without corticosteroids, interferon alpha with corticosteroids, ribavirin with lopinavir and ritonavir, and convalescent plasma may advance the outcome in patients but the data are not conclusive (26). CONCLUSION MERS outbreaks are significantly augmented in the healthcare facilities, and infection in the healthcare setting is an important risk factor for person to-person transmission. It is not easy to recognize patients with MERS-CoV during the early stages of the disease based on clinical presentations alone. Thus, enhanced infection control practices in medical facilities should be attempted to protect those at risk of MERS. Since no specific treatment or effective vaccine is available, development of an effective vaccine is an important public health priority.",

To date, a total of 186 MERS-CoV cases, including 36 deaths, have been reported in the Republic of Korea (5). The outbreak in the Republic of Korea has been associated with health care facilities and all cases reported so far include healthcare workers caring for confirmed cases, patients who were being cared for at the same healthcare facilities as confirmed patients, and family members of confirmed patients (6, 7). Thus, infection prevention and control measures are critical to prevent the possible spread of MERS-CoV in the health care facilities.
