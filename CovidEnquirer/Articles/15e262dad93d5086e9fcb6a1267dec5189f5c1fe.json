UNITAID aims to help solve these problems through an innovative initiative for the collective management of intellectual property (IP) rights -a patent pool for HIV medicines. The idea behind a patent pool is that patent holders -companies, governments, researchers or universities -voluntarily offer, under certain conditions, the IP related to their inventions to the patent pool. Any company that wants to use the IP to produce or develop medicines can seek a license from the pool against the payment of royalties, and may then produce the medicines for use in developing countries (conditional upon meeting agreed quality standards). The patent pool will be a voluntary mechanism, meaning its success will largely depend on the willingness of pharmaceutical companies to participate and commit their IP to the pool. Generic producers must also be willing to cooperate. The pool has the potential to provide benefits to all.",

This straightforward treatment regimen for HIV/AIDS is currently the mainstay of treatment programmes in many developing countries. Fixed-dose combinations (FDC) that combine two or more medicines into one pill have simplified AIDS treatment protocols, facilitated patient adherence and reduced the risk of drug resistance. Vigorous generic competition has reduced medicines prices to around US$ 87 for the first-line FDC of stavudine, lamivudine and nevirapine -roughly 1% of the price a decade ago. These factors combined have helped make possible a ten-fold increase in access to antiretroviral (ARV) therapy in the developing world within the span of just six years.",

The governments of Brazil, Chile, France, Norway and the United Kingdom launched UNITAID at the UN General Assembly in September 2006. To date, 29 countries have committed to contribute, the majority of which are low-and middle-income. 1 Countries levy a tax on flights leaving from their territories, and can adapt the tax according to their individual circumstances. For example, in France the tax is 1 EUR on short-haul economyclass tickets, and up to 40 EUR on long-haul business-class flights. A full flight from Paris to New York raises enough to cover a year's treatment for 60 HIV-positive children. Other countries are committing multi-year budgetary contributions, as has the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. UNITAID is an innovative financing mechanism that draws on both industrialized and developing countries to provide sustainable, long-term funding for health [2] .",

Finally, UNITAID worked with WHO and UNICEF to speed shipments of artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) for malaria to Liberia and Burundi in 2007 in order to avert a stockout.

An FDC of three of these drugs currently does not exist or is in limited supply. The patents on every compound in this triple-therapy are held by a different company. A generic company seeking voluntary licenses for the development and production of these FDCs would have to obtain licences from four different patent-holders.

At a panel on the UNITAID patent pool at the 2008 Mexico City AIDS Conference, representatives of drug companies also expressed their openness to the idea [9] . Pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) has announced that it would make available its neglected disease-related patents through a pool and has called on other companies to follow suit [10] ; others would be able to access those patents to develop medicines for the world's Least Developed Countries. Notably, GSK so far has not included HIV-related patents in the pool, which has prompted UNITAID to call on GSK to join the UNITAID initiative [11] . The Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) endorsed the UNITAID patent pool initiative in its meeting on 5 September 2008.

The patent pool operational plan will be presented to the UNITAID Executive Board in December 2009. The initial focus of the pool will be on AIDS drugs. It will concentrate on urgently-needed products that have not yet been developed, such as FDCs and pediatric ARVs, and on existing products with high prices that may decrease with economies of scale, such as many second-line ARVs. UNITAID has worked with the WHO HIV/AIDS Programme and the Department of Essential Medicines and Pharmaceutical Policies to draw up a list of missing essential ARVs [15] . The next steps will be to establish a licensing agency and to work with the relevant patent owners to agree on the specific licensing terms. Once up and running and proven effective, the patent pool could expand to respond to other diseases and health needs in developing countries.",
