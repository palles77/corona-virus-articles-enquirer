To uncover the dynamical mechanisms, the evolving spatiotemporal patterns and critical phenomena of networked coevolution spreading are extremely important, which provide theoretical foundations for us to control epidemic spreading, predict collective behaviors in social systems, and so on. The coevolution spreading dynamics in complex networks has thus attracted much attention in many disciplines. In this review, we introduce recent progress in the study of coevolution spreading dynamics, emphasizing the contributions from the perspectives of statistical mechanics and network science. The theoretical methods, critical phenomena, phase transitions, interacting mechanisms, and effects of network topology for four representative types of coevolution spreading mechanisms, including the coevolution of biological contagions, social contagions, epidemic-awareness, and epidemic-resources, are presented in detail, and the challenges in this field as well as open issues for future studies are also discussed.",

When investigating spreading dynamics, scientists wish to understand certain important aspects, such as what are the dynamical mechanisms behind the phenomena, whether there will be an outbreak, how many individuals will be infected, when will an individual be infected, and how to effectively predict and contain the spread. Addressing these problems provides many beneficial aspects for our society. For governments, the situations of epidemics could be apperceived, and effective containment measures could be provided [6] . For e-commerce, certain personalized recommendation strategies could be designed to promote the diffusion of products (e.g., popular clothing) [7] . For economics, financial risks may be perceived at an early stage and thus global economic crises could be evaded to some extent [8] .",

Historically, the single spreading dynamics was placed in a well-mixed population, without any differences among individuals [4, 10] . Following this idea, researchers can theoretically predict the outbreak size, critical threshold, and associated critical phenomena. However, in reality, an individual only has contacts with a limited number of other individuals. This constraint can be characterized by a network G(V , E), where V and E are sets of nodes and edges, with nodes representing individuals and edges denoting interactions between individuals. Accordingly, scientists studied the single spreading dynamics on oversimplified networks (e.g., regular networks and Erd\u00f6s-R\u00e9nyi (ER) [11] random networks), and analytically obtained the outbreak threshold and epidemic prevalence [12] .",

For example, the node degree (i.e., the number of edges of a node) can vary over a few orders of magnitude, exhibiting a highly heterogeneous nature [13] . Other frequently observed features that cannot be well captured by the oversimplified models include the small-world property [14] , community structure [15] , multiplexity [16] , spatiality [17] , temporality [18] , and so on. In a pioneering work [19] , Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani studied a single infectious virus on networks with power-law degree distribution (named as scale-free (SF) networks), and revealed that there is no epidemic threshold for a specific range of the degree exponent. Following this work, researchers found the spreading dynamics, such as for a global infectious disease, can be better predicted by accounting for more topological features of real networks [20, 21] . Many reviews and books have already summarized the state-of-the-art progress in single dynamics [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] .",

The propagation of disease-related information in social media could largely suppress the spreading of the corresponding epidemic disease [33] . In an extremely important case, in the early stage of the spreading of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in China, an unofficial message entitled ''There is a fatal flu in Guangzhou'' was sent to tens of millions of individuals [34] . As a result, individuals adopted simple but effective actions (e.g., staying home or wearing face masks) to protect themselves from being infected by SARS, which greatly decreased the final number of infected individuals. Scientists have already made efforts to uncover and understand the interaction mechanisms, spatiotemporal evolution patterns, critical phenomena, and phase transitions of networked coevolution spreading. The complex interactions during the coevolving dynamics lead to rich phase transition phenomena and novel physics, such as coexistence thresholds caused by competitive interactions [35] and discontinuous phase transition caused by synergetic interactions [36] . In addition, the multiscale structure of networks remarkably affects not only the value of thresholds, but also the critical exponents [37] and the type of phase transitions [38] of spreading dynamics. Therefore, the coevolution spreading dynamics on complex networks has attracted increasing attention in recent years.",

First, a large number of papers about coevolution spreading dynamics have emerged recently, but there is still a lack of a comprehensive review to systematically organize these results, discuss major challenges at the current stage, and point out open issues for future studies. Second, the early literature used different expressions to describe essentially the same mathematical problems and methods. It is thus urgent to unify the problem description and the symbolic system. Third, researchers have already tried to find certain potential applications, but these application possibilities are scattered in disparate fields, and lack integration. Accordingly, this review will be helpful to researchers already in the field, those who intend to enter the field, and those who wish to apply the related findings, and it will also contribute to the further development of the field.",

Four representative types of networked coevolution spreading are considered, including the coevolution of biological contagions, social contagions, awareness-epidemic and resources-epidemic. In Section 2, we introduce the coevolution spreading of biological contagions, in which each contact between susceptible and infected nodes may trigger the transmission of the infection. We mainly focus on the most representative biological contagions, i.e., epidemic spreading. However, in the spreading processes for political information, innovative products, and new drugs, a single contact is insufficient to eliminate the risk of adoption for susceptible individuals, and thus multiple contacts are necessary. The coevolution spreading of social contagions is presented in Section 3, which focuses on the spreading dynamics involving the above social reinforcement effects. To contain the epidemic, certain coevolution spreading strategies are developed. In Sections 4 and 5, we respectively introduce the coevolution of awareness and an epidemic, and the coevolution of resources and an epidemic. Finally, in Section 6 we sketch the landscape of this emerging field, summarize representative progress, and make discuss the outlooks of the current challenges and future open issues of the field.",

Susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) and susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) are the most representative models for biological contagions in networks. For the reversible SIS model, a node can be in the susceptible or infected state. At each time step, each infected node tries to transmit the infection to every susceptible neighbor with rate \u03b2, and then returns to the susceptible state with rate \u03b3 . For the irreversible SIR model, each infected node also tries to infect every susceptible neighbor with rate \u03b2, but with the difference that the infected node then becomes recovered with rate \u03b3 . The recovered node does not participate in the remaining spreading process. The effective transmission rate is denoted as \u03bb = \u03b2/\u03b3 . Other well-known models for biological contagions include the susceptible-infected (SI) model, susceptible-infected-recovered-susceptible (SIRS) model, contact process, and so on.

Within the traditional framework for well-mixed populations of homogeneous networks (e.g., random networks and regular lattices), such a long lifetime suggested that the effective transmission rate was much larger than the epidemic threshold. However, the average fraction of the infected population was very small, which in contrast suggested a small value of the effective transmission rate in the traditional framework.

For example, if there is only one seed node, the dynamical correlations are obvious because the contagion path has the same source, and the epidemic transmission events to one node coming from two neighbors may be correlated [52] . To overcome the weaknesses of the quenched mean-field approach but retain its advantages, i.e., to take into consideration the full network structure, the dynamic message-passing approach was proposed by Karrer and Newman [53] to study the SIR model, and generalized later by Shrestha et al. to describe the SIS model [54] . By disallowing a node in the ''cavity'' state from transmitting an infection to its neighbors but allowing it to be infected by them, the ''echo chamber'' [55] (i.e., where a node is reinfected by a neighbor it previously infected) is reduced in the dynamic message-passing approach. The dynamic message-passing approach predicts that the epidemic threshold is \u03bb c = 1/\u039b B , where B is the non-backtracking matrix. Note that B is a 2M \u00d7 2M nonsymmetric matrix with rows and columns indexed by directed edges i \u2190 j, where M is the number of edges. The element of B is",

Miller [67] also claimed that clustering reduces the epidemic size and increases the epidemic threshold, and network clustering is an important factor in controlling the growth rate of epidemic spreading [68] . However, the effects of clustering seem to be dependent on the underlying network models. For example, studies on random SF networks with high clustering coefficients showed that high clustering cannot restore a finite epidemic threshold [69] . In a solvable model, Newman theoretically proved that higher clustering leads to an even lower epidemic threshold, because redundant paths introduced by triangles in the network provide more opportunities for the susceptible nodes to be infected [70] . Wang et al. [71] revealed that there is a double transition when epidemics spread on networks with cliques. Most theoretical analyses are under the thermodynamic limit (i.e., assuming the network size is infinite) whereas real-world networks are of finite sizes. No\u00ebl proposed an accurate theoretical framework to address the time evolution of epidemic dynamics on finite-size networks [72] .

By treating a simple network as a special weighted network with each edge associated with weight 1, it is obvious that real weighted networks are always of more heterogeneous weight distributions than that of a simple network. Indeed, scientists have demonstrated that the heterogeneity of the weight distribution markedly affects the epidemic dynamics, including both the epidemic threshold and epidemic prevalence [82] [83] [84] . Among the earliest works, Yan et al. [82] showed that nodes with larger strengths (a node's strength is defined by the sum of the weights of its associated edges) are preferentially infected. To accurately predict the epidemic spreading on weighted networks, Wang et al. [84] developed an edge-weight-based compartmental approach.

Saumell-Mendiola et al. [88] studied the SIS model on interconnected networks. Through a generalized heterogeneous mean-field theory, they found that the global endemic state may occur, even though the epidemics cannot outbreak on each network separately. On the contrary, for the SIR model on interconnected networks, the epidemic occurs on both subnetworks when the coupling is strong enough; otherwise, a mixed phase exists [89] . Arruda et al.

Miller treated the fast epidemic as completing its spread before the slow epidemic is large enough to warrant consideration, and developed a low-dimensional edge-based compartmental approach to describe the two SIR competing spreading dynamics. Miller found two different situations, which depend on the initial seed sizes \u03c1 0 1 and \u03c1 0 2 of the two epidemics. If one epidemic has a much larger seed size than the other, the epidemic with larger seeds infects most of the nodes, and the other epidemic cannot spread in the residual network. When \u03c1 0 1 and \u03c1 0 2 are relatively large, the two epidemics first grow exponentially with rates r 1 and r 2 . It is assumed that r 1 > r 2 , and C is given by C = ln \u03c1 0 2 \u2212(r 2 /r 1 ) ln \u03c1 0 1 . To determine the bounds of the coexistence of two epidemics, Miller assumed that the epidemics exponential growth continues forever, and obtained two critical values C min and C max . When C < C min , epidemic 1 breaks out before epidemic 2, and vice versa for C > C max . Considering the effects of mobility of individuals, Poletto et al. [106] proposed a novel model with two competing epidemics in a metapopulation network. The metapopulation network is composed of N s subpopulations, and the edges between the subpopulations are connected according to a given degree distribution. Each subpopulation has a given number of individuals, and each individual moves to a neighboring subpopulation randomly. It is assumed that the two epidemics have different infectious periods, but the same basic reproductive number. Poletto et al. found that the structure of the population and the mobility of hosts across subpopulations affect the infectious period of the dominant epidemic. Poletto et al. [107] further considered a different situation, in which the two epidemics have different basic reproductive numbers and infectious periods. Poletto et al. revealed that mobility can either have no effect on the competition dynamics or play an important role in shaping the dominant epidemic.",

            "text": "The scenario of two competing SIS epidemics on complex networks has also been widely studied. Generally speaking, two epidemics evolve according to the SIS model with infection probabilities \u03b2 1 and \u03b2 2 . The recovery probabilities of the two epidemics are \u03b3 1 and \u03b3 2 . To include the competing mechanism between two epidemics, scientists assumed that each susceptible node infected by one epidemic decreases its probability of being infected by the other one. For the case of two completely competing SIS epidemics on complex networks, i.e., each susceptible can only be infected by one of the two epidemics, Prakash et al. found that the stronger epidemic completely suppresses the other [108] . Once the two competing SIS epidemics have partial immunizing functions, there is a coexistence region of the two epidemics [109] . Bovenkamp et al. studied two competing SIS epidemics on a complete network [110] , and revealed that only one epidemic exists when the transmission probability is above the epidemic threshold, which is markedly different from the observations of competing SIR epidemics. Disallowing epidemic extension by allowing one node to become infected automatically when there are no infected nodes, the dominant and dominated epidemics alternate when the two epidemics are identical. The domination period of an epidemic depends on its initially infected nodes. Yang et al. developed the criteria for the extinction of both epidemics and for the survival of only one epidemic when two competing epidemics have general infection rates [111, 112] . Wang et al. proposed a competing SIS model to describe idea-spreading dynamics [113] . Assuming that the effective transmission rates of the first and second ideas are \u03bb 1 = \u03b2 1 /\u03b3 1 and \u03bb 2 = \u03b2 2 /\u03b3 2 , respectively, if node i is only surrounded by idea 1 (or 2), it will be infected with rate n 1 \u03b2 1 (or n 2 \u03b2 2 ), where n 1 (or n 2 ) is the number of neighbors infected by idea 1 (or 2). If node i is exposed to both ideas, the infection probabilities are \u03b1 c \u03b2 1 and \u03b7 c \u03b2 2 for ideas 1 and 2, respectively, where 0 \u2264 \u03b1 c , \u03b7 c \u2264 1. Through a generalized heterogeneous mean-field theory, Wang et al. found that the system has a coexistence region of the two ideas on SF networks, and this region depends on whether the ideas have exclusive or nonexclusive influences. Different epidemics may transmit on distinct networks. Considering this factor, Sahneh and Scoglio proposed a competitive epidemic spreading model SI 1 SI 2 S over arbitrary multilayer networks [114] . In this model, each node can be in one of three states: susceptible, I 1 (i.e., infected by epidemic 1), and I 2 (i.e., infected by epidemic 2). The two epidemics spread on networks A and B with effective transmission rates \u03bb 1 = \u03b2 1 /\u03b3 1 and \u03bb 2 = \u03b2 2 /\u03b3 2 , respectively, where \u03b2 1 (\u03b2 2 ) is the transmission rate of epidemic 1 (epidemic 2), and \u03b3 1 (\u03b3 2 ) is the recovery rate of epidemic 1 (epidemic 2). Note that a node cannot be infected by two epidemics simultaneously. Using the first-order mean-field approximation, the evolutions of the fractions of nodes infected by epidemics 1 and 2 are, respectively,",

Such a cooperative effect is also called a synergetic effect. For example, once a person is infected by HIV/AIDS, his/her immune system becomes severely compromised, and thus the probability that he/she may become infected by systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), syphilis, or hepatitis increases. Conversely, if a person infected by the latter diseases (e.g., SLE) is exposed to HIV, his/her infection probability is increased. Cai et al. [36] proposed a coevolution SIR spreading model with a cooperative effect between two epidemics, in which a node that has not yet been infected will be infected by one of the two epidemics with probability \u03bb 1 , and a node that has already been infected by one epidemic will be infected by the other with probability \u03bb 2 > \u03bb 1 . The two epidemics have the same recovery probability. The recovered nodes acquire immunity against the epidemic they had, but not against the other epidemic. Extensive numerical simulations have been performed on ER networks with average degree \u27e8k\u27e9 = 4.

For cooperative spreading dynamics on two-dimensional lattices with local contacts or on BA networks, there is no discontinuous transition. However, discontinuous transitions always appear for cooperative contagions on two-dimensional lattices with long-range connections, on four-dimensional lattices, and on ER networks. Chen et al. further investigated the fundamental properties of cooperative contagion processes of two SIS epidemics [116, 117] . It was assumed that a node had a higher rate of infection by one epidemic once it was already infected by another epidemic. Mathematically, it was assumed that the spreading dynamics occurred in well-mixed populations, and the system exhibited a discontinuous phase transition. In a recent study, Chen et al. [118] investigated a model of two interacting SIS epidemics, in which the reproduction number is altered by the interaction introducing a potential change in the secondary infection propensity. When the susceptible nodes move faster than the infected nodes, and the interaction strength is not very strong (i.e., neither too competitive nor too cooperative), there is a nontrivial spatial infection pattern in the system. Cui et al. [119] further analyzed two cooperative SIR epidemics proposed in Ref. [36] on uncorrelated SF networks, and developed a generalized heterogeneous mean-field theory to describe the cooperative spreading dynamics. They found that the outbreak threshold is \u03bb 1 c = \u27e8k\u27e9/(\u27e8k 2 \u27e9 \u2212 \u27e8k\u27e9), which is the same as the classical epidemic outbreak threshold.

For single biological contagions on complex networks, the system always exhibits a continuous phase transition, and the threshold and critical behavior are associated with the network topologies. To describe the spreading dynamics quantitatively, each widely used theoretical approach has limitations and advantages. To summarize, the DMP approach can take into account the full topology of the network and deal with partial dynamical correlations, whereas the heterogeneous mean-field approach, bond percolation theory, edge-based compartmental approach, and quenched mean-field theory only perform well in networks with specific topological properties (e.g., uncorrelated local tree-like networks). For two successive biological contagions, the first epidemic may provide immunity or convenience to the second epidemic, and thus suppress or promote the second one. Generally, the coexistence threshold of two epidemics is larger than the first epidemic threshold. For the coevolution of two epidemics, scientists found that competing or cross-immunity interactions can induce the coexistence phase, and the phase diagram is affected by the network topology. For cooperative epidemics, the discontinuous phase transition and hysteresis loop are included, depending on the network dimensions and spreading dynamics. Finally, when multiple epidemics are simultaneously spreading, epidemic clusters emerge, with the exponent of cluster mass size versus diameter being close to the fractal dimension of percolation. The threshold and phase transition can be analytically solved on well-mixed populations.",

In the adoption of a social behavior, multiple confirmation, i.e., the social reinforcement effect, of the credibility and legitimacy of the social behavior is always sought, which has become a key differentiating factor from biological contagions, in which a simple contact is sufficient to trigger the infection. Thus, social contagion processes cannot be described by the biological contagion model. To understand the underlying mechanisms and to make the full use of social contagion, much empirical analysis and modeling work has been devoted to this research area. Therein, Centola's [136] health behavior experiment on an online social network reveals that the social enforcement effect really exists, the threshold model [137, 138] is a well-known model in studying social contagions, and so on.",

As a generalization of the classical Watts threshold model [138] , we also address the spreading threshold model and introduce the relevant progress. The interest in this part lies in uncovering how the dynamical mechanisms and network structures affect social contagions. The second part is devoted to the interaction of two social contagions. There, we will revisit the models established to capture successive and simultaneous social contagions on complex networks. Our main concern is how the mutual interactions impact the threshold and the type of phase transitions. In the final part, we will generalize the interactions of two social contagions to the interactions of multiple social contagions, empirically and theoretically. This topic will be quite challenging, because their interactions become more complicated, and it is also more important, as they are widely observed in natural, social, and technological systems.",

As early as 1973, Granovetter showed that information spreading through ''weak ties'' between casual acquaintances is faster than that diffusing through ''strong ties'' among close friends [137] . This is because weak ties are usually edges connecting distant nodes, which can accelerate the spreading. The theory of weak ties explained the rapid spread of the HIV disease and information well; however, it cannot give the reason why it fails when using the contagion of preventative measures to stop the HIV disease [139] on the same network. This is mainly because of the difference between the spread of an infectious disease and the contagion of preventative measures, where the former is a simple contagion for which one infected individual is sufficient to reproduce the infection, and the latter is a social contagion that requires multiple sources of activation, as this type of spread is usually uncertain, risky, and costly. In this subsection, we will revisit the progress of empirical analyses that reveal the potential mechanism, i.e., social reinforcement, of social behavior adoption and the established mathematical models for single social contagions on complex networks.",

Centola [136] recruited 1528 participants online and tested the effects of the network structure on the contagion of health behavior. By comparing the spreading of health behavior on a regular clustered network and a random network (as shown in the left panel of Fig. 8 ), Centola found that the behavior spreads farther and faster across clustered networks than random networks, because the participants can receive social reinforcement from multiple neighbors in the former network (as presented in the right panel of Fig. 8 ). This is significantly different from the results of biological contagions, where a clustered structure usually suppresses the spreading. To investigate the robustness of Centola's experiment, L\u00fc et al. [140] proposed an unknown-known-approved-exhausted model, which emphasizes the effect of social reinforcement by incorporating a mechanism by which redundant signals can increase the approval rate. They found that under certain conditions, information spreads faster and more broadly in a regular clustered network than in a random network, which to some extent supports the results of Centola's experiments. However, increasing the network size tends to favor effective spreading in a random network, which challenges the validity of the abovementioned experiment for larger-scale systems. Moreover, they found that introducing a low degree of randomness into a regular network yields the most effective information spreading. Similar to Ref. [140] , Zheng et al. [141] further claimed that increasing the network size or decreasing the average degree enlarges the difference in the final fraction of approved nodes between regular and random networks. Smoking behaviors explicitly inflict the effects on people around the smokers; as a result, they also impact the initiation and cessation of smoking [142] . Christakis and Fowler studied the effects of peer influences on quitting behavior by analyzing a network of 12,067 people who underwent repeated assessments of their smoking behavior and social-network ties over a period of 32 years [143] . They found that the likelihood for a smoker to quit smoking depends on their exposure to multiple contacts with nonsmokers. The social reinforcement in encouraging smokers to abstain is also found online. Myneni et al. [144] found that smokers are more likely to abstain if they are exposed to several abstinent users by examining peer interactions over QuitNet-a social media platform for smokers attempting to quit. A series of other studies also demonstrated that the effects of social reinforcement from the peers were strengthened when the peers come from different social groups, exhibit the value of structural diversity, and share some key characteristics with the ego in the dynamics of social contagion [145] .",

Granovetter [156] proposed the linear threshold model, in which all individuals are in the active or inactive states, and an individual becomes active if and only if the current absolute number of active neighbors is equal to or exceeds the corresponding threshold. As real-world networks are highly heterogeneous, within the linear threshold framework, hub nodes are too vulnerable. To overcome this weakness, Watts takes into account the heterogeneity of individuals' number of contacts and proposes a novel threshold model (later named the Watts threshold model) [138] . In the model, each node is initially assigned a threshold \u03c6, randomly drawn from a distribution h(\u03c6). When the fraction of active neighbors of a node is equal to or exceeds its threshold \u03c6, it becomes active. Adopting the fraction of active neighbors instead of the absolute number is the essential difference compared with the linear threshold model.

They found that the optimal structure can be assortative, core-periphery, or even disassortative when the average degree and the fraction of initiators are constrained. In looking for a minimal fraction of initial seeds needed to trigger a global cascade, they showed that the optimal network is a very dense community linked to a much more sparsely connected periphery. The impact of community structure on the cascade processes based on the Watts threshold model was theoretically studied by Nematzadeh et al. [168] . They constructed a network model with two homogeneous modules, where the internal connectivities of the two communities are the same, and one parameter, i.e., the fraction of edges between the two communities, is used to control the strength of the community structure.

Compared with contagions on single networks that have the same topology but without considering multiplexity, Brummitt et al. found that a multilayer network has a higher probability to experience a global cascade. Ya\u011fan and Gligor [173] proposed a content-dependent linear threshold model for social contagion in multiplex networks. In this model, each edge type i is associated with a content-dependent parameter c i in [0, \u221e] that measures the relative bias of type i in propagating this content. An inactive node becomes active if the total perceived influences, i.e., They showed that varying the fractions of nodes following either rule facilitates or inhibits cascades. Furthermore, they found that the global cascades become discontinuous near the inhibition regime, and the cascade size grows slowly as the network density increases. Li et al. [176] explored cross-layer cascade processes in multiplex networks. They found that multiplexity accelerates the cascade if the additional layer can provide extra short paths for rapid spreading. Karimi and Holme [177] modeled the cascade process in temporal networks, where individuals are only influenced by their contacts within a finite time window from the past to the present. The randomization of time stamps makes the cascades larger for the fractional-threshold mechanism [138] , whereas it makes the cascades smaller in the case of the absolute-threshold mechanism [156] . Takaguchi et al. [178] also studied the linear threshold model on empirical temporal networks incorporated with a decaying mechanism of the exposures, and showed that burst activity patterns facilitate the contagion. However, in another study of the linear threshold model on empirical temporal networks, Bachlund et al. [179] found that some networks support cascades, and some do not. Their further analysis manifested that there exists competition between the inhibition effect of burst activity patterns and the promotion effect of timing correlations between contacts on adjacent edges. Some specific models incorporating the underlying mechanisms that affect the behavioral adoption of individuals have also been established. Melnik et al. [180] purposed a multistage social contagion model accounting for the fact that individuals in different stages of the spreading process exert different levels of influence on their neighbors, which can reproduce multistage cascade phenomena. Liu et al. [181] considered a specific situation, in which individuals in the network have several opinion leaders, who affect their behaviors markedly. The impact of opinion leaders makes global cascades occur more easily, which can not only reduce the lowest average degree of the network required for a global cascade, but also increase the highest average degree of a network for which a global cascade can occur. Kobayashi [182] generalized the Watts threshold model with a trend-driven mechanism, which introduces another type of node, global nodes whose states depend on the fraction of activated nodes in the population. When the fraction of activated nodes in the population exceeds a threshold, a trend emerges and the global nodes become active. Kobayshi showed that global nodes accelerate cascades once a trend emerges, whereas their existence reduces the probability of a trend emerging. Accordingly, there exists a moderate fraction of global nodes that maximizes the average size of cascades. The persuasion mechanism, which can strengthen the ability of activated nodes to convince their neighbors to adopt the behavior is also considered in the Watts threshold model purposed by Huang et al. [183] . They found that this introduced mechanism can render networks more vulnerable to global cascades, especially in heterogeneous networks. Ruan et al. [184] generalized the Watts threshold model with mechanisms of spontaneous adoption and complete reluctance to adoption (i.e., immune or blocked nodes). They showed that the speed of spreading depends strongly on the density of blocked nodes. When the fraction of blocked nodes is small, spontaneous adopters are able to generate a large cascade. When the fraction of blocked nodes is large, because spontaneous adopters dominate the spreading, only small cascades can be generated and the spreading becomes slow. Juul and Porter [185] incorporated synergistic effects into the Watts threshold model, and found that constructive synergy (i.e., the peer pressure experienced by a node is larger than in the Watts threshold model) accelerates the contagion process and interfering synergy (i.e., the peer pressure experienced by a node is less than in the Watts threshold model) slows down the contagion process. Oh and Porter [186] accounted for the case in which individuals wait for some period of time before they adopt a behavior. Their results indicated that heterogeneously distributed wait times can change the adoption order of nodes, and either accelerate or decelerate the spread of adoptions.",

In the above-discussed models, whether a node becomes active depends only on the number of current exposures from its neighbors, without memory effects. However, the historical records may be relevant; for example, recent exposures may be more important than long-ago exposures. In such cases, memory plays a significant role and the dynamics become non-Markovian. To account for memory effects, Dodds and Watts [187, 188] proposed a generalized threshold model, where each individual i contacts with one other individual j drawn randomly from the population.

At each time step, adopted individuals transmit the behavior information to their susceptible neighbors with transmission probability \u03b2.

            "text": "Within the SAR model, there are many factors that potentially impact the behavior adoption. Wang et al. [189] took the limited contact capacity of individuals in transmitting information and suggested that enlarging the contact capacity facilitates global adoption. Considering the heterogeneity of individuals, a binary threshold model is proposed in Ref. [198] , in which some individuals have a low adoption threshold (i.e., activists), and the remaining individuals have a high adoption threshold (i.e., bigots). A hierarchical adoption phenomenon is observed, where activists first adopt the behavior and then stimulate bigots to adopt the behavior. Moreover, the model also shows crossover phenomena in the phase transition. Wang et al. [194] also explored the heterogeneous credibility of individuals in social contagion. Zhu et al. [199, 200] studied local trend imitation within a social contagion model, where both tent-like adoption and gate-like adoption probabilities were analyzed. Tent-like adoption means that the adoption probability is an increasing function of x (i.e., the fraction of adopted neighbors) when x is smaller than a certain value, above which it becomes a decreasing function of x. The gate-like adoption, however, means that the behavior adoption probability is equal to 1 when x is in a certain range, and it is equal to 0 when x is out of this range. For the tent-like case, they showed that the local trend imitation capacity impacts the phase transition, where a second-order phase transition is observed when the capacity is strong, and it becomes a first-order phase transition when the capacity is weak [199] . An optimal imitation capacity is found to maximize the final adoption size in the gate-like case [200] . Su et al. [201] proposed a susceptibletrial-adopted-susceptible (STAS) threshold model, where individuals in the trial state accept the behavior temporarily and can transmit the information. They found that the initial conditions of the dynamics affect the final state of the dynamics, which introduces a hysteresis loop in the system. Wang et al. [202] considered that individuals communicate with multiple channels. When an individual is active in one layer, he/she cannot use other channels to communicate, as individuals cannot simultaneously use all communication channels. Time delays occur and slow down the behavior adoption process; however, this does not affect the final adoption size. Wang et al. [203] proposed a model in which time delays are introduced before an individual adopts a behavior when his/her fraction of adopted neighbors is equal to or exceeds the adoption threshold. They found that long time delays induce a microtransition, which becomes sharper when high-degree individuals have a larger probability of experiencing time delays.",

Two types of synergy are introduced in the model, and the expression for \u03b2 d\u2212r (t) depends on the synergy type. When multiple donors challenge a recipient host (i.e., r-synergy type), \u03b2 d\u2212r (t) = \u03b2[n r (t)\u22121] with n r (t) representing the number of donors challenging a recipient host at time t.

When \u03b1 > \u03b1 c the steady-state density of the infected nodes exhibits explosive growth with respect to the basic transmission rate and a hysteresis loop emerges. Hoffmann and Bogu\u00f1\u00e1 [211] proposed a synergistic cumulative contagion model, which takes into account the memory of past exposures and incorporates the synergy effects of multiple infectious sources. They found that the interplay of the non-Markovian feature and a complex contagion produces rich phenomena, including the loss of universality, collective memory loss, bistable regions, hysteresis loops, and excitable phases. Rumor spreading is another type of social contagion, which rests on the basic idea that a sender continues propagating a rumor as long as it is new for the recipient. Otherwise, he/she loses interest and never spreads it. Daley and Kendall [212, 213] first proposed an ignorant-spreader-stifler model to describe the dynamical process of rumor spreading. In the model, the ignorant, spreader, and stifler states are respectively similar to the susceptible, infected, and removed states in the SIR model. In contrast to the SIR model, the recovery process (spreader becomes stifler) of the rumor model is not spontaneous. Rather, it is the consequence of individuals' interactions. In detail, both spreaders become stiflers with probability \u03b3 once they contact, and a spreader becomes a stifler with probability \u03b3 once he/she meets an another stifler. Instead of two spreaders becoming stiflers when they contact in the recovery process, Maki and Thompson [214] introduce a slightly distinct version, in which, when a spreader i contacts another individual j in the spreader state, only i turns into a stifler and the state of j remains unchanged. Barrat et al. [215] studied the rumor model on the complete graph and found that the final fraction, \u03c1(\u221e), of stiflers satisfies the following self-consistent equation",

In comparison, there are very few studies about two successively interacting social spreading processes. Liu et al. [220] proposed a successively interacting social contagion model, in which two behaviors, i.e., behavior 1 and behavior 2, spread successively on a network. The dynamical processes of both behaviors are depicted by a modified version of the SAR threshold model [189] , with a different behavioral response function. During the spread of behavior 1, for a susceptible node of degree k and with m\u22121 cumulative pieces of behavior information, when this node receives a new piece of information at this time step, the probability that it adopts the behavior is \u03c0(k, m) = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03c4 1 ) m , where \u03c4 1 is the adopting probability for each reception of behavior information. At the termination of behavior 1, a small fraction of nodes are randomly chosen and set to be in the adopted state for behavior 2. The remaining nodes are in the susceptible state for behavior 2. The spreading dynamics of behavior 2 are mathematically identical to the dynamics of behavior 1, except that the transmission probability \u03b2 2 and recovery rate \u03b3 2 are different. For simplicity, we denote the effective information transmission rate as \u03bb 2 , given by \u03bb 2 = \u03b2 2 /\u03b3 2 .

One interesting result is that the synergistic interactions can greatly enhance the spreading of the behaviors in both layers. They also found that the synergy effects alter the nature of the phase transition of the behavior adoption processes, where a small (large) value of the transmission rate of behavior 1 (with a low adoption threshold) can lead to a discontinuous (continuous) phase transition in behavior 2 (with a high adoption threshold). Moreover, a two-stage spreading phenomenon is observed with the synergy effects, whereby nodes adopting the low-threshold behavior in one layer are more likely to adopt the high-threshold behavior and further stimulate the remaining nodes to quickly adopt the behavior in the other layer. Chang and Fu [223] proposed a co-diffusion model for social contagion on a two-layer network, the layers of which are a periodic lattice and a random regular network.

The information or ideas in different social media must compete for our limited attention to become popular. To understand the role of the limited attention of individual users in the diffusion of memes, Weng et al. [228] developed an agent-based model and investigated how they shape the spread of information (see Fig. 14 for the illustration of the meme diffusion model). By tuning the length of the time window during which posts are retained in an agent's screen or memory, they can change the extent of competition. For example, a shorter time window leads to less attention and thus enhances competition, whereas a longer time window allows for paying attention to more memes and thus decreases competition. By modeling the meme spreading on real social networks and random networks, they found that the combination of a social network structure and the competition for finite user attention is a sufficient condition for the emergence of broad diversity in meme popularity, lifetime, and user activity. Gleeson et al. [229] presented an analytically solvable model of selection behavior on a social network. They assumed each screen has capacity for only one meme, corresponding to fierce competition. During each time step (with time increment \u2206t = 1/N), one node i is chosen at random. Node i then innovates with probability \u00b5 and generates a brand-new meme, which appears on its screen and is retweeted to all i's followers. Otherwise, node i retweets the meme currently on its screen. When a meme is retweeted, its popularity is incremented by 1 and the meme currently on the followers' screens is overwritten by this meme. They found that the competition among multiple memes for the limited user attention places the system at criticality. For a network of degree distribution P(k) \u221d k \u2212\u03b3 D , with 2 < \u03b3 D < 3, they derived the distribution of popularities at age a by q n (a) (i.e., a meme has been retweeted n times when its age is a) when a \u2192 \u221e as",

(37), they showed that the popularity growth of each meme is described by a critical branching process, and an asymptotic analysis predicts power-law distributions of popularities with very heavy tails in the zero-innovation limit (\u00b5 = 0). Gleeson et al. [230] further extended the above simplified model with the inclusion of memory times and heterogeneous user activity rates. Even this generalized model is more complicated; they showed that it is analytically solvable and is able to reproduce several important characteristics of empirical microblogging data on hashtag usage, such as the time-dependent heavy-tailed distributions of meme popularity. In modeling the collective behavior of users' decisions on adopting different software applications, Gleeson et al. [231] proposed a model that incorporates two distinct mechanisms: one is associated with recent user decisions and the other reflects the cumulative popularity of each application. They found various combinations of the two mechanisms that can yield long-time behavior matched with the data. However, only the models that strongly emphasize the recent popularity of applications over their cumulative popularity can reproduce the observed temporal dynamics. Myers et al. [232] studied URL diffusion on Twitter and proposed a statistical model that allows for the cooperation as well as competition of different contagions in the diffusion of retweeting behaviors. Competing contagions decrease each other's transmission rates, whereas cooperating contagions help each other. By evaluating the model on 18,000 contagions that are simultaneously spreading through the Twitter network, Myers et al. estimated the probability of a user being infected, given a sequence of previously observed contagions, and also found that the interactions between simultaneous contagions cause a relative change in the spreading probability of a contagion by 71% on average. Valera et al. [233] used continuous-time Hawkes processes to model the adoption of multiple products and conventions. An inference method was developed to estimate the parameters for both synthetic and real data. They found that this data-driven model predicts the adoption and the usage pattern of competing products and social conventions well. Meanwhile, the model reveals that the usage of more popular products and conventions is triggered by cooperation and using a less popular product or convention has a stronger inhibiting effect on future usage of a more popular product or convention than vice versa. Pathak et al. [234] proposed a generalized version of the linear threshold model to simulate multiple cascades on a network. In the model, nodes are allowed to switch their states back and forth. An algorithm was developed to estimate the most likely statistical properties of the cascades' spread and shown to be of high quality when tested with real data. ",

Experimentally, various types of social contagions, ranging from health behaviors and new crops to Skype adoption, exhibit the social reinforcement effect. That is to say, accumulative multiple contacts between adopted and susceptible individuals are necessary to trigger the infection. When including the social reinforcement effect in social contagions, the order parameter, i.e., the cascade size or final fraction of adopted (activated) individuals, changes discontinuously or continuously, depending on the strength of the social reinforcement. In addition, the network structures and the underlying mechanism incorporated in social contagion models can alter the cascade size and the type of phase transition. For two successive and simultaneous social contagions, the inhibiting or synergistic effects of one spreading behavior can render the discontinuous phase transition of the other behavior as continuous. For the coevolution of multiple competitive and multiple cooperative social contagion processes, the competition induced by limited attention or memory is a sufficient condition for the emergence of broad diversity in meme popularity, and cooperative behaviors mutually promote each other's contagion.",

            "text": "When an epidemic spreads in a society, information about the disease spreads through various types of communication platforms, such as TV news, Facebook, Twitter, text messages, phone calls, and WeChat. Once healthy individuals obtain information about the epidemic, they will be aware of the epidemic and thus take certain actions (e.g., wearing face masks or staying at home) to protect themselves from being infected by the disease, which will effectively suppress the outbreak of the infectious disease. The search to understand how awareness spreading (also called information spreading in the literature) can mitigate disease outbreaks, and more broadly, the interplay between the two types of spreading dynamics, has led to a novel research domain in network science [30] . When investigating the coevolution of awareness diffusion and epidemic spreading dynamics, scientists assume that susceptible individuals will take certain nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs, e.g., hand-washing and social distancing) once they are aware of that they are in dangerous circumstances, and thus the susceptible nodes will have a lower probability of being infected by their neighbors [235] [236] [237] . Usually, the disease outbreak threshold increases and the infected size decreases when such interventions are implemented. Vaccination is another effective measure to suppress the spreading of infectious diseases [238, 239] . In most cases, the effects of vaccination and NPIs on the epidemic spreading have been investigated separately [240] . Andrews and Bauch [241] proposed a model that includes both measures, and revealed that the practice of NPIs decreases as vaccine coverage increases, and vice versa. In the following, we discuss the recent progress on the coevolution of awareness and epidemics on single and multiplex networks.",

They can accurately estimate the current level of weekly influenza activity in each region of the United States, with a reporting lag of approximately one day. However, the results reported by Ginsberg et al. [242] were challenged until 2013, as GFT predicted more than double the fraction of doctor visits for ILI [245, 246] . Lazer et al. [247] concluded that two issues, big data hubris and the instability of the algorithm, caused GFT's errors. On the one hand, GFT developers report that the data are highly correlated with the disease control and prevention (CDC), but not related to the flu. As a result, the data quality is not very high, because certain detailed information about the epidemic issues are ignored. On the other hand, the Google search algorithm is time-varying, which induces an unstable reflection of the prevalence of the flu.",

[248] investigated the weekly series of GFT and ILI epidemics, and their synchronous evolution from 3 January 2010 to 10 December 2013 (nearly 200 weeks) in the United States [244] . Fig. 15 shows the time series of n G (t) (i.e., the number of ILIs) and n D (t) (i.e., the volume of search queries). From the macroscopic perspective, ILI and GFT have similar trends, as shown in Fig. 15(a) . The time series were further analyzed from a microscopic view. The relative growth rates of n G (t) and n D (t) are defined as v G (t) and v D (t), respectively. The growth trends of v G (t) and v D (t) are the same, as shown in Fig. 15(b) . Furthermore, the cross-correlations c(t) between the v G (t) and v D (t) time series for a given window size W l , as defined in Ref. [249] , were investigated. As shown in Fig. 15(c) , positive and negative cross-correlations c(t) are unveiled for W l = 3 and W l = 20, respectively. Once the susceptible individuals received information through GFT, they adopted certain actions to protect themselves from being infected, and thus the opposite growth was observed. The infected individuals tend to search for information about the disease, which leads to the same growth trends. Furthermore, Wang et al. found that the asymmetric interaction (i.e., the epidemic spreading promotes information diffusion but information diffusion suppresses the epidemic spreading) between information diffusion and epidemic spreading only occurred for a short period, as shown in Fig. 15(d) .",

The awareness level of individual i is updated according to the following three rules. (i) A new awareness \u2113 i = 0 is generated with probability \u03c9 if individual i is in the infected state. (ii) If individual j transmits a newer piece of awareness with level \u2113 j to his/her neighbor, individual i, with rate \u03b1, \u2113 i is updated as \u2113 i \u2190 \u2113 j + 1 when \u2113 j < \u2113 i . (iii) At each time step, the awareness level \u2113 i of node i fades to \u2113 i + 1 with probability \u03f5. For a susceptible node with awareness level \u2113, its susceptibility is 1 \u2212 h \u2113 , where 0 < h < 1. That is, the older the awareness is (i.e., the higher its level), the weaker the protection power is. In consideration of awareness, the SIR epidemic evolves as follows. An infected node transmits the infection to a susceptible neighbor of awareness level \u2113 with probability (1 \u2212 h \u2113 )\u03b2, and recovers with probability \u03b3 .

To sum up, the epidemic threshold increases if the infection and recovery rates are changed, owing to the diffusion of awareness. Agaba et al. [254] proposed a model in which the awareness is induced by two aspects: direct contacts between aware and unaware nodes and public information, and they revealed distinct dynamical regimes. Ruan et al. [255] assumed that the awareness can be generated by the information transmission, which is described by the delivery of information packets. A susceptible-infected-recovered-vaccination (SIRV) model was proposed to describe the epidemic spreading dynamics. Mathematically, the SIR component of the spreading dynamics is identical to the classical SIR model, with infection and recovery probabilities of \u03b2 and \u03b3 , respectively. A susceptible node becomes vaccinated with probability \u03ba(t). Nodes in the recovery and vaccinated states do not participate in the spreading dynamics. At each time step, there are \u03c4 N newly generated packets with randomly chosen origins and destinations, following a shortest-path routing protocol [256] . At time t, if a node receives m I (t) packets from infected neighbors, it becomes vaccinated with probability \u03ba(t) = 1\u2212e \u2212\u03b7 m I (t) k , where \u03b7 is the strength of the sensitivity to information, and k is the degree of the node. Through extensive simulations, Ruan et al. [255] found that the final epidemic size \u03c1 R (\u221e) monotonously changes with vaccination \u03c1 V (\u221e), as shown in Fig. 18 . Specifically, the epidemic may outbreak globally or locally for low vaccination prevalence, which is markedly different from other classical immunization approaches, e.g., random, degree-based, and betweenness-based approaches.",

Some interesting phenomena are observed when awareness spreading is induced by mass media. For example, sustained oscillations may occur if the awareness is larger than a threshold [259] . Wang et al. [260] investigated the effects of mass media on the spread of epidemics on complex networks, where the epidemic spreading is described by the SIS model. The mass media density is a linear function of the current epidemic prevalence. By using the approach developed in Ref.

[267] , many interesting studies have been reported [268] [269] [270] . The model proposed by Granell et al. [267] assumed that (1) the infected nodes immediately become aware, and (2) the aware nodes have a lower susceptibility with a certain probability. What happens when these two assumptions are removed? To this end, Granell et al. [268] proposed a novel model without the two assumptions but including a new aspect, i.e., that the mass media can broadcast awareness. A generalized MMCA approach is developed to describe the proposed model, and it agrees markedly well with numerical simulations. Granell et al. revealed that the first assumption has almost no effect on the epidemic spreading, whereas the second assumption and mass media indeed alter the phase diagram. For instance, the metacritical point disappears if the mass media effect is strong enough. Kan and Zhang included this mechanism in the coevolution of awareness and epidemics, and revealed that self-awareness generation (i.e., an unaware individual becoming aware spontaneously) cannot alter the epidemic outbreak threshold [269] . Starnini et al. [270] found that the temporal correlations slow down the epidemic spreading, and slow down (speed up) the awareness spreading for small (large) values of epidemic transmission probability.",

When an epidemic outbreaks, the information about the epidemic can spread on various channels such as Twitter, Facebook, and text messages through mobile phones. However, the susceptible nodes may not become aware immediately when they only receive one piece of information from their neighbors [2] . Thus, the awareness spreading exhibits a social reinforcement or herdlike feature [271] . Guo et al. proposed a local awareness-controlled contagion spreading (LACS) model to describe the coevolution of awareness and epidemics on multiplex networks [272] . The Watts threshold model [138] is used to describe the awareness spreading, in which an unaware node becomes aware if (1) the fraction of its aware neighbors exceeds a given threshold \u03c6, or (2) it is infected by the epidemic. The aware node reverts to unaware when it is susceptible or relaxes its vigilance. For the epidemic spreading dynamics, they adopted the model proposed in Ref. [267] with complete immunization, i.e., \u03bb \u2032 2 = 0. Using a generalized MMCA approach, Guo et al. obtained a highly accurate prediction of the epidemic threshold. Through extensive numerical simulations and theoretical analyses, the epidemic threshold \u03bb 2 c versus \u03c6 exhibits an abrupt decrease at \u03c6 c \u2248 0.5. For the case of \u03c6 < \u03c6 c , the epidemic size and outbreak threshold remain nearly unchanged with \u03c6. When \u03c6 > \u03c6 c , the epidemic threshold does not vary with \u03c6, but the epidemic size increases with \u03c6. Huang et al. [273] investigated the coupled contagion of awareness and an epidemic, where the former is depicted by the unaware-aware-unaware (UAU) model on the aware layer and the latter is represented by the threshold model (susceptible-infected) on the contact layer. The interacting mechanisms are introduced such that an unaware individual immediately changes to the aware state if it is infected in the contact layer. A susceptible individual can be infected by each of its infected neighbors with a certain probability if it is in the unaware state. However, an aware and susceptible individual can only be infected by the epidemic when the number of its infected neighbors is equal to or exceeds a threshold. Huang et al. found that such heterogeneous interactions can induce hybrid phase transitions in which a continuous phase transition and bi-stable states coexist.",

Pan and Yan [274] proposed a coevolution model of awareness and epidemics, in which the awareness of nodes comes from three types of information: contact information as well as local and global prevalence of the epidemic. The epidemic threshold increases with the contact-based information, but does not change with the information about the local and global prevalence of the epidemic. Furthermore, the effects of the heterogeneity of individuals' responses, and the structures of the virtual and contact networks are investigated, and the existence of two-stage effects on the epidemic threshold is demonstrated [274] .

Thus, the network topology can be treated as static networks. However, many experimental studies indicated that the network topology varies during the spreading process [18] . Guo et al. [280] assumed that the virtual network varies faster than the awareness spreading, and the contact network varies slower than the epidemic spreading. Therefore, the activity-driven network [92] is used to describe the virtual network, and the contact network is still assumed to be static. Then, the awareness spreads on the temporal network according to the UAU model as proposed in Ref. [267] . The epidemic spreading dynamics on a contact network evolves as the model in Ref. [92] . Through a generalized MMCA approach, Guo et al. found that the metacritical point is bounded by [0, 1/(m(\u27e8a\u27e9 + \u27e8a 2 \u27e9)) \u00d7 [0, 1/\u039b max (B)], where \u27e8a\u27e9 and \u27e8a 2 \u27e9 are the first and second moments of the activity potential distribution. If the awareness spreading dynamics follows a threshold model, the epidemic threshold versus \u03c6 exhibits a sharp decrease at \u03c6 \u2248 0.5, which is similar to the results in Ref. [272] . In addition, the time-variation of the virtual network promotes the epidemic spreading on the contact network. Different from the reversible SIS model, certain epidemics such as measles and chickenpox should be described by using the irreversible SIR model [1] . Wang et al. [281] assumed that the awareness spreads on a communication network (layer A), and the irreversible epidemic transmits through a contact network (layer B). For the awareness spreading dynamics, they used an SIR-like model. Specifically, each aware (or infected) node transmits the awareness to unaware (i.e., susceptible) neighbors with probability \u03bb 1 , and recovers with probability \u03b3 1 = 1. The unaware node becomes aware about the epidemic when its counterpart in the contact network is infected by the epidemic. For the epidemic spreading dynamics, an SIRV model is adopted. The infected nodes transmit the infection to susceptible neighbors with probability \u03bb 2 , and recover with probability \u03b3 2 = 1. A susceptible node i B in layer B becomes vaccinated if its counterpart in layer ",

[289] solved an optimal control problem of suppressing the epidemic through vaccination while minimizing the total cost. The model is a standard SIR model incorporating an extra vaccination rate r(t), such that the susceptible can turn into the recovered state at this rate. Then, Francis et al. solved an optimal control problem to minimize the total cost during the disease process, where the total cost is a weighted summation of the cost of vaccination and the cost from loss of utility when people are infected. The resource regulation effects from both government policy and the market were discussed. In a more realistic scene, the resource allocation is performed on spatial districts. For example, the epidemic outbreaks may occur in different but interconnected regions. Under this setting, Mbah et al. [290] studied an optimal control model to minimize the discounted number of infected individuals during the course of an epidemic with economic constraints, and investigated preferential treatment strategies. Their model is a two-region SIRS model in which the infected can be cured with a cost. The discounted number has the form \u222b \u221e 0 e \u2212rt \u03c1(t)dt, where the discount rate r aims to give greater emphasis to control in the short rather than the long term. Mbah et al. discuss the optimal control problem to minimize the discounted numbers of the two regions with total budget constraints. Their results indicated that when faced with the dilemma of choosing between socially equitable and purely efficient strategies, the optimal control strategy is not apparent but should be determined by many epidemiological factors, such as the basic reproductive number and the efficiency of the treatment measure. Apart from multiple populations from different regions, the resource allocation can occur over multiple time periods. Zaric et al. [291, 292] studied a dynamic resource allocation model in which a limited budget is allocated over multiple time periods to interventions. The epidemic model is a generalized epidemic model with multiple compartments and the interventions turn to the changes in the model parameters. Through a heuristic numerical study, Zaric et al. found that allowing for some reallocation of resources or funds over the time horizon, rather than allocating resources just once at the beginning of the time horizon, can lead to significant increases in health benefits.",

A number of studies focus on studying the algorithm of the network distribution problem. Preciado et al. [293] proposed a model in which the infection rate of each individual can be reduced by distributing the vaccination resources to them (such that they become less infective). Thus, individuals in the SIS epidemic model in the network present different levels of susceptibility, depending on how many resources they gain. Considering how to minimize the total cost of the corresponding vaccination and the corresponding outbreak asymptotic exponential decaying rate, a convex framework to find the optimal distribution of vaccinations to contain the epidemics in arbitrary contact networks is proposed. In a similar study, Enyioha et al. [294] considered a linearized SIS epidemic spreading model with the setting that the resources can be used to reduce individual infection rates or/and to increase the recovery rates.

[295] analyzed how to best allocate limited resources to each node so as to minimize the epidemic prevalence. They formulated the SIS model by the mean-field theory and solved the corresponding optimal control problem by the Lagrange multiplier method, and found counterintuitively that in the strong infection region, the low-degree nodes should be allocated more medical resources than the high-degree nodes to minimize prevalence. The above models assume that resources can be distributed to reduce the infectiousness or increase the recovery of a node. A similar idea can also be conducted on the edges. Nowzari et al. [296] assumed that the epidemic spreading can be suppressed by decreasing the strength or weight of edges when allocating resources. For example, the government Source: Reproduced from Ref.

In other words, there is a single central node in the system that controls healing. An infected node can heal if, and only if, it is connected to the central node via a path involving only healthy nodes. Interestingly, through numerical simulation, a two-phase behavior is observed such that the system converges to only one of two stationary states: either the whole population is healthy or it becomes completely infected. This gives rise to discontinuous jumps of different sizes in the infected population and larger jumps tend to emerge at lower infection rates.

Taking into account the periodic outbreaks of flu-like epidemics and the limited effectiveness of vaccines, they studied models with seasonal updating and pre-emptive vaccination, in which individuals decide whether or not to get vaccinated before each epidemic season. The strategy for individuals is to determine whether or not they vaccinate. Although it requires a cost to vaccinate, individuals also bear the cost to treat the epidemic if they are infected when they do not receive vaccination. Once the epidemic ends, individuals update their vaccination decisions for the next season by imitating the strategy of their neighbors. The neighbor with a higher payoff has higher probability for their strategy to be learned, which is described by the famous Fermi rule in game theory [306] . By this rule, an individual, say i, updates his/her vaccination strategy by randomly choosing one of its immediate neighbors, say j, and adopts the strategy of j with the following probability determined by the payoff difference",

It is found that the targeted subsidy policy is only advantageous when individuals prefer to imitate the subsidized individuals' strategy. Otherwise, the effectiveness of the targeted policy is worse. More importantly, under the targeted subsidy policy, preferential imitation causes a nontrivial phenomenon whereby the final epidemic size increases with the increase in the proportion of subsidized individuals. In summary, epidemic-control policy through resource input depends on the complex interplay among the intrinsic mathematical rules of epidemic spreading, governmental policies, and the behavioral responses of individuals.

Through analysis and numerical simulations, Long et al. find that the virus spreading can be optimally suppressed if there is no such relation between the node degrees and resource amounts they received. In other words, if each healthy node contributes equal resources to the infected nodes, the virus can be optimally suppressed and there will be a maximum outbreak threshold and minimum fraction of infected nodes. Moreover, they find that in a homogeneous network, the uneven distribution of resources (if the recovery resources of infected nodes mainly rely on nodes with large or small degrees) would lead to a discontinuous phase transition, but the phase transition is continuous under even distribution of resources. However, heterogeneous networks always go through continuous transitions. In a similar scenario, Chen et al. [311] studied another model with a preferential effect. When the transmission rate is small, the resources of the healthy nodes should be allocated preferentially to the highly infectious nodes (nodes with more infected neighbors). When the transmission rate is large, in the early stage, resources should be allocated preferentially to the highly infectious nodes, whereas after the early stage, resources should be allocated to the less infectious nodes. With the individual resource diffusion framework, Chen et al. found that the allocation strategy can adaptively change with the current fraction of infected nodes and the epidemic can be maximally suppressed under the proposed strategy, which gives a novel viewpoint to the optimal epidemic control problem under resource constraints. In the above model, the epidemic process and resource diffusion occur on the same network. Chen et al. [312] proposed a coevolution spreading model in multilayer networks, where the epidemic and resources separately spread in the Source: Reproduced from Ref. [312] . contact and social layers, respectively. At each time step, each healthy individual generates one resource unit, which are distributed equally to infected neighbors through the social layer and infected nodes consume all of the received resources to improve their recovery rate. The recovery rate of node i is \u03b3 i (t) = \u00b5 r R i (t)/k i , where R i (t) are the resources that node i receives from its healthy neighbors and \u00b5 r \u2208 [0, 1] is an efficiency coefficient. Mathematically, the epidemic threshold can be approximately computed by a generalized dynamical message-passing approach based on the nonbacktracking matrix B of the contact layer. Under this approach, the epidemic threshold is given by",

The coevolution of resources and the network topology is also an interesting problem. Aoki et al.

The dynamics of node resources are governed by a reaction-diffusion process in which nodes are coupled through the weighted links of the network. Aoki et al. showed that under feasible conditions, the weights of the network robustly acquire SF distribution in the asymptotic state, even when the underlying topology of the network is not a SF degree distribution. Interestingly, in the case in which the system includes dissipation, it asymptotically realizes a dynamical phase characterized by an organized SF network, in which the ranking of each node with respect to the quantity of the resource it possesses changes ceaselessly. Regarding the epidemic dynamics, the weight of edges of a network may indicate the infectious strength, which can adaptively change during the epidemic process. Because the coevolution of resources and the network weight exhibits abundant and various properties, the coevolution of resources, network weight, and epidemic deserves further study.",

Resource consumption arises from the resource input to reduce the spreading rate and/or from the medical cost of curing to improve the recovery rate. The optimal solution of resource allocation can be found under constant resources. If the amount of total resources is limited, the epidemic may exhibit abrupt phase transitions at certain critical points, which is different from the traditional understanding that the optimal allocation strategy and its consequential outbreak size changes continuously with the total amount of resources. This critical phenomenon indicates that a slight lack of resource input may result in a catastrophic epidemic outbreak. In the case of coevolution, an inadequate resource production rate may cause an epidemic outbreak through abrupt phase transitions, similar to the case of inadequate constant resources. Individual behavior can induce complex coevolution dynamics with different types of critical phase transitions.

For the existing works, most of the known interacting mechanisms between two spreading contagions, such as synergy, competition, and asymmetrical, have not been verified by empirical data. Whether those coevolving mechanisms are sufficient to capture the main properties of real dynamics, or whether we still need more intricate interacting models is not yet clear to us. Therefore, we should first collect as much related data as possible. For example, one could crawl the forwarding time series, network topology, and personal information about news and products, and then analyze the interacting mechanisms between the news and products. To reveal the representative features of real coevolution spreading processes from empirical data (or, more valuably but with more difficulty, from designed experiments) is the most significant task facing the advancement of credible studies on mathematical models.",

To get analytical solutions of the coevolution spreading dynamics, most previous studies made some assumptions about the network topology, such as that the network is large, sparse, local-tree-like, or static. Studies on single spreading dynamics have already indicated that each assumption markedly alters the spreading dynamics; therefore, we should systematically study the effects of network topology on coevolution spreading dynamics from the microcosmic, mesoscopic, and macroscopic views. Furthermore, the spreading on adaptive networks [315] that also incorporates the coevolution of network topology should be investigated.",

Once the human dynamics are included, the interaction patterns and transmissibility among nodes will be affected, and thus the coevolution spreading will also be affected. Temporal and spatial network representations [17] , as well as Monte Carlo simulations may be useful tools in this direction. The resilience of coevolution spreading is a potentially interesting topic. The resilience of a system is its ability to maintain its functions when some errors and attacks occur, or some environmental and dynamical parameters are changed [320] . Previous studies mainly focused on the resilience of single dynamics, such as epidemic spreading [321] , biological dynamics [322] , climate changes [323] , and financial dynamics [324] . Pananos et al. [325] studied the critical dynamics in a population with vaccinating behavior by extracting data on measles-related tweets and Google searches. They revealed the critical slowing down and critical speeding up for coevolution dynamics, which are markedly different from single spreading. Because the resilience depends on the dynamical process, do there exist some common characteristics for the resilience of coevolution spreading dynamics? For a given coevolution spreading process, how might its resilience be estimated?",

More detailed progress on vital node identification is presented in a recent review [27] . We should note that an effective vital node identification algorithm may not work for coevolution spreading dynamics. For instance, the nodes with high k-shell values are more likely to be the influential nodes; however, those nodes may inhibit the spreading when there exist asymmetrical interactions between two dynamics. Therefore, the vital node identification problem should be redefined and reanalyzed for coevolution spreading dynamics.",
