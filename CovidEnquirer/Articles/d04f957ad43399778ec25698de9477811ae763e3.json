Based on its representation in cDNA libraries, we estimate that many, if not all, trypanosome mRNAs contain this leader. This same leader was originally identified on mRNAs encoding the molecules responsible for antigenic variation, variant surface glycoproteins. Studies of selected cDNAs containing this leader sequence revealed that leader-containing transcripts can be stage-specific, stage-regulated, or constitutive. They can be abundant or rare, and transcribed from single or multigene families. No linkage between the genomic leader sequences and the structural gene exons was observed.

The VSG gene repertoire of the trypanosome contains some 300 to 1000 genes ( Van der Ploeg et al., 1982a ), yet only one VSG gene at a time is expressed. Switching transcription from one VSG gene to another leads to antigenic variation, allowing the parasite to evade the immune response of its mammalian host. The result is the relapsing parasitemia of African sleeping sickness. Some of the molecular and biological aspects of antigenic variation have been recently reviewed (Parsons et al., 1984a) .",

Comparisons of the genomic contexts of VSG genes have revealed that certain VSG genes undergo duplication when activated (Hoeijmakers et al., 1980a; Pays et al., 198la; Longacre et al., 1983; . The new expression-linked copy is located at a different site in the genome and is transcribed (Pays et al., 1981b; Bernards et al., 1981) . Other VSG genes appear to be activated in situ, as they undergo no detectable alteration in genomic organization when expressed (Young et al., 1982) . Transcriptionally active VSG genes invariably reside in regions of the genome relatively devoid of restriction enzyme recognition sites (the \"barren\" regions) ( Van der Ploeg et al., 1982b) and close to what appears to be a telomere (DeLange and Borst, 1982; Williams et al., 1982) . These data suggest that some aspects of the genomic location of VSG genes may be important for their activation. How-ever, analyses of restriction enzyme sites located 5' to the barren regions indicates that there are several sites in the genome from which VSG genes can be transcribed (Longacre et al., 1983; Myler et al., submitted; Allison et al., submitted) . Furthermore, while a VSG gene must reside in one of these sites in order to be transcribed, the opposite is not true: occupation of a particular site does not guar-' antee transcription (Buck et al., 1984; Allison et al., submitted) .",

This untranslated sequence is not encoded by DNA contiguous to the structural gene, and therefore has been termed the spliced leader (SL). Sequences encoding the SL are repeated 100-200 times in the genome of Trypanosoma brucei, and each resides in a 1.4 kb unit monomer (DeLange et al., 1983; Nelson et al., 1983) . The vast majority of these units are directly and tandemly repeated to form a large array(s). However, a few 1.4 kb units, with their resident SL sequences, are dispersed from the tandem array Parsons et al., 1984b) and are termed orphons according to the nomenclature of Childs et al. (1981) . Surprisingly, neither the large array nor the orphons are detectably linked (i.e., within 50 kb) to active VSG genes. Nevertheless, the tandem array of SL reiteration units has been proposed to mark the 5' boundary of the VSG expression site (DeLange et al., 1983) . Immediately 5' to the SL in the 1.4 kb repeat unit are sequences resembling eucaryotic RNA polymerase II promoters (DeLange et al., 1983) ; according to the multiple promoter hypothesis above, these function in the initiation of VSG gene transcription. Only that VSG gene placed downstream from the array through DNA rearrangement would be transcribed, thus only a single VSG gene at a time would be expressed.",

            "text": "Certain clues, however, indicate that the function of the SL repeat is more complex. First, the SL is transcribed not only by the mammalian bloodstream stage of the parasite, which expresses VSG and undergoes antigenic variation, but also by procyclic culture forms (analogous to the insect midgut stage of the trypanosome life cycle), which do not express VSG (DeLange et al., 1983; Parsons et al., 1984b) . Second, sequences homologous to the SL are highly reiterated in the genomes of certain trypanosomatids that do not undergo antigenic variation, such as Trypanosoma cruzi, the intracellular parasite that causes Chagas disease, and Leptomonas collosoma, a parasite of insects (Nelson et al., 1984) . These findings suggest that although the SL is used by African trypanosomes for VSG expression, it is an ancient sequence that may fulfill other more fundamental functions in gene expression in these organisms. This would predict the presence of the SL on other trypanosome transcripts as well as on VSG mRNA. To test this hypothesis we have screened cDNA libraries made from T. brucei bloodstream or procyclic RNA for clones hybrid-izing to a synthetic probe complementary to 22 nucleotides of the 35 nucleotide SL. Recombinant clones which did not encode VSG, but which contained the SL, were detected in both libraries. The expression of the corresponding genes is regulated differently from VSG genes; they are transcribed during both bloodstream and procyclic stages. As with VSG genes however, the SL is not encoded contiguously to these various structural genes, and is apparently derived from a transcript originating elsewhere in the genome. Our data suggest that rather than providing for transcriptional exclusivity in VSG gene expression, the SL plays a universal role in trypanosome gene expression.",

This RNA, of about 1.9 kb, and a putative precursor of about 4 kb (seen only upon overexposure of the autoradiogram), are not observed in procyclic RNA (lane P) nor in bloodstream-stage RNA isolated from other VATS (not shown). As previously reported (Parsons et al., 1984b) , when the same RNAs are hybridized to a probe complementary to 22 nucleotides of the 35 nucleotide SL (see Figure 2 ) a very different pattern is obtained ( Figure  IB ). Here, a smear of RNAs ranging in size from 0.5 to over 6 kb is detected in both procyclic (lane P) and bloodstream stage (lane B). In particular, a 1.9 kb species is seen in VAT 3 RNA (lane B). Ribosomal RNAs (their position indicated by the hash marks) do not hybridize to the synthetic probe. The SL-containing RNAs are not simply transcripts of the genomic 1.4 kb repeat unit in which the SL resides, as rehybridization of the same blot to a clone containing the 1.4 kb genomic repeat reveals no hybridizing RNA (not shown). Since many of the RNAs revealed by the SL probe were smaller than the mature VSG mRNA, it seemed unlikely that they represented VSG mRNA processing intermediates, We therefore hypothesized that the smear of RNAs hybridizing to the synthetic probe represents transcripts derived from other genes that also use the SL or an SL-like sequence.",

In the procyclic library of 1000 clones, 24 clones were found that hybridized with the synthetic probe. Of approximately 600 recom- binant clones in the VAT 5 library, 25 VSG-encoding cDNAs were detected, but only one of these contained 5'terminal sequences as defined by hybridization to the SL probe. Seventeen other clones also hybridized with the SL probe. By analogy with VSG transcripts, the SL should be located at the 5' terminus of transcripts giving rise to these clones. If only 5% of our cDNAs contain 5'terminal sequences (as is the case for the VSG clones), then the numbers cited above indicate that approximately half of the clones in the library are derived from transcripts containing the SL. Thus, as predicted from the Northern analyses, SL-containing transcripts are abundant in stages of the life cycle when VSG is (bloodstream) or is not (procyclic) expressed. Most of the SL-containing cDNAs were represented only once in the libraries, implying that the complexity of such transcripts is high.",

As shown in Figure 2 , each clone contained a complete or partial SL. In the case of pSLc1 and pSLc3, the SL was truncated; the cDNA clone contained 23 and 26 bp, respectively, of the 35 nucleotide SL sequence. We interpret these to be incomplete copies of their corresponding transcripts. Since the synthetic probe is complementary to the 3' portion of the SL, and since the cDNA an, probe sequences match b perfectly, these clones were easily detected by the SL probe. Clone pSLc4 contained a complete SL and, 5' to that, 3 nucleotides that correspond to those immediately 5' to the SL in the genomic repeat unit. These data suggest that sequences 5' to the SL may be transcribed, as has The sequence of the 35 nucleotide SL and the sequence of the 22 nucleotide probe complementary to the SL are shown at the top. Below are shown partial sequences of several cDNAs that hybridize to the SL probe (the SL portion is underlined). Putative reading frames are translated into amino acid sequences. The asterisk (') indicates that another 92 bp of sequence was found 5' to the SL (see text). been proposed by Boothroyd and Cross (1982) . The fourth clone, pSLc2, contained a complete and perfect SL. An additional 93 bp (indicated by an asterisk in Figure 2 ) are found 5' to the SL in this clone. Subsequent hybridization analysis suggested that this 93 bp sequence is derived from sequences within the structural gene, implying that its appearance 5' to the SL resulted from an artifact of cDNA cloning. Michiels et al. (1983) have described a VSG cDNA containing sequences 5' to the SL. The start codons of VSG mRNAs are located some 30 to 80 nucleotides downstream from the SL. We further analyzed these clones for the presence of a start codon and the existence of a possible reading frame. Our results indicate that, like the VSG leaders, these leaders are composite, containing the 5' SL followed by additional noncoding sequences. For example, the first ATG triplet is encountered 53 bp downstream from the SL in pSLc1. In pSLc3, a start codon is found 37 bp downstream from the SL, followed by a reading frame extending at least 159 nucleotides. pSLc4 contains a reading frame that starts 72 nucleotides downstream from the SL, extending at least 135 nucleotides. This region encodes a 45 amino acid polypeptide rich in basic amino acids. Thus there is no reason to suspect that these cDNAs are not derived from bona fide mRNAs since they contain protein-coding reading frames.",

It was therefore interesting to determine whether stage-specific expression was a general feature of genes that use the SL. The transcripts that correspond to several of the SLcontaining cDNAs were examined by Northern analysis of RNA isolated from the two easily obtained stages of the trypanosome life cycle: bloodstream and procyclic stages. The RNA blots shown in Figures 1A and 1 B were rehybridized with SL cDNA probes corresponding to singlecopy genes (see below). In each case one major RNA species was detected, ranging in size from 1.3 to 2.3 kb, depending on the cDNA used as probe (Figure 1, C-F DNA isolated from trypanosomes of VAT 3 (38) VAT 5 (56) or procyclic cells derived from VAT 5 (5P) was cleaved with Eco RV. Two micrograms of each sample was electrophoresed in triplicate on an agarose gel and transferred to nitrocellulose paper and hybridized with nick-translated SL cDNAs. The hash marks on the left indicate the position of DNA markers at 23 kb, 9.6 kb, 6.6 kb, 4.3 kb, and 2.3 kb. Probes were: A, VSG 5 DNA; a, pSLc2; c. pSLc5. scribed during both bloodstream and procyclic phases of the trypanosome life cycle (compare lanes P and B). One of the cDNAs isolated from the bloodstream-stage library, pSLc1, detects a transcript that appears more abundant in the bloodstream than in procyclic stage (Figure lC) , while pSLc3, isolated from the procyclic library, detects a transcript that is more abundant in procyclic RNA ( Figure  1F ). Since the SL cDNA probes had specific activities similar to that of the VSG cDNA probe, but required autoradiographic exposures some five to ten times longer, it seems that the abundance of each of these transcripts is quite low compared to that of VSG gene transcripts (Figure 1 A) .",

In addition, the expression-linked copy, as well as one other member of the VSG 5 gene family, resides on restriction fragments that show variations in size.

Figure 6 depicts several alternative arrangements of SL and structural gene exons, and their resulting primary transcripts. Sequences just upstream from the SL resemble concensus sequences of eucaryotic RNA polymerase II promoters. The large tandem array of SL repeat units has therefore been hypothesized to provide multiple promoters for frequent initiation of VSG gene transcription (DeLange et al., 1983) . However, the regulation of the transcription of the other genes whose transcripts contain the SL differs from that of VSG genes; those studied here are transcribed during both bloodstream and procyclic stages, and appear to be much less abundant than VSG mRNAs. Could all of these genes, with such different characteristics, be using the same promoter (see Figure 6A )? Recall that as with VSG genes, genomic sequences encoding the SL were not found within 3-12 kb of the structural genes encoding the SL-containing RNAs. Nor do any of these genes appear to be linked to one another. Thus if there is a single promoter used by all these genes, the primary transcription unit must be hundreds of kilobases long, provide for stage-specific and abundant transcription of the distal VSG gene (transcribed VSG genes are adjacent to a telomere), and moderate transcription of many other genes throughout the trypanosome life cycle.",

Although each of the SL repeat units appear very similar, we have detected a low level of sequence heterogeneity between repeat units (unpublished results), which might be hypothesized to allow for differences in the regulation of transcription. For example, the developmentally regulated VSG gene could be colinear with (albeit distant from) the major array of repeat units and the three to four SL orphons of our T. brucei stock could serve as promoters for other SL genes. However, there are many more than four non-VSG genes that employ the SL sequence. Even if there were several unidentified orphons or several tandem arrays, there do not appear to be sufficient unlinked SL transcription units for each gene to have its own. A combination of the two hypotheses, with several large transcription units, one colinear with developmentally regulated genes, and one colinear with constitutively expressed genes, could also be proposed.",

First, that the SL and structural gene sequences could be transcribed from separate DNA molecules, with the two RNA molecules then joined by intermolecular splicing or ligation ( Figure 6C ). Alternatively, the SL transcript could aid in the initiation of structural gene transcrip-tion ( Figure 6D ) as host RNA fragments serve as primers for transcription of influenza virus genes (Plotch et al., 1981) . Interestingly, this reaction does not require homology between primer and virus sequences. The coronavirus leader sequence has also been postulated to function as a primer in discontinuous transcription (Spaan et al., 1983) . With regard to these latter hypotheses, one would predict the presence of small SL-containing RNAs. We have recently characterized an RNA species of approximately 135 bp that hybridizes to the SL probe (Milhausen et al., submitted) .",

Although as yet no structural genes, aside from those encoding VSGs or tubulins, have been studied in trypanosomes, identification of the function of the genes employing the SL may serve to clarify its role in trypanosomatid gene expression. Alternatively, the SL may be present on virtually all trypanosome mRNAs, resulting from a requisite role in the transcription or RNAprocessing machinery of the cell. The possibility of a unique process critical to gene expression in these pathogenic organisms may provide a target for rational chemotherapy of trypanosomiasis.",

Southern analyses were performed as previously described . The final stringencres for post-hybridization washes were the same as those described above, except for VSG cDNA hybridization, which employed a 0.1X SSC, 65'C final wash. cDNAs were labeled with \"P by nick translation to a specrfic activity of approximately I@ cpm/ fig. The 22 .mer, a gift of Dr. Phillip Barr (Chiron Corporation), was labeled at its 5' end to a specific activity of approximately 5 x 106 cpm per pmole as previously described . exon whose sequence is present at the 3' ends of many different mRNAs.
