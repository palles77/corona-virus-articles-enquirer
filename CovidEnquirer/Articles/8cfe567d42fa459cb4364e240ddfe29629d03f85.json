Viruses, such as rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, or parainfluenza viruses, are the most common causative factors for asthma exacerbation [8] . In clinically stable periods of asthma, both viruses and bacteria are detected in the airways [9, 10] , but the significance of the persistent presence of those pathogens in the airways remains unclear. While the majority of studies indicate that the detection rate of respiratory viruses in patients with asthma and healthy subjects is similar [10] , they have been found to differ with regard to the bacterial composition of the airways [11] .",

Severe asthma was defined according to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) Workshop 2000 criteria [14] .

A positive result was defined as a wheal of 3 mm or more in diameter. Atopy was diagnosed as the presence of at least one positive skin test.",

The total number of positive samples and the profile of respiratory pathogens detected in the induced sputum by molecular techniques were found to be similar in elderly and non-elderly individuals. Bronchial asthma, although heterogeneous, has been considered to be, on average, more severe in the elderly population and associated with increased exacerbation rates mostly related to respiratory infections [19] . Our elderly patients tended to have, on average, more severe disease, as expressed by lower respiratory function, and less current asthma control over the previ- ous four weeks, demonstrated by GINA criteria and a lower mean ACT score. In addition, the elderly patients had higher sputum eosinophilia and lymphocytosis levels than the non-elderly patients, suggesting the presence of different types of airway inflammation in senior individuals. Although a previous study documents a tendency toward neutrophilic inflammation in the IS from elderly asthmatics, no correlation between neutrophilia and severity of the disease was found [20] . Another study found older asthmatics with fixed obstruction to have a higher percentage of eosinophils and elevated levels of ECP in the induced sputum compared to their peers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), despite an increased percentage of neutrophils in the sputum [21] . Thus, the increased percentage of eosinophils in the IS of elderly patients in our study may reflect the proposed inflammatory profile in the airway mucosa of this population of asthmatics. On the other hand, mean levels of surrogate markers of the airway eosinophilic inflammation (FeNO, ECP, and sputum periostin) were similar in both groups, not confirming differences in the type of inflammation between groups.",

In this context, the observation of similar detection rate and profile of respiratory pathogens in the induced sputum is rather unexpected. However, our patients had stable asthma during the sputum sampling, and one cannot exclude that the difference in the microbiome between elderly and non-elderly asthmatics might be seen during the disease exacerbations Although respiratory pathogens have been detected with increased frequency during asthma exacerbations, they may persist in the airways of asthmatics between exacerbation episodes, and it has been postulated that latent or persistent infection may contribute to the chronicity of the airway inflammation [22] . However, a cross-sectional study by Harju et al. [9] reports similar detection rates of respiratory viruses in the IS of patients with clinically stable asthma and healthy controls. Similarly, in a prospective study by Tucharelli et al. [23] the detection rates of 14 respiratory viruses were comparable in clinically stable asthmatics and in healthy controls at three time points. Accordingly, in non-bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), the percentage of viral detection did not vary between asthmatic children and controls [24] . In contrast, the presence of HRV in the lung tissue samples from stable patients was found to be higher in asthmatics than in healthy controls [25] . Thus, the presence or absence of respiratory pathogens in BAL or induced sputum may not reflect the persistence of infection of the airway mucosa.",

The samples were collected during late autumn and winter, which may be connected with more frequent exposure to respiratory infections. Qualitative RT-PCR did not allow active replication indicating active infection to be distinguished from residuals of viral or bacterial DNA or RNA from past infections. The discrepancies between the positivity rates of the respiratory bacteria and viruses shown in the above-mentioned studies may be related to different methods of obtaining samples and detecting pathogens. Supernatants from induced sputum were used as source material, and multiplex RT PCR assays were used for analysis. Harju et al. [9] report higher detection rates of viruses in induced sputum and throat swab samples compared to gelatine-filtered expired air, EBC, or nasal swabs. However, viral identification was not consistent between these methods or during the follow-up period. In a study by Falsey et al. [26] the identification of Bordetella pertussis in IS differed between supernatants and cells from patients with exacerbation of asthma. Hence, our results should be further confirmed in studies involving larger patient populations and, if possible, more direct airway sampling techniques.",
