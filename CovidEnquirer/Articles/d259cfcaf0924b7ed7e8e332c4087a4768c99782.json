Effect of experimentallyinduced villus atrophy on adhesion of K88ac-positive Escherichia coli in just-weaned piglets. Vet. Microbiol., Three-to four-week-old, just-weaned piglets were infected with transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus and the next day with K88ac + enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). Histological examination of caudal jejunum and ileum of piglets killed 2-3 days after virus challenge ( 1-2 days after ETEC infection) revealed severe villus atrophy especially in the jejunum compared with controls (P< 0.05). Four-5 days after TGE virus infection villus length increased and after 7 days it was near normal. Villi scraped from jejunal and ileal mucosa of the piglets were incubated in vitro with K88ac + E. coli and the number of bacteria adhering to 250 #m villus brush border was counted. Attachment of bacteria to villi of piglets killed 2-3 days after TGE virus infection was significantly decreased in comparison with adhesion to villi of non-infected piglets or of piglets killed 7 days after the virus infection. Correlation between in vitro adhesion and villus height was 0.6649 (P<0.001). The results suggest that the experimentally-induced villus atrophy was attended with a temporarily diminished susceptibility of villus enterocytes to adhesion of K88ac + E. coli.",

            "text": "Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are one of the most important causal agents of acute diarrhoeal disease in man and young animals (Morris and Sojka, 1985; Black, 1986; Taylor and Echeverria, 1986; Wilson and Francis, 1986) . ETEC strains possess long threadlike protein polymers (fimbriae) on their surface which mediate adhesion to specific membrane receptors or receptor sites on villus enterocytes of the small intestine. Specific adherence allows the ETEC strains to resist the flushing mechanism in the small intestine and to colonize the tissues (Klemm, 1985) . Children in developing countries and domestic livestock throughout the world often show a combination of ETEC and enteric viral infection (mostly rotaviruses, sometimes coronaviruses) (House, 1978; Newsome and Coney, 1985; Wilson and Francis, 1986) . This dual infection induces a more severe diarrhoea than monoinfections. In calves even synergistic effects have been reported (Hess et al., 1984) . The enteropathogenic viruses damage the small intestinal villi, resulting in villus atrophy (Moon, 1978) . Such damage can change membrane nature (Egberts et al., 1984) and might subsequently influence attachment of ETEC to enterocytes. Lecce et al. (1982) postulated that the injury caused by a rotavirus infection could alter the binding sites on villus enterocytes so that the adhesion of ETEC strains to villi is facilitated. In this communication we describe the effect on intestinal villus height during experimentally-combined infections of piglets with a coronavirus (transmissible gastroenteritis virus) and K88ac timbriae-possessing ETEC (Cox et al., 1986) and the effect of villus shortening on adhesion of K88ac E. coli to villi of piglets.",

After a starvation period of 3 h, piglets were orally infected with TGE virus (1.66 \u00d7 106 pig infective dose) on Day 4. The TGE virus was supplied by Prof. Dr. M. Pensaert (Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Ghent, Belgium). On the fifth day, again after a starvation period of 3 h, these 18 piglets were given 62 ml of a 1.4% NaHCO3 solution to neutralize gastric acidity (prevention of ETEC destruction); 15 min later each piglet was intragastrically inoculated with 10 ml bacterial suspension of strain GIS 25 and with 10 ml suspension of strain 156KP83.

Patchy to continuous attachment of coliform bacteria to villi was observed in the jejunum of 4 piglets and the ileum of 3 piglets of Group 1. In one piglet no adhesion of bacteria to jejunal and ileal villi was observed. In intestinal segments where adhesion was absent, villi were extremely short, less than 120 pm. In the other small intestinal segments, villus length was above 180 Mm. Four to five days after the TGE virus infection (3-4 days after the ETEC infection; Group 2) villi were still slightly shortened (Fig. 1 ) . Villus enterocytes were low to high columnar. A patchy bacterial adherence with irregularly arranged groups of bacteria of various sizes occurred in the jejunum of one piglet and the ileum of all 3 piglets. In piglets killed 7 days after the TGE virus infection (6 days after the ETEC infection; Group 3), villi were almost as high as in contrel piglets (Fig. 1 ) . Villus enterocytes were high columnar. No bacterial adhesion was observed. In the control group, on the contrary, multifocal adhesion of coliform bacteria was observed on villi in 2 piglets.

(1979) at 40, 72 and 144 h, respectively, after experimental infection of 3-week-old piglets with TGE virus. This suggests that villus atrophy measured in this study was primarily a result of the TGE virus infection. However, Hess et al. (1984) observed a more pronounced villous atrophy in calves simultaneously infected with ETEC and rotavirus than in calves infected with ETEC alone or with rotavirus alone, and Rose et al. ( 1987 ) proved that the STb enterotoxin is capable of causing partial villous atrophy in young pigs. So, the ETEC infection could have aggravated the virus-induced villus shortening in our experiment.",

            "text": "In Group 1, in vivo adhesion of coliform bacteria to villi was noted in histological specimens of most piglets. No adhesion, however, was observed in specimens with severe atrophic villi (smaller than 120 Bm). Since K88-positive ETEC specifically adhere to brush border membranes from genetically-susceptible pigs, this absence of in vivo adhesion on these severe shortened villi could have indicated that piglets had a non-adhesive phenotype (Bijlsma et al., 1982; Sellwood, 1983 ) . The vitro adhesion assay, however, revealed attachment of K88ac ETEC to the atrophic villi. Thus, the piglets belonged to the adhesive phenotype. Nevertheless, after the in vitro incubation of villi with K88ac E. coli, the number of bacteria adhering along 250 pm villus brush border was still significantly less in this group than in Groups 3 and C. The atrophic villi in Group 1 were covered with cuboidal to low-columnar cryptlike cells. An electron microscopic study of the ultrastructure of these cells showed a short and sometimes incomplete microvillar border (Cox et al., 1988) . As reported by Pensaert et al. (1970b) and Shepherd et al. (1979) , the cuboidal shape and the short and irregular brush border are indications of the immature nature of these enterocytes. In Group 2 (4-5 days after TGE virus infection) bacterial adhesion was again more pronounced and reached values comparable with results in Groups 3 and C. At this time villus height increased and villus enterocytes regained their normal structure. Transmission electron microscopic examination of the enterocytes of piglets in this group revealed microvilli which were longer than in Group 1 (Cox et al., 1988) . In Group 3 (piglets killed 7 days after the viral infection) villus length, villus structure and adhesion to the villi were similar to the control group. Total recovery had probably occurred. This is in accordance with the results of Shepherd et al. (1979) who observed recovery of villus structure 3-6 days after TGE virus infection. Recently we evaluated the in vitro adhesion of K88ac E. coli to villi of 5 piglets killed 2 days after an oral inoculation with the 2 ETEC strains used in this study. The number of bacteria adhering to jejunal villi (81 +_ 6 E. coli 250 zm-1 villus brush border) and to ileal villi (51 + 5 E. coli 250 zm -1 villus brush border) was the same as in Group C in this experiment (E. Cox et al., unpublished observation, 1987) , which indicates that the decreased in vitro adhesion in Group 1 was not due to a direct effect of the ETEC strains. The decreased in vitro adhesion on villi 2-3 days after TGE virus challenge was probably the reflection of a temporary change in brush border membrane receptors occurring as a result of the viral infection. The enterocytes covering the villi during the phase of cell replacement following the virus infection (Pensaert et al., 1970a (Pensaert et al., , 1970b Shepherd et al., 1979) are not fully differentiated and probably possess a decreased number of receptors or receptor sites for K88ac-positive ETEC. This is in agreement with earlier studies showing that K88-positive strains adhere to the brush border of villus enterocytes but not to the undifferentiated crypt cells (Arbuckle, 1970; Bertschinger et al., 1972; Hohmann and Wilson, 1975) .",
