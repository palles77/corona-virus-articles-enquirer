Likewise, the $30 kb genome of SARS-CoV comprises both nonstructural and structural regions. Two polyproteins (designated as pp1a and pp1ab) encoded by the viral genome undergo proteolytic processing by two proteases: a chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease (3C-like protease, 3CLpro) and a papain-like protease (PLpro), to generate functionally active proteins. Finally, the 7-8 kb RNA genome of noroviruses encodes a polyprotein that is processed by a 3C-like protease (3CLpro) to generate mature proteins. 11 Although there is high genetic diversity among these viruses, 3Cpro and 3CLpro are highly conserved, as well as essential for virus replication.",

Cyclization was subsequently accomplished using click chemistry. [32] [33] [34] [35] Thus, fragment 2 was synthesized by coupling (L) Boc-protected propargyl glycine with (L) leucine methyl ester using EDCI/HOBt/DIEA/DMF to yield the dipeptidyl ester which was subsequently treated with dry HCl in dioxane to remove the N-terminal Boc protecting group. Reaction with benzylchloroformate yielded the Cbz-protected ester which was hydrolyzed with LiOH in aqueous THF to yield the corresponding acid 2. EDCI-mediated coupling of commercially available (L) Boc-Glu-OCH 3 with NH 2 (CH 2 ) n N 3 (n = 3), followed by removal of the Boc group, yielded fragment 4. 36 The amino alkyl azide was conveniently synthesized by converting BocNH(CH 2 ) n OH to the mesylate via treatment with methanesulfonyl chloride in the presence of triethylamine, followed by reaction with sodium azide in DMF and removal of the protective group. Coupling of fragment 2 with 4 using standard coupling conditions yielded acyclic precursor 5 which was treated with Cu(I)Br/DBU in dichloromethane to furnish compound 6 in 45% yield. Compound 6 was treated with lithium borohydride to yield alcohol 7 (84% yield) which, upon Dess-Martin periodinane oxidation, 37 and subsequent purification gave macrocyclic aldehyde 8 (Scheme 1, structure (I), n = 3, Table 1 Substrate specificity of the 3C and 3C-like proteases of viruses in the picornavirus-like protease supercluster Viral 3Cpro or 3CLpro P 5 P 4 P 3 P 2 P 1 P 0 R = isobutyl, X = CHO), as a white solid. 38 The inhibitory activity of aldehyde 8 was evaluated in vitro as previously described. 16, [39] [40] [41] [42] Compound 8 displayed inhibitory activity against NV 3CLpro (IC 50 5.1 lM), enterovirus (CVB3 Nancy strain) 3Cpro (1.8 lM), and SARS-CoV 3CLpro (IC 50 15.5 lM).",

Thus, the receptor structures were prepared from the following protein data bank (PDB) crystal structures: (A) NV 3CLpro from 2IPH, 17 (B) CV 3C pro from 3ZZB, 43 and (C) SARS-CoV 3CLpro from 2ZU5. 44 These three receptor models were chosen by virtue of having cocrystallized ligands that each displayed the following three features consistent with the likely binding mode of inhibitor 8: (i) a covalent attachment to the catalytically active cysteine (analogous to the terminal aldehyde in inhibitor 8), (ii) branched alkyl, as per isobutyl group in 8, and (iii) aryl (phenylalanine or Cbz), as per Cbz in 8. This permitted the intelligent prepositioning of inhibitor 8 into each of the three protease receptors, which was accomplished in PYMOL 45 via manual docking. PYMOL was then used to produce a computational framework for refining the docked conformation as follows: a ligand-receptor complex was generated by protonating the preliminary receptor-ligand complex (according to physiological pH with anionic aspartate and glutamate residues, and cationic lysine and arginine residues), then retaining only the ligand plus all complete residues with at least one atom located within no more than 6.0 \u00c5 from any ligand atom. The resulting complex models were then permitted to undergo 1000 molecular mechanics optimization steps in Avogadro 46 using the MMFF94 force field and electrostatic charge model. 47 The resulting complexes were then rendered in PYMOL. The computational studies indicate that inhibitor 8 is capable of nestling snugly in the active site of the 3C and 3CL proteases.",
