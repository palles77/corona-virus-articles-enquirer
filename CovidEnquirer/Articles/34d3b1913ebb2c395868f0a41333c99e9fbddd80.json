It is designed to bridge the gaps between three areas of research e econometric general equilibrium modeling, international trade theory, and modern macroeconomics e by incorporating the best features of each. This chapter describes the theoretical and empirical structure of the model, summarizes its applications and contributions to the literature, and discusses two example applications in detail.",

Financial capital is perfectly mobile between sectors and from one region to another, and is driven by forward-looking investors who respond to arbitrage opportunities. Physical capital, in contrast, is perfectly immobile once it has been installed: it cannot be moved from one sector to another or from one region to another. In addition, intertemporal budget constraints are imposed on each region: all trade deficits must eventually be repaid by future trade surpluses.",

Unlike many general equilibrium models, however, G-Cubed draws on macroeconomic theory by representing saving and investment as the result of forwardlooking intertemporal optimization. Households maximize an intertemporal utility function subject to a lifetime budget constraint, which determines the level of saving, and firms choose investment to maximize the stock market value of their equity. 6 Finally, G-Cubed also draws on the macroeconomic literature by representing international capital flows as the result of intertemporal optimization, and by including liquidityconstrained agents, a transactions-based money demand equation and slow nominal wage adjustment. Unlike typical macro models, however, G-Cubed has substantial sector detail and many of its parameters are determined by estimation rather than calibration.",

Industry detail allows the model to be used to examine environmental and tax policies which tend to have their largest direct effects on small segments of the economy. Intertemporal modeling of investment and saving allows G-Cubed to trace out the transition of the economy between the short run and the long run. Slow wage adjustment and liquidityconstrained agents improves the empirical accuracy with which the model captures the transition. Overall, the model is designed to provide a bridge between computable general equilibrium models, international trade models and macroeconomic models by combining key features of each approach. The cost of this versatility is that G-Cubed is a fairly large model. It has over 10000 equations holding in each year, is typically solved annually for 100 years in each simulation, and has over 100 intertemporal costate variables. Nonetheless, it can be solved using software developed for a personal computer.",

Third, we supplemented the value added rows of the tables using a detailed dataset on capital and labor input by industry constructed by Dale Jorgenson and his colleagues. 21 Finally, we obtained prices for each good in each benchmark year from the output and employment data set constructed by the Office of Employment Projections at the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).",

From the standpoint of estimating cost and production functions, however, value added is the least satisfactory part of the benchmark input-output tables.

In all years, the techniques used by the BEA to construct implicit price deflators for labor and capital are subject to various methodological problems. One example is that the income of proprietors is not split between capital and imputed labor income correctly.

After the constants have been determined, the model will reproduce the base year exactly given the state variables inherited from 2005 and the assumed future paths of all exogenous variables. 30 One additional problem is to solve for both real and nominal interest rates consistently since the real interest rate is the nominal interest rate from the money market equilibrium less the ex ante expected inflation rate. To produce the expected inflation rate implicit in historical data for 2006 we add a constant to the equation for nominal wages in each country. 31 Finally, we are then able to construct the baseline trajectory by solving the model for each period after 2006 given any shocks to variables, shocks to information sets (announcements about future policies) or changes in initial conditions. 29 One interpretation of these constants is that they are risk premiums; another is that they are simply the residuals left between the actual data and the econometrically fitted values calculated by the model. 30 In general, these constants affect the model's steady state, but have little or no effect on the transitional dynamics. 31 One way to interpret this is as a shift in the full employment level of unemployment.

Using the model, the authors made two projections of the world economy from 1990 to 2020. The first scenario assumed that all sectors in a given region experienced a uniform rate of technical change characteristic of that region. However, the rate varied across regions based on their historical performance, with higher rates in particular developing economies such as China. The second scenario allowed technical change to be heterogeneous at the sector level. Within each region, sectoral technical change followed historical patterns, but scaled so that each economy had the same average economy-wide GDP growth rate as in the first scenario. The two scenarios produced dramatically different projections of world energy intensity by 2020. Countries had approximately the same GDP growth rates in both scenarios (by construction), but energy use was far lower in the second scenario. Sectorlevel differences in technical change caused structural changes that reduced economywide energy per unit of GDP by around 1% per year independent of any autonomous energy efficiency improvement (AEEI). This difference was purely due to the changing structure of economies over time in response to relative price changes induced by different sectoral rates of technical change. The difference was shown clearly in the carbon taxes required for stabilizing emissions: in the second scenario the taxes were typically half those for the first scenario.",

Although overall GDP growth matters, sectoral-level differences in productivity are critical for future emissions. 33 The other issue that was emphasized in this study and related studies, is that the effect of small changes in low-level growth rates over 20 or more years can have enormous effects on composition of the economy. The large range of possible outcomes from small changes in growth rates is always a sobering reminder of the degree of uncertainty underlying climate policy. In particular, there is empirical evidence to suggest that many economic variables have a unit root or a stochastic trend. If this is correct, or even approximately correct, then standard errors for projected levels of variables would quickly become large.",

An increase in the price of energy inputs makes goods produced using energy relatively more expensive in world markets. The conventional view is that the current account of a country would deteriorate as a result of a carbon tax. In McKibbin and Wilcoxen (1994) we showed on the contrary that the current account could improve if the revenue from the tax was used to reduce the fiscal deficit (i.e. holding government spending and transfers constant in spite of the rise in tax revenue). The rise in saving and fall in investment could easily lead to an improvement in the overall current account balance reflecting a capital outflow.

If the revenue is used to reduce another tax in the economy, then the costs of abatement can be reduced. For example, in the US if the revenue is used to reduce the fiscal deficit, there can be a fall in interest rates which stimulates economic growth and reduces the costs of the carbon abatement. However, this effect does not occur in a country like Australia because it is not a major participant in global capital markets and has very little impact on world interest rates. Nonetheless, using the revenue to reduce taxes on capital can help to offset the negative effects of a carbon abatement policy in Australia.",

The main problem was the extent of stabilization proposed in the scenarios, which implied very high prices for emission permits. The result was wild fluctuations in real exchange rates and consequently in patterns of international trade. This pointed to a fundamental flaw in the global emission permit trading schemes frequently proposed, such as the Kyoto Protocol. These regimes could generate large transfers of wealth between countries. Supporters of a global permit system regard this as an advantage, because it would allow developed countries to compensate developing countries for reducing their emissions. However, G-Cubed suggests that such an approach would put enormous stress on the world trade system depending on the tightness of the emission targets, the extent to which the allocation of permits was different from the permits required to meet the targets, and the marginal cost of abatement in different countries, amongst other things. A developed country importing permits would see its balance of trade deteriorate substantially. Equally serious problems would be created for developing countries. Massive exports of permits would lead to exchange rate appreciation and a decline or collapse in traditional exports. In the international economics literature this is known as the 'Dutch Disease' or in Australia as the 'Gregory Thesis'. It occurs because the granting of permits has an impact on the wealth of the receiving countries, which changes their consumption patterns and comparative advantage.",

They examine two kinds of unanticipated macroeconomic shocks under two global climate policy architectures and pay special attention to outcomes that could undermine individual countries' incentives to remain party to the global agreement. They find that a regime of fixed emissions targets strongly propagates growth shocks between regions while price-based systems do not. Under a quantity-based policy, a positive growth shock in developing countries can raise the global price of permits enough that GDP in some economies actually contracts, creating an incentive for such countries to withdraw from the arrangement. They also find that in a global downturn, a price-based system exacerbates the economic decline. Overall, quantity-based policies perform badly during unexpected economic booms and price-based policies perform badly during downturns. They argue that a hybrid policy would be superior e performing like a price-based policy during a boom and like a quantity-based policy in a downturn.",

At the time NAFTA was being evaluated, many studies suggested that it would lead to a flood of cheap goods into the US economy and a loss of jobs in the US. G-Cubed, however, showed the opposite. In these studies, the key aspect of NAFTA was not only the removal of US tariffs on Mexican goods, but the impact of the agreement on expected future productivity in Mexico and the reduction in the risk premium attached to Mexican assets by international investors. In the studies we followed the empirical link between closer economic integration and productivity growth surveyed in the case of Europe by Catinat and Italianer (1988) . The risk premium shock was based on estimates by the Congressional Budget Office (1993a) that on average investment in Mexico required roughly a 10% higher return than investments in the US. We assumed that the risk premium which drove this differential was eliminated in three years from the announcement of NAFTA. G-Cubed predicted that NAFTA would lead to a large flow of financial capital from the rest of the world into the Mexican economy in response to a rise in the expected return to capital and a reduction in the Mexican risk premium. The Mexican real exchange rate was predicted to appreciate, crowding out net exports and leading to a rise in the Mexican current account deficit. The short-term impacts of NAFTA were consistent with G-Cubed predictions. The medium to long-run predictions from G-Cubed were more consistent with the majority of studies at the time. The additional insight from G-Cubed was the short-run adjustment process was largely driven by capital flows driving trade adjustment. The model predicted a large impact from expected long-term productivity improvements, and showed how, through the operation of intertemporal forces, this stimulated shortterm capital inflows to Mexico. In the short term, this completely dwarfed the static effect (i.e. changing the composition of trade) of the tariff changes that was the focus of other studies. The scale of economies, as well as the sectoral adjustment within economies, can change significantly in dynamic models. Financial markets contain important information about absolute and relative returns to current and future activities.",

Once the liberalization is announced, the return to capital in some sectors rises and capital flows in, appreciating the real exchange rate. This further dampens demand for exported goods as they temporarily become more expensive. Liberalization by other countries at the same time can help to reduce these short-run adjustment costs and real exchange rate changes. In the long run, own reforms give larger gains than foreign reforms and there is little benefit from a policy of free riding.",

The impact of a policy change can be perverse in the short run in the sense that capital flowing into a liberalizing economy can cause such a large real exchange rate appreciation that there is a significant deterioration in the trade account as real resources flow into the economy. If the adjustment process is poorly understood, policy makers can become disaffected or can implement inappropriate policy responses such as tightening macroeconomic policy in order to improve the external balance thus slowing down economic activity. However, the capital inflows are needed to build future capacity in expanding sectors. The appreciation of the real exchange rate and worsening of the trade balance is not a loss of underlying competitiveness because of a bad policy change. The reallocation of resources is driven by the signals in financial markets of where expected returns are highest after the reforms are implemented.",

In G-Cubed the trade deficit of a country not only represents a excess of imports of goods and services over exports of goods and services. A trade deficit also reflects a excess of investment over savings in a country. Lee et al. (2006) used the model to explore the sensitivity of the trade flows between the US and Asia. They found the fundamental cause of trade imbalance since 1997 is changes in savingeinvestment gaps, attributed to the surge of the US fiscal deficits and the decline of East Asia's private investment after the 1997 financial crisis. In exploring the impact of nominal exchange rate realignment the results from G-Cubed show that a revaluation of East Asia's exchange rates by 10% (effectively a shift in monetary policy) cannot resolve the imbalances. They also found that a concerted effort by East Asian economies to stimulate aggregate demand can have significant impacts on trade balances globally, but the impact on the US trade balance is not large. US fiscal contraction was estimated to have large impacts on the US trade position overall and on the bilateral trade balances with East Asian economies. These results suggest that in order to A Global Approach to Energy and the Environment: The G-Cubed Model improve the transpacific imbalance, macroeconomic adjustment will need to be made on both sides of the Pacific.",

Macroeconomic policy issues in Japan have been examined using G-Cubed by McKibbin (2002) and Callen and McKibbin (2003) where the experience of Japan during the 1990s was captured by the model as a serious of policy errors particularly in announcing fiscal expansion and generating crowding out through asset markets, but then not delivering the fiscal spending causing a persistent downward drop in GDP; in India by McKibbin and Singh (2003) where nominal income targeting was shown to be a far better monetary regime than inflation targeting given the prevalence of supply side rather than demand-side shocks in the Indian economy; in China by McKibbin and Tang (2000) and McKibbin and Huang (2000) where financial reforms where found to have profound effects on economic growth and the balance of payments adjustment but that a loss in confidence in China could devastate economic growth; and in Asia in McKibbin and Le (2004) and McKibbin and Chanthapun (1999) where flexible exchange rate regimes were found to be far better at insulating East Asian economies against global economic shocks that pegging to either the US dollar or a common Asia currency.",

One key result in this paper is that substantial fiscal consolidation by high-income economies (in proportion to the size of their debt problem) has the temporary effect of lowering economic activity in those economies, but has a positive effect on developing countries and a few high-income economies not undertaking fiscal consolidation. The reason is that the negative flow-on effects through trade linkages by high-income economies reducing imports and stimulating exports with the developing world are offset by favorable financial flow-on effects, which provides capital for developing countries to increase GDP. Secondly a credible phasing in of fiscal cuts can reduce expected future tax liabilities of households and firms which dampens the negative direct effects of cuts in government spending. The paper also explores the outcome if all countries coordinate their fiscal adjustment except the US. A coordinated fiscal consolidation in the industrial world that is not accompanied by US actions is likely to lead to a substantial worsening of trade imbalances globally as the release of capital in fiscally contracting economies flows into the US economy, appreciates the US dollar and worsens the current account position of the US. The scale of this change is likely to be sufficient to substantially increase the probability of a trade war between the US and other economies. In order to avoid this outcome, a coordinated fiscal adjustment is clearly in the interest of the global economy.",

The model showed that although the international trade effects were negative for countries that export to Asia, the capital outflow from crisis economies would push down world interest rates and stimulate non-traded sectors of economies that were not affected by changes in risk assessment. The model suggested that a country like Australia would slow only slightly in the short run and the US would experience stronger growth as a result of the capital reallocation. This is now conventional wisdom. Furthermore, for Australia, in particular, the existence of markets outside Asia, and changes in relative competitiveness, meant that substitution was possible for Australian exports. Models with an aggregate world growth variable or a single exchange rate variable would not capture this international substitution effect. Models with exogenous balance of payments could replicate the shock, but it required an exogenous change in the trade balance and other factors that are exogenous to the model.",

Had there not been the contagion across other countries in terms of risk reappraisal, the effects would not have been as dramatic as subsequently occurred. The adverse trade effects from the US downturn would have been offset to some degree by positive effects from a global reallocation of capital. Were the US alone affected by the crisis, Chinese investment could have actually risen. The world could have escaped recession. When there is a reappraisal of risk everywhere including China, investment falls sharply e in a sense there is nowhere for the capital to go in a global crisis of confidence. The implication is that if markets, forecasters and policy makers misunderstand the effects of the crisis and mechanisms at work, they can inadvertently fuel fears of a 'meltdown' and make matters far worse.",

Hence, there is disinvestment by business and this can go on for several years e a deleveraging in the popular business media. The higher perception of risk by households causes them to discount future labor incomes at a higher risk adjusted interest rate that leads to higher savings and less consumption, fuelling the disinvestment process by business.",

These papers found that, as expected, the effects of the crisis are deeper and last longer when the reappraisal of risk by business and households is expected to be permanent versus where it is expected to be temporary. A third combination was explored in McKibbin and Stoeckel (2010b) where agents unexpectedly switch from one scenario of believing the shock to be permanent to one the temporary scenario several years later. The dynamics for 2010 are quite different between the temporary scenario and the expectation revision scenario even though the shocks are identical from 2010 onwards.",

This was observed in the actual data. This massive shift in the relationship between trade and GDP is not the result of an assumption about the income elasticity of imports. It reflects some key characteristics of the model. First, imports are modeled on a bilateral basis between countries where imports are partly for final demand by households and government and partly for intermediate inputs across the six sectors. In addition, investment is undertaken by a capital sector that uses domestic and imported goods from domestic production and imported sources. As consumption and investment collapse more than GDP, imports will contract more than GDP. One country's imports are another country's exports; thus exports will contract more than GDP unless there is a change in the trade position of a particular country. The assumption that all risk premia rise and the results that all real interest rates fall everywhere implies small changes in trade balances but big changes in the extent of trade in durable goods. As durable goods have a much bigger share in trade than in GDP the compositional shift of demand away from durable goods due to higher risk premia causes a structural change in the relationship between trade and GDP.",

This study was the first of a new approach to analyzing the macroeconomic costs of diseases through general equilibrium modeling. The key insight for policy design and investment in public health was that the short-run cost of major disease outbreaks is significant. Traditional estimates based on loss of life and income foregone estimates underestimate the costs of large-scale change in economic behavior and the spillovers between economies of disease outbreaks. The authors estimated that the cost in 2003 of SARS for the world economy as a whole was close to $40 billion, which is the official WHO estimate of the SARS outbreak.",

Based on historical experience of influenza pandemics, McKibbin and Sidorenko (2006) considered four mortality scenarios under current economic linkages in the global economy. The scenarios were: (i) a 'mild' pandemic, modeled on 1968e1969 Hong Kong Flu; (ii) a 'moderate' pandemic, modeled on the Asian Flu of 1957; (iii) a 'severe' pandemic similar to the lower estimates of mortality and morbidity in the Spanish flu of 1918e1919; and (v) an 'ultra' pandemic, modeled on high-end estimates of the Spanish Flu. These scenarios were used to generate a range of shocks to individual countries and sectors due to the pandemic (including mortality and morbidity shocks to labor force, increase in cost of doing business, an exogenous shift in consumer preferences away from exposed sectors, and a re-evaluation of country risk premiums). These shocks generate a complex response of incomes and prices driving global economic outcomes. The results illustrated that even a mild pandemic can have significant consequences for global economic output, with the developing countries experiencing the largest economic loss due to the compounding effect of a weaker public health response, capital reallocation and monetary policy responses within different exchange rate regimes. The use of a general equilibrium model that included changes in behavior of a large scale in response not only to market signals, but also changes in risk perceptions can cause a much larger economic loss that conventional estimates of pandemics imply.",

As noted above, results for this simulation are shown in the earlier figures along with those for the European financial crisis. Broadly speaking, the effects of the broader crisis on the US are much like those of the narrower crisis on Europe: the real exchange rate falls, the trade balance moves toward surplus, the real interest rate increases, and investment, consumption and GDP decline. Interestingly, however, the spread of the crisis to the US also attenuates the effects on Germany and the rest of Europe: European losses in consumption, investment and GDP are reduced relative to the case when the shock is confined to Europe. This result reflects the role of adjustment costs in capital accumulation in each sector. The US is a large economy that can absorb a lot of the capital that flows out of Europe without much being lost to adjustment costs (see equation 15.3). In contrast, when the inflow from Europe to the US is reduced by the rise in US risk, adjustment costs cause less capital to flow out of Europe. The remaining countries (other than the US and Europe) have much less capacity to absorb large inflows of additional capital without incurring rising adjustment costs from expanding their physical capital stocks. Thus, more financial capital stays within Europe under the second simulation, reducing the loss of European GDP. This result illustrates one of the benefits of intertemporal general equilibrium models that explicitly model the supply side of economies: in more traditional Keynesian macroeconomic models, this effect does not exist and demands driven by trade dominate the results for the international transmission of economic shocks. Finally, the results for China in the second simulation show the importance of assumptions about monetary policy. In G-Cubed, China is assumed to peg its nominal exchange rate to the US dollar. 37 As a result, China effectively loosens its monetary policy at the onset of the US shock in order to have its nominal exchange rate move with the US dollar. Thus, there is a substantial monetary expansion in China. Short-term interest rates fall, real consumption, investment and GDP rise sharply, and inflation spikes markedly, as shown in Figure 15 .8 (panel 4). ",

(1999) find that a worldwide cut in tariffs of 40% would raise world GDP by 0.24%. 39 However, liberalization leads to a host of indirect dynamic effects as well. These can cause profound changes in an economy by altering its rate of growth. Unfortunately, they are often very difficult to measure, particularly because competing effects can work in opposite directions. For example, reductions in tariffs cause imports to rise, pushing a country's trade balance toward deficit, leading to a depreciation of its exchange rate and a consequent increase in its exports. Deterioration of the trade balance is accompanied by inflows of capital from abroad which augment domestic saving and tend to raise the rate of investment. At the same time, the drop in tariff revenues will push the country toward fiscal deficit, raising government borrowing and tending to crowd out private investment. To further complicate matters, capital accumulation is also affected by reductions in the prices of imported durable goods, which tend to reduce the cost of new capital and thereby increase the rate of capital formation and growth. Disentangling these effects requires a multisector general intertemporal equilibrium model with considerable financial detail.",

Although this assumption is conventional, it is quite strong. It says, in effect, that a firm's technology choice is not affected by its industry's level of protection. It is hard to find any empirical support for that position and there is much evidence for the reverse: there are countless 39 Martin et al. (2003) point out that traditional general equilibrium measures of the gains from liberalization are biased downward very significantly by aggregation across goods. Tariff rates differ sharply between individual products and efficiency costs are proportional to the square of the price changes caused by the tariffs. When products are aggregated, however, their individual tariffs are replaced by a weighted average. The efficiency cost of an average tariff can be shown to be smaller than the average of the efficiency costs of the individual tariffs it replaced.",

Under the NAFTA-p simulation, tariffs are reduced to zero on trade between the US, Canada and Mexico, and industries in those three countries receive the productivity improvements listed in Table 15 .10. The FTAA-p simulation is similar to NAFTA-p, but also includes Brazil and the Rest of Latin America. In both cases, it is important to note that the productivity shocks are one-time changes in productivity levels, not changes in the rate of productivity growth. They are very modest effects in the sense that they correspond to at most 2e3 years of ordinary productivity improvements. On the other hand, Table 15 .9 Value of trade flows between regions in the reference case: column shows source and row they do not include the effect of any adjustment costs or investment that might arise as the protected industries adapt. Thus, they allow us to gauge the importance of productivity changes over the medium to long run but are not a precise prediction. Table 15 .11 shows the effect of NAFTA-p on output, exports and capital stocks by sector and region in year 12. The results are percentage changes relative to the reference case. Entries with changes greater than or equal to 1% in magnitude are given in italics and those with changes less than 0.1% in magnitude are left blank. As would be expected, the reduction in tariffs leads to an increase in trade among NAFTA countries. Exports from the US, Canada and Mexico increase significantly. Exports of durables (panel 2) rise by 2.4% in the US, 6.9% in Canada and 8.6% in Mexico. Exports of non-durables increase even more because tariffs on non-durables are initially higher and hence fall more dramatically under a free trade agreement (the high tariffs on non-durables largely reflects the high levels of protection on textiles and apparel). Exports of non-durables rise by 5.3% in the US, 18.5% in Canada and 11.9% in Mexico. The increase in trade raises the level of output of all industries in the US (panel 1), albeit by very small percentages in most cases. The corresponding capital stocks rise as well (panel 3). The output of almost all Canadian industries increases, as does the output of most Mexican industries. A notable exception is services (sector C) for both Canada and Mexico: output of services falls under NAFTA-p even though exports of services rise slightly in percentage terms due to the change in exchange rates (as well as increased demand for services in other countries that expand as a result of the policy). The reason is straightforward: the price of services rises, in part because the traded sectors grow and consume more labor, and in part because depreciation of the exchange rate raises the price of imported intermediate goods other than those whose tariffs have been cut. This effect is a recurring theme in the results and can be seen clearly in Figure 15 .9, which shows percentage changes from the reference case in selected industry prices and quantities over time for the US, Canada and Mexico.",

The trade balances for Brazil and the Rest of Latin America (as well as most other regions, although they are omitted from the graph) move toward surplus as imports by the US, Canada and Mexico rise.

The results are percentage changes relative to the NAFTA-p simulation; as before, entries with changes greater than or equal to 1% in magnitude are given in italics and those below 0.1% are left blank. The general nature of the results is highly analogous to those for NAFTA-p: the effect of the FTAA on Brazil (I) and the rest of Latin America (V) is very much like the effect of NAFTA-p on Canada and Mexico. The main difference is that the percentage changes tend to be larger in magnitude for Brazil and the Rest of Latin America. For most industries, output, exports and capital stocks all increase substantially. This can be seen graphically in Figure 15 .11, which shows the effects of FTAA-p relative to NAFTA-p on selected industry prices and output for all regions. In general, prices fall significantly in Brazil and the Rest of Latin America, and output rises accordingly. As with NAFTA-p relative to the reference case, service sector output falls in Brazil and the Rest of Latin America; however, the magnitude is relatively small. The value of trade flows between aggregate regions is shown in Table 15 .12 above. The most notable result is a pronounced decline in imports of durables from non- ",

To distinguish it from the previous FTAA simulation, this version will be denoted FTAA5-p where the '5' indicates that implementation of the agreement is anticipated 5 years in advance. The effects of the anticipated FTAA will be equal to the differences between the FTAA5-p simulation and a counterfactual NAFTA simulation, NAFTA5-p, in which NAFTA was announced 5 years before its implementation. 48 When the FTAA is announced in advance, Figure 15 .13 shows that very large anticipatory changes occur in exchange rates, trade accounts and macroeconomic variables. The key mechanism by which this occurs is the real exchange rate, which can be shown to be the price to foreigners of a given country's domestic assets. When the FTAA is implemented, real exchange rates for Brazil and the Rest of Latin America will drop sharply for the reasons discussed in the previous section. Investors anticipating the fall will be less willing to hold Brazilian and Latin American assets in advance, even at the beginning of the simulation. As a result, exchange rates for Brazil and Latin America deteriorate immediately. Financial capital flows out of those regions and into the US and other large economies, whose trade balances deteriorate as a result. Investment, labor demand, GDP and consumption all decline in Brazil and the Rest of Latin America 48 This approach is used for the same reason that other FTAA simulations are compared to analogous NAFTA runs: the model's internal structure does not currently allow the size of a free trade area to change in the middle of a simulation. In the two simulations discussed in this section, either NAFTA or the FTAA is adopted immediately but remains dormant for 5 years. During that time, tariffs on imports from trade area partners remain the same as tariffs on other imports. This approximates an anticipated introduction of the FTAA.",

Countries reducing their tariffs see imports rise, exchange rates fall, trade balances move toward deficit, capital inflows increase and foreign debt levels rise. Trade increases significantly between member countries and the largest changes arise in the most heavily traded sectors: durables and non-durables. The effects are most pronounced for non-durables because the initial tariffs are highest. Liberalization is good for importers and exporters, as would be expected. Non-traded sectors, particularly services, are hurt by the expansion of exporting industries which draw in labor and raise wages (even though, in percentage terms, exports of services rise slightly). For several of the FTAA countries the agreement would have a significant fiscal impact by reducing an importance source of government revenue. Unless another tax is increased to compensate for the reduction in tariff revenue, the FTAA raises the country's fiscal deficit. providing a short-term stimulus but crowding out some private investment in the long run.",

In addition, productivity effects tend to reduce the changes in trade flows caused by liberalization because the difference in relative prices between foreign and domestic goods is smaller. This effect is particularly noticeable with durables imported by Brazil and the rest of Latin America. The FTAA and NAFTA are not analogous in one respect. NAFTA increases overall trade rather than just redirecting it away from non-NAFTA countries. The effect of the FTAA, however, is closer to trade redirection than to trade creation. The difference stems from the relative effects of the agreements on the US. NAFTA does more to stimulate the US economy and thus has a larger effect on the US demand for imports.",

A second project, also underway, is further disaggregation of the energy sectors, which will allow analysis of a wider range of primary energy inputs will include explicit treatment of alternative energy generation technologies. A third project focuses on the role of infrastructure. This is particularly important for better understanding the determinants of economic growth especially in developing countries. It will also be critical when using the model to evaluate large fiscal consolidation programs in heavily indebted industrial economies over future years. A fourth area where more work is underway is improved estimation of G-Cubed's dynamic adjustment parameters. Although many of the intratemporal parameters of the model are estimated, the key dynamic parameters are largely calibrated. A number of alternative approaches are possible to improve this. Perhaps the most attractive, particularly in adapting the core model to be used as a forecasting tool is to further develop the approach in Pagan et al. (1998) . In that approach, the impulse response functions from G-Cubed are combined with vector autoregression techniques on a time series data set. The result is a dynamic system with the medium-and long-term properties of G-Cubed as well as the dynamics found in high frequency macro data.",

Integrating the flows of capital and goods, together with explicit modeling of the demand and supply sides of economies, fundamentally changes the nature of the international transmission of macroeconomic shocks. The model's results offer an explanation of the puzzle of 'delinking' of trade and financial flows often discussed in the popular press. When both flows are incorporated in a model, as they are in G-Cubed, it is clear that the details of a shock's effects on trade and financial flows are pivotal in determining the outcome of the transmission process. Real versus financial shocks can affect trade and finance differently and hence there need not be anything mysterious about changes in the comovements of the GDP of countries over time when the nature of the macroeconomic shocks they face changes. For example, our results in this section show that nominal rigidities, such as pegging a nominal exchange rate, can have significant shortterm real consequences during the adjustment period.",
