Previous studies on the related severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) FP have shown that calcium (Ca 2+ ) plays an important role for fusogenic activity via a Ca 2+ binding pocket with conserved glutamic acid (E) and aspartic acid (D) residues. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV FP share a high sequence homology and here, we investigated whether Ca 2+ is required for MERS-CoV fusion by substituting E and D residues in the MERS-CoV FP with neutrally charged alanines. Upon verifying mutant cell surface expression and proteolytic cleavage, we tested the mutants ability to mediate infection of pseudoparticles (PPs) on host cells without and with Ca 2+ . Our results demonstrate that intracellular Ca 2+ enhances MERS-CoV WT PPs infection by approximately two-fold and that E891 is a crucial residue for Ca 2+ interaction. Electron spin resonance revealed that this enhancement could be attributed to Ca 2+ increasing MERS-CoV FP fusion-relevant membrane ordering. Intriguingly, isothermal calorimetry titration showed that MERS-CoV FP binds one Ca 2+ , as opposed to SARS-CoV FP which binds two. Our data suggests that there are significant differences in FP-Ca 2+ interactions of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV FP despite their high sequence similarity and that the number of Ca 2+ ions interacting with the FP has implications on the fusion dynamics of the virus.",

Although transmissions between humans is rare, this route was responsible for a widespread outbreak of MERS-CoV in 2015 in South Korea [6] . Moreover, it was demonstrated that MERS-like bat CoV could potentially infect human tissues in the absence of an intermediate host when the respective tissue expresses a protease that is able to prime the virus for fusion [7] . More recently, the World Health Organization (WHO) listed MERS-CoV as one of ten diseases that requires urgent accelerated research and development because of its potential to cause a public health emergency with few or no efficacious drugs and/or vaccines to counter them [8] . To address these needs, it is important to have a more nuanced understanding of MERS-CoV infection process to develop therapeutics to target crucial steps in MERS-CoV infection.",

To mediate fusion with the host cell membrane, S needs to be cleaved by either host cell surface proteases or endosomal proteases (such as transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2), furin, or cathepsins) [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Cleavage can occur at two different sites: the S1 and S2 boundary (S1/S2), and adjacent to a fusion peptide (FP) within the S2 domain (S2') [17, 18] . It is suggested that both cleavage events act in concert to promote membrane fusion and viral infectivity. The first cleavage event takes place at the S1/S2 site, which then is believed to open up the S2' site for further proteolytic processing, resulting in the exposure of the FP. As a consequence, the FP inserts into the host membrane, mediating membrane fusion [19] .",

The authors showed that both FP1 and FP2 increase membrane ordering and proposed that FP1 and FP2 together form an extended FP which acts as a bipartite fusion platform. Intriguingly, both FP subdomains required calcium cations (Ca 2+ ) to exert their function in membrane entry and fusion. It was proposed that negatively charged aspartic acid (D) and glutamic acid (E) residues coordinate with the positively charged Ca 2+ within the fusion platform to promote greater membrane ordering. Furthermore, the authors showed that depletion of extracellular as well as intracellular Ca 2+ pools resulted in significantly reduced infectivity of SARS-CoV pseudo-particles, suggesting that both the plasma membrane and endosomal cell entry pathways are regulated by Ca 2+ .",

With all mutant S proteins expressed, we next wanted to investigate whether the mutants exhibit the same cleavage pattern as WT S since proteolytic cleavage is an important and crucial trigger for viral fusion.

Therefore, we co-expressed the S protein together with MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 in Vero cells for 18 h and visualized syncytia formation using an immunofluorescence assay (IFA). Trypsin treatment of transfected cells was not required as the cells natively express proteases that cleave WT and mutated S proteins for cell-cell fusion. As a control, we added the protease inhibitor dec-RVKR-CMK to cells expressing WT S to prevent S cleavage and block MERS-CoV entry [27] . We analyzed the cells by fluorescence microscopy and quantified cell-cell fusion by counting the number of nuclei per syncytium. Cells expressing WT S exhibited strong syncytia formation with multiple nuclei and addition of dec-RVKR-CMK as a control efficiently prevented cell-cell fusion ( Figure 3A and B). Strikingly, in the absence of the inhibitor, the E891A and E891A/D892A mutants were impaired in their ability to trigger cell-cell fusion to the same extent as cells treated with dec-RVKR-CMK ( Figure 3A and B). However, since the cells expressing D892A formed syncytia similar to that of cells expressing WT S, this suggests that E891 is a critical residue for the fusogenic activity of MERS-CoV S and was responsible for the E891A/D892A mutant's inability to mediate cell-cell fusion. All other tested mutants showed attenuated cell-cell fusion at various degrees, however, none of the mutants was found to be as defective as the E891A S protein in mediating cell-cell fusion ( Figure 3A and B).",

In addition, we also observed that infectivity of PPs carrying D911A was significantly lower than WT S PPs.

Since we hypothesized that E891 is a critical residue in Ca 2+ coordination, we would have expected its knockout variant, E891A, to have infectivity levels that are independent of Ca 2+ concentrations. However, the intracellular Ca 2+ studies show that single mutant E891A is impacted by Ca 2+ . A possible explanation for this apparent contradiction could be due to the FP flexibility. Perhaps if E891 is not available for Ca 2+ binding, the adjacent D892 can compensate for E891 and maintain Ca 2+ coordination in the FP. In support of this explanation is that the infectivity of the E891A/D892A double mutant is Ca 2+ independent, as both possible residues that can mediate Ca 2+ interactions have been knocked out. Thus, we believe that E891 does mediate Ca 2+ binding in the MERS-CoV FP1 region. However, previous studies with RuV and EBOV showed that two distinct opposing residues in the FP region are required to coordinate Ca 2+ [25, 26] , and so we proceeded to determine the other residues that Ca 2+ can coordinate with.",

We confirmed that all three mutated proteins are expressed and trafficked to the plasma membrane in 293T cells as proteins were extracted by cell-surface biotinylation ( Figure 2C ). The IFA results show that cells expressing E891A/D896A, E891A/D902A, and E891A/D896A/D902A are impaired in their ability to form syncytia to a similar extent as the cells expressing WT S treated with dec-RVKR-CMK or the E891A single mutant ( Figure   3A and B). However, when we assessed protein incorporation into PPs, we found that WT and E891A/D896A PPs carried similar amounts of protein, but the protein incorporation in E891A/D902A and the E891A/D896A/D902A PPs was significantly reduced ( Figure 4 ). When cells were infected with PPs equipped with the S mutations, we found that infectivity of E891A/D896A was similar to the E891A single mutant ( Figure 6A ). Infectivity of E891A/D902A, however, was significantly lower compared to E891A and E891A/D896A. PPs carrying the E891A/D896A/D902A S protein were not infectious. These findings are consistent with the results of the PP Western blot analysis since they incorporate significantly less S protein, which most likely results in reduced entry.

This method proved to be a solid approach to single out the effect of FP under the influence of Ca 2+ in a complex membrane-peptide-Ca 2+ system [24, 26] . As shown in indicating that Ca 2+ ions bind to the SARS-CoV FP more cooperatively than to MERS-CoV FP. For the SARS-CoV FP case, an explanation for this cooperativity is that the SARS-CoV FP has two Ca 2+ binding sites, and binding a Ca 2+ ion in one site will stabilize the secondary structure and help to bind another Ca 2+ ion in the other site. The lack of cooperativity in the case of the MERS-CoV FP suggests that it may have only one binding site.",

After the subtraction of dilution heat, which is measured by titrating 1 ml CaCl2 into the pH 7 buffer, the reaction heat between the Ca 2+ and the FP for each injection vs. the molar ratio of Ca 2+ to FP was plotted. As shown in Figure 7D , the reaction heats are positive, indicating the reaction is endothermic. The reaction heats decrease during the titration, indicating the FPs have been saturated by the Ca 2+ ions toward the end of the titration. The reason for the endothermic reaction may be due to the Na + ions interacting with the FPs were replaced by the Ca 2+ ions. The endothermic reactions were also observed when we injected CaCl2 into the SARS CoV FP in a similar experimental setup [24] . Fitting the data with the one-site model, which assumes all binding site(s) have the same binding affinity, we calculated the binding constant Kb=1.14\u00b10.23 \u00d7104 M -1 , the reaction enthalpy \u0394H= 3.12 \u00b1 0.45 kCal/Mol and the binding stoichiometry (Ca 2+ to the FP) n=1.12\u00b10.08. The stoichiometry of the Ca 2+ to the MERS-CoV FP is significantly different from that for the FP1_2 of SARS-CoV FP (n=1.7) and similar to FP1 or FP2 of the SARS-CoV FP (n=0.92 and 1.02, respectively) [24] . The results strongly support the hypothesis that the MERS-CoV FP only binds one Ca 2+ ion, while the SARS-CoV FP binds two, one on FP1 and one on FP2. The weaker Ca 2+ binding energies of the MERS-CoV FP is also consistent with the ESR results, which shows that the MERS-CoV FP induces a maximal membrane ordering effect in a higher Ca 2+ concentration than the SARS-CoV FP.",

There seem to be significant differences regarding the role of Ca 2+ in mediating viral host cell membrane fusion. Studies showed that Ca 2+ does not bind to the FPs of influenza A or HIV-1 during the fusion event. Our prior observations of influenza fusion protein, which does not show increased membrane interaction in the presence of Ca 2+ [24] , indicate that Ca 2+ does not act as a blanket promoter of viral FP insertion into target membranes. [24] . In the case of HIV this leads to structural changes of the FP, which forms an \u03b1-helix in the absence of Ca 2+ , but changes conformation to an antiparallel \u03b2-sheet structure in the presence of Ca 2+ [35] . However, it is important to note, that while Ca 2+ enhances fusion for the above-mentioned viruses it is attenuated in its absence, but not abrogated. In contrast, Ca 2+ directly interacts with the FPs of RuV, SARS-CoV, and EBOV and depletion of Ca 2+ results in the incapability of the virus to fuse with the host cell [24] [25] [26] . For both RuV and EBOV, key residues within the FP were identified that coordinate with the Ca 2+ , and in concert with low pH, resulted in conformational changes of the FP and subsequent fusion.

However, although the S-shaped curve of the MERS-CoV FP is similar to the SARS-CoV FP, MERS-CoV FP has a smaller membrane order effect than SARS-CoV FP and at 1.0 mM Ca 2+ , the membrane ordering effect is saturated by a higher P/L ratio of MERS-CoV FP than SARS-CoV FP ( Figure 7A and 7B) . By keeping the P/L ratio constant at 1%, the MERS-CoV FP is also saturated at a higher concentration of Ca 2+ (increase to half of its maximal at around 1.5 mM, compared to around 0.5 mM for SARS-CoV FP, Figure 7C ). Those results suggest that the MERS-CoV FP has a weaker interaction with Ca 2+ and thus require higher Ca 2+ concentration reach its maximal activity. This hypothesis .

The ITC experiments also demonstrate that the stoichiometry of Ca 2+ to the MERS-CoV FP is close to one (1.15) . This is different to the SARS-CoV case, in which SARS-CoV binds two Ca 2+ in its FP region, one in each FP1 and FP2 [24] . We interpret this to indicate that one Ca 2+ interacts with the MERS-CoV FP.",

            "text": "In the biological scenario, a possible explanation for the differences might be that Ca 2+ primes the FP for different steps in the host cell entry process. For SARS-CoV, extracellular Ca 2+ binding through the FP2 domain may prepare the fusion loop for subsequent intracellular Ca 2+ in the FP1. For MERS-CoV, the extracellular Ca 2+ binding step may not be required as none of the tested mutants in the FP2 region showed a striking reduction on infectivity whereas intracellular Ca 2+ depletion significantly reduced infectivity. Future studies will be designed to explore how swapping different residues or entire regions between MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV FP would impact membrane fusion, entry pathways, and calcium interactions. It would be interesting to see if MERS-CoV will adopt SARS-CoV fusion behavior and vice versa. Different cell types, however, could also affect the fusion behavior of both viruses. Previous studies explored the fusion dynamics of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV PP using Vero E6 cells [24, 38] while we and others used Huh-7 cells to study MERS-CoV PP infections which exhibit a higher expression of furin and DPP4 and seem to promote entry mainly via the endocytic route [16, 39] . Addressing the impact of the cell type on the fusion dynamics of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV will complement our studies on the FP domains of the two viruses.",

The mixture was evacuated in a vacuum drier overnight to remove any trace of chloroform. To prepare MLVs, the lipids were resuspended and fully hydrated using 1 mL of pH 7 or pH 5 buffer (5 mM HEPES, 10 mM MES, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7 or pH 5) at room temperature (RT) for 2 hours. To prepare SUVs, the lipids were resuspended in pH 7 or pH 5 buffer and sonicated in an ice bath for 20 minutes or when the suspension became clear. The SUVs solution was then further clarified by ultracentrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. Isothermal Titration Calorimetry (ITC) ITC experiments were performed in an N-ITC III calorimeter (TA Instrument, New Castle, DE). A total 97 \u00b5L of 1 mM CaCl2 in pH 7 fusion buffer was injected into 1 ml 0.05 mM FPs in pH 7 fusion buffer at 37\u00b0C in a stepwise manner consisting of 5 \u00b5L per injection except that the first injection was 2 \u03bcL. The injection time was 15 sec for each injection and the interval time was 10 min. The data were analyzed with Origin (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA). The one-site model was used in the fitting to calculate the thermodynamic parameters. The protein concentration is determined by dry weight and UV spectroscopy.",
