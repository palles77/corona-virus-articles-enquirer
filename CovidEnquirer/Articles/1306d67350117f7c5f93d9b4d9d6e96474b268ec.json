            "text": "It is now well recognized that Autographa califmica nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcNPV), the type species of subgroup A baculoviruses, generates two separate phenotypes during the course of infection (Faulkner, 1981) . These two phenotypes appear to have specific roles in the persistence of the virus in nature. The occluded form (OV), which gains its envelope in the nucleus before being incorporated into the polyhedral protein matrix, is thought to be responsible for the transmission of infection from one larva to the next. The polyhedra, released into the environment by the liquification of infected, diseased insects, are ingested by susceptable larvae and are dissolved by the alkaline pH of the midgut juices. The occluded virions, thereby released into the gut lumen, are freed to infect the midgut cells. The second phenotype, the budded virus (BV), gains its envelope by budding through the plasma membrane of infected cells. This form is thought to be responsible for transmitting infection from one tissue to another within an infected insect.",

            "text": "Larvae-grown occluded virions can be artificially released from polyhedra in the laboratory by exposure to alkali. This larvae-occluded virus, alkali liberated (LOVAL) has been compared to BV and has been found to be different morphologically, biologically, and biochemically (Volkman, 1983) , even though the genomes of the two phenotypes have been shown to be the same by restriction endonuclease analysis (Smith and Summers, 1978) . Germane to this report are the observations that BV possesses polar peplomers while LOVAL does not (Adams et ak, 1977) . Differences in infectivity have also been documented; BV is much more highly infectious in the hemocoel than in the gut (1 X 105-fold greater), while LOVAL is three times more highly infectious in the gut than in the hemocoel. In cell culture, BV is about 1.88 X lo3 times more infectious than LOVAL (Volkman and Summers, 1977) . A third observation pertinent to this report is that BV and LOVAL are neutralized by different populations of anti-bodies (Volkman et ah, 1976) . The availability of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody of the BV phenotype of AcNPV (Hohmann and Faulkner, 1983) afforded the opportunity to further compare the LOVAL and BV phenotypes with regard to their reaction with this antibody, and to identify the BV antigen recognized by the antibody. Results of this investigation revealed that the antibody did not recognize the LOVAL phenotype at all, but reacted with surface antigens on infected cells in the prepolyhedra stage of cytopathic effect (CPE) (Volkman and Summers, 19'75) , the period of active virus budding (Volkman et ah, 1976) . The BV antigen(s) recognized was a glycoprotein incorporated throughout the BV envelope, but was more concentrated at the end of the virus containing peplomers. Four glycoproteins of molecular weights 127,000, 64,000, 59,000, and 49,000 were identified by the immunoprecipitation of solubilized radiolabeled BV structural proteins with the neutralizing monoclonal antibody. The relationship of these proteins to one another has yet to be established.",

There was a notable lack of staining in the nuclei of infected cells. Figures 4,5, and 6 show electron micrographs of infected and uninfected cells exposed to DMEM with or without AcVl. Cell surface staining was evident in infected cells, although staining intensity varied from regions where it was undetectable to areas of very heavy staining (Fig. 4C) . Electronmicrographs of higher magnification revealed that relatively heavy staining was correlated with regions of concentrated virus budding (Fig. 5C ). Higher concentrations of AcVl also resulted in the heavy staining of regions of virus budding (Fig. 5D ). Staining in areas of relatively low budding activity with the appropriate dilution of antibody revealed that the target antigen was a component of the plasma membrane before any association with viral nucleocapsid was apparent (Fig. 6) . As nucleocapsids approached the plasma membrane, however, the antigen appeared to become concentrated at the site of initial contact, the location where peplomers form (Figs. 6A, B , D) (Adams et aL, 1977) . Although staining was more intense at the peplomer end of the BV envelope, it could be detected all around the virion envelope (Fig. 6C) . precipitated, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Four proteins of different molecular weights were consistently precipitated in several experiments, with the most heavily labeled one being approximately 64,000, one of intermediate intensity at approximately 49,000, and two minor bands at 127,000 and 59,000 (Fig. 7) . All four were labeled with both radioactive methionine and acetyl-glucosamine (Figs. 7A, C). Minor bands of molecular weights less than 49,000 were also obtained, but the molecular weights and the intensity of the bands were variable from experiment to experiment. Treatment of cells with 5 pg/ ml tunicamycin, an inhibitor of N-asparagine-linked glycosylation (Klenk and Rott, 1980) , resulted in the precipitation of no acetyl-glucosamine-labeled proteins (Fig.  7D) , and only a 59,000-molecular weight methionine-labeled protein (Fig. 7B) . Pel-leted BV from tunicamycin-treated infected cultures was negatively stained and viewed by electron microscopy to confirm its presence in those preparations (not shown). Processing of control samples from labeled uninfected cells with and without tunicamycin resulted in the precipitation of no labeled proteins (not shown).",

            "text": "The presence of glycoproteins on the surface is a common property of enveloped animal viruses (Choppin and Sheid, 1980) . In most enveloped viruses, the glycoproteins are present in the form of peplomers and are functional in the early interactions of the virus and host cell; either in the initial adsorption and attachment to the cell, and/or in the subsequent penetration of the cell (Choppin and Sheid, 1980; Klenk and Rott, 1980) . Adsorption of a given virus often requires interaction with a specific receptor, thus peplomers potentially play an important role in the specificity of infection. Enveloped virus peplomers are usually composed of several glycoprotein molecules, either the same molecular spe- ties or different fragments that arise by proteolytic cleavage of a common precursor. Some viruses have only one type of peplomer, while others possess two types, each formed by different glycoprotein species (Klenk and Rott, 1980) . Commonly it is the viral glycoprotein that is the target of neutralizing antibodies. Immunoprecipitation of radiolabeled BV structural proteins with the neutralizing monoclonal antibody AcVr yielded four bands of different molecular weights when analyzed under reducing conditions by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. The fact that the same banding pattern was obtained when the precipitated BV proteins were labeled with N-acetyl-D-[l-3H]glucosamine as with r5S]methionine indicated all the proteins involved were glycoproteins. The addition of tunicamycin, as expected, blocked the glycosylation of the proteins in question. These results indicated that the oligosaccharides were N-linked rather than O-linked. Although recently O-linkages have been reported in some viral glycoproteins (Stern and Sefton, 1982; Zezulak and Spear, 1983) , the majority reported so far have been N linkages (Klenk and Rott, 1980) . When tunicamycin was used in conjunction with the methionine label, a protein of molecular weight 59,000 was immunoprecipitated. Whether or not BVP 59 is a slightly glycosylated version of this same protein remains to be determined. Stiles et al. (1983) reported that treatment of AcNPV-infected TN-368 cells with 5 pg/ml tunicamycin resulted in a 99% reduction in BV titer, while it had no effect on the infectivity of OV. These results are consistent with our observations that this tunicamycin-sensitive glycoprotein is critical to the infectivity of BV, but is not a component of LOVAL.",

Certainly, further experimentation is required to determine which (if any) of the above listed explanations most closely approximates the situation, but the hypothesis that the BV epitope in question is dependent upon the association of at least two proteins (or peptide chains) is consistent with information collected over several years of experimentation. BVP 64 is one of the major proteins of AcNPV BV (Smith and Summers, 1978) and though LOVAL contains a structural protein of the same molecular weight, the BV protein is considerably more abundant. BVP 64 is the major structural protein precipitated by AcVl, but antiserum made to electrophoretically purified BVP 64 does not neutralize BV (not shown). Further, antiserum made to AcNPV LOVAL will react with BVP 64, (Volkman, 1983 ) but will not neutralize BV (Volkman et al, 1976) . Additionally, AcVl reactivity with BV (as demonstrated by ELISA) is destroyed if the BV antigen is first boiled with the standard Laemmli SDS-PAGE sample buffer as is customary before gel analysis (unpublished results). The loss of reactivity by this treatment explains the lack of activity obtained by Hohmann and Faulkner (1983) in their Western blot anaylsis of BV with AcVl.",

Adams et ah (1977) , after having reviewed numerous electron micrographs of in vivo and in vitro budding baculoviruses, described the plasma membranes of infected cells as having a \"spiny coat\" appearance (to various degrees) in areas where no peplomers were seen. Since most enveloped-virus glycoproteins are present at the surface in the form of spikes (Klenk and Rott, 1980) , it is speculated that these antigens may be components of the spines and peplomers observed in the BV envelope (Adams et al., 1977) . Whether or not this is true, and whether the same proteins are components of both the spines and peplomers remains to be determined.",

Since antiserum to LOVAL does not neutralize BV (Volkman et al., 1976) , it also was not surprising that the target epitope of the neutralizing antibody AcV, was absent altogether from LOVAL, as indicated by both ELISA and the absence of immunoperoxidase staining of infected cell nuclei in acetone-fixed cells. It may be that this difference in glycoproteins is responsible for the difference in infectivity and specificity of the two phenotypes.",
