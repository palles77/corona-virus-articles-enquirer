In addition the particulates can act as vehicles for transport of noxious molecules deep into the lungs. There are few fire studies investigating irritants, and organo-irritants which have sub-lethal health effects. Little has been done to investigate fire generated particles, their morphology, size distribution and chemical composition as the particle size distribution is dependent not only on the material, but also on the temperature and fire conditions (such as residence time in the flame).",

Similar to PAHs and major fire gas toxicant yields, the ratio of PCDD/F formation in the gas phase depends strongly on a number of variables, such as the combustion conditions (variations in temperature, ventilation, residence time in flame, and oxygen environments), as well as varying concentrations of precursors and chlorine in the product gases (Ruokoj\u00e4rvi et al., 2000) . In terms of PCDDs and PCDFs relevance to health, numerous studies using animals have confirmed that some dioxin isomers are carcinogenic and produce mutagenic effects in certain species (Van den Berg et al., 2006) . This paper present results from samples of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) based carpet. A full description of the project can be found elsewhere (Blomqvist et al., 2010) . The major fire species found and investigated, under different fire conditions, were carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), hydrogen chloride (HCl), PAHs, and PCDDs/PCDDFs from residue samples. The distribution patterns between gas and particle phase, and different size-ranges of particles produced in fires, together with their chemical composition, were also examined.",

From the elemental analysis, the maximum possible yield for HCl is 0.3 g g \u00c01 and for CO 2 is 1.42 g g \u00c01 . This means that the recovery of chlorine as HCl was around 95% in these tests. The high yield (i.e. greater than theoretically possible) of HCl in the pyrolysis experiments can be explained by the fact that chlorine is degraded and emitted as HCl at a lower temperature compared to the thermal degradation of the hydrocarbon backbone of the PVC material (Stec and Hull, 2010) . In the oxidative pyrolysis tests, where material is degraded without flames, lower yields for all fire gases are found.",

For all three combustion conditions studied, the maximum chlorine content is found in the soot from the impactor plate that captured the highest amounts of particles. There is no significant difference between the well-ventilated and the under-ventilated tests. The chlorine content found in the pyrolysis test is, however, generally somewhat lower. Fig. 3 presents a comparison of the chlorine content found on the soot samples from the cascade impactor plates (filters 1-8) and from the filter (based on gravimetric measurements). Differences, especially for oxidative pyrolysis, could be explained by limitations in the analysis methods where XRF results are influenced by the thickness of the soot layer or by a variation of the chlorine concentration across the filter surface and the choice of specific measurement point. However, the XRF was calibrated and triplicate analysis was made at different locations of the filter for each sample analysed. Fig. 4 shows how the chlorine content in the residues varies with position along the boat for all reaction conditions. This equates to the time the sample was exposed to radiant heat in the furnace. Thus at 10 cm sample length, for the under-ventilated fire scenario, had been subjected to 825\u00b0C for at least 10 min, while the 65 cm sample length would probably not have reached 650\u00b0C. Chlorine measurements were taken every 10 cm and compared for different fire scenarios. Results show that for oxidative pyrolysis there is found much higher chlorine content ($18-20 wt.%) than in flaming conditions ($10 wt.%).",

Fig. 5 compares concentrations of all toxic congeners, expressed per g of ash (residue remaining after the test). These are averages based on three repeated experiments for each set of conditions as described in Table A.1. PCDD/F toxicity can be expressed by a single number as the International Toxic Equivalent (I-TEQ). It is based on a Toxic Equivalent Factor (TEF) method which indicates the degree of the less toxic dioxins and furans as fractions of the toxicity of the most toxic 2,3,7,8-TCDD which is given as a reference value of 1 (Van den Berg et al., 2006) . I-TEQ concentrations of PCDD/F in PVC carpet residue correspond to 21 \u00b1 5, 18 \u00b1 6 and 174 \u00b1 192 pg I-TEQ/g of burned material for oxidative pyrolysis, well-ventilated and under-ventilated conditions, respectively. The errors denote one standard deviation. There are noticeable variations among repeated experiments, especially for under-ventilated conditions (respectively, 95, 394 and 35 ng I-TEQ/g burned material). This variation may be explained by different heating histories experienced by segments of the sample. Only about half of each sample reached the target temperature, with the temperature experienced by the end of the sample being approximately 200-300\u00b0C lower.

It seems that the PCDD/F toxicity of PVC residues do not depend strongly on fire condition, provided that temperature does not exceed 650\u00b0C. For the under-ventilated high-temperature fire scenario, PCDD/F concentrations are significantly higher, especially for toxic 3, 7, 2, 3, 7, 2, 3, 4, 7, 2, 3, 6, 7, 2, 3, 7, 8, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 3, 7, 2, 3, 7, 3, 4, 7, 2, 3, 4, 7, 2, 3, 6, 7, 2, 3, 7, 8, 3, 4, 6, 7, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, congeners of PCDF. As the temperature increased, PCDFs start to dominate over PCDD. As the temperature in the quartz tube is changed from 350 to 650 and 825\u00b0C, the average ratio of PCDF/ PCDD (based on mono-to octa-chlorinated homologous groups) increased from 1.5, to 9.9 and 184 respectively. PCDD are less stable at higher temperatures than PCDF which may explain the decreasing amount of PCDD shown in Fig. 5 (Fie dler, 1998) . PCDD also tend to convert to PCDF under reducing conditions (Altarawneh et al., 2007) . The results indicate that 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDD dominates the toxic fingerprint for the oxidative pyrolysis experiments, whereas 1,2,3,4,6,7,8-HpCDF for hightemperature under-ventilated combustion. The pattern of toxic PCDD/F at 825\u00b0C is reminiscent of fingerprints observed for the gaseous emissions from combustion of PVC (Font et al., 2010) .",

Both well-ventilated and under-ventilated combustion produces the complete range of PAHs. For the gas phase, individual PAH yields decrease with an increase of molecular weight for both well-ventilated and under-ventilated fire scenarios. For under-ventilated tests there are much higher PAHs yields (50 times higher) in the gas phase, than for well-ventilated tests. Additionally, there are PAHs with three and four rings observed for the under-ventilated scenario, whereas PAHs with mainly up to three rings are observed for the well-ventilated scenario. For the particle phase, similar to the gas phase, there are much higher quantities for large under-ventilated than for well-ventilated fires, and PAHs with up to four or more aromatic rings are found.",

This supports an earlier study which showed that the HCl yields from PVC materials are independent of fire stages and temperature (Hull et al., 2008) . In addition, it can be concluded that in the presence of HCl, CO yields are largely independent of ventilation conditions as well as at temperatures 650\u00b0C and 825\u00b0C (Stec et al., 2008a,b) . CO may result from gas phase inhibition of flaming combustion or it is also possible that CO originated directly from the char by surface oxidation.",

It has been reported that, depending on the fire condition, as much as 20% of the chlorine may exist in an organic form (Lebek et al., 2005) . The HCl concentration found in the well-ventilated tests corresponds to a mass-loss yield of HCl of about 0.3 g g \u00c01 . Comparing the total soot yield found in these tests, about 0.05 g g \u00c01 , with the amount of HCl ''remaining'' for possible association with the soot gives similar quantities of each.",

Some other studies, for example for cone calorimeter which replicates well-ventilated fire conditions, showed a mass-peak at a particle size around 0.35 lm (Hertzberg et al., 2003) .

These measurements can be compared to the results summarised by Carroll (1996) for PVC fires from a number of literature sources, which indicate variation of between 5 and 28300 pg I-TEQ/g residue, variation of nearly four orders of magnitude. Our measurements seem to cover the lower range of the literature values. A more detailed analysis of the literature values reveals that four data sets cover a range of 5-521, and three 3600-28300 pg I-TEQ/g residue. The latter come from measurements on ash from three large-scale PVC fires, two in Germany (Lingen and Lengerich) and one in Canada (Boisbriand, Quebec). It is possible that the ashes from these three fires were contaminated with soot prior to sampling, resulting in significantly higher values of PCDD/F than reported in the present contribution. The PCDD/F load in soot from PVC fires ranges between 35000 and 539000 ng I-TEQ/g soot (Carroll, 1996) . Thus a small amount of soot deposited on the ash could elevate PCDD/F concentrations in the residue from high pg level to low ng level, leading to a large variation in literature values.",
