In this study, 3-week-old SPF PCV2seronegative piglets were inoculated intranasally with PCV2. The effect of immunostimulation on the induction of PMWS was investigated by immunisation with keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) emulsi\u00aeed in incomplete Freunds adjuvant. The study was terminated 5 weeks after inoculation. While disease was not observed in the age-matched controls, two out of \u00aeve non-immunised PCV2infected piglets died on postinoculation day (PID) 21, and one was euthanized on PID 25 in moribund condition. These animals had appeared lethargic with persistent fever from PID 12 onwards. The euthanized pig appeared smaller than littermates and suffered from jaundice. At postmortem examination, gastric ulceration, icterus, and liver and thymus atrophy were observed. Furthermore, histological lesions of degenerating hepatocytes and hepatitis in combination with lymphoid depletion and syncytial cells in lymph nodes were consistent with the diagnosis of PMWS. One out of \u00aeve immunostimulated PCV2-infected piglets was euthanized on PID 22 with convulsions after a period with wasting. This pig was lethargic from PID 14 onwards with persistent fever from Veterinary Microbiology 89 (2002) 97\u00b1114 : S 0 3 7 8 -1 1 3 5 ( 0 2 ) 0 0 1 7 4 -8 PID 8 and transient dyspnoea. No differences in clinical signs, gross pathologic or histological \u00aendings were observed for the remaining non-immunostimulated and immunostimulated PCV2infected piglets. All 10 PCV2-inoculated piglets seroconverted to PCV2 within 14 days after inoculation. By virus isolation, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR), and immunostaining of cryostat sections, it was demonstrated that lymphoid tissue contained abundant PCV2 antigen. Viral DNA load in serum samples was assessed by Q-PCR. All four PMWS-affected piglets had high levels of PCV2 DNA in serum, suggesting that there was a correlation between high levels of viral DNA in serum and the development of PMWS. In conclusion, infection with PCV2 caused PMWS in SPF piglets, however, the immunostimulation did not seem to play a critical role. #",

            "text": "The small single-stranded DNA virus, porcine circovirus (PCV), has recently been recognised as a pathogen of swine. Two types of PCV have been characterised and designated PCV type 1 (PCV1) and PCV type 2 (PCV2), respectively (Allan and Ellis, 2000 and references therein) . PCV1 is considered to be a non-pathogenic virus (Tischer et al., 1986; Allan et al., 1995) , whereas infection of swine with PCV2 is causally associated with development of postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) in weaned 5-to 12-week-old piglets (Allan et al., 1998; Ellis et al., 1998) . PMWS is characterised by weight loss, dyspnoea, and jaundice combined with the pathological \u00aendings of interstitial pneumonia, generalised enlarged lymph nodes, hepatitis, and nephritis (Allan et al., 1998; Ellis et al., 1999) . Typical histological lesions include degeneration and necrosis of hepatocytes, multifocal lymphohistiocytic pneumonia, and lymphocytic depletion and multinucleated giant cell formation in lymph nodes (Clark, 1997; Ellis et al., 1998) . PCV2 antigen is typically localised within the multisystemic lesions in affected piglets (Clark, 1997) . PMWS was \u00aerst identi\u00aeed within high health herds in western Canada in 1991 (Clark, 1997) but has since been reported in swine throughout the world (Allan et al., 1998; Ellis et al., 1999; Onuki et al., 1999; Choi et al., 2000) . Interestingly, serological surveys have shown that PCV2 was present in swine before PMWS was \u00aerst reported (Magar et al., 2000b; Walker et al., 2000) . Furthermore, serologic studies have revealed that many herds are seropositive to PCV2 without clinical signs of PMWS (Labarque et al., 2000; Rodriguez-Arrioja et al., 2000) .",

            "text": "A number of experimental studies have indicated that infection with PCV2 alone is not suf\u00aecient to induce clinical PMWS. As such, several inoculation studies using PCV2 alone have resulted in asymptomatic infection with mild to moderate histopathologic lesions Magar et al., 2000a; Pogranichyy et al., 2000) . In contrast, dual infection with PCV2 and porcine parvovirus (PPV) or porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) potentiates the replication and distribution of PCV2 and induces clinical disease in addition to more severe histopathological lesions Kennedy et al., 2000; Krakowka et al., 2000; Harms et al., 2001) . These results are in concordance with the observation of PCV2 and PPV coinfection in \u00aeeld cases of PMWS and suggest that the presence of another pathogen may augment the pathogenic effects of PCV2. Similarly, gnotobiotic piglets inoculated with PCV2 alone remained clinically asymptomatic while gnotobiotic piglets inoculated with tissue homogenates from PMWS-affected piglets containing both PCV2 and PPV developed lesions typical of PMWS with severe clinical disease Krakowka et al., 2000) . Recently , it has been demonstrated by Krakowka et al. (2001) that activation of the immune system is a key component of the pathogenesis of PCV2-associated PMWS in gnotobiotic pigs. In that study, immune activation was achieved by injection of keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (ICFA) into gnotobiotic piglets infected with PCV2 at 1 day of age. By incorporation of bromo-desoxiuridine (BrDU), upregulation of virus production was roughly correlated to increased numbers of replicating cells. In concordance, increased amounts of infectious virus was recovered from draining lymph nodes by quantitative viral titrations. In that study, all immunised piglets developed PMWS whereas none of the non-immunised piglets inoculated with PCV2 alone developed PMWS and extensive viral replication of PCV2 was observed in PMWS-affected piglets, only . These observations also suggest why all pigs infected with PCV2 do not develop PMWS during an outbreak or an experimental infection since differences in immunological status of pigs are bound to exist both between and within herds or experimental groups. The gnotobiotic model for experimental infections cannot be directly compared to \u00aeeld conditions because of the immature immunological status of gnotobiotes and the obvious differences in husbandry conditions. Furthermore, under \u00aeeld conditions, PMWS is a problem in 5-to 12-week-old piglets indicating that the piglets are infected with PCV2 after weaning. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to investigate the signi\u00aecance of immunostimulation on the development of PMWS in 3-week-old SPF piglets infected with PCV2 immediately after weaning.",

For PCV1, persistently infected PK-15 cells (ATCC CCL-33, USA) were used and for PCV2, PCVfree PK-15 cells infected with the French PCV2 isolate 48285 (Allan et al., 1998) were used. Plates with \u00aexed PCV-infected cells were stored at \u00c020 8C after addition of 50% glycerol in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and washed four times in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST) before use. Plates were inoculated with 50 ml of \u00aeve-fold dilutions at 1:50 to 1:156250 of the serum samples diluted in PBST supplemented with 5% skimmed milk powder (PBST\u00b15% SMP) and incubated for 30 min at 37 8C.

After the \u00aenal washing in PBST, ethylcarbazole substrate was added and the plates were left for 25 min at room temperature. Speci\u00aec staining of cells indicated the presence of antibodies speci\u00aec to PCV in the serum sample. The titer of a serum sample was determined as the highest dilution containing a detectable level of antibodies. Due to cross reactivity between antibodies against PCV1 and PCV2, the interpretation of the results included a comparison of the titers to PCV1 and PCV2. If the titer was highest to PCV2, the result indicated an infection with PCV2.",

Quanti\u00aecation of PCV2 DNA by PCR demonstrated that the four PMWS-affected pigs contained extremely high levels of PCV2 DNA in serum. These data suggest a direct association between an increased load of viral DNA and clinical PMWS in a PCV2-infected pig. The highest amount of viral DNA detected in serum was observed at PID 10 for two individual pigs. Interestingly, one of these pigs developed PMWS and died whereas the level of PCV2 DNA detected in serum from the other pig rapidly declined and this pig survived until termination of the experiment.

The results of virus isolation were in accordance with the results for immuno\u00afuorescence staining and PCV2 was isolated from tissue homogenates from all PCV2-infected piglets.

There were no signi\u00aecant gross pathological differences between non-immunostimulated and immunostimulated PCV2-infected pigs although histologic lesions were generally more severe in the non-immunostimulated pigs. Five weeks after infection, PCV2 was isolated from all tissue pools from all PCV2-infected pigs with similar titers. Furthermore, there were no indications of any immunostimulatory effect upon the distribution of PCV2 antigen detected by immuno\u00afuorescence or Q-PCR within tissue samples originating from non-immunostimulated pigs compared to immunostimulated pigs. From PIDs 7 to 10, there was a tendency for increasing PCV2 template copy numbers detected by Q-PCR in serum from immunostimulated pigs compared to non-immunostimulated pigs but this difference was not statistically signi\u00aecant. Three to 5 weeks after infection, the levels of PCV2 template copy number in serum were also slightly increased in the immunostimulated pigs compared to the non-immunostimulated pigs.

            "text": "The \u00aending of the present study also differs from most previous studies where coinfection with either PPV or PRRSV has been required to induce clinical PMWS Kennedy et al., 2000; Krakowka et al., 2000) . In that respect, however, the current study support the very recent \u00aendings by Bolin et al. (2001) and Harms et al. (2001) that infection of caesarean-derived colostrum-deprived (CD/CD) pigs with PCV2 alone may result in development of clinical PMWS. This apparent inconsistency between different studies on the requirement for co-infection or co-factors in inducing clinical PMWS parallel in many ways the situation from the \u00aeeld. Antibodies against PCV are widespread within swine herds in both Europe and North America (Dulac and Afshar, 1989; Hines and Lukert, 1995; Tischer et al., 1995; Labarque et al., 2000; Rodriguez-Arrioja et al., 2000) . It seems reasonable to believe that PCV infection is ubiquitous throughout the world. Infection of a herd with PCV2, however, often results in subclinical infection only (Labarque et al., 2000; Rodriguez-Arrioja et al., 2000) . It is therefore critical to identify co-factors that have an in\u00afuence upon the development of PMWS-related problems. Differences in immunological status among herds and age of pigs at the time of PCV2 infection might still be part of the answer. Immunological differences are probably more pronounced in the \u00aeeld than under experimental conditions due to larger variability of management conditions and presence of other infectious agents. For example, such differences may explain why countries such as Denmark, despite having a high PCV2 seroprevalence, have not yet experienced severe outbreaks of PMWS as reported from other countries (Segale \u00c2s et al., 1997; Allan et al., 1998; Ellis et al., 1999; Ladekj\u00f1r-Mikkelsen et al., 2001) . As well, there could be as yet unrecognised differences in virulence among PCV2 isolates that are circulating in various pig populations. Introduction of more pathogenic PCV2 strains could then potentially dramatically increase the rate of PMWS-related problems in countries that as yet have not reported PCV2-associated disease. Another important unexplored co-factor could be genetic variability in pig populations. Some pigs may simply be more susceptible to infection with PCV2 and or may be more permissive for viral replication, and, therefore, may be more at the risk of developing PMWS.",
