            "text": "Pathogenesis and Risk Factors J. ROBERT CANTEY, M.D. Charleston, South Carolina Our understanding of the pathogenesis of infectious, especially bacterial, diarrhea has increased dramatically. New etiologic agents, mechanisms, and diseases have become known. For example, Escherlchla coli serogroup 0157 is now known to cause acute hemorrhagic colitis. Also, E. coli serogroups that produce Shiga toxin are recognized as etiologic agents In the hemolytic-uremic syndrome. The production of bacterial diarrhea has two major facets, bacterial-mucosal interaction and the induction of intestinal fluid loss by enterotoxins. Bacterial-mucosal interaction can be described In stages: (1) adherence to eplthelial celi microvilli, which is often promoted by or associated with phi; (2) close adherence (enteroadherence), usually by classic enteropathogenic E. coli, to mucosal epithellal cells lacking microvilli; and (3) mucosal invasion, as with Shigella and Salmonella infections. Further large strides in understanding lnfectlous diarrhea are likely with the cloning of virulence genes if additional host-specific animal pathogens become available for study.",

The first barrier to be encountered in the passage of the infectious agent from the oropharynx is gastric acidity, which is sufficient to kill or inhibit many Enterobacteriaceae [l] . Gut motility is important in preventing infectious agents from approaching the mucosa, as is evident from the fact that animals given opiates to decrease motility experience diarrhea with infectious agents to which they would not ordinarily be susceptible [2] . The \"unstirred water layer,\" a zone of retarded diffusion of solutes in the intestine [3] , could slow the movement of infectious agents toward the mucosal epithelium. The layer of intestinal mucus would also interfere. Beneath the mucous layer is the glycocalyx, which is anchored in the plasmalemma of the epithelial cell and consists of long strands of protein with carbohydrate side chains [4] . Once the infectious agent penetrates the glycocalyx, it could adhere directly to the plasmalemma or invade the epithelial cell. infections . The jejunum is the major site of infection, but the ileum may also be involved [8-l 11. Intestinal villus shortening, crypt hypertrophy, increased epithelial cell turnover, and acute inflammation all occur [7,8,10-151. Epithelial cell microvilli are shortened, blunted, and decreased in number [7, 14, 15] . The deficiency of brush border disaccharidase and sodium/potassium-ATPase activity that is thought to produce diarrhea in viral gastrointestinal infections is a reflection of the increase in immature crypt-type enterocytes on the villus epithelium [8-l 0,13,15] . Little is known about viral-mucosal epithelial cell interaction, except that specific receptors on the epithelial cell seem necessary in Norwalk virus diarrhea [la] .",

There are likely other stages, but examples are not well documented. Current evidence indicates that bacteria that produce diarrhea also synthesize some form of enterotoxin. The following comments focus on the bacterial-mucosal interactions that are best understood. Bacteria That-Are Confined to the Lumen. Adherence to intact microvllli: The mechanisms and relevant surface structures of the interaction of Vibrio cholerae with human and animal intestinal epithelium remain poorly understood, partly because study has been hampered by the lack of pathogenicity of V. cholerae in animals. Such studies as have been done indicate that V. cholerae ad-heres to gut epithelial cells in order to produce diarrhea [17-221. Surface structures important to adherence are unknown. Although it may adhere, V. cholerae type 01 does not invade. Ultrastructural studies of human and animal cholera reveal minimal changes in gut epithelial cells and microvillus border [23-251. More is known about the pathogenesis of enterotoxigenie Escherichia coli diarrhea, as host-specific animal pathogens-and, thus, good animal models-are readily available. Enterotoxigenic E. coli can be seen adhering to intact microvilli in ultrastructural studies [28] . Those that cause diarrhea in pigs were the first bacteria demonstrated to possess pilus (fimbrial) adherence ligands [271.",

            "text": "The pilus or fimbria [28-311 is a filamentous surface protein that is 0.5 to 2 pm long, approximately 7 nm in diameter, and composed of 15 to 20 kilodalton repeating units with an aggregate molecular weight in excess of one million. There are two major groups of pili. The first is the common or type 1 pilus that is associated with mannosesensitive nonspecific adherence to red cells or various other dells [28, 31] . The second group includes pili thought to mediate adherence to specific cells in specific species, the so-called colonization factor antigens [32] . The genes of the type 1 pili usually reside on the bacterial genome, whereas the genes for the latter pili usually reside in plasmid DNA. The porcine E. coli pili were initially believed to be thermolabile polysaccharide antigens and were labeled K88 antigens [33] . The ability of K88-positive enterotoxigenic E. coli to cause diarrhea in pig(lets) was shown to be increased by the K88 antigen. Since that time, other adherence pili of enterotoxigenic E. coli have been described, including K99 in calves, lambs, 987 in pigs [35, 37, 38], F41 in calves, lambs, and CFA I and II in humans and infant rabbits [32, . The K88 pilus increases adherence in the upper small bowel, whereas the K99 and 987 pili increase adherence in the distal small bowel. Increased in vivo adherence and diarrhea1 attack rate is correlated with in vitro adherence to gut mucosal epithelial cells and partially purified gut epithelial cell brush border [48-521. Pilus adherence ligands are limited in variety in animals, in contrast to the human species, in which a large stable of ligands still does not account for the majority of enterotoxigenic E. coli. The lack of a completely satisfactory in vitro adherence assay for human-associated species of enterotoxigenic E. coli has led to an array of assays and different, often overlapping, pilus typing schemes (Table I) . The two major schema are those of Evans et al [43, 44] and Deneke et al [53-551. My reasons for referring to adherence as pilus-associated, rather than being due to pili, are several. First, consider Table I . Human strains of E. coli adhere to animal tissues [43, 44] , and animal strains adhere to human tissues [52, 56] . If bacteria can show preference for proximal or distal small bowel, why do they show lack of specificity concerning species? Perhaps the adherence assays are measuring a characteristic that is not related to adherence in vivo in the preferred species. Additionally, there are major differences among laboratories, which may reflect shortcomings of the assays. For example, in one study, K88-positive bacteria but not K99-positive bacteria adhered to human ileostomy cells [56] . In a different laboratory, K99-positive but not K88-positive bacteria adhered to human jejunal cells [52] .",

The same can be said for transfer of pilus-associated plasmids. The plasmids are often quite large, and they contain more genes than would likely be necessary for pilus synthesis.

Similar histopathologic findings have since been reported in humans infected with enteropathogepic E. coli serogroups 0111, 0119, and 0125 E. coli [63-651. The bacteria first interact with intact microvilli of mucosal epithelial cells of the distal ileum and colon [62] . The microvilli form round bodies and disappear [62] . The bacteria then adhere closely (approximately 11 nm [Sl] ) to the epithelial cell surface, which tends to cup the bacterium by forming pedestal-like structures [62, 64] (Figure 2 ). Invasion of the epithelial cells does not occur. The RDEC-1 strain adheres first to M cells in the epithelium of the Peyer's patches [57], but it is not known whether human strains do the same. In an autopsy series, infants dying of serogroup 0111 E. coli diarrhea had lymphoid hyperplasia, but close adherence of bacteria was not noted [66] .",

Serotype 0111 and 0119 E. coli strains isolated from patients whose jejunal biopsy specimens revealed typical close adherence are The adherence ligand of the RDEC-1 strain is plasmidmediated, highly specific for the rabbit, and is either a pilus structure or is on the same plasmid and cotransferred with pilus expression [71] . An idea of the forces involved in the early stage of adherence of the RDEC-1 strain to intact microvilli may be gathered by studies in which piliated RDEC-1 strain bacteria caused much larger rabbit ileal cell brush borders to aggregate in large visible clumps [72] . Human strains of enteroadherent E. coli do not appear to be piliated under the culture conditions used thus far [73] . RDEC-1 pili are expressed in one medium and suppressed in another [62, 71, 72] , so it may be a matter of finding the right set of culture conditions. The ability of human enteroadherent E. coli to adhere to Hep-2 cells is associated with and can be transferred to another bacterium with a large plasmid [74] . Invasive Bacteria. The pathogenesis of shigellosis has been the subject of much research, particularly by Formal and his colleagues at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research [75-771. The Shigella bacterium adheres to and invades mucosal epithelial cells of the distal small bowel and colon. In an elegant series of experiments, one plasmid and three sites on the bacterial genome necessary for virulence traits of shigellae, including invasion of HeLa cells, mucosal inflammation, a positive Sereny result, and production of fluid in the rabbit ileal loop by Shigella (flexneri) have been localized [78, 79] . When these genes are instilled in an E. coli K12 strain, it exhibits all of the virulence properties of a fully virulent Shigella. The genes necessary for invasion of HeLa cells are located on a large 140 megadalton plasmid that causes minicells to synthesize outer membrane proteins, which by inference are important in HeLa cell invasion [80] . The his region of the bacterial genome, which codes, among other things, for 0 antigen synthesis, is important for mucosal inflammation [79] . Studies by Wantanabe et al [81, 82] indicate that a small plasmid, which codes for a 41,000 megadalton protein involved in the formation of 0 side chains, is important for production of a positive Sereny result by a Shigella flexneri type 1 strain. Together, these latter data confirm a role for surface polysaccharides in virulence of shigellae but do not indicate a role in adherence. Shigellae have not been shown to possess any type of pilus protein that might be important in adherence. Thus, although the stages of pathogenesis of shigellosis have been clearly delineated, the structures relevant to each stage of pathogenesis have not been determined.",

The result is an increase in intracellular cAMP levels, which elicit the specific biologic response of the cell exposed to the toxin. Subunit A2 plays a role in toxin internalization. The B subunit, of which there are five per molecule, is the ligand thought to be responsible for binding cholera toxin to GM1 ganglioside in the plasma membrane of cells (any cell). Labile toxin of E. coli is similar to cholera toxin in most respects.",

It exists in two or perhaps more forms, STa and STb [QQ-1011. STa, which is synthesized by both human and animal strains and has been sequenced, acts by stimulating guanylate cyclase, which produces an increase in cGMP [lo1 -1051. ST is specific for intestinal cells, where it inhibits absorption of fluid and electrolytes. It appears to produce some chloride secretion as well [105] . STb-producing strains are usually of porcine origin. The mode of action of STb, which is different from that of STa, is unknown.",

            "text": "The exact role of this toxin in Shigella diarrhea remains uncertain. However, in monkeys given S. flexneri by mouth, diarrhea developed before dysentery and was accompanied by jejunal colonization but not invasion, and there was secretion of water into the jejunum [122] . When the bacteria were given directly into the cecum, dysentery occurred, but there was no diarrhea, and water transport was normal in the jejunum [123] . These two observations comprise the only evidence for a role of Shiga toxin in shigellosis, but it is believed that such a role exists. In a series of publications, O'Brien and co-workers [124-l 261 have shown that a wide variety of bacteria that cause diarrhea also produce Shiga toxin (Table II) . In fact, only three of the many strains of bacteria tested thus far have not produced toxin. The key to being able to find the toxin in lysates of so many different bacteria was an observation by Dubos and Geiger [128] in 1946 that inorganic iron in the medium decreased the yield of Shiga toxin. When O'Brien and LaVeck [127] removed iron from the medium, the Shiga toxin was more easily detected. The question of the precise role for the Shiga toxin in bacterial diarrhea is critical if the full impact of ,the work of O'Brien and colleagues is to be known, especially since many of the bacteria listed in Table II produce other potent enterotoxins, including cholera toxin, Hemorrhagic colitis, due to E. coli serogroup 0157 (129,130], and hemolytic-uremic syndrome, associated with infection with several E. coli serogroups, but especially serogroups 026 and 0157 [131, 132] , are two syndromes in which it seems highly likely that Shiga toxin will be important in pathogenesis. These E. coli produce large amounts of Shiga toxin (Table II) . It is worth noting that E. coli 026 was initially reported to synthesize Vero cell toxin [133, 134] as was the E. coli associated with hemolytic-uremic syndrome. In fact, the Vero cell cytotoxin could easify be detected in the feces [131] . It is now thought that the Vero and Shiga toxins are one and the same [125, 132] .",

In that model, with its obvious limitations, the amebas ap proached the epithelial cell, the microvillus border disap peared, the epfthelial cell became detached from the lamina propria and adjoining epithelial cells, and the amebas invaded by passing between the detached epithelial cells. Guerrant and colleagues [136, 139] have examined the in vitro interaction of axenic amebas with Chinese hamster ovary cells and have described several stages in the interaction: adherence, extracellular cytolysis of the Chinese hamster ovary cell, and phagocytosis of the lysed cell. Adherence but not phagocytosis was inhibited by Nacetyl-D-galactosamine. The work of other investigators corroborates these studies [140-1421. E. histolytica possesses a cytotoxin, probably a protease enzyme, the quantity of which is correlated with virulence 1143-1461. It has been suggested that this material is important in the tissue destruction produced by the invading amebas. E. histolytica also has enterotoxic activity.

Species specificity is presumably due to the presence of specific receptors on mucosal epithelial cells. Specificity can vary within a species. Some strains of pigs have a decreased affinity for the K66 adherence ligand that is reflected in a decreased diarrheal attack rate [156] . On the other hand, host species is not as important for some pathogens, such as Salmonella. The presence of receptors may also be age-related. The RDEC-1 enteroadherent E. coli does not adhere to ileal brush borders until the rabbits are 20 days old [157] .",
