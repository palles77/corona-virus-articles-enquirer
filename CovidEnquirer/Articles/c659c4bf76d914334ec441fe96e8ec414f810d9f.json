As part of this goal, the APIC Emergency Preparedness Committee (EPC) has been tasked with identifying and/or creating needed resources for preventing infections during disasters. The APIC EPC recognized that many health care facilities and communities are ill prepared to deal with the potential infection ramifications of a large scale bioterrorism event, pandemic, or natural disaster. Much guidance is needed for infection preventionists and noninfection prevention professionals involved with disaster preparedness. The purposes of this article are to provide an overview of 2 new APIC products related to disaster planning and describe the collaborative process used to develop the products.",

            "text": "Many issues surrounding emergency preparedness have potential policy implications, especially those involving creation of new standards and recommendations related to infection prevention during a disaster. In keeping with the APIC Vision 2012\u00d5s Strategic Goal No. 2 Objective No. 2, which states that, ''APIC will effectively influence development of key standards and regulations that impact the practice of infection prevention and control,'' close collaboration is essential between the APIC EPC and the APIC Public Policy Committee (PPC) to address the unique infection prevention needs of disaster planning. This has been illustrated by requests from governmental agencies for APIC to develop guidelines related to allocation of limited resources during a disaster, such as deciding which groups should be prioritized for receipt of personal protective equipment (PPE). There has never been a greater need for infection prevention education, standards, and guidelines related to disaster preparedness. Needs assessments and other research projects conducted by the APIC EPC indicate that many realities of current disaster planning, such as an identified lack of PPE and the need for sheltering large numbers of displaced individuals, put health care workers and community members at risk from exposure to communicable diseases. [1] [2] [3] Strategies are needed to prevent and control infections during all types of disasters. In addition, there is an identified need to create educational and reference material for noninfection prevention professionals/individuals who may need to implement infection prevention programs during a disaster. An example of this is a community shelter that needs to have an infection prevention program in place but may lack individuals with expertise in infection prevention to implement such a program.",

            "text": "This realization led the APIC EPC to begin strategizing about potential products and polices that could enhance disaster planning by maximizing infection prevention. Two of the most important issues identified from the APIC EPC needs assessment included what to do when stocks of respiratory protection were limited or unavailable and how to prevent infection transmission in shelters. At the same time, the APIC PPC was tasked with developing guidelines for minimizing infection transmission while maximizing the availability of PPE, such as N95 respirators, during a pandemic. This culminated in a joint project between the APIC EPC and PPC that involved the creation of guidelines related to the reuse of respiratory protection. In addition, the APIC EPC developed recommendations related to the prevention of infection transmission in shelters during disasters, which was reviewed by the APIC PPC. This article gives an overview of these 2 new products developed by APIC in response to needs identified by APIC members and our strategic partners in disaster planning. The first infection prevention and control product for disasters consists of a Position Statement regarding how to safely reuse respiratory protection when resources are limited. The second infection prevention and control for disasters product consists of an evidence-based planning and reference document for preventing the spread of infectious agents within community shelters. Both products are available free of charge at the APIC Web site beginning July 2008: http://www.apic.org.",

This Position Statement, The Reuse of Respiratory Protection in Prevention and Control of Epidemic-and Pandemic-Prone Acute Respiratory Diseases in Healthcare (Reuse of Respiratory Protection) document, was created in response to numerous requests APIC Headquarters had received. Previous research indicates that supplies of PPE, including respiratory protection, will be limited during a large scale bioterrorism attack or pandemic. 1,3 Past experience has illustrated that health care workers may be some of the most at-risk individuals during an infectious disease disaster in which PPE is limited or there is a lack of adherence to infection control practices, such as the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 4,5 Therefore, it is imperative that health care agencies develop policies and procedures for providing the most protective work environment possible for its workers. This includes having a stockpile or method for obtaining additional supplies of PPE during a disaster, a prioritization plan for allocating scarce resources when supplies start to dwindle, and a procedure for safely reusing PPE if supplies are depleted.",

This document outlines recommendations designed to reduce the risk of transmitting communicable diseases in shelters used for housing displaced individuals during a disaster. These shelters can range from community evacuation centers to basic care facilities, including tented areas, in large scale events. The need for guidance related to infection prevention in shelters was identified by infection preventionists who responded to previous disasters. 2 These infection preventionists indicated that infection prevention and control measures were lacking in shelters used in previous disasters and that this contributed to secondary disease transmission within the shelter. 2 Shelter staff must implement appropriate infection prevention and control measures to reduce the risk of secondary disease transmission in shelters that will be used in future disasters. It is hoped that infection preventionists will be involved in community shelters, but resources may not allow this. Therefore, the Infection Prevention and Control for Shelters During Disasters document (Infection Prevention in Shelters) was written with the assumption that a noninfection prevention professional would be implementing the recommendations.

Although shelter staff may administer first aid and other limited health care services, community shelters for individuals displaced by a disaster are not considered health care facilities. Existing health care facilities and temporary health care delivery systems, such as alternate care sites, will provide the bulk of health care services during a disaster. Ill individuals need to be identified rapidly and transferred to a medical facility or alternate care site so that they receive the treatment they need and, therefore, they do not pose a risk to other individuals in the shelter. This will require infection prevention strategies, such as triage and surveillance, to identify these ill individuals. If potentially contagious individuals cannot be transferred to a medical facility or alternate care site, more intensive infection prevention interventions, such as isolation, may need to be implemented at the shelter. In addition, environmental sources, such as food, water, and waste, can contribute to disease transmission within shelters; environmental controls will be needed.",

            "text": "The collaborative process used to develop these 2 new products is a new approach for the APIC. Previous APIC products have been developed by a single committee or an individual/group assigned by a member of APIC Headquarters. As more is learned about the potential infectious disease implications of disasters, it is becoming evident that a multidisciplinary approach is needed when developing reference and educational materials related to this topic. Many emergency management issues have potential policy implications, such as the reuse of respiratory protection, yet also require expertise in disaster planning. Without a multidisciplinary approach, reference and educational materials may not meet APIC members\u00d5 needs nor be as accurate and effective as possible. The APIC emergency preparedness and public policy committees will continue to work together to develop new educational and reference materials for APIC members and the general public related to infection prevention during disasters.",
