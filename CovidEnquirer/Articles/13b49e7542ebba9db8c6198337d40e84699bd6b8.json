            "text": "Asthma is a chronic respiratory disease associated with airway inflammation. 1 This disease affects approximately 334 million people worldwide and its prevalence is increasing. 2 According to the latest World Health Organization estimates released in December 2016, there were 383,000 asthma-related deaths in 2015. 3 Most of these deaths occur in low-and middle-income countries. 3 Exacerbations play an important role in asthma morbidity and mortality. 4 An exacerbation is defined as acute or subacute episodes of progressive worsening respiratory symptoms. 5 A severe exacerbation corresponds to an emergency consultation or hospitalization. 6 Asthma is an increasingly common cause of emergency department consultations. 7 Twenty percent of patients with asthma have experienced exacerbations requiring treatment within the emergency department or hospitalization and these patients account for more than 80% of the total direct costs of asthma. 8 Mortality among patients hospitalized for asthma exacerbations accounts for one-third of all asthma-related deaths. 9 Abbreviations used COPD-Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease Infections with pulmonary tropism are very frequently involved in triggering asthma exacerbations (40%-80% of cases) 10 and are more often associated with failure of conventional treatments in patients with asthma. 11 Rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, enterovirus, coronavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus are the most common viruses found in asthma exacerbations. 12 Rhinovirus is particularly related to asthma exacerbations and is found in 60% of children experiencing asthma exacerbations. 12 In adults, rhinovirus also seems to be frequently involved in asthma exacerbations. 13 Regarding virus-induced asthma exacerbations, the antiviral response is complex and involves immune cells leading to the release of inflammatory mediators. 14, 15 Immunoglobulins play a key role in the antiviral response, but knowledge remains limited about their involvement in virus-induced asthma exacerbations. Interestingly, it has recently been shown that patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia are more likely to suffer from viral infections, including rhinovirus, compared with healthy subjects, in spite of intravenous immunoglobulin replacement. 16 The prevalence of asthma appears to be higher in patients with various immune deficiencies including hypogammaglobulinemia, with an estimated prevalence of 15% in the studies. 17 The mechanism causing the increased prevalence of viral infections in patients with hypogammaglobulinemia is unknown. Secretory IgA deficiency in the bronchial mucosa has been suggested. 16 To our knowledge, the link between viral infections and serum immunoglobulin in patients with asthma is poorly understood.",

Patients with asthma were recruited from the Department of Respiratory Medicine of the University Hospital of Tours, located in the center of France, as well as from the Department of Respiratory Medicine of the University Centre of Reunion, a French island located in the Indian Ocean. The socioeconomic statuses of the patients are very close because both locations are managed in the same way by the French government. Inclusion criteria were patients aged 18 years or older and hospitalized for an asthma exacerbation. An exacerbation was defined as the increase in respiratory symptoms for more than 24 hours or the use of oral corticosteroid therapy. Asthma diagnoses were established on a history of respiratory symptoms such as wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing associated with variable expiratory airflow limitation before hospitalization according to the Global Initiative for Asthma. 1 Exclusion criteria were smoking more than 10 packs of cigarettes a year, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and pregnancy. The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de pneumologie de langue Fran\u00e7aise. Each patient gave an informed written consent to take part in the study.",

In our study, the epidemiology of viruses found in patients hospitalized for asthma exacerbations was similar to data observed in the literature. Indeed, herein, rhinovirus was the most frequently observed pathogen (38%). This virus is known to be more often associated with asthma exacerbations in children, [20] [21] [22] and some works suggest that it is also the most incriminated virus in severe asthma exacerbations in adults. 13, 23, 24 Our patients also presented with other viruses such as myxovirus influenzae. Myxovirus influenza, particularly influenza A H1N1, is responsible for a significant morbidity and mortality in patients with asthma. [25] [26] [27] Enterovirus appears to be less frequently found in the literature. 28 In our cohort, enterovirus was always found in coinfection with rhinovirus and this represented 5 of 10 patients who had coinfections. The 5 remaining patients were coinfected with rhinovirus/myxovirus influenza A (n \u00bc 3), metapneumovirus A and B/myxovirus influenza A H1N1 (n \u00bc 1), adenovirus/myxovirus influenza A (n \u00bc 1), and coronavirus 229E/myxovirus influenza A (n \u00bc 1).

However, although the difference was not statistically significant, patients with a positive virus sample were slightly younger compared with their negative counterparts (43.5 vs 50.5 years, respectively). The lack of significance is probably due to the small sample size. It is well known that asthma exacerbation in young people is associated with virus infections. 29 Body mass index appears to be a bit higher in patients with positive virus samples compared with patients with negative virus samples (29 kg/m 2 vs 25 kg/m 2 , respectively), but the difference is also not significant. The risk of viral infections in obese patients with asthma has been identified elsewhere in the literature. Indeed, asthma and obesity have been found as independent risk factors of pandemic influenza hospitalization. 30 In our study, more patients in the positive virus group required intensive care although there was no significant difference. Data from the literature suggest that respiratory viruses may trigger severe asthma exacerbations, particularly in young people. 31 The link between viral infections and asthma exacerbations is widely recognized and the impairment of viral immunity may partly explain the development of viral infections in patients with asthma. 32, 33 In influenza infections, IgG has been identified as being particularly involved in protecting the respiratory tract against viruses and its role seems to be superior to that of IgA. 34 Rhinovirus-specific IgG appears to prevent and control reinfection and a high concentration of specific IgG antibodies is correlated with the attenuation of respiratory symptoms and a reduction in viral shedding. 35 A decrease in specific viral antibodies in patients with asthma has been suggested. 36 However, in another study, higher antibody responses to rhinovirus have been shown in patients with asthma compared with controls without asthma. 37 Given the study conducted by Johnston et al 10 on rhinovirus involvement in asthma exacerbations in children, we may also speculate that the admitted patients had less exposure to school-age children in the past and therefore had not generated a sufficient antibody response to the current virus(es). Other mechanisms beyond adaptive immunity dysfunction are involved in virus-induced asthma exacerbations. Indeed, an altered innate immune antiviral response has been observed in patients with asthma compared with those without asthma. [38] [39] [40] Our study does not add a mechanistic explanation for the low level of serum IgG in patients with a positive virus sample.",

Indeed, patients with a hospitalization length of more than 3 days or a steroid course of more than 5 days show lower IgG concentrations at the time of exacerbation. Among patients with stable COPD, reduced total IgG levels have been linked to an increased risk of exacerbations and hospitalizations. 41 In that study, patients with serum IgG level of less than 7 g/L had a higher risk of COPD exacerbations compared with patients with the highest quartile of serum IgG. We assessed the predictive ability of serum IgG concentrations as a biomarker of exacerbation severity. However, it does not seem to be a useful predictor based on modest sensitivity and poor specificity. If we combine serum IgG concentrations and a positive virus sample, the prediction of exacerbation severity was not improved, and further studies are needed to specifically assess IgG level as a marker of severity in asthma exacerbations. The prediction of next hospitalizations with IgG levels would also be interesting, but we cannot answer this question with our study because it was not designed to answer this question. However, we may speculate that a low IgG level particularly at baseline would predispose patients to virus infection and consequently increase their risk of hospitalization.",

We did not measure IgG in patients in a stable condition. It would have been interesting to know if the IgG decline is transient or longer-lasting. Indeed, in patients with COPD, low IgG serum concentrations at baseline seem to be associated with more severe exacerbations per year. 41 However, in this study, no virus analysis was performed. Finally, our study is based on multiplex PCR for virus identification. Nevertheless, the list of viruses, though very extensive, is not exhaustive; therefore, emerging viruses cannot be ruled out.",

Serum IgG levels were lower in patients with a longer length of stay and when a course of oral steroids was prescribed for a longer duration. Further studies are requested to know the exact usefulness of IgG concentrations as a severity marker of severe asthma exacerbations. The understanding of immunologic mechanisms of viral infection in severe asthma exacerbations may be an interesting lead for the development of new therapies in patients for whom severe exacerbations are a source of significant morbidity and mortality. . Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of serum IgG concentrations for (A) the prediction of a length of stay of more than 3 days (for a cutoff value of 11.05 g/L, the best sensitivity and specificity are 80.00% and 50.00%, respectively) and (B) the prediction of a steroid duration of more than 5 days (for a cutoff value of 9.99 g/L, the best sensitivity and specificity are 62.07% and 66.67%, respectively).",
