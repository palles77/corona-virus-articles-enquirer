The Organization for Economic and Cooperative Development (OECD) science and health ministers have concluded in their last annual report that biotechnology will be a key driver for sustainable growth and development in the OECD member countries and beyond (OECD Report, 2004) . Today, some developing nations with enormous human capital like India, China, Brazil, and Korea have been able to demonstrate their capabilities and accomplishments through several biotechnology R and D activities. Many others in countries like Mexico, Argentina, Chile, South Africa, Egypt, Thailand, Hungary and the Czech Republic are ready and eager to follow their example. However, the road ahead will prove to be a difficult one for most developing nations. Support for the development of therapies and products for endemic and neglected diseases requires the building of a sustainable infrastructure in these nations. In many countries, the typical prerequisite elements of welleducated and trained population, scientific excellence, business-friendly set of intellectual property rights, regulatory infrastructure and healthcare system are simply not sufficient or absent (Marshall, 2004) . The lack of these essential building blocks presents enormous hurdles to the nascent biotechnology industry in these developing countries. Industrialized nations and international organizations have the obligation to encourage innovation, form new collaborative alliances with institutions in developing countries, and provide them with sustainable guidance and resources for building a capable biotechnology infrastructure that are so urgently needed.",

Unfortunately, medicines developed by multinational companies are too expensive and individuals in developing nations, who must pay for medicines out of their own pocket, cannot afford them. For example, for an AIDS drug cocktail patent holders can charge up to US $10,000 annually in certain markets. However, in the absence of patent regulations, makers of generic drugs sell their versions for less than US $300 (Boulet et al., 2003) . Even the less expensive drugs may still be inaccessible to the extremely poor. Many developing countries unable to compete with or afford competitors' products have focused their biotechnology impetus to produce affordable therapeutic alternatives, instead of supporting novel drug innovation. This was largely possible because of lenient patenting regulations (Thorsteinsdotir et al., 2004) . India, the world leader in generic drug manufacture, is a prime example of reducing cost of production in this way while making medicines affordable to underprivileged individuals (Kumar et al., 2004) .",

This experience demonstrates that governmental or not-for-profit research institutions should transfer early stage biomedical technologies to institutions other than pharmaceutical companies in the western world. Of course, this should not be done haphazardly. NIH OTT learned a key lesson while expanding its licensing activities in developing countries: participating institutions should have some research and development (R and D) capability and clear national and regional public health objectives. When these two conditions are met, access to key technologies and models of successful product development by the NIH can enhance the prevention and care of infectious and non-communicable diseases.

Much needed cures for tropical diseases can be developed through such an approach (Maurer et al., 2004) . Similarly, various types of patent pooling arrangements for a particular technology could provide relief to the challenges of IP fragmentation presently stifling biomedical development and thus access to essential medicines.

For instance, out of the nearly 1,400 new drugs that were registered between 1975 and 1999, only 1% (13 drugs) was for tropical diseases (Olliaro and Trouiller, 1999; DNDi Working Group and MSF, 2003) . However, 95% of the annual 17 million deaths worldwide from infectious and communicable diseases occur in developing countries (OECD, 2002). advances that will dramatically improve health in developed countries will not equally benefit the poor ones.",

In case of malaria, the disease was virtually eradicated through use of insecticides and malaria drugs in North America and Europe.

This continues to hamper the efforts to turn early-stage technologies into useable products. 10 eg.

OTT has already been successfully moving PHS technologies to institutions in developing countries, such as India and Brazil, based on public-health needs and R and D and commercialization capabilities, but only a few institutions in even fewer countries are familiar with the patenting or licensing process and/or are able to enter well-prepared into technology transfer transactions and negotiate terms and conditions. IPR is considered a critical currency in technology transfer and innovation generally: Intellectual Property Rights: Implications for Development ICTSD and UNCTAD, 2003. For technologies with a worldwide market, such as those related to HIV/AIDS and tuberculosis, the NIH OTT has adopted license terms in the last few years that require companies in North America or Europe to provide a marketing plan for making products available to developing countries. Usually, these plans are due shortly after receiving their first market approval. Since these technologies are in their early stage, none of the licenses governed by these terms have yet reached this milestone. Licensing of technologies directly to companies in developing countries often involves an agreement with enforceable benchmarks for tracking licensee's progress. Additionally, these benchmarks may be linked to public health policies stipulating safe clinical trials and environment-conscious practices .",

Thus, in countries where the patent owner has not sought patent protec-tion, as is often the case in many developing countries, a biological materials license agreement can be an important incentive in providing the institutions with some level of market protection for the transfer of technologies. In addition, NIH OTT has utilized geographic exclusivity or co-exclusivity as an incentive for a licensee to develop a biotechnology-related product for a particular regional market. When an exclusive license is not needed to encourage commercialization, non-exclusive licensing, regionally or worldwide, will allow multiple parties to compete in the market to develop a product.

            "text": "It is important to recognize that even though biotechnology will not be the panacea for underdeveloped regions, it should be viewed as an important tool of the total solution toward alleviating global health disparities. By improving R & D and IPM capabilities, institutions in developing countries are increasingly able to interact and implement partnerships with a wide range of local and international organizations to ensure that their inventions move from the laboratory to the patient. The OTT will continue to forge new paths by conceiving of international biotechnology transfer as an important component for achieving the global R & D goals. The NIH OTT is committed to contributing expertise and sharing ideas, strategies, and practices with other organizations in both developing and industrialized nations. In addition, OTT will continue to mutually learn from partners about alternative creative solutions to challenges involved in the research and development of health technologies.",

This activity is helping NIH to meet an important part of its global public health mission: to reduce the devastating disease burden on people living in developing countries. Bringing biomedical inventions to populations in less-developed regions of the world can be achieved through various technology licensing models fitting the specific competencies of the research and development infrastructure in developing countries. Moreover, it is expected that OTT's activities in global technology transfer will promote good licensing practices that meet regional and national health priorities and standards. As a result, these activities should enhance public availability of new technologies, attract new biotechnology R & D resources, obtain returns on public investment, and stimulate economic and social development.",
