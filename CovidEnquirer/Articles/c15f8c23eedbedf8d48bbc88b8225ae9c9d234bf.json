We applied high-throughput protein production and structure determination pipeline at the Center for Structural Genomics of Infectious Diseases to produce SARS-CoV-2 proteins and structures. Here we report the high-resolution crystal structure of endoribonuclease Nsp15/NendoU from SARS-CoV-2 -a virus causing current world-wide epidemics.

The genome contains a large replicase gene encompassing nonstructural proteins (Nsps), followed by structural and accessory genes. Due to ribosomal frameshifting, the replicase gene encodes two ORFs, rep1a and rep1b, that are translated into two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab (Cui et al., 2019) . These polypeptides are processed by two viral proteases: 3C-like protease (3CLpro, encoded by Nsp5), and papain-like protease (PLP, encoded within Nsp3). The cleavage yields 16 viral Nsps (Baez-Santos et al., 2015) that assemble into a large membrane-bound replicase complex and exhibits multiple enzymatic activities. While several functions of Nsps have been linked to RNA replication and processing of subgenomic RNAs, the roles of some proteins are poorly understood or remain unknown.",

The structural homology is not only observed in positions of a-helices and b-strands but surprisingly in several loop regions (for example the conformation of loop L1 (F16 -P24) is virtually identical in all three proteins).

This is in agreement with PISA calculations, estimating trimers to be a stable form of the enzyme, and the previous experimental work capturing SARS-CoV Nsp15 trimeric intermediates (Guarino et al., 2005) . It has been shown that hexamer is essential for the enzymatic activity. A ~100 \u00c5 long and narrow (10-15 \u00c5 diameter) channel runs down the 3-fold axis. This channel is accessible to solvent from the top, bottom and also through three side openings in the middle of hexamer. The hexamer is stabilized by the interactions of N-terminal oligomerization domains, but also each subunit domain contributes to oligomer interface. As a result, monomers interact extensively with all five other subunits of the hexamer, making the hexamer potentially very sensitive to mutations that can disrupt oligomeric assembly (Fig. 4) . The middle domains are the most transposed out in the hexamer creating the concave surfaces that may serve as an interaction hubs.

The main chain architecture of this region as well as side chain conformations of the active site residues (with exception of Lys290) are conserved between all three proteins. The two histidine residues are contributed by the helical layer of the domain, while pairs lysine/serine and threonine/tyrosine originate from two b-strands representing edges of the b-sheets. His235, His250, Lys290 have been proposed to constitute the catalytic triad, based on the similarity of their mutual arrangement to the active site of ribonuclease A (Ricagno et al., 2006) . In this scenario, His235 plays a role of the general acid while His250 acts a base. By the same reasoning, Ser294 together with Tyr343 are believed to govern U specificity, resembling the roles of Phe120 and Thr45 (the B1 subsite specific for pyrimidine base) in RNAse A in base recognition (delCardayre & Raines, 1994) .",

However, the metal binding site was never located, though it is important to note that there is no structure of the protein/RNA complex. In our structure, there are two subunits in the asymmetric unit. One of them has an electron density peak near the active site that may correspond to metal ion and we tentatively modeled it as a magnesium ion, although the coordination sphere is poor. The metal ion is coordinated by oxygen atom of carboxylate Asp283 (2.61 \u00c5), hydroxyl group of Ser262",

Briefly, the gene for Nsp15 SARS-CoV-2 was optimized for E. coli expression using the OptimumGene codon optimization algorithm followed by manual editing and then synthesized cloned directly into pMCSG53 vector (Twist Bioscience). The plasmid was transformed into the E. coli BL21(DE3)-Gold strain (Stratagene). For large-scale purification of the protein, a 4 L culture of LB Lennox medium was grown at 37\u00b0C (190 rpm) in presence of ampicillin 150 \u00b5g/ml. Once the culture reached OD 600 ~1.0, the temperature setting was changed to 4\u00b0C. When bacterial suspension cooled down to 18\u00b0C it was supplemented with the following components to indicated concentration: 0.2 mM IPTG, 0.1% glucose, 40mM K 2 HPO 4 . The temperature was set to 18\u00b0C for 20 hours incubation. Bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation at 7,000g and cell pellets were resuspended in a 12.5 ml lysis buffer (500 mM NaCl, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 50 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 20 mM imidazole and 10 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol) per liter culture and sonicated at 120W for 5 minutes (4 sec ON, 20 sec OFF). The cellular debris was removed by centrifugation at 30,000g for one hour at 4\u00b0C. Supernatant was mixed with 4 ml of Ni 2+ Sepharose (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) equilibrated with lysis buffer supplemented to 50 mM imidazole pH 8.0 and suspension was applied on Flex-Column (420400-2510) connected to Vac-Man vacuum manifold (Promega).

As with the monomeric folds, the SARS-CoV-2 hexamer shows higher similarity to the SARS-CoV assembly than to H-CoV-229E and MERS-CoV. The largest difference between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV seems to occur in the position of middle domains. The differences with H-CoV-229E are still more significant and show shifts in positions of a-helices, b-sheets and loops. Similarly, MERS-CoV enzyme show significant structural changes, particularly in the loops",
