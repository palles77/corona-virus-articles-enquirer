(3) The presentation of illness mimics that of a flu like illness with fever and respiratory symptoms as common presenting complaints and bilateral patchy infiltration is typically noted on computed tomography (CT) scans.(4) The majority of COVID-19 cases (87%) occur between 30-79 years of age and most (81%) are mild.",

It is important to note that the clinical presentations were not distinct from those described in non-immunosuppressed individuals and the patient with severe disease presented with a viral prodrome, displayed the typical findings on CT scan imaging and progressed to clinical hypoxia. The second patient presented with a fever and mild CT scan findings (this being the screening modality used in China) with resolution in a few days. The laboratory findings mirrored those observed in non-transplant patients with elevated C-Reactive Protein levels and lymphopenia. The treatment for the patient with severe disease included withholding baseline immunosuppression and treating with high dose corticosteroids and pooled immunoglobulin infusions. A \"kitchen-sink\" approach to the cases also included the use of a fluroquinolone along with ganciclovir, but whether this therapy was useful cannot be determined by this limited reporting. Crucially, the patient recovered to discharge without incurring immunological consequences on the cardiac allograft and remained rejection-free.",

While several molecules are under investigation, Remdesivir (an adenosine analogue that incorporates into viral RNA chains and results in premature termination) and Chloroquine (an anti-malarial drug that increases prevents viral cell fusion, and interferes with glycosylation of cellular receptors of SARS-CoV) appear to have early in-vitro evidence in support of their potential activity against SARS-CoV-2. (12, 13) Other drugs, such as ribavirin, interferon, lopinavir-ritonavir and corticosteroids that have been used in patients with the 2003 SARS or the 2012 Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), are candidates for investigation. The reason is that the novel corona virus belongs to the Betacoronavirus family which also contains SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV). (12) Hyperimmune globulin that contains targeted antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, derived from the plasma of recovered individuals and thus capable of providing passive immunity, may also be therapeutic.
