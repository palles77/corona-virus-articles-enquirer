Before public health officials in China recognized the significance of the initial outbreak of this new disease, infected travelers had sparked secondary outbreaks in several Asian nations and in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The severity of the ensuing illness and its ready transmissibility severely challenged the medical care systems of affected countries. [1] [2] [3] [4] Although much has been learned about SARS since the disease was first identified, many questions are unanswered. It is not yet known, for example, if the disease is seasonal, how it may be transmitted, and why certain individuals are \"superspreaders\" of infection. 5, 6 SARS is characterized by a high degree of infectivity among close personal contacts, including treating health care workers. 7, 8 To date, SARS infection has not produced a random pattern of contagious spread. [1] [2] [3] 9, 10 The virus can contaminate buildings, fixtures, and patient care areas, but details of how contamination takes place and the persistence of infectious material are unknown. 4 As yet, no antimicrobial agent (alone or in combination with other drugs such as corticosteroids) has been established as effective.",

When the worldwide incidence of SARS declined this past spring, officials quickly declared victory. The June 18, 2003 edition of USA Today announced, \"Experts: SARS Is Stopped.\" 5 This statement may be regretfully premature. It is extremely difficult to predict the course of a new epidemic disease, particularly one that is still being characterized. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, offered a cautionary note. \"We still have the same conditions in China that led to the emergence of this epidemic, so there's no reason to believe it's not going to happen again,\" he observed. \"We're just one case from the disease reappearing.\" 5 There are also historical reasons to worry. The influenza pandemic of 1918 to 1919 was a global disaster. First identified in Spain in February 1918, the disease was named \"Spanish flu\" or \"La Grippe.\" The initial outbreak in the United States occurred at a Kansas army camp in March 1918. Like many viral respiratory diseases, Spanish flu subsided with the onset of summer. Only isolated cases were identified over the next few months.",

By the time the Spanish flu ran its course, more than 25% of the US population had fallen ill, and 675,000 Americans had died. Worldwide, Spanish flu To avoid a replay of problems encountered around the globe, immediate steps should be taken to enhance the nation's capacity to control this highly lethal disease. There are many reasons to do so above and beyond betting on whether SARS will ever return. SARS resulted from a confluence of natural events, 24,25 but it shares many characteristics with bioterrorism agents (Table) . Therefore, rapid adoption of processes and procedures to safely identify and control SARS will not only safeguard public health, they will enhance national security. 26, 27 Ironically, despite ongoing fear of bioterrorism, it can be argued that key elements of our health care system today are less capable today of containing a biologic threat than they were before September 11, 2001. 19,20,27 There are many explanations for this paradox. As a result of progressive cuts in third-party reimbursement and a shortage of trained staff, US hospitals shed 103,000 staffed hospital beds and 7,800 medical/surgical ICU beds during the decade of the 1990s. 28 Fewer beds mean longer waits before unscheduled admissions from the EDs can reach an inpatient unit. 19, 20 Boarding of admitted patients in the ED is the factor most commonly associated with crowded conditions and subsequent diversion of inbound ambulances-practices that heighten the risk of disease transmission. These are killed at least 20 million people, making it the most deadly global pandemic in history. 16, 17 With an estimated case-fatality rate of 2.5%, Spanish flu was 25 times more deadly than a typical outbreak of influenza, which kills only one tenth of 1% of infected individuals. 11 SARS is less contagious than influenza, but it is readily transmitted to close contacts, including health care workers wearing personal protective equipment. 18 More disturbingly, SARS is more virulent than any known strain of influenza, including the Spanish flu of 1918.",

For various reasons, these individuals are already stretched to their operating limits. 19, 20 When SARS was first identified, US hospitals were able to screen ED patients by asking those with acute respiratory symptoms and fever if they had a history of recent travel to a SARS-endemic area or contact with someone from an endemic area. This strategy worked because SARS was entering the United States from a relatively small number of Asian countries and the city of Toronto. If SARS ever becomes established in the United States, these questions will lose their specificity. Once that happens, it will be extremely difficult to differentiate early cases of SARS from the broad variety of respiratory illnesses that cause fever, cough, and myalgias. 21, 22 In a normal fall or winter, millions of Americans experience these symptoms.",

[30] [31] [32] [33] [34] Observations gleaned from the initial outbreaks of SARS may offer important insights into what we can do to effectively contain a future outbreak of this deadly disease. Although this information will be helpful, it will do little good unless policymakers recognize the need to take immediate steps to provide our nation's EMS systems, EDs, and hospitals with the protective equipment, training, and facilities they need to safeguard the public's health. Most of the funds that were publicly pledged to strengthening the nation's defenses against bioterrorism have not yet reached their target groups. As a result, we are woefully unprepared for a reemergence of SARS this winter.",
