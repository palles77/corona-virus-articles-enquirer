Clinical abnormalities included weight loss, hyperaesthesia of the neck and back, cardiac murmur and systemic muscle atrophy. The cat died 10 days after the initial presentation and a necropsy examination was performed. Grossly, extensive pale lesions were seen in the wall of the left ventricle and the septum of the heart. There were no detectable masses in the heart, skeletal muscles or peripheral nerves. Histopathological examination revealed diffuse, extensive infiltration of atypical lymphoid cells in the heart; the cardiac muscles were markedly degenerate and atrophic and were replaced by the neoplastic cells. Neoplastic cells with similar morphology were seen in all specimens of the skeletal muscles and peripheral nerves. Clonality analysis of the paraffin wax-embedded heart tissue revealed a monoclonal rearrangement of the gene encoding the T-cell receptor g chain. Based on these findings, the case was diagnosed as T-cell lymphoma with tropism for striated muscle and peripheral nerve.",

Physical examination revealed weight loss, hyperaesthesia of the neck and back, cardiac murmur (Levine 1/6) and systemic muscle atrophy. Abnormal laboratory findings included leucocytosis (27.6 \u00c2 10 9 /l; reference interval 6.3e19.6 \u00c2 10 9 /l), anaemia (packed cell volume 22% [reference interval 28e47%]; haemoglobin 73 g/l [reference interval 81e142 g/l]) and elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN, 32.1 mmol/l; reference interval, 4.3e14.6 mmol/l), creatinine (229.8 mmol/l; reference interval, 61.9e221 mmol/l) and lactate dehydrogenase (264 U/l; normal <201 U/l). The level of serum creatinine kinase was elevated 1 day after the initial presentation (>2000 U/l; normal <469 U/l) and remained higher than normal for 4 days. Atypical cells were not observed in the peripheral blood. Serological tests for feline leukaemia and feline immunodeficiency viruses were negative. The antibody titre for feline coronavirus was 1,600, suggesting a subclinical infection. A right lateral thoracic radiograph revealed enlargement of the cardiac silhouette (vertebral heart scale, 9.0; normal 7.5 AE 0.3). B-mode echocardiography showed moderate hypertrophy of the left ventricular papillary muscle and left atrium enlargement (left atrium-to-aorta ratio, 1.61; normal <1.5).",

These were fixed in 10% neutral buffered formalin, processed routinely and embedded in paraffin wax. Sections (5 mm) were stained with haematoxylin and eosin (HE). Sections were also subjected to immunohistochemistry (IHC) with primary antibodies specific for CD3 and CD20 (Supplementary Table 1 ). After dewaxing and pretreatment, tissue sections were processed in a Histo-stainer\u00d4 (Nichirei Biosciences, Tokyo, Japan). Briefly, sections were treated with 5% skimmed milk in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) for 10 min and reacted with each primary antibody for 1 h. After incubation in 3% H 2 O 2 for 15 min, application of horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (Histofine Simple Stain MAX PO \u00d2 ; Nichirei Biosciences) for 30 min was performed. Positive reactions were 'visualized' with 3, 3 0 -diaminobenzidine (DAB Substrate Kit; Nichirei Biosciences). Sections were counterstained lightly with haematoxylin. Non-immune mouse or rabbit IgG was substituted for primary antibody as a negative control. Infiltrating lymphocytes in the same section served as an internal positive control.",

Neoplastic cells with similar morphology were seen in all specimens of the skeletal muscles ( Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. 8 ) and peripheral nerves ( Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 9 ). The neoplastic cells were also seen in the dark red nodule in the adipose tissue around the left kidney and in the gastric mucosa. However, neoplastic cells were not observed in the central nervous system, kidneys, intestines or lymph nodes. Histopathological findings in other organs included bile duct cystadenoma in the liver and chronic nephropathy.

Lymphomas primarily involving striated muscle or peripheral nerve are rare, but are reported in man, dogs and cats. Human lymphomas rarely involve both the peripheral nerve and skeletal muscle (Advani et al., 2015) . In man, peripheral nerve or skeletal muscle lymphomas tend to infiltrate along the anatomical structure and peripheral nerve lymphomas typically do not invade the central nervous system from the cranial or peripheral nerve roots (Oya, 2014) . Some types of lymphomas are expected to have affinity for the peripheral nerves or skeletal muscles. In man, primary peripheral nerve lymphomas are mostly diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (Misdraji et al., 2000) . The patients have ataxia, hyperaesthesia, pain and muscle atrophy caused by the infiltration of lymphoma into the peripheral nerves. Skeletal muscle lymphomas are rarer than peripheral nerve lymphomas. In human skeletal muscle lymphomas, the B-cell phenotype is the most common, although natural killer cell lymphoma, T-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin's disease have been also described to involve the muscle (Surov, 2014) . Clinical symptoms of such skeletal muscle lymphomas include pain, muscle atrophy, paraesthesia and ataxia. In the present case, the clinical signs such as ataxia of hindlimbs, knuckling of the left forelimb, hyperaesthesia of the neck and back and muscle atrophy were thought to be caused by the infiltration of the lymphoma into the peripheral nerves and skeletal muscles.",

            "text": "Since the present lymphoma did not form a mass in any organ, it was difficult to diagnose this case as lymphoma before necropsy examination. Some human cases have masses or swelling of peripheral nerves (Agrawal et al., 2013) and skeletal muscles (Matikas et al., 2013) , while others have no apparent masses and are detectable only after biopsy or necropsy examination (Asanome et al., 2018) . In cats, B-cell lymphoma in multiple peripheral nerves (e.g. sciatic nerve, multiple brachial plexus) without mass formation has been reported (Higgins et al., 2008) . Therefore, neurotropic lymphoma should be considered in the differential diagnosis when an animal presents with neurological signs such as ataxia and hyperaesthesia. In this case, myocardial injury by the lymphoma was severe and extensive and was considered to be the major cause of death. Primary cardiac tumours are uncommon in dogs and cats and lymphomas infrequently involve the heart (Treggiari et al., 2017). Cardiac neoplasms can cause severe, lifethreatening clinical signs with short median survival times. Canine T-cell lymphoma with prominent cardiac and peripheral nerve involvement (Nakagun et al., 2018) and feline primary cardiac lymphoma (Shinohara et al., 2005) are reported. The canine case had enlargement of the cardiac silhouette and shared many similarities with the present case, including involvement of the heart and multiple peripheral nerves, clinical signs (e.g. hindlimb ataxia) and T-cell monoclonality; however, skeletal muscle involvement was not detected in the canine case.",
