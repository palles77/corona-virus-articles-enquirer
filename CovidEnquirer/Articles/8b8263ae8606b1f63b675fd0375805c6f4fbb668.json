This is contrary to most published LRDI research, where the discovery focus is searching for rare events. \u204e It is important to have topical specialist(s) working closely with information technologist(s); the topical specialist(s) applies judgment in selecting the most important concepts. \u204e A functional form of the information retrieval query with proximity searching capability provides highly selective filtering for discovery retrieval and core prevention/treatment retrieval; the functional form of the query with proximity searching capability allows the use of full-text for discovery and core prevention/treatment. \u204e Bibliographic coupling (identifying papers that share common references) combined with text-based relationships strengthens selection for potential discovery further. \u204e Having 'skin-in-the-game' (being affected personally) relative to the medical outcome is a strong incentive to do whatever is necessary to solve the research problem. \u204e Hormesis is critical to healing; relatively modest doses of stimuli tend to be beneficial, whereas relatively large doses may be harmful. The synergy of hormetic treatment doses produces effects larger than combinations of individual doses and requires smaller doses when combined; the synergy of hormetic doses allows conversion of megadoses of nutrients typically reported in lab/clinical studies to physiological (food-level) doses and associated increased safety. \u204e Co-promoters (combinations of toxic stimuli required to produce disease symptoms) are extremely important for explaining seemingly conflicting results; if true co-promotion is present, elimination of one of the co-promoters may be adequate for removing symptoms, even though the overall problem persists. \u204e Prior art (potential treatments already published in the literature but not pursued by mainline medicine) may have much to contribute to potentially solve many serious medical problems; much of prior art is overlooked, especially low-tech prior art (e.g., foods, food extracts, herbs, etc.).",

Any medical approach that involves administering treatments for chronic and infectious diseases without addressing the cause(s) results in a broad range of outcomes mainly involving substitution of one set of symptoms for another. \u204e Past results of LRDI medical studies showed much overlap among preventatives/systemic treatments for different diseases. Differences will arise mainly in focused treatments, especially those involving high technology. \u204e The central parameters to healing in much medical research are never identified nor reported. Many treatments require a combination of skilled practitioners, cause removal, and immune/neural/endocrine/circulatory systems to be healthy for full effectiveness, yet practitioner skill, degree of cause removal, and immune system et al. health are never reported. A lack of this information does not allow efficacy of different treatments to be compared. Reviews and meta-analyses that compare and draw conclusions about the effectiveness of these different treatments without the above critical information being reported are of extremely limited value and credibility. \u204e Finally, the most important deficiency for fully reversing chronic and infectious diseases, as well as rapidly accelerating healing of injuries and wounds, is the credibility and integrity of the medical literature itself, especially in areas that concern commercial and government/political sensitivities. In the evaluation of many concepts that deviated from the norm, it was difficult to ascertain whether the difference was based on solid high-quality research, poor research, or deliberately skewed research.",

In the LRD context, discovery is linking two or more literature concepts that have heretofore not been linked (i.e., disjoint concepts), in order to produce novel, interesting, plausible, and intelligible knowledge.

LBDI involves mainly analysis of the literature, whereas LADI exploits the knowledge of published authors in an interactive mode (e.g., convening workshops or panels, and brainstorming ideas, using authors identified by literature analysis). Either approach can be open discovery system (ODS), where a problem is specified and the goal is to find solutions, or closed discovery system (CDS), where e.g. a problem and solution are specified, and it is desired to identify the mechanisms by which the solution addresses the problem. LBDI first surfaced as LBD in Swanson's 1986 pioneering paper [12] on potential treatments for Raynaud's Phenomenon (RP). The general theory behind Swanson's ODS LBD approach, applied to two separate literatures, is based upon the following considerations [12] .",

To my knowledge, it is the first documented complete reversal of MS. The main component of the treatment the author/patient recommended was a strict diet. Its major components included greens [kale, parsley, etc.]; sulfur-rich vegetables [cabbage, broccoli, etc.]; flavonoids/polyphenols [berries, strongly-colored vegetables and fruits, etc.]; omega\u2212 3 fatty acids [wild salmon, herring, etc.]; grass-fed meat [organ meats, etc.]; seaweed. The author/patient eventually added neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) to both grow new muscle and re-activate existing muscle, thereby reversing the damage from MS. Prior to the implementation of the strictest version of the diet, her progress with NMES was very slow. Once the final diet was used, progress increased rapidly.",

This narrow focus on complexity occurs when causes are not pursued or deliberately concealed, and 'treatments' are provided having little to do with addressing causes. The heavy focus on complexity for disease reversal occurs in many cases because complexity is profitable. That is not to say all these serious diseases are 'curable', or that complexity is never required.

Dr. Wahls eliminated the major cause of her MS (poor diet), and the symptoms associated with MS disappeared (pain, fatigue, etc.). However, the damage from MS (gait and motor control problems) remained, to some extent. To reverse that damage, she had two major options. She could let nature take its course and reverse the symptoms of the damage. This alone might work, but natural biological processes can take a long time for healing. For faster results, she could use some external form of treatment to accelerate healing. She chose NMES, and, in combination with improved nutrition, was able to accelerate healing. Now comes one of the more critical findings of this paper. If we rate the quality of diets from one to a hundred, where one is the lowest, then, assuming Dr. Wahls had an average American diet before she contracted MS, her diet pre-2000 (before being diagnosed with MS) was perhaps a 40. Then, she was diagnosed with MS, started to deteriorate, and changed to a Paleolithic diet (there are various incarnations of the so-called Paleo diet, but they consist mainly of fish, grass-fed pasture raised meats, vegetables, fruit, roots, and nuts, and exclude grains, legumes, dairy products, salt, refined sugar, and processed oils) in 2003. Assuming she followed it strictly, I would rate it about 95, based on our past LRDI (mainly dietary) findings for different diseases. Then, in 2007, she started NMES. Her progress, if any, was minimal. When she switched to her present strict diet, which I would rate at 99 (I do not know whether there's a strong case for the meat as a healer based on previous LRDI findings, but if she's eating organ meats from grass-fed free-range animals, meat probably will not hurt), the NMES results increased dramatically.",

So, if someone were to run tests of the efficacy of NMES on many MS patients, the spectrum of responses they would see would be a mirror of the quality of the diet (or, more generally, the degree of cause removal from whatever source), and tell relatively little about the efficacy of NMES.",

It is very difficult to get hard data showing actual bias mechanics, since sponsors and journal gatekeepers can argue that rejected studies or proposals are due to poor quality rather than any decision-maker bias.

Now, this could be done at the full-text level, at the Abstract level, at the title level, or at combinations of all three levels. For demonstration purposes, I used common phrases in titles.

Since the evaluation of each phrase for potential discovery requires reading the records associated with the phrase, the problem quickly becomes infeasible without provision of additional filtering criteria.

Magda Havas published results showing EMF exposure being a potential cause of MS [28] ; for people in the study who were diagnosed with MS, symptoms increased markedly when they were exposed to certain forms of EMF, and decreased markedly when the EMF sources were eliminated. Assume it is. We know there must be other factors, since not everyone exposed to EMF gets MS/MS symptoms. They could be genetic factors. However, I would assume factors like diet play a much larger role, for most people. For purposes of this discussion, assume the combination of EMF exposure and poor diet is the 'cause'. Also, let's assume either one by itself, while toxic, would not be enough to 'cause' MS. Then, if a strict diet protocol is followed, it might strengthen the neural and immune systems sufficiently that they are able to ward off the MS-symptom effects of the EMF. So, if poor diet is a strong co-promoter along with other toxic stimuli, removing poor diet as a co-promoter might be adequate to reverse symptoms. It may very well be that all 'causes' need not be eliminated for the symptoms to disappear, only the dominant ones. It would be desirable, of course, to eliminate as many causes as possible, but that may not be absolutely necessary. The other co-promoters may still be present, but cleaning up the diet may have raised the threshold for symptoms to appear. What we do not know is whether a hysteresis effect is present for healing. In other words, does the diet required to reverse the disease have to be stricter than the diet necessary to prevent the disease?",

Before our initial Raynaud's phenomenon LRDI study [4] , I believed if we could replicate Swanson's results, that would be a major step forward, and if we could find one or two additional 'potential discoveries', that would be a breakthrough. The reality was completely opposite. We found orders of magnitude more potential discovery than any of the other LRDI researchers, as well as a vast amount of prior art.

Unfortunately, I have many more reservations and much mistrust about what is published in the overall biomedical literature than I had when I started LRDI development, especially on topics that have potential commercial and/or political sensitivity. Many potential causes cannot be identified with certainty because of 1) necessary research that was not done, or 2) necessary research that was done and not published, or 3) research that was published for the purpose of sowing confusion. Thus, the potential treatments identified using LRDI should be viewed as a sub-set of those necessary to address all the potential causes. For those individuals whose disease resulted from those causes identified with LRDI, the treatments have a reasonable chance of success. For those individuals whose disease resulted from causes additional to those causes identified with LRDI, the success of the treatments identified would depend on the relative co-promotional strengths of those causes identified with LRDI to those causes not identified with LRDI.",
