During this era, serology became an important aid in virus classification, and particle morphology continues to be an important aspect of virus classification. n Functional classification: In recent years, more emphasis has been placed on the replication strategy of the virus. This is particularly true for the composition and structure of the virus genome and the constraints that they impose on replication. Molecular analysis of virus genomes permits rapid and unequivocal identification of individual virus strains but can also predict the properties of a previously unknown virus with a familiar genome structure. In a teleological sense (i.e., crediting an inanimate organism such as a virus with a conscious purpose), the sole objective of a virus is to replicate its genetic information. The nature of the virus genome is therefore paramount in determining what steps are necessary to achieve this. In reality, a surprising amount of variation can occur in these processes, even for viruses with similar genome structures. The reason for this lies in compartmentalization, both of eukaryotic cells into nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments, and of genetic information and biochemical capacity between the virus genome and that of the host cell.",

For viruses of prokaryotes, replication to some extent reflects the relative simplicity of their host cells. For viruses with eukaryotic hosts, processes are frequently more complex. There are many examples of animal viruses undergoing different replicative cycles in different cell types; however, the coding capacity of the virus genome forces all viruses to choose a strategy for replication. This might be one involving heavy reliance on the host cell, in which case the virus genome can be very compact and need only encode the essential information for a few proteins (e.g., parvoviruses). Alternatively, large and complex virus genomes, such as those of poxviruses, encode most of the information necessary for replication, and the virus is only reliant on the cell for the provision of energy and the apparatus for macromolecular synthesis, such as ribosomes (see Chapter 1).",

            "text": "Bacteriophages have long been used by virologists as models to understand the biology of viruses. This is particularly true of virus replication. Two very significant experiments that illustrated the fundamental nature of viruses were performed on bacteriophages. The first of these was done by Ellis and Delbruck in 1939 and is usually referred to as the single-burst experiment or one-step growth curve (Figure 4.1) . This was the first experiment to show the three essential phases of virus replication: In this experiment, bacteriophage particles were added to a culture of rapidly growing bacteria, and after a period of a few minutes, the culture was diluted, effectively preventing further interaction between the phage particles and the cells. This simple step is the key to the entire experiment, because it effectively synchronizes the infection of the cells and allows the subsequent phases of replication in a population of individual cells and virus particles to be viewed as if they were a single interaction (in much the same way that molecular cloning of nucleic acids allows analysis of populations of nucleic acid molecules as single species). Repeated samples of the culture were taken at short intervals and analyzed for bacterial cells by plating onto agar plates and for phage particles by plating onto lawns of bacteria. As can be seen in Figure 4 .1, there is a stepwise increase in the concentration of phage particles with time, each increase in phage concentration representing one replicative cycle of the virus. However, the data from this experiment can also be analyzed in a different way, by plotting the number of plaque-forming units (p.f.u.) per bacterial cell against time (Figure 4 .2). In this type of assay, a plaque-forming unit can be either a single extracellular virus particle or an infected bacterial cell. These two can be distinguished by disruption of the bacteria with chloroform before plating, which releases any intracellular phage particles, thus providing the total virus count (i.e., intracellular plus extracellular particles). Several additional features of virus replication are visible from the graph in Figure 4 .2. Immediately after dilution of the culture, there is a phase of 10 to 15 minutes when no phage particles are detectable; this is known as the eclipse period. This represents a time when virus particles have broken down after penetrating cells, releasing their genomes as a prerequisite to replication. At this stage, they are no longer infectious and therefore cannot be detected by the plaque assay. The latent period is the time before the first new extracellular virus particles appear and is around 20 to 25 minutes for many bacteriophages. About 40 minutes after the cells have been infected, the curves for the total number of virus particles and for the extracellular virus merge because the infected cells have lysed and released any intracellular phage particles by this time. The yield (i.e., number) of particles produced per infected cell can be calculated from the overall rise in phage titre.",

The major difference between these viruses and bacteriophages is the much longer time interval required for replication, which is measured in terms of hours and, in some cases, days, rather than minutes. This difference reflects the much slower growth rate of eukaryotic cells and, in part, the complexity of virus replication in compartmentalized cells. Biochemical analysis of virus replication in eukaryotic cells has also been used to analyze the levels of virus and cellular protein and nucleic acid synthesis and to examine the intracellular events occurring during synchronized infections (Figure 4 .4). The use of various metabolic inhibitors also proved to be a valuable tool in such experiments. Examples of the use of such drugs will be discussed later in this chapter.",

            "text": "The second key experiment on virus replication using bacteriophages was performed by Hershey and Chase in 1952. Bacteriophage T2 was propagated in Escherichia coli cells that had been labeled with one of two radioisotopes, either 35 S, which is incorporated into sulphur-containing amino acids in proteins, or 32 P, which is incorporated into nucleic acids (which do not contain any sulphur; Figure 4 .5). Particles labeled in each of these ways were used to infect bacteria. After a short period to allow attachment to the cells, the mixture was homogenized briefly in a blender, which did not destroy the bacterial cells but was sufficiently vigorous to knock the phage coats off the outsides of the cells. Analysis of the radioactive content in the cell pellets and culture supernatant (containing the empty phage coats) showed that most of the radioactivity in the 35 S-labeled particles remained in the supernatant, while in the 32 P-labeled particles most of the radiolabel had entered the cells. This experiment proves that it was the DNA genome of the bacteriophage that entered the cells and initiated the infection rather than any other component (such as proteins). Although it might seem obvious now, at the time this experiment settled a great controversy over whether a structurally simple polymer such as a nucleic acid, which was known to contain only four monomers, was complex enough to carry genetic information. (At the time, it was generally believed that proteins, which consist of a much more complex mixture of more than 20 different amino acids, were the carriers of the genes and that DNA was probably a structural component of cells and viruses.) Together, these two experiments illustrate the essential processes of virus replication. Virus particles enter susceptible cells and release their genomic nucleic acids. These are replicated and packaged into virus particles consisting of newly synthesized virus proteins, which are then released from the cell. This figure shows a single-burst type of experiment for a picornavirus (e.g., poliovirus). This type of data can only be produced from synchronous infections where a high multiplicity of infection is used.",

Instead, plant viruses rely on a breach of the integrity of a cell wall to introduce a virus particle directly into a host cell.

In human rhinoviruses (HRVs), there is a deep cleft known as the canyon in the surface of each triangular face of the icosahedral capsid, which is formed by the flanking monomers, VP1, VP2, and VP3 (Figure 4 .8). Biochemical evidence from a class of inhibitory drugs that block attachment of HRV particles to cells indicates that the interaction between ICAM-1 and the virus particle occurs on the floor of this canyon. Unlike other areas of the virus surface, the amino acid residues forming the internal surfaces of the canyon are relatively invariant. It was suggested that these regions are protected from antigenic pressure because the antibody molecules are too large to fit into the cleft. This is important because radical changes here, although allowing the virus to escape an immune response, would disrupt receptor binding. Subsequently, it has been found that the binding site of the receptor extends well over the edges of the canyon, and the binding sites of neutralizing antibodies extend over the rims of the canyon. Nevertheless, the residues most significant for the binding site of the receptor and for neutralizing antibodies are separated from each other. In polioviruses, there is a similar canyon that runs around each five-fold vertex of the capsid. The highly variant regions of the capsid to which antibodies bind are located on the peaks on either side of this trough, which is again too narrow to allow antibody binding to the residues at its base. The invariant residues at the sides of the trough interact with the receptor.",

Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) has been reported to use the immunoglobulin molecule vascular cell adhesion factor (VCAM-1) or glycophorin A. Several picornaviruses use other integrins as receptors: some enteric cytopathic human orphan (ECHO) viruses use VLA-2 or fibronectin, and foot-and-mouth disease viruses (FMDVs) have been reported to use an unidentified integrin-like molecule. Other ECHO viruses use complement decay-accelerating factor (DAF, CD55), a molecule involved in complement regulation. This list is given to illustrate that even within one structurally closely related family of viruses, there is considerable variation in the receptor structures used. Another well-studied example of a virusereceptor interaction is that of influenza virus. The influenza virus hemagglutinin protein forms one of the two types of glycoprotein spikes on the surface of the particles (see Chapter 2), the other type being formed by the neuraminidase protein. Each hemagglutinin spike is composed of a trimer of three molecules, while the neuraminidase spike consists of a tetramer (Figure 4 .9). The hemagglutinin spikes are responsible for binding the influenza virus receptor, which is sialic acid (N-acetyl neuraminic acid), a sugar group commonly found on a variety of glycosylated molecules. As a result, little cell-type specificity is imposed by this receptor interaction so influenza viruses bind to a wide variety of different cell types (e.g., causing hemagglutination of red blood cells) in addition to the cells in which productive infection occurs.",

So tropism, the ability to infect a particular cell type, is largely controlled by receptor interactions. Going on from there, small changes can have big effects, so this process is important to understand in detail. At present, the H5N1 type of influenza virus can infect humans and when it does, it's likely to kill them, but it really struggles to do this because at the moment, it's really a bird (avian) virus. With a very small change in the receptor usage, H5N1 could become a deadly human virus. In addition, when you understand these processes, you can use them against the virus. We've had anti-influenza drugs for decades, but they weren't very good. Modern influenza drugs such as Tamiflu and Relenza inhibit the neuraminidase protein involved in receptor interactions (although in release from the cell rather than uptake). If H5N1 ever does make the jump to being a human virus, we're going to need these drugs to stay alive. the coxsackieviruseadenovirus receptor (CAR). Another virion protein, the penton base, then binds to the integrin family of cell-surface proteins, allowing internalization of the particle by receptor-mediated endocytosis. Most cells express primary receptors for the adenovirus fiber coat protein; however, the internalization step is more selective, giving rise to a degree of cell selection.",

Transfection of human cells that do not normally express CD4 (such as epithelial cells) with recombinant CD4-expression constructs makes them permissive for HIV infection; however, transfection of rodent cells with human CD4-expression vectors does not permit productive HIV infectiondsomething else is missing from the mouse cells. If HIV provirus DNA is inserted into rodent cells by transfection, virus is produced, showing that there is no intracellular block to infection. So there must be one or more accessory factors in addition to CD4 that are required to form a functional HIV receptor. These are a family of proteins known as b-chemokine receptors. Several members of this family have been shown to play a role in the entry of HIV into cells, and their distribution may be the primary control for the tropism of HIV for different cell types (lymphocytes, macrophages, etc.). Furthermore, there is evidence, in at least some cell types, that HIV infection is not blocked by competing soluble CD4, indicating that in these cells a completely different receptor strategy may be being used. Several candidate molecules have been put forward to fill this role (e.g., galactosylceramide and various other candidate proteins). However, if any or all of these do allow HIV to infect a range of CD4-negative cells, this process is much less efficient than the interaction of the virus with its major receptor complex.",

However, in the absence of some form of physical interaction that holds the virus particle in close association with the cell surface, the frequency with which these accidental events happen is very low. On occasion, antibody-coated virus particles binding to Fc receptor molecules on the surface of monocytes and other blood cells can result in virus uptake. This phenomenon has been shown to occur in a number of cases where antibody-dependent enhancement of virus uptake results in unexpected findings. For example, the presence of antivirus antibodies can occasionally result in increased virus uptake by cells and increased pathogenicity rather than virus neutralization, as would normally be expected. It has been suggested that this mechanism may also be important in the uptake of HIV by macrophages and monocytes and that this might be a factor in the pathogenesis of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), although this is not yet certain.",

This process is relatively rare among viruses and is poorly understood. It must be mediated by proteins in the virus capsid and specific membrane receptors. n Endocytosis of the virus into intracellular vacuoles (Figure 4 .11).

At this point, any virus contained within these structures is still cut off from the cytoplasm by a lipid bilayer and therefore has not strictly entered the cell. Moreover, as endosomes fuse with lysosomes, the environment inside these vessels becomes increasingly hostile as the pH falls, while the concentration of degradative enzymes rises. This means that the virus particle must leave the vesicle and enter the cytoplasm before it is degraded. There are a number of mechanisms by which this can occur, including membrane fusion and rescue by transcytosis.

The retrovirus core particle is composed of proteins from the gag gene, and the protease is packaged into the core before its release from the cell on budding. At some stage of the budding process (the exact timing varies for different retroviruses) the protease cleaves the gag protein precursors into the mature productsdthe capsid, nucleocapsid, and matrix proteins of the mature virus particle (Figure 4.21) . Not all protease cleavage events involved in maturation are this tightly regulated. Native influenza virus hemagglutinin undergoes posttranslational modification (glycosylation in the Golgi apparatus) and at this stage exhibits receptor-binding activity. However, the protein must be cleaved into two fragments (HA 1 and HA 2 ) to be able to produce membrane fusion during infection. Cellular trypsin-like enzymes are responsible for this process, which occurs in secretory vesicles as the virus buds into them prior to release at the cell surface. Amantadine and rimantadine are two drugs that are active against influenza A viruses (Chapter 6). The action of these closely related compounds is complex, but they block cellular membrane ion channels. The target for both drugs is the influenza matrix protein (M2), but resistance to the drug may also map to the hemagglutinin gene. The replication of some strains of influenza virus is inhibited at the penetration stage and that of others at maturation. The biphasic action of these drugs results from the inability of drug-treated cells to lower the pH of the endosomal compartment (a function normally controlled by the M2 gene product), and hence to cleave hemagglutinin during maturation. Similarly, retrovirus envelope glycoproteins require cleavage into the surface (SU) and transmembrane (TM) proteins for activity. This process is also carried out by cellular enzymes but in general is poorly understood, but it is a target for inhibitors that may act as antiviral drugs.",

All other viruses escape the cell by one of two mechanisms. For lytic viruses (such as most nonenveloped viruses), release is a simple processdthe infected cell breaks open and releases the virus. Enveloped viruses acquire their lipid membrane as the virus buds out of the cell through the cell membrane or into an intracellular vesicle prior to subsequent release. Virion envelope proteins are picked up during this process as the virus particle is extruded. This process is known as budding. Release of virus particles in this way may be highly damaging to the cell (e.g., paramyxoviruses, rhabdoviruses, and togaviruses), or in other cases, appear not to be (e.g., retroviruses), but in either case the process is controlled by the virus. The physical interaction of the capsid proteins on the inner surface of the cell membrane forces the particle out through the membrane (Figure 4 .15). As mentioned earlier, assembly, maturation, and release are usually simultaneous processes for virus particles formed by budding. The type of membrane from which the virus buds depends on the virus concerned. In most cases, budding involves cytoplasmic membranes (retroviruses, togaviruses, orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, bunyaviruses, coronaviruses, rhabdoviruses, hepadnaviruses) but in some cases can involve the nuclear membrane (herpesviruses).",

These structures have been subverted by human retroviruses that engineer a novel structure in infected cells known as a virological synapse to promote more efficient spread within the host organism.",

            "text": "The release of mature virus particles from susceptible host cells by budding presents a problem in that these particles are designed to enter, rather than leave, cells. How do these particles manage to leave the cell surface? The details are not known but there are clues as to how the process is achieved. Certain virus envelope proteins are involved in the release phase of replication as well as in the initiating steps. A good example of this is the neuraminidase protein of influenza virus. In addition to being able to reverse the attachment of virus particles to cells via hemagglutinin, neuraminidase is also believed to be important in preventing the aggregation of influenza virus particles and may well have a role in virus release. This process is targeted by newer drugs such as oseltamivir (trade name Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza; Chapter 6). In recent years, a group of proteins known as viroporins has been discovered in a range of different viruses. These are proteins that modify the permeability of cellular membranes and promote the release of viral particles from infected cells. These proteins are usually not essential for the replication of viruses, but their presence often enhances virus growth.",

Proteins with hydrophobic (water-fearing) domains don't like to be in a soluble form within the cytoplasm. They only start to act when they're in the natural environment of a membrane. But it's not even that simple. There are different domains within membranes where different processes occur. Viruses have used these \"lipid rafts\" for particular functions, such as entering or leaving the cell, and forming tiny factories where new particles are assembled. And then there's time. Virus replication doesn't happen in a random orderdit is carefully sequenced to optimize the process. This control is directed by the biochemistry of the components involved, which may only start to function as their concentration within an infected cell reaches a critical level. And all of this goes on within the minute world of an infected cell, too small to see with the eye alone, or even the most powerful microscope.",
