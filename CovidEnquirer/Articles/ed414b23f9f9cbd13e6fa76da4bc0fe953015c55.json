Efficacy of peritoneal drains for continual effusion of abdominal fluid may be enhanced by placement of multiple drains and by intermittent or continuous peritoneallavage. Cytologic evaluation of the effluent measures the patient's progress and determines when the drains may be removed.

The introduction of foreign material into the peritoneal cavity causes an increase in inflammatory response and formation of adhesions. Drains may be directly damaging to abdominal viscera by erosion of the serosal surface. Problems with peritoneal lavage are associated with the introduction and removal of large amounts of fluid and loss of cells, protein, and electrolytes. The most likely complications are anemia, hypoproteinemia, hypokalemia, hyponatremia, and hypocalcemia. Hypothermia is easily avoided by the use of warm lavage fluids. Sterile occlusive dressings around the drain sites may minimize the risk of ascending infection. Open abdominal drainage is believed to provide a more rapid and more effective means of drainage of the peritoneal cavity. The obvious risks are infection and sepsis as well as dehiscence and evisceration. but this can be avoided by frequent sterile bandage changes and close observation of the patient. At surgery, the abdomen is incompletely closed by loose apposition of the external rectus sheath in a simple continuous pattern. Subcutaneous tissue and skin may be left open or closed depending on the amount of local contamination. Sterile dressings are placed over the incision and secured to the patient with a circumferential abdominal wrap. This bandage should be changed as often as necessary, typically once or twice a day, and the quantity and appearance of the fluid should be evaluated. A major disadvantage is that this technique requires at least a second surgical procedure for completing abdominal closure. However, it also allows a second look to assess organ viability and surgical repairs and provides an opportunity for additional intraoperative lavage. Other complications include significant fluid and protein loss, resulting in hypovolemia, anemia, and hypoproteinemia. These conditions need to be recognized and treated appropriately.

            "text": "The use of corticosteroids in septic animals remains controversial. Benefits of steroids include stabilization of vascular and lysosomal membranes, reduced adhesion formation, positive cardiac inotropic effect, and increased regional blood flow. Disadvantages to steroid use include gastrointestinal ulceration and potential immunosuppression in the face of potential infection. NSAIDs block prostacyclin and thromboxane A 2 production, which may contribute to multiple organ failure. These drugs may also be helpful in treating acute endotoxic or septic shock. Flunixin meglamine (Banamine) has been shown to be beneficial in experimental models of septic peritonitis. However, the risk of adverse effects of NSAlDs, such as gastrointestinal ulceration and renal toxicity, makes their use in animals with septic peritonitis controversial.",
