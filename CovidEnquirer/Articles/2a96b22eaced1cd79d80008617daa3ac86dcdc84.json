Lesion density was assessed based on the proportion of ground-glass opacity (GGO), consolidation and fibrosis of the lesions. The parameters obtained using the computer tool included lung volume (mL), lesion volume (mL), lesion percentage (%), and mean lesion density (HU) of the whole lung, right lung, left lung, and each lobe. The scores obtained by the radiologists and quantitative results generated by the computer software were tested for correlation. A Chi-square test was used to test the consistency of radiologist-and computer-derived lesion percentage in the right/left lung, upper/lower lobe, and each of the 5 lobes. Result: The results showed a strong to moderate correlation between lesion percentage scores obtained by radiologists and the computer software (r ranged from 0.7679 to 0.8373, P< 0.05), and a moderate correlation between the proportion of GGO and mean lesion density (r = -0.5894, P < 0.05), and proportion of consolidation and mean lesion density (r = 0.6282, P < 0.05).",

The second step was the segmentation of pulmonary vessels (shown in B, the vessels are colored blue). After the subtraction of the pulmonary vessels from the lung regions, the fourth and final step was the segmentation of pneumonia lesions (shown in C).The red irregular nodular shapes were observed as a result of this lesion segmentation. 200% \u2020Upper lobes were the general name of the right upper lobe, the right middle lobe, and the left upper lobe. \u2021Lower lobes were the general name of the right lower lobe and the left lower lobe.

CT signs, GGO, consolidation, and fibrosis manifest differently over the course of the disease [21] and have different density ranges. This study shows that the proportion of consolidation increases with mean lesion density, and the proportion of GGOs, decreases with mean lesion density.However, the distribution of lower lobe lesions obtained by computer-aided quantification significantly differed from radiologist-derived results (\u03c7 2 =8.160, df = 1, P = 0.004). This could be due to the smaller volume and weight of the upper lobes than of the lower lobes and may have resulted in the under-or overestimation of the volume of lesions in the bilateral lower or upper lobes, respectively. The lesion distribution in the right and left side obtained by the radiologist and computer software showed no significant difference, nor did the distribution of lesions among the five lobes.
