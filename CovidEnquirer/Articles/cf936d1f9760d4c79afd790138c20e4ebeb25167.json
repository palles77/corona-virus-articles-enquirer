Its major risk is dehydration. However, for some patients, diarrhea can lead to severe dehydration or be associated with bacteremia and metastatic infection. Patients with these conditions requhe prompt treatment, A large number of organisms have been associated with diarrhea in humans, and most laboratories routinely screen for Salmonella, ShigelEa, and Campylobacter. Other bacteria, parasites, and viruses account for a signihcant percentage of diarrhea cases and frequently go undetected.

These cysts survive well at cold temperatures. Outbreaks, particularly in the Rocky Mountain areas, have occurred because of inadequate treatment of this surface water before it is consumed. Chlorination alone is adequate to eradicate Giardia cysts. However, flocculation, sedimentation, and filtration of public water supplies are also recommended for added safety. Appropriate precautions for wilderness campers and travelers to areas without adequate treatment facilities include boiling water for at least 10 minutes (longer at higher altitudes), chemical treatment (chlorine or iodine), or filtration with pore sizes of 2 pm or less. Campers should be reminded that careful treatment of drinking water is not enough. The water used to wash fruits and vegetables and that used for tooth brushing should be similarly treated to avoid infection. Ice made of contaminated water remains a risk. Ice has been a documented source of infection with Escherichia coli, Norwalk virus, and vibrio cholera.'2T13 Travelers frequently make the mistake of drinking bottled water with ice that is locally available and made from inadequately treated water. Even when water meets all current treatment requirements, it may still contain pathogens. To test the hypothesis that further treatment would decrease the incidence of diarrhea, Payment et all4 added water filters to 299 households and compared the incidence of diarrhea to 307 households drinking regular tap water.

The authors found that in Cardiff, Wales, Cumpylobacter was isolated from 5 people who were among 29 customers that visited a restaurant with a Hawaiian theme. Twelve of these patrons became ill with gastroenteritis. Food-specific attack rates implicated chicken as the vehicle (relative risk 4.81, 95% confidence interval), and all Campylobacter isolates were of the same serotype (HS50 phage type 49). As is the case with most food-borne outbreaks, all individuals who ate the contaminated food did not become ill. Sometimes this is because the contaminated food was eaten at different times, and those that ate the food later ingested a larger dose of organisms because of the organisms' continued growth on the food. Alternatively, differences among individuals make some more prone to infection than others (see Pathophysiology below). The authors postulated that the food implicated in this outbreak might have been inadequately cooked because large pieces of chicken were being stir-fried. Also reported in that study is that there were 6 additional Campylobacter isolates of the same serotype identified in Cardiff during the months immediately preceding the outbreak, suggesting that this occurrence may have not been an isolated event.

            "text": "Because poultry is so frequently a vehicle for CumpyZobacter, the method and timing of the contamination of poultry flocks with Cumpylobacter is important because it may lead to improved prevention strategies. Wallace et all6 have shown that turkey chicks are born without the organism but that colonization begins by day 7 and is 100% by day 14. Campylobacter was found throughout the length of the bird's gastrointestinal tract, with the highest concentration found furthest from the beak. Flocks of laying hens and uncooked chickens from grocery stores are also frequently colonized with Salmonella. This has led to several strategies for preventing the spread of the organism, ranging from the use of antibiotics in the animals to the irradiation of the food products that come from them. Thorough cooking of poultry is a more effective and cost-efficient approach. However, it should be noted that even with thorough cooking, any surface (such as a cutting board) where the raw birds are prepared might be a source for the cross-contamination of other food. 17 Given the high rate of the contamination of flocks of laying hens with Salmonella and Campylobacter, it should not be surprising that eggs are frequently contaminated with these organisms. In 1978, the New England area experienced an increase in cases of Salmonella enteritides. However, it wasn't until an outbreak in 1986 that involved 3000 people across 7 states that Salmonella in flocks of laying hens was clearly linked to subsequent sporadic and outbreak cases.18y19 By 1986 the number of S enteritidis cases was markedly increased in the entire mid-Atlantic area and, by 1994, this increased incidence had spread along the length of the country to the Pacific Coast. 2o Infected eggs will not necessarily have visible cracks or be of inferior quality in any measurable way. An outbreak in Tennessee demonstrated that chickens that are colonized with the bacteria can transmit infection to humans even when their eggs are inspected as Grade A and are completely intact.21 Today, S enteritidis accounts for approximately 25% of all SaZmoneZZa infections. The consumption of raw eggs in cake batter, Caesar salad dressing, mousse, and sunny-side up or soft-boiled eggs is clearly a risk. The use of pasteurized egg products is recommended for institutions as a means of decreasing this risk.",

At times an outbreak may only be detected above background baseline levels of infection because of the predominance of an unusual serotype or susceptibility pattern. New pathogens are being identified as important causes of human diseases. An optimal response to these pathogens requires a coordinated approach that involves both local and national public health officials and industry. Although final inspection of products and goods was the main quality strategy of the past, hazard analysis and the determination of critical control points is now preferred.

The main host defenses against the acquisition of enteric disease are (1) gastric acidity; (2) small bowel motility; (3) local antibody formation; and (4) the colonic microflora. The normal fasting gastric pH of less than 4 is a very effective barrier to infection with ingested organisms. At this pH level there is a greater than 99% eradication of most diarrhea-causing bacteria within 30 minutes. Many viruses and parasites are similarly affected. Neutralization of this pH barrier with antacids or gastric resection or neutralization that is caused by achlorhydria greatly decreases the number of organisms necessary to cause disease. This also explains why many people may eat the same contaminated meal and only some become ill. Even if all individuals ate the specific item that was contaminated, they may have significant differences in their gastric pH at the time of ingestion. For example, if gravy on meat was contaminated and this was eaten first, that individual would have maximum stomach acidity to combat this infection. However, if several rolls were eaten before the contaminated gravy, stomach acidity would be buffered, which would allow for a greater susceptibility to infection by a smaller number of organisms.",

Diarrhea1 pathogens produce several types of toxins. Enterotoxins may be produced on the food before it is ingested and act at the level of the small bowel. There the enterotoxin increases local cyclic adenosine monophosphate and, through a series of chemical reactions, leads to changes in sodium and potassium absorption and a net movement of fluid into the gut lumen. This secretory diarrhea can produce voluminous fluid loss, many liters per day. Enterotoxin production is the main mechanism of diarrhea produced by Cholera, enterotoxigenic E coli, Clostridium perji-ingens, and Bacillus cereus. Neurotoxins contribute to the symptoms of gastroenteritis with the use of a different mechanism. They act on the autonomic nervous system and cause hyperperistalsis, and they may also act centrally as a stimulant to emesis. Staphylococcus food-poisoning toxin and one of the toxins associated with B cereus act in this manner. These toxins also are frequently formed on the contaminated food before it is ingested. Cytotoxins represent a third type of toxin that is associated with gastrointestinal pathogens. Unlike enterotoxins and neurotoxins, cytotoxins cause direct mucosal damage. These toxins are usually formed inside the body by the ingested organism and act at the level of the colon.",

            "text": "The incubation period is an important clue to the organism causing the symptoms, but it is often very difficult to ascertain this information from most patients because the incriminating meal has not been identified. Patients will often link the illness to a food that \"tasted funny\" or to the only meal that they ate away from their family because no other family members are ill. However, it is important to remember that contaminated food often smells and tastes normal and that not all people who eat con- taminated food will become ill. These conjectures by the patient typically do not help determine the incubation period or the responsible food vehicle. The one instance in which the history alone can fix the incubation period is when multiple persons become ill after eating a common meal. If they have had no other meals together, this strongly implicates the 1 meal they had in common and identifies the incubation period as the time from the meal to the onset of the symptoms. The physical examination should include focused attention to the findings that might narrow the differential diagnosis or dictate immediate therapy needs. Careful evaluation of the patient's fluid status is paramount because dehydration is the major cause of morbidity and mortality. Orthostatic blood pressure and pulse should be measured. Skin tenting and the observed finding of \"sunken eyeballs\" are less accurate findings. The presence of fever suggests an invasive pathogen. Fever is not usually associated with organisms that act solely by means of enterotoxin production, so this finding is helpful for narrowing down the number of organisms under consideration. Hypoactive bowel sounds and severe abdominal pain are ominous findings and may precede the more classic findings of a surgical abdomen. When dealing with a case of diarrhea, a patient's progression to hypoactive bowel sounds and distension should raise the consideration of toxic megacolon. An x-ray of the abdomen is helpful in the diagnosis of this condition, and it usually shows dilation of the transverse colon that is 6 cm or more. Toxic megacolon may be seen as a complication of any of the invasive pathogens. Noninfectious causes include inflammatory bowel disease, volvulus, and ischemic colitis. About a third of the cases of toxic megacolon that complicate ulcerative colitis occur during the patient's first episode.25 Jaundice is not usually associated with gastrointestinal pathogens and should suggest the possibility of a different primary process. When jaundice is seen in a traveler, malaria should be considered, because a significant percentage of patients with malaria present with diarrhea and other abdominal symptoms in addition to the jaundice more commonly associated with that illness. The presence of a rash is also not typical of most primary gastrointestinal infections and should suggest a primary process outside the gut lumen. Some types of viral gastroenteritis may be associated with a nonspecific erythematous rash, and about a third of SuZmonelZu typhi infections are associated with a pink maculopapular rash (rose spots) on the trunk. 26 Hemorrhagic bullae are associated with infection with Vibrio vulnljkus. 27 Although most patients have diarrhea as part of this syndrome, it is usually an illness characterized by bacteremia and septic shock. Most patients have a preexisting liver disease, such as cirrhosis. Despite these examples, the presence of a rash should direct the clinician to other considerations such as toxic shock syndrome, meningococcal disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, viral exanthem, or a drug reaction. Each of these processes can have diarrhea as part of the constellation of presenting symptoms and findings. This underscores the need to broadly evaluate the patient before focusing on the gastrointestinal tract as the main site of infection.",

Examination of the stool of these patients reveals no white or red blood cells, and the patients have a low risk of bacteremia. The organisms that cause this syndrome usually act by amplifying an enterotoxin or neurotoxin. Because the toxin is often already formed on the food and the site of action is the small bowel, the incubation period is short, usually 6 to 12 hours. Because the organism may not even be present in large numbers at the time of toxin ingestion and because the organism does not have invasive properties, there is rarely a local inflammatory reaction (white blood cells in the stool) or a systemic inflammatory reaction (fever). For these same reasons, bacteremia is rare. Type I organisms include Staphylococcus uureus, Cperfringens, enterotoxigenic E coli, enteroaggregative E coli, diffusely adherent E coli, Cryptosporidium, and Giurdiu lumbliu. Type II is a diarrhea characterized by fever and by the finding of cells when the stool is microscopically examined. The organisms that cause this type of diarrhea act at the level of the colon and, once there, attach to and invade tissue. This explains their longer incubation of 1 to 3 days. Type II organisms frequently augment a cytotoxin or have other invasive properties that lead to a local and inflammatory host reaction (eg, blood cells in the stool, fever). Organisms in this group include ShigeZZu, Salmonella, Campylobacter, Yersinia, enteroinvasive E coli, and E histolytica.",

It has since been identified as the cause of nearly 50% of travelers' diarrhea,28 and it has also been found to be a common cause of diarrhea in infants. ETEC organisms cause diarrhea by the amplification of 1 or more enterotoxins, and these enterotoxins have been characterized as a heatstable toxin and a heat-labile toxin. Genes that have been found on transferable plasmids code for these toxins. An E coli organism may have one, both, or neither of these toxins. The heat-labile toxin has antigenic similarity to the cholera enterotoxin. 2g As with other enterotoxin-mediated infectious diarrhea, the main syndrome that develops is a watery afebrile diarrhea that is usually self-limited and lasts 1 to 4 days. ETEC is not usually considered to be a cause of diarrhea that is acquired in the United States. Because most microbiology laboratories do not routinely screen for this organism, the incidence of this disease is difficult to estimate. A recent report about a food-borne outbreak demonstrated that ETEC was also a cause of diarrhea in patients who had not been traveling.30 ETEC organisms were isolated from 5 people who had attended a labor union banquet in Milwaukee with attendees from throughout the United States. An estimated 61% of the 1240 attendees met the case definition of 3 or more loose stools within a 24-hour period, with the first occurring within 3 days of the event. Because attendees had dispersed back to their home states only a small number were available for testing, but the isolation of ETEC from 5 of the attendees and the fact that no other pathogen was identified confirmed it as the cause. As newer methods of identifying these toxin-producing pathogens are developed, it is likely that part of the relatively large percentage of diarrhea illnesses that are \"culture negative\" will be diagnosed.",

This serotype accounts for the majority of diagnosed cases of enterohemorrhagic colitis, but serotypes such as 026:Hll and 0113:H21 can also cause this disease. The cause of this syndrome is a cytotoxin. The organism has been associated with several different cytotoxins, each of which can cause the same syndrome. The toxins are so similar to the Shiga-toxin of ShigeZZa dysenteria they are called \"Shiga-like toxins.\" A review by the Centers for Disease Control and the Washington State Department of Social and Health Services demonstrated that this organism was also associated with a nonbloody diarrhea and asymptomatic carriage. 33 EHEC organisms are associated with hemolytic uremic syndrome (IBIS). This syndrome includes the triad of thrombocytopenia, acute renal failure, and hemolytic anemia. HUS is also seen in children with severe ShigeZZa infection and therefore may be related to some effect of the Shiga-like toxin. Unlike ShigeZZa, HUS caused by EHEC is not confined to children but may be seen in patients of all ages. Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is also associated with preceding EHEC infection. About half of the patients diagnosed with HUS will require dialysis, and most will need transfusions.34 There is no evidence that antibiotic treatment during the diarrhea infection will decrease the incidence of subsequent HUS or thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. In fact, some investigators have suggested that antibiotic therapy could increase the risk of these conditions by altering protective gut flora and increasing toxin production.35 Outbreaks of EHEC have been associated with eating undercooked hamburger meat, drinking apple cider, and swimming water contaminated with feces.36l37 Recent hamburger ingestion is also a risk factor for sporadic cases.38 Because handling raw beef is a risk, careful handwashing and cleaning of preparation surfaces are important prevention strategies.

Shigella infections have played a major part in times of war, with a greater number of casualties attributed to this infection than to bullets and explosives. ShigeZZa causes an invasive syndrome in the colon, and it includes fever. In a study of experimental infection with Shigella sonnei, the height of the fever correlated with the severity of the illness. 4o ShigeZZa bacteremia is relatively rare but does occur. Risk factors are an age of less than 1 year and protein malnutrition. 41 ShigeZZa may also cause chronic vulvovaginitis in children.42 The recognition of this diagnosis is important because it may otherwise be wrongly diagnosed as a sexually transmitted disease. Finally, as noted previously, ShigeZZa has been associated with the subsequent development of HUS in children. 43 Yersiniu enterocolitim. In many parts of the world, Y enterucolitica rivals Salmonella in the frequency of the number of times it is isolated from the stool of patients with diarrhea. The Scandinavian countries, Belgium, Canada, and Japan have the highest rates of isolation of this organism. In these countries, serotype 0:3 and 0:9 are the most common isolates. In the United States, serotype 0:8 predominates. Yersinia grows at room temperature, body temperature, and 4\u00b0C (refrigeration temperature). This ability to grow at cold temperatures has proved useful in the microbiology laboratory for the selective growth of Yersinia from a specimen; it also may be a factor in the food-borne outbreaks where small amounts of contamination may become more significant even when the food has been adequately refrigerated. Yersinia has been isolated from animals, lake and stream water, and a variety of foods, and person-toperson spread does occur. Pigs are a particularly important reservoir. Yersinia has been isolated from pig tonsils and intestines,44 and an outbreak in Atlanta in 1988 was traced to the household preparation of chitterlings (pig intestines). 45 Transfusion-associated Yersinia has also been reported. In 1991, the Centers for Disease Control reported that 10 cases of transfusion-associated Y enterocolitica occurred between 1987 and 1991. These cases were reported from 9 different states, and 7 of these 10 patients died from the infection. The transfusions they had received were packed red blood cells that had been stored at 4\u00b0C for a mean of 33 days. 46 Patients developed fever and hypotension within 50 minutes of transfusion.

There are over 2000 serotypes of Salmonella, many of which are named for the animal from which the organism was first isolated or for the city in which it was first identified. Not all of these serotypes are pathogenic for humans. S typhimutium, S enteritidis, and Salmonella heidelberg are common isolates in the United States. Enterotoxins and cytotoxins have been isolated from Salmonella species, but the main mechanism of diarrhea appears to be a combination of the penetration of the mucosa and of an inflammatory/immune response. Salmonella can survive inside phagocytes, which provide a protected intracellular site for survival and for the avoidance of other host defense measures. Bacteremia is a more common complication of Salmonella infection than other enteric infections, and patients with defects in cell-mediated immunity (eg, AIDS, high-dose steroid therapy, lymphoma) and those with hemolytic illnesses (eg, sickle cell disease) are at increased risk. 47 Persistent bacteremia, often with few gastrointestinal symptoms, has also been reported, and this syndrome is often caused by Salmonella choleraesuis.

Typhoid fever is caused by S typhi, an organism that is only found in humans. Abdominal pain, fever, and bacteremia characterize this infection. Approximately 80% of patients are bacteremic during the first week of illness, and bone marrow cultures can be positive in up to 90% of cases. The bacteria's ability to penetrate the mucosa and survive in Peyer's patches in the ileum is associated with a 2% to 5% risk of intestinal perforation. This complication usually occurs during the second or third week of illness and carries a 40% mortality rate. 49 The enteric fever syndrome (typhoidal syndrome) can also be seen with infection caused by Salmonella paratyphi. Patients who have excreted the organism in the stool or urine for 1 year or more are identified as chronic carriers. Most chronic carriers are asymptomatic, but they may 288 DM, July 1999 need treatment if they have an occupation, such as a job in food preparation, that poses a risk for transmission to others. Vibrio cholera. Vibrio organisms are curved gram-negative rods that are morphologically similar to Cumpylobacter. Vibrio organisms are commonly found in surface water, and inadequate sanitation and water purification methods are the main contributors to proliferation of the bacteria. V cholera is the classic enterotoxin-mediated watery diarrhea pathogen. The volume of fluid loss is so significant that a previously healthy person may die within hours of the onset of this type of diarrhea unless appropriate fluid replacement therapy is provided. The World Health Organization's oral rehydration fluid therapy, which contains sodium chloride, sodium bicarbonate, potassium chloride, and glucose, can be life-saving even for severely ill patients.",

Up to 25% of diarrhea acquired in the hospital is caused by this pathogen. 50~51 The most important risk factor for the development of this infection is treatment with antibiotics. The organism is a spore-forming gram-positive anaerobic rod. It is found in the stool of about 3% of healthy persons and in a much higher percentage of newborns. C dificile produces an enterotoxin (toxin A) and a cytotoxin (toxin B). Although the organism itself does not invade the mucosa and bacteremia is rare, mucosal ulceration secondary to cytotoxin activity is commonly seen. In severe disease, pseudomembranes can form (pseudomembranous colitis). The incidence of this disease is highest among the elderly. Recently, tube feedings, especially postpyloric feedings, were found to be an additional risk.52 Numerous strategies to decrease the incidence of this disease have been tried and have including barrier precautions, promotion of handwashing, and training about the use of antibiotics. Nearly every antimicrobial agent has been associated with the subsequent development of this infection, although clindamycin (Cleocin; Upjohn Co, Kalamazoo, Mich) has been linked most closely. A recent study from the Veteran's Administration Hospital at the Medical College of Virginia and Virginia Commonwealth University demonstrated that the formulary restriction of clindamycin is an effective way of reducing cases in a setting where clindamycin use is identified as risk before intervention.53 Listeriu monocytogenes. L monocytogenes has, until recently, been thought of primarily as a cause of bacteremia and meningitis in immunocompromised patients. However, several recent studies have demonstrated that in many cases the organism can be acquired through the consumption of contaminated food. Soft cheeses and foods such as cold cuts from a deli counter have been shown to be the most common vehicles.54 Inadequately pasteurized milk has also been associated with foodborne outbreaks. Diarrhea from these sources may affect all hosts, but invasive disease with bacteremia is much more common in the immunocompromised host.

Clinical viral gastroenteritis is similar to an enterotoxin-mediated diarrhea with the sudden onset of watery diarrhea that does not include fecal cells. However, unlike bacterial enterotoxin illnesses, viral gastroenteritis is more commonly associated with fever. Rotavirus is usually a wintertime illness that is worse in young children; it accounts for about half of hospital admissions for diarrhea in children. The incubation period is 1 to 3 days, and the illness may last a week or more. Norwalk virus has a shorter incubation period (< 24 hours) and involves all age groups, and community outbreaks account for a significant percentage of the cases of the illness.

These organisms are larger than viruses or bacteria and, therefore, are usually diagnosed by staining a stool specimen and observing it under a microscope. In the United States, the most commonly isolated of the parasites is G Zumbliu. The exact mechanism of diarrhea in giardiasis 290 is not known. Giardia does not produce an enterotoxin or cytotoxin, and it is not invasive. Deconjugation of bile salts by an associated bacterial overgrowth may play a role. The syndrome is a noninflammatory malabsorptive diarrhea. After an incubation period of 1 to 3 weeks, patients develop bloating, steatorrhea, and nausea. Patients are afebrile, and examination of the stool for blood cells is negative. If left untreated, symptoms may wax and wane, but they often persist for weeks or months. The cyst is the infectious form of the organism, and the ingestion of only a small number of cysts can cause disease. E histolyticu is the causative agent of amebiasis. Unlike giardiasis, amebiasis is an invasive illness, and it affects the large bowel. Patients experience a gradual onset of illness, but once it has fully developed, the clinical picture is similar to that of S dysenteriae or enteroinvasive E coli. Fever and gross blood and pus in the stool are common. Extraintestinal disease may complicate amebic colitis.

In general most people with diarrhea do not have a bacterial pathogen, and even when they do, stool cultures are often negative.61 Nevertheless it may be important from a public health standpoint, as well as for the treatment of the individual patient, to determine if that patient has a bacterial pathogen. An approach used to distinguish those patients who are more likely to have a pathogen from those not likely to have a pathogen has been to look for white blood cells in the stool. Microscopic examination of stool samples that have demonstrated the presence of fecal leukocytes suggests that the diarrhea has an inflammatory cause and that it is caused specifically by organisms such as Shigella, Salmonella, Campylobacter, or C dificile.62~63 However, the use of fecal leukocyte detection has several limitations.64-66 First of all, the smear must be performed on a fresh specimen; a delay in processing the sample results in lysis of the fecal leukocytes. Even if fresh specimens are examined, accurate microscopy is very dependent on the skill and expertise of the microscopist. Some have questioned whether the presence of white blood cells in the stool has proved to be of any clinical use.\"- 66 Choi et al@' have developed a fecal lactoferrin latex agglutination assay to help determine if fecal leukocytes are indeed present in the stool. This, in general, appears to be much more sensitive than fecal leukocyte microscopy, and it may help to determine which people should have fecal cultures obtained. 67 Although stool cultures are considered to be the gold standard for the diagnosis of bacterial causes of gastroenteritis, their clinical use is limited to organisms that are routinely cultured. Most laboratories only attempt to culture for Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter. Common organisms that can cause diarrhea, such as enteroinvasive E coli and enterotoxigenic E coli, are not routinely looked for. Unusual organisms such as Yersinia species and Vibrio species, which may be important in certain locations, are not routinely tested for. Therefore it is important to obtain information from the patient about recent travel and to know the local epidemiology of diarrhea-producing pathogens. For example, if a person has recently traveled to the states along the Gulf of Mexico and eaten oysters, examining the stool for Vibrio may be important. If a person presents with gross blood in the stool, then enterohemorrhagic E coli may be a possible cause. The laboratory must be informed of these concerns so that appropriate testing can be performed. Routine culture for these organisms is otherwise not indicated.67 Stool examination for ova and parasites should be performed if a patient has 292 recently traveled outside of the United States and also if a patient is potentially immunosuppressed; these tests should also be performed for male homosexuals with acute diarrhea. Otherwise stool examination for ova and parasites should not be routinely obtained unless the diarrhea persists despite negative bacterial cultures. 64 Stool examination for C d@ciZe should only be performed in hospitalized patients and only for patients who have been on antibiotics during the preceding 30 day@; it is not cost-effective to check stool for C dijficile in any other patient population. As a corollary, it is not cost-effective to routinely test for stool pathogens or for ova and parasites in a patient in the hospital or in a patient who has been on antibiotics during the preceding 30 days.64y65 Diarrhea in these situations is almost always related to C dificile. Stool examination for ova and parasites and for enteric pathogens should be limited to patients who are otherwise immunosuppressed, to those who have a negative result despite continued symptoms, and to times of a known outbreak of a bacterial pathogen in the hospital or the community.",

Currently the cell cytotoxin assay is the most specific test, and the stool culture is the most sensitive test. However, neither one of these studies has a rapid turnaround, and both are associated with excessive cost and time commitments. More rapid assays such as the enzyme immunoassay for detecting toxin A and B are specific, but they are much less sensitive than the cell cytotoxin assay.

Because most of these organisms are spread by person-to-person contact, it is important to eliminate reservoirs of these bacteria whenever possible. Unfortunately there are few data that support the routine use of antiinfective antibiotics for most patients with bacterial gastroenteritis. More than half of the patients who develop bacterial gastroenteritis improve within 2 days even without specific therapy.60 It has also been shown that antibiotics do not reduce the duration of diarrhea or fever in patients with Salmonella gastroenteritis, and they may increase the risk for bacterial relapse. 69 The typical goal of the treatment of gastroenteritis is supportive therapy with hydration; this usually involves oral rehydration methods, although intravenous rehydration may be necessary in certain situations. Nonspecific treatment to decrease bowel motility and improve symptoms is another option. In the past, drugs that decrease bowel motility have been discouraged because of the possibility that they might worsen symptoms or decrease the clearance of the bacteria. The use of loperamide in the setting of travelers' diarrhea that is primarily caused by enterotoxigenic E coli has shown that use of loperamide with ciprofloxacin was the most effective treatment. 70 However, similar studies are not available for infections caused by an invasive organism such as Salmonella, Shigella, or Campylobacter or for C d@cileassociated diarrhea.

A major potential problem is the increasing incidence of antimicrobial resistance in organisms such as Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter.71~72 Campylobacter are routinely resistant to most antibiotics, with the exceptions of macrolides and quinolones, and an increasing incidence of quinolone resistance has been noted in several countries, which has been attributed to the use of 294 DM, July 1999 quinolones in animal feed. [73] [74] [75] In addition, Salmonella that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases have been reported. These organisms are also often quinolone-resistant, and quinolone-resistant Shigella have recently been described. 75 Many of these organisms were also resistant to unrelated classes of antibiotics such as tetracychnes, cephalosporins, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Because of all of this information, the routine empiric use of antibiotics-including quinolones-for the treatment of bacterial gastroenteritis needs to be reevaluated. Unlike those with community-acquired gastroenteritis, most patients with C difJiciZe-associated diarrhea will require specific therapy. Metronidazole and vancomycin are effective agents that are currently available in the United States. Metronidazole is currently considered the drug of choice because its clinical efficacy is comparable with that of vancomycin69; it is also much less expensive than oral vancomycin, and there is some concern about the development of glycopeptide resistance in enterococci with the use and overuse of oral vancomycin. Metronidazole in doses of 250 mg 4 times day or in doses of 500 mg 3 times a day can be useful. An alternative choice is a 125 mg dose of vancomycin 4 times a day. There is no need to obtain a stool sample from patients with C dilgicile-associated diarrhea at the end of treatment unless symptoms recur. Approximately 5% to 30% of patients will develop recurrent symptoms, regardless of initial therapy. These patients usually respond to the same drug that was used to treat them initially. A very small percentage of patients will have multiple relapses of C d@ciZeassociated diarrhea. The optimal management of such patients is not known at this time. Some physicians recommend the combination of vancomycin and rifampin for 10 days, but there are no comparative data currently available. 68 Making a diagnosis of cause in cases of bacterial gastroenteritis remains a difficult prospect. The treatment of most cases of bacterial enteritis is usually supportive, but the use and overuse of antibiotics may result in an increased incidence of resistance, which could continue to be problematic in the future.",
