These findings support for the need to have hospital and workplace cultures that encourage staying home while ill with respiratory illness. 18, 22, 23 This was a pilot study and was not powered to elucidate differences between study arms or to assess risk factors for illness or for adherence to prophylaxis. Participants were primarily healthy adult health care workers, who were willing to accept randomization to vaccine or antiviral prophylaxis, which limits generalizability. In addition, reliance on self-presentation for collection of NP swabs led to some underestimation of illness burden owing to non-influenza respiratory viruses.",
