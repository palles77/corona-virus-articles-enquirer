Very large quantities of water and electrolytes, relative to total body stores, are cycled through the gastrointestinal (GI) tract daily. For example, nearly half the total volume of extracellular fluid is secreted into the upper GI tract each day, an amount greatly exceeding oral intake. Under normal conditions fecal losses of water and electrolytes amount to only approximately 0.1% of the total amount cycled through the GI tract. However, when normal small intestinal absorptive or secretory function is disrupted acutely, massive fluid and electrolyte losses may ensue.",

Loss of isotonic fluid decreases circulating plasma volume and may in severe instances (e.g., parvoviral enteritis) precipitate hypovolemic shock. Because isotonic fluids are lost, serum electrolyte concentrations usually remain normal initially. During diarrheal diseases the most important source of potassium loss is via urine, mediated by aldosterone released in response to extracellular fluid volume depletion.

Sugar centrifugation can be used for routine parasite evaluation and may be superior to many techniques for the demonstration of oocysts of Toxoplasma gondii and C. parvum. Giardia cysts are distorted by sugar centrifugation but can still be easily identified. Fecal sedimentation will recover most cysts and ova but will also contain debris. This technique is superior to flotation procedures for the documentation of fluke eggs. Some parasites such as Trichuris spp. and Giardia spp. are shed intermittently and so can be occult. Performing two to three fecal flotations over 5 to 7 days will increase sensitivity of detection of these parasites. Feces should be refrigerated, not frozen, until assayed for parasites. If a fecal sample is to be sent to a diagnostic laboratory for further analysis and will not be evaluated for parasites within 48 hours, it should be preserved.

Fluid administration rate should be increased if body weight begins to drop and should be decreased if body weight increases excessively (more than 5% to 10% of calculated normal weight). Other parameters for assessing adequacy of fluid replacement therapy include serial measurement of hematocrit and plasma protein concentration, estimation of pulse pressure, capillary refill time, and mucous membrane texture. Early potassium supplementation is critical for optimum management of dogs and cats with severe gastroenteritis and volume depletion, because depletion of body potassium stores develops rapidly. Routine potassium supplementation should begin before hypokalemia is detected because serum potassium content represents only a small fraction of total body potassium stores. Adverse consequences of hypokalemia are numerous and include decreased GI motility, decreased cardiac output, hypotension, skeletal muscle weakness, and general malaise and inappetence. Cats seem particularly likely to develop hypokalemia during periods of GI fluid loss and fluid replacement therapy, and they should be supplemented early and aggressively. Empirical supplementation of potassium is begun at 20 to 40 mEq/L of fluids administered; cats should receive at least 40 mEq/L. Daily measurement of serum potassium is recommended to facilitate maintenance of normal concentration. If at all possible, serum potassium concentration should be determined before initiating supplementation. For example, although patients with adrenocortical insufficiency and advanced oliguric renal failure often develop GI disease, they should not receive potassium because they are often hyperkalemic. These two important disorders may be detected, and inappropriate potassium supplementation avoided, by determination of serum electrolyte and urea nitrogen levels. A rapid and reasonably reliable screening test for identifying life-threatening hyperkalemia early is an electrocardiogram. Typical early electrocardiographic changes include tall, peaked T waves, loss of P waves, and wide QRS complexes.",

In these patients, glucose administration (typically as a 5% solution) may produce a dramatic response. The caloric content of a 5% dextrose solution is far less than the patient's requirements but nonetheless seems to be helpful in alleviating some of the adverse effects of sepsis. Glucose supplementation is begun either at the outset or early in the course of fluid therapy in patients with severe enteritis. It is recommended that glucose levels be evaluated every 8 to 12 hours during the period of intensive therapy. Blood glucose levels in normal patients on a 5% dextrose drip should range from approximately 130 to 180 mg/dl. A patient on a 5% dextrose infusion with a low-normal glucose level is probably significantly hypoglycemic and may be septic.

Each agent can cause vomiting; all but Helicobacter spp. are commonly associated with the clinical signs of large, small, or mixed bowel diarrhea. C. perfringens-associated disease appears to be less common in cats than in dogs. Each of the bacterial infections can be associated with contaminated environments, direct contact with infected animals, or potentially ingestion of infected prey species. Salmonellosis and campylobacteriosis are commonly associated with ingestion of undercooked poultry products. It is also possible that each of the organisms could be carried by healthy animals only to overgrow and induce disease because of other stimuli such as stress, diet change, or antimicrobial therapy. Salmonellosis is commonly associated with polysystemic clinical signs such as fever, as well as neutropenia, in the sepsis stage of infection. Approximately 50% of the cats with salmonellosis are seen for evaluation of fever without GI tract disease signs; the owner may report a recent history of songbird ingestion. Campylobacteriosis is most common in puppies and kittens, and the organism is less likely to cause polysystemic signs than salmonellosis. Small animals can also be infected by other potential bacterial pathogens such as Shigella and Yersinia enterocolitica but seem to be relatively resistant to disease induced by these organisms. examination suggests but does not prove bacterial disease induced by Campylobacter spp., Salmonella spp., or C. perfringens enterotoxin production but is a relative indication for fecal culture (see diagnosis section). C. perfringens are large rod-form bacteria; pathogenic strains generally have an unstained spore. A positive C. perfringens culture or presence of large, spore-forming rods does not prove enterotoxin production; enterotoxin measurement in feces is available at most large commercial laboratories. Because C. perfringens enterotoxin can be detected in healthy patients, as well as those that are clinically ill, positive results cannot be used to definitely confirm a disease association.

The pathophysiology of the disease most closely resembles that of acute hemorrhagic enteritis of humans induced by certain enterotoxigenic strains of E. coli. Anaphylactic reaction to as yet undetermined toxins also has been implicated. The clinical course of the disease is frequently peracute, progressing rapidly to death if not treated aggressively and promptly. Early signs are vomiting and depression, progressing to hematemesis and copious, malodorous, bloody diarrhea, often of currant-jelly consistency. Recovery after treatment is usually equally rapid.",

Electrolyte concentration and body weight should be monitored closely during treatment. To date, evidence has not been presented to indicate that administration of antibiotics is beneficial, although patients with evidence of severe leukopenia or presence of a left shift on complete blood count should probably receive antibiotic treatment. Antiemetic drugs may be warranted if vomiting is severe or prolonged. Sequelae. For most cases, clinical signs resolve quickly, without sequelae.

Intussusception should be considered in any young dog with acute onset of bloody diarrhea and a firm, tubular abdominal mass. Mechanical small intestinal obstruction has several important consequences. Experimentally, 6 to 12 hours of small bowel obstruction in dogs results in distention and decreased absorption from the bowel proximal to the lesion. If obstruction persists, net secretion of sodium and water quickly ensues. These changes are thought to occur as a consequence of increased intraluminal pressure, increased portal venous and lymphatic pressures, and liberation of toxins by bacteria that rapidly proliferate in the obstructed bowel. Bacteria figure prominently in the pathogenesis of changes occurring in bowel obstruction, because mortality is greatly reduced and survival prolonged in newborn or gnotobiotic dogs with experimental intestinal obstruction. If obstruction persists, blood supply to the obstructed bowel is compromised and edema, hemorrhage, and eventually necrosis of the bowel wall develop. Intestinal mucosal permeability increases, allowing plasma proteins to leak into the bowel lumen and at the same time promoting uptake of bacteria and bacterial toxins into the portal circulation. Bacterial peritonitis frequently accompanies untreated, complicated small bowel obstruction. Metabolic complications of prolonged small bowel obstruction include hypovolemia, hyponatremia, and hypochloridemia. Significant hypovolemia may develop rapidly in distal small bowel obstruction, because fluid is sequestered within the bowel lumen.Within 24 hours of obstruction, 50% or more of total plasma volume may be lost; additional fluid also may accumulate within the peritoneal cavity. These losses may be sufficient to precipitate hypovolemic shock. Because fluid losses are isotonic, plasma electrolyte concentrations may initially be normal. Hyponatremia may, however, become apparent when a patient drinks water in an attempt to replace volume losses. Chloride loss occurs through vomiting, although vomiting occurs in only approximately 10% of dogs with complete proximal small bowel obstruction. Mild metabolic acidosis may develop as a result of bicarbonate loss (vomiting) and renal functional impairment (hypovolemia). Outcome after correction of bowel obstruction depends largely on whether complications occur (sepsis, peritonitis, bowel perforation, and acute renal failure).",

If a lesion cannot be identified grossly, intestinal biopsy (at least jejunum and ileum) is warranted, because certain intestinal infectious or inflammatory diseases may induce signs that mimic intestinal obstruction. If bowel perforation with severe peritonitis has developed, delayed body wall closure with sterile open packing of the abdomen may be used to facilitate drainage. The abdomen is closed after several cycles of abdominal lavage and when the infection appears to be under control (usually 1 to 2 days). If there is any question as to bowel viability at the time of initial exploratory laparotomy, a second laparotomy 24 hours later may be indicated to better assess intestinal viability. Serosal patching of bowel segments (especially colon) that have perforated or that have undergone ischemic injury may be helpful in enhancing intestinal healing and guarding against bowel leakage.",

In most instances illness is manifested by acute onset of vomiting, often accompanied by profuse, watery diarrhea. Animals are rarely febrile, and significant leukogram abnormalities are uncommon. Illness is thought to result either from osmotic overload with nondigestible substances or from ingestion of preformed bacterial toxins. There are multiple drugs associated with vomiting.Diagnosis. Occasionally the toxicant ingested isknown, especially if iatrogenic. Definitive diagnosis of food poisoning requires laboratory identification of the offending enterotoxin. Because this is rarely performed, most cases are presumptively diagnosed by history and physical examination findings and treated nonspecifically.Treatment. Supportive care designed primarilyto prevent dehydration is generally the mainstay of treatment for acute garbage enteritis in dogs. Food and water are withheld for 12 hours, and then only water (or water plus electrolytes) is given for the next 12 to 24 hours, depending on the course of the disease. If vomiting and/or diarrhea persist for longer than 24 hours, more serious GI disease is likely. Antidiarrheal drugs should be administered cautiously if the source of intoxication is unknown, because they may potentially worsen, by slowing elimination, disease caused by bacterial enterotoxins. Antiemetic drugs can be given by injection to control severe vomiting, provided clinical evidence of dehydration or hypovolemia is not present.
