Because antibiotic treatment of BEs has been shown to mitigate clinical symptoms, restore lung function, and concurrently suppress systemic and airway inflammatory responses, 6, 7 BEs have been postulated to result from airways bacterial infections of novel strains, increased bacterial density, or both. 8 However, Tunney et al 9 showed that total bacterial density and microbiota taxa, analyzed by culture and 16s ribosomal DNA pyrosequencing, did not change remarkably during antibiotic treatment of BEs, suggesting that changes in lung microbiota composition might not account signifi cantly for BEs. This has led us to examine the roles of other poten tial pathogens, especially viruses, in adults with bronchiectasis.",

In addition, clinical characteristics and investigations regarding virus-associated BEs in adults are also lacking, and the interactions between respiratory viruses, bacteria, and host immune response, which might directly relate to pathogenesis of bronchiectasis, as shown in COPD, 17 deserve special attention from researchers and clinicians. Meanwhile, biomarkers such as serum interferon-g -induced protein 10 (IP-10) have been proposed as surrogate markers for predicting virus-associated exacerbations of COPD, 18 but the utility in bronchiectasis has never been assessed. In this prospective study, we sought to (1) document the incidence of 16 common respiratory viruses in adults with bronchiectasis during steady-state bronchiectasis and BEs, (2) investigate the clinical diff erences between virus-positive and virus-negative BEs, and (3) assess the utility of serum IP-10 for predicting virus-related BEs.",

Additionally, viral infections during BEs were not associated with marked changes in FEV 1 from baseline, implying that FEV 1 was not a sensitive marker of BEs. 8 Disease-specifi c questionnaires and more sensitive indicators of spirometry, such as the lung clearance index, merit further investigations to determine whether viral infection at BEs is associated with worse QoL and greater reduction in lung function. 31,32 Serum IP-10 has been a promising indicator of virusassociated exacerbation in COPD. 18, 33 Although serum IP-10 was increased in virus-positive BEs, we found that the diagnostic accuracy was poor for predicting viral infection at BEs. Given the low positive and negative predictive values, our fi ndings suggested that serum IP-10 was not an ideal surrogate of laboratory-confi rmed viral infection at BEs in clinical practice and further researches.

Although virus-positive BEs were not associated with increased bacterial density in our study, there was a signifi cant increase in systemic and airway infl ammatory markers (including serum IL-6, TNF-a , and sputum IL-1 b ). Changes in bacterial communities or virulence caused by viral infection, but not abundance, might result in signifi cant increase in infl ammatory responses, which, in turn, stimulate exacerbation of symptoms.
