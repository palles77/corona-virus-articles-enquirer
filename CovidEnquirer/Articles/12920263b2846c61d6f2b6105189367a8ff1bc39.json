            "text": "Reproductive success in the eight founder strains of the Collaborative Cross (CC) was measured using a diallel-mating scheme. Over a 48-month period we generated 4,448 litters, and 24,782 weaned pups were used across 16 different published experiments. We identified factors that affect the average litter size in a cross by estimating the overall contribution of parent-of-origin, heterosis, inbred, and epistatic effects using a Bayesian zero-truncated overdispersed Poisson mixed model. The phenotypic variance of litter size has a substantial contribution (79%) from unexplained and environmental sources, but no detectable effect of seasonality. Most of the explained variance was due to additive effects (9.2%) and parental sex (maternal vs paternal strain; 5.8%), with epistasis accounting for 3.4%. Within the parental effects, the effect of the dam's strain explained more than the sire's strain (13.2% vs. 1.8%), and the dam's strain effects account for 74.2% of total variation explained. Dams from strains C57BL/6J and NOD/ShiLtJ increased the expected litter size by a mean of 1.66 and 1.79 pups, whereas dams from strains WSB/EiJ, PWK/PhJ, and CAST/EiJ reduced expected litter size by a mean of 1.51, 0.81, and 0.90 pups. Finally, there was no strong evidence for strain-specific effects on sex ratio distortion. Overall, these results demonstrate that strains vary substantially in their reproductive ability depending on their genetic background and that litter size is largely determined by dam.strain rather than sire.strain effects, as expected. This analysis adds to our understanding of factors that influence litter size in mammals, and also helps to explain breeding successes and failures in the extinct lines and surviving CC strains.

            "text": "A critical part of fitness is optimizing the balance between numbers of offspring, offspring body size, and reproductive timing, leading to strong selection for these traits (Smith and Fretwell 1974; Beauchamp and Kacelnik 1990) . Fundamental fitness traits, like litter size (i.e., the number of pups born per litter), should have low contributions of genetic variance due to rapid fixation of alleles that increase fitness (Mousseau and Roff 1987; Price and Schluter 1991; Meril\u00e4 and Sheldon 1999; Stirling et al. 2002; Peripato et al. 2004) . Estimates of litter size heritability vary from 5% to 20% in mouse, rabbit, and porcine populations (Falconer 1960; Avalos and Smith 1987; Falconer and Mackay 1996; Johnson et al. 1999; Garc\u0131a and Baselga 2002; Peripato et al. 2004; Guti\u00e9rrez et al. 2006) leading to the majority of variation in litter size being non-heritable. Nonheritable factors include seasonality, food availability, paternal and maternal effects, dominance and epistasis, as well as unknown factors. Additionally, sexual conflict over parental investment may exist between females and males, and this in turn could affect litter size (Trivers 1974; Hager and Johnstone 2003) . These factors make it difficult to obtain clear measurements of litter size in wild populations. A controlled laboratory environment is therefore necessary to measure genetic effects of litter size (Jinks and Broadhurst 1963; Roberts 1960; Bandy and Eisen 1984; Hoornbeek 1968; Peripato et al. 2004; Guti\u00e9rrez et al. 2006; Varona and Sorensen 2014) .",

The CC resource and its founder strains can also be used to study reproductive ability, which is especially interesting because this population has an established record both of breeding successes and of failures. For example, litter size in the early CC lines shows a steady decline over the first six generations of inbreeding (Philip et al. 2011 ). In addition, nearly 95% of all CC lines have become extinct, primarily due to subspecific genomic incompatibilities (Shorter et al. 2017) . Although standard reproductive phenotypes have been measured, mostly in male CC founders (Odet et al. 2015) , the genetic and non-genetic control over CC breeding success has never been thoroughly characterized, and is likely to contain vital information that may be used to improve CC breeding in the future.",

Adapting a recently developed statistical model of diallel effects (Lenarcic et al. 2012) , we quantified both the genetic contributions that shape litter size and the contributions of several environmental factors. Our results provide a detailed account of breeding patterns across and between the eight founders. This experiment also informs us about genetic combinations that are highly or marginally productive in the CC, helping us to better understand CC fertility problems and line extinction.",

This diallel cross was originally designed and maintained for the generation of F1 mice for several experimental projects (Koturbash et al. 2011; Aylor et al. 2011; Mathes et al. 2011; Kelada et al. 2012; Didion et al. 2012; Collaborative Cross Consortium 2012; Calaway et al. 2013; Crowley et al. 2014; Phillippi et al. 2014; Odet et al. 2015; Crowley et al. 2015; Morgan et al. 2016; Percival et al. 2016; Shorter et al. 2017; Oreper et al. 2017; Maurizio et al. 2018) . As a result, certain reproductive measurements such as time between litters and maximum number of offspring per cross were necessarily biased by experimental breeding requirements. Average weaned litter size, however, is a reproductive trait that should be well-estimated independently of these factors.

A wide distribution of litter sizes was observed, ranging from an average of 3.6 weaned pups for WSB\u21e5WSB crosses, to an average of 9.1 weaned pups for NOD\u21e5PWK crosses, with an overall mean of 5.5 weaned pups per litter. Examining average litter sizes of the inbred strains across all 4 years, we found neglible evidence of consistent seasonal effects (F 11,2283 = 1.272 p = 0.23) ( Figure S4 ) but positive evidence of non-seasonal patterns: a modeled 'year.month' covariate significantly affected litter size (F 47,2247 = 2.44 p < .0001; see also Figure S5 ). The non-seasonal effect could be driven by the relocation of mice between vivariums, which occurred in February 2010. The housing facility may have an impact on litter size as well. To test this, we measured average litter size differences between the two housing facilities and found that two founder strains, 129S1 and WSB, had significantly larger average litter sizes at the Hillsborough facility than at UNC GMB with a difference of 5.87 to 4.42 weaned pups per litter (p < 0.0001) for 129S1, and 3.84 to 3.42 weaned pups per litter (p = 0.029) for WSB. The six other founder strains did not significantly differ in their average litter sizes between the two facilities, but tended to have smaller weaned litters at UNC GMB (see Discussion). For average litter size across the diallel, we tested for an effect of litter number (birth parity number, for a given mating pair) on the number of pups weaned in each litter. Previous research suggests that the first litter can be significantly smaller than subsequent litters due to various biological factors (De la Fuente and San Primitivo 1985). This effect was consistent in the diallel: we observed that there was significant reduction in litter size in the first litter (p < 0.0001) compared to the overall linear effect that parity has on reducing litter size ( Figure S5 ).",

A similar pattern is observed here, but these effects are determined to be specifically through the maternal strain, with CAST, PWK and WSB having negative \"dam\" effects on litter size (Figure 3) . It is likely that selection pressure in classical lab strains is associated with larger litters compared with the wild-derived strains. Additionally, two of the wild-derived strains, CAST and PWK, are from a different subspecific origin than the other six CC founders.

The breeding of this diallel was performed across two different vivariums over the course of 4 years, and we see a significant effect from housing facility. The Hillsborough facility was associated with larger litters for all strains, especially 129S1 and WSB. The two facilities have many different factors that could explain these differences. The Hillsborough facility housed multiple species, including dogs and mice, had smaller rooms that held approximately 300 mouse cages, was remotely located in a rural area, had different laboratory personnel, had cage changes once a week, and was supplied with filtered well water. The diallel breeding at the GMB facility took place in a large central room, contained only laboratory mice, is located in a basement of a large seven story research building on campus, has cage changes every other week, and is supplied with filtered city water. It is possible that one or more of these factors, independently or in combination, affected productivity. Another finding was that seasonality, which has previously been shown to influence litter size and frequency of litters in mammals (Drickamer 1990) , did not seem to significantly impact litter size in this study. This is likely due to consistent light-dark cycles and temperatures as well as a steady diet. We did observe a significant effect on litter size after the transfer of the mice to the UNC GMB facility (February 2010), which reduced overall litter sizes from March to June 2010. This may have been due to the use of ivermectin during the time of the transfer. Other factors, such as the sex of the laboratory personnel interacting with the animals, are generally known to influence rodent behavior and could contribute to some of the environmentally-induced variation we observed (Sorge et al. 2014) .",

First, to better understand and distinguish the effects arising from female and male parents, we reparameterized our strain-specific additive and parental-sex effects such that we could provide estimates of maternal strain and paternal strain effects separately. In the original BayesDiallel model, maternal and paternal strain effects are split into \"additive\" effects, which consolidates the effects they have in common, and \"parental sex\", which models any remaining deviation between the two. Recognizing that additive effects from the sire are essentially wiped out by the additive effects, we instead collapsed the additive and parental-sex effects into \"dam.strain\" and \"sire.strain\" effects in a post-processing step on the posterior output. This allowed us to run the original BayesDiallel model while also viewing our data from the perspective of dam strain and sire strain contributions.",

Sex ratio is most naturally modeled as a binomial, with an underlying (male) proportion between 0 and 1. Although it would be possible to obtain an approximate analysis by transformations to normality using the original BayesDiallel (and we do this for litter size for some otherwise hard-to-obtain quantities), we found such approximations to be inadequate for reliable estimation of higher order effects in the case of litter size and deeply flawed in the case of sex ratio.",

In order to account for heteroscedasticity (unequal variance) of the model residuals that arises from the approximately ZTPoisson nature of the data, we use a variance-stabilizing transformation (VST) (Yu 2009 ) and run BayesDiallel again (Gaussian) to obtain Variance Projections on the modeled data. The VarPs that are calculated from these parameter estimates are an approximation of the variance contributions that we would observe in the GLMM BayesDiallel model.",
