Daratumumab monotherapy (16 mg/kg) was initiated as seventh line of treatment. After 2 infusions, she presented with fever. History and physical examination revealed no signs of infection. Blood, urine, and sputum cultures were negative for microorganisms. Chest x-ray showed no pulmonary infiltrates.

A computed tomography scan of the chest and abdomen, as part of the diagnostic workup of fever of unknown origin, revealed no explanation for her symptoms. Meanwhile, her clinical condition deteriorated with the development of night sweats, anorexia, weight loss (5 kg), and fatigue. At this time, her platelet count (131 to 53 \u00c2 10 9 /L) and hemoglobin level (8.0 to 6.3 mmol/L) decreased in the absence of neutropenia. Upon the development of chills, 3 weeks after she first reported fever, she was admitted to the hospital. Repeated cultures of blood, urine, and sputum remained negative for microorganisms. Given the persistence of fever, her immunocompromised status, and, at this point, inconclusive workup, we analyzed the potential reactivation of viral infections. Epstein-Barr virus DNA was not present in blood samples. However, high levels of CMV-DNA were detected in blood by quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay (> 100.000 copies/mL) indicating a symptomatic CMV infection. There was no CMV end-organ disease such as pneumonitis or hepatitis. She reported abdominal discomfort and diarrhea coinciding with the onset",

However, because she refused endoscopic evaluation, this diagnosis could not be confirmed. Importantly, serologic antibody tests in 2010 already showed positivity for CMV-specific IgG, indicating CMV reactivation and not primary infection in the current situation. 1 Treatment with intravenous ganciclovir 5 mg/kg twice daily was initiated, resulting in normalization of her temperature within 24 hours. After 48 hours, the CMV-DNA load decreased to 58.000 copies/mL. She was discharged with continuation of valganciclovir orally 900 mg twice daily, and 2 months after diagnosis, the CMV-DNA load was repeatedly below the detection limit (< 500 copies/mL) and eventually became negative.

            "text": "The risk of recurrent CMV infection is increased in immunocompromised patients, such as patients with primary immunodeficiencies or HIV infection, solid organ transplant recipients, and patients on hemodialysis. 2 In patients with hematologic disorders, the risk of CMV infection is markedly increased following allogeneic stem cell transplantation or autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) with CD34 \u00fe -selected cells, as well as following treatment with high-dose corticosteroids, alemtuzumab, cladribine, or fludarabine, as a result of lower levels and dysfunction of natural killer (NK) cells, CD8 \u00fe T-cells, and CD4 \u00fe T-cells. [2] [3] [4] Patients with MM have increased susceptibility to infections as a result of myeloma-induced immune dysfunction, including impaired T-and NK-cell activity, and decreased polyclonal immunoglobulin production, as well as cumulative immunosuppression of anti-MM treatment regimens. 5 The incidence of CMV DNAemia, defined as presence of CMV-DNA without CMVrelated symptoms, 1 and CMV disease in patients with MM are best studied following ASCT. In prospective studies, the incidence of CMV-DNAemia without CMV-related symptoms post-ASCT ranges from 14.7% to 42.3%. Given the low rate of patients with CMV-DNAemia that develop a symptomatic CMV infection, prospective monitoring of CMV titers in these patients is not recommended. 3 When CMV-DNA quantification was performed on clinical indication, the rate of symptomatic CMV infection post-ASCT ranges from 0.7% to 30.7%. 3 Bortezomib-containing induction regimens are associated with a higher incidence of CMV reactivation post-ASCT. 3, 6, 7 Daratumumab is a monoclonal IgG kappa antibody targeting CD38, which is highly and ubiquitously expressed on MM cells. Daratumumab induces killing of tumor cells via classical Fcdependent immune effector mechanisms. 8 Furthermore, daratumumab depletes regulatory T-cells, regulatory B-cells, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells, leading to increased T-cell numbers and clonal T-cell expansion, which may result in an improved hosteanti-tumor immune response. 9 Daratumumab has high single-agent efficacy in heavily pretreated patients with MM who have relapsed from and/or are refractory to immunomodulatory agents and proteasome inhibitors, 10, 11 and combines well with several standards of care. 12, 13 During daratumumab monotherapy, infection-related serious adverse events occurred in 10% of patients treated in the GEN501 trial. 11 In a similar trial, 2 patients out of 106 discontinued treatment owing to H1N1 infections. 10 When daratumumab is combined with bortezomib-dexamethasone, the incidence of grade ! 3 infections is slightly higher compared with daratumumab monotherapy, but similar to the bortezomib-dexamethasone control group (21.4% compared with 19.0%), whereas in patients treated with daratumumab and lenalidomide-dexamethasone, this risk was higher compared with lenalidomide-dexamethasone alone (28.3% vs. 22.8%). In these studies, the incidence of pneumonia did not differ between patients treated with a daratumumab-based combination and those treated with lenalidomide-dexamethasone or bortezomib-dexamethasone alone. 12, 13 Until now, no CMV infections have been reported during daratumumab monotherapy treatment.",

In addition, daratumumab has been shown to rapidly decrease NK cell counts, which occurred in all patients and is already evident after the CMV Reactivation in MM Patient During Daratumumab Treatment first infusion. 14,15 Indeed, our patient had a low number of circulating NK cells in peripheral blood (1.2 \u00c2 10 3 /mL; reference value, 100-400 \u00c2 10 3 /mL) ( Table 1) .",

There was no CMV-DNAemia in these patients. Altogether, routine screening of CMV does not seem beneficial in patients treated with daratumumab. However, the possibility of a CMV reactivation should be taken into consideration in case of unexplained fever or bone marrow suppression, such as occurred in our patient, or signs suggestive of CMV end-organ disease.",
