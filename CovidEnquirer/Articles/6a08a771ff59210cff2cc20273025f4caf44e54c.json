            "text": "Background: The recent outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome, H5N1 (avian influenza), and, most recently, the novel H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009 have raised awareness of the danger of new and emerging infections. Preparedness and response plans for such outbreaks are crucial, and given the centrality of the Internet as a source of information on university and college campuses, such plans should be made available at pandemic-dedicated university Web sites. The information on these sites must be comprehensive, accessible, and tailored to the specific circumstances of individual schools. Methods: An Internet-based search was conducted in September 2009 to evaluate university Web sites for influenza-specific information in a sample of 51 universities. Web sites were assessed by applying a set of key words and a list of 10 indicators used as measures of accessibility and comprehensiveness. Results: Of the 51 universities evaluated, only 9 (17.6%) either had no influenza Web site or had a university influenza preparedness plan with no dedicated Web site. Only 6 (14.3%) of the schools with influenza specific Web sites had information for parents, with 23 (54.8%) providing information specifically for faculty and staff, and 24 (57.1%) providing information specifically to students. Conclusion: We found no guidelines for maximizing the access to and effectiveness of online pandemic communications at institutions of higher learning. Until such time as appropriate guidelines are developed, university authorities must carefully assess their needs, taking into account local, national, and international public health circumstances and resources; ease of access; comprehensiveness; and appropriately tailored strategies in their online communications.",

            "text": "Seasonal influenza is endemic to human populations, causing 30,000-50,000 deaths in the United States alone each year. 1 However, a pandemic of novel influenza has the potential to significantly increase rates of morbidity and mortality, particularly in vulnerable groups. 2 For example, the 2009 novel H1N1 influenza pandemic disproportionately affected 20-to 40-year-olds, the same demographic group most severely affected by the 1918-1919 \"Spanish influenza\" pandemic (a genetic precursor of the 2009 novel H1N1 pandemic), which left approximately 50 million dead worldwide. 3 Recent epidemiologic evidence indicates that US college and university students ran a greater risk of contracting H1N1 than the general population because of their age. 4 Furthermore, because students live in close quarters and attend classes in large groups, they may be at greater risk of experiencing severe complications from the disease than from seasonal influenza. 5 Thus, it is critical that students, parents, faculty, and staff have access to the latest information about communicable disease threats and available resources to help limit disease spread, morbidity, and mortality.",

Moreover, members of the school community are more likely to seek timely and accurate information about disasters and appropriate responses online rather than from other information outlets. 6, 7 In recognition of this fact, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has begun disseminating online higher education-specific pandemic influenza guidance and recommending the use of pandemic-dedicated Web sites to keep university communities informed and updated. 8, 9 In the event of prolonged public health threats, such as infectious disease disasters, online messaging and regularly updated Web sites have been shown to be timely and effective in providing risk communication and health messages. 10 However, studies also have shown that pandemic influenza-specific Web sites are among the least accessible and most difficult to understand compared with Web sites addressing other types of disasters. 7 Poor accessibility can significantly undermine the effectiveness of university pandemic preparedness efforts and limit the ability of individuals to make well-informed decisions during pandemics. 11 This study measures the comprehensiveness and accessibility to the university community of these pandemic-dedicated university Web sites and makes recommendations for improving them.",

The survey showed that 92.9% of the 42 sampled universities with influenza-specific Web sites referred directly to the CDC Web site for information. And although not included in this research, the CDC also offers a downloadable \"flu widget\" used to establish a direct link from any Web site to the CDC influenza-dedicated Web site. The ease of access and reliability of information has made CDC online materials a virtual default resource for universities with pandemic information on their Web sites. However, CDC materials are not institution-specific and cannot replace planning for the unique needs of individual universities, nor do they promote culturally appropriate and community-sensitive approaches. Despite this, only 9.5% of the 42 schools with an influenza-specific Web site referred to more locally appropriate information from either a county or city health department. Because response (including vaccine and medication delivery) is largely local, it is counterproductive to depend primarily on general CDC templates rather than tailoring responses to local circumstances and creating cooperative relationships with local stakeholders. Indeed, with effective cooperation between responding agencies and universities, university influenza Web sites could not only serve the immediate university community, but also provide resources for local preparedness and response messages that are customized to surrounding communities.",

In the event of school closure or restriction of essential services, many of these students might be stranded and would become the responsibility of the university.

As a result, many institutions have developed preparedness and response plans. These plans vary widely in comprehensiveness and accessibility to the communities they serve. The 2009 novel H1N1 pandemic has been a true test of university public health procedures, which has shown that much remains to be done. The relative ease of use and popularity of online resources, such as CDC influenza Web sites, has made it possible for nearly all universities to provide influenza-specific information somewhere on their Web sites. However, relying primarily or even solely on the CDC online sites for in-depth information on pandemics as many universities do leaves significant gaps in preparation and response capabilities. CDC checklists do not provide the detailed and institution-specific information necessary to field adequate and appropriate responses. University authorities must take into account local public health circumstances and resources, and work toward transparency and specificity in their online communications. Information must be targeted to university audiences and made easily accessible to the entire university community.",
