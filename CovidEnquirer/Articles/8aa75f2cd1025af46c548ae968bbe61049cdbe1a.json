Recombinant viruses were collected from chicken embryos, embryonic cultured cells and chickens co-infected with Ark99 and Mass41 strains and purified by differential centrifugation. The recombinant S1 genes were identified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) using heterologous primers and confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. The recombinants with Ark99 5% and Mass41 3% sequences were identified following the in vitro, in ovo and in vivo co-infections. Mixed RNA extracted from Ark99 and Mass41 did not produce RTPCR products with these primers at the PCR conditions used. Cross-over sites within the amplified 580 (Mass41) or 604 (Ark99) bases of the 5% S1 gene could only be detected between nucleotides 50 and 155. While this region, lying upstream of the S1 hypervariable region, corresponded with sites commonly identified in naturally occurring isolates, recombination sites identified in these studies could not be detected within the HVR of S1 of the genomes of chimeric viruses. \u00a9 1997 Elsevier Science B.V.",

Recombinant RTPCR products were clearly detected following amplification with the Ark-U and Mass-D primer set (Fig. 1b) . No recombinant RTPCR product was observed with RNA from the uninfected embryos. Fig. 2. Schematic representation of shifts and nucleotide sequences of cloned products. Chimeric products were amplified with the Mass-D and Ark-U primers covering nucleotide \u2212 20 to 580 in the S1 genes. DNA samples were purified with spin columns (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) and the DNA was sequenced using the dideoxy method according to instructions (Sequenase Kit, USB, Cleveland, OH) or by the dye terminator cycle method (Ready Reaction, Perkin-Elmer, Foster City, CA) with the Applied Biosystems/Perkin-Elmer automated DNA/RNA sequencer (model 377). Sequences labelled TC (tissue culture) were derived from RNA of co-infected CEK, ECE from RNA of co-infected ECE and C from RNA of co-infected chicks. The sequences of the first 200 nucleotides of S1 genes from recombinants and their parental strains are compared. The sequences of parental strains Mass41 and Ark99 were derived from published data (Binns et al., 1985; Wang et al., 1993). Recombination was confirmed and the approximate cross-over sites were identified by cloning and sequencing of cDNA generated from the Ark-U and M41-D primers which consistently produced a product from in vitro or in ovo infection that could be easily seen on an agarose gel (Fig. 2) . RTPCR generated cDNA bands with the predicted 600 nt size were excised from agarose gels and the DNA extracted with GeneClean (Bio101, Vista, CA). The DNA was sequenced after cloning into a PCR cloning vector (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA). The sequence information for the recombinant viruses were compared with the published sequences of the parental strains (Binns et al., 1985; Wang et al., 1993) . Cross-over sites in the in vitro generated recombinant viruses were detected within cDNA corresponding to nucleotides 50-60 and nucleotides 95-100 of the S1 gene. Recombination in the chimeric RNA derived from in ovo co-infection occurred at about nucleotide 99. These sites lie within the putative recombination 'hot spot' indicated from sequencing of the S1 of a number of natural isolates (Wang et al., 1993 (Wang et al., , 1994 . No shifts in homology could be detected within the HVR which extends from nucleotides 160-560. An identical change at nucleotide 52-55 (TGCT to CTTG) from our original Ark sequence or the Mass41 sequence occurred in three chimeric molecules (Binns et al., 1985; Wang et al., 1993) . This change may reflect mutations in our stocks.",

A second, less often used site was found close to the 3% end of S1 (Wang et al., 1993 (Wang et al., , 1994 . Although frequencies of recombination are not known, the fact that the HVR and adjacent downstream 600 or more nucleotides may seldom be targets for cross-over events suggests that the region lying upstream, in fact, is more susceptible for recombination. This region may have structures or sequences that promote polymerase interchange of templates. However, because the additional sequences examined were within the HVR, it is also possible that HVR sequences are not favorable sites for recombination. During the process of synthesizing potential chimeric molecules, the variability of the HVR may prohibit necessary RNA-RNA interactions. For example, released, replicating S1 HVR may not be capable of binding to an HVR of new template. An alternative explanation for the absence of detectable recombination events is that chimeric HVR may be less likely to express functional S1 required for viable virus than other chimeric regions, for example, the initial 155 bases of the S1.",

Because the parental sequences of many recombinant, naturally occurring strains are derived from distinct Mass41-like sequences, it is a concern that the vaccine may be contributing to the evolution of new strains (Wang et al., 1994) . These studies confirm that, with excessive doses of parental virus used to accelerate the rate of recombination, RNA from a Mass serotype can participate in cross-over events resulting in progeny with sequences of the Mass origin and sequences derived from a second parent with the Ark serotype. These studies, which were not designed to examine virulence of experimentally produced recombi-nants, did produce a chimeric S1 from a sick chick and one from a healthy chick.

The capacity for Mass41 strains and Mass vaccines, in particular, to participate in the occurrence of new isolates and the ready experimental generation of Mass41 recombinants in vivo, as well as in vitro and in ovo, may further raise concern about the routine use of live IBV to control disease.
