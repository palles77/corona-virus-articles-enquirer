The first rule of infectious waste management was regulated in 1992, and infectious wastes are defined as the waste materials generated in medical institutions as a result of medical care or research which contain pathogens that have the potential to transmit infectious diseases. Revised criteria for infectious waste management were promulgated by the Ministry of Environment in 2004. Infectious waste materials are divided into three categories: the form of waste; the place of waste generation; the kind of infectious diseases. A reduction of infectious waste is expected. We introduce a summary of the revised regulation of infectious waste management in this article. (M. Miyazaki). www.elsevier.com/locate/wasman Waste Management 25 (2005) 616-621",

Medicines, equipment, instruments and food are used while treating in-patients and out-patients at hospitals and clinics, producing a variety of waste materials. Waste materials generated at hospitals and clinics (medical institutions) are divided into infectious and noninfectious. The waste generated from the treatment of patients suffering from infectious diseases may spread infection either through direct contact or indirectly through the environment. Transmission of infectious diseases is a serious matter. Therefore, an appropriate waste management system is essential. The World Health Organization (1983) , US Environmental Protection Agency (1986, 1991) , US Centers for Disease Con-trol and Prevention (1978) , Germany (Muhlich et al., 2003; The Ministry of Environment, 2004) , and many other countries have already established strict guidelines for the management of infectious waste materials disposed of from medical institutions.",

The management of infectious waste materials was regulated in 1992 under the amended Waste Disposal Law of 1991. However, troublesome problems on management practices of infectious waste materials in medical institutions have been recognized by the agencies concerned (Miyazaki, 2001 (Miyazaki, , 2003 Miyazaki and Une, 2004a) . In fact, medical institutions have faced difficult problems at many places regarding the treatment and disposal of infectious waste in practice. Furthermore, many articles reported technologies of disinfection methods in medical institutions (Haishima, 2000; Matsumoto, 2000; Takatsuki, 2000; Murata et al., 2004 ) and reports about a management system of infectious waste are rare (Hayashi and Shigematsu, 2000; Miyazaki, 2001 Miyazaki, , 2003 The Waste Disposal Law was amended in 2003 and the revised regulation including new criteria for the infectious waste management was provided in 2004 by the Ministry of Environment. The purpose of this study was to introduce the new criteria and a summary of the revised regulation about the management of infectious waste materials for medical institutions in Japan.",

Waste workers of a medical institution collect all infectious waste materials from special storage spots and transport them to a restricted place where a special infectious waste business (contractor) collects them. Waste workers wear gloves and a mask while at work. A contractor directly transports infectious waste materials to an incinerator which is authorized by a prefectural government, and these wastes materials are burnt by more than 800\u00b0C soon after collection. In Japan, because infectious waste materials disposed of from medical institutions are not collected and transported by the municipal governments, a medical institution is responsible for the associated expense. Each medical institution, therefore, must contract a specified business authorized by a prefectural government for the treatment of infectious waste, and disposal cost is becoming a serious matter. The collection and transportation price is determined by the quantity of waste, transportation distance and frequency, a container price, and an incineration price.",

However, not all medical institutions have obtained accurate information on each infectious waste handling business including their qualities (such as the number of years dealing in infectious waste and the existence of violations) and a treatment price. A contract with a dishonest business induces a cost for handling of infectious waste for as little as Yen 100 or less (Miyazaki, 2001) . In such a case, illegal dumping often occurs. To prevent the illegal dumping of infectious waste materials; An information network needs to be established by the cooperative harmony of the stakeholders including the Ministry of Environment.",

Intensive education on proper infectious waste procedures should be provided through lectures, posters, and handouts. In addition, various reusable items, such as linens, should be positively utilized to reduce infectious waste materials. Both the education of personnel concerned (including medical staffs and waste workers) and accurate information on special infectious waste businesses are indispensable to appropriately treat and dispose of infectious waste. Moreover, monitoring workers\u00d5 compliance and direct feedback of information, such as a disposal cost and a quantity of infectious waste, are also considered essential for the continued success in reducing infectious waste materials. The potential for causing infection varies greatly depending on the sharpness and quality of waste. Strict adherence to the revised regulation by medical institutions can thus protect waste workers from being infected.",

Infectious waste must be managed in accordance with the Waste Disposal Law of 2003 and the rules promulgated in 2004 by the Ministry of Environment. Infectious waste materials are to be collected and segregated from other wastes, and transported to incinerators where they are combusted by a special waste handling business with which a medical institution contracts. Disposal costs are, however, becoming expensive. Therefore, medical institutions should make every effort to reduce infectious waste generated in their facilities. Due to the increase in the quantity and to the diversified quality of waste materials disposed of from medical institutions, the management of such materials has become increasingly important in order to protect waste workers from infection. The revised regulation is expected to encourage the reduction of infectious waste and to protect waste workers from being infected.",
