Because the geographic distribution of diseases is dynamic and influenced by ecologic, genetic, and human factors, travel allows humans to interact with microbes and introduce pathogens into new locations and populations. The increased numbers of travelers and their spatial mobility have reduced geographic barriers for microbes and heightened the potential for spread of infectious diseases.",

Many travelers on cruise ships are older and have chronic medical conditions, and therefore may be susceptible to more severe consequences of infections. The confined and crowded environs on cruise ships allow easy transmission of pathogens. The short durations of most cruises can allow an infected passenger to reach another location before onset of symptoms. The most commonly identified pathogens in cruise ship outbreaks have been norovirus and influenza, but Salmonella, Shigella, Staphylococcus, V cholerae and other vibrios, Legionella, Corynebacterium diphtheriae, and rubella have also been implicated. 10, 11 Sources of gastrointestinal disease on cruise ships include water (eg, contaminated by sewage, inadequate disinfection, improper storage), food (poor handling, preparation, cooking), and use of sea water in the galley. 10 During 2006, an unusually high number of norovirus outbreaks occurred on cruise ships. By July 5, 2006, 13 cruise ships traveling around Europe had reported 35 outbreaks of gastrointestinal infection. 12 In all, investigators confirmed 43 outbreaks on 13 cruise ships. 13 The norovirus from stool or environmental samples were of two distinct lineages of the GGII.4 genotype, which emerged separately in Europe and Pacific and caused concurrent outbreaks in the community. 13 The cruise ship outbreaks were The Role of the Traveler in Emerging Infections an early indicator of increased activity in the region and revealed strains that originated in distant locations. Legionella is another pathogen associated with cruise ships, with more than 200 cases reported. 10 A single cruise ship from New York to Bermuda was associated with 50 cases during nine separate voyages in 1994, with the whirlpool spa as the source. 14 On another cruise ship, eight German passengers contracted legionellosis (attack rate, 4%), also linked to the spa pool. 15 Transmission of pathogens also occurs on aircraft. Infections spread by the airborne or large droplet route are of greatest concern in aircraft transmission, and include influenza, meningococcal infections, measles, tuberculosis, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). However, the most commonly documented infections transmitted on aircraft have spread through contaminated food: Salmonella, Staphylococcus, norovirus, and cholera. 16 Most foodborne transmissions on aircraft result from food contaminated before the flight. Only those with a short incubation manifest during the flight; most often toxin-related (eg, staphylococcal) or, rarely, infections such as V cholerae on a long flight.",

A survey found 8 of the 14 crew members had symptom onset during flight. Stool specimens from two hospitalized crew members had noroviruses with identical sequences using polymerase chain reaction. Among 93 passengers who returned the survey, 5 had probable norovirus gastroenteritis (5.4%). 17 In-flight transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is also possible. M tuberculosis is transmissible through large droplets and droplet nuclei with productive cough, and a single organism can cause infection. 18 In 1994, a patient who had multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) traveled on commercial flights from Honolulu to Chicago, Chicago to Baltimore, and returned a month later. 19 Contact tracing, questionnaire, and skin testing found up to 6% skin test conversions, with greatest risk in passengers seated within two rows of the case patient (31% conversion). 19 Another traveler with MDR TB flew on a commercial airline from Delhi, India, to Chicago, Illinois, in December 2007. 20 The incident required coordinated efforts among the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and multiple organizations (the airline, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. state and local health departments, and the Indian Ministry of Family Welfare) to notify and follow up on passengers and crew that may have been exposed.",

In 1968 to 1969, 160 million persons traveled internationally on commercial flights. 25 The Hong Kong influenza strain of 1968 to 1969 spread globally through the network of cities by air travel: first to northern latitudes, then southern latitudes. 25 Modeling of the epidemic with air transportation data in 2000 for 52 cities showed that influenza would spread concurrently to cities in both hemispheres, resulting in minimal seasonal swing and little time for public health intervention. 26 Disease would reach nearby cities first, but also distant cities with high air travel volumes; a pandemic initiating in Hong Kong can now spread speedily to northern hemisphere cities 111 days earlier than in 1968. 26 Understanding the local ecology and linkages through travel can provide projection of disease spread.",

Travelers can be victims, sentinels, couriers, processors, and transmitters of microbial pathogens. 27 Conversely, arrival of travelers can affect host populations through contact with diverse groups of people and microbes throughout their trip and sharing environments sequentially. Travel should be considered a loop and not just an origin and destination. 27 Travel can be associated with behavior that leads to transmission of pathogens through blood and body fluid exposure. Travelers may engage in sexual activities or pursue extreme sports or other injury-prone activities that they would not risk at home. A survey assessing possible exposures to hepatitis B among more than 9000 European travelers found that most had potential risk (60.8%-75.8%), including holiday romance (12.5% of all travelers), with 6.6%-11.2% at high risk. 28 A Canadian study found that 15% of travelers had potential exposure to blood and body fluids through vehicles such as new sexual partner (9%); sharing instruments, such as razor or toothbrush (5%); receiving injection for medical treatment (3.2%); having acupuncture or other percutaneous nontraditional treatment (1%); tattooing or body piercing (0.5%); and abrasive injury (0.5%). 29 Other investigators found that 5.6% of tourists departing from Cuzco engaged in sexual activity with a new partner during their stay. 30 Although most reported having sex with other travelers (54.3%), some had sex with local partners (40.7%) or commercial sex workers (2.15%). 30 Sexually transmitted infections (including hepatitis B, HIV, and HTLV-1) acquired during travel can further spread during the journey and after return home.",

In 2002, a previously unrecognized coronavirus caused an outbreak of respiratory infections in the Guangdong Province of China. The virus apparently jumped species from civet cats to humans, although subsequent research suggests that the reservoir host is the fruit bat. 31 The outbreak became visible to the world community when an infected physician from Guangdong, who stayed for a day in Hotel Metropole in Hong Kong, was the source of infection for multiple hotel guests, who then disseminated the virus to numerous other countries. By May, more than 8000 SARS infections had been reported. 32 By July, 29 countries and territories across five continents reported outbreaks and attributed 774 fatalities to SARS. 32 Transmission of SARS on aircraft occurred at rates of 0% to 18.3%, and occurred as far as seven rows from the source passenger. 33 One particular SARS case showed the potential for rapid international dispersion of a pathogen that is spread from person to person. 34 A businessman flew from Hong Kong to Frankfurt, Germany, on March 30, 2003 . He traveled on seven flights throughout Europe during a 5-day period, including stops in Barcelona, London, Munich, and Hong Kong. He was hospitalized in Hong Kong on April 8 for suspected SARS, subsequently confirmed on April 10. 34 Responding to SARS outbreak, the CDC issued advisories to avoid travel to the SARS-affected countries. Most countries in Asia instituted strict quarantine measures and restricted travel to reduce cross-border spread and as intracountry spread. The CDC temporarily suspended international adoption from China because of concern for dissemination.",

The African animals, which had unrecognized monkeypox infection, were housed with prairie dogs that were sold as pets. 80 Dogs brought in from rabies-endemic areas have been an occasional source of rabies in Europe. Movement of avian species, including exotic birds sold to falconers, can be a potential route for introduction of H5N1 or other microbes potentially pathogenic for humans (Fig. 4) . 81 Some of these infections have the potential for persistence and dissemination in a new geographic region.",

Among 47 ports outside the original distribution of A albopictus, it invaded just more than half. Those invaded had similar climate and high sea traffic volumes. The authors concluded that ''when climatic suitabilities are similar, shipping volume alone appears to determine invasion probability.'' 82 These studies may be useful in trying to identify areas at highest risk so that strict surveillance and control activities can be instituted.

GeoSentinel is a network of travel medicine clinics developed through a collaborative agreement between the International Society of Travel Medicine and the CDC. Participants collect information on travel-related illnesses and report on unusual illnesses in travelers. 92 The GeoSentinel network now has 40 sites located in six continents. GeoSentinel analyses of illnesses in travelers help define geographic areas associated with risk for specific diseases, and thereby improve the health preparation of travelers. 93 A recent GeoSentinel report on schistosomiasis in travelers returning from Tanzania alerted clinicians to exposure associated with swimming in an artificial pond. An analysis of dengue cases in the GeoSentinel database showed periodic increases, and the cyclic pattern corresponded to epidemics in Southeast Asia, illustrating usefulness of travelers as a sentinel population. 94 GeoSentinel has notably reported on leptospirosis associated with Eco-Challenge in Borneo, SARS in Canadian travelers returning to from Asia, and malaria from resort holidays in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic.

Finally, diagnoses of travelers in resource-rich regions can yield knowledge about infectious disease agents acquired in resource-poor areas. This knowledge can be used to alert the global community to the presence or susceptibility patterns of pathogens in different regions; inform strategies that can be used to control infections in developing countries; and prepare travelers to those areas and guide the care of those returning.
