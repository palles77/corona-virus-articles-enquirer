SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), Western blot and neutralization test results showed that the IgY obtained was of a high purity and had a strong reactive activity with a neutralization titer of 1:640. Lyophilization and stability tests showed that lyophilized anti-SARS coronavirus IgY had promising physical properties, with no significant reduction in reactive activity and good thermal stability.

During the outbreak of SARS in China in 2003, some positive results were achieved by passive immunization when the sera of recovered SARS patients were used. No adverse reactions were observed in the first vaccinated volunteers. In order to provide new and effective passive immunization against SARS, basic studies on the SARS coronavirus antibody should be carried out. These studies should include searching for better antibody sources, increasing output and improving techniques of production and purification. In this study, we have successfully immunized specific pathogen-free (SPF) chickens, and then purified a high-titer anti-SARS coronavirus yolk immunoglobulin (IgY) with neutralizing activity against SARS coronavirus.",

Thirty 17-week-old SPF Leghorn hens were provided by the Experimental Animal Center of the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Harbin, China. Chickens were immunized by injecting 0.18 mg of SARS coronavirus antigen into the pectoral muscle. The second and third booster injections of 0.30 mg antigen were administered 2 and 4 weeks later. Blood was harvested before and after each immunization and eggs were harvested when they became available. The isolation of IgY from individual eggs was performed using the protocol described by Akita and Nakai (1993) . Briefly, the egg white was separated from the egg yolk and discarded. The yolk was mixed vigorously with sterilized water and left standing overnight at 4 \u2022 C. The mixture was then centrifuged at 1200 \u00d7 g at 4 \u2022 C for 30 min, and the supernatant was purified by chromatography The protein concentration in harvested eluate was measured by thin-layer gel scan. The recovery rate of crude protein before chromatography was found to be 56% while the purity was 92% after chromatography. The eluate was subjected to analysis by SDSpolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blot. The isolated IgY had a high purity as confirmed by SDS-PAGE and purified IgY had good biological activity as confirmed by Western blot. The activity of IgY in sera and yolks diluted at 1:200 in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) from immunized animals was assessed using an indirect ELISA assay as described previously (Huang et al., 2005) (Fig. 1) . After immunization of SPF chickens with SARS coronavirus antigen, there were no detectable antibodies against SARS coronavirus in the yolks of eggs laid in the first 3 weeks after the first immunization. The production of anti-SARSV antibody in yolks was found to commence 2 weeks after the IgY was produced in serum. An IgY-neutralizing virus assay was performed in laminarflow safety cabinets. Briefly, serially diluted samples of the IgY were incubated with 200 TCID 50 of SARS coronavirus at 37 \u2022 C for 1 h, then inoculated onto VERO E6 cells and incubated at 37 \u2022 C in a CO 2 incubator. Uninfected VERO E6 cells and SARSpositive serum or SPF chicken serum were used as controls for this experiment. The IgY did not react with Vero cells when tested by indirect fluorescent antibody technique. Infectivity titers were calculated using a standard TCID 50 assay. The highest antibody dilution that inhibited cytopathic effect in 50% of the VERO E6 cells inoculated with this dilution was regarded as the 50% neutralization titer. The results of neutralization experiments (Table 1) indicated that yolk antibody till 1:640 dilution was effective in neutralizing the SARS coronavirus, and were consistent with the ELISA result when extracted yolk antibody was used.",

The advantages of SPF chicken IgY over antibodies from other mammals include a high concentration and freedom from specific pathogens, making the use of IgY a broader prospect for development (Schade et al., 1992; Tini et al., 2002) . The IgY from SPF chickens in our study maintained good biological and neutralization activity at environmental conditions. The recovery rate after purification by water dilution and the level of purity after further purification were promising, the binding of IgY remained unchanged after lyophilization, also making it feasible for the product that had been prepared in this way to be used for passive immunization and short-term protection.",

Long-term control of SARS, however, will require a combination of active and passive immunizations, drug therapy and other comprehensive measures. It is therefore of vital importance to be able to produce vaccines and passive immunization products for effective control of SARS. The development of high-titer anti-SARS coronavirus IgY described in this study would appear to have potential as a new anti-SARS biological product for passive immunization, as it effectively neutralized the SARS coronavirus. In the present study, anti-SARS IgY was already prepared as a crude and purified product, while an indirect ELISA test was used for quality control of IgY production. To facilitate the process of mass production of purified IgY, the techniques of degreasing and purification would be key points for further study. After evaluation using experimentally infected animal models, anti-SARS IgY produced in this study has the potential to be commercially manufactured. The efficency of capsules produced from crude IgY or spray powder and intravenous solution manufactured from more highly refined IgY will need to be determined as the next step in development of IgY products.",
