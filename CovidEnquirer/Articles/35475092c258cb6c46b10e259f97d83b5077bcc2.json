Analysis of transmission dynamics of infectious diseases can lead to the better methodologies to slow their transmission. Since the start of twentieth century, a lot of work has been done on construction of epidemic models for infectious diseases such as chicken pox, diphtheria, gonorrhea, influenza, malaria, rabies, rubella, whooping cough and SARS. Models have also been developed for sexually transmitted diseases like syphilis, HIV=AIDS, and child diseases like measles and polio. These models ranges from simple curve fitting models to standard compartmental models [1] (MSEIR; MSEIRS; SEIJR; SIR; SIRS, SEIR; SEIS; SI, and SIS etc.) to complex stochastic models. Fast computer systems and the availability of huge data bases has made it possible to use complex mathematical models to analyze the data.",

In 1906, Hamer constructed and analyzed a discrete time model in order to understand the reoccurrence of measles epidemics. His model was probably the first to assume that the incidence (number of new cases per unit time) depends on the product of the densities of the susceptibles and infectives [9] . Ross [9] was interested in the prevalence and control of malaria and he developed deterministic model for malaria as a host-vector disease in 1911. Other deterministic epidemiological models were then developed by Ross, Ross and Hudson, Martini and Lotka [9] . Kermack and McKendrick are considered as the pioneers in mathematical modeling in epidemiology with the publication of a series of papers in 1926. In their work they calculated the epidemic threshold and showed that an outbreak of an epidemic could -coccur only if the number of susceptible individuals exceed the critical value called the reproduction number. Mathematical epidemiology seems to have grown rapidly since then as a large variety of models have been formulated, mathematically analyzed and applied to infectious diseases [9] . The first edition of Bailey's book, which appeared in 1957, is an important landmark in the history of mathematical biology [9] .",

            "text": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is one of the recently emerged infectious diseases. This is a viral respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus, called SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). It was in November 2002, when the first case of SARS was diagnosed in the Chinese province of Guangdong. At the end of February 2003, the SARS epidemic spread around the world, when a medical doctor from Guangdong infected several persons in a hotel in Kowloon. SARS also spread globally through air travel. According to the estimates of WHO; 8450 people were infected and 810 deaths were recorded due to SARS in 33 countries on 5 continents [15] . Although this outbreak of the disease was brought under control at the end of 2003, many separate outbreaks of SARS appeared in Singapore, Taiwan and China. The main reason for this was the release of SARS-CoV accidently from laboratories [15] . The animals infected by the SARS-CoV strain also infected humans and at the start of 2004 some new cases of this disease came to notice. Both incidents show the danger of SARS outbreak at any time in the near future, either by SARS-CoV virus evolving from SARS-CoV-like virus from animals or by virus from laboratory samples. There is a SARS-CoV-like virus, also found in animals, but it is not transferable and thus cannot cause SARS-like disease. It is possible that under special circumstances, this virus may get converted into the early human SARS-CoV, with an ability to transfer from animals to humans [8] .",

In the beginning, epidemiologist, tried to find out the reasons for the cause and spread of SARS. They tried to find measures to control it, but the main emphasis was on research work concerned with the biological properties of the corona virus [16] . Some work was done to investigate the transmission dynamics and the effect of various control measures. Most of the study on SARS was done in China, where the SARS epidemic hit the hardest. This work was published in Chinese journals, which were poorly accessible to international researchers. Xia et al. [17] analyzed the pattern of SARS and predicted the course of the SARS epidemic by establishing a compartmental model using data from Guangdong and Hong Kong. Chowell et al. [5] fitted an SEIJR model for SARS epidemic for the data from Toronto, Hong Kong and Singapore. Chowell predicted the behavior of the disease and the role of diagnosis and isolation as a control mechanism in these regions showing the difference between the epidemic dynamics occurred in these three cities. Yang et al. [19] established a compartmental model to describe the SARS epidemic in spatialtemporal dimensions determining whether people traveling in buses and trains infect one another or not. They concluded that SARS can spread through people traveling in buses and trains. In their SEIR models based on data from Beijing and Hong Kong, Wu et al. [14] and Chen et al. [4] estimated the source of super-spreading events of SARS with the calculation of the reproductive rate of the disease based on data from Beijing and Hong Kong.",

Here the susceptible population decreases slowly in the first five days of disease but after that there is a rapid decrease till t \u00bc 20 days. There is a rapid increase in population exposed to disease in the first five days and this increase continues till t \u00bc 10. It slows down however after five days. After ten days there is a quick decrease in exposed individuals. Only a few individuals are in the exposed compartment after fifteen days. There is a slow increase in infected individuals till the fifth day. But a sudden increase in infected is observed in the next five days. After reaching maximum level, a decline in infected is observed till t \u00bc 15. With the increase of infected individuals, the number of diagnosed has also increased rapidly but after attaining the maximum in the first ten days of disease, there is a slow decrease till t \u00bc 15. After that a quick decline is observed at t \u00bc 20. Recovered individuals increase slowly in first ten days of disease but after that a rapid increase in recovery is observed. Fig. 4 , shows the output with initial condition \u00f0ii\u00de without diffusion. Here the proportion of the susceptible population decreases rapidly between 5-10 days and after that there is very low level of susceptible population. The population becomes exposed very quickly during first five days. After ten days, there is a sudden decrease which continues till t \u00bc 20 days. Infected individuals increase for the first ten days with rapid increase between 5-10 days. After that there is a rapid decrease till t \u00bc 15. Then a decrease occurs slowly till t \u00bc 20. The proportion of diagnosed shows an increase till t \u00bc 10 and after that diagnosed individuals reduce with a quick fall between t \u00bc 15 and 20 days. Recovery is slow initially but after t = 10, it is fairly quick. Fig. 5 , shows the output with initial condition \u00f0iii\u00de and without diffusion. The behavior of the susceptible is quite different as compared to the initial conditions \u00f0i\u00de and \u00f0ii\u00de. Susceptible move to the right of the initial domain of concentration slowly and slowly without much change in proportion of susceptible population. Initially the main concentration of the susceptible population is in the interval \u00bd0; 2 but at t \u00bc 20 this shifts to \u00bd0:6; 2. More and more of the population become exposed during t = 10 to 20 days of onset of the disease. During the first five days of the onset of SARS, the proportion of infected people goes down in its domain \u00bd\u00c02; 0 and after that starts moving to domain \u00bd0; 2 with gradual increase. A sharp increase is observed between t \u00bc 10 and 20 days \u00bd0; 1. The number of diagnosed individuals increases during the first five days in the domain \u00bd\u00c02; 0. After that diagnosed individuals decrease with a slow pace. Also the concentration of the diagnosed moves to the domain \u00bd0; 2. A rapid increase of diagnosed can be seen between t \u00bc 15 and 20 days. Till t \u00bc 10 recovery increases in the domain \u00bd\u00c02; 0 and slowly moves to domain \u00bd0; 1. From t \u00bc 15 to t \u00bc 20 recovery attains maximum values in the domain \u00bd0; 1. Fig. 6 , shows the output with the initial condition \u00f0iv\u00de and without diffusion. Susceptible individuals decrease rapidly after t \u00bc 5. At t \u00bc 15, the susceptible reduce to a very low level of concentration. Exposed individuals reach the maximum level in first five days and after that start reducing. Infected individuals increase till t \u00bc 10 and after that there is a sudden fall till t \u00bc 20. Diagnosed individuals increase in the first ten days and after that there is a gradual decrease. There is gradual increase in recovered individuals as shown in Fig. 6 . Fig. 7 , shows the output with initial condition \u00f0i\u00de and with diffusion. With the inclusion of diffusion in the system, susceptible spread in the entire region at t \u00bc 5 with peak value 0:2228567. Initially exposed are mainly confined in domain \u00bd\u00c01; 1:5. At t \u00bc 5 exposed spread in the domain \u00bd\u00c01; 1:5 with peak value 0:118055. At t \u00bc 10, exposed spread in the whole domain with peak value 0:068133. After this a rapid decrease in the exposed individuals occurs. Infected individuals spread in the whole domain \u00bd\u00c02; 2 with the passage of time and at t \u00bc 10, infected individual attains its maximum with peak value 0:077894. After this there is a fall in the infected individuals and at t \u00bc 20, there is very low level of infected individuals. A steady spread of diagnosed is observed in the main domain \u00bd\u00c02; 2. At t \u00bc 10 diagnosed are observed in the entire domain with peak value 0:105364. After t \u00bc 10, there starts a decrease in the diagnosed population. Recovery starts spreading in the domain and at t \u00bc 20 days, it completely spreads over the whole domain with peak value 0:383669. Fig. 8 , represents the results with the initial condition \u00f0ii\u00de and with diffusion. Susceptible quickly spreads in the whole domain \u00bd\u00c02; 2 with low peak value 0:129482 at t \u00bc 5. In the first five days exposed spread in the domain \u00bd\u00c01; 1 with peak value 0:117691. In first ten days, exposed spread to whole domain with peak value 0:040644. After ten days the maximum proportion of population gets infected and spread in the main domain \u00bd\u00c02; 2. Though the population in the whole domain \u00bd\u00c02; 2 is infected but main concentration of infected lies in domain \u00bd\u00c01; 1. At time t \u00bc 10, diagnosed spread over the whole domain with peak value 0:085846. Diagnosed thereafter start reducing and at time t \u00bc 15 days reduce to peak value Table 7 Peak values of susceptible (S) and exposed (E) (without diffusion). 0:051532. Recovery starts slowly and spread to domain \u00bd\u00c00:6; 0:6 at t \u00bc 5. At t \u00bc 20, recovered are spread over the whole domain with peak value 0:311524. Fig. 9 , shows the results with the initial condition \u00f0iii\u00de and with diffusion. Susceptible spread from the initial domain of concentration \u00bd0; 2 to the domain \u00bd\u00c01:5; 2 at t \u00bc 5. After 5 days, susceptible start moving back. Susceptible are confined to the domain \u00bd0:5; 2 at t \u00bc 15. Exposed individuals also shifts from domain \u00bd\u00c02; 0 to \u00bd0; 2 with the passage of time. Initially Table 9 Peak values of susceptible (S) and exposed (E) (with diffusion). infectives are confined to domain \u00bd\u00c02; 0. Infected spread at very slow pace and a small pulse with peak value 0:004476 can be observed at t \u00bc 5. After 10 days, the domain of concentration of infected people moves to \u00bd\u00c01; 1. At t \u00bc 15, infection spread in the whole domain \u00bd\u00c02; 2. At t \u00bc 5, a small proportion of diagnosed remain in the domain \u00bd\u00c02; 0. There is, however, a rapid increase in the number of diagnosed with peak value 0:074575 at t \u00bc 20. At t \u00bc 5, recovery is restricted to the domain \u00bd\u00c02; 0. After 20 days, recovered spread in the domain \u00bd\u00c02; 2, with peak value 0:206879. Fig. 10 , shows the results with initial condition \u00f0iv\u00de and with diffusion. A sudden fall in the susceptible is observed at t \u00bc 5 with peak value 0:005466. During the same time, exposed spread to domain \u00bd\u00c01:5; 1:5 with peak value 0:043322. At t \u00bc 10, infected spread in the domain \u00bd\u00c01:8; 1:8 with peak value 0:010391. At t \u00bc 5, diagnosed spread to domain\u00bd\u00c01; 1 with peak value 0:033966. Diagnosed spread further in the domain \u00bd\u00c01:8; 1:8 at t \u00bc 15 with peak value 0:01385. Recovery initially occurs in the domain \u00bd\u00c01; 1 at t \u00bc 5 with peak value 0:045636. There is a further increase of recovered at t \u00bc 10 with peak value 0:106593. At t \u00bc 20 there is maximum recovery with peak value 0:147773.",

            "text": "An SEIJR Model for SARS (Chowell et al. [5] ) is considered with the inclusion of diffusion in the system. Four different initial conditions are taken for the population distribution. The equation governing the system are solved numerically using operator splitting method. The reproduction number R 0 is calculated for the disease. It is shown that disease dies out for R 0 < 1, in disease free equilibrium. It however prevails for endemic equilibrium, where R 0 > 1 as shown in Table 11 . Stability of solutions with and without diffusion is established using Routh-Hurwitz conditions as shown in Tables 2 and 3 Numerical solution with initial condition \u00f0i\u00de, as shown in Figs. 3 and 7 , that in the absence of diffusion, only the population in the domain \u00bd\u00c01; 1:5 becomes susceptible, but when diffusion is introduced susceptible spread over the whole domain in first five days. Similarly the exposed remain confined in the interval \u00bd\u00c01; 1:5 in the absence of diffusion. But with diffusion population outside the domain \u00bd\u00c01; 1:5 also become exposed to infection and after ten days exposed population spread to whole domain. With and without diffusion in the system, infection reached to its peak in first ten days. With the inclusion of diffusion, however, infection spreads over the whole domain \u00bd\u00c02; 2. Recovered also follows the same pattern. Numerical solution of initial condition \u00f0ii\u00de, as shown in Figs. 4 and 8 , follows the same pattern as in condition \u00f0i\u00de with only difference in concentration of population in different domain. In the absence of diffusion infective population fluctuate inside the domain \u00bd\u00c0:5; :5, but with diffusion in the system fluctuations follows with the spread in the whole domain after ten days Numerical solution with initial condition \u00f0iii\u00de, as shown in Figs. 5 and 9, shows the main concentration of susceptible shifts slightly to right of domain \u00bd0; 2 in 20 days. Infected move to domain \u00bd0; 2 from domain \u00bd\u00c02; 0 and with that diagnosed and recovered also follow the same pattern. With diffusion in the system Susceptible start spreading to the left of the domain \u00bd\u00c02; 2 but are mainly confined in \u00bd\u00c00:8; 2. Exposed grows in the smaller domain \u00bd\u00c01; 0:5 first and then with passage of time spread in the domain \u00bd\u00c01:5; 2. Infected shifts their domain from \u00bd\u00c02; 0 to \u00bd\u00c01; 2 followed with decrease, increase and then again decrease in proportion. Thus with diffusion more individuals get infected within a short time and infection spreads quickly and reaches its maximum in 15 days covering almost the whole domain. In the absence of diffusion the maximum number of infected are observed after twenty days in domain \u00bd0; 1, reflecting the intensity of infection more than that with diffusion during the same time. A large proportion of population is recovered with diffusion in the system during the same time as compared to without diffusion. Numerical solution with initial condition \u00f0iv\u00de, as shown in Figs. 6 and 10, demonstrate that diffusion causes the infection to spread out from domain \u00bd\u00c0:7; :7 to \u00bd\u00c02; 2. The intensity of the infection also becomes less than the initial intensity as it spreads to \u00bd\u00c01:5; 1:5.",

Hence four cases are produced to see the effect on the spread of disease. Bifurcation values of transmission coefficient b and recovery coefficients c 1 and c 2 are calculated. It is observed that diffusion causes an increase in the bifurcation value of b and a decrease in the value of recovery coefficients. This shows that the system can be stable for larger value of b and smaller values of recovery rates c 1 and c 2 in the presence of diffusion.",
