When NA cells pretreated with rAAV-N796 were challenged with RAbV, there was a 37.8 \u00b1 3.4% to 55.1 \u00b1 5.3% reduction in RAbV virus titer. When cells pre-challenged with RAbV were treated with rAAV-N796, there was a 4.4 \u00b1 1.4 to 28.8 \u00b1 3.2% reduction in RABV virus titer. Relative quantification of RABV transcripts using real-time PCR and Western blot revealed that the knockdown of RAbV-N gene transcripts was based on the rAAV-N796 inoculation titer. When any NA cells were treated with rAAV-N796 before or after challenged with RABV, significant reduction in virus titer was observed in both administrations. Mice treated intracerebrally with rAAV-N796 exhibited 50 \u00b1 5.3 and 62.5 \u00b1 4.7% protection when challenged intracerebrally or intramuscally, respectively, with lethal RAbV. When mice treated intramuscularly with rAAV-N796 were challenged intramuscularly with lethal RAbV, they exhibited 37.5 \u00b1 3.7% protection. When mice were intracerebrally and intramuscularly with rAAV-N796 24 hr after exposure to RAbV infection, they exhibited 25 \u00b1 4.1% protection The N gene mRNA levels in the brains of challenged mice with three different administrations were reduced (55, 68, 32 and 25%, respectively). These results indicated that AAV2 vector-mediated siRNA delivery in vitro in NA cells inhibited RAbV multiplication, inhibited RAbV multiplication in vivo in the mice brain and imparted partial protection against lethal rabies. So, it may have a potential to be used as an alternative antiviral approach against rabies.",

Rabies cases are reported worldwide, but are most prevalent in undeveloped countries, specifically in rural areas of Africa and Asia. No definitive and effective treatment has been established to cure the disease once the clinical stage has been reached, and only a small portion of clinical cases responds to intensive therapeutic management and survives [19] . Once the clinical symptoms of rabies appear, conventional post-exposure treatment is unsuccessful, because of its inability to cross the blood-brain barrier [9] . Thus, the current strategy to control rabies is pre-exposure prophylaxis by vaccine injection, but research efforts are focused on developing an effective, safe prophylactic and/or therapeutic tool against RAbV infection.",

Moreover, we selected the most conserved sequences of the N transcript for use as RNAi targets. widely used in delivering various genes and siRNAs. but, these viral vectors could stimulate host immune response and produce a specific antibody against viral vectors, which would restrict the use again in the same host. In addition to unwanted activation of the immune response, the safety concerns also involve off-targeting effects. AAV vectors have been highly successful in overcoming these disadvantages. They are currently among the most frequently used viral vectors for gene therapy. Twelve human serotypes of AAV (AAV-1 to AAV-12) and more than 100 serotypes from nonhuman primates have been discovered to date [4] . The characterization of new AAV serotypes has revealed that they have different patterns of transduction in diverse tissues [3] . AAV has become increasingly common as a vector for use in human clinical trials, such as immunodeficiency disease [5] , muscle directed gene therapy [6] and lung disease [12] . AAV-2-based rAAV vectors can transduce muscle, the liver, the brain, the retina and the lungs [4] . rAAV2 has emerged as a vector of choice for gene transfer to the central nervous system, because of its strong neuronal tropism and lack of pathogenicity in mammals [4] . Moreover, AAV-2 has been shown to induce a weak cellmediated immune response. This may be attributed to AAV inefficiently infecting mature dendritic cells (DC) [22] . So, in this study, we made use of an AAV-2 vector to deliver the siRNA targeting the RAbV N gene. The results in the in vitro (NA cells) and in vivo (mice brain and muscle) experiments showed that AAV-2 can work as a good siRNA delivery tool.",

So, the gene expression time would be later than other double-stranded DNA virus vectors. In the in vitro experiment, if rAAV-N796 treatment was later than RAbV infection, the antiviral effect was not displayed at 24 and 48 hr post infection, but was displayed at 72 and 96 hr post infection (Fig. 2b) . The reason for this may be ascribe to the later gene expression. After the AAV-2 synthesizes the second-strand, shRNA begins to be transcribed by the U6 promoter. During the time of second-strand synthesis, the replication of RAbV was not inhibited, and the virus has replicated for several cycles. The RAbV titers of rAAV-N796 and rAAV-Neg treatment groups were both increased with the same efficiency. So, the antiviral effect was not observed in early infection.",

So, in the in vivo experiment, the antiviral effect of intracerebral inoculation with rAAV-N796 (50 and 62% survival, respectively) was better than with intramuscular inoculation (38% survival). Whether the transduction efficiency in muscle is higher than in the brain needs to be investigated further. The survival rate of the intracerebral inoculation and infection group (50% survival) was lower than that of the intracerebral inoculation and intramuscular infection group (63% survival). After infection with RAbV, the time until symptoms were shown was associated with the site of infection. Once RAbV is introduced through the skin or mucous membrane, it replicates in the myocytes for hours or weeks and then migrates to nerves. If RAbV was introduced into the brain, it would replicate quickly. During the process of RAbV entry into brain from masseter muscle, rAAV-N796 has more time to transduce the neural cells and produce more siRNA than direct intracerebral infection. So, the antiviral effect of intracerebral inoculation and intramuscular infection was better than that of intracerebral inoculation and infection.",

In the in vivo experiment, rAAV-N796 pretreatment did not achieve complete protection, which may be associated with the inoculation dose of rAAV-N796. The biggest rAAV titer achieved in our lab through co-transfection in HEK293 cells is 4 \u00d7 10 11 vg/ml. So, a better method to produce rAAV particles needs to be established. The production of rAAV vectors in insect cells via the use of recombinant baculovirus technology has proven to be an efficient and scalable means of rAAV production. The yield of genome-containing particles produced per Sf9 cell approached 5 \u00d7 10 4 ; thus, 1,000 ml of cultured Sf9 cells produced the equivalent of between 500 to 1,000 \u00d7 175 cm 2 flasks of 293 cells. This robust system provides a simple, cost-effective method for AAV vector production [18] . However, to achieve complete protection, other siRNAs targeting the RAbV gene, the rAAV titer and the timing of therapeutic administration should be assessed to generate an optimal treatment strategy [20] .",

Other NA cells were first challenged with 0.01 MOI of RABV and then treated with rAAV-N796 and rAAV-Neg (b). At different time points post challenge, the virus titer of RAbV was detected. (2) NA cells were firstly treated with rAAV-N796 and rAAV-Neg, respectively, with the titer of 1, 10 and 100 vg/cell and then challenged with 0.01 MOI of RAbV. At 72 hr post infection, the cells were collected for assay of the N gene mRNA level (C) and protein expression level (E). In another group of NA cells, the cells were first challenged with RABV and then treated with the same titers of rAAV-N796 and rAAV-Neg mentioned above.

The sequence is very conserved in most of RAbV strains. So, rAAV-N796 should be effective against RAbV strains other than CVS-11 strain. Viral vectors used as the delivery tool for siRNA are one of the major vehicles used by scientists in gene therapy to get their sequences expressed in the proper host. Viral vectors, including adenovirus, retrovirus and lentivirus, are undoubtedly efficient tools for gene delivery. They have been",
