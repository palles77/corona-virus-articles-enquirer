[1] show that circulation of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia is much lower than was feared, announced, or predicted. One year after the discovery of this novel coronavirus, the Saudi Arabian Virology Reference Laboratory has tested 5065 people for MERS-CoV direct detection with WHO-recommended real-time RT-PCR tests [2, 3] . Interestingly, no significant increase in detection rates was observed in a period of 1 year. Moreover, mass gatherings of people in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia during the Hajj pilgrimage in 2012 and 2013 were associated with neither an increased number of cases nor reported clusters of cases [4] , suggesting poor or moderate interhuman transmission. The findings of this important study [1] are congruent with results reported in approximately 100 peer-reviewed published studies. They tend to temper the alarming initial predictions and claims for pandemic potential. On the other hand, one must remember that the alert dooes not halt the circulation of common pathogens, which silently cause many more casualties than the newcomer.",

Regarding this issue, overreaction (which is to be expected during the first weeks after the alert) should be moderated by the dissemination of reassuring evidence, if any, that the situation is less catastrophic than initially believed or predicted. For mysterious reasons, good news is rarely spread with enthusiasm in public media. Surprisingly, some scientists tend to follow the same trend, by acting as Cassandras and doommongers even when the scientific evidence contradicts this attitude, as exemplified with H5N1 and H7N9 influenza [7, 8] .",
