Effect on neonatal mortality was inconclusive (trained 28% vs usual care 25%, risk ratio 0.77, 95% CI 0.40 to 1.48; N = 27 deaths; low certainty evidence).

Provision of appropriate care however depends on the presence of skilled health personnel at the point of care delivery (WHO 2005) . To improve health workers' capacity to provide effective care for seriously ill newborns and children in low-income countries, various in-service training courses, based mainly on models of high-income countries, are proposed.

            "text": "Severe illness remains a leading cause of newborn and child deaths in low-income countries (LICs) (Liu 2012; Seale 2014). Major conditions contributing to severe illness include sepsis, pneumonia, meningitis and diarrhoea (Liu 2012; Seale 2014). Early recognition of severe illness with prevention of cardiorespiratory arrest through resuscitation represents a critical step towards reducing mortality and long-term disability in seriously ill newborns and children. However, the clinical diagnosis of severe illness can be difficult, as signs are often non-specific and deteriorate rapidly. Gove 1999; Molyneux 2006) . This course is specifically aimed at low-income countries and is intended to improve prompt identification and institution of life-saving emergency treatment for very ill children. The more general CDD and ARI programmes were developed by the WHO in 1980, in recognition of high childhood mortality due to diarrhoea/dehydration and pneumonia among very ill neonates and children; they focus on case management training rather than life support (Forsberg 2007; Pio 2003) . Although these courses concentrate on community-based or out-patient-based management, with good evidence for their success (Sazawal 2001), they also include guidance on management of very severe illness. These disease-specific training approaches were incorporated into the broader package of the IMCI strategy. Here the particular focus for management of the very ill child is the decision to provide prereferral care and referral to hospital. In addition to this, the WHO has developed a specific five-day course on hospital management of severe malnutrition (WHO 2002) .",

Apart from the sometimes high costs of providing courses (often recovered in high-income countries with high course fees), attendance at such courses often means that important staff are absent from their normal duties with potential disruption to patient care and, for some, loss of personal income (Jabbour 1996) . Despite their high costs, emergency care courses remain a thriving enterprise in many high-income countries, as is reflected in their ever increasing number and variety (Jewkes 2003) . In the hope that they might improve the quality of care in low-and middle-income countries, considerable global efforts and investments have gone into further development, refinement and adaptation of these courses to meet the needs of individual countries (Baskett 2005 ). Yet despite these investments and the faith placed in them by many organisations and institutions, evidence of their effectiveness in improving treatment of seriously ill newborns and children remains unclear. Several studies on in-service emergency care training for newborns and children have been completed since our original review was published, in 2010. Therefore an updated review of the effectiveness of these courses is needed.",

Re-analysis was possible for only one outcomepreparedness for resuscitation -for which baseline levels of resuscitation practices were comparable between study groups. In the re-analysis, we assessed training effect by computing mean differences in outcomes, using reported standard deviations to estimate standard errors. To account for clustering, we assumed an intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.015 (with a design effect of 1.129) that was based on published data (Rowe 2002). Review authors (NO and ME) independently assessed the certainty of evidence for each outcome using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) system (Guyatt 2008) . This approach classifies the certainty of evidence (defined as 'the extent to which one can be confident that an estimate of effect or association is correct') into one of four categories ('high', 'moderate', 'low' or 'very low'). We resolved disagreements on certainty ratings by discussion. We did not exclude studies on the basis of their GRADE certainty ratings; we took into account the certainty of evidence when synthesising overall findings.

Targeted behaviours included newborn resuscitation (Opiyo 2008) and general management/preparation and conduct of delivery care for newborns (Senarath 2007) . Postintervention data were collected over a period of 50 days in Opiyo 2008 and three months in Senarath 2007. Individual healthcare providers (n = 83) were randomly assigned in Opiyo 2008, and hospitals (n = 5) were randomly assigned in Senarath 2007. Both studies were adequately powered (90%) for primary outcomes. Neither study examined training/implementation costs. Opiyo 2008 assessed the effects of one-day newborn resuscitation training on health worker resuscitation practices in a maternity hospital in Kenya. The course, which was adapted from the UK Resuscitation Council,presented an A (airway), B (breathing), C (circulation) approach to resuscitation and laid down a clear step-by-step strategy for the first minutes of resuscitation at birth. Training included focused lectures and practical scenario sessions in which infant manikins were used. Participants were provided a course manual two weeks before training for self learning. Participants were randomly allocated to receive early training (n = 28) or late training (control group, n = 55). Data were collected on 97 and 115 resuscitation episodes over seven weeks after early and late training, respectively. Senarath 2007 assessed the effects of four-day essential newborn care training on health provider practices in hospitals in Sri Lanka. The course was adapted from the WHO Training Modules on Essential Newborn Care and Breastfeeding. Participants were provided teaching aids on newborn care and resuscitation. Training comprised lectures, demonstrations, hands-on training and small group discussions. Hospitals were randomly assigned to intervention (n = 2 hospitals) and control groups (n = 3 hospitals). The main sample for data collection by exit interview included 446 mother/newborn pairs before intervention and 446 pairs after intervention (223 each in intervention and control groups). These exit interview data were not relevant to the topic of this review. Direct observations of delivery practices were made on a subsample consisting of 96 healthcare providers (48 before and 48 after the intervention).

El-Arifeen 2004, a cluster-randomised trial on the effects of IMCI training on quality of care, was excluded, as data on referral rate (appropriate health worker response to an encounter with a seriously ill child and our outcome of interest) were not reported for seriously ill children. Gouws 2004, a clusterrandomised trial on the effects of IMCI training on health worker antibiotic use, was excluded, as no baseline assessment of outcomes was performed. Nadel 2000, an intervention study of periodic mock resuscitations combined with an eight-hour resuscitation course, was excluded, as it lacked a concurrent comparison group/ used a historical control group.

Training also reduced the frequency of inappropriate/harmful resuscitation practices (trained 0.53 vs control 0.92; mean difference (MD) 0.40, 95% CI 0.13 to 0.66; Appendix 2) (moderate certainty evidence).

In Senarath 2007, assessment of breathing of the newborn at birth and four of the five components of essential newborn care practices were improved in the intervention group after training, but it was possible to re-analyse the data to compare intervention and control groups and to adjust for clustering for only one outcome: preparedness for resuscitation.

Apart from the clear effect on costs, training duration may modify their impact: One review (Rowe 2008) (n = 2 studies) found marginal effectiveness of standard IMCI training (\u2265 11 days) compared with shortened IMCI training (five to 11 days). The complexity of the targeted behaviour may also modify training effects: Practices such as holding the baby upside during resuscitation may be easier to change than complex ones such as performing bag-valve-mask resuscitation. In Opiyo 2008, the teaching strategy consisted of focused lectures and practical scenario sessions using an infant manikin, and in Senarath 2007, the strategy involved lectures, demonstrations, hands-on training and small group discussions.

First, a large number of studies were excluded on the basis of weak design (lack of appropriate controls, retrospective surveys). Most of the available evidence is therefore unreliable because of high risk of bias. Second, the lack of rigorous studies could be due to design and ethical challenges in the evaluation of educational interventions in practice settings. Desirable features such as protec-tion against contamination cannot be fully achieved within routine clinical settings. In addition, random assignment of health providers and sick babies to a control arm and observation of practices performed by untrained providers raise clear ethical concerns. Third, effective sample sizes will always be difficult to achieve, as severe illness episodes and resuscitation events remain relatively uncommon events in practice. Large multi-centre studies with relatively long observation periods would be needed to effectively assess the effects of emergency care courses. Apart from high costs, such studies would have to contend with the difficulty of securing continued availability and participation of health providers.",

            "text": "If it is possible that the training by itself would not have made a difference unless major interventions were provided in other areas (e.g. improved supervision/drug supply, provision of new or enhanced equipment/facility management skills or technical improvements), two authors (ON and ME) will assess and summarise the contribution of such external influences as high, moderate or low. Differences in the ratings will be resolved through discussion between review authors Reporting For ITS, we will report the change in the level of outcome immediately after introduction of the intervention and the change in the slopes of the regression lines. For the change in slope, we will present the effects of interventions as the difference between the fitted value for the first six months post intervention data point minus the predicted outcome six months after the intervention based on the preintervention slope when possible. The same measurement will be used for the change in the trend of outcomes when data points are available after one and two years If available, we will report the costs of in-service training (resource use) including direct costs (such as costs for purchasing training materials) and cost impacts (such as impact of in-service guidelines on treatment costs). If available, cost data will be presented in both physical/natural and monetary units Analysis Similarly, if needed, we will re-analyse ITSs using time series regression (if possible) by estimating the best fit before the intervention and after the intervention lines using linear regression. Sensitivity analyses will be used to assess the effects of incorporating these corrected analyses into the analysis Primary analyses We will conduct meta-analysis using a random-effects model for direct comparisons, if a pooled estimate makes practical sense and data are available or can be obtained. For example, we will consider calculating an overall effect for paediatric and other child health training courses if they have minimal variations (e.g. in intensity, types of participants) that are unlikely to alter the results We will assess the presence of heterogeneity by visually examining forest plots to check for overlapping confidence intervals and by calculating a test of heterogeneity (i.e. Chi 2 test using a 10% level of statistical significance, and I\u00b2 test), taking values < 25% to represent low heterogeneity, and values between 25% and 50% to represent moderate heterogeneity Exploring heterogeneity We do expect considerable heterogeneity due to differences in study designs (RCTs, CRTs, CCTs, CBAs and ITSs), diagnoses (malaria, diarrhoea, malnutrition, pneumonia, etc) and participants (nurses, doctors, etc). We will prepare tables and bubble plots to explore potential heterogeneity due to the above factors. A bubble plot graphically presents the relationship between the outcome of each study and a given modifier with the use of regression lines. We will perform, if possible, sensitivity analyses to assess the extent to which the above differences influence reported results In addition, we will explore, if sufficient data are available, the impact of potential explanatory factors such as duration of training courses, baseline performance, format of training (mixed interactive, didactic), single vs multiple topics, on-site training or supportive interventions (e.g. supervision, incentives) (Appendix 6). Ongoing studies We will describe identified ongoing studies when available, detailing the primary author, research questions(s), methods and outcome measures, together with an estimate of the reporting date ",
