Although diarrhea is undoubtedly the most common problem, diseases of the fore stomachs, abomasum, and intestines also occur. Being able to properly diagnose gastrointestinal problems is pivotal in developing proper preventive and treatment strategies.

The article is divided into differentiation of the causes of abdominal distension, and the causes of diarrhea. Only the gastrointestinal causes of abdominal distension are discussed, with the focus placed on antemortem diagnosis. The reader is referred to other publications for treatment and prevention.",

Especially important is the feeding history, because diet is a major contributor to forestomach diseases. The number and age of calves affected is also important. A general physical examination, including body condition, hair coat condition, and evaluation of the cardiovascular and respiratory systems, combined with a good history, helps differentiate chronic from acute problems. A more thorough examination of the gastrointestinal system is then necessary. As with adult cattle, abdominal contour is important. Abdominal distension can be divided into left-sided, right-sided, and bilateral distension. This method of classification allows the clinician to narrow the list of differential diagnoses and appropriately focus diagnostic techniques. Abdominal palpation, auscultation, percussion, and succusion are needed to differentiate fluid versus gas distension. The consistency and presence or absence of the feces is also important. Rectal palpation is not possible in calves, which makes formulating a diagnosis more challenging.",

Because a ping may be detected on auscultation and percussion with both conditions, fluid centesis of the organ in question may be necessary. Abomasal contents smell acidic, have an acidic pH, and have a chloride content of > 90 mEq / L as opposed to rumen contents, which normally have a more neutral pH and a chloride content of < 25 mEq/L.25 Calves with chronic rumen acidosis or rumen putrefaction, however, also may have acidic rumen contents (see later discussion), and rumen chloride can be high in milk-fed calves, which can confuse the diagnosis. 22 ,31 Distinguishing the rumen from the abomasum with ultrasonography is also difficult if either organ is gas distended. Passage of a stomach tube to relieve gas distension can be suggestive of rumen distension. Rolling the calf from its right side over its back to its left side is diagnostic of an LDA if the ping disappears.

The color and consistency of the feces and gross lesions can look similar no matter the cause,33 thus laboratory identification of infectious agents and histology are key to establishing a diagnosis. Because autolysis and secondary bacterial invasion of the gut begin minutes after death, necropsy samples taken immediately from euthanized calves are best. 53 It is important to remember that mixed infections with two or more pathogens are more common than infections with single pathogens and that the pathogens that are a problem on a farm change from year to year. 33 In some cases, an underlying nutritional problem is combined with an infectious agent.

The most important fimbria in calves is K99. 71 The K99 fimbrial antigen can be recognized in the laboratory and is important in diagnosing this disease as a cause of diarrhea in calves. Because there are many nonpathogenic E. coli that are normal gut inhabitants, simply culturing this organism from the gut is usually insignificant. Serotyping for the K99 fimbrial antigen is also needed to make a diagnosis of ETEC. Once the organism is attached to the villi, the second virulence factor, enterotoxin, is produced. It is the enterotoxin that actually interferes with the normal physiology of the gut, which leads to diarrhea. 3 As a result of age-related resistance most likely related to blocking of fimbrial attachment to the gut, ETEC occurs mainly in calves less than 1 week old (Fig. 7) .65, 77 Because ETEC causes a secretory diarrhea, bicarbonate loss in the diarrhea leads to severe acidosis, and calves quickly become dehydrated and recumbent. 3,71 This leads to high mortality rates if calves are not treated promptly. Diagnosis is based on fecal culture and serotyping for the K99 fimbrial antigen. 77 Occasionally the bacteria do not express the fimbrial antigens in the culture, and thus ETEC cannot be ruled out if the culture is K99 negative. 67 Histologic evidence of colonization can support a diagnosis. 3 , 77 ",

            "text": "Rotavirus and coronavirus produce similar lesions. Both infect villus tip cells. 38 Rotavirus appears to be a more widespread problem, but coronavirus leads to more severe diarrhea for two reasons. First, coronavirus destroys a greater portion of each villus tip than does rotavirus. Second, whereas rotavirus only infects the proximal half of the small intestine, coronavirus infects the same portions of the small intestine and the large intestine. 8 , 38, 67 The result of either infection is villus atrophy and malabsorptive diarrhea. 6 , 15, 44 Rotavirus typically affects calves 5 to 14 days of age, and coronavirus usually occurs in calves 5 to 30 days of age. 38 ,44 Both can occur in the first few days of life, and rota virus has been reported in calves up to 2 to 3 months of age. 14 , 73 The upper age limit of coronavirus is unclear and may not exist considering the association of this organism with winter dysentery in adult cattle. 68 These two organisms can be differentiated by electron microscopy of fecal or colonic samples or by immunologic techniques on feces or tissue sections. 38 Because these organisms are sloughed with the villus tip cells they infect during infection, or the viral antigens are complexed with the calf's antibody, tissue samples from acutely infected animals are best. 33 ,67 Cryptosporidiosis Cryptosporidia parvum is a protozoa that causes mal absorptive diarrhea similar to rota virus and coronavirus. It infects the villus tip cells of the distal small intestine and large intestine. Unlike other protozoal infections, like coccidiosis, Cryptosporidia do not require fecal excretion for sporulation. 51 They can sporulate in the gut and become immediately infectious to other villus tip cells without ever leaving the gUt. 51 This method of autoinfection leads to very severe disease, which can be sustained for long periods. Relapses are also common, and this organism is common in mixed infections. 51 Cryptosporidia cause diarrhea in calves 1 to 3 weeks old. 51 Acid-fast staining of air dried fecal smears is a quick and easy method of diagnosis. Examination under 40X to 100X reveal round protozoa that have taken up the red color of the carbol fuschsin portions of the stain on a green background. Although they can be diagnosed by fecal flotation, their small size (4-6 /-Lm) makes this method very difficult and subject to false-negative results. 19 ,59 Immunologic techniques and a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique have been developed to improve detection limits over flotation and acid-fast staining techniques. 59 , 75 Cryptosporidia also can be identified with histology. 51 Cryptosporidiosis is a zoonotic disease, and people can easily become infected from handling infected calves. 49 ,58 Salmonellosis Salmonella cause diarrhea in calves 7 days of age and older. There are more than 2000 serotypes of Salmonella sp and all can potentially causes diarrhea in calves. 44 Salmonella produce enterotoxins, are invasive, and cause severe inflammatory disease and necrosis of the lining of the small and large intestines. 44 Diarrhea is more likely to contain blood in salmonellosis. 57 This is also a zoonotic disease. 57 Diagnosis is based on culture of feces or tissues and histologic examination of the bowel. 36 More sensitive PCR techniques for identifying Salmonella spp. in feces are being developed. 16 ",

            "text": "Coccidiosis and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) should be considered in older calves with diarrhea. Coccidiosis causes bloody diarrhea usually in calves older than 30 days of age. In severe cases, the disease becomes protracted due to necrosis of the mucosal lining. Even if these animals are treated appropriately, the diarrhea continues until the intestinal mucosa heals, which can take several days to weeks. It can be easily diagnosed from a direct smear or flotation of feces in the acute stages. In the chronic stages, most of the organisms have been shed, and very low numbers are seen on fecal examination. Because normal cattle can also shed low numbers, interpretation of fecal examinations in the chronic stages of coccidiosis can be difficult. In these cases, other diseases such as nematode infestations and BVDV should be considered (see \"Differentiation of Gastrointestinal Diseases in Adult Cattle\" elsewhere in this issue for discussion of BVDV).",
