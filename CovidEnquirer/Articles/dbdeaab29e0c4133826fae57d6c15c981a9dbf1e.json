Rooney and Williams'^ also evaluated, retrospectively, the records of infants hospitalized for bronchiolitis at 18 months or younger; allergic manifestations and a family history of asthma were more frequent in children who eventually experienced one or more episodes of wheezing. Finally, McConnochie and Roghmann^ identified 77 patients who had bronchiolitis at 25 months or younger and compared their outcome to children without a history of bronchiolitis. When these children were evaluated approximately 7 years later, only upper respiratory allergy, bronchiolitis and passive smoking exposure were found to be independent predictors of wheezing following bronchiolitis. Consequently, it is apparent that the final conclusions on the relationship between respiratory infections in infancy and later asthma must consider a host of influences, including parental smoking, underlying airway responsiveness and gender.",

These data suggest that alterations in lung function are compatible with reduced airway conductance or a slow respiratory system time constant that precedes and predicts wheezing with respiratory infections in infants.

Furthermore, this pulmonary-structural predisposition may be enhanced by an exaggerated IgE response to viral infection,^^'^^ resulting in more inflammation and severe wheezing with hospitalization. Since the majority of infants who develop wheezing with LRIs do not wheeze throughout life,^^ it is likely that pulmonary function abnormalities that favour wheezing with viral infections are modified with the growth and development of the lung.

The study population has previously been reported^\"^ and consists of newborns enrolled between 1980 and 1984 with follow-up information at 3 and 6 years of age. Key assessments in infancy included cord-serum I g E levels, pulmonary function testing before any lower respiratory tract illness had occurred, measurement of serum I g E at 9 months of age, and a questionnaire completed by the children's parents when the child was 1 year old. The children were classified into four groups: no wheezing, transient wheezing, late-onset wheezing or persistent wheezing (Table 30 .2, opposite). At 6 years of age, serum IgE, pulmonary function testing and allergy skin testing were repeated and these factors were assessed in relationship to their history of wheezing. At 6 years of age, 20% of the children had at least one lower respiratory illness with wheezing during the first 3 years of life, but with no wheezing at age 6 years. These children had diminished airway function before the age of 1 year and, at 6 years of age, were more likely to have mothers who smoked but not mothers with asthma and did not have evidence of atopy, i.e. elevated serum I g E or skin test reactivity. In addition, 15% had no wheezing before the age of 3 years but had wheezing at age 6 years and 13.7% had wheezing both before 3 years of age and at 6 years of age. Those with late-onset wheezing and persistent wheezing were more likely to have mothers with a history of asthma, elevated serum I g E levels and diminished lung function at 6 years of age (Tables 30.2 ",

            "text": "A number of conclusions can be drawn from this prospective longitudinal study. Most infants who wheeze early in life have a transient condition and this predilection to wheezing with respiratory infection is associated with diminished lung function; these children are not at enhanced risk for asthma or allergic disease later in life. The groups of particular interest regarding the role of respiratory infections and development of asthma are those infants with either persistent or late-onset wheezing. Children with asthma at age 6 years appear to have a predisposition to asthma, as indicated by a maternal history of asthma and elevated serum I g E levels in the first years of life. Moreover, these children have reduced lung function by 6 years of age. The role of respiratory infections in the actual development of asthma in those with a predisposition to asthma is less clear; that is, do respiratory infections have any relationship to the subsequent development of asthma? This issue remains to be fully elucidated. Insight to factors that may determine a host's response to viral infections and its subsequent effects on lung function has been gained by animal studies. Sorkness et al?^ infected neonatal rats with Sendai virus. At 7 and 13-16 weeks afer infection, the rats that had been infected had lower P02 values and increased lung resistance when compared with controls. Furthermore, the infected animals were more sensitive to aerosolized methacholine. Lung histology in the infected animals revealed increased numbers of bronchiolar mast cells and eosinophils. In subsequent studies, these investigators have found some rat strains, i.e. Brown Norway, are more susceptible to the effects of the virus and more likely to have persistently altered lung function. Such studies in an animal model are compatible with the observations by Martinez et al?^ and indicate that many factors determine the eventual influence of respiratory infections on airway function, i.e. wheezing and bronchial hyperresponsiveness, including a predisposition to produce IgE antibodies. However, what needs to be clarified are the mechanisms by which respiratory viruses interact with IgE-dependent factors and promote an asthma-like picture.",

For children less than 2 years of age, coexisting allergic diseases were not a risk factor. Rather, passive exposure to cigarette smoke, as indicated by urinary cotinine values ^1 0 jUg/ml, was a risk factor for wheezing. The profile in children over 2 years of age with wheezing and viral URIs was quite different. In these children, the presence of allergy, i.e. positive radioallergosorbant test (RAST) values, and not passive cigarette smoke exposure, was the dominant risk factor for wheezing with viral respiratory infections. Observations by Duff et al}^ confirm previous information that RSV is the major viral infection causing wheezing in infants, whereas rhinovirus is the causative respiratory infection associated with wheezing in older children. Moreover, wheezing in infants is not increased by the presence of allergic disease but rather made more probable if cigarette smoke exposure is present. In the older child, allergies are a major risk factor for wheezing with rhinovirus; these data also imply that a unique relationship may exist between rhinovirus and allergy, and this interaction may influence the development of wheezing with this particular respiratory virus. The detection of respiratory viruses, particularly rhinovirus, by culture is difficult because of the fastidiousness of viruses in culture. Consequently, determination of the association between rhinovirus infections and provocation of asthma using virus culture may give an underestimation of the true frequency between colds and asthma. Johnston ef al}^ developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to detect picornavirus infections. This approach has an increased sensitivity and thus greater likelihood to detect causative viruses in relationship to clinical symptoms of a cold and eventual influence on asthma.",

First, there was a seasonal pattern to the appearance of respiratory symptoms and changes in peak flow values of the asthma patients; the months of N o v e m b e r -December and April appeared to be the most frequent times for colds and asthma exacerbations. Second, respiratory viruses were detected in approximately 80% of episodes with respiratory tract symptoms or falls in the peak flow (Table 30 .5). Third, rhinovirus was the most frequently detected microorganism and constituted over 60% of the viruses detected (Table 30, 6) . Fourth, the severity of asthma symptoms in many of these subjects was severe. From these observations, and those of others, it is apparent that rhinovirus, the cause of the common cold, is the respiratory infection most likely to exacerbate wheezing in individuals with existing asthma. It is possible that this relationship simply reflects the fact that rhinovirus is the most common cause of infectious respiratory symptoms, i.e. the common cold. However, this association may also mean In contrast to observations in children, the relationship between respiratory infections and episodes of wheezing is not as striking in adults. When both children and adults were evaluated, respiratory viruses were more frequently identified during episodes of asthma in children under 10 years of age compared with adults. Eight adult subjects evaluated by Minor et alP had only three documented virus infections with increased wheezing. Although an explanation for such findings is not clear, it is likely that asthma flares were more diflficult to sharply delineate and the pattern of wheezing often appeared chronic rather than episodic in adults. Similarly, when Hudgel and coworkers^^ evaluated 19 adult asthma patients over a 15-month period, 76 episodes of asthma were recorded but only eight could be documented with a viral URL Although clinically apparent viral respiratory infections precipitate asthma in adults, the relative frequency appears less than in children.

Histamine is released into the airway immediately following antigen challenge and represents mast cell activation. We found histamine release into the airway immediately following local antigen challenge to be significantly potentiated by rhinovirus infection (Table 30 .8).

In determining the effect of rhinovirus on the immune response, it has been established that the receptor for the majority (90%) of rhinovirus strains is intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-!.\"^^ The other 10% of rhinovirus strains use the low-density lipoprotein receptor.^^ Interaction of rhinovirus with these receptors is the first step in the host's response to this virus. With this information, we have found that a major rhinovirus, rhinovirus 16, binds to mononuclear cells via the ICAM-1 receptor, with binding occurring predominantly to monocytes but not lymphocytes. When rhinovirus 16 was incubated with a mixture of monocytes and lymphocytes, the following events occurred: there was a large increase in the number of CD3 \"^ cells that express the early activation marker CD69; when the CD3 \"^ /CD69 \"^ cells were isolated and analysed, they were found to have increased expression of mRNA for IFN-y. These in vitro observations suggest that rhinovirus activates monocytes to generate cytokines that stimulate lymphocytes. Once activated, these lymphocytes (CDS \"^/CD69 \"^) generate a variety of cytokines, including IFN-y. Although IFN-y is normally important in antiviral activity, it also possesses a number of pro-inflammatory functions, including increased expression of endothelial and epithelial ICAM-1 (more receptors for rhinovirus) and the promotion of eosinophil survival. Therefore, in addition to activation of a small number of rhinovirus-specific lymphocytes, rhinovirus can cause a 'non-specific' activation of lymphocytes through the generation of cytokines from monocytes; these cytokines can, in turn, promote either viral elimination or inflammation.
