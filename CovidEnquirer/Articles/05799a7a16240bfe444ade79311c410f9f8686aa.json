            "text": "Background: human rhinovirus (HRV) is a major cause of influenza-like illness (ILI) in adults and children. Differences in disease severity by HRV species have been described among hospitalized patients with underlying illness. Less is known about the clinical and virologic characteristics of HRV infection among otherwise healthy populations, particularly adults. Objectives: to characterize molecular epidemiology of HRV and association between HRV species and clinical presentation and viral shedding. Study design: observational, prospective, facility-based study of ILI was conducted from February 2010 to April 2012. Collection of nasopharyngeal specimens, patient symptoms, and clinical information occurred on days 0, 3, 7, and 28. Patients recorded symptom severity daily for the first 7 days of illness in a symptom diary. HRV was identified by RT-PCR and genotyped for species determination. Cases who were co-infected with other viral respiratory pathogens were excluded from the analysis. We evaluated the associations between HRV species, clinical severity, and patterns of viral shedding. Results: eighty-four HRV cases were identified and their isolates genotyped. Of these, 62 (74%) were >18 years. Fifty-four were HRV-A, 11HRV-B, and 19HRV-C. HRV-C infection was more common among children than adults (59% vs. 10%, P < 0.001). Among adults, HRV-A was associated with higher severity of upper respiratory symptoms compared to HRV-B (P = 0.02), but no such association was found in children. In addition, adults shed HRV-A significantly longer than HRV-C (P trend = 0.01). Conclusions: among otherwise healthy adults with HRV infection, we observed species-specific differences in respiratory symptom severity and duration of viral shedding.",

            "text": "Human rhinovirus (HRV)-the most prevalent respiratory virus-causes up to half of common colds [1, 2] and imposes a significant economic burden [3] . HRV has also been associated with bronchiolitis [4] , pneumonia [5] , and exacerbation of breathing difficulties in populations with underlying respiratory conditions, including asthma, cystic fibrosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [6] [7] [8] . Prior to the era of molecular testing, rhinovirus was considered to be a relatively mild pathogen of questionable importance. However, with the ability to more readily identify HRV infection and species-including the newly identified species (HRV-C)-evidence is emerging that severity of HRV may be dependent upon the species and/or serotype. The three species of HRV (A-C) comprise a large group of genetically diverse viruses with more than 150 serotypes [9, 10] . HRV-A and C are associated with more severe clinical manifestations in children [11] [12] [13] and adults [14] . In particular, HRV-C is associated with more severe illness in young children, particularly those with asthma [12, 15, 16] or cystic fibrosis [17] . However, less is known about the epidemiology and clinical characteristics of HRV infection in otherwise healthy populations, especially adults without underlying illness. Moreover, little is known about the persistence of HRV shedding, which may influence duration of symptoms, clinical course, and infectiousness.",

We performed Kruskal-Wallis tests to examine species-specific differences in individual symptom score and composite scores.

However, information on the frequency of HRV-C detection in adults with respiratory illness is less consistent, ranging from 4.8% to 30% [7, 14, [23] [24] [25] , regardless of patients' comorbid status. It is unclear why such variation existed in adult population. While our data, along with others', suggest age differences in the prevalence of HRV species, there are as yet no data explaining reasons of these differences.

The findings were in accordance with the literature-HRV-A and/or HRV-C are associated with more severe manifestations, including severe upper respiratory illness and pneumonia [14, 29] . While symptoms related to HRV infection are generally mild among patients without underlying health conditions, such species-specific variation implies differences in viral pathogenesis and/or host immunity. We were unable to confirm such differences using clinical data collected at enrollment. Differences in the timing of presentation and/or enrollment may have contributed to the result.

This finding adds context to the literature regarding HRV-C in children, suggesting that the observed higher severity of some HRV infections may be confined to specific risk groups. Persistent viral shedding may indicate different levels of virulence, host immune response and infectiousness [32, 33] . In sharp contradistinction to influenza infection where children shed virus longer than adults [34] [35] [36] , our data suggest that adults shed HRV longer than children. In addition, we observed adults to shed HRV-A longer than HRV-C. Longer shedding of HRV-A among adults may be correlated to more severe clinical presentation with such species. Further studies are needed to understand interaction of host response and viral virulence.

Our study has several limitations. First, the small sample size, especially among children (n = 23), may have precluded us from identifying an association between HRV species and clinical outcomes. Second, the study population was comprised of individuals who presented to healthcare facilities with ILI. This may not reflect the epidemiology of HRV infection among individuals in the community who do not seek medical care. In addition, the majority of HRV cases in this study were from a single site. This may limit the generalizability of our results to different geographical regions. On the other hand, our study population also had a relatively small proportion of hospitalized patients and may not be fully representative of severe cases of HRV infection. Third, symptom diaries were not completed by all patients. It is possible that some participants suspended use of their diaries when their symptoms subsided. To address this, we performed a sensitivity analysis using data only from participants who completed the diary per protocol (n = 42). The analysis confirmed the results that adult patients with HRV-A had higher composite severity scores than those with HRV-B (data not shown). Finally, shedding of virus was measured by detection of RNA, not using cell culture. The fastidious nature of HRV has led to the use of PCR as the main tool for detection, so we feel this is acceptable, though it is only inferential of infectious particles. In addition, the duration of shedding was measured by consecutive detection of HRV in nasal swabs while genotyping was performed for only the baseline specimen. It is possible that the HRV detected at subsequent visits could have been new infections.",

            "text": "Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses. The VP4/VP2 coding region of all HRV positive samples obtained were sequenced and included in the following phylogenetic analyses. This region was selected for sequencing because VP4/VP2 is the most commonly studied region of HRV. For direct sequencing of viral nucleic acids from clinical specimens, gene fragments were amplified and sequenced with the use of a Big Dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (version 3.1, Applied Biosystems) and internal primers Generic F HRV (AGC-CTGCGTGGCKGCC) and NCR2HRV (ACTACTTTGGGTGTCCGTGTTTC) on a Genetic Analyzer system (version 3130xL, Applied Biosystems). Nucleotide sequences of PCR products (n = 441 nt) were analyzed by sequencing using Sequencher and BioEdit (version 7.0.0, Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) software and then aligned with the CLUSTAL X version 2.0.1 software to compare with HRV sequences from the GenBank database. Phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbor-joining method in MEGA software (version 5). The statistical significance of the tree topology was tested by bootstrapping (1000 replicas). Pairwise distances between and within the genotypes at the nucleotide level were calculated with Kimura 2 parameters and with Poisson correction at the amino acid level with MEGA software. Nucleotide sequences from our study samples are available at GenBank (accession number: KF957884-KF957967 and KF957971).",

Prototype strains of HRV-A-C from GenBank were included for comparison (Clustal X version 2.0.1). The tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining method in MEGA software (version 5). The statistical significance of the tree topology was tested by bootstrapping (1000 replicas). Pairwise distances between and within the genotypes at the nucleotide level were calculated with Kimura 2 parameters and with Poisson correction at the amino acid level with MEGA software.
