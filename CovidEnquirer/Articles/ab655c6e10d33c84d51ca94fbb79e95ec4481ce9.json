How can we understand the reactions to SARS of some of the main actors and institutions? What aspects were they preoccupied with and did their definition of what SARS was all about change during the process? A selection of jurisdictions is chosen -China, the Hong Kong SAR, Canada and the World Health Organization -to explore these questions. The starting point is a view that the reactions cannot primarily be seen as an instrumental, based on rational, standard-operating-procedures (SOPs) and technical expertise, but may be better understood by a garbage can-perspective. From a review of the events as publicly reported, we find, as suggested by garbage can theory, that politicians' and administrators' responses to the SARS outbreak were a combination of competing rationalities and overlapping agendas. Critical decisions were triggered by extraneous factors and administrative actions were shaped by dramatic switches from one set of standard operating procedures to another, as events unfolded. The public health issues constantly vied with other agendas and only when compelling alignments among them occurred did professional or technical rationales for \"solving the problem\" become dominant.",

The first case of a new kind of atypical pneumonia with no known cause was reported in Guangdong Province in southern China in November 2002. By early February, the Hong Kong media was reporting a mysterious virus sweeping through Guangdong, but the Chinese authorities issued denials and imposed a media blackout. In late February, cases appeared in Hong Kong and Hanoi, and the World Health Organization's (WHO's) first travel advisory was issued on March 15. Cases by now were being reported in Canada and Singapore. The epidemic peaked in April, during which month international agencies and governments all over the worldincluding China, which in mid-April \"came clean\" about the extent of the problem -adopted increasingly drastic measures to combat its spread. Cases were reported from 30 countries on six continents. By July the epidemic was said to be under control, indicated by a lifting of all the WHO travel advisories. According to statistics from WHO, during the period of November 1 st 2002 to July 1 st 2003, 8445 people were infected by SARS, the disease killing all together 812 people, of whom 348 were in mainland China, 298 in Hong Kong SAR, 84 in Taiwan, 38 in Canada and 32 in Singapore (WHO 2003a) .",

One explanation could be a more general feeling of insecurity in the world after September 11. Another explanation, connected to the first one, was the handling of SARS from the main actors involved, primarily WHO and some of the countries affected. Early on it was indicated that there was probably no cure for the disease, leading many people to think that SARS was fatal in most cases. In fact, there were different reactions and symptoms of varying severity between different infected patients; there were successful treatments; and death rates were not dramatically high compared with some other diseases. Vivid accounts in the media of how the disease was spread -via hotel lift buttons, through being coughed on by a \"super-spreader\" and so on -also added to the sense of fear. Was this \"the big one,\" the \"mystery virus\" that defied all efforts of modern science, sweeping the world with devastating consequences? The plague panic epidemic was as virulent, if not more so, than the disease itself. Travel and travellers were particularly affected, as the speed at which index patients cropped up in different parts of the world highlighted the significance of this mode of transmission. Countries began to screen or even prohibit visitors from affected areas; airlines cancelled flights and laid off thousands of workers; hotels in East Asia emptied.",

Allisons's (1971) analysis of the Cuban missile crisis using three decision-making models -rational actor, organizational processes and governmental (bureaucratic) politics -drew on three seminal traditions in organizational theory and policy making studies. The same traditions inform our starting point. Allison's contribution effectively demolished the unitary rational actor model as an adequate explanatory framework on its own. However, the insights of organizational theory on \"bounded rationality\" (Simon 1957) were deployed by Allison to illuminate important dimensions of the decision making process. We go further, by contending that a \"garbage can\" approach (March and Olsen 1976) can assist in showing how complex crises are handled from an organizational process perspective. Such an approach, we argue, also illuminates the nature of bureaucratic politics.",

On the control side, political and administrative leaders are supposed to exercise control at the top, either by participating themselves in closed processes, or by tightly controlling other principal participants in the decision making processes. Rational calculation means that actors must score high on formulating relatively unambiguous goals and means and they have good insights into the possible effects of different actions and their probability of solving problems and fulfilling goals. A tight coupling between control and rational calculation may imply that there are some very unambiguous ways of organizing like standardized rules for handling decision-making processes, often labelled Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). This implies that, when certain events happen and certain decisions and actions are taken, there is a relative lack of ambiguity about which actors get involved, what role they should play and what actions are to be taken. According to different structural positions, actors have different functions and roles to play.",

Here, Allison's governmental politics model comes into play: decision making becomes a multi-player game (Allison 1971, 162-81) . While more participants may slow things down and make decisions more loose and ambiguous, this can at the same time increase the legitimacy of the leadership and the process. For example, the leadership needs the expertise of internal and external participants, particularly if it is a technically advanced policy area. These participants -particularly if their right to contribute rests on expertise that is stored in public agencies with formal jurisdictions -will want discretion and leeway for enacting their functions, something that may potentially undermine the control of the leadership and drive it to bargain and negotiate.",

It is founded on some basic premises: first, participants in public decision-making processes have attention and capacity problems, so their participation is parttime and unpredictable. Thus, their real attention is not only based on rational calculation. Second, each and every decision situation is characterized by ambiguous stimuli, meaning that the decisions could have several different aspects, whether they are closely connected to the formal decision agenda or not. Political and social factors that have more or less ambiguous relations to the issue in hand can come into play. There could also be disagreement about how history should be interpreted, elements of \"superstitious learning\" and disagreement about what the decisions and the decision contexts are all about. Thus, decisions are \"garbage cans\" in the sense that participants can throw a lot of premises for diverse actions into them, making problem definition, solution search and choice more unpredictable.",

Solutions can come first, waiting for problems to be connected with, not only problems worked on to find solutions. Participants can be characterized by local rationality, as in Allison's organization process model, but their actions may be poorly coordinated and the collective result of separate actions relatively irrational. And the manipulation of symbols, because instrumental action is made difficult, may characterize decision-making processes. This last point has been highlighted as a common feature of many supposedly ration-comprehensive reform processes in the public sector, where hypocrisy frequently characterize leaders' behaviour in the absence of clarity over reform consequences (Christensen and Laegreid 2001) .",

Complex technical debates about such things as the adequacy of methods of diagnosis and labelling, or the accuracy of published death rates, dismayed those looking for authoritative reassurance from the experts. Responses and remedies recommended by them were disconcertingly diverse and multidimensional. There was on the one hand a search for sophisticated scientific knowledge about the virus with a view to finding a chemical cure and, on the other, exhortations to the general community to wipe their feet and wash their hands. Given a natural urge on the part of medical staff to self-preservation, this lack of certainty exhibited itself in some cases as a particular kind of \"techno-panic,\" in which the uncertainty about causes, prevention and cure, coupled with an acute awareness of the possible worst case consequences, led to ultracautious and failsafe recommendations.

As to the first, the intense interest of the international media created a news storm that no jurisdiction -not even China -could escape. Where there were obstacles to news-gathering and reporting, the internet and text-messaging were vital \"unofficial\" methods of access to and dissemination of information about the disease. As to the second circumstance, the role of the WHO meant that no nation state could act in isolation, although each could adopt varying degrees of the same kind of response (for example, more or less harsh quarantine and surveillance measures). The fact that the mere labelling or un-labelling of a country or region by the WHO could have such dire economic and social consequences gave that body and those upon whom it depended for support and advice extraordinary global power. In response, the pressures for cross-border cooperation of a defensive kind to protect state capacities were intense, resulting in involvement at the highest level by political leaders through multi-lateral organisations such as ASEAN.

But the information was not immediately made public, and standard measures were applied to ensure that public officials did not break ranks and the media did not report the outbreak. In the face of leaks and outside pressures, on February 11, Guangdong health officials held a press conference admitting 305 cases of \"atypical pneumonia\" and five deaths. On March 10, China approached the WHO for assistance in investigating the outbreak, but later in the month a WHO delegation was barred from Guangdong province, raising increasing suspicions. By now, the disease had begun to take hold in Hong Kong, whose officials put increasing pressure on the Guangdong officials and on Beijing to cooperate with the release of information. Under this combined pressure, including increasing criticism in the international media, on March 26 the admitted tally of patients was increased from 305 to 792, with 31 deaths in Guangdong and 3 in Beijing since late February. To save face, statements were made identifying Hong Kong as the source of the Beijing outbreak. However, in a sign that the strategy was still one of public denial, a State Council Meeting on 2 April stated that SARS had \"already been brought under control.\"",

            "text": "But this strategy of denial was not just a matter of a habit of bureaucratic secrecy. Crucial for understanding why the authorities were so reluctant to admit the increasingly obvious, and to take tougher measures to combat the epidemic, is the political climate of the times. The period from November 2002 to March 2003 coincided with a leadership transition, with Jiang Zemin and Zhu Rongji stepping down and Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao taking their places as General Secretary and Premier respectively. Apart from the distraction that this transition process created at critical moments, the predispositions of both the leadership and the rest of public officialdom at such a time were to avoid any trouble and maintain calm and stability (Fewsmith 2003, 1) . The stage management of the 16 th Party Congress in November 2002 and of the National People's Congress in March 2003 required displays of public efficiency all round so as not to sully the old leadership's last days in office, while the transition period itself was marked by more than usual caution on the part of the new guard as they settled into their new roles. The potential for the epidemic both to reveal bureaucratic and party failures and to spread alarm and social unrest were it confronted head on was clearly a particularly unsettling one at this time. Tight, hierarchical control of communication flows creates many potential dysfunctions. One such arises because separate hierarchies have their own channels, but may not communicate with each other. This was evident in China in a number of ways. First, the local and provincial health authorities did not communicate effectively with the national level, and vice versa. Channels of expert communication on health matters were overlaid by the hierarchy of political command and reporting, such that the health experts at the centre could not get a clear picture of the spread of the disease from their provincial level counterparts, as provincial political bosses or ministry chiefs got in the way of effective and speedy aggregation of the facts. This severely inhibited the tracking of the course of the disease and also the implementation of coordinated plans to combat it. The official diagnosis of the failure to respond, as presented by Vice-Minster of Health Gao Qung, stressed this point: the Health Ministry \"did not give clear-cut instructions or offer effective guidance; due to the lack of a sound system of information collection, survival reports and contact tracing, there appears to be a major weakness in the compilation of statistics\" (Knight Ridder Newspapers 2003; Gao 2003) . Secondly, communication about the nature of the disease and the manner of treating it between localities, provinces and even between different hospitals in Beijing was also inhibited by these overlapping but tightly managed vertical communication channels. The reluctance of the military to cooperate with the health authorities in Beijing in the release of accurate information during April was such a case, even after the Government began to take serious measures. SARS statistics were not just state secrets but some of them were also military secrets, and the so-called \"official statistics\" for some time excluded cases in military hospitals. But here as well, the political situation indicates that not just SOPs but also the intrusion of other agendas were shaping the decision making process. There was possibly an increased reluctance on the part of the respective authorities to cooperate at this time because of the mutual suspicion between arms of the party-state arising from the uncertainties of the leadership transition. Jiang Zemin remained head of the party and state Central Military Commissions after the handover, and his continued presence as a key leadership figure was also evident in the number of his supporters appointed to the Politburo. Jiang was one of the last among the leadership to join the chorus of self-criticism entailed by the u-turn, and military leaders remained silent.",

The lack of openness became increasingly difficult to sustain not only in the face of growing international hostility and loss of business confidence, but also because rumour and panic were spreading among the local population, aided by new forms of communication such as text-messaging and the internet. On April 9, shortly after official figures were released claiming only four deaths and 19 cases in Beijing, a retired chief surgeon of a Beijing military hospital \"blew the whistle\" and, in an interview with foreign journalists, claimed he had personally seen over 60 cases in the one hospital. Others began to speak out: the Director of Guangdong Province's leading Respiratory Disease Research Institute challenged the official position that the disease was under control (Lefkow 2003) . The WHO team in Beijing publicly criticised the health authorities for concealing data. The combined pressure made continued cover up or denial increasingly difficult. In what appears to be a strategic political decision, the new leadership decided to make a fresh start. On April 17 a special Politburo meeting called for complete openness and disclosure by all public officials, and set up a new task force. On 20 April, the health minister and mayor of Beijing were stripped of their party posts. The unusually tough discipline meted out to the two scapegoats might be explained by the wish to assert the new leaders' authority (significantly, while one was a Jiang Zemin supporter, the other was close to the new leadership and was hence, perhaps, a symbolically even-handed sacrificial victim). Along with the dramatic u-turn in policy, these dismissals also symbolised to the outside world that a clean break was being made with the past in the direction of more transparency and greater international cooperation. Subsequently, many local officials were dismissed or punished for various \"errors\" committed during the SARS outbreak.",

These were all rolled out after the decision to act was taken. The newly appointed Minister for Health and Mayor of Beijing were, in Chinese Party circles, \"heavy hitters\" (Fewsmith 2003, 4) and both took the lead with decisive action. The government announced very strict quarantine provisions; it cancelled the May holidays to limit the movement of people; 1 entertainment venues, schools and universities were shut; road blocks were set up to prevent people leaving Beijing; and a new quarantine hospital of 1000 beds sprang up almost overnight. From a situation where inaccurate figures were released only reluctantly, the government began to issue daily updates. It shifted from a policy of token cooperation with WHO teams to one of eager collaboration. Political leaders and the media spoke with a united voice in support of a mass campaign by the people to eradicate the danger, and lauded health workers as national heroes (other than those that were symbolically singled out for punishment). This strategy had clear political dimensions: domestically, it aligned the new leadership closely with a more open, responsive and peoplefriendly style as a way of providing it with its own distinct political identity (Xiong 2003); and it sent strong signals to the international community that China was \"getting serious\" (People's Daily 2003; Gao 2003 ).",

Doubts and suspicions by the WHO and international media that the true situation was still being covered up continued to be expressed. Reports emerged that the decisions of mid-April to move to a more open stance were qualified by special instructions in the case of Shanghai (Xu 2003; Beech 2003) . This also reflected Shanghai's economic importance, and the political standing its leaders enjoyed (Jiang Zemin was Shanghaibased). The Shanghai political leadership was especially sensitive about the impact of SARS on the local economy, given Shanghai's international economic connections, and was unhappy about the potential for the new set of measures applied in Beijing to disturb their own control over managing the delicate balance between claiming (on the one hand) that the situation was in hand and (on the other hand) appearing to conceal the truth. From the national leadership's perspective, restoring confidence of the business traveller and investor in the safety of \"doing business in China\" became a top priority, prompting its sudden switch to acting the model international citizen. But further signs that the April u-turn was a matter of compromise and political strategy rather than the dawn of a new kind of political rationality (that is, not \"China's Chernobyl,\" as some proclaimed) came in the following month, with a series of arrests and prosecutions against a number of people accused of \"disturbing social order\" for spreading news of the epidemic on the internet (Hoenig 2003) .",

But there was one important similarity: a leadership concerned about legitimacy problems. Accusations of indecisiveness and weak leadership accompanied the crisis as it unfolded in Hong Kong, and they were not without justification. The first SARS case -a visitor from Guangdong -was admitted to hospital in late February, and died on 4 March. That patient was the source of infection for others who also spread the disease to Singapore and Toronto, among other places. This only became apparent over the ensuing month, but as it did so it became a source of acute embarrassment for Hong Kong (in particular due to the unfortunate choice of the SARS label by the WHO). The spread of the infection within the SAR from this original case occurred in large part via health workers, raising the question about the state of preparedness and organization of the health system for dealing with such an outbreak. The first Hong Kong victim, a visiting Guangdong doctor, warned hospital officials upon checking in that he was suffering from a highly infectious disease that he had been treating in Guangdong. Some of his medical colleagues phoned the hospital with advice about treatment and precautionary measures (Moy and Phillips 2003) . As a consequence, he was strictly isolated and effective measures were taken to limit infection in that hospital. The spread of the infection through health workers stemmed primarily from another hospital, where a patient who had been in contact with the first victim was admitted (Staff Reporter et al. 2003) . Necessary protocols and safeguards against infection were not applied, leading to an outbreak among medical staff. Following this outbreak, the Hospital Authority notified the Department of Health of the situation on 10 March. Public information was released and WHO was notified on 12 March; WHO issued a global alert on atypical pneumonia (the label preferred by the SAR authorities) on 15 March.",

Suspected cases were not promptly separated from other patients; some patients who had been in contact with such cases in wards were shifted to other hospitals; one victim was the subject of visits from groups of medical students, many of whom were subsequently infected; some treatment methods employed had the effect of spreading infectious material through the ward; those in contact with patients did not all take the necessary precautions or have available to them the correct protective clothing; and so on. As cases emerged among private general medical practitioners who had treated suspected victims in their local surgeries, they began to voice complaints about lack of information and support from the health authorities. A subsequent report by an expert panel commissioned by the Hong Kong Government confirmed some of these problems: \u2026the response during the initial period of the outbreak was inadequate due to inadequate contingency planning and a number of system inadequacies \u2026 weaknesses in hospital infection control structures, inadequacies in staff training\u2026, deficiencies in the hospital environment, scarcity of equipment, no pre-determined outbreak control plan or communication strategy, and a lack of clarity about the respective roles and responsibilities of the Hospital Authority, Department of Health, and the university (SARS Expert Committee 2003, 15) Meanwhile, the political leadership called mostly for calm and warned against over-dramatization in the media. But the seeming lack of preparedness and coordination was apparent more widely. A major new cluster of cases emerged in late March from a housing estate, Amoy Gardens. Uncertainty and speculation mounted over how and why so many cases occurred in this area, in particular as it now appeared that the disease might not only spread through direct personal contact with a seriously ill patient. As the political leadership reluctantly was forced to admit that the sources of infection and the danger had spread into the community and outside the hospital system, their response appeared to some to be indecisive and at cross-purposes. For example, at the same time as the Health Secretary was calling for calm over the threat of infection in schools, the Education Secretary was publicly speculating in the face of growing pressure from anxious parents about the possibility of shutting the school system down. During the crisis, the Tourism Authority announced a new slogan: 'Hong Kong -it takes your breath away\". In the face of growing complaints from health workers about lack of resources and slowness in providing equipment in the public hospital system, a campaign was begun in the media to collect donations to buy much needed protective equipment for hospital staff.",

Its difficulties were political, and stemmed from the uneasy relationship with Beijing. Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa was Beijing's choice for the position, and continued to have Beijing's support. 2 His position as the crisis unfolded in March and early April was made acutely difficult by Beijing's official position that SARS was not a serious problem in China. Tung held a number of well-publicised meetings with Chinese political leaders at which they offered full logistical and moral support, and from which he came away expressing gratitude. Tung even had to bear the indignity of hearing Hong Kong blamed as a source of the Beijing infections. Hong Kong SAR Secretary for Health Yeoh Engkiong was quoted on 17 March as saying \"there is still not an outbreak\" (South China Morning Post 2003a). When this was no longer tenable, he then claimed that \"the mainland should not be blamed for the outbreak\" (Staff Reporter et al. 2003) . It appeared that the Government was under Beijing's instructions. Certainly, Tung was under pressure not to cause the kind of panic that Beijing was so anxious to avoid on its side of the SAR border. But this pressure only could go so far. Hong Kong's openness and the willingness to call in the WHO at a relatively early date in turn embarrassed the Beijing leadership, which came under increasing international pressure. On April 3, the first WHO mission was let in to Guangdong, with full cooperation.",

Even as the Hong Kong epidemic unfolded in March, the lack of accurate information and official contacts was a continuing problem. As already described, a vital piece of information shared informally among medical specialists contributed significantly to the mitigation of the effects of the first hospitalised case. Had this advice been officially shared, there may have been a chance that it would have been communicated from the top down to the whole hospital system, avoiding some of the initial errors in treatment of other patients and making for better preparedness.

At the end of March, with 367 cases now confirmed, quarantine measures were ordered for all members of the community who had been in contact with a victim, and schools were closed. But the media immediately contrasted this with Singapore's much more draconian and prompter quarantine measures, and \"too little, too late\" was the common response (Pomfret 2003) . On April 2, the WHO travel advisory warning against visits to Hong Kong was announced, and this further increased pressure on the government. Earlier comments from some officials had been mildly critical of the WHO for being too alarmist. By now, the only plausible strategy was to take all-out measures to control the epidemic, regardless of the economic or social consequences. The economic effects on Hong Kong of a sudden decline in the number of international visitors were immediate and dramatic. 3 In order to hasten the end of the crisis and regain international public confidence, it now became very much a positive for the Hong Kong authorities to be completely open, fully cooperate with the WHO, take more drastic administrative measures, including health checks on the borders, and urge local residents to take all necessary precautions. Once the need for a coherent, decisive strategy was agreed on, the Hong Kong bureaucracy moved into top gear. All restraints on \"causing panic\" were dropped -for example, from April 10 the Health Department released daily information on the buildings where SARS cases had occurred, despite fears that this might cause discrimination. Schools were reopened after two and a half weeks, with strict hygiene measures enforced. But criticism continued against the inadequacy of measures taken to screen travellers at the airport and (in particular) at the land border crossing.",

She spread the virus to her closest family, who than spread it to the family doctor and to other patients at the emergency room. Several hospital staff, both inside the original hospital hit, but also at other hospitals, were quickly infected. In this latter respect the spreading had similarities with Hong Kong. What contributed to the spreading in the first wave was an elderly grandfather of a large family that was admitted on March 16 to the hospital that first experienced SARS.

These family members, belonging to a large Philippine religious group then spread SARS to others through large church events on March 28 and 29. The first outbreak peaked during mid March and early April, had 136 probable cases all together, of which 25 died, and 121 suspected cases of which one died (Health Canada 2003a).",

In mid May the alert on Toronto as an affected area was also lifted and during this period the health authorities also relaxed the control measures put in place in late March. On May 20 the second outbreak of SARS in Toronto occurred. It started with five patients in a rehabilitation hospital, who had contracted SARS through contact with a man of 96 years who had been infected in the original infected hospital in late March and early April, but was not diagnosed with SARS then (Health Canada 2003b) . In this second wave of the SARS epidemic in Toronto there were 111 probable cases, of which 16 died. Most were infected from exposure at the original community hospital during the first wave. In the second wave there were only seven suspect cases of which none resulted in death, reflecting a more narrow definition of SARS than in the first wave. The second outbreak was followed by a closure of the hospital to all new admissions except SARS patients and strict quarantine measures towards the hospital personnel, and the outbreak was in reality over by the time its existence was more widely known.",

Formal authority concerning health policy in Canada rests mainly in the provincial governments. 4 The federal government has responsibility for quarantine questions and it also deals formally with WHO. But there are no national health standards for fighting epidemics. Moreover, Ontario is among the provinces that traditionally has delegated the management of health issues to local boards of health. One implication of this is that the provinces have limited capacity to assist local boards, for example concerning epidemiological expertise, but also to communicate with all doctors and hospitals when the crisis occurred, something that resulted in contradictory advice about what to do with SARS. Overall, the local health authorities in Toronto did a relatively good job during the epidemic, even though it had resource problems, problems with adequate computer programs for tracing SARS patients, and problems of giving adequate and reliable information (Macleans 2003a). One indicator of \"relative success\" of the local health authorities was that there was no community spread of SARS in a broader sense in the first wave. Most of the spreading occurred in the most advanced hospitals that obviously had problems with internal procedures of prevention, included nurses working in multiple settings and not adequate resources for infection control (National Post 2003) . 5 An editorial in the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ 2003) sums up a lot of the questions raised and problems experienced. It asks whether the right structure, both medical and political, was in place for fighting epidemics like SARS. It questions whether the local and provincial health authorities had the training and the resources they needed and the proper surveillance and reporting system in place. Two matters posed questions about the adequacy of the systems of preparedness: first, the lack of isolation of SARS patients by the clinicians in the initial phase of the epidemic, and second the moving of SARS patients between hospitals (Macleans 2003b). The same editorial also questioned whether the relationship between the federal and provincial level is collaborative enough and whether Health Canada should be more in a leading or coaching role.",

Three days later WHO learned that cases dated as long back as November 16, 2002 and that the outbreak was coming under control. The latter information later was proved to be wrong, but it seems to have slowed down WHO's initial reactions. The GOARN system and the Global Influenza Network were alerted by two cases in Hong Kong February 19 th and 20 th . Similar cases were reported in late February from Vietnam and WHO sent a health expert team. It was still not easily understood what caused the disease, how it could be defined and how severe it was. When cases also occurred in Singapore and Toronto, the possibility that the disease could be spread rapidly through international travel was immediately raised. After a substantial number of hospital employees both in Hanoi and Hong Kong were affected, WHO on March 12 issued a low level alert on SARS. This alert recommended that patients with similar symptoms should be isolated and handled according to strict procedures of infection control (WHO 2003b) . National health authorities were also recommended to report new cases to WHO. That alert was stepped up to a second global alert on March 15, the first ever of this type, including emergency travel recommendations. The most dramatic travel recommendation, seen as a travel ban and followed by several nations, came in late March, and was aimed at China and Hong Kong. This resulted in a dramatic decrease in international air travel, particularly in Asia. Two more alerts were further issued in April and one in May, asking people to postpone all but essential travel to certain areas, seeking to prevent further international spread of SARS. As the escalating alerts from WHO were signalled, the whole surveillance system was put into gear: collaborating laboratories worked around the clock to reveal the secrets of SARS; the central organization consulted intensively with its regional offices and site workers; the regional office in Beijing was strengthened, more people were sent to Vietnam and Hong Kong and international expert teams were sent to China (New York Times 2003a). During late April the SARS outbreaks in Vietnam, Hong Kong, Singapore and Toronto seemed to peak, but some of these countries experienced small outbreaks again later.",

Of particular importance for WHO was the 56 th World Health Assembly that in late May 2003 supported WHO actions in the SARS process and supported a revision of the International Health Regulations covering surveillance of epidemic diseases to give WHO a more central role (WHA 2003) . WHO acquired increased power and resources to issue global alerts, set up an instant communication network, tap unofficial but reliable sources of information and send its own teams to countries and see to it that they were doing enough to control outbreaks (New York Times, May 28, 2003 ). An intergovernmental working group open to all member states was set up to review and recommend a draft revision of the International Health Regulations for adoption at the 58 th World Health Assembly in 2005.

But resisting the ban can also reflect a country with much more self-confidence than some of the Asian countries involved, and one probably with a more strained relationship to WHO. Therefore the process was elevated to a high political level and the ban was lifted through contacts and negotiations between WHO and the federal level in Canada. The Canadian authorities promised to install more rigorous screening and testing at the airports, something that didn't have effects that easily could be measured (New York Times 2003e).

The case is also different in that the local and federal authorities fought back from the notion that they had serious problems with SARS, something that had not happened in Hong Kong and China (once the initial denials were overcome). Fighting back obviously helped the standing of the authorities, because they had also been widely criticized and this could be a way of shifting the blame towards WHO, but the appropriateness of that strategy waned when the second wave occurred. It also showed clearly that this was a political process with give-and-take with wider political and economic implications. It also illustrates very well how an epidemic, like many other dramatic events with serious political implications, could be defined in different ways.

The public health issues constantly vied with other agendas and only when compelling alignments among them occurred did professional or technical rationales for \"solving the problem\" within a single means-end frame become dominant. There was, however, a form of convergence on a set of measures that restored public confidence and (in particular) international business confidence. The shape of these measures was crystallized largely through the parallel (but not always consistent) decisions and interventions of the WHO.",

The response in each case was identical: the public health authorities and the governments concerned seemed to vie with each other for the approval of WHO, with fully transparent, rapid and firm responses. That this was the preferred political strategy was a demonstration of the increasing penetration of the agendas of domestic policy making by protocols and standards set by the WHO, a transnational body with symbiotic links with domestic health policy experts and administrators. As a final thought, we therefore predict a more politicised future for that body, based on our observations of the significance of political considerations in the manner of responses to the initial outbreak.",

The contrast is stark between this decision in April and the earlier decision to conceal the potential danger of epidemic in February, when hundreds of millions of Chinese citizens took to the roads, trains and airways to return to their communities for the New Year holiday. 2. The Hong Kong Chief Executive is elected by a local electoral college, the composition of which is effectively controlled by Beijing. 3. At the international airport in Hong Kong the number of daily travelers fell from around 100.000 in early March to around 15.000 in mid May. 4. In the light of the limited central capacity to handle epidemics such as SARS proposals were discussed to establish a Canadian Office of Disease Control and Prevention, built on the American model. 5. The only contagion outside the hospital system in Toronto was in the closely knit ethnic-religious group, but this also originated in the hospital system. 6. From January 1998 through March 2002 WHO investigated 538 outbreaks in 132 countries (Brundtland 2003) . 7. In a virtual press briefing on April 23 representatives from the Canadian press asked critical questions about this travel advice, claiming that Canadian officials labelled them unfair, but got relatively vague answers from the WHO representative that pointed to the information gathered in general without going more specifically into criteria for the ban (WHO 2003e). 8. The Mayor of Toronto argued that WHO hadn't adequate information on the SARS situation in Toronto (Toronto 2003) .",
