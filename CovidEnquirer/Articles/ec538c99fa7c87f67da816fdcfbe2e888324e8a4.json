            "text": "The high frequency of medical harm shows that it is largely caused by mainstream clinical practices and not due merely to infrequently used interventions that most of us might hope to avoid. Of the causes summarized in Table 5 .1, just three are responsible for more than 80% of all instances of harm: prescription drugs, medical procedures (primarily surgery, but inclusive of other procedures such as diagnostic tests), and hospital-acquired infections. That is, interventions patients are most likely to receive are the ones that cause most harm. Although the full extent of harm from these practices is still emerging, all have in fact been leading causes of harm throughout the history of their use. Chapter 5 discussed the tendency over more than a decade for successive studies of biomedical harm to reveal progressively higher rates than had been reported in earlier studies (e.g., Classen et al., 2011; Kohn et al., 2000; Landrigan et al., 2010) . That pattern wherein more detailed analyses have tended to reveal ever greater levels of harm is repeated in the present chapter which considers specific causes of harm. Detailed study of specific causes not merely confirms that biomedical harm is extensive, but that some causes are individually responsible for more death and disability than even relatively recent analyses had suggested were due to all causes collectively.",

The term adverse drug event (ADE) is also used, especially in more recent literature, with the two terms sometimes being used interchangeably. It can be useful, however, to distinguish between the two, with ADE having a wider meaning that encompasses two subclasses of events: First, as mentioned, ADR refers to harm caused by prescription drugs. Second, an adverse drug interaction (ADI) is harm due to a prescribed drug having negative effects when taken simultaneously with one or more other drugs, whether prescribed or not. The distinction between ADR and ADI is warranted, considering the high proportion of patients who take multiple drugs. Even drugs that may not harm when taken individually can interact harmfully when taken simultaneously. ADIs, then, include harm from the interactive effects of multiple prescribed drugs taken by the same patient, as well as single or multiple prescribed drugs taken against a background of other drug use, both over-the-counter and recreational, whether licit or illicit. To reiterate, ADE is inclusive of both ADR and ADI.",

Wrong dosage is the most frequent cause, although harm also results from a variety of other actions, including wrong drug prescribed, wrong drug delivered (when the correct drug was prescribed), the prescribing of a drug despite the patient having a known allergy to that drug, and incorrect timing of delivery (too frequent or infrequent dosing). The root causes of such actions are also varied, and include inadequate drug knowledge by the prescribing physician, incomplete patient information, failure to adhere to prescribing recommendations, transcription errors on forms, and lapses in physician judgment. To avoid such errors, guidelines are promulgated, but with limited success. Lack of success cannot be attributed to guideline complexity, since much of the advice is prosaic, including the following requests of doctors to: take account of other drugs the patient may be taking, ask the patient about allergies before beginning the proposed drug treatment, explain potential side effects to patients, ask about side effects after treatment begins, and be aware that new symptom presentation following commencement of medication could be a side effect and not a symptom of the patient's medical condition (Aspden et al., 2007) .",

In the late 1950s and early 1960s, use of thalidomide as a treatment for morning sickness during pregnancy led to many infant deaths and to many infants being born with major deformities, including radically undeveloped limbs (Smithells and Newman, 1992) .

Physical instability, psychomotor unsteadiness (e.g., tremor), cognitive decline (e.g., mental confusion), and sleep disturbance-including both drowsiness and insomnia-are symptoms commonly associated with natural aging. However, these are also common side effects of prescribed drugs, especially when multiple drugs are taken simultaneously (Fabian, 2013) . It is evident that harm from prescribed drugs in elderly patients often goes unidentified because of confusion with the effects of aging. In a telephone survey of residents aged 65 years and older, the likelihood of having experienced harm from prescribed drugs in the previous 6 months was related to the number of prescribing physicians caring for the patient (Green et al., 2007) . The mean number of prescribing physicians was three, and the probability of experiencing medication harm increased by almost one-third for each additional physician in attendance. Similarly, in the Taiwanese study mentioned above, the provision of subsidies for medical expenses appears to have endangered patients by facilitating access to medical services that, in turn, contributed to a higher level of inappropriate drugs being prescribed.",

This is the doseresponse relationship, which describes the change in effect caused by varying levels of exposure. For example, a small dose of a particular drug may have little effect, a moderate dose may be therapeutic, and a large dose fatally toxic. The principle applies to populations as well as individuals, as for example, when the number of people harmed by environmental air pollution varies proportionately to the density of pollutants in the atmosphere. It is an irony of modern medicine that studies of medical harm suggest that biomedical healthcare itself is similarly fashioned. Broadly speaking, there appears to be a dose-response relationship between harm and level of exposure to clinical medicine (e.g., number of medical consultations, number of drugs prescribed, number of attending physicians, etc.), with harm increasing proportionately to increases in the amount of medical care received.",

In the United States, for example, the rate of death, usually from respiratory depression, attributable to prescribed opioid overdose more than doubled in the decade after 2000 (Bohnert et al., 2011; Paulozzi et al., 2012a) and currently exceeds fatal overdose from illicit use of heroin and cocaine combined (Paulozzi et al., 2012a, b) .

Change in medical culture appears to have been abetted by legal mandate in certain circumstances requiring compliance with patients' requests for pain relief. In addition, the convenience of prescribing drugs, and profit from their sale, tend to put patients' requests for pain relief ahead of other considerations, including patients' own ultimate welfare. This is especially evident when drugs such as opioids are prescribed for patients known or suspected of being addicted. Prescribing in those instances is self-evidently not effective as intervention for drug addiction, whereas more appropriate intervention (e.g., education and counseling) is time consuming.

Many countries have what are known as spontaneous reporting systems, which are usually administered by a central or regional regulatory authority, and in some countries reporting is mandatory. Reports of harm from prescribed drugs are received from medical doctors and other health professionals, including pharmacists and nurses. The main function of such systems is to provide a repository of information about the frequency, range, and severity of harm in order to gauge the safety of prescribed drugs currently being used in clinical practice. Such systems are intended to provide a more detailed, representative, and longer-term depiction of drug effects than studies conducted by pharmaceutical companies during premarketing clinical trials of new drugs and postmarketing surveillance once drugs become available for use in clinical practice.

There was some confirmation of that suspicion in the Hazell and Shakir (2006) study. The median underreporting rate for \"serious/severe\" harm was indeed found to be lower (i.e., more such events were reported) than the overall rate. However, the difference between the two rates was not great, wherein the median underreporting rate for serious harm was 85%.

Although everyone agrees that these serious events, including retained foreign objects and wrong-site surgery, should never happen, they are not necessarily any more seriously harmful to patients when they do happen than other categories of medical harm. Rather, what distinguishes never events is not that they should never happen (the invocation of the Hippocratic Oath, First, do no harm, informs us that patients should never be harmed), but that they are conspicuous. It is their visibility that has led to these events being branded by the medical profession as uniquely unacceptable harms. Objectively, it is impossible to argue that never events are more unacceptable than other forms of serious and fatal medical harm. The distinctive feature of never events is that they embarrass the professionals who are responsible for their occurrence. Other forms of medical harm, including death, that are less conspicuously avoidable, and therefore do not threaten physician accountability, are not regarded as never events by those who cause them.",

A charge of negligence for failing to remove a surgical object from a patient's body cavity, or of performing surgery on the wrong patient or the wrong body part, is easily proved on the basis of res ipsa loquitur (\"the thing itself speaks\"). This doctrine states that a breach of duty of care under some circumstances is proven without reference to any evidence other than the event itself. Certainly, never events should never happen, but the label has more to do with them being indefensible in medicolegal terms than the scale of harm caused. In other words, never events are deemed unacceptable not because of harm to patients, but because of potential reputational and material harm to physicians.",

Sponges are the most common, accounting for about one-half to two-thirds of retained objects (Gawande et al., 2003; Lincourt et al., 2007) . While some patients with a retained object may remain asymptomatic for extended periods, others present with infection, cramping, obstruction, or other complications that sometimes result in death. Retained is a curious expression in this context, because it seems to imply an active effect, even fault, on the part of the unconscious patient; as if the object came to inhabit the patient through some means other than surgeon error.",

Such biases could lead to competition between surgeons to treat low-risk patients to the neglect of high-risk patients.

HAIs have been most intensively studied in relation to hospital settings; hence, the essentially synonymous term, hospital-acquired infection is widely used, which conveniently is also represented by the acronym, HAI. However, healthcare-associated infection is the preferred term because it better reflects the reality that infection can be acquired as a consequence of medical care delivered in any setting. An equivalent term, which is declining in usage, is nosocomial infection; derived from the Greek words, nosus (disease) and komeion (to take FIGURE 6.2 Triptych showing the H\u00f4tel Dieu in Paris (circa 1500). Note. Comparatively well patients (on the right) were separated from the very ill (on the left).

(Source: http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hotel_Dieu_in_Paris_ about_1500.gif.) care of), the term refers to disease (more specifically, infection) contracted while under medical care. As a general guide, infections that become clinically evident after 48 hours of hospitalization are considered to be HAIs. Those that occur after the patient is discharged from hospital are considered healthcareassociated if the infective organism is likely to have been acquired during the hospital stay, especially if the organism is known to inhabit hospitals while being less common in the community. HAIs also include surgical site infections that occur within 30 days after the operative procedure or within 1 year of a surgical implant.",

The majority of the hospitals in the study were part of a national infections surveillance system, whereby deaths involving patients with an HAI were reviewed and the role of the infection in the death was assessed as having been causal, contributory, not related, or unknown. In cases of multiple HAIs, the assessment was made for each infection separately. By this means, of more than 150,000 deaths among patients with HAI, approximately one-third were attributed to causes unrelated or unknown. Thus, in about 100,000 patients (i.e., almost 6% of all patients with an HAI), the infection was assessed to have caused or contributed to the patient's death. As an annual figure, this number, it might be recalled, is higher than the IOM (Kohn et al., 2000) estimated upper limit for all medically caused deaths.",

In a recent European study of 20,000 patients in 66 hospitals from 23 countries, 7.1% were found to have an HAI (Zarb et al., 2012) , which means that about 1-in-14 patients were infected compared to the most recent estimate for the United States of 1-in-25. An older, World Health Organization(WHO)-sponsored study conducted in the late 1980s in 14 countries from four regions (Europe, Mediterranean, South-East Asia, and the Western Pacific) found that approximately 1-in-10 patients was infected while in hospital (Tikhomirov, 1987) . It is a consistent finding that rates are higher for poorer than for richer countries. A meta-analysis of more than 200 studies of HAI in developing countries reported a pooled prevalence of 15.5% (Allegranzi et al., 2011) , more than twice the rate for Europe and almost four times that reported for the United States. That is, Figure 6 .3 suggests that an average of approximately 1-in-6 inpatients in developing countries acquire an infection as a result of being hospitalized. Table 6 .2 summarizes results for different medical specialties, where it can be seen that the rate of HAI varied considerably from a low of less than 1% for psychiatry to a high of more than 28% for intensive care (Zarb et al., 2012) . That is, almost one-third of the most acutely ill and vulnerable patients (those need intensive intervention) acquired an infection while in care.

It will be recalled from Chapters 1 and 2 that substantial control over infection in the general community was delivered as part of the epidemiologic transition. It is an irony, therefore, that modern healthcare practices intended to relieve suffering and spare lives are the cause of a global epidemic of infection-related death. It is a double irony that the main cause of HAI is something as banal as a lack of hygiene by healthcare personnel.

Infections can be localized to particular bodily sites or they can be systemic (affecting the body generally), and may involve any or all systems of the body. Infectious microorganisms may come from endogenous or exogenous sites. Endogenous sites include organs of the body normally inhabited by microbes, including the nose, mouth, and throat, the gastrointestinal system, and the genitourinary system. Exogenous sites are those other than the patient, including medical devices and equipment, the healthcare environment (e.g., door handles, walls, and other surfaces), visitors, and most importantly healthcare personnel as they move from one location of the hospital to another. In addition to being located at multiple sites in the healthcare environment, infectious organisms have multiple routes of transmission. Many infections in the nonhospital environment are transmitted by means of a carrier or vector. Vector-borne diseases that remain common in some regions of the world include malaria, dengue fever, hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, and typhus. Common vectors for such infections include mosquitoes, ticks, flies, fleas, lice, birds, bats, rats, and other vermin. The main vector in the transmission of infections in hospitals is human. While this may include patient-to-patient and visitor-to-patient transmission of disease, by far the most potent infectious-disease vectors in healthcare settings are healthcare personnel-principally doctors and nurses.",

The main reason for these devices and procedures causing infection is inadequate hygiene by those tasked with delivering curative care, and the main mechanism by which this happens is failure by doctors and nurses to wash their hands. Although HAI is sometimes portrayed as new, hospitals have always been sites of infection transmission, as may be surmised from the scene depicted in Figure 6 .2.

He surmised that the difference in mortality rate was probably related to the different duties performed by the two groups. He noted, in particular, that the physicians and their students routinely performed autopsy dissections, whereas the midwives did not. Semmelweis hypothesized that puerperal fever was caused by the \"conveyance of decomposed animal-organic matter\" carried on the hands of physicians and transferred to Continued BOX 6.1 The Father of Infection Control-cont'd expectant mothers at the time of childbirth. Crucially, he devised an intervention to test his hypothesis. Beginning in 1847, physicians and medical students were required to wash their hands in a solution of bleach prior to assisting with deliveries. Mortality due to puerperal fever in that ward immediately fell to a level approximating that of the ward staffed by midwives. Figure 6 .4 shows that during the period before 1841, when both wards were staffed by a combination of physicians and midwives, the average rate of mortality due to puerperal fever was similar for the two wards. From 1841 to 1846, the mortality rate increased sharply for the ward staffed by physicians and fell for the ward staffed by midwives. The role of physicians in transmitting disease, concealed when both wards were staffed by physicians and midwives, was revealed.

In repudiation of the then popular miasma theory of disease, Gordon also argued that puerperal fever is not due \"to a noxious constitution of the atmosphere.\" Given that Holmes knew of Gordon's work and acknowledged its importance (Lowis, 1993) , it is possible that Semmelweis was familiar with both.",

What unites Semmelweis, Holmes, and Gordon is their shared perspicacity and tenacity. They are all likewise united, as are many bearers of uncomfortable ideas before and since, by how they were ignored and sometimes berated by professional colleagues for the views they espoused and the forcefulness with which they argued them. In his day, Semmelweis suffered many rebukes, but today he is applauded as the Father of Infection Control (Best and Neuhauser, 2004) . when these occur in unhygienic surroundings. The term has since been replaced by more specific terminology that identifies the site and severity of infection. Broadly, pathogenic organisms that invade the bloodstream and lymph system may cause potentially fatal septicemia (blood poisoning). When Semmelweis first drew attention to the possibility, there was resistance among physicians to the suggestion that they themselves were a common cause of patient death. However, bacteriological discoveries later in the nineteenth century, including those of Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch, led to acceptance of the germ theory of disease over the previously popular miasma theory. Confirmation of the germ theory provided convincing evidence that healthcare personnel, practices, and procedures can be a potent cause of disease.",

Hospital-based protocols for the surveillance, prevention, and control of HAI centered on hand hygiene have been in place since the 1950s (Haidee and Custodio, 2012) . In 2005, the WHO launched a global campaign to reduce HAI and identified the promotion of hand hygiene as a priority (Pittet et al., 2009 ). The WHO guidelines provide healthcare personnel, hospital administrators, and health authorities with specific recommendations for FIGURE 6.4 Mid-nineteenth century mortality due to puerperal fever in the University of Vienna General Hospital. Note. The intriguing story of Ignas Semmelweis has entered medical folklore, which may account for discrepancies in detail to be found in the varied literature describing his observations. In particular, some accounts of his work refer to a mortality rate due to puerperal fever of almost 20% when doctors assisted childbirths compared to a rate of 2% for midwife-assisted births. The estimates reproduced here are among the more conservative of those reported. (Adapted from Funkhouser, 2012, Table 1 , p. 5.) improving practices to reduce the transmission of pathogenic microorganisms in healthcare settings (WHO, 2009). Figure 6 .5 is illustrative of the standards promulgated by the WHO, wherein healthcare personnel are required to perform hand hygiene between the last hand-to-surface contact with an object outside the \"patient zone\" and the first contact in the patient zone; before an aseptic task (e.g., giving an injection or performing wound care); immediately after a care task associated with risk of exposing hands to body fluids and before any subsequent hand-to-surface exposure; when leaving the patient zone and before touching an object outside the patient zone; and after hand exposure to any surface in the patient zone but without touching the patient (Sax et al., 2007) . For some tasks, the use of gloves is standard procedure, and hand hygiene is required before donning gloves. Use of gloves, however, is not a substitute for hand washing.",

(Ghafur, 2010, p. 144) Antimicrobial drugs (antibiotics) are of several types, including antibacterials, as well as antivirals, antifungals, and antiparasitics. Some microorganisms survive exposure to antimicrobial drugs, and are said to be resistant. Resistance may be intrinsic or acquired, but the latter is of particular concern because it means that drugs that had previously been used to treat specific infections may no longer be effective. Use of antibiotics creates a selective advantage for the survival of the organisms with genes for resistance, and encourages the spread of antibiotic resistance throughout an ecosystem of bacteria. Due to the intensive use of antibiotics in healthcare settings, hospitals generally, and intensive-care facilities in particular, are major sources of acquired drug resistance. Resistant organisms are not only transmitted within healthcare settings but also into the community by patients when discharged. The problem is especially critical when pathogenic organisms develop resistance to several drugs that had previously been found useful in clinical practice. These multiple drug (or multidrug) resistant (MDR) pathogens (\"superbugs\") pose a growing threat to population health worldwide (WHO, 2012) . Public awareness of multidrug resistance is most strongly associated with various serious infections that have become increasingly endemic in healthcare settings. The more familiar pathogens include the Gram-positive bacteria methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and Clostridium difficile (C. difficile), and the Gramnegative Acinetobacter, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Escherichia coli BOX 6.2 Gram-Positive and Gram-Negative Bacteria Hans Christian Joachim Gram (1853 -1938 .

While working in the morgue of the city hospital of Berlin, he developed a method, which bears his name, for staining bacteria. The Gram stain is almost always the first step in the identification of a bacterial organism, and it is used to differentiate bacterial species into two main groups. Gram invented the method not for the specific purpose of distinguishing one type of bacterium from another, but for the more general purpose of enabling bacteria to be seen more readily in stained sections under a microscope. As typically employed, a Gram stain is made using an initial stain of crystal violet and a counterstain of safranin. Bacteria that turn blue or purple when stained are called \"Gram positive,\" whereas those that turn pink or red when counterstained are called \"Gram negative.\" Some organisms are Gram-variable, meaning that they may stain either positive or negative, and others are Gram indeterminate. Alternative techniques for identifying bacteria are also available (e.g., genetic markers).",

The explanation for this shift in attention is that resistance is developing faster in Gram-negative than in Gram-positive bacteria, and fewer antibiotics are either available or in development to provide therapeutic cover against Gram-negative bacteria. These bacteria have not only been responsible for devastating hospitaland community-acquired disease, but their rapid spread has been aided by human travel and migration (Schofield, 2011) . One particular form of international travel that has been identified as having markedly enhanced potential to accelerate the rate of bacterial transmission worldwide is medical tourism, sometimes called added value travel. This involves people traveling between countries in pursuit of lower-cost medical procedures, often for elective surgery, such as cosmetic procedures, but increasingly also for corrective surgery. It is claimed that, in India alone, this trade, which is forecast to increase, currently caters for 450,000 people per year as part of an industry worth about USD2 billion (Walsh and Toleman, 2011) .",

Bacteria containing this genetic element (or variants) acquire resistance to almost all antimicrobial agents. The ability to transmit among usual Gram-negative bacteria confers enormous potential for the NDM-1 gene pool to go largely undetected. It has been estimated that at least 100 million Indian residents carry NDM-1 bacteria as normal gut flora having the potential to cause vast numbers of cases of largely untreatable infection (Walsh and Toleman, 2011) . The first confirmed appearance of NDM-1 was in Sweden in 2008 in a patient who returned home with the infection after being hospitalized in India (Yong et al., 2009) and identification of other similar cases quickly followed. Bacteria containing the gene have since been isolated in many countries covering most regions of the world, raising fears about the \"uncontrollable spread of pandemic clones for which new and effective antibiotics are currently not available\" (Rolain et al., 2010 (Rolain et al., , p. 1700 ).",

In that context, it is notable that the reservoir of NDM-1 infection in the Indian subcontinent has been attributed primarily to poor sanitation for hundreds of millions of residents (Walsh and Toleman, 2011) . It should also be noted that there is a history in India of easy access to antibiotics with or without a prescription. Indian physician Abdul Ghafur has claimed that \"India, is the world leader in antibiotic resistance, in no other country [have] antibiotics been misused to such an extent\" (Ghafur, 2010, p. 144) . High levels of bacterial pollution of the environment and endemic infection in the population have encouraged antibiotic use in India as a substitute for sanitation. Considering the largely unfettered access to antibiotics, continuing rapid development of antimicrobial resistance in community and healthcare settings is largely guaranteed. International travel, especially medical tourism, threatens to exacerbate the global transmission of increasingly antibiotic resistant pathogens.",

The fact that the quantity of antibiotics that goes to healthy animals exceeds the total amount used to treat disease in humans is universally accepted as gross misuse and a major contributor to the emergence of multidrug resistance. The additional fact that some of the same antibiotics used in medicine are also used in food production further compounds the problem of their overuse in animal husbandry.

The greater the number of resistant bacteria present in the intestinal flora of animals, the greater is the likelihood of genes encoding resistance being disseminated into the environment. This could include transfer to wild animals, birds, and fish, thereby adding to existing threats from emerging infectious diseases in wildlife populations (Daszak et al., 2000) . Additionally, there is increased risk of transfer of resistance genes to humans from the consumption of farmed animals. Consequently, not only can resistant animal pathogens cause human disease, but resistance genes transferred from animals to the normal intestinal flora of humans can also cause disease. Thus, the carriage of resistance genes by pathogenic as well \"normal\" bacteria greatly increases the threat of infectious diseases being disseminated throughout human populations. Notwithstanding the enormous harm from healthcare-acquired infections, the extent of that harm is thought by some to be dwarfed by the potential threat to health from resistant bacteria emanating from current practices in animal husbandry (van den Bogaard and Stobberingh, 2000).",

The package includes six actions: surveillance of antimicrobial resistance and use; rational antimicrobial use and regulation; reducing or eliminating antimicrobial use in animal husbandry; infection prevention and control; fostering innovations; and political commitment. The essentials of each strategy are summarized in Box 6.3. Of many strategies proposed to counter antibiotic resistance, particular attention to date has been given to drug innovation, antibiotic stewardship, and isolation practice. Monitoring of antibiotic use and occurrence of resistant bacteria as a basis for planning strategies, and for mobilizing local, national, and international resources and commitment to action. Currently, surveillance varies between countries and regions, and coordination is needed to provide more extensive and uniform geographic coverage Measures to ensure better use of antibiotics Much of the antimicrobial resistance problem stems from the misuse of antibiotics, particularly excessive use. If antibiotics were always prescribed appropriately and only when needed, the treatment correctly followed, never used in agriculture or aquaculture, and if substandard and counterfeit products could be abolished, selective pressure on bacteria to become resistant would be reduced. Development of regulations and practical measures is needed, as is political agreement to put into practice the regulations and measures that are required Reducing antimicrobial use in animal husbandry Antibiotics are used widely and in immense quantities for preventing disease and promoting growth of livestock, poultry, and fish reared for food production. Although some countries have banned the use of antibiotics as growth promoters, the practice remains widespread. Legislation and regulation with enforcement are needed in many countries to control the use of antibiotics in animal husbandry Considering the inexorable increase in antimicrobial-resistant infections, a dearth of new antibiotics, and little incentive for industry to invest in research and development in this field, innovative approaches are reputed to be crucial for the development of new products to counter the rise of antimicrobial resistance.

The strategy assumes that in time the new agents will also succumb to the relentless spread of resistance, at which time they must then be replaced by still newer agents. No one has addressed the problem of how many cycles this process might need to be repeated, but in principle it could continue ad infinitum. It seems, however, that this replacement strategy is advocated more often for want of something better to do, rather than genuine belief that it can work. The accepted reality among many commentators is that bacteria \"overwhelm us with their superior numbers, they reproduce with remarkable speed, and they develop extremely efficient ways to exchange and promulgate resistance genes\" (Moellering, 2010 (Moellering, , p. 2379 .

            "text": "Over the past decade there has been a crescendo of claims by industry leaders, health authorities, and policy makers about a putative innovation crisis in pharmaceutical research. Reasons for the crisis in drug innovation (in general, not only antibiotics) include overcoming practical and intellectual challenges of new drug discovery, conducting multiple trials to determine safety and efficacy, and navigating the regulatory hurdles involved in obtaining approval for clinical use, with the whole process taking possibly 10-15 years to complete one cycle. Additionally, with respect to antibiotics, there is the likelihood of a relatively short period of effectiveness (and profitability) due to loss of efficacy from resistance, and the need for further replacement with the next new drug. In short, it does not pay the pharmaceutical industry to go to all that trouble and expense to develop drugs that bacterial resistance may render redundant before costs can be recouped and profits reaped. Light and Lexchin (2012) , however, have argued that the innovation crisis, at least, as usually portrayed, is a myth. The real crisis they explain is that current incentives do not reward companies for genuine innovation in drug development. Rather, companies are rewarded for redesigning existing drugs in ways that allow the modified product to be promoted as \"new.\" Typically, the new drugs offer little advantage over earlier versions, and may even be less effective, a topic discussed in the next chapter. The relevant point here is that \"telling 'innovation crisis' stories to politicians and the press serves as a ploy\" to extract benefits from government such as taxpayer subsidies and protection from competition (Light and Lexchin, 2012) . At present, industry strategy is to focus on the easier challenge of developing new drugs of low efficacy that are not needed while ignoring the bigger challenge of developing drugs of high efficacy, including new antibiotics, that everyone believes are needed. Industry's emphasis on profitability, not need, is reflected in the global distribution of the research effort dedicated to the development of drugs in general. Moreover, comparing high-and low-income countries, there is an almost fourfold greater number of drugs in the development pipeline for diseases prevalent in highincome countries (where high profits are to be made) than for diseases prevalent in low-income countries (Fisher et al., 2014) . In that regard, industry priorities contribute directly to health inequalities globally.",

Intervention of the kind proposed is tantamount to government being urged to use public funds to intervene in the free market for the purpose of underwriting commercial ventures. It is well to remember, however, that profit-based innovation has thus far led to decidedly perverse outcomes in the form of progressive erosion of antibiotic potency and the threat of global pandemic infection from resistant pathogens.

One such measure is the use of contact isolation, which includes physical separation of patients to prevent person-to-person spread of infection; use of masks, gloves, gowns, and other protection; and special procedures for the handling and disposal of contaminated items, including body fluids and materials used in clinical care. As with instrument counting, discussed earlier in this chapter, isolation has considerable intuitive appeal as a strategy for limiting harm. However, as with instrument counting, studies have found that the efficacy of contact isolation can be disappointing and that it can cause unexpected harm for the patients who are isolated.",

Additionally, compared to patients not isolated, patients who are isolated have been found to be at increased risk of harm, including delays in treatment and increased incidence of adverse events (Zahar et al., 2013) . The fact that harm may be more frequent for isolated patients is salient because of the high levels of surveillance and staffing that accompany isolation, with the staffing ratio in the Zahar et al. (2013) study being one nurse for every two patients. The findings provide further confirmation that irrespective of evident great \"care,\" implied here by the provision of high levels of materials, personnel, and expertise characteristic of intensive isolation care, little happens in clinical medicine without patients being harmed.",

F\u00e4tkenheuer et al. (2014) have proffered an interesting argument based on the notion that isolation, such as imprisonment, is the prototypical punishment that society imposes on wrongdoers. As such, it is unsurprising that patients subjected to isolation may experience increased anxiety, depression, and resentment. Indeed, apart from absence of uniformity concerning suitable isolation methods, such as use of gowns, gloves, masks, and isolation rooms, considerable uncertainty exists in hospitals regarding the circumstances that warrant the use of contact isolation. Considering the legal and other safeguards that exist in society to prevent unwarranted isolation, such as wrongful imprisonment, F\u00e4tkenheuer et al. have questioned the absence of safeguards against \"wrongful isolation\" in hospitals.",

Such situations are characterized by what economists call information asymmetry in which one party in a transaction has more relevant knowledge about what is being transacted than the other party. Medical practice is fraught with moral hazard, wherein greater knowledge about clinical \"transactions\" resides with practitioners who benefit financially, socially, and professionally, while risksincluding negative side effects of treatment-disproportionately accrue to patients. The overuse of antibiotics is illustrative. Antibiotics have provided doctors with a convenient and professionally sanctioned means of responding to patients' requests for care, even when treating self-limiting conditions such as common cold for which antibiotics are ineffective. In that context, it is striking that much of the discourse about harm from antibiotic resistance alludes to \"unintended consequences\" from well-intentioned actions.",

However, the emergence of resistance was always anticipated. From the earliest clinical use of antibiotics more than 70 years ago, antibiotic resistance was not merely observed but was wellunderstood and predicted on the basis of principles of Darwinian selection (Davies and Davies, 2010) . Therefore, to regard antibiotic resistance as an unintended consequence is to engage in euphemism and prevarication. The likely reoccurrence of antibiotic resistance following the introduction of each new antibiotic has certainly been anticipated. Global population endangerment from the misuse of antibiotics in the absence of strenuous action to at least impede if not stop the evolution of antibiotic resistance, when its occurrence was anticipated all along, is illustrative of the moral hazard intrinsic to biomedical healthcare and commercial husbandry. 6.5.5 Given Past Neglect, What Does the Future Hold?",

Although antibiotic resistance in the natural environment is known to predate the human discovery of antibiotics, most bacterial species are not intrinsically resistant to manufactured antibiotics. Resistance is acquired due to exposure to antibiotics, a process that has been accelerated beyond measure due to the immense quantities of antibiotics manufactured and distributed annually, a large proportion of which is released unchanged into the environment as waste. This creates vast microbial ecosystems containing strong selection pressures that favor antibiotic-resistant strains. Gillings and Stokes (2012) have argued that the rapid and widespread evolution of antibiotic resistance in bacterial pathogens is evidence of the dramatic influence humans can have on evolutionary processes (much as was discussed in Chapter 2 in the context of niche construction theory), which in this instance has led to change in the rate of bacterial evolution. Many antibiotics are designed to have a broad spectrum of activity, which imposes selection pressures on a correspondingly broad range of bacterial species. Gillings and Stokes speculate that an environment saturated with antimicrobial agents has the potential to influence genetic mutation, recombination, and lateral gene transfer in ways capable of dramatically accelerating the natural rate of microbial evolution. In consequence, existing microbial pathogens may become progressively more dangerous, and novel species of virulent and resistant pathogens could emerge. These possibilities underlie much of the concern about the emergence of antibiotic resistance.",

It was the result of farreaching changes in human habits and habitats precipitated by the Industrial Revolution. Moreover, to the extent that death and morbidity from largely untreatable infections are common in healthcare settings, it could be said that within the confines of the modern hospital the world has already substantially returned to the pre-antibiotic era. The spread of antibiotic-resistant infections from hospitals to communities could well mark wholesale return to epidemic levels of population infection equivalent to, or even greater than, those that existed before the epidemiologic transition. If so, the epidemics will be due not so much to loss of antibiotic potency but to misuse of antibiotics. In short, the belief that loss of antibiotic efficacy will by itself cause a return to high levels of population infection is false. Rather, the real threat lies in population dissemination of new, untreatable, and largely \"unnatural\" strains of infectious pathogens. Pathogens caused by the use of antibiotics and against which humans have little or no natural resistance. Unlike the past, confronted with new pathogens possessing high mortality and efficient transmission, strong immunity buttressed by highly efficient physical barriers such as are provided by modern sanitation and hygiene may no longer be sufficient.",

United States President Barack Obama (2014) recently issued an executive order titled, Combating Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria.
