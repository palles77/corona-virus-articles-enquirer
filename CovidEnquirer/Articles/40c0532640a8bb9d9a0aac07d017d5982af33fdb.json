It has been suspected that FCoV alters its biotype via mutations in the viral genome. The S and 3c genes of FCoV have been considered the candidates for viral pathogenicity conversion. In the present study, FCoVs were analyzed for the frequency and location of mutations in the S and 3c genes from faecal samples of cats in an animal shelter and the faeces, effusions, and tissues of cats that were referred to veterinary hospitals. Our results indicated that approximately 95% FCoVs in faeces did not carry mutations in the two genes. However, 80% FCoVs in effusion samples exhibited mutations in the S and 3c genes with remainder displaying a mutation in the S or 3c gene. It was also suggested that mutational analysis of the 3c gene could be useful for studying the horizontal transmission of FCoVs in multi-cat environments.",

FCoV infection is prevalent in cats worldwide and is divided into two biotypes: feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). The former has low pathogenicity, causing mild enteritis or unapparent infection, and the latter is highly virulent and lethal. FIP is characterised by the accumulation of body cavity effusions (effusive or wet form) and the formation of granulomatous lesions affecting multiple organs (non-effusive or dry form) [10] . FIPVs are considered mutants of FECVs [11, 12, 14] .",

The S gene encodes spike protein on the viral membrane. It was reported that 95.8% of 118 serotype I FIPVs displayed missense mutations in codon 1,058 or 1,060 of the S gene, whereas none of the sample of 183 FECVs exhibited these mutations [6] . The non-synonymous mutations in codons 1,058 and 1,060 substituted methionine to leucine (M1,058L) and serine to alanine (S1,060A), respectively. The 3c gene encoding an accessory viral protein was also reported to be mutated in 60-100% of FIPVs, resulting in the loss or truncation of the 3c protein, whereas most FECVs carried an intact 3c gene [3-5, 8, 11, 13, 14]. Accordingly, it was considered that mutation of the S gene, 3c gene or both was involved in the acquisition or augmentation of lethal pathogenicity in the majorityof FIPV field strains. In the present study, we analyzed the S and 3c genes of FCoVs detected in faecal materials, effusion samples, and tissues that were obtained from cats in Japan to determine the frequency and location of the mutations. An analysis of the 3c gene suggested the horizontal infection of FCoVs, which were detected in effusions and tissues, among several housemate cats in a multi-cat environment.",

The primers were used at a final concentration of 0.5 \u00b5M. The S gene fragments were amplified to determine the FCoV serotype (I or II) in each animal. Amplification of the 3c and S genes, including codons 1,058 and 1,060, via first-round PCR was performed as follows: initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 2 min; 50 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, 50\u00b0C for 30 sec and 72\u00b0C for 45 sec; and final extension at 72\u00b0C for 7 min. In some cases, the 3c and S genes were amplified via nested RT-PCR, in which a secondround reaction was performed using the same PCR cycle parameters. The S gene-based serotyping was carried out together with the 3c gene amplification under the same reaction protocol or separately via single or nested RT-PCR, wherein the reaction protocol was the same except for a shortened extension time of 20 sec. The PCR products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel and amplified DNA fragments were retrieved using the Wizard \u00ae SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega). The extracted product was directly sequenced using a BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit on a genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems 3130, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, U.S.A.). Some amplicons were cloned into a pCR2.1-TOPO vector using a TOPO \u00ae TA Cloning \u00ae Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and sequenced using M13 primers or the primers used for RT-PCR. The obtained 3c gene sequences were analyzed to determine the types and locations of mutations via comparisons with type I FECV strains RM (FJ938051) and UU19 (HQ392470) and type II FIPV strain KUK-H/L (AB781789), none of which carry mutations resulting in the production of truncated proteins. GENETYX 13 (Genetyx Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and BioEdit 7.1.3.0 [7] software were used for sequence analysis. All determined 3c gene sequences were submitted to the DNA Data Bank of Japan.

Our present study revealed that type I FCoVs in ascites and pleural effusion samples had the M1,058L and S1,060A missense mutations at a rate of 80.0 and 13.3%, respectively. Because histopathological examinations of the cats were not performed, the biotypes of FCoVs analyzed in this study could not be determined. Therefore, the relationship between the biotypes and gene mutations was not analyzed. However, it is considered that approximately \u226590% FCoVs in effusion samples have one of the S gene mutations. On the contrary, neither M1,058L nor S1,060A mutations were found in FCoVs in any of the 19 faecal samples from shelter cats, some of which had soft stools, indicating enteritis. A previous report indicated that none of the FECVs in rectal swabs carried a mutation at codon 1,058 or 1,060 [6] . Accordingly, it is suggested that majority FCoVs in faeces of clinically healthy cats and cats with only mild enteritis carry the S genes without any of these mutations. The M1,058L mutation was also detected in faeces and tissues of four young diseased cats that had died. The biotype of the viruses was unknown, but faecal FCoVs with the M1,058L or S1,060A mutation would require experimental infection for pathogenicity determination, even when FIP was confirmed via histopathological examination. Previous studies have identified truncating mutations of the 3c gene in the genomes of >60% of FIPVs, whereas most FECVs carried intact 3c genes. Although the precise molecular function of the 3c protein is unknown, it has been reported to play an essential role in FECV replication in the intestines [2, 13] . Our present study determined that 87.5% FCoVs in body cavity effusions, which included type I and II viruses, and all type I FCoVs, in six tissues collected from four cats, carried 3c gene mutations resulting in the truncation or loss of 3c protein. However, such mutations were not detected in the majority of faecal FCoVs of shelter cats that did not exhibit any clinical symptoms except for soft stools. This finding is similar to previously published data [3, 6] . Therefore, it is considered that in addition to the M1,058L and S1,060A mutations in the S gene, a truncating mutation of the 3c gene is another genetic feature that is relatively characteristic of FCoVs in effusions and tissues. Molecular functional analysis of the 3c protein is required to elucidate the influence of the 3c gene mutation on the FCoVs. The M1,058L or S1,060A mutations were found along with a 3c gene truncating mutation in 80.0% type I FCoVs from 30 effusion samples, whereas the mutation of either the S or 3c gene was detected in 13.3 and 6.7% of the FCoVs in effusions, respectively. Because the S genes were not mutated and 3c genes were intact in the majority of faecal FCoVs, it is suggested that a mutation of either or both the genes are involved in the alteration of tissue tropism of FCoVs.",

'Wild-type' indicates a sequence encoding 237 amino acids (aa), which is present in most feline enteric coronaviruses. Every sequence shown below contains a mutation resulting in loss, truncation or elongation of the 3c protein in comparison with the wild-type sequence. Arabic numerals on the left indicate the number assigned to the cat. S10 was a cat from an animal shelter. The virus serotype in cat 1 and cat 58 was II, as indicated in parentheses. Each sequence is shown as a horizontal line with the number of nucleotides (nt) and predicted number of amino acids (aa). A deletion is indicated by a white break with '\u2206' and the number of deleted nt. An insertion (Ins) is shown at the insertion position with the number of inserted nucleotides. An asterisk (*) denotes a stop codon. Black colour indicates the portion of the sequence expected to be translated. Grey colour denotes the portion of the sequence that will not be translated due to a premature stop codon. The sequences are arranged in order of descending protein length for each sample type. An effusion sample from cat 33 contained two variant viruses, one of which harbored an nt substitution in the start codon.
