            "text": "Oligonucleotide microarrays have been applied to microbial surveillance and discovery where highly multiplexed assays are required to address a wide range of genetic targets. Although printing density continues to increase, the design of comprehensive microbial probe sets remains a daunting challenge, particularly in virology where rapid sequence evolution and database expansion confound static solutions. Here, we present a strategy for probe design based on protein sequences that is responsive to the unique problems posed in virus detection and discovery. The method uses the Protein Families database (Pfam) and motif finding algorithms to identify oligonucleotide probes in conserved amino acid regions and untranslated sequences. In silico testing using an experimentally derived thermodynamic model indicated near complete coverage of the viral sequence database.",

Their utility has been demonstrated through detection of papilloma virus in cervical lesions (1) , SARS coronavirus in tissue culture (2) , parainfluenza virus 4 in nasopharyngeal aspirates (3) , influenza from nasal wash and throat swabs (4, 5) , gammaretrovirus in prostate tumors (6) , coronaviruses and rhinoviruses from nasal lavage (7) , metapneumovirus from bronchoalveolar lavage (8) , filoviruses and malarial parasites in blood in hemorrhagic fever (9) , and a wide variety of respiratory pathogens in nasal swabs and lung tissue (10) . Viral microarrays have increased in density and strain coverage as fabrication technologies have improved. cDNA pathogen arrays derived from reference strain nucleic acids (11, 12) have been replaced by oligonucleotide arrays due to their increased flexibility. Oligonucleotide design strategies have focused on pairwise sequence comparisons to identify conserved regions within a variety of viral pathogens (13) (14) (15) . Multiple alignments have been used to design probes for clinically important virus genera, e.g. rotaviruses (16) , orthopoxviruses (17) or influenzaviruses (18) . Viral resequencing arrays have recently been introduced that allow single nucleotide resolution (4, (19) (20) (21) . Although such tiling arrays enable accurate typing, the number of probes required to build a resequencing array for all viral sequences exceeds current art.",

            "text": "The most recent Pfam-A release (Version 22) comprised 9318 families, of which 1540 had viral members. Of 405 543 annotated protein sequences with length >20 aa, 278 119 (68.6%) belonged to a Pfam-A family, while 127 424 (31.4%) did not. Three probes were chosen for each gene, yielding a total of 104 467 cPf and 133 513 cNPf probes. Of sequences not contained in Pfam-A, only 5.6% (6956) were found in Pfam-B alignments. Thus, due to the lower quality of alignments (23) and poor viral representation, the Pfam-B was not used for probe design. The 12 428 untranslated regions processed yielded 4616 probes. For the 24 841 unannotated sequences processed, 13 740 probes were designed. Sequences that were not covered due to high/low GC%, low complexity, repetitive sequence or a preponderance of ambiguous nucleotides (4244) were processed with a sliding window strategy; 14 530 probes were designed. Overall, the number of probes required to address all viral sequences was 270 866. Sequence counts and probe counts for the most recent EMBL/Pfam release are detailed in Figure 4 . An example of typical probe distribution is shown with respect to the Dengue virus 1 genome (NC_001477; Figure 5 ).",

Strong signal was observed from probe-virus hybrids with \u00c1G of \u00c032.5 kJ or less.

Probes of 60 nt were designed end-to-end along the entire genome for all 1701 Reference Sequence viral strains available as of May 2007. The tiling probe set served as a contrast to our design method since it was based on nucleic acid sequence, had more probes per gene, required less computation, and included viruses from all genera. In comparison of the methods, the following rules were used to compute database coverage: sequences >400 nt in length were considered covered if six or more probes met hybridization criteria; sequences <400 nt in length were considered covered if two probes met hybridization criteria; sequences <200 nt in length were considered covered with a single probe meeting hybridization criteria. Coverage of the entire database was gauged by computing probe-template \u00c1G for all 74 044 unique sequence representatives. Database coverage using the tiling method was 47.8% and required 850 136 probes; coverage using the motif-based method was 99.7% and required 270 866 probes (Table 1) .",

Viral microarray probe design poses unique challenges due to the rapid increase in sequence data and the high propensity for sequence divergence within viral taxa. To ensure coverage of the newest isolates it is essential to consider partial as well as complete genomic sequences in probe design. Probe design based on multiple alignments or pairwise comparisons of nucleic acids for all known sequences is computationally intensive and scales poorly with database size. Protein sequence comparisons are rapid and incorporate rich evolutionary models, but require a cumbersome mapping step to extract underlying nucleic acid sequence. We have described a method that capitalizes on the Pfam protein alignment database and a motif finding algorithm to automate the extraction of nucleic acid sequence for probes from conserved protein regions. The protein motif-centric method has several advantages: (i) the majority of viral nucleic acid sequences encode proteins; thus, using this information leverages knowledge about function; (ii) protein sequence comparison and the resulting probesets are independent of viral taxonomy; this may enable incorporation of misclassified sequences; (iii) the Pfam is a well established and highly annotated database that will provide a basis for future design efforts; and (iv) probes designed in conserved regions may be able to detect novel viruses.",

The fluorescent signal values of replicate arrays were log 2 transformed, normalized, and converted to Z-scores. 95% confidence intervals of the mean for fluorescence versus Gibbs energy is plotted.

Probe length can be selected to emphasize efficient coverage of higher order taxa or speciation. The goal of this project is to cover all known viral sequences and optimize potential for detecting related viral sequences. Thus, we designed 60 nt probes because they can better tolerate mismatched templates than 25 nt oligonucleotide probes (45) .
