            "text": "The definition of 'fat' or f-purines is explained (Scheme 1), using guanine (G) as an example. 'Fat' purines are largely 5:7-fused ring systems containing an imidazole ring fused to a variety of 7-membered nitrogen heterocycles with amino and/or carbonyl functional groups, and thus can be structurally regarded as ring-expanded purines. When the ring fusion goes beyond the 5:7fused systems, such as 5:8, 5:9 or 5:10, we informally refer to them as 'super fat' (sf) purines. The corresponding ring-expanded nucleoside and nucleotide analogues are often referred to as RENs and RENTs. ' Fat' purines and their nucleoside and nucleotide analogues are of chemical, biochemical, biophysical and medicinal interest. From a chemical standpoint, their synthesis, structure, stability, acid-base properties, aromaticity, and tautomeric equilibria, are worth exploring. From a biochemical perspective, they are an abundant source of substrates or inhibitors of enzymes of purine metabolism, as well as of those requiring energy cofactors. From a biophysical point of view, they are potentially excellent probes for nucleic acid structure, function, and metabolism. From a medicinal stance, they proved to be anticancer and antiviral agents <02CTMC1093>. They may also have other therapeutic uses, for example, f-purines can be regarded as analogues of the extensively-explored benzodi-and triazepines, a family of powerful pharmaceuticals acting on the central nervous system <00PZ871; 08CDM827>.",

Secondly, the presence of several N atoms in the heterocyclic ring makes it difficult to predict and plan the specific site of glycosylation a priori, and normally more than one regioisomer is obtained <91NN819; 92NN1175; 92NN1137>.

            "text": "Biochemically, because of their structural similarity to natural counterparts, f-purines and their nucleoside/-tide analogues (RENs and RENTs) are potentially rich sources of substrates or inhibitors of enzymes of purine metabolism <B-67MI287; 70PMC69; 71ARB811; B-95MI89>, and of those enzymes requiring energy cofactors such as GTP or ATP. Important precedents for potential substrate/inhibitory activity of ring-expanded nucleosides are provided by nature itself in the form of three naturally-occurring antitumor antibiotics, coformycin <74JA4326; 74JA4327; 76ACR1206; 83NN479> and pentostatin (2'-deoxy-coformycin) <74JHC641; 79JA6127; 82JOC3457; 83JHC629; 84B904; 87B5636>, which contain the 5:7-fused imidazo[4,5-d][1,3]diazepine ring system, and are the strongest known inhibitors of adenosine deaminase (ADA) <77BP359; B-78MI159>, and azepinomycin <87JAN1461; 88H(27)1163>, a non-nucleoside containing the imidazo[4,5-e][1,4]diazepine ring skeleton, which is reported to inhibit guanine deaminase (guanase) <87JAN1461; 88H(27)1163> (Scheme 2). All three antibiotics possess a tetrahedral geometry at the hydroxyl junction of their seven-membered ring and hence are regarded as transition state analogue inhibitors of ADA and guanase <B-78MI159; 87JAN1461; 88H(27)1163>. Not surprisingly, the majority of work done by others in this area has been targeted to either coformycins or their synthetic analogues <83TL4789; 85JHC349; 86JOC1050>, with only a few exceptions <67JAN227; 75HCA2192; 80DAN591; 88JHC1179; 89JMS175; 90J(P1)173; 90JMC2818; 98B11949>. By contrast, the RENs and RENTs under study in the Author's laboratory cover a broad range of both planar <94NN2307> and puckered molecules <92NN1175>, and as such, can potentially act as substrates and/or inhibitors of a wide variety of enzymes of purine metabolism, besides ADA and guanase. Biophysically, nucleotides that incorporate steric bulk in their skeleta, as compared with their natural counterparts, offer a unique means of exploring steric and conformational constraints of formation of nucleic acid double helices. Steric bulk is often associated with considerable structural deviations from the natural array. The replacement of a natural nucleotide by a ringexpanded nucleotide (RENT) affects the base-pairing and stacking interactions of nucleic acids. This would have consequent impact upon helical structure, stability, and conformations of single-and double-stranded RNA and DNA helices. Biophysical studies employing RENTs should aid in understanding better the factors and parameters that govern the formation, structure and stability of nucleic acid double helices <B-87MI269; B-87MI280>. Furthermore, because of their unique geometric features coupled with novel electronic, ionizational, and conformational characteristics, RENTs are also potentially excellent probes for nucleic acid triple helices <B-99MI233; 02COC1333; 08BIE1117>. Therefore, the study of primary and secondary structures of RENs, RENTS, and their polynucleotide derivatives is of both interest and importance <90JOC5882>. The investigations of primary structures and properties includes topology, tautomerism, acid-base properties, aromaticity, etc. of heterocyclic rings, and syn/anti baseribose conformations, endo/exo sugar puckers, and \u03b1/\u03b2-anomeric configurations, etc. of nucleosides <90JOC5882>. Investigations of secondary structures includes helical formation, stability, and conformations of polynucleotides composed of RENTs, and their potential to form double helices by complementary base-pairing with appropriate pyrimidine partners, and by vertical stacking interactions. The secondary structures of nucleic acids are, in large part, governed by the primary structures of the component nucleotides <09JA3791>.",

A vast majority of them have proved to be anticancer or antiviral agents <02CTMC1093>. In searching for a molecular basis of their broad spectrum biological activities, we performed molecular modeling studies, which indeed have provided some very interesting mechanistic notions (Figure 1 ). Shown in Figure 1A is the Watson-Crick base-pairing array for a representative REN containing an fG as a base (shown in magenta), [Molecular modeling studies were performed using QUANTA/CHARMm, available from Accelrys Software, Inc., San Diego. Extensive energy minimization was carried out on the two duplexes, employing Adopted Basis Newton-Raphson (ABNR) protocol to the point of convergence with an RMS gradient <0.001] which is base-paired with natural C (cytosine, shown in yellow). For comparison, this fG...C pair was superimposed on the natural G...C pair (shown in yellow). As can be seen, while fG..C has a favorable base-pair array that is reasonably comparable to that of its natural counterpart, some conspicuous differences do exist. One of these is a considerable deviation of the base-sugar bond of fG from that of G, as shown by arrows. Second is the angle \u03bb, comprising the base-sugar bond of fG and the anomeric carbon of C in a double helix, which is only 39.7\u00b0 as opposed to the typical \u03bb values of 53-58\u00b0 for a natural B-DNA double helix <B-87MI269; B-87Journal280 >. Third, the interstrand distance r is 11.43 \u00c5 for the fG...C pair as contrasted with a typical r value of 10.8-11 \u00c5 in a B-DNA duplex <B-87MI269; B-87MI280>. Such significant deviations of \u03bb and r from the natural array would have dire consequences on the duplex stability of nucleic acids.",

Extensive energy minimization performed on the two duplexes revealed that the incorporation of an fG into DNA causes considerable distortion of the double helix with severe disruption of base-pair hydrogen bonding, ultimately leading to the 'unzipping' of the double-helix starting from the deviant fG residue ( Figure 1B, right) . The implications are that the incorporation of fG into the growing DNA chain during transcription or reverse transcription would potentially (a) hinder incorporation of subsequent nucleotides, (b) cause base-pair disruption, mismatch, or frameshift, and/or (c) prevent formation or cause distortion of the double helix.

Would the incorporation of such nucleotides increase the stability of a double-helix, and to what extent? Would the increased surface area of RENTs enhance the intrastrand stacking interactions?

Despite their highly potent ADA inhibitory activity, they have not been clinically as successful as anticipated, granted that the benefits of using pentostatin for the treatment of leukemias and lymphomas, in particular acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) and hairy cell leukemia, are notable <75BJC544; 78JCI710; 91BJC903; 92PR459; 99CCR65>. Severe toxicities have limited their effective use as broad-spectrum therapeutics <81BLD91; 81BLD406; 81CCP193; 81PAO487>. It is now widely believed that the basis for the toxicities is the prolonged, extremely tight-binding, nearly irreversible inhibition of ADA, an essential metabolic enzyme, by coformycin and pentostatin, which mimic the transition state of the enzyme-catalyzed reaction, thus necessitating the synthesis of a new enzyme molecule each time for recovery from the toxic effects <79FAB670>. Therefore, it is desirable to have ADA inhibitors that are somewhat less tight-binding, easily reversible, but still highly potent with a shorter duration of action and faster enzyme recovery <B-02MI133>. In an effort to find such inhibitors, we carefully examined the reported X-ray crystal structure of a complex of ADA with pentostatin (also called 2'-deoxycoformycin or dCF) (Figure 2 ), <96JMC277; 98B8314> which revealed that its tight-binding characteristics arises from multiple hydrogen bonding of its sugar hydroxyls with the amino acid residues of the protein, coupled with a coordinate bond of its heterocyclic 8-OH group with an active site zinc ion. A notable feature in the crystal structure is the observed anti sugar conformation, in which the sugar was oriented away from the heterocyclic 7-membered ring. This suggested to us that if the conformation is forced to the predominent syn oriention (sugar facing the 7-membered ring) as in 82 because of the anticipated intramolecular hydrogen bonding between the sugar and the heterocycle as shown, some of the hydrogen bonds observed with the anti orientation would be lost, in addition to perhaps weakening the coordinate bond of 8-OH with the zinc ion, thus leading to less tight-binding and more easily reversible inhibition characteristics. Such a high syn orientation has been confirmed both in the crystal state (X-ray) and in solution (NOE studies) in related ring-expanded nucleoside analogues containing the imidazo[4,5-e][1,4]diazepine <90JOC5882; 91NN819>. The observed large NOE (>30%) between H-2 of the imidazole ring and H-1' of the sugar moiety of 82, the synthesis of which is outlined in Scheme 19 <97NN1053>, corroborated its predominantly syn orientation in solution. Indeed, when tested for inhibitory activity against ADA from calf intestinal mucosa, 82 exhibited a K i of 2.02 \u00b1 0.5 x 10 -5 , which is several orders of magnitude lower activity than coformycin, as anticipated <97BBR88>.

This enzyme has been found in human liver, brain, and kidney <65JLCM355>. There have been reports of abnormally high levels of serum guanase activity in patients with liver diseases <88H383; 89JJM22; 89RB1392>, and so, the elevated enzyme activity has been suggested as a marker of hepatitis and hepatoma <89JJM22>.

Increased levels of guanase have also been detected in cancerous kidney and breast cancer tissues <96BCT189; 97CI212; 99JBC8175; 02NS15>. In addition, patients with multiple sclerosis exhibit significantly elevated levels of guanase activity in their cerebral spinal fluids <89RS854>. These observations suggest that a potent guanase inhibitor is necessary for exploring the biochemical mechanisms of the above metabolic disorders as well to understand the specific physiological role played by guanase, not to mention its potential therapeutic use in treating these disorders.

The X-ray crystal structure of GDA <04JBC35479> from Bacillus subtilis suggested that the enzyme-catalyzed reaction is assisted by an active site zinc ion (Zn +2 ) as in ADA, leading to the speculation that the known GDA inhibitor such as azepinomycin 88 may act like a transition state mimic just as coformycins do in case of ADA inhibition described earlier. However, only a moderate inhibition of guanase by 88 has been reported <87JAN1461>, which suggested somewhat weaker binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme via zinc metal coordination. We hypothesized that this might be due to possible facile elimination of the crucial OH group of 88 as water, assisted by the anchimeric ring NH group. Therefore moving the OH group one carbon away from the ring, as in 89, would alleviate this problem. We further hypothesized that the introduction of a carbonyl group at position-5 of 50 the heterocycle, coupled with the presence of a hydroxymethyl group at position-6, as in 89, would allow excellent coordination of the inhibitor with Zn +2 to form a stable, 6-membered ring structure as shown. The latter would use two of the four metal coordination sites, while the other two would be occupied by two of the three original amino acid residues at the enzyme active site.",

Depending upon which one of the three amino groups would assume an imino structure, the nucleoside analogue 100 (Scheme 22) can mimic adenosine, guanosine or iso-guanosine. To resolve this issue, we labeled all three nitrogen atoms of guanidine with N 15 and carried out the condensation with 4,5-dicyanoimidazole 39 to obtain the triply labeled 37* <94NN2307>. The latter, upon standard Vorbr\u00fcggen ribosylation <94NN2307> provided the triply labeled 100. The 15 N NMR of 100 showed two singlets at ~211 \u03b4 (ppm) corresponding to the two labeled ring nitrogen atoms and one triplet (J *N-H = 80 Hz) in the 120-123 \u03b4 region corresponding to the labeled exonuclear NH 2 group, suggesting that the molecule exists as 100a or 100b or as an equilibrium mixture of the two, but never as 100c. The possible existence of both adenosine-and guanosine-like tautomers in solution for 100 gave rise to the notion that it might be possible to design an inhibitor that could simultaneously inhibit both ADA and GDA. But there was an important difference in substrate requirements of the two enzymes that needed to be reconciled. While the natural substrate for ADA is a nucleoside adenosine, that for GDA is a heterocyclic base guanine. In order to circumvent this problem, we decided to attach an acyclic sugar moiety to 37. Synthesis of such an acyclic nucleoside 107 is outlined in Scheme 23 <01BMCL2893>. Both nucleoside 100 and acyclic nucleoside 107 were bichemically assayed, as before, against both ADA and GDA, and as anticipated, nucleoside 100 was found to be a competitive inhibitor of ADA (K i = 3.85 x 10 -5 M)<95MI69>, but not GDA, whereas acyclic nucleoside 107 was found to be a competitive inhibitor of both ADA (K i = 1.52\u00b10.34 x 10 -4 M) and GDA (K i = 2.97\u00b10.25 x 10 -5 M) <01BMCL2893>.

Also, in light of the long-suspected correlation between conformational properties of nucleosides and their observed biological activities, systematic studies continue to be warranted for exploring the little understood interrelationships of nucleoside base-sugar conformations, sugar pucker, ease of in vivo phosphorylation, enzymic polymerization, and biological activity.

This interesting biological result further elevated our interest in the biophysical properties of these isomeric nucleoside analogues. The single-crystal X-ray structure analysis of the two nucleosides ( Figure  3 ) <90JOC5882> revealed that the sugar of 113 existed in a syn orientation as dictated by a strong hydrogen bond between the bottom NH of the 7-membered ring the 5'-O of the sugar ring, while the sugar orientation of 113 was anti. This led to a speculation that if the compounds existed in the same preferred conformation in solution, 113 would be less prone to phosphorylation in vivo than 116 since kinases, the enzymes responsible for in vivo phosphorylation of nucleosides to nucleotides, are known to prefer anti orientation <01B11037>. So, if the actual reactive species in vivo is a nucleotide, that would explain the difference in observed biological activities of the two nucleosides. In an attempt to throw more light on the subject, we first investigated the solution conformations of the two RENs using the 1 H NMRbased Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) <91NN819> and Circular Dichroism studies <89BBC106>. The observed NOE between the imidazole H-2 and the sugar H-1' of 113 was >35% <91NN819> suggesting a highly syn base-sugar conformation, while the same in 116 was 0% consistent with an anti conformation favored by kinases.

We performed further mechanistic studies using the prodrug 131 and found that the compound significantly decreases both RNA and DNA synthesis in MCF-7 cells (see Figures 4 and 5) <02MIP392>. It strongly inhibits the cell proliferation, whereas the cell growth assays demonstrated that 131 (MB-1) only slightly decreased the cell number after incubation for either 6 or 24 hours with the compound. The decrease was equivalent to that observed when the cells were incubated with the IC 50 concentration for Ara-C. Regardless of the exposure time, combining Ara-C with 131 (10 \u03bcM) does not enhance the cell killing, which suggested that both Ara-C and 131 act on the same mechanistic pathway <02MIP392>. The observed inhibition of both RNA and DNA synthesis by REN 131 pointed to some intriguing possibilities for its mechanism of action including, but not limited to, (a) it could be phosphorylated in vivo by kinases to its 5'-triphosphate derivative, and subsequently incorporated into nucleic acids during transcription of a DNA/RNA template by a polymerase, and cause double-helical distortion, ultimately leading to chain termination, (b) 131 could bind to an active or allosteric site of the polymerase, either as a nucleoside or nucleotide, and cause competitive or non-competitive inhibition. In order to throw more light on the above subject, we chemically converted 100 (the reactive species of 131 in vivo) to its 5'-triphosphate derivative 137 (Scheme 27), and biochemically screened for inhibition of nucleic acid polymerase activity, employing synthetic DNA oligonucleotide templates and the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase as a representative Polymerase <99BMC2931; 99NN837>. Our results suggest that 137 is a moderate inhibitor of T7 RNA polymerase, and that the 5'-triphosphate moiety of 137 appears to be essential for inhibition as nucleoside 100 alone failed to inhibit the polymerase reaction <99BMC2931>. Our mechanistic explorations in the viral field largely focused on Flaviviridae, including HCV, WNV, and JEV. We have discovered that the mechanism of action of this family of viruses involves inhibition of viral NTPase/helicase <03JMC4149; 03JMC4776>. Helicases are responsible for unwinding duplex RNA and DNA structures by disrupting the hydrogen bonds that keep the two strands together <88NAT22; 98STR89>. This process is dependent upon the necessary energy released by hydrolysis of a molecule of nucleoside-5'-triphosphate (NTP) such as ATP or GTP <98JV6758>. Our studies pointed to the existence of an allosteric binding site on the viral NTPases/helicases that can be occupied by nucleoside/nucleotide-type molecules such as RENs and inhibit the viral helicase activity <03JMC4149; 03JMC4776>. We also found that at low ATP concentrations, the REN-5'-triphosphates bind to the enzyme's NTP binding site and competitively inhibit the viral NTPase activity <03JMC4149; 03JMC4776>. For example, at an ATP concentration equal to 1 x 10 -5 K M value of the enzyme, the REN-triphosphate 137 inhibited the WNV NTPase reaction with an IC 50 value of 0.15 \u03bcM <03JMC4149; 03JMC4776>.

The most active REN 121 inhibited the synthesis of intracellular HBV replication intermediates and extracellular virion release with 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) of 0.604 and 0.131\u03bcM, respectively, with selectivity indices of >18,500 and >4000, respectively <02AR159>. The toxicity of all three compounds was also measured in rapidly growing human foreskin fibroblast (HFF) cells and Daudi cells by cell proliferation assay. Once again, negligible or no toxicity was observed in both cells <02AR159>. It was also interesting to note that all three RENs, unlike the industrial standard 3TC (2',3'-dideoxy-L-3'-thiacytidine) used for anti-HBV activity, resulted in the reduction of viral protein synthesis, especially that of the core antigen <02AR159>.",
