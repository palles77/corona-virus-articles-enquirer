This is primarily due to limitations of diagnostic testing modalities: blood cultures, antigen testing and antibody titers, and the need for invasive means to retrieve specimens. 1,4 Two studies illustrate our limited ability to diagnose the etiology of pneumonia in children. In a prospective study of 168 ambulatory children with CAP, an etiologic agent was identifi ed in only 43% of cases. 5 These included Streptococcus pneumoniae (27%), Mycoplasma pneumoniae (7%) and Chlamydia pneumoniae (6%). Patients with S. pneumoniae frequently had a mixed infection (40%). Of 157 patients tested for viral infection, 20% were positive by culture and/or direct fl uorescent antibody test. Viral etiologies identifi ed included respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), infl uenza viruses A and B, parainfl uenza viruses 1 and 3, adenovirus, enterovirus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes simplex virus. All viral isolates were identifi ed in children less than 8 years of age. 5 A similar study, in 254 hospitalized children with CAP, identifi ed a potential causative agent in 85% of cases. 6 Extensive diagnostic testing accounted for the relatively high yield in this study. Similar etiologies identifi ed, in decreasing frequency of occurrence, included S. pneumoniae, Haemophilus infl uenzae, M. pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, C. pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Chlamydia trachomatis. Viral etiologies included (most common to least common) RSV, rhinovirus, parainfl uenza viruses 1 through 3, adenovirus, infl uenza virus A and B, coronavirus, human herpesvirus 6, Epstein-Barr virus, and varicella-zoster virus. Mixed viralbacterial infections were detected in 30% of patients, and 41% of patients had more than one microbiologic agent identifi ed. Of interest, of 93 patients with S. pneumoniae, only one had a positive blood culture. The remaining 92 patients were diagnosed based solely on serologic evidence. 6 A prospective analysis seeking to identify etiologic agents via a pneumolysin-based polymerase chain reaction assay identifi ed a respiratory pathogen in 79% of 154 pediatric patients with lower respiratory tract infection. The most common etiologic agent was S. pneumoniae (44%). Of 68 patients with S. pneumoniae infection, 18% had a coinfection with another bacteria and 31% had a co-infection with a virus. Atypical agents (M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae) accounted for 22% of all infections (14% and 9%, respectively). The most common viral etiologies included",

Acute respiratory illnesses are responsible for more than 5 million fatalities each year in children less than 5 years of age in developing countries. The annual incidence in children less than age 5 is approximately 35 to 40 cases per 1000 in Europe and North America. 1 The mortality rate from pneumonia in children in the United States has declined by 97% from 1939 to 1996. 2 This decline is primarily attributable to the introduction of penicillin in the 1940s. Availability of the measles vaccine and improved access to medical care for poor children, primarily as a result of the Medicaid program, have contributed to further reduction in mortality rates recorded from 1963 to 1985. The rate of pneumonia remains high in developing countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported a global annual incidence of clinical pneumonia in children less than 5 years of age estimated to be 146.5 million new cases in developing countries and 2.1 million new cases in developed countries. 3 The defi nition of clinical pneumonia for the purpose of the WHO estimates encompasses pneumonia, bronchiolitis, and reactive airways disease associated with respiratory infections. 456",

To aid management decisions, common patterns of infectious agents exist that help to guide diagnosis and therapy. Age is the most helpful marker for the cause of pediatric pneumonia. When considering age as a factor, S. pneumoniae remains the most common agent for all ages, and is reported as a causative agent in 15% to 35% of all childhood pneumonias. The atypical agents M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae are less common in children less than 5 years of age (<10%) and occur in increasing proportions in adolescents, reported as high as 50% in some studies. Viral etiologies, most commonly RSV, adenovirus, and infl uenza viruses A and B, are most common in infants and children less than 2 years of age (30%). The incidence of viral infection reduces dramatically with age. 1,4, 10 Other factors that aid in identifying the etiology of pneumonia include season and vaccine status. Viral infections, specifi cally RSV and infl uenza virus, peak in late fall and winter, though there is little seasonal infl uence on bacterial causes. Immunization status is also a helpful indicator of disease potential. Infl uenza infection is less likely if a child has received the infl uenza vaccine during the same season. Haemophilus infl uenzae type B vaccination eliminates the potential for this infection in children. The conjugated pneumococcal vaccine imparts partial protection from this pathogen as the causative agent. 4,10",

            "text": "Children with pneumonia present with a variety of clinical fi ndings. Early fi ndings are varied, and most cases present initially with symptoms of an upper respiratory infection. These may include low-grade fevers and rhinorrhea. Intermediate and late fi ndings include fever, tachypnea, and cough. Several studies have sought to identify pneumonia based solely on clinical fi ndings. These studies defi ne the \"gold standard\" for pneumonia diagnosis as the chest radiograph. 11,12 Tachypnea was defi ned based on the WHO defi nition, as follows: in children less than 2 months old, respiratory rate (RR) greater than 60 breaths/min; in children 2 to 12 months old, RR greater than 50 breaths/min; and children older than 12 months, RR greater than 40 breaths/min. 13, 14 In 1997, a Canadian task force developed an evidence-based guideline to diagnose pneumonia in children. This guideline states that, although no single clinical fi nding may accurately diagnose pneumonia, the absence of a cluster of signs, specifi cally respiratory distress, tachypnea, crackles, and decreased breath sounds, excludes the presence of pneumonia with a sensitivity of 100%. 1 These fi ndings were applied to a cohort of 319 children who had a chest radiograph for possible pneumonia, 20% of whom had radiologic fi ndings consistent with pneumonia. The Canadian guideline had a 45% sensitivity and 66% specifi city for the diagnosis of pneumonia when applied to this patient cohort. Additionally, tachypnea was only 10% sensitive and 5% specifi c in this study. 15 Despite these fi ndings, several other studies have identifi ed tachypnea as the best clinical indicator. A report on 572 children less than 2 years old, 7% with radiologic signs of pneumonia, defi ned tachypnea as having a 74% sensitivity and 76% specifi city to identify pneumonia. 16 In a trial comparing clinical data to chest radiographs in 110 children, of 59 patients diagnosed with pneumonia, 35 had positive fi ndings on chest radiograph. Of all clinical fi ndings, the sensitivity to diagnose pneumonia was best for tachypnea (74%; specifi city 67%), followed by retractions (71%) and rales (46%). Combinations of these improved specifi city slightly, but did not improve sensitivity to recognize pneumonia. When the cohort was stratifi ed by age, tachypnea was most sensitive: 83% in the youngest infants (<6 months old). 17 In a prospective study examining RR cutoffs for pediatric patients hospitalized with pneumonia, a RR greater than 57 in infants 2 to 11 months old, a RR greater than 48 in children 1 to 5 years old, and a RR greater than 36 in children more than 5 years old identifi ed severe pneumonia requiring hospitalization. 18 These fi ndings closely parallel the WHO defi nitions for tachypnea.",

[25] [26] [27] A systematic literature review of fi ve studies examined this relationship and reported a low sensitivity and specifi city of chest radiography in the identifi cation of a bacterial etiology. 28 These studies are limited since there is no reliable reference standard. As mentioned previously, identifying the microbiologic etiology of childhood pneumonia is diffi cult, and therefore it is problematic to assess the diagnostic capability of a radiograph related to the microbiologic etiology; as a result, the test accuracy estimate of the radiograph may be falsely low. 28 A prospective report examined the infl uence of laboratory tests, specifi cally the WBC count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and serum CRP, in combination with the radiograph to aid in diagnostic capability. 29 In 254 children admitted to the hospital with pneumonia, a bacterial etiology was identifi ed in 53%. Of these, 72% had an alveolar infi ltrate (most commonly lobar) compared to 49% of patients with a viral infection. There was no difference between etiologies in patients with an interstitial infi ltrate; 50% identifi ed a bacterial etiology. Though there remains a fair amount of overlap, this study supports the fi nding that a lobar alveolar pattern is more likely to represent a bacterial etiology while an interstitial pattern does not differentiate between viral and bacterial infections. An elevated CRP (>80 mg/dl) suggested a bacterial cause (72% sensitivity and 52%specifi city); however, laboratory fi ndings did not signifi cantly enhance the sensitivity of the radiograph in identifying a cause for pneumonia. 29 Radiographic fi ndings of focal consolidation suggest a bacterial etiology for pneumonia, although an atypical pneumonia (Mycoplasma) may also be represented, illustrating the lack of specifi city to differentiate cause by radiograph fi ndings alone. This overlap is exemplifi ed when looking at a diffuse interstitial pattern. Given the proper clinical setting, atelectasis due to reactive airways disease may be indistinguishable from a viral or atypical process manifesting as a diffuse interstitial pattern. A unique fi nding that strongly supports a bacterial etiology is a \"round pneumonia,\" which appears as a circular lesion in the retrocardiac area. A round pneumonia is most commonly caused by S. pneumoniae in children. Other possible infections include H. infl uenzae, M. tuberculosis, and Klebsiella. In the case of occult pneumonia in febrile children with leukocytosis, 22 round pneumonia is often discovered, despite few clinical respiratory fi ndings.",

As reported previously, wheezing is unlikely in patients with typical bacterial infections; however, atypical causes such as M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae should be considered. Foreign bodies may also mimic pneumonia; however, a high suspicion for aspiration or history of choking, unilateral hyperaeration, or asymmetric breath sounds may suggest the need for further investigation. 35 The risk of bacteremia remains a consideration in children with pneumonia.

            "text": "In children who are moderately ill and/or have a presumed bacterial source of infection, antibiotics may be initiated. Since the causative pathogen is rarely known, and radiologic features do not distinguish etiology, the choice of antibiotics is based on established patterns of infection related to age and clinical fi ndings. Several studies have found little difference in outcome when comparing different treatment modalities. One study of 88 children less than 5 years of age with pneumonia compared treatment with azithromycin and amoxicillin-clavulanate and found no difference in effectiveness. The same study compared treatment with azithromycin to erythromycin estolate in 59 children older than 5 years with pneumonia and also found no difference in outcome. Four children failed treatment, but there was no difference in failure rates among the different antibiotic regimens. Adverse events were recorded in 67% of patients who received amoxicillinclavulanate, 25% who received erythromycin, and in 14% who received azithromycin. The most common adverse events were diarrhea and rash. 5 Another study supports the use of azithromycin for pediatric bacterial pneumonia, both classic and atypical patterns. 45 Oral azithromycin is found to be well tolerated with very few treatment-related adverse events. 46, 47 The choice of an antibiotic regimen is guided by age, severity of illness, and likelihood of a bacterial pathogen (Table  58-1) . 1,5,37,39,48,49 Parenteral therapy is indicated for children who require hospitalization and who are unable to tolerate oral medication. In these cases, ampicillin or a secondgeneration cephalosporin (e.g., cefuroxime) is recommended. In hospitalized children 5 years and older, the addition of an oral macrolide is recommended. Replacement by an appropriate oral agent may be initiated after 2 to 4 days of clinical improvement, with resolution of fever and the ability to tolerate oral medication. 1 Since empirical antibiotic therapy is so commonly initiated, the role for extensive microbiologic testing is of questionable value. In a prospective study of 153 hospitalized children with acquired pneumonia, only 9% had fever lasting more than 48 hours after onset of antibiotic treatment. Of these, most had RSV and H. infl uenzae infection, with more than half identifi ed as mixed viral-bacterial etiologies. At follow-up, 94% of all patients showed no pneumonia-related symptoms. There is no role for expensive microbiologic testing in otherwise healthy children with CAP since most make a rapid, uneventful recovery after a brief hospital stay and short course of antibiotics, regardless of etiology. 50 The heptavalent pneumococcal vaccine was introduced in 2000, and showed 97% effectiveness in reducing invasive pneumococcal disease in children less than 5 years of age based on results from the Kaiser Permanente effectiveness trial of over 36,000 children. 51 Utilizing the same patient database, the overall incidence of positive radiographic pneumococcal pneumonia in children was reported to be reduced by 18% in immunized children, with a 32% reduction in children less than 1 year of age and a 23% reduction in children less than 2 years of age. There was no difference in children older than 2 years of age. 52 Children with the following clinical signs and symptoms should be considered for hospital admission regardless of the decision to initiate antibiotic therapy as they may require more intensive monitoring 1 : age less than 6 months, toxic appearance, severe respiratory distress, need for supplemental oxygen, dehydration, vomiting, no response to appropriate oral antimicrobial therapy, immunocompromised status, noncompliant caregiver, and presence of bilobar pneumonia.",
