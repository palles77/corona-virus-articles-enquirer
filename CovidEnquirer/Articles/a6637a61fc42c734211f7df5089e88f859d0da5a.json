Moreover, certain persistent viral infections have been implicated in tumorigenesis, like cervical carcinoma caused by human papillomavirus [5] or nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) and Burkitt's lymphoma by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [6, 7] . Viral infection displays strict species and cell type specificity, a definition called viral tropism [8] , which is crucial in determining the manifestation and outcome of viral infection [9] [10] [11] . However, not rare but quite often, viruses gain the ability to infect non-susceptible cells, as shown by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of the genital and gastrointestinal cells [12, 13] , making the clinical prophylaxis and therapy more complex. Therefore, studies on the mechanisms of virus tropism are critical for developing alternative anti-virus strategies [14, 15] .",

EBV infection of B lymphocytes is a typical receptor-mediated process and represents a mechanism for the establishment of longterm latency in the host [17, 18] . Such susceptibility is believed to be conferred by an interaction between the viral envelope glycoprotein gp350/220 [19] and the complement receptor 2 (CR2)/CD21, the primary receptor for EBV on B cells [20, 21] . Receptor-mediated internalization of EBV requires the interaction of another viral envelope glycoprotein gp42 with HLA class II molecules on B cells, which thereafter initiates the fusion process involving the core fusion complex, gH/gL/gp42 [22, 23] . This receptor-mediated process is cell type specific, making viral receptors on host cells therapeutic targets [24] [25] [26] .",

In contrast to B cells, ECs express the viral receptor CR2/CD21 at very low levels and do not constitutively express HLA class II molecules [29] . Therefore, the infection of ECs in vitro by cell-free EBV virions is not as efficient as that of B cells. Nevertheless, ECs can be efficiently infected through co-culturing with Akata cells (an EBV-producing B lymphoblastoid cell line), which is thought to be mediated by a mechanism termed cell-to-cell infection [30] . This process involves EBV binding to B cells through CR2/CD21, activation of adhesion molecules and the subsequent entry of EBV into ECs [31, 32] . Such an intercellular conjugation requires the interaction between CD11b on EBV-loaded B cells and the heparin moiety of CD44v3 and LEEP-CMA on the basolateral surface of ECs [32] . Interestingly, cell-to-cell infection rates vary among different types of target cells, ranging from 0% to 25% [30, 31] . More recently, it was reported that cell-to-cell transmission was efficient in mediating EBV infection of raft cultures generated from primary human keratinocytes in vitro, resulting in productive viral replication in organotypic cultures and the release of viral particles to intercellular space [33] . Of note, cell-to-cell infection is not unique to EBV. It also accounts for the efficient transmission of HIV between susceptible CD4 + T cells [34, 35] , representing a mechanism for resistance to anti-viral therapy and subsequent viral persistence [36, 37] .",

We recently reported the existence of unique cell-in-cell structures in clinical cancer specimens, in which lymphocytes penetrated both malignant and normal ECs [38] . Cell-in-cell structure was noted over 100 years ago and has recently aroused great interest due to its potential pathophysiological significance [39, 40] . Cell-in-cell structures can occur either homotypically or heterotypically. Heterotypic cell-in-cell structures, formed by the invasion of lymphocytes into tumor cells of epithelial origin, were found to occur more prevalently than homotypic structures both in vitro and in vivo [38] . The fates of the invading cells and host cells in cell-in-cell structures are diverse [41] [42] [43] . Most often the invading lymphocytes die by entosis or emperitosis [44] . Entosis is a lysosome-dependent cell death and involves the activation of the Rho/Rock signal pathway [45] . Emperitosis is a caspase 3-dependent apoptotic process [40] . Only immune cells with cytotoxicity undergo emperitosis. Non-cytotoxic cells, like B cells, undergo entosis. Penetration of lymphocytes into ECs in specimens from patients with NPC [46] and in liver sections of mouse hepatitis models [38] has been previously reported. However, it is not clear whether the formation of the cell-in-cell structures between ECs and lymphocytes infected by certain viruses such as EBV or HIV plays certain roles in mediating virus transmission to non-susceptible ECs.",

These new findings suggest that cell-in-cell infection, in addition to cell-tocell infection, plays a role in transmitting viruses from host cells to non-susceptible ECs. Interestingly, EBV viral particles produced via the cell-in-cell process possessed broader tropism and enhanced infectivity. Therefore, cell-in-cell infection may represent a novel pathway for EBV transmission to non-susceptible ECs, a process npg www.cell-research.com | Cell Research we term as \"in-cell infection\".",

In a typical cell-in-cell structure, one lymphocyte (indicated by the white arrow) inside one host EC was surrounded by vacuole membrane and the deformed nucleus (indicated by \"N\") of the host cell ( Figure 1F ). The internalized lymphocyte underwent cell death inside the vacuole with deformed nucleus and scattered nucleolus, similar to the fate of most effector cells inside host cells [38] .

EBV-eGFP Akata cells were derived from EBV \u2212 AK31 cell line that was latently infected with recombinant EBV containing an eGFP gene and a neomycin-resistant gene. eGFP gene was inserted into the viral BXLF1 open reading frame to monitor the activation of EBV and the infection of ECs [47] . This cell line was referred to as GFP-Akata cells afterward. Consistent with the observations in clinical samples described above, both GFP-Akata cells and parent AK31 cells formed heterotypic cellin-cell structures with CNE-2 cells after the co-culture in vitro. Remarkably, GFP-Akata cells formed cell-in-cell structures in higher frequency compared with uninfected parent AK31 cells in parallel (Supplementary information, Figure S1A ). To determine whether GFP-Akata cells could transfer EBV to CNE-2 cells through the cell-in-cell mechanism, we used time-lapse microscope to track the invading processes of GFP-Akata cells into CNE-2 cells. We observed the gradual increase of green fluorescence in the internalized GFP-Akata cell 6 h after the initiation of co-culture, indicating the activation of EBV. The GFP intensity and the percentage of internalized GFP + Akata cells continued to increase until 10 h ( Figure 2A ). However, free GFP-Akata cells maintained the similar GFP positivity during co-culture (data not shown). Internalized GFP-Akata cells appeared intact during the observation period ( Figure 2A ). We individually tracked 135 cell-in-cell structures with GFP \u2212 GFP-Akata cells at the beginning of the observation for 12 h. Fifteen internalized cells turned green over the interval ( Figure 2B ). Among them, three went out of host cells intactly ( Figure 2B and Supplementary information, Figure S1C ). Most internalized GFP-Akata cells displayed characteristics of entotic cell death (lysotracker positive and caspase-3 negative; Supplementary information, Figure S1B ). No green fluorescence was observed in CNE-2 cells without cell-in-cell structures. By 12 h, GFP-Akata cells expressing GFP also co-expressed ZEBRA protein, which is encoded by viral lytic replication gene BZLF1 ( Figure 2C ), indicating the productive replication of viral genome in the invading GFP-Akata cells. Considering that the appearance of GFP is the reporter for EBV activation, the EBV activation process in cell-in-cell structures likely depends neither on the conventional activation signals such as IgG ligation in EBV-infected B cells [49] nor on cell-cell contact-dependent activation [50] .",

To ensure that EBV can be transmitted to CNE-2 cells through cellin-cell structure formation, GFP-Akata and CNE-2 cells were labeled with CellTracker Green and CellTracker Red dyes, respectively, and co-cultured for 4 h. Double-labeled cells (with the formation of cell-in-cell structures) were sorted by flow cytometry and further selected with G418 for EBV-eGFP-transferred CNE-2 cells with the advantage of neomycin-resistant gene in GFP-Akata cells. Seven days later, 75% of the sorted CNE-2 cells highly expressed GFP compared with the original CNE-2 cells infected with cell-free virus (< 0.1%). We also probed EBV-specfic EBER to localize EBV in the sorted CNE-2 cells with cell-in-cell structures. EBV was located in the nucleus of the CNE-2 cell ( Figure 2E ). We further examined the expression of key viral genes and proteins, such as EBNA1 (a gene marker for the latency), BALF5 (a gene expressing DNA polymerase, a lytic protein) and viral transcriptional regulatory gene BZLF1 (an indicator for lysis induction) of EBV [51] , in the sorted CNE-2 cells. As revealed by RT-PCR ( Figure 2F ) and western blotting assays (Supplementary information, Figure S2B ), EBNA1, BALF5 and BZLF1 mRNAs were expressed in the sorted CNE-2 cells with the similar patterns to those of GFP-Akata cells, but not detected in original CNE-2 cells. The accumulation of EBV virions in CNE-2 cells was also detected by TEM ( Figure 2G ). EBV-like virions were readily observed in the cytoplasm of CNE-2 cells with cell-in-cell structures. The size of the virions was ~180 nm. Most virions contained envelopped capsids ( Figure 2G , yellow circle).",

However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the cell-to-cell mechanism also contributes to the transmission of EBV to ECs during co-culture. Therefore, we compared the cell-in-cell-mediated pathway with conventional cell-to-cell-mediated pathway. According to the previously reported cell-to-cell transmission experiments [50] , GFP-Akata cells were co-cultured with CNE-2 cells at 5:1 ratio for 24 h in the presence or absence of goat anti-human IgG polyclonal antibody. Treatment of anti-IgG induced the entry of the viral lytic cycle in GFP-Akata cells. The non-adherent GFP-Akata cells were removed. Fresh medium was added and cells were cultured for another 24 h. We measured the frequencies of GFP + CNE-2 cells free in the culture and with cell-in-cell structures, which reprensent the cellto-cell and cell-in-cell transmission, respectively. The precentage of free GFP + CNE-2 cells ranged from 0% to 1% with the average of 0.67% in total free CNE-2 cells. Upon the treatment of anti-IgG, the infection rate slightly increased to 0.81%. However, almost 6% of CNE-2 cells with cell-in-cell structures became infected (as evidenced by the appreance of GFP fluorescence) within 48 h regardless of the anti-IgG treatment ( Figure 2H ). These results suggest that cell-in-cell-mediated EBV transmission to non-susceptible ECs in our experiments occurred independently of cell-to-cell contact.",

After stimulation for 3 days, culture supernatants containing EBV virions were collected. To distinguish EBV virions derived from these two types of cells, A-EBV and C-EBV were named for EBVs from GFP-Akata and iCNE-2 cells, respectively. By using the same amount of virions normalized by quantitative PCR, we first performed the cellfree infection assay in susceptible AK31 and non-susceptible CNE-2 cells to compare the infectivity between A-EBV and C-EBV. A-EBV maintained the capacity to infect AK31 cells at the percentage of ~10% but could not infect CNE-2 cells ( Figure 3A left and right, blue line for A-EBV infection). Surprisingly, based on the expression of GFP fluorescence, we found that C-EBV from iCNE-2 cells infected both AK31 ( Figure 3A , left, red line, 10.1%) and CNE-2 cells ( Figure 3A , right, red line, 14.8%). It is well established that deficiency of EBV receptor such as CD21 molecules on ECs is the main obstacle for their susceptibility to cell-free EBV infection [19] . However, the extra ability of C-EBV to infect CNE-2 cells suggests that CNE-2 cells infected via in-cell infection are able to assemble virions with an extra capacity to infect non-susceptible ECs. This was confirmed when we further compared the capacity of A-EBV and C-EBV to infect other lymphocytes or EC-derived cell lines ( Figure 3B ). While A-EBV only infected B cell line AK31, C-EBV infected both lymphocytes (AK31) and EC cell lines (i.e., CNE-2, A431, MCF-7, PLC/PRF/5 and an immortalized epithelial cell line NPEC1-Bmi1) [53] .",

A-EBV and C-EBV were incubated with both AK31 and CNE-2 cells for 2 h on ice, the supernatants were collected and fresh media were added to the cells.

A-EBV did not infect CNE-2 cells. No GFP + CNE-2 cells were detected after the incubation with A-EBV. Unbound A-EBV from the CNE-2 cell absorption assay could continue to infect AK31 cells with an infection rate (8%-12%) comparable to that of original A-EBV (10%-15%; Figure 3C ).

In addition, C-EBV infected CNE-2 cells with 5%-10% infection rate, much higher than that of A-EBV (< 0.1%). Interestingly, unbound C-EBV collected from the AK31 absorption assay could infect both AK31 and CNE-2 cells with similar infection rates, like the unbound C-EBV from CNE-2 cell supernatants ( Figure 3D ).",

            "text": "Activation of EBV in infected B cells by anti-IgG treatment has been well documented [49] . B-cell receptor (BCR) ligation triggers the activation of the Src tyrosine kinase Lyn and the downstream PI3K/AKT signaling pathway. This activates the transcription of BZLF1, which is a switch for EBV activation from latent status. In turn, BZLF1-encoding protein ZEBRA initiates the replication of virus [54] . We found that EBV in GFP-Akata cells was activated autonomously inside host CNE-2 cells in the absence of extrinsic stimuli. It is evident that the PI3K/AKT pathway is key to EBV activation in both cell-free and cell-to-cell contact infections [50, 55] . We then asked whether the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway was turned on during the autonomous EBV activation after cell-in-cell structure formation. We detected the phosphorylation of AKT Ser473 in GFP-Akata cells with cell-in-cell structures. By 12 h, the GFP fluorescence was co-localized with phosphorylated AKT in GFP-Akata cells, but was not detected in CNE-2 cells ( Figure 5A) . Similarly, no phosphorylation of AKT was observed in AK31 cells when they entered CNE-2 cells during the same observation time (Supplementary information, Figure S4 ). Our results were in accordance with the report [55] that EBV immediate-early protein BRLF1 could induce the activation of PI3K/AKT and the subsequent viral activation. This suggests the involvement of the PI3K/ AKT signaling in EBV activation within GFP-Akata cells during in-cell infection. When the co-culture continued, the level of phosphorylated AKT increased in GFP + GFP-Akata cells inside CNE-2 cells ( Figure 5B ). To further demonstrate the role of the PI3K/AKT signaling in EBV activation, the broad-spectrum PI3K signaling inhibitor, Wortmannin, was added after GFP-Akata cells were co-cultured with CNE-2 cells for 2 or 4 h. After another 24 h co-culture, GFP signal and AKT phosphorylation were measured in cell-in-cell structures. As shown in Figure 5C , Wortmannin dramatically inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT inside GFP-Akata cells ( Figure  5C , left). In parallel, GFP expression in GFP-Akata cells inside CNE-2 cells also decreased dramatically ( Figure   5C , right). We obtained the similar results when we used another PI3K inhibitor LY296002 (data not shown). These results suggest that the PI3K/AKT signaling is involved in EBV activation within B cells after cell-in-cell structure formation.",

However, certain alternative infection mechanisms have been reported [30] . During EBV infection, it is well accepted that due to the lack of EBV receptors on ECs, cell-tocell infection is the main pathway for EBV infection rather than receptor-mediated cell-free infection [31, 32] . During cell-to-cell infection, the transmission of EBV from B cells to ECs relies on the conjugate formation between B cells and ECs, which facilitates the entry of viruses into ECs through either membrane fusion or endocytosis [32] . Compared with cell-to-cell infection, in-cell infection undergoes an alternative infection pathway in which its tropism rarely relies on the interaction between host cells and virus and the transmission occurs more rapidly and efficiently. It has been reported that successful cell-to-cell infection of EBV happened after 24 h [50] . However, in-cell infection initiated within 4 h with the rapid formation of cell-in-cell structures. EBV was subsequently activated by 6 h (Figure 2B and Supplementary information, Figure S1C ) and the activation was sustained. With the occurrence of lysosome-dependent cellin-cell death (entosis) of the internalized EBV-infected GFP-Akata B cells (Supplementary information, Figure  S1B ), EBV was released into host ECs to accomplish the transmission of viruses. This is in accordance with the observation that the expression of GFP, phosphorylation of AKT Ser473 and entosis of GFP-Akata cells occurred in parallel. Unlike the cell-to-cell spread of EBV to polarized oral ECs, which requires the conjugation between CD11b on B cells and heparan sulphate moieties of CD44v3 and LEEP-CAM on ECs [32] , the successful in-cell infection is expected to depend on molecules involved in cell-in-cell structure formation such as ezrin or npg www.cell-research.com | Cell Research ICAM-1 [41, 45] . The exact molecules participating in initiating in-cell infection need to be experimentally verified.",

            "text": "Another interesting issue of in-cell infection is the triggering factor for the EBV activation inside host cells independent of the extrinsic stimuli. It is widely accepted that EBV activation is the prerequisite for the viral infection of ECs either by cell-free virions or through cell-tocell contact [30, 50] . The molecular mechanism of EBV activation in infected B cells upon anti-IgG treatment has been well illustrated [49] . BCR ligation triggers the activation of the Src tyrosine kinase Lyn and the downstream PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which promotes the transcription of BZLF1 and BRLF1 and subsequently initiates the replication of virus [54, 55] . The PI3K/AKT pathway has been reported to play crucial roles in cellto-cell EBV transfer as well [50] . We have also demonstrated the phosphorylation of AKT at the early stage after cell-in-cell structure formation with the appearance of GFP signals. This suggests the involvement of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway in the activation of EBV in GFP-Akata cells inside CNE-2 cells. We thus propose that when internalized EBV-infected B cells are wrapped in the vacuole of host cells, certain factors inside the specific microenvironment of the vacuole might dedicate to the activation of EBV. We also found that the activation of AKT occurred simultaneously with the initiation of cell-in-cell entotic death (data not shown). The activation of EBV and the occurrence of entotic death of B cells inside CNE-2 cells thus constitute two prerequisites for the efficient transmission of EBV from internalized GFP-Akata cells to CNE-2 cells. The significance of ligation-independent EBV activation is that the latency of EBV can be rapidly interrupted when EBV-burdened B cells are internalized into ECs. This process might be related to the intrinsic maintenance of long-term persistent infection.",

During in-cell infection, EBV is activated in tropic B cells and released to ECs after entotic death of B cells inside ECs (Supplementary information, Figure S1B ). With the entotic death of B cells, in-cell infected ECs thus possess the cellular components of both B cells and ECs. The cells might assemble EBV virion particles in alternative manners with extended viral tropism and higher efficacy. Another possibility lies in the genetic and epigenetic alterations of EBV after incell infection. This is consistent with the \"cell-in-cell selection\" model that we suggested before [39] , in which the internalized cells adapt to the internal microenvironment to package EBV in a separate process.

The cell-in-cell pathway not only mediates the infection of ECs but also provides virus-bearing tropic cells inside ECs with a shelter to escape from immune attack. A few reports have described the presence of virions in oropharyngeal or nasopharyngeal epithelium [16, 57] and the phenomena of latent or replicating EBV in intro-epithelial B cells [46] . However, the exact mechanisms are unclear. According to our study, heterotypic cell-in-cell structure formation in vitro between EBV-infected B cells and ECs to some extent recapitulates the interaction between infiltrating lymphocytes and tissue cells during persistent infection. Our findings thus favor the view that ECs undergoing EBV in-cell infection might be a more stable virus pool in vivo to maintain the latency of EBV owing to the high incidence of heterotypic cell-in-cell structure formation in local inflammatory region. In addition, heterotypic cell-in-cell structure formation between B cells and ECs might also induce the chromosome instability and formation of aneuploidy, which has been reported during the formation of homotypic cell-in-cell structures [58] . To our opinion, in-cell infection-mediated EBV persistency and heterotypic cell-in-cell structure formation-mediated aneuploidy perform the \"double shocks\", which may accelerate the transformation of normal ECs and the subsequent nasopharyngeal carcinogenesis.",

            "text": "In recent years, the cell-in-cell structure has aroused broad concerns as increasing evidence has supported its roles in development [59, 60] , homeostasis [61] , aging [62, 63] , malignant transformation [64] and tumorigenesis [58] across a wide range of species (encompassing lower eukaryotes and mammals), exhibiting pathophysiological significance. More recently, the cell-in-cell structure formation is demonstrated to be able to promote clonal selection and human tumor evolution mediated by cell competition, a mechanism evolved to eliminate less fit cells from a heterogeneous cell population [65, 66] . In this study, we have demonstrated its involvement in EBV viral infection of non-susceptible ECs through the invasion of B cells into ECs. This will be helpful to explain the observation of the presence of HIV in intestinal and genital ECs in AIDS patients, which has been extensively debated. Considering the diversity of virus-infected cells such as B or T cells and their engagement in cellin-cell structures during chronic infection, in-cell infection might represent a general receptor-independent mechanism of viral infections of non-susceptible tissue cells. The cell-in-cell structure formation might thus participate in the pathogenesis of viral infection through its unique biological behavior. Further investigations on its molecular mechanisms will undoubtedly provide new clues and targets for the prevention and treatment of viral infections in clinic.",
