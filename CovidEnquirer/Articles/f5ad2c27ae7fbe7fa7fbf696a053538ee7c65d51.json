In a relatively short period of time, the life sciences have evolved from a simple cataloguing exercise of the diver sity of nature to a position in which researchers are adding to that diversity through the construction of modified and potentially novel life-forms. The vast majority of this activity has had a positive impact on the quality of life of at least some of the human race. Indeed, the past 150 years have seen major advances in the fields of micro biology and biochemistry, and these have been followed by the emergence of the disciplines of immunology, molecular biology, and genetics. In practical terms, this has resulted in the introduction of sewers and clean water, the development of antibiotics and vaccines capable of eliminating infectious diseases such as smallpox, and the ability to create genetically modified organisms able to synthesize production-scale quantities of human hor mones such as insulin.",

This is primarily due to the constraints imposed on them by their parent organizations, but it also flows from a lack of understand ing of science among the media industry generally, and particularly the popular press, which often results in incomplete and inaccurate reporting. As a consequence, this perceived lack of openness has created an atmosphere of suspicion in which conspiracy theorists, the media, and Hollywood thrive, routinely conjuring up lurid images of evil scientists working on government-funded Frankenstein projects to destroy the world.

There were no fatalities in New Zealand (only two people were admitted to hospital in the immediate aftermath), and there have been no epidemics, despite disruption of sewage and water supply systems. This contrasts with a high initial death toll (230 000), many injuries (300 000), catastrophic disruption of Haitian society (1 million people made homeless), and an epi demic of cholera in the displaced population. Aspects of a society that determine its resilience to major disasters include the general health and education of its popula tion, its technological infrastructure, the state of readiness of its societal organization to respond to the event con cerned, and its political and governance structures.

In contrast, a rare but severe treatable infection such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus may cause much consternation in the media but actually inflict a much smaller overall burden on society.

The 2001 anthrax letters episode in the United States was an exam ple of a major response to a relatively small overall disease burden (20 infected and 5 deaths in a country of 311 million people), but it demonstrates the fact that a society's response to an unexpected human-originated event may have a much greater impact on the society than the event itself.

Fortunately, escape of infectious material from laboratories is very rare; examples include a small pox outbreak in Birmingham in 1978 and the foot-and mouth disease outbreak associated with faulty drainage at the animal health facility at Pirbright in 2007. The root cause of such accidental releases was a breakdown in containment (the physical control measures put in place to prevent microorganisms escaping to the environment). In fact, containment technology and practices have improved dramatically during the past 50 years, with significant improvements often being identified by analy sis of accidents or near-misses. At the Porton Down site, which houses both Ministry of Defence and Department of Health microbiological containment laboratories, there have been only two cases of laboratory-acquired infec tion; these occurred in the 1960s and both were the basis for considerable improvements in procedures. In the United Kingdom, there have been no known deliberate releases of biological material. There have been deliber ate releases of infectious material in other countries -the rarity of such events has probably contributed to their celebrity status.",

It is safe to say that whatever they are doing, it is not having the desired effect. Part of this failure is due to the inability or reluctance of practicing scientists to engage with the media in such a way as to convey their story in a form that is understandable by their fellow citizens. A survey com missioned and funded by the Wellcome Trust found that the majority of scientists believed that the public saw them as detached, poor at public relations, secretive, and uncommunicative. Furthermore, they identified a lack of knowledge and/or interest in science within the general public as a major barrier to communicating concepts and ideas. Most of those questioned believed that they were insufficiently trained to deal with the media; more impor tantly, the majority of scientists surveyed distrust the role of the mass media in communication of their results.",

In that light, it is not surprising that there is a tendency to focus on stories and issues that seize public attention. All journalists know that scares make good stories and fre quently generate a momentum of their own that does not require any facts to keep them moving forward. For example, in recent years we have seen the emergence of numerous scare stories in the media (flesh-eating bacteria, falling sperm counts, chlorofluorocarbons, bovine spongi form encephalopathy, harmful GM foods, etc.), many with little in the way of scientific evidence to support them. It is perhaps not surprising, then, that a climate has been created in which the ordinary person regards scientific developments with suspicion, having the under lying assumption that he or she is being put at risk by reckless scientists operating in an uncontrolled manner in their ivory towers.",

Against such a cultural backdrop, it is not surprising that the public has little problem in believing that government scientists employed in defense-related research are not to be trusted.

            "text": "So why are members of the public concerned about research sponsored by the defense community? Many nations view research into the development of medical countermeasures (MCMs) against biowarfare agents as an essential element of risk reduction. Although civilian and military populations are equally susceptible to the same biological agents, the relative risk of exposure differs markedly. Thus, although there is considerable common ality in the research priorities of each group, some biological threats, such as anthrax and plague, are cur rently seen as being more relevant to the military. In addition, the nature of the work undertaken by the mili tary and the environment in which it operates are likely to influence how and when MCMs are administered. For example, the military may consider immunizing troops with a new vaccine prior to deployment as the most effective means of protecting individuals and ensuring operational effectiveness in a high-risk environment. In contrast, the civilian authorities are more likely to treat with antibiotics after an outbreak has occurred rather than vaccinate large numbers of the public against a disease with a very low likelihood of a deliberate release (albeit very high impact), such as anthrax.",

To develop MCMs capable of dealing with biothreat agents such as anthrax, there is inevitably a requirement to handle and manipu late these dangerous pathogens, which in turn generates concerns, rightly or wrongly, about the possibility of their inadvertent release or potential misuse (dual use). Indeed, these concerns derive partly from the fact that the government-sponsored organizations currently devel oping defensive MCMs were engaged many decades earlier in the development of offensive biological weap ons. Although this research was discontinued in the 1960s in the United Kingdom, there are still concerns, in some quarters at least, regarding the potential for this type of work to be resurrected. When the public's mistrust of politicians and scientists is added to this mix, it is not difficult to understand why people are willing to believe the worst.",

The nature of modern research is such that it is rare to find a project that does not require collaboration with academic and/or industry-based part ners, thus ensuring at least some degree of scientific visibility. In addition, the regular inspection of defense research facilities by national regulatory agencies or under the auspices of international treaties is an attempt to alleviate some concerns.

This will require the exposure of healthy individuals to an experimental treatment that carries with it the risk of adverse reactions. Given that this is a man-made risk, how can this be justified? Fortunately, in countries such as the United Kingdom, these decisions are taken out of the hand of the defense scientists.

Drug companies are focused on making money and given the relatively small size of the military market will only invest significantly in the devel opment of MCMs that could also be used to protect civilian populations.

Clinical trials involving human volunteers are regulated by the MHRA and are overseen by research ethics com mittees (which are themselves approved by the UK Ethics Committee Authority). However, more regulations, such as intrusive psychological profiling of staff working in microbiological laboratories or heavy-handed, overbear ing, rigid assessment programs of scientific staff to 'ensure' reliability, are unlikely to further reduce the probability of an already extremely unlikely event. Rather, they are more likely to alienate well-motivated staff, thereby sti fling research and the development of products and techniques that could bring major benefits to the United Kingdom and humanity as a whole. Indeed, fostering a supportive community among well-rewarded and appre ciated scientists and staff would make it much easier to detect early signs of unhappiness, social problems, or the unacceptable behavior of individual researchers.
