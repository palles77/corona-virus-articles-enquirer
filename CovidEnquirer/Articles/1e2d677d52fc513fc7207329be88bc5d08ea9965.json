The locations of the surfaces include lavatory outside and inside door handles, as well as tray table top and bottom, and seat-belt buckle from two separate seats. Thus, there are eight locations and two time points from each flight. In addition, there was a coughing passenger (a \"cougher\") on the Los Angeles-to-Atlanta flight. We collected postflight surface samples (tray table top and bottom, seat belt) for the cougher's and two adjacent seats, and a seat-pocket sample from the cougher's seat. Thus, there are 10 additional surface samples from this flight. The total number of surface samples we submitted for 16S rRNA sequencing is 170 (10 flights, 2 time points, and 8 locations for each, plus the 10 samples from the cougher's flight). One sample was lost by the laboratory, thus our analyses report results for 169 surface samples. Air sampling. The two air-sampling pumps used were model SKC AirChek XR5000. Just before each sampling, each pump was calibrated using a MesaLab Defender Calibrator. Air samples of 30-min duration were collected onboard the aircraft during five distinct sampling intervals. Once the pilot announced the flight time, we calculated the quarter-way point, half-way point, and three-quarter-way point. Thus, the five sampling periods were: preboarding and boarding, Q1 \u00b1 15 min, Q2 \u00b1 15 min, Q3 \u00b1 15 min, and touchdown to end of deplaning. Following each sampling period, the sampling cartridges were wrapped with Teflon tape, labeled, logged, and placed in a cooler with chemical ice packs. Fomite sampling. Before each flight, we prepared an ordered list of seven randomly selected seats, of which the first two occupied seats, as confirmed by the gate agent before boarding, were sampled. We also randomly chose a rear lavatory door (port or starboard) for sampling.",

For example, it was common that an exit time from one observation zone was recorded after the entry time stamp for the next zone. Such discrepancies were generally unremarkable: that is, usually just seconds needed to be adjusted. Our rule for this issue was to assume that the earliest time of an event was the correct one because it is logical that an event cannot be recorded before it occurs. Thus, if passenger 19-A was recorded as exiting zone 1 at 10:10:01 and entering zone 2 at 10:09:57, we adjusted the zone 1 exit time to be 10:09:56. All such adjustments were noted in the data so that we could track and quantify them; these changes averaged on the order of a few seconds. Another example of a logical discrepancy involved a skipped-over zone in a series of movement observations, such as when a passenger seated in zone 3 was observed leaving his zone and was shortly thereafter observed in zone 5 going to the back lavatory. In such cases we created an entry for passage through zone 4 that took into account the recorded time stamps.",

They each reconstructed a randomly chosen 10% sample of passenger and crew data from the flights they had not worked with before. For passenger data, 10% of passengers were randomly selected and their complete series of movements were reconstructed. For crew members, random starting points in the time-ordered data were chosen, reconstructing 10 lines of data following those points. The two reconstructed sets of data were compared on start and stop time stamps, zone identification, and specified behavior. Agreement was quite high, with an average of 93% agreement on times (\u00b13 s) and even higher for the location of the movement. At this point, we felt confident that our re-construction methods produced a consistent record of movement on the flights. The next step was to address observations that involved passengers going to the front and back lavatory zones. Observers had been instructed to time-stamp the zone entry and zone exit times and note the behavior as simply \"back lav\" or \"front lav.\" They did not note the actual time of entry and exit into the lavatory itself because, particularly in the back zone, they were not able to observe this easily as the lavatories were behind their backs. To appropriately identify contacts and contact lengths, we broke the time into smaller periods, with four possible behaviors: \"passing through zone to the lav,\" \"waiting for lav,\" \"inside lav,\" and \"leaving the lav zone.\"",

We were also able to tell if the passenger left without entering the lavatory; this was apparent when the zone exit time was before the previous passenger left the lavatory (in the front, with one lavatory) or previous two passengers left (in the back, with two lavatories). Following this determination, we assigned times to each of the four possible behaviors. If a passenger did not have to wait, the behavior \"passing through zone to the lav\" was allowed 4 s. Four seconds is the 10th percentile of \"passing\" duration values; that seemed a reasonable amount of time for passing through the zone on the way to the lavatory itself. Upon leaving a lavatory, we gave a 2-s interval before the next person could enter, thus allowing contact between the one exiting and the next lavatory user. The behavior \"leaving the lav zone\" was also allowed 4 s. Thus, if the passenger was in the zone for a very short period, we concluded that they had not entered a lavatory.",

However, a crew member's movements in the observation area generally started after and ended before these bookends. Accounting for earlyand late-flight location ensured that contacts with other crew members, as well as with passengers who might visit the galley, were not missed. Thus, for these periods, we assumed the crew to be in either the front galley or the back galley, depending on the location of their first and last observed movements. For example, if the observation period started at 10:00:00 and Crew A was first observed in zone 1 at 10:25:00, Crew A was assigned a 25-min period in the front galley. In this manner all crew, with the exception of first-class crew, who occasionally entered our section, were located for the complete observation period.",

On the other hand, consider someone waiting for a back lavatory for 10 s. Because we did not know where the passenger stood to wait, the full 10-s interval was assigned to every row in the back zone.

Each seat on a simulated flight was filled with a randomly selected passenger seated in that or in a nearby seat on one of the eligible flights. The movements of that passenger were preserved as a whole. For example, in simulated flight 1, the passenger in seat 23A (Atlanta to Los Angeles) going to the lavatory at 12:00 may now interact with the passenger in seat 25A (Atlanta to San Francisco), who at 12:00 is in the aisle checking the overhead bin near row 23; thus, realistic simulated contact patterns are created based on empirical movement patterns. Crew, because they primarily work and move through the cabin in teams, were randomly assigned to a simulated flight as a unit from the eight possible teams. Thus, to simulate a flight with 250 seats and one set of crew based on empirical data from our 10 flights, there are possible 10 251 possibilities.
