Related to the more general and long pursued concept of database searching [2, 3] the term 'virtual screening' (VS) is relatively young [4] . Walters et al. define virtual screening as 'automatically evaluating very large libraries of compounds' using computer programs [5] . As this definition suggests, VS has largely been a numbers game focusing on questions like how can we filter down the enormous chemical space of >10 60 conceivable compounds [6] to a manageable number that can be synthesized, purchased and tested. Although filtering the entire chemical universe might be a fascinating question, more practical VS scenarios focus on designing/optimizing targeted combinatorial libraries and enriching libraries of available compounds from in-house compound repositories or vendor offerings.",

Especially when a target protein structure at high atomic resolution is available, SBVS is often considered as the first choice strategy ignoring possible LBVS alternatives. Until recently, only sporadic studies have pointed to the fact that LBVS offers a strong alternative to SBVS even in the presence of protein structural information. For instance, a comparison of LBVS and SBVS methods using the RECALL of known HIV-1 protease inhibitors as test examples has shown how ligand similarity methods can outperform molecular docking as a VS tool [16] . Recently a more systematic comparative study between SBVS and LBVS involving seven different drug targets for which structural information is available has been published [17] . Figure 2 illustrates that in most cases LBVS techniques measuring compound similarity to known potent molecules outperforms molecular docking, a more computationally intensive SBVS technique that generates and scores putative protein-ligand complexes according to their calculated binding affinities [18] . Similar results have recently been reported in the field of GPCRs using homology models for SBVS and 2D-QSAR, DECISION TREES, and PLS as LBVS methods [19] . Although studies about SCAFFOLD HOPPING through SBVS are scarce [20] it is recognized that SBVS techniques have a better potential to identify compounds with a novel core scaffold. Therefore, SBVS and LBVS should not be applied independently but rather in concert to increase the chances of finding novel hits [21, 22] . Some software approaches such as SDOCKER have begun integrating both strategies by including ligand similarity as a part of the SCORING FUNCTIONS used in the docking algorithm [23] . Bologa et al. has also reported the integration of both strategies to aid in the identification of the first selective GPR30 agonist [24] .",

VS hit sets should balance compounds ranked highly and being structurally diverse to increase the chance of finding novel chemotypes. Hits should then be followed up in a second iteration by analog testing. popular machine learning techniques are listed in Table 1 . Each method has its own advantages and disadvantages that should be understood to select the best approach for a particular LBVS. The first approach listed in the table, a selforganizing map (SOM), is quite simple and easy to visualize. A dataset of compounds are mapped on to a 2D grid such that most similar compounds are grouped together. Compounds found in the same vicinity of those with a desired biological property are considered potential hits in a virtual screen; however the SOM approach in general has a very high false positive rate. It is a simple and easy way to visualize if compounds that have the same biological properties group together. SOMs have been used recently to identify several purinergic receptor agonists [25] . Another approach called Binary QSAR uses all compounds in the training set to predict the biological property of test compound(s) in a virtual screen rather than just the most similar training compounds.",

Descriptors that capture molecular features of the training compounds are systematically added to a Decision tree model one at a time until compounds with different biological properties are adequately separated. This approach allows the researcher to easily determine the chemical features most relevant to the target biological property. This information can be used in the design of future molecules. Virtual screening with Decision trees is quite easy as well. Comparison studies have shown it slightly outperforms methods such as the Bayesian Classifier however other more advanced approaches show higher ENRICHMENT RATES in a virtual screen [27] .",

The simplest of these builds a linear correlation and is called multiple linear regression. A very popular extension called partial least squares (PLS) helps simplify the model optimization so larger training sets can be easily used. Variable selection techniques are also commonly added above the PLS algorithm to optimize the descriptors used in the linear model. This approach has shown success enriching a virtual database for various GPCR ligands [19] ; however, it has an obvious drawback. There is not always a linear correlation between the property modeled and the descriptors describing your dataset. The artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) approaches allow one to build non-linear correlations. ANN and SVM have become popular tools for model building and virtual screening. In a side-by-side comparison both ANN and SVM show similar enrichment rates for several virtual screens [27] . www.drugdiscoverytoday.com",

Compounds in a virtual screen are predicted based on known activities of the most similar training compounds. Similarity between compounds is calculated using only a small set of most pertinent descriptors that are optimized during model building (this optimization can be quite slow for large datasets). When used in a virtual screen kNN shows database enrichment rates similar to both ANN and SVM [27] . A domain of applicability can be used in virtual screening to improve the enrichment rates in a virtual screen by only allowing the model to predict compounds that have the highest chance of being predicted correctly. Applicability domain techniques have been applied very successfully for both kNN [28] and SVM [29] .

Advancements in VS have therefore been made in understanding the strengths and weaknesses of existing methods and how to use them rather than coming up with new approaches.
