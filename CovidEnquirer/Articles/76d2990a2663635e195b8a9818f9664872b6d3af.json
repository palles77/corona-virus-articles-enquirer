Metagenomic assays designed to perform these tasks will have to include rapid and economical processing of large numbers of samples, supported by straightforward data analysis pipeline and flexible sample preparation options for multiple input tissue types from individual patients, mammals, or environmental samples. To meet these requirements, the PathoChip platform was developed by targeting viral, prokaryotic, and eukaryotic genomes with multiple DNA probes in a microarray format that can be combined with a variety of upstream sample preparation protocols and downstream data analysis. PathoChip screening of DNA plus RNA from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor tissues demonstrated the utility of this platform, and the detection of oncogenic viruses was validated using independent PCR and deep sequencing methods. These studies demonstrate the use of the PathoChip technology combined with PCR and deep sequencing as a valuable strategy for detecting the presence of pathogens in human cancers and other diseases.",

Considering the thousands of microbial species that comprise the normal human microbiome (2) , it is likely that the microbe communities can substantially influence normal physiology, as well as the causes of (or major contributors to) and response to diseases (3), including cancer. These effects are the subject of intense investigation in tissue systems known to have resident microbiomes, which include the gastrointestinal tract (4) (5) (6) , skin (7) , and airway (8) (9) (10) , and in immune and inflammatory responses (11) (12) (13) (14) . Microbiome profiling is also examining the less obvious roles for microbes and their presence in unexpected locations. Some examples that are relevant but not limited to cancer include modulation of tumor microenvironments (15) and dysbiosis of bacterial populations in breast cancer tissues (16) .",

However, this will work only for bacterial species with amplicons that survive population PCR but not for viruses or eukaryotic microorganisms. 16S rRNA sequencing can also be used to screen large sets of samples but may have difficulty in discriminating between strains or reporting the presence of genomic variants or pathogenicity factors. Deep sequencing of the total DNA from a sample can certainly identify bacterial, viral, and other microbiome members (3, 17, 18) but with a severe penalty in efficiency. Even if the field attains the as-yet-unrealized goal of a cost of $1,000 per genome, total DNA sequencing will be an expensive method for screening hundreds or thousands of experimental and control samples to detect associations of pathogens with a particular disease. Depending on the specimen sampled, the data may overwhelmingly be from host human sequences, creating an unnecessarily large search space for locating pathogen signatures and resulting in the majority of sequence reads being discarded.",

Where possible, multiple probes to independent regions of the target genome are used to improve an opportunity for detection. Furthermore, while the PathoChip content was developed from sequences to known targets, the ability to discover new strains or organisms is provided by the inclusion of probes to sequences that are conserved within and between viral families. To this end, a previously unknown virus with homology to a conserved sequence may produce a corresponding hybridization signal from such a probe, if not to a complete probe set. A supporting workflow is described for profiling large collections of tumor samples typically available as formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue in biobanks and includes simultaneous detection of DNA and RNA to expand the range of targets available for hybridization.",

Human p16 overexpression from the CDKN2A gene is correlated with oncogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in OSCC, and p16 immunohistochemistry is used as a prognostic molecular biomarker in clinical pathology laboratories, with high sensitivity but poor specificity for HPV (27) . The OSCC samples included five p16-positive tumors and three p16-negative tumors as determined by pathology at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. From our PathoChip screen, four of the five p16(\u03e9) tumors produced high detection signals across the 68 PathoChip probes for HPV16, and the fifth tumor showed signals for a small subset of HPV16 probes. The remaining tumors were negative for PathoChip HPV16 detection ( Fig. 3) . Despite good hybridization to other p16(\u03e9) samples, three of the HPV probes for tumor 2025 and two probes for tumor 2028 had no detectable signal This is suggestive of an HPV strain variation, which was similar to the results from polymorphic sites in the CMV positive-control experiment. Development of PathoChip analysis strategies using OSCC tumor screening data. Oncogenic viruses may undergo significant genomic rearrangements or deletions in host tumors. Furthermore, viral strains can be widely polymorphic, and detection of a new pathogen may rely on signal from a single probe. Several levels of data analysis are therefore needed to detect three main classes of \"hits\" that might be expected in a screening project (Fig. 4) . Accession signal (AccSig), the average of all probes for an accession adjusted for human DNA cross-hybridization, was calculated to screen for detection by a majority of probes in an accession's set. MAT (model-based analysis of tiling arrays) scores (28) from a sliding window of probes were calculated to detect local areas of high signal regardless of accession boundaries. t tests with multiple testing correction were employed at the individual probe level to identify probes with signal consistently higher than back- from the NCBI DNA sequence databases and concatenated to form a metagenome. Wherever possible, regions of target sequence unique to the accession (a and c) were used to select multiple 60-nt probes (1, 2, and 4 to 6) for microarray synthesis, and probes to target regions that share similar sequences in at least two viral accessions (b) were also identified. Probes to prokaryotic and eukaryotic pathogens may map to intergenic, gene, or rRNA sequences or a mixture of target types, depending on the availability of sequence data. (B) Parallel and iterative design processes were used to assemble the PathoChip probe collection that covers unique and conserved target regions, supplemented with high-resolution probe tiling for known cancer-associated microorganisms.

Data from a screening project of 100 OSCC tumors were used to evaluate these analysis methods. AccSig for HPV16 was consistent with p16 pathology reports ( Fig. 5A ; see also Table S1 in the supplemental material), with 80% of p16(\u03e9) tumors producing an AccSig value of more than 100. Of the eight p16(\u03e9) tumors with low or no HPV16 AccSig, four showed high signals for a subset of HPV16 probes or produced significant AccSig values for HPV26 or HPV92. The sliding window analysis recapitulated AccSig results and highlighted the differences between detection events for full or partial HPV16 genomes. In Fig. 5B , metagenome regions with a MAT score of more than 3,000 were compiled for each sample, and the individual probes within each region were ordered by map position in a plot of probe signals. This analysis detected a number of other organisms, including pathogenic oral bacteria, although the signals were lower than those of the HPV genomes. These preliminary candidates will be investigated using confirmatory PCR and sequencing methods. Analyses at the individual probe level also demonstrated utility for identifying candidates. A large majority of HPV16 probes passed a t test significance threshold for detection signals which were greater than background across the tumor population (Table 3) , as would be expected for a genome that is so common in OSCC. Many HPV16 probes also passed the outlier test, indicating that although the signals are consistently different from background, the population's range of intensities is wide and therefore also contains outliers. In contrast, fewer HPV18 and HPV26 probes were significant by t test, reflecting the much lower apparent occurrence of these genomes in this tumor population (Table 3) . However, the outlier analysis easily identified the relatively larger number of probes that produced HPV18 or HPV26 detections by AccSig or MAT score in a few positive samples. For these rarer candidates, some probes were significant by t test because they produced lower but consistent signals over background throughout the population, which may be an account of copy number of genomes present and is not surprising. This also illustrates the need to examine probe-level hybridization intensities, not just to analyze algorithm output scores, when considering candidates for follow-up validation, regardless of the method used for their initial identification.",

Importantly, amplicons were not observed from HPV16-negative tumors (Fig. 6B) . Occasional faint bands were observed for amplicons using the r2 or r4 primer as expected, as these had low signals in probe sets identified above.",

The pools were mixed with a panel of biotinylated DNA probes that included HPV16 probes. Pooled DNA that hybridized to the probes was captured by magnetic streptavidin beads. Deep sequencing of libraries derived from the captured material produced a number of reads that map with high homology to the HPV16 genome (Fig. 6A) , and these reads were enriched for the regions targeted by the capture probes but also included distal sequences. Mapping individual reads from each library showed that very few HPV16 templates were present in the sample pool containing only tumors that were HPV16 negative by PathoChip or p16 assays (pool 1, Fig. 6A and C) . More HPV16 templates, up to 73 in pool 3, were observed in the libraries from HPV16positive tumors. Interestingly, there were regions of high reads which showed high intensities in the majority of the tumors analyzed. The E4 region which was prevalent in the majority of the tumors (Fig. 6A to C) may provide a window into the transcription profiles of HPV16 in these particular type of OSCCs. The oncogenes E6 and E7 also showed a high number of signals in the tumors, but not as dramatic and surprising as the E4 open reading frame (ORF) region. However, this may be an interesting discovery which suggests a higher number of transcripts for the E4 ORFs in these tumors than was previously thought. Notably, the E1 region also showed greater signals in the tiled probes across the HPV16 genome. Predominantly, E4 seems to be the most prominent signal for the OSCC tumors and suggests a greater involvement of E4 in maintenance of the tumor by HPV than previously indicated.",

The last three factors likely contributed to the differences in assay performance, in which 10,000 copies of JC or BK polyomavirus (5-kb genomes in a 4-kb double-stranded circular DNA plasmid vector) were detected with probe intensity ranges of 61 to 4,889 (JC virus, 42 probes) and 4 to 442 (BK virus, 9 probes). In contrast, adenovirus type 5 (36-kb genome, double-stranded linear nonintegrated DNA) was detected over an intensity range of to three hypothetical tumor samples. All probes for Acc2 show high signal in tumor 1 (left), so this candidate should be detectable by comparing the accession's all-probe averages from test samples with those of control samples. A subset of Acc3 probes show high signal in tumor 2 (middle), perhaps due to strain sequence differences or partial deletion of the genome, reducing the all-probe accession average and making detection more difficult. In this case, a sliding window analysis of local probe signals is not biased by accession annotation and may be more sensitive for candidate identification. A single probe for Acc1 has high signal in tumor 3 (right), so a third tier of analysis based solely on individual probe performance is needed to detect organisms not specifically targeted by the PathoChip but sharing sequence homology with one or a few probes. 342 to 65,325 using 63 probes and 100 target genome copies; differences in genome size and conformation may affect participation in whole-genome amplification reactions. Furthermore, probes clearly have different hybridization affinities despite sharing the same bioinformatic design criteria. PathoChip assay sen-sitivity will therefore vary across accessions and between protocol options, but the inclusion of multiple probes per accession and integration of candidates from different levels of data analysis provide avenues for optimizing the chances of detecting a pathogen in the screening projects. The HPV16 genome, for example, is a Integrating multiple probe analyses which include accessionlevel, sliding window, and individual probe comparisons detected HPV16 in 34 of 48 OSCC tumors individually tested by PathoChip screening, a 71% occurrence rate somewhat higher than the estimated 63% rate previously reported (29, 30) but not unreasonable given the rapidly increasing prevalence of papillomaviruses in oropharyngeal cancers (31) . The results of the assay were highly concordant with the molecular pathology reports for p16 overexpression and in some cases suggested that an HPV strain other than HPV16 may be responsible. HPV16 detections by PathoChip assays were confirmed by PCR using primers that are independent of PathoChip probes and by recovery and sequencing of HPV16 regions located outside those targeted by capture probes on the HPV genome.",

If sufficient target copies are present in a sample, inferences regarding genomic structural variation and RNA expression levels may be possible. For HPV16, probes mapping to early gene transcripts produced more overall signal than those for late genes in OSCC samples; this is consistent with studies of actively infected cells and the oncogenic effects of E6/E7 expression (32, 33) . Moreover, the transcription of HPV at the level of detail that we are probing here is greater than previously investigated and suggests a potential role for other transcripts, including the E4 ORF and related antigen, in maintenance of the transformed state in the tumors. Signals from probes to late gene sequences were similar to or somewhat higher than those of probes to intergenic HPV16 sequences. Therefore, the boost in early gene signals is likely due to the RNA portion of the sample target preparation. Among the early genes, strong signals were observed for E6/E7 sequences, and for the E4 region of E2, which is known to be a highly abundant RNA splicing product from the primary transcript (34) . Detailed interpretation of these data is complicated by the ability of HPV16 to exist in episomal and multiple host-genome integrated forms (35) , but probe signal differences within and between tumors will provide the identification of potential agents having oncogenic activities and so lead to new lines of investigation as a follow-up to the initial screening experiment.",

The sliding window analysis generally matched AccSig results but provided better ability to distinguish variants within the set of samples and offers the potential to detect candidates represented by only a portion of an accession. As used here, the MAT algorithm did require more labor because it was applied to each sample in separate operations, but this could be addressed by future automated scripting. Analyses at the individual probe level helped to explain how candidates arose in the AccSig and MAT results and are likely the only way in which previously unknown pathogens with some sequence homology to a conserved (or specific) probe can be detected. Thus, a PathoChip screening project can generate a list of candidates prioritized by the magnitude of detection, detection via multiple analysis strategies, and the rate of detection across the sample population. Combining these results with annotations for the virus or pathogenic microorganism such as host range, tissue specificity, or prevalence in the general population will assist in determination of which agents deserve further attention. This approach is likely to provide a signature of a particular cancer or disease with agents with various degrees of contribution. A window into the natural conditions for commensal and pathogenic organisms will greatly enhance our ability to diagnose and treat cancer and other possible diseases not yet linked to specific agents.",

Comparisons were performed at the accession level using AccAvg(Cy3) versus AccAvg(Cy5), and at the individual probe level using Cy3 versus Cy5 intensity values. Significance thresholds were set at a step-up false discovery rate of \u03fd0.05 and fold difference of \u03fe2. An outlier analysis was also performed at accession and probe levels by calculating the standard deviation of AccSig or probe signal across all tumors and filtering for any values that were 2 or more standard deviations higher than the population mean.",

Targets were captured by pooling the TransPlex products used for PathoChip screening (100 tumors over six pools) and then adding a probe panel aliquot containing 2.5 pmol of each probe to 150 ng of each target pool in 100-l reaction mixtures with 1\u03eb TMAC buffer (3 M tetramethylammonium chloride, 0.1% Sarkosyl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 4 mM EDTA, pH 8.0).

Sequencing libraries were prepared using the Nextera XT DNA sample preparation kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), with dual indexing and bead library normalization according to the manufacturer's protocols. After Qubit quantitation, libraries were submitted to the Washington University Genome Technology Access Center (St. Louis, MO) for quantitative PCR (qPCR) quality control measurements, library pooling, and sequencing on one flow cell of an Illumina MiSeq instrument with paired-end 250-nt reads. Approximately 400,000 reads from the six OSCC libraries generated were aligned to the PathoChip metagenome or the human genome using the Bowtie2 aligner (36) in sensitive-local mode.

(A) Whole-genome amplification kits that feature three different enzymatic processes were compared in their abilities to detect phiX174 bacteriophage genomic DNA spiked into human DNA. 1\u03eb DNA was equivalent to the molarity for a single-copy locus in the human genome. Green bars are the median Cy3 signal for the 14 phiX174 probes hybridized to test samples, and red bars show the median Cy5 signal from control samples (human DNA only). Error bars indicate standard deviations across probes. (B) Detection responses for three viruses were measured over a dilution series from 10,000 to 10 genomic copies per sample. Genomic DNA for each virus was spiked into a reference amount of human DNA. Blue bars are the average Cy3 signals for all probes to the indicated viruses hybridized to test samples, and white lines indicate the probes' Cy5 average from control samples (human DNA only). (C) Human cytomegalovirus (CMV) DNA was hybridized to a PathoChip containing 299 probes for saturation tiling across the reference CMV genome (NCBI accession NC_006273). The DNA was from CMV AD169, a strain that differs from the reference sequence at several locations, and was spiked into a background of human DNA for cohybridization with reference human DNA only (xhh).
