            "text": "Background: Respiratory protection effi ciency of facemasks is critically important in the battle against communicable respiratory infections such as infl uenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). We studied the spatial distributions of simulated virus-laden respiratory droplets when human subjects wore facemasks and were exposed to regulatory viral droplets by conducting in vivo experiments in facemask use. Methods: Transmission pathway of aerosols of Fluorescein-KCl solution through facemasks and protective effi ciency of facemasks were examined by using normal surgical facemasks and two facemasks with exhaust valves (Facemask A) and exhaust holes (Facemask B) covered with the same surgical fi lters situated at the back of the facemasks. Fluorescein-KCl solution was sprayed onto the faces of participants wearing the facemasks and performing intermittent exercises on a treadmill in a climatic chamber. Results: Experimental results showed that when droplets spread onto a person face-to-face over short distances, 92.3% to 99.5% of droplets were blocked by the front surface of the facemask, whereas only 0.5% to 7.7% of droplets reached the back of the facemask. Both facemasks A and B had near or over 99% protection effi ciency, compared with that of 95.5% to 97% of surgical facemasks. Using the same fi lters as normal surgical masks, facemasks A and B provided more effective respiratory protection against communicable respiratory infections such as infl uenza and SARS by the location of the breathing pathway to the back of the facemasks. Conclusions: Separating the breathing pathway from the virus-contaminated area in facemasks can provide more effective protection against communicable respiratory infections such as infl uenza and SARS.",

These respiratory droplets can then be directly deposited onto the mucosal surfaces of the upper respiratory tract of susceptible persons who are near (ie, within 3 feet) the droplet source such as healthcare workers (HCWs) in healthcare environments. Therefore, it is recommended that healthcare personnel use a fi t-tested respirator, at least as protective as a National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-approved N95 fi ltering respirator for close patient contact with known or suspected avian infl uenza to decrease transmission of infl uenza in healthcare settings (CDC 2005) .",

Willeke and colleagues (1996) reported that the mean effi ciencies of a surgical facemask was 97% and found that spherical corn oil particles and spherical bacteria have the same penetration in size range from 0.9 to 1.7 \u00b5m for surgical facemasks. Qian and colleagues (1998) reported that N95 respirators provide excellent protection against airborne particles when there is a good face seal. The fi ltration effi ciency of unloaded N95 mask is 99.5% or higher for particles larger than 0.75 \u00b5m and 95% or higher for the most penetrating particle size of about 0.1 to 0.3 \u00b5m. However, Martyny and colleagues (2002) reviewed respiratory protection and found that respirators can save lives, but cannot guarantee complete protection. Ba\u0142azy and colleagues (2006) reported that the penetration of virions (particle size range of 0.01-0.08 \u00b5m) through N95 respirators can exceed an expected level of 5%. The infl uenza virus is a globular particle with about 0.08-0.12 \u00b5m in diameter (Mandell et al 1995) . Therefore, viruses may be able to penetrate or spread through N95 respirators.",

            "text": "Furthermore, Tambyah (2004) pointed out that some HCWs were infected with SARS despite wearing full personal protective equipment (PPE; gloves, gown, and N95 respirators). An intensivist who wore full PPE including a N95 respirator became infected with SARS during a bronchoscopy at a Singapore university hospital (Tambyah 2004) . A physician who cared for the wife of the initial case patient in Taiwan developed clinical features that met the criteria for a probable SARS case and was confi rmed to be infected with the SARS coronavirus by the laboratory. He was considered as being infected by a direct line of droplet spread when the SARS patient had episodes of coughing while sometimes partially sitting up during the performance of a chest ultrasound and while supervising the intubation despite using a N95 respirator (Twu et al 2003) . Moreover, 5 patients with SARS in a teaching hospital in Singapore were HCWs who had contact with patients although they wore PPE (Ho et al 2004) . Therefore, Tambyah (2004) concluded that PPE is effective most of the time, but sometimes additional protection is needed. Undoubtedly, the issues demand further investigation. There is a strong need to explore the reasons that commercially available respirators cannot guarantee complete protection from the mode of transmission of virus-laden respiratory droplets. The protective principles of a typical fi ltering facemask must be studied to guide the design and use of facemasks for enhancing their protective effi ciency. Figure 1A shows the possible pathway of contaminated droplets spreading from an infected person onto the face of a susceptible host. When an infected human coughs or sneezes, particles of varying sizes ranging from large particle droplets (about 100 \u00b5m in diameter) to small particle droplets (about 0.1 \u00b5m in diameter) are created. These droplets could reach the alveolus of a susceptible host when respiratory protection is not employed. When the susceptible person wears a respirator in a face-to-face position, most of the contaminated droplets spreading onto the person's face from infected person were blocked by the front surfaces of the respirator. Figure 1B shows that when the droplets contaminated with infl uenza viruses (about 0.08-0.12 \u00b5m in diameter) reach the front surface of a facemask, they can stick to the surfaces that have pore sizes from 0.3\u223c50 \u00b5m in diameter if a facemask is not strongly water-repellent or can be absorbed by the facemask if the facemask is water-absorbent particularly since the expired air would most likely wet the facemask (Li and Li 2005) . Figure 2 shows the structure of the commonly used facemasks and the possible transmission pathway of virus when a typical fi ltering facemask is worn. As Figure 2A shows, virus-laden respiratory droplets could spread onto whole face of a susceptible host and form a virus-contaminated area inside an imaginary frame. A typical fi ltering facemask mainly protects the parts of the face under the wearer's eyes under an imaginary horizontal line ( Figure 2B ). Its fi lter ventilates air and obstructs viruses, and the fi lter of a typical fi ltering facemask becomes accordingly both breathing and fi ltering areas. It is clear that the virus-contaminated area overlaps over the fi ltering-breathing area on the fi lter of a typical fi ltering facemask ( Figure 2C ). Consequently, inhaled air could be contaminated when wearers exhale and inhale during breathing cycles through the fi lter of a typical fi ltering facemask ( Figure 2D ). This mode of transmission of virusladen respiratory droplets on facemasks and the structure of a typical fi ltering facemask might be responsible for the incomplete protection of commercially available facemasks in some healthcare occasions.",

The breathing channels, ie, exhaust valves/holes, are placed at the back of facemask far from the virus-contaminated areas. The breathing channels are covered with fi lters that are equivalent to normal surgical facemasks and/or N95 respirators (Li et al 2004) . It is expected that such separation in facemask design would reduce the contamination of inhaled air and increase the protective effi ciency of facemask to the wearers compared with commercially available surgical facemasks. The principal objective of this study was to examine the hypothesis of how the virus-laden respiratory droplets transmit through facemasks and the protective effi ciency of two types of new facemasks with separated breathing pathways from the virus-contaminated areas.

Other physical characteristics (mean \u00b1 SD) of the subjects were as follows: height, 170.4 \u00b1 7.1 cm; weight, 64.4 \u00b1 8.4 kg; body surface area, 1.71 \u00b1 0.14 m 2 . The experimental protocol was approved by the Human Subject Ethics Sub-committee of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, and all procedures involving human subjects complied with the Declaration of Helsinki (2000). Figure 3 illustrates the two types of facemasks used in this experiment (Li et al 2004) . Facemask A was made of laminated polypropylene with polyester fabrics with two exhaust valves made of plastic and situated at its back. The exhalation valves open to release exhaled air and close during inhalation. The inhalation valves perform in the opposite way, opening during inhalation and closing during exhalation. Fresh air enters into the mask through two inhalation valves covered by a fi lter that is made from the same fabric as a surgical facemask to prevent microbes or other toxic substances from entering the respiratory tract by inhalation. Facemask B was also made of laminated polypropylene with polyester fabrics and had two exhaust holes situated at its back. The wearers respired through the same two exhaust holes covered by fi lter materials, which was also made from the same fabric as a surgical facemask. The major difference between Facemasks A and B was that the former had exhaust valves, but the latter did not. The surgical facemask was commercially available for use in public hospitals and clinics in Hong Kong. The tested surgical facemask was about 0.80 mm thick, and facemasks A and B were about 2.45 and 2.41 mm thick, respectively.",

Fluorescein-KCl solution was used to simulate viral aerosols, as it would be dangerous and unethical to conduct in vivo facemask tests by exposing human participants to live viruses. Both KCl, one of the main cations in body tissue, and Fluorescein, a diagnostic adjunct used in retinal angiography, are not known to be harmful to the human body and are injected into veins in clinical practice (Ford 1996) . The use of KCl rather than NaCl as suggested by the NIOSH for the test challenge aerosol (NIOSH 1995) is because the concentration of KCl in human sweat is very low and has minimum effect on the in vivo test results (Zhang and Qiao 1997) . The fl uorescent stain was mainly used to simulate extends of viral contamination, instead of the live virus. In this study, simulated viral particles were produced by the nebulization of a Fluorescein-KCl solution with a concentration of 2 mg of KCl and 0.003 mg Fluorescien/cm 3 of deionized water. An atomizer was used to generate simulated viral aerosols by spraying the Fluorescein-KCl solution. Assuming the density of the solution is 1, the average weight of splash in one stroke of spray was 1.27 g, as weighed with an electronic balance that has precision of 0.001 g.",

There are a number of critical fi ndings that may have signifi cant clinic implications in hospital infection control practices when communicable respiratory infections are transmitted by means of large droplets over short distances: \u2022 Around 92.3% to 99.5% of droplets were blocked by the front surface of the facemasks. This shows that the front surface of the facemask receives most of the contaminated droplets when HCWs speak to and/or take care of patients (Figure 7) . These observations provide direct experimental data to support the guidelines recommended by the WHO and Centers of Disease Control (CDC), ie, to use a facemask to provide respiratory protection against infectious respiratory diseases such as infl uenza, tuberculosis, or SARS (CDC 1993 (CDC , 2005 WHO 2003 ). \u2022 As more than 90% of the simulated viral loadings were blocked by the front surfaces of the facemasks, the inhaled air could be contaminated with viruses if the breathing pathway overlaps the viral-contaminated areas, and then the effi ciency of the fi lters becomes the only protection for the wearers. \u2022 There are huge differences in the simulated viral contaminations on the front and back surfaces of facemasks. Only 0.5%~7.7% of droplets reached the back of the facemasks. Therefore, it is critically important to separate the breathing pathways from the viruscontaminated front surface. \u2022 By simply locating the breathing pathways to the back of facemask and using the same fi lters of surgical facemask, the in vivo protective effi ciency of facemasks A and B reached 98.9% to 99.9% compared with that of normal surgical facemasks of 95.5% to 97.0% for KCl particles. The differences of 2.9% to 3.4% in the protective efficiency of facemasks may have important implications for doctors and nurses who are exposed to critically ill patients. With a fi t test to ensure good fi tting, it can be expected that the protective effi ciency of facemasks A and B can be further increased. These fi ndings maybe applicable to the airborne transmission in relative stable air streams, as the airborne particles with size range of 0.1 to 100 \u00b5m are signifi cantly heaver than air, thus they would likely drop to the ground in time. Their pathways would be expected to be similar with those of droplets shown in Figure 1 . Therefore, the chances for the airborne particles to reach the back and/or bottom of a facemask would be lower than those to reach the front surface of the facemask. This means that separation of the breathing pathways from the front surface could still effectively increase the protective effi ciency of facemask for airborne transmissions. It is different story in the cases of turbulent air streams.",
