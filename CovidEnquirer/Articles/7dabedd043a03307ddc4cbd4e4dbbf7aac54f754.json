            "text": "Many families of viruses have an envelope wrapping their genome, RNA or DNA. The envelope is a lipid bilayer membrane with the virusspecific glycoproteins spanning it. The bilayer originates from the host cell membrane and has a lipid composition and transbilayer distribution quite similar to the host's. The viral glycoproteins have the functions of binding to the target cell surface and fusion with the cell membranes (see Table I ). The two functions are carried by a single glycoprotein in influenza virus (HA), VSV (G), and SFV (E).' In HVJ, the functions are carried by separate glycoproteins, HN for binding and F for fusion. When viruses encounter target cells, they first bind to the cell surface through interaction of the viral glycoprotein with receptors ( Fig. la) . Sialoglycoproteins andlor sialoglycolipids are known to be the receptors for HN in HVJ and HA in influenza virus.",

            "text": "Fusion of the virus envelope with target cell membranes is an essential initial step in infection since the virus can transfer its genome into the cytoplasm by this event (Fig. lc) . Envelope fusion is induced by the action of the virus glycoprotein on target membranes. Some fusion proteins are initially produced in precursor forms and then cleaved posttranslationally by proteolytic enzymes. F in HVJ and HA in influenza virus are such examples. They are produced as precursor forms FO and HA0 and then cleaved into F2 and F1 (Homma and Ohuchi, 1973; Scheid and Choppin, 1974) and HA1 and HA2 (Klenk et al., 1975; Lazaro-witz and Choppin, 19751 , linked by disulfide bonds between the subunits, respectively. The precursors are inactive, but the cleaved forms are active in both fusion and infectivity, strongly suggesting a causal relationship between them. Other examples are gPr73 in MMTV and E2 in mouse hepatitis virus which are cleaved into gpS2 and gp36 (Redmond and Dickson, 1983 ) and 90A and 90B (Sturman et al., 1983 , respectively, to become active. E in SFV is cleaved into E3, E2, and El (Garoff et d., 1980) . On the other hand, G in VSV is not subject to cleavage.",

These segments are produced on posttranslational proteolytic activation. They are assumed to be responsible for fusion activity because of the hydrophobicity and also because of the conservation of sequence among various strains of HVJ and influenza virus (Gething el a!., 1978) . However, the sequence homology is not always observed; for example, influenza C virus and pneumovirus have sequences different from other viruses except for the hydrophobicity. El in SFV and G in VSV do not contain such amino-terminal hydrophobic segments but have internal hydrophobic stretches. Residues 80-100 in El and residues 100-131 in G, which have sequence homology among the strains, may be such stretches though not strongly hydrophobic (Table  262 SHUN-ICHI OHNlSHl and the putative fusogenic segment should be able to interact with the target membrane, inducing some disturbance eventually leading to fusion (Fig. Ib) . Generally, proteins may have similar hydrophobic segments in them. Even acqueous enzymes have such segments: two in porcine trypsin and one in hepatic alcohol dehydrogenase (Asano and Asano, 1984) . Virus fusion proteins can also have more than one hydrophobic segment. For example, residues 175-199 in G is another hydrophobic sequence (Table 11 ). These hydrophobic segments can be fusogenic only when they approach and interact with target membranes.",

Such fusion was not clearly demonstrated for other viruses, however, and, instead, uptake of viruses into intracellular coated vesicles and smooth vesicles was observed. This raised a question of the mechanism of virus genome transfer into the target cell cytoplasm for these viruses. Ten years later, the induction of envelope fusion activity in mildly acidic media was discovered for SFV (VMnanen and Kaariainen, 1979, 1980) , influenza virus (Maeda and Ohnishi, 1980; Huang ef al., 1981; Lennard and Miller, 19811, and later VSV (White et al., 1981; Mifune et al., 1982; Matlin et al., 1982) . The pH dependence of fusion was markedly different; while HVJ can fuse at neutral as well as acidic pH values, SFV, influenza virus, and VSV can fuse only at acidic pH (Fig. 2) . A new virus entry mechanism was proposed for these viruses on the basis of these findings, SFV by Helenius et ul. (1980) , influenza virus by Maeda and Ohnishi (1980) , Matlin et al. (19811, and Yoshimura et al. (1982) , and VSV by Matlin et al. (1982) . After uptake into intracellular vesicles, these viruses fuse with vesicle membranes when the intravesicular lumen becomes acidic and release their genome into the cytosol. At first, lysosomes were proposed as the acidic compartment, since they are well known to have a pH of 4.8 (Ohkuma and Poole, 1978) . After the proposal, however, a rapid acidification of prelysosomal endocytic vesicles (endosomes) was discovered in 1982 by Tycko and Maxfield (1982) and van Renswoude et al. (1982) . Genome transfer by fusion with endosomes was shown shortly afterward by Marsh et al. (1983b) for SFV and Yoshimura and Ohnishi (1984) for influenza virus.",

I concentrate on the interaction of the hydrophobic segment with the target cell membrane lipid bilayer and suggest the entrance of the segment into the lipid bilayer hydrophobic core as a key step in fusion. For the hydrophobic segments containing a few acidic residues, I emphasize protonation of those residues as a requirement for the entrance. Finally, I briefly review (Yamada and Ohnishi. 1986 ) and fusion with MDCK cells (White et ( I / . , 1981) . (Modified from Ohnishi and Yoshimura. 19x4.) the entry pathway of virus into cells leading to infection.

Virus-induced hemolysis has been used as a 264 SHUN-CHI OHNlSHl rapid, sensitive, and convenient assay for envelope fusion. However, this assay is indirect since it measures a result of envelope fusion. A different approach based on intermixing of viral lipids with target cell membrane lipids was developed (Maeda et al., 1975; Ohnishi, 1985a) . Virus is incubated with spin-labeled phospholipids to incorporate them into its envelope. The spin-labeled virus is then incubated with target cell membranes. The ESR peak height increases on fusion due to dilution of spin-labeled phospholipids with cell membrane lipids. Assays of fusion using fluorescent probes based on the same principle were also developed (Wyke at al., 1980; Struck et al., 1981) . A recent example is to use octadecyl rhodamine B chloride loaded into virus envelopes and to measure the relief of fluorescence quenching on fusion (Hoekstra at al., 1984) . These spectroscopic methods provide rapid, continuous, and quantitative information on fusion. A drawback is the difficulty in discriminating fusion from exchange of lipids between two membranes without fusion, if it occurred.",

Large IMPs appeared on the E-face on incubation at 37\u00b0C. Nucleocapsid strands are regularly folded under the envelope in early harvests but become irregular and detached from the envelope on incubation. The invisible to visible transformation of IMPs could be due to aggregation of viral glycoproteins in the envelope.

CELL FUSION Cell fusion induced by HVJ was discovered by Okada (1958) (see Okada, Chapter 10, this volume) . Cell fusion is initiated by viral envelope fusion with the cell membrane, but requires factors, such as ATP, in addition to the latter process. It is inhibited by cytochalasins and high concentrations of mono-and disaccharides (Maeda et a / . , 1977) , whereas envelope fusion is not affected by these agents. Envelope fusion produces intercellular cytoplasmic bridges, and the ensuing osmotic swelling of cells causes expansion of the locally fused sites to form spherical polykaryons (Knutton, 1979) . This sequence was clearly shown using nonhemolytic viruses. The fusion reaction stopped at the initial stage with these viruses because of the lack of cell swelling. When the cells were subsequently swollen by lowering the osmolarity of the medium, they formed spherical polyerythrocytes (Knutton, 1979; Knutton and Bachi, 1980) . Polyerythrocyte formation is very efficient with erythrocytes but extremely inefficient with erythrocyte ghosts because of the lack of osmotic swelling in the latter. Sekiguchi and Asano (1978) have succeeded in attaining a large enhancement of polyerythrocyte formation by preloading bovine serum albumin (5%) into ghosts.",

The sequence is well conserved among paramyxoviruses, but the homology with pneumovirus is poor. These hydrophobic segments should be able to approach target membranes in the fusion reaction. Partial exposure of this segment to external media was shown by using various proteolytic enzymes (Asano er al., 1980) . Treatment of HVJ with aminopeptidase M resulted in a change of the F1 amino terminus from Phe to Ala, yet in no apparent change in the mobility on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), suggesting that 3 (or 9) amino-terminal residues were cleaved off.

Interaction of HA with Liposomes. Interaction of HA with receptor (gang1ioside)-containing liposomes was studied by measuring the fluorescence of Trp residues (Ohnishi, 198%; Kobayashi et al., unpublished) . After allowing the binding of HA to liposomes and washing, the liposome suspension was acidified, neutralized, and treated with semialkali protease. HA1 was digested and HA2 remained bound. Liposomes were isolated, subjected to further extensive proteolysis by bromelain or proteinase K, and centrifuged in a sucrose density gradient. Isolated liposomes still contained a small peptide(s) which gave fluorescence due to the Trp residue at 337 nm. The fluorescence was not quenched by the aqueous quencher acrylamide, but was greatly quenched by spin-labeled stearates incorporated into liposome membranes.

HA molecules form trimers and extend 13.6 nm from the envelope surface. The receptor binding site is located in HA1 near the upper surface of the molecule. The amino-terminal hydrophobic segment in HA2 is located in a different domain near the envelope surface and hidden inside the trimer. When the virus binds to the cell surface receptor, the two membranes are still far apart. A large conformational change is therefore required at acidic pH to bring the two membranes into close contact and to make the hydrophobic segment exposed and approach the target membrane. Such a structural change has been observed by various methods. BHA and HA are resistant to trypsin at neutral pH but become susceptible after low pH treatment. The pH dependence of the susceptibility agrees well with that of envelope fusion (Skehel et al., 1982; Sat0 et al., 1983) . The cleaved sites were determined to be at Lys 27 and Lys 224 in the HA1 component (Skehel et al., 1982) . The conformational change appears to expose the HA2 amino-terminal hydrophobic segment. Aggregation of BHA molecules to form micelles at acidic pH is likely to take place via hydrophobic association, placing the amino-terminal segments near the center. Treatment with thermolysin removed the amino-terminal 23 residues and caused resolubilization (Daniels et al., 1983) . BHA binds to phospholipids or detergents at acidic pH when these amphiphilic molecules coexist, probably by association with the exposed hydrophobic segment. The pH dependence of the binding is the same as that of envelope fusion.",

Clustering was dependent on the temperature of quenching, as in the case of HVJ (Section II,A,4) . At 37\"C, protein distribution was more random. The clustering is a reversible thermotropic aggregation of membrane proteins, and the effect is similar to that of HVJ, but much more extensive (see, for example, Fig. 3E) . The difference is not due to the incubation of erythrocytes at acidic pH, since the clustering induced by HVJ at pH 5.0 was similar to that at pH 7.4. HA rosettes also cause IMP clustering in erythrocyte membranes at pH 5.2, although the degree of clustering is not so large (Fig. 3F) , similar to that caused by the virus after incubation for a short period, e.g., I min (Fig. 3D) .",

Lateral mobility of band 3 proteins in erythrocyte membranes is largely restricted under physiological conditions; the diffusion constant is of the order of cm? sec-I. Incubation of erythrocytes with influenza virus or HA rosettes at pH 5.2 caused a large mobilization of band 3 proteins, the diffusion constant increasing 50or 20-fold, respectively. No such mobilization was observed when the cells were incubated at pH 7.4 or when ghosts were incubated at pH 5.2 without virus. The mobilization may be related to modification of the cytoskeletal meshwork underneath the membrane, consisting of spectrin-actin-band 4.1 peripheral proteins. A diffuse fibril structure was converted into aggregated dense spots, and membrane regions lacking the meshwork were produced after incubation with virus at pH 5.2. A model for the restriction by the cytoskeletal network has recently been presented (Tsuji and Ohnishi, 1986) . There are two populations of band 3 proteins. About lO-I5% of them, calculated as band 3 monomers, are anchored to the cytoskeletal network via ankyrin and are immobile.",

Isolated E glycoproteins form octameric micelles which, however, do not have hemolytic activity (Vaananen and Kaariainen, 1979) . The glycoproteins reconstituted into liposomes showed low pH-induced hemolytic and fusion activities (Marsh et al., 1983a) . The fusion efficiency was lower (25%) than that of the parent virus, possibly due to lower spike density on the reconstituted membranes. Cholesterol was not required for reconstitution. Of the three components of E, El was shown to be active for hemolysis and hemagglutination. Yamamoto et al. (1981) solubilized E glycoproteins from Western equine encephalitis virus, an alphavirus, and isolated the components. Reconsituted vesicles containing E I alone but not those containing E2 alone showed fusion activity. It is suggested that E2 may cooperate with El in the hemagglutination activity.",

The pH range for fusion activity is similar to SFV (Fig. 2d) , the pHlI2 value ranging from 6.1 to 6.4 (Table 111) . A characteristic of VSV different from other viruses is that protease pretreatment of target cells does not destroy but rather enhances virus binding and fusion. The human erythrocyte is an extreme example: the virus cannot agglutinate nor fuse with intact cells but shows enhanced hemagglutination and fusion activities to trypsin-treated cells (Mifune el al.. 1982) . Fusion with trypsinized erythrocytes is very rapid (within 1-2 min) and efficient (-80% fusion) at pH 5.5 at 37\u00b0C (Yamada and Ohnishi, 1986) . Pretreatment of L cells with trypsin or neuraminidase also results in increased binding and plaque formation (Schloemer and Wagner, 1975) . These results strongly suggest that sialoglycoproteins and sialoglycolipids as well as proteins are not receptors. Instead, lipids may be the direct target site. Inhibition of virus binding and infection by PS liposomes supports this idea (Schlegel et d., 1983) .",

Fusion with liposomes is quite similar to that with trypsinized erythrocyte membranes, in the rate, efficiency, and pH dependence. Binding to liposomes is also dependent on pH; the threshold pH (7.5) is about I unit higher than that for fusion. Binding and fusion with liposomes did not decrease at lower pH values, while those with cells decreased. Binding to liposomes was dependent on the head groups of the phospholipids, being stronger to phosphoserine than to phosphocholine. On the other hand, the head group requirement was not strong for fusion, but the presence of cis-unsaturated fatty chains in phospholipids was required. For example, efficiency of fusion with cis-unsaturated dioleoyl PC was 5296, but that with saturated dimyristoyl PC was negligibly small, 8%. Cholesterol enhanced fusion further but was not an absolute requirement. Efficient fusion with various natural phospholipids and lipids is probably due to the presence of cis-unsaturated fatty acids. lsolated G glycoproteins do not have hemolytic activity by themselves; however, G glycoproteins reconstituted into vesicles have fusion activity (Eidelman et a/. , 1984) . Reconsituted vesicles prepared at high protein/ lipid ratios (-0.3 mol 96 protein) and by slow removal of detergent had high fusion activity. Fusion with liposomes containing PS or PE are much faster than that with PC alone. Inclusion of cholesterol did not affect the fusion. However, it is noteworthy that the pH range for fusion shifted largely to lower values, with a threshold at pH 5.0. A n alternative reconstitution procedure has been used recently to produce reconstituted vesicles whose fusion activity has a pH dependence similar to that of the intact virus (Metsikko et al., 1986) .",

Morphological observation of isolated influenza virus and HA showed a thinning and marked elongation of HA at low pH (Ruigrok et al., 1986) . However, this is the change induced between HA spikes in the absence of binding to target membranes, and change in HA when bound to target membranes may be different. The conformational change may be triggered by protonation of some acidic amino acids. The conversion of charged residues into protonated neutral ones would greatly alter interresidue interactions. The pK, value of mildly acidic residues in proteins lies in a range 5.6-7.0 for His, 3.0-4.7 for Asp (P-carboxyl), -4.5 for Glu (y-carboxyl), and 3.0-3.2 for the carboxy-terminal a-carboxyl group (Dawes, 1980) .

For example, the site in the viral glycoprotein used for the binding should be different. The pH dependence may therefore be different between these two types of binding. Such differences have been demonstrated: while binding of influenza virus to cell membranes occurs in a wide range of pH values from 8 to 5 ( M a t h et al., 1981 :  Yoshimura et al., 1982) , binding to liposomes occurs only below pH 6.2, in parallel to the fusion activity (Doms et al., 1986) . The binding to liposomes may involve interaction of the HA2 amino-terminal hydrophobic segment, exposed at the low pH, with the lipid bilayer. Both events are thus effected by the same cause. On the other hand, binding to receptors on target membranes occurs at neutral pH and also at acidic pH so long as the conformational change in HA does not destroy the binding site in HA1 . No gross denaturation of HA at low pH was indicated by CD measurements (Skehel et a / . , 1982) .",

A segment containing charged residues is not favorable for transfer because of the work necessary to bring a charge into hydrocarbon media (Parsegian, 1969) . When these charged residues are neutralized by protonation or deprotonation, transfer would be much easier. It has been shown that a single substitution of a hydrophobic amino acid residue (e.g.,Ala) for a charged residue (e.g., Glu) in the signal peptide of secretory proteins blocks transfer of the proteins across the inner membrane of mutant E. coli (Bedouelle et al., 1980; Emr er al., 1980) . \" Free energies were calculated for transfer of a-helical segments, using parameter values assigned to each amino acid residue by von Heijne f 1981). The values for transfer at neutral pH include the work to protonate acidic residues at neutral pH, while the work is omitted from the values at acidic pH since protonation occurs spontaneously. For the amino-terminal hydrophobic segments, free energy values are given for transfer of the internal segment (e.g.. 2-24) and the whole segment (e.g., 1-24), corresponding to models A and B in Fig. 5 . respectively.

The protonation occurs spontaneously at acidic pH, but requires work at neutral pH since the latter is higher than the pK, value of the acidic residues. This extra work, 15-18 kJ/mol per acidic residue, is included in the free energy for transfer at neutral pH but omitted at acidic pH. The free energy values at acidic pH are therefore much lower (30-50 kJ/mol) than those at neutral pH (Table IV) , although the latter values are also negative in most cases. The hydrophobic segment in gp36 of MMTV, another low pH-active virus, does not contain acidic residues, however. In this case, the low pH may be required only for the conformational change to expose the hydrophobic segment which is ready for interaction without protonation. The free energy value for transfer is largely negative, independent of pH (Table IV). Our point is that when the segment has acidic residues, they should be neutralized for the interaction. This leads to a hypothesis that the hydrophobic segment in viruses with fusion activity at neutral pH should not contain acidic residues, which so far holds.",

The threshold pH was around 6.0, and the pHllz value was 5.6. Fusion efficiency was dependent on the peptide to phospholipid ratio in the mixture, increasing with increases in the ratio. The low pH-induced fusion can be stopped immediately by shifting the pH to neutral and started again by readjusting to acid. The peptides with acetylated or succinylated amino termini also had similar fusion activity. The pH range was, however, shifted about 1 pH unit to the acidic side. These results clearly demonstrate a direct involvement of the fusogenic segment in fusion and strongly suggest the requirement of protonation for activity since there are no other acid-sensitive groups in this simplified fusion system. c. pH-Dependent Fusion Activity of Succinylated Melittin. Hydrophobic peptides can have membrane fusion activity. The natural hydrophobic peptide bee venom melittin is one such example. This peptide actually caused fusion of egg PC vesicles at neutral as well as acidic pH (Fig. 6B ) (Murata et al., 1987a) . A succinylated derivative of this peptide was synthesized in which all four amino groups, one a-amino group and three Eamino groups at lysines, were converted to carboxyl groups. This derivative caused fusion of PC vesicles only at acidic pH, in marked contrast to the parent peptide (Fig. 6B) . The threshold pH for fusion was 5.2 and the pHllz 5.15. The pH characteristics of fusion can thus be modified to acid sensitive by introducing acidic groups. The low pH-induced fusion by succinylated melittin can be stopped immediately by shifting the pH to neutral and started again by readjusting to acid.",

Such a dynamic nature of interaction can well explain the rapid on/off switching of fusion on shifting pH to neutral and acid. d . Primury Sequence versus Hydrophobicity. The above discussions are solely thermodynamic, considering only the hydrophobicity of the segment which does not require any specific primary sequence. Is the primary sequence also essential for the fusion function? Needless to say, the primary sequence determines the three-dimensional structure and the conformational change of HA at low pH. The HA2 amino-terminal segment is also involved in secondary structure formation; the terminal nitrogen and the amide nitrogen of residues 4,5, and 6 form hydrogen bonds to oxygen atoms of residue 112 (Asp) in the long helix of HA2 (Wilson et al., 1981) . Mutations at these sites should alter interresidue interactions to affect stability of the structure and pH for the conformational transition (Daniels et al., 1985) . However, the primary sequence may not be important for interaction with the lipid bilayer. For example, influenza C virus has an amino-terminal sequence with very little homology with A and B viruses, but has a common feature of hydrophobicity.",

Studies on the fusion of phospholipid vesicles by hydrophobic peptides containing acidic residues indicated that fusion activity was induced by protonation of the acidic residues (Section III.B,2). At neutral pH. these peptides bind to the vesicle surface but do not cause aggregation of vesicles. At acidic pH, when charges in the hydrophobic segment are neutralized by protonation, vesicles may be brought into close contact owing to the increased surface hydrophobicity, which could overcome the surface dehydration energy (Ohki, 1987) . Vesicles aggregate under such conditions. Moreover, the neutralized hydrophobic segment may enter into the lipid bilayer. The segment would then compress the lipid molecules surrounding it. Since the interaction can be dynamic, the rapid entrance into and returning back to the surface would cause density fluctuations in the membrane. Such destabilization would trigger fusion of two apposed bilayer membranes.",

We have recently attempted to detect the possible intermediate structure in liposomes incubated with influenza virus at acidic pH using the quick-frozen replica technique. On replicas made 30 sec after acidification at 23\u00b0C of receptor (g1ycophorin)-containing egg PC liposomes bound with influenza virus, we observed very close apposition of the virus particle and liposomes and also small 8-10 protrusions with a diameter of about 20 nm on the convex fracture face, with a complementary pit on the opposite concave face, of liposomes. No close apposition nor perturbed structures were observed on replicas obtained after incubation at neutral pH. The protrusiordpit structure may be the fusion point because of disturbance due to the high curvature (Kawasaki et a / . , 1987) . Cullis and Hope ( 1978) have proposed inverted micelles and other nonbilayer structures as the intermediate in membrane fusions. Phospholipids with larger tail to head volume ratios such as PE or cardiolipin spontaneously form nonbilayer structures under appropriate conditions (Cullis and de Kruijff, 1979) . Even PC can have a nonbilayer structure under specific conditions (Gruner et ul., 1985) . It is interesting to note that, in fusion of VSV with liposomes, the presence of cis-unsaturated fatty acyl chains in target phospholipids was required (Yamada and Ohnishi, 1986) . Also, phospholipids used in fusion studies with various enveloped viruses have been those from natural sources which contain large fractions of cisunsaturated fatty acyl chains. Cis-unsaturated phospholipids have larger tail to head volume ratios.",

(1982) . The acidification is caused by a proton pump on the vesicle membrane, and the pH value can be as low as 5.0. Envelope fusion is thus possible when the viruses arrive in endosomes before reaching the secondary lysosomes. The release of the virus genome into the cytoplasm by fusion in endosomes has been shown for SFV by Marsh et al., (1983b) and for influenza virus by Yoshimura and Ohnishi (1984) . These authors showed that the virus replication had already started after 5-7 min at 37\"C, or after 1 hr at 2 0 T , under which conditions the viruses are still in endosomes and not yet transported into secondary lysosomes, as confirmed by biochemical assays. Yoshimura and Ohnishi (1984) measured the pH of the virus environment using HA tagged with fluorescein isothiocyanate. The pH was lowered to 5.1-5.2 after 10 min at 37OC, or after I hr at 20\"C, while the viruses were in endosomes. The pH was raised to 6.7 by addition of a \"lysosomotropic\" reagent, NH,CI (20 mM), in the medium. Virus replication was inhibited in the presence of the reagent. Previous data on the inhibition by \"lysosomotropic\" reagents are not inconsistent with genome release from endosomes, since the reagents rapidly penetrate and raise the endosomal pH as well as the lysosomal pH as shown above. The pH value in the ordinate in Fig. 7 may well represent the endosomal pH. The lysosomotropic reagents are also endosomotropic, and thus are more generally termed acidotropic reagents (de Duve et d., 1974) .",

Not only enveloped viruses but also naked viruses may enter cells from acidic endosomes, as suggested for adenovirus (FitzGerald e t a / . , 1983; Yoshimura, 1985) and poliovirus (Madshus et al., 1984) . A polypeptide toxin, diphtheria toxin, also enters the cytoplasm through acidic endosomes (Sandvig and Olsnes, 1980) . Membrane fusions and splittings occur frequently in endocytic processing and in the transport of newly synthesized proteins, lipids, and other materials to organelles, the plasma membrane, and the external media. These membrane fusions may be mediated by some specific proteins. It would not be unreasonable to imagine that the virus fusion proteins originate from such cellular fusion proteins.",
