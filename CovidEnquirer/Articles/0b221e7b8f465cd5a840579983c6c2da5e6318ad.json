Objectives: We developed a sensitive, specific, and quantitative real-time PCR assay based on the TaqMan method for HBoV detection and quantification in respiratory specimens. Study design: Three individual real-time PCR assays were designed to amplify HBoV NS1, NP-1, and VP1 genes. For clinical evaluation, 506 nasal aspirates obtained from patients with acute respiratory tract infections during December 2006 to May 2007 were tested. Results: Each assay had a broad dynamic range (50 \u00d7 10 7 to 5 \u00d7 10 7 copies of plasmid DNA) and high inter-and intra-assay reproducibility. The detection limit of each assay was 10 genome copies per reaction, and no crossreactivity with other major respiratory viruses or bacteria was detected. Clinical evaluation revealed that 11 (2.1%) of 506 patients diagnosed with upper respiratory tract infections, pneumonia, bronchitis, pharyngitis, or sinusitis had HBoV detected by all three assays, with viral loads ranging from 8.2 \u00d7 10 4 to 8.1 \u00d7 10 9 copies/ml of specimen. Conclusions: The three assays for HBoV diagnosis and quantification are highly sensitive, specific real-time tools for the reliable epidemiological and pathogenetic study of HBoV infection.",

Positive criteria defined that all three primer-probe sets were positives with more than 10 copies of each target. RT-PCR results for other common respiratory viruses indicated that 80 (15.8%) specimens were positive for rhinovirus, 42 (8.3%) for influenza virus A, 19 (3.7%) for RSV, 4 (0.8%) for adenovirus, 2 (0.4%) for influenza virus B, 1 (0.2%) for parainfluenza virus, and 1 (0.2%) for coronavirus OC43. Among 11 patients who gave HBoV-positive specimens, two patients were coinfected with RSV and one patient with rhinovirus. Interestingly, one sam- ple, which was not positive by conventional PCR, contained a mean of 8.2 \u00d7 10 4 copies/ml of HBoV in real-time PCR assays. Considering all positive assays, the clinical specimen detection limit was around 10 genome copies.

As in a previous report, we were careful to prevent possible contamination of the PCR, so preparation of the PCR premix, control plasmid DNA, and clinical sample processing were performed in a separate room (Lu et al., 2006) . Moreover, the real-time PCR is performed in a closed system, and UNG was added to the PCR master mix as another level of control for amplicon contamination (Espy et al., 2006) .

Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to identify HBoV infection in adults in Korea. Previously, Lu et al. (2006) reported that HBoV PCR-positive patients with pneumonia had a relatively low viral load. Although more clinical data should be required to interpret correlation between pathogenesis and the viral load, the real-time assays described in this study would provide useful tools for analysis of clinical and molecular epidemiological investigation of HBoV infection.",
