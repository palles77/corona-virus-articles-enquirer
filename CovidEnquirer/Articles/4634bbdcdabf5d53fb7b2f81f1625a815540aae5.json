            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an infectious disease characterised by substantial morbidity and mortality, first recognised after an outbreak in 2002-2003. 1, 2 The WHO issued a global alert on SARS on March 12, 2003 after receiving reports from China's Guangdong province, Hong Kong, and Vietnam regarding clusters of respiratory illness of unknown aetiology. One of the first reports was made by WHO scientist Carlo Urbani, who was called to investigate cases of pneumonia of unclear aetiology in a hospital in Hanoi; he later died of SARS. 3 Following the WHO alert, probable SARS cases were also reported from other regions in China, and other Asian countries including Singapore, Taiwan, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines. Other countries, including Canada, the USA, and Germany also identified cases. In retrospect, SARS originated in Guangdong at the end of 2002. It first spread to other regions in Asia and then international travel facilitated its spread to other continents. A cumulative total of 8096 probable cases of SARS were recorded during the period from November 1, 2002 to July 31, 2003 , with 774 deaths in 29 countries. 4 Soon after SARS was identified as a new disease, the WHO initiated a collaborative global network striving to work together to identify the aetiological agent of SARS. 5 In unprecedented time, a novel coronavirus-SARS coronavirus-was identified as the probable causative agent of SARS 6-8 (figure 1) and Koch's principles were demonstrated to be fulfilled by this agent. 10, 11 This virus belongs to the coronavirus family-enveloped, positive-sense RNA viruses 12 associated with respiratory disease in human beings and animals. 13, 14 Evidence suggests that SARS coronavirus originated from SARS-like viruses in animals in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong; the most frequently implicated animal is the Himalayan palm civet, an animal found in food markets and eaten as a delicacy. 15, 16 SARS coronavirus is organised into 13-15 open reading frames (ORFs) containing approximately 30 000 nucleotides. 8, 17, 18 In total, 61 SARS-coronavirus sequences derived from different SARS epidemic phases have been analysed and genotypes characteristic of each phase have been identified. 19, 20 The different SARS-coronavirus ORFs represent typical viral genes such as protease and replicase, spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid, all of which may represent potential therapeutic targets (figure 2). In common with all infections caused by coronaviruses, after infection SARS coronavirus induces the synthesis of 3\u0408 coterminal sets of subgenomic mRNAs in target",

            "text": "The causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which affected over 8000 individuals worldwide and was responsible for over 700 deaths in the 2002-2003 outbreak, is a coronavirus that was unknown before the outbreak. Although many different treatments were used during the outbreak, none were implemented in a controlled fashion. Thus, the optimal treatment for SARS is unknown. Since the outbreak, much work has been done testing new agents against SARS using in-vitro methods and animal models. In addition, global research efforts have focused on the development of vaccines against SARS. Efforts should be made to evaluate the most promising treatments and vaccines in controlled clinical trials, should another SARS outbreak occur. cells. 21 In laboratory settings, SARS coronavirus is able to infect macaque monkeys, 11 mice, 22 ferrets, and domestic cats. 23 Clinically, SARS is characterised by systemic symptoms such as fever and myalgia, followed by respiratory symptoms including a non-productive cough and dyspnea. Laboratory findings include lymphopenia, and chest radiographs commonly exhibit unilateral or bilateral infiltrates. Approximately 15% of cases deteriorate, requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. 24 The overall mortality rate has been reported to be about 10%. However, SARS mortality rates in those over 60 years old have been reported to be as high as 50%. 25 Affected children seemed to have milder symptoms with no reports of death. 26 At the time of the 2002-2003 outbreak, physicians shared their personal experiences supporting or rejecting various treatments for SARS. Because of the rapid progression of the outbreak, multicentre, randomised, controlled interventional trials were not possible, and the success of various treatments remains largely anecdotal. Thus, a consensus on therapeutic strategies has not yet been reached. Since the outbreak, global research efforts have focused on testing new agents against SARS with in-vitro methods and animal models. In addition, much effort has been placed on developing effective vaccines against SARS. This review summarises the clinical experience of the use of various treatments during the outbreak and provides an overview of the data, both in vitro and in vivo, supporting, or otherwise, the effectiveness of these treatments and those that have been proposed since the outbreak. In addition, we summarise the progress made to date regarding SARS vaccines.",

            "text": "Case reports and case series suggest that combined treatments including ribavirin may be beneficial to some extent; however, in all of these studies, the effect of ribavirin is confounded by the concomitant use of other agents. For example, studies describe clinical and radiological improvements in patients treated with ribavirin and steroids, 29,30 but, without a control group, it is difficult to determine whether the improvements result from ribavirin, steroids, the combination of both, or the natural course of the illness. One study showed that the delayed initiation of combined therapy with ribavirin and steroids was among the risk factors associated with severe complicated disease, suggesting that ribavirin might be beneficial, but it is difficult to delineate the role of delaying the use of ribavirin from the delay in the use of steroids. 31 The results of a randomised clinical study in Guangdong, involving multiple different treatment arms, suggest that ribavirin given at a low dose (400-600 mg/day) was less effective compared with an early and aggressive use of steroids with interferon alfa. 32 However, the lack of a control arm in this study does not allow for one to make definitive conclusions about whether or not ribavirin has any positive effect on SARS compared with no treatment. Invitro testing showed that ribavirin was not able to inhibit SARS-coronavirus replication at clinically achievable concentrations. 33, 34 This finding, combined with postmortem findings demonstrating high viral loads in most patients despite treatment with ribavirin, 35 suggests that if ribavirin has any effect against SARS coronavirus, it is likely to have only a small beneficial effect at best. This is important when the side-effects that have been associated with ribavirin use are considered. Knowles and co-workers reported common adverse events in 110 people with suspected or probable SARS who were treated with ribavirin. 36 61% of these people had evidence of haemolytic anaemia; hypocalcaemia and hypomagnesaemia were reported in 58% and 46% of the people, respectively.",

The lopinavir/ ritonavir combination was first considered a potentially useful treatment after in-vitro studies showed it had antiviral activity against SARS coronavirus. 37, 38 Chan and colleagues 38 compared outcomes in people who received lopinavir/ritonavir as initial treatment, and as rescue therapy, with matched controls; all patients were given ribavirin and steroids according to a standardised protocol. The addition of lopinavir/ritonavir as initial treatment was associated with a statistically significant reduction in the overall death rate and intubation rate compared with matched controls (p\u03fd0\u00b705). However, the subgroup that received lopinavir/ritonavir as rescue therapy did not show a significant difference in these endpoints. Chu and co-workers 37 also assessed treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir compared with historic controls; all patients were also treated with ribavirin and steroids in a similar protocol to that of Chan and collegues. Adverse events (development of acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS] or death within 21 days) were significantly lower in the lopinavir/ritonavir group than in the historic controls (p\u03fd0\u00b7001). In addition, a significant reduction in the need for rescue pulsed steroids for severe respiratory deterioration (p\u03fd0\u00b7001) and significantly lower nosocomial infections were also noted in those treated with lopinavir/ritonavir, compared with controls (p\u03fd0\u00b7043). By multivariate analysis, it was demonstrated that the lack of treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir, age 60 years old or greater, and positive hepatitis B carrier status were independent predictors of an adverse outcome including death or the development of ARDS requiring intensive care within 21 days of onset of illness. 37 Based on these studies, lopinavir/ritonavir appears to be a promising anti-SARScoronavirus agent. Other protease inhibitors have been studied in vitro for potential antiviral effects in SARS. For example, Yamamoto and colleagues 39 screened a set of compounds that included antiviral drugs already widely used, and found that nelfinavir strongly inhibited SARScoronavirus replication. Nelfinavir inhibited the cytopathic effect induced by SARS-coronavirus infection, and the expression of viral antigens was much lower in infected cells treated with nelfinavir than in untreated, infected cells. In addition, Barnard and colleagues 40 found that two protease inhibitors-calpain inhibitor VI (Val-Leu-CHO) and calpain inhibitor III (Z-Val-Phe-Ala-CHO)-inhibited SARS coronavirus, suggesting that other protease inhibitors may also be useful in the treatment of SARS.",

The three siRNAs also inhibited the infection and replication of different strains of SARS coronavirus, indicating that siRNAs targeting the replicase 1A region may be an option for future clinical use. 52",

Ho and co-workers 66 retrospectively compared the clinical and radiographic outcomes of people with probable SARS who received ribavirin, 17 of whom initially received pulsed, highdose steroids and 55 of whom initially received lowdose steroids. Pulsed, high-dose steroids were also given to any patient as rescue therapy in the presence of deteriorating respiratory status. The cumulative steroid dose, intensive care unit admission rate, need for mechanical ventilation, and mortality rates were similar in both groups after 21 days. However, those people initially given pulsed steroids required less oxygen and had earlier radiographic improvement. In addition, they required substantially less rescue pulsed steroids. This study suggests that early initiation of pulsed steroids may have a role in the treatment of SARS. However, definitive studies are needed and the potential benefits of steroids must be compared with the associated risks, such as the development of avascular necrosis, secondary sepsis, and fatal aspergillosis, some of which have been described in people with SARS. 67, 68 In Beijing, Hong and Du 69 evaluated 67 people with SARS who had received steroids and ribavirin, and who presented with largejoint pain, potentially caused by avascular necrosis, between March and May 2003.

Loutfy and colleagues 73 described their clinical experience with interferon alfacon 1-a recombinant, non-naturally occurring type 1 interferon containing common aminoacids from several natural interferon alfa subtypes-in 22 people with probable SARS treated in an open-label study in Toronto. 13 people with SARS who received treatment with steroids alone were compared with nine people who received steroids plus interferon alfacon 1. The group treated with interferon alfacon 1 had significantly improved oxygen saturation levels (p=0\u00b702) and a more rapid resolution of radiographic lesions. In addition, this group exhibited substantially less elevation in creatine kinase levels and a trend towards a more rapid normalisation of lactate dehydrogenase levels. 73 However, this group also received higher doses of steroids, so it is difficult to determine whether or not the beneficial effects were due to the interferon alfacon 1.",
