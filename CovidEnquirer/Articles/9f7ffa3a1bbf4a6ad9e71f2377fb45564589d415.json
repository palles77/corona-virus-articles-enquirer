            "text": "Enteritis in cats is caused by infectious agents (viruses, bacteria, and parasites), with parasites being the primary cause of diarrhea, especially among strays. Intestinal helminths (e.g., nematodes, trematodes, and cestodes) have been identified in the feline alimentary system [1] . Within the trematodes, 26 species have been detected in cats in Korea: 10 species by 2000 [2] [3] [4] [5] , 15 species in 2005 [6] , and 1 species in 2009 [7] . The intestinal trematode Neodiplostomum seoulense (formerly Fibricola seoulensis), which is closely related to Pharyngostomum cordatum (Digenea: Diplostomidae), causes serious diarrhea and enteritis in human and laboratory animals, including rats and mice [8] . The snake, Rhabdophis tigrina, serves as a second intermediate host of these 2 species of trematode [9] . P. cordatum infects carnivorous mammals worldwide. Domestic and wild cats act as the definitive hosts of this fluke, whose adults parasitize the small intestines of cats. The intermediate hosts, from which the parasite infects cats, are tad-poles, frogs, and frog-eating animals, including certain snakes [10] . Infection by this fluke in cats has been widely reported in Germany, Romania, China, Japan, and India [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . In the Republic of Korea (Korea), P. cordatum was first recovered in the small intestines of cats from Seoul [16] . The prevalence of this fluke in cats in Korea has been reported [6, 17] . However, no studies have described the pathology of P. cordatum infection in domestic felines. Here, we present the first clinical case of necrotizing enteritis caused by this fluke in a stray cat in Korea.",

In this case, we did not have access to exact clinical symptoms because the cat was found after death. Although viruses and bacteria are also capable of causing diarrhea in cats, and the enteritis presented in this case study is similar to parvoviral enteritis, screening did not detect any viral or bacterial presence. We concluded that the pathology observed in the dead cat originated from P. cordatum infection, as it was the only etiological agent identified.",

Thus, the morphology of the egg and adult is already known [16, 19] . Although we could not obtain fecal samples, we identified adult parasites in the small intestine using direct microscopy and PCR. The morphological characteristics we recorded for P. cordatum from microscopic analysis are consistent with previous description [16] . Moreover, our successful PCR identification of this parasite suggests that molecular techniques would enable rapid diagnosis of P. cordatum infection in domestic and wild cats, whether from fecal or tissue samples.",

The parasite has been detected in 63/438 (14.4%) feral cats from Busan [6] and 3/41 (7.3%) feral cats from Seoul [5] . Thus, P. cordatum infection is an endemic feline disease in Korea, and the parasite should be considered one of the most important for cats. We recommend that veterinarians take care to distinguish P. cordatum infection from other causes of enteric disease in cats of Korea. Stray cats can act as reservoirs, carriers, transmitters, and definitive hosts for many intestinal parasites, including those that are potentially zoonotic. Although no known cases of P. cordatum infection in humans have been reported, we cannot exclude the possibility of P. cordatum zoonosis [19] . Thus, continuous monitoring of intestinal parasites in stray cats is necessary to allow for early diagnosis and control measures in domestic animals and wildlife of Korea.",
