WHO has declared 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19), caused by SARS-CoV-2, a public health emergency of international concern. In contrast to severe acute respiratory system coronavirus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, more deaths from COVID-19 have been caused by multiple organ dysfun ction syndrome rather than respiratory failure, 2 which might be attributable to the widespread distribution of angiotensin con verting enzyme 2-the functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2in multiple organs. 3, 4 Patients with cancer are more susceptible to infection than individuals without cancer because of their systemic immunosuppressive state caused by the malignancy and anticancer treat ments, such as chemotherapy or surgery. [5] [6] [7] [8] Therefore, these patients might be at increased risk of COVID-19 and have a poorer prognosis.",

This study is supported by the China National Science Foundation In modern society, it is accepted that individuals have the right to die with dignity. Since 1976, in the USA, people who are incarcerated have a limited constitutional right to health care, consistent with the Eighth Amendment. At present, there are more than 2600 incarcerated men and women in the USA who have been sentenced to death, most of whom have less than a high school diploma or High School Equivalency Certificate (GED), and are disproportionately of minority racial or ethnic backgrounds (42% African-American representation on death row vs 13% African-American representation in the US census). 1 The combination of poor health status, social determinants of health, and paucity of adequate care provided in correctional facilities is driving a public health emergency, which is endangering the North American incarcerated population. We can expect the prevalence and burden of chronic illness to rise concomitantly with the growth of the ageing population in US prisons. 2 Data suggest that cancer is the leading cause of illness-related deaths in US state prisons. 2 In the absence of reform, the mass incarceration trends observed over the past three decades will substantially widen disparities, adversely affecting access to health care.",

This increase will be accompanied by the inevitable debate over the appropriate health care, both legally and morally, for those with end-stage cancer. This dilemma is bound to have a downstream effect on patients with cancer who have been sentenced to death and can affect the quality of palliative care provided in correctional facilities. In the community, a multidisciplinary team would manage the medical, mental health, and social service needs of a patient who chooses palliative care for a terminal diagnosis. But what of the patient who is sentenced to die by judicial execution? That any such person should receive a benefit of any sort, including the traditional last meal, is met with public protest and outrage. Such consternation will probably increase despite the fact that denying palliative care results in unnecessary suffering for the patient at no benefit to public safety.",

            "text": "). Lung cancer was the most frequent type (five [28%] of 18 patients). Four (25%) of 16 patients (two of the 18 patients had unknown treatment status) with cancer with COVID-19 had received chemotherapy or surgery within the past month, and the other 12 (75%) patients were cancer survivors in routine followup after primary resection. Compared with patients without cancer, patients with cancer were older (mean age 63\u00b71 years [SD 12\u00b71] vs 48\u00b77 years [16\u00b72]), more likely to have a history of smoking (four [22%] of 18 patients vs 107 [7%] of 1572 patients), had more polypnea (eight [47%] of 17 patients vs 323 [23%] of 1377 patients; some data were missing on polypnea), and more severe baseline CT manifestation (17 [94%] of 18 patients vs 1113 [71%] of 1572 patients), but had no signifi cant differences in sex, other baseline symptoms, other comorbidities, or baseline severity of x-ray (appendix p 2). Most importantly, patients with cancer were observed to have a higher risk of severe events (a composite endpoint defined as the percentage of patients being admitted to the intensive care unit requiring invasive ventilation, or death) compared with patients without cancer (seven [39%] of 18 patients vs 124 [8%] of 1572 patients; Fisher's exact p=0\u00b70003). We observed similar results when the severe events were defined both by the above objective events and physician evaluation (nine [50%] of 18 patients vs 245 [16%] of 1572 patients; Fisher's exact p=0\u00b70008). Moreover, patients who underwent chemotherapy or surgery in the past month had a numerically higher risk (three [75%] of four patients) of clinically severe events than did those not receiving chemotherapy or surgery (six [43%] of 14 patients; figure). These odds were further confirmed by logistic regression (odds ratio [OR] 5\u00b734, 95% CI 1\u00b780-16\u00b718; p=0\u00b70026) after adjusting for other risk factors, including age, smoking history, and other comorbidities. Cancer history represented the highest risk for severe events (appendix p 3). Among patients with cancer, older age was the only risk factor for severe events (OR 1\u00b743, 95% CI 0\u00b797-2\u00b712; p=0\u00b7072). Patients with lung cancer did not have a higher probability of severe events compared with patients with other cancer types (one [20%] of five patients with lung cancer vs eight [62%] of 13 patients with other types of cancer; p=0\u00b7294). Additionally, we used a Cox regression model to evaluate the time-dependent hazards of developing severe events, and found that patients with cancer deteriorated more rapidly than those without cancer (median time to severe events 13 days [IQR 6-15] vs 43 days [20-not reached]; p<0\u00b70001; hazard ratio 3\u00b756, 95% CI 1\u00b765-7\u00b769, after adjusting for age;",
