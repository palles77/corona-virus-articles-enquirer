Interleukin 2 (IL-2) is one such key cytokine. Ferret recombinant IL-2 incorporating a C-terminal histidine tag was expressed and purified and the three-dimensional structure solved and refined at 1.89 \u00c5 by X-ray crystallography, which represents the highest resolution and first non-human IL-2 structure. While ferret IL-2 displays the classic cytokine fold of the four-helix bundle structure, conformational flexibility was observed at the second helix and its neighbouring region in the bundle, which may result in the disruption of the spatial arrangement of residues involved in receptor binding interactions, implicating subtle differences between ferret and human IL-2 when initiating biological functions. Ferret recombinant IL-2 stimulated the proliferation of ferret lymph node cells and induced the expression of mRNA for IFN-g and Granzyme A.",

            "text": "Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a pleiotropic cytokine that plays a key role in the regulation of T cell homoeostasis and self-tolerance. While mice that lack IL-2 (Il-2 \u00c0/\u00c0 ) are not immunosuppressed, they exhibit a number of phenotypes that point to immunological dysfunction (Schorle et al., 1991) . Serum IgM levels are unaffected, but IgG 1 levels are suppressed >20-fold, suggesting impaired CD4 \u00fe T cell helper function, despite no overt change in the profile of the major T cell compartments in the thymus and peripheral lymphoid tissues. Similarly, Il-2 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice recover from infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) despite a significant reduction (up to 90%) in the generation of virus-specific cytotoxic CD8 \u00fe T cells (Cousens et al., 1995; Kundig et al., 1993) . However, the absence of IL-2 results in the inability to mount an effective secondary response, a reflection of the failure of memory cell expansion upon challenge (D'Souza and Lefrancois, 2003; Williams et al., 2006) . Paradoxically, over time, a lack of IL-2 is associated with the development of a fatal, multi-organ autoimmune disease, characterised by the polyclonal activation of B and T cells, and the production of autoantibodies (Sadlack et al., 1995 (Sadlack et al., , 1993 ). This lack of immunological self-tolerance has been identified as being caused by the absence of CD4 \u00fe CD25 \u00fe regulatory T cells, the development of which is IL-2-dependent (Almeida et al., 2002; Malek et al., 2002; Papiernik et al., 1998) . Collectively, these and many other studies have elucidated the pivotal role played by IL-2 in regulating both the effector and regulatory arms of T cell biology (Boyman and Sprent, 2012) .",

            "text": "The primary source of IL-2 is activated CD4 \u00fe T cells, although a variety of other cell types including dendritic, mast and CD8 \u00fe T cells may secrete IL-2 in response to different stimuli (Boyman and Sprent, 2012) . The high-affinity cell-surface receptor for IL-2 comprises three proteins e IL-2Ra (CD25), IL-2Rb(CD122) and the common g-chain (gc or CD132) e and is expressed on antigenactivated and regulatory T cells (Malek and Castro, 2010) . The receptor subunits IL-2Rb and gc can form a dimer that binds IL-2 with moderate affinity and signal in the absence of the IL-2Ra subunit (Boyman et al., 2006) ; nonetheless, the high-affinity, trimeric receptor complex is essential for the development of T cell homoeostasis in vivo, as mice that lack the IL-2Ra subunit are phenotypically indistinguishable from IL-2-deficient mice (Willerford et al., 1995) . The sequential assembly of the functional ligand-receptor signalling complex has been elucidated at a structural level, with the initial formation of an IL-2:IL-2Ra dimer providing a discrete interface for the recruitment of the IL-2Rb subunit, with no contact being made between the respective receptor partners (Stauber et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2005) . Within this trimeric complex, IL-2 and IL-2Rb provide a composite interface for the recruitment of the gc receptor. At a cellular level, the formation of the quaternary signalling complex results in the activation of two members of the JAK family of tyrosine kinases, JAK1 and JAK3, and signal transduction via a number of canonical pathways (Boyman and Sprent, 2012) .",

Only a handful of cell-surface markers for different cell types are available (Music et al., 2014) , while the quantitation of immune cytokines is determined only by their relative mRNA levels rather than protein levels (Carolan et al., 2014) . There is virtually no information on the use of ferretspecific or ferret cross-reactive growth additives or differentiation factors for ferret cell culture. With the recent publication of the ferret genome (Peng et al., 2014) it is hoped that the flow of reagents will increase so that much more sophisticated studies can be undertaken to follow or prevent infection. Here we describe the expression, activity and crystal structure of ferret recombinant IL-2 and show that while it has similarities to human IL-2, it retains some unique features that presumably have evolved with the species.",

The protein was purified from culture supernatant using IMAC, and the peak fraction chromatographed over a Superdex 75 gel filtration column under conditions to minimise endotoxin contamination. Three peaks were observed eluting from this column; peak 1 migrated at the column void volume (>80 kDa) and contained mainly high molecular weight host cell proteins that co-purified with multimeric ferret IL-2 during IMAC; peaks 2 and 3 migrated with apparent molecular weights of~50 kDa and~30 kDa, respectively (Fig. 1) . SDS-PAGE analysis of these peaks identified peak 2 as a covalently-associated homo-dimer of ferret IL-2, and peak 3 was monomeric ferret IL-2 which was confirmed by N-terminal amino acid sequencing, with 10 cycles giving the expected sequence of APTTSSSTK (data not shown). Under reducing conditions, monomeric ferret IL-2 migrated as a broad band adjacent to the 14 kDa molecular weight standard, consistent with a theoretical molecular weight of 16,056 Da for the His-tagged recombinant protein following removal of the signal peptide. While peak 3 (monomer) appeared homogeneous when analysed under reducing conditions (a trace of contaminating disulphide-linked dimer is seen under non-reducing conditions), additional nonspecific, higher molecular weight protein was observed in peak 2 (dimer) in addition to IL-2 (Fig. 1) . A total of 37 mg of monomeric ferret IL-2 was purified to homogeneity from a 1.6 L transient HEK 293F culture. The protein was assessed as >98% pure by SDS-PAGE analysis and had minimal endotoxin contamination (1.90 endotoxin units/mg IL-2).",

Structural superposition gave a root mean square deviation of 1.38 \u00c5 for 109 corresponding Ca atoms out of a total of 126. However, notable structural re-arrangements are observed when comparing the two structures. The second helix in molecule 1 is bent in the middle so that the helix is divided into helices B and B 0 ( Fig. 2A) . Such a bent helix is an invariable feature observed in all human IL-2 structures solved to date, no matter whether the human IL-2 is in the apo state or in complexes with the receptors (Fig. 2C ) (Arkin et al., 2003; Bazan, 1992; Rickert et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2005) . In contrast, in molecule 2 of the ferret IL-2 structure, helices B and B 0 form one straightened helix, which results from the shifting of helix A 0 towards the original position of helix B 0 (Fig. 2B) . Examination of the crystal structure indicates that the movement of the helix A 0 was caused by the approach of helix C from a neighbouring molecule due to packing contacts in the crystal. As a result of the structural adjustment, the loop regions in the middle of the two long links in molecule 2 reorganized to form an anti-parallel two-stranded bsheet (Fig. 2B) . Superposition of the two ferret IL-2 structures onto that of human IL-2 (Arkin et al., 2003) revealed root mean square deviations of 1.66 \u00c5 for 113 Ca atoms and 1.90 \u00c5 for 102 Ca atoms, for molecule 1 and 2, respectively, corroborating that the structure of molecule 1 is more similar to that of human IL-2 (Fig. 2C) .",

A distorted helix is energetically unfavourably and often caused by the existence of the proline residue as the cyclic structure of the side chain limits the conformational flexibility of the protein backbone (Piela et al., 1987) . The complex structure of human IL-2 with its a, b and g c receptors revealed that helices A 0 and B 0 (see interactions to form a \"low affinity\" complex with the alpha chain receptor as the first step of complex formation before the recruitment of the beta and gamma chains . The bound IL-2 structure in complex with the alpha chain receptor is very similar to that of its unbound state with only minor structural adaptations observed, including the partial unwinding of the first and last turn of helix A 0 and the last turn of helix B 0 (Bazan, 1992) . The well-preserved overall structure suggests that human IL-2 maintains an active conformation even in the apo state, ready to forge binding interactions with the receptor. A similar structure is observed for ferret IL-2 molecule 1, indicating the conservation of these critical functional domains. In contrast, ferret IL-2 displays greater structural flexibility as shown by the conformational change in molecule 2, induced by an approaching molecule due to crystal packing. The movement of helices A 0 and B 0 in molecule 2 of ferret IL-2 may certainly disrupt the spatial arrangement of the residues involved in receptor binding interactions. It was shown in human IL-2 that residues Phe42, Tyr45 and Leu72 form critical hydrophobic interactions with the alpha chain receptor. Again, the corresponding residues are conserved in ferret IL-2 (Fig. 3) , confirming their functional importance for engagement of the IL-2Ra, although their spatial positions are shifted in molecule 2 due to the movement of helices A 0 and B 0 . Structural alignment of ferret molecule 2 onto human IL-2 in the complex structure with the alpha chain receptor indicated that inter-atomic steric conflicts would occur between the straightened helix B 0 and the receptor.",

This replacement is probably the reason that leads to the increased conformational flexibility observed in the ferret IL-2 structure compared to the human IL2. This conformational flexibility may thus represent an intrinsic property of ferret IL-2 and structural adjustment can occur when induced by other molecules as shown above. While the bent helix may be necessary to maintain the receptor binding residues in the correct configuration, the varied structures suggest that unlike human IL-2, different states of the molecule may exist for ferret IL-2, which may implicate subtle differences between the two species IL-2's when initiating their biological functions.",
