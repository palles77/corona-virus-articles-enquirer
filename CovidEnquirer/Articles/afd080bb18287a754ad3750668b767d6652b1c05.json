Development of healthcare support systems using cloud computing is emerging as an effective solution with the benefits of better quality of service, reduced costs and flexibility. In this paper, an effective cloud computing architecture is proposed which predicts H1N1 infected patients and provides preventions to control infection rate. It consists of four processing components along with secure cloud storage medical database. The random decision tree is used to initially assess the infection in any patient depending on his/her symptoms. Social Network Analysis (SNA) is used to present the state of the outbreak. The proposed architecture is tested on synthetic data generated for two million users. The system provided 94% accuracy for the classification and around 81% of the resource utilization on Amazon EC2 cloud. The key point of the paper is the use of SNA graphs to calculate role of an infected user in spreading the outbreak known as Outbreak Role Index (ORI). It will help government agencies and healthcare departments to present, analyze and prevent outbreak effectively.",

Healthy citizens contribute to nation's development in large extent. Every government has dedicated big amount of budgets for Information Technology (IT) based healthcare support services. IT can provide efficient methods to store and convey information related to the health of every citizen. So, sincere efforts are required to provide ubiquitous healthcare support services using IT infrastructure. Major challenge in any nationwide healthcare support services is the requirement of huge amounts of storage and fast computational power along with its day-to-day maintenance issues. However, with the involvement of distributed technologies such as cloud computing, it is very easy to deploy and use IT systems with varying computational demands. Cloud computing is a highly cost effective IT paradigm which provides on-demand IT resources on a pay-asuse pricing model. Successful adoption of cloud computing by the reputed organizations has inspired researchers to provide healthcare support services over the cloud computing infrastructure [2] .",

H1N1 is an infectious virus which on spreading affects a large volume of the population. This infectious disease had affected global population in the past due to which approximately 5% of the total world's population had died and hence it had proved to be the deadliest outbreak ever. Alone in the 20th century, the H1N1 virus outbreak has occurred thrice which had affected 500 million people all over the world [1] . WHO states non-existence of primary H1N1 immunity in humans is the root cause of its epidemic. People need to get educated about precautions and handling of this deadly disease. There is a need of using both pharmaceutical as well as nonpharmaceutical strategies to decrease its harmful effects. Cloud computing technologies can be efficiently employed to prevent and keep track of this virus strain. Cloud computing provides virtually http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jocs.2015. 11 .001 1877-7503/\u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. unlimited storage, web services and processing capabilities so, huge amount of virus related data can be linked through social networking and other health aided cloud web services. Moreover, using cloud computing for healthcare support services enables an individual to manage their own health status more effectively. Vital statics of whole country regarding the epidemic at different level of abstraction can be accessed with high accuracy. Thus, cloud computing can effectively improvised the detection of H1N1 virus at its initial stages. The objectives of the study conducted in this paper is to provide feedback about the individual health condition, design effective information sharing mechanism and real-time representation of the current status of the epidemic. The designed system keeps track of the current status of this pandemic and stores all the records for later use as well. The main contribution of this work is the categorization of patients into different categories, continuous monitoring of infected patients and identifying the probability of each user in spreading or receiving the infection by analyzing his/her relationship with infected patients.",

For every user, Outbreak Role Index (ORI) is calculated which represents his/her future probability in spreading or receiving the infection. Apart from ORI, several other outbreak metrics such as centrality, cluster coefficient, edge embeddeness are also computed using Social Network Analysis. Continuous alerts in case of health threatening conditions are generated and are sent to respective patients. Information and suggestions based upon the respective H1N1 category of user are also provided. The querying capability of this system allows users to intuitively retrieve personalized information.

Lastly, use of cloud computing in the field of Bioinformatics has been provided. CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) [8] also submitted their recommendations on vaccination for H1N1 influenza virus in 2009. As the vaccination of H1N1 is highly recommended for pregnant ladies to prevent infants from infection, McMillan et al. [9] reviewed its need and safety concerns for both mother and infant. Takeda et al. [10] in 2015 studied the effect of latest H1N1 vaccination during pregnancy on both mother and infant. In 2014, WHO [1] piled up health related data for all of its 194 member countries. Progress made in health related targets and associated goals were included. Annual life expectancy and mortality rates due to improper health were estimated by WHO. Data collected by WHO indicated that there is high neonatal mortality rates in low income countries due to improper health guidance. In 2009, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) [11] also published guidelines on categorization of Influenza A (H1N1) virus infection. Based on various physiological signals, patients were screened and categorized into various categories of infection. According to these categories, relevant information and suggestions were also provided.",

[16] developed a H1N1 pandemic forecasting system based on daily influenza cases and total population in Hong Kong. They used spatial-temporal and stochastic SEIR methods to predict number of cases for next two days. In 2015, Cruz et al. [17] studied the importance of effective communication system in case of any large scale pandemic. In 2014, Wang et al. [18] examined the spread of H1N1 in 2009 for the schools of China. They found that most of the infection transmission is within the same grade and cross grade infection transmissions are very few. In 2014, Dias and Arruda [19] proposed a mathematical based cost optimization model for controlling H1N1 pandemic based on mean of finite difference method. In 2014, Cui et al. [20] demonstrated the public attention model for epidemics like H1N1 using spatial-temporal patterns. In 2014, Bdeir et al. [21] discovered some of hidden social networks between different organizations during H1N1 epidemics. They also suggested that relevant and timely exchange of information between different organizations can result in better prevention of epidemics. In 2014, Farah et al. [22] developed a dynamic epidemic model for H1N1 using a Bayesian based emulator. Emulator took basic epidemic details and time series of all reported infections to design the model. In 2013, Zhong et al. [23] compared standard as well as modified compartment model of epidemic controlling using H1N1 2009 epidemic data of Arizona state. In 2013, Duan et al. [24] applied a triple approach known as artificial societies, computational experiments and parallel execution to study and control epidemics. They used the data of H1N1 2009 outbreak in China University and examined the social network, student behavior, population distribution and contact patterns of the virus. In 2012, Yi [25] proposed an ontology driven approach in searching medical databases for case studies in H1N1 outbreaks. In 2011, Bajardi et al. [26] studied the impact of travel restriction during H1N1 2009 epidemic. They found that only restricting international travelers will not result in effective control of epidemic. However, inducing local mobility aware factors can result in reduction of infection spread. In 2009, Balcan et al. [27] modeled the critical demand and supply chain for H1N1 infections antibiotic resources. In 2009, Araz et al. [28] presented a geospatial-temporal disease model to reduce peak infection rates at any instant of a pandemic outbreak. They investigated that if school children are properly scanned and protected, pandemic influenza infections can be minimized with minimum loss of education. In 2009, Coker [29] reviewed swine flu as a communicable disease which spreads by travelling, public gatherings and direct contacts. Virus detection methods such as real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, viral culture, rapid antigen tests, immunofluorescent antibody testing were discussed. Case definition, preventions, recommendations, and efforts at global level were also provided. In 2009, Colizza et al. [30] estimated the H1N1 cases in Mexico City based on a spatially structured epidemic model. In 2009, Sloot et al. [31] developed a decision support system for coordinating any viral infection spread. It provides different type of functionalities such as personalized drug ranking, spatial, temporal, and social interactions.",

Gonzalez-Parra et al. in 2011 [33] , 2012 [34] , and 2015 [35] used spatial-temporal data, fractional order model and complex networks in distributed environment respectively for simulating any H1N1 infection outbreak. In 2011, Van den Broeck [36] studied an effective epidemic modeling and computational tool known as GLEaMViz. It provides different simulating environments as well as visualization tools to effectively represent any epidemic causes and effects. In 2012, Li et al. [37] used data driven inference algorithms to simulate the H1N1 infection outbreak. In 2012, Cheng et al. [38] demonstrated H1N1 outbreak simulations using agent based artificial transport method. In 2012, Tizzoni et al. [39] argued that mathematical based outbreak simulation's reliability is under debate. They tested reliability of Monto Carlo maximum likelihood analysis based mathematical approach using 2009 H1N1 epidemic. Results indicated that simulations were successful in predicting the outbreak spread when compared with real life data. In 2012, Zarrabi et al. [40] proposed a filter-reduction method to study the HIV infection using social interactions and genetic information. In 2014, Duan et al. [41] studied the spreading velocity of any epidemic based on topology of weighted graph created. In 2014, Mei et al.

They simulated their framework for H1N1 infection and found that infection can be controlled at low level based on decision making of individuals.",

Cloud computing concatenated with healthcare and its support services reduces management as well as maintenance costs. Certain issues such as continuous availability of e-health data and infrastructure to be used for e-health clouds such as public, private or hybrid were also highlighted. In 2014, Sood and Sandhu [49] proposed a proactive resource provisioning methodology using two-dimensional resource provisioning matrix. Resources required in the future were predicted using these matrices by the effective use of artificial neural network. Bill calculated by the cloud providers was cross-checked by independent authorities making this model more cost effective and reliable for mobile cloud users. This approach can be useful in handling mobile data traffic of pandemic outbreak entries. In 2014, Wang et al. [2] proposed a hybrid mobile cloud computing model for medical monitoring, efficient diagnosis, large scale data processing, energy efficiency and execution efficiency. They argued that using their model, patients can manage their own health status in most convenient and affordable manner. In 2014, Xu et al. [50] furnished a semantic data model in order to store and access ubiquitous Internet of Things (IoT) data. They also developed a system that supports emergency medical services and provides flexibility to the user. This method is useful in a distributed heterogeneous data environment and is beneficial for healthcare support service providers to access large ranges of data sources in the mobile application environment. In 2015, Elsebakshi et al. [51] proposed a function network based optimization method for large scale medical data.",

More ubiquitous data services for efficient monitoring and diagnosis of infections during a pandemic can be efficiently provided using cloud computing. There is a need for a system that can detect the infection in the early stages and provides continuous monitoring during outbreak. Lack of information and availability of proper treatment at the time of the outbreak is a basic challenge in traditional healthcare support systems. Next section proposes architecture for effectively controlling this deadly epidemic by seamless integration of data mining, cloud computing and social network analysis. Fig. 1 shows proposed architecture to effectively detect and monitor H1N1 virus. The data acquisition component is responsible for collecting data of multiple H1N1 and personal attributes. Data can be collected from various sources such as hospitals, individual users, RSS feeds, activity maps and government aided healthcare services. It can also be uploaded to the cloud using web browsers or mobile application. Data is stored in a cloud based repository from where retrieval of data for processing and effective decision making can be efficiently made. Community cloud is preferred for the proposed architecture so that information can be shared securely and effectively among similar groups of agencies who are involved in detecting and controlling the outbreak. Personal details of users are [11] . According to the classified infected category of user, patients are continuously monitored using monitoring component. Patients with a severe category of infection are monitored more frequently than patients with less severe category of infection. An Outbreak Role Index (ORI) is calculated to find the probability of an individual to spread or receive the infection. Different outbreak metrics are computed using SNA approach. These metrics help government agencies to access situation more effectively. Information and suggestion box stores and communicate information about nearest hospitals and government initiated swine flu camps, first aid and alert in case of health threatening conditions using email, messages, RSS feeds, etc. All component's algorithm and procedures are discussed in detail ahead.",

Table 2 shows H1N1 related attributes and their respective answers collected from every user. These attributes are classified as primary, secondary, tertiary and High Risk Condition (HRC) symptoms. Primary symptoms are the major symptoms which indicate presence of H1N1 virus infection in any patient. Secondary symptoms may be present in any patient as a consequence of primary symptoms. Tertiary symptoms are red flag signs which demonstrate more worsening conditions for a virus infected patient so that immediate hospitalization and treatment should be instructed.

A classification algorithm with high TP rate and low FP Precision and recall provides the relevancy of the classified instances. Higher the value of precision and recall, better will be classification because only relevant instances will be classified. Proposed algorithm provides very high precision and recall rate values which are 0.899 and 0.925 respectively. F-Measure is a statistical value for classification accuracy which lies between 0 and 1. Algorithm with high F-Measure value will be more accurate and our random decision tree provides F-Measure of 0.912. The high value of ROC area represents the accuracy of the proposed algorithm.

To test this performance of proposed architecture, synthetic generated H1N1 flu cases are stored over shared cloud storage provided by Amazon EC2 [54] . General purpose xlarge [54] clusters are used to set up application over the cloud. It can be accessed by multiple end users such as doctors, users, healthcare departments and government agencies. Maximum number of cases Fig. 7 . Generation of 2 millions of H1N1 cases using census data. used to test the performance levels are 50,000. Each data access request is amplified to hundred times by using a JavaScript coded in the application frontend. Total requests to the H1N1 flu database were divided at 40% of search, 35% of update, 15% of insert and 10% of deleting. Initially the system was started with 200 requests, then after each 5-min request to system was increased by 200 and system performance was studied for a total experiment time of 60 min. Fig. 5(a) shows resource utilization of the proposed architecture for different number of users. The system achieves saturation very fast when numbers of users are 16,000 because larger the database more resources will be required to perform any transaction. Similarly, change in response time is also studies for the system, shown in Fig. 5(b) . A system with less number of users provides low response time because there are fewer entries in the database to perform any operation.",

Accuracy of classification algorithm is the percentage of correct classification of uninfected and infected users in their respective category. Random decision tree starts with an accuracy rate of 80%, but as time passes its accuracy increases due to large user dataset. Fig. 6(b) shows the average time took by system for initial analysis. Large user dataset requires more time for initial analysis as depicted in the graph. It is because the system needs more time to compare its prediction with actual H1N1 case result of large user dataset. Fig. 6(c) shows the effectiveness of the system for identifying H1N1 infected patients. Total number of users it predicted as infected are very large as compared to traditional methods.
