This inhibitor, which acted primarily by blocking the attachment of virus to target cells, was named contactblocking viral inhibitor, or CVI . CVI is produced in various primary and secondary cell lines of human and murine origin, and continuous human, mouse, sheep, and rabbit cell lines' (J . Youngner, personal communication) . The level of antiviral activity produced varies 40-fold between low and high producing cell lines . Primary mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEF), after several passages, have been shown to consistently produce significant CVI activity (24-64 units/ml), which has been used for partial purification and characterization of CVI .\" $ Production of CVI is independent of cell density and subculturing protocols, except, as noted above, MEF produce CVI after several passages . Additionally, it is produced constitutively and rapidly with significant levels observed in culture supernatants from cell monolayers beginning within 1 h of washing with fresh media .` Spontaneous and continuous production is also suggested since inhibiting macromolecular synthesis by treating cells with actinomycin D or cyclohexamide blocks the appearance of the inhibitor .' 239 As shown in Table 1 , CVI possesses a broad but not universal antiviral activity . Significant antiviral activity is observed against representative DNA, and enveloped and non-enveloped RNA viruses (herpes and poxviruses, picorna, alpha and rhabdoviruses) . The lack of significant antiviral activity against NDV distinguishes CVI from non-specific inhibitors found in tissues and physiological fluids (UTI a and UTI which are discussed later in this review . A critical difference between CVI and another broadly antiviral substance, interferon, is the absence of species specificity of CVI .' \u20223",

Significant antiviral activity was detected in the aqueous fractions (e .g . 48\u00b16 anti-NDV units/ml in the infant formulas), which had undergone high heat treatment during manufacture .

However, different modes of action were detected in studies of VSV, varicella zoster [VZ], influenza A, and HIV . VSV was inhibited at an early, post-penetration step in the viral infection, as judged by greater inhibition of VSV at 37\u00b0 vs 4\u00b0C and time of virus escape from inhibition during timed addition of inhibitor to virus infected monolayers (unpublished observations) .

UTI /3 differs from CVI and UTI a in size, themostability, and chemical nature ( Table 2 ; unpublished observations) . UTI /3 appears to have a native molecular size in the range of 60-90 kDa, based on HPLC size exclusion chromatography, and shows moderate heat stability, being denatured by treatment at 80\u00b0C for greater than 10 min (unpublished observations) . UTI /3 possesses a protein component which is not essential for antiviral activity, unlike UTI x which is protein free, and CVI, which has essential protein . UTI /3 shows antiviral activity against enveloped and nonenveloped RNA and enveloped DNA viruses ( Table 1 ) . The inhibitory activity varies with the virus used and ranges from 8 to 144 U/ml but is uniformly higher for enveloped RNA viruses . Human serum also contains a smaller broadly active viral inhibitor, which passes through dialysis tubing of 12-14 kDa retention and constitutes about 10-20% of total virus inhibiting activity . (Approximately 80-90% of the non-specific antiviral activity is retained under the same conditions and represents the protein-bound antiviral activity of 60-90 kDa which we identify as UTI /3 .) In light of the presence of the minor, small molecular weight serum activity, we routinely remove that component before analysis of UTI /3 . Thus, in all experiments summarized here characterizing UTI /3, serum was first exhaustively dialysed to remove the small molecular weight antiviral component .",

One inhibitor, CVI, is produced spontaneously by a number of cell cultures, is 3000-4000 kDa and contains essential peptide and probably carbohydrate structure . The concentrations of CVI normally present in producing cultures can inhibit susceptible viruses up to 10000-fold when low multiplicities of infection are used to infect cell cultures .' The second inhibitor, UTI a, is found in several body secretions and tissue extracts, is less than 3 kDa, and appears to contain essential carbohydrate structure . A third antiviral inhibitor, UTI /3, is found in human serum, is approximately 60-90 kDa and is probably composed of essential carbohydrate and protein that is not essential for inhibitory activity . Proteolysis of UTI f3 appears to convert the inhibitor to a form that may resemble UTI a . The mechanisms of antiviral action of the three inhibitors against most viruses appear to be inhibition of the viral attachment step, but UTI a and /3 may also inhibit other stages in the replication of some viruses like herpesviruses and influenza virus . The majority of contacts with viral pathogens do not lead to clinical infections . This resistance suggests possible natural defensive roles for inhibitors like UTI a and f3, which is consistent with their presence at important body sites prior to and during infection, and their relatively strong antiviral effects . Further evidence for a natural defensive role would require transfer and deletion studies .",
