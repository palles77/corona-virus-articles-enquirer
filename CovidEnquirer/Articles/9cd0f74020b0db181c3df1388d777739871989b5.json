            "text": "Electrification is widely considered as a viable strategy for reducing the oil dependency and environmental impacts of road transportation. In pursuit of this strategy, most attention has been paid to electric cars. However, substantial, yet untapped, potentials could be realized in urban areas through the large-scale introduction of electric two-wheelers. Here, we review the environmental, economic, and social performance of electric two-wheelers, demonstrating that these are generally more energy efficient and less polluting than conventionallypowered motor vehicles. Electric two-wheelers tend to decrease exposure to pollution as their environmental impacts largely result from vehicle production and electricity generation outside of urban areas. Our analysis suggests that the price of e-bikes has been decreasing at a learning rate of 8%. Despite price differentials of 5000 \u00b1 1800 EUR 2012 kW h \u00c01 in Europe, e-bikes are penetrating the market because they appear to offer an apparent additional use value relative to bicycles. Mid-size and large electric two-wheelers do not offer such an additional use value compared to their conventional counterparts and constitute niche products at price differentials of 700 \u00b1 360 EUR 2012 kW \u00c01 and 160 \u00b1 90 EUR 2012 kW \u00c01 , respectively. The large-scale adoption of electric two-wheelers can reduce traffic noise and road congestion but may necessitate adaptations of urban infrastructure and safety regulations. A case-specific assessment as part of an integrated urban mobility planning that accounts, e.g., for the local electricity mix, infrastructure characteristics, and mode-shift behavior, should be conducted before drawing conclusions about the sustainability impacts of electric two-wheelers.",

In pursuit of these objectives, mass-produced battery-electric cars were introduced to the http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trd.2015.09.007 1361-9209/\u00d3 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The number of manufacturers and the diversity of models offered has been growing since. However, battery-electric cars are still relatively expensive and suffer from short drive ranges and the absence of a widespread recharging infrastructure. It appears questionable whether battery-electric cars can penetrate the market at a large scale without policy support or substantially increasing oil prices (Weiss et al., 2012) . More, immediate potentials for the electrification of road transport, notably in urban areas, may be offered by electric two-wheelers such as e-bikes, escooters, and e-motorcycles.",

Fully-charged drive ranges of 20-160 km (Weinert et al., 2007b; Eicher, 2010; ZM, 2013) appear to be sufficient for urban operations, where trips typically remain within a distance of 10 km (e.g., Weinert et al., 2007c; Hendriksen et al., 2008; ITRANS, 2009; Delcampe, 2010; Paffumi et al., 2013) .

First, the bulk of the literature on electric two-wheelers addresses this vehicle category. Second, e-bikes outsell globally any other category of electric two-wheelers and currently seize a rapidly growing market in Europe. The results of our research can provide rationale for (i) designing energy and transportation policies and (ii) advancing vehicle technology and urban transportation infrastructure with the objective of making road transportation more sustainable.",

We do not explicitly address electric three-and four-wheelers (categories L2e, L5e-L7e; EC, 2013) because of their minor importance in Europe (ACEM, 2013b) . We consider in our review (i) peer-reviewed articles that are available through the academic search engines web of science and scopus and (ii) scientific reports and presentations, workshop documents, and working papers that are publicly available online. We conduct our online search by using the key words: ''electric two-wheelers\", ''pedelecs\", ''e-bikes\", ''e-scooters\", and ''e-motorcycles\" in combination with the terms ''costbenefit\", ''economic performance\", ''financial performance\", ''environmental impacts\", ''life cycle assessment\", and ''safety\". We identify around 60 relevant documents that were published before April 2013 in English, German, and Dutch. As mentioned, our assessment focuses on e-bikes but also seeks to benchmark the environmental, economic, and social performance of mid-size and large electric two-wheelers against conventional modes of passenger transport. Given the limited information on mode-shift behavior (see Table A3 in Appendix), we abstain from presenting pairwise comparisons (e.g., e-bike versus bicycle) but instead display absolute results for various electric and conventional modes of passenger transport.",

Technological improvement: Between 1990 and 2006, the introduction of valve-regulated lead-acid batteries increased the energy density by 30% and the battery life time by 160%, resulting in larger drive ranges and lower maintenance costs; the introduction of brushless motors and neodymium magnets increased the lifetime, power output, and efficiency of electric motors. Price reduction: E-bike prices declined by one third between 1999 and 2006 (Bento, 2012) driven by technological learning, innovation, economies of scale, and enhancing market competition. Favorable transportation infrastructure: Public transportation appeared often inconvenient, while individual transportation suffered from road congestions. At the same time, a dedicated bicycle infrastructure was available in many cities. Favorable socio-economic and cultural conditions: Decreasing electricity prices and increasing gasoline prices have been accompanied by rising household income and an increasing need for mobility. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002 accelerated the mode shift from public transportation to e-bikes, supported by a wide-spread cycling culture.",

Compared to conventionally-powered two-wheelers, the environmental impacts of electric two-wheelers are shifted from vehicle use to vehicle production, end-of-life treatment, and electricity generation. Electric twowheelers, just as battery-electric cars, shift the environmental impacts of motorized transport away from numerous and difficult-to-control vehicles to less numerous and more concentrated point sources, predominantly located outside of urban areas (Cherry, 2007) . Such relocation decreases human exposure to pollution, and can be expected, ceteris paribus, to decrease the detrimental health impacts of road transportation (Cherry, 2007; Ji et al., 2012) .

While losses from the extraction of energy resources, electricity transmission, and vehicle recharging are typically small but not negligible, conversion losses in the power sector may amount to 60 \u00b1 10% if electricity is produced from fossil fuels. Moreover, conversion losses can vary greatly among regions depending on the electricity mix and the efficiency of power plants. Chiu and Tzeng (1999) find that electric two-wheelers in Taiwan, with largely fossil-based electricity generation, reach a well-to-wheel efficiency of about 15%, which is similar to the efficiency of conventionally-powered motorcycles. Weinert et al. (2008) report for China a well-to-wheel energy use of small electric two-wheelers (7 \u00b1 1 kW h 100 km \u00c01 ) that is substantially lower than that of conventionally-powered two-wheelers (29 kW h 100 km \u00c01 ). The regional variability in both electricity mix and power plant efficiency demands a case-by-case assessment of the well-to-wheel energy use of electric two-wheelers. The majority of the well-to-wheel energy use of electric two-wheeler can be attributed to the well-to-tank stage, contrasting the situation for conventionally-powered vehicles that tend to consume three-fourths of their well-to-wheel energy use in the tank-to-wheel stage.",

Depending on the carbon intensity of the electricity mix, the well-to-wheel and life-cycle GHG emissions can vary substantially. The carbon intensities of electricity generation (considering gross electricity production and excluding transmission and transformation losses) in Europe range from 0 g CO 2 kW h \u00c01 in Iceland where electricity is mainly produced from hydro power to 1059 g CO 2 kW h \u00c01 in Estonia where electricity is mainly produced from coal (IEA, 2012). Gross electric energy production in the EU-27 (442 g CO 2 kW h \u00c01 ; IEA, 2012) 3 is 40% less carbon intensive than the gross electric energy production in China (790 CO 2 kW h \u00c01 ; IEA, 2012).

These preliminary findings suggest higher relative price differentials for e-bikes and mid-size electric two-wheelers than for battery-electric cars (320 \u00b1 210 EUR 2012 -kW \u00c01 ; Weiss et al., 2012) . The absolute price differentials of e-bikes (1300 \u00b1 700 EUR 2012 ), mid-size electric twowheelers (1200 \u00b1 1400 EUR 2012 ), and large electric two-wheelers (4000 \u00b1 2100 EUR 2012 ) are, however, lower than those of battery-electric cars because the former are equipped with smaller batteries. The relatively low absolute price differential may explain the rapid market penetration of e-bikes that offer an obvious additional use value compared to bicycles, i.e., power assistance. The additional use value of e-scooters and e-motorcycles, e.g., the availability of low-end torque for strong acceleration may be less apparent to consumers and may not yet justify the present price differentials.",

This observation may be attributed in part to inhomogeneities of e-bike technology, i.e., the shift from lead-acid batteries to more expensive lithium-ion and metal-hydride batteries, the increase in battery capacity, the recent introduction of LED lighting, disk brakes, and aluminum frames (Dekker, 2013) . Anecdotal evidence suggest that only a few manufacturers shared a low-volume but growing market around the year 2000 while increasing market competition only occurred after 2006. Demand-induced changes in profit margins may thus explain part of the observed price trend, including the price decrease in recent years (see Fig. 5b ).",

However, battery technology, arguably the single largest contributor to manufacturing costs, could differ between and within the individual categories of electric two-wheelers. Battery production 4 We assume here a fleet of 500,000 e-bikes, a yearly travel distance of 3800 km per e-bike, and mean life-cycle energy use and carbon emissions as depicted in Fig. 3 . 5 Prices are based on the mean and the standard deviation of data presented in Tables (Nykvist and Nilsson, 2015) . Material substitution, pack integration of cells, and economies of scale could yield future cost savings in battery manufacturing (Weinert, 2007; Nykvist and Nilsson, 2015) . We expect that research and development, technological learning, and economies of scale will drive down the future production costs to a larger extent for relatively novel lithium-ion batteries than for conventional lead-acid batteries. The total user costs, i.e., the sum of costs for purchase, maintenance, and use of e-bikes and larger electric two-wheelers are higher than those for bicycles and public transportation but comparable to conventionally-powered two-wheelers (Fig. 7) . E-bikes are less costly than any other model of individual motorized transport. We consider the results in Fig. 7 as indicative of the total user costs that are sensitive to assumptions regarding, e.g., the price of fuel and electricity, yearly mileage, and vehicle life time.",

In fact, travel speed appears to be a main factor explaining why consumers prefer electric and conventionally-powered two-wheelers over alternative transportation modes (Cherry and Cervero, 2007; Montgomery, 2010; Kopp, 2011) . With respect to electric two-wheelers, case studies indicate that e-bikes are faster than bicycles and buses in Kunming (China) but 11% slower than conventionally-powered scooters in Shanghai (China; Cherry, 2007) . E-bike trips in the Netherlands are 1.5 times longer (9.8 km) than bicycle trips, suggesting mobility benefits for citizens. The use of two-wheelers in general faces practical constraints. Literature suggests that workers in business attire, as well as citizens in need of transporting goods, commuting in the dark, or faced with bad weather are less likely to commute by bicycle (Heinen et al., 2011) .

Moreover, electric two-wheelers can help reducing urban noise pollution. E-bike users may benefit from positive cardio-vascular effects (see, e.g., de Hartog et al., 2010) . E-bikes are also considered beneficial in allowing elderly or physically impaired people to remain mobile (Hendriksen et al., 2008; MacArthur et al., 2014) . However, the operation of electric two-wheelers, just as that of conventionally-powered two-wheelers, also raises safety concerns resulting from high vehicle speed and mass and the absence of engine noise. The latter led several cities in China start banning e-bikes around the year 2006 (Cherry, 2007; Weinert et al., 2007c) .",

Users of two-wheelers are vulnerable in case of an accident (Weinert et al., 2007a; Haworth, 2012) . Death rates per distance travelled are globally 30 times higher (Johnston et al., 2008; Haworth, 2012) and in the EU 18 times higher for powered twowheeler users than for car drivers (EC, 2010) . The growing use of powered two-wheelers in the city of Paris has increased both road accidents and fatalities. However, 'Safety in number' effects are documented, suggesting that an increase in the number of bicycles and other two-wheelers leads to a less-than-proportional increase in accidents mainly due to a rising awareness of road users (Jacobsen, 2003; Buehler and Pucher, 2012; ITF, 2012) . Various technical measures are at hand to increase the user safety for both electric and conventional two-wheelers: The Netherlands (Dekker, 2013) China (Weinert, 2007) China (Cherry, 2007) Taiwan (Chiu and Tzeng, 1999) Individual conventionallymotorized transport weight reduction, e.g., by substituting lithium-ion batteries for lead-acid batteries (Rose, 2012) ; mandatory minimum noise requirements can increase audibility, thus visibility, of electric two-wheelers (Haworth, 2012) ; establishment of a dedicated infrastructure could reduce differences in the travel speed of vehicles sharing a common driveway; enforcement of speed limits, technical vehicle regulation, and improving the training of drivers to ensure the proper functioning and handling of two-wheelers.",

Although we consider our results to be robust, updating part of the presented data is recommended. Second, we assume average carbon intensities of the electricity mix when estimating the carbon emissions of electric two-wheelers. This assumption is made based on data availability, but it simplifies reality. The electricity demand of new electric two-wheelers would likely be satisfied by marginal electricity that is potentially produced by outdated and inefficient power plants that would otherwise be taken off the grid. If so, we may underestimate the primary energy use and carbon emissions associated with electric two-wheelers.

Given the regional variability in, e.g., the electricity mix, mode-shift behavior, infrastructure characteristics, and geographic and climatic conditions, the environmental, economic, and social performance of electric two-wheelers should be assessed on a case-specific basis by taking an integrated approach to urban mobility. The boom of bicycle-style and scooter-style e-bikes in China suggest that a mandatory phase out of conventionallypowered two-wheelers from urban environments is an effective measure to increase the market penetration of electric two-wheelers (Yang, 2010) . Technological learning has been decreasing the price differential of e-bikes and will likely continue to decrease absolute prices and price differentials of all categories of electric two-wheelers. Battery costs will have to decline substantially before mid-size and large electric two-wheelers will penetrate the market at large scale. A shift from cars and conventionally-powered two-wheelers to electric two-wheelers will necessitate adaptations of the existing transport and electricity infrastructure and the management of newly emerging safety issues, e.g., through the introduction of dedicated drive lanes and minimum noise requirements. The battery capacity of the global electric two-wheelers fleet (125 \u00b1 42 GW h) exceeds that of battery-electric cars (4 \u00b1 2 GW h) by a factor of 30 and constitutes a huge reservoir for technological learning, economies of scale, spill-over effects from which economy-wide battery applications in general and the electrification of transport in particular could benefit.",
