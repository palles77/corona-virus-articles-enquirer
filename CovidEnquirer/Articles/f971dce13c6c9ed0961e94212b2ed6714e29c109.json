These sites, on six continents, are selected for expertise among staff in travel medicine and tropical diseases. Although individuals visiting these clinics are not representative of all ill travelers returned from Brazil, knowledge of their diagnoses provides insights into the types of exposures and risks experienced by travelers to Brazil. In our reported series of 1586 ill travelers returned from Brazil seen from July 1997 through May 2013 at multiple sites around the world, the most common travel-related diagnoses were dermatologic conditions (40%), diarrheal syndromes (25%), and febrile systemic illness (19%).",

Dengue was much more common than malaria, being diagnosed in 31% of those with febrile systemic illness versus 8% for malaria. These two infections were also the most common reasons for hospitalization. Importantly, although cases of dengue occurred during every month of the year, dengue infections displayed marked seasonality with infections peaking in the period from February through June. Fortunately the sports events do not occur during peak dengue transmission. Nevertheless, because dengue transmission occurs widely in urban and rural areas, all travelers should be alert to the risk of dengue. The widespread day-biting Aedes aegypti mosquito is the primary vector.",
