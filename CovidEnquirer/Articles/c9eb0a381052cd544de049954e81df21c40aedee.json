An international group of experts in infectious diseases, HCT, and public health worked together to compile this document with 4 goals in mind: (1) to summarize the current available data in the field, (2) to provide evidence-based recommendations regarding prevention of infectious complications among HCT patients, (3) to serve as a reference for health care providers worldwide who care for HCT recipients, and (4) to serve as a reference for HCT recipients and their nonmedical caregivers. In updating these guidelines, the committee sought to summarize the currently available data and present them as concisely as possible in an evidence-based fashion.",

Furthermore, as with any field of medicine, published studies continue to add to the evidence regarding supportive medical care.

The definition of immune competence following transplant is loosely defined by the ability of the HCT recipient to receive live vaccine following recovery from transplant.

The goal of HCT is lifelong engraftment of the administered cells, resulting in some or all of the recipient's lymphohematopoietic system being derived from the HCT graft. Full donor engraftment occurs when the recipient lymphohematopoietic system is fully replaced by progeny of the HCT graft. This is the ultimate goal of many HCT protocols, especially for achieving optimal graft-versus-tumor (GVT) activity in patients with malignant disease [8] [9] [10] . In some clinical settings, however, a state of ''mixed chimerism,'' wherein elements of both the donor and recipient lymphohematopoietic system survive, may be sufficient to cure the underlying condition [11, 12] .",

However, because allogeneic HCT is associated with significant morbidity and mortality because of regimen-related toxicity (RRT) [18] , infection [19] , and graft versus host disease (GVHD) [20] , a recommendation regarding transplantation for the individual patient requires careful risk assessment that takes into account disease status [21] , comorbidities, previous therapies, other standard therapies available for the underlying disease [22] , donor stem cell source [23] , and histoincompatibility [24] . Autologous HCT can improve outcomes in neoplastic diseases [25] and autoimmune conditions [26] , and continues to be investigated as a platform for gene therapy [27] . RRT and infections contribute to the morbidity and mortality associated with autologous HCT; however, morbidity because of GVHD generally does not occur after this procedure. Substantial progress has been made in allogeneic HCT during the past 15 years as a result of improvements in 4 distinct, but interrelated, areas. First, improvements in the supportive care of patients with severe immunosuppression and myelosuppression have diminished morbidity and mortality because of infection [19, 28, 29] . Second, the critical contribution of immune-mediated GVT effects toward eradicating malignant disease and facilitating engraftment is now well established, and factors prominently in the design of individual HCT regimens [21] . Third, alternative donor (nonsibling) transplants and new stem cell sources now provide HCT options for a larger percentage of potential candidates [23, 30, 31] . Fourth, newer, less toxic preparative regimens have been developed that allow reliable engraftment with a lower risk for treatment-related mortality (TRM) and long-term adverse effects [18, 32] .",

In this model, the preparative regimen was used as the primary tool to eradicate malignant disease, or to eradicate the recipient's immune system when HCT was used to treat benign diseases. However, careful clinical studies over the last 4 decades have revealed that the effectiveness of allogeneic HCT in eradicating malignant disease is intimately linked to the activity of immunoreactive cells in the graft, most notably T cells and, in some cases, natural killer (NK) cells [24, 33, 34] . Indirect demonstration of this graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect comes from reports of increased leukemic relapse following syngeneic (identical twin) HCT and increased leukemia relapse following T cell-depleted HCT. Direct demonstration has been provided by the ability of donor lymphocyte infusions (DLIs) to induce remission in substantial numbers of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) [35] . Evidence for a GVT effect also exists for other malignancies [36] , but the effect appears to be less potent than that observed in CML. Furthermore, even when HCT is performed for benign diseases, the rate and degree of donor engraftment can be enhanced with the use of donor leukocyte infusions, demonstrating that immune cells also contribute to the engraftment process. Thus, HCT has evolved from a therapy designed primarily to provide lymphohematopoietic rescue after MA conditioning to a form of immunotherapy wherein mature immune cells contained within the graft and/or reconstituted from donor progenitors play an active role in eradicating the underlying neoplastic disease and in facilitating donor engraftment.",

            "text": "Expansion of graft sources has contributed to substantial progress in allogeneic HCT. Traditionally, allogeneic HCT involved transfer of marrow grafts harvested from HLA-matched sibling donors, in which case histoincompatibility was limited to minor antigens, for which reliable typing is not routinely available. Approximately 25% to 30% of potential HCT recipients will have a matched sibling donor available. Through the efforts of the NMDP in the United States and donor registries throughout the world, approximately 12 million individuals have undergone preliminary HLA typing over the last 20 years, and as a result, 75% of Caucasian individuals will find a suitably matched unrelated donor (URD). For other racial or ethnic groups, however, the chance of finding a suitable donor using existent registries is substantially less. Recent studies have demonstrated that with proper HLA matching, outcomes following matched URD HCT approach those reported for matched sibling transplants. Umbilical cord blood (UCB) transplants have also shown promise. The benefits of UCB as a stem cell source are ready accessibility and the ability to cross HLA barriers [23, 31, 37, 38] . Mismatched related and haploidentical donor grafts also continue to have a role in clinical HCT, especially for patients with congenital immunodeficiency [39] and in specialized centers where this approach continues to be optimized [40, 41] . Beyond the multitude of choices regarding donor source, progress during the last 15 years has also demonstrated that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)mobilized peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) allografts provide a reliable source for engraftment, and offer the advantage of improved myelogenous and T cell recovery [30, 42] than with traditional marrow grafts and thus fewer infections. However, G-CSF-mobilized blood grafts also appear to carry a greater risk for chronic GVHD (cGVHD) compared with marrow grafts [23, 43, 44] .",

Nonmyeloablative (NMA) preparative regimens that use cytotoxic drugs or low-dose total body irradiation (TBI) in conditioning regimens have been associated with reduced nonrelapse mortality (NRM), and have provided new options for HCT among the elderly and in patients with substantial comorbidities.

At the same time, standard treatments for many of the diseases wherein HCT historically provided the mainstay of therapy have also evolved, rendering the decision of whether, when, and how to proceed to HCT highly complex and requiring careful consideration of the individual case in light of evidence-based data. For patients who undergo HCT, the major causes of early morbidity and mortality are disease relapse, acute GVHD (aGVHD), infection, RRT, and graft failure. Long-term survivors of HCT are at risk for a variety of long-term adverse effects, including cGVHD, infections, hypothyroidism, sterility, growth failure and other endocrine distur-bances, cataracts, avascular necrosis, disease relapse, and second malignancy. The incidence of each of those adverse effects varies greatly with differing preparative regimens, comorbidities, age at transplantation, and whether the individual experiences cGVHD [49] .",

Neutrophil, monocyte, and NK-cell recovery is followed by platelet and red cell recovery, which is followed by B and T cell recovery ( Figure 1 ). Simultaneously, MA regimens damage mucosal surfaces and thereby provide a source for bloodstream seeding of commensal pathogens that inhabit the gastrointestinal tract.

With some regimens, essentially complete eradication of recipient lymphocytes is accomplished by the preparative regimen itself. However, with other regimens, depletion of recipient lymphocytes occurs more gradually via the use of donor leukocyte infusions following transplant. In both cases, the vast majority of HCT recipients experience near-total lymphocyte depletion, and thus must undergo lymphoid reconstitution via mature lymphocytes and lymphoid progenitors contained in the graft. Furthermore, except when T cell-depleted HCT grafts are administered, all allogeneic HCT recipients must also receive some form of immunosuppression to prevent GVHD, further limiting immune competence.",

In the first pathway, lymphocytes regenerate from bone marrow (BM) lymphoid progenitors, thus recapitulating ontogeny and regenerating a na\u00efve immune system, similar to that found in a newborn child [50] . NK cell recovery uses this pathway exclusively. Full recovery of NK cell counts is typically achieved within 1 to 2 months following HCT. B cells are also primarily regenerated from lymphoid progenitor cells, as evidenced by the appearance of primitive B cell subsets as the harbinger of B cell immune reconstitution [51] . Unlike NK cell recovery, however, B cell lymphopoiesis is highly dependent upon a specialized marrow microenvironment termed the ''bursal equivalent,'' which is susceptible to damage by the preparative regimen and is exquisitely sensitive to the toxic effects of GVHD and/or its treatment. Indeed, patients who experience even a limited episode of steroid-responsive GVHD show significantly diminished B cell reconstitution in the long term, compared with patients who do not experience GVHD [52] . Although recent data have demonstrated that mature B cells can also contribute to B cell reconstitution via homeostatic expansion, this pathway appears to be minor compared with the marrow-derived pathway for B cell regeneration.",

The latter occurs as a result of environmental or vaccine-based exposure to common pathogens and also requires help from CD4 1 T cells. Therefore, even HCT recipients who do not experience GVHD and who demonstrate recovery of total B cell numbers within 6 months posttransplant should not be considered to have regained full humoral immunocompetence by this time. For at least 1 year following transplantation, essentially all HCT recipients remain predisposed to infections from encapsulated bacteria and viruses, against which neutralizing antibodies provide a first line of defense. Serum IgG levels provide little insight into B cell reconstitution, because long-lived, radioresistant plasma cells survive many preparative regimens [53] and can produce substantial circulating IgG without providing humoral responses to specific pathogens. The only reliable means by which one can assess humoral immune competence following transplantation is by documenting clinically significant rises in antigen-specific antibodies following vaccination or infection. Indeed, some medical centers use a rise in antibody levels in response to administration of a killed vaccine as a prerequisite for use of live-attenuated vaccines. T cell regeneration is predominantly driven by a thymic-independent pathway, termed homeostatic peripheral expansion. Here, mature T cells contained within the graft dramatically expand in vivo in response to T cell lymphopenia. This process is driven by a combination of factors, among which are increased availability of homeostatic cytokines, including interleukin (IL)-7 and IL-15, which accumulate during lymphopenia; inflammatory cytokines associated with tissue damage induced by the preparative regimen; and exposure to viral antigens (either environmentally or via reactivation) during the period of profound lymphopenia. Peripheral homoeostatic expansion is much more efficient for CD8 1 T cells than for CD4 1 T cells [54] , resulting in chronically reduced CD4/CD8 ratios in HCT recipients for several months following HCT. Memory T cells are the first to expand after HCT, and may be either of donor origin, in the case of non-T cell-depleted HCT, or originate from host T cells that have survived the conditioning regimen, in the case of T cell-depleted HCT [55] . Memory T cells respond quickly to previously encountered pathogens such as herpesviruses.",

When T cell regeneration occurs via the ontogenic or thymic-dependent pathway, there is a substantial rise in CD4 1 T cell numbers, with recovery of na\u00efve CD4 1 and CD8 1 T cells and diversification of the T cell repertoire [60] .

First and foremost is the profound adverse effect of GVHD on the overall process. In essentially every series, GVHD severity correlates with the degree of immunosuppression and infectious complications. This correlation is because of a variety of factors that compound one another, including damage to lymphoid microenvironments, adverse effects of GVHD on homeostatic peripheral expansion, as well as the obvious impact that chronic immunosuppression has on a reconstituting immune system. Second, recipient factors such as age, comorbidities, and infectious exposure prior to transplant contribute substantially to the risk for posttransplant infectious complications. This is illustrated in studies of severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) patients, wherein outcomes are most successful in children who undergo transplantation before experiencing severe, life-threatening infection [65] . Third, graft-associated factors also play an important role. Recent studies have suggested that PBSC graft recipients show more rapid immune reconstitution, as measured by lymphocyte subsets [42] , whereas UCB transplantation in adults [66, 67] and transplantation of profoundly T cell-depleted haploidentical grafts result in poor immune reconstitution and high rates of infectious complications. CD34 dose is crucial and levels of 3 \u00c2 10 6 CD34 1 cells/kg or more are associated with an improved hematopoietic recovery, a decreased incidence of fungal infections, and improved overall survival (OS) in recipients of unmanipulated BM transplants from HLA-identical sibling donors [68] .",

During phase I, prolonged neutropenia and breaks in the mucocutaneous barrier result in substantial risk for bacteremia and fungal infections involving Candida species and, as neutropenia continues, Aspergillus species. Additionally, herpes simplex virus (HSV) reactivation occurs during this phase. During phase II, infections relate primarily to impaired cell-mediated immunity. The scope and impact of this defect is determined by the extent of GVHD and immunosuppressive therapy for it. Herpesviruses, particularly cytomegalovirus (CMV), are common infectious agents during this period. Other dominant pathogens during this phase include Pneumocystis jiroveci and Aspergillus species. During phase III, persons with cGVHD and recipients of alternate-donor allogeneic transplants remain most at risk for infection. Common pathogens include CMV, varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and infections with encapsulated bacteria (eg, Streptococcus pneumoniae). The relative risk for these infections is approximately proportional to the severity of the patient's GVHD during phases II and III. For recipients of NMA grafts, substantial differences may be observed during phase I, but the susceptibility to infections during phases II and III are largely similar, and driven primarily by the status of the underlying disease, a history of GVHD, and/or the need for ongoing immunosuppression. The risk of disease from community-acquired respiratory viruses (CRV) is elevated during all 3 phases; in phase III, however, the outpatient status of HCT recipients can complicate efforts to reduce exposure and provide timely intervention.",

Unfortunately, there is currently no definitive laboratory marker of immune reconstitution that would predict infectious risk that could be used to tailor infection prophylaxis. It is likely that the degree of immune recovery measured by various assays is associated with clinical outcomes including infection rates, based on retrospective studies that included relatively small numbers of patients (Table 4 ). However, a rigorous proof of the association is lacking. Moreover, most of the published studies have focused on the association of immune assay results with outcomes that can be clearly defined and captured (eg, survival or NRM) rather than with infections. Additionally, information from the published studies is limited because of publication bias (ie, there is a tendency to publish studies that find an association rather than negative studies). Tools are now available to precisely monitor viral-specific (Epstein-Barr virus [EBV] , CMV) immune responses (HLA tetramers, interferon-g production assays), and may help in understanding this issue [75] .

In addition, essentially all HCT recipients experience a prolonged period of immunosuppression characterized by profound defects in cell-mediated and humoral immunity. Unfortunately, there are no readily available surrogate markers to accurately measure the relative risk for individual patients. Consequently, these patients must be monitored carefully and receive early intervention for signs or symptoms of an infectious disease. In most patients, immunocompetence improves progressively with increasing time after transplant, an observation that has led to the current recommendations for revaccination at 6 to 24 months, including with some live vaccines at $24 months for patients who are no longer receiving immunosuppression and show no signs of GVHD. However, it is important to realize that many HCT recipients remain immunocompromised far beyond 2 years after transplant-especially individuals with cGVHD, for whom infection remains the most important cause of morbidity and mortality. Future work is needed to augment the degree of immune reconstitution toward pathogens and malignancy and to identify accurate surrogate markers of immunocompetence to guide the long-term management of this high-risk population.",

Only a limited number of HLAmatched donors might be identified. Hence, the transplant physician may have to accept a higher risk for transmission of an infectious agent through HCT than would be permitted for routine blood transfusion. This section provides strategies for the HCT physician to minimize transmission of infectious diseases, whenever possible, from donors to recipients. In general, these strategies are dictated by national regulations, and, therefore, ratings are not included. In addition to recipient safety, clinicians must recognize the donor role and the potential impact upon the donor of the product safety determination [76] [77] [78] [79] . Assessment of the donor should include elements related to safety for the donor (eg, uncontrolled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and coronary artery disease) in addition to determination of product safety. A donor may be cleared to donate from a product safety perspective, but be unsuitable because of medical conditions that render the donation unsafe [76] [77] [78] . Because of these potential risks, individuals who donate must provide informed consent.",

If the only possible donor is at risk for, or known to have, infection with a blood-borne pathogen, but the patient is likely to succumb rapidly from his or her disease if an HCT is not received, the physician must carefully weigh the risks and benefits of using potentially infected donor cells. No person should be denied a potentially life-saving HCT procedure solely on the basis of the risk for an infectious disease. However, HCT physicians should avoid transplanting any hematopoietic cell product from an infected or infectious donor unless no other stem cell product can be obtained and the risk for death if transplantation is not performed is deemed to be greater than the risk for morbidity or death from the infection that may be transmitted. If the HCT physician judges that the circumstances of the case justify the use of such a product, the following should be noted in the recipient's chart:",

Antibacterial prophylaxis is generally started at the time of stem cell infusion and continued until recovery from neutropenia or initiation of empirical antibacterial therapy for fever during neutropenia [148] [149] [150] [151] [152] . The prophylaxis should not be continued after recovery from neutropenia. Local epidemiological data should be carefully considered before applying fluoroquinolone prophylaxis, and once it is applied, the emergence of resistance in bacterial pathogens should be monitored closely because of increasing quinolone resistance worldwide among Gram-negative bacteria (eg, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) [153] and staphylococci [154] [155] [156] [157] ; plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance in Enterobacteriaceae that is closely related to the beta lactamases that inactivate third-generation cephalosporins [158] [159] [160] ; and quinolone-related development of a hypervirulent strain of C. difficile (AIII) [161] .",

Although foscarnet is as effective as ganciclovir [230] , it is currently more commonly used as a second-line drug, because of practical reasons (eg, requirement for prehydration and electrolyte monitoring). Allogeneic recipients who are #100 days after HCT should begin preemptive treatment if CMV viremia, antigenemia, or DNA is detected (AI). Preemptive therapy should be given for a minimum of 2 weeks (A1) [217] . If CMV is still detected after 2 weeks of therapy, maintenance therapy can be given until CMV is undetectable [230] or it can be continued to day 100 (AI) [217] . After discontinuation of preemptive therapy, routine weekly screening is necessary to at least day 100 because recurrent episodes of CMV viremia commonly occur (BII).",

Ganciclovir can be restarted when the patient's ANC is z1000 for 2 consecutive days. Alternatively, foscarnet can be substituted for ganciclovir if CMV can still be detected in blood.

However, if the patient develops signs of CMV disease or if the level of antigenemia or the CMV DNA load continues to rise after more than 2 weeks of therapy, resistant CMV should be suspected and a change of therapy considered (BIII). Development of CMV drug resistance early after HCT has been observed in children transplanted for immunodeficiency or those who received T cell-depleted grafts or anti-T cell antibodies [240] .

EBV DNA loads have been shown to rise as early as 3 weeks prior to disease onset. Monitoring for blood EBV DNA loads allows preemptive reduction in immunosuppression, if possible, as the first part of patient management. Because of the variability of PCR tech-niques and the difference in risk for EBV-related PTLD depending on the degree of T cell lymphopenia, no firm recommendation on the threshold for initiation of preemptive therapy can be made. If there is no response to reduction in immunosuppression, preemptive treatment with rituximab can prevent PTLD (BII) [263] . Infusion of donor-derived, EBV-specific CTL has demonstrated promise in the prophylaxis of EBV lymphoma among recipients of T cell-depleted unrelated or mismatched allogeneic recipients (CII) [264, 265] . In addition, expanded donor-derived EBV-specific T cells have been used to control blood EBV DNA loads in this setting, but this procedure remains experimental (CII) [266, 267] . Use of B cell depletion to minimize the risk of EBV PTLD has also been proposed (CII) [268] . Finally, prophylaxis or preemptive therapy with currently available antiviral agents is not recommended because of lack of efficacy (DII) [257] [258] [259] .",

The 1-year regimen of acyclovir is highly effective in reducing the risk of VZV disease during the year of acyclovir administration (BI) [280, 287] . Acyclovir prophylaxis may be continued beyond 1 year in allogeneic HCT recipients who have cGVHD or require systemic immunosuppression (BII) [280, 288] . The optimal duration of prophylaxis is poorly defined in patients with cGVHD, as there appears to be a persistent risk of VZV reactivation disease even if the acyclovir is continued until all systemic immunosuppressive drugs are discontinued and the CD4 1 count exceeds 200 cells/mL [288] .

Although a definitive, uniformly effective preemptive therapy for RSV infection among HCT recipients has not been identified, certain other strategies have been proposed, including systemic ribavirin [314] [315] [316] , RSV antibodies (ie, passive immunization with high-RSV-titer IVIG, RSV immunoglobulin) in combination with aerosolized ribavirin [301, 317] , and RSV monoclonal antibody (mAb) [314, 318] . No randomized trial has been completed to test the efficacy of these strategies; therefore, no specific recommendation regarding any of these strategies can be given at this time. To prevent RSV disease, some centers provide monthly palivizumab prophylaxis during RSV season (eg, November-April in the Northern Hemisphere) for pediatric recipients at risk for primary RSV disease (ie, children \\4 years old) (CIII).

Because many different serotypes exist and knowledge about crossreactive immunity is limited, pretransplant serologic testing of either the patient or the donor is likely not helpful. Because cellular immune responses are crossreactive across various serotypes and are likely to provide longterm protection against adenovirus reactivation, serious adenovirus infections in adults are uncommon [326, 327] . HCT recipients should follow similar preventive measures as for other respiratory or enteric viruses (see recommendations regarding CRV, CMV, and enteric viruses) with regard to contact and nosocomial spread (see Infection Prevention and Control in Health care Facilities and Safe Living after HCT).",

When possible, rapid tapering or withdrawal of immunosuppression constitutes the best way to prevent progression of adenovirus infection (AII) [331, 332, 340, 341] . However, this strategy might not always be feasible in severe GVHD or with severe lymphopenia because of use of anti-T cell antibodies or T CD of the graft. Few antiviral agents have in vivo activity against adenoviruses, and no randomized, placebo-controlled study of antiviral drug therapy for adenoviral infection has been performed. The available data suggest that cidofovir or ribavirin could be used as preemptive antiviral therapy of adenoviral disease in selected high-risk HCT patients (CII) (Appendix 1). A reduction of DNA load has been shown mainly with cidofovir [342, 343] , but the evidence of its efficacy in preventing mortality in HCT patients is inconsistent [344] . Differences in responses may be because of strain-specific susceptibilities [345] . The duration of preemptive therapy is subject to tolerance and clearance of viral load.",

The major disease linked to high-level polyomavirus replication is BKVassociated hemorrhagic cystitis (PVHC), which affects 5% to 15% of HCT recipients at 3 ro 6 weeks posttransplant [352, 354] . PVHC occurs typically after engraftment, and must be distinguished from hemorrhagic cystitis caused by other pathogens (eg, adenovirus or CMV) and from early-onset hemorrhagic cystitis, which arises preengraftment and has been linked to urotoxic conditioning regimens with cyclophosphamide (Cy), ifosfamide, busulfan (Bu), and/or TBI [352, 354] . BKV viruria reaching high viral loads of .10 7 genome equivalents/mL (geq/mL) is observed in 20% to 80% of HCT patients, but less than onefifth of HCT recipients develop PVHC [354] . PVHC is diagnosed in HCT patients with postengraftment cystitis who have pain and urinary urgency together with hematuria of grade II (macrohematuria [352] ) or higher, high-level BKV replication (ie, $10 7 gEq/mL), and exclusion of other pathogens.

The clinical significance of detection of HHV-6 viremia is unknown, although it has been associated in the posttransplant setting with hepatitis, fever, rash, idiopathic pulmonary syndrome, and delayed platelet and monocyte engraftment. HHV-6 can also be chromosomally integrated, potentially resulting in a false-positive PCR assay result [395] . A posttransplantation acute limbic encephalitis syndrome associated with HHV-6 reactivation in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) has been reported [396] . This syndrome is uncommon, occurring in approximately 1% to 2% of HCT patients in some series. It typically occurs 1 to 2 months posttransplantation and appears to be more common after receipt of a UCB or HLA-mismatched graft. Manifestations include profound memory loss, seizures, hyponatremia, mild CSF pleocytosis, and significant mesial temporal lobe abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [396, 397] .

Because of prior chemotherapy-induced immunosuppression, the TST is not as sensitive in HCT candidates as it is in the healthy population. IGRAs are specific for TB, but a negative test does not exclude latent TB infection, particularly in the immunocompromised patient. In a meta-analysis, IGRAs were found to be more sensitive than TST in immunocompromised patients suspected of having TB [463] . This was particularly the case among patients with autoimmune disease and receiving antitumor necrosis factor therapy (eg, infliximab), who are at particular risk of TB [464] .

HCT should be delayed until the active infection is deemed controlled based on clinical judgment, because no objective definition of adequate control has been formulated. If the TST or IGRA is positive, but no active TB identified, treatment for latent TB infection (Appendix 1) should be initiated but the HCT need not be delayed.",

During hospital construction or renovation, hospitals should construct rigid, dust-proof barriers with airtight seals [531] between patient care and construction or renovation areas to prevent dust from entering patient care areas (BIII) [go to www.ashe.org/ashe/ codes/cdc/pdfs/assessment_icra.pdf for more information]. These barriers (eg, sealed drywall) should be impermeable to Aspergillus spores [531, 534, 549, 552, 555] . Construction and renovation areas should have negative air pressure-relative HCT patient care areas to ensure that air flows from patient care areas toward construction areas (AII) [543, 549] . If impervious barriers cannot be created around the construction area, patients should be moved from the area until renovation is complete and the area has been cleaned appropriately (BIII). HCT centers should direct pedestrian traffic occurring near construction or renovation areas away from patient care areas to limit the opening and closing of doors or other barriers that might cause dust dispersion, entry of contaminated air, or tracking of dust into patient areas [531, 556] , particularly HCT center patient care areas (BIII). If possible, specific access routes, such as corridors, elevators, entrances, exits, even bathrooms should be dedicated to construction use only [531] . Tacky floor mats should be placed at the threshold of construction areas to minimize tracking of dust. Visible dust and debris tracked out of the construction zone should be vacuum cleaned with HEPA filters in the vacuum exhaust [554] . Construction workers, whose clothing might be contaminated with mold spores, should use the construction elevator and avoid contact with patients, patient care areas, other elevators, and nonconstruction areas (BIII). A portable, industrial-grade HEPA filter should be used between a construction zone and the HCT unit if a large area is under construction and negative pressure differential cannot be guaranteed (AII) [543, 550] . Monitoring of air quality during construction may include, daily particle counts, environmental air sampling, and more frequent measurements of ventilation pressure differentials (CIII) [543, 557] .",

Patients' dentists should eliminate likely sources of dental infection, for example, by restoring teeth with moderate to severe caries and repairing ill-fitting dental prostheses (BIII) [607] .

HCT recipients and candidates undergoing conditioning therapy who are skilled at dental flossing should floss daily if this can be done without trauma (BIII). Routine dental supervision to monitor and guide the patient's maintenance of oral and dental hygiene should be provided or encouraged (BIII).",

However, the optimal methodology (ie, frequency or number of sites) for environmental surveillance cultures in HCT centers has not been determined, and the cost-effectiveness of this strategy has not been evaluated [531, 534] . Because a ''safe'' concentration of Legionella organisms in potable water has not been established, the goal should be to maintain water systems with no detectable organisms (AIII) [531, 534] . If Legionella species are detected in the water supplying an HCT center, the following measures should be performed until Legionella species are no longer detected by culture [531, 534] :",

Other reports suggest that the use of ASC is not necessary to control endemic MDR-GNBs [659] . However, the CDC and the Health care Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee now recommends that a single round of surveillence be conducted in high risk settings (eg, units where patients are exposed to broad spectrum antimicrobials) if previously unidentified cases of carbapenem-resistant or carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella spp. or E. coli are identified on review of mircobiology records [660] . Units experiencing high rates of MDR-GNB infection can consider the use of ASC as a component of their control and prevention program (CIII), although there is insufficient information to provide a recommendation regarding the use of ASC to prevent transmission of MDR-GNB.",

Virus is shed in high concentrations in the stool of infected children and is transmitted primarily by the fecal-oral route, through person-to-person contact and fomites [687] . Environmental contamination is common because rotavirus can survive on nonporous surfaces for more than 10 days [688, 689] . Health care-associated transmission because of rotavirus infection has been linked to toys [594] and contaminated hands [690] . Contact precautions should be implemented for HCT recipients with suspected or confirmed rotavirus gastroenteritis to prevent transmission in the health care setting (AIII). Alcohol-based hand gel has some virucidal activity against rotavirus and is sufficient for routine hand hygiene unless hands are visibly soiled [685] . Because prolonged shedding can occur in immunocompromised patients, HCT staff should ensure consistent environmental cleaning and disinfection and removal of soiled diapers (AIII) [144] . If soiled diapers need to be weighed outside of the patient room, it is important to ensure environmental disinfection of items in contact with soiled diapers (eg, cover the scale with paper, appropriately discard soiled diapers and paper, and disinfect the scale after each use) (BIII).",

Fecal-oral transmission is most common, although environmental and fomite contaminations are also important sources of infection. Aerosolization of vomitus resulting in droplets that contaminate surfaces or are swallowed also contribute to transmission. Infected individuals are contagious up to 72 hours after recovery. The low infectious dose (\\100 particles), multiple modes of transmission, prolonged duration of viral shedding even among asymptomatic people, and the ability to survive high levels of chlorine and varying temps (freezing and heating to 60 C) contribute to ease of norovirus transmission. Detection of viral RNA in stools by use of RT-PCR assays shows that virus can be isolated as long as 7 days after symptom onset. To reduce transmission of this highly infectious organism, several strategies need to be employed, including hand washing with soap and water, contact precautions, wearing masks while cleaning areas contaminated by feces or vomitus, and minimal handling of soiled linens and clothes (BIII). Use of alcohol-based hand rubs may be inadequate for preventing norovirus transmission [691] [692] [693] .",

In the absence of epidemiologic clusters of infections, there is no need to perform routine bacterial surveillance cultures of the HCT center environment, equipment, or devices used for respiratory therapy, pulmonary-function testing, or delivery of inhalation anesthesia (DIII) [534] . Furthermore, in the absence of a nosocomial fungal outbreak, it is not necessary to perform routine fungal cultures of devices or dust (eg, settle plates) in the rooms of HCT recipients and candidates undergoing conditioning therapy (DIII). However, HCT center personnel should perform routine surveillance for cases of invasive mold disease, including aspergillosis, occurring among HCT recipients (BIII). The optimal surveillance definition for nosocomial invasive mold disease is unclear. Because HCT recipients have frequent contact with ambulatory healthcare facilities and the incubation period for invasive mold disease is unknown, all cases of invasive mold infection should be tracked regardless of time to onset after admission (BIII). Cases of invasive mold disease with onset of symptoms $7 days after hospital admission are more likely to be hospital acquired. Surveillance definitions can include definitions for proven, probable, and possible cases and criteria can include culture, histology, host factors, indirect tests for detection of fungal antigen or cell-wall constituents, and clinical (including radiology) data (BIII) [702] . An increase in the number of cases or in the incidence of invasive mold disease among HCT recipients should trigger careful evaluation of the HCT center environment for sources of mold exposure. In addition, the ventilation system should be evaluated to ensure adequate filtration, air flow, and air pressure differentials (see Ventilation section) (BIII) [547] . ",

            "text": "Polio vaccine (AII): household members of HCT recipients should receive inactivated polio vaccine (IPV), because oral polio vaccine (OPV) is a live-attenuated vaccine that has been rarely associated with paralysis in healthy recipients and their contacts. If OPV vaccine is inadvertently given to a household contact, close contact should be avoided for approximately 4 to 6 weeks after vaccination (AII). If this is not feasible, HCT recipients should perform careful hand hygiene after any contact with feces from the vaccinated household member (eg, after changing the diaper of a vaccinated child) and avoid contact with saliva (eg, shared food or utensils) to reduce the risk of transmission of vaccine-associated polio virus. Infants and children who have recently received the OPV vaccine should be excluded from visiting the HCT unit for 4 to 6 weeks after receipt of vaccine to minimize the risk of transmission and vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis among HCT recipients (AII) [734] . Rotavirus vaccine (CIII): 2 rotavirus vaccines are currently available. RV5 is a human-bovine reassortant vaccine available as a 3-dose series for use in infants at 2, 4, and 6 months of age to prevent rotavirus gastroenteritis [735] . RV1 is a human strain that is available as a 2-dose series for use in children at 2 and 4 months of age [736] [737] [738] . Shedding has been shown to occur up to 15 days after a dose of RV5 and 30 days after RV1, although there have been no documented cases of transmission of vaccine virus [735, 739] . Thus, routine standard precautions are currently recommended for recently immunized infants. To minimize the risk of potential vaccine virus transmission, HCT recipients should avoid handling diapers if possible. If this is not feasible, HCT recipients should perform careful hand hygiene after any contact with feces from the vaccinated household member (AIII). Until further data on the risks of transmission of vaccine virus become available, HCT units may wish to exclude infants who have recently received rotavirus vaccine from visiting for 2 to 4 weeks after receiving a vaccine dose (CIII). Live-attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV): studies have demonstrated that 80% of vaccine recipients 8 to 36 months of age shed 1 or more vaccine virus strains for a mean duration of 7.6 days. Thus far, there have not been any documented cases of transmission to an immunocompromised host, and only 1 case of documented transmission has occurred in an immunocompetent host, with an estimated transmission rate of 0.6% to 2.9% in a population of young children enrolled in a childcare center [740] . In adults, shedding mostly occurs within the first 3 days, but can continue for as long as 7 days after vaccination [740, 741] . In HIV-infected individuals who had a CDC class of A1-2 and a plasma HIV RNA count \\10,000 and CD4 count .200, none shed LAIV virus longer than 10 days. Furthermore, clinical trial data suggest that when vaccine virus is shed by vaccine recipients, none have reverted to wild type [742, 743] . Because an alternative trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) exists, household members of HCT recipients should receive TIV to avoid potential concerns for transmission of vaccine virus (AI). Health care center personnel and HCT center visitors who receive LAIV instead of TIV should avoid contact with severely immunosuppressed persons for 7 days after vaccination (CIII) [307] . Zoster vaccine: herpes zoster vaccine is currently recommended for adults 60 years of age and older in the United States [744] . There is no evidence to date that transmission of vaccine-associated virus has occurred. However, HCT centers should exclude visitors who develop a varicella-or zoster-like rash after vaccination (AIII). If a household member develops a varicella or zoster-like rash after vaccination, close contact with the HCT recipient should be avoided and affected areas should be covered (AIII). Varicella vaccine (AIII): In 1 small study of 37 healthy children receiving vaccine and their 30 immunocompromised siblings, there was no evidence of vaccine virus transmission [745] . In the postlicensure era, transmission from immunocompetent persons after vaccination has been documented by PCR from only 5 persons resulting in 6 secondary infections, with over 55 million doses estimated to have been given [282] . Because the risk of vaccine virus transmission is low, particularly in the absence of a vaccine-associated rash, household members should receive varicella vaccine to protect HCT recipients from potential exposure to wild-type disease (AIII). Individuals who experience a vaccine-associated rash within 1 month after varicella vaccination should be excluded from visiting the HCT center and should avoid close contact with HCT recipients in the home setting (BIII). Measures such as removal of the vaccinee or transplant recipient from the domicile have not been studied. Measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine (AIII): Household members should receive age-appropriate MMR vaccination as recommended. However, vaccine recipients who develop a fever and/or rash postvaccination should be excluded from visiting the HCT center while symptomatic and should avoid close contact with HCT recipients in the home setting (BIII).",

However, even long-time monogamous partners can be discordant for these infections. Reinfection with some STIs has been reported in seropositive recipients with long-term partners years after transplant [370] . Therefore, sexually active HCT recipients in long-term monogamous relationships should consider using latex condoms during sexual contact to reduce the risk for exposure to these STIs (CIII). Additionally, contact with oral or genital secretions has been associated with acquisition of many STIs, including those from HSV, CMV, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), HHV-8, and HPV. Severely immunosuppressed HCT recipients should consider completely avoiding unprotected sexual activity (ie, activities that involve contact of the HCT recipient's mucous membranes with saliva, semen, or vaginal secretions) for as long as they remain severely immunodeficient (CIII). Sexually active HCT recipients should avoid sexual practices that could result in oral exposure to feces (AIII) [2, 746] .",

Immunocompromised HCT recipients and candidates should avoid adopting ill or juvenile pets (eg, cats \\6 months old) [747] and any stray animals (BIII) [2, 746] . Children are more likely to be bitten or scratched by pets, and thus the acquisition of new pets by children who are recent HCT recipients or candidates for HCT is not recommended (DIII). Generally, immunocompromised HCT recipients and candidates undergoing conditioning therapy should minimize direct contact with animals [99, 748, 749] , particularly animals that are ill (eg, with diarrhea) (BIII) [747] . Immunocompromised persons who choose to own pets should be aware that the risk of infection varies with the type of animal and where the pet was acquired, with larger, mature animals from established vendors posing a lower risk than other types of animals [747] . Immunocompromised HCT recipients and candidates should avoid ownership of, or contact with, reptiles (eg, lizards, snakes, turtles, and iguanas), because of the risk for salmonellosis (BII) [747, [750] [751] [752] . Additionally, patients should be informed that salmonellosis can occur from fomite contact alone [752] . Therefore, HCT recipients and candidates should avoid contact with a reptile, its food, or anything that it has touched. If such contact occurs, recipients and candidates should disinfect their hands thoroughly afterward (AIII). Immunocompromised HCT recipients and candidates should avoid ownership of, or contact with, ducklings and chicks because of the risk for acquiring Salmonella or Campylobacter species infections (BIII) [753, 754] . Immunocompromised HCT recipients and candidates should avoid ownership of, or contact with, exotic pets (eg, chinchillas or monkeys or other nonhuman primates) (BII).",

In households with cats, litter boxes should not be placed in kitchens, dining rooms, or other areas where food preparation and eating occur [747] . Additionally, litter boxes should be cleaned daily by someone other than the HCT recipient during the first 6 months after HCT and during periods of substantial immunosuppression to reduce the risk for transmitting toxoplasmosis to the HCT recipient (BIII). Daily litter box changes will minimize the risk for fecal transmission of T. gondii oocysts, because fecal oocysts require .1 days of incubation to become infectious. If HCT recipients perform this task during the first 6 months after HCT and during subsequent periods of substantial immunocompromise (eg, during GVHD, systemic steroid use, or relapse of the underlying disease for which the transplant was performed), they should wear disposable gloves [747] . Gloves should be discarded after a single use (BIII). Soiled, dried litter should be disposed of carefully to prevent aerosolizing the T. gondii oocysts (BIII). Cat feces (but not litter) can be flushed down the toilet, although this is not recommended because T. gondii oocysts are not consistently inactivated by sewage systems (DIII). Also, persons who clean cat litter, particularly HCT recipients, should wash their hands thoroughly with soap and water afterward to reduce their risk for acquiring toxoplasmosis (BIII).",

The clinical relevance of decreased antibodies to vaccine-preventable diseases among HCT recipients is not immediately apparent because a limited number of cases of vaccine-preventable diseases are reported among HCT recipients. However, vaccine-preventable diseases still pose risks to the population. Additionally, evidence exists that certain vaccine-preventable diseases such as pneumococcal infection, Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) infection, measles, varicella, and influenza can pose increased risk for HCT recipients [193, 309, [793] [794] [795] [796] [797] [798] . Therefore, HCT recipients should be routinely revaccinated after HCT so that they can experience immunity to the same vaccine-preventable diseases as others (Table 6) . Although several studies have evaluated safety and immunogenicity (eg, serologic studies of antibody titers after vaccination) of different vaccines in allogeneic HCT recipients, limited and only indirect data were found regarding vaccine efficacy among HCT recipients (ie, whether vaccinated HCT recipients have decreased attack rates of infections compared with unvaccinated HCT recipients) [798] .",

B cell counts, which are typically zero or near-zero in the first 1 to 3 months after HCT, return to normal by 3 to 12 months posttransplant [799, 800] . In patients treated with rituximab posttransplant, B cell recovery is generally delayed for 6 months following the last dose [801] . Regardless of the time to recovery, the newly generated B cells often demonstrate impaired antigen-specific responses because of a limited capability of na\u00efve B cells to undergo somatic mutation and isotype switching during the first year after transplant. T cell counts are low in the first 1 to 3 months posttransplant (CD4 1 counts are typically \\200/mL). Thereafter, the recovery of T cells, particularly CD4 1 T cells, is influenced by patient age at HCT, substantial T cell depletion (TCD) of the graft, and the presence or absence of cGVHD. Most patients \\18 years at HCT without cGVHD will recover CD4 1 cell counts of .200/mL by 6 to 9 months after transplant, whereas adults, particularly those with cGVHD, may require .2 years.",

Na\u00efve T cells capable of responding to new antigens start to be generated only at 6 to 12 months posttransplant, earlier in young children and later in older adults. Because HCT recipients have varying immune system recovery after HCT, it has been proposed that different vaccination schedules be recommended for recipients of different types of HCT, with the rationale that, for example, autologous HCT patients do not lose immunity as frequently or rapidly as patients after allogeneic HCT. The existing evidence suggests, however, that loss of immunity is also common after autologous HCT (particularly in patients who have received multiple courses of chemotherapy before HCT), and that responses to vaccination are similar to those that occur after allogeneic HCT [194, 790, 791, [802] [803] [804] [805] . It should also be recognized that limited information regarding vaccine immunogenicity exists for patients transplanted with umbilical cord blood (UCB) or haploidentical grafts, or after reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC). For the sake of simplicity, therefore, the committee has chosen to recommend the same vaccination schedule for all HCT recipients until additional data are published.",

T cell or antibody response to vaccines for pathogens not encountered pretransplant (eg, hepatitis B virus [HBV] in most European and American adults) can usually be observed later (1 year or more posttransplant). HCT recipients are similar to young children in that they respond poorly to pure polysaccharide antigens such as those included in the 23-valent polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine. Pure polysaccharide antigens elicit antibody responses later after HCT than protein antigens (eg, diphtheria toxoid) or polysaccharide-protein conjugates (eg, Hib capsular polysaccharide conjugated to a carrier protein). Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and/or its treatment hamper T cell and antibody responses to vaccines. Because studies have shown that patients with chronic GVHD (cGVHD) can mount responses to vaccines and clearly need protection against pneumococci, these guidelines do not recommend postponing vaccination in patients with GVHD with the exception of withholding live vaccines. However, when vaccinating patients with active GVHD, it may be prudent to measure specific antibody levels before and after vaccination, to determine their level of protection and need for booster immunizations. Vaccination should be administered to all persons $12 months old and who are not pregnant or immunocompromised and who have a negative or uncertain history of varicella disease with a negative serologic screen.

The vaccination dose or doses should be completed >4 weeks before the conditioning regimen begins or >6 weeks (42 days) before contact with the HCTrecipient is planned (BIII). If a varicella vaccinee develops a postvaccination rash within 42 days of vaccination, the vaccinee should avoid contact with HCT recipients until all rash lesions are crusted or the rash has resolved [282, 304] t Children 12 months to 12 years should receive two doses 3 months apart; adolescents $13 years and adults should receive 2 doses 4 weeks apart.",

When given during the first year after transplantation, PPSV23 elicits inadequate responses. Four prospective trials demonstrate better responses with PCV in HCT recipients [195, 797, 806, 807] ; thus, PCV is the preferred vaccine.

The orange line represents the innate immune cells (eg, neutrophils, monocytes, and natural killer [NK] cells), the recovery of which is influenced by the graft type (fastest with filgrastim-mobilized blood stem cells, intermediate with marrow, and slowest with UCB). The green line represents the recovery of CD8 1 T cells and B cells, the counts of which may transiently become supranormal. B cell recovery is influenced by graft type (fastest after CB transplant), and is delayed by GVHD and/or its treatment. The blue line represents the recovery of relatively radiotherapy/chemotherapy-resistant cells such as plasma cells, tissue dendritic cells (eg, Langerhans cells) and, perhaps, tissue macrophages/microglia. The nadir of these cells may be lower in patients with aGVHD because of graft-versus-host plasma cell/Langerhans cell effect.

(See text for more information.) \u00a7See text for consideration of an additional dose(s) of Tdap for older children and adults. \u00b6Significant improvement of recipient response to hepatitis B vaccine posttransplant can be expected only if the donor receives more than 1 hepatitis vaccine dose prior to donation.For children <9 years of age, 2 doses are recommended yearly between transplant and 9 years of age",
