He eventually came back to London where he lectured on tropical diseases at the St. George's hospital. He then became the chief medical officer to the Colonial Office. At this point he used his considerable influence to found a school for tropical medicine at the Albert Dock Seamen's Hospital. The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine was formally inaugurated on October 2, 1899. He eventually went on to become the first president of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in 1907. He also made numerous contributions to parasitology, such as (1) the establishment of mosquito as the intermediate host of Wuchereria bancrofti, the causative agent of filariasis; (2) proposed the mosquito-malaria theory, which eventually spurred Sir Ronald Ross to discover that a mosquito was the definitive host for malaria; and (3) the discovery of a new species of Schistosoma (Schistosoma mansoni) and a new parasite, Spirometra or Sparganum mansoni and Spirometra mansonoides. A species of mosquito Mansonia spp and a filarial worm Mansonella spp were so named to honor him. He is hence known as the \"Father of Tropical medicine.\"",

However, rainfall does vary remarkably from one area to another with the Amazon basin recording a high rainfall and North Africa being an arid area recording little to no rainfall most of the year.

Air pollution: Among the tropical regions, Southeast Asia reported the greatest increase in CO2 emissions leading to a decreased air quality followed by South Asia and South America, which has significantly impacted the climate and led to higher weather-related mortality and morbidity, infectious disease rates, and respiratory illnesses. Land degradation: Although land productivity has gone up because of increased livestock and cereal production, land degradation caused by poor agricultural practices and deforestation has led to altered ecosystems and has not changed the fact that more people in the tropics experience undernourishment compared with the rest of the world. Water scarcity: The tropics have more than 54% of the world's renewable water sources, yet more than half of these areas are considered vulnerable to water stress because of the inequality of water distribution, with Southeast Asia having the highest pollution discharge in the world. Overexploitation of wild marine food resources has led to the coral reef systems to be at high or medium risk of damage. Biodiversity: Tropical biodiversity is being threatened across all taxonomic groups with a rapid loss of primary forests. Protection and maintenance of these fragile ecosystems will have a long-term impact on human health and requires cooperation at global, regional, and international levels.",

Noncommunicable diseases are diseases caused by genetic and lifestyle factors, such as cancers, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases. In addition, snakebites, scorpion stings, and marine and terrestrial envenomations are also management dilemmas. It is important to note that because of constraints of poverty in the tropics, often unsafe food practices are condoned leading to high morbidity among individuals. Air and water pollution can lead to a myriad of respiratory, gastrointestinal, skin, and neurologic disorders along with serving as carriers of infectious pathogens. Although it is impossible to list all the causative pathogens of disease in the tropics, a syndromic approach and a region-wise probability of common tropical diseases is most helpful when dealing with a patient in the tropics or even a returned traveler.",
