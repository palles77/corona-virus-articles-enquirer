Methods and Results: Citrate-treated porcine plasma of pH 7\u00c15, 9\u00c18 and 10\u00c12 (8\u00c15% dry-matter) was spiked with PEDV, PSV1, PCV2 and AdV and incubated at 3\u00b0C for maximum 24 h, and at 44 or 48\u00b0C for maximum 10 min (Experiment 1). Spiked citrate-treated concentrated plasma of pH 7\u00c15 and 9\u00c18 (24% dry-matter) was spray dried in a laboratory scale apparatus (Experiment 2). Aliquots of SDPP were stored over a period of 0-10 weeks at 11 and 20\u00b0C (Experiment 3). Reverse transcription(RT)-quantitative PCR detected no notable reduction in viral genomes in treated plasma and SDPP samples. No infectious PSV1 was re-isolated from plasma and SDPP samples in cell culture. At pH 10\u00c12 and 3\u00b0C, infectivity of PEDV in plasma was reduced with a reduction factor of 4\u00c12 log 10 (LRF) at 10 h contact time, whereas heating to 44\u00b0C for at least 1 min at alkali pH was needed to achieve a LRF of 4\u00c12 for AdV. Spray drying at an outlet temperature of 80\u00b0C reduced AdV infectivity effectively (LRF = 5\u00c12) and PEDV infectivity for 95% (LRF = 1\u00c14). After storage at 20\u00b0C for 2 weeks no infectious PEDV was re-isolated from SDPP anymore (LRF \u22654\u00c10). Due to growth of antibiotic-resistant bacteria from plasma in cell cultures used for PCV2 isolation, no data regarding inactivation of PCV2 were obtained. Conclusions: Five percent of PEDV stayed infectious after our spray drying conditions. Spray drying in combination with storage for \u22652 weeks at 20\u00b0C eliminated infectivity of PEDV effectively. Significance and Impact of the Study: The conditions for inactivation of virus in plasma and SDPP determined are important for producers to inactivate PEDV during production of SDPP.",

PEDV-diseased piglets shed high concentrations of infection-competent PEDV particles in their faeces . As reported for other Coronaviridae this suggests that the surface structure of these PEDV particles stays intact in environments other than faeces (Hofmann and Wyler 1989; Lai et al. 2015) . Rescue of infectious PEDV from several feed ingredients and additives was reported recently, showing that PEDV stays viable in other environments than faeces (Dee et al. 2014) .",

Although there was no substantial evidence for the belief that PEDV was spread through plasma, the producers of SDPP commissioned a number of research projects to prove the virus-safety of their product. In animal trials piglets were fed with diets supplemented with SDPP produced from plasma of pigs obtained from PEDV-infected farms and produced from plasma that was deliberately contaminated (spiked) with infectious PEDV before spray drying Opriessnig et al. 2014; Schumacher et al. 2016) .

Besides PEDV, also new and re-emerging viruses pose a potential risk. To obtain a broader picture of virus inactivation in the different steps of production, inactivation of three other infectious viruses were measured in addition to PEDV; namely, the naked RNA virus porcine sapelovirus 1 (PSV1, alias porcine enterovirus serotype 8), the economically important naked DNA virus porcine circovirus 2 (PCV2) and adeno virus (AdV), a virus frequently used to monitor virus inactivation in feed and food products (Maunula et al. 2013) . To reflect the industrial production of SDPP as much as possible (see for a production scheme Fig. 1 ) in this study raw porcine blood was collected at a regular slaughterhouse in the Netherlands, preprocessed to plasma in a similar manner as is done in industrial production of SDPP and spiked with a mixture of PEDV, AdV, PCV2 and PSV1. Portions of unconcentrated plasma (as is) were used to test the thermal and physical stability at neutral and alkali pH of these viruses during prestorage (Fig. 1) and after concentration by ultrafiltration, portions of concentrated plasma were used for spray drying using a laboratory apparatus (B\u20ac uchi spray drying; see Fig. 1 ). Aliquots of the produced SDPP were stored at 11 and 20\u00b0C for up to 10 weeks (poststorage, Fig. 1 ). Samples collected were analysed by reverse transcription (RT)-quantitative PCR (qPCR) to monitor the concentration of viral genomes and dilutions of these samples were subjected to virus isolation/titration using susceptible cell lines to determine the degree of inactivation of each step in the production process of SDPP.",

After each day of growth, 75% of this serum-free medium was replaced with fresh medium containing 10 lg ml \u00c01 trypsin (Hofmann and Wyler 1988) . A549 and PK15 cells were obtained from ATCC (A549-ATCC \u00e2 CCL-185 TM , PK15-ATCC \u00e2 CCL-33 TM ) and were cultured and maintained in Dulbecco's modified eagle medium and EMEM, respectively, with 10% v/v FBS and 1% v/v anti-anti.

PCV2 strain 35 was isolated from pigs with PMWS in the Netherlands (isolation number 35; Wellenberg et al. 2000) . AdV strain 2 was isolated from humans and is frequently used as internal control virus (index virus) to monitor virus inactivation in feed and food products (Maunula et al. 2013 ). To prepare virus stocks for spiking, nearly confluent monolayers of Vero (PEDV), A549 (AdV) or PK15 (PSV1 and PCV2) cells were infected with a multiplicity of infection of about 0\u00c11 and grown for 5 days (PVC2) or until 75% of the cells showed cytopathogenic effect (CPE) induced by PEDV, AdV or PSV1. Virus-infected cultures were freeze-thawed twice at \u00c070\u00b0C and the suspension was centrifuged at 4000 g for 10 min to remove cell debris. The supernatant was harvested, divided in aliquots and stored at \u00c070\u00b0C. Aliquots of each virus stock were thawed and used to determine the titre of the virus stocks.",

For each heat-treatment of plasma, for spray drying, and for the stored samples of SDPP an LRF was calculated. In case 25 cm 2 flasks of Vero cells inoculated with 1\u00c15 ml of a 1 : 20 dilution of plasma or dissolved SDPP (0\u00c1075 ml plasma or 0\u00c1075 g SDPP) scored virus negative for PEDV, fresh aliquots of 0\u00c145 ml plasma or 0\u00c145 g SDPP were re-tested in a 1 : 20 dilution in a 175 cm 2 flasks (9 ml of inoculum per 175 cm 2 flask). The DF T for these re-tested samples was corrected for the larger volume or amount (g) of inoculum using the formula, DF T = 20/((n 9 0\u00c145)/0\u00c1075), in which n stands for 1 or 2 175 cm 2 flasks. Due to conversion of liquid plasma to powder by spray drying, the concentration of spiked virus per g SDPP can be up to 6\u00c17-fold higher than the concentration per ml in concentrated plasma (see Fig. 1 ). For SDPP samples, the DF R measured to calculate the LRF was multiplied with 6\u00c17 to account for this.

This loss of cells resulted in missing data points and partly unreliable results of titrations and demanded repeated re-testing of plasma and SDPP samples. Therefore, the use of plates with 2 or 10 cm 2 culture wells for titration and isolation of infectious virus for large numbers of samples was inefficient and laborious. Using Vero cells grown in 25 and 175 cm 2 flasks, less cells detached. In addition, these larger cell surfaces allowed testing of larger quantities of plasma and SDPP, thereby improving the sensitivity of PEDV isolation. To determine the sensitivity of this virus isolation assay for plasma samples, a known amount of PEDV was spiked in preprocessed plasma of pH 7\u00c15 and in PEDVinfection medium. Serial dilution of these spiked samples was subjected to virus isolation using 25 cm 2 flasks. In this assay, the DF measured for spiked plasma was equal to that of spiked medium, and 100% of the spiked PEDV was recovered (Table 2) . To test this for SDPP, duplicate portions of powders from B\u20ac uchi run 1 and 2 (note that these powders were produced from spiked plasma (see Fig. 1 ) were dissolved in PEDV-infection medium and one of the duplicates was re-spiked with a known amount of PEDV stock and both were tested in dilutions in 25 cm 2 flasks. At a DF of 12 500, typical PEDV CPE was observed and qPCR analysis detected PEDV replication for these re-spiked powders dissolved in infection medium. Not re-spiked powders scored negative for CPE and in the qPCR analysis at a DF of 12 500, and positive at a DF of 2500 (results not shown). This showed that an additional amount of infectious PEDV added to infection medium with SDPP was recovered efficiently and showed that components in SDPP did not inhibit PEDV infection in our virus isolation/titration test. Based on the concentration of PEDV detected in 25 cm 2 flasks, at the measured DF, the sensitivity for detection of infectious PEDV in plasma or dissolved SDPP was calculated when larger quantities were subjected to virus isolation in 175 cm 2 flasks. These results showed that spiked PEDV could be efficiently recovered from plasma and dissolved SDPP samples and an amount of 0\u00c175 PFU per ml plasma or 0\u00c173 PFU per g SDPP could be detected in this assay (Table 2) . To obtain uniform data, testing of dilutions in fivefold steps, similar as was performed for PEDV, was also used for the three other viruses in this study (see Materials and Methods).",

These latter negative control plasma samples scored a Ct value of >35 in the (RT)-qPCR tests for PEDV, PSV1, AdV and PCV2. For PEDV, AdV and PCV2 no decline in the amount of viral genomes was observed after heat treatment compared with the positive control medium and plasma samples directly frozen at \u00c070\u00b0C after spiking (0 m or 0 h). The average Ct value and standard deviation (AESD, n = 36 analysed in duplicate by (RT)-qPCR) for PEDV, AdV, PSV1 and PCV2 was 21\u00c14 (1\u00c13), 25\u00c10 (1\u00c13), 27 (1\u00c14) and 21\u00c16 (1\u00c11) respectively. For PSV1 one plasma sample, which was alkalized to pH 10\u00c12 and heated to 48\u00b0C for 10 min, was identified as a 'furthest from the rest' value in a Grubbs outlier test (Ct = 30\u00c11, P > 0\u00c105). This showed that the spiked viruses were uniformly dispersed in portions of plasma at neutral and alkaline pH. In addition, it indicated that heating at high pH did not resulted in extensive hydrolysis/fragmentation of the viral DNA (AdV and PCV2) and RNA (PEDV and PSV1) genomes. Dilutions of 'not heat-treated' plasma samples were subjected to virus isolation. In 2 cm 2 wells with PK15 cells inoculated with serial dilutions of these 'not heattreated' plasma samples no typical CPE induced by PSV1 was observed, and no PCV2 and PSV1 replication was detected by qPCR after growth for 5 (PSV1) or 7 days (PCV2). After blind passage of the PK15 cells from wells inoculated with 1 : 20 dilutions to 10 cm 2 wells and growth for another period of 5 or 7 days also no typical PSV1 CPE was observed and no replication of PSV1 and PCV2 was detected by qPCR. Because PSV1 and PCV2 could not be re-isolated from these 'not heat-treated' plasma samples even not from those kept on ice at pH 7\u00c15, no further efforts were undertaken to test the bulk of heat-treated plasma samples in the PSV1 and PCV2 in the virus isolation/titration assays. The reduction factor (LRF, see Materials and Methods) for PSV1 was calculated using the titre of the virus stock used for spiking and was equal to the maximum reduction factor (RF max = 3\u00c13) measurable in the virus isolation assay for PSV1. In the discussion it is explained why no LRF was calculated for PCV2.",

In addition, this showed that the presence of infectious AdV or PSV1 did not interfere with the detection/isolation of PEDV when Vero cells were infected and grown in the presence of 10 lg ml \u00c01 trypsin. For all treatments of spiked plasma and culture medium listed in Table 3 , the LRF was calculated. Prolonged incubation at 3\u00b0C of alkalized plasma and culture medium lead to an efficient reduction in PEDV-infectivity. After incubation for 24 h at 3\u00b0C no infectious PEDV could be detected anymore in plasma alkalized to pH 10\u00c12. (LRF = 4\u00c12), whereas AdV infectivity was reduced not more than fivefold (LRF = 0\u00c17). Compared with the relatively long period (24 h) at 3\u00b0C, heating of plasma at pH 10\u00c12 to 44 or 48\u00b0C reduced the time needed to inactivate PEDV with an LRF of 4\u00c12 to 3 and 1 min respectively. At neutral pH, infectivity of AdV in plasma was reduced effectively (LRF = 4\u00c12) when plasma was heated to 48\u00b0C for more than 5 min. In contrast, under these conditions only a slight reduction in AdV infectivity was observed in culture medium (LRF = 1\u00c14). These large differences between culture medium and plasma were not observed for PEDV after incubation at neutral pH, nor under alkaline conditions (Table 3) . By heating of plasma to 44\u00b0C for at least 3 min at pH 10\u00c12 a RF max (4\u00c12) was achieved for both PEDV and AdV (Table 3) .",

Our results showed that conditions of thermal and pH-dependent inactivation of infectious virus were different for the four viruses under study. Heating to 48\u00b0C was sufficient for effective reduction in AdV infectivity in plasma of pH 7\u00c15, but was insufficient for complete reduction in PEDV infectivity. In line with this, the heat of the spray dryer was, most likely, also responsible for effective reduction in AdV infectivity, whereas the residence time of plasma in the laboratory spray dryer was probably too short (0\u00c12-0\u00c135 s) (Kemp et al. 2016) to completely reduce infectivity of PEDV. In contrast, overnight incubation in alkaline condition at 3\u00b0C hardly affected AdV infectivity, but reduced PEDV infectivity efficiently. In a recent study, alkalization of plasma also potentiated inactivation of PEDV infectivity at 3\u00b0C and during heat treatment (Quist-Rybachuk et al. 2015) .",

As observed for foot and mouth disease virus (like PSV1 also a picornavirus), addition of citrate (here used as anticoagulant) may have inactivated infectivity of PSV1 in plasma by chelating calcium (Hong et al. 2015) . PEDV and PSV1 particles are secreted by cells of the intestinal mucosa and both stay infectious in the content of the intestines and in faeces, both rough environments containing a broad diversity of proteases and glucanases from the host and microbiota. The resistance of the PEDV surface structure to active components in plasma (e.g. chemicals, protease and other enzymes) or to added chemicals (e.g. citrate), in comparison to the damage imposed to the surface of PSV1 in this environment, indicates that for each family/taxa of viruses, or even for specific virus strains, inactivation of infectivity is dependent of specific (structural) features of these viruses.",

Only at the most extreme conditions applied (10 min incubation at pH 10\u00c12 and 48\u00b0C) some breakdown of PSV1 RNA was observed in plasma. A similar effect was observed for PEDV RNA in SDPP that was stored for 10 weeks at 20\u00b0C. For PEDV and PSV1 this suggests that their RNA genomes (note that RNA is more vulnerable to digestion/ hydrolysis than DNA) were not readily accessible for degradation by enzymes present in plasma (proteases and RNases) or by alkali hydrolysis, indicating that the RNA genomes were protected by the viral envelop and/or capsid under all tested conditions. In a recent study na\u20ac \u0131ve pigs were fed for nearly a month with SDPP produced from blood of pigs seropositive for PEDV . Although this SDPP contained a relative high concentration of PEDV RNA (5\u00c11 AE 0\u00c11 log 10 copies/g), it did not induce clinical signs of a PEDV-infection, and also no seroconversion was observed. This also suggested that a considerable fraction of RNA genomes were protected from RNA degradation by RNases by the PEDV envelop and/or capsid. Failure of these PEDV particles to mediate infection of cells in the intestine of pigs suggests that the surface structure of these PEDV particles was damaged or altered. We observed that spray drying was more effective for inactivation of PEDV than prestorage at pH 7\u00c15 (at its natural state) at 3\u00b0C for 24 h (see Table 3 ). However, no conclusion can be drawn whether this damage/alterations to the surface of virions was imposed by the heat or mechanical shear in the spray drier. We used a plasma batch that scored negative in the (RT)-qPCR test for PEDV and fully recovered spiked infectious PEDV from this plasma batch at~pH 7\u00c15, indicating that no PEDV antibodies in our plasma batch inhibited the infection of Vero cells with PEDV. This in contrast to the study of Opriessnig et al. (2014) , in which plasma derived from PCR-positive pigs was used for production of SDPP in an industrial plant. This commercial SDPP contained IgG antibodies directed against PEDV, which could have contributed to the loss of infectivity of PEDV in this commercial batch.",

However, they used sodium phosphate as anticoagulant instead of citrate, and mixed a PEDV virus stock with plasma in a 1 : 1 ratio instead of the 1 : 9 ratio we used. A ratio of 1 : 9 (or below 10%) is strongly recommended by the 'European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products' for studies validating inactivation and removal of viruses in production processes of human medicines (CPMP/BWP/268/95 report, 1996). Although they almost fully recovered infectious PEDV and PEDV RNA genomes from the 1 : 1 mixture of virus stock and plasma, they did not detect infectious PEDV in produced spray-dried bovine plasma (SDBP), whereas we did in SDPP in two independent runs of spray drying with plasma of pH 7\u00c15 and 9\u00c18. In addition, in SDBP only a small fraction of the PEDV RNA present in the liquid mixture (Ct = 13) was recovered in SDBP (Ct = 23), whereas we fully recovered PEDV RNA after spray drying. The only plausible explanation we can think for these conflicting results is a difference in physical, chemical and biological conditions between the plasma mixtures used for spray drying. This may have imposed a different distribution of PEDV particles between the watery phase (e.g. aerosol particles) and solid phase in the spray dryer or affected the droplet size and moisture content of the produced SDBP powders (see below). The moisture content of the spiked SDPP we produced in the B\u20ac uchi apparatus was 6-7% and comparable to industrial produced SDPP. It was reported that the infectivity of a human AdV vector in spray-dried powders decreased more rapidly when the moisture content was higher (tested in a range of 2-20%; LeClair et al. 2016) . Therefore, it is likely that the moisture in the SDPP batches we produced also favoured inactivation of PEDV during storage of SDPP at 11 and 20\u00b0C, probably by facilitating a higher level of protease and/or RNase activity in the SDPP matrix (Townsend and DeLuca 1990) or reactivity of chemicals. In line with this, we observed a faster inactivation of PEDV infectivity under conditions that chemicals, proteases and RNases from blood display more activity, that is more at 20\u00b0C than at 11\u00b0C. Also, a decline in the amount of PEDV RNA was detected after storage for 10 weeks at 20\u00b0C and pH 7\u00c15, but not at 11\u00b0C. This suggested that the PEDV RNA became accessible for degradation by RNases, implying that the protective shell (capsid and envelop) of the PEDV particles was (further) damaged during storage. This damage could have destroyed the capability of the PEDV particles to bind to a receptor on the surface of cells to mediate infection.",

In another study, PCR positive SDPP with an unknown origin of contamination induced clinical signs of PEDV when piglets were inoculated with SDPP using a gastric tube (Pasick et al. 2014 ), but not when SDPP was mixed in their feed. This latter study suggested that PEDV particles lose their capability to infect cells in the small intestine, most likely, due to the passage through the stomach, an environment with low pH and high concentrations of digestive enzymes. However, PEDV was rescued from various feed formulations (Dee et al. 2014) indicating that the surface of the PEDV particle endures the impact of various physical conditions and milieus. We demonstrated that infectivity of PEDV particles also endured specific physical conditions and different milieus, irrespective of the matrix in which these particles were enclosed, liquid plasma, or solid SDPP. The fact that a fraction of PEDV spiked in plasma stayed infectious after the heat imposed by spray drying gave us the opportunity to test the effect of storage on PEDV infectivity in a nonartificial manner. Storage proved to be an effective step to completely inactivate residual PEDV infectivity in SDPP. In combination with spray drying, a storage period of 2 or 4 weeks at 20 or 11\u00b0C, respectively, reduced infectivity of PEDV with an LRF of at least 4\u00c10. The calculated level of residual infectious PEDV present in the SDPP we produced from spiked plasma was approximately 4 PFU per g. When mixed in a 19 : 1 ratio starter diet-SDPP, a ratio routinely applied, this would be \u22640\u00c12 PFU per g (\u22641 PFU/5 g). This is 280-fold lower than the minimum dose of spiked PEDV (56 PFU per g) in feed that led to infection in 10-day-old pigs under experimental conditions (Schumacher et al. 2016) . Based on a combined LRF of spray drying at pH 7\u00c15 and 2 weeks storage of 4\u00c10, it can be calculated that a plasma batch used for SDPP production must contain at least 6\u00c12 log 10 infectious PEDV particles per ml to prepare a starter diet batch with a concentration of 56 PFU per g PEDV.",

Given a moisture content of 7\u00c14%, we calculated that for production of 1 g SDPP approximately 7 ml of plasma was used with a concentration of 4\u00c11 log 10 PEDV genome copies per ml , i.e. plasma with a 100-fold lower concentration of PEDV particles that would be needed to produce a starter diet batch with a minimum infectious dose of 56 PFU per g PEDV (Schumacher et al. 2016) . Assuming that this concentration of 4\u00c11 log 10 /ml is representative for the concentration of infectious PEDV particles in the blood of pigs with viraemia, the combined LRF of 4\u00c10 would be more than sufficient to formulate a 19 : 1 starter diet-SDPP batch with lower dose than 56 PFU per g. To our knowledge, no data about titres of infectious PEDV in blood of viraemic pigs have been reported yet. Likely, this is due to the lack of a cell line supporting efficient infection of native PEDV. However, when data about PEDV titres in blood of viraemic pigs become available they can easily be integrated with the results of this inactivation study to validate PEDV safety of SDPP products in the future. We conclude that spray drying of plasma as is at an outlet temperature of 80\u00b0C in combination with a storage period at ambient temperature of 2 weeks or longer before dispatch, minimalizes the risk that AdV, PSV1 and PEDV particles stay infectious in the feed-ingredient SDPP.",
