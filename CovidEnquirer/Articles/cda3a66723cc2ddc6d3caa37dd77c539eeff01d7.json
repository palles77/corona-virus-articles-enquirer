The 7-day-old chickens were immunized intramuscularly with multi-epitope DNA vaccine encapsulated by liposome and boosted two weeks later, and were challenged by virulent IBV strain five weeks post booster. The results showed that multi-epitope DNA vaccine led to a dramatic augmentation of humoral and cellular responses, and provided up to 80.0% rate of immune protection.

Infection with IBV reduces the performance of broilers and in laying birds drops in egg production and egg quality can occur [1]. Vaccines against infectious bronchitis applied in the field have respective weakness. Live attenuated vaccine has a strong probability of spreading of the vaccine virus [2]; inactivated vaccine does not elicit enough immune response against coronavirus [3, 4] , and shows severe side effect and long-lasting local response after inoculation. The construction of conventional DNA vaccine has to be based on integral antigen gene, and only one or two gene at the most can be constructed into one plasmid, so its immune protection is imperfect. However, epitope-based DNA vaccine breaks through such weakness of traditional DNA vaccine. It can not only elicit favourable immunoreactivity, but also has no risk of gene integrating into host cell [5] .",

The essence of this technology is that short DNA sequences, encoding well-defined cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL), antibody or helper T-lymphocyte (HTL) specific epitopes are used as immunogens, which is often capable of inducing protection against a large and complex pathogen. Compared to other vaccine strategies, several potential advantages are apparent. First, epitopebased DNA vaccine strategy shows increased 'safety' of an immunisation strategy that mimics antigen processing and presentation during natural infections, without actually causing disease. Secondly, it has the 'flexibility' in epitope selection, which allows induction and optimisation of the desired type of immunity. In addition, the epitope-based constructs appear to be capable of inducing more potent immunoreaction than whole protein vaccines. Furthermore, multiple epitopes derived from more than one antigen can be packaged into a relatively small delivery vehicle, and generate broad responses simultaneously targeting multiple Ags. Finally, epitope-based vaccines may overcome immunodominance and T cell tolerance. Therefore, this paper presented and discussed the construct of chimeric multi-epitope DNA vaccine of IBV and its immune response in chickens. The preclinical studies available to date clearly demonstrated the potential of this vaccine approach in terms of prophylaxis.",

            "text": "In the present study, several strategies had been adopted when we constructed the multi-epitope DNA vaccine to enhance the protective effect of epitope-based gene immunization. First, the spacers between two authentic epitopes were usually designed as flexibility peptide [22] or prolease recognizing sequence [23] to eliminate interference of two consecutive epitopes. In this study we constructed the GA/GP as spacer between two epitopes which not only minimized junctional epitopes, but also simultaneously optimized for proteosome processing. Secondly, CpG motif in plasmid as well as CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) can activate systemic and mucosal immune responses, induce lymphocytes and macrophages to secrete polyreactive antibodies and/or cytokines, and induce proliferation of B-cell [24] [25] [26] [27] . We inserted CpG motif in the multi-epitope chimeric gene to enhance immune response. In addition, the Kozak sequence was also constructed at the 5 0 terminal of chimeric gene to improve the expression according to previous study [28] . In this paper, the level of specific antibodies developed in pVAX-F group was higher than that of pVAX1 group and PBS group, respectively, and also superior than inactive vaccine group, which suggested the DNA vaccine induced remarkable humoral response. Studies demonstrated that humoral immunity plays an important role in disease recovery and virus clearance [29, 30] . In addition, it is also reported T-cell response played an important role in efficacy protection [6, 12, 31] .",

This demonstrated that the constructed multi-epitope chimeric DNA vaccine stimulated intensive cellular immunoreaction. Since CD8+ CTL are critical in the control of infectious bronchitis in poultry, and CD4+ T-cell responses may increase the proliferation, maturation and functional activity of CD8+ CTL, providing increased help for B-cells and directly producing antiviral cytokines, the abundantly increased Tlymphocytes in the pVAX-F group may provide a better efficiency of protection.",
