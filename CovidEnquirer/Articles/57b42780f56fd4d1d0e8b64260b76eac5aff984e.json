            "text": "T he severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is caused by a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) with great genetic diversity among strains. 1,2 Coronaviruses are single-stranded RNA viruses that can cause common cold in humans and diseases in animals. The SARS-CoV is moderately infective, with an attack rate that ranges from 2.4 to 31 cases per 1,000 exposure hours 3 and may be transmitted by aerosolization. The SARS epidemic affected thousands of people in five continents (26 countries) over a period of 9 months following its first appearance in November of 2002 in the south of China. The case fatality rate associated with SARS is about 15%. However, a higher mortality occurs in the elderly and in patients with comorbid conditions. 4 The clinical presentation of patients with SARS ranges from asymptomatic infection to severe multilobar pneumonia and death. Of the symptomatic patients, approximately 20 to 25% become critically ill and need to be admitted to the ICU, most commonly with acute respiratory failure that fulfills the criteria for acute lung injury (ALI) and ARDS. 5,6 The initial chest radiographic finding in patients with SARS, unifocal peripheral airspace disease, is nonspecific and has significant overlap with the radiographic findings of other atypical pneumonias. 7,8 Progression to bilateral disease is associated with poor outcomes. 7,8 Patients with ALI/ARDS (bilateral diffuse infiltrates and severe hypoxemia) have diffuse alveolar damage 9 that may look similar to diffuse alveolar damage present in most patients with ARDS. 10 In this issue of CHEST (see page 1393), Ong et al 11 report the pulmonary function and health status at 1 year of a cohort of patients from Singapore who recovered from SARS. There were 206 patients with probable SARS in Singapore, 15% of whom died (32 patients). Of the patients who survived, 46% declined participation, could not be contacted, were underage, or could not perform the battery of tests. The 94 subjects included in this study (half of them were health-care workers) had pulmonary function tests done and the authors administered the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire. Unfortunately, exercise testing was not performed. Ong et al 11 found that at 1 year, 20 to 30% of the patients had cough, sputum production, or shortness of breath, but the mean values for lung volumes were in the normal range. According to the American Thoracic Society criteria, mild and moderate impairment were present in 32% and 5%, respectively. Only 12% of the study population required admission to the ICUs for severe acute respiratory failure, and only 7% were intubated. Interestingly, the outcomes of the patients with severe respiratory failure were similar to the patients who were not admitted to the ICU. Overall, however, patients who survived SARS had worse health-related quality of life than normal subjects.",

All of these studies 12-14 report common abnormalities in pulmonary function tests, but most if not all of the abnormalities were mild. It is important to emphasize that in a previous communication by Ong et al, 12 in patients evaluated at 3 months after SARS, up to 78% patients had mild-to-moderate impairment of exercise capacity, although none of the patients showed ventilatory impairment during exercise. The limitations during exercise in this group may be related to poor conditioning or residual muscular problems. An important limitation of the current study is the lack of exercise test results, as we do not know the real impact of the alterations present in the breathing tests and in the health-related quality of life questionnaire.",

However, patients who survive ARDS have significant decrease in health-related quality of life when compared with matched control subjects with sepsis and trauma but without ARDS. 16 It seems that patients with SARS have a more benign course compared with patients with ARDS and pneumonia in terms of health-related quality of life.",

I n the preantibiotic era William Osler wrote that \"(t)he most widespread and fatal of all acute diseases, pneumonia is now the 'Captain of the Men of Death.'\" 1 At that time, the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) consisted of bedrest and open drainage tubes for patients with empyema. Once penicillin became commercially available in the l940s, the most common identifiable cause of bacterial pneumonia, the pneumococcus, became amenable to pathogen-directed therapy. With the discovery and manufacture of broad-spectrum antibiotics, additional pulmonary pathogens such as Haemophilus influenzae became treatable. Atypical pneumonia, historically characterized by interstitial infiltrates and the inability to identify a pathogen on sputum Gram stain or culture was first described in the mid-1940s, but it was not until the l960s that it was recognized that some cases were due to tetracycline-susceptible mycoplasma. 2,3 Legionella pneumophila was first identified as a cause of both atypical and typical CAP during a 1976 outbreak at an American Legion Convention. Mortality was 63% lower in patients treated with erythromycin compared to \u2424-lactams. 4 Because of its activity against Streptococcus pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneu-",
