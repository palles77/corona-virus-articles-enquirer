The N gene encoding the N protein was cloned and expressed as a fusion protein with His tag protein in E. coli. The recombinant N protein was migrated at 48 kDa and reacted with six histidine tag specific monoclonal antibody by immunoblotting. Recombinant N protein ELISA (rnELISA) demonstrated 98.7% specificities among (80) PEDV-free individuals, and 98% sensitivity ranging among (103) clinical samples with PEDV. On testing 884 field samples, an overall agreement of 88.3% was generated between the SN and rnELISA. Taken together, these results indicated that nucleocapsid protein may be a useful antigen for the seradiagnosis of PEDV and it was also suggested that the ELISA is a highly sensitive and specific test for detecting antibodies to PEDV. #",

Morbidity is variable in sow but high (approaching 98.7%) in suckling pigs, which are most severely affected and exhibit vomiting, watery diarrhea, and dehydration. Mortality in piglets may be 50% or higher. Most fattening pigs and weaners recover from the disease, but some may remain unthrifty. In adults, anorexia, lethargy, and diarrhea are seen, but mortality is very low. Comparing high morbidity, the mortality is usually low in adult pigs (3%), which can recover within in a week. However, when suckling pigs are involved, mortality is normally about 50% and can reach up to 90% in very severe outbreaks (Pensaert, 1999) .",

Now there are no effective commercial vaccines or specific treatment available and the only measures to control the disease are those directed to preventing the entrance of the virus on the farm (Pensaert, 1999) . Induction of maternal immunity by artificial spread of the virus to pregnant sow is a common procedure used to reduce mortality and economical impact of the outbreak on the farm (Pensaert, 1999) . Hofmann and Wyler (1988) described PEDV isolation for the first time in cell culture using Vero cells and trypsin-supplemented medium. Since then, several diagnostic methods have been employed for the detection of both PEDVantigen and its antibodies (Callbaut et al., 1982; Carvajal et al., 1995; Debouck et al., 1981; Hofmann and Wyler, 1990; Knuchel et al., 1992; Kweon et al., 1997; Van Nieuwstadt and Zetstra, 1991) . The lack of in vitropropagated PEDV made the diagnosis of infections extremely complicated and for this reason the available tests were of limited applicability. Virusantigen-based serologic tests were used in screening for TGEV and PEDV (Knuchel et al., 1992; de Arriba et al., 2002) but the recombinant proteins for serodiagnosis for PEDV have not been investigated. Examination with sensitive techniques such as immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation showed that PEDV has antigenic determinants in common with feline infectious peritonitis virus and these determinants are located on the nucleocapsid protein.",

The application of ELISA for serological survey was firstly reported by Hofmann and Wyler (1990) . Their approach, however, had a disadvantage that PEDV particles were purified by sucrose density-gradient centrifugation before being used as ELISA antigens.
