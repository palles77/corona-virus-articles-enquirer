The 2014 Lancet Series on the new discipline of mass gatherings medicine was launched at the World Health Assembly of Ministers of Health in Geneva in May, 2014. The Series covered the planning and surveillance systems used to monitor public health risks, public health threats, and experiences of health-care providers from mass gathering events in 2012 and 2013. This follow-up Review focuses on the main public health issues arising from planned mass gathering events held between 2013 and 2018. We highlight public health and research data on transmission of infectious diseases and antibioticresistant bacteria, mass casualty incidents, and non-communicable diseases, including thermal disorders. In the events discussed in this Review, the combination of a large influx of people, many from countries with outbreakprone infectious diseases, with a high degree of crowd interactions imposed substantial burdens on host countries' health systems. The detection and transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in pilgrims attending the Kumbh Mela and the Hajj raise concern of possible globalisation from mass-gathering religious events. Priorities for further investments and opportunities for research into prevention, surveillance, and management of these public health issues are discussed.",

The 2013 Kumbh Mela event was attended by 70 million Hindu pilgrims over 55 days at the confluence of the Yamuna and Ganga Rivers. 19 The Kumbh Mela is a highly coordinated and organised event, where WHO recomendations for mass gatherings are implemented (panel 3). 1, 2 The Indian Government and local authorities plan well ahead of each Kumbh Mela event and have established plans for physical and public health infrastructure to be in place. Socalled temporary popup cities that include tents for pilgrims, water pipelines and clean water supply, toilets, sanitation and sewage disposal facilities, vector control and sur veillance teams, security services, and administrative assistance for pilgrims are set up along the river. [20] [21] [22] A range of healthcare facilities are put in place and hospitals are prepared to receive pilgrims requiring inpatient treatment and intensive care for every Kumbh Mela festival. 21 Internal roads and pontoon bridges are built for these popup cities and are designed to streamline and facilitate pilgrim crowd movement and flow. 22 State government irrigation and water resources departments and the Central Pollution Control Board work closely together to increase the capacity of sewage treatment plants and to ensure sufficient flow to remove contamination by releasing water into rivers. 19, 20 90 000 kL/day of potable water were supplied for the 2013 Kumbh Mela for drinking and cooking, with 550 km of water pipelines were laid for distribution through 20 000 taps. 19 Approximately 45 000 toilets were provided, although there was little health promotion messaging. 21 Similarly to other mass gatherings, random inspection and vaccinations were done for immunocompromised individuals. 21",

The Games attracted about 1700 athletes and officials from several Micronesian countris and territories. In June, 2014, 6 weeks before the opening of the Games, Pohnpei reported the first case of measles in an outbreak that spanned the duration of the Games and the following 3 months and resulted in a total of 251 cases. 40 The UN's Third Conference on Small Island Developing States was held in Apia, Samoa on Sept 1-4, 2014. 41 Attracting more than 3000 delegates from 115 countries, it was the largest event ever to be hosted by Samoa, a Polynesian island nation in the south Pacific with a population of around 187 000. In late July, 2014, an extensive chikungunya virus disease outbreak began in Samoa that resulted in more than 4000 cases 4 months later. 42 The 12th Festival of Pacific Arts was hosted by the Micronesian island of Guam (population 163 000) in 2016. 43 The Festival was a large event, attracting more than 2500 artists and performers from 27 countries and territories across the Pacific. These island communities (some very small, such as the Pitcairn Islands with fewer than 50 residents) would have been greatly affected by the introduction of a novel disease. The Festival was held Panel 3: Key considerations related to communicable disease alert, response, and operation plans for mass gatherings \u2022 Risk assessment and management, surveillance and alert systems, and outbreak alert and response twinned to effective communication strategies \u2022 Rapid identification of attendees with communicable diseases and their contacts for potential quarantining and instituting preventive infection control measures \u2022 Medical care planning and guidelines (preventive medicine, mandatory vaccinations, food management, water and waste management, and identification of physical and fire hazards) \u2022 Public health measures (water protection and provision, food protection and provision, and syndromic surveillance) \u2022 Emergency planning and response (rapid access to injured or ill patients, provision of triage in the field and at aid stations, provision of on-site care for minor injuries and illnesses, effective and timely stabilisation and transport of patients requiring evacuation) \u2022 Disaster medicine, trauma, and triage and level of care \u2022 Mobile units, health stations, and designated hospitals \u2022 Use of modern technologies for proactive surveillance, early diagnosis and rapid detection, data collection, analyses, sharing, and communication. \u2022 Updating travel guidelines, including vaccinations, for each specific mass gathering event while Zika, dengue, chikungunya, and measles outbreaks were occurring in several participating countries. 40, 42, 44, 45 At all these mass gathering events, the combination of large influxes of people and high degrees of social mixing in the presence of highly infectious pathogens, emerging nonvaccinepreventable diseases, and diseases with incurable long term consequences (eg, Zika birth defects) could have introduced substantial population burdens and consequences for health systems. To counter these threats, enhanced surveillance for these mass gathering events was essential to ensure health security. 41, 46 The three events used enhanced syndromic surveillance that built on the existing panPacific WHOled weekly syndromic surveillance, 47 ensuring host countries were prepared. However, although short, the period of intense activity that characterises mass gathering surveillance is a substantial burden to stretched local public health resources. To alleviate this burden additional support was gained from within host countries and from external partners provided by the Pacific Community, which has extensive experience of mass gathering surveillance, and the Pacific Island Health Officers Association.",

[48] [49] [50] [51] In February, 2016, WHO declared the Zika virus a public health emergency of international concern owing to the Zika outbreak in Brazil and its association with birth defects. 50 There was global pressure for the Games to be either postponed or moved to another country. 52 The WHO Emergency Committee on Zika virus decided that postponing or cancelling the Games had no public health justification, [49] [50] [51] 53 stating that \"indi vidual risks in areas of transmission are the same whether or not a mass gathering is conducted, and can be minimised by good public health measures\". 50 Because Brazil is a dengueendemic country, the risk of dengue to nonimmune visitors was also a concern, 54 based on the experience from a pilgrimage in Senegal 55 and from GeoSentinel data. GeoSentinel is a global network of travel medicine providers focused on sentinel surveillance, which generates evidencebased assessments of infectious disease risks for attendees of future mass gatherings events. 56, 57 As with the 2012 Olympics and Paralympics in London, 18 WHO provided technical support to the Brazilian Ministry of Health and International Olympic Committee to ensure public health safety during the Games. This support included improving the quality of water for recreation and preventing the spread of Zika virus by increasing vector control efforts. In spite of intensive media coverage, no cases of Zika virus were confirmed among people who attended, both during the Games and since returning to their home countries. 50 gathering events during infectious disease outbreaks with epidemic potential. 60 Before the 2016 Summer Olympics, another concern was related to water sports and athletes being exposed to polluted waters. 61 However, a study 61 done during tests in 2015 showed no increased incidence of diarrhoea among exposed individuals compared with controls. When travellers to the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil were compared with other travellers to Brazil during the same period, the majority in both groups were bitten by insects and had sunburns as environmental risk factors, and every third traveller suffered from diarrhoea. 58, 61 Men travelling to the World Cup tended to have more sexual contacts outside of a relationship than a control group of other travellers to Brazil and also had more alcohol intake. 48",

It takes place every 4 years, with the site of the Jamboree rotating between continents. The daily schedule includes arduous activities, such as climbing, woodchopping, and knife handling, and preparing one's own meals on gas stoves. Apart from risk of transmission of infectious diseases, injuries, and burns, it induces a range of psychological disorders, inc luding homesickness and behavioural and neuropsychological disorders. 64 No major infectious diseases outbreaks were reported during the Jamboree. However, within 9 days of the end of the event, six cases of laboratoryconfirmed invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitides capsular serogroup W occurred among scouts and their close contacts in Scotland and Sweden. [65] [66] [67] Soon after return to Scotland, three scouts and one relative were diagnosed with invasive meningo coccal disease. These cases were all associated with one scout unit. Two confirmed cases of invasive meningo coccal disease were reported from Sweden. 65 Molecular analysis [65] [66] [67] showed that the same N meningitides isolates were responsible for the six cases and that they belonged to the ST11 clonal complex, which is usually associated with large outbreaks. No other cases were reported from scouts who attended from other European countries or Japan. All participants were made aware of the outbreak and of signs and symptoms of invasive meningococcal disease through an information campaign and were offered ciprofloxacin chemoprophylaxis. 66, 67 To make a decision on the need for prophylactic treatment for close contacts of returning scouts, throat or nasopharyngeal swabs from participants receiving antibiotic prophylaxis were taken. The carrier state in Swedish teenagers was studied comparing sensitivity of throat versus nasopharyngeal swabs from 1020 of the 1890 Swedish teenagers who participated in the Jamboree. The overall positivity for N meningitidis in this group was 83 (8%) of 1020, of which 61 were nongroupable. 67 Further car riage studies are required during mass gatherings to determine the epidemiology and association between carrier isolates and diseasecausing isolates in the population and the dynamics of globali sation from mass gathering events.",

            "text": "In the past 5 years, concern has grown with regard to the threat to global health security posed by several emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. Because of the Ebola outbreaks in West Africa (2013-16), 69 74 concerns were expressed by the global public health fraternity regarding pilgrims from affected countries travelling to Saudi Arabia for the Hajj or Umrah. 70 The Saudi government implemented restrictions only to countries affected by the Ebola outbreak. For pilgrims from Yemen and other countries, intensified screening at points of entry into Saudi Arabia and close surveillance during their stay throughout the Hajj, was implemented, with no cases detected. 68 At the 2016 Hajj, The Indian Medical Mission provided health care to about 400 000 pilgrim patients from August to October, 2016, through a team of 144 doctors, including 50 specialists, 146 paramedics, and 74 ancillary staff. 75 They coordinated a tiered healthcare network, including primarycare static clinics, tent clinics, and mobile medical task forces, secondarycare hospitals, and referral and evacuation capabilities at Mecca, Medina, and Jeddah. Secondarycare referral hospitals catered for critical care, internal medicine, general surgery, ortho paedics, gynaecology, paediatrics, psychiatry, dermatology, isolation, lab medicine, and radiology. Infectious diseases consituted 53% of outpatient diagnoses, with upper and lower respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, and diabetes related severe infections, particularly cellulitis and pneumonia the most common. Urinary tract infections were common in female pilgrims. 75 Nearly all pilgrims develop a respiratory tract infection during the Hajj, known as the pilgrims' cough. 10 Overcrowding during the Hajj increases the risk of transmission of respiratory pathogens, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV), rhino virus, respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A H1N1, influenza B, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, meta pneumovirus, enterovirus, multidrugresistant tu ber culosis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Ebola, MERSCoV, Alkhumra viral haemorrhagic fever, and Rift Valley fever have high outbreak potential during Hajj. 10, 76, 77 Although the threat of coronaviruses (MERSCoV and severe acute respiratory syndromerelated coronavirus) with epidemic potential remains, [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] no cases of MERSCoV have yet been identified in pilgrims during Hajj or upon return to their home countries. 79 Other corona viruses identified at the Hajj include alphacoronavirus and betacoronavirus, of which the 229E strain is most common cause of upper respiratory tract illnesses. 82 A systematic review of 31 studies on the prevalence of respiratory viruses in Hajj pilgrims 76 showed influenza, rhinovirus, and parainfluenza continue to be the most common viral infections among pilgrims. At the 2016 Hajj, a study 83 of 266 pilgrims admitted to hospitals with community acquired pneumonia showed that 96 (36%) cases had diabetes, 26 (10%) were smokers, and 108 (45%) cases required intensive care. 48 (18%) cases had invasive S pneumoniae (pneumococcal) infection.",

            "text": "Every year the Saudi Arabian Ministry of Health issues updates on travel immunisation recommendations for pilgrims. 10 They are classified as mandatory (required) and voluntary (recommended) before performing Hajj and Umrah. The three mandatory vaccines are the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine for all pilgrims and the Yellow fever and Polio vaccines for pilgrims coming from countries with active polio transmission. 10, 68 Recom mended vaccines include influenza vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine. 84, 85 Since the inclusion of the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine in 2001, 85 no major meningo coccal meningitis outbreaks related to hajj have been identified. [85] [86] [87] However, concern that new serogroups of N meningitidis (eg, B and X), which are not covered in the current quadrivalent vaccine targeting serogroups A, C, W135, and Y, could be a cause of future epidemics is increasing. 88, 89 Owing to the high incidence of pertussis seen among Hajj pilgrims in 2003, 90 Bordetella pertussis is considered a risk in pilgrims, especially those who have not completed their immuni sation schedule. 91 Tuberculosis is the commonest cause of death from an infectious disease worldwide. 37 A large percentage of Hajj pilgrims come from high tuberculosisendemic coun tries. The burden of undiagnosed active pulmonary tuberculosis in pilgrims attending the 2015 Hajj from five high tuberculosisendemic countries was evaluated by a study randomly screening 1164 pilgrims, 36 of which 15 had previously undiagnosed active pulmonary tuberculosis. With millions of pilgrims visiting Saudi Arabia from high tuberculosis endemic areas, cases of undiagnosed active pulmonary tuberculosis will continue to pose a risk to other pilgrims. Further studies are required to define the scale of the tuberculosis during the Hajj and to develop proactive screening, treatment, and prevention guidelines. 92 Several studies also done on enteric pathogens during the Hajj show the emergence of antibioticresistant bacteria (appendix). 33, 34, 93 To prevent emergence of and spread of antibioticresistant bacteria, antibiotic pre scription and consumption by pilgrims at mass gathering events should be rationalised and regulated. Antibiotic stewardship and good prescribing practices should be promoted amongst healthcare providers.",

            "text": "More countryspecific religious mass gathering events exist that attract smaller numbers of pilgrims from neighbouring countries or overseas. Several religious mass gatherings occur on a yearly basis in Iraq, drawing millions of pilgrims from across the country. The Arbaeen is one of the largest, during which pilgrims from Iraqi provinces visit the holy shrine in Karbala, and poses major public health challenges. 114 In West Africa, each year up to 5 million Muslim pilgrims from the Mouride community in Senegal, and from neighbouring countries, assemble in the holy city of Touba in Senegal for the Grand Magal religious pilgrimage, 115 the largest religious mass gathering in West Africa. This pilgrimage attracts individuals from outside Africa and has the potential for globalisation of local endemic infectious diseases. 115 Research on communicable diseases and non communicable diseases, including heatrelated disorders and disasters, with a more collaborative approach between local and international researchers and organisers of mass gathering events is required. The creation of the Africa Centres for Diseases Control (Africa CDC) on Jan 31, 2017, in Addis Ababa by the African Union, with five regional CDCs in Gabon, Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya, and Zambia, 116 creates major opportunities for improving coordination and public health capacitybuilding initiatives in partner ship with organisers of sporting and religious mass gathering events. For example, the majority of the live stock for ritual sacrifices during the Hajj are exported from Africa to the Middle East-the One Human EnvironmentalAnimal Health approach 101, 117, 118 should be adopted in partnership with Africa CDC. This initiative should aim to define the risk and threats to global health security and help reduce the risk of outbreaks and spread of zoonotic infections, such as Rift Valley fever, MERS CoV, Ebola, and other viral haemorrhagic fevers, across Mass gathering events provide unique opportunities for crosscontinental multidisciplinary collaborations on public health and basic science research, which will allow for the development of a strong evidence base for public health planning and health services at mass gatherings (panel 5). Although the formalisation of mass gatherings medicine has led to an increase in research studies into the specific health issues affecting pilgrims at the Hajj, they have not been forthcoming for the Kumbh Mela and other mass gatherings. Research output from mass gathering events is focused on small studies of pilgrims from individual countries and the data are not generalisable and no outputs have changed global policy. A need remains for more coordinated action by a global coalition of interested partners to share experiences from various mass gathering events, gather and translate appropriate evidence base into public health policy, and push for the best health promotion and educational policies. The creation of a mass gathering medicine specialist society or formal network, with a dedicated journal, might generate more frequent dialogue and enhance international collaborations on mass gathering medicine. A need also remains for high quality studies that are appropriately designed and adequately powered using participants from several geographical regions to provide data that stand up to rigorous scientific review. Advances in technology and closer monitoring of pilgrims at the Hajj provide an opportunity for large cohort studies of attendees of mass gathering events. These studies could focus on infectious diseases priorities, inc luding neglected tropical diseases, 119 noncom municable diseases, mental health, and heatrelated disorders (panels 4 and 5). The widespread availability of next generation sequencing, genotyping and phenotyping, and other molecular methods also provides an opportunity for analyses of health risks among large population cohorts and for appropriate research to obtain an evidence base for the production of WHOapproved guidelines, which will be useful for countries that host mass gathering events.",
