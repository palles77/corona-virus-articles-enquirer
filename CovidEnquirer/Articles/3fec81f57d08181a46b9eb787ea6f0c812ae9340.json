Between February 25, 2003 , when the first SARS patient returned to Taiwan from China, and April 21, 2003, when a large-scale nosocomial infection was recognised, 30 probable and 50 suspected SARS cases were reported. All were visitors who had returned from various parts of China via Hong Kong (figure 1). During this phase, all reported SARS patients regardless of whether they were considered to be suspected or probable (according to the criteria recommended by WHO) cases, were all hospitalised in negative-pressure isolation rooms, which had been established mainly for patients with tuberculosis. By the end of April, the major SARS epidemics in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Canada had plateaued, and the medical community in Taiwan became complacent since each imported SARS case was quickly identified, and secondary transmission was successfully blocked. Consequently, an unidentified SARS patient who had no travel history abroad, was not diagnosed promptly and that, coupled with a lapse in hospital infection-control practices, triggered a large-scale nosocomial SARS transmission in a municipal hospital in Taipei; this was followed by a series of nosocomial infections in seven hospitals due to the interhospital movement of unrecognised SARS patients. This chain of transmission from one hospital to another was subsequently confirmed by a genome analysis of the viruses, which verified the epidemiological link between outbreaks in all seven hospitals. 13 In the end, 80% of the confirmed 346 SARS patients in Taiwan were acquired in a hospital, and 30% (n=102) of them were health-care workers.

During the SARS outbreak, passengers with fevers were prohibited from boarding the aeroplane. A hospital near each airport was designated to house, diagnose, and treat any passengers found with fever at the airport. Interestingly, in the summer through fall of 2003, 15 cases of imported dengue and/or malaria were identified at the airports. In part, it is believed that such a fever screening system would serve to deter SARS patients from international travel, and could reduce the international spread of SARS. However, due to the difference in the timing of infectivity in relation to the time of symptom onset (figure 3), how well this screening device can prevent international spread of infections other than SARS remains to be evaluated.",

Daily fever screening of all school children up to the ninth grade, a policy initiated during the SARS epidemic, has also been continued at all schools, and children with a body temperature of 38 \u00ba C or more are kept in the school infirmary or sent home. Fever patients staying at home should be in isolation, and should wear a surgical mask whenever in contact with other family members. Those patients whose fever persists are evaluated in fever clinics where patients are routinely grouped and triaged according to their indications and case histories. During periods without any known SARS transmissions in the world, SARS will be considered in the differential diagnosis for laboratory testing only in the event of having pneumonia, or in the case of fever patients who cluster in time and space, or in the case of patients who do not respond to antibiotic therapy for 3 days. These measures are implemented to avoid testing a large number of clinical samples using the currently available nucleic acid-based reverse transcriptase-PCR method, because the small percentage of false-positives associated with this method would involve unnecessary public-health measures that would incur a heavy workload on hospital personnel, and possibly social panic.",

Young children, elderly patients, and patients with a high risk for severe influenza infection should be evaluated early if a fever develops, and given antiviral drugs early when deemed necessary. In the winter of 2003-2004, the Taiwan CDC for the first time distributed an antiviral drug, oseltamivir, through public-health channels to health-care facilities for aggressive prophylactic therapy. The goal is to reduce the demand for isolation hospital wards if a SARS resurgence occurs. In addition, all influenza A viruses isolated from potential SARS patients are sent to the Taiwan CDC for subtyping. The interesting correlation of a low influenza season during the past winter in Taiwan, and the stringent preventive measures described above is currently being critically evaluated by the Taiwan CDC.

The public-health code was revised in March 2003 to place the implementation and enforcement of these control measures on a legal ground. By the end of the SARS outbreak, 211 945 people, 0\u00b792% of the total population in Taiwan, who either had contact with a SARS patient or had returned from a SARS-affected area, were quarantined for 10-14 days. 21 Only 133 (0\u00b706%) of the quarantined were later reported as probable or suspected SARS cases. Furthermore, among the limited number of confirmed SARS patients who acquired SARS infection outside of the hospital settings in Taiwan, SARS transmission to family members did not occur until day 3 of the onset of the fever (figure 5). After a review of the local and international epidemiological data that showed the infectivity of SARS patients began only after the onset of fever (figure 3), the quarantine policy was ultimately replaced by implementing stringent fever monitoring of the high-risk group and fever surveillance at the ports of entry. 17, 22 Further revision of the public-health code has been undertaken to accommodate the complex issues concerning the protection of rights and freedom of individuals in the context of the overall well-being of the public. In SARS patients, the onset of symptoms precedes the onset of infectiousness (figure 3), which supports the effectiveness of quarantine and fever surveillance. In the case of influenza A infection, however, the infectivity may precede the onset of illness. Thus, in the event of pandemic influenza, quarantine would not be an effective control measure. Rather, the preparation for the influenza pandemic is now focusing on stockpiling of effective antiviral drugs as well as the strengthening of the influenza vaccination programme. Taking into account the ongoing activity of H5N1 avian influenza outbreaks among human beings and birds in the neighbouring southeast Asian countries, strategies for regional alliance and a rapid delivery of international aid including antiviral drugs, to neighbouring affected countries for the purpose of containing transmission are being formulated.",

This shows how the complex network of modern medical facilities with a mix of acute and chronically ill patients, inpatients, and outpatients is extremely vulnerable to the rapid and efficient transmission of infectious diseases. The ultimate SARS control would not have been possible if the hospital transmission of SARS was not blocked. After the SARS outbreak, in addition to heightening surveillance, monitoring, and education about hospital infection control, each health-care facility is required to instigate a health surveillance system for health-care workers so that any clustering of fever cases can be detected and investigated. The Taiwan CDC collects data passively on the health surveillance of workers from each health-care facility, and the reporting can be made active if indicated in the event of a resurgence of SARS.

The SARS coronavirus isolated from the first of these four patients revealed a high homology with the SARS-like virus that had been isolated from the animals. 25 of further SARS cases is a result of the ban on palm civets remains to be seen. Whether palm civets are the authentic natural host of SARS coronavirus is still under debate; nevertheless, reintroduction of the SARS coronavirus from animal to human beings surely can occur again under certain conditions, which are as yet to be defined. The close geographic and commercial links between Taiwan and China are reflected in a daily average of 10 000-20 000 visitors entering Taiwan from China. Taiwan is therefore confronted with the possible importation of SARS cases on a daily basis. As a result, the level for SARS alert was upgraded on January 1, 2004 to level A, which indicates the presence of confirmed SARS cases in other countries. 26 Taiwan CDC kicked off several prevention measures, including intensifying fever surveillance of all travellers arriving from China, and expediting laboratory diagnosis of SARS coronavirus among testing for patients who recently had arrived from China and Hong Kong. In addition, stowaways from China, if caught in Taiwan are quarantined for 10 days before being sent home. Moreover, all employers are asked to provide assistance in conducting fever surveillance of their employees who travel to and from China or Hong Kong. The SARS alert was downgraded on February 25, 2004 when it was certain that no secondary transmission had occurred in Guangdong.",

It should be reiterated that prevention measures will have to be adjusted to account for the similarities and differences between SARS and influenza. Both SARS and pandemic influenza are likely to be zoonotic in nature, and establishing the capability for early detection in initial human cases is the key to preventing large-scale human transmission. While both diseases carry a considerable surge potential in terms of the number of patients and health-care workers potentially affected, antiviral drugs that can be used for prophylaxis are available to fight influenza. However, the demand for the antiviral may be high and will require countries to stock adequate supplies in advance. If transmission begins in human beings at any focal point, the speed at which influenza spreads will depend on how early it is detected, and how fast the international community can mobilise and deliver assistance, including providing antiviral drugs for prophylactic use. Therefore, in addition to a national preparedness plan, Taiwan scientists and government officials are also actively seeking international collaborations with neighbouring countries in Asia, since Taiwan is, hitherto, usually barred from activities coordinated by WHO.",
