These are serious and principal limitations, because the goal of researchers is investigation of the biologically active RNA structure, which is attained in solutions of definite composition, and specific protein factors are sometimes required for correct folding and functioning.

Chemical methods allow detection of some specific spatial arrangements of nucleotides that bind metal ions and metal complexes. Crosslinking with chemical reagents allows the determination of intramolecular distances between certain nucleotides in the RNA tertiary structure. A key advantage of these methods is the ability to study RNAs too large for crystallographic and NMR studies and the possibility to investigate structures of nonpurified RNAs in complex systems containing various factors, or even RNA bound to specific proteins. Information from the probing experiments allows one to identify the real RNA structure among a number of potential structures that can be predicted from sequence data and free energy parameters, and from data of phylogenetic studies in which sequences of a particular RNA from diverse species are compared in order to infer the existence of base-paired regions.",

The double-stranded helices of RNA assume the A form in physiological conditions, with 11 base-pairs per single turn. Long, regular, uninterrupted helices are rare in most RNAs. A typical element of local RNA structure is an 8to 10-base-pair segment incorporating a bulge or mismatch ( Fig. 1 ).

The lengths of the produced labeled fragments are determined by comparison to the length standards, to locate precisely the reactive nucleotides.

The second line (L) is the ladder produced by limited alkaline hydrolysis of the RNA, providing statistical cleavages of all phosphodiester bonds. A radiolabeled oligodeoxyribonucleotide primer is annealed to the 3' end of the RNA. Reverse transcription of the modified molecules is terminated at the modified residues and yields shortened transcripts. (B) The length of the transcripts is determined by gel electrophoresis.

The relative shift of the bands in the lanes is explained by termination of the reverse transcription at a nucleotide preceding the modified residue. size; it also allows one to detect chemical modifications that do not cleave RNA. Analysis of modified RNAs using the primer extension method is performed by annealing a complementary oligodeoxynucleotide primer to the 3' end of the RNA and synthesizing a cDNA copy of RNA using reverse transcriptase and dNTPs. Elongation proceeds from the 3' end of the primer and it is terminated prematurely when the enzyme meets scissions or chemically modified nucleotides and stops.

Thus, the small protein ribonuclease A shows a very high tendency to cleave Y-A linkages in single-stranded regions of RNA.

A few reagents do allow probing the accessibility of universal constituents of RNA structure. Ethylnitrosourea reacts with phosphates in single-stranded and in double-stranded regions of RNA, if they are not buried in the structure (10, 13, 32).

It was tested on yeast tRNAPhe (41) and it was shown that, in the native tRNA, riboses in the core of the molecule are protected from the modification. The reaction was used for investigation of structure of the self-splicing intron of Tetrahymena themophila (41) and for monitoring the folding process of this catalytic RNA by probing the RNA structure in solutions containing different concentrations of metal ions (42, 43). From the modification data, an interior-exterior surface map of the folded RNA was constructed. The determination of positions where the phosphodiester backbone of the RNA is on the inside or on the outside of the molecule provides constraints for modeling the three-dimensional structure of the ribozyme. It was found that the overall tertiary structure of this RNA forms cooperatively with the uptake of at least three magnesium ions, and that the high-order RNA foldings produced by Mg, Ca, and Sr ions are similar. Also, local folding transitions display different metal-ion dependencies, suggesting that the RNA tertiary structure assembles through a specific folding intermediate before the final structure is formed. The Fe(I1)-EDTA cleavage was also used for probing the structures of mutated Tetrahymena ribozymes and to explore the role of individual structural elements in the tertiary folding of the RNAs. The results have allowed identification of different mutations that destabilize folding of the RNA and shift the optimal conditions of folding of the catalytic core to higher MgCI, concentrations (43).",

The reaction is facilitated by a favorable relative orientation of the two residues in the tRNA structure. Another example is the UVinduced formation of the C48-U59 cyclobutane dimer in yeast tRNAPhe (54). In the folded structure of this tRNA, the two pyrimidine rings are adjacent to one another in the folded structure and their 5,6 double bonds are nearly parallel and juxtaposed. This allows efficient cross-linking to occur following irradiation with short-wavelength UV light. The efficiency and kinetics of these cross-linking reactions provide a simple approach for comparison of the state of structure around the reacting residues in different tRNAs and the effect of different conditions on tRNA structure. Experiments with different tRNAs show that the reaction is very sensitive to structural changes involving the nearby pyrimidines and therefore can be used for analysis of conformational state (53).",

In both RNAs, formation of two intramolecular cross-links was observed between residues for a part in the primary sequences of the molecules. The identification of the positions of the reactive residues was performed using the following procedure.

These three-ring heterocyclic compounds (Fig. 13) intercalate into double-stranded regions of RNA; on irradiation with UV light (365 nm), they undergo a photochemical addition to heterocyclic bases of RNA located at a distance of about 8 6. The intercalated psoralen attaches covalently to pyrimidine nucleosides, especially to uridine, by cyclobutane linkages to one nucleotide, producing a monoadduct, or to two nucleosides, producing cross-links. On activation with UV light, either the 3,4-pyrone double bond or the 4',5'-furan double bond of psoralen photoreacts with the 5,6 double bond of a pyrimidine to form a pyrimidine-psoralen monoadduct. Reaction of the 3,4-pyrone double bond destroys the coumarin nucleus and leads to monoadduct formation. If the reaction occurs with the 4',5'-furan double bond, the coumarin nucleus of the compound remains intact and can absorb light at 365 nm for its 3,4-pyrone double bond to react with the 5,6 double bond of another pyrimidine to form a cross-link. Psoralen derivatives prefer to react with uracils near internal loops but not in loops or within perfect double helices (60). RNA molecules cross-linked by psoralen can be fractionated by gel electrophoresis in denaturing conditions. Although psoralen does not modify positions participating in Watson-Crick pairing, the cyclobutane adduct terminates reverse transcription because of the change in the uracil geometry. Therefore the sites of cross-links can be determined by primer-extensions with reverse transcriptase. An example of cross-linking with psoralen for structural studies is the investigation of secondary structure of the SPG/mouse insulin precursor RNA (55). The RNA was treated with psoralen under conditions providing statistically less than one cross-link per RNA molecule, and individual fractions of the cross-linked RNA were isolated by gel electrophoresis in denaturing conditions. These RNAs were used as templates for reverse transcription to identify the cross-linking sites. A series of long-range contacts were detected within the 5'-half of the pre-mRNA that contains the intervening sequence. Because some of the interactions showed common sites, it was concluded that the RNA exists as a mixture of conformers. The pre-mRNAs with psoralen cross-links in different positions were used as substrates for in uitro splicing, and it was found that psoralen cross-linking of nucleotides in any of the double-stranded regions of RNA inhibited splicing, suggesting that a destabilization of secondary structure of the RNA precursor is required for splicing to occur in vitro. It was concluded that a melting of double-stranded regions within the pre-mRNA occurs before the endonucleolytic cleavage.",

One example is the photocrosslinking between pyrimidines in specific positions of some tRNAs (52-54), which occurs only in the native tRNA structure and can serve as a test for maintenance of the biologically active conformation. Another example of such probes is represented by cleavage of RNA with certain metal ions. Scission of RNA by coordinated metal ions is a simple and sensitive test for detection of the cation-binding regions and for probing the state of the RNA structure. Thus, highly specific hydrolysis of some tRNAs by Pb2+ occurs due to the presence of tight metal-binding sites in the RNA (70-73). The cleavage results in the formation of 2':3'-cycli~-phosphate and 5'-hydroxyl termini. Cleavage of tRNAPhe between nucleotides U17 and G18 was a sensitive way to identify and correctly position the two leadcoordinated pyrimidines. Nucleotide substitutions that disrupted the tertiary interactions of tRNAPhe reduced the rate of cleavages dramatically. This cleavage reaction has been exploited as a sensitive probe for the tertiary folding of RNA variants (71, 72 ).",

He noted that the total number of conformations of an N-monomer chain is g N , where g is the number of stable conformations of the monomer. It is therefore clear that the native conformation of a long biopolymer cannot be achieved for any biologically reasonable time by randomly trying all the conformations. Initially, the idea was suggested for proteins (128). As first postulated (129, 130) and then demonstrated (131, 132), there must be a process underway such that the protein molecule passes a sequence of kinetically attainable states toward native spatial structure. This may also apply to RNA molecules. Presumably, during the formation of secondary structure the RNA molecule passes through kinetically attainable states with a gradual (in most cases) reduction in energy, certain elements of secondary structure being formed at each step (133).

A later algorithm (132) was based on the step-wise formation of secondary structure, the energy of which was calculated through thermodynamic parameters. At any step the structure would acquire such a helix from among all possible ones, whose formation would provide the maximum gain in free energy. Of a total of 80 tRNAs that had passed through the algorithm, 55% resulted in secondary structures of the \"cloverleaf\" type. A similar folding algorithm (133) used improved thermodynamical parameters. Its speed was N2, which is much faster than the combinatorial and the recursive algorithms. Testing showed a good correspondence between the secondary structure predicted by this algorithm and the data on cleavage of RNA molecules by nucleases (133).

In fact, this implies that, in the course of folding, the secondary structure becomes more and more \"frozen,\" which shows up in difficulties of large conformational rearrangements. Accordingly, the kinetic algorithm (139, 143) was modified so as to account for a division of the kinetic ensemble of secondary structures into clusters. A cluster involves the conformations that are similar topologically and apt to undergo rapid transition into one another. From this viewpoint, the simulation of folding reduces to the description of kinetics of intercluster transitions.

In fact, this is a sort of simulation of RNA folding with only invariant helices allowed. The procedure follows the standard rules of stereochemical compatibility of helices ( Fig. 16) . A testing of the algorithm on the known secondary structures as tRNA, 5-S RNA, and 164 RNA showed a good agreement between the predicted and canonical structures. In fact, the method at issue (155) is the first practically effective comparative approach regarding storage capacity and time consumption.

Interestingly, the invariant RNA secondary structure reconstructed with this method (155) for the TAR fragment of 200 nt from type 1 human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) coincides with the lowest energy structure predicted for this fragment by the FOLD program (155).

If so, the following approach may be effective: (1) search for a set of suboptimal secondary structures for each RNA under study by one of the thermodynamic or kinetic methods; (2) compare the sets and the choice of secondary structure that is invariant for all sequences under comparison. Many methods have been proposed for comparison of secondary structures within the frame of this approach. All of them depend on the manner in which the secondary structure is coded and on further comparison of the resulting codes. Under one of the versions, hairpin, internal, bulge, and multiple loops relate to tree vertices, and helices to edges (157-159). Under another version (160), helices relate to vertices, and loops to edges. Thus constructed, the trees can be compared by one of the methods. For example, RNA secondary structure can be translated into a symbol string (158). In particular, the symbol of the corresponding local secondary structure can be assigned to each nucleotide. The resulting symbol strings can be aligned by one of the procedures of painvise or multiple alignment. One of the advantages of this approach is that it is possible to use the routine of alignment. A significant drawback is that this approach provides a rough description of the compared secondary structures neglecting their individual features. This is not a serious problem when analyzing highly homologous sequences, but it surely is when the sequences are evolutionarily remote.",

These methods allow a detailed consideration of the RNA secondary structure. In particular, the method based on the construction of the so-called tree of cycles for RNA secondary structure provides its detailed description in linear or nonlinear code (162). With this method, types and the mutual disposition of loops, helices, and even the pairs of complementary nucleotides in helices can be described. To save computation time, at the next stage a condensed tree is constructed. In this tree a set of helices split by internal or bulge loops is regarded as a nonbranching helix, and a separate vertex is assigned to such a helix. With this approach, the reconstruction of an invariant secondary structure was performed for a highly variable domain D3 of the rRNA of large ribosomal subunit (162). The secondary structure of this domain has been re-constructed for each of the three major kingdoms: prokaryotes, eukaryotes, and archeaebacteria. What is essential is that, apart from having the common features (helices A, B, C, and D), these domains contain specific elements of secondary structure that are invariant only within a kingdom (Fig. 22) . The comparative approach works. This is the assumption that RNA secondary structure is invariant within any given group of sequences. Whether secondary structure is invariant should be checked in each individual case, because while the primary structure of RNA was evolving, so was the secondary structure. Nevertheless, this approach has a sound motivation, a pronounced hierarchy of the variability levels corresponding to the levels of RNA organization: primary structure is the most variable, secondary structure is less variable, and tertiary structure is highly conserved. This is well exemplified by the fragments of genomic RNA from some plant viruses considered in Section II,E. These fragments have a tRNA-like tertiary structure that displays a high structural similarity with the L-shaped tRNA (163). At the level of secondary structure, similarity is slight, and none of it can be detected at the level of primary structure. Each of the above approaches relies on definite features of structure, function, and evolution of RNA secondary structure and, therefore, has certain advantages. Nonetheless, the most reliable results appear to be expected of a combination of experimental and computer methods. Such a combined approach was applied (164) to identify the packaging signal of HIV-1. Loops were localized using diethylpyrocarbonate (DEP) and RNase S1. The former is specific to the A sites of the single-stranded RNA, the latter to the A and U sites. Low-energy secondary structures were determined by the program FOLD of the software package GCG. The homologous sequences of HIV-1 strains were compared for the presence of evolutionarily invariant secondary structure. Indeed, the lowest energy secondary structure, namely, a stem of three helices separated by loops (Fig. l) , was revealed by DEP and S1-RNase cleavage of RNA.",

Pseudoknots were discovered in studies of turnip yellow mosaic virus (TYMV) RNA (see 166). As it turned out, this RNA resembles tRNA in several respects (Fig. 23) . In particular, it is able to accept Val-tRNA at its 3' end. However, further investigations (168) showed that the secondary structure of the 3' end of this RNA, constituted by four helices (I-IV), is quite unlike a \"cloverleaf.\" Meanwhile, it was possible to regard the 3' end structure as a three-dimensional L-shaped tRNA by assuming that the pseudoknot forms owing to complementary interaction between the CCC fragment near helix I1 and the GGG fragment in the hairpin loop of helix I. Computer simulations showed that the tertiary structure of this fragment of RNA with a pseudoknot is similar to the L-shaped tertiary structure of tRNA (163) . With the use of pseudoknot structure, spatial models were also suggested for the His-and Tyr-accepting domains at the 3' ends of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) RNA and brome mosaic virus (BMV) RNA (170-172). There are four types of loops that may contain a single-stranded region involved in the formation of a pseudoknot, namely, hairpin, bulge, internal, and multiple. Note that the complementary region to be paired with may either be related to one of the loop types mentioned or be in the singlestranded region of RNA. Thus 14 different types of pseudoknots may exist, depending on the location of the complementary regions by which they are formed (166).",

The dependence becomes linear for sequences with lengths exceeding 20 to 30 nt. On the average, a fragment of this length contains 1 to 3 helices and loops.

Thus {G,C} is a stronger alphabet than {A,U). Calculations show that a stronger alphabet favors the formation of more low-energy secondary structure. Besides, a stronger alphabet provides higher compactness of the resulting secondary structure (the less the number of loops and the higher the number of paired bases, the higher compactness). The reason here is that, ceteris paribus, the helices based on a strong alphabet are more stable than those on a weaker. High stability of helices provides possibilities of shortloop closure. As was indicated, loop formation entails energy loss (Table 11) . That is why loop closure is impossible unless there are highly stable helices involved. Besides, the stronger the alphabet, the higher the number of helices in RNA secondary structure, because even short helices become stable enough to compensate for the energy loss owing to the loop closure.",

Intrinsically, chemical probing is a high-resolution method because it allows investigation of the reactivities of individual functional groups of the RNA. It does not allow discovery of novel elements in an RNA. This can be done only by physical methods (X-ray analysis and NMR). However, when a structural element is discovered and characterized, it can be detected by probing techniques in novel RNA species and thus taken into account when building high-resolution models. Enzymatic and chemical probes are becoming increasingly more important for detecting structural variations, for monitoring conformational changes of RNA, for investigating effects of mutations on the RNA structure, and for investigating RNA-protein complexes. A great advantage of probing techniques is the possibility of investigating RNA structure in complex systems regardless of the presence of other biopolymers, when other methods are not applicable. Further development of the chemistry of probes and progress in computer modeling will provide researchers with new, simple, and reliable methods for investigation of RNAs at any level of complexity and for investigations of the dynamics of RNA-protein complexes in the cell.",

Because the ribosephosphate backbone within the single-stranded regions is less rigid, compared to the more structured regions of RNA, single-stranded regions are more susceptible to hydrolysis by imidazole buffer (46). Figure 8 shows the positions of those phosphodiester bonds sensitive to hydrolysis by imidazole in a small folded RNA molecule. It is seen that the cleavages occur within the single-stranded regions of the RNA. Spermine-imidazole conjugate in the presence of imidazole buffer cleaves preferentially Y-R sequences in the single-stranded regions of the molecule. Direct correlations between chemical reactivities of nucleotides within RNA and conformation of the nucleic acids are well established by studies on tRNAs in which chemical reactivity patterns could be explained by crystallographic structures. The knowledge obtained on the reaction specificity allowed investigations of a great number of RNAs and RNA-protein complexes by chemical mapping procedures combined with modeling. In addition to identification of single-and double-stranded regions of RNA structure, chemical and enzymatic probes allow investigation of the stability of L2 \\@ 0 L1 FIG. 8.

Comparison of the operator sequences of phages T2, T4, and T6 containing this gene provides phylogenetic evidence for the conservation of this pseudoknot. The binding of the proteins encoded by the corresponding mKNA to the pseudoknots in the 5' leader nontranslated regions of phage mRNA can provide the autoregulation of translation of the corresponding mRNA (166).",
