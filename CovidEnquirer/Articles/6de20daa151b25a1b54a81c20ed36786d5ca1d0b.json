The frequent appearance of respiratory infections in DS is attributed to structural and functional anomalies of the respiratory system, the presence of congenital heart malformations and IgG deficits. We present three clinical cases of adult DS patients with community-acquired pneumonia, and a review of the literature regarding: epidemiology, prevalence, symptomatology, laboratory and radiographic findings, morbidity, mortality, clinical evolution and the importance of prevention of pneumonia in DS patients. These patients presented symptoms of acute infection of the lower respiratory tract: high fever, scanty productive cough with or without sputum, pleuritic chest pain, dyspnea, fatigue, myalgia, and other atypical symptoms. Chest radiography showed focal inflammatory condensation in the affected lung and bilateral alveolo-interstitial infiltrate. Laboratory tests showed increased values of leukocytes and C-reactive protein, deficiency of IgG and low lymphocyte CD4+. Patients with DS are highly susceptible to lower and higher respiratory tract infection. Community physicians should take exceptional precautions on detecting respiratory symptoms in these patients, since they may result in pneumonia and bronchopneumonia. Presentation may be atypical and the complications may even lead to mortality.",

Neumon\u00eda adquirida en la comunidad en pacientes adultos con s\u00edndrome de Down. Presentaci\u00f3n de tres casos cl\u00ednicos y revisi\u00f3n de la literatura Resumen John Langdon Down fue el primero en describir el cuadro cl\u00ednico de esta alteraci\u00f3n gen\u00e9tica caracterizada por trisom\u00eda del cromosoma 21, tambi\u00e9n conocida como s\u00edndrome de Down (SD). La frecuente aparici\u00f3n de infecciones respiratorias en el SD se atribuye a numerosas anomal\u00edas estructurales y funcionales, a la presencia de malformaciones cong\u00e9nitas card\u00edacas y a d\u00e9ficits de IgG. Se presentan tres casos cl\u00ednicos de pacientes adultos con SD que padecieron una neumon\u00eda adquirida en la comunidad y se realiza una revisi\u00f3n bibliogr\u00e1fica considerando los aspectos epidemiol\u00f3gicos, la prevalencia, el cuadro cl\u00ednico, los datos de laboratorio y los radiol\u00f3gicos, la morbimortalidad, la evoluci\u00f3n y la importancia de la prevenci\u00f3n. Estos pacientes pueden presentar s\u00edntomas de infecci\u00f3n aguda del aparato respiratorio bajo, como fiebre alta, tos con o sin expectoraci\u00f3n, dolor tor\u00e1cico por irritaci\u00f3n pleural, disnea, fatiga, mialgias, as\u00ed como otros s\u00edntomas at\u00edpicos. La radiograf\u00eda de t\u00f3rax puede mostrar un foco de condensaci\u00f3n inflamatoria en un pulm\u00f3n, o un infiltrado alveolointersticial bilateral. La anal\u00edtica de sangre puede mostrar leucocitosis, aumento de la prote\u00edna C reactiva, deficiencia de IgG y de los linfocitos CD4+. Los pacientes con SD son altamente susceptibles a padecer infecciones respiratorias del tracto superior como del inferior. Los m\u00e9dicos deben tener especial precauci\u00f3n ante la presencia de s\u00edntomas respiratorios en estos pacientes, ya que en muchas ocasiones pueden desarrollar neumon\u00edas y bronconeumon\u00edas que se presentan de forma at\u00edpica y con complicaciones que se acompa\u00f1an de alta mortalidad. \u00a9 2010 Fundaci\u00f3 Catalana S\u00edndrome de Down.
