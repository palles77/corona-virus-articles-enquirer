            "text": "The laws pertaining to authorization for autopsy vary among the states. Local jurisdictions may establish policies or procedures for compliance, and it behooves the practicing pathologist to know the relevant statutes in his or her region. In the United States, statutes pertaining to human remains stem from Old English common law. 2 Thus, at death, possession or custody of the remains passes to a surviving spouse or legal next of kin. The legal custodian of the deceased has the duty to arrange proper disposition of the remains. Although this individual does not have ordinary property rights to the corpse, he or she may authorize an autopsy; donate tissues, organs, or the entire body for therapeutic or educational purposes; or, following appropriate legal statutes, have the remains cremated or embalmed and moved to a final resting place. The next of kin may place restrictions on the extent and manner in which an autopsy is performed. Any unauthorized dissection may be considered mutilation and is tortious or even criminal. 3 Tissue and organ retention is regulated in the United States under state rather than federal law; other countries such as Australia and the United Kingdom have enacted specific legislation with respect to retention of organs, mostly in response to organ retention controversies starting with public outcry in 1999 regarding organ retention from autopsies performed at a Liverpool children's hospital. 4 Changes in statutes regarding autopsy authorization are evolving in many jurisdictions to increase the autonomy of families to restrict either the extent of autopsy or retention of organs. 5 Svendsen and Hill 6 surveyed autopsy law in a number of industrialized countries. Although there has been a tendency for countries to enact laws requiring next-of-kin authorization for autopsy, there are still a number of nations (Italy, Austria, and many of the countries of Eastern Europe) that give the authority to perform postmortem examinations to the medical or legal community, or both. In some countries (Denmark, France, Iceland, Norway), objections from members of the decedent's family may prevent autopsies authorized by the medical community.",

The death is indicated by the fact that\u2026the fetus does not breathe or show any other evidence of life such as a beating of the heart\u2026 or definitive movement of voluntary muscles\" effectively corresponding to an Apgar score of zero. Reporting of fetal deaths is required in almost all states for fetuses that are either 20 weeks or more of gestation or more than 350, 400, or 500 grams, depending on the state. Requirements for autopsy authorization usually correspond to the reporting requirements for fetal deaths. For example, in the state of California, stillborn fetuses of less than 20 weeks' gestation do not require authorization for autopsy but rather may be handled according to the rules covering organs and tissues removed surgically. However, the law does not establish a standard for determining whether a fetus has advanced to 20 weeks' gestation, and a parent may object to postmortem examination of a stillborn fetus of less than 20 weeks' gestation, so it may be prudent to require an autopsy consent for autopsies on all fetuses regardless of age. Stillbirths of 20 weeks' gestation and beyond require a fetal death certificate, and the usual laws related to disposition of the body pertain; it is our policy to send all autopsied fetuses to the medical facility's usual storage area for bodies, even if the body originated from an operating room or delivery suite.",

Why is this so? First, it is the decedent's clinician who has the closest rapport with family members and is best positioned to approach the next of kin with the sensitivity that the situation requires. Second, the clinician is probably present at the time of death; he or she notifies the family of the event and helps the family begin dealing with the legal responsibilities that accompany the death of a relative. Finally, except in situations in which the family actively requests a postmortem examination, the clinician is usually most persuasive because he or she is interested in the answers to unresolved clinical questions. Although all these reasons explain the situation of consent through proxy, the pathologist is potentially vulnerable to an improperly obtained informed consent. For these reasons, institutions may elect to require stricter criteria for autopsy consent than required by state law.",

            "text": "Regardless of whether physicians or other health care workers obtain the authorization, the autopsy consent form should include an adequate description of the procedure and provisions for retention of fluids, tissues, organs, and prosthetic and implantable devices as deemed necessary by the pathologist for diagnostic, scientific, educational, or therapeutic purposes. The autopsy consent should state, and the individual consenting to autopsy should be informed of, the eventual appropriate disposition of these materials by the pathologist or hospital. The College of American Pathologists has provided a sample autopsy consent form ( Fig. 2-1 ). 16 Hospitals serving large numbers of patients who do not speak English should provide written translations of the autopsy consent form. We find it helpful to provide these on the back side of our consent form. In an age of increasingly powerful methods of genetic analysis, autopsy consent forms may need modification to ensure that the pathologists, the guardians of human tissues removed for diagnostic purposes, maintain strict confidentiality not just for the patient but also for his or her descendants, who may have inherited similar genetic risks for disease. 17 legal age who is an acquaintance of the deceased and is assuming responsibility for burial may be allowed to authorize autopsy under the laws of some states. 9 The enactment of anatomic gifts acts and related laws provides a living person with the authority to will his or her body or its parts for transplantation, anatomic instruction, or research. Included in the statutes of many states are provisions for allowing individuals to authorize specific disposition of their remains, including postmortem examination. However, in a majority of these states, an individual's directives regarding autopsy or interment, or both, may be nullified by the objection of the legal next of kin after death. 10 Before death, the decedent may indicate objection, and in some jurisdictions this is sufficient to prevent routine postmortem examination. 11 Some statutes include provisions stating that consent from only one of several persons with custody of the remains is sufficient. In such cases, the wishes of the relative accepting responsibility for burial are often given preference. 9 Because disposition of a dead body requires timely action, failure of an individual to assert these rights constitutes a waiver of the right. 12 When a party waives these rights, he or she cannot also allege wrongful autopsy. However, some statutes clearly indicate that objection by another person with equal right of custody may preclude an autopsy. Thus it seems that a pathologist should seek local legal guidance, such as from the health care organization's risk management group, before proceeding with a postmortem examination in which he or she is aware of conflicts among equal next of kin.",

Exceptions occur with communicable diseases because the responsible physician or health care worker has a legal or ethical obligation to notify public health authorities, warn endangered third parties such as sexual partners or other close contacts, advise health personnel involved with the care of the patient, and alert funeral directors or others who might have contact with infectious tissues or fluids. In the United States, state laws stipulate which diseases physicians must report to public health agencies. Thus the pathologist has a legal obligation to report cases when certain infectious diseases come to light at autopsy. Diseases that are deemed notifiable vary slightly from state to state. However, state laws are influenced by input from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which makes annual recommendations for the list of nationally notifiable diseases (Box 2-3). 20 Most state public health agencies voluntarily report nationally notifiable diseases to the CDC. Among patients, physicians, public health officials, and the courts, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) raises significant questions and concerns regarding rights to privacy and confidentiality of patients and patients' relatives and has been the subject of specific legislation. 21, 22 These laws vary widely among states, and restrictions placed on the examination are noted.

In such situations, the pathologist assumes equal responsibility for properly notifying the medical examiner. This has particular legal consequence for the pathologist. A study by Start and colleagues 19 indicated that clinicians have considerable difficulty recognizing the full range of cases that require notification of a medical examiner or coroner. Therefore, at any stage of an autopsy-review of the medical history, prosection, or microscopic examinationat which a pathologist recognizes issues or findings that indicate that the case should be reported, it is the pathologist's obligation to notify the medical examiner or coroner. This applies equally in cases previously released by the authorities if new discoveries might place the case within their purview. Finally, notification should be made immediately at the time of discovery, not after completion of the dissection or autopsy report. As a common courtesy, the responsible pathologist should inform the physician and family of the deceased of any changes in circumstances. ",

In the modern world, in which communication in effect establishes a single great parish and the autopsy has a greater influence on the treatment of disease, others express the opinion that postmortem examinations may honor the dead through service to humanity. 35, 37 Consistent with this more liberal attitude, a formal agreement between the Chief Rabbinate of the State of Israel and the Hadassah Hospital and Medical School in Jerusalem permitted autopsies in cases required by law, when in the opinion of three physicians the cause of death cannot otherwise be established; in cases involving hereditary diseases when necessary to guide medical care for a family; or when an autopsy may save the lives of others with a similar disease. 38, 39 However, more recently enacted laws have had the effect of limiting the number of autopsies performed in Israeli hospitals. 40 in which the medical examiner or coroner must determine whether organ donation would interfere with a forensic examination.

In 1410, Pietro D'Argelata performed an autopsy on Pope Alexander V after his sudden death. In the late fifteenth century, Pope Sixtus IV issued a decree allowing the medical students at Bologna and Padua to study human remains. 41 The acceptance of autopsies by the Church was well established when, in 1556, the autopsy of Ignatius Loyola revealed stones in the kidneys, bladder, and gallbladder. 42 Recognizing an autopsy as a legitimate method for extending medical knowledge and thereby improving the health of the living, the modern Protestant attitude holds that through an autopsy the deceased still serves God by contributing to the well-being of others. 10 However, in earlier times, the opinion of anatomic dissection in Protestant countries was often unfavorable. 43 For example, in England, from the Middle Ages until the end of the nineteenth century when the first English anatomic law was passed, the major source of human bodies for anatomic study was executed criminals. This tradition produced an association of postmortem dissection with crime and contributed to the public's negative attitude toward autopsies. 10 The limited numbers of bodies available for dissection in nations under Protestant rule led to the practice of grave robbing and clandestine anatomic studies, resulting in additional adverse public reaction to dissection. 37 The Eastern Orthodox churches (Greek Orthodox Church, Russian Orthodox Church, and others) do not forbid autopsy in the belief that it may lead to knowledge for physicians that could help them treat others in the future. 44 The Church of Christ, Scientist (Christian Scientist) forbids autopsy except in cases of sudden death. 45 Jehovah's Witnesses forbid autopsy except under specific circumstances. 31",

In our experience, calls to the autopsy service from family members occur in four well-defined settings: (1) when the family has insufficient rapport with the involved physician, (2) when the physician is unavailable, (3) when the questions concern technical specifics of the autopsy, or (4) when the family has reservations about the patient's medical care.",

Therefore, whenever possible and with consideration of the families' need for timely funeral arrangements, the pathologist should accommodate the schedules of the clinicians.

The pathologist should be readily available to present autopsy findings at hospital conferences or at quality improvement meetings. In complicated cases, the pathologist also has an obligation to seek consultation from his or her pathology colleagues or, when necessary, from expert consultants. 54 In contentious cases, the pathologist should take extra care with the wording of the autopsy report to avoid unnecessary provocation of the clinical teams or the families.
