            "text": "In this study, we found that 74 patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) exhibited a rapid, dramatic decrease in numbers of circulating myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (mDCs and pDCs) during the first 2 weeks of illness (5.3-and 28.4-fold reductions for mDCs and pDCs compared with 25 healthy individuals, respectively), with slow return to normal cell numbers during convalescence (weeks 5 -7 of illness on average). In addition, numbers of circulating CD4 and CD8 T cells exhibited milder reductions (2.1-and 1.8-fold at week 1) and earlier return to normal at a mean of weeks 3 and 4, respectively. A significant inverse correlation was found between numbers of DC and T-cell subsets and high-dose steroid treatment. Our novel findings thus suggest that the acute SARS-coronavirus infection probably contributes to the initial reduction of DC and T-cell subsets in blood, and that high-dose steroid administration may subsequently exacerbate and prolong low expression of the cell subsets. These findings will aid the framing of further studies of the immunopathogenesis of SARS. D",

Beijing, the region most affected by the epidemic, reported 2521 cases and 191 deaths [2] . Shortly after the description of this new viral disease, a novel infectious coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified as its pathogenic agent. Clinical observation has revealed that hematological changes in peripheral blood and acute lung injury are the major clinical characteristics of SARS. A marked lymphocytopenia occurred in most patients during the acute phase of SARS, with CD4 and CD8 T-cell subsets particularly affected, and the degree of reduction of circulating T lymphocyte counts was found to be associated with disease severity, indicating that host immune functional changes are involved in the initiation and progression of SARS [3 -6] . Although acute lung injury and hematological manifestations have been observed in patients with SARS, the mechanisms underlying for pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection are not yet understood.",

            "text": "Dendritic cells (DCs) have been demonstrated to function in orchestrating the immune response against invading pathogens including bacteria, parasites, and viruses [7] [8] [9] . Although DCs include multiple subsets, human peripheral blood DCs can be principally grouped into at least two distinct subsets, myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) and plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), on the base of their lineages and phenotypic and functional differences [8] . In general, human mDCs are well-equipped to induce Th1 polarization via production of interleukin (IL)-12 or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a when properly stimulated. pDCs are characterized by their distinct capacity to produce large amounts of type I IFN in response to virus [10, 11] . However, the functions of each DC subset are flexible in vivo and vary according to their state of activation and the nature of the maturation stimuli given to DCs [12] . Recent clinical studies by our and other laboratories have demonstrated numerical decrease and functional impairment of both mDC and pDC subsets in blood of patients with chronic viral infections, resembling those caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [13, 14] , hepatitis C virus (HCV) [15] , and hepatitis B virus (HBV) [16, 17] . Moreover, pDC counts decrease in parallel with the progression of HIV-related disorders [14] . Currently, whether DCs participate in SARS is still unclear, since there is a paucity of clinical data concerning DCs in patients with this condition [18] .",

Steroid treatment is believed to play an immunosuppressive role and to confer clinical benefits in the treatment of SARS, though randomized clinical trials to support its clinical efficacy are not available. To investigate the role of DCs in the immune pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection and the effect of steroids on DCs in SARS patients, we serially examined circulating mDC and pDC subsets, as well as CD4 and CD8 T cells in 74 SARS patients who received steroid treatment. In addition, we screened the expression of SARS-CoV receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) on both peripheral DC and lymphocyte populations, and examined associations between DC number and specific antibody generation. [20] . Among these patients, thirtyone are males and forty-three are females. Five patients died from the disease. Average age of patients was 34.6 T 13.4 years old. All patients had a high fever (!38) before receiving steroid treatment, and all had mild or severe progressive consolidation change on serial chest radiographs in one or both sides of lungs during the first week of illness. Pneumonia severity was marked as mean chest radiograph score calculated on the basis of average percentage of area manifesting the ground glass opacification, consolidation, or nodular shadow in each lung with a maximal score of 10 (equivalent to 100% area involved). The overall chest radiographic score was the summation of scores from both lungs, with a total score of 20 [21] .",

Fig. 6 also displayed that SARS-CoV RNA and specific antibody were detectable in plasma from all of these patients (coexistence of viral RNA and antibody was observed in patients 2 and 5). Five patients (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5) were clinically in critical status and one case (patient 6) was in general (non-critical) status. Patient 1 (51 years old, male) and patient 2 (73 years old, male) exhibited extreme decrease in circulating numbers of the DC and Tcell subsets throughout high-dose steroid treatment. Both succumbed to SARS because of development of severe immune suppression or impairment, which favored multiple organ failure and development of aspergillosis, as previously reported [26] . Patients 3, 4, 5, and 6, who survived, also had low peripheral cell expression when receiving high-dose steroid treatment, but this change was reversible during convalescent phase with reduction or suspension of steroid administration.",

Its clinical progression is mostly uniform, with a tri-phasic pattern, which includes an active viral replication phase (1st -8th day of illness), immune storm or lung damage phase (8th -15th), and convalescent phase (roughly after the 16th day), though these three phases probably overlap [3, 27] . In our study, longitudinal observation demonstrated for the first time a rapid, dramatic decline and sustained period of low levels of peripheral subsets of both mDCs and pDCs. We simultaneously observed a significant but reversible decrease in both CD4 and CD8 T-cell populations, consistent with previous reports [4, 5] . SARS is character-ized by a peak in viral load in respiratory secretions around the 10th day of illness, with subsequent decrease [27] . Our findings showed that peak reduction of DC subsets often occurred around the 12th -15th day of disease and partly overlapped with the lung damage phase. Since 16 patients with SARS were not administered steroid in week 1 of illness, the initial reduction of both DC and T-cell subsets may have been due mainly to acute SARS-CoV infection.",

However, it is still unclear how the human immune system is impaired in SARS infection. Our findings showed amounts of DCs and T cells were inversely correlated with intensity of high-dose steroid treatment in SARS patients (Figs. 4 and 6), though our data should be interpreted with caution (see below). Notably, the DC subsets in blood exhibited significant delay in restoration to normal number compared with clinical recovery and resolution of pulmonary damage in our study. In addition, our findings suggest that lower counts of mDC and pDC subsets may be associated with poor prognosis in some patients, as in a previous study of low CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte counts [27] . It is likely that use of steroid at high doses (!160 mg/day) over 2 -3 weeks further exacerbated and prolonged the decrease in numbers of pDCs and mDCs in SARS patients. Therefore, long-term use of high-dose steroid therapy is potentially risky, especially for SARS patients in critical status who have other conditions like diabetes and heart disease. Compared with the mDCs and T-cell subsets, pDCs exhibited a greater decrease and slower restoration of number, suggesting at a minimum that circulating pDCs are likely to be more sensitive to steroid administration, as described by Shodell et al. [29, 30] . In addition to direct effects of SARS-CoV infection, the following mechanisms may have accounted for the reduction of circulating mDCs, pDCs, and T-cell subsets in SARS patients: (1) Steroid treatment may induce apoptosis of activated T cells [31] and T-lymphocyte movement out of the intravascular compartment [32] . In particular, the decrease of DC subsets might have been caused by preferential trafficking and recruitment of these cells into the pathologically pulmonary tissue sites from naturally circulating blood as reported in tuberculosis [33] .",

Analysis of association of myeloid dendritic cell subsets (mDCs or pDCs) with specific antibody profiles. Patients with SARS were divided into a DC-high group (n = 7) and DC-low group (n = 12) based on dynamic changes in circulating DC subsets. In the convalescent phase of illness, the DC-high group exhibited earlier increase and full restoration of cell number than the DC-low group (A and B). Plasma IgG antibody against SARS-CoV was monitored weekly as shown by the average optical density (OD) for each group determined by ELISA (C). OD value !0.105 was considered positive. Data are expressed as means topped by standard deviations. Fig. 6 . Longitudinal observation of 6 representative SARS patients over the course of illness. For each of 6 patients with SARS, the upper table shows the severity of pneumonia, detection of SARS coronavirus RNA, specific IgG antibody in plasma, and body temperature recorded on different days. The lower figure shows dynamic alterations in numbers of circulating mDCs, pDCs, CD4, and CD8 T-cell subsets as well as the doses (each being represented by given color) of steroid and ribavirin administered. y axis of DCs calibration is 0 -3/Al for patient 1 -3 and 0 -30/Al for patient 3 -6, respectively.

[21] . Findings for each patient are detailed in Results. strated lack of ACE2 expression on human DC subsets and T lymphocytes, consistent with previous findings [42] . It is thus unlikely that the decreases in numbers of circulating DC and T-cell subsets in vivo are due to direct injury by SARS-CoV infection of these cells through ACE2 molecules. In addressing this issue, some investigators have recently reported that SARS-CoV may infect macrophages through cellular phagocytosis, and enter mDCs through viral binding to surface DC-SIGN receptors [43] or other unclear mechanisms since DCs rarely express DC-SIGN in vivo [44] . Recent studies have shown that viral infection usually induces the production of large amounts of IFN-a by pDCs, as a host defense against virus [14, 45] . However, we found a significantly lower level of plasma IFN-a (161.09 T 132.69 pg/ml) in 85.7% patients in the acute phase of SARS illness than in healthy controls (867.18 T 306.50 pg/ml) [46] . This finding accords with the observed reduction of pDC number, but the precise relationship between these remains to be clarified.",
