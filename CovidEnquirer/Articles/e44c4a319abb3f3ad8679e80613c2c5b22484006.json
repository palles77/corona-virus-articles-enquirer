            "text": "There exists experimental evidence that necrotoxigenic Escherichia coli (NTEC) strains producing the cytotoxic necrotising factor 1 cause intestinal and extra-intestinal disease in piglets. On the other hand, no experimental model has been developed with NTEC strains producing the cytotoxic necrotising factor 2. In all, 14 colostrum-restricted calves were orally challenged with two strains isolated from the faeces of a diarrheic calf (B20a) or from the heart blood of a septicaemic calf (1404). All calves had diarrhoea which lasted until euthanasia in eight of them. In those calves, diarrhoea was correlated with the faecal excretion of the challenge strains. At necropsy, vascular congestion of the intestinal mucosa, hypertrophy of the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and some congestion of the lungs were observed. Bacteriology confirmed the colonisation of the intestine by the challenge strains which were also recovered from the heart blood, the lungs and/or the liver. Histological sections confirmed enterocolitis, lymphadenitis and limited bronchopneumonia. In the intestinal tissue sections, bacteria testing positive in an in situ DNA hybridisation assay with a CNF2 probe were observed. Those results were confirmed by immunohistochemistry with a polyclonal anti-O78 and a monoclonal anti-F17b antisera. Three of the five control calves receiving either saline or a CNF \u00c0 , F17a strain (25KH09) had no clinical signs or lesions. The other two presented a profuse liquid diarrhoea but those calves were positive for the presence of K99 \u00fe E. coli. In this model, both NTEC2 strains were thus, able to colonise the intestine, to cause long-lasting diarrhoea and to invade the blood stream with localisation in various internal organs in colostrumrestricted conventional newborn calves. #",

For these reasons, this factor was named cytotoxic necrotising factor or CNF (Caprioli et al., 1983) and CNF-producing E. coli were later called necrotoxigenic E. coli (NTEC) (Gonzales and Blanco, 1989) . Two different types of CNF have actually been reported (De Rycke et al., 1987 , 1990a : type-1 is similar to the one described by Caprioli et al. (1983) , with formation of rounded multinucleated cells, whereas type-2, identical to the Vir toxin (Smith, 1974) causes the formation of elongated multinucleated cells. However, CNF1 and CNF2 are closely related antigenically and genetically (De Rycke et al., 1987; Oswald et al., 1994a) . The cnf2 gene is located on the Vir plasmid (Smith, 1974; Oswald et al., 1994a) , whereas the cnf1 gene is located on the chromosome (Falbo et al., 1992) .",

In vitro, data originate from studies on cell cultures. Although purified CNF toxins cause the formation of multinucleated cells, the effect of the interaction between NTEC2 strains and HeLa cells is characterised by the production of giant mononucleated cells with the appearance of actin stress fibres and a block in the G2/M phase of the division (De Rycke et al., 1996) . The actin cytoskeleton reorganisation with the appearance of stress fibres is mediated by the CNF2 toxin, which causes hyperactivation of a small GTP binding Rho protein (Oswald et al., 1994a) . The cell cycle block in the G2/M phase is caused by a more recently described toxin, the cytolethal distending toxin type-3 (CDTIII toxin), which prevents the activation of the cdc2 protein kinase (Comayras et al., 1997; P\u00e9r\u00e8s et al., 1997) .",

De Rycke and Plassiart (1990b) investigated the effect in young lambs of intravenous injection of a partially purified preparation of CNF1. All the lambs developed severe clinical signs starting 6 h after inoculation, which consisted mainly in neurological signs and mucoid diarrhoea.

In addition, the challenge strain was not recovered at necropsy either from the intestinal content or from extra-intestinal sites. The reasons for the failure to colonise the intestines of these calves is unknown, perhaps (i) the genetic background of the animals with the absence of expression of receptor, or (ii) the absence or poor expression of the colonisation factor, in this case, F17 fimbrial adhesins, or (iii) the age of the animals with disappearance of enterocytes's receptors like for K99 adhesin (Runnels et al., 1980) . Moreover, although all possible precautions were taken to avoid infections with other pathogen organisms, rotavirus and coronavirus were detected in the faeces of calf C12, non-NTEC2 E. coli which are different from the challenge strain by PFGE from the heart blood and/or from the internal organs of calves C5, C6 and C12. Failure of colonisation by the NTEC2 strain may thus, also be the consequence of the presence of another E. coli strain in the intestine prior or concomitantly to the challenge.",
