Sometimes, new infections caused by previously non-pathogenic organisms occur and become new problems in medicine. A single case report can signal the outbreak of a new and emerging infection, and often serves as a warning to anticipate future outbreaks [1] , which is an important problem in [2] ; even more time is usually required for the development of diagnostic and therapeutic tools [2] . Searching for new therapies against new emerging infections is a critical step in management strategies. The use of Chinese medicine in this regard has become an interesting avenue of investigation. In this brief article, the use of Chinese medicine in the management of new emerging infectious diseases is summarized and discussed.",

Given its long history, Chinese medicine has been successfully used in the management of several diseases, including infections, for many thousands of years. There is little doubt that Chinese medicine is a source of \"hidden gems\" for the management of several diseases. In modern medicine, a representative example of applied Chinese medicine in the management of emerging infection is the case of classical drug-resistant malaria.",

The use of classical quinine antimalarial drug has been recommended for decades. Nevertheless, due to poorly controlled drug use in many developing tropical countries, the emergence of drug-resistant malaria has occurred [3] . The problem was initially encountered in Southeast Asia [3] , and the search for a new drug became an important issue. Finally, the success in finding a new drug against classical antimalarial drug-resistant malaria was based on the reappraisal of a Chinese medicine regimen. \"Artemisinin (Qing Hao Su, \u9752\u84bf\u7d20)\" is a traditional Chinese herb with proven antimalarial activity [4] , and is effective against classical antimalarial drug-resistant malaria. In fact, the new antimalarial drug, artemisinin, was successfully developed from Artemisinin (Qing Hao Su, \u9752\u84bf\u7d20) [5] . Presently, artemisinin is the drug of choice for management of classical drug-resistant malaria in tropical medicine [6] . The ",

In the past few years, the typical emerging influenzas are usually a serious zoonotic influenza that repeatedly occurs, with bird flu being a well-known example. As an avian-related disease, control of poultry farming is the current standard of practice against bird flu due to the lack of effective antiviral therapy, which makes the management of emerging bird flu problematic. Applications for Chinese medicine have, however, been found in this context. Chang et al. [7] noted that \"Traditional Chinese Medicine de novo derivatives may be suitable candidates of dual-targeting drugs for influenza\". The authors also noted the use of standard modern Chinese medicine databases as a basic tool for new Chinese medicine-based drug discovery against new and emerging influenzas [8] .",

As a junction between new and classical wisdom, modernized Chinese medicine can be a useful tool in the management of health problems. Standard pharmacological studies investigating traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) regimens will lead to new answers and solutions to new emerging infections. With the use of new technologies, such as biochemio informatics and medical nanotechnology, searching for new drugs based on classical Chinese medicine and the development of new formulations of Chinese medicine-based drugs can be expected in the near future (Table 1). Newly developed digital computational databases have facilitated the search for appropriate candidates for further drug studies and development, and the subsequent integration of biochemio informatics is anticipated. Focusing on the use of biochemio informatics, the role of a digital online in silico approach for the characterization of active ingredients in Chinese medicine formulations and prediction of further drug-target interactions can be performed, which can help support standard in vitro and in vivo studies. Subsequently, pharmacogenomics can also be helpful in assigning newly developed drug alternatives to an appropriate target group.
