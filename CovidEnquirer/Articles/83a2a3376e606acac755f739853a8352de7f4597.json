Here, we exploited antibody cooperativity to develop a therapeutic mAb cocktail against Ebola virus. We systematically analyzed the antibody repertoire in human survivors and identified a pair of potently neutralizing mAbs that cooperatively bound to the ebolavirus glycoprotein (GP). High-resolution structures revealed that in a twoantibody cocktail, molecular mimicry was a major feature of mAb-GP interactions. Broadly neutralizing mAb rEBOV-520 targeted a conserved epitope on the GP base region. mAb rEBOV-548 bound to a glycan cap epitope, possessed neutralizing and Fc-mediated effector function activities, and potentiated neutralization by rEBOV-520. Remodeling of the glycan cap structures by the cocktail enabled enhanced GP binding and virus neutralization. The cocktail demonstrated resistance to virus escape and protected non-human primates (NHPs) against Ebola virus disease. These data illuminate structural principles of antibody cooperativity with implications for development of antiviral immunotherapeutics.",

            "text": "Antibodies can mediate protection by direct virus neutralization and/or by engagement of innate immune cells via their Fc receptors (FcRs) (Crowe, 2017; Lu et al., 2018) . Potent neutralization, broad reactivity, and protective capacity are desirable mAb features, which could be used to select leads for development as a monotherapy or cocktail. A cocktail might offer greater efficacy and resistance to viral escape (Corti et al., 2016; Keeffe et al., 2018; Wec et al., 2019) , but the molecular and structural basis for the optimal combination of mAbs is ill-defined. Current mAb discovery approaches typically are focused on antibody variable fragment (Fv)-region-mediated biological functions of single isolated mAbs (e.g., binding and neutralization) or Fc-region-mediated effector functions (Walker and Burton, 2018) . Molecular interactions in which two or more mAbs recognize the same antigen in an enhanced (e.g., cooperative or synergistic) fashion are less well investigated, but these interactions might contribute greatly to the overall efficacy of protective cocktails (Carlsen et al., 2014; Doria-Rose et al., 2012; Howell et al., 2017; Mascola et al., 1997) . One key challenge that impedes progress in this area is that the structural determinants of cooperativity by neutralizing antibodies are poorly understood. Development of synergistic mAb cocktails against viruses with high antigenic variability, including HIV, hepatitis C, norovirus, influenza virus, or Ebola virus, is also thwarted by the fact that only a small subset of virus-specific mAbs available for incorporation in cocktails is broadly crossreactive to all field strains. Another challenge is the relatively small number of mAb combinations that can be tested iteratively for therapeutic efficacy given the high cost and labor of in vivo virus challenge studies, especially when non-human primate (NHP) large animal model testing is needed. Therefore, for the rational development of antiviral therapeutic mAb cocktails it is important to implement approaches to identify combinations of mAbs with optimized molecular interactions in formulated cocktails, along with structural and functional analysis to define features that mediate efficient protection by these mAbs.",

EBOV causes a severe disease in humans with 25% to 90% case fatality rates and significant epidemic potential. The largest epidemic to date occurred in 2013-2016 in West Africa with a total of 28,646 cases of Ebola virus disease (EVD) and 11,323 deaths reported (Coltart et al., 2017) . This and the new ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) (CDC, 2019) highlighted the need to accelerate development of EVD therapeutics (Park et al., 2015; Urbanowicz et al., 2016) . The ebolavirus envelope (E) contains a single surface protein, the glycoprotein (GP), which is the major target for neutralizing mAbs (Lee and Saphire, 2009) . We conducted analysis of >1,800 human mAbs against the GP and identified two classes of broadly reactive mAbs that cooperate for binding to the GP and neutralization of the virus. High-resolution structures illuminated a mechanism of cooperativity. The two-antibody cocktail offered protection in mice against the most antigenically divergent virus SUDV and demonstrated high therapeutic efficacy against live EBOV challenge in NHPs. These findings offered a rational strategy for development of a potent two-antibody cocktail design based on structural features of mAb interactions with ebolavirus GPs.",

Here, we screened >1,800 GP-reactive human mAbs and identified two previously described glycan-cap-specific EBOV-437 and EBOV-442 (Gilchuk et al., 2018) and one additional mAb EBOV-548 (all IgG1 originally) as suitable partners to EBOV-515 or EBOV-520 for the design of cooperative two-antibody cocktail (Figures S1A-E; Table S1 ). Partner candidate mAbs were filtered on the basis of (1) neutralizing activity against wild-type (WT) ebolavirus (EBOV at least); (2) broad reactivity to EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV GPs; (3) cooperative enhancement of EBOV-515 and EBOV-520 binding to the EBOV GP; and (4) capacity to protect against EBOV challenge in mice.",

We expressed the variable gene sequences for this mAb in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells as a recombinant IgG1-LALA Fc mutant molecule (rEBOV-520 LALA, or rEBOV-520) to diminish Fc effector function. rEBOV-520 LALA possessed the highest protective efficacy with low-dose treatment against EBOV in mice and acted principally via neutralization to protect against EBOV . The second cocktail partner, mAb EBOV-548, potently neutralized EBOV and showed the highest activity of three identified cooperative glycan-cap-specific mAbs in a cooperative binding to the GP with rEBOV-520 as a partner mAb. EBOV-548 was produced as a functionally competent IgG1 (designated here as rEBOV-548 IgG1 or rEBOV-548), because engagement of the Fc region might be important for protection by the GP glycan-cap-specific mAbs .",

The SNAP-tag is a self-labeling protein tag that allows specific labeling of a target cell line with fluorescent dye, facilitating detection of effector-cell-mediated killing activity by flow cytometry (Domi et al., 2018) . rEBOV-520 LALA showed low cytotoxic activity when compared with that of the control rEBOV-520 WT IgG1. rEBOV-548 IgG1 mediated efficient cell killing that was comparable to that of a recombinant form of a glycan-cap-directed mAb c13C6, which is included in the ZMapp TM cocktail ( Figure 1A ) (Davidson et al., 2015) . Similar functional profiles of these two mAbs were obtained using bead-or solid-phase-immobilized GP ectodomains and various human effector cells (Figures S1A and S1C).

The glycan-cap-specific rEBOV-548 bound moderately and less efficiently to intact cell-surface-displayed GPs when compared with its binding to recombinant GPs ( Figures 1C and S1B ). Together, these results defined binding and functional features of the cocktail candidate mAbs and showed that the exposure of rEBOV-520 epitope is limited on the intact GPs of all three ebolaviruses. mAbs in the Cocktail Cooperate, Enabling Enhanced GP Binding, Virus Neutralization, and In Vivo Protection Negative stain electron microscopy (EM) analysis showed that rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548 can bind to GPs simultaneously ( Figure 2A ). To characterize the cooperative effects of these two mAbs as a cocktail, we first assessed GP binding for each mAb in the presence or absence of the partner mAb. Fluorescently labeled rEBOV-520 or rEBOV-548 was titrated into a constant concentration of unlabeled partner mAb, as previously described , and relative fluorescence from binding of the labeled mAb to the intact cell-surface-displayed EBOV, BDBV, or SUDV GP was determined. At a constant concentration of 20 mg/mL, rEBOV-548 enhanced binding of rEBOV-520 to the GPs of all three ebolaviruses 2-to 3-fold when compared with binding of rEBOV-520 alone. The cooperativity was mediated by rEBOV-548, because rEBOV-520 had a minor effect on binding of rEBOV-548 to the GP ( Figure 2B ). Cooperative binding of rEBOV-520 to the intact homologous EBOV GP increased steadily with increased concentrations of rEBOV-548 and up to $5-fold higher than rEBOV-520 alone (Figure 2C) , indicating that a higher dose of rEBOV-548 would be necessary to leverage strong cooperative effect in a two-antibody cocktail. Binding of rEBOV-520 to the intact GP in the cocktail did not fully match the strong saturating binding of rEBOV-520 by itself to the proteolytically primed GP CL (Figure 2C) . Therefore, binding of rEBOV-548 only partially enhanced accessibility of the base epitope on the intact GP for recognition by rEBOV-520, compared with the accessibility to the epitope on GP CL . We next assessed whether cooperative binding conferred an enhanced neutralizing activity to the cocktail by using first the most antigenically divergent virus, SUDV. rEBOV-548 itself did not fully neutralize SUDV, and rEBOV-520 neutralized SUDV, but with modest potency ( Figure 1B and S1A). Consistent with the observed increase in cooperative binding of the SUDV GP ( Figure S2A ), rEBOV-548 at a sub-neutralizing concentration potentiated the neutralizing activity of rEBOV-520 against chimeric virus displaying the SUDV GP by reducing the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) value by $3-fold ( Figure 2D ). Neutralization by the cocktail was synergistic, as determined by the Chou and Talalay method that estimates the combination index (CI) to define the effect of drug combination: additive effects (CI = 1), synergism (CI < 1), and antagonism (CI >1) (Chou, 2010) . We also demonstrated synergy in neutralization of the virus with the homologous EBOV GP using the cocktail (a 1:1 mixture of rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548) ( Figures  S2B and S2C ). Together, these data supported our finding for cooperative binding of rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548 to the GP.",

An irrelevant mAb DENV 2D22 (IgG1 isotype) specific to the dengue virus E protein (Fibriansah et al., 2015) was used as a control. All SUDV-challenged mice that were treated with 10 mg/kg of rEBOV-548 mAb alone (which does not neutralize SUDV) on day 1 after infection succumbed to the disease by day 6 after infection, similarly to the animals in the control group. Treatment with rEBOV-520 alone delayed mortality; however, only 10% of animals survived. Treatment with the cocktail (a 1:1 mixture of rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548) conferred higher protection, with 50% of animals surviving and an associated p value = 0.01 (Mantel-Cox test) when compared with the treatment with rEBOV-520 alone ( Figure 2E ). These results showed that rEBOV-548 complemented the activity of rEBOV-520 against SUDV in vivo. It is unknown whether protection in this model can predict protection against SUDV in NHPs.",

We hypothesized that the cocktail of rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548 counteracts the escape more efficiently than individual mAbs do because each mAb possesses independent neutralizing activity (EBOV and BDBV at least) and together they exhibit an enhanced activity. We used high-throughput and quantitative real-time cell analysis assay (RTCA) that measures virus-induced cytopathic effect to screen for escape mutations in the presence of individual mAbs or the cocktail ( Figures S2D and S2E ). Recombinant vesicular stomatitis viruses (rVSVs) displaying the EBOV GP (rVSV/ EBOV GP) or SUDV GP (rVSV/SUDV GP) were incubated in the presence of increasing mAb concentrations, and we assessed neutralization in repeated passages in Vero cell monolayer cultures. Viruses escaping neutralization were assessed for susceptibility to neutralization by individual mAbs or the cocktail, and the genes encoding the GP were sequenced to confirm the presence of an escape mutation. Fifteen consecutive passages identified two rVSV/EBOV GP mutants that escaped neutralization by rEBOV-548 and one rVSV/SUDV GP mutant that escaped neutralization by rEBOV-520. Each of the mutants that we detected was selected in the presence of an individual mAb, and the mutations identified were within the predicted epitope for the respective mAb (Table S2 ). Virus escape was not detected in passages in the presence of the cocktail, as confirmed by neutralization of the late passage (E) Cooperative enhancement of protection against SUDV infection in mice by rEBOV-548. Stat1 \u00c0/\u00c0 mice were inoculated with WT SUDV and treated at 1 dpi with 10 mg/kg rEBOV-520 alone, 10 mg/kg of rEBOV-548 alone, 20 mg/kg rEBOV-520/rEBOV-548 cocktail (1:1 mixture of each mAb), or mAb DENV 2D22 (control). Survival (top), combined clinical scores (middle), and combined body weights (bottom) of surviving mice are shown. Indicated groups were compared using Mantel-Cox test. A ''+'' indicates an animal found dead prior to reaching the pre-determined clinical score. Data are pooled from two to three independent experiments. Mean \u00b1 SD (n = 3) from at least two independent experiments are shown in (B)-(D). See also Figure S2 and Table S2. viruses with individual mAbs rEBOV-520 or rEBOV-548. The rVSV/EBOV GP mutants that escaped neutralization by rEBOV-548 that we isolated were neutralized fully by rEBOV-520 alone and by the cocktail, showing that if one neutralizing mAb loses activity because of a virus variant with an escape mutation, the other neutralizing mAb in the cocktail maintained activity (Table  S2) . These data strongly suggest that the use of this cocktail enhances the effective neutralizing potency of the mAbs and counteracts virus escape of the homologous EBOV. Although escape was not detected with the cocktail, the rEBOV-520 escape mutant we identified for rVSV/SUDV GP (N514Y, a conserved residue for EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV GP) was not fully neutralized by either mAb rEBOV-548 alone or by the cocktail, suggesting the possibility of escape by the heterologous SUDV.",

Mutations T240A, Y261A, R266A, T269A, T270A, I274A, and W275A reduced binding to the GP ( Figure 3B ), and escape mutation L273P reduced neutralizing potency.

The rE-BOV-520 footprint includes relatively conserved regions including the internal fusion loop (IFL) stem of the GP2 subunit and the hydrophobic pocket formed by five residues of the GP1 subunit and termed previously the ''3 10 '' pocket (Zhao et al., 2016; West et al., 2019) . The footprint of rEBOV-520 is distinct from that of the previously described broad human base-specific mAb ADI-15878 (Murin et al., 2018; West et al., 2018) but is similar to the footprint of the potent human-base-specific mAb ADI-15946 ( Figure 3D ), which fully neutralizes EBOV and BDBV but not SUDV (Wec et al., 2017; West et al., 2019) . Both ADI-15946 and rEBOV-520 bound to the 3 10 pocket and IFL stem regions of the fusion loop, unlike human mAb ADI-15878, which binds to the hydrophobic loop end of the structure and bridges to a neighboring GP protomer (King et al., 2019) . However, rEBOV-520 likely gained reactivity against SUDV by having a footprint slightly higher on the GP base than the ADI-15946, or a different angle of approach than that of ADI-15946, which was directed downward toward the viral membrane ( Figure 3C ), in contrast to ADI-15946, which is directed upward from the membrane (West et al., 2019) . This footprint allowed the mAb to avoid contact with the non-conserved EBOV GP residue N506 (R506 in SUDV GP) in the interface with rEBOV-520 ( Figure 3D )-a key contact residue for binding with complementarity determining region 3 of heavy chain (CDRH3) of ADI-15946 (West et al., 2019). Our findings highlighted the variability in epitopes of lead therapeutic candidate mAbs and identified rEBOV-520 as a distinct representative among the class of 3 10 pocket-targeting mAbs with an extended activity against SUDV.",

            "text": "Analysis of the rEBOV-520 Fab-GP CL crystal structure identified 26 GP CL residues in the interface with rEBOV-520 Fab, 16 located in GP1 (amino acid [aa] 70-78, 104, 106, 107, 134, 136, 137, and 139) and ten located in GP2 (aa 510-514, 516, 545-547, and 549). The 18-amino-acid-long CDRH3 interacted with a conformational epitope on the GP1-GP2 interface by making direct contacts with 13 GP1 (aa 70-78, 106, 107, 127, and 139) and 5 GP2 (aa 510-514) residues that are relatively conserved among EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV ( Figure S3A ). rEBOV-520 bound to the 3 10 pocket of the GP CL formed by GP1 residues 70-78 (all contacted with CDRH3) and GP2 residues 510-516 (four of seven contacted with CDRH3) that line the bottom part of the pocket ( Figure 4A ). In the unbound, full-length GP, the 3 10 pocket normally is occupied by the flexible descending b17-b18 loop of the glycan cap (GP1 residues 287-291) that impedes access to the pocket. Like ADI-15946 (West et al., 2019), rEBOV-520 either bound to a conformation of GP in which the b17-b18 loop is displaced, or actively displaced it from the pocket upon binding. The loop is not present in the GP CL , being removed by cleavage. We used hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to compare deuterium labeling of peptides generated after digestion of the GP and GP CL with pepsin. Decrease in labeling of GP 3 10 pocket residues involved in the interface with CDRH3 confirmed limited accessibility of rEBOV-520 epitope in a structure of intact GP trimer ( Figure 4A and S3B). Cleavage removes the glycan cap with the b17-b18 loop and exposes the pocket, which explained enhanced binding of rEBOV-520 to GP CL ( Figure 1C ) and enhanced neutralization potency of this mAb against virions bearing the GP CL compared with intact GP . Previous work suggested that binding of the non-neutralizing macaque mAb FVM09 to the b17-b18 loop itself displaces the loop causing unmasking of the neutralizing epitopes for mAbs 2G4 and ADI-15946 on the GP base (Howell et al., 2017; West et al., 2019) . However, unlike with FVM09, Figure 4 .

Ten residues of the CDRH3 tip are shown in orange cartoon. EBOV GP CL is shown in surface representation with GP1 in cyan and GP2 in yellow. The 3 10 pocket residues involved in the interface with rEBOV-520 CDRH3 and that showed a decrease in hydrogen-deuterium binding to the uncleaved GP as determined by HDX-MS, are mapped onto the surface of GP1 (light red) and GP2 (light yellow).

Rather, alanine substitutions in several residues of the b17-b18 loop, which are distal to the rEBOV-548 epitope in the upper portion of the glycan cap, increased rEBOV-520 binding by $1.6to 3-fold compared with binding to the wild-type GP ( Figure 4B ).

            "text": "Unlike the previously described mAb FVM09, our structure revealed that rEBOV-548 does not bind directly to the b17-b18 loop. Instead, the CDRH3 loop of rEBOV-548 directly interacted with the b17 strand (residues 272-275) of GP1, forming an extended beta sheet with the glycan cap, including highly conserved critical epitope residues I274 and W275 that were defined by loss of binding with alanine substitution and L273, for which mutation to proline resulted in loss of neutralizing activity. rEBOV-548, similarly to EBOV-442, inhibited glycan cap cleavage, which could be the molecular basis for neutralizing activity by these mAbs . Two non-conserved GP1 residues Y261 and R266, whose mutation to alanine decreased binding of rEBOV-548 ( Figure 3B ), did not directly contact the rEBOV-548 paratope and were not within the cleavage site. In the SUDV GP, natural mutations Y261H and R266L affected rEBOV-548 activity in a similar way by lowering the EC 50 for binding and reducing its neutralizing potency (Figures 1B, S1A, and S1B), suggesting destabilization of the epitope by these adjacent mutations. In both rEBOV-548 Fab alone and rEBOV-520 + rEBOV-548 Fab bound states, the b18-b18 0 domain, C-terminal of the GP b17-b18 loop was displaced and structurally mimicked by the CDRH3 loop of rEBOV-548 ( Figures 5B and S4 ). The rE-BOV-548 LC contacted GP1 through hydrophobic interactions at the loop between a1 and b17 (residues 268 and 269) and through Q27 L1 contacting residue D117, making a possible H-bond with the backbone of D117 ( Figure 5C ) that anchors the mAb to the inner chalice of the GP ( Figure 5A ). We observed rEBOV-548-mediated destabilization and dissociation of the GP trimer ( Figure S5A ). Such a dissociation was limited in the presence of the stalk-specific mAb ADI-16061 that was used to stabilize the GP for cryo-EM with rEBOV-548. It is unclear whether this disruption seen with soluble GPs also occurs in membrane-anchored GPs or whether it contributes to the synergy. Analysis of rEBOV-520 interactions in the structure of rEBOV-520 + rEBOV-548 bound to the GP showed that the rEBOV-520 CDRH3 loop makes additional contacts beyond the 3 10 pocket when the glycan cap is intact.

            "text": "Of note, our previous study identified N512 as a key epitope residue for rEBOV-520, given that N512A mutation reduced binding to the GP . Therefore, for efficient binding rEBOV-520 must overcome interference of the b17-b18 loop (at W291 GP1 ) and a1 helix (at P250 GP1 ) contained in the glycan cap structure ( Figure 5E ). When two Fabs of the cocktail bound to the GP, the b18-b18 0 region is displaced and the glycan cap pulled back, along with the b17-b18 loop, to allow efficient binding of rEBOV-520 ( Figure 5F ). However, in a structure where rEBOV-548 bound to the GP alone, the glycan cap was not displaced to the degree it was when rEBOV-520 was bound but rather is reminiscent of the structure of unliganded GP. Although the b18 and b18 0 strands are displaced and replaced by rEBOV-548 CDRH3, the b17-b18 loop is largely intact and bound to the base of the IFL, blocking the 3 10 pocket ( Figure S4 ). Comparing solvent exclusion, the unliganded GP and the GP in a complex with rEBOV-548 alone appeared very similar, except for in the b18-b18 0 domain. Most of the region where the rEBOV-520 CDR3 bound was still excluded and the a1 helix was not displaced ( Figure S5B ), consistent with our observation that rEBOV-548 did not fully potentiate binding of rEBOV-520. These data suggested that in the cocktail, rEBOV-520 alone was largely responsible for complete displacement of the b17-b18 loop as well as displacing the a1 helix in the cocktail, whereas rEBOV-548 acted by displacement of the b18-b18 0 domain and the C-terminal portion of the b17-b18 loop, alleviating structural and kinetic restraints for efficient rEBOV-520 binding ( Figure S6 ). We concluded that structural remodeling is the principal mechanism for the enhanced GP binding and ebolavirus neutralization by the cocktail of two cooperative, naturally occurring human mAbs rEBOV-548 and rEBOV-520 (Figures 5G, 5H, and S6; Video S1).",

Rhesus macaques were assigned to one treatment group of five animals. After intramuscular challenge with a lethal target dose of 1,000 plaque-forming units (PFU) of the Kikwit variant of EBOV, all NHPs of the treatment group received intravenously two 30 mg/kg doses of the cocktail (1:1 mixture of rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548) spaced 3 days apart (days 3 and 6 after infection). An additional animal was studied as a contemporaneous control and was left untreated, along with ten historical untreated controls (7 days post-infection [dpi] median survival, inoculated by the same route with the same stock of virus). The control untreated animal developed a high clinical score and succumbed to the disease on day 6 after infection. The two-dose therapeutic cocktail treatment provided complete protection of NHPs from mortality and clinical signs of EVD ( Figures 7A, 7B , and S7). Before the first treatment (day 3 after infection) three of five NHPs from the treatment-designated group and also the control untreated NHP developed detectable viremia; plasma titers ranged from 6.7 log 10 to 7.3 log 10 genome equivalents (GEQs) per mL, as measured by qRT-PCR ( Figure 7C ). The plasma titer of infectious virus that was assessed by plaque assay on day 3 after infection was below the limit of detection in all animals. However, by day 6 after infection, the viral load in all untreated animals, including in the NHP control from this study and in the historical controls, was as high as >5 log 10 PFU/mL or >11 log 10 GEQ/ mL ( Figures 7C and S7 ). Concordant with full protection, by day 6 after infection all treated NHPs, including three registered as highly viremic on day 3 after infection, no longer had detectable viremia in the plasma. In various tissues harvested from treated animals on day 28 after infection, qRT-PCR analysis, which detects both infectious and non-infectious neutralized particles that have not yet been cleared, revealed virus, confirming active EBOV infection in all NHPs in the treatment group before treatment (Table S5) . We next assessed changes in blood chemistries that are typically associated with EVD to further characterize the efficacy of the mAb cocktail treatment (Table S6 ). The liver enzymes alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT), and alkaline phosphatase (ALP), which are indicators of EVD, were elevated in untreated NHPs on day 6 after infection-the peak of viremia and the disease ( Figures 7B and 7C ). Treated animals did not show signs of acute liver injury on day 6 after infection or later time points, displaying low amounts of ALT, GGT, ALP when compared with those of untreated NHP ( Figure 7D ; Table S6 ). To probe the possibility of selection of escape mutants in the presence of the cocktail, we assessed several peripheral tissues for the presence of live infectious",

MBP134 AF is a two-antibody cocktail with pan-ebolavirus activity that demonstrated efficacy in NHPs (Bornholdt et al., 2019) . REGN-EB3 is a three-antibody cocktail (Pascal et al., 2018) , and mAb114 is a single mAb that is specific to the receptor binding site of the GP (Corti et al., 2016a )-both are monospecific to EBOV. REGN-EB3 and mAb114 were recently assessed in the field in the DRC outbreak of human EVD, and early treatment was associated with reduction of the mortality rate to 6% with REGN-EB3 or to 11% with mAb114 (Nature News, 2019). mAb114 is the only EBOV antibody described that has been shown so far to protect NHPs in monotherapy settings. Even so, the protection mediated by the cocktail of mAb114 + mAb100 was better than that mediated by mAb114 alone (Corti et al., 2016a) . In the cocktail, there is also the potential benefit of avoiding the high risk of virus escape that is inherent in monotherapy approaches. Targeting cross-reactive epitopes might be another approach to reduce the viral escape, given that conserved regions are more likely to be critical for the virus function. Therefore, having a single broad cocktail that is at least as effective as the existing monospecific cock-tail against EBOV would be practical. The cocktail of rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548 was formulated to add a principle of cooperativity (e.g., incorporation of a pair of non-competing and potently neutralizing mAbs that together exhibit an enhanced activity). Therefore, in addition to the reactivity breadth that extended to BDBV and SUDV, the cocktail of rE-BOV-520 and rEBOV-548 incorporated four principal activities against homologous EBOV: the independent neutralizing activities of (1) rEBOV-520 and (2) rEBOV-548, (3) an enhanced combined activity because of synergy in the cocktail, and (4) Fc-mediated effector function by rEBOV-548. A comparison to the historical NHPs studies with REGN-EB3, mAb114, and MBP134 AF qualifies the cocktail of EBOV-520 and EBOV-548 as highly protective against EBOV. The next studies should determine whether this cocktail protects NHPs against heterologous ebolaviruses.",

Several studies identified the IFL as a site of vulnerability for potent mAbs that can act solely by neutralization to protect Wec et al., 2017) . MAbs recognizing glycan cap epitopes have been considered as inferior for therapeutic development because of possible cross-reactivity with soluble GPs (sGPs) (Mohan et al., 2012) . Recent studies, however, suggested an indispensable role for Fc-mediated effector functions in the protection against EBOV by glycancap-specific mAbs . It was unknown whether these functions (e.g., neutralizing activity and Fc engagement) in the cocktail of these two mAb specificities were essential and sufficient for efficacy in NHPs. Our study suggested that both functions could be important for virus control and EVD prevention by showing that the cocktail of the Fc-function-competent IgG1 form of glycan-cap-specific rEBOV-548 and functionally impaired IgG1-LALA form of neutralizing IFL-specific rEBOV-520 mediated therapeutic protection in NHPs.",

Therefore, this work defines cooperative interactions between mAbs of the two major epitope specificities for GP recognition, and unveils cooperative binding of the GP as a mechanism for the enhanced ebolavirus neutralization and protection.

            "text": "Screening strategy to identify partner mAbs for therapeutic cocktail Our previous work used Jurkat cell surface displayed EBOV GP to assess competition-binding groups of the GP reactive mAbs that isolated from human survivor of EVD outbreak in the DRC . This study revealed that binding of two broadly-reactive glycan cap specific mAbs increases binding of broadly-neutralizing and highly protective base-specific mAbs EBOV-515 and EBOV-520 . Here, for the development of cooperative mAb cocktail, we performed a comprehensive screening from $1,800 individual GP-reactive B cell line supernatants ($1,100 from this study and $750 from previous study with the DRC outbreak survivor) to identify a suitable partner mAb for these potent base-specific mAb. The criteria for down-selection of the partner mAb candidates included (a) high neutralizing activity against live pathogenic virus (neutralizing at least EBOV); (b) broad reactivity to EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV GP; (c) synergistic activity that was defined as the ability of mAb to enhance binding of EBOV-515 and EBOV-520 (at least 2-fold enhancement) when compared to binding of the base-specific mAb alone; and (d) efficacy of monotherapy in mice to protect against live EBOV challenge. Supernatants from each well of the 384-well culture plates with expanded hybridoma lines first were assessed for neutralizing activity against live EBOV using one 1:5 supernatant dilution in 96-well plate format as detailed below in the Neutralization assays section. Next, hybridoma lines that fully neutralized EBOV at the supernatant dilution tested were assessed by ELISA for reactivity against recombinant EBOV, BDBV, and SUDV GP. The broadly-reactive clones identified were tested for neutralizing activity against live BDBV and SUDV. Hybridoma cell lines producing cross-reactive and neutralizing mAbs (mAbs that reacted to all three GPs and neutralized at least EBOV and BDBV) were cloned biologically by single-cell fluorescence-activated cell sorting. Hybridomas were expanded in Medium E (STEMCELL Technologies) until 50% confluent in 75-cm 2 flasks (Corning). Purified mAbs were tested using a competition-binding assay with intact Jurkat-EBOV GP (A) or thermolysin cleaved Jurkat-EBOV GP CL to identify major antigenic sites. Identified mAbs that (a) competed with the reference glycan cap specific mAbs c13C16 (Davidson et al., 2015) or BDBV289 (Flyak et al., 2916) on intact GP, and (b) recognized intact but not cleaved GP, were assessed for cooperative binding to Jurkat cell surface displayed EBOV GP in the presence of the GP base-specific mAbs EBOV-515 or EBOV-520 (described below). This screening approach resulted in identification of broadly-reactive glycan cap region-specific mAbs EBOV-437, EBOV-442, and EBOV-548. Antibodies EBOV-442 and EBOV-548 potently neutralized EBOV and BDBV and offered partial protection (80 to 40% survival) in vivo in mice lethally challenged with live EBOV. mAb EBOV-548 showed the highest cooperativity with EBOV-515 and EBOV-520; based on this feature it was selected for further testing in the cocktail with EBOV-520.",

Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit (QIAGEN). A modified 5 0 RACE (Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends) approach was used (Turchaninova et al., 2016) . Briefly, 5 mL total RNA was mixed with cDNA synthesis primer mix (10 mM each) and incubated for 2 min at 70 C and then decrease the incubation temperature to 42 C to anneal the synthesis primers (1-3 min). After incubation, a mixture containing 5X first-strand buffer (Clontech), DTT (20 mM), 5 0 template switch oligo (10 mM), dNTP solution (10 mM each) and 10X SMARTScribe Reverse Transcriptase (Clontech) was added to the primer-annealed total RNA reaction and incubated for 60 min at 42 C. The first-strand synthesis reaction was purified using the Ampure Size Select Magnetic Bead Kit at a ratio of 1.8X (Beckman Coulter). Following, a single PCR amplification reaction containing 5 mL first-strand cDNA, 2X Q5 High Fidelity Mastermix (NEB), dNTP (10 mM each), forward universal primer (10 mM) and reverse primer mix (0.2 mM each in heavy-chain mix, 0.2 mM each in light-chain mix) were subjected to thermal cycling with the following conditions: initial denaturation for 1 min 30 s followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 98 C for 10 s, annealing at 60 C for 20 s, and extension at 72 C for 40 s, followed by a final extension step at 72 C for 4 min. All primer sequences used in this protocol were previously described (Turchaninova et al., 2016) . The first PCR reaction was purified using the Ampure Size Select Magnetic Bead Kit at a ratio of 0.6X (Beckman Coulter). Amplicon libraries were then prepared according to the Pacific Biosciences Multiplex SMRT Sequencing protocol and sequenced on a Pacific Biosciences Sequel platform. Raw sequencing data was demultiplexed and circular consensus sequences (CCS) were determined using the Pacific Biosciences SMRT Analysis tool suite.

Mixtures were applied on Vero-E6 cell monolayer cultures in 96-well plates and incubated for four days at 37 C. In the absence of mAb neutralizing activity, the infection resulted in uniform eGFP fluorescence from the monolayer of cells that was readily detected by fluorescence microscopy. Fluorescence was measured using Synergy HT microplate reader (BioTek).",

Fifty (50) mL of cell culture medium (DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS) was added to each well of a 96-well E-plate to obtain background reading. Eighteen thousand (18,000) Vero-E6 cells in 50 mL of cell culture medium were seeded per each well and plate was placed on the analyzer. Measurements were taken automatically every 15 min and the sensograms were visualized using RTCA software version 2.1.0 (ACEA Biosciences Inc). For the first passage, rVSV/ EBOV GP or rVSV/SUDV GP viruses (0.3 MOI, $6,000 PFU per well) were mixed with eight two-fold dilutions of individual mAbs or the cocktail of rEBOV-520/rEBOV-548 (1:1 mAbs ratio) starting at 25 mg/mL in a total volume of 100 mL and incubated for 1 h at 37 C. At 12 h after seeding the cells, the virus/mAb mixtures were added in 2 to 7 replicates to the cells in 96-well E-plates. Wells containing virus only in the absence of mAb and wells containing only Vero cells in medium were included on each plate as controls. Plates were measured continuously (every 15 min) for over 48 h to assess virus neutralization. Ten (10) mL aliquots from the wells with viruses that replicated at the highest mAb concentrations ($500-6,000 PFU) were used for the repeated passage for total 15 passages with rVSV/EBOV GP and 5 passages with rVSV/SUDV GP. The escape mutants were identified by CPE in wells containing typically neutralizing concentrations of mAbs. To verify the escape mutation, isolated viruses were tested with 100 mg/mL of each individual mAb and the cocktail using RTCA neutralization assay, and then sequenced. Controls included viruses from the late passages that did not escape neutralization in the presence of the cocktail, and viruses incubated in a presence of control mAb DENV 2D22.

Briefly, a target cell line was made by transfecting 293F cells with a full-length DNA expressing GP from the EBOV-Kikwit isolate followed by transfecting with two separate DNA constructs expressing eGFP and the chimeric CCR5-SNAP tag protein. The new cell line, designated EBOV GPkik-293FS eGFP CCR5-SNAP, expresses EBOV-Kikwit GP on the plasma membrane, eGFP in the cytoplasm and the SNAP-tag CCR5, which can be specifically labeled with SNAP-Surface AF647 (NEB), on the cell surface (Domi et al., 2018) . A recombinant form of a human anti-EBOV GP mAb KZ52 (a neutralizing antibody) (IBT Bioservices) was used as a positive control and the unrelated human mAb DENV 2D22 as a negative control. The ADCC activity was quantified by incubating three-fold serial dilutions of mAbs with EBOV GPkik-293FS eGFP CCR5-SNAP target cells for 15 min at ambient temperature and then adding human PBMC as effector cells for 2 h at 37 C, after which cells were washed once with PBS, fixed with 2% PFA, stained and analyzed with an LSRII Fortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences). Data analysis was performed with FlowJo software (Tree Star Inc.). The percentage cytotoxicity of the mAb was determined as the number of target cells losing eGFP signal (by virtue of ADCC) but retaining the surface expression of CCR5-SNAP. glycans were then added and trimmed to fit EM density using the model with the best statistics, followed by manual adjustment in Coot (Emsley et al., 2010) followed by a final round of refinement in Rosetta, including glycans and restraining backbone coordinates. For the EBOV GP DMucDTM (Makona) complex with rEBOV-548 alone, an additional refinement in Phenix was performed to idealize geometry. Glycans were validated using PDB-care (L\u20ac utteke and von der Lieth, 2004) and Privateer (Agirre et al., 2015) . All model figures were generated using UCSF Chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004) . To estimate change in GP solvent exclusion upon Fabs binding, GP1,2 from an unliganded GP structure (PDB: 5JQ3), and GP1,2 bound to the respective Fabs were used to create a surface map in UCSF chimera (Pettersen et al., 2004) and then normalized to Gly-X-Gly tripeptides (Bendell et al., 2014) to determine a normalized solvent excluded surface (SES).",

A tight mask was generated around the GP core and rEBOV-548 Fabs and an additional round of classification was performed with tighter angular sampling. This procedure revealed several substates of the complex, with portions of the glycan cap in different positions in each protomer position. A single class with 13,144 particles was selected based off of estimated resolution and due to the appearance of C3 symmetry, indicating that all three of the glycan cap protomers were in the same position in this class. Particles from this class were re-extracted and 3D-refinement was performed using a tight mask that just contained the Fv domains of rEBOV-520 and rEBOV-548 as well as the GP core and C3 symmetry was applied. Local resolution estimation and angular sampling was also performed using RELION 3.0. For the EBOV GP DMucDTM\u00c0rEBOV-548 complex, all processing was performed exclusively in Cryosparc2. An ab initio initial model was generated first and then used to back-project a cleaned stack using C3 symmetry and non-uniform refinement with an experimentally generated mask around the entire GP core and rEBOV-548 Fabs.
