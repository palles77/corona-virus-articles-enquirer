In practice, there are restrictions associated with limited vaccination coverage and the maximum daily vaccine administration. We extend previous work on optimal control for influenza to reflect these realistic restrictions using mixed constraints on state and control variables. An optimal control problem is formulated with the aim of minimizing the number of infected individuals while considering intervention costs. Time-dependent vaccination is computed and analysed using a model incorporating heterogeneity in population structure under different settings of transmissibility levels, vaccine coverages, and time delays.",

In developing a response plan to minimize socio-economic losses in disease outbreak, it is important to predict the transmission dynamics of an infectious disease, to compare the effects of different control strategies, and to design the best strategy. The World Health Organization(WHO) issued warning of pandemic influenza and encouraged to prepare countermeasures in 1999, but it did not draw much attention until the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome(SARS) in 2002-2003. Since the first SARS case was reported from Canton, China on December 2002, more than 31 countries worldwide reported 7956 confirmed cases including 666 fatal cases to the WHO by the end of 21 May, 2003. The SARS aroused great interest in the use of mathematical models to predict the course of the epidemic and to evaluate various management strategies [1] . This interest triggered studies for investigating the dynamics and control of infectious diseases and has been reinforced by the treatment of a pandemic including the influenza A(H1N1) 2009 [2] .",

The optimization of vaccination policies before their implementation is essential to better allocate resources and to minimize disease burdens. Recent advances have been made in optimizing vaccine distribution policies in specific settings [3] [4] [5] . Several studies have applied optimal control techniques to determine immunization strategies [6, 7] . However, it is still complicated and controversial to address the best possible strategies because the dynamics of epidemics and the optimal use of vaccines depend on various factors including the structure of the population, vaccine availability, and transmissibility levels. In this context, we take into account of the size and heterogeneous dynamics of groups, different transmission levels, the total and daily maximum amount of vaccines available, and time delays in vaccine implementation. In this paper, we seek optimal time-dependent vaccination strategies within the vaccine availability. We begin by introducing a deterministic, compartmental model of influenza transmission incorporating the structure of the population with different dynamics. We then present the formulation of the optimal control problem to minimize the incidence while satisfying the constraints of the total and daily maximum amount of vaccines available. We use the penalty method to approximate this constrained optimization problem and derive an optimality system that characterizes the optimal control. Finally, we present the results of numerical simulations under various settings and conclude with a summary.",

This system is a two-point boundary value problem, where the state system with the initial conditions (2.8) and the adjoint system with the terminal conditions (2.9) are coupled. Among many practical approaches to solve the coupled optimality system, we use a gradient-based algorithm to uncouple the system [5] . In the numerical simulations, we compare the optimal intervention strategies under different settings of the population structures, transmissibility levels, vaccine coverages, and delays in vaccine production. The values of model parameters were obtained by the best available local data and literature reviews of previous studies [8, 14] . Table 1 provides a summary of the definitions and values of the parameters. The default values for parameters in addition to those listed in Table 1 are vaccination coverage, maximum daily vaccination, and the basic reproduction number. In general, vaccination coverage for a pandemic influenza is far lower than full, for example, the US or Canada held 30%-40% coverage for 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza [15, 16] . The daily rate of vaccine administration has been estimated to be below 2% of the total population [16, 17] . Therefore, we varied vaccination coverage in the range of 10%-50% and maximum daily administration of less than 2% of the total population. The basic reproduction number R 0 , which associated with transmissibility level, ranges from 1.4 to 2.4.",

We assume a 50% vaccination coverage, a 1.5% maximum daily administration of the total population and R 0 = 1.9. First, we consider two subgroups of the fixed ratio 3:7 of sizes where the former subgroup has a higher contact than the latter. The mixing rates are varied by using different frequencies of contacts a ij between jth and ith subgroups. Fig. 2A2-C2 . Under the optimal vaccination, control efforts are gradually decreasing in time. Vaccination is highly concentrated in the early stage of epidemic for early possible strategy and the vaccinated proportion stays constant over the time for uniform distribution. A larger fraction is vaccinated in the higher contact group compared to the lower contact group under the optimal strategy. In contrast, the number of individuals vaccinated in each subgroup is proportional to the size of subgroup for both early possible and uniform strategy, or the proportion vaccinated in each subgroup is kept the same. This is because neither of them reflects the heterogeneous mixing rates to determine the vaccination schedule. Fig. 2A3 -C3 demonstrate that the implementation of control measures yields substantial reductions in the peak size of infections while generating shifted, longer pandemic durations. The reduction of cumulative number of infectives relative to the case without intervention are approximately 68.2%, 59%, 45.5% under optimal, early possible, and uniform distribution, respectively (Fig. 2A4-C4 ). This result proposes that control measures may be optimally targeted to minimize the number of cases for a given control effort.",

As a result, for a 11 = 10, infectives are significantly reduced by 80.1% compared to early possible vaccination by 51.3% and uniform distribution by 31.8% (Fig. 3C4) .

It is obvious that the proportion of vaccinated individuals for each subgroup corresponds to contact frequencies when the subgroups are equal in population sizes ( Fig. 4A1-A4 ). However, a switch in the main targeted group occurs as the gap of contact rates between two subgroups diminishes ( Fig. 4B1-B4 ). Similar behaviour is observed with different ratios of the subgroup population sizes. Optimal targeting strategy is investigated in terms of cumulative proportion of vaccinated in each group under different ratios of populations sizes. The ratio of the vaccinated proportion in the higher contact group relative to the lower contact group as a function of population sizes and contact frequencies is illustrated in Fig. 5(A) . For all cases of subgroup population sizes, the main targeted vaccinated group is the higher contact group when the gap of contacts between two groups is large enough. As the gap decreases, the targeted group is switched to the one with more population and the bigger the difference in sizes of two groups, the earlier the turning point comes. This threshold behaviour is shown in Fig. 5(B) .",

Fig. 6A1 -C1 display the time series of vaccinated proportion for each subgroup. Vaccination must be implemented in a shorter period of time, for higher level of transmission because large R 0 results in earlier epidemic peaks due to rapid spread of the disease. It is also observed that high R 0 requires optimal control that manages to reduce the infectives in the group with big population since large R 0 quickly depletes the susceptible population. Incidence curves of infected proportions are shown in Fig. 6A2-C2 and higher values of R 0 generate earlier epidemic peaks with higher and narrower in shape.

It is of great interest to seek the best strategies to better allocate limited resources and minimize disease burdens. In the optimal control problem, vaccination coverage and maximum daily vaccination are expressed as mixed constraints on control and state to reflect realistic restrictions. We study the effects of optimal vaccination To evaluate the impact of constraints on the availability of vaccine supplies, we vary vaccination coverage from 50% to 10% of the population, fixing maximum daily vaccination as 1.5% when R 0 = 1.9. Time schedules of vaccinated proportion under three different vaccination coverage are monotonically decreasing in time with different slopes in Fig. 7A1-C1 . Cumulative vaccinated proportion in each subgroup is shown in Fig. 8(A) , which demonstrates that targeting strategy remains similar with changes in vaccination coverage. As vaccination coverage decreases, number of vaccinated decreases, resulting in an increase in the overall number of infected (Fig. 7A2-C2) . Optimal control is more efficient than other strategies in terms of reduction under all vaccination coverage (Fig. 7A3-C3) . A significant difference is observed in the reduction of number of infected under different vaccination coverage and this result underscores the importance to secure sufficient vaccine supplies (Fig. 8(B) ).",

This relation is illustrated in Figs. 9 and 10 under three different values of R 0 . Fig. 9 displays cumulative number of vaccinated as maximum daily vaccination varies from 0.25% to 1.5% with 50% vaccination coverage. The total number of vaccinated increases as daily maximum increases to 1% and 1% is enough to use 50% coverage in total. We also analyse the threshold For instance, in Fig. 10 R 0 = 1.9, the reduction of infectives increases as daily maximum increases to 1% for vaccination coverage of 50%. However, further increase in maximum daily vaccination does not result in more reduction of infected individuals. Our results indicate that maximum daily vaccination affects the optimal control or the dynamics of influenza only in a certain range which depends on vaccination coverage and R 0 .",

            "text": "In the previous simulations, we found that sufficient vaccination should be implemented in the early phases to effectively control an epidemic. In practice, however, the timing of vaccine delivery or availability may be much later than the onset of the pandemic. For the pandemic A(H1N1) 2009 outbreak, the influenza began spreading in April 2009 and vaccination started in October 2009. Therefore, we incorporated the time delay by varying the start of vaccination, 30, 60, and 90 days after the pandemic onset. We investigate the influence of the timing of the vaccination on optimal strategy and vaccination coverage. Fig. 11 displays the vaccinated proportions of subgroups at high and low contact, corresponding incidence curves of infected, and the reduction in the cumulative number of infected individuals relative to the ones in the absence of interventions. As the time delay increases, more intensive vaccination must be implemented in a shorter period of time as shown in Fig. 11A1 -D1. The group with higher contact remains as the main target of optimal vaccine allocation for most delay cases. However, a longer period of time delay leads to the switch in the vaccinated proportion (Fig. 11D1 ). This is because peak occurs earlier in higher contact group than lower contact group and vaccination has little effect after the peak. Delay of vaccination yields significant increases in the number of infected individuals and decreases in the percent reductions ( Fig. 11A2-D2 A3-D3) . While general performance of optimal strategy is superior to others, the difference becomes insignificant for a longer period of time delay (Fig. 11A3-D3) . Fig. 12 presents the cumulative number of vaccinated of each group under three different vaccination coverages and the impact of optimal vaccinations in terms of reductions of infected. As vaccination coverage increases, the number of infected individuals decreases, resulting in an increase in the reductions of infected. However, with long time delay and large vaccination coverage, the whole coverage is not distributed due to the lack of implementation period. For instance, if vaccination starts 60 days after the beginning of the transmission, only 39% coverage is allocated when 50% vaccination coverage is allowed. Not surprisingly, 50% coverage and 25% coverage lead to the same results in cumulative number of vaccinated and the reductions of infectives with 90 days of delay. The optimal vaccination coverage as a function of time delay is presented in Fig. 13 . ",

Thus, it is great interest to develop an efficient time schedule and prioritization of limited vaccine supplies. This study uses a mathematical model of the transmission dynamics of pandemic influenza and employs techniques from control theory to derive optimal intervention strategies. Time-dependent vaccination is computed and analysed using a model incorporating heterogeneity in population structure under different settings of transmissibility levels, vaccine coverages, and time delays in the implementation of vaccination. Vaccination coverage and the maximum daily vaccination rate are critical factors in developing response plans for disease outbreaks. These are parameters with limited values and associate with weight constants and a control upper bound in optimal control formulation of previous studies. In our mathematical framework, mixed constrained optimization problem is considered to reflect realistic restrictions.",

Our analysis confirms that more intensive control measures must be implemented in the early stage on the group with higher contact, in general. However, the targeted group is switched to the one with more population, as the gap of contact rates between two groups diminishes, which suggests that prioritization strategy should be tailored. Higher values of R 0 requires rapid implementation of optimal control policies with more concern on the group with big population. While the reduction of infected significantly decreases as the vaccination coverage decreases, prioritization schemes on subgroups remain similar with changes in total number of vaccine doses available. Finally, the benefit of vaccination is significantly reduced as the time of the start of vaccination from pandemic onset is delayed.",

Then so are R and z, since the changes in these variables are nonnegative. To establish the upper bounds for the solutions, we consider an equation for the total population size N.

Due to this property, there exists a solution for (2.8) for a zero constant control, which guarantees an admissible pair (x(t), u(t)). Conditions 1 and 4 hold vacuously as the control setWe note that U is convex, f is expressed as a linear function of the control variable with coefficients dependent on the state variables and time in (A.7), and F and g are convex on U. Then N(x, t) is convex, which is Condition 2. To show this, letThus,\u03c1 \u2208 N, which shows that N is convex.
