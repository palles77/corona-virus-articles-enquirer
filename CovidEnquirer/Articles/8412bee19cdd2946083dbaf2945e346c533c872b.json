            "text": "Respiratory viral infections (RVI) are important in hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (HSCT) and knowledge regarding incidence, morbidity, mortality, and long-term pulmonary complications is limited. We report a study to evaluate incidence and outcomes, both short and long-term, of RVI in children receiving HSCT. Between January 2000 and December 2012, 844 patients underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) at the Hospital for Sick Children: 491 were allogeneic and 353 were autologous. When screening for causes of death in the first year after HSCT in the 844 patients, we found that RVI as a cause of death was only evident in the first 100 days after HSCT. Fifty-four (6.5%) patients were found to have an RVI within the first 100 days after HSCT (allogeneic \u00bc 32, autologous \u00bc 22). Upper and lower respiratory tract infections were documented in 31 (57%) and 23 (43%) patients, respectively. Viruses were parainfluenza (35%), respiratory syncytial virus (28%), influenza (22%), adenovirus (7%), human metapneumovirus (4%), coronavirus (2%), and rhinovirus (2%). Three patients relapsed with their primary disease before day 100 and were excluded. The overall mortality for the remaining 51 patients was 10% (allogeneic \u00bc 4, autologous \u00bc 1). All 5 deaths were directly attributable to RVI and all 5 deaths occurred in patients with a lower respiratory tract infection. The remaining patients were followed for a median of 4.3 years (range, 1.4 to 11.8) and no chronic pulmonary complications were observed. A clear seasonal pattern for contracting RVI was evident with 65% of total RVI occurring between October and March (35 of 427 versus 19 of 417, P \u00bc .03). Given the significant mortality from RVI and the challenges in preventing them, choosing the time to start HSCT, whenever possible, may help prevent RVI and improve outcomes.",

In recent years, the growing number of HSCT utilizing alternative donors and cord progenitor stem cells, along with the common use of serotherapy, has contributed to a significant increase in viral infections after HSCT [5, 6] . Some well-known viruses, such herpes simplex virus (HSV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV), were major causes of morbidity and mortality in HSCT [7, 8] . However, since prophylactic or preemptive anti-HSV/CMV therapy became standard practice, morbidity and mortality from HSV or CMV disease are rare [9, 10] . Nonetheless, respiratory viruses such as influenza, parainfluenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients after HSCT and there is increased awareness for the diagnosis of these infections. However, no prophylactic approach for such viruses exists in HSCT recipients. Hence, this study's aim was to investigate the incidence and risk factors of RVI in children after HSCT and describe the short-and long-term outcomes of these patients.",

TRM was defined as being either due to an RVI or other transplantation toxicities. Death due to RVI was defined as death from respiratory failure with no other cause of the pneumonia. Long-term pulmonary complication was defined as any limitation of pulmonary status, including pulmonary function tests. Relapse was defined by the finding of hematologic or cytogenetic recurrence or by the initiation of therapy for recurrence. Progressive disease was defined as tumor growth of more than 20% or spreading since undergoing transplantation [11] .",

Growth factors were given as indicated, and laminar air flow rooms were used from day 0 until engraftment. Intravenous immunoglobulin at a dose of .5 g/kg was supplemented if the IgG level was less than 400 mg/dL. The IgG level was routinely monitored every week in all patients. Pneumocystis jiroveci prophylaxis was given before HSCT and after HSCT for at least 6 months. Pneumococcal prophylaxis with penicillin continued for at least 1 year or until the administration of pneumococcal vaccine. Blood products were transfused to maintain hemoglobin concentration > 70 mg/L and platelet counts of 20,000/mm 3 .

As these 54 patients were the focus of the study, their diagnosis and conditioning regimen including use of serotherapy are described in Table 1 . Only 1 patient with diagnosis of severe combined immune deficiency (SCID)/Omenn's syndrome received conditioning with busulfan and cyclophosphamide. The remaining 5 SCID patients did not receive any conditioning regimen.

            "text": "Respiratory-related mortality from parainfluenza virus in this study is lower, 10.5%, than in other studies, which showed approximately 30% to 70%. This could be explained by very early years when transplantations were completed and the mainly adult study population in previous reports [26] [27] [28] [29] . A large retrospective cohort study from Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center described unrelated transplantation as the major risk factor for parainfluenza virus acquisition as well the use of high-dose corticosteroids [29] . For our 2 patients who died from parainfluenza virus pneumonia, 1 with diagnosis of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome received methylprednisolone as GVHD prophylaxis for an unrelated cord blood transplantation. However, another patient with relapsed acute myeloid leukemia did not develop GVHD or receive any corticosteroids treatment. Aerosolized ribavirin was given to the first patient but it was given later during the course of pneumonia. The benefit of using aerosolized ribavirin in the treatment of parainfluenza pneumonia among HSCT recipients is controversial [26, 28] . The early diagnosis of parainfluenza infection could expedite ribavirin treatment initiation and improve the outcome [25] . The incidence of RSV infection in this study was 28% and LRTI composed more than one half of all RSV infections. Interestingly, the mortality is only 6.7%, which is lower than 20% to 40% in other studies in HSCT recipients [1] . Treatment with aerosolized ribavirin in 6 of 7 patients with RSV LRTI may potentially be the reason for lowered mortality, although 1 fatal case was observed after the patient received ribavirin. HSCT recipients have high potential for progression from URTI to severe LRTI without well-defined and specific risk factors for death [4, 30, 31] . A pooled analysis by Shah and Chemaly suggested that ribavirin treatment with/without RSV-specific immunoglobulin or palivizumab had lower rates of mortality by almost one-third in a review of 21 separate studies [32] . Another small retrospective analysis of palivizumab given for RSV URTI did not show protective effect of progression to LRTI [33] [34] [35] .",

High mortality between 15% and 70% has been reported in HSCT recipients with influenza infection, but recent data showed an improvement with the availability of neuraminidase inhibitors [36, 37] . An inactivated vaccine is the only prophylactic approach for influenza infection, but it appears to be less effective in HSCT recipients, particularly in the first few months after transplantation, as well as in patients who required immunosuppressive agents for GVHD treatment [38] [39] [40] [41] . However, the influenza vaccine is considered to be safe as no major local or general adverse effects were reported after use in transplant recipients [42] . hMPV infection has been reported with an incidence of 3% to 9% in adult HSCT recipients and patients with hematologic malignancies. hMPV may be associated with severe pneumonia and fatal lower -respiratory tract disease in HSCT recipients [43] . Even though hMPV infections are documented in asymptomatic cases [44] , further analysis of a larger number of patients is necessary to identify its real impact in after transplantation population. For human rhinovirus and coronavirus, despite the high incidence of infections among HSCT recipients, morbidity and mortality are both relatively low. Asymptomatic detections are common, accounting for 13% and 41% of patients with rhinovirus and coronavirus, respectively [45] .",

In Canada, the high season for respiratory viral infections span between October and March and in our study, 35 patients (65%) contracted RVI during the high season, compared with 19 patients (35%) in the remaining months.
