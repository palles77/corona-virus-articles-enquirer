Bats provide a rich \"gene pool\" for interspecies exchange of genetic fragments of coronaviruses, which were established as mixing vessels of different coronaviruses [5] . Although humans and bats live in different environments, some wildlife species are susceptible to the novel coronaviruses in nature, highlighting that the need of tracing its origin of 2019 human coronavirus in wild animals. Previously, researchers had demonstrated that coronaviruses had been detected in pangolins [6] . Here, we explore the phylogenic relationship of the human SARS-CoV-2 together with pangolin-and bat-origin coronaviruses. The similarity analysis of SARS-CoV-2 and the animal-origin coronaviruses demonstrated that recombination events were likely to occur in bat and pangolin coronaviruses (Supplementary Figure S1) Figure 2 ). However, it is notably that 1b gene sequence identity of pangolin/1 coronaviruses were greater that bat-origin RaTG13 coronavirus, with the highest being 99.3%.",

Interestingly, the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 was more similar to that of the bat/RaTG13 strain and Pangolin/1 coronavirus. Although the S amino acid identities of pangolin-origin coronavirus exhibited lower amino acid identities with bat/RaTG13, it was noteworthy that six amino acids associated with the receptor binding preference of human receptor angiotensin converting enzyme II-464L, 495F, 502Q, 503S, 510N, and 514Y (SARS-CoV-2 numbering)-in the pangolin/1 coronavirus were the same as that of SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 2 ), but were distinct from that of the bat-origin coronaviruses.

The phylogenic tree of full-genome of betacoronaviruses could be classified into four clades, including clade 1, clade 2, clade 3, and clade 4 (Figure 1). The two bat-origin SARS-like strains (bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21) formed clade 1, and pangolin-derived Pangolin/1, BetaCoV/ Pangolin/Guangxi/P2V/2017 (Pangolin/P2V), and BetaCoV/Pangolin/Guangxi/P4L/2020 (Pangolin/P4L) coronaviruses formed newly independent clade 2 and clade 3, which was notable for the long branch separating the bat/RaTG13 strain and SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 1). Of note, we found that the full genome and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase genome (RdRp) of Pangolin/1 coronavirus were genetically closely related to the bat/RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 strains (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S3). However, in the phylogenic tree of S gene, the Pangolin/P2V and Pangolin/P4L coronaviruses were more closely related to that of the bat/RaTG13 and SARS-CoV-2 strains (Supplementary Figure S2), indicative of the continuous evolution of pangolin-derived coronaviruses in different regions. There was clearly a genetic gap between SARS-CoV-2 and the nearest batand pangolin-origin coronaviruses, and the phylogenic relationship of pangolin-origin coronaviruses were far from that of bat/RaTG13 (Figure 1). Given the use of pangolins use in traditional medicine and for food, what kind of role do the pangolins play in the cross-species evolution and transmission of the novel coronavirus? Further details are needed to be sought in the future.Frequent human-animal interface had been recognized the major cause for viral cross-species transmission. It is speculated that the coronaviruses circulating in pangolin, bat, and other animal species are likely perceived to be a \"gene pool\" for the generation of new recombinants (Figure 1). During the long-time of co-existence of coronaviruses and their hosts, different viruses recombine with each other in multiple animal hosts to generate new recombinants, with some of them adapting to the new hosts such as humans. However, what animal species are the intermediate hosts in the transmission cascade of SARS-CoV-2. In response to such pressing question, further surveillance in natural environment of China and the rest of countries are needed to be sought to understand the emergence and potential transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",
