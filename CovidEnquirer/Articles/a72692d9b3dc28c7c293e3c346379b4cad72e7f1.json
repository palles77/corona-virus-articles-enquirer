Therefore, an experimental model was established to study the influence of elevated concentrations of circulating cortisol on the immune capacity in swine. Three experimental groups, with six pigs in each, were immunized twice, 4 weeks apart, with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae antigen. Endogenous production of cortisol was induced by intramuscular injection of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) twice daily. One group received ACTH during the week before and after the second immunization, one group during the week after the second immunization only, while one group served as untreated controls.",

The ability of blood leukocytes to produce interferon-a (1FN-a) at exposure in vitro to fixcd pseudorabics virus adsorbed to porcine kidney cells increased in all animals shortly after the second immunization with M. hyopneumoniae. The influence of cortisol on the IFN-a-producing capacity was dependent on whether the test was carried out in whole blood cultures or in cultures with purified PBMC.

            "text": "The most extensively studied mediators of stress-induced immunosuppression are the glucocorticoids (for overview, see Cohen, 1992) . The effects of elevated concentrations ofcortisol are evident in vivo as neutrophilia and lymphopenia, a result of redistribution of leukocytes. In the mouse, apoptosis of immature thymocytes also contributes to the lymphopenia (Ucker, 1987) . The function of immunocompetent cells under the influence of corticosteroids has been studied mainly in vitro, either by addition of the steroid to cell cultures or by assessing reactivities of mononuclear cells purified from the blood of individuals treated with corticosteroids. Depending on method, contradictory results are obtained for some functional tests such as the in vitro production of antibodies, reviewed by Dupont (1988) . There is, however, no doubt that the mitogen-induced proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) is suppressed by corticosteroids. For example, Blecha and Baker (1986) demonstrated that cortisol, both in vitro and in vivo, reduced the proliferation of bovine PBMC, probably a result of suppressed production ofinterleukin-2 (IL-2). The suppressed IL-2 pro-duction is most likely to be a result of the interference of glucocorticosteroids with the transcription of genes coding for cytokines (Northrop et al., 1992) , as has also been shown for other immunoregulatory proteins (Helmberg et al., 1990) . However, the response to stressors shows considerable inter-species differences, and swine are regarded as corticosteroid resistant, as reviewed by Griffin ( 1989 ) .",

The tests of PBMC functions were performed both with purified PBMC and in whole blood cultures, attempting to mirror more closely the in vivo situation. Since approximately 90% of the Swedish fattening pigs are affected by infections with M. hyopneumoniae (WaUgren et al., 1993 ) , we studied the effect of ACTH treatments on the antibody response in vitro to that antigen. We also measured in vitro mitogen-induced proliferation and IL-2 production, as well as the ability of PBMC to produce interferon-a (IFN-a) after exposure to pseudorabies virus (PRV).",

The response to the first immunization also decreased to a significantly lower level (P<0.01; Day 30) for animals in Group A than for those in Groups B and C, respectively. After the second immunization (Days 32 and 35), isolated PBMC of all pigs became increasingly able to produce specific antibodies to M. hyopneumoniae (Fig. 7 (B) ) and thereafter (at Days 37 to 49) decreased. During this period, no differences were noted between the experimental groups. The ability to produce Ig at stimulation with a sub-mitogenic dose of PWM was tested with purified PBMC. The Ig production of PBMC from the various pigs ranged from 0.04 to 0.61 ng mi-~ culture medium during the experimental period, but no significant effects of treatment with ACTH in vivo were observed (results not shown ).",

Daily treatments with ACTH elevated the endogenous production of cortisol to levels corresponding to those elicited in pigs by restricted ability to move, electric pulsation or heat stress (Becker et al., 1985 ) . By this 'stress model', cortisol was found to influence the T-cell-dependent antibody production of PBMC to M. hyopneumoniae, but not the T-cell independent, polyclonally induced immunoglobulin production. Further, both the proliferation and IL-2 production were suppressed by cortisol when induced by the T-cell mitogens PHA and Con A, but not by PWM, which is believed to act both on T and B lymphocytes (Sharon, 1983) . Therefore, it seems likely that cortisol, also in swine, interferes with the production of IL-2 as described earlier for human (Bettens et al., 1984) and bovine (Blecha and Baker, 1986) cells.",

In accordance with earlier studies on oestradiol (Magnusson and Fossum, 1992 ) , the most pronounced effects were found in the whole blood cultures stimulated with PHA or Con A. As hormones are known to alter the number of blood lymphocytes, this has to be considered when functional tests are carried out in whole blood cultures. In the previous study on oestradiol, no significant correlation between cpm values and the total number of PBMC per milliliter of blood in the samples was found. Further, no significant effects of cell concentration were seen on the magnitude of proliferation in a pilot study where whole blood from four pigs was serial diluted and stimulated with PHA (mean cpm values_+ SD in blood diluted 1:10; 16332_+9631, 1:15; 12 150+_4170, 1:20; 10529_+7412, 1:25; 11 363 _+ 8542). Further, the responses to stimulation with PWM (proliferation and IL-2 production) were not severely affected, despite the variation in the number of PBMC per unit blood. Therefore, it is most likely that the glucocorticoid not only reduced the number of mononuclear cells in the blood circulation but also affected their responsiveness to stimulation with the T-cell mitogens PHA and Con A.",

( 1993 ) , who described a transient increase of porcine natural-interferon-producing (NIP) cell frequency in connection with vaccination, an increase in the IFN-a-producing capacity was found after the second immunization for all animals. When analysed in whole blood cultures, this increase in IFN-a-producing capacity was not as high for pigs treated for 2 weeks with ACTH as for pigs in the other two experimental groups. In contrast, when analysed in cultures of purified PBMC, the increase in the IFN-c~-producing capacity was more pronounced for ACTH-treated pigs than for non-treated pigs. One explanation for these discrepancies could be that the negative influence of cortisol seen in whole blood cultures is reduced when the PBMC are purified and cultured in medium free from cortisol. However, this is probably not the only explanation, as purified PBMC obtained from the ACTH treated pigs produced approximately twice the amount of IFN-a as PBMC obtained from the control pigs did. For example, if the number of a very efficient but rare circulating cell population, such as the porcine NIP-cell (one per 1000 PBMC), is unaltered despite the occurrence of lymphopenia, an enrichment of NIP cells in cultures with a fixed number of purified PBMC could account for the relatively higher amounts of IFN-a produced. In this context, it is notable that enrichment of porcine IFNproducing leukocytes increases the IFN yield per cell (Nowacki and Charley, 1993) .",

These results agree with those of Oldham and Bridger (1992) , who demonstrated that the time at which dexamethasone (DX) was administered to calves in relation to rotavirus infection was decisive as to the effect it had on their antibody production. When DX treatment started after primary, but before secondary, infection the systemic and local responses were not affected while they were inhibited when the DX treatment commenced prior to the primary infection. In the latter case, the clinical signs of disease were also greater. Consequently, the present experimental results suggest that 'stressors' that elicit an increased production of cortisol may interfere with the immune capacity of swine. This can be of clinical importance when pigs are exposed to new micro-organisms and external stressors simultaneously, e.g. when mixed and transported to new environments.",
