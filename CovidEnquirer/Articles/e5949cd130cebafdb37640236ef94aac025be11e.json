When transfected into a cell, the purified DNA of The ability to genetically manipulate viruses has led to extraordinary advances in understanding virus biology and to the establishment of useful vector systems. Initially confined to DNA viruses and retroviruses, RNA viruses have more recently become attractive candidates for expression of heterologous genes and offer promising perspectives for biomedical applications. 4 . In recent years, RNA viruses lacking a DNA phase in their replication cycle have also been manipulated. Since recombinant RNA techniques remain cumbersome, almost all studies with RNA viruses have relied upon cDNA intermediates to produce biologically active RNA molecules. Two major RNA virus groups, the positive strand and the negative strand RNA viruses, are distinguished based on whether their purified RNAs are able to initiate an infectious cycle or not. For the latter group, the minimal infectious unit is not an RNA molecule but a ribonucleoprotein qomplex (RNP). The reconstitution of functional RNPs from proteins and",

Such RNAs can be a source of defective interfering particles (Dis). Dis are able to replicate with the help of normal viruses, which provide the functions not encoded by the DI itself. Since DI genomes have to contain certain cisacting sequences to be replicated and packaged into infectious particles, construction of synthetic DI genomes can be used for the identification of replication and packaging signals.

In the virions, RNPs that contain the anti-messenger (negative) sense RNA are enclosed into simple envelopes containing an internal matrix protein (M) and one or two transmembrane spike proteins. The initiation of an infectious cycle requires the presence of a complete RNP.",

Since only one polymerase entry site (promoter) at the 3' end of the RNAs exists, the polymerase has to act in a processive mode for the synthesis of full length RNAs and in a nonprocessive mode for transcription (Fig. 3) . Most simply, this can be explained by the presence of a 'replicase' and 'transcriptase' form of the polymerase complex, with only the latter being able to recognize the internal cis-acting stop and restart signals that define the cistron borders. In contrast to transcription, the product of replication is not a free RNA, but an RNP. Since constant protein synthesis is a prerequisite for replication of all negative strand RNA viruses, it is assumed that RNA polymerization and encapsidation",

Transcripts that contained the terminal promoter sequences from an influenza virus genome segment and an internal chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) reporter gene were encapsidated in vitro by purified influenza virus nucleoprotein (NP) and the viral polymerase proteins PA, PB1 and PB2. After transfection of the reconstituted RNPs into influenza (helper-) virus-infected cells, the RNPS were replicated and transcribed. By reassortment of genome segments, the synthetic segment was incorporated into progeny virus (Fig. 4) Probably because of a tighter RNP structure, attempts to encapsidate preformed RNAs of nonsegmented viruses in vitro have failed. RNPs of these viruses are only formed inside a cell that provides the required viral proteins, as first demonstrated for a monocistronic Sendai virus minigenome 4s (Fig. 3) . By using REVIEWS similar model genomes, intracellular encapsidation systems were subsequently established for several rhabdo-and paramyxoviruses (reviewed in Ref. 46 ). The most well-developed approach makes use of the recombinant vaccinia virus-T7 RNA polymerase expression system 47 and involves simultaneous intracellular expression of both viral proteins and RNA from transfected plasmids (Fig. 4) . A major breakthrough in optimizing the system was exploitation of the autolytic activity of a hepatitis delta virus ribozyme, which is indiscriminate with regard to sequences 5' of its cleavage site, to develop plasmid vectors that allowed intracellular generation of RNAs with discrete 3' termini 22,48. RNAs ending with the correct 3' nucleotide can be generated by autolytic cleavage from primary transcripts containing the ribozyme sequence immediately downstream of the virus sequences. The approach appears to be applicable to most of the negative strand RNA viruses, including the segmented Bunya- Our lab was the first to show that for the rabies rhabdovirus, the RNA of a negative strand RNA virus can be made infectious by coexpression with the N, P and L proteins s5. An important feature of the approach was initiation of the infectious cycle by expressing the antigenomic RNA rather than the genomic RNA. This strategy avoided a potentially deleterious antisense problem, in which RNA transcripts encoding the N, P and L proteins would hybridize to the complementary viral genome sequences and interfere with correct encapsidation. As anticipated, rescue of a 12-kb fulllength RNA into a functional RNP is inefficient and therefore virus production is observed in only one in 106-107 transfected cells. The same strategy was used subsequently for successful recovery of the prototype rhabdovirus vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) s<57, and also of members from all three genera of the Paramyxoviridae family: recombinant measles (morbilli-) virus 5*, Sendai (paramyxo-) virus sg, and human respiratory syncytial (pneumo-) virus 6\u00b0 were recovered from full-length antigenome RNAs.",

Replacement of a genetic marker in the full-length Sendal virus cDNA with wild-type sequence was observed at high frequency and was triggered by vaccinia-induced recombination of the fulllength cDNA with a protein-encoding plasmid. This feature was exploited to create a novel Sendai virus whose genome was derived from the sequences of two independent plasmids sg.

By insertion of an additional gene end and start signal into the rabies virus genome, a virus was generated containing an extra transcription unit and transcribing an extra mRNA% This approach has allowed successful expression of reporter genes such as CAT from recombinant rabies virus 65 and also from VSV 66. Most remarkably, the foreign, and nonessential genes are maintained and expressed through, so far, more than 50 cell culture passages. This finding has confirmed the previous observation that genetic material with no apparent function, particularly large noncoding regions in the glycoprotein genes, are maintained stably in rabies and measles virus genomes 5s,sS. Continuous streamlining of positive strand RNA virus genomes and elimination of sequences not strictly required is probably achieved through recombination by a copy-choice mechanism, which involves detachment of the polymerase from the template, attachment to another template molecule and resumption of polymerization 67,6~. The tight encapsidation into nucleoprotein, which renders the genomes of rhabdoviruses and paramyxoviruses inaccessible for RNase degradation, will impede this mechanism. The tight RNP structure of nonsegmented negative strand RNA viruses had represented the major obstacle to their genetic manipulation, but now appears to be a most welcome feature of recombinant vectors. By selecting the site for introduction, as well as manipulation of genome and antigenome promoters 59,69, appropriate adjustment of the transcription level of foreign genes appears possible.

Moreover, earlier studies on the complementation analysis of a naturally occurring temperature-sensitive G mutant have shown that a signal sufficient for directing a foreign glycoprotein (HIV gp160) into the virus envelope is located in the cytoplasmic tail signal of the VSV G protein 71. Our recent discovery of rabies virion budding at the cell surface in the absence of any viral spike protein 72 has further suggested the possibility that rhabdoviruses with a wide range of surface proteins and the respective receptor specificities can be generated. In a first attempt towards this goal, we have complemented a recombinant G-deficient rabies virus mutant 72 with a chimeric HIV-1 gp 160 possessing the cytoplasmic tail signal of the rabies G protein.

Several RNA virus systems offer advantages in terms of host range, rapid engineering of expression constructs, production of high titer stocks of infectious particles and high levels of expression. Because of the limited genetic stability caused by recombination and error prone replication, positive strand RNA virus vectors might be most useful for transient high-level expression of RNAs and proteins. Although bioengineering of nonsegmented negative strand viruses has just begun, it is obvious that an important gap in the spectrum of viral vectors has been filled. Exciting prospects are offered by the simplicity of their genome organization and mechanism of expression, which should allow regulated expression of foreign genes. Most importantly, they exhibit a high genetic stability that is probably based in the RNP structure. In addition to their use as vaccines, these viruses may therefore have a role to play in somatic gene therapy as nonintegrative vectors. Appropriately attenuated vectors based on parainfluenza viruses or RSV, which exhibit a marked tropism for respiratory epithelia, might be used in the future for therapy of conditions such as cystic fibrosis. Furthermore, much effort will probably go into the development of targetable rhabdovirus-based vectors, which allow delivery of genes into specific cell types, such as cancer cells.",
