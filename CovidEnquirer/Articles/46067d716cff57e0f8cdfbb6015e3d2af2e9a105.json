In a recent case study, MERS-CoV shedding from the respiratory tract was detected until day 24 of illness. 4 In this study we investigated the viral shedding of MERS-CoV in the respiratory secretions of patients who were ill and those with mild disease who underwent repeated testing.",

'Positive test' curves were drawn for patients and contacts who had repeated testing. The statistical significance of the difference between the curves was assessed using a log-rank test.

In previous case reports, MERS-CoV was isolated from the respiratory tract secretions up to day 24 in one patient, 4 and day 18 in another. 6 In this large retrospective analysis, cases had more prolonged viral shedding from the respiratory tract than contacts. The difference is related to the severity of the disease and the significant underlying comorbidities among the cases. However, the study did not examine viral shedding systematically and thus patients with more severe disease may have been selected for repeat testing rather than those who had milder disease. A systematic and prospective study is required to further delineate the kinetics of MERS-CoV, not only in respiratory secretions but also in other body fluids (blood, urine, and stool). The reporting of these data is important to further characterize the pathogenesis of this disease and for better application of the infection prevention and control measures required. The need to quantify the viral load is also very important for any recommendations regarding the need for isolation of those who continue to have positive MERS-CoV by PCR. The presence of viral RNA in respiratory secretions may indicate a replicating or a dead virus.",

We have previously shown that lower respiratory tract samples yield higher MERS-CoV viral loads and genome fractions than upper respiratory tract samples. 7 Since cases had lower respiratory tract samples collected more often than upper respiratory tract samples, this indicates that cases were more ill and probably shed virus much longer. This finding, if confirmed by the prospective systematic collection of respiratory samples, would highlight the importance of applying prolonged infection control measures in severely ill patients with MERS-CoV in the healthcare setting. The pattern of transmission of MERS-CoV is well characterized as sporadic, intra-familial, and healthcareassociated. [8] [9] [10] The transmission of MERS-CoV within healthcare facilities was noted in the Al-Hasa outbreak, 11 and of 95 cases in one report, 63.2% were healthcare-associated and 13.7% were intra-familial transmission. 12 In support of the low infectivity of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases is the finding of a low transmission rate within family contacts. 13 Conflict of interest: No conflict of interest to declare.

            "text": "Since the first description of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), it has not been known how long patients shed the virus in respiratory secretions. Thus, we analyzed the available data on time to negative MERS-CoV test in patients with confirmed MERS-CoV infection and asymptomatic positive contacts. Methods: Data from repeated laboratory testing of respiratory samples received at the Saudi Arabian virology reference laboratory in Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia from September 1, 2012 to September 31, 2013 were recorded. A real-time RT-PCR test for MERS-CoV was used. Data were analyzed by origin of sample, sample type, and MERS-CoV PCR test results. Results: Twenty-six individuals (13 patients and 13 contacts) had repeated testing done until a negative test was obtained. Most samples from MERS-CoV cases were tracheal aspirate/sputum (p = 0.0006) and most samples from contacts were nose and throat swabs (p = 0.0002). Kaplan-Meier curve analysis showed that contacts cleared the virus at a much earlier time than patients. On day 12, 30% of contacts and 76% of cases were still positive for MERS-CoV by PCR. Conclusions: Contacts cleared MERS-CoV earlier than ill patients. This finding could be related to the types of sample as well as the types of patient studied. More ill patients with significant comorbidities shed the virus for a significantly longer time. The results of this study could have critical implications for infection control guidance and its application in healthcare facilities handling positive cases. \u00df 2014 The Authors.
