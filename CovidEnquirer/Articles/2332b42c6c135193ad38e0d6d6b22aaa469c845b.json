            "text": "A novel titanium dioxide-coated cordierite foam (TiO 2 /cordierite foam) was developed for use in air cleaners. By a simple impregnation procedure, TiO 2 nanoparticles were immobilized firmly onto the surface of a cordierite foam substrate through high-temperature (500 \u2022 C) calcination. The strong bactericidal performance of the fabricated foam was evaluated by a newly developed test method for complex threedimensional through-pore structures. This method could trace 5-6 log units of decrease in bacterial cell numbers in an air environment, thus meeting the criteria of both the JIS and ISO standard test methods. With 0.25 mW cm \u22122 of UV-A irradiation for 24 h, the bactericidal rate of the TiO 2 /cordierite foam exceeded 99.9% for five types of airborne or droplet-based infectious pathogens: Escherichia coli (E. coli), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Legionella pneumophila (L. pneumophila), Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The results of repeat testing, where the same sample was used three times, revealed that the bactericidal rate for E. coli was maintained at 99.9% in the second and third use, indicating that the TiO 2 /cordierite foam possesses a long-term bactericidal action. The TiO 2 /cordierite foam also exhibited a high photocatalytic degradation capability on gaseous acetaldehyde, which is associated with sick building syndrome, and volatile organic compounds to generate CO 2 and H 2 O. The results demonstrated that TiO 2 -coated cordierite foam has great potential for use in air-cleaning filters with not only high bactericidal performance to remove pathogens in the air and in droplets, but also strong decontaminating and deodorizing functionality. (Y. Yao). medical drugs, fungicides and bactericidal materials, is becoming a central concern in many scientific fields.",

            "text": "Recently, titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) has attracted widespread attention as an antimicrobial semiconductor photocatalyst because it is regarded as environmentally friendly, while at the same time possessing strong bactericidal properties. This activity is associated with the strong oxidizing power of TiO 2 when it is exposed to UV light with wavelengths of less than 385 nm. When exposed to near-UV light, TiO 2 can generate a hole-excited electron pair due to band gap excitation on its surface [5] . Through the combined action of superoxide radicals (O 2 \u2022\u2212 ) produced by the reduction of oxygen with an excited electron, hydroxyl radicals (OH \u2022 ) produced by the oxidation of water and photo-generated electrons/holes, most organic compounds can be decomposed and mineralized to CO 2 and H 2 O [6-9]. As the single most important effect of TiO 2 photocatalysis, its bactericidal activity has been studied in various microorganisms including Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), as well as in fungi. In addition, the mechanism of this antimicrobial photocatalysis has been 0926-3373/$ -see front matter",

Typically, TiO 2 -coated medical devices and equipment such as catheters [10, 16] , lancets [17] and surgical masks [18] have been developed with a view to self-sterilization functionality to aid in the reduction of nosocomial infections. Highly porous ceramic foams including porous alumina [19] , porous silica [20] , activated carbon [21] , as well as nickel foam [22] , have been chosen as substrates for photocatalytic water and air purification and disinfection systems.

The optical layer consisted of small TiO 2 platelets with smooth surfaces exhibiting a roughly average thickness of 10-20 m, separated by deep cracks [ Fig. 3(a-c) ]. The cracks may have formed during or after the heat treatment due to the difference in heat dissipation between the cordierite substrate and the TiO 2 coating. These multiple microscopic cracks were expected to relieve the stress when the coated foams were struck. By comparison, bare cordierite foam exhibits a rough surface with many microscopic pores, as shown in Fig. 3 (d-f). We considered that these microscopic pores might enhance the adhesive strength of the TiO 2 coating layer onto the bare cordierite foam. Up to now, a large number of papers on TiO 2 photocatalytic reactions have stressed that photocatalytic activity depends on the dose of TiO 2 , the UV light intensity for irradiation, and the irradiation time. Yu et al. verified that photocatalytic efficiency strongly depends on the surface structure of the TiO 2 thin films prepared by the sol-gel method [26] . They proposed that the aggregation and growth of TiO 2 particles in the interior region of thick films which undergo long-term heat treatment leads to a decrease in the number of active surface sites. Thus, improving the crystalline mesoparticles of TiO 2 on the cordierite foam frame serves to increase its bactericidal activity and the purification performance of air-cleaning filters. ",

However, this manner is impossible for porous foams. In order to ensure a high initial concentration of bacterial cells, we soaked the foam samples in the E. coli suspensions at a cell concentration of 10 7 CFU ml \u22121 for various periods of time. We then centrifuged the drenched foam to remove the residual bacterial suspensions filling the holes in the foam in order to ensure that the photocatalytic surface was accessible to the bacterial cells being tested. Here, we investigated the optimum conditions, including the soaking time for adsorption equilibrium, the centrifugation speed and the time required to obtain \"semi-dry\" ceramic foam loaded with a sufficient number of evenly absorbed bacterial cells. Fig. 4(A) shows that, when the centrifugation was performed for only 5 s at 3000 rpm, the number of bacterial cells loaded on the coated and bare foams did not meet the requirements of the standard methods. However, at 500 rpm, the residual bacterial suspensions filling the pores of the foam were completely removed; meanwhile, the number of adsorbed bacterial cells reached 10 5 CFU.

This characteristic does not fundamentally change in a 1/500 NB solution which contains a small amount of organic matter and NaCl. In 1999, Janusz et al. reported a surface measurement of about \u221211 mV for TiO 2 in a very low-concentration NaCl solution [27] . Meanwhile, bacterial cells also have a negative surface potential in conditions with a pH value over 4. Therefore, it can be inferred that bacterial cells may not be strongly adsorbed onto a TiO 2 thin film covering a cordierite foam frame in a neutral pH environment without UV-A irradiation. The thus adsorbed bacteria actually consist of microorganisms contained in a physically adsorbed 1/500 NB aqueous film. We estimated that the amount of adsorbed E. coli on the surface of the \"semi-dry\" foam depends on the thickness of the liquid film covering the foam frame. This phenomenon is similar to the film formation achieved with the spin coating method described by Brinker et al. in 1990 [28] : that is, the thickness of the liquid film is determined mainly by centrifugation speed, centrifugation time and the viscosity of the liquid while the initial liquid amount remains constant.

While the water on the foam surface deriving from water vapor via physisorption in an air environment is estimated to be lower than in artificial liquid films, there is no doubt that the bactericidal action of the TiO 2 /cordierite foam can be mainly attributed to the reduction/oxidation of the adsorbed reactants directly by electrons/holes in the foam.",

As is well known, UV-A wavelengths are less effective in inducing DNA damage related to bacterial death, because they are not absorbed by native DNA; however, they can still produce secondary photoreactions with existing DNA photoproducts or damage DNA via indirect photosensitizing reactions. In fact, photons from UV-A radiation and visible light up to 670 nm are also able to generate singlet oxygen through type-II photosensitization reactions [29, 30] . However, this decrease in survival cannot be identified as efficacious bactericidal action by JIS or ISO standards. In addition, it also has been noted that damaged DNA can be repaired by some bacteria (e.g. E. coli) in both light and dark environments, by mechanisms commonly referred to as photoreactivation and dark repair [31] [32] [33] . Photocatalysis has been demonstrated to inhibit the repairs attributed to the loss of cell membrane integrity caused by the electrons/holes or by reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the leakage of cell contents [12, 34] , highlighting the advantage of the application of TiO 2 /cordierite foam in air disinfection.",

            "text": "Because the colony-forming method has a limitation in terms of detection, we immersed the foam loaded with E. coli cells and exposed to UV-A for 24 or 48 h in NB liquids in order to check whether or not bacteria adsorbed on the TiO 2 /cordierite foam could be completely killed by UV-A irradiation. We then incubated them at 37 \u2022 C for 24 h. During the incubation, we traced the OD (600) value to observe the growth of the surviving bacteria cells. According to the results shown in Table 1 , the adsorbed bacteria cells were completely inactivated after 48 h of UV-A irradiation, even though the foam was 10 mm thick. This phenomenon can be attributed to the random refraction of UV-A by the TiO 2 /cordierite foam. Fig. 6 shows the results of the bactericidal tests when the same sample was used three times. As is seen from the data, the bactericidal activity decreased slightly with the second and third use. However, this reduction was only observed with 4 or 8 h of UV-A illumination. After 24 h of UV-A illumination, the bactericidal rates were maintained at 99.99% for the second and third use. This indicates that the TiO 2 /cordierite foam possesses a long-term bactericidal action and reusability. In an aqueous phase, dead or damaged bacterial cells can be washed off the active photocatalytic surface. However, in an air-phase system, the dead cells may have the potential to accumulate and block the photoactive surface. Jacoby et al. observed the mineralization of E. coli cell masses on a TiO 2 surface in air with long-term (75 h) UV-A illumination [35] . Therefore, the long-term bactericidal action and reusability of TiO 2 coated foam are beneficial in reducing active surface blocking. ",

This decontaminating and deodorizing ability was investigated by TiO 2 photocatalytic degradation on gaseous organic substrates, as described earlier. The reaction time profiles shown in Fig. 7A indicates that acetaldehyde concentration on TiO 2 /cordierite foam decreases rapidly, while a simultaneous formation of CO 2 is observed. There is no decrease in acetaldehyde levels on the cordierite foam without TiO 2 loading, as shown in Fig. 7B . The decomposition rate constant for gaseous acetaldehyde -that is, k 1 = 15.6 [h \u22121 ] -was calculated to be in the range of 0-0.15 h. The complete oxidation reaction of acetaldehyde (CH 3 CHO) into CO 2 and H 2 O shows that the smoother surface of the foam created in this experiment provides a higher photocatalytic reaction rate. This is very important from the viewpoint of practical applications, because it is known to be one of the principal odor-causing gases in indoor air, particularly in cigarette smoke [36] .",

The smooth surface of the novel foam offered strongly photocatalytic bactericidal activity and decomposition performance. When treated by relatively low-intensity UV-A irradiation (0.25 mW cm \u22122 ) for 24 h, the TiO 2 -coated cordierite foam reduced by over 99.9% the number of viable cells of three gram-negative strains of bacteria (E. coli, L. pneumophila, K. pneumoniae), and also the gram-positive methicillin-resistant S. aureus, all of which are extremely important airborne infectious bacteria. The bactericidal activity assessment was carried out by an original test method developed for the three-dimensional porous structures seen in various ceramic and metal foams. All of the data obtained in this study showed high reproducibility and indicated that the bactericidal test method developed here can trace 5-6 log units of decrease in bacterial cells in environmental air and can thus meet the criteria of the JIS and ISO standard test methods. The novel foam also exhibited a high photocatalytic degradation reaction on gaseous acetaldehyde to generate CO 2 and H 2 O. All of these results indicate that TiO 2 -coated cordierite foam is a promising material for use in air-cleaning filters by virtue of its high bactericidal activity and decontaminating, deodorizing performance for air disinfection and purification.",
