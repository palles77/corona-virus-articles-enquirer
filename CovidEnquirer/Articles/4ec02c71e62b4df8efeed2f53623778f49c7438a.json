Currently, there is no effective approved vaccine for CCHF. In this study, we used a computer-aided vaccine design approach to develop the first multi-epitope recombinant vaccine for CCHF. For this purpose, linear B-cell and T-cell binding epitopes from two structural glycoproteins of CCHF virus including Gc and Gn were predicted. The epitopes were further studied regarding their antigenicity, allergenicity, hydrophobicity, stability, toxicity and population coverage. A total number of seven epitopes including five T-cell and two B-cell epitopes were screened for the final vaccine construct. Final vaccine construct composed of 382 amino acid residues which were organized in four domains including linear B-cell, T-cell epitopes and cholera toxin B-subunit (CTxB) along with heat labile enterotoxin IIc B subunit (LT-IIc) as adjuvants. All the segments were joined using appropriate linkers. The physicochemical properties as well as the presence of IFN-\u03b3 inducing epitopes in the proposed vaccine, was also checked to determining the vaccine stability, solubility and its ability to induce cell-mediated immune responses. The 3D structure of proposed vaccine was subjected to the prediction of computational B-cell epitopes and molecular docking studies with MHC-I and II molecules. Furthermore, molecular dynamics stimulations were performed to study the vaccine-MHCs complexes stability during stimulation time. The results suggest that our proposed vaccine was stable, well soluble in water and potentially antigenic. Results also demonstrated that the vaccine can induce both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses and could serve as a promising anti-CCHF vaccine candidate.",

            "text": "Generally, vaccines can be considered as effective immunity inducer against pathogens as well as an active way to control infectious diseases. Due to the wide variety and extensive genetic variation among different CCHFV serotypes, conventional vaccine platforms such as liveattenuated and inactivated vaccine cannot protect persons against different CCHFV strains. Furthermore, there are some drawbacks associated with conventional vaccines including weak immunity, multi-dose administration, allergenic potential and low safety. Consequently currently, new vaccine platforms such as Subunit Vaccines, DNA vaccine, and multi-epitope vaccine (MEV) are highly regarded [13] . Among them, due to high specificity, safety and low-cost production of MEVs these vaccines have attracted attention. Commonly, MEVs are engineered based on dominant and conserved B-and T-cell epitopes from desired antigens without potential IgE-epitopes. Accordingly, an effective MEV can provide an effective immunization against different serotypes of a pathogen. Despite mentioned advantages of MEVs, poor immunogenicity is considered as a major drawback to development of MEVs [14] [15] [16] . To overcome the mentioned blind spot use of some natural protein-based adjuvants such as diphtheria toxin (DT), cholera toxin B-subunit (CTxB), heat-labile enterotoxin B subunit (LTB) and toll-like receptors (TLRs) ligands in final construct of proposed vaccines is suggested [17] [18] [19] . In the study, CTxB and LT-IIc were selected as protein adjuvants. CTxB is a 124 amino acids, nontoxic, homopantameric, commercially available and membrane-binding subunit of cholera toxin that could increase homoral and mocusal immunity response. Furthermore, CTxB receptor is widely expressed in the plasma membrane of immune cells; therefor the protein is highly regarded as suitable natural adjuvant [20] . LT-IIc is a member of the type II subfamily of LTBs that composed by 121 amino acid residues. Moreover, LT-IIc is one of the best-studied type II LTB which has been shown to enhance antigen-specific CD8 + T cell immune responses when co-administered with a model antigen [21] .",

Therefore, in the present study, we used a special multi-steps procedure to decrease mentioned obstacles. In our protocol linear B cell epitopes were selected based on their antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity, and water solubility as decisive parameters. Similarly, antigenicity, hydrophobicity, population coverage and allergenicity were considered as determining parameters to T-cell epitope prediction. The screened epitopes were then merged to each other as well as to two natural adjuvants using appropriate linkers for organization of final vaccine construct. Furthermore, the efficacy and stability of the vaccine were evaluated by a set of bioinformatics approaches including molecular docking, molecular dynamics and in silico cloning.",

The release of IFN-\u03b3 is the important step of the Th1 response that induce the production of protective virus-neutralizing IgG and enhance the magnitude of antiviral cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) responses [46] .

In Oany et al study degree of conservancy was considered as determining factor while along with conservancy some other factors such as immunogenicity level, allergenicity, population coverage and physicochemical properties of an epitope must be considered for epitope-based vaccine design. The mentioned parameters were considered in the present study. Furthermore, in the mentioned study envelope glycoprotein of CCHFV was also evaluated for determination of conserved epitopes.

T-cells have the key role in antibody production through polarization to Th2 and antigen presenting during viral infections [56, 57] . Accordingly, dominant T-cell epitopes of both Gc and Gn were predicted with the help of a multi-step screening procedure. To screening T-cell epitopes, firstly MHC-I restricted T-cell epitopes were predicted. In the next step, the predicted epitopes was checked for their ability to binding to MHC-II alleles. After that, as primary screening, the T-cell epitopes with ability to bind to both MHC-I and II were selected for further analysis. Finally, five T-cell epitopes were screened based on antigenicity, population coverage, hydrophobicity and allergenicity. Chowell et al demonstrated that hydrophobicity is a hallmark of immunogenic T-cell epitopes and marks a step toward removing the requirement for experimental epitope testing for vaccine development [58] . Therefore, in the study, for first time we considered hydrophobicity of the predicted T-cell epitopes as a determining factor in epitope screening process. B-cell epitopes have a pivotal role in boosting neutralizing-antibody responses in different infections. Consequently, currently identification of B-cell epitopes is highly considered for epitope-driven vaccine development and diagnostic reagents design [59, 60] . With the aim of achieving a potent protective immunity against CCHF two top-ranked linear B-cell epitopes were selected based on their antigenicity, allergenicity, toxicity and hydrophilicity. The screened B-and T-cell epitopes were combined into our vaccine construct as the final immunodominant epitopes using GPGPGPG linker to retain both structural features and conformational dependent immunogenicity of the epitope vaccine.",

Quality of the refined model was assigned by Ramachandran plot, ERRAT quality factor, and ProSA z-score, and the results demonstrated that the quality of the refined model was significantly improved. Since discontinuous B-cell epitopes as well as IFN-\u03b3 inducing epitopes have a crucial role in humoral and cell-mediated adaptive immune responses by producing antibodies and stimulating macrophages and natural killer cells, prediction of the epitopes currently are highly considered for vaccine design [13] . Subsequently, prediction of discontinuous B-cell epitopes and IFN-\u03b3 inducing epitopes were performed. For this, the refined 3D model was subjected to prediction as input, and results showed that 207 residues out of 382 residues of the vaccine were defined as a conformational B-cell epitope. Furthermore, the results indicated that there were 40 positive IFN-\u03b3 inducing epitopes in our vaccine, which shows the vaccine can provoke a strong antibody secretion, cellmediated responses and long-running protection against CCHFV.",

Accordingly, the high affinity of a multi-epitope vaccine to MHC molecules can be considered as a determining factor. Therefore, we evaluated the binding affinity of the vaccine to MHC-I and II using molecular docking study. The results confirmed that our vaccine has high affinity to both MHC molecules. To gain more insight into the vaccine-MHCs interaction and evaluate their stability, topranked complexes of the vaccine-MHC-I as well as vaccine-MHC-II were subjected to MD stimulations. The results confirmed the suitable stability of the studied complexes demonstrating persistent interactions between MHC molecules and our proposed vaccine.",

In general, after proposing an in silico designed vaccine candidate some in vitro and in vivo validation such as potential toxicity, probable allergenicity, cross-reactivity, stability, determination of effective dose, total antibody titers and proliferation of lymphocytes, challenge in animal model must be done to clarify the vaccine efficacy [64] . Vaccine development is a time-consuming, complex and costly process that can be simplified in to two main stages including pre-clinical and clinical developments. In two mentioned stages selection of the right antigen(s), vaccine efficacy in test tubes and animals, formulation, safety for human use, good manufacturing practice standards, immunity against Table 9 The predicted IFN-\u03b3 inducing epitopes from the proposed vaccine. A total number of 40 positive IFN-\u03b3 inducing epitopes with a score of greater than or equal to one were predicted from the vaccine. The amino acid residues of the vaccine, which are located in 126-141 region showed highest score (1.21 artificial infection and clinical disease, vaccine efficacy under natural disease conditions and the long-term efficacy are assessed. However, the vaccine development time, may be affected by some other parameters such as nature of target pathogen, equipment and facilities available, technical and manufacturing hurdles [65, 66] . Therefore, determining the exact time to introduce a vaccine is very difficult; but using computational methods and in silico validations the required time can be reduced. Due to the encouraging results of the study, the proposed vaccine could synthesized by chemical methods such as coupling short peptides or expressed in different hosts such as bacteria, yeast, mammalian and plant cells for more in vitro and in vivo evaluations. Moreover, the efficacy of the proposed vaccine may be improved using novel antigen delivery systems such as Nano delivery platforms [67] [68] [69] .",

Based on this method, linear B-cell and T-cell epitopes from Gc and Gn of CCHFV were identified and selected as a core of a multi-epitope recombinant vaccine for CCHF. The results of this study suggest that our proposed protein vaccine can stimulate both humoral and cellular immune responses against CCHFV and could serve as a potential vaccine against CCHF. However, in vitro and in vivo immunological experiments are needed to validate the efficacy of the vaccine. Furthermore, based on the promising results of this study our proposed vaccine candidate can be subjected to an experimental cloning and purification as well as next in vitro and in vivo evaluations such as in vitro and in vivo stability and toxicity, the ability to enhance total antibody titer, human lymphocyte proliferation and creating immunity against the infection.",
