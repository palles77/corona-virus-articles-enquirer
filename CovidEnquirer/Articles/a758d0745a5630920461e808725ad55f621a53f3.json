Monoclonal antibodies J .7 .2 and J .2 .2 bind to topographically distinct sites on E2 . NR variants selected with J .7 .2, like parental JHMV, predominantly cause a fatal encephalitis when given intracerebrally to mice, while J .2 .2-selected NR variants cause a subacute disease characterized by paralysis and severe demyelination . We report here that consecutive selection with both J .2 .2 and J .7 .2 monoclonal antibodies results in NR variants which are markedly attenuated in both encephalitic potential and ability to induce demyelination . Analysis of the different variants suggests that the subregion of E2 bound by monoclonal antibody J .7 .2 may be a critical viral determinant of paralysis and demyelination in this model system .",

Thus, NR variants are ideal tools for studying viral pathogenesis, since the resulting disease may be linked to a discrete, definable genetic change in a single virus-encoded protein . 20 Antigenic variants were initially selected with monoclonal antibodies specific for the major JHMV envelope glycoprotein, E2 . E2 has several important biological activities, including virus attachment to target cells, induction of cell fusion, and the elicitation of neutralizing antibodies . 21-24 Thus, it was expected that viruses selected for putative mutations in E2 might have significant alterations in pathogenesis . As we have previously reported, JHMV NR mutants selected with monoclonal antibody J .2 .2 were in fact found to have markedly reduced neurovirulence and to cause a subacute, paralytic demyelinating disease . 12 The J .2 .2-selected variants had little or no tropism for neurons, and this feature may have accounted for their relative avirulence .

Under these conditions it was possible to produce a subacute, fatal encephalitis with variant 2 .2/7 .2-V-1, but not with NR variant 2 .2/7 .2-V-2 . Although mice given high doses of either double NR variant continued to show foci of inflammation and myelin loss in the white matter, no mouse showed the extensive and severe demyelinating lesions characteristic of paralytic single variant 2 .2-V-1 (Fig . 2(A) ) . Significantly, neither 2 .2/7 .2-V-1 nor 2 .2/7 .2-V-2 produced clinically evident paralysis at any dose . We conclude that the disease caused by the double NR variants (non-paralytic) is a different type than that caused by single NR variant 2 .2-V-1 (paralytic) ; that is, the diminished demyelination caused by the double NR variants is not a quantitative effect which can be overcome by inoculating greater numbers of viruses . In order to assess the initial target cells of the viruses, the immunohistochemical studies summarized in Table 1 were undertaken at 3-4 days after 1000 PFU of each variant was given i .c . In all cases, viral antigen distribution was multifocal, rather than uniform . Nevertheless, each virus showed a consistent predilection for certain CNS regions and cell types . For example, JHMV-DL antigen was found in both white and gray matter; both neurons and glial cells contained abundant viral protein (Fig . 4(A) ) . By contrast, mice inoculated with single NR variant 2 .2-V-1 showed antigen in glial cells in white matter and, to a lesser extent, in gray matter (Fig . 4(B) ) ; however, as we have reported previously, 12 this variant did not appear to infect neurons . Similarly, the double NR variant 2 .2/7 .2-V-1 also showed marked preference for white matter and glial cells (Fig . 4(C) ) ; however, this variant occasionally infected neurons, although less frequently than the panencephalitic parental virus, JHMV-DL . Variant 2 .2/7 .2-V-1 usually involved neurons only when they were adjacent to heavily- (Fig . 4(D) ) . Inconsistent infection of ependymal cells and meninges was seen with all viruses . Subacutely, at 19 days after infection with any of the three NR variants, low levels of viral antigen could occasionally be found only in the white matter .",

Figure 5 shows the kinetics of viral replication in the brains of mice inoculated i .c . with 1000 PFU of each virus . Maximal viral titers in brain were observed at day 3 with the NR variants and day 5 with the parental virus JHMV- We conclude that the relative avirulence of the variants was unlikely to be due to diminished replication, since avirulent variant 2 .2/7 .2-V-1 grew nearly as well as highly encephalitic parental virus JHMV-DL . Similarly, the diminished demyelination shown by the double variants also could not be attributed to reduced replication, since the viral titers in mice given the double variants were usually equal to or greater than those in mice infected with the single variant 2 .2-V-1, which caused severe demyelination and clinically evident paralysis . All three variants showed phenotypic stability upon recovery at day 10 ; that is, they did not revert to the parental antigenic type, as judged by differential neutralizations performed as previously described . 12 19 We have extended the analysis of JHMV pathogenesis by sequentially selecting variants for resistance to neutralization by two monoclonal antibodies recognizing separate antigenic sites on the major glycoprotein of JHMV, the E2 molecule . Two double N R variants, 2 .2/7 .2-V-1 and 2 .2/7 .2-V-2, were compared to the single variant (2 .2-V-1) from which they were selected . While the double variants replicated relatively efficiently in vivo, they caused no clinically evident paralysis, in marked contrast to the paralysis readily produced by single variant 2 .2-V-1 . Histological studies showed that the severity of demyelination was substantially reduced in mice infected with the double NR variants . It is not known why the double NR variants, both selected by the same procedure, have minor pathogenic differences, for example, in relative tropism for neurons . In this regard, sequencing data on other NR variants has shown that a given monoclonal antibody may select several different mutations .\" Alternatively, it is possible that one of the variants has an additional point mutation ; however, in view of the selection frequency of JHM NR variants (approximately 10 -45 ), we believe this explanation is unlikely .",

For example, our prior study 12 showed that J . The main finding of our present studies is that the double NR variants cause no paralysis clinically and reduced demyelination histologically . Presumably, a single point mutation in E2 distinguishes these variants from the single NR variant from which they were derived . These results imply that J .7 .2 binds to a site on E2 which has a major influence on the process of demyelination . Studies with recombinant viruses 29 with crossovers in the E2 gene (Makino et al., in press) suggest that the J .7 .2 binding site may be near the carboxyl terminus of E2 . Nevertheless, this subregion of E2 clearly cannot be the only viral determinant of demyelination, since the double NR mutants continue to cause low levels of subclinical myelin loss .",

Interestingly, comparative binding studies with available NR variants and monoclonal antibodies have demonstrated that the site recognized by J .7 .2 is part of an overlapping complex in which at least three antigenically distinct subregions can be identified (Fleming, unpublished observations) . Also, as has been shown with other viral proteins, the antigenic determinants of E2 may depend on complex intramolecular steric and conformational effects . These effects may explain the fact that variant 2 .2-V-1 is resistant to monoclonal antibodies J .2 .2 and J .7 .2 when used separately but is consistently neutralized by these antibodies when used simultaneously . In other viral systems it has been demonstrated that the binding of one monoclonal antibody may enhance the binding of a second monoclonal antibody to a distant site on a viral protein .'\"' The possibility that such synergism may underlie the action of J .2 .2 and J .7 .2 is currently under investigation .",
