            "text": "A biological membrane is semipermeable, meaning it is permeable to some molecules, most notably water, while being very impermeable to most solutes (various biochemicals and salts) found in the bathing solution. This very important concept of unequal transmembrane distribution and, hence, permeability between water and other solutes came out of the pioneering work of Charles Overton in the 1890s (see Chapter 2) . How does a biological membrane accomplish semipermeability? The barrier to solute movement is largely provided by the membrane's hydrophobic core, a very thin (w40 \u00c5 thick), oily layer. The inherent permeability of this core varies from membrane to membrane. Generally, the more tightly packed the lipids comprising the bilayer, the lower its permeability will be. Lipid bilayers are very impermeable to most solutes because of their tight packing. Fig. 19 .1 depicts the membrane permeability of a variety of common solutes [1] . Note the data are presented as a log scale of solute permeability (P in cm/s) and ranges from Na \u00fe \u00bc 10 \u00c012 cm/s to water \u00bc 0.2 \u00c2 10 \u00c02 cm/s, spanning almost 10 orders of magnitude! Lipid bilayer permeability is not a constant but instead is affected by environmental factors. For example, LUVs (large unilamellar veicles) made from DPPC (16:0, 16:0 PC) have a sharp phase transition temperature, T m , of 41.3 C. At temperatures well below T m , the LUVs are in the tightly packed gel state and permeability is extremely low. At temperatures well above T m , the LUVs are in the loosely packed liquid disordered state (l d , also called the liquid crystalline state) and permeability is high. However, maximum permeability is not found in the l d state, but rather at the T m [2] . As the LUVs are heated from the gel state and approach the T m , domains of l d start to form in the gel state. Solutes can then pass more readily through the newly formed l d domains than the gel domains resulting in an increase in permeability. At T m there is a maximum amount of coexisting gel and l d state domains that exhibit extremely porous domain boundaries. It is through these boundaries that most permeability occurs. As the temperature is further increased, the LUVs pass into the l d state and the interface boundaries disappear, reducing permeability to that observed for the single-component l d state. Thus, maximum permeability is observed at the T m .",

The relationship between a solute's molecular weight and its diffusion coefficient is shown in Table 19 .1. Large solutes have low diffusion coefficients and therefore diffuse more slowly than small solutes. The diffusion rate for a particular solute under physiological conditions is a constant and cannot be increased. This defines the theoretical limit for an enzymatic reaction rate and also limits the size of a cell. If a solute starts at the center of a bacterial cell, it takes about 10 \u00c03 s to diffuse to the plasma membrane. For this reason, typical cells are microscopic (see Chapter 1) .

An early application of the basic principles of osmosis came from the pioneering work on hemolysis of red blood cells by William Hewson in the 1770s (see Chapter 2) . It has also been discussed that MLVs (multilamellar vesicles, liposomes) behave as almost perfect osmometers, swelling in hypotonic solutions and shrinking in hypertonic solutions (see Chapter 3) [5, 6] . Liposome swelling and shrinking can be easily followed by changes in absorbance due to light scattering using a simple spectrophotometer. Therefore, osmosis has been investigated for many years using common and inexpensive methodologies and a lot is known about the process.",

Active transport requires additional energy, often in the form of ATP, and results in a nonequilibrium, net accumulation (uptake) of the solute on one side of the membrane.

From the activation energies for transmembrane simple passive diffusion of glycol, glycerol and erythritol presented in Table 19 .2, it can be estimated that the activation energy for glucose should be well over 100 kJ/mol, but instead it is only 16 kJ/mol. This large discrepancy is attributed to the presence of a glucose-facilitated diffusion carrier. Fig. 19 .6 demonstrates the mode of action of one of these transporters, GLUT-1, from the erythrocyte [10] . GLUTs occur in nearly all cells and are particularly abundant in cells lining the small intestine. GLUTs are but one example in a superfamily of transport facilitators. GLUTs are integral membrane proteins whose membrane-spanning region is composed of 12 a-helices. GLUTs function through a typical membrane transport mechanism [10] . Glucose binds to the membrane outer surface site causing a conformational change associated with transport across the membrane. At the inner side of the membrane, glucose is released into the internal aqueous solution ( Fig. 19 ",

All potassium channel subunits have a distinctive pore-loop structure that sits at the top of the channel and is responsible for potassium selectivity [12] . This is often referred to as a selectivity or filter loop. The selectivity filter strips the waters of hydration from the potassium ion, allowing it into the channel. Farther down the structure is a 10-\u00c5-diameter, transmembrane, water-filled central channel that conducts potassium across the membrane. Elucidating the three-dimensional structure of this important integral membrane protein by X-ray crystallography ( Fig. 19 .7) [12] was a seminal accomplishment in the field of membrane biophysics. For this FIGURE 19 .7 Three-dimensional structure of the potassium channel [12] .

The opening of a Na \u00fe channel has a selectivity filter that attracts Na \u00fe . From there the Na \u00fe ions flow into a constricted part of the channel that is about 3e5 \u00c5 wide.

Although it had been predicted that water pores must exist in very leaky cells, it was not until 1992 that Peter Agre (Fig. 19 .10) at Johns Hopkins University identified a specific transmembrane water pore that was later called aquaporin-1. For this accomplishment Agre shared the 2003 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with Rod MacKinnon for his work on the potassium channel. Aquaporins are usually specific for water permeability and exclude the passage of other solutes. A type of aquaporin known as aqua-glyceroporins can also conduct some very small uncharged solutes such as glycerol, CO 2 , ammonia, and urea across the membrane.

This ion gradient is coupled to the movement of a solute in either the same direction (symport) or in the opposite direction (antiport, see Fig. 19 .12, [18] ). Movement of the pumped ion down its electrochemical gradient is by facilitated diffusion. The purpose of both types of co-transport is to use the energy in an electrochemical gradient to drive the movement of another solute against its gradient.

He reported that valinomycin, a known antibiotic, stimulated K \u00fe uptake and H \u00fe efflux from mitochondria. Many studies showed that valinomycin dissipates essential transmembrane electrochemical gradients causing tremendous metabolic upheaval in many organisms including microorganisms. It is for this reason that valinomycin was recognized as an antibiotic long before it was identified as an ionophore. Currently several ionophores are added to animal feed as antibiotics and growth enhancing additives [33] . Recently valinomycin has been reported to be the most potent agent against SARS-CoV (severe acute respiratory-syndrome coronavirus), a severe form of pneumonia first identified in 2003 [34] . Fig. 19.19 ) is considered to be the classic uncoupler of oxidative phosphorylation (see Chapter 18) . It is a synthetic lipid-soluble proton ionophore that dissipates proton gradients across bioenergetic membranes (mitochondrial inner, thylakoid, bacterial plasma). An uncoupler is therefore an H \u00fe -facilitated diffusion carrier. Elucidating the role of DNP in uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation was an essential component in support of Peter Mitchell's chemiosmotic hypothesis [25] . Electron movement from NADH or FADH 2 to O 2 via the mitochondrial electron transport system generates a considerable amount of electrical energy that is partially captured as a transmembrane pH gradient (see Chapter 18) . The movement of H \u00fe s back across the membrane, driven by the electrochemical gradient, is through a channel in the F 1 ATPase (an F-type primary active transport system discussed above, (Chapter 19, Section 4.1)) that is coupled to ATP synthesis. DNP short-circuits the H \u00fe gradient before it can pass through the F 1 ATPase, thus uncoupling electron transport, the energy source for the H \u00fe gradient, from ATP synthesis. Therefore, in the presence of DNP, electron transport continues, even at an accelerated rate, but ATP production is diminished. The energy that should have been converted to chemical energy in the form of ATP is then released as excess heat.",

The first crown ether was synthesized by Charles Pederson (Fig. 19.20) while working at DuPont in 1967. For this work Pedersen was co-awarded the 1987 Nobel Prize in Chemistry. Crown ethers are cyclic compounds composed of several ether groups. The most common crown ethers are oligomers of ethylene oxide with repeating units of (eCH 2 CH 2 Oe) n where n \u00bc 4 (tetramer), n \u00bc 5 (pentamer), or n \u00bc 6 (hexamer). Crown ethers are given structural names, X-crown-Y, where X is the total number of atoms in the ring and Y is the number of these atoms that are oxygen. Crown refers to the crown-like shape the molecule takes. Crown ether oxygens form complexes with specific cations that depend on the number of atoms in the ring. For example, 18-crown-6 ( Fig. 19.19 ) has high affinity for K \u00fe , 15-crown-5 for Na \u00fe , and 12-crown-4 for Li \u00fe . Like valinomycin, the exterior of the ring is hydrophobic, allowing crown ethers to dissolve in the membrane lipid bilayer while carrying the sequestered cation down its electrochemical gradient. It is now possible to tailor make crown ethers of different sizes that can encase a variety of catalysts for phase transfer into the bilayer hydrophobic interior where they can be used to catalyze reactions inside the membrane.",

Each channel in a gap junction is made up of 12 proteins called connexins. Six hexagonally arranged connexins are associated with each of the adjacent cell plasma membranes that the gap junction spans. Each set of six connexins is called a connexon and forms half of the gap junction channel. Therefore, one gap junction channel is composed of 2 aligned connexons and 12 connexins. Each connexin has a diameter of about 7 nm and the hollow center formed between the 6 connexins (the channel) is about 3 nm in diameter. Gap junctions allow adjacent cells to be in constant electrical and chemical communication with one another. Of particular importance is the rapid transmission of small second messengers, such as inositol triphosphate (IP 3 ) and Ca 2\u00fe .",

The invaginated pinocytosis vesicles are much smaller than those generated by phagocytosis. The vesicles eventually fuse with the lysosome whereupon the vesicle contents are digested. Pinocytosis involves a considerable investment of cellular energy in the form of ATP and so is many 1000 times less efficient than RME (see Chapter 17) . Also, in sharp contrast to RME, pinocytosis is nonspecific for the substances it accumulates.

Steady state composition of the plasma membrane results from a balance between endocytosis and exocytosis. The resultant process of plasma membrane recycling is amazingly fast. For example, pancreatic secretory cells recycles an amount of membrane equal to the whole surface of the cell in w90 min. Even faster are macrophages that can recycle contents of their plasma membrane in only 30 min.",

A biological membrane is semipermeable, being permeable to some molecules, most notably water (osmosis), while being very impermeable to most solutes that require some form of transporter. Passive diffusion (simple and facilitated) only requires the energy inherent in the solute's electrochemical gradient and results in its equilibrium across the membrane. In contrast, active transport requires additional energy (ie, ATP), and results in a nonequilibrium, net accumulation of the solute. Passive transport can involve simple diffusion or facilitated carriers including ionophores and channels. Active transport comes in many, often complex forms. Examples of active transport include primary active transport (uniport), secondary active transport (co-transport, antiport), and group translocation. Besides the multitude of transport systems, transport can be accomplished by gap junctions, receptor mediated endocytosis, phagocytosis, pinocytosis, exocytosis, and apoptotic membrane blebbing.",

Facilitated diffusion employs a specific transporter and exhibits MichaeliseMenten saturation kinetics.
