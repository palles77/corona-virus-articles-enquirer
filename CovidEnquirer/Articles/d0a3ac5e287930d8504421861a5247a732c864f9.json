TCM can be considered as a natural combinatorial chemical library, compared with synthetic ones. TCM presents more diversity in structure and bioactivity, and less toxicity [2] . Therefore, it represents an attractive source of new active compounds in drug discovery [3, 4] . The conventional approach to find active compounds in TCM involves selecting a potential plant and isolating compounds following bioassay guidance. This approach has been playing an important part in drug development. However, it is often time-consuming and can contain false positives (see Outstanding issues).",

Molecularly imprinted polymers are extensively cross-linked polymers containing specific recognition sites with a predetermined selectivity for analytes of interest. The technique involves complexation in a solution of target molecules (template) with functional monomers through either covalent or noncovalent bonds, followed by a polymerization reaction with an excess of cross-linkers. Removal of the templates leaves behind specific recognition sites that are complementary to the template in terms of its shape, size and functionality in the polymer network. These recognition sites enable imprinted polymers to be used as the mimics of enzymes, receptors and antibodies for screening various kinds of compounds from a mixture with abundant interferences.",

Although both methods have similarly advanced features in recognizing active compounds, the PcAb as a mimic of enzyme has less recognition ability than that of immobilized enzyme. When the immobilized enzyme is not available or not suitable for screening, PcAb can be used as an alternative method.",

MIP have proven to be feasible mimics in terms of physical robustness, resistance to elevated temperatures and pressures, and inertness towards acids, bases, metal ions and organic solvents, this material can be well employed in various kinds of samples including some biological and CADD, immobilized enzyme, PcAb and MIP are complementary and should be integrated to the multifaceted platform contributing to the early drug discovery process. At first, virtual screening is used to find potential active compounds. Then active fractional parts containing potential compounds are subjected to screening and separation of active compounds by MIP in one single step. We can also screen the active compounds firstly by using immobilized enzymes or PcAb, then separate active compounds using MIP. PcAb and MIP can be used to find substitutes of patent medicine, which are important yet expensive, from TCM.",

TCM is a complex system. It is time consuming and difficult to separate and identify all constituents. The reverse approach may be useful for finding active compounds immersed in interferences. Synergy is an important fundamental for the mechanism of TCM and involves multiple targets and pathways. Therefore, it is needed to develop approaches for synergy studies. The hit rates for virtual screening based on TCM database are corresponding higher than that from chemical database. The features of label free: operation; ability to rank ligands; break through volume being unrelated to ligand concentration (when c ( K d ); availability for multiple targets, make FAC-MS a very efficient approach for screening active compounds in TCM. But sometimes the conformation change should be considered in this process.",
