A regulatory agency-approved vaccine is not available, and existing prophylaxis and therapies are limited to use in high-risk pediatric patients; thus additional therapies are sorely needed. Here, we identify a series of benzimidazole analogs that inhibit hRSV infection in vitro with high potency, using a previously-reported high-throughput screening assay. The lead compound, SRI 29365 (1-[6-(2-furyl)[1,2,4]triazolo[3,4-b][1,3,4]thiadiazol-3-yl]methyl-1H-benzimidazo le), has an EC 50 of 66 lM and a selectivity >50. We identified additional compounds with varying potencies by testing commercially-available chemical analogs. Time-of-addition experiments indicated that SRI 29365 effectively inhibits viral replication only if present during the early stages of viral infection. We isolated a virus with resistance to SRI 29365 and identified mutations in the transmembrane domain of the viral G protein genomic sequence that suggested that the compound inhibits G-protein mediated attachment of hRSV to cells. Additional experiments with multiple cell types indicated that SRI 29365 antiviral activity correlates with the binding of cell surface heparin by full-length G protein. Lastly, SRI 29365 did not reduce hRSV titers or morbidity/mortality in efficacy studies using a cotton rat model. Although SRI 29365 and analogs inhibit hRSV replication in vitro, this work suggests that the G-protein may not be a valid drug target in vivo.",

These are NS1 and NS2, which inhibit type I interferon activity; N, which is the nucleocapsid protein; M, which encodes the matrix protein; and SH, G and F (fusion) proteins, which are incorporated into the viral coat. The G protein is a post-translationally glycosylated surface protein and also recognizes cell surface components (e.g., heparin) during viral attachment. The F protein mediates entry of the virus into the cell cytoplasm and also promotes the formation of syncytia. Typically, antibodies directed at the F protein are neutralizing because this protein is conserved in both subtypes of RSV, while the G protein varies in sequence considerably between hRSV A and B subtypes.

We identified and characterized a series of compounds that inhibit hRSV replication in vitro. We developed a mutant virus with resistance to the lead inhibitor compound, sequenced the mutant virus, and identified mutations in the N-terminus of the viral G protein that implicated the G protein as the target of compound inhibition. Further experiments with multiple cell lines (A549 and Vero E6) indicated that the lead compound was most effective in cell lines express a high percentage of full-length G protein and again suggested that the compound target was the viral G protein. However, in vivo studies with the lead compound did not reduce viral titers or extend the lives of cotton rats in a lethal hRSV challenge model. Our data suggest that, while targeting the function of G protein with small molecule inhibitors effectively inhibits hRSV replication in vitro, this strategy is cell type-dependent and may not be viable for therapeutic intervention in vivo.",

The endpoints of this study were demonstration of reduced virus titers in the lung lavage (3 mL) and nasal wash (2 mL) fluids of the treated infected cotton rats (ca. 100 g in weight) compared to vehicle-treated infected cotton rats. Virus quantification was done by plaque reduction assay. Serum samples were obtained at time of infection (T = 0) and at time of sacrifice in all 24 cotton rats. Body weight was recorded at end of experiment (day +4), and animal body weight and sex distribution was selected so as to be as similar as possible across all groups at the start. RSV/A/Tracy (passage three grown in HEp-2 cells), 1.35 \u00c2 10 5 PFU intranasally (100 lL) to cotton rats lightly anesthetized with isoflurane. Stock virus concentration was 1.35 \u00c2 10 6 PFU/mL. Compound SRI 29365 (140 mg, Chembridge, San Diego, CA) was supplied as dry powder and was diluted in 7 mL of PBS (20 mg/mL). The preparation was vortexed and sonicated in a water bath until the solution appeared clear. After 30 min of sonication the solution had the appearance of an emulsion. The emulsion was used for the IP injections. All aliquots were stored at 4\u00b0C. Dose volume was 2 mL/kg (0.2 mL/0.1 kg cotton rat). Plaque assays were performed using 24-well tissue cultures plates containing nearly confluent monolayers (20-40 \u00c2 10 4 cells/well) of HEp-2 cells prepared in 10% FBS 24 h prior to start of assay. At the start of each assay, dilutions (usually serial log 10 ) were made of the test samples. A 0.2 mL sample of each was added to wells in duplicate and allowed to adsorb for 90 min with occasional gentle agitation. After the inoculum was removed, the monolayers were overlayed with 0.75% methylcellulose in 2% FBS-MEM containing antibiotics, vitamins and other nutrients. Tissue culture and positive virus controls were included in each assay. The plates were placed in a 36\u00b0C, 5% CO 2 incubator. On day 7, plates were stained with 0.01% crystal violet/10% formalin solution (1.5 mL/well) and allowed to sit for 24-48 h at room temperature. Wells were rinsed with water, and the visible plaques were counted. All of the plaques in wells containing between 20 and 100 plaques were enumerated, averaged and the virus titers calculated as total log 10 PFU for nasal wash fluid or log 10 PFU/g of tissue for lungs. The lower limit of detection by this method is 0.70 log 10 total PFU or approximately 1.4 log 10 PFU/g of lung, respectively.",

Compound 1 had the greatest potency (lowest EC 50 and highest SI), indicating that a thiofuran at the R 2 position is more potent than when a furan (Compound 2, SRI-29365) is substituted.

Because the selectivity of the SRI 29365 is <100 (83), the compound-induced CC 50 is below the EC 50 value for the mutant virus.

The viral RNA in 1 mL of the amplified mutant virus culture was isolated and cDNA was reverse-transcribed using hRSV-specific primers.

            "text": "The viral G protein mediates virus attachment by binding heparin molecules that are expressed on the cell surface (Krusat and Streckert, 1997) , and requires full-length G protein to do so efficiently. It has been previously shown that the virus-associated expression of full-length G protein in cell culture is a factor of cell type (Kwilas et al., 2009) . Viral replication in HEp-2 cells results in expression of full-length G protein (90 kDa), whereas replication in A549 cells or Vero E6 cells results in the expression of a truncated G protein (45-55 kDa) that is missing the C-terminus. Replication of hRSV in HEp-2 cells is dependent on the binding of G protein to cell surface heparin glycosaminoglycans. However, replication in A549 cells or Vero cells produces hRSV that infects cells by a heparin-independent mechanism, most likely because the truncated G protein does not contain a fully functional heparin binding domain (Kwilas et al., 2009) . We used this cell-dependent difference in expressed G protein length to measure the antiviral efficacy of SRI 29365 in the three different cell types to determine if the compound was more effective against hRSV with full-length G protein. All three cell types were infected with the wild-type or the SRI 29365-resistant hRSV mutant in the presence of 5 lM SRI 29365, and the reduction in virus (TCID 50 reduction assay) was determined. Fig. 4 shows the compound-mediated reduction in viral titers for both wt and mutant virus in HEp-2, A549, and Vero E6 cells, relative to infected (-compound) controls. Against wt hRSV, the compound reduced virus TCID 50 values by 300-fold (P < 0.003), but only 10-fold (P < 0.0005) in A549 cells, and less than 10-fold (P < 0.00001) in Vero E6 cells. The antiviral activity of SRI 29365 against wt hRSV is cell-type specific and strongly correlates with the expression of full-length G protein, implicating the G protein as the compound target. Against the mutant hRSV, the compound reduced virus TCID 50 values by less than 10-fold in all cell types. Furthermore, in the presence of SRI 29365, a 2.0 log reduction in wt hRSV titer v. 0.5 log reduction in compound-resistant hRSV titer was observed in HEp-2 cells. However, SRI-29365 reduced titers of both viruses less than 0.5 log in Vero E6 cells, indicating that the compound has little effect on either wt or mutant virus titers when a truncated G protein is expressed. Fig. 1 . EC 50 and CC 50 plots for SRI 29365 in HEp-2 and A549 cells. EC 50 and CC 50 values were calculated for SRI 29365 against wt hRSV in either (A) HEp-2 cells or (B) A549 cells. In panel C, the concentration-dependent antiviral and cytotoxic responses were calculated for SRI 29365 against wt hRSV in HEp-2 cells. An eight point concentration dose response cytoprotection assay was performed (compound concentration range of 100-0.04 lg/mL) in the presence of hRSV-infected cells and the percent of cell viability (compared to uninfected, undrugged cell controls) was plotted v. test compound concentration (solid line). Each concentration point was performed in triplicate. In parallel, the same concentration range of test compound was added to uninfected cells to determine compound-induced cytotoxicity (dotted line). EC 50 /CC 50 values were converted to Log M (molar) concentrations (x-axis). Dose-response curves were plotted, and EC 50 values were calculated using IDBS' XLfit function 205 [y = A + ((B \u00c0 A)/(1 + ((C/x)^D)))] with minimum (A) and maximum (B) parameters set at 0 and 100 respectively. After a four-day incubation, cell viability was determined (compared to uninfected, undrugged cell controls) (n = 3). The graph shows the change in cell viability as the compound addition timepoint changes, and demonstrates that SRI 29365 did not reduce CPE more than 50% if added at 2 h post-infection.",

The in vitro pharmacokinetics of SRI 29365 have been partially investigated. Aqueous (media) solubility was determined (<400 uM) and aqueous stability half-life at 37\u00b0C was measured (>60 h in cell culture media), with a cLogP = 2.35. Because the compound was not completely soluble at the concentration used for the high dose, this may account for the lack of in vivo activity.

As a result, development of a vaccine has proceeded slowly and with great caution. Approved therapies for viral infections are ribavirin (Pelaez et al., 2009) , and the prophylactic humanized monoclonal antibody Synagis (Palivizumab), which is administered only to high risk pediatric patients and infected immunocompromised patients (Ridky, 2014) . Newer potential therapeutics are under investigation and reviewed elsewhere (Mackman et al., 2015; Olszewska and Openshaw, 2009; Wang et al., 2015) , but the fact that none of these have been approved by regulatory agencies (due to economics and clinical testing complexities) underscores the need for a renewed search for novel, effective, and safe antivirals that are effective against hRSV.",

The hRSV G protein, is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein and is the major hRSV attachment protein (Kauvar et al., 2010) . The role of the nominal attachment protein G is confined to facilitating infection in a non-species-specific manner, most probably by binding to cell surface glycosaminoglycans (Kauvar et al., 2010) . It contains a single hydrophobic region which serves as a signal peptide and also as a membrane anchor. The RSV G protein is also an important contributor to the disease process. A conserved CX3C chemokine like motif in G likely contributes to the pathogenesis of disease (Harcourt et al., 2006) . The G protein is evolutionarily conserved in all strains of RSV and has a central conserved cysteine noose region that contains a CX3C chemokine motif at amino acid positions 182-186 (Harcourt et al., 2006) . Through this motif G protein binds to CX3CR1 present on various immune cells and affects immune responses to hRSV, as has been shown in a mouse model of RSV infection. However, very little is known of the role of the RSV CX3C-CX3CR1 interactions in human disease. Reports suggest that the hRSV G protein CX3C motif impairs innate and adaptive human immune responses and may be important to vaccine and antiviral drug development. (Chirkova et al., 2013) . Lastly vaccination with this CX3C motif induces a protective immune response in mice (Jorquera et al., 2013) .",

            "text": "We identified a compound that inhibits viral replication by the putative mechanism of interfering with the function the viral G protein. Since G protein binds to cell surface heparin molecules during virus attachment, one possible mechanism of SRI 29365 action is inhibition of G protein-mediated heparin binding. We demonstrated that the antiviral efficacy of the test compound SRI 29365 against wt hRSV is significantly reduced in a cell type (i.e., Vero E6) that expresses a truncated G protein that is not dependent on heparin binding for infection. We also showed that, in the presence of SRI 29365, the phenotypes of the wt and mutant hRSVs are different in HEp-2 cells, but similar in Vero E6 cells, suggesting that the truncation of the G protein (and possibly the loss of the heparin-binding domain) is linked to compound mechanism of action. Although hRSV primarily infects cells through heparin binding domains on the G protein, mutant or knockout viruses lacking the G gene do still infect cells and replicate in vitro and in vivo presumably by attachment through redundant heparin binding domains on the F protein (Karron et al., 1997) . This observation was reciprocated by in vivo studies of SRI 29365, as SRI-29365 did not significantly reduce hRSV titers or pathology in a cotton rat infection model. Overall, this compound serves as an excellent in vitro inhibitor of hRSV replication, but it was not effective in vivo against RSVA strain Tracy. Since the A63 residue is conserved in both the RSVA Long and Tracy strains, it is expected that this compound would be effective against RSVA Tracy. The lack of in vivo confirmation of in vitro activity may be a result of compound formulation, or may be indicative that the viral G protein function is not a valid drug target for small molecule therapy. This might be due to the above stated observation that hRSV G protein knockout viruses still infect with sufficient efficacy to support robust virus replication. Lastly, residue A63 is not conserved in both A and B strains. In RSVB, residue 63 is an isoleucine, and it is unclear whether it would be susceptible to inhibition by SRI-29365 from the sequence alone.",
