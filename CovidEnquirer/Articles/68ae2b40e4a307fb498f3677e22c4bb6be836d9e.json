In this study, we found that PEDV infected not only the small intestines, but also the respiratory tract. Infection and replication of PEDV in the respiratory tract from naturally PEDV-infected piglets were examined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, immunohistochemistry, and virus re-isolation. Our observations were confirmed by experimental inoculation, and we found that PEDV infection in the respiratory tract was specifically associated with alveolar macrophages in the lung. Vero cell-adapted PEDV was able to replicate in both primary alveolar macrophages and continuous porcine alveolar macrophage cells. Sequencing analysis of the spike (S) glycoprotein revealed that mutations in S might be a potential determinant of auxiliary targets for PEDV. The discovery that PEDV infects and replicates in alveolar macrophages provides new insights into its pathogenesis.",

Most coronaviruses in farm animals cause respiratory or gastrointestinal tract infections in young animals, resulting in huge economic losses (Saif, 2004a,b; Stoddart et al., 1988; Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005) . Several viruses in the family coronaviridae infect pigs, including transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV), porcine hemagglutinating encephalitis virus, and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (Cartwright et al., 1969; Greig et al., 1962) . TGEV mainly infects epithelial cells in the small intestine and causes fatal enteritis in piglets (Enjuanes et al., 1995) . Additionally, TGEV replicates in porcine respiratory tract tissues but does not induce primary respiratory disease (Kemeny et al., 1975; Saif, 2004a,b) . PRCoV, a spontaneously occurring variant of TGEV, replicates more extensively in the respiratory tract without causing clinical signs (Wesley et al., 1991) . It has been reported that PRCoV replicates in different types of lung cells, including alveolar, bronchiolar and bronchial epithelial cells and in bronchoalveolar macrophages, but not in enterocytes (Cox et al., 1990) .",

            "text": "PEDV is one of the major etiological agents of seasonal acute diarrhea in piglets (Debouck and Pensaert, 1980) . The pathology following PEDV infection resembles that of TGEV, which is mainly characterized by acute watery diarrhea and dehydration in suckling piglets (Hess et al., 1980; Pensaert et al., 1981; Takahashi et al., 1983) . Based on these symptoms, the enterocytes have largely been thought of as the target cells of PEDV infection. Indeed, experimental infection with the prototype strain CV777 showed that replication in epithelial cells covering small and large intestinal villi resulted in villous atrophy, malabsorption and diarrhea (Debouck and Pensaert, 1980) . Similarly, Korean strains of PEDV caused severe villous atrophy in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum of experimentally infected pigs Chae, 2000, 2003) . Replication was mainly localized in the cytoplasm of villous epithelial cells of the small intestine and colon (Sueyoshi et al., 1995) . Microscopically, marked cytoplasmic vacuolation and exfoliation of enterocytes with subsequent considerable shortening and fusion of villi were observed (Coussement et al., 1982; Pospischil et al., 1981) . However, according to immunohistochemistry (IHC) results reported by Lee et al., PEDV antigens were detected not only in the cytoplasm of the villous enterocytes but also in macrophages that had infiltrated the lamina propria (Lee et al., 2000) . PEDV infection in macrophages may reflect the possibility of widespread pathology or the presence of extra-gastrointestinal infection and replication, as observed in other species infected with coronaviruses (Gu et al., 2005) . Most recent studies on the pathogenesis of PEDV have been limited to partial autopsies of the gastrointestinal tract. Therefore, a comprehensive approach to identify pathogenesis in different organs or cell types was needed.",

To evaluate which organs are affected by natural wildtype PEDV infection, we collected various organs (lungs, livers, kidneys, and spleens) including the small intestines and confirmed PEDV by RT-PCR. Surprisingly, PEDV infection was detected not only in the small intestine, but also in the lung, liver, and kidney from one of the four piglets we tested (Table 1) . To evaluate tissue damage, we stained sections with hematoxylin and eosin, and to detect PEDV antigens we performed IHC on these tissue samples. As shown in Fig. 1A , severe histopathological changes were observed in the small intestine, including villous atrophy, extensive vacuolation, and flattening of the villous enterocytes. Since the small intestines were severely damaged, most PEDV-positive cells were already detached and found in the lumen while PEDV was detected in a few enterocytes in the intestinal villi (Fig. 1F) . Interestingly, PEDV was also detected in lung tissue by IHC, mostly in the mixed gland and epithelial cells, but not in the alveolar respiratory bronchiole (Fig. 1G ). Despite this, we were unable to find significant pathological changes in the lung ( Fig. 1B and G) . Samples from the liver, kidney, and spleen were negative for PEDV as evaluated by IHC, and we were unable to find significant pathological changes ( Fig. 1C , D, E, H, I, and J).

We still do not know which mutation(s) are involved in changes in tropism. However, further examination is required to confirm this hypothesis.",

Until now, PEDV replication has not been reported in cells other than those of the intestinal tract, with the exception of a few studies that have reported PEDV infection in macrophages as well as enterocytes from the gastrointestinal tract (Lee et al., 2000) . Here, we evaluated the pathogenicity of new wild-type PEDV in comparison with Vero cell-adapted KPEDV-9. We found that new wild-type PEDV, but not Vero cell adapted KPEDV-9 strain, can infect not only small intestines but also the respiratory tract, especially porcine alveolar macrophages. We are not so sure whether all the new PEDV wild type has same activity or not and this findings could be limited to this specific isolate. Further studies required with other isolates, but there is big limitation on new isolation. Genetic analyses suggest that the extra-intestinal tropism of wild-type PEDV might be obtained by natural mutations on PEDV S.",

In piglets naturally infected with wild-type PEDV, we observed that PEDV is able to infect not only in the small intestine but also other organs, including the lung. We further investigated this observation in piglets, which were experimentally inoculated with infected tissue homogenates and compared with piglets inoculated with Vero cell-adapted KPEDV-9. As with the piglets that were naturally infected with wild-type PEDV, the virus was detected in both small intestines and lungs of experimentally inoculated animals. Additionally, we found that lung infection of PEDV was associated with alveolar macrophages. These results indicate that PEDV replication in the lungs might be related to increased cellularity and partially owing to infiltration of macrophages into the alveolar and interalveolar septa.",

We found that both primary porcine alveolar macrophages and 3D4 cells were susceptible to PEDV and able to support PEDV replication. However, growth of Vero cell-adapted PEDV in 3D4 cells was relatively slow and inefficient compared with its growth in Vero cells. It is not clear why PEDV was unable to replicate as successfully in 3D4 cells as it does in Vero cells. Our sequencing results indicate that wild-type PEDV has differences in the N-terminal domain of its S protein sequences compared with other reference and Vero cell-adapted strains of PEDV. We propose that the changes in amino acids in the N-terminal domain may be involved in the observed tropism changes, and thus Vero cell-adapted PEDV strains may have lost their ability to infect alveolar macrophages. Similarly, PRCoV, a deletion mutant of TGEV with deletion of nucleotides 621-681 in the S gene, is non-enteropathogenic and has a tropism for respiratory epithelium and alveolar macrophages (Sanchez et al., 1999) . Although the growth curves and titers were different in 3D4 cells from those produced by infected Vero cells, the fact that the virus was able to grow at all suggests that macrophages may The susceptibility of porcine primary alveolar macrophages to PEDV. Primary alveolar macrophages were collected and infected with Vero cell-adapted strains of PEDV and then virus infectivity was evaluated by RT-PCR. (C) Viral growth kinetics in alveolar macrophage cell line. Vero and 3D4 cells were inoculated with KPEDV9 and progeny viruses were titrated at the indicated time points. Vero (black circles) and 3D4 (white circles) cells were inoculated with Vero cell-adapted strains of PEDV and progeny viruses were titrated at the indicated time points. In Vero cells, the amount of KPEDV-9 increased continuously and gradually until reaching a titer of 10 7 TCID50 around 48 hpi, which slowly reduced afterwards. In 3D4 cells, the titer of KPEDV-9 increased slightly, reaching 10 3.4 TCID50 by 24 hpi. The titer was slowly decreased by 48 hpi, and we were unable to detect any infectious viruses after 48 hpi. (D) Vero and 3D4 cells were inoculated with Vero cell adapted PEDVs (KPEDV9 or SM98LVec) in supplemented with 10 g/ml trypsin as indicated, and the cells were stained with mouse polyclonal anti-PEDV at 24 h after infection. Scale bar = 100 m. A reduced infection in 3D4 cells was also supported by the results of an immunofluorescence assay. The percentage of PEDV-infected cells was lower in 3D4 cells than in Vero cells. We also compared CPE formation with trypsin condition. 6 . Phylogenetic analysis based on the amino acid sequences. The phylogenetic tree was generated using the Clustal W method following multiple alignments of amino acid sequences. Putatively similar regions of spike proteins of other distantly related coronaviruses were also included in this tree. The numbers represent bootstrap values greater than 50% of 1000 replicates.

It seems likely that the ability to induce pathogenesis might be largely dependent on the ability of the S protein to mediate entry into target cells. The inefficient infection in alveolar macrophages also suggests the possibility of a persistent infection or presence of PEDV in pig farms. The same farms experienced repeated outbreaks and some farms were found to be positive for PEDV infection most of the time. Based on our findings, we hypothesize that alveolar macrophages may be susceptible to PEDV although they are probably not a primary replication site. Perhaps, when protective antibodies are generated by vaccination or infection, PEDV might escape into alveolar macrophages. As such, these cells might make a good target for persistence. We found many sows tested that confirmed positive for PEDV, as measured by RT-PCR of their lung samples, although they have never shown any of clinical signs of infection (personal observations). We also found many PEDV-positive cases from dayold piglet samples, as measured by RT-PCR. We can only explain these positive results from day-old piglet samples if the infection spread from sows during pregnancy or delivery. In summary, we hypothesize that alveolar macrophages are not the primary target or a common replication site for PEDV, but they are likely important for its survival and pathogenesis.",

However, further studies are still required to fully understand the mechanism of PEDV infection since our findings conflict with the previous understanding of PEDV replication sites and pathogenesis. Although we found some variations in sequence with other isolates, it remains unknown exactly where and what the critical factors are which cause these changes in its pathogenesis.
