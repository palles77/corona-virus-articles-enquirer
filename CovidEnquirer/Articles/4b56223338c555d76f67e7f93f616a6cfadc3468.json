            "text": "Objective: Fenestrated and branched endovascular devices are increasingly used for complex aortic diseases, and despite the challenging nature of these procedures, early experiences from pioneering centers have been encouraging. The objectives of this retrospective study were to report our experience of intraoperative adverse events (IOAEs) during fenestrated and branched stent grafting and to analyze the impact on clinical outcomes. Methods: Consecutive patients treated with fenestrated and branched stent grafting in a tertiary vascular center between February 2006 and October 2013 were evaluated. A prospectively maintained computerized database was scrutinized and updated retrospectively. Intraoperative angiograms were reviewed to identify IOAEs, and adverse events were categorized into three types: target vessel cannulation, positioning of graft components, and intraoperative access. Clinical consequences of IOAEs were analyzed to ascertain whether they were responsible for death or moderate to severe postoperative complications. Results: During the study period, 113 consecutive elective patients underwent fenestrated or branched stent grafting. Indications for treatment were asymptomatic complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (CAAAs, n [ 89) and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs, n [ 24). Stent grafts included fenestrated (n [ 79) and branched (n [ 17) Cook stent grafts (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind), Ventana (Endologix, Irvine, Calif) stent grafts (n [ 9), and fenestrated Anaconda (Vascutek Terumo, Scotland, UK) stent grafts (n [ 8). In-hospital mortality rates for the CAAA and TAAA groups were 6.7% (6 of 89) and 12.5% (3 of 24), respectively. Twenty-eight moderate to severe complications occurred in 21 patients (18.6%). Spinal cord ischemia was recorded in six patients, three of which resolved completely. A total of 37 IOAEs were recorded in 34 (30.1%) patients (22 CAAAs and 12 TAAAs). Of 37 IOAEs, 15 (40.5%) resulted in no clinical consequence in 15 patients; 17 (45.9%) were responsible for moderate to severe complications in 16 patients, and five (13.5%) led to death in four patients. The composite end point death/nonfatal moderate to severe complication occurred more frequently in patients with IOAEs compared with patients without IOAEs (20 of 34 vs 12 of 79; P < .0001). Conclusions: In this contemporary series, IOAEs were relatively frequent during branched or fenestrated stenting procedures and were often responsible for significant complications.

            "text": "Impact of intraoperative adverse events during branched and fenestrated aortic stent grafting on postoperative outcome Fenestrated and branched endovascular aneurysm repairs (FEVAR and BEVAR) have become an attractive alternative to open repair for complex abdominal aortic aneurysms (CAAAs) and thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs). In many countries, these complex procedures are still under evaluation and generally available only in tertiary centers. In France, fenestrated and branched Cook devices have been approved for reimbursement from the national health care system. However, intraoperative difficulties and complications are not rare. 1 Safe target vessel cannulation and stenting is a concern, particularly in the presence of stenotic ostial lesions and small or angulated target vessels. Malpositioning of stent graft components can also have devastating consequences. As delivery devices are larger than in standard infrarenal endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) and the procedure duration is generally longer, patients are more prone to access complications. The real incidence of those intraoperative adverse events (IOAEs) and their impact on the postoperative course are poorly documented.",

The reported 30-day mortality was 1.4%, and the incidence of permanent renal dialysis was 1.4%. Data from national registries and from high-volume centers have provided similar results, with 30-day mortality rates varying from 2% to 4%. 13, 14, 17 In expert hands, endovascular repair of TAAA with FEVAR or BEVAR has been associated with encouraging short-term results, with 30-day mortality ranging from 5% to 12% and spinal cord ischemia from 3% to 17%. 4, 12, [18] [19] [20] ",

Several reasons might explain this observation. In contrast with pioneering series, in which one physician performed the majority of the cases, two vascular surgeons in our institution performed fenestrated and branched procedures as the first operator, although a highly experienced interventional radiologist (H.K.) was present during almost all procedures. This, combined with the fact that three different types of device were used, might have contributed to IOAEs in some patients. However, more than a simple learning curve of technical skills, one could argue that our results are mainly due to suboptimal patient selection. On review of the mortalities in this series, all patients had challenging aneurysm morphology or significant comorbidity (American Society of Anesthesiologists class 4). Four patients had \"shaggy\" aortas with floating thrombus, resulting in fatal embolic complications. As FEVAR and BEVAR are being increasingly used and disseminated, the results of our initial experience confirm that they remain complex procedures that need to be centralized in highvolume centers. They also raise the question of whether encouraging results of initial series can be reproduced in the \"real world,\" knowing these series came from a very few pioneering expert centers and included highly selected patients.",

Even if most of them could be rescued with additional bailout endovascular maneuvers and without permanent damaging consequences for the patient (Table VI) , they are considered avoidable. Thrombus formation in the long 7F sheaths may also have been avoided by more frequent flushing. Cannulation failure was relatively rare (n \u00bc 4) but had devastating consequences for the patient, leading directly or indirectly to severe complications or death (Table VI) . This was mainly due to sizing errors, malpositioning of the fenestrated component, or difficult anatomy and occurred predominantly at the beginning of our experience.",

The patient subsequently died of meningoencephalitis after spinal drain placement for paraplegia, although the use of sac perfusion branches to reduce paraplegia risk remains controversial. With the exception of one endovascular reintervention, all remaining IOAEs relating to graft malpositioning were managed successfully without harm to the patient.",

Caution should be taken in interpreting the results of this series as the definition of CAAA is broad, including short neck, juxtarenal, pararenal, and suprarenal aneurysms. Consequently, there was considerable heterogeneity in complexity of aneurysm morphology and difficulty of procedures, which varied from stents with two fenestrations to challenging branched stent grafting for type II TAAAs in high-risk patients. Despite these limits, this study suggests that in routine practice, technical difficulties and IOAEs during FEVAR and BEVAR procedures are not rare, particularly with difficult aneurysm morphology. It is likely that continuous improvements in endovascular and imaging technologies will improve the safety of complex endovascular aortic procedures. Development of lower profile stent grafts and bridging stents, with better visibility and repositionability, will probably play a key role in reducing IOAEs. New tools for improved catheter navigation, such as robotic navigation, 21 may also facilitate target vessel cannulation. Although few data exist, fusion of images may be useful to reduce doses of contrast material and radiation. 22 ",

IOAEs occurred in 22 of 89 (25%) CAAA patients compared with 12 of 24 (50%) TAAA patients (P \u00bc .02, c 2 test). IOAEs occurred in 24 of 96 patients (25%) who underwent a fenestrated stent graft compared with 10 of 17 patients (58.9%) who underwent a branched stent graft (P \u00bc .005, c 2 test). In both those groups, difficulty with target vessel cannulation (type 1 IOAE) was the most frequent",

            "text": "The report by Dr Cochennec highlights some very significant issues related to the practice and dissemination of complex aortic procedures.The authors present 113 cases performed during a period of 7 years, which equates to fewer than 20 cases per annum divided among four operators using three endovascular devices. Previous studies have shown a link between surgeon as well as center volumes and outcomes. 1 Complex aneurysms represent a small proportion of all aneurysms treated, and it is difficult, even in large vascular centers, to achieve volumes large enough to reap the benefits of truly high volumes. In contrast to \"simpler\" aortic procedures, treatment of complex aneurysms is not only a question of individual operator experience and skill, but it places significant demands on the supporting structure of the center.Preoperative planning of complex cases is paramount for success. Detailed anatomic analysis as well as extensive specific device knowledge is needed. The learning curve is significantly longer than for infrarenal endovascular aneurysm repair. This indicates that it is better to use a single device and to learn it well rather than to stray between different devices, trying to take advantage of individual stent graft benefits.Certain morphologic features need to be specifically addressed. (1) A \"shaggy\" aorta is a risk factor for embolic events and poor outcome. 2 (2) Poor access can lead to difficulties in orienting the device, leading to target vessel loss, resulting in end-organ dysfunction. Very long procedures can lead to compartment syndrome as well as a systemic reperfusion injury causing severe physiologic instability and multiorgan failure in the immediate postoperative phase. 3 Patients with complex aneurysmal disease often carry significant comorbidities and generally have a much lower tolerance for perioperative and postoperative complications, which is clearly seen in the current study with significant morbidity and mortality. This furthermore emphasizes the need for appropriate patient selection, workup, and optimization before surgery as well as extensive involvement of anesthetic and intensive care expertise in the preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative period. This can most likely be achieved only in very select high-volume centers dedicated to treatment of complex aortic disease.I thank the authors for their honest reporting and for highlighting the issues in dealing with complex endovascular aortic procedures.",
