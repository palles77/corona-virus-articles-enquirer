However, the current methods are limited to antigen detection by conjugating IgG antibodies on S. aureus nanoparticles. In this study, a simple way to conjugate antigens to the S. aureus nanobioparticles was developed by utilizing a cell wall binding domain (CBD) from a bacteriophage lysin PlyV12. Based on this novel design, simple agglutination tests of the IgG antibodies of Ebola virus (EBOV) nucleoprotein (NP) and Middle East Respiratory Virus (MERS) NP in rabbit sera were successfully developed by conjugating the S. aureus nanobioparticles with two fusion proteins EBOV NP-CBD and MERS NP-CBD, respectively. The conjugation was done easily by just mixing the fusion proteins with the S. aureus nanoparticles. The detection time was within 20 min without any special equipment or expertise. As far as we know, this is the first time to realize the detection of viral antibodies based on S. aureus nanoparticles.",

            "text": "In recent years, as an emerging field in bio-nanotechnology, the synthesis of nanomaterials by living organisms, such as yeast, fungi and bacteria, have demonstrated great potential for different applications [1, 2] . Among bacteria, protein A producing S. aureus has been an attractive vector for immunoassays of pathogens, especially for coagglutination tests of bacteria and viruses [3] , because it is easy to conjugate IgG antibodies through protein A molecules on the surface of S. aureus cells. On the same time, biosynthesis of nanoparticles inside S. aureus cells could be exploited to enhance detection sensitivity. For example, biosynthesis of quantum dots inside S. aureus cells has been used for sensitive detection of H9N2 virus [2] . In our lab, we established a simple way to transform S. aureus into red and fluorescent nanobioprobes by reacting with a monotetrazolium redox dye, 5-cyano-2, 3-ditolyl tetrazolium chloride (CTC) at room temperature [4] . Comparing with the uncolored S. aureus nanobioprobes, 100 fold higher sensitivity was achieved in rapid coagglutination test of E. coli O157:H7 with the novel red nanobioprobes.",

In general, virus-specific antibodies IgM or IgG with rising titers constitute a strong presumptive detection. Therefore, detection of IgM or IgG antibodies in blood are used commonly in epidemic investigation of viral infections [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Some diagnostic methods, such as Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [9] [10] [11] 15] , indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) [16] [17] [18] neutralization test [12, 19, 20] and protein microarray [21] , have been developed for EBOV and MERS-CoV antibody detection. However, the requirement of dedicated instruments limits the application of these assays in field, which is important for fast responses during epidemics. In comparison, agglutination test is more rapid, inexpensive, simple to interpret, and most importantly requires no specialized instrument since naked eyes could read the results [3] . Therefore, agglutination test might be a good choice for EBOV or MERS-CoV antibody detection in field. In our agglutination test, the conjugation is quite simple and could be done easily by just mixing the fusion proteins with the S. aureus nanoparticles.

Then purified monoclonal antibody (clone 4B4) and polyclonal rabbit antiserum diluted in series 2 fold from 1:10 to 1:81920 with PBS containing 1% BSA were added into the wells and incubated with the coated NP antigen for 30 min at 37 \u2022 C, respectively.

Compared with the previous agglutination tests based on latex particles for the detection of IgG antibodies, there are a few advantages using the present method. First, physical adsorption or chemical cross-linking is normally used to sensitize the latex particles with antigens. The antigen molecules are randomly immobilized on the surface of latex particles, which could affect the subsequent antigen-antibody binding reaction. In the current method, the antigen molecules were immobilized on the S. aureus particles via the CBD fused with them, which can make sure that all the antigen molecules have a good orientation to react with the antibody. Therefore, the current method could provide better control of the antigen activity than the previous methods for detection of antibodies.",

However, in the current method, no such competition exists since most of the IgG moleucles could bind to protein A on the surface of one staphylococcal particle via their Fc fragments, and bind to the antigen molecules on another particle via their Fab to form agglutination ( Fig. 1 and Fig. 5 ). This new agglutination mode could lead to higher detection sensitivity in theory. Actually as far as we know, this is the first time that the S. aureus nanoparticles have been used in agglutination test for the detection of antibodies.",

Lysins, produced by bacteriophages to digest the bacterial cell wall for the release of progeny virions, have been considered effective anti-infective agents for control of Gram-positive bacteria [22] . Normally at the C terminus of a lysin there is a cell wall binding domain (CBD) which can specifically attach to the host cell with a high affinity. In the current study, a CBD from a phage lysin PlyV12 was utilized for conjugation of the antigen by a simple mixing and incubation step. The successful sensitization of the S. aureus nanoparticles with EBOV NP and MERS NP indicated that this strategy via CBD might be used widely for other antigens. Fig. 5 showed that there was no non-specific agglutination caused by HCV positive sera or the suspected influenza virus serum, demonstrating good selectivity of our method. The sensitivities of the antibody agglutination tests are lower than that of ELISA. The highest dilution of the monoclonal antibody and the polyclonal rabbit antiserum antibody against EBOV subtype Zaire NP were 1:800 and 1:1280, respectively, at which agglutination could be clearly seen in 10 min (Fig. 4) , while the antibody titers of the antibody and the polyclonal rabbit antiserum tested by ELISA were 1:20480 and 1:81920, respectively. However, due to their simplicity, rapidness, good stability and no needs of instrument to read results, the antibody agglutination tests based on the multifunctional S. aureus nanobioprobes could have good potential for real applications in field.",
