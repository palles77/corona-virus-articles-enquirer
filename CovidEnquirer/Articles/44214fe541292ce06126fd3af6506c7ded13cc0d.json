Aside from its high mortality rate, avian influenza is monitored closely for a pandemic because Influenza A type viruses can evolve rapidly and jump between species. The viruses evolve through evolutionary mechanisms such as drift and shift. Drift involves small, gradual changes to surface proteins while shift involves abrupt major changes to the influenza virus. Shift evolution occurs through reassortment, the mixing of two influenza viruses (e.g., avian influenza and human influenza) into a new strain that carries properties from both strains. Shift typically occurs when a patient gets infected with both strains of the influenza virus. Recent outbreaks in China show that shift evolution can occur at any time with potentially deadly effects.",

Of great concern is the fact that once pandemic avian influenza surfaces, it will spread globally in no time at all because the world is connected via air travel.",

Spatial effects regarding disease spread can be modeled by diffusion or dispersal models. In a diffusion model, the movements of infected individuals are instantaneous and the disease spreads immediately to neighboring areas. On the other hand, in a dispersal model, the movements of individuals are discrete and usually occur between so-called patches connected by dispersion. Dispersal models are more appropriate when considering travel over long distances. Thus, a two-city dispersal model is developed to predict the spread of avian influenza from Asia and Australia to major U. S. cities via air travel. Real air travel data is used to model the disease spread by individuals who are susceptible to or are infected with pandemic avian influenza. The two-city model helps identify the most effective intervention strategies at the origin and destination cities as well as help quantify the effectiveness of control measures that should applied to reduce the morbidity and mortality of a pandemic. This can provide valuable guidance to public health officials and policy-makers as they decide how, where and when to target pandemic influenza intervention strategies while efficiently using the available resources.",

Early mathematical models that investigate the impact of a hypothetical pandemic have focused only on humans [1, 4, 5, 10, 13] . At this time, the avian influenza virus can only be transmitted from birds to humans; it is not yet capable of sustained human-to-human transmission. Most of the human cases reported to the WHO were due to close contact between humans and domestic birds. Recent mathematical models capture the bird-to-human transmission pathway of avian influenza [6] [7] [8] [9] . The simplest bird-tohuman model was introduced by Iwami et al. [7] ; this model is the starting point for the single-city model presented in this paper. The notation used in our model is different, but the two models are equivalent. In our single-city model, the domestic bird population is divided into two non-intersecting classes: susceptible domestic birds denoted by S d (t) and infected domestic birds denoted by I d (t). The natural birth rate of the bird population is expressed by \u039b d . Susceptible birds have a natural death rate \u03bc d while infected birds die at the rate \u03bc d \u00fe \u03bd d , where the additional death rate \u03bd d is induced by HPAI.",

In the following, we take City 1 to be Tokyo and City 2 to be a city in the United States, where the transmission rate of pandemic avian influenza in both cities is \u03b2 p \u00bc 3 \u00c2 10 \u00c0 5 . When there is no travel between the two cities, we obtain the same reproduction numbers for each city as when the reproduction numbers are computed for each city in isolation: when k 2 is fixed and k 1 increases,R 1 0 decreases. The same is true for the reproduction number for City 2R 2 0 (see Fig. 21 ). According to Theorem 1, if the reproduction numbers for the cities are greater than one, then the disease will always persist. For example, the reproduction numbers for two cities areR 1 0 \u00bc 1:40 andR 2 0 \u00bc 8:87 when HPAI is in the endemic state in the bird population (current state). This scenario is illustrated in Fig. 22(a) , where the higher reproduction number leads to higher prevalence of the disease. In a situation where the reproduction number is greater than one in one city and less than one in another city, then the disease still persists in both cities (see Fig. 22(b) ).",

When the two cities are connected, but the travel rate from City 1 is assumed to be zero (i.e., k 1 \u00bc 0 and k 2 40), then the elasticity ER increases as k 2 increases and decreases as k 1 increases. As Fig. 24(a) suggests, control measures focused on reducing the infectious period are a waste of time and money if the travel rate out of City 1 is high and the travel rate into City 1 is low.

Data obtained from the U.S. Department of Transportation and WHO were used to estimate fixed model parameters such as the travel rate, birth rate and natural death rate. Model parameters such as transmission rates and hypothetical pandemic death rates were obtained or estimated from fitted values in the literature. The reproduction numbers computed for the bird and human populations (r 0 and R 0 ) are important threshold values. If either r 0 41 or R 0 41, then the disease-free equilibrium is unstable, meaning the disease will continue to persist within the populations. In all the cases considered, although the computed R 0 values are small (10 \u00c0 2 or less), the r 0 value is 1.06, which suggests that the DFE is unstable; this agrees with the numerical simulation results.",

The results show that culling, which increases the natural death rate of birds and significantly affects the r 0 value, is the most effective control measure that can be applied to poultry. Additionally, control measures such as isolation, quarantine and vaccination should be applied to the human population to reduce pandemic prevalence. Isolation and quarantine decrease the transmission rate, while vaccination affects the transmission rate as well as the infectious period. The effectiveness of the control measures, however, depends strongly on the air travel rate. For instance, if the travel rate out of a city is large (i.e., greater than 0.2), then isolating and quarantining infected and susceptible individuals are not very effective at reducing pandemic prevalence.",

When cities are not connected, the elasticities of the reproduction numbers with respect to recruitment rates are constant (i.e., equal to one). However, when the cities are connected, the elasticities are strongly impacted by air travel. Specifically, when the travel rates are positive, the reproduction number for the origin city is very sensitive to changes in destination city recruitment rate, and vice versa. Generally, the effects of air travel on the elasticities are different for the origin city and destination city. However, upon examining the effect of the induced pandemic death rate, we discovered that when the travel rate out of an origin city is small, vaccination and other similar control measures in the origin city are ineffective, but vaccination in the destination city is much more effective. Thus, combining disease control measures and restricting travel to the appropriate cities is a promising strategy for eradicating pandemic avian influenza.",
