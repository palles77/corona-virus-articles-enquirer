Once posted, changes to the schedule require voluntary participation by the nurses, making it difficult for hospitals to respond to changes in nursing needs and availability of nurses. At the same time, nursing needs' forecasts developed several weeks in advance are often wrong. In each hospital setting, there may exist several promising strategies to enhance scheduling flexibility and reduce the mismatch between the nursing needs and the availability of nurses. However, methodologies to evaluate such strategies, before testing them in expensive pilot implementation, do not exist. We demonstrate how such evaluations can be carried out using historical data. Furthermore, we demonstrate the use of our approach by evaluating the benefits of a strategy where nurses are divided into two cohorts and schedules are phase shifted for the two cohorts. Staggering schedules allows nursing unit managers to benefit from more frequent updating of needs' assessments without having to change work rules. Upon applying our approach to data from a large urban hospital, we discovered that in this example staggering did not improve the performance of nurse schedules. We discuss possible reasons for this result, its implications for hospital managers, and other potential uses of our approach.",

For example, telemetry units house patients under observation or those awaiting a surgical procedure, medical/surgical (med/surg) units house patients who are either recovering after a surgery or have a medical need requiring hospitalization, maternity units house new mothers and babies, and so on. This allows hospitals to have specialized equipment and nursing staff to care for patients with different care needs. Most nurses are assigned to specific units, although there are some that belong to a float pool-i.e., they serve in different units depending on the mon, which necessitates considerable effort by managers to avoid understaffing in some shifts and overstaffing in others.",

This survey reveals one of the key reasons for avoiding understaffing from the nurses' viewpoint. Equally important is the consideration that inadequate staffing relative to the workload is unsafe for patients, being associated with increased instances of hospital-related mortality and failure to rescue [25, 3, 15] . Nursing unit managers deal with understaffing by using overtime or temporary staff, both of which are costly options for hospitals.",

However, these measures can strain relations between the nursing staff and the hospital management.",

Shortening the lengths of the review period and the lead time may help, but such changes are infrequent and perceived to be difficult to realize owing to provisions in nurses' contracts. Hospitals can eliminate specialized nursing units, but that can affect quality of care and lead to lower staff morale [6, 24] . Furthermore, general-purpose units exacerbate the nurse staffing problem because the care needs of the patients are more variable. These arguments suggest that for any new strategy or change in policy that is proposed to improve a nursing unit's ability to meet patient-care needs, it is necessary to have a methodology to evaluate its costs and benefits and to subsequently test those strategies/policies that perform well via pilot implementation studies. We report the first step in this process in which we develop a suite of models that can be used to evaluate a variety of flexibility enhancing strategies.",

In particular, we study an instance of staggering with two cohorts-i.e. we divide the nurses assigned to a unit into two cohorts and schedule each cohort with a phase difference. If, for example, the review period is 4 weeks and the lead time is 6 weeks, we develop a schedule for each cohort that is phase shifted by 2 weeks. Each cohort still obtains its schedule every 4 weeks, which is set 6 weeks in advance, but the start of these 4-week periods for the two groups is offset by 2 weeks. A schematic of the staggering strategy is shown in Fig. 1 . (In this figure and throughout the remainder of this paper, the review period is denoted by the Greek letter .) Clearly, variants of this approach with more than two cohorts are possible. However, the complexity of the evaluation as well as the complexity of the implementation can be significantly higher with more cohorts.",

We begin with the forecasting literature first. There are many aggregate-level (regional or national) nursing demand forecasting models. A summary of available approaches can be found in O'Brien-Pallas et al. [21] . Aggregate nursing demand forecasting approaches are not suitable for scheduling decisions at the level of a single unit, which require forecasts of medium-term nursing needs. Therefore, in this paper, we focus only on articles that are concerned with forecasts of nursing needs at the nursingunit level over a 4-to 6-week time horizon.",

            "text": "C\u00f4t\u00e9 and Tucker [11] describe four common hospitallevel nursing needs' forecasting methods. These are percent adjustment, moving average, trendline, and seasonalized forecasts. The percent-adjustment method is based on the percentage increase or decrease in the past twelve months of historical nurse requirements-if there is \u00b1x% change the previous year, then it is estimated that the nursing needs will change by \u00b1x% in the following year as well. Trendline methods use linear regression on historical nurse requirements, with time as the explanatory variable, to determine if a trend exists. Both percent adjustment and trendline methods ignore possible seasonalities in nursing requirements. Moving average and seasonalized forecasts are common time-series based models. Moving average can work well when neither the seasonal nor the trend pattern is strong. Seasonalized forecast (with or without trend) is appropriate when repeating patterns are identified in the historical data. The forecast in each season is adjusted by the corresponding seasonal index. These approaches are widely used and discussed in many books; see, for example, Shumway and Stoffer [22] . Kao and Tung [17] studied the use of Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) time-series models for predicting nurse requirements for inpatient services in a large public health care system. Their monthly nursing requirements forecasting model can help a hospital choose the right level of aggregate capacity but it does not provide information on daily or shift-level nurse requirement fluctuations. Wood [26] used an ARIMA model to forecast shorter term (1-day-ahead) requirements. Earnest et al. [12] also used ARIMA models to predict the number of occupied beds during a SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) outbreak in a tertiary hospital in Singapore.",

However, this model does not take into account the amount of work created by patient movements such as admissions, discharges and transfers in/out (ADT).

In contrast, rescheduling utilizes the ability to react to the differences between scheduled and required staffing levels. Clearly, schedule staggering can be used in combination with rescheduling approaches to help unit managers respond to uncertainty in staffing needs and staff availability. To the best of our knowledge, no previous study has either proposed or evaluated this staggering approach. Moreover, forecasting and scheduling are typically treated as two separate problems. No study has evaluated the overall performance of schedules when forecast errors as well as scheduling inefficiencies are simultaneously present.

Furthermore, as explained next, it may be difficult to include historical patient-specific data in forecasts of nursing needs. Typical nursing units have a variable staffing plan that converts each census level (by time of day) into a minimum number of registered nurses (RNs) needed to care for that many patients. The variable staffing plan is approximately based on nurse to patient ratios corresponding to an aggregate mix of patient acuity. We found that such practices are common at large hospitals, although not all hospitals use the terminology variable staffing plan. Our test unit did not have electronic records of patients' nursing care requirements. Patients' needs varied such that some required a dedicated nurse, whereas up to four patients could be assigned to a single nurse in other cases.",

Each unit's aggregate patient composition is stable (so long as patient placement rules do not change) and the variable staffing plan takes into account aggregate patient acuity when deciding the appropriate nurse-topatient ratios. It is for this reason that different units use different nurse-to-patient ratios. These ratios also vary by shift to account for shift-to-shift differences in workload due to doctors' orders, distribution of medications and meals, and various call-button requests. In addition, patient acuity is not constant over time and to our knowledge there is no database that updates patients' acuity information over time. Therefore, estimating patient acuity from available electronic records is not currently feasible. However, if such data were available, an acuity-based adjustment could be applied to our nursing needs' forecast in a manner similar to the ADT adjustment described below.",

Our experiment revealed that nurses used beginning-of-shift census to determine a base staffing level (from the variable staffing plan) and adjusted it upwards to account for the ADT activity and for additional nurses required for periods when census is higher than the starting census. Based on this evidence, our nursing needs' forecast model predicts for each shift, by day of week, the beginning census of a shift and the additional workload due to the change in patient numbers and ADT. This information is then converted into nursing needs according to the variable staffing plan. The technical details of this model can be found in Appendix A.

These steps are important but not described in detail here in the interest of brevity. From the time-stamp data we obtained beginning census for each shift of each day of operation for the unit under investigation. We also aggregated this data into hourly, daily and weekly census levels to study seasonality by the time of the day, by the day of the week, and by the week of the year. The results are shown in Fig. 2 . Fig. 2 shows that there is no identifiable seasonal pattern by week; however, there are significant day of week and shift-based seasonal effects. Our approach compares the performance of a variety of forecasting techniques that utilize these seasonal patterns and picks the best among them. The goodness of each approach may be measured by the mean absolute deviation (MAD), i.e. the average of the absolute difference between the forecast and the actual staff requirements.

Upon comparing different forecasting methods, we found that in our example unit, the simple moving average procedure performed the best. Therefore, our forecasting model estimates the beginning census (by day of week) of each shift by the simple moving average of censuses of the most recent 52 weeks. The forecast of the workload adjustment due to ADT and increase in patient numbers during a shift is calculated by the long-term (1 year) average of extra nursing hours required, also by day of week and shift. We did not use moving average for the second component because this number is relatively stable for the unit we investigated. For a nursing unit with more variable ADT workload throughout the year, it may be more appropriate to use a different method to calculate the workload due to ADT. The forecast of the number of RNs required to meet the staffing needs are then calculated by applying the unit's nurse-to-patient ratio to the estimates of the beginning census and the additional workload from activities.",

There were some exceptions who worked every third weekend or alternated between every other and every third weekend. Therefore the unit needed approximately twice as many nurses as there were weekend shifts. Our calculations revealed that 22 nurses were needed to staff each weekend's shifts at full capacity.

We presented a general-purpose methodology for evaluating such approaches and evaluated an example, which we call schedule staggering, in this paper. Although more frequent forecast updating generally improves the accuracy of the forecast (this may not hold for every 2-week period due to noise in the data), the benefits of schedule staggering are not realized because scheduling becomes more constrained under staggering. The work schedule of half of the nurses is fixed at the time forecast is updated. Even when the updated forecast is more accurate, the hospital may not be in a position to utilize the benefits of staggering because of the various scheduling constraints that must be met. Therefore, the success of the staggering strategy depends on whether a hospital is able to utilize the improvement in forecast accuracy given more restricted scheduling flexibility because a proportion of the nurses' schedules are already fixed.",

Examples of other strategies include pooling nursing needs from several similar units (e.g. when a hospital has several telemetry or med/surge units) for the purpose of developing nurse schedules, using elective surgery booking information to improve nursing needs' forecasts, and choosing a hiring plan that strategically selects the weekday and weekend work patterns of additional hires. In each case, a schedule would be developed using the appropriate forecast as input and overall schedule performance would be ascertained in a manner similar to the example presented in Section 2.

There are a variety of rules negotiated with the NA that affect how nurses may be assigned to shifts. For example, each RN cannot have more than two different shift start times. A RN's weekend duty pattern can be one of two choices-either every other weekend off or every third weekend off. We describe key NA constraints below.",
