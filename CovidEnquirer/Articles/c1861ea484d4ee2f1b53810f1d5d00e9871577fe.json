Infectious virus was released from the cells within I days post-infection in early passages and within 3 days in later passages. In the absence of trypsin, neither passage of infected cells nor release of infectious virus occurred. The virus was shown to be similar to the fecal astrovirus by a neutralization test and by ultrastructural studies of infected cells. Primary embryo bovine kidney (EBK) and NBK cell cultures supported infection with both fecal and tissue culture adapted (TCA) astrovirus. The time-related development of infection, as studied by immunofluorescence, was similar for both fecal and TCA astrovirus and for both cell culture types. The first indication of viral infection and expression of viral antigens occurred at 7 h post-infection and was characterized by the appearance of a diffuse faint immunofluorescence (IF) of the cytoplasm. Soon after, two or three brilliant IF granules were observed in the nucleus, which appeared to involve the nucleoli. Subsequently, dense granular IF was seen in the perinuclear region of the cytoplasm, which later extended to involve all the cytoplasmic area. In both EBK and NBK cultures infected with either fecal or tissue culture adapted astrovirus, only a minority of cells became infected, even when the multiplicity of infection exceeded one. Occasionally lo-20% of cells were infected, but in most cultures the proportion did not exceed 2% and in NBK cultures, from 3/9 calves, no infected cells were observed. The virus did not infect bovine cell lines. Infectivity of the virus was not removed by treatment with chloroform, and iododeoxyuridine and actinomycin D when added to the medium, did not block replication. Masses of virions were observed by electron microscopy in discrete areas in the cytoplasm, with similar distributions as the viral antigen foci as seen by IF. The mean diameter of the virions was 34 nm. In conclusion, bovine astrovirus lacks both essential lipids and an envelope, probably has an RNA genome, may have a nuclear phase of replication involving the nucleoli which is not blocked by DNA inhibitors, and has a selective cell tropism.",

Within infected cells, virions were found in numerous discrete cytoplasmic foci which were not enclosed within any type of membrane-bound structure. Nuclei and nucleoli appeared to be normal and lacked virions or unusual accumulations of virus-associated material. Measurements of 20 virions gave an average diameter of 34 nm with a range of 30-37 nm. At high magnification the virions were round in cross-section with spiky outer projections. The proportion of infected cells as determined by IF of cover-slip cultures was similar at l-2%.",

Infection and at least partial replication was assumed to be associated with the appearance of immunofluorescent positive cells, a condition which was an essential prerequisite for the release of infectious virus under the influence of trypsin. The optimal concentration of trypsin needed for astrovirus replication, release of infectious virus and virus passage has not been determined, nor have other proteases been tested for their effect. At a concentration of 50 ,ug ml-' of trypsin, cell-free infectious astrovirus was produced from infected cultures, eventually reaching a titer of approximately lo6 IFFU ml-'. The mechanism of the effect of trypsin on the replication of bovine astrovirus was not determined in these studies, nor was it determined for human astrovirus (Lee and Kurtz, 1981) . Trypsin, a proteolytic enzyme, has been used with rotavirus and influenza virus in order to increase viral infectivities. Cleavage of the hemagglutinin glycoprotein by proteolytic enzymes is necessary for influenza virus infection (Klenk et al., 1975; Lasorowitz and Choppin, 1975) . Trypsin has a similar effect on rotavirus by specific cleavage of one of the outer-capsid proteins that facilitates the uncoating stage of viral replication (Theil et al., 1977; Clark et al., 1981; Espejo et al., 1981) .",

The addition of iododeoxyuridine (a thymidine analogue), or actinomycin D (an inhibitor of DNA transcription) to the medium did not inhibit infection. All these treatments blocked the infectivity or replication of BHVl but they had no effect on bovine rotavirus. Thus, one can conclude that bovine astrovirus lacks a lipid-containing envelope and is not a DNA virus nor a DNA-dependent RNA virus. The lack of an envelope confirms the electron-microscopic description of the virus (Madeley and Cosgrove, 1975; Woode and Bridger, 1978) that it has an unbroken circular border with a five-or six-pointed surface star and no envelope is observed.",

Rotavirus also replicates in the villus epithelial cells of the small intestine, which contain the Ia antigens, but not in the M cells. In rats, the epithelium lining the proximal tubules in the kidney cortex, similar to the villous epithelium in the gut, express Ia antigens in the basal part of the cells. In contrast, no Ia antigen expression is detected in M cells (Wiman et al., 1978; Hart and Fabre, 1981; Mayrhofer et al., 1983) .
