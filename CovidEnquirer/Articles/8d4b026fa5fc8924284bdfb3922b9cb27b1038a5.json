In this study, we report the development and testing of a real-time RT-PCR assay using a Taqman \u00ae -labeled probe for early and rapid detection of IBV. The assay amplifies a 143-bp product in the 5 -UTR of the IBV genome and has a limit of detection and quantification of 100 template copies per reaction. All 15 strains of IBV tested as well as two Turkey coronavirus strains were amplified, whereas none of the other pathogens examined, tested positive. Evaluation of the assay was completed with 1329 tracheal swab samples. A total of 680 samples collected from IBV antibody negative birds were negative for IBV by the real-time RT-PCR assay. We tested 229 tracheal swabs submitted to two different diagnostic laboratories and found 79.04% of the tracheal swabs positive for IBV by real-time RT-PCR, whereas only 27.51% of the samples were positive by virus isolation, which is the reference standard test. We also collected a total of 120 tracheal swabs at six different time points from birds experimentally infected with different dosages of IBV and found that, independent of the dose given, the viral load in the trachea plateau at 5 days post-inoculation. In addition, an inverse relationship between the dose of virus given and the viral load at 14 days post-inoculation was observed. Finally, we tested 300 total tracheal swab samples, from a flock of commercial broilers spray vaccinated for IBV in the field. The percentage of birds infected with the IBV vaccine at 3, 7, and 14 days post-vaccination was 58%, 65%, and 83%, respectively, indicating that only slightly more than half the birds were initially infected then the vaccine was subsequently transmitted to other birds in the flock. This observation is significant because coronaviruses, which have a high mutation rate, can revert to pathogenicity when bird-to-bird transmission occurs. The real-time RT-PCR test described herein can be used to rapidly distinguish IBV from other respiratory pathogens, which is important for control of this highly infectious virus. The test was extremely sensitive and specific, and can be used to quantitate viral genomic RNA in clinical samples.",

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly infectious disease of the upper-respiratory tract in chickens (Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003) . It can also affect the kidneys and reproductive tract. It is of economic importance to the poultry industry due to the high morbidity and production losses associated with the disease. The etiologic agent of IB is infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that belongs to the Coronaviridae family. The virus contains four structural proteins; nucleocapsid surrounding the viral RNA, an integral membrane glycoprotein, a small envelope protein, and a spike glycoprotein located on the surface of the viral envelope, which contains epitopes that induce virus-neutralizing and serotype-specific antibodies. Although control of IBV is primarily through the use of live attenuated vaccines, the disease is difficult to control because different serotypes of the virus do not cross-protect. Therefore, it is imperative to quickly and accurately detect the presence of the virus within an infected poultry flock so that subsequent flocks can be properly vaccinated. It is also important to rapidly differentiate IBV infections from other upper-respiratory diseases like avian influenza, Newcastle disease, infectious laryngotracheitis, and avian mycoplasmosis so that appropriate measures against those diseases can be taken in a timely manner.",

            "text": "Current diagnostic assays for IBV include virus isolation in embryonating eggs, tracheal organ culture, or cell culture immunoassays, and molecular assays that detect the viral RNA (Gelb and Jackwood, 1998) . Virus isolation is considered the reference standard; however, it is expensive and time consuming because several passages may be required to detect the virus. Immunoassays use IBV-specific monoclonal antibodies to detect the virus in direct or indirect fluorescent antibody and enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) formats. Although faster and simpler than virus isolation, immunoassays tend to lack specificity and sensitivity and none detect all strains or types of IBV Karaca et al., 1992; Naqi et al., 1993) . Molecular assays for the detection of IBV are commonly used because they provide highly specific and sensitive results in a timely manner. Molecular assays use the reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect viral RNA directly from a clinical sample or from virus isolated in a laboratory host system. When RT-PCR is used to amplify the spike glycoprotein of IBV, it can be coupled with restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) or nucleic acid sequencing to identify the type of the virus (Cavanagh et al., 1990; Jackwood et al., 1997; Keeler et al., 1998; Kingham et al., 2000; Kwon et al., 1993) .",

Briefly, RNA was extracted from the Mass 41 strain of IBV using the High Pure RNA Isolation Kit (Roche Diagnostics Corporation). The purified RNA was resuspended in diethylpyrocarbonate (DEPC) treated water and used in the RT-PCR reaction as previously described (Jackwood et al., 1997; Lee and Jackwood, 2001) . The amplified product was cloned into the pCR-XL-TOPO vector (Invitrogen Inc., Carlsbad, CA) per the manufacturer's directions and sequenced to verify its accuracy. The plasmid was linearized at base pair 735 relative to the start of the genome with Xmn I (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The linearized DNA was gel purified and used as template with a RiboMax T7 In Vitro Transcription System (Promega, Madison, WI) per the manufacturer's recommendations. The length of the runoff RNA transcripts was verified by agarose gel analysis, and the concentration was determined using a BioPhotometer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany). Ten-fold serial dilutions of the runoff RNA transcripts containing 2 \u00d7 10 6 to 2 \u00d7 10 1 copies of template per microliter were made and 5 L of each dilution was used as template in the assay. The limit of detection/quantification and reproducibility of the assay were determined by six independent runs. The limit of detection was defined as the lowest RNA concentration yielding a C T value where the fluorescence of the reaction exceeded 30 U of fluorescence. The limit of quantification was defined as the lowest RNA concentration on the standard curve that maintained linearity. The average number of IBV genome copies for each group of experimental samples was estimated using the equation derived from the standard curve.",

For virus isolation, it is generally recommended that tissues such as cecal tonsil and kidney or cloacal swabs be taken in addition to tracheal swabs because the virus is known to persist there (Gelb and Jackwood, 1998) .

Known negative samples, obtained from commercial layer chicks maintained in isolation units and monitored for antibodies to IBV by ELISA, all tested negative for IBV in the real-time RT-PCR assay. Since we wanted to insure the birds remained free of IBV, we choose commercial layer chicks with maternal antibodies to the virus as an added insurance against infection. For known positive samples, we used SPF chicks with no maternal antibodies and infected them with three different dosages of the Arkansas DPI strain of IBV. An additional negative control group was also maintained during that experiment. Three samples from the negative control group had C T values of 35.4, 28.25, and 36.84 . After retesting, all of the samples were below our calculated limit of detection and considered negative. Cross-contamination of samples especially during the RNA extraction process is a real concern with any RT-PCR reaction, but it is recognized that precautions should be taken to limit contamination at every step of the procedure.",

More studies will be necessary to determine the course of virus replication in vivo, but it appears that the tracheal epithelium can support a finite amount of virus and that virus replication continues until that limit is reached. For the dosages used in our study, the maximum level of viral load was reached within 5 days post-infection. It is interesting to note and quite appropriate that the requirements for efficacy of IBV vaccines outlined in section 113.327 Title 9 of the Code of Federal Regulations (http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx 99/9cfr113 99. html) requires that detection of challenge virus be conducted 5 d.p.i. We also observed that the level of viral RNA in the trachea of birds, which received a high dose of virus, declined more quickly than levels in birds receiving a low dose of the virus. Loss of ciliated columnar epithelium and presumably the associated virus replicating in those cells, is a common lesion with IBV infection. Birds receiving a high dose of IBV can develop clinical signs and lesions within 24 h, whereas natural spreading virus generally requires 36 h or more before clinical signs and lesions occur (Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003) . Presumably, high dosages of the virus would accelerate the loss of the epithelial cells in the upper-respiratory tract leading to a more rapid decline in viral load.",

By day 7, 65 of 100 birds were positive and by 14 days post-vaccination 83 of 100 birds were positive for IBV. The dynamics of vaccine spread in commercial chicken flocks following spray vaccination in the field is not known. Our data indicates that approximately half of the birds in the flock were initially exposed to the vaccine (day 3 post-vaccination data), which then spread to other birds in the flock so that by 14 days post-vaccination, more than 80% were exposed. More data will be required to verify this result, but it appears that exposure to IBV vaccine by in-house spray vaccination could be improved. Initially it could be considered advantageous for IBV vaccines to spread in a marginally exposed flock providing a mechanism for all the birds in the flock to become immunized, however; vaccine spread in a flock also presents opportunities for back passage of these rapidly mutating coronaviruses potentially leading to a reversion to pathogenicity.",

In addi-tion, IBV remains an extremely important disease in commercial chickens and quickly diagnosing it is critical for control of this highly infectious virus. The real-time RT-PCR assay for IBV described herein can be conducted directly on tracheal swabs without the need for virus isolation. And although it does not differentiate between different types of IBV it is extremely sensitive and specific, and can be used to quantitate viral RNA in clinical samples.",
