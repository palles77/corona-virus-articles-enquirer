With the import and export functions that are capable to retrieve electronic health record and edit the R506 and R507 data, the SRRT and local team can easily set up and manage their resources. The GPS function helps care takers to identify the geographical data for any countermeasure and action. The program is designed to submit reports automatically to the Ministry of Public Health (MOPH). The SRRT module can operate in both online and off-line conditions.",

The concept of health for all basically covers the primary health care and universal health coverage 1 . The ideas for responsiveness, efficiency, accessibility and availability are included. On the other hand, the concept of all for health is focused on health literacy, social and financial risk. WHO experts also recommended the care takers to concentrate their additional efforts on surveillance reports and epidemiological surveys in the community level, before moving to the hospital process 2,3 . Both health promotion and the disease prevention require the multidisciplinary team, which combines staffs such as physicians, epidemiologists, nurses, and village head.

The existing processes and flows have been analyzed. The documents and files used for each process and the types of information are evaluated. The flow starts when the case is found either by a patient visit or a report. Warning and surveillance requests are issued from the epidemiologist team to three local organizations, SRRT, DCC, and municipality from Ministry of Interior (MOI). The case reports from sub-district and the field team are used to identify the priority of problem areas. If outbreak is contaminated, the final report will be sent to the provincial public health office and National Health Society Organization (NHSO).

All ESMS dataset of patients in the epidemic and surveillance services were simplified based on the process and data flow of R506 and R507 standard formats. All details were collected and analyzed in order to verify the problems and gaps between each informal process, and also to determine the informal documents such as Facebook, Line or Whatsapp. Moreover the connections between the data recorded in their processes were reorganized to minimize the under-coverage problems from the case report. Other problems such as when pandemic was subsided, OPD and IPD nurses only make a direct call to social medicine section for the patient that were sent for PCR were carefully considerate. The new dataset regarding to the new flow and stakeholder were listed as shown in Fig. 1 . Qualitative attributes such as simplicity, flexibility, and stability of the new system were verified and compared. In addition the stage, in which sample was send for the laboratory test, was modified to match the requirement from the MOPH headquarter. Instead of having only two laboratory stages, result positive and result negative, the result waiting was added as the third stage. This third stage simply put an ease to the care taker team as it took time for the department of medical science to analyze the simple being sent. Authority for each monitoring process were required as security. This program was designed to be able to import and export electronic health record (EHR) database module from hospital information system (HIS) and the surveillance documents R506 and R507. The new system flow was aimed to improve the completeness and quality of the report and information in the database.",

Many informal processes and documents such as using the social network were reduced. The results from SRRT and surveillance team indicated that with this system the contamination is easier to achieve. As the program allowed the team to manage and operate their work. With the data entry function that could select staff tasks along with their area of responsibility that matched the available resources, provincial public health staffs easily determine and set up the active field team according to the outbreak level.
