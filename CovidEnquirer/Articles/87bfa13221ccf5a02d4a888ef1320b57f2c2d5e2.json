They 2 are also asymptomatic hosts for numerous viruses, including recently emerged zoonotic 3 Henipaviruses Nipah and Hendra, which are highly pathogenic for humans and other mammals. 4 Better understanding of how bats control viral infection requires development of relevant permissive 5 cellular experimental models. By applying a somatic reprogramming protocol to Pteropus bat primary 6 cells, using a novel combination of ESRRB, CDX2, and c-MYC transcription factors, we generated 7 bat reprogrammed cells exhibiting stem cell-like characteristics and a neural stem cell-like molecular 8 signature. These cells present a unique interferon-stimulated transcriptomic signature and both 9 produce and respond to interferon type-I, highlighting differences between stem cells from bats and 10 other mammals. In contrast to primary bat cells, these reprogrammed cells are highly susceptible to 11 infection by Henipavirus, thereby enabling isolation of new bat viruses, study of virus-bat 12 interactions, and better understanding of bat biology.",

            "text": "Emergence of zoonotic diseases is increasing globally; thus the ability to predict and prevent viral 3 epidemics is a major objective for public health organizations. Among all emerging infectious 4 diseases, approximately 60% are of zoonotic origin 1 . Bats host a large number of human and animal 5 zoonotic viruses, including Henipaviruses 2 (Nipah (NiV) and Hendra (HeV)), Coronaviruses (Severe 6 Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) 3 and Middle East Respiratory (MERS-CoV)) 4 , and 7 Filoviruses (Marburg 5 and Ebola viruses 6 ). These agents are among the most virulent pathogens 8 emerging from animal reservoirs and are capable of infecting a broad range of species, including 9 humans, while remaining asymptomatic in bats. Transmission of NiV from bats to humans occurs 10 either through intermediate host contamination 7, 8 or directly 9 via consumption of fruits or raw date 11 palm juice contaminated with bat saliva or urine. In the case of NiV-Bangladesh isolates, this may be 12 followed by inter-human transmission 10 . Henipaviruses are negative strand RNA viruses; both NiV 13 and HeV are responsible for outbreaks of respiratory and neurological diseases in Southeast Asia and 14 Australia, respectively, with a fatality rate of 40-100% 11 . NiV and Henipa-like viruses have been 15 detected molecularly and/or serologically in Pteropus bats from different Asian and African 16 Countries 12 , and worldwide distribution of these bat species poses a threat of future NiV pandemics 13 . 17 Bats are an ancient and diverse group of animals (the second largest order of mammals after rodents), 18 representing around 20% of all mammalian species 14 . Indeed, they are the most abundant and widely 19 distributed non-human mammalian species worldwide 15 . Bats, the only mammals capable of powered 20 flight, show extraordinary longevity compared with their corporal mass 16, 17 . Phylogenetic analyses 21 based on molecular data classified bats into two suborders: Yangochiroptera (microbat families) and 22 Yinpterochiroptera (including the non-echolocating Pteropodidae family, which contains the 23 Pteropus genus and the echolocating Rhinolophoidea) 18 . A large number of novel bat virus sequences 24 was identified in these two bat suborders, which diverged over 50 million years ago, suggesting a 25 long co-evolutionary history of bats and their viruses that have shaped unique host-pathogen 26 relationships 19 . In addition, bats harbor a markedly higher proportion of zoonotic viruses than other 27 mammalian orders 20,21 . Although bat serology and viral genome sequencing permit detection of a 28 number of bat viruses, isolating them has been far more challenging. Studying the bat immune system 29 and bat/virus interactions provides valuable insight into the mechanisms underlying successful 30 control of viral infection, and may lead to novel approaches to managing viral spillover and 31 development of new antiviral strategies for humans 22 . As infection studies in bats are difficult to 32 implement due to the animal facility constraints and the absence of bat husbandry, it is crucial to 33 author/funder. All rights reserved.

Utilization of high 6 multiplicities of infection by most studies 25 suggests that these cells show low permissiveness for 7 Henipavirus infection and replication. The use of primary and immortalized cells limits our ability to 8 isolate and study viruses that may show tropism for cell types that are more difficult to establish as a 9 primary culture or to immortalize, thereby emphasizing the need to develop more appropriate 10 Pteropus bat cells with different phenotypes. mice, then in humans, rats, and non-human primates, the process has been tested (with variable 16 success) in a large number of mammalian species, including rabbits, sheep, bovines, pigs, horses, 17 dogs, and even in some endangered species [27] [28] [29] ; however, despite the importance of bats to ecology 18 and immunovirology, and although certain attempts have been made in that direction 30 , somatic 19 reprogramming of primary bat cells has not been examined rigorously.",

These cells exhibit typical 22 PSC morphology, are recognized by SSEA-1 and EMA-1 stem-cell-specific antibodies, display PSC-23 specific chromatin features, and express a set of neural stem cell-associated genes. These 24 reprogrammed cells are much more highly susceptible to virus infection than the parental primary bat 25 cells, making them a new cell type that can be used to isolate novel bat viruses and study host-26 pathogen interactions. Interestingly, in contrast to stem cells from other mammalian species, bat RSCs 27 are capable of both responding to and producing IFN-I, and present a unique interferon-stimulated 28 gene (ISG) transcriptomic signature, suggesting some fundamental differences between bats and 29 other mammals. This new cell model is an important experimental tool that will improve 30 understanding of the unique properties of bat/virus interactions and will help to decipher novel aspects 31 of bat biology. 32 author/funder.

Therefore, we first used Sendai viruses to introduce the human 19 OSKM gene combination into bat PCs in the presence or absence of NANOG, which was expressed 20 through a transposon. Although the genes were delivered and expressed efficiently (Supplementary 21 Fig. 1b) , no long-term morphological changes were observed up to 100 days post-infection 22 ( Supplementary Fig. 1a ). Delivering the same gene combination using inducible transposon vectors 23 did not provide a better result, although an increase in cellular proliferation was observed, along with 24 transient and partial morphological changes ( Supplementary Fig. 1c, d) . 25 Next, we screened additional transcription factors for their ability to induce somatic (Fig. 1e) ; however, a longer period (35 days) was required when cells were cultured in 31 serum-containing ESM medium (Fig. 1f) .

The average doubling time in EPI 1 medium was estimated to be around 24 h, and that in ESM medium around 35 h. Bat RSCs show stem cell-like characteristics. Bat RSCs grew in compact colonies in both EPI and 4 ESM medium, with a morphology typical of PSCs: small and round, with a large nucleus, a high 5 nucleo-cytoplasm ratio, and a prominent nucleolus (Fig. 2a) . Electron microscopy confirmed that the 6 morphology and ultrastructure of bat RSCs was very different from that of bat PCs. In particular, 7 chromatin was distributed homogeneously throughout the nucleoplasm, without large zones of (Fig. 3a) . Furthermore, 3506 genes were differentially expressed between bat PCs and bat RSCs, with 28 a log -fold change > 2 (LFC > 2) and a p-value > 0.05 (Supplementary Table 2 ). When cultured in 29 either medium during reprograming, bat RSCs did not express key genes related to pluripotency, such 30 as POU5F1/OCT4 and NANOG; noticeable exceptions were SOX2 and ZSCAN4, which play roles 31 in telomere maintenance and long-term-genomic stability in ES cells 35 .

Further GO analysis of these 2 823 DEGs indicated that the first three GO terms for biological processes were \"nervous system 3 development\" (GO:0007399), \"generation of neurons\" (GO:0048699) and \"neurogenesis\" 4 (GO:0022008) (Supplementary Table 4 ). The most important GO terms for molecular function were 5 \"inorganic molecular entity transmembrane transporter activity\" (GO:0015318), \"ion transmembrane Table 4 ). 9 Additional analysis of the main gene clusters revealed that the most important cluster contained 27 10 members (Cluster 27, Fig. 3b ) and was centered on GRIA1 and GRIK2; this cluster harbored 11 numerous specific neural-associated receptors for neurotransmitters (e.g., GABA and 5- Table 3 ). These expression profiles suggest that the reprogramming process gave rise 19 to a new neural-related stem cell type that differs from the initial PCs and shares features with PSCs 20 described in other species. Interestingly, ephrin B2 (EFNB2), a receptor for Henipavirus entry, was 21 among the main DEGs and was expressed at much higher levels in bat RSCs than in bat PCs 22 (Supplementary Table 2 ). Such an expression profile suggests the possibility of Henipavirus entry 23 into these cells. We tested this in the following experiments. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/846410 doi: bioRxiv preprint 8 flow cytometry 6 h later (Fig. 4a) . In contrast to bat PCs, bat RSCs were susceptible to infection with 1 all four tested viruses. Henipaviruses entered bat RSCs much more readily than bat PCs and, 2 interestingly, more readily than Vero cells, which are commonly used to isolate and propagate 3 Henipavirus. Next, we examined the transcription and replication kinetics of NiV by RT-qPCR and 4 viral titration after infection of cells with virus at a low MOI (0.1 PFU/cell) (Fig. 4b, c) . In bat RSCs, 5 NiV RNA synthesis and production of viral particles increased by 4 log10 units between 0 h and 24 h Innate immune responses of bat RSCs. As innate immunity is the first line of defense against viral 14 infection, we next analyzed innate responses of bat RSC and compared them with those of bat PCs. 15 First, we performed a comparative analysis of ISG expression in non-stimulated bat PCs and RSCs 16 at the global transcriptomic level. Taking advantage of a consensus list of ISGs 36 , we identified 17 differential expression of 174 ISGs in the two cells types (Fig. 5a) . Analysis identified two main sets 18 of genes, one expressed at higher levels in bat RSCs (14 genes with a LFC > -2) and another expressed 19 at higher levels in bat PCs (83 genes with a LFC > 2) (Supplementary Table 5 ). The second set 20 contained a much higher number of genes, suggesting that reprogrammed cells expressed fewer ISGs 21 and that these cells had weaker antiviral capacity. In particular, the interferon-regulated factor 1 22 (IRF1) gene network was down-regulated in bat RSCs (Fig. 5b, Supplementary Table 6 ). This specific 23 intrinsic ISG signature may be one of the mechanisms underlying higher susceptibility of bat RSCs 24 to infection by Henipavirus. Further functional approaches will help to identify which specific genes 25 among those differentially expressed are implicated in bat antiviral responses. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/846410 doi: bioRxiv preprint concentrations of polyI:C; no increase in ISGs expression was observed in stimulated bat RSCs ( Fig.   1 6a). Next, we analyzed the effect of infection with a negative strand RNA virus, VSV, which 2 stimulates the TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5 pathways (Fig. 6b) . In contrast to stimulation with polyI:C, 3 VSV induced similar responses in both bat RSCs and bat PCs: VSV activated expression of IFN\u03b1, 4 IFN\u03b2 and ISG56 expression, but not that of MX1 or PKR. Finally, stimulation of bat RSCs and bat 5 PCs with IFN-I, known to activate the intracellular JAK-STAT pathway, induced similar responses 6 in both cell types, characterized by IFN dose-dependent expression of MX1, ISG56, and PKR mRNA 7 (Fig. 6c) . These results suggest that bat RSCs produce and respond to IFN-I, similar to bat PCs; 8 however, some intracellular signaling pathways, especially those related to the TLR3 pathway, seem 9 to be activated differently. The high permissiveness of bat RSCs reported herein (even higher than that of Vero cells routinely 22 used for virus isolation and production) provides an important new tool for further studies. This cell 23 model should bridge an existing gap in this field, facilitate optimization of viral discovery in bats 39 , 24 and allow further research into bat biology at the cellular and molecular level. 25 In recent years, somatic reprogramming has become a powerful method for generating PSCs The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/846410 doi: bioRxiv preprint in our unstimulated primary and reprogrammed bat cells is different from that expressed by 1 immortalized cell lines, possibly due to absence of immortalization-activated programs, which may 2 have affected ISG expression by bat cell lines in the previous study. Important differences in innate 3 immune signatures between undifferentiated stem cells and their differentiated progeny have been 4 described for several mammalian species; these differences lead to high resistance of stem cells to female specimen found naturally dead, and wing-membrane skin biopsies were obtained during the 33 author/funder.

Using the original combination of27 ESSRB, CDX2 and c-MYC transcription factors, we obtained bat RPCs that exhibit stem cell-like28    properties. Unexpectedly, the OSKM reprograming factors OCT4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC, which 29 are used successfully in other mammalian species 26 , were inefficient in Pteropus cells, either alone 30 or in combination with NANOG. This underlies the potential distinctiveness of bat cells with respect 31 to this approach. Future somatic reprograming in other bat species will show whether the approach this report generated cells with rather unique stem cell characteristics. In addition to 2 expression of PSC-specific antigens and epigenetic markers, these reprogramed bat cells express an3 original transcriptomic signature comprising numerous neural stem cell markers, as evidenced by GO 4 terms and gene cluster analyses. As neural cells are one of the principal targets of Henipaviruses, this 5 cell profile may favor infection, as observed in our study. In addition, as is currently the case for 6 human stem cells 40 , further differentiation of reprogrammed bat stem cells into neural cell types 7 relevant for viral infection may open new avenues for modeling of viral infectious diseases. 8 Recent studies of innate immune responses in human and murine stem cells reveal that 9 mammalian ESCs and other types of PSCs do not have a functional IFN-based antiviral mechanism 41-10 43 ; this is in contrast to avian ESCs that elicit antiviral responses similar to those of differentiated 11 cells 44 . Attenuated innate immune responses by pluripotent human cells correlates with high 12 expression of suppressor of cytokine signaling 1 (SOCS1) 45 . However, comparative analysis of 13 RNAseq data in our study revealed low differential expression of SOCS1 in RSCs compared with 14 that in PCs (LFC of -2.6), highlighting an additional distinction between bat and other mammalian 15 cells. Absence of IFN-I expression in murine embryos is attributed to developmental regulation of 16 IRF1 and IRF2 expression, which becomes functional after cell differentiation and is capable of 17 regulating IFN-1 production 46 . Similarly, expression of IRF1 and IRF2 is lower in bat RSCs that in 18 bat PCs (SupplementaryTable 2), suggesting that another mechanism regulates IFN-I production by 19 bat stem cells. Furthermore, previously observed constitutive expression of IRF7 in bats is thought to 20 allow them to respond more rapidly to infection 47 . Although we did not find similar expression of 21 IRF7 in our bat PCs and RSCs, we did (surprisingly) identify increased expression of IRF622    (SupplementaryTable 2). While IRF6 is the only member of IRF family not linked to IFN control in23 mammals, it acts as a positive regulator of IFN expression in fish 48 and inhibits production of the 24 proinflammatory cytokine IL-1\uf062 by human cells 49 , suggesting that it may be involved in controlling 25 innate immune responses and inflammation in bats; however, this needs to be further tested in 26 functional studies. 27 Previous genome analysis of Pteropus alecto and Myotis davidi bats suggests that positive 28 selection of components of the DNA damage checkpoint pathway is associated with changes in the 29 overlap between this pathway and the innate immune system, indicating that evolutionary adaptations 30 important for flight may have secondary effects on bat immunity 50 . Analysis of ISG expression in 31 immortalized P. alecto bat cell lines reveals strong evolutionary conservation, although unstimulated 32 bat cells express ISGs at higher level than their humans counterparts 51 .

One of the first lines of defense against viral pathogens is the IFN 11 response; indeed, contraction of the IFN-I locus and constitutive expression of IFN\uf061 was observed 12 in P. alecto bats 52 . Interestingly, we did not find constitutive expression of IFN-I by bat stem cells or 13 PC lines, although expression of IFN\uf061 and IFN\uf062 was inducible in both cell types. In agreement with 14 our results, a previous study did not observe constitutive expression of IFN\u03b1 in cell lines generated 15 from R. aegyptus bats 53 . Taken together, our data suggest that certain differences between in bat 16 immune responses and those of other mammals are present at the stem cell level and may have been 17 established during evolution, thereby shaping development of bat antiviral responses. Early exposure 18 of pregnant bats to viral infections circulating in bat colonies may lead to development of disease 19 tolerance in their progeny 54 and the absence of a strong immune response to viral proteins; this may 20 constitute a part of the antiviral bat defense strategy 55 . As suggested in a recent study of the Rousettus 21 bat genome 53 , immune tolerance rather than a heightened antiviral defense strategy may support 22 fitness, despite replication of pathogens, thereby allowing bats to efficiently control infection by 23 viruses that are highly pathogenic to other mammalian species. In conclusion, we obtained 24 reprogrammed bat cells presenting stem cell-like features and high permissiveness for Henipavirus 25 infection.
