Similar findings have been reported,6,12,16,18,24,30 although some studies found HBoV cases throughout the year with spring outbreaks.5,15,31,32 The higher frequency of detection in the winter months suggests a maximum incidence of HBoV1 infection in this season as well. However, most surveys on HBoV1 so far analyze samples collected for diagnosis of ARI, which is the reason for the predominance of samples collected during fall/winter, as in the present study.The rate of coinfection was at least 52.7%. This can be taken as estimation, since HBoV was detected by PCR, while coinfection with other respiratory viruses was determined based on immunofluorescence assay. Even so, noticeably over 80% of the coinfections are HBoV1-RSV coinfections",
