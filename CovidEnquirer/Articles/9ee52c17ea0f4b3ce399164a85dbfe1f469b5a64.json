Bats are divided into two orders, Megachiroptera and Microchiroptera, and bats, especially fruit bats of Megachiroptera, are currently being focused on as a source of emerging infections such as rabies virus (RV), Nipah virus, Hendra virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, and Ebola virus [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Of these viruses, RV, which belongs to the Rhabdoviridae family, genus Lyssavirus, is spreading the most worldwide and has a wide host range [6] . In mammals, RV infection causes 100% mortality, but some bats have shown no clinical signs with detectable antibody titers and were able to resist infection and become a carrier when infected with RV [7] [8] [9] [10] . Although immunological studies of bats may provide important clues to help clarify the relationships between host immune factors and viruses, few studies have been performed on the immune system of bats [6, [11] [12] [13] .",

Following virus infection in vivo, the IFN response is critical in restricting virus spread before the onset of adaptive immune system responses to control the infection [14] [15] [16] [17] . Newly synthesized IFN-a/b is secreted and binds to the type-I IFN receptors on the surface of infected and neighboring cells, inducing the Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of a transcription (Jak/ STAT) signaling cascade [15, 18, 19] . STAT1 and STAT2 are activated by phosphorylation and form heterodimers that associate with a third factor, IFN regulatory factor-9 (IRF-9) [15, 18, 19] . The resulting complex, IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3), translocates to the nucleus and induces the transcription of ISGs through a promoter element IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE). In contrast, only natural killer (NK) cells and T cells secrete type-II IFN, IFN-g, in response to virus infections [15] . IFNg signaling also involves a Jak/STAT signaling cascade. When activated by phosphorylation, STAT1 forms a homodimeric complex, g-activated factor (GAF), which binds to promoters containing a g-activated sequence (GAS) element after translocation to the nucleus, inducing the transcription of various genes involved in the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses [14, 15, 20] .",

In this study, we focused on STAT1, one of the critical components in interferon (IFN)-signaling and antiviral activity, which is often targeted by viral proteins to reduce antiviral activity and increase viral replication. We found that Rousettus aegyptiacus STAT1 (bat STAT1) is phosphorylatable and translocates to the nucleus when stimulated with human IFN-a (hIFN-a). Furthermore, phosphorylation of bat STAT1 and inhibition of nuclear translocation was observed in IFN-stimulated cells infected with the HEP-Flury strain of rabies virus, in the same manner as in other mammals. Additionally, quantitative real-time RT-PCR revealed that bat STAT1 mRNA was highly expressed in the liver, while low in muscle and spleen.",

Conserved tyrosine and serine phosphorylation sites were also found at the 701st and 727th amino acid residues, respectively. In addition, the overall similarity at the amino acid level between the R. aegyptiacus STAT1 and those of the other animals are as follows: the highest identity, 97% with Equus caballus; 96% with Bos taurus, Canis familiaris, Homo sapiens, and Sus scrofa; 93% with Mus musculus and Rattus norvegicus; 83% with Gallus gallus; 80% with Xenopus laevis; and the lowest identity, 61% with Danio rerio. Each domain in R. aegyptiacus STAT1 shared high homology with those of other mammals. We thus hypothesized that bat STAT1 has the same function as that of others.",

This difference in antibody reactivity to bat STAT1 between the two studies might have been caused by the differences in the antibodies used or the difference in bat species. Although Hagmaier et al. used Tb-1-Lu, cells derived from Tadarida brasiliensis of Microchiroptera, we used cloned STAT1 from the primary bat kidney cells obtained from R. aegyptiacus of Megachiroptera. RV P protein is known to inhibit STAT1 nuclear translocation by binding to the coiled-coil and DNA-binding domains of STAT1 in human cells, but it does not inhibit phosphorylation of human STAT1 [30] . We hypothesized that the clinical sign differences between bats and humans [7, 9, 10] might be caused by RV-STAT1 interaction differences among species. However, bat STAT1 in RV-infected cells was phosphorylated but could not translocate to the nucleus, in the same manner as that of humans [24, 25] . This result seems reasonable as the putative coiled-coil and DNA-binding domains, binding sites of RV protein, of bat STAT1 showed high sequence similarity with those of other mammals and suggests that other factors related to the development of clinical signs exist when infected by RV.",

However, the target positions of STAT1 are different among viruses, and the structure and function of bat STAT1 might be different among bats. Thus, further studies on bat immune systems are needed to clarify the relationships and responses between hosts and viruses. Fig. 3 . Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis of STAT1 gene expression in various tissues. Expression of STAT1 mRNA in various tissues of Rousettus aegyptiacus was analyzed using real-time RT-PCR. Data are averaged from three different bats with standard deviations. The data were normalized to GAPDH gene expression using the 2nd derivative max (DDCt) method.",
