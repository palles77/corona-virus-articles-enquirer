[1] [2] [3] The advent of real time PCR technologies has further improved upon these already significant benefits. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] In comparison to traditional gel-based PCR assays, real time PCR offers similar or improved sensitivity and specificity in a rapid format (turn around time from sample receipt to result <5 h). Since real time PCR reactions are performed in a closed system (no gel analysis needed) the risk of contamination has been substantially reduced. This has also reduced the requirement for a stringent laboratory structure. The increasing number of commercially available real time PCR chemistries and platforms has led to significant reductions in its overall cost.",

After further multiplexing our respiratory service still consists of five separate assays but can now detect 17 different viral and bacterial pathogens. In 2007, we applied the same principles to our non-respiratory diagnostic service. In this case all the multiplex assays were designed to test certain sample types that represent different disease syndromes.

Other factors such as robustness, reproducibility and, if relevant, linearity and quantitation accuracy were also assessed. A test would only be deemed acceptable if it was shown to be identical (or superior) in performance to the individual tests. Failure at this stage required further experiments using altered concentrations of primers or probes. If such changes did not result in an acceptable improvement in test performance, then the test was discarded.

This kit is designed specifically for 2-4 plex real time PCR and through various mechanisms has been shown to prevent test interaction/competition and therefore allows simultaneous detection and accurate quantitation to take place. The use of this kit has allowed us to develop a single set of five standards each containing a known concentration of all three viruses: adenovirus, CMV and EBV. These five standards provide linear and reproducible standard curves for all three pathogens. We have also used this kit in our STD screen and confirmation assay that is used to detect C. trachomatis, Nessieria gonnorhoeae and an internal control in a single tube.",

These dyes are chosen because the excitation and emission wavelengths are different enough to allow accurate detection of each, reducing the risk of crosstalk. Crosstalk is when the fluorescence increase associated with one dye spills over into another channel that is being used to detect another dye. This leads to two positive results: one real and one not. Sometimes a strong FAM signal can also be detected in the VIC channel resulting in a false positive result. Some PCR platforms can also confuse large increases in VIC-Tamra signals as increases in the background calibration dye ROX. Subsequently, the platform will reduce the fluorescence levels of the dyes detected in all wells which on some occasions can result in false negative traces or strange traces. In most cases crosstalk can be eliminated with appropriate test optimisation (e.g. reducing or increasing the amount of dye/probe present without any loss in test sensitivity) or PCR platform re-calibration.",

Our laboratory tests are carried out on either the ABI7500 or the Rotorgene PCR platforms. On the ABI 7500, Tamra bidopy & NED are the recommended 4th dyes whereas Texas Red & ROX are suggested for the Rotorgene 3000. However, despite this guidance significant crosstalk was encountered. For example, when using Tamra biodopy positive traces were found in all dye channels (Fig. 1A) and positive Texas Red traces on the Rotorgene were found to appear in the Cy5 channel. Careful optimisation could not rectify this issue and the machine calibration was not at fault. This was eliminated by using ROX as the 4th dye on both platforms (Fig. 1B) . It should be noted that using ROX as a probe dye is not recommended for some ABI PCR platforms as it is commonly used as a reference dye. However, this function can be \"switched off\" and we have found no problems when using this as the fourth dye in our qualitative tests. It should also be noted that some PCR kits will come with ROX already added and therefore may not be of use in this situation.",

The inclusion of the parechovirus test will increase the detection rate in patients with enterovirus like illnesses whereas the inclusion of human metapneumovirus, influenza C, parainlfuenza 4, the coronaviruses NL63, OC43, 229e has lead to increases in the overall viral detection rate in respiratory samples. Such improvements will have positive outcomes on clinical management, infection control and public health since our tests are now more likely to provide a relevant diagnostic result. This has not been associated with increased cost. With multiplexing fewer tests are carried out and less reagents (in particular PCR mastermix-the most expensive component of a PCR test after extraction costs) are required (Table 4 ). Significant cost savings may also be achieved due to the fact the service requires less staff hands on time. 22 Multiplexing by sample type/disease syndrome simplifies the routine service. Reductions in sample turn around time have been achieved by reducing the amount of separate tests needed to be carried out. This ensures more samples can be tested within the working day. In future, such simplifications in the test procedure will also aid the development of automated testing systems which in turn will make the service less error prone and more rapid.",
