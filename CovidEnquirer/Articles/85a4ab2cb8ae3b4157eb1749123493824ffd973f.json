CTL recognize class I major histocompatibility complex molecules complexed to peptides of 8-10 residues derived from cytosolic proteins. To understand CTL responses to these antigens and to manipulate CTL responses optimally, it is necessary to identify the specific peptides recognized by CTL. The methods currently used for this purpose have significant drawbacks. We describe a plasmid transfection method that results in significant lysis of histocompatible target cells. Influenza virus-specific CTLs specifically lysed target cells that were transfected with plasmids bearing cDNAs encoding full length gene products, fragments containing the region that encodes the CTL epitope, or even a ten residue peptide. This significantly lessens the time and effort required to define genes, and gene segments that contain CTL epitopes.",

They are also thought to he involved in autoimmune diseases. The central feature of CTL recognition is its major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restricted nature (Zinkernagel and Doherty, 1979) . In recent years, there has been tremendous progress in understanding the molecular nature of CTL antigen recognition and how antigenic determinants are generated. CTL antigen receptors recognize peptides bound to the antigen binding groove of MHC class I molecules. In many cases these peptides consist of 8-10 residues (R/$tzschke et al., 1990; Van Bleek and Nathenson, !990), although it is likely that slightly Ionger peptides are also recognized. Peptides appear to be derived from a cytosolic pool of foreign or self proteins. In most circumstances, protein fragments are processed for presentation to CTL at least as efficiently as intact proteins (Tevethia et al., 1983; Townsend et al., 1985; Gould et al., 1989; Sweetser et al., 1989; Whitton and Oldstone, 1989) .",

The first step in this process is to identify the protein from which the antigenic peptide is derived. It is possible at this stage to identify the antigenic peptide from a library of overlapping peptides, which bind directly to cell surface class I molecules and bypass the requirement for antigen processing. For most investigators, however, budgetary constraints severely limit this option, particularly if the protein is large. Thus, it is usually necessary to narrow down the location of the peptide in the protein by expressing fragments of the protein in the ceil.",

Much of the time is spent after the gene of interest has been inserted into a plasmid that is appropriate for eukaryotic expression or homologous recombination into a viral genome. In the present report we describe a method in which plasmid DNA can be used directly to transfect cells for use in a standard 5~Cr release assay to monitor recognition by CTL. We show this method to be applicable for the expression of full-length gene products bearing a CTL determinant, fragments bearing the determinant, and even a ten residue peptide.",

Gene fragments were created by polymerase chain reaction of the PR8 NP using synthetic oligonucleotide primers containing restriction endonuclease sites (Sail in the upstream primer and Nod in the downstream primer) to enable directional ligation, the ATG initiation codon preceded by the sequence CCACC for efficient translation (Kozak, 1989) in the upstream primer, and a double stop codon (TAGTGA) in the downstream primer. The non-annealing bases were flanked by 10 bases that fully annealed to the target DNA. PCR products were digested with Sail and Notl and inserted behind the vaccinia virus (Vac) early-late P7.5 promoter in a modified version of the pSC11 plasmid (' Chakrabarti et al., 1985) in which the Smal site was replaced by Sail and Notl.",

This requirement has limited the usefulness of transient transfections, which usually result in the expression of foreign genes in only a minority of the cells. For many cell types, however, efficiency of transfection can be enhanced significantly by first infecting with vaccinia virus (Vac) at high multiplicity of infection (Fuerst et ai., 1986; EIroy-Stein et al., 1989; Elroy-Stein and Moss, 1990) . Though the exact mechanism responsible for this effect is not un-derstood, up to 100% of the transfected cells can be observed to express the protein of interest. To achieve high levels of expression in each transfectant, Fuerst et al. (1986) placed the gene of interest behind the T7 bacteriophage promoter, and utilized a Vae recombinant that expresses the T7 RNA polymerase in the cytosol early in the infectious cycle. Additionally, if a gene is placed behind a Vae promoter, then infection with nonrecombinant Vac can be used to enhance transfection and drive expression of the gene (Cochran et al., 1985) albeit at lower levels than those obtained with the T7 system (Fuerst et al., 1986) . We investigated the capacity of both systems to identify CTL target antigens.",

A plasmid containing the gene encoding the Tac subunit of the interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) behind the T7 promoter served as an additional negative control. Infection and transfection were performed either with the L929 cells attached to plastic or in suspension following release by trypsinization. L929 cells in suspension were also infected with a non-recombinant Vac (WR), or Vac recombinants expressing HA or NP. Following 4 h incubation, cells were labeled with S~Cr and tested for recognition by CTL specific for HA or NP derived from CBA mice (H-2k). Immunofiuorescence studies using HAand NP-specific monoclonal antibodies showed that, in general, 70-80% of the cells contained detectable amounts of antigen regardless of whether it was encoded within the Vae genome or on the plasmid (Table i) . Since T cells are capable of responding fully to antigen present in the cell at levels barely detectable by immunofluorescence (Tevethia et al., 1983; Townsend et al., 1984 Townsend et al., , 1985 , this range is likely to be a low estimate of the percentage of APC recognizable by antigen-specific CTL. As summarized in Table I , transfection of cells with the appropriate genes sensitized L929 cells (H-2 k) for specific lysis by NP-or HA-specific CI'L. Transfected cells were lysed at similar levels as non-transfected cells infected with Vac recombinants containing the same gene. Transfection of cells in suspension was slightly more effective than transfection of adherent cells and is somewhat more convenient to carry out. The specificity of recognition is demonstrated in two ways. First, cells transfected with IL-2R Tac gene are not recognized by influenza specific CTL. This is not due to poor infection with T7 Vac, since the cells were efficiently lysed by Vac-specific CTL. Nor is it due to lack of transfection since the cells express Tac as determined by cytofluorography (not shown). a Values given are for CTL:APC ratios of 9:1 and 3:1.",

It has been shown that the CTL response to NP by H-2 d haplotype-mice is restricted to the K \u00b0 class 1 molecule and that amino acids 147-155 comprise the segment of NP bound to K d (R~tzschke et al., 1990) . Using polymerase chain reaction methodology, the NP gene was divided into slightly overlapping thirds, encoding amino acid residues 1-168, 147-315, and 296-496. Initiation codons were introduced before the second and third segments, an, gene segments were each placed behind the vaccinia P~.5 promoter of the pSCll plasmid. This promoter has been shown to be significantly weaker than the T7 promoter in the Vac-transfection system (Fuerst et al., 1986) . This is due in part to the fact that, although the P~.5 is normally active during both early and late phases of infection, early gene expression is quite low under the conditions employed (Cochran et al., 1985) . Since transcription of these genes was controlled by an .authentic Vac promoter, it was possible to substitute wild type Vac for the vTF7-3 recombinant for infection of L929 cells expressing K d. The first and second gene fragments both code for amino acids 1.~7-168, and both could potentially sensitize cells for lysis by Kd-restricted, NPspecific CTL. Table 11 shows that cells transfected with plasmids containing either of these segments are lysed by NP-(but not HA-) specific CTLs, while cells transfected with a plasmid encoding the carboxy terminal third of NP are not iysed above background values. When expressed by a recombinant vaccinia virus, this fragment does stimulate lysis by H-2 b CTL that recognize residues 366-374 of NP (R/~tzschke et al., 1990) (data not shown).",

The pSCll plasmid, used in our experiments to drive antigen expression from a Vac promoter, does contain the gene for fl-galactosidase behind the Vac PH late promoter and this could be exploited. Alternatively, one could effect a fusion of a detectable protein and the fragment in question, obviating the need for an additional promoter, but it must be kept in mind that sequences directly flanking a CTL epitope can negatively affect its recognition (Del Val et al., 1991; Eisenlohr et al., 1992) . If one is to drive expression of a control gene with a separate Vac promoter, the relatively poor expression of genes behind early promoters in this system (Cochran et al., 1985) suggests that a late or early-late promoter should be employed.",

Although additional work would be necessary in designing vectors that optimize the chances of expressing antigenic determinants from eDNA libraries controlled by the T7 promoter, there would seem to be no insurmountable technical hurdles.",
