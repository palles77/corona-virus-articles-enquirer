            "text": "Luteolin, a plant flavonoid, has potent anti-inflammatory properties both in vitro and in vivo. However, the molecular mechanism of luteolinmediated immune modulation has not been fully understood. In this study, we examined the effects of luteolin on the production of nitric oxide (NO) and prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ), as well as the expression of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), tumor necrosis factoralpha (TNF-\u03b1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in mouse alveolar macrophage MH-S and peripheral macrophage RAW 264.7 cells. Luteolin dosedependently inhibited the expression and production of these inflammatory genes and mediators in macrophages stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Semi-quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay further confirmed the suppression of LPS-induced TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, iNOS and COX-2 gene expression by luteolin at a transcriptional level. Luteolin also reduced the DNA binding activity of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) in LPS-activated macrophages. Moreover, luteolin blocked the degradation of I\u03baB-\u03b1 and nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB p65 subunit. In addition, luteolin significantly inhibited the LPS-induced DNA binding activity of activating protein-1 (AP-1). We also found that luteolin attenuated the LPS-mediated protein kinase B (Akt) and IKK phosphorylation, as well as reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. In sum, these data suggest that, by blocking NF-\u03baB and AP-1 activation, luteolin acts to suppress the LPS-elicited inflammatory events in mouse alveolar macrophages, and this effect was mediated, at least in part, by inhibiting the generation of reactive oxygen species. Our observations suggest a possible therapeutic application of this agent for treating inflammatory disorders in lung.",

            "text": "It is well documented that pulmonary oxidant stress and inflammatory reaction play important pathological roles in disease conditions, including acute lung injury/adult respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS), hyperoxia, ischemia-reperfusion, sepsis, radiation injury, lung transplantation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Reactive oxygen species (ROS), released from activated leukocytes and macrophage, damage the lungs and initiate cascades of pro-inflammatory reactions multiplying pulmonary and systemic stress (Christofidou-Solomidou and Muzykantov, 2006) . Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a novel global infectious disease induced by Corona virus. A clinical investigation has shown that pathological changes in SARS patients are similar to those of acute lung injury, as revealed by alveolar cell collapse, severe exudation, acute inflammatory reaction and hyaline membrane formation (Lew et al., 2003) . Currently, no effective therapy is available for the management of ALI/ARDS/SARS and only supportive therapies exist. This has prompted us to search for novel compounds with therapeutic effect to reduce lung injuries and relieve symptoms (File and Tsang, 2005; Lai, 2005) .",

            "text": "It is noteworthy that the use of medicinal plants or their crude extracts is increasingly becoming an attractive approach as a complement and an alternative for treating various inflammatory disorders. Lonicera japonica (Caprifoliaceae) has been known as an anti-inflammatory herb in traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years and has been widely used for upper respiratory tract infections, diabetes mellitus and rheumatoid arthritis (Lee et al., 2001) . This herbal medicine has also been employed for treatment of SARS in mainland China (Liu et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2004) . Luteolin (3\u2032,4\u2032,5,7-tetra-hydroxylflavone), a flavonoid isolated from L. japonica, exhibits a strongly anti-inflammatory activity, can effectively inhibit the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and inducible nitric oxide (NO) production in vitro (Park et al., 2005; Xagorari et al., 2001) , and also protect against LPS-induced lethal toxicity by inhibiting pro-inflammatory molecule expression in vivo and reducing leukocyte infiltration in tissues (Kotanidou et al., 2002) . LPS from Gram-negative bacteria is well known to cause bacterial sepsis mediated through activation of monocytes, neutrophils and macrophages (Aderem and Ulevitch, 2000) . Sometimes activation of these cells may induce hyper-secretion of various pro-inflammatory and toxicity mediating molecules such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, eicosonoids and nitric oxide (NO) (Nathan, 1987) . The excessive inflammatory responses, in turn, may manifest respiratory failure and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) i.e. loss of capillary integrity, distributive and septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction and mortality. Exposure of laboratory animals or cultured monocytes to bacterial LPS triggers the generation of ROS and gene induction; the inducible genes encode pro-inflammatory cytokines and enzymes such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, COX-2, and iNOS, which up-regulate the host defense systems but unfortunately also contribute to pathological conditions such as bacterial sepsis, ischemia/reperfusion injuries, chronic inflammatory disease, and the down-regulation of hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes . Recently, luteolin has been found to be able to inhibit the LPS-induced TNF-\u03b1 release by inactivating the extracellular-regulated kinases (ERK) and p38 MAPK and blocking the transcriptional activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) (Xagorari et al., 2001 ). An in vivo study indicated that feeding of luteolin protects mice against LPSinduced toxicity (Kotanidou et al., 2002) . Also, luteolin alleviates bronchoconstriction and airway hyperreactivity in ovalbumin-sensitized mice (Das et al., 2003) and decreases the acute Chlamydia pneumoniae infection load and inflammatory reactions in vivo (Tormakangas et al., 2005) .",

As demonstrated in Fig. 1A , treatment of mouse alveolar macrophage MH-S and peripheral macrophage RAW 264.7 cells with LPS (100 ng/ml) caused a substantial increase in the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6) and mediators (NO and PGE 2 ).

To examine whether luteolin is cytotoxic to these two macrophages cell lines, MH-S and RAW 264.7 cells were incubated with 5-50 \u03bcM luteolin for 24 h. Within our tested concentrations, no cytotoxic effect of luteolin was observed in these two cells (Fig. 1B) .

            "text": "NF-\u03baB is an important transcriptional regulator of inflammatory cytokines and plays a crucial role in immune responses (Aderem and Ulevitch, 2000) . For the purpose of this study, we hypothesized that luteolin would inhibit the expression of these genes through the suppression of NF-\u03baB activation. We examined the effect of luteolin on the binding activity of NF-\u03baB to its consensus DNA oligonucleotide by employing the electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). As indicated in Fig. 3A , LPS treatment caused a significant increase in NF-\u03baB-DNA binding activity within 60 min. This binding activity was decreased by pretreatment with luteolin, and the specific interaction between DNA and NF-\u03baB was demonstrated by competitive inhibition with 100-fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotide. LPS-mediated NF-\u03baB-DNA binding activity was also inhibited by a NF-\u03baB inhibitor, PDTC. Furthermore, we examined the regulatory effect of luteolin on LPS-induced nuclear translocation of the cytosolic NF-\u03baB p65 subunit by immunostaining (Fig. 3B ). As expected, luteolin treatment markedly suppressed the LPS-induced NF-\u03baB p65 nuclear translocation. Since nuclear translocation of NF-\u03baB was preceded by the phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and proteosome-dependent degradation of I\u03baB (Ghosh and Baltimore, 1990; Hayden and Ghosh, 2004) , we next examined the effect of luteolin on LPS-induced I\u03baB degradation by Western blot analysis. As demonstrated in Fig. 3C , stimulation of MH-S or RAW 264.7 macrophages with 100 ng/ml LPS induced a rapid degradation of cytosolic I\u03baB protein within 10 to 20 min; this effect was drastically blocked by treatment with luteolin (25 \u03bcM). is attributed to suppressing the expression of inflammatory genes, RT-PCR analysis was performed. LPS-mediated upregulation of inflammatory genes (iNOS, COX-2, and IL-6) was significantly attenuated by PDTC except TNF-\u03b1 (Fig. 4A ). Based on these results, we hypothesize that there may be other routes participating in the inhibitory effect of luteolin on TNF-\u03b1 expression. It has been reported that transcription factor activating protein-1 (AP-1) also appears to be activated by LPS and causing production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Granger et al., 2000; Shaulian and Karin, 2002) . Accordingly, subsequent study of LPS-induced AP-1 activation in MH-S cells was performed. Pretreatment of MH-S cells with 10 \u03bcM curcumin (an AP-1 inhibitor) resulted in a decrease of the LPSstimulated TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, iNOS mRNA expression except COX-2 mRNA. The inhibitory effect of luteolin on inflammatory gene expression is stronger than that of combined treatment with curcumin and PDTC in LPS-stimulated macrophages (Fig. 4B) . To assess the effect of luteolin and curcumin on AP-1-DNA binding activity, EMSA was done on MH-S cells. As indicated in Fig. 4C , treatment with LPS caused an increase in AP-1-DNA binding activity within 60 min; pretreatment with luteolin or curcumin caused a strong inhibition of LPS-induced AP-1-DNA binding activity. These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of luteolin on LPS-stimulated pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediator production might be regulated by both NF-\u03baB and AP-1 transcriptional activation.",

To further address the upstream signaling molecule in luteolinmediated NF-\u03baB inactivation, MH-S cells were pretreated with luteolin for 30 min and then stimulated with 100 ng/ml LPS for 10 min, the effect of luteolin on LPS-induced Akt and IKK activation was examined. Pretreatment with luteolin significantly reduced the LPS-elicited Akt (Thr308 and Ser473) and IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 (Ser176/180) phosphorylation. Similarly, pretreatment with a PI3-k selective inhibitor LY294002 (10 \u03bcM) resulted in a dramatic reduction of Akt and IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 phosphorylation for 30 min, and then stimulated with or without LPS (100 ng/ml) for 60 min. Nuclear extracts were prepared and electrophoretic mobility shift assay was performed using biotin-labeled NF-\u03baB consensus binding sequence. Competitive EMSA using an unlabeled NF-\u03baB consensus sequence at 100-fold excess confirmed the specificity of NF-\u03baB protein binding.

            "text": "Flavonoids are ubiquitous plant secondary metabolites and have a variety of biological effects, including antioxidant, antitumor, anti-microbial, anti-allergic, and anti-angiogenic properties (Shimada et al., 2006) . Some natural flavonoids have antiinflammatory effects in mammalian cells, which may be due to their ability to suppress the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and mediators (Yuan et al., 2006) . Accumulated evidence indicates that dysregulation of cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, plays an essential role in many inflammatory conditions such as septic shock, hemorrhagic shock, rheumatoid arthritis and atherosclerosis. Inhibition of inflammatory cytokine and mediator production or function serves as a key mechanism in the control of inflammation, and agents that suppress the expression of these inflammation-associated genes have therapeutic potential for treatment of inflammatory diseases. Therefore, natural flavonoids have attracted interest as potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of inflammation. The plant flavonoid luteolin exhibits anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting NF-\u03baB-elicited gene expression and proinflammatory cytokine production in vitro (Xagorari et al., 2001) , and histologically suppresses the inflammation in bacteria-infected lung tissue in C57BL/6J mice (Tormakangas et al., 2005) . On the other hand, alveolar macrophages especially are thought to be the preferential immunoregulatory cell in lung tissue and targeted by bacterial endotoxins such as LPS. In this study, we found that luteolin significantly inhibits LPS-induced TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, cyclooxygenase-2, and iNOS expression at the transcriptional level in murine alveolar macrophage MH-S and peripheral macrophage RAW 264.7 cell lines. Macrophages/monocytes, derived from a bone marrow pluripotent stem cell, are specialized hematopoietic cells distributed throughout different tissues of the body where they play a central role in homeostasis and tissue remodeling. Generation of an immune response may be considered another aspect of macrophage function. When monocytes leave the bone marrow, they do not appear to be programmed for any particular tissue. Rather, they undergo tissue-specific maturation in response to factors in tissues. Different macrophage populations may arise from differing local conditions in the tissue; these populations differ in morphology and functional activity (cytotoxicity, migration, oxygen radical production, pinocytosis and tissue factor production). In the lung, alveolar macrophage function can be influenced by surfactant and other components of lung lining fluid that can be obtained by lung lavage (Lambrecht, 2006) . The alveolar macrophages play a key role in inflammatory and immune responses in the lung. However, the alveolar macrophage is thought to be a relatively poor antigen-presenting cell, compared with interstitial macrophages and monocytes. It has been reported that LPS-inducible genes were differentially regulated in macrophages derived from different tissues (Feng et al., 1999) . To our knowledge, this is the first report implicating the inhibition of LPS-stimulated inflammatory molecule gene expression by luteolin in both alveolar and peripheral macrophage cell lines. Our observations are consistent with the findings of previous reports demonstrating that luteolin significantly suppressed the LPS-increased expression of TNF-\u03b1 and iNOS genes in murine primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (Comalada et al., 2006) , and of IL-6 and COX-2 in peripheral macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 (Xagorari et al., 2001; Harris et al., 2006) . However, our findings show that the different populations of macrophages exhibit differential kinetics of activation in response to LPS. For example, while the activation of MH-S macrophages by LPS is relatively rapid (detectable at 2 h, Fig. 2B ). LPS stimulation of RAW 264.7 macrophage activation is more slow (detectable at 4 h, Fig. 2B ). Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of luteolin on LPS-induced gene expression (TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, COX-2 and iNOS) is stronger in MH-S macrophages than in peripheral macrophages (Fig. 2B) . These results imply that alveolar macrophages are more sensitive to tested agents (LPS and luteolin) than peripheral macrophages. The reason for such differences may be due to functional heterogeneity among tissue macrophages as regards their cytokine production and signal transducing properties.",

However, IL-6 production is rapidly increased in acute inflammatory responses associated with infection, injury, trauma and other stress. As such, a dysregulated, high-level production of IL-6 could induce an undesirable inflammatory condition in many organs. With this study we show that luteolin not only inhibits IL-6 production ( Fig. 1) but also reduces its mRNA transcript in LPS-stimulated MH-S and RAW 264.7 macrophages, indicating that this compound could transcriptionally down-regulate IL-6 expression. The NF-\u03baB transcription factor has been proved to play a key role in the transcriptional up-regulation of the LPS-inducible IL-6 gene . We found that although the LPS-induced NF-\u03baB and AP-1-DNA binding activities are inhibited by luteolin (Figs. 3A and 4C), blocking NF-\u03baB activity with PDTC significantly attenuates IL-6 mRNA expression. However, blocking AP-1 activity with curcumin slightly reduced LPS-induced IL-6 expression (Fig. 4) . These results suggest that luteolin-mediated NF-\u03baB inactivation is the most important pathway involved in IL-6 down-regulation in LPSstimulated macrophages.",

On the other hand, iNOS expression in macrophages is activating by particular inducers and participating in the pathology of inflammatory diseases including atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, septic shock, transplant rejection, and multiple sclerosis, leading to cell death (Buttery et al., 1994) .

Thus, selective inhibitors of COX-2 have been considered therapeutically effective for preventing inflammatory reaction and disease. The production of PGs by LPS in macrophages is primarily because of the transcriptional activation of the COX-2 gene. Luteolin has been found to inhibit inflammation-associated COX-2 expression and PGE 2 formation in RAW 264.7 cells (Harris et al., 2006) . We demonstrate here that luteolin could suppress PGE 2 production and COX-2 gene expression via inactivation of NF-\u03baB in both MH-S and RAW 264.7 macrophages. Our data also revealed that luteolin might not affect COX-1 enzymatic activity, because this compound did not alter basal PGE 2 production in these two macrophage cell lines (data not shown).",

Oxidative stress occurs when this balance is disrupted by excessive production of ROS. ROS are commonly multiplied during inflammatory processes that involve signal transduction and gene activation and can contribute to host cell and organ damage. Accumulating evidence indicates that generation of ROS is involved in regulating the activation status of a variety of transcription factors, including NF-\u03baB and AP-1 (Pham et al., 2004) . Intracellular redox changes induced by ROS augment NF-\u03baB activation through the phosphorylation and degradation of I\u03baB by increasing IKK or Akt kinase activity (Gloire et al., 2006) . Several agents that activate NF-\u03baB are found to have led to increased intracellular production of ROS. Previous studies proved that antioxidants inhibit NF-\u03baB activation and block the expression of inflammatory cytokines as well as the production of NO and PGE 2 . Also, it has been reported that ectopic overexpression of catalase attenuates ROS production and subsequently inactivates AP-1 in endothelial cells (Lin et al., 2004) . Structurally distinct antioxidants have been shown to inhibit the expression of NF-\u03baB-and AP-1-dependent cytokines, iNOS and COX-2 and, thus, reduce inflammation (Comalada et al., 2006; Ma et al., 2003) . Therefore, it is suggested that the suppressive effects of these antioxidant compounds on the production of the associated inflammatory mediators are related with their antioxidant activities.",

It is likely that the LPS induced NF-\u03baB activation via the generation of ROS and possible that luteolin, through scavenging of ROS, may mediate suppression of NF-\u03baB and/or AP-1 signaling, thus reducing the level of downstream products (including TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, iNOS and COX-2) in alveolar MH-S macrophages.

It has been reported that LPS stimulated NF-\u03baB activation through the phosphorylation and degradation of I\u03baB by increasing IKK or Akt kinase activity (Ardeshna et al., 2000) . Studies by Ozes et al. and Madrid et al. showed that a signaling pathway culminating in phosphorylation both IKK\u03b1 and \u03b2 by Akt are necessary for activation of NF-\u03baB (Madrid et al., 2001; Ozes et al., 1999) . Our results show that luteolin significantly decreases the phosphorylation of Akt on Ser473 and Thr308 and IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 on Ser176/180 (Fig. 6 ) similarly to results obtained with LY294002, and this inhibitory event is accompanied by the suppression of I\u03baB degradation and NF-\u03baB p65 subunit nuclear translocation in alveolar MH-S macrophages, indicating that Akt and IKK inactivation might be involved in luteolin-mediated anti-inflammatory actions.

            "text": "Luteolin belongs to the flavonoid family of compounds. Flavonoids are composed of two aromatic rings linked through three carbon atoms that form an oxygenated heterocycle. Variations in the basic structure of flavonoids yield different classes of flavonoids. The structure variations may mediate the differences in the bioactivity of these related compounds. Xagorari and co-workers used RAW 264.7 macrophages to evaluate the effect of flavonoids on macrophage physiology. Their results showed that among the tested flavonoids, quercetin and luteolin are the most active compounds in reducing the action of LPS on pro-inflammatory cytokine release in macrophage and luteolin showed a lower IC50 than quercetin (Xagorari et al., 2001) . These data are in line with the findings of Comalada et al. (2006) who showed that luteolin and quercetin effectively inhibited LPS-stimulated TNF-\u03b1 release in primary bone marrow-derived macrophages. Analysis of the structure-activity relationship showed that four hydroxylations at positions 5, 7, 3\u2032 and 4\u2032, together with the double bond at C2-C3 and the position of the B ring at 2, seem to be necessary for the highest anti-inflammatory effect. The major determinants of antioxidative capacity have been classically considered to be the presence of a catechol group in the B ring, the presence of a 3-OH group, and the C2-C3 double bond (Silva et al., 2002) . Consistent with this, our preliminary study also showed that luteolin is more potent than baicalein in suppression of LPSinduced macrophage activation. The anti-inflammatory capacity of flavonoids has long been put to use in Chinese medicine as crude plant extracts. Some flavonoids have been found to inhibit chronic inflammation in animal models (Camuesco et al., 2004; Kawaguchi et al., 2004) . Current clinical approaches showed that flavonoids are promising anti-inflammatory drugs. However, the pharmacokinetic characteristics of flavonoids have to be considered before these agents may be used successfully in vivo. Most flavonoids are found glycosylated in plants and cannot be absorbed by the intestinal epithelium in that form. Hydrolysis of the glycosides by the intestinal flora yields free flavonoids that are absorbed efficiently. Comalada et al. suggested that flavonoids must be administered orally in glycosidic form in order to be applied as anti-inflammatory agents (Comalada et al., 2006) .",
