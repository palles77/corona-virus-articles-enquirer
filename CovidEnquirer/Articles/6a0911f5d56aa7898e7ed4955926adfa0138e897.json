Several outbred and inbred strains are available. Husbandry considerations include noninjurious housing, appropriate food, prevention of intraspecies aggression, environmental stability, and reproductive aspects, including a long gestation. Although guinea pigs are susceptible to a wide range of diseases, current breeding and LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE, 2nd edition housing conditions have reduced greatly many spontaneous infectious diseases in these animals. Diseases of concern that do occur in research colonies may include respiratory diseases and Hystricomorpha (porcupine-like rodents). The domestic guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) is classified as a New World hystricomorph rodent belonging to the family Caviidae. Although recent investigations involving DNA sequencing question the traditional phylogenetic position of the guinea pig, evidence suggesting that the Hystricomorpha be reclassified outside Rodentia is controversial and inconclusive. Further work in this area needs to be done (Wolf et al., 1993; Cao et al., 1997) .",

Guinea pigs move, rest, and often eat in groups (Manning et al., 1984) . In a cage, they will align themselves along the outside perimeter, end to end, with young pups near the end of the line.

Relaxin is responsible for the loosening of the fibrocartilaginous pelvic symphysis. During the last week of gestation, the separation increases to 3 cm (Zarrow, 1947) . Sows do not build nests. Young are delivered quickly, generally at night, with pups being born every 3 to 7 min and completion of parturition in 30 min. The sow cleans the pups and eats the placentas. Boars also will eat placentas. Like female rabbits, sows do not retrieve their young. Pups approach the mother, sometimes crawling under her, and initiate nursing (Harper, 1976; Hennessy and Jenkins, 1994) . Large litters (3 or more) are associated with a higher incidence of stillbirths. It is rare for a sow to eat stillborn pups. Dystocia can occur in obese sows, sows bred for the first time after 7 months of age, and in sows with large fetuses (Hisaw et al., 1944) . The primary cause of dystocia is usually the inability of the fetus to pass through the confining birth canal. If a cesarean section is attempted, it must be done quickly because of anoxia. Young guinea pigs can survive anoxia for only a few minutes in the isolated uterus. Partially extruded young can be gently pushed or pulled through the tract. Fetal membranes should be removed from the face (Manning et al., 1984) .",

Bordetella bronchiseptica is a common commensal organism in many species, including guinea pigs, rats, rabbits, mice, dogs, swine, cats, turkeys, and primates. The organism is a short, gram-negative rod or coccobacillus, aerobic, motile, and non-spore-forming, as are all gram-negative bacilli. Growth in vitro is best at 30~ but is slow to poor at 37 ~ C, with circular, pearlescent colonies minute at 24 hr and maximum at 72 hr. Colonies are embedded in the media and are surrounded variably by a zone of [3-hemolysis (Ganaway, 1976; Boot et al., 1994) . Immunologic studies (Wullenweber and Boot, 1994) and macrorestriction digestion of DNA techniques, as well as evidence of phenotypic modulation of surface components, provide evidence for serotypic variation within the species. The organism variably dissociates in culture (isogenic mutation), and these isolates vary in hemolysin, dermonecrotoxin, proteases, adenylate cyclase, and hemagglutinin production, which may affect host specificity, virulence, and disease manifestation (Griffith et al., 1996) .",

Although several bacterial and some viral agents may cause acute bronchopneumonia in guinea pigs, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, S. zooepidemicus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and adenovirus, Bordetella infection is the most common clinical diagnosis. Definitive diagnosis is through swabbing of the lumen of the bronchi or lower trachea (presumably in dead animals) and aerobic culture on sheep blood and MacConkey's agar. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) serologic testing are more sensitive than is culture for detecting the organism, but various Bordetella antigenic variants should be used in serologic testing because of organism variations described above (Wullenweber and Boot, 1994) .",

Dams pass the organism to their young. In acute cases, gross lesions include an acute enteritis and mucosal ulceration with miliary, creamcolored nodules in the intestinal wall. In the subacute to chronic form, lymph nodes, spleen, liver, lung, and bone marrow contain gray-white, ovoid nodules ranging in size from a few millimeters to 2 to 3 cm. Palpation detects enlarged peripheral nodes. Microscopically, the lesions contain dead cells, inflammatory cells, and blood vessels with bacterial emboli. More chronic lesions are granulomas that do not calcify (Obwolo, 1977; Percy and Barthold, 1993) .

Escherichia coli, not a normal intestinal inhabitant in guinea pigs, may proliferate in an antibiotic-caused dysbiosis and cause deaths (Farrar and Kent, 1965) . Antibiotics most often implicated are the aminopenicillins, cephalosporins, clindamycin, streptomycin, and lincomycin. Penicillin at dosages as low as 2000 U or ampicillin at dosages over 6 mg/kg q8 hr for 8 days are known to cause deaths (Lowe et al., 1980; Young et al., 1987) . A mechanism for loss of colonization resistance may involve effects on microbial populations, accumulation of excessive carbohydrates and reduced short-chain fatty acids, followed by growth or toxin production of organisms that utilize those metabolites (Clausen, 1998) .

Other causes of similar signs include pantothenic acid or vitamin C deficiencies, crytosporidiosis, bacterial enteropathies, and coronavirus infection. Prevention is through good husbandry, reduction of stress, good sanitation, and provision of fresh, appropriate feed. Reduction of stress during shipping and reducing animal density in cages are essential also. Treatment involves use of sulfonamides with known anti-Eimeria activity and provision of adequate vitamin C. Any study involving young guinea pigs can be compromised when animals do not thrive, shed infectious organisms, and have intestinal lesions.",

The fungi solubilize keratin with proteases, which produces the scale accumulation on and around the lesion and the loosening and weakening of the hair shaft. The dermatophyte penetrates the stratum corneum or invades hair follicles. Growth continues down the hair shaft to the keratogenous zone until the growth inward equals hair-growth rate outward (Medlean and Ristic, 1992) . vi. Differential diagnoses. Several conditions cause or are related to hair loss in guinea pigs, including protein and caloric deficiency, chewing and barbering, bacterial dermatopathies (e.g., Staphylococcus and Streptococcus), cystic ovary effects, acariasis, and continuous breeding. The irregularly shaped, nonpruritic, flaky-skin lesions on the face, recovery of the organism from hair and epithelial debris on Sabouraud's dextrose agar or dermatophyte test media (DTM), or observation (in vitro) of species-characteristic morphologic features and macroconidia in Microsporum (or microconidia in Trichophyton) provide a genus diagnosis (Sprouse, 1976; McAleer, 1980; Harvey, 1995) . Epithelial debris and hair are best obtained by vigorous brushing with a toothbrush. Culture of the fungus is the most reliable diagnostic method, and growth usually occurs within 10 days (Medlean and Ristic, 1992) .",

Malnutrition and its consequences are much more common in pet guinea pigs than in research animals. Marginal deficiencies, however, are more common in some research colonies, and the consequences are increased susceptibility to infectious disease, especially streptococcal infections and enteropathies. Signs of conjunctivitis or upper respiratory disease should always suggest a marginal vitamin C deficiency, and treatment should include vitamin C supplementation. Signs frequently associated with many specific dietary deficiencies are failure to gain weight, weight loss, rough hair coat, pale mucous membranes, lethargy, anemia, and various signs of opportunistic infectious disease. Induced nutritional disorders are listed in Table IV. 1. Hypovitaminosis C a. Etiology. Hypovitaminosis C, known also as scorbutus or scurvy, is a multisystemic disease occurring in the small number of species that lack the genetic code to produce the hepatic enzyme L-gulonolactone oxidase. This enzyme converts L-gulonolactone into the isomers L-ascorbate (AH) and L-dehydroascorbic acid (DHA) (Marcus and Coulston, 1990) . Hepatocytes convert normally extracellular DHA into extracellular AH, which may contribute to vitamin C homeostasis (Upstonet al., 1999) . Probable primary roles of vitamin C are acting as a cofactor in hydroxylation and amidation reactions by transferring electrons to enzymes that provide reducing equivalents (i.e., protons) and scavenging both intracellularly and extracellulary superoxide radicals and singlet oxygen, whose activity results in tissue damage (Chakrabarty et al., 1992) . It maintains vitamin E in vitro by reducing a-tocopherol radicals. Vitamin C is carried in leukocytes and (30%) in erythrocytes.",

The circulatory form begins, presumably, from abnormal vascular changes that lead to ischemia of the uteroplacental unit; and the nutritional form progresses from hypoglycemia and hyperlipidemia (Seidl et al., 1979) . Given, however, the many similarities between the pathogenesis and consequences of the two forms, there may be a common pathogenesis, perhaps involving generalized endothelial dysfunction related to maternal responses to fetal antigens, vasoconstriction due to chemical factors, or triglyceride effects on endothelial cells.",

Timely intervention with cool water baths, corticosteroids, and parenteral fluids may prevent deaths (Schaeffer and Donnelly, 1996) . groom young (and nibble around eyes and ears) or when weanlings chew the sow's hair. Particularly severe chewing occurs with intermale competition for food, water, toys, or space; within dominant-submissive relationships; and with sows and with boars on young. Self-barbering also occurs.",

Failure of the fibrocartilaginous joint to separate occurs most commonly in a sow bred for the first time over 7 months of age. Signs of dystocia include a still-narrow symphysis as gestation nears day 73, straining, depression, and vaginal discharge. Prevention involves breeding first before 7 months of age, preventing obesity and fasting while pregnant, and removing animals with a known family history of dystocias. Young guinea pigs involved in a dystocia experience hypoxia, which is a dangerous condition for newborns.

Histologic abnormalities included osteophytes, calcification of collateral ligaments of the joint, and degeneration of weight-bearing, articular surfaces. In addition to genetic predisposition, joint injury, hypovitaminosis C, and obesity may contribute to joint degeneration. Wei et al.

Ergot produces the alkaloids ergotamine and ergometrine, which damage the capillary epithelium and lead to thrombosis and necrosis. The fungus germinates when the grasses flower. Kirsch (1997) described a guinea pig that had eaten leaves from Nerium oleander and exhibited seizures, bloating, and cardiac dysrythmia. Following intensive care with sodium pentobarbital, heat, lactated Ringer's solution, furosamide, activated carbon, glucose, diazepam, and vitamin C, the guinea pig recovered within 24 hr of presentation.

Examination of the eye is accomplished best using a 20-diopter (D) or 30-D indirect condensing lens. Fluorescein dye, exfoliative conjunctival examination, and culture are diagnostic methods.",

Such concerns, some of which were described previously, include hair chewing, skin biting, ear nibbling, trampiing of young by stampeding groups in a square cage, boars climbing from pen to pen, and males being aggressive toward each other. Guinea pigs are fastidious eaters and do not adapt well to changes in many aspects of their food and water and in how each is presented. Because guinea pigs \"imprint\" food type (and water taste) early in life, they may not recognize other foods, including powdered diets, water additives, and vegetable supplements. Placing powder in an agar matrix or blending foods during a transition does allow food changes. Guinea pigs scatter food and dribble water from sipper tubes, which makes measuring consumption difficult (Harper, 1976; Harkness and Wagner, 1995) .",
