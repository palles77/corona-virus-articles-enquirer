Forecasting demand for such a mega-event has received only limited attention in the literature. Unlike most studies forecasting international tourism demand, forecasting Expo demand involves using both quantitative forecasting models and qualitative technique because of data limitations. Combining quantitative techniques with willingness-to-visit (WTV) surveys predicts the Expo demand at 8.9 million visitors. In comparison using the Delphi method, experts predict Expo demand at 6.8 million visitors. For this study, the Delphi method provides more conservative estimates than estimates from combining quantitative techniques with WTV. Policy implications presented are directed toward Expo planners and practitioners in terms of demand and supply side, application of these results in the decision-making process, and future challenges surrounding demand forecasting. r",

Investments in tourism infrastructures require huge financial commitments from both the public and private sectors. More accurate forecasts provide better estimates of expected return on investments, which help guide investment decisions . Specifically, forecasting demand for an international tourism Expo is not only important in the bidding process among international competitors, but also is necessary to help gain public support for hosting the mega-event and determine the expected benefits and costs associated with hosting the event. In the planning stage, forecasting tourism demand is prerequisite to determine factors impacting investment decisions such as the capacity of the Expo site and facilities, necessary road and transportation system expansions, and appropriate food and lodging facilities. Accurate forecasts of tourism demand, therefore, not only help the event planners ensure the successful hosting of an Expo, but also provide them with considerable information to guide their investment decisions (Lee, 1996) .",

            "text": "Quantitative techniques are used for forecasting tourism demand when information on past tourism can be quantified and past patterns can reasonably be assumed to continue into the future (Makridakis & Wheelwright, 1978) . Two main quantitative approaches used are time series and causal or explanatory models. Time-series models use historical data patterns to generate future forecasts. Commonly used time-series models in tourism research are exponential smoothing (Burger et al., 2001; Geurts & Ibrahim, 1975 Lim & McAleer, 2001) and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models (Burger et al., 2001; Cho, 2003; Goh & Law, 2002; Kim & Moosa, 2005; Kulendran & Witt, 2003a , 2003b Li et al., 2005; Lim, 2002; Lim & McAleer, 2002) . Geurts and Ibrahim (1975) compared a Box-Jenkins (ARIMA) model with a Brown exponential smoothing model in the context of Hawaiian tourism demand. Results indicate that both the Box-Jenkins and the exponential smoothing models performed equally well in terms of forecasting accuracy, but the latter may be preferred because it is easier to use. Geurts and Ibrahim (1982) demonstrate that the forecasting accuracy of Hawaiian tourism was greatly improved after accounting for atypical months and if the forecasts were updated annually. Burger et al. (2001) compared na\u0131\u00a8ve, moving average (MA), ARIMA, decomposition, and exponential smoothing time-series models in forecasting the US demand for travel to Durban, South Africa. They indicate that in terms of accuracy the exponential smoothing model performed best, followed by na\u0131\u00a8ve, ARIMA, and MA models. The decomposition method performance was inferior to the other models. Lim and McAleer (2001) show the Holt-Winters seasonal exponential smoothing models outperformed both the single and double exponential smoothing models in predicting tourist arrivals to Australia. Lim (2002) employed ARIMA models to forecast international tourism demand for Australia. Their results show that the ARIMA models outperformed the seasonal ARIMA models for forecasting demand from Hong Kong and Malaysia tourists, but demand from Singapore tourists was better forecasted using the seasonal ARIMA model. Goh and Law (2002) found that ARIMA models with seasonality and interventions performed better than other time-series models, because the ARIMA Intervention model reflected the impacts from special events. Cho (2003) predicted tourism demand from different countries to Hong Kong using three time-series models, exponential smoothing, ARIMA, and artificial neural networks. Results indicate the artificial network model outperformed the smoothing and ARIMA models. Cho (2003) , however, suggested that ARIMA and smoothing models were also sufficiently adequate for forecasting tourism demand. Kulendran and Witt (2003b) indicate the ARIMA model was more accurate than the error correction model (ECM) for short-term forecasts; however, the ECM outperformed the ARIMA for long-term forecasts.",

Economic-based causal models have been used in forecasting tourism demand , particularly when identifying important explanatory variables affecting international tourism demand is an objective (Crouch, 1994; Lim, 1999; Uysal & Cromption, 1984) . Income is often identified as the single most important determinant of international tourism demand (Artus, 1972; Barry & O'Hagan, 1972; Crouch, 1994; Di Matteo & Di Matteo, 1993; Gray, 1966; Jud & Joseph, 1974; Laber, 1969; Lee, 1996; Lee, Var, & Blaine, 1996; Loeb, 1982; Sheldon, 1993; Stronge & Redman, 1982; Uysal & Cromption, 1984; Witt & Martin, 1987) . Relative prices are also found to be significant as a determinant of demand for international tourism (Barry & O'Hagan, 1972; Crouch, 1992; Han, Durbarry, & Sinclair, 2006; Lee et al., 1996; Loeb, 1982; Quayson & Var, 1982; Uysal & Cromption, 1984; Witt & Witt, 1990) . Other variables such as exchange rate (Artus, 1972; Gerakis, 1965; Lee et al., 1996; Uysal & Cromption, 1984) and marketing aspects (Barry & O'Hagan, 1972; Crouch, 1994; Lee, 1996; Uysal & Cromption, 1984) are often found to be significant explanatory variables. Li et al. (2005) observed recent development in econometric models based on overview of past research in terms of model specifications, major determinants, and test of forecasting accuracy. They suggest increased understanding of international tourism demand could be achieved by applying advanced econometric models, such as timevarying parameter (TVP) models (Li, Wong, Song, & Witt, 2006) , vector autoregressive (VAR) models , Bayesian VAR (Wong, Song, & Chon, 2006) , and almost ideal demand systems (AIDS) (Han et al., 2006) .",

Qualitative techniques include the Delphi method, which was first applied by Dalkey and Helmer (1963) . Being dependent upon the accumulated experience of experts, this method assembles a panel of experts from disciplines to obtain a group consensus concerning the likely outcome of future events (Archer, 1987) . This method assumes that the range of responses will decrease as convergence is achieved toward the midrange of the distribution (Kaynak & Macaulay, 1984) . One example of the use of the Delphi model is Liu (1988) . Liu predicted Hawaiian tourism demand for 2000 using two separate panels, local tourist receivers and overseas tourist senders. Forecasts of tourism demand made by both local and outside experts were generally consistent with state projections. Lee and Kim (1998) also used the Delphi model for predicting international tourism demand for World Cup games in Korea. Forecasts made by the panel members were 456,000 attendees to the 2002 World Cup which is slightly higher than the actual tourists arrivals of 403,000 (Korea National Tourism Organization, 2006) during the World Cup. Prideaux, Laws, and Faulkner (2003) assert that qualitative methods such as Delphi are useful because quantitative techniques such as time-series and econometric models use historical data that may not contain information on future events, thus their uncertainty in the future. Qualitative forecasting techniques such as the Delphi model are particularly suitable for long-term forecasting when changes of a large and unprecedented nature are taken into consideration by forecasting experts (Archer, 1987; Liu, 1988; Var & Lee, 1993) .",

Accuracy is frequently the criterion used for selecting the ''best'' forecasting model (Burger, et al., 2001; Li et al., 2005; Lim & McAleer, 2002) . Empirical studies show that forecasts from complex and statistically sophisticated methods are not necessarily more accurate than forecasts from relatively simple methods (Makridakis, 1986; Lim & McAleer, 2002) . Martin and Witt (1989) indicate that econometric models may not be more accurate than time-series models in terms of forecasts. Van Doorn (1984) maintains that the use of simple forecasting models proved more accurate than complex models. Ascher (1978, p. 199 ) also observed, ''The presumed advantages of sophisticated methodologies simply have not materialized.'' For this reason, Calantone et al. (1987) stressed that complex model building should not be undertaken for its own sake. Li et al. (2006) correctly assert that there is no single forecasting model that performs better than the others in all cases because many factors influence forecasting performance. Although many studies indicate that relatively simple methods often outperform sophisticated or complex models, debate on the performance between simple and complex models in terms of forecasting accuracy is still ongoing.",

RMSE has also limitation in terms of less intuitive (Ascher, 1978) . MAPE has been preferred by many researchers (Burger et al., 2001; Cho, 2003; Chu, 1998; Kulendran & Witt, 2003b; Wheelwright & Makridakis, 1985) , because it is expressed as a percentage of actual values over predicted values.

Three time-series models, seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) Intervention, Winters, and Trend Regression model, are used to forecast foreign tourists demand for the Expo. The SARIMA Intervention model incorporates seasonal fluctuations, as well as, the impacts of the following events, IMF (Asian Financial) Crisis, 9/11 terrorism, FIFA World Cup, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). Using three levels of smoothing, the Winters model is estimated to represent smoothing type models. Finally, the Trend model, which also includes variables for the impact of the above events, represents one of the simplest possible model formulations. In the second step, WTV is estimated from an on-site survey for foreign tourists (see Survey design and data collection section). Finally, Expo demand by foreign tourists is forecasted by multiplying predicted number of foreign tourists by the WTV estimated from the survey data.",

Because the ARMA model requires stationary data, non-stationary data are differenced (integrated) to make the data stationary (Makridakis, Wheelwright, & Hyndman, 1998) . In this case, model becomes the ARIMA model. Non-stationarity indicates that mean and variance of a series are not constant through time and autocovariance of the series is time varying (Enders, 1995) .

The PACF has prominent spikes at lags (2, 4, and 8), which suggest seasonal and non-seasonal autoregressive processes. The ACF and PACF functions from both seasonal and non-seasonal differenced series suggest three tentative SARIMA Intervention models (2,1,0)(2,1,0) 4 , (1,1,0) (2,1,0) 4 , and (2,1,0)(1,1,0) 4 . Both the Akaike information criterion (AIC) (Akaike, 1974) and Schwarz Bayesian criterion (SBC) (Schwarz, 1978) are employed to select the best SARIMA Intervention model. Being loss functions, the model with the smallest value for AIC and SBC is selected as the best model. The SARIMA Intervention model (2,1,0)(2,1,0) 4 had the lowest AIC and SBC values, therefore it is deemed the best SARIMA model (Table 3) . Table 3 , in the SARIMA (2,1,0)(2,1,0) 4 model, the seasonal and nonseasonal terms are statistically significant at po0.01 All interventions variables are statistically significant at po0.05 and have the expected signs. IMF (Asian Financial) Crisis and World Cup coefficients are positive, whereas terrorism and SARS are negative. Estimations were performed using SPSS Statistical Program (version 12.0). The residual ACF of the SARIMA (2,1,0)(2,1,0) 4 Intervention model has no spikes at all lags (Fig. 3) . Further, the Box-Ljung Q-statistics (Box & Pierce, 1970) are not statistically significant at every lag indicating that the probability that the residual autocorrelations are not white noise is less than 5% (Dharmaratne, 1995) . The SARIMA model has accurate within sample forecasts (Fig. 4) with a MAPE of 4.5%. Given the model satisfies the above diagnostic criteria and provides accurate forecasts, we conclude that the SARIMA (2,1,0)(2,1,0) 4 Intervention model is appropriate. Using a recursive forecasting approach, the SARIMA Intervention model forecasted approximately 2 million potential foreign visitors for the 3rd quarter of 2012, the quarter the Expo is to be held (Table 4) .",

The distance between origin and destination has been discussed in gravity models as deterrent factor to traveling (Cesario, 1973; Reece, 2001; Vanhove, 1980; Var & Lee, 1993) . The WTV results support this finding from the gravity models. This study did not attempt to forecast domestic populations, but rather used existing population forecasts from the Korea National Statistical Office. Breaking down the forecast for the Expo by adult and adolescent visitor gives an estimate of 6.7 million adult visitors and 1.7 million adolescent visitors. Total visitors are forecasted at approximately 8.9 million people including 0.5 million foreign tourists.",

Experts in the Delphi method predicted lower demand for the Expo than the combined quantitative techniques with WTV surveys. Both methods have merit and only time will tell which estimates are closest.",

An official of b Willingness-to-visit (WTV) the Expo, percentage people indicating they were either likely to visit or very likely to visit based on the national survey (see Table 5 ). c Adolescents to be accompanied by parent, dividing adolescent population by population age 30-49. , 2006) . Twenty-two million people attended the 2005 Aichi Expo in Japan over 6 months, which is 7 million more visitors than the sponsors expected to attend (Aichi Expo Organizing Committee, 2006) . The number of visitors to both of these previous Expos is higher than even the most optimistic demand forecast for the Yeosu Expo. One potential reason is both the Daejon Expo and the Aichi Expo were held in areas that have relatively larger population bases than the Yeosu area. Another reason is there are two types of Expos, one held for 3 months and the other for 6 months. The Aichi Expo lasted 6 months as compared to 3 months planned for the Yeosu Expo. These comparisons between past Expos and forecasted demand, along with experts' opinions further suggest that distance and capacities of hosting city are significant factors determining demand for Expos. From a practical standpoint, results from forecasting the Expo demand are useful for the planners and policymakers. First, forecasts of the Expo demand are important in the bidding process of the international tourism Expo. One selection criteria of the host city is the magnitude of demand, as well as the appropriateness of the forecasting methods used. Second, forecasts of Expo demand may not only help generate public support, but are also important to help avoid shortages or surpluses in the tourism businesses (Burger et al., 2001) . The forecasts of the Expo demand provide managers with planning infrastructure, such as magnitude of Expo site and facilities, number of hotel rooms, expansion of road and transportation system, etc. These infrastructures are highly dependent upon estimates of tourism demand because they require huge financial investment from private and public sectors. Edgell and Seely (1980) insist that tourism is based on both demand-and supply-side in the managerial and practical points of view. The forecasted demand of between 6.8 and 8.9 million visitors will not be realized unless the capacity of accommodations, road and transportation system, and Expo site can meet this demand. An engineering company which is responsible for the site planning for the Expo unofficially predicted that the Expo site is able to accommodate approximately 8 million visitors in terms of the capacity of site and road system. The higher estimates of Expo demand predicted by quantitative approaches with WTV appeared to slightly exceed the supply-side, whereas the smaller estimates of Expo demand predicted by the Delphi method is within the supply-side capabilities.",
