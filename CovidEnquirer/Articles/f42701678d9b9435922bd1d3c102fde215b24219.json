These factors have not only contributed to the disparate health status of the region's diverse populations, but also to the diverse nature of its health systems, which are at varying stages of evolution. Rapid but inequitable socioeconomic development, coupled with diff ering rates of demographic and epidemiological transitions, have accentuated health disparities and posed great public health challenges for national health systems, particularly the control of emerging infectious diseases and the rise of non-communicable diseases within ageing populations. While novel forms of health care are evolving in the region, such as corporatised public health-care systems (government owned, but operating according to corporate principles and with private-sector participation) and fi nancing mechanisms to achieve universal coverage, there are key lessons for health reforms and decentralisation. New challenges have emerged with rising trade in health services, migration of the health workforce, and medical tourism. Juxtaposed between the emerging giant economies of China and India, countries of the region are attempting to forge a common regional identity, despite their diversity, to seek mutually acceptable and eff ective solutions to key regional health challenges. In this fi rst paper in the Lancet Series on health in southeast Asia, we present an overview of key demographic and epidemiological changes in the region, explore challenges facing health systems, and draw attention to the potential for regional collaboration in health.",

The Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam are major labour-exporters, whereas Malaysia and Thailand both receive and send nationals abroad. Besides this internal labour market, countries in southeast Asia also send and receive migrants from outside the region. Since the 1980s, however, destinations within Asia have replaced labour migration to countries such as the USA and to the Middle East. 26 There is signifi cant undocumented or illegal migration as well as movement of displaced people in the region. 27, 28 These groups are particularly vulnerable since \"[u]ndocumented migrants are disproportionately more exposed to health risks due to inadequate working conditions and irregular movements, but are unlikely to seek medical attention because of their status, and are also often left out of assistance programmes in times of disasters and emergencies\". 27",

These trends are in turn aff ected by economic, social, cultural, and political developments. Singapore and Thailand have among the fastest ageing populations in the world, with the proportion of elderly residents projected to double from 7% to 14% in 19 and 22 years, respectively-shorter than the 26 years expected for Japan 29-31 because of more rapid fertility reduction in these two countries. With increasing longevity, the pace of increase in numbers of the oldest old, aged 80 years and older, in southeast Asia is projected to exceed that of east Asia over the period 2025-50. 32 The other major factor contributing to population ageing has been the decrease in mortality. Figure 4 shows estimated trends in risk of child death (ie, between birth and age 5 years) in countries of the region during the past four decades. Child survival has improved substantially in all countries, but particularly in Indonesia, Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia, Brunei, and Singapore, where the risk of child death is now typically less than about 0\u00b75%, compared with 15-20% in the 1970s. 13 Measured by the risk of dying between ages 15 and 60 years, regional diversity in levels of adult mortality is even greater than for child mortality (fi gure 5). Typically, the risk of dying at these ages for men is 20-30%, and is higher (32%) in Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar (26-27%), and signifi cantly lower in Singapore, where the level is similar to those in Australia and Japan (7-8%). This regional diversity in risk of adult death is similar for women, but with rates typically 20-30% less than those for men. 15",

Modern medical technology is available in the world market but at costs higher than most of the region's population can aff ord. Many traditional health practices persist alongside the use of new medical technologies and pharmaceutical products, presenting regulatory problems in terms of safety and quality. With increasing educational levels, ageing populations, and growing consciousness of human rights in the recently developing democratic environment, the demand for better care is increasing. Health systems in the region face more serious adjustment problems than ever before. 51 Health services have become an important industry, with a mix of public and private non-profi t and for-profi t actors, along with the growth of trade and medical tourism. The provision, fi nancing, and regulatory functions of the public sector have to adapt accordingly to these transformations. The need to restructure healthcare delivery and fi nancing systems becomes crucial to balance new demand and supply equilibriums. 52, 53 Countries in southeast Asia and their health system reforms can thus be categorised according to the stages of development of their health-care systems. A typology of common issues, challenges, and priorities are generated for the diverse mix of health systems of southeast Asia at diff erent stages of socioeconomic development (see webappendix pp 5-8). The pressures placed on national health-care systems by the recent demographic and epidemiological transitions that we have described are amplifi ed by the growing demands of an increasingly educated and affl uent population for high quality health care and the supply of the latest medical technology. Before the east Asian fi nancial crisis in 1997-98 and the recent global economic recession, an expanding middle class in the urban populations of the larger cities pushed their demand for high quality care into a booming private sector. As a result, market forces have turned many aspects of health care into a new industry in countries such as Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand, contributing to labour-force distortions for the production and distribution of health workers both within and across countries.",

While they were each fi nding ways to reform their health systems, the Asian fi nancial crisis in 1997-98 posed more challenges for countries of the region. The depreciation of local currencies resulted in increased costs of imported drugs and other essential supplies, at the same time as access to basic health care was reduced for the most vulnerable population groups. 54 However, reported spikes in suicides and mental illnesses in the other aff ected east Asian economies such as South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong were not as signifi cant in southeast Asia. 55 Following the lessons learnt from the past fi nancial crisis, most countries have strengthened their social protection mechanisms and essential health services. There is a greater push among countries to increase universal coverage of basic health services, especially to vulnerable and disadvantaged populations. 56, 57 Throughout the region, many innovative pro-poor fi nancing schemes were implemented, such as the Health Card and 30-baht Schemes in Thailand, the Health Fund for the Poor in Vietnam, Health Equity Funds in Cambodia and Laos, and, even in affl uent Singapore, the Medifund, a meanstested hospital fees subsidy scheme for indigent patients.",

However, crucial issues involve rising costs, future sustainability of centralised tax-fi nanced systems, effi ciency and quality of the public services, and higher public expectations. In both Malaysia and Singapore, the health-care systems are changing from government-dominated health services towards greater private-sector involvement. Attempts to privatise public hospitals have been controversial, thus resulting in many hybrid forms of corporatised entities that continue to be controlled or subsidised by governments. [58] [59] [60] [61] Some of the most innovative and advanced forms of publicprivate mix in health services have developed within the region, for example the restructuring or corporatisation of public hospitals in Singapore from as early as 1985 and the later Swadana (self-fi nancing) hospitals in Indonesia. 62 With the anticipated rise in the ageing population and future problems of intergenerational funding through pay-as-you-go mechanisms, there are experiments with new health-care fi nancing such as compulsory medical savings and social insurance for long term care. [63] [64] [65] Some countries such as the Philippines, Vietnam, and Indonesia have radically decentralised their health-care systems with the devolution of health services to local governments, a restructuring that has aff ected aspects of systems performance and equity even though the impetus for Cardiovascular diseases excluding RHD Breast cancer Tuberculosis Road traffic accidents decentralisation was mainly political. 66 Consequently, to ensure increased fi nancial coverage and aff ordability, many governments have passed laws to establish national health insurance systems and mandated universal coverage, although implementation is problematic. With existing policies of decentralisation and liberalisation, equity issues and poor infrastructure will continue to challenge the development of the health sector. 57,67",

This cooper ation has occurred via two channels-direct bilateral collaboration by individual countries (ministries of health and foreign aff airs) and those under the aegis of ASEAN. The Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance project is an example of successful health cooperation. It was established under the collective agreement of each Ministry of Health of member states of the Greater Mekong subregion to share important public health information. The emergence of infl uenza A H5N1 and H1N1 outbreaks has led to common eff orts to strengthen epidemiological surveillance and stockpiling of antiviral drugs. Enthusiasm for regional economic collaboration continues to grow, evident from the explicit goal of the ASEAN Free Trade Area to increase the region's competitive advantage as a production base geared towards the world market. ASEAN leaders have identifi ed health care as a priority sector for region-wide integration. From an economic perspective, opening of health-care markets promises substantial economic gains. At the same time, however, this process could also intensify existing challenges in promotion of equitable access to health care within countries. It could also lead to undesirable outcomes whereby only the better-off will receive benefi ts from the liberalisation of trade policy in health.",

Tobacco use is the major preventable cause of non-communicable disease and death among the populations of ASEAN countries. 68 All ASEAN members except Indonesia have embraced the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) 69 and all countries endorse some form of tobacco control policy. However, most of these states are, to varying degrees, still involved in investment in or promotion of the tobacco industry, often using the justifi cation of poverty alleviation. There are clear contradictions inherent in the state seeking to prevent tobacco use in the interests of health, while actively promoting tobacco for the economic benefi t of its population, resulting in both substantial and symbolic harm to eff orts to implement the FCTC. 70 For example, tobacco production is legitimised; rational policy principles are violated, and direct cooperation between the state and multinational tobacco corporations is made possible by modifi cation of control policies. Tobacco exports within ASEAN also threaten the group's health solidarity. Divestiture of state ownership of capital in tobacco corporations 71 and a much stronger commitment by states to control the use and promotion of tobacco are urgently required in ASEAN countries.",

Indonesia has called for the urgent development of a new system for virus access and a fair and equitable sharing of the benefi ts arising from the use of the infl uenza virus in research (now commonly referred to as viral sovereignty). Additionally, Indonesia has pressed for the development of medical products to replace the existing patent system in global health governance. 72 With globalisation, ensuring of accessible health services for citizens is no longer the sole responsibility of the state; health care in southeast Asia is fast becoming an industry in the world market. The private sectors in Singapore, Thailand, and Malaysia have capitalised on their comparative advantage to promote medical tourism and travel, combining health services for wealthy foreigners with recreational packages to boost consumption of such health services. Patients from elsewhere, including the developed countries, are choosing to travel for medical treatment, which is perceived to be high quality and value for money. Because of poor local economic conditions, the Philippines had a policy to export human resources for health to the world and to richer countries in the region as an income-generating mechanism. Although the fi nancial returns from this strategy seem substantial, equity issues have surfaced concerning the negative eff ects of international trade in health services and workforce migration on national health systems, especially in widening disparities in the rural-urban or public-private mix.",

Public policy in these countries cannot ignore such risks to health, which could have important social and economic consequences. Regional cooperation around disaster preparedness and in the surveillance of and health systems response to disease outbreaks has obvious advantages as a public health strategy. Concomi tantly, all countries in the region are faced with large or looming chronic disease epidemics. Even in the poorest populations of the region, non-communicable diseases already kill more people than do communicable, maternal, and perinatal conditions combined, with many of these deaths occurring before old age. Greatly strengthened health promotion and disease prevention strategies are an urgent priority if the impressive health gains of the past few decades in most countries of the region are to be replicated.
