Here, we developed a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated modified mRNA vaccine encoding the POWV prM and E genes and demonstrated its immunogenicity and efficacy in mice following immunization with one or two doses. The POWV mRNA vaccine induced high titers of neutralizing antibody and sterilizing immunity against lethal challenge with different POWV strains. The mRNA vaccine also induced cross-neutralizing antibodies against multiple other tick-borne flaviviruses and protected mice against the distantly related Langat virus. These data demonstrate the utility of the LNP-mRNA",

POWV lineage I strains are predominantly maintained in Ixodes cookei ticks and include isolates from New York and Canada, whereas lineage II strains are found in Ixodes scapularis deer ticks and include strains from regions infested by these ticks (Ebel et al., 2001) . Because deer ticks are more aggressive at biting humans, lineage II viruses may have greater epidemic potential. Although POWV has been found predominantly in north-central and northeastern parts of the United States in Ixodes species ticks, POWV also has been isolated from Dermacentor andersoni ticks in Colorado (Thomas et al., 1960) , indicating the vector and geographical range may be larger than previously estimated.",

The mammalian TBFV group includes POWV and several other human pathogens, including tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), Omsk hemorrhagic fever virus (OHFV), Kyasanur forest disease virus (KFDV), and Alkhurma hemorrhagic fever virus (AHFV). Within their E proteins, the mammalian TBFV group shares R70% amino acid identity but only about 54%-60% identity with seabird TBFVs. One exception is Gadgets Gully virus (GGYV), which is more closely related to the mammalian TBFVs even though it causes infection of seabirds (Grard et al., 2007) . Vaccines have been developed against several mammalian TBFVs, although only TBEV vaccines have proven efficacy (Ishikawa et al., 2014) . TBEV vaccines induce antibodies capable of neutralizing closely related TBFVs, including OHFV, KFDV, and AHFV (McAuley et al., 2017) . However, TBEV immune sera had limited cross-neutralizing activity against the more distantly related POWV. No approved vaccines for POWV exist.",

We selected a vaccine platform that we developed for a distantly related flavivirus, Zika virus (ZIKV): a lipid nanoparticle (LNP)-encapsulated modified mRNA encoding the structural premembrane (prM) and E protein genes (Richner et al., 2017a) . Co-expression of the flavivirus structural proteins prM and E results in the secretion of subviral particles (SVPs) that share many functional and antigenic features with infectious virions and elicit neutralizing antibodies. SVPs are heterogeneous in size and likely display E proteins in distinct chemical environments, with the potential to affect epitope display Heinz et al., 1995; Kiermayr et al., 2009; Konishi and Fujii, 2002; Konishi et al., 1992) . In addition to selecting the POWV prM-E structural gene components, we used an mRNA platform, because some modified mRNA have been reported to enhance follicular helper T cell and germinal center B cell responses that are essential for inducing memory B cells and durable levels of neutralizing antibody (Pardi et al., 2018) .",

Although others have described murine models of POWV infection, these have been in juvenile mice (4-5 weeks old), which are not ideal for experiments requiring iterative immunization and resting periods (Hermance and Thangamani, 2015; Holbrook et al., 2005; Mlera et al., 2017; Santos et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2013) . Accordingly, we tested the ability of two POWV strains, LB (a lineage I strain) and Spooner (a lineage II DTV strain) to cause morbidity and mortality in wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 mice at 7 or 14 weeks of age. Following subcutaneous inoculation of 10 2 focus-forming units (FFU) of POWV LB, lethal infection ensued in 93% of 7-and 14-week-old mice, with a mean time to death of 8.6 and 9.5 days post-infection (dpi), respectively ( Figure 1A ). All mice inoculated with POWV LB lost approximately 15%-25% of their body weight ( Figure 1B ). POWV LB-infected mice exhibited ruffled fur, hunched posture, lethargy, and partial paralysis, Although ~50% of mice did not exhibit these signs before death ( Figure 1C ). In comparison, POWV Spooner resulted in lower mortality rates; 57% and 60% of 7-and 14-week-old mice succumbed to infection with mean times to death of 13.0 and 12.7 days, respectively ( Figure 1D ). Because of the partial lethality caused by POWV Spooner in WT mice, we created a more susceptible host by transiently blocking type I interferon (IFN) signaling with an anti-IFN receptor (Ifnar1) monoclonal anti-body (mAb), MAR1-5A3 (Sheehan et al., 2006) . When 0.5 mg of anti-Ifnar1 mAb was administered one day before infection, POWV Spooner resulted in 100% lethality, with a mean time to death of 9.7 days ( Figure 1D ). Whereas POWV Spooner-infected WT mice typically displayed ~ 15%-20% body weight loss, infected mice treated with anti-Ifnar1 mAb sustained greater weight loss of ~30% ( Figure 1E ). Most POWV Spooner-infected WT mice (70%-85%) displayed ruffled fur, hunched posture, and lethargy, with a minority developing limb paralysis ( Figure 1F ). In comparison, anti-Ifnar1 mAb-treated, POWV Spooner-infected mice uniformly displayed signs of morbidity before death.",

We designed a base-modified mRNA encoding the prM and E genes of POWV Spooner that was preceded by the prM signal sequence of POWV (POWV sig ) or signal sequence of JEV (JEV sig ); the latter heterologous JEV signal sequence was tested because for some flaviviruses, it results in enhanced secretion of SVPs (Davis et al., 2001; Dowd et al., 2016) . Six-week-old WT C57BL/6 mice were immunized with 10 \u03bcg of POWV sig , JEV sig , or placebo LNPs by intramuscular inoculation, followed by a second 10 mg booster dose 28 days later ( Figure 2A ). Serum was collected pre-boost on day 27 and post-boost on day 42, and neutralizing activity was assessed by reporter virus particle (RVP) assay using the C-prM-E proteins of the POWV lineage II strain P0375 and Raji-SIGNR cells (Mukherjee et al., 2014) . RVP technology has been used extensively in the preclinical and clinical evaluation of flavivirus vaccine candidates Emanuel et al., 2018; Gaudinski et al., 2018; Pardi et al., 2017; Richner et al., 2017a) . Following the first dose, the reciprocal mean titers that reduced RVP infection by 50% (50% maximal effective inhibitory concentration [EC 50 ]) values were 13,683 \u00b1 2,671 (n = 20) and 9,476 \u00b1 1,271 (n = 20) for POWV sig and JEV sig , respectively, and were not statistically different between the two formulations (p > 0.9). Neutralization titers were boosted approximately 15-fold following the second dose for both formulations, with EC 50 values of 200,402 \u00b1 20,414 (n = 20) for POWV sig and 225,380 \u00b1 21,112 (n = 20) for JEV sig . Despite the high EC 50 values after the first dose, a neutralization-resistant fraction was observed for both formulations. However, this fraction was reduced following the booster dose from 20% to 7% (p < 0.0001 for both vaccines) ( Figures 2C-2H) .",

POWV Spooner-challenged mice were treated one day before infection with 0.5 mg anti-Ifnar1 mAb to achieve high mortality rates in placebo-treated mice. Challenged mice were monitored for survival and weight loss for 21 days, and serum samples were collected two days post-challenge and assayed for viremia. Following POWV Spooner challenge in anti-Ifnar1 mAb-treated mice, and as expected, 100% of placebo-vaccinated mice succumbed to infection. In comparison, all POWV sig -and JEV sig -vaccinated mice survived the challenge ( Figure 3A ). Further-more, both POWV sig -and JEV sig -vaccinated mice maintained body weight, whereas placebo-vaccinated mice lost 30%-40% of their weight ( Figure 3B ). Consistent with these data, high levels of viremia were measured in placebovaccinated mice, but not in POWV sig -and JEV sig -vaccinated mice ( Figure 3C ). Similar results were observed following POWV LB challenge in the absence of anti-Ifnar1 mAb treatment. Whereas 80% of placebo-vaccinated mice succumbed following LB infection, 100% of POWV sig -and JEV sig -vaccinated mice survived infection ( Figure 3D ). Placebovaccinated mice lost between 20% and 40% of body weight, whereas POWV sig -and JEV sigvacci-nated mice maintained weight following virus challenge ( Figure 3E ). In addition, viremia was undetectable in POWV sig -or JEV sig -vaccinated mice but present in placebo-vaccinated mice ( Figure 3F ).

Whereas 8 of 9 (89%) mice that received 10 \u03bcL of serum from placebo-treated mice succumbed to POWV LB challenge, 3 of 9 (33%) and 0 of 9 (0%) mice that received 3 and 10 \u03bcL of serum, respectively, from POWV sig -vaccinated mice succumbed to viral challenge ( Figure 3G ). Furthermore, the 67% and 100% of mice that survived viral challenge following passive transfer of 3 and 10 \u03bcL of POWV sig serum, respectively, exhibited no weight loss following viral challenge, whereas all mice receiving serum from placebo-treated mice lost between 15% and 30% of their body weight. Passive transfer of serum from vaccinated mice resulted in significant reductions in viremia at 2 dpi: mice receiving 3 \u03bcL of POWV sig serum had more than a 500-fold reduction (p < 0.05) in viremia following challenge compared to mice receiving serum from placebo-treated mice, and viremia was undetectable in mice that received 10 \u03bcL of POWV sig serum.

Serum samples were collected on days 2 and 21 post-challenge for evaluation of neutralization titers. EC 50 values were not significantly different between the two time points (p > 0.07) ( Figure 4D ), with most mice having less than a two-fold change in titer (Table 1), indicating that little or no boost in antibody response occurred following viral challenge in POWV sig -immunized mice.

To determine the ability of serum from POWV-vaccinated mice to inhibit other TBFVs, we tested sera from POWV sigor JEV sig -vaccinated (two-dose) mice for their capacity to inhibit TBEV, LGTV, and GGYV RVPs (Figures 5B -5D; Figure S2 ). TBEV was chosen because it overlaps geographically with POWV in parts of far eastern Russia (Leonova et al., 2009 (Leonova et al., , 2017 and has a large public health impact, infecting more than 10,000 people annually in Europe and Asia (Gritsun et al., 2003) . LGTV was selected due to its relatedness to TBEV and prior use as a TBEV vaccine (Mandl et al., 1991) . GGYV is one of the most divergent viruses of the mammalian group of TBFVs (Grard et al., 2007) and thus can demonstrate the breadth of cross-reactive response of the POWV vaccine sera. POWV shares about 77% amino acid identity in E protein sequence with LGTV and TBEV and 72% with GGYV. Most vaccine sera neutralized infection by RVPs bearing the E proteins of the other TBFVs, although some samples neutralized GGYV, whereas others did not ( Figures 5B-5D ). The variable neutralization of GGYV by POWV vaccine sera warrants further study but may be due to the greater sequence dissimilarity between the viruses ( Figure 5A ) and the resultant differential display of neutralizing epitopes. Sera from POWV sig -vaccinated mice exhibited cross-neutralizing activity with mean EC 50 values against TBEV, LGTV, and GGYV of 104 \u00b1 21 (n = 15), 215 \u00b1 112 (n = 13), and 113 \u00b1 57 (n = 15), respectively. JEV sig induced similar cross-neutralizing titers against TBEV (82 \u00b1 75, n = 15), LGTV (119 \u00b1 92, n = 23), and GGYV (107 \u00b1 60, n = 15).",

An advantage of the LNP-encapsulated modified mRNA plat-form is that it allows rapid development of vaccine candidates by insertion of the desired viral mRNA sequence into the coding region. In this study, we used the mRNA vaccine platform previously shown to be effective in mice against ZIKV (Pardi et al., 2018; Richner et al., 2017a) to develop a countermeasure against POWV, another emerging flavivirus (Hermance and Thangamani, 2017) . Vaccination of mice with LNP-encapsulated mRNA-encoding POWV structural genes induced potently neutralizing antibody responses and protection against challenge by POWV strains from both lineages. Furthermore, one dose of the POWV mRNA vaccine was sufficient to induce robust immunity, because no viremia or significant anamnestic antibody response was observed following POWV challenge.",

This apparent disparity in results may have several reasons. The antibody repertoire produced in mice versus humans in response to TBFVs may be more cross-reactive, because mouse and human antibody specificities to TBEV immunization can be different (Jarmer et al., 2014) . Notwithstanding these data, mouse immune ascites fluid raised against some TBFVs (TBEV, OHFV, and KFDV) was not neutralizing against POWV (McAuley et al., 2017) . Furthermore, a separate study evaluating a TBEV vaccine in mice observed little crossneutralization of POWV (a 1:8 antibody titer) and no cross-protection against POWV challenge in vivo (Chernokhaeva et al., 2016) . It remains possible that there is a directionality to the cross-reactive response, such that POWV induces more cross-reactive antibodies than TBEV or other TBFVs due to differential display of conserved epitopes. Alternatively, the SVPs induced by the mRNA vaccine may display more cross-reactive epitopes than inactivated or fully infectious TBEV virions due to differences in the arrangement of E proteins on SVPs compared to virions (Kiermayr et al., 2009; Kuhn et al., 2015) . Studies comparing the antibody repertoires induced by LNP-mRNA vaccines to those generated after live virus infections or inactivated virus vaccination could address these questions. In addition, the RVP-based assay we used to assess neutralization titers against TBEV may be more sensitive than the plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) used by others. We observed increased sensitivity of the RVP-based neutralization assay compared to FRNT for POWV; however, the reciprocal result was true for LGTV in our study.",

Although a previous study showed the anti-ZIKV antibody responses to an LNP-encapsulated mRNA vaccine endure for at least five months post-vaccination (Pardi et al., 2018) , the durability and breadth of the POWV LNP-mRNA antibody response warrants further study. This may apply particularly to the cross-reactive antibody response, because anti-flavivirus anti-body responses generated by long-lived plasma cells in the memory B cell compartment in the context of West Nile virus (WNV) infection had a more type-specific repertoire (Purtha et al., 2011) . Moreover, previous studies with ZIKV and dengue virus (DENV) found the cross-neutralizing antibody response to flavivirus infections is greatest during the earlyconvalescent stage (<6 months) and then wanes over time (Collins et al., 2017; Montoya et al., 2018) .
