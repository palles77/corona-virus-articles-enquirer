We quantified the proportion of A (H1N1)pdm09 out of all influenza A specimens by country and correlated it with countries' central latitudes. Results We analyzed data from 80 countries (47 temperate, 33 tropical-subtropical). The median proportion of cases identified during the peak week was higher in temperate (0\u00c112) than in tropical-subtropical (0\u00c109) regions (P < 0\u00c101). The median duration of activity was longer in tropical-subtropical (27 weeks) than in temperate countries (20 weeks) (P < 0\u00c101). In most temperate countries (98%), peak pandemic activity occurred during the fall-winter period. There was a positive correlation between country central latitude and proportion of A(H1N1)pdm09 out of all influenza A specimens (r: 0\u00c176; P < 0\u00c101).",

            "text": "Seasonal influenza transmission varies throughout the world with time of year and region. 1 The mechanisms behind influenza seasonality are not well understood; however, multiple factors, including virological, immunological, environmental, and social factors likely contribute to the observed seasonal patterns of influenza transmission. 2, 3 These factors give rise to annual influenza epidemics during the winter months in Northern and Southern Hemisphere temperate climates. 4 In tropical and subtropical climates, influenza activity may be detected throughout the year, although there is increasing evidence of a notable seasonal component to influenza activity in some tropical countries. 3, 5 Pandemic influenza viruses can emerge at any time of year, but it is not clear whether the factors that drive yearly seasonal influenza transmission influence transmission of a novel virus to which the population has little immunity (resulting in increased population susceptibility, higher attack rates, and prolonged viral shedding in comparison with seasonal influenza). It has been postulated that there were seasonal variations in the transmission of pandemic influenza viruses during the 20th century, as they appeared to have had either a secondary or a tertiary wave of activity at the time of the historical influenza season. 6, 7 The A(H1N1) pdm09 pandemic of 2009-2010 also demonstrated a seasonal component to transmission early during the pandemic, in the Americas. 8 For example, surveillance during April to August 2009 pointed to higher rates of A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in Southern Hemisphere temperate countries, where the pandemic began at the time that seasonal influenza activity was expected. 5, 9, 10 The A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic provides a unique opportunity to study pandemic influenza transmission dynamics because there were more surveillance data from tropical and subtropical countries obtained during this pandemic than from any previous time in history. 11 The objectives of our study are to describe the transmission patterns of the A (H1N1)pdm09 virus throughout the world and to identify whether they varied in relation to geography (i.e., latitude and climatic regions) and time of year when A(H1N1)pdm09 was first detected in relation to countries' historical influenza season. This knowledge could be useful for pandemic preparedness, as it might help identify the best timing for the implementation of public health interventions or the distribution of limited supplies during a pandemic.",

We then graphed the weekly proportions for each country to help us visualize the countries' influenza activity. We used locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOESS) to create smoothed curves of influenza activity for each country (Figure 1 ). Using the smoothed data, we determined the following parameters of A(H1N1)pdm09 activity for each country: week of first detection of the A (H1N1)pdm09 virus, the proportion of A(H1N1)pdm09 specimens detected during the week of highest activity (peak activity), number of weeks from first A(H1N1)pdm09 detection until the week of peak activity (time to peak), number of weeks when 90% of A(H1N1)pdm09 specimens were detected (i.e., time encompassing the 5th and 95th percentiles of cumulative A(H1N1)pdm09 weekly proportion), and number of waves of A(H1N1)pdm09 activity during the study period. We defined a wave as the time period including an increase and subsequent decrease in A (H1N1)pdm09 activity and including a peak week of activity. A peak week was defined as a week during which the LOESSsmoothed proportion of A(H1N1)pdm09 activity was higher than the week immediately preceding it and immediately following it, and when the weekly proportion was at least 1% higher than in the troughs on either side. For example, Costa Rica showed only one wave of pandemic activity ( Figure 1 ); the proportion of A(H1N1)pdm09-positive specimens identified during the peak week (week 27) was 6\u00c17%, and it was 0\u00c15% during the trough week that followed (week 43). The smaller increases observed later in the study period did not meet the peak definition. This method helped us to avoid counting spurious fluctuations as peaks and was selected after evaluating a range of thresholds. Countries were then classified into climatic regions by using their central latitude (i.e., the latitude at the center of the country): Northern and Southern temperate (central latitude ! |30\u00b0|), subtropical (central latitude |23\u00c15-29\u00c19| and tropical (central latitude |23\u00c14\u00b0|). 14 We also classified countries into two other categories: those where A(H1N1) pdm09 was first detected during the start of the country's historical influenza season and those where A(H1N1)pdm09 was detected at any other time. The start of the historical influenza season was defined as the time encompassing the 6 weeks before the start of the influenza season and the first half of the season. The timing of country's historical influenza season (i.e., typical month of start and end of the season) was only known for a subgroup of countries (17 in temperate regions and 22 in tropical-subtropical regions) based on data from a prior study. 15 In the case of China, data from mainland temperate and subtropical regions, Chinese Taipei and Hong Kong SAR, were analyzed separately.",

The positive correlation between peak activity and the proportion of cases within the 12-week period around the peak demonstrates that countries with higher peak incidence had more concentrated waves overall. These findings are consistent with our initial hypothesis, as we anticipated that pandemic influenza would show similar behavior to seasonal influenza viruses and readily transmit, during a shorter time period, in temperate climate countries, and demonstrate less intense activity spread out over a longer period of time in tropical climate countries.",

These findings may explain why the median number of weeks from first A(H1N1)pdm09 detection until reaching peak week was longer in temperate climate countries, as 45 of 47 temperate countries in our study were in the Northern Hemisphere, and they were experiencing spring when A(H1N1)pdm09 was introduced (a time of year when influenza activity is low in these climatic regions). It is also consistent with our finding that countries where A(H1N1)pdm09 was introduced during the start of their historical influenza season had less time until peak A(H1N1)pdm09 activity was reached, and although not statistically significant, these countries also had lower probabilities of having a second wave of pandemic activity. As the timing of the historical influenza season corresponds to the time of year when the environmental, social, or biological factors responsible for influenza seasonality create a setting for enhanced influenza virus transmission, 2,3 we suggest that these factors might also have a role in the transmission of novel influenza viruses. The positive correlation between countries' central latitudes and their proportion of A(H1N1)pdm09-positive specimens out of all influenza A-positive specimens maybe the result of the emergence of A(H1N1)pdm09 when little to no seasonal influenza was circulating in northern hemisphere temperate countries; hence, A(H1N1)pdm09 would comprise a higher proportion of influenza infections. In contrast, Our findings have implications for pandemic preparedness, as they could inform the timing when supplies, services, and public health interventions might be most needed during a pandemic. The time from first identification of a novel influenza strain until it is detected in every continent can be weeks, and countries that are not in the epicenter of a pandemic should consider using this time to implement early interventions that may help further delay the spread of pandemic viruses, as recommended by WHO. 16 Countries in temperate climates might need to plan for the highest levels of activity during the autumn-winter (despite the fact that some might face an initial wave of activity close to the introduction of the pandemic virus); this is supported by findings from previous pandemics in countries like the United States., where peaks of activity occurred during the autumn/winter months. 6, 7, 17 Countries in tropical climates can expect influenza activity to be spread out over a longer period of time, with no evident pattern in the timing of their peak activity. Other investigators have made efforts to use influenza information obtained through current surveillance systems along with morbidity and mortality data from previous pandemics to generate models that may help estimate the burden of a future pandemic. 18 There were also several contributions from mathematical modeling during the A(H1N1)pdm09 pandemic. 19 Some models have even looked at the role of seasonality in previous pandemics as well as the potential role in future pandemics. 20 Our findings suggest the potential utility of accounting for latitude and historical timing of the influenza season when modeling the behavior of pandemic viruses.",
