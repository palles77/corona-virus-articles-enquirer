            "text": "Anomaly detection in sequence data is becoming more and more important in a wide variety of application domains such as credit card fraud detection, health care in medical field, and intrusion detection in cyber security. In the existing anomaly detection approaches, Markov chain techniques are widely accepted for their simple realization and few parameters. However, the short memory property of a classical Markov model ignores the interaction among data, and the long memory property of a higher order Markov model clouds the relationship between the previous data and current test data, and reduces the reliability of the model. Besides, both of these models cannot successfully describe the sequences changing with a tendency. In this paper, we propose an anomaly detection approach based on a dynamic Markov model. This approach segments sequence data by a sliding window. In the sliding window, we define the states of data according to the value of the data and establish a higher order Markov model with a proper order consequently, to balance the length of the memory property and keep up with the trend of sequences. In addition, an anomaly substitution strategy is proposed to prevent the detected anomalies from impacting the building of the models and keep anomaly detection continuously. The experimental results using simulated datasets and real-world datasets have demonstrated that the proposed approach improves the adaptability and stability of anomaly detection in sequence data.",

As far as anomaly is concerned, there is still no uniformly acceptable definition. One commonly used definition in statistics is that the data, which do not obey sequence distributions and position far away from other objects, are regarded as abnormal [10, 14] . Sequence data can be found in extensive application domains such as networks, information biology, weather forecast, and system management [3] . Usually, most of them exhibit two important characteristics: dynamics and trends [36] , and as such are hard to detect [11] . Anomaly detection in those sequence data is a challenging task, and one has to refer to the usage of sequential properties of data in order to detect anomalies [23, 40, 41] .",

[4, 20] propose a kNN-based ( k -nearest neighbor) technique in which the k -nearest neighbor distances of all objects are calculated and treated as the anomaly scores of objects. Two disadvantages of distance-based techniques are found, i.e., the choice of the distance measure directly determines their performance and the time complexity is up to O ( n 2 ) when computing the distance among n points [7, 25] .",

The data points that cannot be easily clustered will be considered as abnormal. This methodology is simple and can make use of a large number of existing research results. However, there is a big difference between cluster analysis and anomaly detection. The purpose of the former is to seek for the category of clusters; and the latter is to find the abnormal data. Anomaly detection is just an \"ancillary products\" of clustering [17, 24] . The fact that general approaches are not particularly optimized for anomaly detection leads to low detection efficiency. Besides, in most cases, the definitions of anomaly and detection criteria are implicit and cannot be clearly reflected in the process of clustering.",

Finally the anomaly will be found according to the deviation between the predicted value and the actual value at each time. These methods have better performance on the sequence of lower dimensionality. However, Bayesian networks have an assumption that attributes are independent of each other, which is usually not true in practical applications [18] . Neural networks require a large number of parameters, such as network topology, weights and threshold values. Besides, the learning time is too long, and may even fail to achieve the purpose of learning [19] . Support vector machines are difficult to implement large scale training samples.

Therefore, the techniques are able to detect anomalies even if they are located in a long sequence [35] . In this paper, we concentrate on the anomaly detection based on Markov models. Ozkan and Kozat [22] propose an online anomaly detection under Markov statistics with controllable false alarm rate for fast streaming temporal data. This algorithm learns the nominal attributes under possibly varying Markov statistics. Then, an anomaly is declared at a time instant, if the observations are statistically sufficiently deviant. Sha et al. [29] present a multi-order Markov chain based scheme for anomaly detection in server systems. This approach takes a higher order Markov chain and multivariate sequences into account to produce several indicators of anomalies.",

(2) The transformation from the state of time t \u2212 1 to the state of time t is time independent.In practical applications, however, these two basic assumptions cannot be strictly satisfied. The state probability distribution of time t is usually not only related to the state of time t \u2212 1 , but also related to the states of a period of time before time t \u2212 1 .

In theory, the memory time can be infinitely long by increasing the order of the Markov model. Besides, in Markov chain approaches, once the Markov models are established in training phase, the order of Markov models is fixed to detect anomaly in testing phase. However, the fact, that the fixed Markov models ( n -order) force each state of a sequence to be conditioned on the fixed previous n states, may not be sufficient to provide a reliable estimate of the detecting state. With the decrease of the correlation between old and new data, the fixed Markov models are no longer applicable to the entire sequence. At the same time, both models mentioned above cannot completely describe the characteristics of whole sequence with a trend yet. They will be invalid, when the value of a sequence data exceeds the area covered by the training data.",

Thus an appropriate length of memory time is useful to cognize current events. Besides, as time goes by, the events in cognitive memory are constantly updated to keep up with the changing of the current events. Motivated by this theory, a dynamic Markov model is proposed in this paper to balance the length of the memory property of Markov models and keep the strong correlation between the memory (or the Markov model) and current test data. This dynamic model first makes use of a sliding window to segment a sequence data. Then the correlation analysis of data in the sliding window is used to find out a proper order of a Markov model. And the order of the Markov model is continuously updated with the sliding window sliding to keep the relationship between the Markov model and current test data. Besides, when the current test data exceed the scope of the previously defined states, the states of data in the sliding window will be redefined, and the model will be retrained to follow the changes of the sequence. At the same time, in order to detect anomalies continuously and prevent anomaly points detected from infection to the building of the models, an anomaly substitution strategy is proposed. Therefore this research presents a robust anomaly detection approach based on a dynamic Markov model. In addition, this paper focuses on the sequences type on the data with dynamics and trend, such as electrocardiograms (ECGs) data in medical, seasonal data, and quarterly data.",

From Fig. 2 (a) only the anomalous points at t = 170 and 200 can be detected. In Fig. 2 (b) it can be seen that the number of states N = 5 leads to the best detection result ( TP = 95.2% and FA = 4.7%). For the number of states N = 6 and 7, the anomalies at t = 170, 200, 220-240 are detected, but the false alarm rate ( FA = 52.1% and 86.7%) becomes too high. The choice of the number of states N has certain influence on the detection results. By running a large number of simulation experiments, it has been determined that the number of states N is generally in the range 5-11. In many cases, a sequence data has a tendency. For example, the global temperature sequence data is increased in the past few decades. For this issue, an increasing trend is added to the synthetic data. The order of the higher order Markov model n in the proposed approach is also discussed by using the synthetic data. These experimental results are shown in Fig. 3 and Table 1 . In Fig. 3 and Table 1 , we can observe that the proposed approach (i.e., constantly update n with N = 8) has the best detection result with lower false alarm rate ( TP = 95.7% and FA = 8.3%). From Fig. 3 (f) , the order n changes in 1-3 with the sliding window sliding. In Fig. 3 (b) , the anomaly points at t = 220-240 cannot be detected. The reason is that when the order n = 1, the transfer of only two adjacent points will be considered, which ignores the relationship among data. In Figs. 3 (c) and (d), a part of the anomaly points at t = 220-240 can be detected by increasing the order n . However, the fixed order n also causes a high false positive rate for a strict judgment standard by considering the transfer of three and four adjacent points, respectively. Thus this experience indicates that the method of constantly updating n in the proposed approach does improve the detection accuracy by keeping proper relationship with the previous data.",

The value of TP reaches 100% when l < 10 or l > 100, but that FA is too high (greater than 80%) to be acceptable. The reason is that according to Eq.

            "text": "First, the classical Markov chain techniques, the higher order Markov chain, the LOF method and the proposed approach are analyzed and compared in detail using the passenger traffic data. The anomalies in the passenger traffic data are located in January 2003 (data points 101-103 in Fig. 4 ) , due to the outbreak of SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) in China and then a sharp drop in airport passenger traffic. These experimental results are shown in Fig. 5 and Table 2 . Fig. 5 (a) is the passenger traffic data and the first 60 data points are used as training data. In Fig. 5 (b) , the classical Markov chain techniques cannot normally detect data points from 64 to 108 because of the amplitude of the data points after 63 beyond the value range of training data, where no corresponding states in the classical model are found. Therefore, all of these data points are regarded as anomalies. In Fig. 5 (c) the higher order Markov model ( n = 5) is used to replace the classical Markov model, where the order of the Markov model is n = 5. Similar to the result in Fig. 5 (b) , the higher order Markov model can neither normally detect the data points from 61 to 108. Besides, in Fig. 5 (d) , the LOF method only detect the data points 101 and 102 with TP = 66.7% and FA = 66.7%, where k = 6 ( k indicates the k -distance neighborhood). However, in Fig. 5 (e) , the result indicates that the approach proposed in this paper is well able to detect all the abnormal data points 100-103, where the length of sliding window is l = 24, the number of states is N = 5, and the dynamic order of Markov model n is shown in Fig. 5 (f) . According to Eq. (9) , the support probability of the data points 100-103 are 0, and then these points are determined as abnormal data points. All of these experiments results show that the proposed approach has better adaptability in anomaly detection especially for tendency sequence data. In addition, the video surveillance dataset ann_gun_CentroidA extracted from a video of an actor performing various actions with and without a replica gun is detected using the four approaches mentioned above. According to the description of the data source, the anomalies in the sequence are data points 1340-1792. The results of this experiment in which the first 10 0 0 data points are regarded as training data are depicted in Fig. 6 and Table 2 .",

The short memory property of a classical Markov model and the long memory property of a higher order Markov model are analyzed. The proposed approach balances the length of the memory property by repeatedly utilizing the Pearson correlation analysis approach to find a proper order of the Markov model in a sliding window. Moreover, the proposed approach maintains the established model reliable and successfully detects the tendency sequences by dynamically defining the states of data and training the models in the sliding window. For keeping detection continuously, a substitution strategy of anomalies is reported to protect the building of models from the infection of detected anomalies. The comparison of the proposed approach with other benchmark approaches shows that the proposed approach performs better in terms of the true positive rate and the false alarm rate for all of dynamic and tendency sequence data. Another interesting topic will use Petri nets [42, 43] to model the anomaly detection process.",
