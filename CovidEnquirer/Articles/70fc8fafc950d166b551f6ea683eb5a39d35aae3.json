The lipid envelope (which is derived from the host cell in which the virus has replicated) is studded with the two morphologically distinguishable glycoprotein spikes, namely the haemagglutinin (HA) and the neuraminidase (NA). The latter takes the morphological form of a mushroom but with a narrow extended stalk, while the HA is triangular in cross section rather like a Toblerone chocolate bar. Both spikes penetrate through the lipid bilayer via 'tails' of hydrophobic amino acids and contact the underlying layer of matrix (M) protein. The M protein forms a monomolecular layer and probably contributes in a major way to the structural integrity of the virion. Enclosed in the matrix shell is the nucleoprotein and the PI, P2 and P3 complex, closely assocciated with the ss RNA of the virus. The three polymerase pro-teins constitute an RNA transcriptase enzyme (Kawakami and Ishihama, 1983, reviewed by McCauley and Mahy, 1983) responsible for initiating RNA replication in the infected cell. The virion RNA exists as 8 separate single stranded fragments which are replicated independently as described below.",

            "text": "The HA protein is a major determinant of virulence of influenza virus (Bosch et a]., 1979) and also contains important antigenic determinants which stimulate the production of neutralizing antibody following infection or immunization. The HA protein has important biological functions of attachment to host cell receptors and, once inside the cell mediates fusion events which result in release of RNA and cell infection. Therefore, the HA represents an important target protein both from the point of view of vaccines and also chemotherapy and hence it is probably the most well studied human virus protein. An important characteristic of the HA is the mosaic characteristic of its antigenic determinants ('antigenic drift', resulting from single or a few amino acid substitutions) and its ability also to undergo major antigenic changes ('antigenic shift'). Amino acid sequence analysis of the HA of different subtypes shows, however, that certain stretches are conserved and this raises the possibility that these could be used as specific targets for new antivirals and vaccines. This is discussed in more detail below when we refer to the work on oligopeptides as inhibitors of virus replication. From the point of view of vaccines, earlier studies in animals showed cross-protection Kilbourne, 1965, Werner, 1966) between subtypes of influenza A virus (but not between influenza A and B viruses) and this was thought to be HA mediated. Therefore shielded antigenic determinants could exist which are recognized more easily in certain animals than in humans. Again this emphasizes the possibility of obtaining immunogens which induce cross-reactive antibody against a wide variety of strains. At present antigenic drift and shift pose major problems for vaccine efficacy.",

The most highly conserved sequence in the haemagglutinin is the amino terminus of HA2, where 1 substitution in the first 11 and only 5 in the first 23 amino acids have been observed. This sequence is associated with the activity by which the virus penetrates a host-cell internal lysosomal membrane to initiate infection. Cleavage of HA into HA1 and HA2 at this point is required for infections penetration and for in vitro membrane fusion (An homologous sequence is present at the cleavageactivation site on the Sendai virus fusion protein, where cleavage is required both for infectivity and membrane fusion activity.)

I .6. NEURAMINIDASE (NA) The NA is the second glycoprotein on the surface of the virion. Several roles have been suggested for the neuraminidase. The enzyme catalyses cleavage of the cc-ketosidic linkage between terminal sialic acid and an adjacent sugar residue. This reaction permits transport of the virus through mucin and destroys the haemagglutinin receptor on the host cell, thus allowing elution of progeny virus particles from infected cells. The removal of sialic acid from the carbohydrate moiety of newly synthesized haemagglutinin and neuraminidase is also necessary to prevent self-aggregation of the virus. In general, then, the role of neuraminidase may be to facilitate mobility of the virus both to and from the site of infection.",

A hydrophobic N-terminal region serves to anchor the neuraininidase in the membrane. The N2 enzyme subunit contains 469 amino acids, with carbohydrate attached in four places.

However, with the advent of rapid sequencing of virus glycoproteins involved in these interactions our knowledge of sequences involved should increase rapidly. We should recognize the pitfalls of studies of early interactions between viruses and cells, an important one being whether the interaction we observe will lead to infection. or whether we are simply observing non-infectious interaction. Nevertheless more studies are urgently required and data obtained could easily be applied, for example, to the design of specific inhibitors for chemoprophylaxis and also help to understand important problems of antibody-virus interaction and neutralization, virus cell fusion and virus host range. Sialic acids are known to be essential components of the cell surface receptors for influenza, paramyxoviruses, polyoma and encephalomyocarditis virus, but the viruses nevertheless appear to exhibit strict and varied specificities for the precise sialyloligosaccharide sequences that serve as their receptor determinants. Probably the best characterized virus receptor is glycophorin, a sialo glycoprotein binding site for influenza virus on erythrocytes. Sialic acid containing glycolipids (gangliosides) occur naturally in the plasma membrane of cells and act as receptors of cholera toxin, interferon and some glycoprotein hormones as well as certain viruses. Of course, both gangliosides and glycoprotein may be involved in the adsorption of a single virus because on approaching a cell the virus firstly would interact with glycoprotein before more intimate interaction with the plasma membrane containing gangliosides.",

(1981) . These authors describe the different adsorption properties of the R1/5 and RI/5+ viruses with erythrocytes and attribute this to the different sialyloligosaccharide receptor specificities of their HAS. Erythrocytes were treated with Vibrio cholera neuraminidase to remove sialic acids and then modified with CMP-NeuAc and three purified sialyltransferases to contain either the NeuAca2, 3 Gal, NeuAccr2, 6 Gal or NeuAca2, 6 Gal NAc linkages on cell surface glycoproteins. The HAS of the two viruses RI/5and RI/5+ had totally different specificities, binding respectively to NeuAcct2, 3 Gal and NeuAca2, 6 Gal linkages. A further implication of this study is that the receptor site and functional properties of the HA may change independently of the overall antigenic properties. Two antigenic sites B and D on the influenza HA molecule (Fig. 7. 2) are near the receptor site and therefore it is possible that variations in receptor specificity might arise from natural selective pressure placed by host specified sialyloligosaccharide present on secreted or cell surface glycoproteins. Indeed, more recently, we have described the selection of subpopulations of influenza A and B viruses by cultivation of virus in MDCK cells or in embryonated hens eggs (Schild et al., 1983) . The latter host system is extremely selective and clones out a population of virions with different antigenic composition, as detected with both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, compared to the same parental virus cultivated in MDCK cells. The novel implication is that a non-immune selective mechanism involving host cell receptor sites may operate to select and generate antigenic variants of influenza virus, thus contributing towards antigenic drift and evolution of the virus.",

In their studies on SFV, Helenius and his colleagues (1980) observed that virions entering via coated pits ended up in lysosomes. In parallel studies SFV was induced to fuse with the plasma membrane of cells by adsorbing cells with virus at 4\u00b0C and then briefly exposing the preparations to warm (37\u00b0C) medium at pH 5.5. In addition, low pH dependent fusion of virus with liposomes was demonstrated. From this data it was proposed that the low pH environment of the lysosome promotes fusion of the viral and lysosomal membrane, resulting in the release of the viral nucleic acid into the cell cytoplasm. It was claimed that the antiviral action of lysosomotropic agents such as chloroquine, amantadine and NH,+ was mediated by an ability to raise lysosomal pH (Ohkuma and Poole, 1978) and block virus infection at an early stage prior to transcription.

Different mechanisms are responsible for the production of these two classes of cRNAs but surprisingly little is known about the interrelationships between their synthesis and that of vRNA for example. More recent data, however, indicates that vRNA synthesis is regulated throughout infection and this may involve selective transcription of its template. Regulation of vRNA synthesis may be largely responsible for the controlled production of virus mRNAs (Smith and Hay, 1982) .

            "text": "in the presence of ATP and Mg ions oxidized reovirus mRNA is crosslinked to two proteins of M.W. 28 K and 50 K which may be structurally related to the 24 K polypeptide (Sonenberg, 198 1) . Studies with monoclonal antibodies indicate that the 24 K cap-binding polypeptide may be contained in even larger protein precursors . It has also been demonstrated that translation of capped mRNAs can be competitively inhibited by various cap analogues (Both et al., 1976 , Roman et al., 1976 . Influenza virus has the unique feature to use host cell-coded capped RNAs as primers for the synthesis of its own mRNA ( Fig. 7 .5). In the priming reaction the cap together with some 10 to 15 nucleotides is cleaved from host RNA by a viral endonuclease and is subsequently used to initiate viral RNA transcription (Krug et al., 1981) . As a result a host RNA-derived capped sequence is found to be linked to the 5'-end of the viral mRNA. This cap transfer reaction can also be performed in vitro using a variety of mRNAs such as globin mRNA or reovirus mRNAs as primers. to be active as a primer have been investigated and only RNAs containing a capped 5'-terminus can efficiently initiate viral mRNA synthesis. In addition to natural niRNAs, synthetic polynucleotides such as capped poly (A) and capped poly (AU) can prime viral transcription. Thus, binding of the capped RNA to the viral transcription complex is clearly caused by interactions other than base pairing with the viral template RNA. This leaves the cap structure as the only common signal of recognition of the primer RNA. Therefore it seems likely that some cap recognition site must be present within the polymerase complex and recently the cap binding protein has been established as the virion polymerase protein P2 (Blaas et al., 1982) . In more detail, Krug et al. (1981) identified those bases of a representative primer, p-globin mRNA, that were transferred to the viral RNA transcripts. Using IZsIlabelled globin mRNA as primer for in vitro transcription, he found that the predominant sequence at the 5' end of each viral mRNA segment was identical to the first 13 nucleotides (plus the cap) at the 5' terminus ofj3-globin mRNA, which has the sequence: m7Gpppm61AmC(m)ACUUGCUUUU 1 3GAC....8. Because only the C residues were labeled with lZ5T, these results indicated that possibly the first 12, 13 or 14 5'-terminal bases ofj3-globin mRNA were transferred to the viral mRNAs ( Fig. 7.5) . Analysis of the minor 1251-labeled oligonucleotides found in the viral mRNAs indicated that shorter, 5'-terminal fragments of j3-globin mRNA (8-1 1. or 2-3 bases in length) were sometimes transferred and that the transferred pieces were most likely linked to G as the first base incorporated by the transcriptase. The priming mechanism involves recognition of the 5'-terminal methylated cap structures (ni7GpppXm), because only RNAs containing a cap are active as primers. Removal of the m7G of the cap by chemical or enzymatic treatment eliminates all priming activity, and this activity can be restored by enzymatically recapping the RNA. The absence of either methyl group from the cap of an RNA greatly re- For additional references see McGeoch et al., 1976 , Skehel, 1972 , Lamb et al., 1980 , Webster et al., 1982 duces its priming activity and the absence of both methyl groups completely eliminates activity. Because similar priming by capped RNAs also apparently occurs in the uninfected cell, the a-amanitin-sensitive (RNA polymerase 11) step required for viral RNA transcription in vivo and alluded to above, is explained, i.e. the host RNA polymerase I1 is required for the synthesis of capped RNA primers. Only those capped cellular RNAs made after infection, and not those pre-existing before infection, serve as primers. One possibility why only newly synthesized capped cellular RNAs serve as primers is that pre-existing, but not newly synthesized, capped RNAs are tied up in ribonucleoprotein structures (including polyribosomes) and cannot be used by the viral transcriptase. If so, the viral transcriptase would be expected to function near the site of synthesis of capped cellular RNAs in the nucleus. Several lines of evidence have suggested that some steps in viral RNA transcription occur in the nucleus, but this has not yet been directly demonstrated. The above sequence of events represents a further target for the development of new inhibitors of influenza virus.",

Obviously, many questions remain to be answered including the mechanism (if any) for assuring the correct amount of RNA per virion, the triggering process for budding and details of budding itself.

Type B influenza causes more restricted epidemics and has only been isolated from humans, whereas type C causes even fewer clinical problems in humans, but has also been isolated in pigs (Guo et al., 1983) . Type A influenza viruses are further classified into subtypes based on the antigenic characteristics of their surface antigens, haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Twelve distinct HA subtypes and nine NA subtypes are now recognized in the nomenclature system for influenza A viruses recommended by the World Health Organization, and a thirteenth HA subtype has recently been identified (Table 7. 2). It is implicit in this system that all viruses with common H or N subtype have HA or NA antigens shown to be related by conventional laboratory tests, while such relationships do not occur between subtypes. However, included among viruses of a common subtype designation will be strains showing considerable degrees of antigenic variation ('antigenic drift'). Thus, the human virus A/Bangkok/l/79 (H3N2) contains HA and N A antigens demonstrably related to those of A/Hong Kong/68 (H3N2) virus but showing considerable degrees of difference from them.",

Thus, the change from H2 to H3 must involve a more drastic mechanism. Several possibilities could be mentioned to explain this 'antigenic shift': (1) the 'new' virus may have caused an epidemic in man many years previously and have remained hidden ever since. Evidence for this kind of event has been obtained. Thus, the strain of 'Russian flu' ( H I N I ) which reappeared in Anshan in northern China on 4 May 1977 and subsequently spread to the rest of the world, seems to be identical, in all genes, to the virus which caused an influenza epidemic in 1950. This 'hidden place' could include an animal reservoir, refrigerator or even a persistent or latent infection of humans. (2) Some of the 'new' viruses may be derived from animal or avian viruses. One strain of human influenza has been shown to be such a recombinant (reassortant). The Hong Kong (H3N2) virus contains the NA (and other) genes from an Asian (H2N2) strain of human influenza and an HA which is antigenically related to that of A/Duck/Ukraine/63 (H3N8) and A/equine/2/Miami/63 (H3N8) viruses. The amino acid sequence homology between the HAS of A/Duck/Ukraine/63 and A/Aichi/2/68 viruses (both of subtype H3) is 96%. The donating virus could have been one which contained Hong Kong HA that had persisted from a much earlier human influenza epidemic maintained unchanged in the same way as the Russian 'flu. (3) An animal or bird virus could become infectious for man (Easterday, 1975, Laver and . This unpre- dictability is one of the major worrying features about influenza, together of course with its demonstrated virulence for humans and explains why so much work is carried out with the virus. Mortality data from 1200 million people living in 88 of the 156 or so WHO member states (approximately one quarter of the world's population) show that more than two million deaths from acute respiratory disease occur annually (reviewed by Lennette, 1981) and that the majority of acute respiratory disease is attributed to viruses of 5 families. Influenza A and B viruses cause a very significant number of these deaths. The highest mortality during an influenza epidemic is always noted among certain groups which are identified as 'special risk groups'. We shall see the significance of this group of persons later when we discuss prevention of influenza by vaccines and chemoprophylaxis, because special risk persons constitute the main target groups. Mass vaccination and chemoprophylaxis against influenza is not generally practiced because of the absence of broad spectrum antivirals and the less than 100% efficacy of the current vaccines. Persons in these special risk groups are old people (generally over 65 years of age (see Table 7 .3)), babies under 18 months of age, persons with diabetes or chronic heart, kidney and respiratory ailments. As early as 1847, William Farr estimated the impact of influenza in London by estimating excess mortality, viz. he subtracted the number of deaths in an influenza-free winter from the number of deaths in an epidemic winter. Stepwise multiple regression models are now used (Tillett et al., 1980) to obtain these estimates using, in the UK, data from the office Population Censuses and Surveys and generally figures over an 8-1 1 year period are analyzed. Factors known to influence the 4 weekly returns include seasonal variation and time trends in morbidity and mortality. The results of such an analysis are shown in Table 7 .3. The influenza outbreak in 1975-76 was caused by two influenza A (H3N2) variants and also influenza B viruses and 22 250 excess deaths were recorded, most of them due to respiratory causes. This represents the deaths of approximately 1 in 275 of the elderly population in the UK. In the same winter there were 908 000 excess sickness benefit claims, equivalent to an illness in approximately 1 in 20 of those persons insured (viz. 56% of the 16-64 age group). So the total morbidity in the adult population was 1.6 million. This analysis does not include children.",

Chest complications tend to occur in patients previously suffering from chronic bronchitis or rheumatic, ischaemic or hypertensive heart disease. Pneumonia may result from infection by the virus itself, invasion by staphylococci after virus damage of epithelial cells or invasion by pneumococci. Viral pneumonia presents as an overwhelming infection with profound toxaemiaso much so that the respiratory signs may not be noticed. In staphylococcus pneumonia the clinical signs may be more noticeably respiratory and the person may have partially recovered from influenza when the recovery is interrupted by a sudden onset of dyspnoea. Cyanosis may be featured with signs of shock and collapse of blood pressure. Pneumococcal pneumonia may often be less severe and onset may be delayed until the patient appears to be at the post influenza convalescent stage. Classical signs of lobar consolidation are noted but the response to antibiotics is usually rapid. A rare complication, which is frequently fatal, of influenza B (and influenza A) infection is Reye's syndrome, a fatty degeneration of the viscera and especially the liver.",

Humans may be infected initially by the settling of large particles containing virus in the upper respiratory tract or more fine particles in the lower respiratory tract. It is particularly interesting that, most commonly, influenza is an infection of the upper respiratory tract in humans. I t can be speculated that in the lung, alveolar macrophages may be particularly efficient at removing and destroying virions. The presence of non-specific inhibitors such as mucoproteins can neutralize influenza virus infectivity by preventing attachment of virus to new susceptible cells. Influenza virus can be carried and hence spread downwards in the respiratory tract by mucociliary action or downward drainage and rarely (in humans) can infect lung tissue and cause death by primary virus pneumonia. Table 7 .4 summarizes (although not exhaustively) attempts over the last 3-4 decades to obtain effective inhibitors of influenza A and B virus. Only two compounds (apart from interferon) have confirmed antiviral activity in man, namely amantadine and ribavirin, and therefore particular attention is devoted to these two molecules. Amantadine can be used as an excellent illustration of the problems and frustrations of developing an anti-influenza virus compound (Tables 7.5, 6).",

Firstly, influenza virus tnay represent a rather unique virus where chemotherapy arid vaccines may have to be used as a complete strategy for virus control in the field. Secondly, it should be realized that most of the past searches for new influenza inhibitors have Oxford, 1977 been carried out using biological screening procedures and more or less random testing of synthesized molecules (Swallow, 1978) . Of course, in retrospect, it is not possible to deduce whether the rather depressing lack of success has been due to the particular features of the virus itself, or alternatively to the 'randomness' of the search (Galasso et al., 1979) . This question may be answered in the next few years as more groups utilize what appears to be more 'designed' approaches searching for inhibitors of RNA transcriptase, fusion, neuraminidase, mRNA capping etc. Sequence studies of HA, NA and other virus proteins have now provided a vast amount of hard biochemical data on which new more logical screening procedures can be based. An excellent example of such a new approach is the synthesis of short peptides, whose sequence is deduced from that of the known fusion sequence at the N terminus of HA2 (Richardson et al., 1980) .",

There is little doubt that the relatively poor usage of amantadine has reduced interest in the search and development of new antivirals against influenza and other respiratory viruses, and it is of some importance to establish if the problems faced by amantadine are unique to this compound or would be similar for other (and hopefully even more effective) antivirals against these respiratory viruses. It could be added that in comparison to the dearth of antivirals against respiratory viruses, compounds acting against herpes virus infections have been developed (acyclovir, and PFA) and may soon be established as the first antivirals to be used on a large scale in the community (see Chapters 12, 13).",

Thus, although certain simple primary amines such as methylamine inhibited both influenza A and B virus in vitro (Eaton et al., 1962, Oxford and Schild, 1968) amantadine had little or no effect against influenza B viruses and only inhibited influenza A viruses (Tables 7.7, 8). In addition, studies indicated some difference even between influenza A viruses of different subtypes as regards their degree of inhibition by amantadine. Certain viruses, such as A/PR/8/34 (HINl), were poorly inhibited by the compound, whereas viruses of the H2N2 subtype, for example, were well inhibited (Grunert et al., 1965, Schild and Sutton, 1965) . In retrospect this 'increased' resistance might have been caused by the multiple mutations undoubtedly accumulated by A/PR/8/34 virus during extensive laboratory passage. This early laboratory data which showed an apparent heterogeneity of response of influenza A viruses to inhibition by amantadine gave rise to concern that new epidemic subtypes of influenza A might not be inhibited by amantadine.

When the new pandemic influenza A/Hong Kong/68 (H3N2) virus appeared, an opportunity was lost to use and test the compound on a large scale during the first wave of the epidemic at a time when no influenza vaccine was available. However, the compound is now licensed in the USA and UK for the prophylaxis and therapy of any human influenza A virus. In summary, therefore, it would appear that most but not all (see below) recent and unpassaged influenza A viruses of the different human subtypes (HlNI), (H2N2) and (H3N2) are well inhibited by amantadine in vitro and in laboratory animal model systems. Furthermore, with the earlier H2N2 virus isolates a good correlation was established in most, but not all studies, between the in vitro inhibitory effect of amantadine and clinical efficacy and therefore it was anticipated that the recent H l N l and H3N2 viruses would be inhibited in clinical practice. Recent clinical trials have confirmed this optimism (see below).",

In this way transfer of drug resistance can be correlated with transfer of a particular gene or group of genes. At present the results from different laboratories are somewhat conflicting, although several groups agree that gene 7, coding for matrix protein, appears to co-segregate with amantadine resistance. The interpretations, however, are complicated to some extent by the observation that using different in vitro techniques the same influenza A virus may appear inhibited or resistant to the drug. In addition, data on determinants of influenza virulence suggest a multi-gene linkage with these biological properties. It is quite possible, however, that several gene products are involved in the mode of action of amanta-dine and that the product of gene 7 may have 'helper' activity. At present little extensive field work has been carried out to search for rimantadine or amantadine resistant viruses in contacts or in persons being treated for influenza. This is an important aspect to investigate since it is quite likely that amantadine resistance could spread among field viruses by genetic reassortment. Some influenza H3N2 or H l N l viruses circulating at present in the community are known to be recombinants (see Chapter 17) containing genes of both virus subtypes and thus intra-or intertypic recombination is probably occurring with a relatively high frequency (Ghendon et al., 1981) . Heider et al. (1981) have recently reported two relatively resistant influenza A H3N2 virus isolates in Berlin where rimantadine has not been used as a prophylatic. However, even the amantadine sensitive viruses in this work showed a rather poor dose response to amantadine and therefore the study needs to be extended and confirmed. Our own studies in the UK would suggest that occasional field isolates of H3N2 and H l N l viruses are partially resistant to amantadine.",

            "text": "Early biological studies demonstrated that amantadine acted at an early stage in influenza A virus infection and later, more detailed studies established the point of action at approximately the late stage of virus uncoating (reviewed by Oxford and Galbraith, 1980) . More recently, recognition that the N terminus of the HA2 polypeptide of influenza haemagglutinin has an amino acid sequence similar to that of the fusion sequence of the F protein of Sendai viruses, and also the demonstration of fusion and haemolysis events between influenza viruses and cells at low pH (White et al., 1981) have led to the hypothesis of an important role of fusion during infection of cells with influenza A virus. A possible re-interpretation of the above data on the mode of action of amantadine at present would be that influenza viruses penetrate susceptible cells by viropexis and thus enter the cell cyptoplasm in coated vesicles ( Fig. 7 .8). Comparable pre-lysosomal cytoplasmic vacuoles have been shown to have a low pH and under these conditions influenza HA-mediated fusion could occur, since a configuration change in the HA could result in the N terminus of HA2, which is normally some distance from either end of the molecule contacting the membrane of the vacuole (Wilson et al., 1981) . Fusion of the viral and vacuole membranes would then occur, resulting in release of viral RNA and subsequent transport to the cell nucleus, where initial viral RNA transcription is known to occur. Amantadine and other amines are known to increase the pH of intracytoplasmic vacuoles and so the drug could act by simply increasing the pH to 6.5 or 7.0 when fusion could not occur and viral infection would be blockaded. The hypothesis is most attractive, but some important observations remain contradicting at present. Thus, as we noted above, amantadine resistance is known to be cor- related with gene 7 (coding for M protein) and not gene 4 (coding for HA). In addition, there is the problem also referred to above, of why some viruses such as influenza B would be resistant to amantadine. Finally, in a recent study Richman et al. (1981) showed that when amantadine-treated cells were washed in compound free medium, though relatively high concentrations of amantadine remained intracellularly, the cells were now susceptible to infection. Yet immediately before, with amantadine in the culture medium and equilibrated in the cytoplasm, the cells resisted infection. This implies an antiviral role of amantadine at the superficial external plasma membrane of the cell rather than an intracellular action. Earlier biological experiments with amantadine-treated cells showed that after incubation with trypsin (which removed surface adhering material and presumably amantadine) cells become susceptible to viral infection.",

If the pH optimum of fusion as shown by haemolysis for influenza B viruses and drug-resistant A viruses was higher than for amantadine sensitive influenza A viruses, fusion and hence infection would proceed even in the presence of amantadine at pH 6.6, whereas corresponding events would be blocked with most amantadine-sensitive influenza A viruses. Although a small but reproducible difference in pH optimum and pH maximum for haemolysis was noted between an amantadine-resistant virus (maximum pH 6.2) and the parental amantadine-sensitive virus (maximum pH 5.6) this was nevertheless close to the range of pHs shown by other influenza A viruses (Table 7 .9). In addition, recombinants such as X-49 and NIB-4, NIB-7 and NIB-8 which are known to have inherited gene 7 and other genes from A/PR8/34 (HlNI) virus, and are thus relatively resistant to amantadine like the A/PR8/34 parent, show a similar pH optimum and maximum for haemolysis to the second parental strains which are all inhibited by amantadine.

Finally, as anticipated, high concentrations of added amantadine did not inhibit haemolysis of red blood cells by amantadine-sensitive influenza A viruses. Thus, further work is required to investigate and establish any role for a fusion event, to determine if low pH haemolysis of red blood cells is caused by a fusion process and to look for a correlation between pH optimum for this biological event and amantadine resistance o r susceptibility. Genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of viruses may be of considerable practical importance in attempts to control certain virus diseases by chemo-or immunoprophylaxis (see Chapter 17). Thus, certain naturally circulating influenza A viruses may be resistant to antiviral drugs such as amantadine by virtue of mutations in gene 7 or may differ in virulence, antigenic or biological properties and thus may be able to circumvent drug induced protection. Studies of influenza A and B viruses circulating in the community have shown that quite extensive genetic and phenotypic variation occurs. Thus, a number of recently isolated influenza viruses of both H3N2 and H IN1 antigenic subtypes have a temperature sensitive ( t s ) phenotype and differ in virulence for volunteers (Chapter 17). Laboratory studies of artificially induced influenza ts mutants have demonstrated clearly that such mutants are attenuated for man and that the shut-off temperature is related to attenuation. The occurrence of non-ts and ts viruses in nature probably indicates that influenza A viruses of varying virulence are circulating in the community. In our studies, even viruses isolated from the same city varied considerably in the phenotypic ts character. Influenza A and B viruses circulating in the community may also differ in respect to the biological property of plaquing in MDCK cells and to the electrophoretic properties of structural and non-structural polypeptides and RNA. Finally, analysis of field isolates of influenza A and B viruses using panels of monoclonal antibodies to virus HA indicates a considerable degree of antigenic heterogeneity even among viruses isolated in rather circumscribed outbreaks in single towns or schools (Chapter 17). It is quite possible that biological techniques currently used to estimate the degree of inhibition of viruses by amantadine are too insensitive and that significant but small differences in drug resistance between viruses may be missed. These differences might, however, have a significant effect on the circulation of viruses in the community. 7.9.5. PHARMACOLOGY OF AMANTADINE In summary, it has been established that, following oral administration of amantadine to man or mice, concentrations of amantadine could be attained in the tissues which would be expected to have influenza A virus inhibitory effects (around 1 pg amantadine/g tissue). However, what does not appear to be clearly established is the exact intracellular localization of administered amantadine and the correlation with antiviral activity (Richman et al., 1981) .",

Levels of the compound (pg/g) in the tissues were as follows: kidney (0.1 8), lung (0.17), spleen (0.1 ), blood (0.07), cerebellum (0.22). Thus, it is of a particular interest that relatively high levels of the molecule were found in the lung. Levels of amantadine in tissue specimens were also determined in a 5-month-old girl with influenza A virus pneumonia (Fishaut and Mostow, 1980) . 2.5 mg/kg of amantadine each 12 h was administered and tissue specimens obtained 4+ h after the final dose. Serum concentrations ranged from 0.8 to 1.64 pg/ml whilst higher concentrations of amantadine were found in the lung (21.4 pglml). This level of compound would significantly inhibit the replication of recent H3N2 and H 1 N I influenza A viruses.",

            "text": "Little detailed work has been published concerning the pharmacology of many of the derivatives of amantadine which have been synthesized and tested as antivirals. However, the varied biological activities of some of these molecules would suggest that differences in tissue distribution and adsorption might occur. As an example, rimantadine induces fewer CNS side effects in humans than amantadine and this might be related to reduced levels in the CNS since, for example, the compound has no anti-Parkinson's disease activity unlike amantadine itself which is active in this region. 7.9.6. TOXICOLOGY OF AMANTADINE A central nervous stimulant effect of amantadine was described (Vernier et al., 1969) in acute and chronic toxicity studies in animals, but only at concentrations around 30 mg/kg orally, which is about 10 times the dosage in man. The predominant signs of central nervous stimulation were increased motor activity, tremors, anorexia, increased sensitivity to environmental stimuli or convulsions in some cases. The stimulant effects have also been described in volunteers given high doses of the compound. At relatively high doses in animals, other effects were transient vasodepressor effects, cardiac arrhythmias, weak ganglionic blocking effect, increase of myocardial contractile force or blocks of phenethylamine vasopressor response (Vernier et al., 1969) . Millet et al. (1982) have carried out a controlled comparison of amantadine and rimantadine on CNS effects and included a commonly used antihistamine compound (chlorpheniramine). The study was carried out at the University of California and 52 adult volunteers participated, with a mean age of 25 years. There was no significant difference among treatment groups with respect to age or sex of the subjects. Mild symptoms occurred with approximately equal frequency in all groups and therefore were excluded from further analysis. Table 7 .12 shows the frequency and cumulative scores of moderate or severe symptoms, which were most commonly reported within each treatment group. The frequency of reported symptoms was low in the amantadine and placebo groups. Anti-histamine-like side effects, such as drowsiness and dry mouth, were less frequent and severe in the amantadine group than in the chlorpheniramine group. However, moderate to severe inability to concentrate, dizziness, and fatigue were reported more frequently by subjects who received the combination of amantadine and chlorpheniramine. Two subjects who received this combination reported additional symptoms of confusion and distorted depth perception as well as nausea and chills.",

The data of Millet et al. (1982) shows that Total scores within symptom categories for each treatment group represent the sum of the total daily moderate and severe complaints during the treatment period (4 days). neither of these drugs had a significant effect upon performance of tasks which involved attention, cognition, and memory. The early clinical studies of rimantadine in the USSR (Smorodintsev et al., 1970) and more recently in the USA have apparently indicated that the molecule is less toxic than amantadine (Dolin et al., 1982) and fewer CNS side effects are noted (although these effects are very mild with amantadine and are detected in no more than 10% of patients as described abovesee Table 7 .14). In a recent study Hayden et al. (1983) found that at similar plasma concentrations amantadine and rimantadine did not differ in the frequency or severity of their side effects. Oral dosing of volunteers with the same concentration (200 mg/day) of amantadine and rimantadine resulted in two fold different plasma levels (4 h after the initial dose of drug) of 300f98 ng amantadine and 140568 ng rimantadine. Moreover, the plasma drug concentrations correlated significantly with total symptom score (Tables 7.15 and 16). Thus, an important conclusion was that amantadine and rimantadine appeared to differ in their pharmacokinetics, but not in their potential for side effects at comparable plasma concentrations.",

            "text": "In contrast, in a study of Lamar et al. (1970) , Holtzman rats and New Zealand white rabbits were dosed orally with amantadine (0, 50 and 100 mg/kg) from 5 days prior to mating until day 6 of pregnancy. In rats, but not in rabbits, results of autopsies performed on day 14 of gestation showed significant decreases in the number of implantations and increases in the number of resorptions at 100 mg/kg. Teratology studies were performed in rats (0, 37, 50 and 100 mg/kg) by administering the drug orally on days 7 and 14 of gestation. Autopsy was just before expected parturition. Increases in resorption and decreases in the number of pups per litter were noted at 50 and 100 mg/kg. Gross examination of rat pups at these dose levels revealed no malformations at 37 mg/kg. Malformation at 50 and 100 mg/kg included oedema, malrotated hindlimbs, missing tail, stunting and brachygnatha. Examination of cleared and alizarin-stained skeletal preparations of foetuses revealed cases of absent ribs and absence of the lumbar and sacral portions of the spinal column in the 50 and 100 mg/kg groups. Thus, in rats but not in rabbits, amantadine seems to be embryotoxic and teratogenic. Teratogenicity in rats occurs at 50 mg/kg/day, or about 12 times the usual human dose. Oxford and Galbraith, 1980) . In contrast, only a few controlled trials have shown negative effects, but of course these are of considerable interest. There is general agreement in the literature that the protective effect of amantadine (used prophylactically) against influenza A virus would approximate to 70-80% (with a range from 0-100%). To place this figure in perspective, clinical trials with influenza vaccines have, over the same period of time shown similar results with protective effects varying from &loo% with a mean approaching 70-80%. The death incidence in a moderate influenza outbreak approximates to 1 in 5000 whereas the incidence of death following vaccination is estimated at 1 in 2 million or lower. This yields a maximum benefit risk ratio of 400: 1 in favour of immunization. For both amanta-dine and vaccine with 70% protective efficacy and a 10% attack rate, 14 persons would have to be immunized or given amantadine to prevent influenza in one person. Assuming a 0.1% mortality rate then approximately 14000 persons would have to be treated or immunized to prevent one death. With this background, it is of some comparative interest to examine representative clinical trials carried out between 1965 and 1984 and to illustrate exactly how effective amantadine is in preventing or curing influenza A infection. We should then be able to assess whether the compound is active enough to warrant more extensive use in the future or whether amantadine or rimantadine should be considered only as the first anti-influenza compound and whether new compounds of a much higher degree of activity would be required. Alternatively, are expectations of the clinician based on several decades of experience with antibacterials, too high to be realised with antivirals? It might suitably be mentioned here that an important property of an anti-influenza compound, particularly to be used as a prophylactic, would be not to completely abort influenza virus infection, but rather to reduce virus replication and abort clinical signs. The patients would thus be able to produce a natural immunological response, so conferring protection against reinfection with the same virus immediately drug prophylaxis ceases.",

(We have not attempted to analyze the data from all clinical trials reported in the literaturerather the review is selective.) 7.9,10. ARTIFICIAL CHALLENGE STUDIES The advantages of this method, involving as it does the challenge of human subjects with a known virus, are twofold. The first is administrative convenience in that results of such clinical investigation are generated immediately, as compared with the delay involved when waiting for a naturally occurring outbreak, or epidemic of influenza. The second concerns the use of a virus of known virulence to the host and sensitivity to the chemoprophylactic agent. The design can be planned in meticulous detail, including the screening of all volunteers for pre-existing antibody to the challenge virus. It is thus possible to involve groups of volunteers with low or absent antibody to the challenge virus, and to compare the response seen in volunteers who already possess a significant level of antibody to the virus at the time of challenge. A possible objection to this method of investigation of an anti-influenza agent may be its dissimilarity to the infection as it occurs in natural epidemic form and the use of high challenge doses of virus thus presenting an over vigorous testing (Beare and Reed, 1977) .",

However, as evidence of prophylactic action in influenza was disseminated, clinical investigations were set up in Europe and the Far East. In general, the dosage used was 100 mg every 12 h, but some studies, notably that by Smorodintsev in 1969, employed 100 mg daily. Clinical studies in the Soviet Union using rimantadine have been reviewed recently Kalninya, 1980, Zlydnikov et al., 1981 ) and therefore will not be discussed here in detail but summarized in Tables 7.23 -7.25. In initial challenge studies, Jackson et al. (1963) selected volunteers from amongst 735 college students who submitted blood specimens for determination of the influenza antibody titre. Two-thirds (497) of the students were considered to have a high serum antibody titre, 1:20 or greater. Subjects for placebo challenge were randomly selected from the high antibody group; 21 subjects served as placebo controls, and 18 were observed for drug toxicity. Among the 735 initial subjects, 199 were in the low antibody group ( I : 10 or less). These subjects, who were challenged with influenza virus, were placed in groups which received either placebo or 100 mg amantadine. One half of each group was given the capsule as pretreatment, beginning 18 h before virus challenge. The other half received treatment beginning 4 h after challenge. All treatment was continued for the next 6 days. After challenge, illness, virus recovery, exfoliative cytology and serology were studied. Among the 199 volunteers challenged with influenza virus, 89 (45 per cent) had a four-fold or greater rise in antibody in convalescent sera, indicating infection with the challenge virus. This represented an infection rate of 70 per cent among subjects with a pre-challenge antibody titre of 1:lO or less. Volunteers who had a pre-challenge antibody titre of 1:20 had an infection rate of only 22%. Among those with a higher serum level of antibody, only 9% became infected. Among the two placebo groups, 66% and 73';b of the subjects with a low antibody titre became infected as judged by a serological rise in titre. Among those with higher antibody, 14% and 26% were infected. Among subjects pre-treated with the drug, a considerable reduction in infection was observed in volunteers of either antibody status. Low antibody subjects given amantadine had an infection rate of only 37% which was a statistically significant reduction (P < 0.01) compared with the combined groups. No therapeutic effect was detected (see below).",

(1968) reported a study performed with the cooperation of volunteers at the Maryland House of Correction. Sixty-five men with titres of 1:2 or less of neutralizing antibodies were enrolled and, after full baseline evaluation, were housed in the research ward at the prison. Oral temperature, pulse rate and respiration rates were recorded at four-hourly intervals. Follow-up specimens were collected at 7, 14,21 and 28 days post challenge. Seven trials were conducted. In the preliminary potency-testing of the inoculum, seven men were challenged. In the following six drug-evaluation studies, viral challenge was performed on a total of 58 men, volunteers in each group numbering 14, 6, 12, 6, 8 and 12.

The virulence of the virus inoculum was examined in 7 men who received undiluted virus fluid containing 64 000 TCIDSo.

In the study, 'the family' was defined as all occupants of a household over 2 years of age living in daily contact with each other. The 'index case' was defined as the first person over the age of 2 years to contract clinical influenza in a household, and 'contact cases' were defined as individuals living in the household and having contact with the index case. All index cases received placebo medication in order not to influence the possible spread of influenza, while the families of index or contact cases received drug or placebo by random allocation. All the members of one family except the index cases, received the same treatment (drug or placebo). The diagnosis of influenza in the index case was made on clinical and epidemiological grounds. At the doctor's first visit, blood was taken from the index case and from as many of the other members of the family as practicable. A second blood sample was taken two or three weeks later, and tests for HI and CF antibody were performed. Daily records were kept of body temperature and the presence of a cough. A cough, accompanied by a rise of temperature to 37.8\"C or higher, was taken as criterion for a diagnosis of clinical influenza.",

Seventy-two general practitioners volunteered to take part and 58 families were included, comprising 176 individuals. The only difference in design between this study and the previous year's was that the index case in each family received amantadine or placebo in keeping with the rest of the family. As before, the results of cases suffering from clinical influenza and those with serological proof of influenza A infection, were submitted to statistical analysis. In this instance, the drug and placebotreated individuals behaved similarly and amantadine failed to protect persons receiving the compound from influenza. The virus itself was equally sensitive to amantadine as the previous year's strain and the authors sought to explain this reversal by considering the initial antibody status of those cases under study. It was seen that during the 1967/68 study, the initial level of HI antibody to the current strain of influenza A was higher (40 per cent with initial HI antibody below 1:12) compared with the 1968/69 study when 90 per cent of the contacts studied possessed initial HI titres below 1:12. This may have been responsible for the difference but the administration of amantadine to half the number of index cases could have influenced the infectivity of these individuals so that a direct comparison of these two trials is not possible. This study examined the prophylactic effect of amantadine by determining the effect of the compound on spread of influenza from an initial index case (which was left untreated) to the rest of the familv.",

Both amantadine and rimantadine were thus highly effective in preventing illness and/or infection with no statistically significant differences between the efficacy rates of the two compounds. However, amantadine treated persons had significantly more CNS side effects with an excess rate of 9.0% compared to placebo patients. The authors concluded that rimantadine might be the compound of choice for the chemoprophylaxis of influenza A infection in young volunteers, but further trials could be carried out in the elderly and high risk individuals. Another recent clinical trial has compared the therapeutic effect of amantadine versus rimantadine against an H l N l virus (Van Voris et al., 1981) . This trial will also be described in some detail, because it illustrates both clinical and serological criteria which need to be applied in a comprehensive clinical therapeutic study of an anti-influenza compound. The study was carried out in a group of university students naturally infected with A/USSR/77 (H IN 1) virus. Clinical criteria were used for the initial diagnosis of influenza and included the presence of a headache, fever, malaise and myalgia of less than 48 hours' duration. This is in accordance with the majority of the previously reported therapeutic studies, where benefit was not noted in persons entering treatment later than 48 hours after the initial symptoms. A complete history was taken on admission to the trial and thereafter clinical examinations were carried out at 4,48 and 72 hours, 7 days and 3 weeks, and specific signs categorized and graded on a scale of 0 to 3. Oral temperatures were measured by the clinician daily. Nasal washings for virus isolation were taken at the time of admission to the study and at 48 to 72 hours. Acute and convalescent sera were obtained and tested for rising titres of HI antibody to confirm the clinical diagnosis. All students took a tablet (100 mg) each morning and night. After 48 h of therapy, blood was taken to test for levels of drugthis is an important factor to control that students were indeed taking the medication (levels ranged from 0.3 to 0.8 pg/ ml, whilst the virus was inhibited by 0.2 pg/ml of drug). Of the 54 volunteers to enter the study, 45 were proven to have been infected with A/USSR/77 (HINI) virus. This is a rather high rate of clinical diagnosis, since, for example, typical general practitioner trials in the UK normally record a 60% success in influenza diagnosis (Galbraith et al., 1969) . When the total symptom scores were calculated for the three groups, an arbitrary 50% level of clinical improvement (compared with pretreatment) was reached in the amantadine and rimantadine groups at 48 hours. This was not reached until 72 hours by the placebo group (P<0.25). An improvement was noted in the drug treated groups in both respiratory and systemic signs. Mean temperatures for the drug treated groups were significantly lower ( P < 0.01) than the placebo group. An interesting finding (for students!) was that both at 48 and 72 hours after commencement of the study more students in the drug treated groups were able to attend class compared to the placebo group. Although the initial titres of the excreted virus were similar in each group, by 48 hours the proportion of students shedding virus was significantly lower in the groups treated with amantadine or rimantadine. All students developed post-infection HI antibody to the infecting virus. Minor CNS side effects were noted in a proportion of students in the amantadine group by day 5, but these appeared to be less important than the relief of influenza symptoms, since students in this group returned to class more rapidly than students in the placebo group. The authors concluded that a therapeutic advantage in favour of amantadine occurred, and that the 24-48 hours benefit appeared to justify the therapeutic use of amantadine or rimantadine especially in comparison with the current usage of non specific drugs such as antibiotics, antihistamines and cough suppressants.",

The compound has been used successfully to prevent the spread of virus in families, hospitals, factories and closed communities such as prisons and antiviral effects are consistent with viruses of the different subtypes HINI, H2N2 and H3N2.

Notable exceptions have been the attempt to immunize the population of the USA with A/Swine virus containing vaccine following the outbreak of influenza A/NJ/76 infection in the Fort Dix camp in the USA, and the necessarily (because of their size) uncontrolled trials of live attenuated influenza vaccine in cities in the USSR and China. It could be argued that general prophylactic measures could and should be instituted with more enthusiasm and vigour than at present and that such measures could include prophylaxis in certain groups with amantadine. A consensus meeting in the USA (Elliot, 1979) and also a more recent meeting in Vienna (Galasso et al., 1984) suggested that the following groups should be considered for amantadine prophylaxis.

In addition, the use of amantadine hydrochloride for prophylaxis in hospital patients in the presence of a demonstrated outbreak should take into consideration local and particular risk factors and conditions; for example, the patient who Galbraith et al., 1969 Zlydnikov et al., 1981 Nafta et al., 1970 Finklea et al., 1967 Smorodintsev et al., 1970 Bloomfield, 1970 Togo et al., 1968 Hornick et al., 1970 Jackson et al., 1963 Smorodintsev et al., 1970 D o h et al., 1982 Oker Blom et al., 1970 Zlydnikov et al., 1981 Nafta et al., 1970 Likar, 1970 Note that the summary of countries involved with these trials is not exhaustive. The early licensing and usage of amantadine was subject to two critical reviews by Sabin (1 967, 1978) . However, the more extensive field use of the two compounds in the last 5 years has provided data to answer many of the earlier questions. 6. Unvaccinated adults, who nevertheless have serious underlying disease which place them in a potentially high mortality group following an attack of influenza e.g. persons with pulmonary, cardiac, mgtabolic or immunological deficiencies. Amantadine or rimantadine could be used prophylactically and persons vaccinated at the same time. 7. Vaccinated adults who are at high risk from an attack of influenza. Rimantadine or amantadine-supplemented protection would be expected to raise the basic 70% protective effect of vaccine alone. Single non reactogenic doses of vaccine against a new pandemic virus subtype would not be expected to give significant protectiont w o doses of vaccine would be required particularly with subunit or split virus vaccines. Therefore amantadine could be administered prophylactically during the two-three week period of development of vaccine induced immunity. 8. In the event of the arrival of a new pandemic strain of influenza A virus a// the above groups and additionally individuals in the general community who would like prophylaxis. (Excluded would be young children and pregnant women because of the limited amount of clinical and toxicological data in these two groups.) See Galasso et al., 1984 , Elliot, 1979 is to undergo inhalation anaesthesia may be at higher risk of serious complications. Finally, an obvious possibility would be to supplement vaccine induced (partial) protection with amantadine (partial) protection. Only a few studies have investigated the possible additive effects of vaccine and amantadine in this approach and preliminary results have been encouraging (reviewed by Zlydnikov et a] ., 1981) raising protective efficacies from 32-37% in vaccine or rimantadine groups to 60% in the group given both vaccine and rimantadine.

            "text": "A infection itself in individuals can range from asymptomatic (there probably exists at least a 1 : 1 ratio of clinical : subclinical cases) through mild cold symptoms, to typical acute influenza and, in the extreme case, virus infection of the lower respiratory tract and pneumonia. A major limitation of amantadine in one respect has been the narrow spectrum of antiviral activity, limited to influenza A virus with only marginal activity (and here limited to in vitro data) against para-influenza viruses, VSV, rubella, arenaviruses and influenza B (reviewed by Oxford and Galbraith, 1980) . On the other hand, in influenza A virus epidemic years, the clinical diagnosis rate of influenza by general practitioners can be relatively high, as is shown by the controlled clinical trials in the UK (Galbraith et al., 1969) . It is apparent then that any extended use of amantadine must be accompanied and initiated by clear laboratory and virological data and establishment of influenza A virus spread in the community. This has been clearly recommended in the Vienna report (1984). In the UK, the PHLS and the Royal College of General Practitioners have considerable experience in quickly and accurately estimating outbreaks of influenza A virus in the community. Similar monitoring is carried out in the USA and USSR and therefore in these three countries particularly, prophylactic measures could be initiated with some degree of virological certainty. In the USSR, for example, communities already are encouraged to use rimantadine prophylactically over a period of 3-6 weeks during a city outbreak of influenza A virus. Rimantadine can be purchased from pharmacies without prescription for approximately \u20ac1.20 for a three week course, but is also administered free of charge in certain organizations (M. Indulen, Latvian Academy of Sciences, personal communication). In the UK and USA the amantadine has to be prescribed by a medical practitioner and the cost for a 10 day course (in the UK) is approximately \u20ac3.50. A parallel situation is occurring with certain of the new anti-herpes compounds, where rapid self-prescription by patients at the first signs of a virus induced lesion is required to show beneficial clinical effects. As mentioned briefly above, certain concepts which have been established about the use of antibacterials may therefore have to be modified for antivirals to include more reliance on a patient's ability to initiate prophylaxis. It must be expected, however, that widespread usage of antivirals may quickly result in the selection and spread of drug resistant variants. Drug resistance is a major clinical problem with antibacterials but has, at the same time, encouraged the search for more effective molecules. The Vienna report suggesting population groups for amantadine and rimantadine therapy, or prophylaxis using rimantadine, based its conclusions on more recently published data which has established that although rimantadine and amantadine have similar antiviral properties, rimantadine at 200 mg/day has no demonstrable toxic effects and therefore it is the choice for prophylaxis. On the other hand, the very mild side effects of amantadine (less, for example, than many nonspecific compounds used at present to treat the clinical effects of influenza) are not noticeable in persons already suffering from the clinical effects of influenza and so either rimantadine or amantadine can be used for therapy. It should be added that early studies in the USSR established the usefulness of rimantadine and these are summarized in Tables 7.23, 24 and 25. 7.9. I 6. THERAPEUTIC EFFECTS OF AMANTADINE AEROSOLS Hayden et al. (1980) established that aerosols of amantadine in young adults experiencing acute illness caused by influenza A virus had a discernable but modest therapeutic and antiviral effect. (It could be added that aerosol administration has been used rnore recently with ribavirin and, in particular, against respiratory syncytial virus infections in both adults and children -Chapter 8). In the Hayden trial (1980) the effect of small-particle aerosol therapy with amantadine was assessed in a randomized, double-blind study of 20 patients with naturally acquired influenza A vir- for 17-25 days us infection. Aerosol treatments of 20 min with either distilled water or with amantadine hydrochloride ( I .0 g/100 ml of distilled water) were given three times a day for four days. The amantadine-treated patients experienced a significantly more rapid resolution of clinical signs and symptoms when compared with placebo-treated patients. The resolution of fever was similar for both groups. Aerosol delivery of amantadine did not affect the frequency of viral isolation from upper respiratory tract secretions, but was associated with a trend toward reduced quantity of viral shedding. Serial pulmonary function tests found no important differences between the groups. Amantadine-treated patients experienced a greater frequency of mild local side effects (rhinorrhea, nasal irritation) during aerosol exposures but aerosol treatments did not cause any apparent decline in pulmonary function. In summary, therefore, the amantadine group of molecules has had a long gestation of two decades but the accumulation of scientific data is now overwhelming in its indication of the clinical usefulness of the compounds against influenza A virus infections. Future studies must monitor closely for development of drug resistant strains, the usefulness of amantadine at lower dosage levels and the usefulness of both amantadine and rimantadine in preventing mortality in the special risk groups.

Influenza type A and B virus replication is inhibited in tissue culture cells by ribavirin and the compound acts at an early stage in the influenza-infected cell, possibly by inhibiting the production of essential nucleotides and hence RNA synthesis. More recently, aerosols of ribavirin have been shown to have a clinical effect against influenza B virus infection in humans and this is considered in more detail below (McClung et al., 1983) . The inhibitory effect of ribavirin on the replication of a number of different influenza A and B viruses was measured in an early study using the egg piece system (Fazekas de St Groth and White, 1958) . In these experiments ribavirin was added to egg pieces in WHO plates at a final concentration of 0.04 mM at the time of virus infection and the virus was titrated in ribavirin treated and in control untreated plates and the plates incubated for 3 days at 37\u00b0C (Oxford, 1975) . The nucleoside analogue at 0.04 mM caused a very significant inhibition ( > 4.0 log ID,,Jml) of the replication of a range of influenza A strains of human, equine, avian and swine origin including A/Duck/England/62 (Hav3Navl), A/Swine/Cambrigde/39 (Hsw/ine l N 1 ), A/Equine/-Miami/63 (Heg2Neg2) and A/Port Chalmers/ 1 /73 (H3N2) viruses. In addition, influenza B/Hong Kong/8/73 virus was inhibited to a similar degree to the influenza A viruses. The multiplication of fowl plaque virus A/FPV/Dutch,' 27 (HavlNeql) in CEF cells was also inhibited by ribavirin as determined by plaque inhibition tests The effect of ribavirin against respiratory virus infections in mice is shown in Table 7 .27. Kochhar et al. (1980) with a single i.p. dose of ribavirin in the range of 10-200 mg/kg. All dosages in excess of 25 mg/kg were teratogenic. The optimal teratogenic dose varied with the stage of development, being higher at advanced stages of development. Depending on the dose and stage of treatment virtually all parts of the skeleton including the craniofacial and limb bones were susceptible to ribavirin. Both the frequency and multiplicity of skeletal defects increased as the dose was raised. The stage dependency of defects in the orofacial bones was markedly apparent. Treatment on day 10.5 resulted in shortened maxilla in all survivors, while treatment on either day 1 1 or 11.5 resulted in a high frequency of reduction in the length of both upper and lower jaws. Treatment on the 12th day resulted in a very low incidence of effect on the maxilla (4%) but a high frequency (88-100%) of reduction and deformation of the mandible. Ribavirin, both in vivo and in vitro, inhibited embryonic DNA synthesis. The inhibition was transitory and did not seem to be directly related to the embryolethal activity of the drug. Although the role of metabolic inhibition in Groups of 10 t o 20 mice were used in each experiment (T, treated; C, control)",

Ribavirin was given orally at a dose of 1000 mg/day for five days beginning within 24 or 48 h after onset of clinical influenza. The clinical signs and symptoms of influenza and quantitative viral shedding were the same in ribavirin-and placebo-treated groups. Ribavirin treatment was associated with significantly fewer fourfold or greater rises in antibody to influenza A viral antigen by the complement-fixation test, while rises in haemagglutination-inhibiting antibody titres occurred with equal frequency in both groups. The ribavirin-treated group experienced significant increases in bilirubin and in reticulocyte counts after onset of therapy. This suggested that ribavirin treated subjects had decreased synthesis and/or increased destruction of erythrocytes during treatment but the effect was not of sufficient magnitude to suggest that haemolysis was involved.",

Work continues to find more effective inhibitors and more recently this has tended to centre around inhibitors of specific virus enzymes, such as the influenza RNA transcriptase and neuraminidase, and synthetic competitive inhibitors of the fusion sequence of influenza HA. Both the former and latter approaches have the theoretical advantages of broad specificity, since the RNA polymerase enzyme is constituted by NP and P polypeptides (shared by virtually all influenza A viruses), whereas the 'fusion' sequence at the N terminus of the HA.,molecule is also shared by the HA of different subtypes of influenza, It is thought likely then that any inhibitors so developed would inhibit all influenza A viruses and, hopefully, influenza B viruses as well. In the next few pages we shall attempt to summarize some of this work and to emphasize approaches which could be exploited in the near future.",

This RNA-polymerase activity has been detected in the microsomes and nuclei of influenza-infected cells, and the virus-associated enzyme can transcribe, in vitro, the influenza virus genome, suggesting that the enzyme is required for virus multiplication. Therefore inhibitors of the RNA polymerase enzyme have potential application as chemoprophylactic agents against RNA-containing viruses (Helgstrand and Oberg, 1978 , see also Chapter 3). Ho and Walters (1971) described the inhibition of cell-associated RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of influenza AjPR8 (H 1 N 1 ) virus by selenocys-tine, and the related compound selenocystamine dihydrochloride inhibits the virusassociated RNA polymerase enzyme of a number of influenza A and B viruses (Oxford and Perrin, 1974) . We have described the in vitro inhibition of influenza virusassociated RNA-dependent RNA polymerase by selenocystamine dihydrochloride, bathophenanthroline disodium disulphonate and certain heterocyclic thiosemicarbazones ( Fig. 7.12) . A property common to these compounds is the ability to chelate soft, heavy, metal ions such as zinc and copper. Conversely, similar types of compounds in which the possibility of chelation was diminished showed significantly (e.g. 3-acetyl-pyridine-thiosemicarbazone) less inhibitory activity against influenza virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase ( If the RNA polymerase of influenza virus is a metallo-enzyme, more active and more selective chelating agents might be designed and tested. The compounds tested at present also inhibit E. coli RNA polymerase, which is a zinc metallo-enzyme but any inhibitory effect on mammalian cell polymerases would depend on configuration of RNA polymerase enzyme polypeptides near the zinc binding site and also on the relative stability constants of zinc for the polypeptide ligand and any competing ligand.",

In model experiments Ca-EDTA or Ca-DPTA were used which are effective chelators of zinc but have a low and defined toxicity in experimental animals and man. The rationale of the experiments was to deplete the zinc levels in cells of the upper respiratory tract and hence to prevent the formation of, or inhibit the function of, the zinc containing influenza RNA transcriptase enzyme. However, in preliminary experiments in influenza virus-infected ferrets and mice, no antiviral activity was detected with the latter compounds, although only very low concentrations have been tested to date. In further experiments we selected the most active thiosemicarbazone (2-APTSC) for further in vivo studies in mice and ferrets. However, we were not able to detect any virus inhibitory effect or any effect of the compound on mouse mortality or mean day of death, or on the clinical signs of influenza in the ferret. Animals were given 5 mg/kg of 2-APTSC at -24, 0, 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours. For the above experiments we used A/Hong Kong/l/68 (H3N2) virus and included either amantadine or ribavirin as control compounds with demonstrable inhibiting effect in the particular model system. Potter et al. (1981) have described an interesting and relevant infant rat model. In essence when influenza virus replicates in the turbinates of infant rats they become more susceptible to challenge with Huemopldus influenza. Initial studies were carried out with amantadine and a polynucleotide (poly CS4U). In the first study, 9 of 1 1 infant rats inoculated with influenza A/Victoria/75 virus and later given H . influenza developed bacteraemia and 6 of 11 developed meningitis; in contrast, virus-infected rats given amantadine at a concentration of 50 mg/kg by the subcutaneous, interperitoneal or oral route showed a significantly reduced incidence of bacteraemia and amantadine treatment by the intranasal route produced the most significant reduction in bacterial infection. These results were also shown in parallel studies using influenza A/Texas/77 virus. In a second, similar study, using influenza virus A/Victoria/75 and A/Texas/77, poly (CS4U) also reduced the incidence of systemic infection (Table 7 .32).",

The earlier widespread use of live attenuated vaccine in the USSR has now declined somewhat and most countries only produce enough vaccine to immunize some lo(% of the population. Again, more recently, this vaccine has tended to be inactivated whole virus or subunit vaccine (reviewed by Selby, 1976) . These (whole virus) vaccines have been produced for the past 4 decades and with improving technologies of ultra-centrifugation and gel filtration are now relatively pure virus proteins. HA antigen content is well controlled by single radial diffusion techniques (Wood et al., 1977) but it must be admitted that many problems remain to be solved. Some of these are discussed in more detail below, whilst the reader is also referred to Chapter 2 where some more modern approaches of gene cloning are discussed and to Chapter 17 where some problems of antigenic and genetic variation are outlined (see also Table 7 .34). Laboratory studies have established clearly that HA and NA antigens contain the main antigenic determinants of the virus responsible for inducing protective immunity (reviewed in Potter and Oxford, 1979) . Passive antibody to HA and NA protects mice against lethal infection with influenza A virus, as well as immunization with HA and NA antigens. lmmunization or passive immunity with antibody to M or N P for example has no protective effect (Virelizier et al., 1976, Fazekas de St. Groth and Graham, (Schild et al., 1983) Gething, 1981",

Subsequent stimulation of the immune system by infection or immunization more often than not leads to an increase in synthesis of antibody to the HA of this first virus, rather than to the virus actually in the current vaccine. It is difficult to imagine how any approach to influenza vaccine could overcome this difficulty and this again emphasizes that a combined approach with antivirals and vaccines may represent the best strategy.",

The virus (which is approximately 98\"/, pure) is then inactivated with formalin or P-propiolactone and standardized by radial immunodiffusion (Wood et al., 1977) or rocket immunoelectrophoresis to contain around 30 pg of protein per human vaccine dose. Using high growth 'recombinant' viruses (Kilbourne, 1969) which contain as many as 6 genes from the high yielding laboratory virus A/PR/8/34 (H IN 1) and only 2 genes (coding for HA and NA) from the 'wild' virus, approximately 2-3 doses of virus vaccine may be obtained from one embryonated egg. But it is quite apparent that the application of a considerable technology and time span is required to produce enough vaccine to immunize a population of 200 million persons in the USA, for example (Table 7 .35). A period of many weeks must necessarily elapse from the initial outbreak caused by a new , 1969, 1973, 1974 influenza A virus and the production of vaccine against the antigenic variant (Table  7 .36). (In contrast, the efficacy of existing antivirals such as amantadine can be established within days.) Large scale immunization (Table 7 .37) has been attempted in the USA in the face of a threatened outbreak of virus caused by A/New Jersey/76 (HlNI), a virus genetically related to the causative virus of the 1918 pandemic which had remained in the pig population in the USA since the pandemic in humans. However, the mass vaccination campaign was halted when a hitherto unrecognized complication of vaccination was observed -Guillain-Barre syndrome, a progressive disorder of the central nervous system (Keenlyside et a]., 1980) . Nevertheless, the campaign was a considerable technological achievement, with rapid production of vaccine in quantity, and efficient administration on a large scale using jet guns.",

As regards the latter, most adult persons receiving current inactivated vaccines notice only local pain and stinging at the site of inoculation and although this may deter future acceptance of vaccine it is not a serious reaction. However, in children or unprimed adults, whole virus vaccine Population groups in which a more extended use of inactivated influenza A and B vaccine could be recommended may induce more serious side reactions, including fever. To circumvent these adverse effects, more recently developed vaccines are 'subunit' preparations containing only the relevant antigens which induce protective immunitynamely the two surface glycoprotein spikes of the virus, haemagglutinin and neuraminidase (reviewed by Tyrrell and Smith, 1979; Webster and Laver, 1966) . Such subunit vaccines are less reactogenic but unfortunately they are also less immunogenic in unprimed individuals. Studies are continuing in attempts to improve the immune response to HA subunits. For example, addition of synthetic adjuvants such as muramyl dipeptide (MDP or 6-stearoyl MDP) may increase the B cell response to the HA molecule, at least in animal models.",

The result of this genetic engineering experiment was a bacterium which synthesized influenza HA in amounts detectable by immunoprecipitation (around 2 pg/ml) (see also Chapter 2 and the experiments of Gething and Sambrook, 1982) . However, at this stage many obstacles remain. Firstly, the HA constitutes only 2-3% of the total protein synthesized by the bacterium and is not transported to the exterior. Thus, the HA has to be released by lysing the bacteria and purifying it from E.co/i proteins and endotoxins. Although the HA clearly possesses some antigenic determinants, of prime importance for vaccination is retention of immunogenicity. It is probable that enzymatic degradation occurs in the presence of E.co/i proteases and thus the HA molecule may be in monomer form, similar to HA removed from virus by the proteolytic enzyme bromelain. In this case the molecule may be poorly immunogenic and may need to be reconstituted onto a virosome, for example, to increase the immune response. On the other hand, the technology of bacterial cultivation on a large scale is well advanced and a single large fermentation batch could produce theoretically 100 mg of HA, enough antigen for 10 000 doses of vaccine at the current formulation.",

Because of its involvement in viral infection, antibodies may arise against this region in the course of defence against viral infection. The elegant studies of Atassi and Webster (1 983) with synthetic peptides comprising the HA2 region (residues 1-1 1) of influenza A virus and influenza B virus were carried out to investigate the antigenicity of this region of the HA molecule. Two peptides, comprising the fusion region (residues 1-1 1 of the HA2 part of HA) of strain A and strain B influenza virus, were synthesized and their abilities to bind rabbit, goat, and human anti-influenza antibodies were determined. In quantitative im-munoadsorbent titrations, the two peptides bound considerable amounts of antibodies in rabbit and goat antisera against virus or HA of the A or B strain, as well as in several human sera from patients recovering from influenza A . Of the 30 anti-HA monoclonal antibodies, 5 bound completely and 4 bound partially to the peptides. Antibodies were raised in rabbits against the peptides by immunizing with peptide-bovine serum albumin conjugates, or with the free peptides. Anti-peptide antibodies Rere bound by HA and by the intact virus of the respective strain. However, these antisera failed to exhibit significant virus neutralizing activity. The finding that sera from several individuals after viral infection had large amounts of antibodies directed against the fusion region unequivocally established it to be an important antigenic site on virus HA for humans under conditions of natural influenza infection.",

The antigenic site described by Atassi and Webster (1983) is not one of the four antigen regions suggested from examination of the X-ray structure of HA (see above).

Firstly the data in Table 7 .38 emphasizes the importance of influenza as a cause of sickness absence in this group of workers. Table  7 .39 shows data on subjective reactions in some of the employees following inactivated or live influenza vaccines. Most vaccinees experienced some local or even general reactions to vaccination and this was, perhaps, reflected in the acceptance rates for vaccine in successive years which declined (Table 7 .40). Of particular interest is the observation that over the 5 year period, days lost from sickness or absence were fewer in the vaccinated group compared with the unvaccinated group, although fluctuations were noted from year to year. Certificated sickness absences were also reduced significantly, both in the influenza and non-influenza period (Tables 7.41, 42) (showing the placebo effect of medical attention on persons reporting ill!). It might be added that a recent analysis of economic savings from vaccinating old persons in the USA has shown a considerable economic benefit (Riddiough et al., 1983) .",

In theory, there should be a greater opportunity for rapid production since up to 1000 doses of live virus vaccine can be recovered from a single embryonated hen's egg. Alternatively, influenza A virus strains can now be cultivated in human diploid cells and this may also have theoretical advantages. (Herrero et al., 1983 , Schild et al., 1983 . There is also experimental evidence that the immunity resulting from the administration of live attenuated vaccines is broader than that induced by inactivated vaccines and this may help circumvent the perennial problem of antigenic drift (reviewed by Potter and Oxford, 1979) .",

The viruses will not replicate at 37 C and hence, at least in theory, would not replicate in the lower respiratory tract and would be expected, in view of the accumulated mutations, to show signs of attenuation. Laboratory 'recombinants' or viruses with reassorted genomes between the L'U mutants and the most recent virulent antigenic variants are made, and assessed for virulence in volunteers. In this way a recombinant can be selected with ca genes from one parent and the HA and NA genes from the virulent parent, and such recombinant viruses are apparently attenuated for man.",

The rationale is similar to the ca approachviruses which are unable to replicate at 37 C cannot infect cells in the lower respiratory tract of man, and hence would be expected to show reduced virulence properties. However, a complication of some of the earlier studies with fs mutants has been some tendency to revert back to a more virulent non t s phenotype.

It has been shown quite clearly, however, that occasionally such recombinants still retain some virulence for man (Oxford et al., 1978) and such studies have, therefore, to proceed with caution. The present complex epidemiological situation with influenza A virus, with two antigenic subtypes co-circulating (H3N2 and H 1 N 1) introduces a further complication with live vaccines. If two such laboratory attenuated recombinants are administered to man then additional recombination events may occur in naturo leading to 'new' viruses perhaps with more virulent properties . However, such processes are probably occurring anyway in nature (Palese and Young, 1982) . Two live vaccine viruses administered together may interfere with each other's replication (Potter et al., 1983) and so result in the development of a distorted immune response to a single virus only. Thus, as many problems remain to be solved with influenza vaccines as with the development and use of specific anti-influenza virus inhibitors. The population groups in which more extended use of vaccine could be recommended are similar to those suggested for antivirals (Table 7 .37).",

Research work is centred now around biotechnology to produce immunogenic peptides and proteins and also more logical searches for antivirals using amino acid sequence data and also virus specific enzymes such as the virion transcriptase as targets.",
