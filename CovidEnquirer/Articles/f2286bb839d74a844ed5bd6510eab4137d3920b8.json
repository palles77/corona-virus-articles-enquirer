Significantly more patients in Group I had community-acquired respiratory illnesses (p=0.003) and complained of rhinorrhea (p<0.001) and sputum (p=0.008) than those in Group II. In Group I, significantly more patients with lower respiratory infections had uncontrolled underlying malignancies (p=0.038) and received reinduction or palliative chemotherapy (p=0.006) than those with upper respiratory infections. Conclusions: A multiplex PCR test should be considered for RVI diagnosis in immunocompromised children and adolescents with respiratory symptoms, especially in those with rhinorrhea or sputum prominent over a cough. The early application of the PCR test in patients with uncontrolled underlying malignancies may improve outcomes.",

Infection is the main cause of treatmentrelated mortality in patients with hematological malignancies. 1 Therefore, the early diagnosis and treatment of infection, as well as infection prevention, are essential to improve the prognosis of immune compromised patients. In these patients, neutropenic fever (NF) has been the focus, and bacterial and fungal infection is emphasized. 2 Among viruses, Herpesviridae, which maintains latency and reactivates during immune suppression caused by anti-cancer chemotherapy and hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), is considered a major pathogen. However, the causative pathogens are not identified in 53-79% of patients with NF, 3, 4 and some of which may be respiratory viruses (RVs).",

Because these conventional methods have low sensitivity for detecting rhinovirus and enterovirus, which are the most common causes of community-acquired respiratory viral infection (RVI), RVI was identified only in 6-22% of immune compromised children with respiratory symptoms in the past. [5] [6] [7] Also, most previous studies were restricted to reporting RVI due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus, influenza virus, and adenovirus, which could be diagnosed by conventional methods. [8] [9] [10] A polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test exhibiting improved sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of RVI in immune compromised patients compared to those of conventional methods has been introduced and its use has been extended since the 2000s. 5, 6, 11 Recent studies using PCR tests identified RVI in 33-76% of children with NF or cancer complaining of respiratory symptoms. 5,6,12-16 RSV and influenza virus were the most frequent causes of RVI in the era of conventional methods, [8] [9] [10] whereas rhinovirus was the most frequent cause in the era of PCR tests. 5, 6, [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] In spite of this epidemiological change accompanied by the introduction of PCR tests, reports on the clinical characteristics and prognosis of RVI in immune compromised children and adolescents using PCR tests are lacking. Accordingly, guidelines on the application of a PCR test for the diagnosis and proper management of RVI in immune compromised children and adolescents have not been established.",

LRI was diagnosed when abnormal findings were observed in chest imaging studies. Due to the difficulty associated with obtaining sputum samples and performing bronchoscopy in children and adolescents with underlying hematological malignancies, as they are prone to bleed, nasopharyngeal samples were used to diagnose LRI, although lower respiratory samples are preferred specimens. 18 Community-acquired respiratory illness was defined if respiratory symptoms developed before or within 2 days of admission. Hospital-acquired respiratory illness was defined if respiratory symptoms developed 2 or more days after admission. Neutropenia was defined as an absolute neutrophil count <500/mm 3 . Steroid use was defined if any type of glucocorticoids equivalent to 2 mg/kg/day (maximum 20 mg/day) of prednisolone or more were administered for longer than 5 days within 1 month prior to the development of respiratory illness. Oxygen therapy, mechanical ventilator care, intensive care unit admission, and death that occurred within 1 month after the development of respiratory illness were considered complications.

RVI was diagnosed in about half of the enrolled patients, consistent with the results of previous studies using PCR tests to diagnose RVI. 5, [12] [13] [14] [15] Rhinovirus rather than RSV and parainfluenza virus was the most frequent cause of RVI, consistent with the results of recent studies using PCR tests. 5,6,12-16 RVI investigation should be considered in immune compromised patients complaining of community-acquired respiratory symptoms, preferably in those with rhinorrhea or sputum predominant over a cough. If we consider that early termination of empirical antibiotic therapy led to a favorable outcome in children and adolescents with NF and RVI in a recent report by Santolaya et al, 15 early diagnosis of RVI by a PCR test in these patients can help to avoid an unnecessary antibiotic use. Neutropenia was identified in only 34.8% of the patients diagnosed with RVI in this study. Therefore, the diagnosis of RVI should not be restricted to patients with NF. As a matter of fact, patients in Group II, in whom the presence of RVs was not identified, were more likely to have neutropenia, hospital-acquired and severe respiratory illnesses, and infections with nonviral pathogens. This suggests that patients in Group II underwent more aggressive anti-cancer chemotherapies, had a more severe immunosuppression, and were hospitalized for longer periods, compared to patients in Group I. Thus, pulmonary edema arising from hyper-hydration during anti-cancer chemotherapy, pulmonary hemorrhage due to thrombocytopenia, and bacterial and fungal pneumonias could lead to respiratory symptoms in these patients. A negative PCR result in patients with NF and hospital-acquired respiratory illnesses may suggest the presence of more severe infection or treatment-related complications.",

Ribavirin-based anti-viral therapy can reduce progression from URI to LRI and mortality in RSV-infected HCT recipients; 23 however, it is not recommended in patients with hematological malignancies who are not receiving HCT and its effect on parainfluenza virus infection has not been confirmed. 24 In this study, 80.0% of patients diagnosed with RSV infection received ribavirin-based anti-viral therapy, regardless of receiving HCT, and none of them died due to RSV infection.

Most previous studies universally reported that LRI is associated with the increased mortality. 7, 10, 19, 23, [25] [26] [27] Even in rhinovirus infection, which causes milder respiratory illnesses compared to those of RSV, parainfluenza virus and influenza virus, mortality was significantly higher in patients with LRIs than that in those with URIs. 26 Therefore, the early detection of patients at risk of progression to LRIs and early application of proper management for LRIs are necessary to improve the outcome of RVI in immune compromised patients. Low absolute lymphocyte, neutrophil, and monocyte counts; relapsed underlying malignancies; unrelated or mismatched allogeneic-HCT; recent steroid use; oxygen need; and co-infections are risk factors for LRI or mortality. 9,10,23,25-27 These risk factors represent the severity of immune suppression in the infected hosts. 9,25 Accordingly, an immunodeficiency scoring system to predict outcomes and determine the administration of anti-viral therapy has been applied to RSV-infected HCT recipients. 28 The uncontrolled state of underlying hematological malignancies and the presence of co-infections were significantly associated with the development of LRI in this study, which underscores the importance of the host's overall immune status in the outcome of RVI. As a result, a multiplex PCR test for RVs should be performed preferentially in patients complaining of rhinorrhea or sputum and with relapsed or refractory underlying hematological malignancies, co-infections, or severe cytopenia. Considering that 73.3% of LRI cases progressed from URIs in this study, the early application of a multiplex PCR test during the URI period should be emphasized.",

The number of enrolled patients may not be appropriate, and we lacked a control group including patients without respiratory symptoms. Although lower respiratory samples, such as sputum and bronchial washing or bronchoalveolar lavage fluids, are preferred samples for LRI diagnosis, upper respiratory samples were used in this study. To assure an improved diagnosis of LRI, abnormal findings in chest imaging studies were mandatory for LRI diagnosis in this study; however, lower respiratory samples could reveal clearer pathogenic profiles. The seasonal distribution and epidemics of RVI in immune compromised patients are correlated with those observed in the community. 8, 29 During the study period, the epidemics of RSV and influenza virus infection in the community were not prominent in Korea compared to previous years. The inclusion of more RSV and influenza virus infection episodes may modify the outcome of RVI in this study. Future studies should analyze data gathered for several years to include more cases of RVI caused by a variety of RVs. A multiplex PCR test for RVs was not routinely performed in children and adolescents with respiratory symptoms in our hospital during the study period and was hardly performed in the outpatient clinic. Therefore, children and adolescents with mild respiratory symptoms and URIs could not be included in this study. The outcomes of RVI in immune compromised children and adolescents may be more favorable with the inclusion of mild RVI cases.",

Moreover, the PCR test should address patients with more severe immune suppression, e.g., those with relapsed or refractory underlying malignancies and co-infections, as they are prone to have severe RVI-related outcomes. In addition, infection control strategies to prevent RVI transmission within the hospital environment should be emphasized, considering the current scenario, in which effective anti-viral therapies have not been established for most RVI cases. Thus, early RVI detection by a PCR test may open a window of opportunity for early intervention and infection control.",
