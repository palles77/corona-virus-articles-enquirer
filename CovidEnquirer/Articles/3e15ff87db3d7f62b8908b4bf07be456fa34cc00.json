The scale of mass gatherings and the close proximity and overcrowding of individuals at these events increases the risk for importation, local spread, and subsequent exportation of infectious diseases. Outbreaks at mass gatherings including vaccine-preventable (e.g. meningitis [3] and measles [4] ) and non vaccine-preventable (e.g. Legionnaires [5] and shigellosis [6] ) infectious diseases have been documented.",

Preventive measures such as vaccinations, anticipatory surveillance [7] , and enhanced surveillance during and after the event are useful for preventing and quickly identifying disease threats either at the site of the gathering or elsewhere in the world.

Fortunately, these changes have dovetailed with improvements in mobile and digital technology, offering greater opportunities for and augmentation of traditional surveillance systems during major mass gatherings. These technologies include Internet-based systems, mobile phone applications, wireless sensor networks and syndromic surveillance systems. Because health and technological infrastructures are not consistent globally across regions, the utility of these diverse technologies is partially dependent on the geographic location of the gathering. This review describes the digital technologies that have emerged to help detect and predict disease outbreaks at some of the world's largest and most popular mass gatherings. We focus on the Hajj, the Olympics, Athletic World Cup gatherings (specifically, the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) World Cup and Rugby World Cup), and other mass gathering events.",

The event, which usually lasts for about a month and a half, requires careful planning and disease-risk assessment in order to detect and control infectious disease outbreaks. Kumbh Mela gatherings have been associated with major outbreaks of cholera [15] . Telemedicine-the use of electronic resources in the exchange and transmission of medical knowledge and data-was credited with aiding to avert a possible cholera epidemic at the 2001 gathering [16] . Researchers have also used novel technologies such as Apple iPads to geo-locate pilgrims visiting hospitals during Kumbh Mela [11, 12] ; however, most of the public health success can be attributed to sanitation, and the sufficient availability of hospitals, doctors and medical staff. In addition, thousands of sweepers are charged with the collection of both faecal material and other rubbish estimated at 40 to 50 tons each day [13, 17] . Such sanitation practices help to limit cases of diarrhoea, Escherichia coli, cholera and other infections.",

Muslims also gather in Mecca year-round to perform a 'minor' pilgrimage called Umrah. The month of Ramadan is the peak time for performing Umrah and the number of participants can be as high as during the Hajj. Given both the magnitude of these events, and the geographic diversity represented among the pilgrims, a broad range of infectious diseases can be introduced. Respiratory infections occur frequently among pilgrims returning from the Hajj [2, 18, 22] . In addition to rhinovirus, risk for contracting tuberculosis is as high as 10% [2, 23] . The vast majority of pilgrims travel from low-income countries where tuberculosis is endemic, and though they may not be symptomatic upon arrival, the disease may be reactivated by the physical stress of the pilgrimage [2] . This said, the leading cause of hospitalization during Hajj is pneumonia, which may be caused by a wide array of common infectious pathogens such as Streptococcus pneumoniae [24] . However, evidence suggests that the novel Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which was first discovered in 2012, may also present clinically as pneumonia [25] . Following a large outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome in spring 2014, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been particularly conscientious about surveillance during the 2014 Hajj season [2, 22, 24] . In addition to infectious disease surveillance, a number of novel digital technologies have emerged in recent years that can be useful for a variety of other problems that commonly arise during the Hajj, including crowd control to avoid trampling and identification of pilgrims who are lost, dead, or injured [2, 20, 23] .",

A BSN is a highly specialized application of WSN in which on-body sensors monitor an individual's biometrics (e.g. heart rate, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, etc.). When combined, these two networks can be used to locate pilgrims who are ill and send ambulatory services to their coordinates if necessary. Similarly, Mitchell et al. outline a system that can track pilgrims using radio frequency identification (RFID) technology [20] . This particular solution also offers a mobile application for pilgrims with smartphones, which can be used not only to further supplement the RFID location data but also to call for an ambulance in the case of an emergency.",
