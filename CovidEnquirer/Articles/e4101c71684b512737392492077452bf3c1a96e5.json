            "text": "Background: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has published guidelines for hand hygiene practices, recommending a handwash regimen that alternates between waterless alcohol products and antimicrobial or nonantimicrobial soap and water. The advent of an alcohol-based product that can be used with or without water (ie, water optional) to decontaminate the hands while providing immediacy of kill and antimicrobial persistence could reduce the confusion associated with handwash guidelines. Such a product has been developed, is alcohol-based (61%), and zinc pyrithione (ZPT) preserved (61% alcohol-ZPT) and has proven to be fully compliant with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and CDC guidelines. Methods: FDA-required testing of the 61% alcohol-ZPT product for the health care personnel handwash indication was performed as outlined in the Tentative Final Monograph (TFM) for Health-Care Antiseptic Drug Products, employing waterless and water-aided product applications. It was next assessed for antimicrobial persistence and residual effects by comparing it, in separate waterless and water-aided applications, with commonly available handwashes containing various antimicrobials in a 5-day study employing 49 subjects, in which samples were collected immediately and at 4 hours and 8 hours postapplication. The skin conditioning properties of this formulation were investigated via appropriate methods. Results: The 61% alcohol-ZPT product easily produced .3.0 log 10 reduction in the indicator strain (Serratia marcescens) following the first wash, exceeding the 2.0 log 10 FDA requirement. This level of performance was maintained through the tenth wash, surpassing the 3.0 log 10 FDA requirement for the handwash indication. For the assessment of persistence and residual effect in the waterless mode, the water-optional, 61% alcohol-ZPT product consistently produced log 10 reductions of nearly 3.5 or greater at every point over the entire study period. In the water-aided configuration, similar results were obtained as log 10 reductions of 2.5 were observed. The formulation is nonirritating, actually contributing to hand skin condition. Conclusions: The 61% alcohol-ZPT product exceeds all FDA criteria for the health care personnel handwash indication and is a significant advancement in the concept of skin antisepsis. It represents a single product suitable for use in all hand hygiene settings, demonstrating improved antimicrobial persistence and residual effects. The 61% alcohol-ZPT formulation contributes positively to overall hand conditioning, and a previously reported study has documented it to be virucidal for several DNA and RNA viruses. (Am J Infect",

            "text": "A unique water optional health care personnel handwash provides antimicrobial persistence and residual effects while decreasing the need for additional products Among the many variables impacting the success of an infection control program, none is of greater importance than routine hand decontamination of the health care personnel. Since the times of Ignaz Semmelweis, numerous articles have been published showing a strong positive correlation between adequacy of hand hygiene practices and incidence of nosocomial and iatrogenic infections. 1 Likewise, studies have shown compliance with routine hand-cleansing procedures to be a variable at least as important in controlling rates of infection as is the antimicrobial effectiveness of the hand-cleansing formulations. Compliance is undesirably poor among many categories of health care personnel that have been studied. 2 The advent of waterless alcohol handrubs provided a quick, easily practiced process for hand sanitation that was highly effective in eliminating transient, potentially pathogenic microorganisms from the hands of health care providers. 1, 3, 4 These products helped to increase compliance with hand sanitation guidelines, but results from surrogate testing showed that they could not, and should not, replace thorough handwashing as an infection control process. Build-up of organic debris over time and repeated use progressively depreciated the antimicrobial effectiveness of the alcohol hand sanitizers. Moreover, the alcoholonly products provide no appreciable antimicrobial persistence.",

            "text": "According to Hilburn et al, 4 in the United States, there are 2.0 million nosocomial infections each year. These account for 5% to 10% of hospitalized patients, result in 88,000 deaths (eighth leading cause), and cost the US economy over $4.5 billon annually. Again, compliance with established handwashing policies was considered a key factor in breaking the chain of infection. Often, compliance is low, in the range of only 20% to 50%. Proper hand hygiene is a very important tool in reducing nosocomial infections; one that could realize potential annual savings in the range of $1.5 billion. 4 Recent studies with alcohol-based hand sanitizers have shown that these products can reduce the incidence of nosocomial infections by 30.0% to 36.1%. 4 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has published hand hygiene practices for health care personnel, recommending that alcohol-based hand sanitizers be used routinely, interspersed frequently with thorough handwashings throughout the workday. 3 Therefore, hand hygiene as envisioned by the CDC could be accomplished by the routine use of a combination of waterless hand sanitizers and wateraided handwashes. Compliance with CDC handwash guidelines may be enhanced by an alcohol-based product that could be used with or without waterbecause this one, single product would prove beneficial for those incidents in which the hands are soiled and a water-aided wash is needed, as well as for the more routine waterless hand hygiene episodes. Therefore, the number of products required for hand sanitization would be reduced and, thus, some of the confusion surrounding the hand hygiene experience and compliance eliminated.",

Even so, persistent effects (continued antimicrobial activity for an extended period-eg, 6 hours-following product use to prevent microbial recolonization) and residual effects (the progressive increase or cumulative antimicrobial activity with repeated use of a product over time) would be properties highly desirable in a health care handwash product. 6, 7 Neither of these characteristics are inherent with alcohol-only hand gels. As stated above, ZPT was incorporated as the preservative system for this product. This was done in accordance with the TFM authorization allowing for the addition of preservatives to alcohol-based products. 5 The FDA's rationale is that alcohol-based products of skin antisepsis do not provide the antimicrobial persistence necessary to prevent microbial recolonization beyond 2 to 3 hours. A properly selected preservative added to alcoholbased products can extend the antimicrobial effects for hours longer. Therefore, a second comparative study was designed, in which 4 products were tested-a novel, water-optional 61% alcohol-ZPT (Triseptin Water-optional; HEALTHPOINT, Ltd., Fort Worth, TX), a no-rinse 61% ethanol hand sanitizer without a preservative system (Avagard D; 3M Health Care, St. Paul, MN), a 0.5% triclosan water-aided handwash (CV Medicated Lotion Soap; STERIS Corporation, Mentor, OH), a 2% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) water-aided handwash (BactoShield; STERIS Corporation)-and a 4% CHG handwash was employed as a reference product (HIBICLENS; Regent Medical, Norcross, GA). The thrust of this 5-day study was to characterize and compare the immediate, persistent, and residual antimicrobial effects of these products on the resident and transient microflora present on the hands of human volunteers. In addition, the skin-conditioning benefits of the 61% alcohol-ZPT formulation were measured via an exaggerated handwash study 8, 9 ; the virucidal effectiveness while assessed was reported elsewhere previously. 10, 11 All data reported here were obtained by tests performed at contract laboratory facilities.

This test requires the contamination of the hands with 5.0 ml of a solution containing not less that 10 8 organisms/mL of the indicator strain (Serratia marcescens) at baseline determination and prior to each of the required 10 washes. Therefore, .10 9 cfu of Serratia marcescens are applied to the hands during the course of the test. Differences in efficacy that are in the range of ;0.5 log 10 under the conditions of unequal wash times should be viewed cautiously. For these reasons, the authors are more likely to consider the data generated in the corresponding persistence and residual effects study (Fig 4) as reflective of actual product performance because a total of 20 washes are used over a 5-day period for each product, thus minimizing to some degree the lack of parity associated with wash times.",

These results uniformly indicate that real skin-conditioning benefits are realized when the 61% alcohol-ZPT product is used in a setting such as that exemplified by health care, in which hand sanitation is practiced repeatedly and often.",

            "text": "The virucidal efficacy of this formulation has been documented previously. 11 The data confirmed the virucidal action of the 61% alcohol-ZPT product against a wide variety of viral agents to include coronavirus (HCoV, ATCC VR-740, both HCoV and SARS-HCoV belong to the virus family Coronaviridae), the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1, from Zepto Metrix Corp. of Buffalo, NY), hepatitis A virus (HAV, from CREM, University of Ottawa), herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1, ATCC VR-260), and human rotavirus (strain Wa, ATCC VR-2018). These agents represent both RNA and DNA viruses, some with envelopes and others without, which are known to be responsible for a significant amount of human morbidity and some mortality. Furthermore, HAV and the human rotavirus are known to be resistant to several of the antimicrobials commonly used for hand antisepsis. 10 For these in vitro studies, the viral agents were cultured using standards methods in cell lines appropriate for propagation to levels at or above the required titer of 10 6.00 infectious units/mL. The viruses were harvested, baseline numbers determined, and exposed for 3 minutes (30 seconds for the human coronavirus) to the test formulation diluted by virus inoculum to a 90% concentration. Following exposure to the test product, the surviving population was determined for each virus, employing techniques appropriate for that virus. To be considered virucidal, the baseline populations must be reduced by not less than 3 log 10 beyond observed cytotoxicity. All testing was performed per American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) method E 1052-96, a Standard Test Method for Efficacy of Antimicrobial Agents Against Viruses in Suspension. 12 Routine use of the 61% alcohol-ZPT product would not only greatly reduce the transient and resident bacterial and yeast flora but also might decrease significantly the likelihood of transmitting viral agents of disease to others by contaminated hands. This improvement in hand hygiene could also yield significant economic savings because viruses are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in humans, and even mild infections can be a significant burden on the health care system and the general economy. Data obtained in the United States for over 2 decades incriminate viruses in 5% of all nosocomial infections. This number climbs to as high as 32% in the pediatric setting. More recent developments in the medical community suggest that the impact of viruses as agents of nosocomial disease may be greater now. Viruses can survive on human hands for hours, and experiments with human volunteers have demonstrated the poten-tial for hands to spread viral agents, including those of the common cold and enteric diseases. As one might expect, caregivers and food handlers are most often implicated in this type of disease transmission. 4, 10 In summary, the 61% alcohol-ZPT product formulation meets or exceeds all requirements of the ASTM method to be considered as a virucidal agent. Properly formulated alcohol-based products can have potent virucidal action against even some of the most resistant viral agents. This important aspect of skin antisepsis should not be overlooked when selecting a surgical scrub or health care personnel handwash.",

It is formulated with surfactants and therefore is appropriate for use as either a water-aided or a waterless health care handwash. It may be used waterless for hands that are not visibly soiled or with water for hands that are contaminated with blood, other body fluids, or other types of organic material or to assist in the removal of bacterial spores such as those of Clostridium difficile. The product provides antimicrobial persistence, and residual effects and repeated use contributes positively to overall skin conditioning. It is cidal for many viral agents of human disease that are readily transmitted via contact with contaminated hands. Finally, it is nontoxic and not subject to inactivation by anions or changes in pH as has been observed with CHG. 13, 14 A product with these attributes fulfills a previously unmet need and could favorably impact compliance with handwashing protocols.",

We believe that the data presented in our paper offer an alternate point of view and evidence that properly formulated alcohol-based products of hand antisepsis will provide excellent immediate kill, as well as persistent and residual antimicrobial effects. In addition, these results are achievable against hand flora with product use for as brief as 15 seconds.",
