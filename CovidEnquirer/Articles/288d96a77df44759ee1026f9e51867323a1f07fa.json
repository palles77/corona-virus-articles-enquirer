Veterinarians investigating outbreaks of neonatal calf diarrhea must first make recommendations for therapy of affected calves, then take action to protect susceptible and unborn calves from ongoing exposure and illness. Finally, attention should focus on determining what future actions might prevent the disease in subsequent calving seasons. The outbreak investigation sometimes becomes sidetracked in the pursuit of an etiologic agent rather than identifying more useful explanations for the outbreak. Knowing the etiologic agent may provide an explanation for the proximal cause of a calf's illness or death (although that knowledge rarely explains the outbreak) or provide a solution for treatment, control, or prevention.",

[25] [26] [27] Calves may have an age-specific susceptibility to neonatal diarrhea that occurs as lactogenic immunity is waning and before the calf is fully capable of developing an active immune response. 21 Regardless of the reason for the age-specificity of neonatal calf diarrhea, this period defines the age of susceptibility, as well as the age calves are most likely to become infective and shed the agents in their feces. [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] Age specificity of susceptibility and infectivity has important implications for controlling transmission of the pathogens of neonatal diarrhea because in some calving systems the number of susceptible and infective calves can change dynamically with time.

Exposure to pathogens may occur through direct contact with other cattle or via contact with contaminated environmental surfaces. Establishing environmental hygiene has long been recognized as important for controlling neonatal calf diarrhea, 36,37 but doing so is often a challenge. An effective contact is an exposure to pathogens of a dose-load or duration sufficient to cause disease. Crowded conditions increase opportunities for effective contacts with infected animals or contaminated surfaces. Ambient temperature (e.g., excessive heat or cold) and moisture (e.g., mud or snow) are important stressors that impair the ability of the calf to resist disease and may influence pathogen numbers, as well as opportunities for oral ingestion.",

This multiplier effect can result in high calf infectivity and widespread environmental contamination with pathogens. 38 Each calf serves as growth media for pathogen production, amplifying the dose-load of pathogen it received. [27] [28] [29] Therefore calves born later in the calving season may receive larger doseloads of pathogens and, in turn, may become relatively more infective by growing even greater numbers of agents. Eventually the dose-load of pathogens overwhelms the calf's ability to resist disease. These factors alone or in combination may explain observations that calves born later in the calving season are at greater risk for disease or death (Smith and colleagues, unpublished). 24",

However, the endemic nature of the common pathogens of neonatal calf diarrhea makes it unlikely that cattle populations could be made biosecure from these agents. Maternal immunity is clearly important to calf susceptibility to enteric agents, 6,40 but lactogenic immunity wanes with time 21 and managers of extensive beef cattle systems have limited practical opportunities to improve rates of passive antibody transfer. In addition, vaccines are not available against all pathogens of calf diarrhea, they may not induce sufficient crossprotection, 32 and pathogens may evade the protection afforded by vaccination by evolving away from vaccine strains. 41 For these reasons, a biocontainment approach to control neonatal calf diarrhea seems prudent and logical. 39, 42 ",

These principles have been successfully applied in calf hutch systems to control neonatal diseases in dairy calves. 43 Various biocontainment systems for beef herds have been developed to prevent neonatal calf diarrhea. [44] [45] [46] Each of these are strategies to manage cattle in a system that prevents calves from having effective contacts with pathogens by reducing opportunities for exposure and transmission. The management actions defined as the Sandhills Calving System prevent effective contacts among beef calves by (1) segregating calves by age to prevent direct and indirect transmission of pathogens from older to younger calves and (2) moving pregnant cows to clean calving pastures to minimize pathogen dose-load in the environment and contact time between calves and the larger portion of the cow herd. The objective of the system is to recreate the more ideal conditions that exist at the start of the calving season during each subsequent week of the season. These more ideal conditions are that cows are calving on ground that has been previously unoccupied by cattle (for at least some months), and older, infective calves are not present.",

After 2 weeks the cows that have not yet calved are moved to Pasture 2. Existing cow-calf pairs remain in Pasture 1. After a week of calving in Pasture 2, cows that have not calved are moved to Pasture 3 and cow-calf pairs born in Pasture 2 remain in Pasture 2.
