This health report provided information that revealed gastrointestinal consultations as the main reason for large breed dogs to visit the veterinary office in 2014. From this report, it could also be clearly appreciated that gastroenteritis represents an average of 4% of all canine cases that present to the veterinary hospital on any given day with colitis or large bowel diarrhea representing between 3% and 6% of the working diagnoses.",

            "text": "Vomiting is a complex reflex that leads to the forceful expulsion of stomach contents through the mouth and requires the coordination of the gastrointestinal, musculoskeletal, and nervous systems. Many structures are involved in the vomiting process. These include the emetic center located in the reticular formation of the medulla oblongata, the chemoreceptor trigger zone located on the floor of the fourth ventricle within the brain, and the vagal and sympathetic neurons stimulated by receptors in the abdominal viscera. 2 Activation of the vomiting reflex can occur for many reasons. These include local or systemic inflammation, irritation, distention, hypertonicity, emetogenic substances including toxins and medications (eg, apomorphine, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, some antineoplastic agents), and impulses that arise from the vestibular center because of motion sickness. 3 The color of vomitus helps the clinician identify its origin. Clear vomitus constitutes swallowed saliva from the stomach, yellow represents reflux of digested bile from the stomach, and green coloration suggests undigested bile originating from the upper duodenum caused by an obstruction or ileus. A brown fluid with a fetid odor is most likely from the small intestines and suggests a total obstruction or generalized ileus. In the case of primary gastrointestinal disease, the presence of blood in the vomitus typically appears as a red-tinged fluid or as \"coffee grounds.\" Streaks or flecks of blood within clear vomitus may come from gastric or esophageal irritation and is not of specific pathology. 4 Patients that present for vomiting display a wide constellation of clinical signs that vary from vague to pathognomic for a particular condition or etiology (Box 1). The diagnostic dilemma is to unveil the inciting cause, treat and correct it, while at the same time treating all secondary complications related to the vomiting. In cats, vomiting is a particularly common and complex problem. Adult cats often have different and more chronic causes of vomiting than kittens. Nonetheless, the condition remains a common reason for cats to be presented for veterinary care. 5 In domestic cats, vomiting is caused by primary gastrointestinal diseases and extragastrointestinal diseases. Examples of primary disease include infectious, inflammatory, parasitic, obstructive (foreign body, trichobezoar, worm impaction), drug-related, or nutritional. Extragastrointestinal causes include endocrinopathies (eg, hyperthyroidism); metabolic disease (eg, renal failure); inflammatory diseases; and other disease processes, such as hepatopathy, pancreatitis, or neoplasia (especially alimentary lymphoma). This wide spectrum of potential causes of vomiting in cats increases the difficulty for the practitioner in making a definitive diagnosis. 6 DIARRHEA Diarrhea is the result of excess fecal water that may be from decreased intestinal absorption, increased intestinal secretion, or both. Most cases of diarrhea are mild and self-limiting requiring minimal diagnostic testing and symptomatic care, but for more severe cases, diagnostic testing and intensive therapy are warranted (Box 2). Small intestinal diarrhea typically results in a larger fecal volume and fluid, electrolyte, and protein loss, and acid-base abnormalities. Large bowel diarrhea is characterized by small volume, multiple defecations, with feces of a soft consistency, and the presence of mucus or fresh blood. Tenesmus may or may not be present. It is important to differentiate small bowel versus large bowel because it has a significant impact on the diagnostic and treatment plan. Most commonly, the duration of the diarrhea is subjectively classified as acute (<14 days) or chronic (>14 days). The mechanism of diarrhea in the feline and canine patient is divided into four subcategories and these can occur alone or in any combination: (1) secretory diarrhea, (2) osmotic diarrhea, (3) increased intestinal permeability, and (4) abnormal gastrointestinal motility. 7, 8 Secretory diarrhea results when there is a disturbance to the ion pumps in the gastrointestinal epithelium Fluid and Electrolyte Therapy caused by bacterial endotoxins. When there is compromise to the gastrointestinal mucosa from gastrointestinal mucosal erosions (eg, severe shock, toxins, hyperthermia, foreign body) or blunting of villi (eg, viral or bacterial pathogenic agents) there is fluid loss. Diarrhea can occur via any or all of these mechanisms. For example, the presence of cellular debris in the intestinal lumen contributes to osmotic diarrhea, hypomotility results in ileus and increased permeability, and endotoxins represent ion pump inhibitors resulting in secretory diarrhea. The presence of frank red blood (hematochezia) or black tarry stool (melena) should alert the clinician that there is a disruption to the integrity of the gastrointestinal epithelium and protein loss, and bacterial translocation should be anticipated. In conclusion, the gastrointestinal patient suffers from malaise and anorexia that decreases water and caloric intake, vomiting and diarrhea that results in fluid losses, and occasionally pancreatitis or peritonitis that results in redistribution of fluid and consequently leads to a negative fluid balance. 9 It is imperative that these conditions and their sequelae are treated promptly and appropriately via fluid therapy to optimize a successful outcome.",

Having a recent past BW is most useful in determining the degree of fluid loss. A loss of 1 mm of water is equivalent to 1 g; therefore, a loss of 1 kg suggests a loss of 1000 mm of body water. 12 Animals with hyporexia and anorexia may lose approximately 0.1 to 0.3 kg BW/day/1000 kcal of energy requirements. 12 An exception occurs in the case of third spacing when there is loss from the circulating volume and no appreciable loss in BW.",

This kind of fluid has an osmolality similar to that of plasma and the extracellular compartment. Sodium has the largest effect on the fluid osmolality because of its having the highest concentration in the extracellular fluid compartment. 11, 14 Water follows sodium. Because of this intimate relationship, the sodium concentration of the fluid is important in selecting the appropriate fluid to treat a condition. The constitution of a fluid, with buffers and electrolytes, is also a consideration in making an adequate fluid choice. In general, vomiting and diarrhea result in isotonic dehydration, and the serum sodium concentration is within the normal reference range. A replacement fluid should be chosen that is nearly physiologic in sodium concentration and osmolality: a sodium concentration of 130 mEq/L to 154 mEq/L ( Table 3) . If there is a change in the sodium concentration from the normal reference range, then an appropriate fluid should be chosen. If the deficit occurs acutely, the derangement can be corrected acutely, but if it is chronic then it must be corrected slowly over time.

General guidelines for initial monitoring consist of weighing the patient every 12 hours; monitoring hematocrit and total protein concentration, blood glucose, electrolytes, and blood gases every 6 to 12 hours; and assessing perfusion parameters and fluid in/urine out every 2 to 4 hours. A good rule of thumb to use in evaluating if the fluid requirements have been met or need adjusting is remembering that 1 mL of fluid weighs 1 g.

Most recently, the attention has shifted to focus on the indigenous nonpathogenic microorganisms and the myriad ways in which they benefit the host. The term \"probiotic\" was first used in 1965 to define \"a substance secreted by one microorganism which stimulates the growth of another,\" and was thus contrasted with the term antibiotic.

This is especially true in the patient with hypovolemia with increased vascular permeability and low colloid osmotic pressure. Colloid therapy increases the volume of IV fluid retention and decreases the overall use of crystalloid therapy. The most current shock dosage recommendation for the use of hydroxyethyl starch is up to 20 mL/kg in the dog and up to 10 mL/kg in the cat. This is an area under current scrutiny because new studies reveal that hydroxyethyl starch may be associated with a negative prognosis. [21] [22] [23] [24] This is caused by the concern for colloids causing fluid overload, hemodilution, and coagulation anomalies (eg, thrombocytopathia, increased fibrin clot fragility, decreased coagulation factors VIII and von Willebrand factor). New evidence-based data indicate concern for renal injury and allergic reactions in emergent fluid therapy in humans, but this has not been extrapolated or perceived in veterinary medicine.

Developing an appropriate and evolving fluid therapy plan is an important tool to decrease the length of hospitalization and improve care for the patient. Monitoring weight is the most sensitive tool for assessment of dehydration and rehydration because acute changes in weight reflect acute gain or loss of body water. The clinician must remember that a drastic gain or loss of 1 kg is approximately the equivalent of gaining or losing 1 L of fluid. Following hematocrit and total proteins serially during fluid therapy also alerts the clinician to the effectiveness of therapy because a decrease in both suggests successful IV rehydration.
