Effective 48 antiviral and anti-coagulation agents with safe clinical profiles are urgently needed to improve the 49 overall prognosis. We screened an FDA approved drug library and found that an anticoagulant agent 50 dipyridamole (DIP) suppressed HCoV-19 replication at an EC50 of 100 nM in vitro. It also elicited 51 potent type I interferon responses and ameliorated lung pathology in a viral pneumonia model. In 52 analysis of twelve HCoV-19 infected patients with prophylactic anti-coagulation therapy, we found 53 that DIP supplementation was associated with significantly increased platelet and lymphocyte counts 54 and decreased D-dimer levels in comparison to control patients. Two weeks after initiation of DIP 55 treatment, 3 of the 6 severe cases (60%) and all 4 of the mild cases (100%) were discharged from the 56 hospital. One critically ill patient with extremely high levels of D-dimer and lymphopenia at the time 57 of receiving DIP passed away. All other patients were in clinical remission. In summary, HCoV-19 58 infected patients could potentially benefit from DIP adjunctive therapy by reducing viral replication, 59 suppressing hypercoagulability and enhancing immune recovery. Larger scale clinical trials of DIP 60 are needed to validate these therapeutic effects.",

In silico and in vitro, we demonstrated that DIP 107 possessed anti-HCoV-19 effects. In a VSV-induced pneumonia model, we also confirmed that DIP 108 elicited potent antiviral immunity and significantly improved the survival rate.

Notably, in experimental models of SARS-CoV infection, Spike protein engagement 78 decreases ACE2 expression and activates the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). 6 RAS activation 79 promotes platelet adhesion and aggregation and increases the risk for pulmonary embolism, 80 hypertension and fibrosis. 8-11 It also accelerates cardiac and kidney injury by increasing local 81 angiotensin II concentrations. 12-14 Apart from affecting the classic RAS pathway, ACE2 deficiency in 82 the intestine is associated with malnutrition and colonic inflammation. 15 83 84 Infection from SARS-CoV can result in severe lymphopenia, prolonged coagulation profiles, lethal 85 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), watery diarrhea, cardiac disease and sudden death. 9,16-18 86 Many of these features have also been reported for COVID-19: prolonged coagulation profiles, 87 elevated D-dimer levels, severe lymphopenia, ARDS, hypertension, and acute heart injury in 88 ICU-admitted patients. 2,19 Given that angiotensin II levels were highly elevated in the HCoV-19 89 infected patients, 20 RAS was likely activated in HCoV-19 infected patients, Thus, prophylactic 90 anti-coagulation therapy should be considered for mollifying the multi-organ damage during severe 91 COVID-19.",

We confirmed that DIP 323 possessed potent antiviral immunity to single-stranded RNA viruses in vitro, and in a VSV-induced 324 viral pneumonia model in vivo. Most importantly, a laboratory confirmed EC50 of 0.1 \uf06dM to 325 suppress HCoV-19 replication highly suggested that the therapeutic dosage of DIP may potentiate 326 effective antiviral responses in infected patients . These findings are in concordance with the overall 327 remarkable outcomes in patients receiving one week of DIP adjunctive therapy, seven of the twelve 328 patients were discharged from the hospital and four achieved clinical remission. 329 330 We found that DIP adjunctive treatment was effective in preventing hypercoagulability if applied 331 early in the severe COVID-19 patients.
