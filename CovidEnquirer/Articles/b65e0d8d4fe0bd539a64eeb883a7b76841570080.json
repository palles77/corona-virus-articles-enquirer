A specific, dose-dependent response to the three major recombinant viral proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N), purified by affinity chromatography, was characterized. Induction of in vitro antibody synthesis was analyzed. The purified recombinant viral proteins induced the in vitro synthesis of neutralizing TGEV-specific antibodies when porcine TGEV-immune cells were stimulated with each of the combinations made with two of the major structural proteins: S + N, S + M, and to a minor extent with M + N, but not by the individual proteins. S-protein was dissociated from purified virus using NP-40 detergent and then micellar S-protein oligomers (S-rosettes) were formed by removing the detergent. These occurred preferentially by the association of more than 10 S-protein trimmers. These S-rosettes in collaboration with either N or M-proteins elicited TGEV-specific antibodies with titers up to 84 and 60%, respectively, of those induced by the whole virus. N-protein could be partially substituted by a 15-mer peptide that represents a T helper epitope previously identified :in N-protein (Ant6n et al. (1995)). These results indicate that the induction of high levels of TGEV-specific antibodies requires stimulation by at least two viral proteins, and that optimum responses are induced by a combination of S-rosettes and the nucleoprotein.",

Fusion proteins were purified by amylose resin affinity chromatography following the manufacturer's instructions (New England Biolabs) with the following modifications: after binding of induced bacterial extracts, column was washed with four (Laemmli, 1970) and Western blot (Towbin et al., 1979) . Fifteen-mer N321 peptide was synthesized and assayed as previously described (Ant6n et al., 1995) .

Purified micellar S-rosette oligomers. TGEV purified in sucrose gradients (Jim6nez et al., 1986) was dissociated with NP-40 and the micellar S-rosettes were formed during detergent removal by centrifugation on a sucrose gradient. S-rosettes were negatively stained with 2% sodium phosphotungstate and studied by electron microscopy. The large figure shows that S-rosettes formed micellar aggregates with a variable number of S peplcmers, but the aggregates usually included more then ten S-peplomers. A TGEV particle has been included in the inset for size comparative purposes. Bar length represents 100 nm. anti-TGEV serum (Fig. 2B ) or rabbit anti-MBP serum (data not shown).",

For this purpose, TGEV-immune PBL were depleted of macrophages and cultured in the presence of several antigens (Fig. 5) . The specificity of the response was demonstrated because virus-specific antibodies were generated only by TGEV-or TGEV proteins-stimulated cells, while control antigens as MHV or MBP never induced the in vitro synthesis of TGEV-specific antibodies (Fig.  5) . Moreover, nonspecific stimulation of T-cells by Concanavalin A did not induce antibody synthesis (data not shown). None of TGEV proteins alone (S, N, or M) induced significant amounts of TGEV-specific antibodies, but 20% of the total antibody synthesis induced by purified TGEV was reconstituted after stimulation with a combination of recombinant purified S and N-proteins. Combined stimulation by S + M-proteins also yielded significant TGEV-specific antibodies as deter- mined by RIA (Fig. 5) . M +N-proteins gave weak responses above control values. When Nprotein was substituted by the 15-mer N321 peptide containing a strong T-cell epitope, a weak but significant antibody synthesis was also detected. Interestingly, cult ares of immune lymphocytes stimulated with S-rosettes in collaboration with either N or M-proteins also induced high antibody titers to TGEV (Fig. 5) . In lymphocytes cultures stimulated with S-rosettes, the antibody responses were partially elicited if the N-protein was substituted by the N-protein derived T-cell peptide N321 containing an strong T-cell epitope.",

Intragastric infection of swine with a virulent TGEV strain (MAD88) induced strong blastogenic responses preferentially in the MLN. Weaker responses were found in PP and PBL, as expected for infections preferentially localized in the gastro-intestinal tract. Vigorous MLN proliferation responses to virulent TGEV have also been reported (Brim et al., 1994) . Analysis of the humoral responses in virulent TGEV-exposed pigs demonstrates the greatest numbers of antibody-secreting cells in the MLN (Berthon et al., 1990; VanCott et al., 1993) . In this report, the blastogenic response of lymphocytes from TGEV-infected miniswine, boosted with inactivated virus, is characterized. The blastogenic response was of similar magnitude for S, M, and N-proteins, although optimum responses to N-protein required higher protein concentrations. This effect might be due to a lower number of N-specific T-cell precursors or to a lower density of T-cell epitopes on N-protein. It is not anticipated that T-cells specific for N-protein are of intrinsically lower affinity than S and M-protein-specific T-cells, since three of the four identified strong TGEV T-cell epitopes are located on N-protein (Antdn et al., 1995) .",

The response of haplotype-defined miniswine to other infectious agents, such as inactivated Bordetella bronchiseptica, Triehinella spiralis, pseudorabies-modified live virus, and foot-and-mouth-disease virus (FMDV), are influenced by genetic factors, possibly SLA linked genes (Lunney et al., 1986; Rothschild et al., 1984) .",

In the blastogenic response to S-protein, no dominant T-cell epitope has been identified using lymphocytes from the three haplotypes. All the accumulated data indicate that the clear blastogenic response elicited by S-protein is due to the addition of minor T-cell responses induced by many weak T-cell epitopes distributed along the entire S-protein length. This statement is based on several observations: (i) no proliferative response was observed by stimulating TGEV-immune lymphocytes with overlapping synthetic peptides spanning the full length S-protein; (ii) identical weak stimulation indices were obtained when the immune cells were stimulated with recombinant S-protein fragments spanning the half amino-terminus of S-protein, and no significant increase of the blastogenic response was observed when any combination of two of these recombinant fragments was used; (iii) peptides comprising segments of the S-protein with highest score for T-cell sites (Ant6n et al., 1995) did not elicit a blastogenic response; (iv) minor non-significant responses to S-protein peptides were observed which were not coincident among the three haplotypes (data not shown). The lack of a blastogenic response to the overlapping S-protein peptides has been the result of stimulating with peptides acetylated in their amino-terminus and containing an amidated ~-alanine at their C-terminus. It is very unlikely that these chemical modifications at the ends of the peptides could have inhibited their recognition by immune T-cells, because the peptides were synthesized to a resolution of one amino acid. Nevertheless, we cannot completely rule out this possibility.",

In contrast, both S or Nproteins induced similar levels of T-cell proliferation. In addition, S-rosettes in collaboration with N-protein elicited in vitro antibody responses accounting for 84% of the response induced by the native virus. This cooperation could be explained on the basis of a B and T-cell collaboration considering that the S-protein provides the B-cell epitopes, and the N-protein elicited the T helper responses. In fact, no dominant T-cell epitopes have been defined in S-protein while strong T-cell epitopes have been identified on N-protein. Costimulation by S-rosettes and M-protein induced the synthesis of TGEV-specific antibodies up to 60% of the antibody levels induced by the native virus, in agreement with the observation that Mprotein also contains strong T-cell epitopes (An-t6n et al., 1995) .",

Alternatively, although bo~Lh N and M-proteins collaborate with the spike protein, the repertoire of antibody specificities elicited by S-rosettes in collaboration with N-protein may be different from the one elicited by S-rosettes and M-protein, and lower antibody-levels specific for viral epitopes relevant in virus neutralization could have been induced in collaboration with M-protein.",
