Therefore, vaccination of susceptible poultry during an HPAIV outbreak might be the best remedy to prevent such transmissions. To this end, suitable formulations and an effective mass vaccination method that can be translated to field settings needs to be developed. Our previous study in chickens has shown that inhalation of a non-adjuvanted dry powder influenza vaccine formulation during normal breathing results in partial protection against lethal influenza challenge. The aim of the present study was to improve the effectiveness of pulmonary vaccination by increasing the vaccine dose deposited in the lungs and by the use of suitable adjuvants. Two adjuvants, namely, Bacterium-like Particles (BLP) and Advax, were spray freeze dried with influenza vaccine into dry powder formulations. Delivery of dry formulations directly at the syrinx revealed that BLP and Advax had the potential to boost either systemic or mucosal immune responses or both. Upon passive inhalation of dry influenza vaccine formulations in an optimized set-up, BLP and Advax/BLP adjuvanted formulations induced significantly higher systemic immune responses than the nonadjuvanted formulation. Remarkably, all vaccinated animals not only survived a lethal influenza challenge, but also did not show any shedding of challenge virus except for two out of six animals in the Advax group. Overall, our results indicate that passive inhalation is feasible, effective and suitable for mass vaccination of chickens if it can be adapted to field settings.",

            "text": "To combat outbreaks of avian influenza virus, it could be useful to rapidly vaccinate the poultry in areas surrounding the outbreak, in a ring fencing strategy. However, this would require that very large numbers of poultry, potentially in the tens or hundreds of millions, should be able to be immunized within a very short time period. This would require a vaccine formulation and route of immunization that are suitable for such mass application. Liquid or powder influenza vaccine formulations that can be aerosolized and administered via the respiratory tract could be appropriate formulations for mass vaccination. Liquid formulations of inactivated influenza virus have been shown to be inadequate for aerosol vaccination by single administration [6] . Powder formulations, on the other hand, have shown an advantage over liquid formulations because of their long-term storage stability [7] [8] [9] . This long term stability facilitates stockpiling and thus provides ease of administration during mass vaccination [10] . In a previous study, we have shown that pulmonary immunization by dispersion of a dry powder influenza vaccine directly at the syrinx of chickens (active administration) was able to completely protect these animals against lethal viral challenge [11] . However, in realistic situations, due to extreme time pressures, active administration of chickens is unsuitable for mass vaccination. A more realistic approach would be to let chickens inhale aerosolized dry powder influenza vaccine formulation during breathing (passive administration). Indeed, passive inhalation of dry powder influenza vaccine formulation was feasible in chickens, but the animals were only partially protected indicated by a delay in time to death and reduced virus shedding [11] . Hence, the efficiency of influenza immunization by passive inhalation must be improved for pulmonary vaccination to become feasible. Possible approaches could be to increase the concentration of aerosolized vaccine, to expose the animals to aerosolized powder for longer periods of time and to include an adjuvant in the vaccine formulation. An effective adjuvant should not only be cheap, readily available and potent, but also safe. An adjuvant that has been generally recognized as safe is BLP. BLP are produced by hot acid treatment (pH 1 for 30 min at 99\u00b0C) of Lactococcus lactis, a non-pathogenic, food-grade Gram-positive bacterium [12, 13] . BLP act as Toll-like receptor-2 ligand and have shown potent immune boosting properties when administered together with vaccines against influenza, Yersinia pestis, malaria, and pneumococcal disease [14] [15] [16] [17] . Besides Toll-like receptor ligands, naturally derived polysaccharides, for example Advax\u2122 adjuvant comprising an insoluble isoform of inulin, boosts vaccine responses through mechanism that are still not fully characterized [18] . In (pre) clinical studies Advax has been shown to enhance immune responses induced by a wide variety of vaccines including vaccines against Hepatitis B, SARS coronavirus, listeria and influenza [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Upon parenteral administration, Advax has been shown to have a good safety and tolerability record both in animal studies and clinical trials [25] [26] [27] .",

For active administration, the dose of BLP and Advax in 1 mg of SFD powder was 150 \u00b5g and 500 \u00b5g respectively. WIV was mixed with BLP in weight ratios of HA:BLP of 1:30, 1:150 and 1:750. For WIV-Advax, the weight ratios of HA:Advax were 1:100, 1:500 and 1:2500. Likewise, for passive administration, 5 \u00b5g HA of NIBRG-23 was SFD either as such or mixed with 300 \u00b5g of BLP or 500 \u00b5g of Advax (this dose corresponds to the amount of HA and adjuvants in 1 mg of SFD powder). Both non-adjuvanted and adjuvanted formulations were SFD using inulin (4 kDa, Sensus, Roosendaal, The Netherlands) as the stabilizer. Inulin used for stabilization of influenza vaccine is amorphous and water soluble with potentially no adjuvant effect whereas Advax (delta inulin) is crystalline and insoluble in water with potent adjuvant activity. In brief, a 5% (w/v) solution of WIV and inulin with or without adjuvants was pumped at a flowrate of 5 ml/min through a two-fluid nozzle of a B\u00fcchi 190Mini SprayDryer (B\u00fcchi, Flawil, Switzerland). An atomizing airflow of 600 L/h was used to spray vaccine preparations in a vessel of liquid nitrogen. Then, the frozen vaccine preparations were placed in a Christ Epsilon 2-4 freeze dryer precooled to a shelf temperature of \u221235\u00b0C and at a pressure of 0.220 mbar. The shelf temperature was slowly increased from \u221235\u00b0C to 4\u00b0C within the time period of 32 h.

Upon active administration of chickens, the adjuvants BLP and Advax were shown to augment systemic and mucosal immune responses. Remarkably, in an optimized setup, passive administration of chickens either with non-adjuvanted or BLP or Advax adjuvanted WIV formulations induced robust immune responses that were sufficiently high to protect chickens against lethal viral challenge. Furthermore, BLP and Advax/BLP adjuvantation significantly raised the level of antigen-specific serum antibodies. In real life situations, where passive inhalation would be performed in large rooms, a portion of the aerosolized vaccine formulation would also end up in food and water. However, previous studies have shown that HA of the influenza vaccine undergoes conformational changes at acidic pH and is thus susceptible to proteolytic cleavage in the acidic environment [41, 42] . Consequently, little-no neutralizing antibodies are induced by acidic pH treated influenza vaccine [41, 42] . Therefore, it is speculated that the acidic environment in the stomach of chickens would not really add up to the lung induced mucosal immunity.",

However, the inclusion of BLP or Advax together with WIV in a formulation led to the formation of dry powder particles of comparable physical and biological characteristics as those of non-adjuvanted WIV formulation. Moreover, the physical properties of adjuvants i.e. their size and shape were found to be unaltered after SFD. Also, the biological activity of BLP was found to be well preserved during SFD. Previous studies have shown that administration of BLP or Advax adjuvanted influenza vaccine formulations via the respiratory tract results in substantial augmentation of systemic and mucosal immune responses in mice [16, [43] [44] [45] [46] . In this study we showed that after active administration, systemic immune responses (serum IgY titers) after one immunization were predominantly enhanced by Advax whereas after two immunizations they (serum IgY, HI titers, micro-neutralization titers) were mainly enhanced by BLP. After two immunizations, both non-adjuvanted and adjuvanted WIV formulations, at an HA dose of 5 \u00b5g, induced average HI titers above 3 log 2 which was previously found to be required for protection against lethal dose of influenza virus [11] . With respect to mucosal immune responses, lung IgY titers were mainly enhanced by BLP whereas lung IgA titers were augmented by both BLP and Advax. Though both BLP and Advax were found to enhance either systemic or mucosal immune responses or both, the observed discrepancies might be due to the dose of BLP (150 \u00b5g) and Advax (500 \u00b5g) used in this study. Although doses of 150 \u00b5g of BLP and 500 \u00b5g of Advax were found to be sufficiently high to boost both systemic and mucosal immune responses in mice, however, these doses might be too low for chickens with a 10x higher body weight. This might have resulted in the adjuvant dose to be a limiting factor in the active administration study. The active administration study revealed a slight but significantly higher effect of both BLP and Advax adjuvants, in comparison to nonadjuvanted WIV formulations. Hence, for the passive administration study, the relative dose of BLP was increased to double, i.e 300 \u00b5g/mg of SFD powder while keeping the dose of Advax similar. Since Advax particles consisted of 50 wt% of the SFD powder formulation, enhancing the dose of Advax further would most likely have compromised the integrity of the powder particles. Moreover, a pattern of Advax being effective after one and BLP after two immunizations could also be determined in the active administration study. Therefore, one of the groups of passively administered animals inhaled Advax-adjuvanted WIV for the first immunization and BLP-adjuvanted WIV for the second immunization.",

Hence, for this study, we aimed for complete protection against lethal influenza viral challenge. This was achieved by enhancing vaccine powder delivery to the lungs: by increasing the vaccine concentration (by reducing the size of inhalation box), by increasing the exposure time, and by the use of adjuvants. Compared to our previous study, optimization of the vaccine concentration and exposure time resulted in an increment of \u223c7 fold in the theoretical vaccine dose (this study 2 \u00d7 50 \u00b5g HA/animal; previous study 3 \u00d7 5 \u00b5g HA/animal) [11] . Using this optimized set-up, passive inhalation of both non-adjuvanted and adjuvanted WIV formulations not only protected chickens against clinical signs after HPAIV challenge, but also almost completely prevented challenge virus shedding. These results are a significant improvement over our previous study in which chickens showed partial protection and challenge virus shedding even after three immunizations. Though the immunological mechanism that governed complete protection in chickens by passive administration of non-adjuvanted and adjuvanted WIV formulations still needs to be investigated, the shedding data indicate that mucosal immune responses were high enough to prevent production of substantial amounts of virus. In addition to mucosal immune responses, an important class of immune responses are those elicited systemically. At both time points, BLP and Advax/BLP adjuvanted WIV formulations, were found to induce higher systemic immune responses than non-adjuvanted or Advax-adjuvanted WIV preparation. In addition, we found out that, either of the two adjuvants i.e. Advax or BLP would be appropriate for first immunization, however, for second immunization, BLP was vital. Although these adjuvanted WIV formulations elicited significantly higher immune responses than non-adjuvanted WIV formulation, the fact that even the non-adjuvanted WIV formulations provided complete protection, suggests that the use of an adjuvant was not critical for protection via passive inhalation, but it might add to dose-sparing of influenza vaccines for future passive inhalation studies.",
