This study aimed to examine climatic, socioeconomic and geographic risk factors for CPV infection and CPV-associated euthanasia in Australia. Australian veterinary hospital responses (534; 23.5 %) to a national veterinary survey of CPV case occurrences and euthanasias in 2016 were used. Severe caseloads (> 40 cases per annum) were reported by 26 (11 %) hospitals (median 60 cases; IQR 50-110). Case reporting, case numbers, and without-treatment euthanasia were significantly associated with disadvantage across all Socio-Economic Index for Areas quintiles (p < 0.0001) -the greater the disadvantage, the more reports. Strong negative correlations were found between case numbers and the Index of Relative Socioeconomic Disadvantage (r SP = -0.3357, p < 0.0001) and also between euthanasia and the Index of Education and Occupation (r SP = -0.3762, p < 0.0001). Hospitals in more remote areas were also more likely to report cases and to euthanize without treatment (p < 0.0001). Of the climate variables, temperature of the hottest month was most strongly positively correlated with case numbers (r SP = 0.421, p < 0.0001), and lower annual rainfall was associated with more case-reporting hospitals (p < 0.0001). These results confirm that socioeconomic disadvantage is a significant risk-factor for CPV infection and outcome, and high temperature may also contribute to risk.",

            "text": "Canine parvovirus (CPV) is a small non-enveloped single-stranded DNA virus of the genus Carnivore Protoparvovirus that first emerged in the mid-to-late 1970s, with a global pandemic occurring shortly after (Hoelzer and Parrish, 2010) . Subsequent capsid mutations have led to a number of strains currently circulating globally, classified as CPV-2a, 2b and 2c (Mylonakis et al., 2016) . All current strains are able to infect a range of carnivores and felids (Shackelton et al., 2005) . Although infections can be subclinical, CPV can cause gastroenteritis, dehydration, immune suppression and death, and disease typically occurs in dogs under 6 months of age. Adults can also be affected (Allison et al., 2014; Altman et al., 2017; Ling et al., 2012; Mylonakis et al., 2016) . Euthanasia is the leading cause of death from CPV in Australia (Ling et al., 2012) with 20,000 CPV cases estimated annually and higher reporting in rural and remote areas and lower socioeconomic regions (Kelman et al., 2019) . The reasons for this distribution are not fully understood, however lack of vaccination or an incomplete vaccination course due to affordability issues in these areas is one suggested explanation (Brady et al., 2012; Kelman et al., 2019; Zourkas et al., 2015) . Breed, stress, co-infection with other pathogen(s), immunosuppression, and geographic region are reported predisposing factors for infection (Goddard and Leisewitz, 2010; Kalli et al., 2010; Mylonakis et al., 2016) . Breed-susceptibility may relate to hereditary immunodeficiency in some animals (Day, 1999) . Stress due to co-pathogen infection, weaning, and overcrowding can lead to suppressed immunity and higher risk of clinical infection (Brunner and Swango, 1985) . Weaning and intestinal co-pathogen infection can also predispose to infection due to dysbiosis with increased enterocyte turnover and higher mitotic rate, increasing susceptibility to CPV due to its predilection for rapidly dividing cells (Houston et al., 1996; O'Sullivan et al., 1984) . Season, rainfall and temperature have also been reported as risk factors for infection, although no definitive relationship between these factors and infection has been established. The canine breeding cycle, with more puppies born in spring and summer, might explain one aspect of seasonal disease occurrence. Horner, 1983; Houston et al., 1996; Kalli et al., 2010; Rika-Heke et al., 2015) . Epidemiological studies have been limited until recently by a lack of reliable and suitable data, and an absence of national representative data (Brady et al., 2012) . The aim of this study was to determine from national data the association between socioeconomic, geographic, and climatic risk factors and CPV infection, and CPV-associated euthanasia rates.",

Descriptive statistics were calculated for SEIFA quintiles, remoteness areas, and caseload severity categories, with respect to CPV case numbers and CPV-related euthanasia rates (without treatment or despite treatment). Descriptive statistics were also calculated for climate variable quintiles, with respect to climate value and also CPV case numbers. Chi-squared test for independence was performed for CPV case occurrence (yes vs no) for all categories. Kruskal-Wallis One-Way Analysis of Variance was calculated for CPV case numbers and euthanasia rates for each category, and Dunn's All-Pairwise Comparisons Test was performed on mean rank scores for all statistically significant results. Spearman Rank Correlation was used to determine the relationship between continuous measured data. Scatter plots were generated for euthanasia rate versus IEO score and CPV caseload versus IRSD score; Loess smooth fitted curves were created using an alpha of 0.75 and linear degree. Logistic regression was used to identify socioeconomic, remoteness and climate predictors of CPV case reporting by hospitals. Predictor variables were chosen from each predictor category as that variable most highly associated (Chi-squared statistic) with CPV case-reporting hospitals. As there was a strong association with all SEIFA variables, for this category the variable with the highest correlation (Spearman Rank correlation statistic) with CPV case numbers was chosen. The best-fitting model was identified using stepwise logistic regression and P-to-enter 0.05 and P-toremove 0.10. Maps displaying CPV case numbers in relation to remoteness area were generated using ArcGIS\u00ae version 10.2 (ESRI).",

Seroprevalence studies in these regions would help to clarify this. In areas in which hospitals reported > 15 cases per annum, insufficient population immunity is a likely contributor to caseloads. If improved vaccination programs could be introduced to these areas, case numbers could probably be reduced. Currently, there are no documented reports of the success of targeted vaccination programs in areas where CPV seroprevalence is recognized to be low, despite our understanding that CPV vaccines are highly effective in preventing disease. It may also be that dogs in remote areas are more likely to be free-roaming or have greater contact with other dogs (Mustiana et al., 2015) , resulting in faster disease transmission.",

Our multivariate analysis of national data demonstrated this was also a significant variable in our study, confirming this finding. An association between CPV case occurrence and socioeconomic status might be due to vaccine affordability (Brady et al., 2012; Zourkas et al., 2015) or reduced accessibility to veterinary facilities, (Brady et al., 2012; Freiwald et al., 2014) however scientific evidence to support this has been lacking. A perceived lack of affordability of vaccination has been recognized. A 2017 UK study reported that 25 % of owned dogs and 35 % of owned cats had not had a primary vaccination course, and that 20 % of UK dog and cat owners believed that vaccinations were 'too expensive'; a 2011 USA survey reported similar results (Burns, 2013 ; \"Pets at risk as vaccinations decline,\" 2017). These reports highlight a socioeconomic gap between the need for pet ownership and the ability of pet owners to afford or prioritize paying for pet healthcare. Reduced prophylactic pet healthcare due to financial constraints or other social factors could also increase risk for gastrointestinal co-pathogens such as hookworm, roundworm, tapeworm, giardia, Cryptosporidium parvum, canine enteric coronavirus, and canine distemper virus which have been identified as risk-factors for CPV disease (Carman and Povey, 1982; de Castro et al., 2007; Denholm et al., 2001; Duijvestijn et al., 2016; O'Sullivan et al., 1984; Pollock, 1982; Pratelli et al., 1999; Smith et al., 1980; Zicola et al., 2012) . For example, an Argentinian study found an increasing gradient of contamination of sidewalks by canine faeces and an increase in faecal parasites, as socioeconomic status decreased (Rubel and Wisnivesky, 2005) . Stress, immune suppression, and overcrowded unsanitary environments are also reported CPV predisposing factors and could be confounders of a socioeconomic link (Brunner and Swango, 1985; Goddard and Leisewitz, 2010; Hoskins, 1997) .",

Potential risk factors for CPV cases in rural regions could include reduced access to veterinary services and reduced vaccination rates, due to a shortage of rural veterinarians (Australian Veterinary Association, 2019), and longer travel distances leading to increased difficulty in maintaining consistent vaccination coverage. The relationship between geographical remoteness and vaccination rates has not been investigated.

While previous studies have examined seasonality of cases, relationships with ambient temperature have not been examined. Seasonality as a risk factor for CPV cases has been reported in New Zealand (Horner, 1983) , Canada (Houston et al., 1996) and Brazil (spring and summer); in Colorado, USA (Studdert et al., 1983 ) (summer and autumn); and in Australia (autumn and spring) (Ling et al., 2012) . A spring/summer predilection for cases might reflect breeding patterns -more puppies born during this period -and also movement of animals during vacation periods to shows and boarding kennels (Horner, 1983) . Our finding of a strong association between CPV cases and maximum temperature in the hottest month of the year suggests that animal factors and short-term transmission might play a more important role in disease spread than environmental viral contamination and persistence (Gordon and Angrick, 1986) . Our results also suggest that higher environmental temperature alone is inadequate to prevent environmental viral persistence and transmission. Virus may persist in shaded, humid environments long enough to continue propagating outbreaks observed (Gordon and Angrick, 1986; Pollock, 1982) . In-vitro and environmental studies on viral longevity suggest that moisture content is a potentially important factor for survival, as where dehydration was noticed, titer reduction and loss of infectivity was evident (Pollock, 1982) . A USA environmental study conducted between December 1982 and August 1983, examined CPV-infected feces buried in soil 25 cm deep at various locations of direct sunlight, complete shade and partial shade. CPV infectivity in all but 3 sites had dropped to non-infectious levels by 5 months and only one shaded site remained infectious at 7 months (Gordon and Angrick, 1986) . We also found an association between lowest minimum temperature of the coldest month, and higher case reporting. This might reflect survivability of the virus in colder environmental conditions. Epidemiological studies of seasonal patterns over several years in local, endemic regions have never been published and would be useful to provide insight into individual microclimates and specific local risk factors.",

CPV infection or infectious contact was also cited as the reason for euthanasia of 45 % of puppies in RSPCA animals shelters in Queensland in 2014 (Hemy et al., 2017) . To examine CPV risk factors for euthanasia in this study, we collected data on euthanasia rates without treatment, versus where treatment for disease had commenced and a decision for euthanasia was later made, since different factors would likely influence either decision. We hypothesized that clients with severe financial constraints would be more likely to elect euthanasia without attempting treatment (Kelman et al., 2019) . In the current study we identified a strong association between social disadvantage and without-treatment euthanasia rate, across all SEIFA indices. The decision to euthanize a dog diagnosed with CPV infection is also likely be influenced by the severity of clinical disease. Severe cases of CPV are considered painful (Mylonakis et al., 2016; Prittie, 2004; Sos, 1983) and prognosis can be poor (Prittie, 2004; Schoeman et al., 2013) . This can lead a veterinarian to recommend euthanasia on humane grounds, or for the pet owner to elect for this course, with or without such a recommendation.",

However, given that 80 % of infections may be subclinical, mild or transient (Parrish et al., 1982; Pollock, 1981; Prittie, 2004; Sos, 1983) , this also increases the risk of a misdiagnosis of CPV disease where etiology may involve pathogens other than CPV (Freisl et al., 2017; Kelman et al., 2019) .

Only cases seen by veterinarians were accepted so it is likely that actual numbers are higher, particularly for communities where veterinary attendance rates are low.
