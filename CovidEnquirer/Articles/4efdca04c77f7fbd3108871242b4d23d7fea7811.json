Specimen collection for this study extended from March to August 1987, to allow sampling during both dry and wet seasons. Farms were visited at 1-2-week intervals on average, and ill calves, 3 months of age or younger, were identified by a veterinarian (DH, EP ) according to a written protocol. Diarrhea was defined as feces more liquid in consistency than expected; respiratory disease was defined as persistent cough and/or dyspnea and/or abnormal or excessive nasal secretions. Feces were collected from the rectum from all case and control calves when possible. Three rectal swabs were collected from calves with diarrhea, one of which was placed ira-mediately into thioglycollate broth. From respiratory cases, a swab was taken from each nostril. Acute and convalescent (2-4 weeks ) serum specimens were taken from respiratory-case calves. Specimens were kept on ice until arrival at the laboratory the same afternoon.",

Five of 27 (18.5%) calves Acres ( 1985 ) summarized the results of seven prevalence studies in the U.S.A. and Canada for enterotoxigenic E. coli in diarrheic calves; prevalence ranged from 6 to 31% (mean 18.3%, median 18%). Prevalence reports from other countries include: France, 0% (De Rycke et al., 1986 ) ; Britain, 3% of calves with diarrhea (Reynolds et al., 1986) ; U.S.A. (Idaho and Oregon), 6.6% (Bulgin et al., 1982) ; Britain, 7.9% in diarrheic calves and 0% in healthy controls (Snodgrass et al., 1986) ; Netherlands, 11% (Moerman et al., 1982) ; and U.S.A. Table  1 ). This differs from other reports, where isolation rates were higher from diarrhea calves than from controls (Sihvonen and Miettinen, 1985; Snodgrass et al., 1986) . Three of 32 (9.4%) calves from which K-99 antigen was detected were negative for immunoglobulins by the zinc sulfate test, and 20 of 215 (9.3%) calves from which K-99 was not identified were negative to the zinc sulfate test (X 2 0.11, P=0.75). K99+ E. coli identification by age of calf is shown in Table 3 . During the dry season (March and April), K99+ E. coli antigen was detected in 15 of 100 (15%) fecal swabs, and during the rainy season (May-August) it was detected in 20 of 168 fecal swabs (11.3%) (Z 2 0.29, P= 0.59).

Others have reported rates approximately one-half as large (Reynolds et al., 1986 ) . However, the purpose of this study was not to assign causes to cases of diarrhea but rather to determine agent prevalence. In addition, the diarrhea rate in calves in the prospective study of which this study was a part was 36% for 1152 calves (D. Hird et al., unpublished data) , higher than that reported elsewhere (Waltner-Toews , 1986b) ; this may indicate that many cases of diarrhea are not associated with infectious disease agents. Using data recorded for the continuing study, it was ascertained that for 96 of this study's control calves for which complete data were available, 22 had episodes of diarrhea recorded before selection as controls, 19 developed diarrhea after having been selected as controls, and 53 never developed diarrhea. For the 74 calves with no recorded diarrhea before selection as controls, the following percentages of control calves, grouped by agent first isolated, subsequently developed diarrhea: rotavirus, 4 of 6 (67%); K99 + E. coli, 5 of 12 (41.7%); coccidia, 2 of 17 ( 11.8%); and no agent isolated, 10 of 39 (25.6%). Comparison of agents isolated between control calves which subsequently developed diarrhea and their respective cases revealed that in only two instances was the same agent (rotavirus, K99+ E. coli) isolated from a casecontrol pair, indicating that the observed prevalence of disease agents in feces of control calves was not exaggerated by the proximity of diarrhea cases.",

Two of 29 (6.9%) acute sera were totally inhibitory against BHV 1 at a dilution of I : 10, probably indicating passive transfer of natural maternal immunity to the calf. None of 16 acute-convalescent sera pairs showed seroconversion at > 1 : 10 dilution. Cattle on the study farms were not vaccinated against viral diseases. Isolation of BHV 1 has been reported in Costa Rica (Rodriguez and Fernandez, 1987) , and a 16% seroprevalence in Costa Rican dairy cattle has been demonstrated (Donato, 1984 ) . In a study of Oregon and Idaho calves, a rate of 2.4% was reported (Bulgin et al., 1982) , and in Washington, an isolation rate of 10% in calves with signs of upper respiratory disease was reported (Evermann, 1979) . Antibodies to parainfluenza-3 virus were demonstrated in 23 of 28 (82.1%) acute sera and 1 of 16 (6.3%) acute-convalescent pairs showed seroconversion. In a Washington study, this virus was implicated in 10% of upper respiratory disease cases in calves, and in 8% of pneumonia cases (Evermann, 1979) . No cytopathic effect was observed in nasal swab suspension tested on BT cells; BT cells are susceptible to viruses of bovine virus diarrhea, IBR, PI-3, as well as bovine adenoviruses and enteroviruses (McClurkin et al., 1974 ) . In summary, our laboratory results did not indicate association of respiratory illness with presence of viral agents or antibodies against the viral agents tested. However, this conclusion was based on the relatively few specimens tested.",
