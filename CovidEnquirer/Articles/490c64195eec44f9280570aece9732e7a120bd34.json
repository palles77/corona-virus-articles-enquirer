Typical real-time TC delivery traces measured using Cy3-R and Cy5-L11 (A) or Cy3-F and Cy5-L11 (B), for ribosomes programmed with mPL in the absence of EF-G\u00b7GTP. Cy3 fluorescence (Green) and sensitized emission of Cy5 (FRET, Blue) were collected under 532 nm excitation. Preformed POST E (1) or POST R (4) with Cy5-L11 were immobilized in flow chambers in A and B, respectively. Camera recording was started 5 seconds prior to injection of Cy3 labeled tRNA TC and continued for 1 minute at 33 ms integration time per frame. Dwell time distributions of POST E complexes (C, 1) and POST R complexes (D, 4) were measured from the injection until the appearance of steady Cy3 and FRET intensities. (E and F).

Error bars are S.E.M.s, n \u2265 104. Supplementary Figure 2 FRET transition density map constructed from L1-tRNA FRET measurements with mRNA mPL. The map is a two-dimensional density plot of transitions identified by a Hidden Markov Modeling algorithm (HaMMy), indicating FRET efficiencies before vs. after each transition. This plot demonstrates that FRET transitions are unidirectional, as from 0.07 to 0.66, from 0.66 to 0.40, and from 0.40 to 0.78, which were assigned to complexes 2 \u2192 3, 3 \u2192 4-5, and 4-5 \u2192 6 as explained in the main text. Supplementary Figure 3 L1-tRNA FRET probability density plots as a function of time for L1-tRNA FRET traces recorded from mRNA mPL with 50 nM Phe TC (A), mPL with 5 nM Phe TC (B), and mPK with 50 nM Phe TC (C). All traces are aligned to the beginning of the last FRET state (mean 0.78) as t = 0. Decreasing concentration of Phe TC (A vs. B) mainly increases the dwell time of the 0.40 and 0.66 FRET states; whereas the pseudoknot mRNA (C) structure mainly increases the dwell time of the 0.78 FRET state.",

All concentrations are after mixing. Insets show initial time period, 0 -300 ms. The underlined unitalized sequence is the translation starting site, initiator fMet. The bold sequence codes Arg-Phe-Val upstream of the mRNA secondary structure and is used to monitor translation rates of the ribosome. The italized sequence is the mRNA secondary structure. The underlined italized sequence indicates the mutation(s) to alter stability and/or mRNA secondary structure. b Free energy of stem-loop secondary structure is predicted using a RNA mfold web server (version 2.3) 2 at 23 \u00baC, 1M NaCl and no divalent ions. c Free energies of mPK and mPK-SL were measured by optical tweezers at 20-22 \u00baC, 5 mM MgCl 2 3 . 100% G-C pairs slowed elongation rate 2.5 -3 fold, which is close to our finding that mSL-15 slows translocation and E-site dissociation rates 2 -3 fold.

Assuming that A-site tRNA binding rate increases linearly with TC concentration, it would increase to ~3 s -1 and tRNA binding would not be rate-limiting at the 200 nM TC concentration used in earlier single molecule fluorescence experiments 4 . Combining this extrapolated rate with the translocation rates (0.31-0.48 s -1 ) and E-site dissociation rates (0.38-0.63 s -1 ) we measured, the overall elongation rate is estimated to be 0.TC]. This value is quite consistent with elongation rates of ~0.2 s -1 at 200 nM [TC] and 0.4-0.5 s -1 at 700 nM [TC], which were measured by in vitro single molecule fluorescence 4 and optical trap assays 5 , respectively.
