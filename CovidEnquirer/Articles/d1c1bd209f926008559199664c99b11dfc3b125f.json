Eslamy, MD, Beverley Newman, MD* Pneumonia is an infection of the lower respiratory tract, involving the lung parenchyma. The World Health Organization estimates that there are 150.7 million cases of pulmonary infection each year in children younger than 5 years, with as many as 20 million cases severe enough to require hospital admission. 1 In North America and Europe, the annual incidence of pneumonia in children younger than 5 years is estimated to be 34 to 40 cases per 1000, and decreases to 7 cases per 1000 in adolescents 12 to 15 years of age. 2, 3 The mortality in pediatric patients caused by pneumonia in developed countries is currently low (<1 per 1000 per year). 3 However, pneumonia is still the number one cause of childhood mortality in developing countries. 1, 4 The overarching goal of this article is to review cause, current role of imaging, imaging techniques, and the spectrum of acute and chronic pneumonias in children. Pneumonia in the neonate and immunocompromised host is also discussed.",

Etiologic diagnoses of pneumonia are not so easy to determine or so accurate as is sometimes implied. In addition, proof of the cause of pneumonia is not obtained in most cases. There is a great deal of overlap in the radiographic appearance of pneumonias caused by different organisms. Imaging is usually poor at predicting the broad category (eg, bacterial vs viral) of infectious agent, let alone the specific agent. Preexisting lung disease may not only predispose to pulmonary infection but also modify the appearance of pulmonary consolidation. Furthermore, because the lungs can respond to a diverse disease processes in only a limited number of ways, it is common for the radiographic features of both acute and chronic infectious pneumonia to overlap considerably with many noninfectious lung diseases. Such noninfectious lung diseases are identified as pneumonia mimics in this article.",

Bacterial infections become relatively more common in older children from 2 years to 18 years of age. 5 The lung response to an infective antigen seems to be more agespecific than antigen-dependent (ie, bacteria vs viral).

            "text": "Frontal and lateral chest radiographs are the mainstay, and often the only, imaging needed in pediatric pulmonary infection. This imaging can be supplemented with other views such as lateral decubitus or other imaging modalities as the circumstances warrant. Decubitus views are not useful when an entire hemithorax is opacified because layering fluid cannot be identified without any adjacent air. The main use of US is to identify, quantify, and characterize a parapneumonic effusion/empyema, as well as provide image guidance for drainage and identify residual collections after treatment. 8, 9 Operator availability and expertise are important factors in making US a useful tool for evaluating pulmonary infection. Although intrapulmonary fluid-filled cavities and even lung abscesses within consolidated lung can be identified on US, CT provides a more global view of the disease process. CT is often used to further evaluate: (1) suppurative lung complications and to differentiate these from parapneumonic effusion/empyema; (2) patients with recurrent or chronic pneumonia and concern for an underlying lesion; and (3) immunocompromised children with noncontributory or confusing chest radiographs and clinical findings that could be secondary to lung infection. 5 Close attention to CT technique is crucial for imaging evaluation of pneumonia in pediatric patients. CT with low radiation dose technique should be carefully performed in all cases. Eighty to 120 kVp with weight-based low milliampereseconds coupled with radiation dose modulation techniques is appropriate in most children for evaluation of pneumonia. Multiple CT image acquisitions are usually not needed and the scan field of view should be tailored to the area of interest (especially if following a specific lesion serially over time) to further decrease the overall radiation dose. 10 Occasionally, it may be useful to acquire additional expiratory scans to assess air trapping, which is an early imaging finding associated with small airway disease. In this situation, often at least 1 or both CT acquisitions can be obtained using a high-resolution CT (HRCT) gap technique. To obtain optimal CT imaging at peak inspiration and close to expiratory residual volume, controlled ventilation (CViCT) in infants and young children ( 5 years old) or spirometer-controlled CT in older children may be needed. 11 Young children have little intrinsic tissue contrast. Therefore, intravenous contrast is almost always needed for CT imaging of infection especially if mediastinal delineation is required. The exception is when HRCT is used only for evaluating lung parenchymal and airway disease. Breath-holding is usually desirable but can be adapted on a case-by-case basis depending on the needs of the study and the ability of the child to cooperate. However, for the study to be interpretable, gross patient motion should be absent. Sedation or anesthesia may be required in infants, young children, or children with intellectual disability. Delays between induction of anesthesia and scanning need to be minimized to prevent the potential for lung atelectasis with anesthesia. The anesthesiologist needs to pay close attention to techniques for preventing atelectasis or recruiting lung before the CT imaging. 12 Peltola and colleagues 13 recently published their experience with MR imaging of lung infections in children using free-breathing T2-weighted, short tau inversion recovery, and T1-weighted with fat saturation precontrast and postcontrast sequences. Their study showed that lung parenchymal, pleural, and lymph node inflammatory abnormalities can be characterized by MR imaging in children with lung infection. Therefore, MR imaging might potentially be used to further evaluate suspected, acute complications of pneumonia. 13 Children with chronic lung conditions and recurrent infection, such as cystic fibrosis, who are often subjected to substantial radiation exposure from repeated CT studies, would benefit the most from MR imaging evaluation of the lungs instead of CT. Although MR imaging may not provide as much detail compared with CT especially with early, small or subtle changes ( Fig. 1) , there are promising indications of a role for MR imaging in pulmonary infection.

Pleuritic chest pain in lower-lobe pneumonia is sometimes referred to the abdomen and may be mistaken clinically for an acute abdominal condition. Acute focal pneumonia is most often caused by bacterial infection with streptococcus pneumonia. Other causes of acute focal pneumonia are summarized in Box 1. The chest radiograph of acute focal pneumonia usually shows a dense, typically more peripheral airspace opacity, which may appear segmental, lobar, or spherical ( Figs. 3 and 4) . [21] [22] [23] In a febrile child with a spherical density on a chest radiograph, the most likely diagnosis is a round pneumonia but the possibility of an underlying neoplasm may be considered. Round pneumonias tend to be solitary, have well-defined borders, and are often located in the perihilar region or posteriorly in the lungs. The radiograph should be carefully scrutinized for features of consolidation such as air bronchograms as opposed to those of a mass such as vascular/airway displacement or bony erosion. A second view such as a lateral radiograph may be helpful because a round pneumonia is often less masslike in appearance on an orthogonal view. This is one of the few scenarios in which radiologic follow-up after about 2 weeks may be useful to document interval resolution of acute pneumonia. 22 Acute respiratory distress may be secondary to an intrathoracic mass causing airway or lung compression, especially when there is complete opacification of a hemithorax on radiographs (Fig. 5) . Intrapulmonary masses including both benign and malignant entities may present clinically with acute superinfection. In addition, other conditions or anatomic variants may be mistaken for pneumonia when a chest radiograph is obtained in a child with a fever and respiratory symptoms.",

Most children exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis do not develop active disease but can have latent foci that may reactivate at a later date particularly if they become immunosuppressed or debilitated. Primary infection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is more likely in infants with local spread from the initial parenchymal/lymph node complex to form larger single or multifocal parenchymal lesions, typically with prominent hilar and mediastinal lymph node involvement ( Fig. 7) and occasional pleural or pericardial disease. The primary focus as well as involved nodes may cavitate with liquefaction of the caseous material and ultimately calcification (see Fig. 7 ). Enlarged lymph nodes may encroach on adjacent bronchi and cause bronchial narrowing with resultant air trapping or collapse in the distal lung (Fig. 8) . Distant spread to other organs may occur either via lymphatics or hematogenously (including military lung involvement). 24, 25 Infections with more than 1 organism may cause the atypical pneumonia pattern, resulting in confusing persistence of the illness or prominent findings in another organ system. An example of this situation is influenza infection with superimposed typical or atypical pneumonia (see Fig. 6B ).

            "text": "Acute lung aspiration (Mendelson syndrome) is an acute chemical injury caused by inhalation of gastric contents. In neurologically normal children, gastric aspiration usually occurs as a complication of anesthesia. The diagnosis of acute aspiration is mainly clinical and usually involves witnessed inhalation of vomitus or tracheal suctioning of gastric contents. 28, 29 Chronic lung aspiration (CLA) is repeated passage of food, gastric reflux, or saliva into the subglottic airways that causes chronic or recurrent respiratory symptoms. CLA may present with chronic cough, wheeze, noisy breathing, choking during feeding, recurrent episodes of pneumonia or bronchitis, and failure to thrive. Chronic aspiration often results in progressive lung disease, recurrent pneumonia, chronic airway inflammation, bronchiectasis, and respiratory failure. It is a major cause of death in children with severe neurologic disorders (Fig. 13) . Pulmonary aspiration may occur as a result of swallowing dysfunction, gastroesophageal reflux, and inability to adequately protect the airway from oral secretions or a combination of these. Anatomic conditions that predispose to aspiration lung disease include esophageal stricture or obstruction (eg, vascular ring, foreign body, achalasia), cleft palate, tracheoesophageal fistula (Fig. 14) , laryngeal cleft, and bronchobiliary fistula. 28, 29 Aspiration related to near-drowning occurs when fluid enters the lungs without being prevented by laryngospasm. It typically manifests as pulmonary edema radiographically. 30 In a recent series of 83 children, secondary infections from aspiration related to near-drowning were rare. 31 Hydrocarbon pneumonia is an acute, intense chemical pneumonitis after unintentional aspiration of volatile hydrocarbon compounds. Most cases of hydrocarbon pneumonia occur in children. Chest radiographs typically show bilateral, scattered pulmonary densities with middle and lower zone predominance. Such densities may become confluent and progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and respiratory failure. They typically worsen over the first 72 hours and then clear over the next few days. However, occasionally radiographic changes may take weeks to months to be cleared. Obstructive emphysema, pneumatoceles, subsegmental, or segmental atelectasis may also be seen. 32 Lipoid pneumonia is a rare form of pneumonia caused by inhalation or aspiration of a fatty substance. Oral administration of various oils is a common cultural practice, including mineral oil, olive oil, shark liver oil, cod liver oil, coconut oil, and ghee. Such oily materials can readily slide into the airway even in normal infants and young children without eliciting a cough reflex and are poorly removed by cilia. Lipoid pneumonias are typified by mild, subacute, or chronic clinical findings with accompanying marked radiographic changes. Chest radiographs of children with lipoid pneumonia typically show bilateral parahilar illdefined, airspace opacities. In a series of 7 pediatric patients, CT showed dense consolidation surrounded by ground-glass opacity with a geographic lobular distribution. 33 Within the dense consolidations, areas with relatively low attenuation were identified in only 1 patient. Therefore, low-density consolidation in the posterior lungs is an infrequent CT finding in the diagnosis of lipoid pneumonia in children (Fig. 15 ). Interlobular septal thickening in areas of ground-glass opacity (ie, crazy paving pattern) has also been described in children with lipoid pneumonia. 33 Lipoid pneumonias may be complicated by superimposed infection especially with atypical mycobacteria. Slow recovery usually takes place with cessation of the oil administration. There may be residual scarring/fibrosis especially with animal rather than vegetable oils. 34, 35 Foreign body aspiration can also result in pneumonia. Accidental aspiration of both organic and nonorganic foreign bodies is a cause of childhood morbidity and mortality, requiring prompt recognition and early treatment to minimize the potentially serious and sometimes fatal consequence. Eating is the most common circumstance during which it occurs, with small food items being the most common foreign bodies aspirated. Coughing, choking, acute dyspnea, and sudden onset of wheezing are the most common symptoms. Clinical signs of foreign body aspiration have low positive predictive values. Chest radiographs are the initial imaging modality for patients with clinically suspected tracheobronchial aspiration of a foreign body. Chest radiographs may show air trapping, atelectasis, a radiopaque foreign body (rare), or be normal (Fig. 16) . 36 When the routine inspiratory chest radiograph is unhelpful or confusing, inspiratory and expiratory radiographs (in a cooperative child) or bilateral decubitus views (in a younger child unable to follow breathing instruction) are useful in confirming focal or unilateral air trapping. In selected cases, CT (possibly integrated with virtual bronchoscopy) may be considered to exclude a foreign body. CT evaluation may avoid bronchoscopy or provide the exact location and postobstructive complications of the foreign body before bronchoscopy. 37 An underlying chronic unrecognized airway foreign body should be considered among other causes of recurrent or chronic pneumonia, particularly in the pediatric population (see Fig. 16 ).

In this situation, there are 4 major advantages of chest CT over chest radiographs. First, the presence, pattern, and extent of the disease process are better visualized. Second, more than 1 pattern of abnormality may be detected, suggesting dual pathologic entities. Third, invasive diagnostic procedures (eg, bronchoscopy or needle aspiration) can be more precisely planned. Fourth, CT also allows for increased sensitivity in assessment of the response to treatment. 54, 55 Although the radiographic or CT appearance might not be specific for a pathogen, knowledge of the clinical setting in combination with the type and severity of immunodeficiency and imaging pattern may narrow the differential diagnosis. A commonly encountered clinical issue is the possibility of fungal infection in immunocompromised children. The hallmark CT finding of fungal infections is the presence of pulmonary nodules. Such pulmonary nodules are often clustered peripherally and can show poorly defined margins, cavitation, or a surrounding halo of ground-glass opacity (CT halo sign) (Fig. 22) . The CT halo sign is a nonspecific finding and represents either hemorrhage around a nodule or neoplastic or inflammatory infiltration of the lung parenchyma. In the immunocompromised host, the CT halo sign can be seen most commonly with fungal infections (eg, aspergillosis, mucormycosis, or Candida) but also in viral infections (eg, CMV infection, herpes infection), organizing pneumonia, and pulmonary hemorrhage. 54, [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] Microorganisms associated with severe pneumonia in immunodeficiency states are summarized in Box 11.

Later, viruses, especially CMV and adenovirus, as well as Listeria, Nocardia, and Aspergillus, may be the cause. After more than 6 months after solid-organ transplantation, community-associated bacterial pneumonia becomes more common. 53 A variety of noninfectious pulmonary processes can present with acute or subacute clinical findings mimicking pulmonary infection. 54 These findings include alveolar hemorrhage, pulmonary edema, drug reaction, idiopathic interstitial pneumonia, benign and malignant lymphoproliferative disorders, constrictive bronchiolitis, bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia, and chronic graft-versus-host disease.

The name given to the suppurative process depends on several factors including the severity and distribution of the process, condition of the adjacent lung parenchyma, and temporal relationship with disease resolution. 65, 66 Cavitary necrosis Cavitary necrosis represents a dominant area of lung necrosis associated with a variable number of thin-walled cysts. Characteristic findings on CT for cavitary necrosis include loss of normal lung architecture, poor parenchymal enhancement, loss of the lung-pleural margin, and multiple thin-walled fluid-filled or air-filled cavities (Fig. 24) . Cavitary necrosis is seen earlier in chest US or CT compared with chest radiography because these cavities need to be filled with air to be visible on chest radiographs. Such cavities filled with air are accomplished only after communication with bronchial airways. Most pediatric patients can be managed successfully with conservative treatment. Follow-up chest radiographs typically show complete or near-complete resolution of the cavitary necrosis (see Fig. 24 ). 65, 66 Lung abscess Lung abscess is a severe complication of pneumonia in children, mostly occurring in the presence of predisposing factors, such as congenital or acquired lung abnormalities, or immunodeficiency. Lung abscess represents a dominant focus of suppuration surrounded by a well-formed fibrous wall. The predominant pathogens isolated from primary lung abscesses in children include streptococcal species, Staphylococcus aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae. Children with a lung abscess have a significantly better prognosis than adults with the same condition. 67 Lung abscesses are uncommon in immunocompetent children. On contrast-enhanced CT, a lung abscess appears as a fluid-filled or airfilled cavity with a thick definable, enhancing wall (Fig. 25) . 65, 66, 68 Although lung abscess in children has been managed successfully for many years with prolonged courses of intravenous antibiotics, the evolution of interventional radiology has seen the accelerated use of percutaneously placed pigtail drainage catheters using US and CT guidance. 67 Pneumatocele Pneumatocele is a term given to thin, smoothwalled air-filled cysts seen at imaging and may represent a later or less severe stage of resolving or healing lung necrosis (see Fig. 24 ). Pneumatoceles are most often caused by severe lung infection from staphylococcal pneumonia. However, they may be seen with other bacterial infections including streptococcus pneumonia and after hydrocarbon aspiration. On CT, thin-walled small or large cysts containing air with or without fluid are identified. The wall of a pneumatocele does not enhance. The surrounding lung may be opacified but does not typically show findings of lung necrosis. 65, 66 Pneumatoceles usually resolve spontaneously over time although pneumatoceles may be atypically persistent in children with hyper-IGE syndrome. Large pneumatoceles containing fluid can be a source of ongoing infection and may occasionally require drainage.",

Central BPFs (ie, main or lobar bronchi communicating with the pleural cavity) most often develop after traumatic injury to large airways or leak from the bronchial stump after pneumonectomy or lobectomy. The main causes for peripheral BPFs (ie, segmental or more distal airways or lung parenchyma communicating with the pleural cavity) are necrotizing pulmonary infection (ie, cavitary necrosis), trauma, lung surgery, and malignancy. 69, 70 Presence of air in the pleural space before aspiration or drainage attempts is suggestive of either a peripheral BPF or infection with a gas-producing organism. Multidetector CT with thin-section axial and multiplanar reformation images may show a fistulous tract between the pleural space and peripheral airway or lung parenchyma in peripherally located BPFs (Fig. 26) . 70 Pulmonary gangrene Pulmonary gangrene is a rare complication of severe lung infection with devitalization of lung parenchyma and secondary infection. 71 The primary feature that distinguishes pulmonary gangrene from necrotizing pneumonia and lung abscess is the extent of necrosis and the fact that thrombosis of large vessels plays a prominent role in the pathogenesis. Chest imaging shows lobar consolidation with bulging fissures and is followed by tissue breakdown to form many small cavities, which subsequently coalesce into a single large cavity occupying the entire lobe. Such a large cavity is filled with fluid and irregular pieces of sloughed lung parenchyma. However, these findings are not invariably present. Surgical resection of necrotic tissue is often necessary for proper management of children with pulmonary gangrene.

Parapneumonic effusion is defined as a pleural effusion in the setting of a known pneumonia. It may be simple or complicated based on the absence or presence of the infecting organism within the pleural space, respectively. 75 Empyema is defined as thick purulent pleural effusion. It may be free-flowing or loculated. Progression of a pleural effusion to empyema occurs through 3 stages: exudative, fibrinopurulent, and organization. Parapneumonic effusions complicate pneumonia in 36% to 56% of cases in pediatric patients. 76 Empyema complicates an estimated 0.6% of all childhood pneumonias. 77 Chest radiographs can often detect a parapneumonic collection, although some fluid, especially in a subpulmonic location, may not be visible and is often seen better on a decubitus film. In cases with complete or almost complete opacification of a hemithorax with or without contralateral mediastinal shift, additional erect or decubitus views are unhelpful in defining the quantity or nature of the pleural fluid. US is most helpful in this situation because it can readily distinguish a parapneumonic collection from extensive consolidation or an underlying mass. The US determination of the echogenicity of the pleural collection (anechoic or echogenic) and showing fibrin strands, septations, loculations, or fibrinous pleural rind is helpful in determining appropriate therapy (see Fig. 26 ). Treatment options for parapneumonic effusions/ empyemas include antibiotics alone, simple tube drainage, chest drain insertion with fibrinolytics, or surgery (eg, video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery or open thoracotomy with decortication). Although imaging techniques are used as a guideline, they do not always accurately stage empyema, predict outcome, or guide decisions regarding surgical versus medical management. 75 CT provides a more global overview of pleural and pulmonary abnormality from acute pneumonia, but is poor at differentiating parapneumonic effusion from empyema in pediatric patients. Findings on CT, in patients with parapneumonic effusion/ empyema, include: (1) enhancement and thickening of visceral and parietal pleura; (2) thickening and increased density of extrapleural subcostal tissues; and (3) increased attenuation of extrapleural subcostal fat. 78 Loculation can be inferred by the presence of a lenticular fluid collection or nondependent air. Septations are usually not appreciated on CT (see Fig. 26 ).",

The development of pleural fibrosis follows severe pleural inflammation, which is usually associated with an exudative pleural effusion. Fibrothorax and trapped lung are 2 uncommon consequences of pleural fibrosis (see Fig. 27 ). 83 Fibrothorax represents the most severe form of pleural fibrosis. With a fibrothorax, there is dense fibrosis of the visceral and parietal pleural surfaces, leading to fusion of these membranes, contracture of the involved hemithorax (and ipsilateral mediastinal shift), and reduced mobility of the lung and thoracic cage (see Fig. 27 ). Decortication is the only potentially effective treatment of fibrothorax in patients with severe respiratory compromise. 83, 84 A trapped lung is characterized by the inability of the lung to expand and fill the thoracic cavity because of a restrictive, fibrous, visceral pleural peel (see Fig. 27 ). Restriction of lung parenchymal expansion and subsequent negative pressure in the pleural space result in filling of the pleural space with pleural fluid (usually a transudate). The diagnosis of a trapped lung implies chronicity, stability over time, and a purely mechanical cause for the persistence of a fluid-filled pleural space. Patients with a trapped lung usually do not experience improvement in dyspnea after thoracentesis. In symptomatic patients, decortication should be considered. The underlying lung parenchyma should be assessed before decortication. If the trapped lung is severely diseased and fibrotic, decortication is unlikely to result in lung reexpansion and the procedure does not provide symptomatic benefit. In contrast, lung entrapment is the result of an active inflammatory process or malignancy in the pleural space, leading to a restricted pleural space. Pleural fluid from lung entrapment is an exudate, and symptoms in patients with lung entrapment typically improve after thoracentesis. 83, 85 Fibrosing Mediastinitis Fibrosing mediastinitis is a rare condition characterized by proliferation of fibrous tissue within the mediastinum. Symptoms are related to compression of the central airways, superior vena cava, pulmonary veins, pulmonary arteries, and esophagus. The most common cause of this disorder is fungal infection, especially Histoplasma capsulatum in the United States. 86 ",

Imaging evaluation plays an important role in children with pneumonia by detecting the presence of pneumonia and determining its location and extent, excluding other thoracic causes of respiratory symptoms, and showing complications such as effusion/empyema and suppurative lung changes. Clear understanding of the underlying potential cause, current role of imaging, proper imaging techniques, and characteristic imaging appearances of acute and chronic pneumonias can guide optimal management of pediatric patients with pneumonia.",
