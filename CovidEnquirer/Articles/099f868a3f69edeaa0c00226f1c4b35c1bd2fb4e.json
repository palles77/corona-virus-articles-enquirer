Respiratory viruses were detected in 34.1% (73/214) of patients, and co-infection occurred in 7.9% (17/214) of patients. The incidence of respiratory virus was higher in the fever/RS group than in the nonfever/RS group (44.9% (48/107) versus 23.4% (25/107), p 0.001). Influenza B virus, enterovirus/rhinovirus and coronaviruses were detected more frequently in the fever/RS group, whereas parainfluenza virus 4B and adenovirus were detected more frequently in the non-fever/RS group. Among the non-fever/RS group, chest discomfort was more common among patients tested positive for respiratory viruses than those without respiratory virus detected (44% (11/25) versus 22% (18/82), p 0.04). Conclusions: Respiratory viruses can be frequently detected among hospitalized patients without typical features of respiratory tract infection. These patients may be a source of nosocomial outbreaks.",

Accurate data on the burden of respiratory virus infection is critical for patient management, infection control measures and public health policies. Current clinical guidelines suggest that respiratory virus should be tested in patients with respiratory symptoms, or those with myocarditis or encephalitis [2] . As a result, epidemiological data on respiratory virus infection mostly rely on studies analysing patients with clinical evidence of respiratory tract infection [1,9,11e15 ]. However, non-respiratory symptoms and extrapulmonary complications are common among patients with respiratory virus infection [15e18] . Renal failure is particularly common among patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection [19, 20] . Myocardial infarction and stroke can be triggered by respiratory virus infection [12, 14, 21] . Hence, epidemiological studies excluding patients without symptoms or signs of respiratory tract infection may underestimate the true burden of respiratory virus infection.",

Many retrospective studies have demonstrated an association between respiratory virus infection and extrapulmonary complications [12, 14, 21] . However, because of the bias in testing patients with fever or respiratory symptoms, these reported results may not be accurate. Our results suggest that patients without respiratory symptoms should be enrolled in future studies on the role of respiratory viruses in extrapulmonary complications. Adenovirus and PIV-4B were more frequently detected in the non-fever/RS group than in the fever/RS group. Adenovirus and PIV are generally perceived to be less important than influenza virus or respiratory syncytial virus because of the low incidence. However, a retrospective study showed that adenovirus and PIV had the highest hospitalizationefatality rate among different respiratory viruses [9] . It is possible that these respiratory viruses are transient, colonizing the patients' upper respiratory tract but not actually causing the symptoms or disease. However, although asymptomatic infections due to adenovirus and PIV are often found in children [11, 27, 28] , adenovirus and PIV are rarely detected among healthy asymptomatic adults [11, 29] .",

The ratio in the detection rate of influenza B virus in the fever/RS group and non-fever/RS group was greatest among all viruses. Our results suggest that patients with influenza B virus infection are more likely to present with respiratory symptoms than those with other respiratory virus infections.",

Second, we enrolled patients within 24 hours of hospitalization. The role of respiratory viruses for nosocomial complications should be further explored. Third, this study was conducted over a 1-month period during the influenza B winter season, and therefore the respiratory viruses detected in this study are not representative for the entire year. A long-term study should be conducted to capture the peak seasons of other respiratory viruses. Fourth, some patients in the non-fever/ RS group may have prolonged viral shedding from a previous respiratory illness that occurred more than 7 days before admission. Finally, we studied acutely hospitalized patients, who would have more severe symptoms or complications when compared with patients seeking help in the community. Therefore, further studies should be performed at general practice in the community.",

Respiratory viruses are responsible for many nosocomial outbreaks.

Furthermore, the detection of respiratory viruses in these patients may affect antiviral treatment decisions, especially when novel antivirals against noninfluenza viruses become available [6, 30] .",
