Conclusions: TCM is still facing many challenges in playing critical roles in improving public health in China. These challenges can be explained from different perspectives. In addition to the unique characteristics of TCM, economic, cultural, and historical evolution in China may also be major determinants.",

The oldest classic of TCM is Huangdi Neijing (Inner Canon of Huangdi or the Yellow Emperor's Medicine Classic), which was written 2000-3000 years ago [1] . The basic theory of TCM includes five-zang organs and six-fu organs, qi (vital energy), blood, and meridians. TCM is based on the holistic principles and emphasizes harmony with the universe. It categorizes the causes of diseases into two groups: external causes and internal causes. It differentiates syndromes according to the eight principles (yin, yang, exterior, interior, cold, heat, deficiency (xu) and excess (shi)).",

The typical TCM diagnostic methods are inspection, auscultation/olfaction, inquiring and palpation. Chinese herbal medicine not only includes plants, but also includes medicinal uses of animals and minerals. The herbal medicine preparation (pao zhi) and formulas (fang ji) are also very critical and unique. TCM has been carried over for thousands of years for a variety of clinical treatments of different kinds of diseases and symptoms in China. It also has experienced further development and modernization over time [2, 3] . In the 1950s, Chairman Mao Zedong authorized an attempt to create an academic/formal/systematized medicine. One of the major changes in the medicine is it eliminated everything considered to be superstitious. One example of such a concept is \"Hun-Po\" 1 of which there was no mention in the texts of the 1960s and 1970s. In terms of acupuncture practice a certain standardization of the acupoints and needling techniques took place which was exported with the early teachers who came to the west and founded acupuncture schools on the TCM academic model. Herbal medicine and Zang Fu syndrome differentiation were also standardized. Thus, strictly speaking, the term TCM in the west should be referred as Chinese medicine rather than TCM.",

Although the Chinese government has implemented quality control systems on medical production, such as implementations of the Good Agricultural Practice (GAP), the Good Laboratory Practice (GLP), and the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) for many years, there is still need to improve the quality control in the production of herbal medicine. Due to the complexity of Chinese herbal medicine, the critical component combinations and the appropriate standard component combinations are not quite clear. For example, since there is neither strict standards for controlling critical components in the patent medicine nor regulations on the process for sliced herbal medicine, some manufacturers are either using less effective components or cheap substitutes [6] . 4 Sliced herbal medicine is the herbal medicine that has been processed. In addition to basic processes such as slicing, steaming, and drying, some raw herbal medicine is processed with ginger, honey, licorice, and sulfur. The major purpose of these processes is to reduce toxicity as well as to sanitize. 5 Patent medicine is the herbal medicine formula that has been standardized rather than been \"patented\". TCM products have been exported to about 163 countries in the world. Based on the report from the China Chamber of Commerce for Import & Export of Medicines & Health Products (CCCMHPIE), the TCM herbal medicine export is almost US$ 1.2 billion in 2007, which increased 8% from 2006. Depending on different definitions and calculation, Chinese herbal medicine represents 20-50% of the herbal medicine market share worldwide.",

Although both Chinese and Western experts realize that RCT may not be appropriate to evaluate TCM since it requires individualized treatment based on the diagnosis of each patient, there is not any innovative evaluation design available [20] . To fill the gap between TCM and evidence based medicine (EBM), efforts have been put on conducting systematic reviews and clinical studies in China [21] . For example, as part of the international Cochrane Collaboration, the Chinese EBM/Cochrane Center was established in China in 1999.

As discussed earlier, the challenges of TCM clinical effectiveness may explain in some part the use of western medicine in the TCM hospitals. Furthermore, due to the health reforms in the 1990s, most of the hospitals in China have to take care of themselves financially with less and less government investment [4] . In general, TCM practice is much cheaper and has a lower profit margin than western medicine. Many TCM hospitals depend on government subsidies for survival [23] .

As discussed earlier, since Chinese hospitals are expected to generate revenue to cover the majority of their expenses, they have incentives to use western medical devices and treatment due to the lower profit margin of TCM. The low profitability of TCM makes the TCM labor market less attractive. Students also have less incentive to carry on the genuine TCM practice and TCM professionals have more incentive to practice western medicine.",

As previously discussed, the integrated practices are found not only in those TCM/Western medicine hospitals, but in all other type of medical institutions and with different forms. In addition to integrated treatment, some patients use western medicine for diagnosis and use TCM for treatment. Some others use TCM for chronic conditions and use western medicine for acute conditions. Although some studies have shown that integrated practice has the potential to improve clinical results [31] , there are also concerns that the traditional TCM characteristics are more likely to be ignored in the integrated practice. A study showed that only 30,000 TCM doctors in China are still prescribing raw/sliced herbal medicine based on TCM theory and Chinese herbology [9] . The majority of TCM doctors only prescribe western medications.",

The Chinese government is also looking for ways to fit the traditional TCM care framework into the current health care system. For example, a trial study on permitting TCM doctors to treat and prescribe herbal medicine to patients in herbal medicine shops will be conducted in nine cities/counties in China from July 2007 to March 2008 [33] .",

For example, what is the impact of health insurance and other socio-economic factors? Do historical factors, such as the adverse campaign on TCM during the Cultural Revolution result in some cohort differences in the TCM utilization? For example, what is the funding impact from pharmaceutical companies and medical device companies on western medicine usage and TCM medicine? Do the pharmaceutical companies and herbal medicine manufacturers have different profitability, marketing strategies, social and political impact on health care policies and regulations, which directly or indirectly influence western medicine and TCM practices? Better understanding of the pattern of TCM utilization can help government reform the health delivery and financing infrastructure. It can also guide government to provide specific policies, such as promoting TCM in specific geographic locations, for subgroups who may receive more benefit from TCM treatment, and to efficiently allocate TCM resources.",
