The objective of this study was to assess the frequency, severity, and consequences of respiratory viral infection during pregnancy in women with and without asthma. Methods: In this prospective cohort study, common cold symptoms were assessed during pregnancy in 168 women with asthma and 117 women without asthma using the common cold questionnaire and by self-report. Nasal and throat swabs were collected for suspected infections and tested by polymerase chain reaction for respiratory viruses. Pregnancy and asthma outcomes were recorded. Results: Pregnant women with asthma had more prospective self-reported and questionnairedetected common colds than pregnant women without asthma (incidence rate ratio, 1.77; 95% CI, 1.30-2.42; P , .0001). Retrospectively reported common colds in early pregnancy and post partum were increased in women with asthma compared with women without asthma. The severity of cold symptoms was also increased in women with asthma (total cold score median, 8; interquartile range [5, 10] in women with asthma vs 6 [5, 8] in control subjects; P 5 .031). Among women with asthma, having a laboratory-confi rmed viral infection was associated with poorer maternal health, with 60% of infections associated with uncontrolled asthma and a higher likelihood of preeclampsia. Conclusions: Pregnant women with asthma have more common colds during pregnancy than pregnant women without asthma. Colds during pregnancy were associated with adverse maternal and pregnancy outcomes. Prevention of viral infection in pregnancy may improve the health of mothers with asthma.",

Two-sided tests with P , 05 were considered signifi cant, with the exception of data on the frequency of common colds and PCR-positive colds ( P , .025, because this outcome was assessed by two similar methods). The rate difference between the groups for colds was compared using a Poisson regression model adjusted for BMI, atopy, and parity, with a robust option when data were overdispersed. Secondary outcomes were cold severity (analyzed as panel data using Stata's xtreg with random effects and adjusted for baseline CCQ score, BMI, atopy, and parity), impact of colds on asthma, and impact of colds on pregnancy outcomes. We assessed the relationship between PCR-positive colds in asthma and preeclampsia/pregnancyinduced hypertension with logistic regression, adjusting for smoking, parity, age, BMI, and multiple pregnancy. Receiver operator curve (ROC) analyses were used to evaluate different diagnostic cutoff levels for the CCQ score in PCR positive infections (e- Fig 3) .

Among nonpregnant women with asthma, susceptibility to respiratory viral infection is not increased, but colds are more severe with more lower respiratory tract symptoms, which are longer lasting. 7 However, pregnant women may be more susceptible to viral infection because of a pregnancyrelated impairment in antiviral interferon responses 8, 9 or defi ciencies in epithelial cell function, overproduction of mucus, or alveolar macrophage dysfunction. 10 We hypothesized that during pregnancy, women with asthma experience more frequent and more severe respiratory viral infections than pregnant women without asthma.

            "text": "There are limitations to our study. The CCQ is an unvalidated tool, which limits the conclusions we can make using this instrument, particularly since the CCQ is not validated to distinguish between viral infections and rhinitis. There was the possibility of recall bias for colds assessed retrospectively, although for the majority of pregnancy we collected data prospectively. The pregnant women with asthma had higher parity than pregnant women without asthma, which might increase their exposure to virus infections from other children. 26, 27 However, we adjusted for this as well as other confounders, such as atopy and BMI (a known risk factor for exacerbations in pregnancy 28 ), when considering the rate of colds. Our sample collection time was not ideal, with swabs collected within a median of 3 to 4 days from symptom worsening. We contacted women fortnightly by phone and sent mobile phone text reminders every other week to try to increase participation and offered home visits during colds. The CCQ covers only 2 days of the past 14, and since we did not administer it daily, it is possible colds were missed. The number of PCRpositive colds experienced by women with asthma, when adjusted for follow-up time, was not significantly different from the control group. This may be due to a lack of power, since only a proportion of common colds were tested in the laboratory, or rhinitislike symptoms and cough may be amplifi ed by asthma or pregnancy themselves, resulting in more colds being detected that were not true infections. Although we found second trimester colds to be more frequent than third trimester colds, it is possible that rhinitis of pregnancy may have contributed to this fi nding.",
