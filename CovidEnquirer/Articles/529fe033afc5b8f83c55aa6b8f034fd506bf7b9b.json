However, the oral mucosa may show manifestations of local or systemic disease or derangement produced by therapeutic agents. Excessive contact by therapeutic agents such as aspirin, potassium supplements and corticosteroids have been reported to produce local ulceration in the mouth (Zentler-Monro and Northfield, 1979) . The increased use of mouthwashes over the last 20 years has resulted in a number of reported adverse effects to the buccal mucosa in people (Gargari and Kabani, 1995) . Systemic disorders produced by anticoagulants or chemotherapeutic drugs may also be evident by bleeding or ulceration in the oral cavity (Goepp, 1982) . Buccal ulceration is also described as part of a generalised hypersensitivity reaction to drugs (Zentler-Monro and Northfield, 1979) .",

Although inflammatory lesions are found sporadically in untreated laboratory rodents, dogs and primates, stomatitis can be induced by systemic administration of high doses of therapeutic agents. Anticancer and antimitotic agents are particularly liable to induce stomatitis. A notable example is bleomycin that is capable of producing stomatitis as part of its general effect on squamous cells (Thompson et al., 1972) . In humans, the adverse effects on therapeutic ionising radiation on the salivary glands may also give rise to inflammatory changes in the oral cavity (Fox, 1998) Diuretics and other agents, which are capable of producing severe electrolyte disturbances and uraemia at excessive doses, can also produce stomatitis when then are administered in high doses to laboratory animals (Garthoff et al., 1982) . These lesions may be analogous to the well-described association of ulcerative stomatitis and uraemia in man and laboratory animals (Boyd, 1978; Barker and van Dreumel, 1985) . The dog appears very sensitive to the ulcerogenic effects of uraemia in the oral cavity, although as there is a poor correlation between actual levels of blood urea and stomatitis, other biochemical factors are undoubtedly involved.",

Amyloid may become deposited in the muscular and connective tissue of the tongue in amyloid-prone species, particularly mice (Dunn, 1967) . Mice, especially DBA and DBA/2NCrj strains, are liable to develop calcification in the lingual muscle spontaneously, even at a young age (Imaoka et al., 1986) . Calcified lesions are seen in the longitudinal muscle under the dorsolateral epithelium and the central part of the tongue, which, when severe, are associated with inflammation, granulation tissue, polypoid change, hyperplasia of the overlying squamous epithelium and ulceration. The histogenesis of this lesion is uncertain. In the DBA/2NCrj mice, mineralisation of the tongue is associated with myocardial and aortic mineralisation (Doi et al., 1985) .",

This is surrounded by proliferating ondotoblasts which form predentin which when calcified becomes dentin. Surrounding ameloblasts when induced by the presence of dentin produce the overlying enamel layer. It is these active cellular layers, which can be modified or damaged by xenobiotics, vitamin deficiencies, calcium, phosphate or magnesium deficiency, parathyroidectomy, hypophysectomy, hyperparathyroidism, adrenal insufficiency and fluorosis (Kuijpers et al., 1996) .",

As increasing numbers of children survive malignant disease, damage to the mature dentition can occur as a result of cytotoxic therapy during childhood. Clinical study of the teeth of children treated for malignancy have shown increased incidence of enamel hypoplasia and missing teeth (Welbury et al., 1984) . Histological examination of teeth from children treated with vincristine or combination chemotherapy for malignant disease has demonstrated prominent incremental lines in dentine correlating with the number of times the intravenous cytotoxic agents were administered (MacLeod et al., 1987) . It has also been shown that vincristine, a drug which interferes with the assembly of microtubules and reduces secretory activity in a number of cells including osteoblasts and chondroblasts, also effects dentine formation in the rat incisor (Stene and Koppang, 1976) . Two weeks following a single intravenous dose of vincristine to young adult rats, a faint incremental line in the dentine was observed, probably a reflection of a direct effect of the drug on the dentinogenic tissue at the time of injection. At higher doses, focal niche-like or punched out defects in dentine were observed, expression of more severe injury to highly sensitive dentinogenic populations at the time of injection (Stene and Koppang, 1976 ). The precise mechanism of damage is not fully understood although decreased secretion of dentine matrix by odontoblasts has been demonstrated. Calcification appears unaltered (Stene and Koppang, 1980) . Administration of the alkylating anticancer agent cyclophosphamide or a sin-gle exposure to ionising radiation, produces localised niche-like or punched out defects in the rat incisor, rather than the more diffuse changes induced by vincristine. This presumably reflects more localised injury to a sensitive subpopulation of dentinogenic cells (Koppang, 1973; Vahlsing et al., 1997) . Anticonvulsant drugs also produce changes in the dentition of man and experimental animals. In humans, reported alterations include tooth root resorption, small teeth, delayed shedding of deciduous teeth and retarded eruption of permanent teeth, features similar to those found in hypoparathyroid or pseudohypoparathyroid conditions (Robinson et al., 1983) . Tooth root alterations were also reported in a study in which young male Wistar rats were treated with diphenylhyantoin for 1 month. Treated rats showed evidence of molar root resorption lacunae that penetrated the cementum and involved the dentine. The lacunae contained a dense infiltrate of cells contiguous with similar cells in the surrounding periodontal ligament. Robinson and Harvey (1989) showed that the changes were similar to those occurring in parathyroidectomized rats but not those in rats made hypocalcaemic with a calcium deficient diet. They suggested that the changes induced by diphenylhydantoin in rats were similar to those in pseudohypoparathyroidism in which resistance of tooth roots to resorption is reduced.",

These drugs may alter fibroblastic proliferative and synthetic activity, possibly by selection of a subpopulation of fibroblasts (Hassel et al., 1976) . It has also been suggested that an underlying mechanism in phenytoin-induced gingival hyperplasia involves the decrease in salivary IgA that develops in some patients (Beghi et al., 1986) .

The ameloblastoma comprises cords, nests, anastomosing strands or islands of ondontogenic epithelial cells within a fibrous stroma. The tumour cells resemble ameloblasts with the cords of spindle shaped cells similar to the stellate epithelium bounded by a peripheral layer of cuboidal or columnar cells resembling the inner enamel epithelium. Other tumours of the odontogenic epithelium show induction of the mesenchymal elements or develop a complete sequence of odontogenic epithelium, odontogenic mesenchyme and dental hard tissues including dentine, enamel and cementum. In the rat these have been classified as odontoma characterised by the presence of all dental hard tissues and odontogenic fibroma composed of undifferentiated or primitive mesenchymal cells of developing dental tissue (Mohr, 1997) .",

These mucins usually contain more than 50% carbohydrate in the form of neutral and acidic oligosaccharide chains, O-glycosidically linked to threonine or serine. Mucins possess several roles including mechanical flushing of the oral cavity, protection and lubrication of soft and hard tissues, modulation of oral microbial flora, buffering activity, regulation of calcium/phosphate equilibrium, digestion and extracellular post translation processing of molecules present in saliva . The heterogeneity of salivary glycoproteins suggests that they act as a defence against pathogenic microorganisms by competing with microbial binding sites of similar structure on the surface of cells lining the digestive tract (Schulte, 1987) . Minor salivary glands may also play an important part in the local immunosurveillance of the oral cavity for their ducts are anatomically closely associated with lymphoid tissue (Nair and Schroeder, 1986; Nair et al., 1987) .

Controversy remains about the precise nature of the secretory cells found in the various salivary glands of different species and this makes critical interspecies comparisons difficult (see detailed discussion of this problem by Pinkstaff, 1980 ). The duct system is less complex. This comprises an intercalated duct which leads from the secretory endpiece into a striated (secretory or intralobular) duct, so termed because their lining cells are striated by delicate eosinophilic cytoplasmic rods.

This segment is lined by cylindrical epithelium with basal nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasm containing secretory granules. This duct segment is termed the granular duct or granular convoluted tubule. These granular cells are of special interest because they contain a large number of heterologous biologically active peptides including nerve growth factor, epidermal growth factor, renin, and kallikrinins (Barka, 1980; Mori et al., 1983 ). The precise physiological role of many of these peptides in salivary gland remains uncertain. Epidermal growth factor was originally isolated from the mouse salivary gland.

Immunohistochemical study also demonstrates that epidermal growth factor becomes depleted in mouse salivary tissue following administration of phenylephrine and similar agents (Tsukitani and Mori, 1987) . Phenylephrine has been shown to cause marked secretory activity accompanied by loss of granules from granular cells, as well as loss of immune reactive carbonic anhydrase, an enzyme which participates both in membrane transport of bicarbonate ions into saliva and glandular secretion (Noda, 1986) . Morphological studies have shown that both acinar and granular tubular cells participate in this response to adrenergic agents (Murphy et al., 1980) . This is in contrast to the effects of pilocarpine, a cholinergic agent, which elicits the secretion of saliva deficient in serous proteins with little or none of the growth factors, as its effects are more limited to acinar cells.",

The condition is characterised histologically by oedema and congestion of submandibular and parotid salivary glands as well as extra-orbital lachrymal and harderian glands. It is accompanied by inflammation of variable severity and chronicity in both glandular and connective tissue as well as degeneration and necrosis of duct epithelium (Fig. 44) . The regenerative hyperplasia of the duct epithelium may be quite intense about a week after infection but all changes regress after about 2 weeks and glands are essentially normal after 3 or 4 weeks (Carthew and Slinger, 1981; Percy and Wojcinski, 1986) . There may be a delay in the appearance of inflammatory cells and the onset of repair in rats immunosuppressed with cyclophosphamide (Hanna et al., 1984) .

The non-obese diabetic mouse known for its spontaneous insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus also develops immune mediated damage to submandibular glands (Fujino-Kurihara et al., 1985; T\u00f6rnwall et al., 1999) . In ageing BDF1 females the submandibular gland was shown to be involved by a destructive inflammatory process characterised by an intense infiltration by small and medium sized lymphocytes, associated with mild inflammation in other organs such as the parotid and sublingual glands, pancreas and kidney. Immunocytochemistry showed that most of the lymphocytes were T cells (Thy-1.2 and Lyt-1 positive) of the helper/inducer subset (L3T4 or CD4 positive) and less than 10% were of suppresser/cytotoxic (Lyt-2 or CD8 Fig. 44 . Section from salivary tissue from a Sprague-Dawley rat during an infection with the sialodacryoadenitis virus showing intense ductular inflammation. (HE, \u00d725.) positive) type (see Haemopoietic and Lymphatic Systems, Chapter III). Circulating anti-salivary duct antibody of IgG was also detected in afflicted mice. It was suggested that helper/inducer T cells played a key role in the production of this change, unlike induced autoimmune sialoadenitis in which cytoxic T-cell subsets may directly destroy glandular tissue. It has been suggested that this process in ageing females is related to the decline in the number of splenic Lyt-2 cells in mice with advancing age (Hayashi et al., 1988) . These cells are believe to be the most susceptible to ageing (see Haemopoietic and Lymphatic Systems, Chapter III) In the non-obese diabetic strain of mouse derived from JcL-ICR mice, a periductal chronic inflammatory infiltrate is found in the submandibular gland at about the same time that immune-mediated insulitis is most marked. This suggests that there is an extension of the autoimmune process to salivary tissue (Fujino-Kurihara et al., 1985) . It is probable that helper/inducer CD4 T cells are essential components of this infiltrate and a number of cytokines and their receptors such as IP-10 (interferon-\u03b3 inducible protein 10) and RANTES (regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted) may have an important role (T\u00f6rnwall et al., 1999) .",

This sialoadenitis is characterised by degenerative changes in salivary glandular tissue associated with an extensive and intense infiltrate of small and medium sized lymphocytes. These cells appear shortly after immunisation but increase in number with time. Immunocytochemical study has shown that many of these cells are reactive to antisera to Thy-1.2 and Lyt-2 (CD8) features of suppresser/cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Later appearing cells demonstrate features of plasmacytoid lymphocytes and contain immunoglobulin of mainly IgG class (Hayashi et al., 1985) .

Drugs reported to produce salivary gland enlargement in man include iodide-containing radiological contrast media, isoprenaline and anti-inflammatory agents phenylbutazone and oxyphenbutazone. Enlargement may also occur after endotracheal anaesthesia and upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy in man (Riddell, 1982) . Some of these agents and procedures may produce spasm of large salivary ducts and retention of secretions. Several pharmacological agents, particularly sympathomimetic amines, have been shown to produce increases in salivary gland size in rodents following repeated dosing (Brenner and Stanton, 1970) . There is an intimate relationship of sympathomimetic amines with the control of the secretory process in salivary tissue. Whereas a single injection of isoprenaline (isoprotorenol) in the range of 20-200 mg/kg induces discharge of preformed secretory granules followed by gradual re-synthesis and reconstitution, repeated injections produces an increase in the size of salivary glands (Simson et al., 1974) . Histologically, the enlarged glands are composed of secretory cells of increased size that contain increased amounts of secretory substances in the cytoplasm (Simson et al., 1974) . Although these histological features are principally those of diffuse cellular hypertrophy, the increase in DNA content and radioactive thymidine uptake described in the salivary tissue following repeated administration of isoprenaline suggests that a degree of hyperplasia also occurs (Barka et al., 1972) .",

They may be found in various focal nodular and neoplastic states of the salivary glands in both man and laboratory animals. The precise significance of these cells is uncertain. The mitochondria usually appear unremarkable except for lack of dense granules and it has been suggested that the mito-chondrial changes represent an adaptive phenomenon or compensatory hyperplasia (Ghadially, 1982) . In human salivary tissue their prevalence seems to increase with advancing age and they can be associated with hyperplastic lesions or neoplasms such as oxyphil adenomas and adenolymphomas.",

In primates the changes were most striking in the interlobular and large intralobular ducts where the epithelium showed multilayered and papilliform projections.

Severe damage can occur following prolonged contact between mucosa and ingested tablets or capsules which results in local high concentrations of potentially irritant substances (Bott and McCallum, 1986; Brors, 1987; Kikendall, 1999; Levine, 1999) . Damage as a result of local contact may be more common in elderly subjects as the amplitude of oesophageal contractions decrease with age and capsules more liable to lodge in the lumen of the oesophagus (Bonavina et al., 1987) . However patients of all ages may be affected. Women have been injured more frequently than men probably because of the greater likelihood of their being treated with potentially injurious drugs (Kikendall, 1999) . The shape and surface coating of tablets may influence their tendency to adhere to the mucosa and lodge in the oesophagus (Marvola et al., 1983) . A wide variety of drugs have been implicated. In the United States the majority of cases appear to be caused by ingestion of tetracycline or doxacycline (Levine, 1999) . Some of the causative agents such as potassium chloride, aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are also implicated in ulceration lower in the gastrointestinal tract. Over recent years the bisphosphonate, alendronate has been one of the most commonly reported causes of adverse effects in the oesophagus with severe injury being reported. Although injury is linked to ingestion without water or failing to remain upright after swallowing the medication, alendronate is particularly caustic (Kikendall, 1999) .",

So-called megaoesophagus, characterised by enlargement of the oesophagus, degeneration of muscle fibres and ganglion cells in the myenteric plexus has also been described in certain strains of rats and mice (Harkness and Ferguson, 1979; Randelia and Lalitha, 1988) .

This occurs in rats treated with misprostol, a synthetic prostaglandin E1 methyl ester analogue with gastric anti-secretory and anti-ulcer activity (Kotsonis et al., 1985) , CL115,574, a synthetic analogue of prostaglandin E1 type (Kramer et al., 1985) and 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2 (Reinhart et al., 1983) . Even the extensively used antibiotic, ampicillin has been associated inflammation, ulceration with acanthosis and hyperkeratosis in mice but not rats treated for 2 years (National Toxicology Program Technical Report, 1987) . Sodium saccharin is also reported to produce hyperplasia without neoplasia of the forestomach in F344 rats (Hibino et al., 1985) .",

After 13 weeks' treatment, mucosal hyperplasia characterised by pronounced hyperkeratosis, parakeratosis and acanthosis most pronounced over the lesser curvature, was present in rats given 2% butylated hydroxyanisole in diet but not in rats given 0.5, 0.25 and 0.1% mixtures .

It was suggested that this difference was due to incomplete mixing of butylated hydroxyanisole in the stomach lumen when given by gavage and prolonged contact of the gavage mixture with the upper segment of the forestomach (Altmann et al., 1985) . More recently, it was shown that Fischer 344, SHR, Lewis and Sprague-Dawley rats differ in their response to the hyperplastic and carcinogenic effects of 2% butylated hydroxyanisole in pelleted diet. The most sensitive was the SHR strain followed by the F334 rats and the differences correlated with the cytotoxic effects of butylated hydroxyanisole in the different strains (Tamano et al., 1998) . It was suggested that the presence of vascular damage in the stomachs of the SHR rats might have contributed to the response to cytotoxicity and subsequent carcinogenicity.",

Although it has been demonstrated that butylated hydroxyanisole does not produce hyperplasia in the oesophagus of animals without a forestomach, have shown that high-doses given to primates are capable of producing an increase in mitotic activity in the lower end of the oesophagus similar to that occurring at equivalent exposure levels in the rat. The implication is that these interspecies differences may simply be a question of differences in exposure of the squamous mucosa to compound. This underlines the fact that mechanisms of action and exposure levels of xenobiotics attained in the gastrointestinal tract of rodent and non-rodent species as well as of man need to be carefully assessed when hyperplastic changes are induced in the forestomach mucosa of rodents. Such information can be helpful in facilitating regulatory decisions in this area (Moch, 1988) .",

In view of the low levels of exposure to butylated hydroxyanisole that occurs with the usual use of this agent, carcinogenic hazard for the human stomach is therefore probably very small. Similar phenomena have also been reported in studies of phenols and acids that are structurally related to butylated hydroxyanisole (Rodrigues et al., 1986) . These agents include n-butyl and n-propyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid esters, propionic acid and 4-methoxyphenol. However, these studies suggested that certain areas of the forestomach epithelium react differently to structurally related chemicals, possibly due to the variable levels of activating enzymes within different zones of the forestomach epithelium. Co-administration of acetylsalicylic acid was shown to abrogate some of these effects, suggesting that prostaglandin synthetase may be involved in the hyperplastic response (Rodrigues et al., 1986) .",

Some, but not all of these agents are also capable of producing squamous neoplasia of the forestomach mucosa of rats, or mice or both after long-term treatment (Kloss et al., 1991; Bueld et al., 1996; Akiba et al., 1998; Physicians' Desk Reference, 1999) . The mechanism of action remains unclear although the degree of hyperplasia seems related to pharmacological potency. Their carcinogenic potential in rodent bioassays does not seem to relate to the degree of hyperplasia in shortterm studies. Moreover, the development of hyperplasia depends on local high concentrations of drug because when administered by non-oral routes, hyperplasia does not occur (Kloss et al., 1991) . As most of these drugs are non-mutagenic, these findings are presumably also epigenetic in origin and possess relatively little risk for humans when given in the usual therapeutic doses.",

When fed to rats at doses of 1.0 and 10 mg/kg/day, aristolochic acid produced severe papillomatosis of the entire forestomach within a period of 3 months. This was characterised histologically by the presence of branched squamous papillomas up to 6 mm high with focal dysplastic features. Invasive squamous carcinomas with metastases were found subsequently, 3 or 6 months later without further treatment (Mengs et al., 1982) . Even at a low dose of 0.1 mg/kg/day papillomas and squamous carcinomas developed 9 months after a 3-month period of treatment.",

Administration of compounds in liquid or solid form, particle size, fasting and feeding all affect the gastric motility pattern. In the fasted state there is a cyclical pattern of motility consisting of three main phases. The first is a quiescent phase, followed by a phase of irregular contractions that increase in amplitude and frequency to reach a maximum in a third phase. Feeding results in the replacement of this cyclic pattern by regular tonic contractions that move food towards the antrum and mix it with gastric secretions. These patterns have been well studied in both dog and man and appear to be qualitatively similar in the two species (Sarna, 1985) . These motility patterns may have an impact on the length of time drugs remain in contact with stomach mucosa. For instance, the residence time of large non-disintegrating capsules or tablets administered in the fasting state is more dependent on the frequency of powerful phase III contraction than if drugs are given as fluids or mixed with diet. For dosage forms released in the stomach, gastric residence time will influence drug supply to the main absorptive surfaces in the small intestine, which in turn may affect drug absorption (Dressman, 1986) .",

Gastrin secreted from the G cells of antrum is the main stimulant of acid secretion. Somatostatin is secreted from antral D cells when the luminal pH falls to below 3.5 to act by a paracrine mechanism to suppress G cell function thus forming a negative feedback loop (Dockray, 1999) . The two main endocrine cell types from the body mucosa integrate neurohumoral stimuli rather than respond to luminal chemicals. Although gastrin is capable of stimulating parietal cells directly, it has an even greater effect through stimulation of enterochromaffin cells to release histamine, a potent paracrine stimulator of parietal cells (Hinkle and Samuelson, 1999) . Gastrin stimulates release of histamine from enterochromaffin cells of the body mucosa, which increases acid secretion through activation of parietal cell histamine-H 2 receptors. Both parietal and enterochromaffin cells are inhibited by somatostatin released from the D cells of the body mucosa in response to a variety of neurohumoral stimuli such as noradrenaline, vasoactive intestinal peptide, calcitonin gene-related peptide, and cholecystokinin. It should also be noted that gastrin has a role in kinetics and differentiation of both parietal and enterochromaffin cells (Dockray, 1999) .",

Electron microscopic and ultrastructural cytochemistry has suggested Note: Saccharide binding specifications are much more complex than the inhibition by simpler sugars outlined above suggests.

Graft experiments in mice have also suggested that immature cells of the isthmus differentiate into chief cells as well as parietal cells (Matsuyama and Suzuki, 1970) . Studies in transgenic mice have shown that mature parietal cells influence the fate of other gastric epithelial cells because targeted degeneration of parietal cells is associated with loss of chief cells suggesting interactions between these cell populations in determining their differentiation (Li et al., 1996; Canfield et al., 1996) . Gastrin is also an important regulator of parietal cell and enterochromaffin differentiation and number (Dockray, 1999; Montgomery et al., 1999) . Labelling experiments in the hamster stomach have shown that both chief and parietal cells possess a similar but quite long life span of about 200 days (Hattori, 1974; Hattori and Fujita, 1976) . It has been suggested that the relative distribution of chief and parietal cells in the gastric gland represents an expression of their different migration patterns downwards from the proliferative zones in the isthmus. This type of migration pattern in which cells are able to overtake each other has been termed a 'stochastic flow system' (Inokuchi et al., 1983) .",

These glycoproteins are high molecular weight compounds with large numbers of sugar chains attached to a polypeptide backbone by O-glycosidic linkages between N-acetylgalactosamine and serine or threonine (Berger et al., 1982) . The principle monosaccharides present are fucose, galactose, N-acetylgalactosamine, N-acetylglucosamine and sialic acid. Traces of mannose may be present and ester sulphate residues are common (Filipe, 1979) . Due to this extensive glycosylation, mucins have a filamentous conformation, which is often negatively charged. This is believed to be important in forming a protective barrier to the cell. However, this property is a two-edged sword because when opposing cells have specific receptors for mucins, adhesion may become the predominant factor (van Klinken et al., 1995) . Although mucins are important in the gastrointestinal tract, it should be remembered that other products secreted by goblet cells might be important in mucosal defence. It has been recently recognised that trefoil proteins, a family of small proteins secreted by goblet cells and present on the mucosal cell surface, can also protect against a variety of deleterious agents, including bacteria, toxins and drugs (Podolsky, 1999) .",

Neutral mucins generally predominate in the stomach, contrasting with acid mucins in the small intestine, and sulphated mucins in the colon. In the stomach neutral mucins staining purple with the PAS/alcian blue stain, predominate in the surface and foveolar mucosa, whereas mucous neck cells and antral glands contain acidic mucins that stain blue with PAS/alcian blue procedure. Sulphated mucins, as shown by the high iron diamine technique (HID) are also found in the deep glandular mucosa of the antrum in rat, mouse and man (Filipe, 1979; Jass, 1980; Greaves and Boiziau, 1984) . Extremely heterologous staining patterns are seen in the gastric mucosa with labelled lectins, each lectin staining quite different cell populations. There are considerable interspecies differences in staining patterns with the same lectins (Kuhlmann et al., 1983; Suganuma et al., 1984) . The so-called paradoxical Concanavalin A stain, in which conjugated Concanavalin A is used to label mucins before and after periodate oxidation, has also been used to classify the alterations in mucins in proliferative and neoplastic conditions of the rat stomach mucosa (Kobayasi et al., 1991; Tatematsu 1997 ).",

There is little that is histologically specific to drug-induced ulceration of the gastric glandular mucosa. Mucosal haemorrhage, depletion of mucin, erosions and ulcers with or without inflammation may all be found. Erosions represent mucosal breaks superficial to the muscularis mucosa. Ulcers are lesions that extend through the muscularis mucosa. Whilst the histopathological features of gastric erosions and ulcers are themselves relatively non-specific, it is important to look for any associated pathology in the stomach such as mucus depletion, epithelial hyperplasia or dysplasia, intestinal metaplasia and vascular lesions (see below).",

Formation of gastric and duodenal ulcers is dependent on the presence of both acid and peptic activity in gastric juice because acid without pepsin appears to have little digestive power. Important predisposing factors in human patients with peptic ulceration include Helicobacter pylori (Campylobacter pylori) infection of the antrum, cigarette smoking and ingestion of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (Soll, 1990) . Helicobacter pylori is believed to infect over half the human population and its presence in the gastric mucosa is associated with chronic atrophic gastritis and peptic ulceration (Cover and Blaser, 1996) . It is a microaerophilic, gram-negative organism that possesses potent urease activity crucial for its survival at acidic pH. Genome sequence analysis has shown that Helicobacter pylori has well developed sequences for motility, scavenging iron and DNA restriction and modification systems used by bacteria to degrade foreign DNA. The link between Helicobacter pylori infection and peptic ulceration is related to increases in gastrin release, perhaps through bacterial products or cytokines released from activated lymphocytes (Richter-Dahlfors et al., 1998) . Although Helicobacter pylori can infect other species, apart from non-human primates, the usual laboratory animal models do not appear to develop the inflammatory disease seen in humans (Nedrud, 1999) .",

The requirement to give the test compound in high doses may also dictate the need to administer exceedingly high concentrations of test agent. This may produce damaging high local concentrations on the mucosa not relevant to therapeutic doses used in clinical practice. It has been demonstrated that hyperosmolar solutions of quite innocuous substances such as glucose can cause haemorrhage, erosions and ulcers of the rat gastric mucosa (Puurunen et al., 1980) . The well-known association of gastric erosions and haemorrhage with uraemia may also be manifest following administration of high doses of drugs such as diuretics which severely derange fluid and electrolyte balance (Garthoff et al., 1982) . Stress ulceration may be linked to temporary ischaemia of the mucosa (Dubois, 1987) . Synergism between the ulcerogenic action of drugs and stress is a well-described phenomenon (Rainsford, 1975; Beattie, 1977) . Protein depletion and starvation is also capable of inducing gastric ulceration in rats .",

Single oral doses of some non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs including aspirin produced widespread superficial damage and desquamation of gastric epithelium with little or no inflammation at 6 hours following dosing which completely healed 2 weeks later. This damage was associated with transient faecal blood loss. By contrast, indomethacin and ibuprofen produced both gastric damage and circumscribed, penetrating ulcers along the mesenteric border of the jejunum and ileum. Furthermore, ulcers were still present after 2 weeks and were associated with prolonged or biphasic blood loss (see Small Intestine).",

Such a response may be the basis for increased resistance of the gastric mucosa to the chronic affects of these agents. It also may explain the tendency for ulcers to occur in the antrum following chronic administration of aspirin-like drugs as the proliferative response and presumably the adaptive potential appears less in this part of the gastric mucosa.",

It develops in man in gastric mucosa altered by chronic atrophic gastritis and its significance is due to the fact that a link exists between intestinal metaplasia and gastric cancer. Although intestinal metaplasia is found much less commonly in laboratory animals, it has also been reported to occur in association with gastric cancer induced by polychlorinated biphenyls (Ward, 1985) . In view of this association with gastric cancer, it has been suggested that intestinal metaplasia represents a pre-neoplastic lesion. However, over recent years prospective clinical studies and experimental data have suggested that it is an epiphenomenon, coexisting with, but unrelated to the development of cancer. In man, several forms of intestinal metaplasia have been described. These variants fall into two main groups, an incomplete type and a complete form (Teglbjaerg and Nielson, 1978; Jass and Filipe, 1979; Jass, 1980) . Complete intestinal metaplasia is characterised by the presence of goblet cells, Paneth cells and absorptive cells with brush borders and variably developed intestinal villi. Incomplete forms are more heterogeneous characterised by goblet and mucous columnar cells but no absorptive cells and variable patterns of mucin. The routine alcian blue: pH 2.5, periodic acid-Schiff stain (AB/PAS) ( Table 2) distinguishes between the intestinal acid mucins (blue) from the neutral mucins of gastric type. However, variable sialomucin and sulphomucin staining patterns are seen in intestinal metaplasia in man with the high iron-diamine/alcian blue stain (HID/AB) (Jass, 1980) . The incomplete form of intestinal metaplasia, showing marked sulphomucin secretion, has been found more commonly in association with gastric cancer in man (Jass and Filipe, 1979; Jass, 1980; Wells et al., 1982) . However, prospective studies have tended to indicate that intestinal metaplasia with sulphomucin secretion may be an age-related form of chronic atrophic gastritis and not a premalignant lesion (Ectors and Dixon, 1986) . It has been suggested that intestinal metaplasia represents an adaptive response to long-standing chronic inflammation and reduced acid secretion. It may also represent an adaptive defensive response to long-standing Helicobacter pylori infection because intestinal mucosa is more resistant to these organisms (Steer, 1984; Ectors and Dixon, 1986) .",

Fischer 344 rats treated with the polychlorinated biphenyl, Aroclor 1254, mixed in the diet for 2 years developed foci of intestinal metaplasia in the stomach epithelium in association with gastric adenocarcinomas (Ward, 1985) . These lesions were characterised by abundant mucin-containing cells and alkaline phosphatase activity typical of the small intestine (Morgan et al., 1981; Ward, 1985) . Similar, but more diffuse intestinal metaplasia was reported in the stomach of primates treated with polychlorinated biphenyls, although unassociated with gastric neoplasia (Allen, 1975; McConnell et al., 1979) . Intestinal metaplasia is also found in the stomach of laboratory animals treated with powerful genotoxic gastric carcinogens. Although Tsiftsis et al. (1980) showed hyperplasia and foci of atypical changes (dysplasia) but little or no intestinal metaplasia in rats following administration of N-methyl-N\u00b4-nitro-N-nitroguanidine, Tatematsu et al. (1983) were able to show intestinal metaplasia in rats treated with the same agent. However, intestinal metaplasia can be induced in rodents by a variety of different procedures that are not associated with the development of gastric cancer. Intestinal metaplasia can be induced in the glandular stomach of rodents by fractionated, localised, ionising radiation (Watanabe, 1978; Watanabe et al., 1980) , injection of xenogenic stomach antigens as well as propantheline bromide and the non-carcinogen, iodoacetamine Shirai et al., 1985) .",

Studies in the rat have shown that diffuse atrophy of the gastric glands characterised by a decrease in the number and size of parietal, chief and mucous cells occurs transiently following truncal vagotomy but histological features return to normal by about 1 month after surgery (Nakamura, 1985) . By contrast, unilateral vagotomy in the rat leads to marked and persistent atrophy of the oxyntic zone on the denervated side. This is characterised histologically by reduced height of the mucosa and reduced numbers and staining intensity of argyrophil cells (Hakanson et al., 1984) . H\u00e5kanson and his colleagues argued that this unilateral atrophy was due to the removal of the trophic action of the vagus. The lack of lasting atrophy after bilateral but not unilateral vagotomy was explained by the subsequent rise in gastrin that occurs after bilateral vagotomy as a result of lack of acid feedback inhibition of gastrin release (H\u00e5kanson et al., 1984) .",

Morphometric techniques have shown that hypertrophy of some mucosal cells can coexist with hyperplasia of other gastric cell populations. A distinction also needs to be made between diffuse or uniform hyperplasia involving one or more of the cell populations from the hyperplasia associated with proliferative or adenomatous overgrowth.

However, based on findings in female Han NMRI mice, Rehm et al. (1987) showed that this proliferative condition can develop in mice in the absence of antiparietal antibodies.

These lesions were characterised by the presence of proliferating gastric glands lined by columnar, cuboidal or flattened epithelial cells in the mucosa, which also extended through the muscularis mucosa. Mucus content of these glands was variable but when present was principally acidic in type, as shown by staining with alcian blue at pH 2.5. The lesions were accompanied by increased collagen in the lamina propria, endarteritis and an infiltration of lymphocytes, plasma cells and mast cells.

It was shown that hyperplasia developing under these conditions occurs diffusely both in the body and antral mucosa. Furthermore, the changes occurred earlier in the antrum than in the body and were focal or polypoid in character (Tsiftsis et al., 1980) . Involvement of the antrum in this way is quite unlike the spontaneous hyperplasia of the rat gastric mucosa. Histologically, this form of hyperplasia is characterised by lengthening of the foveolae and neck regions both in the antrum and body.

            "text": "It is important to assess gastric mucosa very carefully for the features of dysplasia when hyperplastic gastric changes are found in treated animals. In the rat gastric cancer model employing the carcinogen N-methyl-N\u00b4-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine, dysplastic changes were shown to start in the proliferating neck region of hyperplastic zones (Tsiftsis et al., 1980) . These changes were characterised histologically by irregular growth patterns of glandular cells showing reduced mucin secretion, numerous mitoses and enlarged pleomorphic nuclei. These atypical glands were observed to extend downwards, eventually replacing normal gastric glands and ultimately penetrating the muscularis mucosa forming infiltrating adenocarcinomas of variable differentiation. The antrum developed these changes earlier than the body mucosa (Tsiftsis et al., 1980) . These considerations were important in the safety evaluation of the histamine H 2 receptor antagonist, tiotidine (ICI 125,211) a guanidino-thiazole derivative that also produced proliferative gastric lesions in the stomach of rats in a 24month carcinogenicity study (Streett et al., 1984; . These changes were found mainly in the pyloric region and were characterised histologically by superficial erosions and irregular pyloric glands lined by cells with basophilic cytoplasm and enlarged hyperchromatic nuclei. Some atypical glands penetrated the muscularis mucosae. Dysplastic lesions situated primarily in the pyloric region were also associated with the development of invasive carcinoma in some rats. Extensive histological sectioning of the stomach in rats treated with tiotidine for only 6 months also revealed evidence of early proliferative changes (Streett et al., 1988) . Therefore, these lesions produced by tiotidine possessed more in common with those induced by powerful carcinogens such as N-methyl-N\u00b4-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine than the benign, species-specific proliferative change of little or no relevance for human safety. Interestingly, mice treated for 18 months with tiotidine were devoid of dysplastic changes in the gastric mucosa (Streett et al., 1988) .",

This argument is supported by the fact that similar morphological findings are reported in chronic atrophic gastritis and other achlorhydric sites in man (Solchia et al., 1986; M\u00fcller et al., 1987) and that antrectomy in the rat prevents the appearance of enterochromaffin hyperplasia following treatment with omeprazole .",

Why mice neither developed neither argyrophil hyperplasia nor gastric carcinoids with a similar treatment regimen is not clear, as the mechanism of action of omeprazole is similar in rat, dog and mouse. However, as the duration of action of omeprazole is shorter in the mouse, it was postulated that sustained inhibition of gastric acid secretion over 24 hours is necessary to activate increased gastrin secretion from antral cells (Havu, 1986) . It has also been suggested that the mouse possesses fewer gastric enterochromaffin cells than the rat and shows a much lower serum gastrin response to omeprazole treatment (Ekman et al., 1985) . Duration of action or potency may also be the explanation for the lack of reports of carcinoid neoplasms in rats following inhibition of gastric acid secretion by the histamine H 2 -receptor blockers cimetidine and ranitidine. Neither of these drugs completely inhibits gastric acid secretion in the rat for 24 hours (Leslie and Walker, 1977; Larsson et al., 1986) , although mild gastric neuroendocrine hyperplasia has been recently described in cimetidine-treated rats (Hirth et al., 1988) .",

It now seems likely that all those observed cancers associated with cimetidine were incidental (Penston and Wormsley, 1986) . However, at that time concerns were increased by the theoretical possibility that cimetidine has the potential be nitrosated in vivo (Elder et al., 1982) . A further factor was the concept that the treatment-induced gastric secretory inhibition with subsequent bacterial colonisation of the stomach rendered the conditions conducive to the generation of N-nitroso compounds from normal dietary constituents (Reed et al., 1981; Penston and Wormsley, 1986) .",

A 7-year study in dogs in which multiple gastric biopsies were taken at intervals of approximately 6 months have also shown no indication of gastric hyperplasia, dysplasia, intestinal metaplasia or neoplastic change . Although complacency is certainly not warranted with respect to the nitrosation of therapeutic agents in vivo, the risks of development of gastric malignancy from such drugs when administered on a short-term basis are probably very small (World Health Organisation, 1978) .

It has been shown that in the rat, the concentration of cytochrome P450 and drug metabolising enzyme activity increases in intestinal epithelial cells as they move from crypt to villous tips and they are found in greater concentration in the proximal two-thirds of the small intestine than in the distal third (Hoensch et al., 1976; Bonkovsky et al., 1985) . Bonkovsky et al.

Furthermore, it has been shown that drug metabolising activity in the tips of the villi in the duodenum is greater in rats fed a conventional diet than a semisynthetic diet and that the activity depends critically on the absorption of iron from the intestine (Hoensch et al., 1976) .",

Goblet cells are characterised by the presence of abundant mucous droplets formed by the Golgi complex and which accumulate in the apical part of the cell cytoplasm. Histochemical study shows that neutral mucosubstances are present in the goblet cells found in crypts and on the villi in the entire small bowel mucosa of most species including man but there is an interspecies variation in the population of sialo-and sulphomucins (Sheahan and Jarvis, 1976) . In the mouse, sulphomucins predominate but among rats considerable individual variation in the proportion of sialo-and sulphomucins is reported. In the hamster, sulphomucins are more prominent in the proximal and sialomucins in the distal small bowel. In the dog, both sulphomucins and sialomucins are found with predominance of one or other in individual animals. Staining for acidic mucins is less intense in the goblet cells of the small intestine in man compared with non-human primates but sialomucins are predominant in both species. A few goblet cells in the distal ileum in man also contain sulphated mucins (Sheahan and Jarvis, 1976) .",

They are found in rodents and man but typically not in carnivores such as dog and cat (Rhodin, 1974; . They are characterised by the presence of numerous eosinophilic cytoplasmic secretory granules between about 1.0 and 2 \u00b5m diameter that contain various enzymes and mucosubstances. Particular care is needed in fixation and staining for optimal demonstration of Paneth cells for they rapidly degranulate after death and granules are destroyed by acetic acid fixation. Formalin and mercuric fixatives appear appropriate methods and they permit staining with methylene blue, Lendrum's phloxine-tartrazine and Masson's trichrome (Lewin, 1969) . The apical parts of Paneth cells show glucose-6-phosphatase, carbonic anhydrase and monoamine oxidase activity and they have been shown to contain lysozyme and immunoglobulins, particularly IgA (Speece, 1964; Riecken and Pearse, 1966; Ghoos and Vantrappen, 1971; . Staining for lysozyme appears to be the most practical immunocytochemical stain for the detection of Paneth cells in formalin fixed paraffin wax embedded tissue sections. However, other immunocytochemical reagents have been employed in human and rodent tissues. These include antibodies to the CD15 antigen (Ariza et al., 1996) and to a rat Paneth cell zinc binding protein (Sawada et al., 1994) as well as the use of pokeweed lectin for murine Paneth cells (Evans et al., 1994) .",

Intraepithelial lymphocytes are also mainly T cells (Bruder et al., 1999) . Many plasma cells present in the lamina propria produce IgA, the major immunoglobulin of mucosal secretions (Michalek et al., 1975) . IgA represents another important component of the mucosal barrier between the gastrointestinal mucosa and intraluminal antigens. The main function of IgA is to effect immune exclusion by intimate co-operation with non-specific defence mechanisms (Brandtzaeg et al., 1985) . Plasma cells in the lamina propria produce dimeric IgA with two dimeric molecules joined by a joint (J) piece. A secretory component (SC), a glycoprotein expressed on the basolateral surface of epithelial cells acts as a receptor for dimeric IgA and as a transport system for IgA to the gut lumen where monomeric IgA is secreted (Brandtzaeg et al., 1985) . Morphometric analysis of IgA-containing immunocytes in the rat ileal mucosa using immunocytochemical staining has shown that the number of these cells varies with alterations in the microbiological status of intestinal contents (Rodning et al., 1983) . A significant reduction in IgA-containing lymphocytes and plasma cells was observed following microbial reduction associated with gnotobiosis, probably reflecting decreased microbial antigenic stimulation. Experimental studies using labelled mesenteric lymphocytes also suggests that local microenvironments are important in the distribution of there cells in the intestinal wall (McDermott et al., 1985) .",

Peyer's patches are located on the ante-mesenteric wall of the small bowel and consist principally of collections of lymphoid follicles. In man, Peyer's patches are more common in the ileum (Cornes, 1965) but in mice they are more uniformly distributed (Owen and Neumanic, 1978) . In rats they are also more numerous in the distal than in the proximal small intestine and the number of follicles in patches usually varies from 2 to 6 but sometimes many more may be seen in any particular section (Martin et al., 1986) . Peyer's patches vary between rat strains. A comparative study showed that in Fischer 344 rats they are smaller than those in Wistar rats (Bruder et al., 1999) . Particular care in selection and orientation of tissue blocks is therefore essential for any form of quantitative or semiquantitative assessment of Peyer's patches.",

These cells have been identified in many species including rats, mice, hamsters, dogs, monkeys and man (Owen and Bhalla, 1983; Wolf and Bye, 1984) . These cells differ functionally from other enterocytes by their ability to transport large molecules such as ferritin and horseradish peroxidase and particulate matter from the lumen to the underlying lymphoid tissue (Owen, 1977; Jeurissen et al., 1985) . They have also been shown to be the site of penetration of reoviruses into the epithelium and they can transport Vibrio cholerae and other organisms (Wolf and Bye, 1974; Smith et al., 1987) . M cells therefore form weak points in the intestinal wall which transport intact antigen and macromolecules to the follicles where they can be processed and be transported to lymph nodes with consequent IgA immune responses. This contrasts with the uptake of soluble antigens, which can be taken up by ordinary epithelial cells and transported in the circulation of the villi to be ultimately trapped in the spleen possibly to evoke an IgM/ IgG response (Jeurissen et al., 1985) . Understanding of these cellular and molecular characteristics is critical for the design of mucosal vaccines for pathogens that exploit this pathway (Neutra, 1998) .",

These differences result in poor preservation of mast cells of the gut if the usual metachromatic staining techniques employed for the demonstration of mast cells in tissue sections (Wingren and Enerb\u00e4ck, 1983) . Histochemical study suggests that mucosal mast cells differ from connective tissue mast cells by a lower degree of sulphation of glycosaminoglycans and different spatial relationships of protein and glycosaminoglycans in their granules. These cross link following formalin fixation in a way, which is sufficient to prohibit cationic dye binding.

Another more versatile technique applicable to rodent, large animal and human intestine can be performed after fixation. The unfixed opened bowel is pinned flat on a cork or board and fixed in a bath of formal saline. After fixation, the full thickness of rodent intestine can be rolled, transfixed by a pin and embedded in paraffin wax. Likewise the mucosa of the intestine of large animal species or humans can be rolled after fixation by separating it from the muscularis externa (Filipe and Branfoot, 1974) .",

They are opportunistic agents that can become important in both animals and man with depressed immune function. Studies in mice infected experimentally with Giardia muris have shown that an early response is an increased infiltration of the epithelium by lymphocytes, predominantly T cells (Gillon et al., 1982) . This has led to the suggestion that the response to infection by these parasite is primarily a cell-mediated immune reaction similar to experimental graft versus host reaction in the small intestine of mice (Mowat and Furguson, 1981; Gillon et al., 1982) . Depression of the immune response by treatment with corticosteroids has been shown not only to increase parasite numbers in murine giardiasis but also cause recrudescence of occult infections (Nair et al., 1981) . It has also been suggested that decreased gastric acidity can predispose to giardiasis in man (Nalin et al., 1978) .",

Transmission electron microscopy reveals the detailed internal structure of cryptosporidium attached to the microvillous surface of the epithelial cells. The various stages in the life cycle have been visualised by light and electron microscopy. Infection starts with ingestion of an oocyst containing four sporozoites, which are probably released by the action of digestive enzymes. These attach themselves to the intestinal mucosa and undertake their life cycle attached to the epithelial cells (Casemore et al., 1985) .

It has been postulated that indomethacin-induced intestinal ulcers in rats and dogs are produced by a prostaglandin-independent mechanism, different from the manner in which gastric ulceration is induced (Tabata and Okabe, 1980; Whittle, 1981) . Conversely, Satoh et al. (1981) have suggested that similar mechanisms are responsible for both gastric and intestinal ulceration. They showed that indomethacin-induced gastric ulceration developed in the body mucosa in fasted rats but in the antrum and small intestine in rats given indomethacin 30 minutes after a 1-hour period of refeeding following a 24-hour fast. There was good temporal correlation between the development of intestinal ulcers and inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis (Satoh et al., 1981) . The ulcers in the small intestine were morphologically similar to those occurring in the stomach and they were distributed mainly in the mucosa on the mesenteric aspect of the bowel wall.",

These ulcers were deep, punchedout lesions, many of which were lying over Peyer's patches (Stewart et al., 1980) . Some ulcers involved the whole circumference of the small intestine wall. Histologically, the ulcers were associated with an intense inflammatory response principally of mononuclear cells, which infiltrated the bowel wall to the serosa particularly adjacent to Peyer's patches. It was suggested that this distribution of ulcers was a result of an exaggerated immune response to normal intestinal antigens. These antigens may have been produced by inhibition of suppresser cells in Peyer's patches, following depression of prostaglandin synthetase by indomethacin (Stewart et al., 1980) . Special dye techniques, scanning and transmission electron microscopy have also shown that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs also produce adverse effects on the small intestine mucosa without overt pathological changes being evident by light microscopy (Brodie et al., 1970; Djaldetti and Fishman, 1981) . Following administration of aspirin to mice for 5 weeks, shortening and erosion of microvilli and increased numbers of goblet cells were only demonstrated in the duodenum and jejunum by scanning and transmission electron microscopy (Djaldetti and Fishman, 1981) .

These compounds vary in their ulcerogenic capacity but they are all able to produce ulcers of chronic type with crater formation, granulation tissue and reactive changes in adjacent mucosa in the anterior and posterior wall of the proximal segment of the duodenum of rodents. Although these different agents influence gastric acid secretion in different ways, structure-activity relationships suggest that they produce duodenal dysmotility, decrease bicarbonate production and reduce its delivery from the distal to proximal duodenum. These factors decrease the neutralisation of gastric acid in the first part of the duodenum and this may contribute to the development of ulceration (Szabo and Cho, 1988) . Furthermore, these effects can be attenuated or prevented by dopamine agonists or their precursors whereas dopamine antagonists can potentiate their effects. This suggests that the central or peripheral dopamine-mediated actions of these agents may be involved in the pathogenesis of duodenal ulceration (Szabo, 1979; .",

After administration of Sa H51-055 to rats, there was progressive accumulation of lipid droplets in the epithelial cells over the tips of the duodenal villi demonstrable by osmium tetroxide staining. Ultrastructural examination revealed uniform electron-lucent droplets within profiles of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. Lipid droplets increased with time, accumulated and coalesced to form large droplets in the lamina propria. Larger droplets were phagocytosed by macrophages in the lamina propria but there was no evidence of epithelial damage or necrosis.

The absence of any other subcellular changes or evidence of derangement of protein synthesis suggested that Sa H51-055 altered the pathways of lipid resynthesis or transport. This was consistent with the distribution of the lipid in the upper third of the jejunal villous epithelium, a zone most active in lipid absorption, resynthesis and transport (Dobbins, 1969) . It was suggested fatty change might have taken place because of alterations in the sugar moiety of chylomicra brought about by interference with glucose transport (Visscher et al., 1980) . Lipid droplets which stained with oil-red-O in formalin-fixed frozen sections and showed uniform electron density characteristic of neutral lipid were also observed in the epithelial cells and macrophages in the lamina propria of jejunum and duodenum and mesenteric lymph nodes in rats given a synthetic 2'-dodecyl glutaramide ester of erythromycin (Gray et al., 1974) . Unlike the erythromycin base, rats poorly tolerated this ester. It appeared that the ester was absorbed unhydrolyzed and converted to chylomicron-like droplets, which then accumulated in the macrophages of the lamina propria and local mesenteric lymph nodes, without overt damage to epithelial cells.",

Fischer 344 rats were very sensitive to these changes compared to Sprague-Dawley rats and Wistar rats were almost completely resistant to lipidosis induced by amiodarone under similar conditions (Mazu\u00e9 et al., 1984) .",

Carefully controlled studies in rats given different forms of dietary fibre have shown that the prolif-erative characteristics of the small intestine can be modified by both the quantity and the quality of the fibre. One study has shown a decrease in the length of villi, crypt cell hyperplasia and shorter transit times in rats fed pectin-supplemented diet but an increase in mucosal growth without alteration in relative differences in crypt and villous length with guar supplementation compared with rats fed fibre-free diet (Jacobs, 1983) . Another rat study has shown that pectin feeding leads to increased mucosal area and height associated with an increase muscle mass (Stark et al., 1996) . These different effects may be the result of differences in solubility, gel formation, water holding capacity, effect on transit time and ion exchange activity or bile acid adsorption of the different fibres. Interactions between dietary constituents are complex. For instance, in rats the effects of 2% dietary cholestyramine, a non-absorbable ion exchange resin, on small intestinal histomorphology have be shown to depend on interaction of dietary factors (Burkhardt et al., 1998) .",

The enlargement was most marked in the proximal segment of the small intestine and progressively diminished towards the ileocaecal junction, sparing the stomach, caecum and colon. Histological examination and morphometric analysis revealed an increase in smooth muscle mass, lengthening of the villi as well as an increase in the depth and cellular proliferation in the crypts of Lieberkuhn without evidence of cell damage or fatty change. Like the changes following jejunal bypass procedures, there was also an increase in acid mucosubstances in the goblet cell population overlying the villous mucosa (Smith et al., 1989) . The mechanism for this change in the rat was not clear, particularly as intestinal hyperplasia was not seen in baboons treated with this 15-ketosterol for long periods.

Treatment of rats with adrenaline, isoprenaline, phenylephrine, phentolamine and yohimbine all result in decreased mitotic activity of jejunal and colonic crypt cells (Tutton and Helme, 1974; Kennedy et al., 1983) . By contrast, administration of metaraminol, clonidine, propranolol, prazosin and labetolol as well as simultaneous injection of propranolol and adrenaline all resulted in an increased rate of crypt cell proliferation (Kennedy et al., 1983) . These results suggest that agents that stimulate \u03b12 adrenergic receptor activity and those that are \u03b11-antagonists and \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonists increase proliferative activity in the rodent intestinal mucosa. Caffeine is also reported to produce an increase in thickness of the intestinal mucosa when administered in high doses to rats (Lachance, 1982) . This raises the possibility that intestinal mucosal hyperplasia can be produced by phosphodiesterase inhibition and resultant increases in intracellular cAMP in a similar way to the hypertrophy induced in salivary tissue. This is supported by recent findings in rats treated for periods of up to 6 months with the inotropic vasodilator, ICI 153,110, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor intended for treatment of congestive cardiac failure. Administration of high doses not only produced salivary gland hypertrophy but also marked thickening of the small and large intestinal mucosa. This was characterised histologically by an increase in villous length and deepening of intestinal glands, with a relatively unchanged number of epithelial cells per unit length of gland or villus (Westwood et al., 1990) .",

One of these is the typical goblet cell with cytoplasmic mucous droplets forming a goblet shape, which is found both in glandular and surface epithelium. The other type, the so-called vacuolated cell or mucous cell, is found only in the crypts (Chang and Leblond, 1971; Thomopoulos et al., 1983) . These vacuolated or mucous cells show empty-appearing vacuoles in the cytoplasm which rather than being empty contain abundant sialomucins of a type different from those in goblet cells (Spicer, 1965; Wetzel et al., 1966) . Detailed structural studies and cytochemistry using lectin probes have suggested that these vacuolated cells are able to differentiate into absorptive cells with the cellular apparatus to produce the cell surface glycoconjugates of the glycocalyx (Thomopoulos et al., 1983) .",

In some strains of rat, cells in these glands express the Ia antigen, unlike the other parts of the colonic epithelium (Martin et al., 1986) . These glandular structures, which are intimately associated with lymphoid tissue, may be important in the immune protection of the colonic mucosa, perhaps by acting as a special local receptor for antigens . It has been proposed that these glandular structures represent sites of predilection for the spread of inflammatory disease to the submucosa by allowing microorganisms to pass through the muscularis mucosa (Scott, 1982) . It has also been suggested that they constitute physical weak points in the bowel wall and may play a part in the pathogenesis of diverticular disease of the colon in man . Colonic carcinomas induced by dimethylhydrazine in the rat also appear to develop more commonly in the lymphoid aggregates than in other zones (Martin et al., 1986) . M cells have been described over the lymphoid aggregates in the caecum of the mouse (Owen and Nemanic, 1978) , see Small Intestine.",

Similar changes have been reported in antibiotic-treated guinea pigs and rabbits (Rehg and Lu, 1981; Rehg and Pakes, 1981) . Guinea pigs are particularly sensitive to antibiotics especially those active against gram-positive organisms (Young et al., 1987) . As in man, these drugs are believed to alter the intestinal flora, permitting overgrowth of Clostridium difficile as well as gram-negative organisms, resulting in a severe and frequently fatal enterocolitis. A study of the disposition of ampicillin administered parenterally to guinea pigs showed that this drug was rapidly eliminated from the systemic circulation and excreted in urine and bile, possibly favouring this effect on flora in the colon (Young et al., 1987) .",

Less common complications of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and potassium chloride therapy in humans are colonic strictures. It appears that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs produce local inflammation followed by focal scarring of the submucosa with constriction and formation of a mucosal diaphragm whereas potassium causes segmental full thickness scarring and constriction (Fellows et al., 1992; Haque et al., 1992; van Velzen et al., 1996; Wolfe et al., 1999) . Another form of induced colon damage has been reported in children with cystic fibrosis, the majority of who take high strength pancreatic-enzyme supplements to control malabsorption (Smyth et al., 1994; FitzSimmons et al., 1997) . This condition has distinctive pathological features. There is involvement a long segment of ascending colon by a fusiform stenosis primarily as a result of submucosal thickening by deposition of mature collagen. The mucosa appears relatively spared but shows some ulceration and reparative changes (van Velzen et al., 1996) . Although it has been suggested that the changes may have been linked to the methylacrylate copolymer used for enteric coating of the high-strength preparations, a case-control study showed a strong relation between high daily doses of the enzyme supplements, accentuated by more recent availability of high dose forms (FitzSimmons et al., 1997) .

Dogs administered 2.5 mg/kg indomethecin orally each day for periods of up to 23 days developed not only gastric and small intestinal ulceration but also scattered haemorrhagic erosions in the colon and rectum. Histologically, these lesions were characterised by loss of superficial epithelial cells, mucus-depletion of glandular epithelium, crypt abscesses, frequently with acute inflammation in adjacent lymphoid aggregates in the submucosa (Stewart et al., 1980) . An example of chemically induced colitis of relevance to safety assessment of therapeutic agents is that induced by degraded carrageenans or synthetic sulphated dextrans. Carrageenans are a heterogeneous group of sulphated polysaccharides composed mainly of long chains of D-galactose subunits (D-galactan) derived from red seaweed species which are widely used as food emulsifiers, stabilisers, thickeners and gelling agents (Ishioka et al., 1987) . When carrageenans are degraded by acid hydrolysis into smaller molecular weight fragments of about 20,000-40,000 and administered orally in high doses (e.g. 10% of diet) to rats, mice, guinea pigs, rabbits and rhesus monkeys, colitis results (Sharratt et al., 1970; Marcus and Watt, 1971; Benitz et al., 1973; Fath et al., 1984; Kitano et al., 1986) . Similarly, colitis has been induced in rats following administration of a 5% dietary admixture of dextran sulphate sodium, a sulphated polymer of glucose (a D-glucose) of molecular weight of 54,000 (Hirono et al., 1981) and a very high molecular weight D-glucan, amylopectin sulphate (Ishioka et al., 1987) .",

It was therefore proposed that carrageenan-induced colitis could be the result of increased intestinal permeability to antigenic or inflammatory substances normally resident in the large intestine. Moreover, long-term administration of high doses of these agents to rats leads to the development of colorectal cancer despite their being devoid of any mutagenic potential (see below).

Following resection of a segment of colon in rats, Barkla and Tutton (1985) showed that the remaining proximal segment of the right side of the colon showed an increase in the thickness of the mucosa and the muscularis externa as well as enlargement of lymphoid aggregates. Histologically, the mucosa of the right side of the colon was uniformly thickened showing accentuated folds, elongated mucosal glands with increased height of the surface columnar cells. The changes were most marked up to 30 days following surgery but were less pronounced after 72 days. There was also a significant increase in the mitotic index in the proximal segment at 7 days although at 14 days and later the mitotic index had returned to normal. The distal, down-stream segment showed little or no morphological change but rather a long-lived increase in mitotic activity. It was suggested that these differences were related to the different embryological origin of the segments (Barkla and Tutton, 1985) .",

Oral administration of a wide range of compounds such as raw and chemically modified starches, various dietary fibres, caramels, sugar alcohols (lactitol, sorbitol, mannitol, xylilol), lactose, a synthetic polydextrose, polyethylene glycol and magnesium sulphate to rats or hamsters has also been linked to an increase caecal size and colonic mucosal hyperplasia (Leegwater et al., 1974; Roe and B\u00e4r, 1985; Newberne et al., 1988; Stark et al., 1996) . The characteristic histological appearance of the caecum following administration of these agents is lengthening of the mucosal glands which are lined by epithelium composed of increased numbers of enlarged epithelial cells (i.e. hypertrophy and hyperplasia) showing increased proliferative activity and more rapid incorporation of tritiated thymidine (Newberne et al., 1988) . In addition, mucosal and submucosal oedema has been reported in association with the administration of lactose and increased mucosal lymphoid aggregates following lactose or xylitol feeding (Newberne et al., 1988) . Changes in the colon due to fibre are complex. Morphometric analysis has shown that changes to the mucosa depend on the fibre type (Stark et al., 1996) . There may also be an interaction between dietary fibre content and colonic microflora that influences mucosal growth, although the mechanism is unclear (Whiteley et al., 1998) . Hypertrophy of the muscularis external is also reported in rats fed high fibre diets (Stark et al., 1996) .",

Most of these arise in the small intestine and appear to originate in the distal part of the small intestine, caecum and right side of the colon. They may produce metastases, mostly to liver and lungs. In a review of spontaneous adeno-carcinomas developing over a 17-year period in Wistar rats, Vandenberghe et al. (1985) identified 17 adenocarcinomas, all in ascending colon. In 15 of these cases there appeared to be an intimate relationship with campylobacter-like organisms together with diverticulae and chronic inflammation. These authors suggested that the organisms and the associated inflammation were involved in the pathogenesis of these cancers. In view of the importance of colon cancer in humans, a number of new genetic mouse models predisposed to colon cancer have been developed over recent years (Heyer et al., 1999) .",

The histogenesis of these induced carcinomas has been extensively studied and it is generally accepted that they resemble human colorectal cancer (Ward, 1974; Freeman, 1983) . However, there are differences between reported studies. Some have shown that these experimental carcinomas arise from pre-existing adenomas consistent with the 'adenoma-carcinoma sequence' theory (Ward, 1974; Ward et al., 1977) . Others suggest that they arise 'de novo' from altered mucosa as microinvasive carcinomas (Sunter et al., 1978; Maskens and Dujardin-Loits, 1981; Rubio et al., 1986) . These differences may be partly the result of different dosage schedules. Rubio et al. (1988) have shown that a single dose of 1,2-dimethyhydrazine produces non-polypoid, micro-invasive carcinomas, particularly in the mucosa overlying lymphoid aggregates, whereas in their earlier studies using multiple doses in the same strain of rat, an adenoma-carcinoma sequence was more evident. In addition, there are undoubtedly species and strain differences in the response to these agents. Teague et al. (1981) demonstrated clear differences in the distribution and both macroscopic and histological types of adenomas and adenocarcinomas between three different inbred strains of rat given a similar dosage regimen of 1,2-dimethylhydrazine. In general, many of these carcinomas develop in the distal colonic segments similar to the distribution of human colorectal cancer, although tumours also develop in the proximal colon and in the ileum in rats treated with this agent (Ward, 1974; Teague et al., 1981) .",

However, in these models adenomas and adenocarcinomas also occur in the caecum and proximal colon and squamous carcinomas are sometimes seen in association with squamous metaplasia at the colorectal junction (Oohashi et al., 1981) . The pathogenesis of neoplasms induced by carrageenans and dextrans remains unexplained. Although they are biologically active compounds, they are non-mutagenic in the usual short-term tests (Ishioka et al., 1987) . It has been suggested that carrageenans act as tumour promoters as they potentiate the appearance of carcinomas in rats treated with standard intestinal carcinogens Hirono et al., 1981) . Conversely it has been proposed that these agents are tumour initiators based on the development of carcinomas in rats treated with degraded carrageenans for only 2 months (Oohashi et al., 1981) . However, despite only a short period of treatment, inflammation, regenerative changes and squamous metaplasia persisted throughout a period of 18 months after treatment was withdrawn before development of cancer in these rats.",
