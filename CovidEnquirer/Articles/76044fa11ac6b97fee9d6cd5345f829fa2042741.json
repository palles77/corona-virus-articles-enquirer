Discussion of laboratory methodology, including morphologic identification of parasites and pathogens is beyond the scope of this article. Veterinary reference textbooks are available for this purpose. 1, [6] [7] [8] Fecal Cytology (Wet Mount) Fecal wet mounts are particularly helpful for identification of motile organisms. Because of the small sample used, the sensitivity of this method is low for most other parasites. Protozoal trophozoites such as Giardia, trichomonads, and amoebae may be identified, as well as motile nematode larvae (eg, Strongyloides sp). Motile bacteria, such as Campylobacter, may be easier to detect on wet mounts than on dry mounts. 1 It is necessary to be familiar with the nonpathogenic motile flora of feces. Motile treponeme-like spirochetes are often seen on wet mounts. They are stiff, corkscrew-shaped, forwardly motile organisms (Fig 1) . Increased numbers are often noted with diarrhea or on fecal samples obtained by rectal lavage. They are not considered pathogenic. Increased numbers are usually a result of diarrhea or sampling methods (see Spirochetal Diarrhea section). 9 Trichomonads, such as Pentatrichomonas hominis, are generally considered nonpathogenic in dogs. However, disease associated with Tritrichomonas foetus has been described in cats (see Trichomoniasis section) (Fig 2) . 10 Direct smears should be performed on fresh feces, ideally less than 5-minutes old. 1,3,10 Use warm or room temperature physiologic saline. For solid feces, place a very small sample into a drop of saline on the slide, and mix with a wooden applicator stick. For samples obtained by rectal lavage, simply place a drop of the lavage fluid on the slide. Place a cover glass over the drop. The wet mount should be thin enough to read newsprint through it. Too much feces will make a dense mixture that cannot be assessed. When examining the slide, adjust the contrast to see the minute aspects of the specimen. 1 Scan the entire slide at low magnification (ie, 10\u03eb) for eggs, cysts, and larvae. Trophozoites are generally identified at 20\u03eb and 40\u03eb magnification, while motile bacteria may be assessed 100x under oil emersion. 1 After initial examination, iodine may be wicked under an edge of the cover glass to stain organisms. Iodine will kill motile organisms but may aid in their identification. Motile organisms seen on wet mount can often be structurally assessed on stained, dry mount slides. 1 Wet mount slides should not be sent to pathologists because they will rapidly dry and become unreadable. Instead, send dry mounts with a clear description of your findings on the wet mount. 5 Fecal Cytology (Dry Mount) Dry mounts are particularly useful for identification of cellular infiltrates and assessing the bacterial flora. Increased numbers of neutrophils (Fig 3) can be a sign of bacterial enteritis. The absence of fecal neutrophils in a puppy with hemorrhagic diarrhea may be a sign of viral enteritis. Increased numbers of clostridial spores or yeast may be a sign of overgrowth. 9 Pathogenic spiral bacteria, such as Campylobacter, may be identified (Fig 4) . Rarely, coccidial merozoites or other protozoal trophozoites are seen. 1 It is important to be familiar with the microscopic appear- ance of normal flora. Not all spores are Clostridium perfringens (Fig. 5) , and not all spiral bacteria are Campylobacter. 9 At least 2 forms of spirochetes, treponeme-like organisms and Serpulina-like organisms, may be confused with Campylobacter on dry mounts (Figs 1, 4, and 6 ). The pitfalls of identification of these organisms are addressed later (see Campylobacteriosis, Clostridial Colitis, Spirochetal Diarrhea sections). 9 The diagnostic quality of dry mounts is dependent on optimal sample handling and slide preparation, especially when assessing cellular infiltrates. Prepare the slide with a very small amount of fresh feces. It is a common mistake to make fecal smears too thick. Thick areas do not stain well and tend to fall off during processing. Solid feces should be mixed with saline, as discussed in \"Wet Mounts\" section, or a drop of rectal lavage fluid may be placed directly on the slide. 1, 5 The sample should be spread thinly and evenly across the slide, using the same smearing technique as preparing blood smears. The slide should be air-dried, not heat fixed, to preserve cellular mor-phology. Stain the slide with wright-Giemsa or Diff-Quik (Hamilton Thorne Biosciences, Beverly, MA). If necessary, a portable hair dryer can be used to speed the drying process. 5 Scan the entire slide at low magnification. Cellular morphology and bacteria are best assessed at 100\u03eb magnification under oil. Consider special stains based on initial fecal cytology and the clinical presentation. For better bacterial morphology, consider Gram stain. If there is a clinical suspicion of cryptosporidiosis, consider acid-fast stain. Slides that are to be preserved for later reexamination may be fixed with methanol for later staining or processed with a fixative stain, such as merthiolate iodine-formalin. 1, 5 When sending fecal cytology to a pathologist, consider the following recommendations:",

            "text": "Fecal flotation is the optimal procedure for diagnosis of most, but not all, intestinal parasites. Flotation techniques take advantage of the fact that parasite ova and cysts can be separated from other fecal debris due to differences in density. Eggs, oocysts, and larvae are usually less dense than flotation solutions, and, therefore, will rise to the surface of the mixture. This method of concentrating parasites allows a larger, more representative sample of feces to be assessed. 2 The efficiency of fecal flotation is dependent on the quality of the sample, type of solution, the specific gravity, and the timing of the procedure. 1 Several techniques for fecal flotation are described and used in clinical practice. Techniques vary based on the type of flotation solution and the method of concentration (ie, standing or centrifugal). Solutions used for flotation include sugar (Sheather solution), magnesium sulfate (35%), zinc sulfate (33%), and sodium chloride. 1,2 Sugar solution is considered ideal for isolation of most eggs and oocysts. It has the advantage of not crystallizing and can, therefore, be assessed for a longer period. Sugar solution also will not distort most helminth eggs and oocysts. However, sugar solutions tend to distort Giardia, other protozoal cysts, and some lungworm larvae. Zinc sulfate is considered ideal for the isolation of Giardia cysts but will distort most helminth eggs. Flotation solutions must be maintained at the proper specific gravity to be effective. 1, 2 Centrifugal flotation methods reduce the time that it takes for eggs to float to the surface. This is particularly important with sugar solutions, which have higher viscosity and would require longer standing time. When using standing flotation methods, it is best to use a salt solution (ie, zinc sulfate or sodium nitrate), and let the preparation stand at least 10 to 15 minutes. Adequate flotation time is essential. 1 Centrifugal flotation using the Sheather sugar method is the gold standard of veterinary parasitology and is strongly recommended for routine use in practice. This is the most effective method of isolating most helminth eggs and coccidial oocysts. 1 Centrifugal flotation using zinc sulfate is considered ideal for the isolation of Giardia cysts. 1, 2 Fecal flotation should be performed on 1 to 2 g of fresh feces. Fecal samples submitted to laboratories should be stored at 2\u00b0t o 8\u00b0C and shipped on ice within 24 hours. Formalin fixation can preserve fecal samples for flotation for longer periods. 1 Fecal Sedimentation Sedimentation techniques are used for the detection of fluke eggs and embryonated nematode eggs, such as Physaloptera spp and Spirocerca lupi. Fluke eggs and embryonated nematode eggs are more dense, and do not float on standard flotation media. Sedimentation solutions include water, soap-in-water, or saline. Use saline for sedimentation of fluke eggs because they tend to hatch in water. 1 Sedimentation methods may be centrifugal or standing. As with fecal flotation, centrifugal techniques decrease the required time for sedimentation. Fecal sedimentation should be performed on 1 to 2 g of fresh feces. Fecal OPTIMAL FECAL ASSESSMENT samples submitted to laboratories should be stored at 2\u00b0to 8\u00b0C and shipped on ice within 24 hours. 1, 4 Baermann Funnel Preparation This is a method for isolation of nematode larvae from fecal specimens. It is best suited for isolation of active lungworm larvae (ie, Aelurostrongylus and Filaroides) and small intestinal larvae (ie, Strongyloides). The eggs of hookworms (ie, Ancylostoma and Uncinaria) can hatch in fresh fecal samples, yielding active larvae. 1,2 Some lungworms, Capillaria sp, are more readily diagnosed on fecal floatation. Lung flukes are more readily identified on fecal sedimentation. 11 For this reason, fecal assessment for pulmonary disease may include the Baermann technique, as well as floatation and sedimentation techniques. Baermann funnel preparation must be performed on fresh feces, and 5 to 10 g of feces are required. Samples submit-ted to laboratories should be stored at 2\u00b0to 8\u00b0C and shipped on ice within 24 hours. 1, 4 Bacterial Culture Primary bacterial gastroenteritis occasionally occurs in dogs and cats. Salmonella spp, Campylobacter spp, C perfringens, and Escherichia coli are important genera. 3 Because latent carriers of enteric pathogens are common, the diagnosis of bacterial enteritis must be based on clinical presentation as well as organism isolation. 12 Positive cultures for enteric pathogens are commonly reported in normal dogs with C perfringens, Salmonella spp, or Campylobacter jejuni. 3, 12, 13 If possible, collect 2 to 5 g of fresh feces from the rectum. If a voided sample is used, avoid contamination with urine or soil.",

They also are used to maintain the viability of fastidious organisms such as Campylobacter. 4 Because enteric pathogens have special culture requirements, always request a fecal culture panel or notify the laboratory of suspected pathogens. Standard culture procedures are not useful for fecal assessment. 3, 4 Semiquantitative and Quantitative Fecal Fat Semiquantitative fecal fat analysis is an easily performed, inexpensive screening test used to detect fat malabsorption (positive for digested fat) or maldigestion (positive for undigested fat). It does occasionally yield misleading results. Quantitative fat analysis is labor intensive. It requires a dietary prescription for 3 days followed by collection of all feces for 24 to 72 hours. Feces are refrigerated or frozen while awaiting analysis. The entire collection of feces is submitted to the laboratory. This test is rarely performed in veterinary medicine. 3, 4 A moderate-to-high fat diet is necessary to assess fecal fat. Feeding low-fat diets may cause the test to be negative. 3 Samples must be submitted in a container free of fat, wax, or soap. For semiquantitative analysis, submit 1 to 2 g of fresh feces, stored at 2\u00b0to 8\u00b0C, and shipped on ice within 24 hours. 4 Fecal Tests for Maldigestion Fecal starch, fecal muscle fibers, and fecal proteolytic activity (fecal trypsin) are tests for maldigestion. These tests offer no advantage over serum trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLI) in the diagnosis of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) and lack specificity. For this reason, they have largely been replaced by serum TLI and are not recommended. 3 ",

Samples should be refrigerated and delivered to the laboratory on ice for processing within 24 hours. 4 Isolation of this fragile and fastidious organism requires special culture media (Campy blood agar) and incubation in a microaerophilic atmosphere. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests should be performed on positive cultures. Isolation of the organism in itself does not necessarily mean the patient has campylobacteriosis. Positive culture should be interpreted based on the clinical presentation, results of other diagnostic tests, and response to antimicrobial therapy. 12 Public Health Significance. C jejuni is an important cause of gastroenteritis in infants, children, and adults. Potential sources of this organism for humans include poultry and a number of animals, including dogs and cats. Owners of pets with clinical disease should be advised to exercise appropriate hygienic measures to prevent possible exposure to C jejuni.

Pathogenic E coli has been implicated in acute diarrhea in puppies, and may play a role in hemorrhagic gastroenteritis (HGE) and chronic enteritis in adult dogs. 11, 14 Diagnostic Indications.

Historically, they are considered nonpathogenic, and increased numbers have been considered a result and not a cause of disease. They are believed to inhabit the crypts of the colon and get mechanically dislodged during periods of diarrhea. Also, changes in the flora may occur secondary to diarrhea. 14, 20 The most commonly identified spirochetes in diarrheic feces are motile treponeme-like organisms, which are not considered pathogens. They are rapidly motile, stiff, \"cork-screw\" like bacteria that dart across the field on wet mount cytology. On dry mount cytology, they show several complete convolutions and are 4 to 18 m in length (Fig 1) . 23 On fecal cytology, it is important to differentiate nonpathogenic treponeme-like organisms from other potentially pathogenic motile spiral bacteria (eg, Campylobacter and Serpulina) (Figs 4 and 6) . Recently, there has been growing evidence that some large bowel spirochetes may cause enteritis. 24, 25 Most investigation has focused on Serpulina pilosicoli (Brachyspira pilosicoli). [24] [25] [26] [27] Etiology and Occurrence. S pilosicoli is thought to cause colonic disease in human beings, nonhuman primates, dogs, pigs, and birds. The disease is characterized by colonization of the surface and crypt mucin, and intimate attachment of the spirochetes to the apical membrane of cecal and colonic enterocytes. Diarrhea associated with S pilosicoli has been described in children and immunocompromised adults. It has also been observed in puppies with diarrhea. [24] [25] [26] [27] Several species of the genus Serpulina are found in animals that do not show virulence factors. Serpulina canis, which has been isolated from dogs, has not been associated with disease. 24 Clinical Signs. Severe diarrhea has been described in puppies with S pilosicoli. In humans, it occurs as a subclinical disease in mature immunocompetent hosts. Diarrhea may be associated with either massive infection, which occurs in a poor hygienic environment, or compromised intestinal function because of concurrent disease. 24 Diagnostic Indications. (1) Acute diarrhea, (2) young animals, (3) kennels, and (4) immune compromise.",

They are difficult to see on wet mount cytology, but, in large numbers, you can recognize their rapid whipping motion. They can also be identified on dry-mount cytology (Fig 6) . 9 Because not all Serpulina spp are pathogenic, diagnosis requires identification of typical organisms on cytology, a consistent clinical presentation, and elimination of other possible etiologies. 24 It is important to differentiate Serpulina spp from motile treponemelike spirochetes. S pilosicoli may be identified by ELISA and PCR methods in research settings. 24 Complete response to antibacterial therapy within 2 to 3 days may support the diagnosis. 9 Enteric Fungi Low numbers of fungi are part of the normal intestinal flora. Overgrowth of yeasts, such as Candida sp, may occur when antibiotics alter the normal intestinal flora. Mucosal invasion and systemic spread may occur with severe immunosuppression. 20 Viral Enteritis Viral enteritis induced by Parvovirus or Coronavirus is suspected in animals with fever and small bowel diarrhea, particularly if neutropenia is present. The diagnosis of Parvovirus is usually made by detection of fecal shedding of viral antigen. Fecal ELISA tests are available, which accurately detect shedding of Parvovirus in acute cases. The specificity of the assay is good, but it cannot differentiate vaccine strains of Parvovirus from virulent strains. This leads to false-positive tests after vaccination. False-negative reactions can occur. 3 These assays may also detect feline Parvovirus. 14 Virus isolation or electron microscopy is required to identify canine or feline Coronavirus in feces. 3, 14 ",
