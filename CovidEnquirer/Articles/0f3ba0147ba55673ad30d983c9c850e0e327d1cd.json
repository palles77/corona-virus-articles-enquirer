In the late 1990s, when a new vaccine was being developed, a system was needed to determine baseline rates of IPD, evaluate vaccine effectiveness, and monitor circulating serotypes. After establishment of ABCs to fill the void of tracking the disease burden of IPD and other major causes of invasive bacterial disease in the United States, ABCs detected a large reduction in IPD detected among children <5 years of age (for whom vaccination with 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine [PCV7] was recommended in 2000) and among adults, who benefited from herd protection. ABCs also recognized an increase in IPD rates caused by S. pneumoniae serotypes absent from PCV7; this information resulted in accelerated approval of a 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13) that has resulted in further reductions in IPD.",

Additionally, epidemiologic data collected by health departments are often incomplete because of limited resources and the inflexibility of the system to capture variables of interest. Unlike the National Notifiable Disease Surveillance System, ABCs also collects isolates and serotypes and tests them for antimicrobial drug susceptibility. These attributes enable ABCs to fulfill 2 critical objectives: 1) to determine the incidence and epidemiologic characteristics of invasive diseases under surveillance and 2) to determine molecular epidemiologic patterns and microbiological characteristics of these invasive infections.",

Since 1995, with the exception of MRSA (for which a convenience sample of 100 isolates has been collected since 2005), \u224885% of isolates have been collected from eligible patients. Isolates undergo serologic or molecular typing and standardized antimicrobial drug susceptibility testing at CDC or other reference laboratories. A collection of \u224880,000 S. pneumoniae, GAS, GBS, N. meningitides, and H. influenzae isolates is accessible to ABCs partners and external researchers by request (http://www.cdc.gov/abcs/pathogens/isolatebank/index. html). ABCs MRSA isolates are deposited at the Network on Antimicrobial Resistance in Staphylococcus aureus, a repository sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health (http://www.niaid.nih.gov/labsandresources/resources/ dmid/narsa/Pages/default.aspx).",

Without evidence as to which strategy was better, the 1996 guidelines recommended that health care providers could use either a screening or risk-based approach to decide which women should receive prophylaxis during delivery. An ABCs-based cohort study that sampled from a population of \u2248600,000 live-born infants at 8 sites demonstrated the value of screening over the riskbased approach. Specifically, universal prenatal screening of pregnant women for vaginal/rectal colonization with GBS and providing antimicrobial drugs during delivery to those who were colonized was \u224850% more effective at preventing early onset GBS than providing prophylaxis to pregnant women on the basis of certain risk factors (8) . This finding led to issuance of new guidelines in 2002 (9) and revised guidelines in 2010 (10) , which resulted in further reductions in disease. Since the early 1990s, ABCs has documented a >80% decline in the incidence of early-onset GBS infection and prevention of an estimated 70,000 cases of early-onset GBS infection (Figure 3) .",

Most (\u224884%) infections were health care-associated-either hospital-onset (culture obtained >3 days after admission) or health care-associated community-onset (culture obtained from outpatient or within 3 calendar days after admission from a patient with a health care-associated risk factor, which include presence of a central venous catheter within 2 days before MRSA culture or history of surgery, hospitalization, dialysis, or residence of longterm care facility in the 12 months preceding culture date). The prominence of health care-associated community-onset infections was newly brought to light by the ABCs network (16) . This report led to increased awareness of MRSA infections, and prevention of health care-associated MRSA became a goal for public health agencies and policy makers (17-19). ABCs documented a 54% decline in hospitalonset MRSA and a 28% decline in health care-associated community-onset MRSA invasive infections during 2005-2011 ( Figure 4) (20) . An ABCs-based study evaluating risk factors for health care-associated community-onset MRSA infections has just been completed.

After the 2001 anthrax attack, the ABCs infrastructure was used to establish and test a more sensitive and timely system for identifying inhalation anthrax in Connecticut (28) . After the discovery of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2002, the EIP infrastructure assisted with surveillance activities and the investigation of suspected cases (29) . During the 2009 influenza A(H1N1) pandemic, early recognition of IPD among pandemic influenza patients at the Colorado ABCs site led to increased emphasis on pneumococcal disease prevention strategies (30) . The Tennessee ABCs site helped the Tennessee Department of Health investigate the recent outbreak of fungal meningitis (31) . ABCs has also been used as a surveillance platform for other emerging infections, including pertussis and legionellosis. Since the 1980s, the number of reported pertussis cases has been gradually increasing: the 48,277 cases reported in 2012 represent the largest number of cases since 1955 ( Figure 5 ) (http://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/downloads/ pertuss-surv-report-2012.pdf). From 2000 through 2009, the age-adjusted incidence of legionellosis has almost tripled, from 0.40 to 1.08 cases per 100,000 persons (4). Since 2011, enhanced pertussis surveillance has been conducted at 6 sites and legionellosis surveillance at 10 sites. In addition to enhanced surveillance, a study to estimate the effectiveness of maternal vaccination at preventing infant pertussis is under way.",

The collection of isolates in conjunction with epidemiologic data has contributed to the microbiological and molecular characterization of pathogens, which has played a part in the development of vaccines and monitoring of antimicrobial drug resistance. Although the surveillance system alone provides powerful data for informing public health actions, the large ABCs infrastructure provides an efficient and effective platform for engaging in special investigations that would otherwise require additional resources. The infrastructure also provides the flexibility needed to respond to emergencies and to serve as a surveillance platform for other emerging pathogens. Perhaps the greatest strength of ABCs and the reason for its success have been the committed, genial, and long-lasting collaboration among local, state, and federal agencies, academic institutions, and clinical laboratories.",

Are there interventions to reduce infant late-onset disease? Group A Streptococcus What age groups should be targeted for vaccines according to potential effect on invasive disease?
