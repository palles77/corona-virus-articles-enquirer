            "text": "The Institute of Medicine (IOM) in its 1995 report presented an analysis of the FDA and its Directorates, and concluded that there needed to be a \"far more responsive and integrated process to ensure blood safety\" [4] . They recommended the creation of a \"Blood Safety Council\" to assess and propose strategies for overcoming current and potential future threats to the blood supply and to educate public health officials, clinicians, and the public about challenges to blood safety and strategies for dealing with these challenges. They suggested that the Council could also alert scientists about the needs and opportunities for research to maximize the safety of blood and blood products. These IOM proposals were never implemented, but given the recent epidemics of previously exotic contagious diseases such as Ebola and Dengue hemorrhagic fever, and the emergence of SARS and MERS (severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome, respectively), establishing an office to safeguard the blood supply would seem to be even more urgent now than when they proposed it in 1995. Blood banks do not currently test donors for these viruses, so there is the possibility that these organisms could be transmitted by transfusion. An even greater risk to the blood supply of the United States is the Chikungunya virus, which appeared in the Caribbean basin in December 2013. This virus causes fever and joint pains and has already infected approximately 15,000 persons. A group of French investigators screened plasma samples from 2149 blood donors from Martinique to find out if this virus is capable of gaining entrance to the blood supply [5] . The Chikungunya virus was found in the blood of four men; two never had symptoms of infection and the other two had fevers that began soon after their donations. Had their blood been used for the preparation of clotting factor concentrates or transfused into patients, it could have transmitted the virus to the recipients. This experience clearly shows that our blood supply remains vulnerable and requires continuous surveillance for new sources of contamination. 1 Because people with hemophilia are major consumers of blood products, the Medical and Scientific Advisory Council (MASAC) of the National Hemophilia Foundation (NHF) has submitted to the FDA a number of recommendations for improving the quality of the plasma used for preparing clotting factor concentrates [6] . Among these are suggestions that the plasma pool size should be limited to 15,000 donors, very sensitive tests should be used to detect viral contamination, and improved techniques should be implemented for eliminating infectious agents. In addition, NHF requests that manufacturers should promptly report suspected infections associated with their products; any such products should be assumed to be implicated in disease transmission and removed from the distribution path and patients' homes. Another recommendation is that the FDA should communicate promptly with consumer organizations such as NHF whenever there is a recall or voluntary withdrawal, because these actions could have an impact on the supply and availability of clotting factor concentrates. They also suggest using bar-coding to identify coagulation products; adopting this method would facilitate accurate tracking and dispensing, as well as usage in the hospital and at home. Furthermore, NHF urges that expedited regulatory review should be extended to all products offering incremental safety and efficacy advantages. On December 2, 2014, the FDA announced that it intended to establish a general program to monitor the safety of the blood supply in collaboration with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. In addition, the FDA plans to engage in public discussions about the donation of safe blood and to review the effectiveness of the blood donor history questionnaire. Although these actions are commendable, I believe that the FDA needs to have an office specifically devoted to safeguarding blood safety.",

As noted, these concentrates are vital for the well-being of persons with bleeding disorders, which is why they maintain a supply of these products in their home or office. However, there are times when hemophiliacs have hemorrhages while traveling for business or pleasure. A visit to the nearest emergency department often brings the unwelcome news that the facility does not stock clotting factor concentrates. Surprisingly, even trauma centers designated level I (most capabilities) might not have coagulation products. Such facilities must either call a distribution center and request immediate delivery of the concentrate or transfer the bleeding patient to a treatment center that has the appropriate material. The lack of immediate accessibility to clotting factor creates delays in the provision of care, and the bleeding that continues unabated exacerbates the damage in whatever organ has been the site of the hemorrhage, be it the brain, joint, or other tissue. The OBPS might mandate that adequate supplies of clotting factor concentrate must be physically present in all level I trauma centers and other facilities that serve communities where persons with hemophilia and other bleeding disorders reside.",

However, the recipients of blood must pay a steep price for transfusions. While the cost to hospitals to purchase a unit of blood is usually $225-240, patients might be charged $1000 or more [7] ; this is often loosely justified by claiming expenses for blood administration, inventory losses, and liability insurance, although formal cost-accounting is rarely available. 2 The monies collected for blood have made blood banking a multibillion-dollar enterprise, often generating large annual surpluses [8] .",

Utah system is trying to learn. NY Times September 8, 2015, pp. A1, A18). A more enlightened system would have the costs of collecting, processing, and administering blood borne by the general public, and the prices for blood and blood products regulated by the government. Controlling the costs of transfusion and spreading the expense over the entire population would ease the financial burden on those who are ill and least able to afford this expense. Such a paradigm has been adopted by many other countries and should be incorporated into our health care system. Most other developed countries provide free care and supplies for people with chronic diseases, reasoning that diseases select their targets at random [9] . Also, they negotiate with drug and device makers to reduce list prices. For example, the British National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) is charged with assisting health and social care professionals by providing guidance on delivery of the best possible care based on the available evidence [10] . NICE conducts technology appraisals, publishes clinical guidelines, and performs cost-effectiveness analyses. It utilizes the quality-adjusted life year to measure health benefits; if the benefit is less than a designated threshold for the cost of a new drug or procedure, then the treatment is not recommended. Once the value of a therapy is established, NICE negotiates price with the manufacturer. The costs of drugs in the United States are higher because most other countries apply price controls and we do not; we rely on a competitive marketplace, but the fact is that many pharmaceutical products do not have competitors.",

Sometimes, drugs with significant advantages over their competitors are more expensive, or there are no competing products; in this situation, the health plan might decide that the products are too expensive and refuse to list them on its formulary. If patients wish to have such drugs, they are obliged to pay their full price out-of-pocket. This creates a double standard of care, with wealthy individuals and those with expensive insurance policies getting top-of-the-line products and others receiving only older, lower-quality material. Recently, in response to a complaint that people with HIV were subjected to restrictions on certain medications, an insurer agreed to limit the out-of-pocket costs for some of these agents [12] , but this action was taken by only one company in one state. Two members of the US House of Representatives have introduced a bill (H.R.1600) to prevent private health insurance plans from imposing higher premiums for specialty drugs, but the fate of this legislation is uncertain.",

There is no marketplace or competition to determine the cost of many such drugs; their price is set by the manufacturers and health insurers. For the manufacturers, the considerations used to determine prices are return on investment and willingness of third parties (insurance, government) to accept the costs of the drugs (in other words, what the market will bear). Health insurers can assign some drugs, such as those used to treat HIV infection, to the highest payment tier for midlevel plans, requiring patients to contribute 40% of the cost of the drug [16] . Sick individuals are compelled to assume a heavy monetary burden at a time when their income is often substantially decreased by illness. There are few remedies for patients when insurance companies charge hefty premiums for vital medications. In addition, our government does not negotiate price with pharmaceutical companies; if fact, such negotiations were barred by Congress when Part D Medicare was enacted. As noted by Elizabeth Rosenthal, \"we approve drugs and devices without considering cost-effectiveness, or even having a clue about price.

Furthermore, pharmaceutical companies have little incentive for developing new classes of antibiotics, mainly because the monetary returns from such drugs are small in comparison to medicines used for chronic diseases such as cancer and diabetes. However, we desperately need new antimicrobials because of the emergence of bacteria resistant to the current drugs [20] . Vaccine production is another area frequently neglected by pharmaceutical companies because of a perceived lack of profitability. Margaret Chan, Director General of the WHO, criticized the drug industry for not developing an Ebola vaccine in advance of the current crisis. She said \"A profit-driven industry does not invest in products for markets that cannot pay\" [21] . Although the government has been encouraging antibiotic research by making funds available for drug development, and although Congress is considering legislation that would increase the levels of Medicare reimbursement for newer antibiotics [16] , COPP could provide more immediate financial incentives for manufacturers to discover and produce novel antibiotics and vaccines.

Likewise, medical experts advising the NHF were unaware that HIV infection had been fatal in almost half of those exposed to the virus and would be much worse than an untreated hemorrhage. Had these groups been better informed about what was happening in the homosexual community, they could have taken measures to limit the entrance of the virus into the blood supply and restricted the use of clotting factor concentrate, the product that infected the hemophilia community.",

This occurred because AIDS was identified by many as a \"gay\" disease, and discrimination against homosexuals was rampant in the small town in Indiana where he grew up. White and his family rejected the idea that he was an innocent victim, because that implied that gays with AIDS were guilty. In fact, gay men gave blood altruistically and were unaware that they were infected by HIV when they donated. White understood that AIDS was a disease, not a way of life, and he and his family were grateful for the assistance and advice they received from the gay community [23] . White was a strong proponent of education and research, noting that he faced discrimination, fear, and panic but became accepted when students and parents understood the facts of his illness.",

But isolated outbreaks of the disease still occur in nonhemophiliacs. A recent epidemic in rural Indiana illustrates how the sharing of contaminated needles disseminates HIV among people who abuse drugs [24] . In this poor community, marked by abandoned homes and widespread unemployment, many individuals became addicted to an opioid painkiller called Opana (Endo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Malvern, PA). Although this drug is meant to be taken orally, addicts crushed the pills in water and injected the slurry intravenously. They reused needles hundreds of times and shared needles with other drug abusers. HIV infection was first recognized in January 2014; there were 71 cases by December and 135 by April 2015 [25] . The transmission rate was estimated at 80%, meaning that infection occurred in 8 of every 10 individuals sharing needles with an infected person [26] . Other factors that might have contributed to the size of the epidemic are the misperception that only homosexuals could become infected by HIV and the general reluctance to undergo testing and treatment because of the stigma attached to the disease [27] . To overcome these barriers, Indiana officials instituted a program of needle exchange, offered free HIV testing, and provided clinic facilities for treatment. It is still unclear whether these measures will be effective in limiting this outbreak.",

When we observe persons afflicted with disease, we need to support them and take active measures to relieve their suffering. This concern for the rights of those with AIDS was probably best expressed by Nelson Mandela, who vigorously fought against stigmatization and discrimination of infected persons [28] . We do not know who will be vulnerable to the next invasion by an infectious agent, but we must not let prejudice and irrational thinking prevent us from doing everything possible to identify and eradicate the contagion, no matter who is infected. Study of the AIDS epidemic in hemophiliacs is relevant because it shows that failure to adequately address diseases in minority populations inflicts a high cost on society as a whole; for example, it provides a convincing rationale for investing resources to control Ebola in West Africa before it is disseminated globally.",

However, recent research has produced several novel antibodies that are able to neutralize diverse strains of HIV [36] . In addition to assisting in the design of a vaccine, some of these antibodies also target the cells harboring the virus. These cells are the factories for viral synthesis and their elimination might have a long-term beneficial effect on the treatment of the infection. Other investigators are trying to determine why some patients have a natural resistance to HIV infection, and they have discovered that genetic mutations in certain cell membrane proteins thwart the virus from entering those cells.
