Thirteen patients were present in the Alzheimer disease unit at the time of the epidemic and all had an individual bedroom. The mean age was 89 years (range 79-101 years); eight of the 13 patients had an underlying disease: one had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and seven had cardiovascular disease. Of the 13 patients, seven required help to move and six were bedridden. Interactions between patients occurred only in the living room, where each patient had a predefined seat. Bedridden patients spent the shortest time in the living room because it was strictly limited to lunch time. The other patients could carry out other activities in the living room besides eating lunch. Hence there was prolonged contact in the living room mainly for these patients.",

During the evening, medical staff noticed that an additional patient was starting to cough. All the patients developed only mild respiratory symptoms, no complications were described.

Samples from two of the patients tested positive with a commercial real-time PCR (MWS r-gene\u2122 respiratory panel; BioM\u00e9rieux) that detects both rhinovirus and enterovirus and negative with other PCRs. The sample from the third patient was negative for all PCRs. The two positive samples were next transferred to the National Reference Centre for Enteroviruses for further characterization. EV-D68 infection was confirmed for the two patients by a recently implemented specific real-time RT-PCR [3] . Sequencing of the complete VP1 of the two EV-68-positive specimens was performed. The two sequences were 100% identical, belonged to clade B, and were similar to those viruses currently circulating in the USA and France [4] (Fig. 1) .",

Afterwards, no healthcare workers recalled having respiratory symptoms the week before the outbreak but we cannot exclude this hypothesis as EV-D68 asymptomatic cases have been reported in adults. However, despite the fact that healthcare workers work in three different units, the outbreak was limited to only one unit, which suggests that they were unlikely to have been involved in transmission to the secondary cases. This transmission was more likely a patient-to-patient transmission in the living room. Indeed, the seven confirmed or probable cases had prolonged contact in this room, no cases were reported after its closure and the incubation period is considered to be short (median: 1.9 days; 95% CI 1.4-2.4 days) [1] .",
