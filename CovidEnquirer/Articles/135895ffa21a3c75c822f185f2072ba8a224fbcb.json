            "text": "Total internal reflection microscopy combined with microfluidics and supported bilayers is a powerful, single particle tracking (SPT) platform for host-pathogen membrane fusion studies. But one major inadequacy of this platform has been capturing the complexity of the cell membrane, including membrane proteins. Because of this, viruses requiring proteinaceous receptors, or other unknown cellular co-factors, have been precluded from study. Here we describe a general method to integrate proteinaceous receptors and cellular components into supported bilayers for SPT fusion studies. This method is general to any enveloped virus-host cell pair, but demonstrated here for feline coronavirus (FCoV). Supported bilayers are formed from mammalian cell membrane vesicles that express feline aminopeptidase N (the viral receptor) using a cell blebbing technique. SPT is then used to identify fusion intermediates and measure membrane fusion kinetics for FCoV. Overall, the fusion results recapitulate what is observed in vivo, that coronavirus entry requires binding to specific receptors, a low-pH environment, and that membrane fusion is receptorand protease-dependent. But this method also provides quantitative kinetic rate parameters for intermediate steps in the coronavirus fusion pathway, which to our knowledge have not been obtained before. Moreover, the platform offers versatile, precise control over the sequence of triggers for fusion; these triggers may define the fusion pathway, tissue tropism, and pathogenicity of coronaviruses. Systematically varying these triggers in this platform provides a new route to study how viruses rapidly adapt to other hosts, and to identify factors that led to the emergence of zoonotic viruses, such as human SARS-CoV and the newly emerging human MERS-CoV.",

It is not well-understood how these viruses adapt to new hosts, yet they are an increasing concern as a source of emerging viruses for the human population, including SARS-CoV and the newly emerging MERS-CoV [1e3]. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV produce fatal disease in the majority of people who contract the infection. Quantitative studies of the entry process of the virus are therefore necessary for understanding the cues that mitigate host adaptation and for developing strategies to prevent infection. But accurately establishing the impact of various triggers on membrane fusion requires experimental techniques capable of quantifying fusion kinetics to characterize the fusion intermediates, the kinetic rate constants for transitional steps, and the fusion pathway.",

            "text": "A relatively new approach for quantitatively studying viral entry kinetics is single particle imaging using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) [4] . TIRFM requires that a supported lipid bilayer (SLB) containing viral receptors is located within 100 nm of an evanescent wave produced by total internal reflection at the interface between two dissimilar materials. This requirement is easily achieved by coating the walls of a glass microfluidic channel with an SLB. SLBs preserve many properties of the cell membrane, like chemical tunability, lipid diversity, and mobility of its constituents in a planar geometry, but without the experimental complications imposed by live cells. However, a significant limitation of this platform has been capturing the complexity of cell membranes, especially the incorporation of membrane proteins. This limitation has precluded studies of viruses that use proteinaceous receptors (like coronaviruses) to date. As such, these platforms have been limited to the study of a few viruses, such as influenza virus [5e7], Sindbis virus [8] , and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) [9] , because these viruses have either known glycolipid receptors or are known to interact with specific lipids that are easily incorporated into SLBs. Herein we describe a method to integrate the proteinaceous receptor for feline alphacoronavirus WSU 79-1683 (referred to here as FCoV) into a supported bilayer and measure membrane fusion kinetics using single particle tracking. Importantly, this new method of forming proteinaceous supported bilayers for virus fusion studies opens single particle fusion assays to any enveloped virus that binds to proteinaceous receptors.",

            "text": "To initiate infection, coronaviruses typically engage specific proteinaceous receptors on the surface of host cells. The specificity of receptor binding is believed to be one of the key factors in the host range of a given coronavirus [10] . One of the best-characterized receptors is aminopeptidase N (APN), which is utilized by the majority of coronaviruses in the alphacoronavirus genus [11e13] . Baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells are transfected with the feline aminopeptidase N (fAPN) and encapsulated into vesicles using a cell blebbing technique [14e18] . These vesicles are then used to form proteinaceous supported bilayers to which coronavirus can fuse and be observed at the single particle level using TIRF microscopy. This method for creating proteoliposomes is in contrast to the usual approach to incorporate membrane proteins into vesicles, where proteins are reconstituted into proteoliposomes using detergent. Detergents solubilize the proteins out of the cell membrane and can result in loss of native conformation of the proteins. For pathogenesis, the conformation of proteins in the membrane and its glycosylation are critical to controlling the host-pathogen interaction. We show here that fAPN in the supported bilayer made from blebs is enzymatically active, oriented properly, and competent to bind FCoV prior to membrane fusion.",

            "text": "Like influenza virus, many coronaviruses can use the endocytic pathway to enter cells [19] . Once inside the endosome, the challenge for viruses is delivering their genetic material across the membrane and into the cytosol for viral replication. All enveloped viruses have membrane proteins that facilitate the fusion of their lipid envelope with the host cell membrane [20] . Coronavirus particles possess at their surface the spike (S) envelope glycoprotein, which is a class I fusion protein [21] . Whereas the structure and function of the prototypical class I fusion protein, influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA), is well understood, structureefunction relationships for coronavirus S proteins are not well characterized. For coronaviruses, the S protein mediates virus entry and determines cell tropism and pathogenesis [22] . Like influenza virus HA, the coronavirus S protein has two primary functions: 1) it controls the binding of the virus to a cell membrane receptor, and 2) it mediates membrane fusion between the viral and host membranes [20] . In general, receptor binding is controlled by the S1 domain of the protein, while membrane fusion is mediated by the S2 domain. A conformational change in the S2 domain is believed to drive the viral membrane to fuse with the host membrane. For most coronaviruses, this conformational change is triggered by the acidification of the endosome, although pH-independent fusion can also be observed.",

Class I fusion proteins go through a multi-step process to achieve a fusion pore that begins with a fusion protein conformational change triggered by low pH. During the conformational change the fusion protein unfolds and thrusts the fusion peptide into the hydrophobic region of the host membrane. Next, the protein folds back, bringing the anchored membrane in close contact with the viral membrane until a stalklike structure is formed. The stalk structure results from the mixing of the outer leaflet of the host membrane with the viral membrane, referred to as hemifusion. After a short lag time, the stalk is converted into a fusion pore through which the viral contents can exit. It may be necessary for multiple fusion proteins to work in concert to bend the membrane to induce fusion.",

Proteolytic cleavage is believed to expose specific regions of the S protein, including the fusion peptide [23] . Because proteolytic cleavage dictates fusion competency, the availability of proteases in the extracellular milieu is another key factor in tropism of coronavirus. A dramatic example of this is human SARS-CoV. The bound virus is able to fuse at the cell surface in absence of acidic pH, when exposed to exogenous proteases [24] . This route of entry may even be 2 to 3 orders of magnitude more efficient that the endosomal pathway [24] . In this case, proteolytic cleavage changed the fusion pathway. By combining single particle fusion with proteinaceous supported bilayers and microfluidics, the sequence of triggers can be controlled and the associated fusion pathway and kinetics quantitatively measured.",

Transfections were performed using TurboFect transfection reagent (ThermoScientific) according to manufacturer's instructions and using 6 mg of plasmid DNA for each plate. Twentyfour hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with buffer A (2 mM CaCl 2 , 10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl at pH 7.4). 3 ml of buffer B (2 mM CaCl 2 , 10 mM HEPES, 25 mM formaldehyde, 2 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) and 150 mM NaCl at pH 7.4) was added to each dish to induce cell blebbing. The dishes were then incubated for 1 h at 37 C with gentle rocking. After incubation, the cell supernatant, containing detached cell blebs, was decanted into a 15 ml falcon tube and placed on ice for 20 min to allow any detached cells to settle out. The supernatant was transferred to new test tube. Blebs were then dialysed using cellulose dialysis tubing (Fischer Scientific), in two 100 ml volumes of buffer A for 24 h. The size of cell blebs was determined by dynamic light scattering using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano (Worcestershire, UK). The sample registered 3 peaks at approximately 38 nm, 106 nm, and 530 nm.",

For example, cathepsin proteases found in the endosomal compartment are naturally used to breakdown proteins taken up into the lysosome [33] . Once a virus gets endocytosed, cathepsins can also cleave the coronavirus spike protein [25,34e37] . Trypsin is a common extracellular protease found in the digestive tract of many vertebrates [38] to break down proteins during digestion [38] .

In this setup, two lasers can be used simultaneously to excite different color fluorophores; we used 561 nm and 488 nm excitation wavelengths from solid-state lasers. These were coupled into the optical pathway of the microscope using a Laser TIRF 3 slider (Carl Zeiss, Inc.), which controlled the angles of incidence. Exceeding the critical angle for glass/water interface (w62 ) ensured total internal reflection of the lasers and created evanescent waves about 100 nm thick. At this thickness, the evanescent waves excited fluorophores positioned within the supported bilayer, or virions labeled R18. The excitation laser light was band-pass filtered through a Semrock 74 HE GFP/mRFP filter cube, and then combined with a dichroic mirror before being focused on the outer edge of the back aperture of the objective.

In videos where background noise was high due to a large amount of fusion events, a rolling ball background subtraction algorithm was applied to all of the images to remove excess background noise as the fluorophores diffused into the membrane after hemifusion. The rolling ball algorithm determines the local background for every pixel by averaging over a large circular region around the pixel. This background value is then subtracted from the original image. The fluorescence trajectories for the particles were then imported to MATLAB (Mathworks) for further analysis.

Irregular recovery could indicate either disconnected, isolated, bilayer patches that did not heal to form a contiguous film over this length scale, or the presence of lipid microdomain formation. This data indicates that the bilayer has a relatively uniform distribution and is contiguous. Other possibilities for the structure of the bilayer include partial bleb rupture (such as only the outer leaflet fusing to the BHK-liposomes). However, because the diffusion coefficients and mobile fractions in the pure BHK-liposome SLB and fAPN-SB bilayers are comparable, this structure can be ruled out by the following argument. If the blebs were only partially fused, then the R18 trapped in the inner leaflet could not readily exchange with the surrounding lipids after being photobleached.

These images are all taken under 40\u00c2 magnification. The dark lines in each image are scratches intentionally made with a dissection tool that is used to find the focal plane of the bilayer. The continuous focus of this line throughout the rupture process indicates that the focal plane not change and that the uniform distribution of fluorescence at t \u00bc 300 s is due to mobility of fluorophores redistributed throughout the newly-formed planar bilayer.",

This model has been used to analyze the kinetics of single particle influenza fusion [5, 7] , and because of the similarity between the class I fusion proteins of HA and S, this model is used to analyze coronavirus fusion here. The probability distribution was fit to our data using a nonlinear least squares fitting algorithm. Fig. 5ced summarizes the hemifusion kinetic parameters obtained for trypsin-treated FCoV over a range of triggering pH: 4.0 to 6.0. We note that at pH's above 6.0, the number of fusing particles was too low to obtain statistically significant kinetic parameters. The data presented here (pH 4.0e6.0) corresponds to experiments where at least 50 fusion events occurred. What is clear from this data is that FCoV-1683 S cleaved with trypsin requires at least a mildly an acidic environment to fuse, but the rate dependence on pH is negligible. This may indicate that there is a mildly acidic pH threshold at which FCoV-1683 S becomes fusogenically active. As such, we show here that acidic pH may be considered as a subtle trigger for fusion, along with the better characterized triggers of receptor binding and proteolytic processing of S.",

In our previous single particle kinetics studies of influenza X-31 HA membrane fusion [7] , we found hemifusion and pore formation rate constants at pH 4.5 of k H w 0.2 s \u00c01 and k pore w 0.08 s \u00c01 , respectively. Here, for FCoV S at the same pH, we obtain k H w 0.05 s \u00c01 and k pore w 0.07 s \u00c01 , respectively. One main difference we observe between HA and S is the pH-dependence of the hemifusion rate constant. FCoV-1683 S apparently requires an acidic environment to fuse, but the rate dependence on pH is negligible. Influenza, on the other hand, exhibits pH-dependent k H [5, 7] . However, the pore formation kinetics for both viruses is approximately the same. This result is not surprising because the pore formation step is not believed to be pH dependent [43, 44] , but controlled to some extent by the physico-chemical properties (e.g., lipid composition, protein content, cholesterol quantity, etc.) of the membranes involved in fusion. Since cell blebs can be made from various cell types, the method presented here for forming supported bilayers from blebs also provides a new way to interrogate the impact of cell membrane type on viral fusion kinetics.",

For influenza, N varies depending on the pH, but within the range of pH 4.0 to 6.0 is w3 using the same experimental acidification conditions employed in these studies. In the case of FCoV S, if this interpretation was used, our data indicates that on average 1e2 S proteins are required to induce hemifusion across the same pH range. For this interpretation, a single S protein appears to have more energy stored within it to induce fusion compared to HA. An alternative interpretation is that N in this case simply means that w1 step is dominating the kinetics, and that step apparently does not vary much with pH.

Because supported bilayers can be made from many cell types [14, 17] , this method can be used to obtain kinetics of virus fusion as it depends on the kind of cell membrane host. In particular, for the many viruses that engage multiple receptors or co-receptors, this method allows the role of individual receptors to be defined in the context of the fusion event. Through biochemical means, proteins can be expressed or suppressed in the plasma cell membrane. Thus, supported bilayers can be tailor-made for fundamental studies of specific host-pathogen interactions that mitigate infection. In addition, by the incorporation of pseudoparticles [9] , the method may be expanded to study viruses of high biomedical importance that require enhanced biosafety procedures (BSL-3 and BSL-4).",

            "text": "In this work, we obtain the membrane fusion kinetics of a lessstudied, but clinically important, class I fusion protein: coronavirus S. Overall, the fusion results here recapitulate what is observed in vivo, that coronavirus entry requires binding to specific receptors and that membrane fusion is both receptor-and proteasedependent. These results indicate that the in vitro method described here is a suitable substitute for studying fusion in vivo, but our method of creating and combining proteinaceous bilayers with single particle tracking, now provides a convenient way to obtain quantitative kinetic rate parameters for intermediate steps in the coronavirus fusion pathway, which to our knowledge have not been obtained before. The single particle approach combined with microfluidics offers versatile control over the sequence of triggers of binding, protease exposure, and acidification. Control of the sequence of these triggers is important, as the order may define the fusion pathway, tissue tropism, and pathogenicity of coronaviruses. Systematically varying these complex triggers using this platform provides a new way to study this virus's ability to rapidly adapt to other hosts. Versatile platforms are of critical importance to providing data that can be leveraged to limit the infection of the human population, especially in light of the recently-emerging strain of MERS-CoV. Green and red channel images of this virion undergoing hemifusion (green) and then pore formation (red). The arrows denote the virion being analyzed, which has both labels co-localized in one particle. In the red channel, a second particle is visible; however, during this span of time, it does not fuse. (b) The corresponding fluorescence intensity traces of the virion in (a). The lag time between hemifusion and pore formation for this virion is denoted by the black doubleended arrow. (c) Pore formation statistics at pH 4.5 taken from single particle fusion events, like those in (b). The bar graph shows the distribution of lag times between the hemifusion spike and the release of internal fluorescence for each dual-labeled fusing virus.
