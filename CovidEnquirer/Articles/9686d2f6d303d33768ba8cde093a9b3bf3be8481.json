A section addressing the use of UVGI for environmental surfaces is also included. The germicidal susceptibility of biologic agents is addressed, but with emphasis on application in health care facilities. The balance of scientific evidence indicates that UVGI should be considered as a disinfection application in a health care setting only in conjunction with other well-established elements, such as appropriate heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems; dynamic removal of contaminants from the air; and preventive maintenance in combination with through cleaning of the care environment. We conclude that although UVGI is microbiocidal, it is not ''ready for prime time'' as a primary intervention to kill or inactivate infectious microorganisms; rather, it should be considered an adjunct. Other factors, such as careful design of the built environment, installation and effective operation of the HVAC system, and a high level of attention to traditional cleaning and disinfection, must be assessed before a health care facility can decide to rely solely on UVGI to meet indoor air quality requirements for health care facilities. More targeted and multiparameter studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and incremental benefit of UVGI for mitigating reservoirs of microorganisms and ultimately preventing cross-transmission of pathogens that lead to health care-associated infections.",

UVGI is known to be efficacious to varying degrees in controlling the circulation of airborne infectious particles. Approximately 60% of all UVGI air disinfection systems are installed in health care facilities. According to Kowalski and Bahnfleth, 1 this equates to 41% in hospitals and 19% in clinics. Until recently, most of the experimental data that led to the development of UVGI systems were decades old. Aside from anecdotal observations, little information about the actual performance of these systems in hospital rooms was available. Although UV light is known to inactivate microorganisms, limiting their ability to grow and multiply when inhaled or picked up on surfaces, there is insufficient evidence on which to base a decision to rely solely on UVGI as an engineering control for preventing health care-associated tuberculosis (TB) transmission. 2 Numerous laboratory studies, dating back to the 1930s, have been conducted to analyze the efficacy of UVGI for various microorganisms in a range of temperature and humidity conditions; few studies have evaluated the practical application of UVGI in health care buildings, however. 3 Most of the existing evidence comes from laboratory investigations conducted under simulated conditions. Our search revealed only one study that has been conducted in a physically realistic setting under controlled conditions. 4 That study served as the basis for the 2009 National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) technical guidance document on the use of UVGI systems to protect health care providers from occupational TB infection. 5 This review examines the gaps in existing evidence and highlights design and operational factors that can significantly impact the efficacy of UVGI systems.",

The size can range from obligate inhalational airborne pathogens, such as M tuberculosis, to preferential inhalational transmission, such as measles virus or varicella-zoster (VZV) (based on the ability to cause infection in distal airways), to opportunistic pathogens like SARS-CoV that take advantage of unique environmental and clinical circumstances that permit dissemination over several meters. For M tuberculosis, the prototype obligate inhalational pathogen, airborne droplet nuclei containing this agent can travel via air currents, aided by the ventilation system, and be spread over a wide area. The disease-causing organisms then are inhaled and cause infection. induction of cough by chest physiotherapy. There is theoretical chance that pathogen-laden droplets expelled during these procedures might travel further distances and reach deeper into the respiratory tract of susceptible persons. Concerns over the protection of health care personnel performing these types of procedures on patients with H1N1 2009 infection led to recommendations for higher facepiece filtering devices, such as N95 respirators.

Air filtration aims to reduce airborne concentrations to well below infectious doses. In a hospital setting, patients lie in bed much of the time. The direction of an exhalation jet from a standing or seated person and that from a lying person can be different (eg, the latter may face up). The upward thermal plume generated by a standing or seated person is much stronger than that generated by a lying person. Thus, some differences between the behaviors of breathing flows in hospital and other indoor environments are expected. The exhalation jet from a lying patient can behave differently in different ventilation systems, and also can be affected by other factors, such as the mode of contaminant release and the thermal plume generated by the human body or other heat sources. Understanding breathing flows from a patient lying supine with different ventilation systems is useful for developing an effective ventilation method for minimizing the risk of cross-infection via airborne transmission. Droplet nuclei ,5 mm in diameter exhibit a settling velocity of ,1 m/h (88 feet per minute in still air, and can follow the exhalation flows as well as the ambient air flows in a hospital ward. Clinically applicable distinctions are made between short-range airborne infection routes (between individuals, generally ,1 m apart) and long-range routes (within a room, between rooms, or between distant locations, generally distances .1 m). Fennelly et al 15 Small droplets also may participate in short-range transmission, but they are more likely than larger droplets to evaporate to become droplet nuclei and then be considered to have the potential for long-range airborne transmission.",

In addition, influenza virus can survive for up to 5 minutes on hands, and can be transferred to hands from these nonporous surfaces for 24 hours and from tissues for 15 minutes. 21 More recently, Lai et al 22 demonstrated that SARS CoV can survive in alkaline diarrhea stools for up to 4 days and can remain infectious in respiratory specimens for more than 7 days at room temperature. Similarities with other viruses of nosocomial importance (eg, other RNA lipid-enveloped respiratory viruses, such as influenza) suggest that such organisms can survive long enough in aerosols to cause disease, especially when associated with biological fluids such as mucus, feces, and blood. This sensitivity to environmental conditions also might help explain the seasonality of some viral infections.",

These fixtures are designed to inactivate bacteria that enter the upper irradiated zone, and their efficacy is highly reliant on, among other factors, the airflow field conditions in the room. The survival probability of bacteria exposed to UV irradiance depends on the susceptibility of the target microorganism and the dose and duration of UV-C to which it is exposed. 32 Lamps used to produce UV-C are located relatively high up in the room (8 ft), to prevent exposure to occupants by a specially designed fixture. There are two basic designs: a ''pan'' fixture with UVGI unshielded above the unit to direct the irradiation upward, and a fixture with a series of parallel plates that direct the irradiation outward while preventing the light from reaching the eyes or unprotected skin of the room's occupants. Germicidal activity is dependent on air mixing via convection between the room's irradiated upper zone and the lower patient care zones. 32 This was confirmed in an investigation by Miller et al 4 that involved installation of upper-room UVGI units and evaluation of these units' impact on culturable airborne bacteria. More than 90% of the bacteria detected were inactivated; however, the rate was lower for more-resistant bacteria and fungal spores. That investigation also clearly demonstrated that room air must be mixed for UVGI to effectively inactivate microorganisms. When warm air entered the room via a duct close to the ceiling (which can occur in the winter when the heating system is turned on), the warm air simply ''rested'' on the much cooler air below, and the efficacy of the UVGI system was dramatically diminished because the microbes did not move up for exposure to the UV-C irradiation. No mixing fans were turned on during the experiment, but moderate ventilation was present.",

The intensity of germicidal wavelength light decreases with age, and bulb ratings (hours of use) may vary by manufacturer. 13 Upper-room UVGI is often seen as a cost-effective measure to supplement the general ventilation system in a room; however, the combination of the general ventilation system and UV lamps might not necessarily be implemented correctly within a room. For example, if the ventilation rate is too high, the particles may not be sufficiently exposed to the UV-C irradiation to ensure complete inactivation, or if the ventilation system does not provide good mixing within the room, airborne particles containing microbes might not even be exposed to the UV-C irradiation. 13 A well-designed upper-room UVGI system may effectively kill or inactivate most airborne droplet nuclei containing Mycobacterium spp if designed to provide an average UV fluence rate (ie, irradiance from all angles that is incident on a small region of space; a more accurate term than ''UV dose'') in the upper room in the range of 30-50 mW/cm 2 , provided that the other criteria stipulated in the CDC's TB guidelines are met. 2 The fixtures should be installed to provide as uniform a UVGI distribution as possible in the upper room. 5 Schafer et al 33 developed a method to measure fluence rate and used it to verify that this rate varied as much as 3-fold in a typical room, depending on proximity to the lamp, and found that lamp failure was common. This reinforces the need to monitor the efficacy of the lamps used in UVGI fixtures. Under experimental laboratory conditions with mechanical ventilation rates of up to 6 ACH, the rate at which microorganisms are killed or inactivated by UVGI systems appears to be additive with mechanical ventilation systems in well-mixed rooms. 2 For other infectious agents, such as SARS-CoV and influenza, the mode of transmission is by droplets, which do not remain suspended in air for long periods of time, but fall out within a 2-m radius from a coughing/sneezing person. Even the most robust HVAC system is unlikely to achieve sufficient air mixing to provide efficient kill of microbes transmitted by droplets. These particles never reach the upper-room UV zone; thus, an alternate method of disinfection is needed. 34 Escombe et al 35 recently investigated impact of upward-facing UV light fixtures installed in ceilings of a negative-pressure TB isolation ward and ceilingmounted air ionization fixtures in an animal enclosure chamber, using a guinea pig air sampling model that involved exposure of the animals to exhaust air from the isolation ward. With this animal model, 35% of controls exposed to untreated exhaust air from the TB ward developed TB infection, whereas frequency was reduced to 14% and 9.5% with use of an ionizer and UVGI, respectively. They concluded that ''provided there is adequate mixing of room air, an upper-room UVGI fixture is an effective, low-cost intervention for use in TB infection control in high-risk clinical settings.'' 35",

A number of studies have indicated that the effectiveness of upper-room UVGI systems decreases as humidity increases. For optimal efficiency, RH should be controlled to 60% or less when upper-room UVGI systems are installed. Temperature should be kept between 688F and 75 8F (20 8C-24 8C). Both of these suggestions are consistent with 2010 Facility Guidelines Institute (FGI) and the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) recommendations in ASHRAE Standard 170 (now part of the FGI Guidelines Standards). 36 The ASHRAE Handbook also provides comprehensive recommendations for installation and operation of UVGI systems. 37 Experimental upper-room UVGI systems used in rooms with aerosolized bacteria (including surrogates of M tuberculosis) have shown that the higher the UV fluence rate produced in the upper air of a room, the greater the effectiveness of the system. 4, 38, 39 Based on the results of experiments with upper-room UVGI systems and aerosolized bacteria in bench-scale reactors, it is apparent that the greater the UV fluence rate in the irradiated zone, the more effective the system. 40, 41 However, there appears to be an upper threshold after which an increase in UVGI does not directly correspond to an increase in the system's ability to kill or inactivate microorganisms. 4, 13, 42, 43 Miller et al 4 reported decreased effectiveness of the UVGI system when the UV fixtures were placed on only one side of the room. This is consistent with the findings of Riley and Permutt, 44 who reported that a wider distribution of low-irradiance UV lamps was more efficient compared with the use of one centrally located high-irradiance UV lamp. This suggests that upperroom UVGI systems should be installed to provide the most uniform UVGI distribution in the upper air possible.",

There are anecdotal reports that this configuration results in energy conservation and maintenance cost savings, but more rigorous study is needed to reproduce and validate these claims. Some manufacturers of these systems have also made claims of reduced incidence of health care-associated infections (HAIs) with the use of UVGI in AHUs. To date, however, there is little, if any, supportive evidence in the peer-reviewed scientific literature. Many of the published investigations rely on environmental surface or air sampling cultures or laboratory-based animal studies for inferential support. Our assessment of the available literature indicates claims of reduced HAIs from AHU-installed UVGI in health care facilities remain unfounded. There is some evidence of fewer complaints related to indoor air quality in buildings with systems containing UVGI inside the AHU. 46 Levetin et al 47 provided some evidence for this by demonstrating a significantly lower concentration of fungal spores on a floor of a building with an in-duct UVGI system compared with a floor in the same building without such a system. The spores recovered in the building were the same as from insulation material in the ventilation ducts, however. The authors concluded that few spores from the outdoors passed through filters in the AHUs, but that the spores developed when the HVAC system was turned on and off. Notably, they noted that ''as a result, we cannot say that the UV-C radiation had a direct effect on spores in the air stream. The effectiveness of UV-C lamps seemed to be localized, because visual inspection indicated there was conspicuous fungal growth in the downstream duct insulation lining.'' 47 UV lamps also can be placed inside supply or return air ducts to disinfect the air before it is supplied to an occupied space or when recirculated.",

One study found that the effectiveness of this application is limited by the low penetrating power of UVGI, and thus it is currently limited to decontaminating surfaces when conventional methods, such as the use of liquid chemical disinfectants, are not feasible. 31 Some studies also have explored disinfection of medical devices and other high-frequency touch surfaces. Sweeney and Dancer 49 found that UVGI disinfection of computer keyboards without mechanical friction from cleaning had no impact on bioburden for 72% of the 68 keyboards in their study, and concluded that physical cleaning is of greatest importance before the use of UVGI. Kac et al 50 found that UVGI effectively disinfected endocavitary ultrasound probes, but only if used in combination with a surface disinfectant applied with a cloth and with mechanical friction. Interestingly, both of these investigations highlight the adjunctive impact of UVGI following traditional cleaning and disinfection for medical devices and other surfaces, whivch is consistent with use of UVGI for disinfection of air. More recently Rutala et al 51 presented unpublished results of their study of ''no-touch'' full room disinfection with an automated, portable UV-C device that uses mirrors to ''bounce'' UVGI around a room to reach all surfaces, including those not directly exposed to fluence. They reported substantial log reductions in vegetative bacteria (3) (4) within 15 minutes of exposure and in spore-forming bacteria, such as C difficile (2-3), after 50 minutes of exposure.",

            "text": "An analytical model for evaluating the UV dose in steady-state conditions using the Eulerian system was proposed by Memarzadeh et al. 48 Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to study the efficacy of inactivation of airborne bacteria by upper-room UVGI in a test room. Several UV lamp configurations were used in the model. Compared with available experimental data, the proposed model closely predicts the percentage of particles inactivated by UVGI. The proposed model was used to study the effects of ventilation flow rate and UV fixture configuration on inactivation of airborne bacteria in a test chamber. The Lagrangian system model was also applied in the same test chamber for a similar scenario. This CFD model demonstrates that the percentage of UVGI inactivation is higher when the ventilation flow rate is lower. Increasing the ventilation flow rate from 2 to 6 ACH reduces the residence time of a pass through the UV zone from 24.7 to 8.3 seconds. In the latter case, the dosage is then only\u02dc35% of the total dose received in the former case. For upper-room UVGI to be effective, the aerosolized infectious particles must be moved from the lower part of the room, where they are produced by a person coughing or sneezing, to the germicidal zone in the upper room. Practical considerations prohibit the ideal situation of UVGI cleansing of all infectious particles in a single pass when they move through the upper-room UVGI zone. Another consideration is how rapidly microorganisms proceed through the UVGI zone. A higher frequency of ACH limits the exposure time of the infectious particles to the UVGI and thus is likely to have less effective antimicrobial activity. In practice, the effectiveness of a UVGI installation is determined by the following factors: d Fixture used to house the UV-C lamp. This determines how much of the radiation discharged from the UV lamp is actually emitted from the fixture and how it is distributed. d Environmental sustainability issues. Most UV-C lamps use low-pressure mercury, have a limited life span, and require environmental precautions for disposal. d Distance from the UV-C lamp. The distance of airborne infectious agents from the fixture will determine the irradiance level and thus the germicidal efficacy. d Airflow pattern. This affects how long the bacteria and viruses are exposed to the UV radiation. d Humidity. The humidity of the atmosphere is key, because water makes the infectious agent less susceptible to damage from UV radiation. The higher the RH, the less likely an aqueous aerosol will dry out. For maximum effectiveness of UVGI, RH should be ,75%. 34",

Some BWH orthopedic surgical staff members were concerned about unspecified skin and eye symptoms, which they attributed to germicidal UV-C radiation produced by ceiling-mounted UVGI lamps in orthopedic operating rooms (ORs). The use of UVGI in orthopedic ORs was investigated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) on January 19, 2007 , in response to a formal complaint submitted after staff discovered that the UVGI lamp controls in an OR had been tampered with and set at an inappropriately high setting. After an inspection, OSHA recommended that BWH provide annual UV-C and personal protective equipment (PPE) training and medical screening for all affected employees, as well as ensure that all affected employees use the required PPE. In July 2008, BWH moved the orthopedic operating suite to an area equipped with laminar airflow and discontinued the use of UVGI for intraoperative infection control. NIOSH investigators recommended the use of alternative infection control technologies, such as laminar airflow. 53 ",

[54] [55] [56] Some evidence suggests that the use of UVGI in this manner might reduce the incidence of surgical site infections by minimizing intraoperative levels of airborne bacterial contaminants. This design differs from upper-room devices in that the UV-C irradiation is directed down to expose the entire OR. Eye protection and other attire are required for those in the OR. The relative efficacy of direct UVGI on intraoperative air quality and prevention of infection has not been well defined, however, because studies that have examined its use did so at a variety of UV intensities in association with other infection prevention methods and surgical techniques. In addition, most studies have been observational, before-after investigations, which are limited by biases and other confounding variables. Investigators have reported that UVGI is usually used not alone, but rather in conjunction with laminar airflow or body exhaust techniques, with discrepancies in wound rates under the same conditions. 56 The CDC recommends against using UVGI to prevent surgical site infections. 26 Overall, for general ventilation effectiveness, there is little advantage to increasing the effectiveness of the UVGI beyond 4-6 ACH. UVGI is effective when at low ACH, and its efficacy diminishes as ACH increases, because the kill rate is dependent on the duration of exposure to the UV dose. With high ACH, exposure time is significantly decreased.",

The objective of this approach is to minimize the risk of failure of preventive measures, resulting in a hazardous exposure. According to the hierarchy, initial efforts should be made to eliminate the hazardous agent or source of exposure. With regard to intraoperative UVGI use, this could be achieved by substituting other infection prevention methods or technologies, such as vertical laminar air flow, before implementing direct UVGI inside the OR. 53 It should be noted that a more recent design for the OR uses nonaspirating diffusers with unidirectional airflow over the surgical site but at lower velocities than traditional high-velocity laminar sir flow, thereby minimizing the risk of hypothermia. This design is now required in the 2010 FGI guidelines 36 and is described in detail elsewhere. 57 ",

Actual testing with the contaminants of interest is highly recommended. d View claims regarding UVGI systems' high level of inactivation of pathogenic bioaerosols with caution. Whereas the microbiological science underlying these conclusions applies to pathogenic bioaerosols as well as environmental organisms, much greater caution is required in the former case.
