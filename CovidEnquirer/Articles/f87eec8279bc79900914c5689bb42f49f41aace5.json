Therefore, the results of 316 simulations applied in other countries show that the cumulated case number increases 317 rapidly at the start for some countries, particularly for countries with higher 318 vulnerability. After one month, the epidemic was controlled and the number of cases in 319 each country no longer increased significantly. Meanwhile, considering the extreme, 320 high, medium, and low simulation levels of the epidemic scenarios in various countries, 321 it can also be seen that after a period of time, namely in April, the case number 322 differences between the scenarios will be clearly comparable. A1 extreme is the highest 323 scenario, followed by B1, C1, and D1. Meanwhile, severe scenarios ( Figure 8) are 324 based on the trend that COVID-19 may be like traditional influenza for a global 325 pandemic; that is, cases will continue to occur, which may lead to >10,000 cases in 326 some countries. However, the general spatial distribution of case numbers is similar to 327 conservative scenarios. This scenario is still the same as that with the highest case 328 numbers in the A2 extreme scenario, followed by B2, C2, and D2. .
