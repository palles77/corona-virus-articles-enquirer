Quantitative real-time RT-PCR and Western blot analysis demonstrated that cyclin D1 was reduced post-transcriptionally within infected cells independently of the cell-cycle stage at the time of infection. Confocal microscopy revealed that cyclin D1 decreased in IBV-infected cells as infection progressed and inhibition studies indicated that a population of cyclin D1 could be targeted for degradation by a virus mediated pathway. In contrast to the SARS-coronavirus, IBV nucleocapsid protein did not interact with cyclin D1.",

Many viruses interact with the cell cycle to promote favourable conditions for virus infection and for disrupting host cell proliferation and function [4] . However, the alteration of the host cell cycle by RNA viruses has not been described as extensively when compared to DNA or retroviruses.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are a family of positive strand RNA viruses which replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells and belong to the order Nidovirales [5] . Infection of cells with the avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) causes a G2/M phase arrest [6] , with changes in the amounts of proteins involved in cell cycle regulation, such as a reduction in cyclin D1 [6] . In the case of the murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), infection results in an arrest in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle with a resulting decrease in the D-type cyclins [7] . Over-expression studies indicated that a component of the viral replicase could arrest cells in this phase of the cell cycle [8] . On the other hand, in patients infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus hepatocytes have been reported to accumulate in mitosis [9] and this is in contrast to a number of SARS-coronavirus proteins that when over expressed lead to an accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle [10, 11] . For example, the SARS-coronavirus nucleocapsid (N) protein has been reported to block S phase progression [12] and prolong the G0/G1 phase and shorten the S phase [13] . Likewise, when over expressed the IBV N protein delays cell growth and results in aberrant cytokinesis [14, 15] , which is also observed in infected cells [6, 15] .",

Like all cyclins, levels of cyclin D1 fluctuate depending on the particular stage of the cell cycle, with levels of cyclin D1 accumulating in the G1 phase. Cyclin D1 is then rapidly degraded via the cellular proteosome during S phase allowing DNA synthesis to occur [16] . Levels then begin to rise again during the G2 and M phases of the cell cycle. Regulation of cyclin D1 expression is controlled by the abundance of cyclin D1 mRNA, sub-localisation and degradation [17] .

Where appropriate these probes were designed across exon-exon boundaries so no genomic DNA or unprocessed RNA would be amplified. IBV genomic RNA was quantified using previously describe primer/probe sets: forward primer: CGTACCGGTTCTGTTGTGTGA; reverse primer: GCCCAACGCTAGGCTCAA and probe: TCACCTCCCCCCACA-TACCTCTAAGGG [25] . Quantification was based on increased fluorescence detected due the 5 0 exonuclease activity of the Taq DNA polymerase during PCR amplification hydrolysing the target specific probes. The reporter signal was normalised by the reference dye 6-carboxy-c-rhodamine, which was not actually involved in amplification. Results were expressed in terms of C t values (threshold cycle value); the cycle at which the change in reporter dye passes a significance threshold (DR n ). Variation in sampling and RNA preparation was accounted for by standardising the C t values for gene-specific products for each sample to the C t value of 28S rRNA product for the same sample. RNA levels between samples in the same experiment were normalised by pooling values from all samples in that experiment and calculating the mean C t value for 28S rRNA-specific gene product. Variations in each individual 28S rRNA sample compared to the mean were then calculated. Differences in input of total RNA were calculated by determining the slope of the 28S rRNA log 10 dilution series regression line. Using the slopes of the respective gene specific or 28S rRNA log 10 dilution series regression lines, the difference in input total RNA, as represented by the 28S rRNA, was then used to adjust the gene specific C t values [25] .",

            "text": "Cyclin D1 mainly functions during the G1 phase and at the G1/S phase transition before being rapidly degraded via the ubiquitin pathway during S phase [17] . Cyclin D1 levels then begin to rise again in the G2/M phase. Therefore, we investigated the effect on cyclin D1 mRNA and protein in IBV-infected cells which had been enriched at either the G1/S or G2/M phase border. Vero cells were enriched in these phases using, either a double thymidine block or nocodazole treatment [6] . After treatment, cell cycle profiles were determined using dual flow cytometry and the data indicated that the cells had been enriched at the G1/S or G2/M phase border (Figs. 3A and 4A, respectively). For double thymidine treated cells there were an average of 88% of cells in the G1 phase, 3% in S phase and 9% in the G2/M phase, and in cells treated with nocodazole, there were an average of 20% of cells in G1, 23% in S phase and 57% in the G2/M phase, as described previously [6] . The cells were then simultaneously released and treated with either UV-inactivated virus or infected with IBV and the levels of cyclin D1 protein (determined by Western blot) and mRNA (determined by TaqMan as per above) compared to that of mock-infected cells at 24 h post-infection and release. The data indicated that the amount of cyclin D1 protein was reduced in IBV-infected cells compared to mock-infected or UV-inactivated virus treated cells for both cell cycle conditions (Figs. 3B and 4B ). There was no significant difference in the levels of cyclin D1 mRNA for both conditions (Figs. 3C  and 4C ). This mirrored the observations of cyclin D1 protein and mRNA in asynchronously growing and G0 enriched Vero cells, and indicated that reduction in cyclin D1 levels by IBV was not dependent on the cell cycle stage at the time of infection. Interestingly, in the cells enriched in the G2/M phase of the cell cycle whilst the amount of cyclin D1 protein was greater in mock-infected cells at 24 h post-infection compared to 0 h, in infected cells the amount of cyclin D1 remained unchanged compared to that at 0 h. This result could be attributed to the fact that in uninfected cycling cells cyclin D1 is rapidly degraded in S phase and then increases again in the G2 phase [31] , whereas IBV arrests cells in the early G2 phase of the cell cycle [6] and therefore cyclin D1 levels may not have started to increase.",

To test whether this was the case in IBV-infected cells, mock and infected cells were treated with the CRM-1 inhibitor, leptomycin B (LMB). To confirm that the LMB treatment was active in these experiments, an RNA export assay was used based on the export of HIV-1 REV that utilizes the CRM1 pathway [19] . A luciferase gene was placed within an inefficiently spliced intron that contained the REV response element (creating plasmid pLUCSALRRE). The pre-mRNA is normally retained in the nucleus and the exported, spliced mRNA lacks the luciferase gene. Export is facilitated through co-expressing HIV-1 Rev protein under the control of a CMV promoter (plasmid pRev), which ensures that the pre-mRNA is actively exported through the CRM1 pathway and luciferase activity would therefore be detected. The presence of LMB would inhibit the REV-dependent mRNA export, confirming that LMB treatment of cells was effectively blocking the CRM1-dependent export pathway. Therefore, in order to assess the activity of LMB Vero cells were transfected with pLUCSALRRE with or without LMB and also in the absence and presence of pRev (Fig. 7A) . The data indicated that in the absence of pRev there was no signif-icant difference in luciferase activity between LMB treated or untreated cells, and this level was taken as background activity. In contrast, when the pRev protein was present, the level of luciferase was 70% less in LMB treated cells compared to untreated cells, indicating that LMB reduced CRM1-mediated export.",

One candidate viral protein, could be the IBV N protein which can traffic between the nucleolus and the cytoplasm [22, 26] and interactions with the nucleolus and its proteins may be one mechanism by which RNA viruses can disrupt the cell cycle [39] . IBV N protein is a phospho-protein which binds RNA with high affinity [40, 41] . In the case of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), N protein has been shown to interact with cyclin D1 in cells expressing N protein [12] . To investigate whether IBV N protein could interact with cyclin D1 co-localisation studies using confocal microscopy and pull down studies were performed. However, no co-localisation was observed in cells expressing IBV N protein tagged to the fluorescent fusion protein, EGFP (Fig. 10A ). This may have been due to the fact that IBV N protein localises principally to the cytoplasm and nucleolus, rather than the nucleus [26, 42] , which is in contrast to cyclin D1 which is predominately nuclear, therefore the two molecules could not interact. To test this hypothesis a mutant EGFP-tagged N protein was used in which the nuclear export signal had been deleted and whose localisation was nuclear and nucleolar [26] . However, no co-localisation was observed (Fig. 10B) . Likewise, cyclin D1 was tagged N-terminally with ECFP, which resulted in the accumulation of the fusion protein predominately in the cytoplasm. Transfection of cells with this plasmid and also expressing EGFP-IBV N protein indicated that no co-localisation was observed between these two proteins in the cytoplasm (Fig. 10C) .",

This may be mediated by the arrest in the G2 phase of the cell cycle of infected cells prior to the stage when cyclin D1 levels would usually begin to rise. Furthermore, in infected cells cyclin D1 is redistributed from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where we hypothesize it is targeted for degradation, by a viral protein dependent trafficking pathway. However, the precise mechanism of this pathway remains to be determined.",
