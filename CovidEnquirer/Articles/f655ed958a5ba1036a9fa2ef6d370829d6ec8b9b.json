However, extremely low viral titers (as seen in the recent Zika virus outbreak 6, 7 ) or high levels of host material 8 can limit its practical utility: a low ratio of viral to host material makes genome assembly difficult or prohibitively expensive.

Several existing approaches to probe design for nonmicrobial targets [22] [23] [24] strive to meet some of these goals but are not designed to be applied against the extensive diversity seen within and across microbial taxa. virus probe sets, and then use these to enrich viral nucleic acid in sequencing libraries from patient and environmental samples across diverse source material. We evaluate their performance and investigate any biases introduced by capture with these probe sets.

The input to CATCH is one or more datasets, each composed of sequences of any length, that need not be aligned to each other. In this study, each dataset consists of genomes from one species, or closely related taxa, we seek to target. CATCH incorporates various parameters that govern hybridization ( Supplementary Fig. 1b) , such as sequence complementarity between probe and target, and accepts different values for each dataset (Supplementary Fig.  1c ). This allows, for example, more diverse datasets to be assigned less stringent conditions than others. Assume we have a function s(d, \u03b8 d ) that gives a probe set for a single dataset d using hybridization parameters \u03b8 d , and let S({\u03b8 d }) represent the union of s(d, \u03b8 d ) across all datasets d where {\u03b8 d } is the collection of parameters across all datasets. CATCH calculates S({\u03b8 d }), or the final probe set, by minimizing a loss function over {\u03b8 d } while ensuring that the number of probes in S({\u03b8 d }) falls within a specified number of oligonucleotides (Fig.   1a ).",

For example, a user can customize the model of hybridization that CATCH uses to determine whether a candidate probe will hybridize to and capture a particular target sequence. Also, a user can design probe sets for capturing only a specified fraction of each target genome and, relatedly, for targeting regions of the genome that distinguish similar but distinct subtypes. CATCH also offers an option to blacklist sequences, e.g., highly abundant ribosomal RNA sequences, so that output probes are unlikely to capture them. CATCH can use locality-sensitive hashing 27, 28 , if desired, to reduce the number of candidate probes that are explored, improving runtime and memory usage on especially large numbers of input sequences. We implemented CATCH in a Python package that is publicly available at https://github.com/broadinstitute/catch.",

This design represents comprehensive coverage of the input sequence diversity under conservative choices of parameter values, e.g., tolerating few mismatches between probe and target sequence (Fig. 1d) . To compare the performance of V ALL against probe sets with lower complexity, we separately designed three focused probe sets for commonly co-circulating viral infections: measles and mumps viruses (V MM ; 6,219 probes), Zika and chikungunya viruses (V ZC ; 6,171 probes), and a panel of 23 species (16 genera, 12 families) circulating in West Africa (V WAFR ; 44,995 probes) ( Supplementary Fig. 3 , Supplementary Table 1) .",

These 8 viruses together reflect a range of typical viral titers in biological samples, including ones that have extremely low levels, such as ZIKV 6, 7 . The samples encompass a range of source materials: plasma, serum, buccal swabs, urine, avian swabs, and mosquito pools. We performed capture on these libraries and sequenced them both before and after capture. To compare enrichment of viral content across sequencing runs, we downsampled raw read data from each sample to the same number of reads (200,000) before further analysis. Downsampling to correct for differences in sequencing depth, rather than the more common use of a normalized count such as reads per million, is useful for two reasons. First, it allows us to compare our ability to assemble genomes (e.g., owing to capture) in samples that were sequenced to different depths. Second, downsampling helps to correct for differences in sequencing depth in the presence of a high frequency of PCR duplicate reads (Online Methods), as observed in captured libraries. We removed duplicate reads during analyses so that we could measure enrichment of viral information (i.e., unique viral content) rather than measure an artifactual enrichment arising from PCR amplification.",

Moreover, capture successfully enriched viral content in each of the 6 sample types we tested.

H4N4 was not included in the designs, making it a useful test case for this relationship.

To investigate whether these differences are related to sequence divergence from the probes, we compared the identity between probes and sequence in the H4N4 genome to the observed enrichment of that sequence (Fig. 3b) . We saw the least enrichment in segment 6 (N), which had the least identity between probe sequence and the H4N4 sequence, as we did not include any sequences of the N4 subtypes in the probe designs. Interestingly, V ALL did show limited positive enrichment of segment 6, as well as of segment 4 (H); these enrichments were lower than those of the less divergent segments. But this was not the case for segment 4 when using V WAFR , suggesting a greater target affinity of V WAFR capture when there is some degree of divergence between probes and target sequence (Fig. 3b) , potentially due to this probe set's longer, ssRNA probes. For both probe sets, we observed no clear inter-segment differences in enrichment across the remaining segments, whose sequences have high identity with probe sequences (Fig. 3b , Supplementary Fig. 9 ). These results show that the probe sets can capture sequence that differs markedly from what they were designed to target, but nonetheless that sequence similarity with probes influences enrichment efficiency.",

At equivalent pre-and post-capture sequencing depth (200,000 reads), use of V ALL improved our ability to detect and assemble LASV. Capture considerably increased the amount of unique LASV material detected in all 23 samples (in 4 samples, by more than 100 \u2715), and in 7 samples it enabled detection when there were no LASV reads pre-capture ( Supplementary Fig. 10a , Supplementary Table 7) . This in turn improved genome assembly. Whereas pre-capture we could not assemble any portion of a genome in 22 samples (in the remaining one, 2% of a genome) at this depth, following use of V ALL we could assemble a partial genome in 22 of the 23 (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 10b ); most were small portions of a genome, although in 7 we assembled >50% of a genome. Assembly results with V ALL are comparable without downsampling ( Supplementary Fig. 10c ), likely because we saturate unique content with V ALL even at low sequencing depths ( Supplementary Fig. 7b , c). These results illustrate how V ALL can be used to improve viral detection and genome assembly in an outbreak, especially at the low sequencing depths that may be desired or required in these settings.",

This could also be applied on other small machines such as the iSeq (Illumina) or MinION (Oxford Nanopore) 40 . Further, the increase in viral content enables more samples to be pooled and sequenced on a single run, increasing sample throughput and decreasing per-sample cost relative to unbiased sequencing (Supplementary Table 9 ).

Notably, as capture requires additional cycles of amplification, computational analyses should account for duplicate reads due to amplification; the inclusion of unique molecular identifiers 41,42 could improve determination of unique fragments. Also, quantifying the sensitivity and specificity of capture with comprehensive probe sets is challenging --as it is for metagenomic sequencing more broadly --due to the need to obtain viral genomes for the hundreds of targeted species and the risk of false positives from components of sequencing and classification that are unrelated to capture (e.g., contamination in sample processing or read misclassifications). Targeted amplicon approaches may be faster and more sensitive 7 for sequencing ultra low titer samples, but the suitability of these approaches is limited by genome size, sequence heterogeneity, and the need for prior knowledge of the target species 1, 43, 44 . Similarly, for molecular diagnostics of particular pathogens, many commonly used assays such as qRT-PCR and rapid antigen tests are likely to be faster and less expensive than metagenomic sequencing. Capture does increase the preparation cost and time per-sample compared to unbiased metagenomic sequencing, but this is offset by reduced sequencing costs through increased sample pooling and/or lower-depth sequencing 1 (Supplementary Table 9 ).",

Optionally, CATCH uses localitysensitive hashing 27, 28 (LSH) to reduce the number of candidate probes, which is particularly useful when the input is a large number of highly similar sequences. CATCH supports two LSH families: one under Hamming distance 27 and another using the MinHash technique 28, 51 , which has been used in metagenomic applications 52, 53 . It detects nearduplicate candidate probes by performing approximate near neighbor search 28 using a specified family and distance threshold. CATCH constructs hash tables containing the candidate probes and then queries each (in descending order of multiplicity) to find and collapse near-duplicates. Because LSH reduces the space of candidate probes, it may remove candidate probes that would otherwise be selected in steps described below, thereby increasing the size of the output probe set. Use of LSH to reduce the number of candidate probes is optional in our implementation of CATCH; we did not use it to produce the probe sets in this work. The approach of detecting near-duplicates among probes (and subsequently mapping them onto sequences, described below) bears some similarity to the use of P-clouds for clustering related oligonucleotides in order to identify diverse repetitive regions in the human genome 54, 55 .",

We could run CATCH, as described above, on a single choice of parameters \u03b8 d such that the number of probes in s(d, \u03b8 d ) is feasible for synthesis. However, this can lead to a poor representation of taxa in the diverse probe set; it can become dominated by probes covering taxa that have more genetic diversity (e.g., HIV-1). Furthermore, it can force probes to be designed with relaxed assumptions about hybridization across all taxa. To alleviate these issues, we allow different choices of parameters governing hybridization for different subsets of input sequences, so that some can have probes designed with more relaxed assumptions than others.",

Downsampling normalizes sequencing depth across runs and allows us to more readily evaluate the effectiveness of capture on genome assembly (i.e., the fraction of the genome we can assemble) than an approach such as comparing viral reads per million. It also allows us to more readily compare unique content (see below).

We counted the number of bases that match between a probe and target sequence using each alignment's MD tag (this does not count soft-clipped ends), and defined the identity between a probe and target sequence to be this number of matching bases divided by the probe length.

In Fig. 3d , we show frequencies for a variant if it is present at \u22651% frequency in any of the replicates (i.e., either the pre-capture pool or any of the replicates from capture with V WAFR or V ALL ). The plot shows positions combined across the three samples that we analyzed.",

We ran kraken through viral-ngs and separately ran kraken-filter with a threshold of 0.1 for classification. For samples where two independent libraries had been prepared and used for V ALL and V WAFR , or where the same pre-capture library had been sequenced more than once, we merged the raw sequence files prior to downsampling. To account for laboratory contaminants we also ran kraken on water controls; we first merged all water controls together, and classified reads as described above. We evaluated the presence and enrichment of viral and other taxa using the cumulative species-level counts, as above. To do so we calculated two measures: abundance, which was calculated by dividing pre-capture read counts for each species by counts in pooled water controls, and enrichment, which was calculated by dividing post-capture read counts for each species by pre-capture read counts in the same sample. For our uncharacterized mosquito pools and human plasma samples from Nigeria and Sierra Leone, after capture with V ALL we searched for viral species with more than 10 matched reads and a read count greater than 2-fold higher than in the pooled water control after capture with V ALL . For each virus identified we assembled viral genomes and calculated per-base read depth as described above ( Supplementary Fig. 11 , Supplementary Table 8 ).

For each dataset d, CATCH generates candidate probes by tiling across input genomes and, optionally, reduces the number of them using locality-sensitive hashing. Then, it determines a profile of where each candidate probe will hybridize (the genomes and regions within them) under a model with parameters \u03b8 d (see Supplementary Fig. 1b for details). Using these coverage profiles, it approximates the smallest collection of probes that fully captures all input genomes (described in text as s(d, \u03b8 d )).

Approaches shown are simple tiling (gray), a clustering-based approach at two levels of stringency (red), and CATCH with three choices of parameter values specifying varying levels of stringency (blue). See Supplementary Note 2 for details regarding parameter choices. Previous approaches for targeting viral diversity use clustering in probe set design. Shaded regions around each line are 95% pointwise confidence bands calculated across randomly sampled input genomes. (c) Number of probes designed by CATCH for each dataset (of 296 datasets in total) among all 349,998 probes in the V ALL probe set. Species incorporated in our sample testing are labeled. (d) Values of the two parameters selected by CATCH for each dataset in the design of V ALL : number of mismatches to tolerate in hybridization and length of the target fragment (in nt) on each side of the hybridized region assumed to be captured along with the hybridized region (cover extension). The label and size of each bubble indicate the number of datasets that were assigned a particular combination of values. Species included in our sample testing are labeled in black, and outlier species not included in our testing are in gray. In general, more diverse viruses (e.g., HCV and HIV-1) are assigned more relaxed parameter values (here, high values) than less diverse viruses, but still require a relatively large number of probes in the design to cover known diversity (see (c)). Panels similar to (c) and (d) for the design of V WAFR are in Supplementary Fig. 3 . (a) Distribution of the enrichment in read depth, across viral genomes, provided by capture with V ALL on 30 patient and environmental samples with known viral infections. Each curve represents one of the 31 viral genomes sequenced here (one sample contained two known viruses). At each position across a genome, the post-capture read depth is divided by the precapture depth, and the plotted curve is the empirical cumulative distribution of the log of these fold-change values. A curve that rises fully to the right of the black vertical line illustrates enrichment throughout the entirety of a genome; the more vertical a curve, the more uniform the enrichment. Read depth across viral genomes DENV-SM3 (purple) and DENV-SM5 (green) are shown in more detail in (b). (b) Read depth throughout a genome of DENV in two samples. DENV-SM3 (left) has few informative reads before capture and does not produce a genome assembly, but does following capture. DENV-SM5 (right) does yield a genome assembly before capture, and depth increases following capture. (c) Percent of each viral genome unambiguously assembled in the 30 samples, which had 8 known viral infections across them. Shown before capture (orange), after capture with V WAFR (light blue), and after capture with V ALL (dark blue). Red bars below samples indicate ones in which we could not assemble any contig before capture but, following capture, were able to assemble at least a partial genome (>50%). (d) Left: Number of reads detected for each species across the 30 samples with known viral infections, before and after capture with V ALL . Reads in each sample were downsampled to 200,000 reads. Each point represents one species detected in one sample. For each sample, the virus previously detected in the sample by another assay is colored. Homo sapiens matches in samples from humans are shown in black. Right: Abundance of each detected species before capture and fold-change upon capture with V ALL for these samples. Abundance was calculated by dividing pre-capture read counts for each species by counts in pooled water controls. Coloring of human and viral species are as in the left panel. Relation between probe-target identity and enrichment in read depth, as seen after capture with V ALL and with V WAFR on an influenza A virus sample of subtype H4N4 (IAV-SM5). Each point represents a window in the IAV genome. Identity between the probe and assembled H4N4 sequence is a measure of identity between the sequence in that window and the top 25% of probe sequences that map to it (see Online Methods for details). Fold-change in depth is averaged over the window. No sequences of segment 6 (N) of the N4 subtypes were included in the design of V ALL or V WAFR . (c) Effect of capture on estimated frequency of within-sample co-infections. RNA of 2, 4, 6, and 8 viral species were spiked into extracted RNA from healthy human plasma and then captured with V ALL and V WAFR . Values on top are the percent of all sequenced reads that are viral. We did not detect Nipah virus (NiV) using the V WAFR probe set because this virus was not present in that design. (d) Effect of capture on estimated frequency of within-host variants, shown in positions across three dengue virus samples: DENV-SM1, DENV-SM2, and DENV-SM5. Capture with V ALL and V WAFR was each performed on n=2",
