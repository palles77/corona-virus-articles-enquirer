Among these, several 5 0 -O-masked analogues of 6-chloropurine-2 0 -deoxyriboside (e.g., 5 0 -O-benzoyl, 5 0 -O-p-methoxybenzoyl, and 5 0 -O-benzyl analogues) were found to exhibit effective anti-HCV activity. In particular, the 5 0 -O-benzoyl analogue exhibited the highest potency with an EC 50 of 6.1 lM in a cell-based HCV replicon assay. Since the 5 0 -O-unmasked analogue (i.e., 6-chloropurine-2 0 -deoxyriboside) was not sufficiently potent (EC 50 = 47.2 lM), masking of the 5 0 -hydroxyl group seems to be an effective method for the development of anti-HCV agents. Presently, we hypothesize two roles for the 5 0 -O-masked analogues: One is the role as an anti-HCV agent by itself, and the other is as a prodrug of its 5 0 -O-demasked (deprotected) derivative.",

Although the use of pegylated IFN-a instead of the unmodified one has resulted in improved therapeutic effectiveness, the sustained virological response is still poor (41-55%); moreover, in some cases, significant side effects can be caused. 4 Therefore, more efficacious therapies are urgently required for ensuring public health. 5 To date, a number of nucleoside analogues, including ribavirin, have been synthesized and tested for anti-HCV activity. 6, 7 Among these, some 2 0 -modified ribonucleoside analogues such as 2 0 -C-methyl analogues 1, 6a 2 0 -fluoro analogues 2, 6b and 2 0 -O-methyl analogue 3 6c exhibit potent anti-HCV activities in a cell-based HCV replicon assay (Fig. 1) . Particularly, Valopicitabine, a prodrug of 1c, is currently in phase II clinical trials. 8 Recently, the anti-HCV properties of 4 0 -substituted ribonucleosides such as 4 have also been reported by the Roche group. 6d Concerning the antiviral mechanism of common nucleoside analogues, it is known that most of these analogues are converted to their corresponding 5 0triphosphates by cellular and/or viral enzymes and then compete with natural triphosphates as substrates for incorporation into viral nucleic acids during viral replication. 9 Therefore, the 5 0 -hydroxyl group is indispensable to the anti-HCV activity of these nucleoside analogues. 10 Recently, we have reported that a carbocyclic oxetanocin analogue 5, one of whose hydroxyl groups (that corresponds to the 5 0 -hydroxyl group of the ribonucleoside) was masked by a benzoyl group, showed antiviral activity against the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (Fig. 2 ). 11 Interestingly, the antiviral activity of 5 (EC 50 = 14.5 lM) was much more efficacious than that of the unmasked 6 (almost no activity, EC 50 > 300 lM), which seems to indicate an inconsistency with the necessity of the 5 0 -hydroxyl group to this compound.",

Compound 28 was also used as an intermediate in the synthesis of 25, as shown in Scheme 2B. Exposure of 28 to sodium methylthiolate resulted in the formation of the debenzoylated 6-SMe analogue 29 with a 67% yield, which was reacylated into 30 in 97% yield. Unfortunately, the use of thiourea in place of sodium methylthiolate led to the decomposition of the resultant products. Finally, the removal of the TBS group afforded 25 in 88% yield. The synthesis of 24 is illustrated in Scheme 2C. The diacetate 31, which was prepared as described in a previous report, 11 was treated with dimethylamine to furnish 32 in 62% yield. 14 Subsequently, regioselective benzoylation of the 5 0 -hydroxyl group in 32 afforded 24 in 77% yield.",

Thus, a stepwise protection-deprotection process was required, which is illustrated in Scheme 3 (3A: synthesis of 20, 3B: synthesis of 21). The monoacetate 33, which was prepared from 26 by employing a partly modified Santaniello's procedure, 15 was converted to the silyl ether 34 in 94% yield. The use of a mixed solvent (pyridine-DMF) effectively reduced the competitive silylation of the 6-amino group. Protection of the amino group with pivaloyl chloride followed by the removal of the acetyl group in 35 afforded 36 with a 98% yield in two steps. The addition of DMAP and MeOH in the N-pivaloylation step was effective in converting the N,N-dipivaloylated by-product to the desired 35. Chemoselective benzylation of the 5 0 -hydroxyl group in 36 was successfully carried out by using 2.5 equiv of potassium tert-butoxide and 1.1 equiv of benzyl bromide in THF to provide 37 in 97% yield. After the removal of the pivaloyl group (76% yield), the resultant amino group of 38 was substituted with a chloro group to provide 39, which was subsequently deprotected to afford 20 with a 34% yield in two steps. Compound 21 was synthesized employing almost the same method as that for 20 described above (Scheme 3B, 20% overall yield from 36).",

Subsequent to the addition of acetic acid (150 lL) and water (3 mL), the organic solvent was removed under reduced pressure. The resultant mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate, and the organic layer was washed with saturated NaHCO 3 solution and brine, dried over Na 2 SO 4 , and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resultant residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (ethyl acetate/hexane, 3:1 to 4:1) to give 36 (324 mg, 98% from 34) as a white solid. To a stirred solution of 36 (340 mg, 0.76 mmol) in THF (7.5 mL) was added potassium tert-butoxide (210 mg, 1.89 mmol) at ice-water temperature, and the mixture was stirred at the same temperature for 1 min. Subsequent to the addition of benzyl bromide (99 lL, 0.83 mmol) at ice-water temperature, the mixture was stirred at the same temperature for further 1 h. After dilution of the mixture with water, the aqueous layer was extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic layer was washed with water and brine, dried over Na 2 SO 4 , and concentrated under reduced pressure. The resultant residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (ethyl acetate/hexane, 1:1 to 2:1) to give 37 (397 mg, 97%) as a colorless oil. 1 To a stirred solution of 37 (390 mg, 0.72 mmol) in methanol (7 mL) was added potassium carbonate (299 mg, 2.17 mmol) at ice-water temperature, and the mixture was stirred at room temperature for 7 h. After dilution with CH 2 Cl 2 , the mixture was filtrated. Subsequent to the condensation of the filtrate in vacuum, the resultant residue was diluted with ethyl acetate. The ethyl acetate layer was washed with water and brine, dried over Na 2 SO 4 , and concentrated under reduced pressure.

The mixture was stirred for 1 h at the same temperature, warmed to room temperature for 0.5 h, and stirred at 50\u00b0C for 2 h. The solvent was removed under reduced pressure, and the resultant residue was purified by silica gel column chromatography (ethyl acetate/hexane, 1:3 to 1:2) to give 39 (108 mg) with inseparable by-products, which was employed in the next reaction without further purification.",
