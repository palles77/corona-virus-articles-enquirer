(Figure 1B, Supplementary Figure 2) . Due to the small size of the RBD (~21 48 kDa), the asymmetry of this conformation was not readily apparent until ab initio 3D 49 reconstruction and 3D classification were performed ( Figure 1B, Supplementary Figure 3) . By 50 using the 3D variability feature in cryoSPARC v2 (15) , we were able to observe breathing of the 51 S1 subunits as the RBD underwent a hinge-like movement, which likely contributed to the 52 relatively poor local resolution of S1 compared to the more stable S2 subunit (Supplementary 53 Movies 1 and 2). This seemingly stochastic RBD movement has been captured during structural 54 characterization of the closely related betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as well as 55 the more distantly related alphacoronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (10, 11, 13, 56 16) . The observation of this phenomenon in 2019-nCoV S suggests that it shares the same 57 mechanism of triggering that is thought to be conserved among the Coronaviridae, wherein 58 receptor-binding to exposed RBDs leads to an unstable 3 RBD-up conformation that results in 59 shedding of S1 and refolding of S2 (11, 12) . 60",

The largest discrepancy between these 70 two structures is a conformational difference between the positions of the RBDs in their 71 respective \"down\" conformations ( Figure 2A) . Whereas the SARS-CoV RBD in the \"down\" 72 conformation packs tightly against the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the neighboring protomer, 73 the 2019-nCoV RBD in the \"down\" conformation is angled closer to the central cavity of the 74 homotrimer. Despite this observed conformational difference, when the individual structural 75 domains of 2019-nCoV S are aligned to their counterparts from SARS-CoV S, they reflect the 76 high degree of structural homology between the two proteins, with the NTDs, RBDs, 77 subdomains 1 and 2 (SD1 and SD2) and S2 subunits yielding RMSD values of 2.6 \u00c5, 3.0 \u00c5, 2.7 78 \u00c5 and 2.0 \u00c5, respectively ( Figure 2B) . 79 2019-nCoV S shares roughly 96% sequence identity with the S protein from the bat 80 coronavirus RaTG13, with the most notable variation arising from an insertion in the S1/S2 81 .

A similar phenomenon 83 has been observed for influenza viruses, where amino acid insertions that create a polybasic furin 84 site in a related position in influenza hemagglutinin proteins are often found in highly virulent 85 avian and human influenza viruses (23) . In addition to this insertion of residues in the S1/S2 86 junction, 29 variant residues exist between 2019-nCoV S and RaTG13 S, with 17 of these 87 positions mapping to the RBD (Supplementary Figures 5 and 6) . We also analyzed the 61 88 (14) . We also formed a complex of ACE2 bound to the 2019-nCoV S 98 ectodomain and observed it by negative-stain EM, where it strongly resembled the complex 99 formed between SARS-CoV S and ACE2, which has been observed at high-resolution by cryo-100 EM ( Figure 3B ) (14, 27) . The high affinity of 2019-nCoV S for human ACE2 may contribute to 101 the apparent ease with which 2019-nCoV can spread from human-to-human(1), however 102 additional studies are needed to investigate this possibility. 103 .

A cartoon depicting the ACE2-bound 2019-nCoV S protein is shown (right) with ACE2 in blue and S protein monomers colored tan, pink and green.",

(C) Biolayer interferometry to measure cross-reactivity of the SARS-CoV RBD-directed antibodies S230, m396 and 80R. Sensortips with immobilized antibodies were dipped into wells containing 2019-nCoV RBD-SD1 and the resulting data are shown as a black line.",
