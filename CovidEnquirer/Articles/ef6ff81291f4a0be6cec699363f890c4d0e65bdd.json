            "text": "Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are a major concern to healthcare systems around the world. They are associated with significant morbidity and mortality, in addition to increased hospitalization costs. Recent outbreaks, including those caused by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Ebola virus, have highlighted the importance of infection control. Moreover, HAIs, especially those caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative rods, have become a top global priority. Although adequate approaches and guidelines have been in existence for many years and have often proven effective in some countries, the implementation of such approaches in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) is often restricted due to limited resources and underdeveloped infrastructure. While evidence-based infection prevention and control (IPC) principles and practices are universal, studies are needed to evaluate simplified approaches that can be better adapted to LMIC needs, in order to guide IPC in practice. A group of experts from around the world attended a workshop held at the 17th International Congress on Infectious Diseases in Hyderabad, India in March 2016, to discuss the existing IPC practices in LMICs, and how best these can be improved within the local context.",

            "text": "Hospital-acquired infections (HAIs) are a major concern across all healthcare systems, 1 contributing significantly to patient morbidity and mortality, particularly in developing countries. 2 According to a multistate prevalence survey of healthcare-associated infections conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2011, an estimated 722 000 HAIs occurred in acute care hospitals in the USA, with 75 000 of the patients dying during their hospitalization. 3 Among HAIs, device-associated infections pose the greatest threat to patient safety, particularly in the intensive care unit (ICU), 4 with higher rates observed in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), as reported by the International Nosocomial Infection Control Consortium (INICC) 36 in 2016. The pooled rate of central line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI) 37 in medicalsurgical ICUs of LMICs when compared to equivalent ICUs in the USA was found to be 4.1 vs. 0.8 per 1000 central line-days. Furthermore, the rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) 37 was 13.1 vs. 0.9 per 1000 ventilator-days and the rate of catheterassociated urinary tract infection (CAUTI) 37 was 5.07 vs. 1.7 per 1000 catheter-days, with similar device use in the LMICs and the USA (high income country). This increase in HAIs has led to an increase in hospital length of stay, the emergence of bacterial resistance, and increased expenditure of healthcare dollars around the world. 5 In response to the urgent need for infection prevention and control (IPC), as exemplified by the recent Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the World Health Organization (WHO) established a global IPC unit in 2016, which incorporates core elements of IPC structure, measures to combat antimicrobial resistance (AMR), and guidelines on the management of common HAIs such as surgical site infections (SSIs) and catheter-associated blood stream infections; this links up with the WHO Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) programme and with outbreak control. A decontamination and sterilization manual has also been published recently, along with a downloadable app. 6 In LMICs, IPC programmes targeting HAIs are frequently underdeveloped and sometimes non-existent. 7 The major challenges faced are not only due to limited financial resources, but also poorly placed and implemented systems, such as those for the purchase and distribution of supplies, management of health technology, cleaning/sanitation, and management of clinical waste. 8 In addition, most LMICs do not have robust national or structured local support to uphold IPC programmes. Given the scarcity of resources, infrastructure and low compliance by healthcare workers, the implementation of adequate infection control activities including the protection of healthcare workers and visitors remains a significant challenge.",

Similarly, the national Chilean IPC programme is mandatory for all hospitals including both public and private healthcare facilities.

Although these references may be useful, IPC practice may not be consistent on a national scale. In Nepal, an IPC reference manual exists but is used for training purposes and not for national regulations. Thus, IPC practices may differ throughout the country.",

In Kenya, which has a rather robust IPC programme, inadequate laboratory capacity for diagnostics and underdeveloped medical records systems impede consistent IPC surveillance and data generation. IPC is nationally recognized in South Africa, yet structured IPC career opportunities are non-existent. Representatives from both Chile and Venezuela noted the lack of timely and consistent communication between healthcare facilities with regards to IPC matters. In Nepal, IPC programmes are expensive and do not provide immediate financial benefits and thus are not considered a priority in healthcare facilities. Lastly, in Cambodia, Jamaica, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, financial support continues to be a limiting factor for IPC programme implementation.",

            "text": "The recent literature suggests various strategies to assist in the prevention of HAIs, including the implementation of bundles and other infection control measures. The INICC is a non-profit organization established in 15 developing countries to reduce infection rates in resource-limited hospitals by focusing on education and feedback from outcome surveillance (infection rates) and process surveillance (adherence to infection control measures). This consortium has described a multidimensional approach to infection prevention that has resulted in a significant reduction in HAIs when implemented in various LMICs, both in the adult population and the paediatric population. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] To improve IPC implementation and evaluation efforts in LMICs, educational resources should be simplified, readily available, free of charge, and possibly include graded recommendations from basic through intermediate to advanced levels of IPC provision and resource. Ideally, there must be practices in place to evaluate the effectiveness of these graded measures in a given work environment. Such evaluation, as well as innovative measures for IPC that can more easily be applied in the LMIC setting, could be supported by the ISID research grant programme (http://www.isid.org/ grants/grants_research.shtml) or other initiatives that support capacity building in LMICs. The ISID Guide to Infection Control in the Hospital serves as a free resource for IPC programme recommendations and improving programme implementation efforts. Future editions of this guide may be applied as an evidence-based, multimodal, point-of-care mobile resource to assist in the prioritization and implementation of local infection prevention strategies. Another important resource is the INICC multidimensional infection control approach.",
