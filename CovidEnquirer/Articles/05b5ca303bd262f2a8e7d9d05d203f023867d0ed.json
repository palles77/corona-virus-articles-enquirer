            "text": "Abstract. The mechanism by which yeast dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (DPAP) A, a type II integral membrane protein, is retained in the late Golgi apparatus has been investigated. Prior work demonstrated that the ll8-amino acid cytoplasmic domain is both necessary and sufficient for Golgi retention and that mutant or overexpressed DPAP A no longer retained in the Golgi was delivered directly to the vacuolar membrane (Roberts, C. J., S. F. Nothwehr, and T. H. Stevens. 1992. J. Cell Biol. 119:69-83) . Replacement of the DPAP A transmembrane domain with a synthetic hydrophobic sequence did not affect either Golgi retention of DPAP A or vacuolar delivery of the retentiondefective form of DPAP A. These results indicate that the DPAP A transmembrane domain is not involved in either Golgi retention or targeting of this membrane protein. A detailed mutational analysis of the cyto-plasmic domain of DPAP A indicated that the most important elements for retention were within the eight residue stretch 85-92. A 10-amino acid region from DPAP A (81-90) was sufficient for Golgi retention of alkaline phosphatase, a type II vacuolar membrane protein. Detailed mutational analysis within this 10-amino acid sufficient region demonstrated that a Phe-X-Phe-X-Asp motif was absolutely required for efficient retention. The efficiency of Golgi retention via the DPAP A signal could be diminished by overexpression of wild type but not retention-defective versions of Kex2p, another late Golgi membrane protein, suggesting that multiple Golgi membrane proteins may be retained by a common machinery. These results imply a role for a cytoplasmic signal involving aromatic residues in retention of late Golgi membrane proteins in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.",

Sorting decisions made in the Golgi are dependent on positive signals on the proteins being sorted that specify their ultimate location. Proteins not containing positive sorting information will travel through and exit from the Golgi with the bulk flow of lipid via the default pathway. Therefore, proteins that execute their function within the ER or Golgi must have positive signals to specify retention within these organelles. For example, soluble resident proteins of the ER are known to be retained via the four amino acid sequence, K/HDEL, at the COOH terminus (for review see Pelham, 1989) . Receptor proteins that recognize this signal and aid in retaining these proteins in the ER have been identified. In addition, retention signals on ER membrane proteins have also been identified and, thus far, appear to consist of short peptide sequences on the cytoplas-Please address all correspondence to Dr. Tom H.

In animal cells, membrane protein retention in the cis and medial regions of the Golgi is usually specified by portions of the protein that include the transmembrane domain. Interestingly, the transmembrane domains of the E1 viral glycoprotein (Swift and Machamer, 1991) and galactosyltransferase (Aoki et al., 1992) have been shown to contain uncharged polar residues that appear particularly important for Golgi retention. TGN38, a membrane protein that localizes predominantly to the TGN (Luzio et al., 1990) and cycles between the TGN and the plasma membrane (Reaves et al., 1993) contains a cytoplasmic signal that is both necessary and sufficient for TGN localization (Humphrey et al., 1993) . Therefore, the mechanism of membrane protein retention in the TGN may be fundamentally different from that of other subcompartments within the Golgi.",

            "text": "Of the yeast Golgi membrane proteins examined thus far, all are retained via their cytoplasmic domains. Our laboratory has focused on the mechanism of targeting and retention of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (DPAP) I A, a type II yeast Golgi membrane protein (i.e., NH2-terminal cytoplasmic domain, single membrane anchor, and a large lumenal domain). DPAP A is one of three resident Golgi proteases (along with Kexlp and Kex2p) that process the secreted mating pheromone u-factor (Fuller et al., 1988) in a late Golgi compartment (Julius et al., 1984; Graham and Emr, 1991; Roberts et al., 1992) . Previous work has shown that the ll8-amino acid cytoplasmic domain of DPAP A is necessary and sufficient for its retention in the Golgi apparatus (Roberts et al., 1992) . Mutations in the cytoplasmic domain of DPAP A, as well as overproduction of the protein, resulted in its mislocalization to the vacuole, not the plasma membrane. These observations, along with the fact that no single domain of the vacuolar membrane protein, DPAP B, was required for vacuolar targeting, led us to propose the vacuolar default model for membrane protein sorting in the yeast secretory pathway (Roberts et al., 1990 (Roberts et al., , 1992 . This model states that no sorting information is required for transport of membrane proteins to the vacuole, and positive sorting information is required for nonvacuolar membrane proteins to stay out of the vacuole. Consistent with this model are the observations that the cytoplasmic domains of Kexlp (Cooper and Bussey, 1992) and Kex2p (Fuller et al., 1989; Wilcox et al., 1992) are necessary for Golgi retention and that nonretained Kexlp and Kex2p are mislocalized to the vacuolar membrane. It is important to note that the vacuolar default model does not apply to soluble proteins of the yeast secretory pathway, which are known to be secreted by default (Burgess and Kelly, 1987; Pelham, 1989) .",

We previously demonstrated that a deletion of residues 85-106 in the cytoplasmic domain of DPAP A resulted in its delivery to the vacuolar membrane (Roberts et al., 1992) indicating that this domain is necessary for Golgi retention. While these data supported the hypothesis that the vacuole was the default destination for membrane proteins of the yeast secretory pathway, another possibility was that the transmembrane domain contained a \"cryptic\" vacuolar targeting signal, which directed the mutant protein to the vacuole in the absence of Golgi retention. To distinguish between these models, the transmembrane domain of wild-type DPAP A and of A85-106-AAA (Roberts et al., 1992) were replaced with a 21 residue synthetic hydrophobic sequence, X = L(LALV)s, resulting in the A-X-A and A85-106-A-X-A proteins ( Fig. 1 A) .

Immunoprecipitations of DPAP A, A85-106-AAA, A-X-A, and A85-106-A-X-A expressed from 2 #m plasmids were carried out using a polyclonal antibody against the luminal domain of DPAP A (Roberts et ai., 1992). Fig. 2 from DPAP A whereas the A85-106-AAA and A85-106-A-X-A mutants have a slightly greater mobility, consistent with a 22-amino acid deletion. Non-glycosylated DPAP A is reduced in size ~,5-kD compared to the glycosylated protein (Roberts et al., 1992) , therefore these results indicate that the mutant enzymes are translocated into the ER and receive carbohydrate modifications in the ER and Golgi similarly to DPAP A. To determine the cellular locations of the constructs, indirect immunofluorescence microscopy was performed using an anti-DPAP A antibody (Roberts et al., 1992) . Fig. 3 B shows that A-X-A, like DPAP A (Roberts et al., 1992 ; data not shown), is localized to discrete punctate patches in the cytoplasm distinct from the ER and vacuole and typical of the yeast Golgi apparatus . Comparison of this staining pattern with that of the 60-kD vacuolar proton-translocating ATPase (V-ATPase) subunit ( Fig. 3 C) , a marker for the yeast vacuolar membrane (Yamashiro et al., 1990) , demonstrates that the location of A-X-A is nonvacuolar. A-X-A exhibited a Golgi staining pattern in 100% of the cells examined, and was found on the vacuolar membrane in <1% of cells ( domain of DPAP A does not appear to be involved in its retention in the Golgi other than acting as a membrane anchor. In addition, the A-X-A protein complemented a stel3A strain for processing of the u-factor mating pheromone demonstrating that it was correctly folded and in the correct Golgi compartment (data not shown). In contrast to the Golgi localization of A-X-A, ARS-106-A-X-A exhibited a vacuolar membrane staining pattern (Fig. 3 , compare panels E and F) indistinguishable from that of A85-106-AAA (Roberts et al,, 1992 ). A85-106-A-X-A decorated the vacuolar membrane in 100% of the cells examined and in a small percentage of cells (11%) was also localized to the Golgi apparatus. These data show that mislocalization of DPAP A to the vacuole as caused by the A85-106 mutation occurs norreally when the transmembrane domain is replaced with a synthetic hydrophobic sequence, demonstrating that transport to the vacuole does not require a specific signal within this domain.",

A hybrid membrane protein was constructed to characterize the retention signal within the liB-amino acid cytoplasmic domain in more detail. This A-ALP fusion protein consisted of the cytoplasmic domain of DPAP A fused to the transmembrane and luminal domains of alkaline phosphatase (ALP; Klionsky and Emr, 1990) , a type II integral membrane protein of the vacuole (Fig. 1 B) . ALP contains a \u20223-kD propeptide at its COOH terminus, which is removed in a manner dependent on protease A, the product of the PEP4 gene (Ammerer et al., 1986) , indicating that this modification occurs within the vacuole (Klionsky and Emr, 1989) . Therefore, this PEP4-dependent cleavage event can be used as an assay for vacuolar delivery of A-ALP. In addition, unlike DPAP A, A-ALP can be analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy when expressed from the endogenous STEJ3 promotor on a single-copy, CEN plasmid, thereby avoiding the necessity to overproduce the protein.",

Immunolocalization experiments showed that A-ALP exhibits a cytoplasmic punctate staining pattern (Fig. 4 A) that is distinct from the vacuolar staining pattern obtained using a monoclonal antibody against the 60-kD V-ATPase subunit and distinct from wild-type ALP (see below). The staining pattern of A-ALP was indistinguishable from the staining pattern observed for the Golgi membrane proteins DPAP A (Roberts et al., 1992) , Kex2p , and Kexlp (Cooper and Bussey, 1992) . As a direct test of whether A-ALP is localized to the same Golgi structures as Kex2p, double-labeling experiments were carded out to simultaneously detect the two antigens. Fig. 4 A shows representative cells expressing both A-ALP and Kex2p, where Kex2p was overexpressed (*15-fold) by placing the KEX2 gene under the control of the GAL/promoter to aid in its visualization. This level of KEX2 overexpression does not qualitatively affect its localization . Comparison of the Kex2p staining pattern with that of A-ALP revealed (Fig. 4 A) striking overlap of the staining patterns for the two antigens. Quantitation of the immunofluorescence data (for details see Materials and Methods) indicated that 97 % of the cells that stain for both antigens exhibited extensive colocalization. Thus, the data indicate that the vast majority of A-ALP colocalizes with Kex2p, a marker for the yeast Golgi apparatus (Redding et ai., 1991) .",

            "text": "A series of deletions were made in the cytoplasmic domain of DPAP A (in the context of the A-ALP fusion protein) to identify the region responsible for its retention in the Golgi (Fig. 1 C) . The A-ALP deletion mutants were expressed in a phoSA strain and localized by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. In accordance with the vacuolar default model for membrane protein sorting in yeast (Roberts et al., 1992) , the deletion mutants that failed to be retained in the Golgi were delivered to the vacuolar membrane rather than to the cell surface. Table I shows quantitation of the immunolocalization data focusing on the percentage of cells that exhibit vacuolar staining. As indicated in Fig. 4 , wildtype A-ALP exhibited a Golgi staining pattern, with very few cells (<1%) exhibiting vacuolar membrane staining. Removal of residues 2-51 or even 2-80 within the ll8-amino acid cytoplasmic domain had little effect on localization of A-ALP. However, deletion of 20 additional residues (A2-100) resulted in dramatic mislocalization of A 2-100-A-ALP to the vacuole, as the anti-ALP antibody decorated the vacuolar membrane in 100% of the stained cells examined. The residues immediately adjacent to the transmembrane domain were not required for retention since the A109-116-A-ALP protein exhibited essentially wild-type localization. Removal of residues 68-106, as well as the smaller deletion A85-106, prevented retention in the Golgi apparatus. The observation that the 22-amino acid deletion (A85-106) resulted in as severe a mislocalization phenotype (99% of cells exhibiting vacuolar staining) as removal of almost the entire cytoplasmic tail (A2-100, 100%) suggested that the most important elements of the retention signal were within this region. To define region 85-106 further, three smaller deletions (A85-92, A92-99, and A99-106) were analyzed. The A85-92-A-ALP protein was mislocalized to the vacuole (100% of cells * Each construct was analyzed in SF838-1D-8A2 cells (pho8A, pep4-3) contaning CEN-based plasmids encoding either wild-type or mutant A-ALP proteins (see Materials and Methods for detailed description of plasmids). The cells were fixed, spheroplasted, and costained with rabbit anti-ALP and mouse anti-60-kD V-ATPase subunit, and analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy as described in Materials and Methods. Staining for all constructs was apparent in at least 90% of the cells examined, and of these stained cells at least 100 cells were quantified. \u00a2 The percentages refer to the percent of cells that exhibit significant vacuolar staining for each protein. Vacuolar staining was scored by comparing the staining pattern of each construct in a given cell with the pattern obtained using an antibody against the 60-kD V-ATPase subunit, a marker for the vacuolar membrane (see Materials and Methods). Depending on the protein being analyzed, other staining patterns such as Golgi staining were sometimes observed rather than (or in addition to) vacuolar staining.",

            "text": "In mammalian cells, there is much evidence that aromatic residues in the cytoplasmic domains of membrane proteins can act as sorting signals for clustering into coated pits (for review see Trowbridge, 1991) . Therefore, it was intriguing that there were two phenylalanine residues at positions 85 and 87 within the eight amino stretch found to be essential for Golgi retention of A-ALP. To test whether the phenylalanine residues at positions 85 and 87, and the intervening nonaromatic glutamine residue at position 86, were important for retention, extensive site saturation mutagenesis was performed at each of these three positions, The mutant A-ALP hybrids were analyzed by monitoring the kinetics of PEP4-dependent processing, enzymatic activity, as well as indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. Cells expressing either wild-type A-ALP or the mutant protein with F85 substituted by alanine (F85A-A-ALP) were pulse-labeled with 35S for 30 min and chased for the indicated times (Fig. 6) . After a 60-min chase, no processing was detected for wildtype A-ALP whereas processing of the F85A-A-ALP protein was evident at the beginning of the chase period and was ~50% complete by 60-min of chase. Processing of the F85A-A-ALP hybrid protein, which was completely PEP4- . Each strain was 3sS-labcled for 15 rain and chased for 0, 20, 60, and 180 rain, spheroplasted, lysed,and subjected to immunoprecipitation using an anti-ALP antibody. The percent processing at each time point was quantified by scanning SDS-PAGE gels with an AMBIS Redioanalytic Imaging System and the half-time was determined by linear regression analysis. For proteins having <20% processing after a 180-min chase or proteins having no detectable processing at the 180-rain time point, the half-time of processing was expressed as \">180\" or by ~no processing,\" respectively. teins containing amino acid replacements at positions 85, 86, or 87 (Table II) . No processing of wild-type A-ALP was detected after 3 h of chase while every amino acid replacement at positions 85 and 87 caused processing to occur with half times that ranged from 55 to 165 min. Replacing both phenylalanines with alanines (A85,A87-A-ALP; t~a of 70 min) did not decrease the half time of processing as compared with replacing F85 or F87 alone (t~ of 70 and 55, respectively), nor did the double replacement increase the already severe mislocalization defect of the F85A-A-ALP (Fig. 5 ) and F87A-A-ALP (Table I; 96% of cells show vacuolar staining) mutants as judged by immunofluorescence microscopy. Whereas there appears to be a specific requirement for a phenylalanine at position 85, position 87 is somewhat less strict since a tyrosine or valine substitution exhibited a less severe phenotype than the other residues tested. In contrast to replacement of F85 and F87, replacements for Q86 had little if any affect on Golgi retention as judged by the extremely slow rates of processing. While these data suggest that the most critical element of the retention signal consists ofa Phe-X-Phe motif, it is possible that amino acids surrounding this sequence are also important for retention. To test this possibility, alanine scanning mutagenesis was carded out at positions 81-84 and 88-90 (Table HI) Table II. and F87A mutations, did result in a half-time of processing of 105 min indicating that D89 is also important for Golgi retention of A-ALP.",

No processing was observed in the presence of normal Kex2p levels but when wild-type Kex2p was overproduced (,M5-fold) a significant fraction of the A-ALP protein underwent PEP4-dependent processing (29%). However, the same level of overproduction of retention-defective mutant versions of Kex2p (Wilcox et al., 1992) lacking a critical tyrosine residue (Y713A) or the entire cytoplasmic tail (C-tailA; removes residues 702-814) resulted in greatly diminished levels of A-ALP reaching the vacuole (8 and <3% processing, respectively). Thus, A-ALP was less efficiently retained in the Golgi when wild type but not mutant Kex2p was overproduced, suggesting that the cytoplasmic retention signals of the two proteins may be recognized by the same retention machinery.",

This observation, which contrasts with studies in mammalian cells demonstrating that several Golgi membrane proteins are retained via their transmembrane domains (Machamer, 1991) , indicates that Golgi retention signals can reside in cytoplasmic or transmembrane domains.

Finally, removal of almost the entire cytoplasmic domain of A-ALP (A2-100-A-ALP) resulted in its delivery to the vacuole, and thus it is unlikely that the DPAP A cytoplasmic domain contains both a Golgi retention signal and a cryptic vacuolar targeting signal. We conclude that vacuolar delivery of DPAP A protein not retained in the Golgi is not a signal mediated event and thus occurs by default.",

In addition, mislocalization of mutant DPAP A to the vacuolar membrane does not occur via transport to the plasma membrane followed by subsequent uptake from the plasma membrane to the vacuole. This was demonstrated for the A22-AA-B protein (Roberts et al., 1992) and for F85A-A-ALP (Nothwehr, S., and T.

However, at position 87 the large aliphatic and aromarie substitutions (Val and Tyr) were not as severe as the others (Ala, Cys, Gly), suggesting that more variability is allowed at this position. Simultaneous replacement of F85 or F87 with alanines did not increase the severity of the phenotype of the F85A-or F87A-A-ALP mutant proteins suggesting that the phenylalanines do not act in an independent, additive fashion for retention. Rather, these data suggest that they form a single structural motif recognized by the yeast Golgi retention machinery. Alanine scanning mutagenesis of the entire 10-amino acid region (81-90) indicated that no specific sequence information was required at positions 81-84, 86, 88, or 90; however an Asp residue at position 89 was required for efficient retention. Additional mutational analysis will be needed to determine whether there is a specific requirement for an Asp residue at position 89 or whether other residues will function at this position. At the least, these results demonstrate that in addition to a Phe-X-Phe motif, certain contextual sequences are also required.",

Comparison of the COOH-terminal cytoplasmic tail of Kex2p (type I) and the NH2-terminal tail of DPAP A (type II) reveals no obvious sequence similarity. However, a critical dement of the Kex2p Golgi retention signal has recently been shown to be a q~yr residue at position 713 of the cytoplasmic tail (Wilcox et al., 1992) . Interestingly, a phenylalanine residue is present at position 715 (YEF715). While the role of F715 in Kex2p localization has not been tested, comparison suggests that a general element for Golgi retention of yeast membrane proteins may be (Y/F-X-Y/F). The fact that DPAP A and Kex2p have different membrane orientations would not rule out identical retention mechanisms since clathrin-coated pit signals of membrane bound receptors are able to function equally well irrespective of their orientation with the membrane (Collawn et al., 1991; Jadot et al., 1992) . Although the above data are consistent with DPAP A and Kex2p having retention signals that are recognized by the same trans-acting factor, the preference for phenylalanine over tyrosine in the DPAP A signal would appear to be at odds with this interpretation. It is possible that there are separate components that recognize each signal, but that there are other more generic components that are shared in the retention of each protein. Alternatively, the dependence of the DPAP A signal on phenylalanine may be a result of the context of this signal.",

Beyond the aromatic residue requirement, most of the coated signals reveal little if any primary sequence similarity to each other or to the Phe-X-Phe-X-Asp retention motif of DPAP A. An exception is the internalization signal of bovine cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor, which was demonstrated by Canfield et al.

According to this model, DPAP A may be constitutively transported to the plasma membrane, endocytosed via interaction of its \"retention signal\" with clathrincoated pits, and returned to the Golgi. This type of model is consistent with the observation that disruption of the clathrin heavy chain gene (CHC1) resulted in mislocalization of a significant pool of Kex2p and DPAP A to the plasma membrane rather than the vacuole (Payne and Schekman, 1989; Seeger and Payne, 1992) . However, much data argues against this model. The localization of A-ALP (Nothwehr, S., and T. Stevens, unpublished data), Kexlp (Cooper and Bussey, 1992) , and Kex2p (Redding et al., 1992) are not affected by blocking secretory vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane (secl-ts mutation). Furthermore, this model would predict that removal of Golgi retention information would cause DPAP A to accumulate at the cell surface. We have found that neither wild-type nor retention-defective DPAP A accumulate at the cell surface as judged by the immunofluorescence experiments presented here and by enzymatic activity measurements (Roberts et al., 1992; Nothwehr, S., and T. Stevens, unpublished data) .",

            "text": "Nevertheless, the important observation of a role for clathrin in the retention of DPAP A (Seeger and Payne, 1992) combined with our identification of an aromatic residue Golgi retention signal in the cytoplasmic domain of DPAP A, strongly suggest that coated vesicle structures are somehow involved in its retention. The data are consistent with a retrieval model for Golgi membrane protein retention similar to that proposed for soluble ER proteins (Pelham et al., 1989 ). In this model, DPAP A protein may leave the Golgi via the default pathway for membrane proteins that eventually leads to the vacuole. Before reaching the vacuole, DPAP A may pass through a \"prevacuolar compartment, wherein it interacts with clathrin-coated structures and is transported back to the late Golgi compartment via transport vesicles. In animal cells, the interaction of the cytoplasmiccoated pit signals with the clathrin coat is thought to be mediated by specific interactions with an \"adaptor\" complex (Pearse, 1988; Glickman et al., 1989; Beltzer and Spiess, 1991) and putative adaptor subunit homologues have been found in yeast (Kirchhausen, 1990) . By interaction with clathrin coat proteins, DPAP A in the prevacuolar compartment could be packaged into clathrin-coated vesicles bound for the Golgi. In the absence of the clathrin heavy chain, the retrieval system may become less specific and the vesicles may eventually fuse with the plasma membrane. Mutant DPAP A lacking a retrieval signal would not bind clathrin coat proteins and would be transported via the default pathway from the prevacuolar compartment to the vacuole (for additional discussion, see Seeger and Payne, 1992; Wilcox et al., 1992) . While such a role for clathrin-coated vesicles fits with all of the results in yeast, results from an in vitro assay (Draper et al., 1990) suggest that clathrin-coated vesicles are not involved in the recycling of the mannose 6-phosphate receptor from a prelysosomal compartment back to the TGN in animal cells.",

However, recently our laboratory has demonstrated that a subset of the vps mutants, which are defective in vacuolar protein sorting, accumulates a vacuolar-like organelle adjacent to the vacuole (Raymond et al., 1992) . This organelle shares similarity with the vacuole in that it contains the V-ATPase and soluble vacuolar hydrolases such as carboxypeptidase Y and protease A. However, the organelle also contains a significant pool of A-ALP, with the rest being located in the Golgi. Therefore, it is possible that wild-type cells contain a prevacuolar compartment and DPAP A passes through it as part of its retrieval system. An exciting possibility is that retrograde trafficking of vesicles (containing DPAP A) from this compartment back to the Golgi is partially blocked in these mutants.",

The static system might also recognize features of the cytoplasmic tail of DPAP A distinct from the retention signal containing aromatic residues. This model might explain why the kinetics of vacuolar delivery of mutant forms of A-ALP lacking the aromatic residue signal is somewhat slower (55 min for F87A-A-ALP) than the processing half time of A-ALP lacking most of its cytoplasmic domain (25 min for A2-100-A-ALP; Nothwehr, S., and T. Stevens, unpublished data) and that of wild-type ALP (5 min; Klionsky and Emr, 1989) . In any event, it is clear that the aromatic residue signal is an important determinant for yeast Golgi retention and further work will be needed to identify other elements within the DPAP A cytoplasmic domain, if any, that influence retention.",
