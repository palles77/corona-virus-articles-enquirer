Typically, researchers focus on people with clinical pain, or on healthy participants undergoing laboratory-controlled paininduction techniques focussed mostly on exogenously generated skin nociception. Less commonly investigated are acute pain experiences that emerge naturally. Six common painful complaints were identified: headache, muscular pain, visceral pain, menstrual pain, dental pain, and pain associated with upper respiratory tract infection. Methods used to recruit participants with the natural occurrence of each pain complaint were identified, and features of their use reviewed. Also reviewed were experimental analogues designed to mimic these pains, with the exception of menstrual pain. Headache and menstrual pain appear to be most effectively researched in their naturally occurring form, whereas muscle and dental pain may be more easily induced. Upper respiratory tract infection and abdominal pain provide further challenges for researchers. Summary guidance is offered, and directions for methods development outlined.",

Popular and well-validated techniques include exposure to exogenous thermal, mechanical, chemical, and electrocutaneous stimulation (eg, [25, 31, 48, 119] ). The relative merits and challenges of each approach have been considered extensively elsewhere (eg, [91] ). Controlled nociceptive stimulation techniques used in the laboratory often produce very brief and spatially distinct stimuli. Most techniques are delivered exogenously and are focussed on skin nociceptor activation. Naturally occurring pain is often endogenous, of longer duration, can be diffuse, and typically involves multiple pain systems. Additionally, the experimenter introduction of pain is normally done to ethical standards that mitigate the threat of the pain, fundamentally altering the emotional and motivational significance of pain, arguably a key feature of pain that emerges naturally [20] . There are many benefits of standard laboratory techniques, not least their well validated performance and stable replication across settings and populations. The cost of such control, however, is the potential lack of relevance to naturally occurring pain [90, 92] . The methodological challenge is to recruit people with the pain of interest or to develop techniques that combine the benefits of laboratory control with the relevance of pain that emerges naturally.",

We first included sampling methods in which people with pain of interest are recruited into studies. Second, because it is not always possible to recruit people with pain, we investigated analogue methods of pain production. Analogues are defined as techniques developed explicitly to mimic pain, in which the resulting pain is judged to be the same as, or close to, that which might naturally occur. We excluded from our investigation the laboratory methods of pain induction that are not common, naturally occuring human pain experiences (eg, electrical pain induction, cold pressor, thermal plate induction). Here we are interested to capture and critically appraise innovations in methods that can be used in the study of pain that emerges, occurs, or is delivered in everyday environments.",

We were not concerned with the primary results of the studies reported, only in the operation of their methods. As our goal was to focus on common painful conditions, we selected headache, muscular pain, visceral (abdominal) pain, menstrual pain, and dental pain. We also included pain associated with upper respiratory tract infections, for example, ''sore throat'' [121, 122] .",

These typically fell into 1 of 4 approaches: (1) identifying those with the relevant pain, for example, from locations where people seek analgesia; (2) identifying those about to experience the pain, for example, those scheduled to undertake painful nonclinical procedures; (3) identifying people at risk of pain, for example, recruiting those who report frequent complaints such as headache; or (4) by recruiting a normal sample of people and following them moment to moment, recording pain episodes as they arise [114] . These approaches were appraised in terms of ease and effectiveness within each condition. For the pain induction analogue part of the review, methods were considered where there was any systematic attempt to experimentally control or induce one of the 6 naturally occurring pain conditions. These can involve inducing the exact pain under investigation, as in pains that arise from exertion, or those studies that were designed to be close to the naturally occurring experience.",

Such approaches have traditionally been difficult to administer, and participant withdrawal or loss from protocol is high. However, recent technological developments in mobile computing [55] and increased use of Ecological Momentary Analysis (EMA) have meant that it is possible to administer core tests remotely, at the point at which pain begins. EMA is a diary-based method in which target events are recorded either when they occur or at a particular time [100] . For example, Kikuchi et al. [56] asked chronic headache sufferers to complete watch-triggered electronic diaries 4 times a day for 7 days, with additional entries being made for headache events. Of the 44 participants recruited, 4 did not complete the entries well enough to be included in the analysis, suggesting that the intensive nature of the method, even in short duration, can lead to attrition.",

Within 24 hours this technique had induced a tension-type headache in 60% of tension-type headache sufferers and 20% of controls. Similarly, Neufeld et al. [79] instructed participants to perform tooth clenching for 3 10-minute periods. Within 20 hours this technique had induced a tension-type headache in 50% of tension-type headache sufferers and 30% of controls, with the peak time for headache in controls being at 2 hours postinduction. Whilst these studies appear to indicate that induction of headache pain is possible, the percentage of participants who experienced headache as a result of these protocols was small (20%-30%). In addition, the time between induction and maximal headache sensation was at least 2 hours and as much as 24 hours. Pragmatically, this makes these techniques difficult to use because their unpredictable timing and effectiveness are prohibitive. It also seems as if headache induction is less easily achieved using these approaches in nonheadache sufferers.",

Another example of headache induction can be seen in studies that report headache as an adverse effect of certain drugs [95] . Interestingly, some pharmacologically induced headaches seem to be clinically indistinguishable from spontaneous migraine [44] . This approach has been utilized mostly within studies that pharmacologically induce migraines within migraine sufferers. For example, Kruuse et al. [64] administered sildenafil to patients with a history of migraine. Sildenafil resulted in a migraine similar to the participants' usual migraine in 10 of the 12 participants, whereas only 2 of the 12 participants experienced a migraine after the placebo. Others have examined withdrawal headache following chronic caffeine usage, which is of interest given that this drug has analgesic properties [93] . This suggests that a drug-induction procedure may be more successful than muscular techniques for experimentally inducing headache, although this is untested.",

Although those who purchase may not necessarily be those who require treatment and may not be in pain at the time, this may be worth further investigation, especially in light of recent technological developments that allow for remote measurement. In terms of developing experimental analogues of headache, techniques of pain induction have been developed, but with variable success.

Indeed, a number of risk factors have been identified for musculoskeletal pain, including poor trunk muscle strength, depression, preexisting musculoskeletal pain, and increased spine mobility [67] . Rarely used, and worthy of further exploration, is the recruitment of populations at risk of sports-related muscle pain. For example, an estimated 36,000 people ran the 2012 26.2-mile London marathon, with similar numbers running the New York marathon. One study estimated that 419,000 people finished marathons in the United States in 1998, and predicted that figures will increase to almost 700,000 people by 2010 [12] . Given a dropout rate in training reported to be 30%-50%, with the most common reason being injury [14, 26] , recruiting from mass-involvement amateur sports events such as running races can be a useful technique. We know of only one study to use such a strategy; they tested the efficacy of acetaminophen on muscle soreness post marathon running and successfully recruited over 600 participants [83] .",

This not only resulted in muscle soreness, lower pressure pain thresholds, and a decrease in maximum isometric contraction force, but was sensitive to moderation from a pre-trial vibrotactile stimulation. A similar design was used by Blacker et al. [5] , who asked participants to walk for 2 hours carrying a 25-kg backpack at 6.5 km/h. This resulted in a significant decrease in maximum force contraction, however, data for pain levels were not reported. These studies suggest that there are a number of potential exercise methods for inducing DOMS experimentally. While exercise-induced pain may seem a good model of muscle pain, there are some issues to consider. For example, Graven-Neilsen and Arendt-Neilsen [32] note that there is often no pain at rest and so, either an external pressure stimulus or further exercise is needed to restart the pain sensation. Additionally, the method of exerciseinduced pain relies on participants exerting maximal force as a standardisation measure, making inter-participant comparison difficult.",

By placement of an electrode over the posterior tibial nerve and stimulating at a maximum tolerable level, significant muscle cramp can be induced [109] . Mechanical stimulation methods using pressure can also be applied in a reproducible fashion to a specific site [25, 48] .

Additionally, through consistent infusion, a repeatable sensation can be achieved. It is also possible to induce muscle cramps by injection of glutamate into myofascial trigger points, which is not present with isotonic saline [29] . The disadvantages associated with this technique include a lack of control over the timing of the pain, with hypertonic saline resulting in a few minutes of pain. Induced muscular heat pain has also been suggested as a method for pain induction by either injection of heated isotonic saline [33] or focused ultrasound [16, 125] .

Bradette et al. [9] also examined upper GI stimulation by inserting a balloon at the gastric side of the lower oesophageal sphincter, which was found to successfully induce pain in both patients and healthy participants. These techniques seem to be particularly useful for those interested in studying sensations of fullness, pressure, and general pain. Other GI pain sensations, such as those commonly associated with acid reflux, have been developed. For example, Hammer and Vogelsang [37] suggested using capsaicin to improve gastric models of induced pain. They infused capsaicin into either the mid duodenum or jejuna, where discomfort was reported after 8.9 minutes and 15.8 minutes, respectively. The infusion of capsaicin resulted in a qualitatively different pain sensation, with greater stinging, warmth, and cramps being reported. These upper and lower GI distension studies succeed in inducing an internal dull sensation, which may provide a good model for visceral pain. The challenges of this approach, however, are that they are invasive and require expertise and specialist equipment. In addition, participant recruitment can be adversely affected by the embarrassing nature of some techniques.",

Increased pain was found in both healthy children and those with abdominal pain conditions. This method appears to induce pain that has a quality similar to recurrent abdominal pain. This pain/discomfort, however, is not very intense and lasts only a short time, making this an unappealing method for pain induction. An adult version of water loading has been reported, in an analogue of bladder pain [70] . Participants were asked to drink 250 mL of water every 15 minutes until they were unable to resist the urge to urinate. After each 15-minute period, participants were asked to rate their desire to void, pain, and discomfort. This technique was successful in inducing a pain sensation in participants; however, the time to reach this peak pain was, on average, 2 hours and 20 minutes.",

This has been particularly useful in that studies have been able to exploit the regularity of pain by examining participants at different phases of the menstrual cycle, and from this, making predictions about the potential role that sex hormones may have in mediating pain. Although menstrual pain is common and predictable, there are a number of methodological issues that need to be carefully considered [88, 99] . For example, cycle lengths vary between women, with average durations ranging from 22 to 32 days [99] . Therefore, it is important to be able to accurately predict phase when testing, especially if trying to combine data from various participants. Estimates of cycle of phase are notoriously inaccurate, and often are based on a combination of self-estimates and counting of days since last menstruation. Recently, advances in mobile communication, and the development of applications to specifically record and predict phase may have some utility in ensuring accurate estimate of phase [86] . Alternative strategies have been to take blood or urine samples to detect changes in sex hormone production around ovulation and menstruation. Home-ovulation detection devices provide an easy noninvasive alternative to blood plasma sampling.",

This pain is often poorly localised, and patients often struggle to identify within 2-3 teeth of the damaged region [97] . The incident rates of these types of pain are also high, with some estimates suggesting that 15% of adults experience oral-facial pain (toothache, oral sores, jaw pain, face pain, or burning mouth) within any given 6-month period [72] , and more recent estimates suggesting that 17.7% of individuals may experience dental pain within a 6-month period [4] .

However, we found no examples of population or at-risk studies. This is perhaps unsurprising given that dental pain is relatively slow to materialise, and so predict. An alternative method of risk identification has been to recruit from groups likely to have some form of dental intervention that will result in pain. Indeed, given the frequency of dental procedures that are painful (eg, third molar extraction, periodontal interventions), the recruitment of participants prior to procedure is common (eg [73] ), and third molar extraction is considered by some the industry standard for the evaluation of analgesic medication [118] . For example, Malmstrom et al. [73] included adults who were scheduled to have a minimum of 2 third molars removed, with at least one partially embedded in the mandibular bone. There is also evidence of the use of nonsurgical periodontal therapy as a model of dental pain. For example, Sullivan and Neish [111] recruited 80 students into a study in exchange for which they received free dental hygiene treatment. This resulted in moderate pain ratings from participants, especially those who scored high on pain catastrophizing measures. Ettlin et al. [22] also recruited participants with mild-to-moderate periodontitis attending a dental clinic in Switzerland. This resulted in a mild-to-moderate pain level in participants. One disadvantage to this approach is that it took almost a year to recruit 64 participants. The advantages of this approach are that it is possible to ''standardize'' the intervention, as well as predict when the painful episodes are likely to occur.",

For example, Bowley and Gale [8] examined 5 competing methods for inducing jaw pain, all of which are similar to muscle pain-induction techniques, as they involve the manipulation of jaw and facial musculature into particular positions, and then the hold and/or repetition of these positions. All 5 methods resulted in an induced pain sensation. The predicted time to develop pain was within a minute for 2 of the exercises and 2-3 hours for the remaining. Again, as with headache, these timings may be unsatisfactory, as the onset of this pain is often delayed, and with the exception of one exercise, these may result in jaw pain in a small proportion of participants. Additionally, the pain induced by these techniques is more musculoskeletal in nature rather than dental pain.",

[10] showed that 11 participants in their study were able to clearly distinguish between a pain and nonpain electrical stimulation applied to 1 or 2 teeth. The application of pain using an electrical pain stimulus provides a repeatable and reliable pain sensation. However, applying electrical stimuli to the tooth pulp requires participants to keep their mouths open in an unnatural position, which may result in additional pain outside of the pain of interest.",

There are also epidemiological methods for increasing the reliability of measuring influenza incidences [81] . To examine the effects of various common analgesics on sore throat, Schachtel et al.

These are interesting approaches, especially as it has been argued that pain has interruptive effects on human cognitive performance [77, 78] , and so the common cold/influenza could be used to specifically investigate the effects of pain. Although the above studies suggest that researching the common cold and sore throat in a naturally occurring presentation of these conditions is possible, there are a number of additional considerations.

Following an incubation period of 48-72 hours, participants who were infected began to show symptoms. These were objectively measured by assessment of sublingual temperature and quantity of nasal secretion.

First, both headache and menstrual pain appear to be most effectively researched in their naturally occurring form. These pains are both highly prevalent, and have standardised methods for recruitment and screening in a nonclinical context. By comparison, muscle and dental pain may be most easily investigated using either an induced analogue or procedural method. There is a range of induction analogues for muscular pains (eg, DOMS, electrical, pressure), which offer standardised pain protocols for creating pain that highly resembles naturally occurring pain. For dental pain, third molar extraction is the industry standard for testing analgesics [118] , and common methods have been described. Upper respiratory tract pain and visceral pain, however, present challenges to researchers. The naturally occurring forms of each of these conditions are either difficult to recruit because of lower incidences and a need for clinical input in diagnosis, or are seasonal. Additionally, experimental analogues are being developed but at present are novel, are in need of replication, or are highly invasive and so resource intensive.",

Practically, this means recruiting people from where they present when in pain, which are typically sites of analgesic purchase or delivery such as pharmacies and hospital emergency rooms. Some studies have successfully managed this recruitment (eg, [51, 52, 54, 82, 126] ), and appear to achieve populations homogenous on pain complaint, and heterogeneous on other demographic and biographical characteristics. However, we did not find any examples of recruitment strategies focussed on recruiting people in pain outside of clinical environments. We believe that these strategies are possible, as in the example of Table 1 Methods employed to recruit people with naturally occurring pain, or the use of analogues designed to mimic such pain. 50% at least 1 day within a year [113] 80% regular menstrual pain [18, 102] 17.7% within 6 months [4] 28.24% have oral lesions at any time [101] Average person between 1 and 3 periods of cold per year [40] Current pain Recruitment in pain has been conducted [38] as have EMA techniques [56] Recruitment of participants when they report for pain treatment [124] Participants have been recruited at the point they seek treatment [82] Recruitment of those in pain is viable for menstrual pain Third molar extraction [73] Root canal treatment [96] and periodontitis [22] Recruitment of people when in pain [103] [104] [105] or seeking treatment is common [94] At risk Frequent recruitment of those at risk of pain [43, 65, 98] No studies were found recruiting those ''at risk'', however, risk factors are known [14, 26] No evidence for at-risk recruitment those seeking analgesia following exercise, or following cosmetic procedures (eg, piercing, tattooing, depilation). Recruiting people whilst in pain provides both technical and ethical challenges, as it is not clear the extent to which people are able to consent to participation, especially if the study protocol requires temporarily withholding analgesia. What was found to be less common was recruiting participants ''at risk'' of developing acute pain. Although we found evidence of studies recruiting participants who suffer with recurrent headaches, and recruitment for menstrual pain studies can be seen to fit an ''at risk'' strategy, there was no evidence of this in other pain complaints. This is surprising given that risk factors are known for muscle pain [14, 26] and the identification of those ''at risk'' of pain complaints would appear to be an efficient method for recruiting participants for pain-related study.",

This is attractive because the pain is naturally occurring and many features of the procedures can be controlled experimentally. However, it should be noted that dental pain, despite being common, is not uncomplicated. For example, dentistry is associated with a high level of anxiety and fear (eg, [28, 36, 66] ) and often requires rescue analgesia (eg, [45] ). Other interesting procedural pain models have been attempted, such as postdural headache pain [117] , and it is possible to consider a number of other procedures that might provide additional pain models (eg, mammography and needle pain). Other nonclinical painful procedures associated with goals other than health are rarely investigated (eg, depilation, tattooing, piercing), and we found no standardized methods reported. These may be interesting to pursue, in particular because of the different psychological context of these procedures.",

            "text": "The alternative approach to recruitment of those in pain or likely to experience pain, is to experimentally induce the pain of interest. Standard methods have been developed in headache, some visceral pains, and some muscle pains. Perhaps the most developed are muscle pain protocols [32] . These methods are attractive as one has more control over experimental parameters that affect pain exposure (eg, time of onset), and can often measure the physical parameters of the method of pain insult (eg, pressure applied), and the pathophysiology of the pain is often better mapped. However, their performance is relatively sensitive to operator characteristics, and appropriate training is required [50] . The investment in infrastructure, training, and participant commitment should also not be underestimated. Overall, we judge that in most cases there are too few incidences of different laboratories and teams undertaking these methods to make reliable judgements as to their general value. It appears that recent uses of some methods are very promising. Work by Walker and colleagues [123] , for example, and by Lewis et al. [70] in re-introducing the water-load test is instructive. The method clearly adds valuable and unique insights, and is complementary to clinical studies. However, their success will have required significant scientific and organizational leadership. Cross-laboratory, perhaps international, collaboration will be necessary to produce standards and common protocols for these methods. Additionally, whereas the psychophysical parameters of other pain induction methods are well specified, these foundational investigations are still to be performed for the methods reviewed here.",

Not included here was any consideration of the pathophysiology of the pain under investigation. In part, this is due to the number and variety of techniques reviewed, but also due to the lack of clarity in many cases as to the exact physiological mechanism involved. Some pains are likely to be principally neuropathic, others inflammatory, and others still, a mixture (eg, third molar extraction). For each method, it would be instructive to research in detail the involvement of physiological mechanisms. This is particularly important given the presumed heterogeneity and combinatorial complexity of mechanism involvement in many of the methods reviewed. At present, for research in which it is important to know exactly the physiological mechanism underlying the pain experienced, many of these techniques will be inadmissible without further investigation.",

Standard laboratory paininduction techniques do not always need to be the first recourse. Second, although methods of recruitment are in common use, some variants of these methods deserve more investigation. In particular, rarely used are methods of working with people who undergo nonclinical common painful procedures, and those who are in predictable nonclinical pain from planned overexertion. Third, although there are some examples of real-time data capture using ecological momentary assessment, these remain rare. As mobile communication and sensor technology develops, the possibilities of these approaches have not yet been fully appreciated, and deserve serious attention. Finally, although some methods of inducing pain have achieved popularity and are in common use, other methods are used only infrequently and by a small number of groups. The field could benefit significantly by the increased use of methods by different research teams and attempts at establishing evidence-based consensus on protocols for pain induction.",
