            "text": "The transient formation of G4s under thermodynamically favorable conditions has important regulatory roles dictated by the genomic location. G4s are ubiquitously found in the telomeres of eukaryotes [4] . The formation of G4s by the G-rich telomeric repeats inhibits extension of telomeres by telomerase; thus stabilization of G4s in telomeres with ligands represents a potential anticancer strategy [5] . Nearly 50% of human genes have a G4 motif in their promoter region [6] . Importantly, oncogenes like c-Myc, VEGF [7] , and KRAS [8] are negatively regulated by their promoter-borne G4s [5] . G4 structures can also form in RNA. Quadruplexes formed in the 5 0 UTR of the mRNA inhibit cap-dependent translation (e.g., NRAS and BCL-2) and enhance IRES-mediated cap-independent translation (e.g., hVEG-F and FGF2) [9, 10] . Besides, G4s also influence other molecular mechanisms in RNA biology such as splicing, ribosomal frameshifting, mRNA localization, repeat-associated non-AUG (RAN) translation, and maturation of miRNAs (reviewed in [10] ). Furthermore, formation of an intermolecular hybrid quadruplex (HQ) between nontemplate DNA and nascent mRNA acts as a transcription-termination signal [10] . In addition to gene expression, the spatial association of quadruplex motifs with the recombination hotspots in the human genome implicates quadruplexes in recombination [11] .",

            "text": "Depending on the tissue environment, pathogens have specific surface adaptations, including pili, fimbriae (in bacteria) and host cell receptor-binding glycoproteins (in viruses and parasites), all of which enable entry into the host. The surface-exposed proteins are at the interface of host-microbe interaction and are highly antigenic. The surface proteins of some pathogens are continuously altered by antigenic and phase variation to overcome host adaptive immune responses. Besides sequence mutation and natural competence to DNA transformation [19] , the molecular basis of antigenic variation (Av) also involves recombination of genomic segments leading to the production of altered surface proteins [20] . Interestingly, G4 motifs have been identified at the recombination sites associated with Av in bacteria and parasites [21, 22] . indicate the types of microbe affected for each biological process (see the legend beside the graph). The specific microorganism under each type is denoted either by an abbreviation (for viruses) or a three-letter notation (for bacteria and parasites) in the vertical bars in the innermost circle (see the legend beside the graph). The vertical bars in the innermost circle are colour-coded for bacteria (green), viruses (red), and parasites (black). The curved lines connect a given microbe with multiple quadruplexregulated biological processes. Red curved lines connect viruses, and blue curved lines connect parasites. Intramolecular quadruplexes have been identified to play potential roles in the Av of (i) pilE in Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the bacterium that causes gonorrhea, (ii) vlsE in the Lyme disease agent Borrelia burgdorferi, and (iii) tprK in [ 3 1 6 _ T D $ D I F F ] Treponema pallidum [23] [24] [25] . Conventionally, Av by gene conversion involves the unidirectional transfer of genetic segments from the donor loci, a tandem array of silent alleles of the surface protein, to a downstream recipient locus that actively expresses the gene encoding the surface protein; this process is assisted by recombinases. Pili are hair-like appendages made up of pilin proteins which are present on the bacterial cell surface and exhibit Av. In N. gonorrhoeae, it has been demonstrated experimentally that the G4 formed near the pilE, a pilin-expression locus, binds RecA and provides a topological advantage for the nicking process essential to initiate recombination [26] . Deletion of this quadruplex motif suppresses Av in Neisseria.",

            "text": "[ 3 1 8 _ T D $ D I F F ] Proteins of the PfEMP-1 family are expressed on the surface of infected erythrocytes during the asexual life cycle in man and are encoded by var, a family of 60 genes which are predominantly present in the subtelomeric region of chromosomes [28] . The var genes undergo recombination (indels and translocations) to facilitate sequence variation in PfEMP1 and immune evasion. Interestingly, about a quarter of all putative quadruplex motifs in the P. falciparum genome are associated with the promoters of the var genes [29] . Stanton et al. identified a close association between the recombination breakpoints and G4 motifs in P. falciparum [30] . Breakpoints were found to occur proximal to quadruplexes, especially in subtelomeic regions, indicating that G4s have a role in var-associated recombination. Although recombination in P. falciparum genomes occurred proximal to quadruplex motifs, the median distance of a G4 from a breakpoint was about 16 kb. The specific mechanisms underlying G4assisted var gene recombination are not fully understood; nonetheless, a potential role for DNA repair has been speculated.",

            "text": "In addition to contributing to antigenic diversity in microbes (discussed above), G4s facilitate generation of genetic heterogeneity and evolution of HIV-1, the causative agent of AIDS. The recombination rate of HIV-1 stems from the ability of the reverse transcriptase (RT) to switch between RNA templates and generate chimeric proviral DNA. Recombinant HIV-1 strains have been associated with increased transmission efficiency and resistance to anti-HIV therapy [31] . The two positive-sense RNA strands of HIV-1 are held together by hairpin loops in the dimerization site (DIS) at the 5 0 end of each of the RNAs [32] . This allows for strand transfer by RT, making the region a recombination hotspot. Similar to the hairpin loops, intermolecular G4s tether the recombining segments, thus bringing them into each other's proximity to promote initiation of recombination. Independent studies identified intermolecular G4 motifs in three regions of the HIV-1 RNA (i) a 130-nt region comprising the DIS and 5 0 portion of the gag, (ii) central polypurine tract (cPPT), and (iii) the U3 region on either termini of RNA [33] [34] [35] [36] . Under in vitro conditions, synthetic RNA oligonucleotides corresponding to these G4s caused pausing of RT in the presence of potassium ions. Moreover, in an in vitro strand transfer assay, efficient switching over of RT between templates was observed under conditions that promote quadruplex formation (presence of potassium ions). These studies suggest that quadruplexes allow for dimerization of the HIV-1 genome at multiple loci along its length, thus contributing to recombinogenicity and rapid evolution of HIV-1.",

Interestingly, the level of the EBV oncogene, EBNA-1, is maintained by the folding and unfolding dynamics of its mRNA-borne quadruplex. The segment of EBNA1 mRNA that encodes its glycine-alanine repeat (GAr) domain was found to be rich in G4 motifs. Polysome distribution profiling, in vitro translation, and cell culture experiments identified that formation of quadruplexes obstructs the progress of ribosome machinery, resulting in low levels of EBNA1 and a concomitant decrease in presentation to T cells ( Figure 4D ). In addition, nucleolin was identified to bind the G4 formed in the GAr domain of EBNA-1 mRNA [66] . This interaction limits the synthesis of EBNA-1 to levels that allow persistence of the virus and evasion of the host immune system. Mutation of the EBNA-1 mRNA quadruplex or absence of nucleolin resulted in alleviation of translation inhibition and increased presentation of EBNA-1.",

The HBV genome exhibits a high degree of genetic variability owing to the lack of proof-reading ability in the HBV reverse transcriptase. As a result, HBV is classified into 10 HBV genotypes (A through J) with an intergenotypic sequence variation of at least 8% [84] . The HBV genotypes differ in transmissibility, virus loads, response to antiviral therapy, and ability to cause liver disease [84, 85] . However, genotype-specific regulatory mechanisms in HBV remain elusive. We had recently identified a G4 motif as a genotype-specific regulator of HBV replication [40] . A conserved three-tetrad G4 motif, 190 bp upstream of the transcription start site, was identified in the preS2/S promoter of HBV genotype B. This motif was virtually absent in the rest of the HBV genotypes. This quadruplex specifically enhanced the transcription of the preS2/S transcript and the production of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg). Point mutations disrupting the G4 motif in the preS2/S promoter of HBV genotype B led to a reduction in HBsAg production resulting in a fivefold reduction in virion secretion [26] .",

Interestingly, the addition of an intracellular G4-binding ligand led to a marked reduction in the expression of genes associated with radiation resistance, thus rendering D. radiodurans sensitive to radiation. The ability of G4 motifs to modulate radioresistance in D. radiodurans sheds light on how these DNA secondary structures contribute to microbial tolerance to environmental pressures by regulating the transcriptional machinery.",

Reduction of nitrate or nitrite to dinitrogen, a cellular process known as denitrification, is associated with the nasABGHC gene cluster in P. denitrificans [88] . This nitrateassimilatory system (nas) is regulated by a two-component NasS-NasT system. NasT is an effector molecule that positively regulates transcription of nas genes by acting as an antitermination signal [88] . The GC-rich genome of P. denitrificans contains a three-tetrad quadruplex motif 150 nucleotides upstream of the nasT gene [89] . Stabilization of the G4 by ligands (TmPyP4 and a benzophenoxazine ligand) or by cations (KCl) inhibited the transcription of the nasT gene. Similarly, the presence of G4-stabilizing ligands inhibited the growth of P. denitrificans in media containing nitrate as the sole source of nitrogen. This work on P. denitrificans highlights a role for G4-linked transcriptional control in modulating specific metabolic pathways.",

Mitochondrial transcripts of kinetoplastid organisms undergo extensive editing post-transcription; this mRNA editing involves deletion or insertion of 'U' residues at multiple locations specified by the anchoring of guide RNAs (gRNAs) encoded by the mitochondrial genome [91] . The nucleotide composition of the pre-mRNAs may be potentially altered by up to 50% as a result of editing, which is referred to as pan-editing [92] . Matthias-Leeder et al. analyzed nine mRNAs of T. brucei and found that the guanosine (G) content is lowered to about 19% from about 34% during pan-editing [93] . Importantly, the authors used computational methods to demonstrate the progressive decrease in G4 content during pan-editing. Therefore, pan-editing in African trypanosomes has been suggested as a G4-resolving process that leads to the generation of G4-free translatable ORFs. The authors also propose the formation of DNA/RNA hybrid G4s (HQ) between the nontemplate DNA strand and pre-edited transcripts. Furthermore, it is speculated that the formation of HQs is involved in the termination of transcription and the initiation of mitochondrial replication. Thus, quadruplexes may play a crucial role in switching between the two mutually exclusive processes of mitochondrial replication and transcription in trypanosomes.",

The existence of RGQMs amplifies the G4 load of the genomes of HHVs manifold [44] . Such G4-forming iterative G-rich units also comprise the simple sequence repeats (SSRs) present in the noncoding regions of Nostoc sp. and Xanthomonad spp. [97] . Bacterial SSRs are known to be implicated in antigenic and phase variation. Given the functional significance of repeat sequences in microbial genomes it may be interesting to investigate the link between the tandem array of G4s and molecular processes related to microbial pathogenesis. Recent reports on G4 motifs in viruses infecting nonhuman hosts shed light on how G4s have been exploited by viruses for virulence and genome regulation throughout evolution [52, 98] .",

Host protein-microbial G4 interaction or the host G4-microbial protein interactions at the molecular interface of the host and microbe during infection are fascinating and merit further investigation [55, 56, [66] [67] [68] [69] . It would be interesting to understand if such interactions defend the host or demonstrate yet another mechanism of microbial pathogenesis. Intuitively, the threshold to transcend the thin line between these two opposing outcomes may be subject to complex regulation which may be important for an understanding of the therapeutic potential of targeting this host-microbe interaction.",

            "text": "HHVs are an example of viruses capable of causing latent infections. During latency, their large linear ds-DNA genome circularizes to form an episome. The episome is replicated and segregated between the daughter cells with every cell division in the host, leading to persistence of the virus. Herpesvirus genomes consist of unique and repeat regions. Multiple reiterations of G-rich repeat units capable of forming G4s (known as 'repetitive G-quadruplex motifs' -RGQMs) has Stalling of DNA polymerase at G4s in HSV-1 genome Reduc on in the levels of EBNA-1 and escape of immune surveillance Stalling of ribosome at G4 Roles of G-Quadruplexes (G4s) in Human Herpesviruses (HHVs). (A) Quadruplexes (red) present in the promoter regions of the HHVs negatively regulate gene expression. Addition of G4-binding ligand (blue) further augments the inhibition of gene expression. (B) HHV genomes exist as concatemers during replication. A quadruplex formed at the pac-1 signal (packaging signal) acts as a scaffold for the protein machinery that cleaves and encapsidates unit-length genomes. The sites of cleavage proximal to the quadruplex-forming pac-1 signals are shown in orange. (C) Binding of ligands (blue objects) to G4s (red triangular kinks) present near the origin of bidirectional episomal replication (red bulge with two-headed arrow) in the terminal repeat region (red portion) of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) episome, prevents progression of DNA polymerase (green ovals). The slippage of the polymerase leads to replicative stress that activates dormant origins (grey bulges on either sides). The net effect of the ligand binding to quadruplexes is a reduction in the number of KSHV episomal copies. (D) Quadruplex (red) formed in the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) nuclear antigen-1 (EBNA-1) mRNA causes stalling of the ribosome-nascent chain complex (green and blue), resulting in inhibition of translation. EBV is thus able to maintain the levels of EBNA-1 below the detection threshold, evading immune response during latency. The binding of nucleolin (orange) to the quadruplex further reduces EBNA-1 protein levels. (E) Ligands (blue objects) bind to G4s (red) in the herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) genome and stabilize them, causing polymerase (green ovals) stalling on the leading and lagging strands, inhibiting HSV-1 DNA replication. Arrows indicate direction of replication. Figures A through E are not drawn to scale.been noted in the eight HHVs[44]. Such G4-forming repeats have recently been identified to be functionally relevant in the latency of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) or HHV-8. KSHV is an oncogenic virus that has acquired a number of its genes by molecular piracy. The terminal repeat (TR) region of KSHV genome is enriched for quadruplex-forming sequence motifs with each repetitive element (about 800 bp), having 12 and 16 putative quadruplexforming sequences in the top and the bottom strand respectively[60]. The TR region harbours the only origin for replication of viral episomes. The preponderance of quadruplexes in the TR region is relevant in the regulation of episomal replication. Stabilization of the G4s with PhenDC3(2,N9-bis(1-methylquinolin-3-yl)-1,10-phenanthroline-2,9-dicarboxamide) or TmPyP4(5,10,15,20-tetrakis(1-methylpyridin-1-ium-4-yl)-21,22-dihydroporphyrin) halts the replication forks at the boundary of the TR; replicative stress ensues and results in the firing of the otherwise dormant origins in the viral episome. Consequently, the [ 3 2 1 _ T D $ D I F F ] two replication parameters [ 3 2 2 _ T D $ D I F F ]the number of replication forks and the number of originsincrease in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, a transient replication assay also indicated inhibition of KSHV DNA replication and a decrease in the number of copies of the viral episome, posttreatment with PhenDC3 (",
