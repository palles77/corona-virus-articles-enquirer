Circulation of an identical BCoV strain during a 4-month period was demonstrated in calves in one dairy herd. In a regional epizootic of winter dysentery in Northern Sweden, highly similar BCoV strains were detected. In the Southern and Central regions, several genotypes of BCoV circulated contemporaneously, indicating that in these regions, which had a higher density of cattle than the Northern regions, more extensive transmission of the virus was occurring. Identical BCoV sequences supported the epidemiological data that inter-herd contact through purchased calves was important. Swedish BCoV strains unexpectedly showed a high homology with recently detected Italian strains. This study shows that molecular analysis of the spike (S) glycoprotein gene of BCoV can be a useful tool to support or rule out suspected transmission routes.",

Variations in host range and tissue tropism of coronaviruses are attributed to the spike (S) glycoprotein (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001) . This protein is cleaved by an intracellular protease into two functional domains (Gallagher and Buchmeier, 2001) . The S1 subunit is peripheral and responsible for virus binding to host-cell receptors (Kubo et al., 1994) , induction of neutralizing antibodies (Yoo and Deregt, 2001) , and haemagglutination activity (Schultze et al., 1991) . The S1 sequence is variable, and mutations in this region have been associated with altered antigenicity and virus pathogenicity (Fazakerley et al., 1992; Ballesteros et al., 1997) . The sequence of the S2 subunit is more conserved and this subunit is responsible for cell membrane fusion activity (Yoo et al., 1991) . The S1 gene has been exploited as a target to study the molecular epidemiology of BCoV infection (Hasoksuz et al., 2002a; Jeong et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2006) .",

Outbreaks typically occur in autumn and winter, probably in association with housing, but severe outbreaks in adult cattle have been reported in summer (Park et al., 2006; Decaro et al., 2008a) .

These strains were obtained from a regional epizootic of WD, i.e. a series of outbreaks close in time and space. These regions were shown to have a low herd immunity to BCoV; 70% of the herds had BCoV seronegative primiparous cows in the Northern regions compared to 10% in the Southern parts in 2007 (Ohlson et al., 2010; A. Ohlson et al., unpublished data) . This may be related to a lower density of herds in Northern regions, less transportation of animals, and/or a difference in biosecurity between the regions (Ohlson et al., 2010) . The low herd immunity suggests that BCoV is not continuously circulating in the Northern parts of Sweden, and that virus causing regional epizootics is introduced from other regions. Such a transmission is also suggested by the finding of strain N3-0605 in Southern Sweden prior to and highly identical (nt identity >99.8%) to the strain causing the J\u00e4mtland outbreaks of WD (Z1-Z5).",

While it is easy to understand the clustering of strains from the Central and Southern parts of Sweden with strains from Denmark, which borders with Sweden, grouping of Swedish strains with Italian strains was surprising. As there were no records of animals purchased from Italy, it is unlikely that the virus was introduced to Sweden by transportation of animals directly from Italy. There have, however, been ani-mals exported from Sweden to Central and Southern Europe in recent years. Samples sequenced from other European countries are needed in order to trace the origin and/or spread of Swedish strains and molecular analysis of future BCoV outbreaks from different parts of the world will increase the understanding of BCoV epidemiology, e.g. direct and indirect transmission routes between herds, regions or even countries.",

The analysed strains showed a high sequence identity, regardless of whether they were obtained from outbreaks of respiratory disease or diarrhoea or from calves or adults.

In Northern Sweden, a regional epizootic of highly similar BCoV strains was detected, while in the Southern and Central regions more extensive transmission of the virus was indicated. Finally, identical BCoV sequences supported epidemiological data on inter-herd contact through purchased calves.",
