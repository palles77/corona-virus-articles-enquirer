We have developed a microfluidic device composed of ~6000 wells, with each well containing a microstructure to capture single, infected cells replicating an enterovirus expressing a fluorescent reporter protein. We have used this system to characterize enterovirus inhibitors with distinct mechanisms of action. Single-cell analysis reveals that each class of inhibitor interferes with the viral infection cycle in a manner that can be distinguished by principal component analysis. Single-cell analysis of antiviral candidates not only reveals efficacy but also facilitates clustering of drugs with the same mechanism of action and provides some indication of the ease with which resistance will develop.",

Unfortunately, viral emergence has outpaced the discovery and development of compounds capable of treating these pathogens. Because sporadic outbreaks come, go, and may never come again, development of broad-spectrum therapeutics exhibiting high barriers to resistance would have the greatest value. Unbiased screening of chemical libraries for antiviral agents using cell-based assays has no problem identifying active compounds of high potency. However, identifying the target and predicting the likelihood for evolution of resistance generally take years of effort following compound discovery.",

This class of antiviral agent has always been touted as having a high barrier to resistance (8) . The typical explanation for this high barrier is that amino acid substitutions in the active site of the viral RNA polymerase conferring resistance to the antiviral ribonucleoside also impair the specificity and/or efficiency of incorporation of natural ribonucleotides (9) . Elimination of the most-fit members of the viral population by an antiviral agent requires that resistance emerges from the surviving, low-fitness members of the population, which would ultimately require restoration of fitness for the population to survive the myriad mechanisms of host restriction (10) . Restoration of fitness may be the insurmountable barrier precluding the development of resistance to chain-terminating antiviral ribonucleotides.",

We have used this device to compare three mechanistically distinct classes of antiviral agents: a PV polymerase inhibitor [2\u2032-C-methyl-adenosine (2\u2032-C-Me-A)], a PV protease inhibitor (rupintrivir), and two heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitors [geldanamycin (GA) and ganetespib (GS)].

To analyze the singlecell data, we use five phenomenological parameters extracted from each time course (fig. S2C ). These parameters are maximum fluorescence observed, which correlates to yield of genomic RNA; slope at the time of half-maximum fluorescence, which correlates to replication speed; infection time, which, to a first approximation, is the time it takes for an infection to go from start to finish akin to the virus generation time; start point, which is the earliest time in which fluorescence can be detected; and midpoint, the time of half-maximum fluorescence. This analysis leads to a collection of data points for each parameter value measured in each cell. Instead of displaying the primary data in a scatter plot ( fig. S2 , D and E), we display and analyze the curve derived from the first derivative of the cumulative distribution function from the raw data ( fig. S2E ). Our statistical analysis uses an unpaired twotailed t test to determine if a significant difference exists for the means of a given parameter under two experimental conditions. In these experiments, the area under the curve defining each distribution has been normalized to one for ease of comparison. We do not attempt to interpret a difference in the \"fine\" structure of the distributions. Using this data analysis pipeline to evaluate outcomes in the absence and presence of 2\u2032-C-Me-A (50 \uf06dM), we observed a statistically significant difference in the mean values for the maximum (fig. S2F) and slope ( fig. S2G ) parameters without a statistically significant change in the mean values for the remaining parameters ( fig. S2 , H to J). Tabulation of the data and statistical analysis for this experiment are provided in table S1. These observations reproduce outcomes presented by us previously using the first-generation device (7) . The mean values for maximum and slope parameters were reduced substantially in the presence of 2\u2032-C-Me-A.

An earlier study did not observe an impact of GA prior to virus assembly; however, it is possible that a reduction of the magnitude shown here would be concealed by experimental error (23) . Because infection is monitored by eGFP, which requires virus entry, genome replication, and genome translation, interference with any of these steps would lead to a reduction in the number of eGFP-positive cells.

One approach to delaying or even eliminating the emergence of drug-resistant mutants is the use of antiviral combinations (30, 31) . What is often evaluated is the ability of two drugs to exhibit greater efficacy (synergy) in preventing infection in combination than observed when either drug is used alone. We evaluated the ability of 2\u2032-C-Me-A to synergize with GA by treating cells with the concentrations of one or both at their IC 50 values (Fig. 4A) . In the absence of drug, 34 \u00b1 3% of cells in the device were infected. That number was reduced to 18 \u00b1 2, 30 \u00b1 3, or 15 \u00b1 3% in the presence of 2\u2032-C-Me-A, GA, or the combination thereof, respectively. On the basis of this observation alone, the conclusion would be that this combination of antiviral agents is not even additive. Analysis of the entire single-cell dataset is presented in table S4. Because 2\u2032-C-Me-A exhibits the most substantial antiviral effect relative to the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control, here we compare the combination to 2\u2032-C-Me-A alone. We observed a statistically significant difference for all parameters (Fig. 4, B to F). Single-cell analysis therefore has the ability to reveal efficacy of drug combinations masked at the population level. We performed the comparable experiment with GS and reached the same conclusion ( fig. S5 and table S4 ).",

The mechanistically related, but chemically distinct, inhibitors of HSP90 cluster by PCA (see GA and GS in Fig. 5A ). We evaluated the antiviral drug combinations in the context of the PCA space (Fig. 5B ). An additive combination is defined by the vector bisecting the parallelogram defined by the experiment in the absence of either drug (control) and the experiments in the presence of each drug alone (Fig. 5B) . The 2\u2032-C-Me-A-GA combination was synergistic, with the position indicating that the combination delays the start point and retards the infection time. We conclude that single-cell analysis of antiviral therapeutics can provide not only information on the efficacy of a drug but also information on the mechanism of action and synergy of combinations of antiviral therapeutics. This experimental paradigm should have a transformative impact on the drug development process.",

For example, the presence and abundance of viral restriction factors and viral replication promoting factors of the host are largely governed by stochastic gene expression (37) . As a result, substantial betweencell variation exists in all quantifiable parameters of infection. An underappreciated consequence of the behavior of systems such as these is the non-self-averaging nature of these systems, which means that the population average of any single-cell parameter will almost certainly fail to represent the dynamics within any single cell (38, 39) . The practical complication arising from this phenomenon is that changes in the average kinetics observed in a growth curve for a virus caused by a perturbation, e.g., exposure to an antiviral therapeutic, will not inform accurately the step(s) of the viral lifecycle affected most by the perturbation.",

An efficient polymerase is likely required to replicate fast and to the highest levels. Such a polymerase might be expected to use the antiviral nucleotide better, leading to extinction of this population of viruses. These same members of the viral population were sensitive to rupintrivir (fig. S6C ). In this case, at concentrations 6 of 8 equivalent to or lower than the IC 50 , binding is driven by the concentration of the protease target, which would be highest in cells replicating fastest and to the highest levels. GA only affected a subset of 2\u2032-C-Me-A and rupintrivir-sensitive members, those with a fast rate of replication ( fig. S6D ). This observation is quite interesting in that fast rates of replication in our assay mean fast rates of translation to produce GFP. Chaperones like HSP90 would be expected to be most useful under these conditions. A comparable analysis using the start point and infection time provided an even greater distinction between the three classes of antiviral agents studied herein ( fig. S6 , E to G). Most noteworthy was the observation that rupintrivir retarded the time it took to establish infection and to complete replication ( fig. S6F ). This observation may reflect the role of the protease in promoting replication by cleaving cellular antagonists of the virus lifecycle.",

Given the substantial effort required to go from compound to mechanism using the traditional experimental paradigm, the ability of single-cell analysis to inform mechanism should make this approach a welcome addition to the drug discovery and development toolbox. It is not uncommon for analogs to be synthesized during the drug development process that lose specificity or even function by a different mechanism of action; single-cell analysis has the potential to reveal changes such as these at the start of the analysis instead of much, much later in the development process. Last, although we have used antiviral agents to demonstrate the power of single-cell analysis, use of this technology and approach will be applicable to the discovery and development of any class of therapeutics that can be assessed in cell culture.",

With the linearized plasmid as the template, viral RNA was transcribed at 37\u00b0C for 5.5 hours in a 20-\uf06dl reaction medium containing 350 mM Hepes (pH 7.5), 32 mM magnesium acetate, 40 mM dithiothreitol, 2 mM spermidine, 28 mM NTPs, linearized DNA (0.025 \uf06dg/\uf06dl), and T7 RNA polymerase (0.025 \uf06dg/\uf06dl). After removing magnesium pyrophosphate in the mixture by centrifugation for 2 min, RNA concentration was measured by scanning the gel at fluorescence mode with a Typhoon 8600 scanner (Promega, USA). Then, 5 \uf06dg of viral RNA was used to transfect HeLa cells cultured at 37\u00b0C by electroporation. Virus was harvested by three repeated freeze-thaw cycles, centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min, and suspended in 0.5% NP-40. For purification, the supernatant was mixed with 1 volume of 20% PEG-8000 (polyethylene glycol, molecular weight 7000~9000)/1 M NaCl solution and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. After centrifugation at 8000g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C, the pellet was resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and filtered with Centricon Plus-70 (EMD Millipore, USA). Plaque assay was performed to determine the virus titer.",

Meanwhile, wells containing two or more infected cells and showing autofluorescence or out-of-focus signals were manually excluded. As a result, the fluorescence intensity of each infected single cell over time could be obtained. With a customized package of R, the maximum, slope, infection time, start point, and midpoint were derived for each data curve, as described previously (7, 40) . For comparison of different experiments, the intensities were further normalized to uniformize the mean values of the maximums for the no drug groups (2.00 arbitrary units in this work). To visualize the distributions, as in fig. S2 and elsewhere in the manuscript, we calculated the cumulative distribution function from the raw data, then calculated the first derivative, and smoothed it using Savitzky-Golay smoothing.

The following layers exist: microwell (not shown explicitly), channel (green), and valve (cyan). The device is divided into five sections of 1140 microwells (different shades of green for the channel layer) for a total of 5700 microwells. (B) Schematic of two wells of the device with all relevant dimensions indicated. The microwell layer creates a physical barrier between adjacent wells. The barrier between adjacent wells is sealed with water emanating from the valve layer. Water in the valve layer is sealed by application of air under pressure (20 to 30 psi). (C) Simulation of the flow velocity field in a microwell indicated that the outlet would maximize cell trapping by the microstructure. (D) Image showing cells captured by the microstructures in the microwells. The device was infused with cells (5 \u00d7 10 5 cells/ml) at a rate of 0.5 \uf06dl/min.
