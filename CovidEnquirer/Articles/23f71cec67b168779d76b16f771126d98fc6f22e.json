            "text": "Tropheryma whipplei, which causes Whipple disease, is found in human feces and may cause gastroenteritis. To show that T. whipplei causes gastroenteritis, PCRs for T. whipplei were conducted with feces from children 2-4 years of age. Western blotting was performed for samples from children with diarrhea who had positive or negative results for T. whipplei. T. whipplei was found in samples from 36 (15%) of 241 children with gastroenteritis and associated with other diarrheal pathogens in 13 (33%) of 36. No positive specimen was detected for controls of the same age (0/47; p = 0.008). Bacterial loads in case-patients were as high as those in patients with Whipple disease and signifi cantly higher than those in adult asymptomatic carriers (p = 0.002). High incidence in patients and evidence of clonal circulation suggests that some cases of gastroenteritis are caused or exacerbated by T. whipplei, which may be co-transmitted with other intestinal pathogens. F or decades, Whipple disease was considered to be a metabolic disorder in humans (1) . An accumulation of data, such as antimicrobial drug susceptibilities and observation of atypical bacteria in intestinal macrophages, has suggested that this disease is an infectious disease. Tropheryma whipplei is recognized as the infectious agent responsible for Whipple disease (2) . Recent studies using molecular biology (3) (4) (5) and culture-dependent (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) techniques have enabled the T. whipplei genome to be fully sequenced (11, 12) and have resulted in development of new culture media (13) , selection of highly sensitive primers for quantitative PCR (14) , and genotyping (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) . The bacterium is found in a viable form in stools of infected patients (9) .",

T. whipplei DNA has been detected in sewage and is highly prevalent in the feces of sewer workers (12%-26%) (1, 20, (22) (23) (24) (25) . Moreover, the prevalence of T. whipplei in feces of healthy children 2-10 years of age who lived in rural Senegal (sub-Saharan Africa) was 44% (46/105) (21) .

T. whipplei is excreted in a live form by patients with Whipple disease (9) , and T. whipplei DNA is found in stool samples of healthy persons (22) . This bacterium is commonly found (1) 14 13 13 11 (1) in sewers (20, 23) and has also been detected in sewage (25) .

The bacterial load of T. whipplei in stools is much lower in asymptomatic carriers than in patients with Whipple disease (14, 20) . We believe that our data provide strong evidence to support our initial hypothesis that T. whipplei causes mild gastroenteritis in children 2-4 years of age. All of our case-patients had 2 quantitative PCR-positive results, and genotyping of T. whipplei from 32 children enabled us to identify 12 new genotypes. Our data exclude the possibility of PCR contamination. We also found bacterial loads higher than those in previous reports of chronic carriers (20) .

            "text": "We suspect that T. whipplei infection is contagious and transmitted by the fecal-oral route in children 2-4 years of age with other enteric pathogens. We previously reported an association between G. duodenalis infection and Whipple disease (27) . As with other organisms such as Helicobacter pylori, T. whipplei may also be transmitted through saliva because it has been found in saliva of asymptomatic carriers and patients with Whipple disease (20) . Therefore, we hypothesized that primary infection with T. whipplei in children may result in gastroenteritis, especially when associated with other intestinal pathogens. We have provided several lines of evidence that T. whipplei is causing or exacerbating gastroenteritis. The incidence of T. whipplei DNA in stools of children 2-4 years of age with gastroenteritis was higher than that in the control group; these infected children also have higher levels of antibodies. That healthy children of the same ages were not infected with T. whipplei also suggests that primary infection is symptomatic. Sociodemographic differences between the 2 groups could theoretically explain our fi ndings. However, most of our patients and controls were from the same geographic area, which enabled us to rule out this hypothesis. We identifi ed 1 clone (genotype 3) in 10 children, which indicates that this clone is circulating in our population. The association we found between T. whipplei and other pathogens transmitted by the fecal-oral route supports the conclusion that T. whipplei and other intestinal pathogens have a common source of infection and that they are often co-transmitted (31, 32) . However, for unknown reasons, T. whipplei could replicate in children with lowgrade chronic infections without causing diarrhea. That T. whipplei-infected patients were more likely to have co-infections than patients infected with other pathogens may also indicate that T. whipplei may decrease below molecular detection limits when diarrhea resolves. However, higher levels of IgM against T. whipplei in case-patients suggest infection with this bacterium. Moreover, an in vivo animal model of oral infection by T. whipplei has shown a pathogenic effect only in mice with previously infl amed colonic tissues (D. Raoult et al., unpub. data) . Thus, infl amed colonic tissues may also explain the frequency of co-infections with common pathogens observed in persons with T. whipplei-positive gastroenteritis.",
