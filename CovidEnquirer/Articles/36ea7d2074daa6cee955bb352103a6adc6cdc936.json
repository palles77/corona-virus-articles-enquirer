A method was developed for qualitative and quantitative detection of the seminal cell-associated PRRSV RNA in relation to endogenous and exogenous reference RNAs. As endogenous control for one-step real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR UBE2D2 mRNA was selected. Particularly for the analysis of persistent infections associated with low copy numbers of PRRSV RNA, UBE2D2 mRNA is an ideal control due to its low expression in seminal cells and its detection in all samples analysed (n = 36). However, the amount of UBE2D2 mRNA in porcine semen varied (up to 106-fold), thus its use is limited to qualitative detection of PRRSV RNA. For quantitation, a synthetic, non-metazoan RNA was added to the RNA isolation reaction at an exact copy number. The photosynthesis gene ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase large subunit (rbcL) from Arabidopsis thaliana was used as an exogenous spike. Unexpectedly, PRRSV RNA was detected in a herd of specific pathogen-free (SPF) boars which were tested ELISA-negative for anti-PRRSV antibodies. Therefore, RT-PCR for seminal cell-associated PRRSV is a powerful tool for managing the SPF status during quarantine programs and for routine outbreak investigations.",

The PRRSV-1 and PRRSV-2 strains (formerly European-and North American-type PRRSV, respectively; (Drew, 2000) ) and the monophyletic Lithuanian PRRSV strains (Plagemann, 2003; Stadejek et al., 2002) can be differentiated. In semen, PRRSV may be shed from the bulbourethral gland (Christopher-Hennings et al., 1995) and can be located in immature sperm cells (Sur et al., 1997) or macrophages (Christopher-Hennings et al., 1998) . PRRSV can be detected in semen as early as 2-3 days postinoculation (p.i.) (Christopher-Hennings et al., 1995; Legeay et al., 1997) and can be transmitted by insemination (refs. in Sur et al., 1997) . PRRSV-infected boars show no significant clinical signs, and seroconversion and/or viremia is not correlated with shedding of virus in semen (Wills et al., 2003) . While another arterivirus, equine arteri-tis virus, is shed in semen for at least 1-2 years, a prolonged carrier state (>day 101 p.i.) in PRRSV-infected boars has not been reported (Christopher-Hennings et al., 1995) .",

Exogenous controls spiked at a defined copy number to the sample before RNA isolation and endogenous controls can be applied for relative quantitation of viral RNAs using real-time RT-PCR. Therefore, reference RNA expression should be comparable with that of the target and independent from the experimental conditions, e.g. the presence of a virus. Both reference types serve as controls for sample transport and storage conditions, isolation performance, normalise for differences in total RNA input or contribute to the detection of false negative results caused by sample-specific inhibitors. They were applied for monitoring the course of infection or intermittent shedding of viruses and for differentiation between a viremic or persistent stage of infection (Moody et al., 2000; Pasquier et al., 2003) . Exogenous controls are used for testing of cell-free body fluids. Their copy number can be controlled precisely and adjusted easily to the copy number of the gene of interest. Endogenous controls are a cost efficient alternative for the detection of viral RNAs in veterinary diagnostic work.",

For detection of PRRSV in boar semen candidate endogenous reference genes were selected among common housekeeping genes and other genes found previously to be expressed uniformely in human and mouse tissues (Hamalainen et al., 2001; Warrington et al., 2000) . They were chosen from different functional categories based on the Panther classification system (Thomas et al., 2003) which reduces significantly the chance that genes might be co-regulated (Vandesompele et al., 2002) . For the development of one-step real-time RT-PCR for four endogenous reference RNAs (HPRT, UBE2D2, PPIA, and HMBS) appropriate target regions were selected and the assay conditions were optimised for amplification efficiency. Next, their expression levels and the amplification from genomic DNA contamination were examined. The UBE2D2 mRNA was found to be a suitable endogenous control for qualitative molecular diagnostics of PRRSV RNA in the cell-associated part of porcine semen. However, due to the variable expression of UBE2D2 mRNA, an exogenous reference RNA derived from a plant gene was developed for quantitative detection of the viral RNA.",

The set A boars (n = 12; Pi\u00e9train, Landrace, and Large White breed) were 1-5.5 years old and lived in the herd since 6-57 months. The boars of set B (n = 9; Pi\u00e9train) which joined the herd at the age of 8 months were between 20 and 57 months old. Both sets of boars were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions. This was guaranteed by the quarantine and testing program for incoming boars involving two serological tests with an interval of 2 weeks against classical swine fever virus (CSFV), pseudorabies virus (PRV), swine influenza virus (SIV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV), Chlamydophila, Brucella, and Leptospira species. After quarantine, the boars are tested for these pathogens once a year. According to the management program for the set A boars the absence of PRRSV antibodies was required. This was achieved by testing routinely with the IDEXX (Herd-Chek) ELISA (IDEXX Laboratories, Woerrstadt, Germany) for which a sample-to-positive (s/p) ratio of \u22650.4 is considered positive. At the time of sampling the set A boars were ELISA negative (\u22120.08 to 0.18). In addition an immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA (Wensvoort et al., 1991) ) confirmed the PRRS-negative serology. The set B boars showed a high positive serostatus when semen samples were taken (IDEXX ELISA values: 2.4-2.7 for n = 5, and 1.0-1.6 for n = 4) indicating a recent contact with PRRSV.",

The C T values determined for UBE2D2 mRNA in semen were comparable to those determined for samples with low viral RNA copy numbers which is especially important for reliable virus quantitation during persistent infections. The reasons for the varying C T values in the UBE2D2 assay ( C T = 7.2, Table 1) were not addressed and might involve differences in the RNA quality among the samples, in the number and/or the expression level of UBE2D2 mRNA expressing cells.

The serological status is also not an adequate indicator of PRRSV and PRRSV RNA shedding in the semen (Christopher-Hennings et al., 1995) . This underlines the need to complement immunoassays with more sensitive nucleic acid-based methods for a comprehensive approach especially for the characterisation of persistent PRRSV infections (Batista et al., 2004) , e.g. during the quarantine and testing program for incoming boars to reduce later conflicts in the interpretation of the PRRSV status. It is possible that our results obtained for the boars of set A, retrospectively, document only a contact between the animals and the virus before joining the herd, since the incoming boars were selected on the basis of their serological, but not of their viral RNA status, and contact of the boars with PRRSV before entering the herd was possible in principle.",
