The relatively high degree of sequence identity for the RBD is consistent with the view that 2019-nCoV, like SARS-CoV, may use ACE2 as its host cell receptor, as for SARS-CoV (Hoffmann et al., 2020; Wan et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020a) . Interestingly, when the more defined receptor binding motif (RBM) was analyzed (i.e. the region of SARS-CoV S containing residues that were shown to directly contact the ACE2 receptor) the identity between the two sequences drops to 50%, in this case hinting at possible differences in binding residues involved in the interaction with the receptor and/or binding affinities (Li et al., 2005; Wan et al., 2020) . As expected, within the well-conserved S2 domain, subdomain identities were high for the fusion peptide region (FP, 93% identity), high for the heptad-repeat 1 region (HR1, 88% identity), identical for HR2 (100% identity) and high for both the transmembrane and the C-terminal endodomain (TM, 93% identity and E, 97% identity).",

            "text": "To better study the S1/S2 site structural organization, we modeled the SARS-CoV S protein based on the S structure of MHV (S1/S2 site mutated in the structure), and MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV (S1/S2 site missing in the structure) to see if the predicted structure of the S1/S2 site was similar in despite the template structure. We observed no differences in the modeled SARS-CoV S protein at the S1/S2 site, predicting an exposed flexible loop in all the three models (data not shown). Based on this, we proceeded to compare the S1/S2 site, as well as other major functional elements of the S2 domain (i.e. S2' site and fusion peptide), in the predicted structure in our SARS-CoV, 2019-nCoV and Bat-CoV S models (Fig 5) . Remarkably, two features appear to exhibit distinctive characteristics in the 2019-nCoV S model: the fusion peptide, which is predicted to be organized in a more compact conformation for 2019-nCoV S than in SARS-CoV S (Fig 5 - surface models) and the region corresponding to the S1/S2 cleavage site which contains R667 in the case of SARS-CoV (Fig. 5 -S1/S2 alignment box and ribbon models). For SARS-CoV and the bat-CoV proteins, the S1/S2 site forms a short loop that appears flanking closely to the side of the trimeric structure. In the case of 2019-nCoV S, the S1/S2 site is predicted to form an extended loop that protrudes to the exterior of the trimer (Fig. 5) . This feature suggests that the S1/S2 loop in 2019-nCoV S could be more exposed for proteolytic processing by host cell proteases. As mentioned before, solving structure of the S1/S2 site appears to present difficulties for most of the reported CoV S structures (Fig. 6 -top panel) . However, the exposed loop feature has been demonstrated in both modeled and cryo-EM CoV S structures with similar amino acid sequences at the S1/S2 author/funder. All rights reserved.

MHV with an intact cleavage loop was unstable when expressed, and so we consider that the S1/S2 loop controls virus stability, likely via access to the down-stream S2' site that regulates fusion peptide exposure and activity. As such it will interesting to monitor the effects of S1/S2 loop insertions and proteolytic cleavability in the context of virus transmission, in addition to virus entry and pathogenesis.",

Gammacoronaviruses and deltacoronaviruses are reported to have an avian origin, but are known to infect both mammals and avian species (Woo et al., 2012). Human infections of bat-origin viruses typically occur through intermediate hosts; for SARS-CoV these hosts are palm civets (Paguma larvata) and racoon dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides), and for MERS-CoV the known host is the dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) (Cui et al., 2019; Xu et al., 2009). SARS-CoV antibodies were first detected in palm civets and the animal handlers in wet markets (Cui et al., 2019). MERS-CoV is thought to have been circulating for at least 30 years within the dromedary camel population based on retrospective antibody testing of serum from 1983 (Cui et al., 2019).

Other closely related sequences found were from Bat-SL-CoVZC45 and Bat-SL-CoVZXC21. The sub-clade that groups 2019-nCoV, Bat-SL-RaTG13, Bat-SL-CoVZC45 and Bat-SL-CoVZXC21 is distinct from the one grouping human and civet SARS-CoV along with other related bat SARS-like viruses, such as Bat-SL-LYRa3. Alignments of RBD and cleavage sites of 2019-nCoV and other bat-CoVs An S protein sequence alignment focusing on the RBD region of 2019-nCoV, SARS-CoV and bat-SARS-related viruses reveals that the N-terminal half of the RBD is relatively well conservedwhereas the C-terminal half, which contains the RBM, exhibits more variations (Fig. 2A).

Of note, the leucine (L) residue found at position 792 of the SARS-CoV sequence is substituted to serine (S) residue for 2019-nCoV S as well as the bat SARS-related sequences.

To select the template structure, the S protein amino acid sequences from four representative betacoronaviruses (HCoV-HKU1, MHV, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) werealigned and the solved S protein structures were compared to determine their amino acid identity and the overall structural organization similarities among these proteins (Supplementary Fig. 3A).",

Indeed, analysis of Western blots of VSV-pseudoparticles containing 2019-nCoV S have shown the presence of cleaved S, in contrast to pseudoparticles containing SARS-CoV S (Hoffmann et al., 2020). In the case of MERS-CoV, but not SARS-CoV, it is known that priming of S by \"pre-cleavage\" occurs at the S1/S2 site, giving 2019-nCoV cleavage activation properties more in line with MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV (Belouzard et al., 2009; Hoffmann et al., 2020; Kleine-Weber et al., 2018; Millet and Whittaker, 2014). 2019-nCoV is currently believed to be highly SARS-CoV like with respect to its receptor binding, and the modeling studies reported here are broadly in line with this finding, despite the relatively low amino acid identity in the RBM. However it is important to remember that changes in protease usage may allow coronaviruses to undergo receptor-independent entry (virus-cell fusion) as well as affect syncytia formation (cell-cell fusion) and tissue pathology (Gallagher et al., 1992; Menachery et al., 2019; Phillips et al., 2017). To our knowledge, the enlarged priming loop of 2019-nCov is unique among the viruses in Betacoronavirus lineage C. The presence of a distinct insert containing paired basic residues in the S1/S2 priming loop is common in many coronaviruses in Betacoronavirus lineage C (e.g. MERS-CoV), as well as in lineage A (e.g. mouse hepatitis virus, MHV) and lineage d, and is universally found in Gammacoronavirus S (e.g. IBV) (Shang et al., 2018). It is noticeably absent in most Alphacoronaviruses, with the clear exception of type I canine and feline coronaviruses (Jaimes et al., 2020; Millet and Whittaker, 2015). One feature of the distinct insert for of 2019-nCoV that warrants attention relates to potential changes as the virus evolves. An equivalent present in influenza HA (in this case adjacent to the fusion peptide), and insertions of basic residues into the loop are a primary marker of conversion from low pathogencity to highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (e.g. H5N1) (Chen et al., 1998). In coronaviruses, such loop modifications are known to affect MHV pathogenesis, and modulate neurovirulence and neuroinvasiveness of HCoV-OC43 (Frana et al., 1985; Le Coupanec et al., 2015). The FCoV is another example where S1/S2 loop modifications appear to lead directly to changes in viral pathogenesis (Andr\u00e9 et al., 2019; Jaimes et al., 2020; Licitra et al., 2013). At present 2019-nCoV is behaving in a distinct manner compared to SARS-CoV. We believe our findings are of special importance considering that the available data suggests ACE2 as a suitable cellular receptor for 2019-nCoV entry (Huang and Herrmann, 2020; Letko and Munster, 2020). In our modeling analysis, we observed that the RBM of the 2019-nCoV predicted a similar organization as SARS-CoV and that deletions at this RBM region in other bat-CoVs are reported to not impact its ability to bind ACE2 (Ge et al., 2013; Menachery et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2015).This suggests that instead of receptor binding, the S1/S2 loop is a distinctive feature relevant to 2019-nCoV pathogenesis and marks a unique similarity to MERS-CoV. We would predict that distinct insert in 2019-nCoV S would give the virus biological properties more in line with MERS-CoV and not SARS-CoV, especially with regard to its cell entry pathway. However, it may also impact virus spread and transmission. While many epidemiological features of 2019-nCoV still need to be resolved, there are many features of transmission that align more with MERS-CoV then SARS-CoV. The reproductive number (R0) of 2019-nCoV (approx.[3][4], is higher than SARS-CoV (approx. 2-3) and while MERS-CoV has a low R0 in humans (<1), it is high in camels and in",
