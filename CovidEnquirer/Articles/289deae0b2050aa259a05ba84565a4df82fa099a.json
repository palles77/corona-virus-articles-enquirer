Personal protective equipment (PPE) plays a critical role in mitigating the risk of health care personnel (HCP) exposure to contaminated body fluids in the care of patients with communicable infectious diseases, including EVD. The importance of PPE was recognized during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), in which HCP accounted for $ 20% of persons who were infected with SARS. 3 Evidence of continued SARS transmission despite the use of droplet, contact, and airborne precautions drew attention to the possibility of nosocomial transmission during PPE removal or doffing. 4, 5 In addition, recent studies suggest that viruses, including Ebola, have the potential to remain infectious on PPE for longer than it is typically worn, creating an opportunity for transmission during doffing. Historically, development of PPE strategies has been driven by the paradigm that infectious agents are transmitted by 1 of 3 routes: contact, droplet, or airborne. However, the consideration of self-inoculation in the removal of PPE is emerging as a major potential route of HCP infection. 6 To this end, we reviewed the major routes of Ebola virus transmission and the use of PPE to prevent HCP exposure and infection.",

            "text": "Once the Ebola virus enters the human population, outbreaks are sustained through human-to-human transmission, which is facilitated by the presence of the virus in every body fluid, including blood, diarrhea, vomit, sweat, breast milk, vaginal secretions, and semen. 7, 8 Ebola virus increases logarithmically in the blood during acute infection, and often the highest levels of viremia are achieved at the time of death. 9 In addition, patients in the later stages of disease have more severe symptoms, including diarrhea, vomiting, and bleeding complications, thus increasing the potential of spread via infectious body fluids. This coupled with limited health care infrastructure in the areas where most Ebola outbreaks occur contribute to the outbreak amplification that is often seen in health care settings. [10] [11] [12] Epidemiologic studies suggest that the virus is spread primarily through direct contact with the patient and virus-laden body fluids, especially late in the clinical course of disease. 11, 13, 14 Of 173 household contacts of 27 infected patients, 28 (16%) developed EVD. 13 All 28 cases reported direct physical contact with the index patient (risk ratio \u00bc 3.6; 95% CI, 1.9-6.8). 13 Importantly, none of the 78 household members who reported no direct contact with the index patient developed EVD. In a separate study those family members who provided direct nursing care to the index patient had a 5.1-fold increased risk of infection, highlighting the importance of direct contact. 11 The risk of secondary transmission, in a separate study, increased with exposures that continued through the later states of illness (crude prevalence proportion ratio [ 15 Given the high levels of virus in body fluids and on the skin of patients at the time of death, postmortem contact is also associated with an increased risk of infection (adjusted risk ratio \u00bc 2.1; 95% CI, 1.1-4.2). 13, 16 The increased potential for transmission during contact with a dead body, as occurs during traditional burial practices, can be partly attributed to the durability of virus in body fluids even after death. In a nonhuman primate study of viral persistence after death, replication competent virus was detectable in oral, nasal, and blood samples from dead animals. Blood contained the highest concentrations of viable virus (2 \u00c2 10 5 median culture infectious dose/ mL) and remained positive for the longest duration, 7 days postmortem. 17 Viral RNA was detectible from oral nasal and blood swabs for up to 3 weeks postmortem. 17 Together, these data highlight close contact with a dead body, as is custom during preparing a body for funeral, is a potential route of transmission.",

In 1 study, filoviruses, including Ebola, were found to remain infectious in liquid media at room temperature for at least 46 days, but infectious virus could not be isolated when allowed to dry on a plastic or glass substrate at room temperature. 19 Reports from the current outbreak indicate that multiple environmental samples obtained from an Ebola treatment unit were positive for polymerase chain reaction. 10 However, when sampling occurred after routine cleaning in a separate study, all 31 environmental samples were negative, suggesting that routine sanitation, as part of environmental control, can decrease the potential of fomite transmission. 20 Recently, the potential for airborne transmission has received considerable attention. 10, 21 Although animal studies suggest that this is possible when virus is experimentally aerosolized, epidemiologic studies of household contacts indicate that this is not a primary means of transmission. 11, 13, 14, [22] [23] [24] In addition, the institution of barrier protection with the use of surgical masks that do not protect against airborne transmission has historically been sufficient to eliminate nosocomial transmission and HCP infection. 25 Higher risks of airborne or droplet transmission is likely to occur in health care settings during aerosolgenerating procedures such as induced sputum procedures and/or intubation.",

Similarly, administrative controls alter the delivery of care to mitigate potential exposures such as implementation of infection control precautions, patient triage for rapid identification of suspect cases of EVD with immediate isolation of the patient in a single room, establishment of specific donning and doffing protocols, the presence of donning and doffing monitors, and policies on medical procedures. During the Ebola outbreak in Kikwit, Zaire, in 1995, 67 HCPs were infected while providing care in an isolation unit plagued by a lack of water and electricity, a shortage of PPE, and an absence of appropriate waste disposal. 25 After the implementation of environmental and administrative controls in the establishment of a properly functioning Ebola treatment unit the rate of HCP infections decreased dramatically. 25 Collectively, environmental and administrative controls are critical infection control measures that work to arrest potential chains of transmission in health care settings.",

Designated areas that allow for clear separation between donning and doffing is critical because doffing involves potential exposure to contaminated body fluids on the outside of used PPE. Moreover, clear delineation between high-and low-risk areas and when PPE is needed and not needed are paramount to ensuring that PPE is used appropriately to mitigate risks of exposure to sources of infection. Secondly, training in the use of PPE before providing care for suspect or confirmed patients is crucial because there is a learning associated with providing routine tasks in unfamiliar situations. In addition, the heat stress associated with the use of PPE in tropical climates is an occupational hazard that, in some instances, can increase the risk of accidents and thus exposure if not recognized early. Behavioral controls are also a fundamental aspect of infection control strategies. On average a person will touch his or her eyes, lips, and nostrils at a rate of 15.7 times per hour. 33 In Ebola endemic countries during this epidemic, there was a policy of no touch in which people do not hug, kiss, or shake hands to avoid potential transmission outside of Ebola treatment units. Refraining from touching one's face and frequent handwashing is encouraged to reduce the potential of self-inoculation.

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, which are directed toward the use of PPE in US hospitals, recommend mucous membrane coverage with either an N-95 particulate respiratory or a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR) that incorporates a full-face shield, helmet, or headpiece. 34 If an N-95 respiratory is used, it must be accompanied by a single-use surgical hood that extends to the shoulders and a full-face shield. Similarly, if a PAPR is used with a helmet or headpiece, it also must be used in combination with a disposable hood that extends to the shoulders and fully covers the neck. The WHO recommendations, which pertain to care of Ebola-infected patients regardless of location, include the use of a face shield or goggles to protect conjunctival membranes and either a fluid-resistant medical/surgical mask that does not collapse against the mouth (eg, duckbill or cup shape) or a fluid-resistant particulate respiratory if aerosol-generating procedures will be performed. 35 In both cases, the WHO offers a conditional recommendation that health care providers also wear a separate head cover that protects the head and neck. This recommendation is conditional because there is no evidence to support the use of a head cover or hair cap for preventing infection. 35 Although the use of a PAPR provides enclosed protection and full visualization of the provider's face, the logistical obstacles of disinfection after each use, need for reliable electricity to power the unit, and the cost limit these from being widely used in the field. Similarly, because Ebola does not appear to be efficiently transmitted via an aerosol route, a surgical mask can be used to protect against droplet transmission, although an N-95 if available provides better protection against airborne agents. However, given the length of time it takes to don and doff PPE and the inability to change components of PPE while inside a high-risk area, many in the field enter with a particulate respirator in case a patient is coughing, aggressively vomiting, or undergoing a procedure that could generate secondary aerosolization. No evidence is found of increased efficacy of either face shields or goggles in the prevention of Ebola virus transmission, but both have advantages and disadvantages. Goggles offer complete enclosure around the eyes, preventing inadvertent touching with potentially soiled gloves, but they provide a more limited range of view compared with face shields. However, face shields allow more of the HCP's face to be visible during patient care, which facilitates communication and potentially decreases patient anxiety. Although fogging affects both face shields and goggles, reducing visibility, it may affect face shields to a lesser degree.",

The resistance of commercially available gowns/coveralls is assessed by their ability to prevent passage of a nonenveloped DNA virus, phiX174, under different degrees of pressure. 36 Resistance, however, must be balanced by tolerance of use by health care providers who work in tropical conditions because increased resistance impairs evaporative cooling and may decrease the time HCP can provide care. If a fluidresistant gown is worn, it should extend beyond the top of the footwear or shoe covers (see Foot Protection). The integration of thumb loops may be beneficial in securing complete protection of the wrist area. The WHO guidelines recommend against the use of tape to attach gloves to gowns/coveralls because this may increase the risk of tearing the gown/coverall and complicate the doffing procedure at a time when health care providers are potentially most vulnerable. 35, 37 The use of a waterproof or impermeable apron worn over the gown/coverall is recommended to provide further protection against infectious body fluids.

The variability in recommended PPE by different organizations and hospitals necessitates variation in donning and doffing order because the order will change with each PPE item added or removed. It is imperative that this order is established, optimized, and taught before it is being used to ensure feasibility and success.",

A nonpathogenic nonenveloped bacteriophage, MS2, has been used to assess safety of PPE and donning and doffing protocols in non-Ebola settings. 39 Although filovriuses are single-stranded enveloped RNA viruses, the use of MS2 is a conservative surrogate because the absence of an envelope likely improves the ability of this virus to maintain its infectiousness in the environment. In addition, the current CDC recommendations for environmental decontamination of an Ebola care area are consistent with those needed to decontaminate nonenveloped viruses.",

After the SARS outbreak the CDC sequence for removing PPE was evaluated with the use of a nonenveloped, nonpathogenic RNA virus and Glogerm (Glo Germ Company, Moab, Utah) fluorescent synthetic beads. 40 The fluorescent tracer was found not to be a reliable indicator of virus contamination because virus was recovered from both areas that fluoresced and areas that did not fluoresce. In this study, virus was recovered from the scrub shirt of 100% of participants, the nondominant hand in 80%, and scrub pants in 75%. 40 The highest virus titer was recovered from the scrub shirt. The use of fluorescent tracer provided false confidence because it was found on the shirt, nondominant hand, and scrub pants in 10%, 10%, and 0% of research participants, respectively. 40 The use of double gloving, however, significantly reduced not only the incidence of hand contamination with virus but also the quantity of virus that was transmitted to HCP hands, thus providing better protection against viral contamination during PPE removal.",

Areas that were more likely to be contaminated included the anterior neck, forearm, hands, and wrists. However, those persons donning the PAPR system were more likely to commit donning procedure violations, highlighting the increased difficulty of donning and doffing with more complex PPE. Fortunately, there were no significant differences in doffing procedure violations between the 2 groups. 5 Although PPE is often only worn for short periods of time, pathogenic viruses such as influenza, SARS, and Ebola can survive for extended periods of time on surfaces and be sources of transmission via surface-tohand and hand-to-face/mucous membrane contact. Despite 2 layers of protective clothing and 2 pairs of gloves, hand hygiene remains an essential aspect of PPE because previous studies have reported that organisms can spread from gloves to hands after glove removal. 41 ",

PPE worn in these settings significantly increase the risk of heat stress and pose yet another risk to the HCP. The risk of heat stress when wearing PPE depends on a number of factors, including length of work shift, ambient temperatures, hydration status, and preexisting medical conditions among others. Strategies to mitigate the risk of heat stress for HCP must be implemented such as the use of buddy systems to monitor the health of providers inside the high-risk area, hydration breaks in between shifts, and consideration of time limitations in staffing determinations. In addition, other strategies were used in the current outbreak, including the use of cooling vests and air conditioning, which have extended the time that providers can spend with patients. Ongoing studies by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health are evaluating the effect of different types of PPE on core body temperature. 42 Recommendations from the CDC for reducing heat stress-related complications include the following 43 : (1) educate HCP how PPE places them at a higher risk of heat-related illness, (2) acclimatize HCP to PPE conditions by gradually increasing their time working in PPE, (3) stay well hydrated, (4) watch for signs and symptoms of heat-related illness, and (5) ensure adequate breaks in between shifts to rest and cool down.",

In addition to the unprecedented numbers of infections and deaths, this epidemic has also decimated the HCP population that will leave an already susceptible region at risk well beyond the end of this epidemic. In this epidemic 869 HCP were infected and 507 died to date, more than any other Ebola outbreak and likely more than all previous outbreaks combined. Protection of HCP who bravely work on the front lines must be a priority. Although the use of PPE is an integral part of HCP safety, it must be used as part of a universal infection prevention and control strategy that incorporates environmental and administrative controls, sustained logistical support, and the use of scientific evidence to back current recommendations. There have been 25 outbreaks since the Ebola virus was discovered in 1976, and they are occurring with increased frequency. The question is not whether another outbreak will occur, but when. Improved PPE and evidencebased recommendations are a priority.",
