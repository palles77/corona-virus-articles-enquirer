Bcl-XL has been shown to homodimerize in different ways, although most binding and structural assays have been carried out in the absence of its carboxyl terminal transmembrane domain. We show here that this domain can by itself direct protein oligomerization, which could be related to its previously reported role in mitochondrial morphology alterations and apoptosis inhibition.",

            "text": "Apoptosis is a type of cell death characterized by the silent elimination of unnecessary or damaged cells, which is required for development and tissue homeostasis. Two major routes of apoptosis have been described: the extrinsic route is initiated at the cell surface and mediated by death receptors, like Fas-CD95 [1] ; the intrinsic route is mediated by mitochondria [2] , where many different signals are integrated and the final decision about the fate of the cell is made. Both routes are linked in some cells by Bid, a member of the Bcl-2 protein family [3] . Bcl-2 family members participate directly in the decision step [4] . Pro-apoptotic members of this family, Bax and Bak, have been shown to permeabilize the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM), facilitating the release to the cytosol of intermembrane space (IMS) proteins like cytochrome c [5] , AIF [6] or Smac/DIABLO [7, 8] . These proteins then activate a series of caspase-dependent or -independent mechanisms that dismantle the cell. A second mechanism for the release of apoptotic factors from the IMS involves permeability transition, which allows the entry of water in the matrix with subsequent burst of the MOM [9] .",

PSAP was first identified as a presenilin-1 associated protein with homology to inner membrane mitochondrial carriers, and therefore is also known as mitochondrial carrier homolog 1 (Mtch1) [24] . The importance of its closest homolog, Mtch2, in Bid-induced apoptosis has been reported recently [25] . We reported that PSAP is a MOM protein with two pro-apoptotic domains [23] . Since apoptosis induction by these domains could depend on interactions with other proteins, we sought to analyze PSAP interactions by crosslinking. These assays suggested that the TMD of Bcl-XL could be involved in oligomerization, which was confirmed analyzing fusions to monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP).",

When HEK293 cells expressing the first 168 residues of PSAP fused to the TMD of Bcl-XL (PSAP 1-168 TMD Bcl-XL, 21 kDa) were treated with BSOCOES, a band was observed by western blot suggesting dimerization of the protein (Fig. 1, lane 2) . Similar results were obtained with the protein containing the TMD of VAMP2 (PSAP 1-168 TMD VAMP2, 21.2 kDa). Since both proteins share the same PSAP sequences, we first assumed that PSAP was mediating dimerization. Nevertheless, a literature search indicated that the TMD of VAMP2 is responsible for its homo or heteromerization at the ER membrane [28] , suggesting that the dimers observed in our experiments could depend on TMD instead of PSAP sequences. This interpretation could also explain a band migrating between those corresponding to the monomer (21.2 kDa) and dimer (42.4 Fig. 1 , as a heterodimer between endogenous VAMP2 (12.6 kDa) and PSAP 1-168 TMD VAMP2 (expected molecular mass: 33.8 kDa, marked with an asterisk in Fig. 1 ).

The pattern obtained indicated the presence of oligomers up to pentamers, although less abundant (or less stable) than the dimers. These data clearly indicate the involvement of the TMD of Bcl-XL in selfassociation, an event that had not been reported previously. The fact that only dimers could be observed upon crosslinking could be due to the location of the reacting amino groups in the oligomers. Crosslinking covalently fixes those interactions where reacting groups (amino groups in this case) are localized in close proximity, and uncrosslinked molecules are separated later during denaturing electrophoresis. Blue native electrophoresis does not rely on specific reactive groups but on the overall stability of protein complexes where individual molecules are held together by non-covalent bonds. It could be that, in our complexes, reacting amino groups are only located closely between monomers of a single dimer, and dimers associate in oligomers in such a way that adjacent dimers cannot be crosslinked with each other. This could explain why dimers are mainly observed upon crosslinking whereas oligomers are observed after blue-native electrophoresis.",

Interestingly, C-terminal cleavage products of Bcl-XL can form a pore large enough to allow cytochrome c release [40] , changing a pro-survival protein into a pro-apoptotic one, what has been also described for Bcl-2 upon binding of a Nur77-derived peptide [41] .

Interestingly, a similar sequence is present in the TMD of Bcl-XL, but in tandem (GMTVAGVVLLG: GMTVAG and GVVLLG), with one more amino acid between the two glycines (GXXXXG). The presence of sequence GXXXG in tandem had been previously described in other proteins [35, 38] .

Sequence specificity in the dimerization of transmembrane alpha-helices was first reported by Lemmon et al. [31] , reporting later that the pattern LIxxGVxxGVxxT is involved in dimerization [44] . Furthermore, the GXXXG motif has been involved in the formation of a membrane channel by the Helicobacter pylori vacuolating toxin [38] , where this motif appears in three tandem repeats. This motif has also been found in several other proteins, like subunits e [45] and g [46] of yeast mitochondrial ATP synthase, APH-1 [47] , ABCG2 [48] , the SARS coronavirus spike protein (were it is involved in trimerization) [49] , prion protein [50] , amyloid precursor protein [51] , the two-peptide bacteriocin lactococcin G [52] , carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A [53] , ErbB [54] , protein FliH and its Type III secretion homologue YscL [55] , the Japanese encephalitis virus precursor membrane (prM) protein [56] , the PufX polypeptide of Rhodobacter sphaeroides RC-LH1 photosynthetic complex [57] , human organic anion transporter 1 (hOAT1) [58] , VDAC1 [59] and the NS4B protein of hepatitis c virus [60] . A review about some of these proteins can be seen in Senes et al. [61] .",
