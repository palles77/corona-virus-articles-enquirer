In vitro activation of macrophages (M<I\u00bb by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) delayed MHV3 replication only in cells that originated from AI] mice, although cell populations from both AI] and BALB/c mice were able to synthesize comparable amounts of IFN-a/~. Using specific antibodies, we have shown that the delayed MHV3 replication in LPS-activated AI] M<I> was due, in part, to IFN-a/~. AI] M<I> were found to be more sensitive to IFN-y than to IFN-a/~, and BALB/c M<I> did not develop an antiviral state to either IFN. Cultured spleen cells from AI] mice synthesized more IFN-y than BALB/c spleen cells after specific or non-specific stimulation. The results indicate that IFN-activated M<I> may playa crucial role in the resistance to MHV3 infection. Since IFN-y is produced in large amounts by AI] spleen cells after specific stimulation with MHV3 and is efficient in activating the AI] M<I>, a T cell-dependent mechanism is likely to be involved.",

Surprisingly, significant amounts of IFN-y were systematically detected very early in sera and principally in peritoneal exudates of infected mice. Although under investigation, it can be speculated that the ability of cultured spleen cells from these animals, of synthesizing high amounts of IFN-y after a specific stimulation (Table 2) , and the rapid virus growth after infection can account for this early in vivo IFN-y synthesis that was observed.

The reduction in virus titer temporarily resulted in a delay in the exponential rise in virus titer rather than an absolute inhibition of virus growth. This is probably due to the fact that the M<I> release IFN-a/B which was shown to be much less efficient in inducing an anti-MHV3 state when compared to IFN-y (Fig. 4a) . Nevertheless, more than one mechanism seems to be involved in this partial restriction that was observed, because when these cells were cultivated in the presence of antibodies to IFN-a/~ (Table 1) , LPS treatment was still able to induce some inhibition of MHV3 growth. In this situation, all the released IFN was neutralized by the antibodies present in the supernatants. Although the presence of intracellularly active IFN cannot be repudiated, a role of an IFN-independent mechanism developed during the LPS activation must be considered. This notion is consistent with a previous study where it was shown that mice can be protected from MHV3 infection by an IFN-independent mechanism of Mel> activation by Corynebacterium parvum (17) .",

Thus, it was of interest to study the ability of immune spleen cells from both mouse strains to synthesize IFN-y (or immune IFN) after a specific or non-specific stimulation. The data presented in Table 2 show that AI] and BALB/c spleen cells were able to synthesize IFN-y, but those originating from the resistant AI] mouse strain were capable of producing higher amounts after stimulation with ConA or MHV3. The greater ability of immune spleen cells after specific stimulation to produce IFN-y can be linked to the very early IFN-y synthesis in vivo after MHV3 infection. The observation that infected BALB/c mice synthesize more IFN-y than infected AI] mice does not correlate with the levels of the in vitro IFN-y synthesized by their spleen cells, and can be explained by the different level of stimulation occurring in vivo, with much virus in BALBI c mice stimulating the immune system, and in vitro, with the same amount of virus for cell stimulation.",

            "text": "Our results show that there is a link between both mechanisms that have been proposed for the resistance to MHV3. We believe the capacity of Mel> from mice to restrict viral multiplication depends partially on their sensitivity to IFN, which is synthesized very early in the immune response. Therefore, this may explain why the resistant mice can rapidly clear the virus and the susceptible mice die shortly after infection. Resistant mice, which have Mel> that are very sensitive to IFN-y in order to develop an anti-MHV3 state, are also capable of producing reasonable amounts of IFN-y in the course of the immune response against MHV3 (Fig. 2a and Table 2 ). Thus, soon after initiation of infection, the virus particles could be neutralized and the infection cleared in a few days. Alternatively, we speculate that susceptible mice have M <I> that are not sensitive to IFN in order to develop an anti-MHV3 state (Fig. 4b) , and despite high concentrations of IFN-y in the serum and peritoneal fluid during the first days of infection (Fig. 2b) , the M<I> cannot display a restriction of virus multiplication. Accordingly, these animals die 5 to 6 days after the infection with high concentrations of IFN-y, reflecting the virus replication and stimulation of the immune system. Nevertheless, the participation of other mechanisms in the susceptibility, such as the expression of procoagulant activity (5, 16) , is not excluded and may be involved in the course of the disease.",
