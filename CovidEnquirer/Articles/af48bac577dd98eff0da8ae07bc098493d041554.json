A massive body of information has accumulated on the aetiology of viral diseases and the viruses that cause them and one might perhaps be forgiven for thinking that there is little left to learn. But of course biological surprises invariably catch us out. Viruses unexpectedly emerge in new situations through genetic reassortment, or by recombination of virus genes, or by jumping the species barrier. Recent severe outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and H5N1 influenza are just two reminders of our vulnerability.",

Since their characterisation in the early 1990s, human noroviruses have hit the headlines in the popular press, not for the severity of the disease they cause, but because of their association with 'winter vomiting disease' syndrome, which sweeps through hospital wards, cruise ships and other closed communities. The layman might ask why, after so many years of virus research, is it only now that we hear about these 'new' viruses? This leads us to think about how we detect viruses, and, in particular, those viruses that inhabit the gut.",

It is similar with our understanding of infectious diseases. Inoculation of animals with material passed through filters that retained bacteria demonstrated the existence of viruses. Then came the egg, a sterile package of different cell types, which allowed for the identification of a number of quite different viruses, for example, influenza and pox viruses. Eggs are still used today to produce influenza vaccines. The next major technical revolution, and one that led to an explosion of viral knowledge, was the ability to grow and maintain a range of cell types in the laboratory. A huge number of viruses were identified by their ability to produce a variety of cytopathic effects that could be visualised using the light microscope.",

Up to the 1970s, viruses were suspected of causing much diarrhoeal disease but proof was hard to come by. Something was clearly missing.",

When used to examine fluids from infected eggs or cell cultures after negative staining (Brenner and Horne, 1959) , the previously unforeseen, but exquisite, structure of viruses was revealed -from the orderly nature of adenoviruses to the complex structure of poxviruses. Application of EM to the causes of diarrhoeal disease took until the late 1960s, which is, perhaps, not surprising considering the nature of the material to be examined and the perceived requirement for highly purified material for EM. Once applied to faecal material, however, unrecognised viruses revealed themselves, and often in large numbers. Rotaviruses, astroviruses and calici-like viruses were identified for the first time -the latter two being quaintly called 'fuzzy wuzzies' because of their indistinct appearance (Saif, 1990) .",
