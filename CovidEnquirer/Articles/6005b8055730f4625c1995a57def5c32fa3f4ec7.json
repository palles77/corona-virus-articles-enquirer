According to a 2014 World Health Organization (WHO) report, in Saudi Arabia, the incidence of TB is 12/100,000 population and the prevalence is 16/100,000 population. [4] Further, the majority of cases are of pulmonary origin (75%), while extrapulmonary TB constitutes only 25% of the cases. [4] However, the patient in this report most likely had a latent TB infection, as he had arrived in Saudi Arabia only 4 months before his presentation. In fact, according to a 2009 WHO report, Philippines ranks 9 th among the world's top 22 high-burden countries for TB and 8 th among the world's top 27 priority countries for multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant TB. [5] The patient in this report presented with extrapulmonary TB, and later developed pulmonary TB. Memish et al. reported that the most common site for extrapulmonary TB in Saudi Arabia is lymph nodes. [6] TB has been associated with several hematological abnormalities including anemia, leukocytosis, monocytosis, leuckopenia, lymphopenia, leukemoid reactions, pancytopenia, thrombocytosis and thrombocytopenia. [7] TB-induced immune thrombocytopenia, as was the case in the patient of this report, is rare. ITP is defined as isolated thrombocytopenia with no clinically apparent associated conditions or other causes of thrombocytopenia. Common secondary causes of thrombocytopenia such as medications, viral infection, systemic lupus erythematosus and leukemia had been excluded in this patient through history and negative investigations, but the possibility of diagnosis of lymphoma or TB could not be excluded during the first presentation because the patient refused lymph node biopsy. The absence of granuloma in the bone marrow biopsy also delayed the diagnosis of TB. Further, bone marrow culture for TB was also not requested.",

            "text": "Thrombocytopenia with TB can occur because of a defect in platelet production related to bone marrow infiltration, as a side effect of anti-TB therapy, splenomegaly or concomitant histiophagocytosis, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, DIC or immune-mediated platelet destruction. The initial response to IVIG and steroids in this patient supports the immune bases of TB-induced thrombocytopenia. The mechanism of TB-related ITP remains unclear, although it has been postulated that the activation of B lymphocytes by Mycobacterium tuberculosis leads to the production of antiplatelet antibodies or that M. tuberculosis may share antigen with the platelets, leading to the production of antiplatelet antibodies. [8] The antiplatelet antibodies were not measured in this patient, as in the 2011 American Society of Hematology guidelines, the evidence to recommend measuring antiplatelet antibodies during diagnosis of ITP is insufficient. [9] As stated above, the occurrence of ITP during TB infection is exceedingly rare and only few cases have been reported in the literature. In a study from Saudi Arabia comprising 846 cases of active TB, only 9 (1%) presented with ITP as the sole presentation. Of these 9 cases, 3 had pulmonary TB, 3 abdominal abscess or lymphadenitis and 3 disseminated (miliary) TB. All patients had purpura, the platelet count varied between 4 and 21 \u00d7 10 9 /L and the bone marrow showed increased megakaryocytes. [3] In a review by Tsuro et al., [10] pulmonary TB constituted 31% of all ITP cases, TB lymphadenitis 31% and miliary TB 27%. Most patients were of Middle Eastern and Asian descent. Similarly, the patient in this report is from an Asian descent and TB lymphadenitis was the initial presentation but was later found to have lung involvement.",
