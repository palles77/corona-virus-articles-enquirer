On February 7, 2020, this simple model predicted that the death toll would reach 2000 in ten days, a staggering number at the time that later materialized, unfortunately. We also converted the raw number of cases as percent daily changes and conducted a similar forecast. Interestingly, daily percent changes in both confirmed cases and deaths in China are decreasing linearly except for a few outliers (see Figure 16 and 18 in Supplementary Document 2).",

The hundreds of cities could even be considered as semi-independent outbreaks, as many of them are far from the epicenter and effectively on lockdown from the end of January 2020. As shown in Figures 5 and 6 in Supp. Doc. 2, the death rate, estimated by dividing current total deaths by total confirmed cases, in Wuhan is 4.47%. Probably due to an overwhelmed healthcare system, this death rate is higher than the average of 2.92% (95% confidence interval [2.35% -3.38%]) observed in 22 Chinese cities with 200 or more confirmed cases. Cities in Hubei province have higher fatality rates than cities in other regions (Figure 6 in Supp. Doc. 2). Internationally, the death rate in Japan (2.50%) is close to that of Italy (2.60%), lower than the 3.67% observed in China overall (Figure 17 in Supp. Doc. 2). The death rate in Iran is 9.63%, probably due to underreported cases.",

With this package, epidemiologists and other scientists can directly access data from four sources, facilitating mathematical modeling and forecasting of the COVID-19 outbreak. The interactive web apps are accessible to the general public and could also be easily customized by researchers to produce other dashboards or track other countries.
