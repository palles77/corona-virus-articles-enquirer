The RTC is generated by 48 translation of the genomic RNA into two large polyproteins that are extensively auto-49 proteolytically processed by viral proteases to give rise to 16 processing end-products, termed 50 non-structural proteins (nsps) 1-16. Nsp1 is rapidly cleaved from the polyproteins and not 51 considered an integral component of the coronaviral RTC, but interferes with host cell 52 translation by inducing degradation of cellular mRNAs (10-12). Although it has not yet been 53 formally demonstrated, the remaining nsps (2-16) are thought to comprise the RTC and harbor 54 multiple enzymes and functions, such as de-ubiquitination, proteases, helicase, polymerase, 55 exo-and endonuclease, and N7-and 2'O-methyltransferases (13-18). Many of these functions 56 have been studied using reverse genetic approaches, which revealed their importance in virus-57 host interactions (19-23). In most cases phenotypes were described via loss-of-function 58 mutagenesis, however, in the context of virus infection, the specific interactions of RTC 59 components with host cell factors remain largely unknown. 60 .

Likewise, genome-wide CRISPR-based screens have been applied to 63 other positive-stranded RNA viruses, such as flaviviruses, and identified critical host proteins 64 required for replication (29, 30). Some of these proteins were described in the context of 65 distinct ER processes, such as N-linked glycosylation, ER-associated protein degradation 66 (ERAD), and signal peptide insertion and processing. Although individual proteins identified 67 by these screens may interact with viral replication complexes, they likely constitute only a 68 small fraction of the global replicase microenvironment. 69",

            "text": "To capture the full breadth of host cell proteins and cellular pathways that are spatially 70 associated with viral RTCs, we employed a proximity-based labeling approach involving a 71 promiscuous E. coli-derived biotin ligase (BirAR118G). BirAR118G biotinylates proximal (<10 72 nm) proteins in live cells without disrupting intracellular membranes or protein complexes, and 73 hence, does not rely on high affinity protein-protein interactions, but is able to permanently tag 74 transient interactions (31). Covalent protein biotinylation allows stringent lysis and washing 75 conditions during affinity purification and subsequent mass spectrometric identification of 76 captured factors. By engineering a recombinant MHV harboring BirAR118G as an integral 77 component of the RTC we identified >500 host proteins reflecting the molecular 78 microenvironment of MHV replication structures. siRNA-mediated silencing of each of these 79 factors highlighted, amongst others, the functional importance of vesicular ER-Golgi apparatus 80 trafficking pathways, ubiquitin-dependent and autophagy-related catabolic processes, and 81 translation initiation factors. Importantly, the detection of active translation in close proximity 82 to the viral RTC highlighted the critical involvement of translation initiation factors during 83 coronavirus replication.

This strategy was recently employed by 93 Freeman et al. for a fusion of green fluorescent protein (GFP) with nsp2 (34).

Although the silencing of a subset of host translation 313 factors severely restricted MHV replication, effective knockdown of these factors (Fig. S3c) 314 did not affect cell viability (Fig. S3b, d) and only moderately affected host cell translation 315 levels (Fig. 4f, S3e). This data demonstrates that the reduced viral replication observed after 316 siRNA knockdown is not due to a general impairment of host translation. 317 Subsequently, we aimed to visualize the localization of active translation during virus infection 318 by puromycin incorporation into nascent polypeptides on immobilized ribosomes 319 (ribopuromycylation) followed by fluorescence imaging using antibodies directed against 320 puromycin (55). In non-infected L929 cells, ribopuromycylation resulted in an expected 321 diffuse, mainly cytosolic, staining pattern interspersed with punctate structures indicative of 322 translation localized to dedicated subcellular cytosolic locations (Fig. 5). In striking contrast, 323 MHV-infected L929 cells displayed a pronounced enrichment of actively translating ribosomes 324 near the viral RTC as indicated by the strong overlap between the viral replicase and the 325 ribopuromycylation stain. Interestingly, active translation in vicinity of the RTC was strongest 326 during the early phase of infection at 6 h.p.i., and was observed until 8 h.p.i., before gradually 327 decreasing as the infection advanced along with the appearance of typical syncytia formation 328 indicative of cytopathic effect (CPE). 329",

Finally, we further 337 demonstrated that active translation is localized to the site of MERS-CoV RNA synthesis as 338 dsRNA puncta highly overlapped with the ribopuromycylation stain in MERS-CoV-infected 339Huh7 cells(Fig. 6). Collectively, these results not only confirm the spatial link between 340 individual components of the host cell translation machinery and coronavirus replication 341 compartments as identified by proximity-dependent biotinylation using MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2, 342 but they also demonstrate that active translation is taking place in close proximity to the study, we made use of a recently developed system based on proximity-dependent 347 biotinylation of host factors in living cells (31). By engineering a promiscuous biotin ligase 348 (BirAR118G) as an integral component of the coronavirus replication complex, we provide a 349 novel approach to define the molecular mircoenvironment of viral replication complexes that 350 is applicable to many other RNA and DNA viruses.351 We show that nsp2 fusion proteins encoded by recombinant MHV-APEX2-nsp2 and MHV-352 BirAR118G-nsp2, are indeed part of the RTC and localize to characteristic coronavirus 353 . Notably, in MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2-infected cells the 357 detection of biotinylated coronavirus replicase gene products nsp2-10, nsp12-16, and the 358 nucleocapsid protein by mass spectrometry demonstrates that these proteins are in close 359 proximity during infection. This extends previous immunofluorescence and electron 360 microscopic studies that were limited by the availability of nsp-specific antibodies and could 361 only show localization of individual nsps to coronavirus replicative structures (4, 8, 35-37). 362 Moreover, the close proximity of BirAR118G-nsp2 to MHV replicative enzymes, such as the 363 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (nsp12), the NTPase/helicase (nsp13), the 5'-cap 364 methyltransferases (nsp14, nsp16), the proof-reading exonuclease (nsp14), in MHV-BirAR118G-365 nsp2-infected cells further suggest close proximity of nsp2 to the site of viral RNA synthesis. 366 We thus propose that nsp2-16 and the nucleocapsid protein collectively constitute a functional 367 coronavirus replication and transcription complex in infected cells. 368 The analysis of the host proteome enriched at MHV replication sites revealed a comprehensive 369 list of host proteins that constitute the coronavirus RTC microenvironment. This included 370 several individual factors and host cell pathways, especially transport mechanisms involving 371 vesicle-mediated trafficking, which have previously been shown to assist coronavirus 372 replication. (24, 26, 27, 49, 52). Moreover, numerous coronavirus RTC-proximal host proteins 373 and pathways also have documented roles in the life cycle of other, more intensively studied, 374 positive-stranded RNA viruses, suggesting considerable commonalities and conserved virus-375 host interactions at the replication complexes of a broad range of RNA viruses (29, 30, 56). 376 Importantly, our list of RTC-proximal proteins by far exceeds the number of host cell proteins 377 currently known to interact with viral replication complexes and the vast majority of MHV 378",

The data presented here indicate that coronaviruses have evolved a similar 410 strategy by compartmentalizing and directing viral RNA synthesis to sites of ER-associated 411 translation. Likewise, this strategy has a number of advantages. Coronaviruses would not 412 require sophisticated transport mechanisms that direct viral mRNA to distantly located 413 ribosomes. A close spatial association of viral RNA synthesis and translation during early post-414 entry events would rather allow for remodeling the ER-associated translation machinery to 415 ensure translation of viral mRNA in a protected microenvironment. Viruses have evolved 416 diverse mechanisms to facilitate translation of their mRNAs including highly diverse internal nsp2 -mediated labelling approach to identify RTC-proximal cellular processes that 429 significantly contribute to viral replication. Indeed, the ability of BirAR118G to label viral and 430 host factors independently of high affinity and prolonged molecular interactions enables the 431 establishment of a comprehensive repertoire reflecting the history of protein association with 432 the viral RTC, recorded during the entire course of infection. In future studies it will be 433 important to provide an \"RTC-association map\" with temporal resolution. Like we have seen 434 for translation initiation factors in this study, association of host cell proteins with the viral 435 RTC might not persist throughout the entire replication cycle but might be of importance only 436 transiently or during specific phases of the replication cycle. Given its short labelling time, 437 APEX2 indeed offers this possibility to dissect protein recruitment to the viral RTC in a time-438 resolved manner, i.e. to detect RTC-associated host proteins at specific time points post 439 infection. This will ultimately result in a dynamic, high resolution molecular landscape of 440 virus-host interactions at the RTC and provide an additional impetus to elucidate critical virus-441 host interactions that take place at the site of viral RNA synthesis. These interactions should 442 be exploited in the development of novel strategies to combat virus infection, based on 443 conserved mechanisms of interactions at replication complexes of a broad range of positive1774 was used for the generation of MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2 and MHV-APEX2-nsp2.

Additionally, ribosome-bound 697 puromycin was detected using a monoclonal AlexaFluor647-conjugated anti-puromycin 698 antibody (clone 12D10, Merk Millipore). Slides were mounted, imaged and processed as 699 described above. 700 701 DAB staining and transmission electron microscopy 702 L929 fibroblasts were seeded in 24-well plates and infected with MHV-APEX2-nsp2, MHV-703 A59, or non-infected for 10 h. 3,3-diaminobenzidine (DAB) stains were performed as described 704 previously (38). Briefly, cells were fixed at 10 h.p.i. using warm 2% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in 705 100 mM sodium cacodylate, pH 7.4, supplemented with 2 mM calcium chloride (cacodylate 706 buffer) and placed on ice for 60 min. The following incubations were performed on ice in ice-707 cold buffers unless stated otherwise. Cells were washed 3x with sodium cacodylate buffer, 708 quenched with 20 mM glycine in cacodylate buffer for 5 min. before 3 additional washes with 709 cacodylate buffer. Cells were stained in cacodylate buffer containing 0.5 mg/ml DAB and 10 710 mM H2O2 for 20 min until DAB precipitates were visible by light microscopy. Cells were 711 30 min at room temperature or overnight at 4 \u00b0C. After three washes in 716 cacodylate buffer for 10 min each, cells were post-fixed with 1% OsO4 (Chemie Brunschwig, 717 Basel, Switzerland) in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C and again washed three times 718 with cacodylate buffer. Thereafter, cells were dehydrated in an ascending ethanol series (70%, 719 80%, 90%, 94%, 100% (v/v) for 20 min each) and embedded in Epon resin, a mixture of Epoxy 720 embedding medium, dodecenyl succinic anhydride (DDSA) and methyl nadic anhydride 721 (MNA) (Sigma Aldrich, Buchs, Switzerland). Ultrathin sections of 90 nm were then obtained 722 with diamond knives (Diatome, Biel, Switzerland) on a Reichert-Jung Ultracut E (Leica, 723 Heerbrugg, Switzerland) and collected on collodion-coated 200-mesh copper grids (Electron 724 Figure legends",

The positive-sense RNA genome of MHV 735 contains a 5' cap and a 3' poly(A) tail. ORF1a and ORF1b encode the viral replication and 736 transcription complex (nsp1-16). myc-BirAR118G was inserted as an N-terminal fusion with 737 nsp2 within ORF1a. The cleavage site between nsp1 and myc-BirAR118G was retained (black 738 arrow) while a deleted cleavage site between BirAR118G and nsp2 ensured the release of a 739 BirAR118G-nsp2 fusion protein from the pp1a polyprotein. The cleavage site between nsp2 and 740 nsp3 was also retained. (b) Viral replication kinetics of recombinant MHV-BirAR118G-nsp2 741 were compared to wild-type MHV-A59 and recombinant MHV-GFP-nsp2.
