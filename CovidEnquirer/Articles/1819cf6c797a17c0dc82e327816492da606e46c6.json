Congo and the cases of Crimea-Congo haemorrhagic fever in our country have again cast the spotlight on tropical diseases. Isolating suspected cases of highly contagious and lethal diseases must be a priority (haemorrhagic fever, MERS-CoV). Assessing the patient, taking a careful medical history based on epidemiological aspects of the area of origin, activities they have carried out, their length of stay in the area and the onset of symptoms, will eventually help us, if not to make a definitive diagnosis, at least to exclude diseases that pose a threat to these patients. Malaria should be ruled out because of its frequency, without forgetting other common causes of fever familiar to emergency doctors.",

According to a multicenter study of the GeoSentinel surveillance network, fever is the cardinal symptom for which up to 23% of patients visit a doctor after returning from a trip, and it is the second reason for consultation 2 after diarrhoea. Globally, malaria was the most frequent cause of fever (29%), followed by dengue fever (15%), with the incidence varying according to the region visited. Other specific causes of fever to be highlighted in this study are typhoid fever, Chikungunya, rickettsiosis, viral hepatitis and HIV primary infection, with no significant difference to previous studies. 3, 4 The initial evaluation of patient from the tropics with fever in A&E should place emphasis on recognising or ruling out 2387-0206/\u00a9 2019 Elsevier Espa\u00f1a, S.L.U. All rights reserved. diseases with high morbidity and mortality (malaria, typhoid fever, meningitis) and those that pose a public health danger 5 (viral haemorrhagic fevers, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [MERS-CoV], tuberculosis). The need for isolation should be evaluated as soon as possible so that health personnel may take appropriate protective measures and limit contact with other patients or relatives. It is therefore advisable that if the hospital triage detects a possible case that presents certain risks (haemorrhagic fevers and MERS-CoV), due to having taken into account the place from which the patient returns or originates, and the onset of fever within the considered incubation periods, then procedures should be followed to place the patient in isolation at that moment. Subsequent reassessment should be made ensuring the proper precautions of individual protection by the health personnel are followed, until the suspicion is confirmed or discarded. The possibility of haemorrhagic fever should be considered in patients with fever and haemorrhagic signs who have arrived within the last 21 days from a region where cases have been reported, or if they have had contact with patients, secretions or biological samples from infected patients. 6 MERS-CoV should be suspected in patients with fever and respiratory symptoms who have returned from countries in the Arabian Peninsula in the last 14 days or have been in close contact with patients from those regions under study. 7 Additionally, principal emphasis should be placed on the detection of signs of clinical severity. In the latest international consensus of definitions of sepsis and septic shock qSOFA criterion were defined 8 (2 or more of the following criterion: altered level of consciousness, respiratory rate \u2265 22 bpm and systolic blood pressure \u2264 100 mmHg). This scale can be used as a tool to identify patients with a risk of sepsis and, who consequently require a more intensive evaluation. This scale may be useful for the detection of seriously ill patients with fever coming from the tropics. 9 The evaluation should continue with the completion of a detailed clinical history, taking into account epidemiological aspects of the country and the region visited, the reason for travel (tourism, business, voluntary work, migration or visiting friends and relatives (VFR) and the activities carried out (Table 1) . Questions must be asked about the vaccines received before the trip and the use of antimalarial prophylaxis and the degree of compliance. 10 The use of such prophylaxis does not completely rule out the possibility of developing malaria, with one of the most common errors being early suspension of the treatment once the trip has ended. 11 It is also common that the VFR traveller is unaware of the need for antimalarial prophylaxis when they are travelling to their native country. 12 Probably the most important information to obtain during the clinical interview, are the precise dates of the trip, the onset of fever and the evolution of other symptoms, since this allows us to infer the incubation period of the disease, delimiting the spectrum of possibilities and thus aiding the differential diagnosis (Table 2) .",

            "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that in 2016 there were 216 million cases of malaria in the world and 445,000 deaths, with cases being notified in 91 countries. 14 In Spain in 2015, 583 cases were diagnosed. 15 Malaria is transmitted by the Anopheles mosquito, of wide global distribution, and it is produced by protozoa of the genus Plasmodium spp., which includes five species that cause the disease in humans. P. falciparum is the most aggressive species, producing more severe cases, and cerebral malaria. The clinical presentation occurs after an incubation period of between 7 and 30 days, with infection by P. falciparum being the shortest and P. malariae being the longest. Both P. vivax and P. ovale can present relapses years later, as they produce hypnozoites (schizonts that remain dormant in the hepatocytes and are not susceptible to drugs that eliminate the erythrocytic forms). P. falciparum and P. malariae may lead to recrudescences as parasites remain in the tissues, giving rise to new cycles of elevated parasitaemia. This usually occurs after untreated or poorly treated infections, presenting increasingly milder cases, especially in patients who live in endemic areas and have developed immunity against the infection. Usually the recrudescences occur quite soon after the initial infection, but they have been described up to 10 years later. 16 The clinical condition produced by uncomplicated malaria consists of high fever, accompanied by malaise and musculoskeletal pain. In the laboratory, thrombocytopenia (80-85%, i.e. the most frequent disorder), anaemia (30%) and leukopenia (20%) can be observed. LDH and bilirubin may be increased; and metabolic acidosis and hypoglycaemia may appear in severe forms. 17 According to WHO, it is considered as severe malaria if it meets at least one of the criteria listed in Table 4 . 18 The diagnosis will be made by thick film (high sensitivity) and thin film or smears (high specificity and identification of the species). 18 If there is a high suspicion of malaria but the thick film is negative, it should be repeated every 12 h for 3 days. 19 Another method, especially useful if no microbiologist is available to perform the thick smear evaluation, is the antigen detection test by immunochromatography. However, it is not recommended as a substitution to the thick blood film test, given the high number of false negatives for the other species except P. falciparum. 20 PCR techniques can also be performed, but given the time involved in the test and its cost, it is not practical in the A&E situation. 18 In general, hospital admission is recommended in any case of malaria, especially when it is produced by P. falciparum in nonimmune patients, even if they appear to be in a good overall state, as possible sudden deterioration can occur despite having started the correct treatment. 21 P. vivax, P. ovale and P. malariae tend to produce milder conditions and do not usually present complications. The treatment of malaria should be carried out according to the species and place of travel of the patient, as a way to consider the possible pharmacological resistance. Uncomplicated malaria can be treated orally with drugs if there is no digestive intolerance. Cases of complicated malaria should be treated in ICUs. IV artesunate has been shown to decrease parasitaemia and the length of stay both in the ICU and on the ward more rapidly, and therefore it has become the treatment of choice for the treatment of severe malaria, rather than quinine, 18 with little but growing drug-resistance described so far. 22 In Table 5 we review the treatment of malaria. In case of pregnancy, artesunate is contraindicated in the first trimester, so it should be treated with quinine + clindamycin. ",

When they do produce disease, this is manifested mainly by three clinical syndromes: fever-rash-arthralgia, haemorrhagic fever and encephalitis, with these symptoms sometimes overlapping each other. We explain the main ones.",

Its incidence has increased in the last decades, with WHO estimating an annual incidence of 50 million cases. 25 It is considered a global public health problem, with a mortality of 2.5%. The main vectors are principally Aedes aegypti, and to a lesser extent Aedes albopictus. They present an incubation period of 4-10 days after the mosquito bite. Dengue and severe dengue are distinguished with or without signs of alarm. 26 It initially presents with a high fever (40 \u2022 C) and nonspecific symptoms (severe headache, pain behind the eyes, myalgias, arthralgias, nausea, vomiting, swollen glands). Petechiae and minor haemorrhages may appear. The tourniquet test (Rumpel-Leede sign) can be helpful in the diagnosis. It consists of the application of pressure by a sphygmograph higher than the mean arterial pressure for 5 min, to assess the appearance of petechiae after its withdrawal (being positive if there is more than 20 petechiae in a 5 cm diameter area). This febrile phase lasts between 3 and 7 days, followed by the critical phase, which begins when the temperature begins to normalise, below 37.5 \u2022 C. In these 48-72 h, the patients who improve after the fever subsides are considered cases of dengue without warning signs. However, there may be warning signs in relation to increased capillary permeability (severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, oedema, mucosal haemorrhage, lethargy, hepatomegaly), with analytical disorders such as increased haematocrit (due to the extravasation of fluids due to a decrease in protein), together with a rapid fall of platelets. Severe dengue (5%) is diagnosed if there is a significant loss of plasma that leads to haemodynamic shock, pleural effusion, severe haemorrhage or severe organ damage (elevation of transaminases > 1000, neurological or cardiac disorders). In the recovery phase the general condition improves, the gastrointestinal symptoms improve, the haemodynamic state is stabilized and diuresis is increased. All the serotypes can produce a sever condition, although it has been observed that the maximum risk is DEN-2, followed by DEN-3, DEN-4 and DEN-1. 27 After a first infection, specific antibodies are formed against this serotype, with the risk of developing a more severe condition if re-infected by a different serotype.",

After confirming a case, the patient must be transferred to a High-Level Isolation Unit. 6 Because of its relevance, we highlight the current outbreak of Ebola in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the province of Nord-Kivu. 35 The outbreak of 2014-2016 in West Africa, which affected Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea, has been the most important in history, with 28,616 suspected cases, of which 11,310 persons died. 36 The recent detection of the Congo-Crimean haemorrhagic fever virus in \u00c1vila, Spain, has resulted from the reference to the death of the patient in \u00c1vila. 37 Two years after the first two autochthonous cases in Spain, 38 we remember that the criteria are fever >38 \u2022 C in the first 9 days after the bite of a tick, or 13 days after contact with blood or secretions of a patient (or a laboratory sample), plus the presence of at least one criterion of the following: profuse haemorrhagic manifestations, thrombocytopenia (<100,000 platelets/mm 3 ), prolonged prothrombin time. Leukopenia (<4000 leukocytes/mm 3 ) is also frequent, although it has been excluded as a criterion in the latest protocol. 39 The virus has been found circulating in Spain in ticks of cattle in the areas of C\u00e1ceres, Toledo, \u00c1vila and Madrid. 40 Yellow fever is widespread in Africa and South America. Fortunately, there is a vaccine, although there are still important outbreaks. After the mosquito bite, there is an incubation period of 3-6 days, after which sudden onset fever and musculoskeletal pain appear. This is followed by a period of apparent remission, and on the second day haemorrhagic fever symptoms appear, with the presence of jaundice, kidney failure and haemorrhagic diathesis (petechiae, gingivorrhagia, melenas, epistaxis), leading to death in 7-10 days in 30-60% of cases. 41 Lassa fever is caused by an arenavirus (not an arbovirus) which is transmitted when the patient comes into contact with the urine, blood, saliva or stool of a rodent (Mastomys natalensis) through faecal-oral or inhaled route, as well as being a virus that is transmissible from person to person. This disease usually occurs in the form of outbreaks, mainly in rural areas. Between 100,000 and 300,000 cases per year are reported in Africa, producing 5000 deaths. 42 Nigeria is an endemic area, with occasional outbreaks in neighbouring countries (Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea).",

Its reservoir is human, and the route of transmission is faecal-oral, through waters that are not well disinfected or the ingestion of contaminated food, with the sources of infection being the convalescent patient and chronic healthy carriers. It continues to be an important cause of fever in the traveller, with an estimated incidence of 27 million cases a year worldwide. 51 The amount of inoculum ingested (>10 6 bacteria) and the characteristics of the host are decisive in the development of the disease. Its incubation period is usually between 5 and 21 days, with lapses of up to 60 days having been observed. It presents in the form of fever, cough, headache, constipation or diarrhoea and abdominal pain. Its classic description is that during the first week there is a high fever; during the second week, abdominal pain, and maybe the appearance of maculopapular rose-coloured lesions in the abdomen and trunk (roseola); and from the third week onwards, possible hepatosplenomegaly and complications such as intestinal bleeding or perforation in relation to hyperplasia of the Peyer's patches. In is during this phase that the patient normally suffers septic shock. If there are no complications after the fourth week, the condition tends to improve progressively, leaving the patient in a chronic carrier state. Possible complications may appear in the form of endocarditis, osteomyelitis, arthritis and meningitis. The diagnosis is made by culture (50-70% of positive blood cultures in the first week).",

The clinical manifestations are generally nonspecific, namely fever, malaise, headache, myalgia and cutaneous rash.

It can also be accompanied by gastrointestinal disorders and diarrhoea. The incubation period is from 2 to 14 days. A person who travels from the Arabian Peninsula and neighbouring countries or who has been in contact with suspected or confirmed cases of MERS, and who presents the aforementioned respiratory symptoms raises suspicion of infection, although strictly the current protocol in our country requires pulmonary parenchymal involvement (pneumonia or distress). 57 In case of suspicion, strict respiratory isolation measures should be taken, and the health personnel should wear PPE and an FFP2 mask.

While a person is swimming or bathing, the cercariae penetrate the human skin and can pass into the blood stream. In some cases, a localised dermatitis (swimmer's itch) is produced. 59 In the blood, they mature and move to the blood vessels (the mesenteric venules and the venous plexus of bladder, respectively), where the adult worms lay eggs. These eggs can be excreted in the faeces or in urine, infesting the waters where the miracidia are released that infect the snails, closing the cycle. Additionally, the eggs provoke an immune reaction in the organism that produces the clinical symptoms of the acute infection. Katayama syndrome or fever at 3-8 weeks is typical but not frequent. It presents as a fever, with respiratory symptoms such as cough, and urticaria, and frequently a skin rash and eosinophilia in 50% of cases. There are 5 species of schistosomes: Schistosoma mansoni (more frequent in Africa, the Middle East, the Caribbean, Brazil and Venezuela), S. japonicum (China, Philippines and Indonesia), S. mekongi (Laos and Cambodia) S. intercalatum (Central African jungle areas) which all produce intestinal disease, and Schistosoma haematobium, frequent in Africa and the Middle East, which produces genitourinary disease. The diagnosis is based mainly on the detection of eggs in urine or faeces, although serology with detection of antibodies in blood or urine can be used. The treatment is praziquantel, in a single dose, although it is advisable to repeat the dose 2-4 weeks later.",
