            "text": "Background: Vincristine (VCR), which is a widely used antineoplastic drug, was integrated with a submicron-emulsion drug-delivery system to enhance the anticancer effect. Methods: After the formation of a VCR-oleic acid ion-pair complex (VCR-OA), the VCR-OAloaded submicron emulsion (VCR-OA-SME), prepared by classical high-pressure homogenization, was characterized and its in vitro anticancer effects were evaluated. Results: The submicron-emulsion formulation exhibited a homogeneous round shape. The mean particle size, zeta potential, and encapsulation efficiency were 157.6 \u00b1 12.6 nm, \u221226.5 \u00b1 5.0 mV and 78.64% \u00b1 3.44%, respectively. An in vitro release study of the VCR-OA-SME revealed that 12.4% of the VCR was released within the first 2 hours (initial burst-release phase) and the rest of the drug was detected in the subsequent sustained-release phase. Compared with VCR solution, the pharmacokinetic study of VCR-OA-SME showed relatively longer mean residence time (mean residence time [0-\u221e] increased from 187.19 to 227.56 minutes), higher maximum concentration (from 252.13 ng/mL to 533.34 ng/mL), and greater area under the curve (area under the curve [0-\u221e] from 11,417.77 \u00b5g/L/minute to 17,164.34 \u00b5g/L/minute. Moreover, the VCR-OA-SME exhibited higher cytotoxicity (P , 0.05) on tumor cells by inducing cell arrest in the G 2 /M phase or even apoptosis (P , 0.05). Conclusion: The VCR-OA-SME formulation in our study displayed great potential for an anticancer effect for VCR.",

            "text": "Vincristine (VCR, Figure 1A) , isolated from the leaves of the periwinkle plant Catharanthus roseus, 1 is a widely used antineoplastic drug in the clinic, especially for pediatric and adult malignancies. 2 It is a cell cycle-specific anticancer drug that mainly interferes with mitotic spindle microtubules [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] and induces tumor cell apoptosis. [7] [8] [9] In the past few decades, optimizing the formulation and then improving its anticancer effect has attracted much attention. The investigated formulation includes microemulsions, 10 common nanoparticles, 11 conventional liposomes, 12 sterical liposomes, 13 and targeted nanoparticles. 14 The clinical applications of the above carriers are largely limited by their complex components and/or complicated production process. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a VCR vehicle with higher anticancer effects. Emulsion is a commonly acceptable formulation that has been used in clinics for years, and microemulsion [15] [16] [17] and submicron emulsion 18, 19 have been studied extensively. These vehicles can be administered via parenteral, 10, 20 transdermal, 19 and ocular 21 routes. Wang et al prepared a micron emulsion to carry VCR, 10 which was stable and exhibited greater antitumor effect. However, this formulation contained a special component poly(ethylene glycol)distearoyl phosphatidylethanolamine that largely increased the cost of preparation and caused some side effects after repeated administrations, such as accelerated blood clearance. [22] [23] [24] [25] What's more, the possible mechanism of the improved anticancer effect was still unclear at the cellular level.",

VCR is a vinca alkaloid in which there are two ionizable tertiary nitrogen atoms ( Figure 1B , pKa 1 = 11.10 \u00b1 0.60, pKa 2 = 7.90 \u00b1 0.60). After protonation, positively charged VCR can attach to a negatively charged carboxyl group of fatty acid, resulting in a VCR ion-pair complex. Since VCR is generally used for parenteral administration, choosing an injection-acceptable ion-pairing agent with low toxicity is very important. OA (pKa = 4.78 \u00b1 0.10) is a kind of biodegradable long-chain fatty acid with high biocompatibility. Most importantly, OA is available for clinical parenteral usage. 35 In this study, a negatively charged carboxyl group of OA ( Figure 1C ) attached with the protonized tertiary nitrogen of VCR to form an ion-pair complex, and its long carbon chain could offer the VCR more hydrophobicity.",

During the preparation of VCR-OA, excess amounts of NaHCO 3 and OA were added to VCR solution (molar ratio of VCR:NaHCO 3 :OA was 1:8:5). To avoid the effect of salt on drug dissolution in the lipid phase, the VCR sulfate was neutralized by NaHCO 3 , and then extracted by dichloromethane. The obtained VCR-OA was a light-yellow semisolid substance.",

The average size and polydispersity index were 157.6 \u00b1 12.6 nm and 0.204 \u00b1 0.02, respectively. This size was smaller than conventional emulsion, probably due to the presence of adequate surfactants, which were composed of 2% Solutol HS15 and 2% soybean lecithin. Meanwhile, the OA can also act as a coemulsifier. The zeta potential of VCR-OA-SME was \u221226.5 \u00b1 5.0 mV. These high values were helpful for the system's stability, due to the electrostatic repelling force among the particles. 37 The anionic components in soybean lecithin, such as phosphatidylserine and phosphatidic acid, were mainly responsible for the negative charge on the surface of the emulsion drops. 20 Moreover, the negatively charged OA may serve as a contributor for the zeta potential. Transmission electron microscopy imaging of VCR-OA-SME ( Figure 2B ) showed that the micron emulsion drops were spherical and uniform in size, ranging from 100 to 300 nm, which was consistent with DLS assay. The average encapsulation efficiency and drug loading of VCR-OA-SME were measured as 78.64% \u00b1 3.44% and 0.48% \u00b1 0.02% (n = 3), respectively.",

Since VCR is a cell cycle-specific anticancer drug 3-7 whose curative effect is time-dependent, longer mean retention time with appropriate drug concentration may have better anticancer effect. 43 The slower release of VCR from VCR-OA-SME may be one of the main reasons for its slower clearance. In addition, the area under the curve value of VCR-OA-SME is higher than that of VCR solution (Table 1 ), indicating that VCR-OA-SME has a higher absolute bioavailability.

Furthermore, when VCR concentration was 10 or 20 ng/mL, the cell population in the sub-G 1 phase in the VCR-OA-SME group was more than that in the VCR solution group (P , 0.001). Since the sub-G 1 phase is a characteristic hypodiploid DNA content peak indicating apoptotic and necrotic cells, 47 more cells in the sub-G 1 phase in the VCR-OA-SME group mean that VCR-OA-SME could induce more cells to undergo apoptosis. 48, 49 Although MCF-7 exhibited more cells in the G 2 /M phase for the VCR solution group compared with VCR-OA-SME group at 20 ng/mL, more cells were arrested in the sub-G 1 phase for the VCR-OA-SME group than in other groups (P , 0.001), which indicated that more cell apoptosis was induced after cell-cycle arrest by VCR-OA-SME. 30, 50 Cell-apoptosis assay Many previous studies have shown that vinca alkaloids can induce cell apoptosis.

Cells were stained with annexin-V/PI and the percentages of viable (annexin V \u2212 /PI \u2212 ), early apoptotic (annexin V + /PI \u2212 ), late apoptotic or secondary necrotic (annexin V + /PI + ), and necrotic (annexin V \u2212 /PI + ) cells were measured by CellQuest (Becton Dickinson) software ( Figure 7C ).

            "text": "To investigate the causes of increased antineoplastic effect of VCR-OA-SME, an in vitro cellular uptake assay was conducted on MCF-7 cells. As shown in Figure 8A , more VCR was taken up by cells in the form of VCR-OA-SME at 10 \u00b5g/mL (P , 0.01) and 20 \u00b5g/mL (P , 0.05) when compared with VCR solution. It was also found that the cell uptake of VCR solution and VCR-OA-SME were concentration-dependent. As presented in Figure 8B , the cell uptake of VCR-OA-SME was significantly restrained at 4\u00b0C and in the presence of sodium azide, which is a mitochondrial adenosine triphosphatase inhibitor and can inhibit energy metabolism, 52, 53 indicating that the cell uptake of VCR-OA-SME was both temperature-and energy-dependent. However, the VCR solution uptake by cells incubated at 4\u00b0C became undetectable (UI = 0), whereas the presence of sodium azide existed, indicating that the uptake of VCR solution was mainly temperature-dependent. The additional cell-uptake pathway of VCR-OA-SME (the energy-dependent cell uptake) may be also one of the reasons for its higher uptake efficiency and cytotoxicity. According to the previous studies on nanomedicine 54 and the characteristics of VCR-OA-SME (such as size and material composition), endocytosis could be the most likely pathway of VCR-OA-SME taken up by cells in the study.",

Furthermore, compared with free VCR, VCR-OA-SME could lead to more cell uptake, arrest more cells in the G 2 /M phase, and induce more apoptosis, and thus showed a higher antineoplastic effect.",
