Transfusion of whole blood can be lifesaving in situations such as massive blood loss due to trauma, burns, or extensive surgery. Blood component therapy is used to treat conditions in which the specific element is missing; for example, packed red cell administration in the case of severe anemia (a reduction in oxygen supply to vital organs) or platelet concentrates transfused for an abnormal decrease in the number of platelets. People suffering from sickle-cell disease may require frequent transfusion of red cell concentrates. In the case of hemophilia, the administration of the missing clotting factor (Factor VIII or IX concentrate or alternative recombinants) is required.

These agents in their early stage of infection may induce a healthy carrier state with few or no symptoms of disease. It is important to note that even if this list is under continuous development and scrutiny, not all agents are being tested for each donation. As of today, mandatory testing of blood donations concerns HIV-1, -2; hepatitis B and C viruses; and syphilis, to which locally significant testing requirements are added. By locally significant, in context, one should understand the local epidemiology (incidence and prevalence of specific infections in the populations) and links with its seasonal variations when applicable. Considering the limitations of testing procedures (infections are not identified during their initial phasewindow period, new infectious agents for which tests have not been developed, quality of tests, and testing algorithm in place), the appropriate selection of potential blood donors should be given its full importance in maintaining safe blood supplies.",

In evaluating the indication for blood transfusion therapy, the benefits for the patient should outweigh the risks. Several international recommendations and guidelines have been developed in this respect, but these are not always available or used, and in many circumstances the process continues to rest on historically based practices and the clinical experience of the attending physicians. Several studies have shown important differences in usage of blood transfusion therapy within and between countries, for similar clinical pathologies.",

Strengthening the collaboration and coordination with different levels of health care may help reduce blood usage through (1) prevention and education to health; (2) early diagnosis and treatment of diseases or conditions which may lead to the need for blood transfusion (obstetric antenatal care, iron substitution, etc.); (3) use of evidence-based latest therapeutic guidelines and microinvasive/bloodless surgical technologies;",

The three pillars of PBM focus on optimization of red cell mass, reduction of blood loss/bleeding and optimization of the physiological reserve of anemia (see Isbister, 2013) . Explaining the benefits and risks of transfusion therapies to patients and families is an important element in creating the necessary understanding of this apparently simple procedure. An informed patient will be knowledgeable of the residual risks related to the transfusion if given (no zero risk), as well as be involved in the informed choice of alternatives. The expert patient will be equally able to observe if safety steps such as appropriate identification, skin disinfection, etc., are followed and contribute to reducing the potential occurrence of transfusion-related hazards.",

The safe blood donors are the cornerstone of a safe blood supply and therefore an important and central point in WHO recommendations as well as other international organizations concerned.Establishing a pool of safe blood donors requires long-term commitments to education, information, and social involvement. Efforts in this respect have been particularly enhanced with the World Blood DonorDay, launched in 2004, and endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 2005 as global annual event. Cosponsored by WHO, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRCRCS), International Federation of Blood Donor Organizations (IFBDO/ FIODS), and International Society of Blood Transfusion (ISBT), it aims to increase awareness toward blood donation and enhance the different steps in the process of education, recruitment, and retention of low-risk donors and establishment of youth donor programs. The theme of World Blood Donor Day 2014 was dedicated to safe motherhood.",
