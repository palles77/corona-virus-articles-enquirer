Methods: Ten nurses participated; physiologic effects, subjective symptoms, and compliance with wearing an N95 alone or with a surgical mask overlay were assessed. Longitudinal analysis based on multivariate linear regression models assessed changes in outcome variables (CO 2 , O 2 , heart rate, perceived comfort items, compliance measures, and others). Analyses compared changes over time, and compared wearing only an N95 to wearing an N95 with a surgical mask overlay. Results: Most nurses (90%, n \u00bc 9) tolerated wearing respiratory protection for two 12-hour shifts. CO 2 levels increased significantly compared with baseline measures, especially when comparing an N95 with a surgical mask to only an N95, but changes were not clinically relevant. Perceived exertion; perceived shortness of air; and complaints of headache, lightheadedness, and difficulty communicating also increased over time. Almost one-quarter (22%) of respirator removals were due to reported discomfort. N95 adjustments increased over time, but other compliance measures did not vary by time. Compliance increased on day 2, except for adjustments, touching under the N95, and eye touches. Conclusion: Long-term use of respiratory protection did not result in any clinically relevant physiologic burden for health care personnel, although many subjective symptoms were reported. N95 compliance was fairly high.",

            "text": "Pandemics, outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, and bioterrorism attacks may necessitate long-term filtering face piece respirator (N95) use for health care personnel. 1 However, researchers and experiences during the 2009 influenza A pandemic indicate that N95 supplies may be insufficient during a future event. 1, 2, 3 In response to this potential problem, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 4 and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration 5 issued guidance regarding extending the use or reuse of N95s during a future influenza pandemic. In addition, the Institute of Medicine issued a report that proposed a strategy for prolonging the useful life of N95s through the use of a surgical mask overlay that is intended to provide barrier protection for the N95. 6 Research examining potential physiologic impacts of long-term N95 use has been limited. Most has been laboratory based, 7, 8 meaning that work conditions were approximated by walking on a treadmill and/or involved young, healthy subjects. 9,10 Only 1 study has examined long-term N95 use among health care personnel in an actual work setting, 11 and that study only assessed perceived intolerance. In addition to physiologic factors, researchers indicate that subjective symptoms/conditions, such as perceived comfort, headaches, or difficulty communicating with patients, may affect health care personnel's tolerance of long-term N95 use. In retrospective studies, researchers reported that long-term use of N95s during the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak was associated with an increased frequency of headaches 12 and physical discomfort. 13 In addition to examining tolerance, it is important to assess staff compliance. Noncompliance with N95 use can put staff at risk from infection, a factor believed to be associated with the high rate of severe acute respiratory syndrome among health care personnel. 14 A study using self-reported compliance found that less than half of all health care personnel reported being compliant when using an N95, and that study only examined the practice of touching the N95 when measuring compliance. 15 Other noncompliant behaviors, such as adjusting the N95 during use or touching under the N95, were not assessed. In addition, researchers indicate that N95 compliance may decrease over time; the longer N95s are worn, the less compliant staff become. 16 A prospective study examining tolerance and observed compliance with long-term N95 use among health care personnel providing routine patient care in an actual work environment has never been conducted.",

Of the nurses who participated in the entire study, each used an average of 3 N95s for each 12-hour shift. Nurses wore the N95 alone or with a mask for 214 and 199 minutes on average, respectively, before the first removal for any reason (Table 1) ; this time difference was not significant. Daily average times wearing the N95 alone or with a surgical mask during each episode were 223.7 and 159.1, respectively (Table 1) ; this time difference was not significant. Each time a nurse removed his/her N95, the reason for removal was documented. In total, nurses removed their respirator 68 times during the study, either to eat or drink, because it was the end of his/her shift, or because the N95 was uncomfortable in some way. About half of the removals (55.9%, n \u00bc 38) were reported to be because the nurse wanted to eat or get a drink. About one-quarter of the removals (22.1%, n \u00bc 15) were because the shift ended, and the remaining one-quarter (22.1%, n \u00bc 15) were due to reported discomfort. Qualitative statements made by nurses as reasons for removal included comments such as, \"It is getting hard to breathe,\" \"[the N95] is uncomfortable,\" and \"I can't breathe.\" Five types of N95 noncompliance were assessed: (1) N95 adjustments, (2) N95 touches, (3) face touches, (4) under-the-N95 touches, and (5) eye touches. On average, each nurse was noncompliant with their respirator 25.7 times per shift. The most frequent types of noncompliance included touching the N95 and adjusting the N95 or N95/mask combination. There was no relationship between the amount of time an N95 or N95/mask combination was worn and compliance with wearing the N95 on 4 of the 5 compliance measures: face, eye, or N95 touches or touches under the N95 (Table 2) . Nurses wearing an N95 alone were less likely to adjust it toward the end of their shift compared with earlier in the shift; in contrast, when nurses were wearing the N95/mask combination, the number of N95 adjustments did not vary by time (Table 2 ). Compliance increased on day 2 in relation to the number of times a nurse touched the N95, regardless if he/she was wearing only an N95 or a N95/mask combination ( Table 2) .",

However, although there were statistically significant negative physiologic changes over time associated with wearing respiratory protection (especially among those wearing an N95 with a mask overlay), these changes were not clinically relevant.

In this study, only 1 nurse had high intolerance to wearing an N95 (as evidence by withdrawing from the study because of discomfort after only half an hour). The reasons for the longer tolerance despite increasing complaints of discomfort seen in this study are not known. It is possible that the timing of the 2 studies played a role in the subjects' tolerance for wearing N95s. This study occurred after the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, an event that necessitated prolonged use of N95s for many health care personnel until the H1N1 vaccine was released, and one that involved a shortage of N95s among many health care agencies. 3 Study participants' recent experiences during the 2009 pandemic may have provided increased motivation to tolerate long-term use of N95s.",

In addition, some MICU nurses who worked at the hospital from which subjects were recruited refused to participate because of an unwillingness to wear an N95 for 2 entire shifts. It is likely that volunteer subjects tolerate wearing N95s better than those who refused to even be screened for the study. This has implications for future disasters during which health care personnel may be required to wear N95s for long periods of time. More frequent work breaks may need to be incorporated into work shifts when long-term N95 use is required. Future studies should also examine other factors that may help increase health care personnel tolerance of long-term N95 usage.",

            "text": "A unique finding from this study is the relationship between weight and N95 tolerance and compliance. Nurses with higher BMIs were less compliant when wearing an N95, in terms of being more likely to touch their respirator, than those with lower BMIs. This more frequent touching of the respirator may have been related to perceived discomfort because nurses with higher BMIs reported many more subjective symptoms (such as more perceived shortness of breath, discomfort, thermal discomfort, and headaches) related to wearing respiratory protection than nurses with lower BMIs. These findings have not been identified in previous research on N95 tolerance 8, 11 and have potential significant implications for future disaster response. In the US general population, 33% of people are overweight (but not obese), and another 36% are obese 17 ; data specific to nurses could not be found, but there is no reason to believe that a lower rate of obesity among health care personnel would exist compared with the United States as a whole. With such a high rate of overweight and/or obese health care personnel, and an associated lower tolerance for long-term N95 usage among these individuals, it may be difficult to safely implement extended use or reuse policies for N95s without building in additional break times for staff. Additional studies are needed to further examine the relationship between weight and N95 tolerance and compliance. The nurses in this study were fairly compliant with wearing respiratory protection, meaning that they wore it correctly and did not frequently engage in behaviors that might lead to potential auto-inoculation, even over long periods of time. Contrary to the authors' hypothesis, nurses did not become less compliant over the course of a shift and actually became more compliant the second day of wear than the first in terms of the number of times they adjusted their N95 or touched their face or the respirator. The reasons for this are unknown but may be because the nurses became accustomed to wearing the N95 over the course of the study. This finding is different from a previously published study that found that N95 compliance decreases over time. 16 This may be because the Seale et al study 16 occurred over 4 weeks versus only 2 shifts observed in this study or because this sample consisted of only intensive care nurses. Researchers have indicated that intensive care unit staff are often more compliant with N95s than health care personnel in other areas/units. 15 One somewhat troubling finding from this study is that the most frequently performed noncompliant behaviors involved 2 practices that may put health care personnel at risk of exposure to infectious particles when wearing N95s: touching the N95 and/or adjusting it during use. Better or more frequent education of health care personnel may be needed to reduce these potentially harmful behaviors and protect workers from exposure because knowledge has been found to be associated with better adherence to proper respirator practice. 15 Nurses in this study were asked to follow their hospital's extended use/reuse of N95 policy, which included instructions to replace their N95 whenever they believed the integrity was compromised, the N95 became soiled, or when they believed the N95 to be difficult through which to breathe. Sometimes the nurse participants reused an N95 (ie, redonned it after removal), and other times they chose to don a new N95. Each nurse used an average of 3 N95s per shift during the study, regardless of how often he/she chose to don and doff respiratory protection. This finding provides a general guideline for hospitals to use when estimating the number of N95s needed per staff member during a disaster if an extended-use/reuse policy is implemented by the agency and is different from previously published recommendations regarding how to estimate the number of N95s that may be needed during a disaster. 2 This is the first study to examine long-term use of respiratory protection in a health care setting in terms of compliance, tolerance, and physiologic effects of use. It is also the first study in a health care setting to compare the physiologic impact of wearing an N95 alone to the N95 with mask overlay combination recommended by the Institute of Medicine to be used during times of limited resources. This study also has a robust methodology because of the nature of the randomization of subjects and the repeated measures design. One potential limitation of this study is that volunteer subjects may tolerate N95s better than those who refused to be screened for the study, reducing the generalizability of the findings to all health care personnel. Another potential limitation is the use of transcutaneous measurement of CO 2 versus the more accurate method of arterial measurement; however, transcutaneous CO 2 measurement has been shown to have adequate accuracy, 18, 19 and it has been used in all previous studies examining the physiologic impact of N95 use because of the avoidance of potential complications related to arterial punctures. 1, 7 Last, because only intensive care unit nurses were recruited, the findings may not be generalizable to workers in other areas of the hospital or to non-nurse health care personnel.",
