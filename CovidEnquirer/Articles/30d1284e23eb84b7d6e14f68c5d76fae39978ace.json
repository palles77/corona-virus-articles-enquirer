This was probably due, at least in part, to the season (the summer months) when the animals were commingled. In the six-month period August-February, 38% of the animals were treated one or more times for BRD and mortality was 0.7%. Hereford and Aberdeen Angus calves had significantly higher treatment rates than Charolais, Simmental and Blonde d'Aquitaine. Serological testing on samples obtained in August, November and January indicated that bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV-3) infections occurred each year before November after entry. Bovine coronavirus (BCoV) infections also occurred every year, but in 3/6 years this was not until after November. Bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) infections occurred only every second year and were associated with a treatment peak and one death on one occasion (December). The herd remained BVDV free during the entire study period.",

By preventing BRD soon after commingling the prerequisites for protective vaccination at entry might be improved. Applied management routines are discussed.",

Reducing disease incidence and invoking milder clinical signs would not only afford animal welfare benefits, but also ultimately reduce the use of antibiotics and minimize the risk of developing resistant microbes (Guillemot, 1999) . One major disease complex that impairs animal welfare and requires extensive use of antibiotics, for treatment, metaphylaxis and prophylaxis, is bovine respiratory disease (BRD). Viruses such as bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV), bovine herpes virus 1 (BHV-1), bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV-3) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) are involved in this complex (Kapil and Basaraba, 1997) , and often occur in combination with bacteria and mycoplasma (Babiuk et al., 1988) . The outcome of each individual case is affected by the animal's previous exposure to the pathogens, by management factors influencing immune responses and infection dose (e.g. colostrum intake, stress, nutritional status, hygiene, ventilation and stock density) and by the treatment. Transient and persistent co-infections with bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) frequently exacerbate the clinical signs (Potgieter, 1995) .",

Most of the national dairy and beef herds (98.5% and 97.2%, respectively) were declared free of BVDV infection in Sweden in August 2005 (data obtained from the Swedish Dairy Association); however, fattening units in which calves are assembled from many sources are still sometimes affected by BVDV. Although never highly prevalent, BHV-1 was cleared from Scandinavia during the 1990s and only Denmark has had recurrent outbreaks since 1995 (data obtained from Office International des Epizooties, handistatus II). This provides additional advantages for calf rearing compared to countries where BHV-1 is endemic. Nevertheless, BRSV, BCoV and PIV-3 are prevalent and widespread in Sweden (H\u00e4gglund et al., 2005) , and both BRSV and BCoV cause annual epidemics both in calves and adult cattle (Alenius et al., 1991; Tr\u00e5v\u00e9n et al., 1993; Elvander, 1996) .",

The animals were all tested for antibodies to BVDV and for BVDV isolation and were found to be negative. They passed a clinical examination by a local veterinarian and the original animal group was kept isolated from other cattle during the three weeks prior to admission. The calves were weaned at a minimum of three weeks before departure. Pure bred Charolais, Simmental, Hereford, Aberdeen Angus, Limousin and Blonde d'Aquitaine were represented. A few Highland Cattle were also present during 2002/2003 and 2003/2004. On arrival at the station, the animals were commingled in two pens generously bedded with straw, in a barn with three walls. They were fed a mixture of silage and grain, ad libitum. Three weeks later, the same area was split into 10 different pens. Each pen contained 10-20 animals of the same breed and approximate age. The stocking density was 4-6 m 2 per animal. The same animal carers observed all animals at least twice daily during the six years of the study and weighed them once every second week from October until sale or slaughter the following spring. Since each calf was considered to have a high breeding value, the carers were particularly observant for any changes in the individual health status of the calves (such as demeanour or coughing) and any treatment required was most probably initiated at an early stage.",

Five days of intramuscularly (IM) administrated procaine benzylpenicillin (20 mg/kg, Penovet vet., Boehringer Ingelheim Vetmedica) and a single IM dose of corticosteroids were used when calves showed lethargy in addition to clinical signs of respiratory disease or fever (>39.5\u00b0C) from undiagnosed disease (both referred to as BRD). When more than 20% of the herd was affected with such signs, the rectal temperature of all individuals was taken, and calves with temperatures > 39.5\u00b0C were treated. Treatment was repeated for poorly responding cases and the antibiotic changed to danofloxacin 1.25 mg/kg IM for three days (Advocin Vet., Orion), where there was a poor response to the second penicillin treatment. Other diagnoses that required antibiotic treatment (procaine benzylpenicillin), but that are not further considered here, included wound infections and claw inflammation (5 and 60 treatments per 970 animals, respectively).

Consistent with these reports, 77% of calves showed BRD within 21 days of arrival at one US feedlot (Hasoksuz et al., 2002) and 25% of 6-9-monthold calves were treated for BRD within 70 days after arrival at a bull testing station in Canada (Durham et al., 1991) . BRD treatment rates were on average 20% in 30 Swedish fattening herds during 5-12 weeks of study in continuous systems including animals of 19-216 days of age (Bengtsson and Viring, 2000) .

An exposure to persistently BVDV infected animals was shown to increase treatment rates against BRD by 43% in feedlots (Loneragan et al., 2005) , implying that the prevention of this infection is significant in economic terms. All calves in the study arrived directly from their herd of birth and were thus never exposed to infections at auctions, markets or calf buyers. It is likely that the season during which calves were commingled affected the prevention of BRSV and BCoV introduction, as well as on other pathogens. The prevalence of most respiratory viral infections is highest during winter (Stott et al., 1980) , which is possibly due to stress and overcrowding of individuals in winter housing and increased survival of the virus in the environment (Clark, 1993) . In addition to commingling during summertime, the risk of persistent pathogens in the environment between calf groups was reduced because the facilities did not contain animals during the five months before entry.",

This probably increased the treatment rates. However, the overall treatment rate for the whole period (August to February) did not differ from that reported earlier in feedlots (Smith, 1998) . The total mortality of 0.7% during six months, in contrast, was lower (Kelly and Janzen, 1986; Smith, 1998) . Estimations on feedlot rearing have suggested an average mortality of 2.7 per 1000 animals per month (1.3 of which due to respiratory disease) (Smith, 1998) and mortality rates of 0-15% (mostly 1-5%) during the first weeks after entry (Kelly and Janzen, 1986) . Besides environmental and nutritional factors, the lower mortality herein might partly have been due to reduced synergism between pathogens, such as BVDV or BHV-1 (Potgieter, 1995) . Kelly and Janzen (1986) reported treatment rates up to 69% of animals in individual batches and this was also seen during the month of the BRSV outbreak in our study. One option to reduce the impact of such outbreaks would be to use an effective vaccine with durable protection (Howard et al., 1987) . The vaccination regime could either be initiated on arrival, or the initial dose given on the farm of origin with the second dose given on arrival. However both the cost of such a strategy and the possible interference of maternally derived antibodies on the protection induced by BRSV vaccines need to be considered (H\u00e4gglund et al., 2004) . No BRD vaccines were used in this study because until 2004, no such vaccines were licensed for use in Sweden.",

            "text": "In contrast to BRSV infections, PIV-3 and BCoV infections were detected each year in the study, and PIV-3 infections were consistently detected in the early autumn. Since the diagnostic approach did not support detection of reinfections, this might merely reflect a higher incidence of PIV-3 in Sweden (H\u00e4gglund et al., 2005) , which is additionally supported by the higher prevalence of PIV-3 antibody positive animals on arrival at the station. It may also indicate that PIV-3 exhibits a higher transmission rate than the other viruses or is circulating widely during the summer. Interestingly, an earlier onset of PIV-3, compared to BRSV has been observed in British beef-rearing units (Stott et al., 1980) . Both BRSV and BCoV were occasionally detected after commingling in this work. Moreover, birth dates of some calves that were infected before arrival (i.e. those that remained seropositive in years when no animals seroconverted) imply that these infections occur also during the summer months (April-August, n = 4, data not shown). These data are in agreement with earlier findings (Verhoeff and van Nieuwstadt, 1984; H\u00e4gglund et al., 2005) , which suggest that BRSV, PIV-3 and BCoV circulate all year around, although maybe at a lower level during the summer. It is likely that environmental factors influence the severity of disease during infections (e.g. by lower infection dose during the summer due to low virus survival rate in the environment); infections in summer would thus not be diagnosed as often as in winter. Accordingly, the only clinically observed outbreak of BRSV, with a sharp treatment peak and one death, occurred in December 1999. A neighbouring farm had a BRSV outbreak within the same time period, as confirmed by serology, suggesting that the virus was introduced from outside the herd, possibly by wind, humans or by vectors. During one year when BRSV was absent (1998/1999) , seronegativity to PIV-3 and BCoV on arrival was significantly correlated to BRD treatment, supporting earlier data that these viruses also are of clinical importance (Stott et al., 1980; Storz et al., 2000) .",

By reducing the infection pressure on individuals from BVDV and BHV-1, and often also BRSV, morbidity due to other BRD pathogens was limited during this period. Disease later in this rearing system may be prevented by increasing herd biosecurity after entry or by using effective vaccines at entry. BVDV infections were avoided by virus/antibody detection and quarantine measures.",
