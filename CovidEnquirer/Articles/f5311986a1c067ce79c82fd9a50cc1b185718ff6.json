All 7 cases of HeV infection among humans in Australia occurred in Queensland. Five of these cases involved equine veterinary personnel who conducted routine necropsies or endoscopies; 3 of the 5 cases were fatal (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . In Australia, equine clinical services are mostly delivered by veterinarians working in private practice. The 3 deaths prompted government and veterinary professional agencies to promote the overhaul of infection-control measures in veterinary practice (3, 4) and increase auditing of veterinary infection-control strategies in private equine practice by Workplace Health and Safety Queensland (7) . In 2011, HeV outbreaks multiplied throughout Queensland and New South Wales, and samples from a dog were positive for HeV (8, 9) .",

Ten (47.6%) of the study participants were principal veterinarians (Table 1 ) who carried the highest degree of legal responsibility within their veterinary practice; they were quite concerned about their HeVrelated legal liability. Four of these principal veterinarians reported ceasing equine practice because of the diffi culty in enforcing infection control-related workplace health and safety compliance among their staff, because the logistical outlay of bringing change to their practice was too costly, or both. One participant declared, \"The HeV situation was the last straw that made us stop equine practice\u2026. We put it in the too hard basket.\" Their fear of prosecution became too big a threat for their business. However, ceasing this high-risk activity does not result in improved infectioncontrol standards.",

In some instances, staff and principal veterinarians resorted to working in suboptimal personal safety conditions to fulfi ll their legal and ethical responsibility to their patients and clients, thus jeopardizing the legal situation. As one participant pointed out, \"Veterinarians usually end up with less authority\u2026 taking the risk out of concern for the welfare of the horse.\" Veterinarians have a legal right to refuse service if safety is compromised; however, this would mean forfeiting immediate and future income through the loss of a client(s) and, possibly, reputation. In such instances, the staff and the business remain safe, but the principal veterinarian may not, and the overall standards of infection control within the practice do not improve. Up to 6 (60%) of the interviewed principal veterinarians had embraced the need for improvement of infection-control practices and had made major changes to their protocols and premises, but they felt that the best level of compliance would not be legally protective because of the unpredictable character of the veterinary work environment. Another participant expressed concern over this legal uncertainty: \"You still have to worry about what might occur out of the blue\u2026. With workplace health and safety we are very aware that complying is often not enough if an incident occurs.\" In this scenario, although safety improvement is achieved, the legal risk remains.",

Vets will need to refer animals.\" The lack of equine specialists would increase demands on the remaining equine veterinarians, who would have to further extend their already overstretched time and resources: they would work longer hours, travel farther to provide services, and be unable to reach sick horses in remote locations or to have them tested in a timely fashion. Participants still in equine practice considered that all these factors made working with horses less safe. Indeed, several studies showed that across a wide range of sectors, working >60 hours/week increased the risks for occupational injury and illness (12) (13) (14) . Furthermore, several study participants reported that some colleagues now choose to only provide services to healthy animals and refuse to treat sick horses. A participant described this as choosing the \"easy safe money\" over the \"hard dangerous money.\" This choice was creating resentment among members of an otherwise tight-knit veterinary community. Over time, resentment could jeopardize professional networking, which seems to play an essential role in disseminating clinical and safety information among veterinarians.",

If this trend is sustained, more private veterinarians may cease equine practice. Other participants no longer regarded themselves as equine practitioners and declared that they had ceased equine practice; however, they later admitted to still regularly treating horses. Their \"offi cial\" departure from equine practice would increase their safety and legal risks because they might miss program updates on equine health information or infectioncontrol improvement. It is also possible that the perception of increased risk may adversely infl uence the decision by younger veterinarians to pursue work in equine practice, thereby jeopardizing the normal replacement of the existing pool of aging equine practitioners. One parallel was the effect of severe acute respiratory syndrome. Overall, 35% of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related deaths were in health care workers. Some workers refused to go to work and others adopted a heroic stance and continued to work, resulting in substantial medium-term psychological effects on the healthcare professionals (15) .",
