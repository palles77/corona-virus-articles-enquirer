Eventually, 143 individuals, including 50 health care workers, 17 medical students, 30 patients, 42 visitors, and the index patient's own 4 relatives, acquired the infection through direct contact with this 26-year-old man. 3 After the visit to ward 8A, I became sick over the weekend with flu-like symptoms, such as diarrhea, malaise, and myalgia, which developed gradually. Three doses of intravenous augmentin (1.2 g per 8 hours) were given to me on Monday, March 10, which brought no benefit. With some doubts in mind, I went to obtain a chest x-ray film for myself on Tuesday. In view of the radiologic evidence of \"pneumonia\" (Figure 1, A) , I was immediately admitted to the hospital by my chief (A.Y.). In the evening after admission, I started to have a persistently high temperature reaching 39.8\u00b0C despite intravenous clarithromycin and cefotaxime. With rapidly increasing respiratory distress, my oxygen saturation decreased significantly to as low as 92%, and nasal oxygen supplementation soon became necessary.",

On the following day, 23 of the 50 sick staff members in our hospital (15 had temperatures of greater than 38\u00b0C, and the remaining 8 had signs of pneumonia on chest x-ray films) were isolated in an observation ward that had an independent air-exchanging system. 3 In fact, our infection-control colleagues worried that this kind of rapid spread of a killer virus could represent a bioterrorism attack. Retrospectively, however, such a preemptive move obviously augmented the chance of crossinfection among us. Exactly 24 hours later, I had to be transferred to our ICU from this observation ward because my condition worsened. The previous two antibiotics were replaced with levofloxacin, but my high fever was unaffected. Hydrocortisone and an antiviral agent, ribavirin, were then administered in the evening. Although the use of steroids and ribavirin in treating SARS still remains controversial, it appeared somewhat beneficial in my case because my body temperature returned to normal 12 hours later and never increased thereafter. Nevertheless, my respiratory function continued to deteriorate in the next few days. Even with a 100% oxygen mask, my saturation could only barely reach 94%. I tried my very best to stay away from mechanical ventilation, even though such an option was seriously considered on a daily basis by my ICU colleagues for most of my remaining stay in the unit.",

I was strongly encouraged that afternoon by a timely call from my teammate, Dr Innes Wan (who contracted SARS at ward 8A during the same consultation with me and also spent a week in our ICU) because he told me that he was heading home the next day. After the conversation, I immediately decided to speed up my physical exercise. To my surprise, just standing up for less than a minute increased my heart rate from 78 to 148 beats/min (even though I was wearing an oxygen mask with a flow of 6 L/min)! Nevertheless, after a total of 6 doses of pulse steroid and vigorous chest physiotherapy, I was eventually weaned from nasal oxygen supplementation on the evening of April 4. I went back home the next morning as soon as my last chest x-ray film was reviewed (Figure 1 , C).

Under the enormous pressure treating the then-unknown but potentially lethal illness and under the scrutiny of many colleagues as patients, the quiet courage, passionate dedication, and magnificent teamwork of those frontline doctors and nurses in my hospital have been deeply cherished locally and also applauded internationally. As a matter of fact, the \"dirty team\" at Prince of Wales Hospital, representing the frontline medical and intensive care staff, won the Time 2003 Asian Heroes Award. 7 When we retrospectively examine the worldwide statistics of all health care workers who contracted SARS, a notable phenomenon is that there were significantly more nursing staff than doctors. For instance, the ratio was about 10:3 in Hong Kong. 3 One of the possible explanations is that compared with a doctor, the nursing staff has more frequent direct contact with patients with SARS, often within a short distance (\u03fd3 feet) and over a longer period of time, which cumulatively could increase the risk of infection.
