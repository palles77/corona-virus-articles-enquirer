The features of COVID-19 patients with and without pneumonia, SARS-CoV-2 transmissibility in asymptomatic carriers, and factors predicting disease progression remain unknown. Methods: We collected information on clinical characteristics, exposure history, and laboratory examinations of all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients admitted to PLA General Hospital. Cox regression analysis was applied to identify prognostic factors. The last follow-up was February 18, 2020. Results: We characterized 55 consecutive COVID-19 patients. The mean incubation was 8.42 (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.55-10.29) days. The mean SARS-CoV-2-positive duration from first positive test to conversion was 9.71 (95%CI, 8.21-11.22) days. COVID-19 course was approximately 2 weeks. Asymptomatic carriers might transmit SARS-CoV-2. Compared to patients without pneumonia, those with pneumonia were 15 years older and had a higher rate of hypertension, higher frequencies of having a fever and cough, and higher levels of interleukin-6 (14.61 vs. 8.06pg/mL, P=0.040), B lymphocyte proportion (13.0% vs.10.0%, P=0.024), low account (<190/\u00b5L) of CD8 + T cells (33.3% vs. 0, P=0.019). Multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that circulating interleukin-6 and lactate independently predicted COVID-19 progression, with a hazard ratio (95%CI) of 1.052 (1.000-1.107) and 1.082 (1.013-1.155), respectively.

[5] [6] [7] The case number increased quickly in Wuhan and posed a large casualty. Up to February 24, 2020, a total of 46607 confirmed cases had been identified in Wuhan, with an estimated case fatality of 4.26% (1987 deaths). SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread to other parts of Hubei province, other parts of China, and 29 countries, resulting in 17680 cases and 508 deaths (estimated fatality: 2.87%), 12975 cases and 100 deaths (0.77%), and 2105 cases and 24 deaths (1.14%), respectively (up to February 24, 2020). The transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 is higher and the fatality is lower compared to SARS-CoV, although the two CoVs share the receptor-human angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2). [8] [9] [10] The etiological, epidemiological, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan have been investigated since the disease outbreak. 3, [5] [6] [7] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] The occurrences of COVID-19 cases outside Wuhan were reported.
