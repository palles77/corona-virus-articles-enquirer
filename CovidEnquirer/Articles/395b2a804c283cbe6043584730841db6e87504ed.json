This framework, with a draft defi nition of an HLIU, was shared throughout the network, and revised to incorporate comments and additional evidence. We used a questionnaire that off ered alternative solutions to particular design and management issues (eg, location and staffi ng of HLIUs, necessity for high effi ciency particulate air [HEPA] fi ltration) to structure group discussions, clarify preferred options, and agree consensus refi nements of the drafts at the third network meeting in 2007. 10 We then prepared this report, and shared it, and subsequent revisions, until the content was agreed by all.",

These include known or suspected infection with a haemorrhagic fever virus (Marburg, Ebola, Lassa, and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever viruses), smallpox or other highly pathogenic orthopoxvirus, emerging highly pathogenic infl uenza virus or other emerging highly pathogenic respiratory virus, an unknown emerging pathogen, an engineered pathogen or a suspected bioterrorist agent, and any emerging or reremerging infection considered by national or international authorities to require high-level containment. EUNID concurs with current guidance on extensively drug-resistant and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, and does not regard provision of HLIUbased care for either infection as essential. [14] [15] [16] Some countries in Europe-eg, Germany, Sweden, and the UK-have more than one HLIU; others-eg, Estonia, Luxembourg, and Spain-have centres designated for the care of patients with highly infectious diseases but do not have a purpose-built HLIU; Austria has neither, but has a cooperative agreement with centres in neighbouring countries for the transfer and care of patients with highly infectious diseases. Details of the facilities for patients with highly infectious diseases in EUNID-participating countries are available on the project website. 17 The advantages of having more than one unit in the same country include shorter, safer, journeys for patients from the referral point to the unit, shorter times for specimen transport from the unit to the nearest BSL4 laboratory, provision of cross-cover (eg, when one unit is closed for maintenance), and the potential for a broader range of specialist research interests. Disadvantages include increased costs, less frequent use, and dispersion of clinical expertise.",

In the past 40 years, patients with symptomatic haemorrhagic fever virus infections have travelled by road, by public airline, and by unmodifi ed air casualty transport without the detection of a secondary case, [34] [35] [36] so that it is now believed that almost all such patients can be managed by transport in standard ambulances, with appropriate personal protective equipment for staff . International guidance on epidemic-prone acute respiratory disease and recommendations on the management of suspected smallpox do not require patient transport by modifi ed ambulance. 20,37,38 Therefore, EUNID does not consider that ambulances with controlled ventilation systems are essential, but recognises that, in some countries, national authorities regard them as desirable, and so have invested in their use. Formal arrangements, which might involve cooperation between international agencies, nongovernmental organisations, and civilian and military medical services, could help to overcome the challenges of arranging an international aeromedical evacuation.",

Waste from the management of patients with a known or suspected infectious disease, where the causal pathogen or toxin is present in the waste, must be identifi ed, separately packaged, and incinerated. 58 Related national legislation varies somewhat from country to country. Increasingly, environmental legislation discourages incineration on-site in health facilities, making it necessary to transport waste to industrial incineration sites. Some countries in Europe have national standards that require that clinical waste be treated to destroy infectious agents before the waste is removed from the site where it was generated; others, however, have defi ned and identifi ed \"low-risk\" clinical waste, and categorised it as non-hazardous, although universal waste-handling precautions may be more likely to ensure safety. 40, 55 Solid wastes generated in an HLIU require decontamination before disposal. Most HLIUs achieve this by autoclaving. The process is easily controllable, and hospital engineers are usually experienced in equipment maintenance and validation. However, autoclaving is time consuming, and energy ineffi cient. Large quantities of clinical waste are generated during the care of patients with highly infectious diseases, especially when critically ill: a 4-day admission of a single patient with suspected Lassa fever in an HLIU in the UK generated three industrial skip loads of double-bagged clinical waste. One HLIU has a protocol for removing all packaging and protective wrapping from disposable and other equipment in a clean area, before taking the equipment into the clinical area. Packaging and other discarded materials (eg, information leafl ets) are disposed of as domestic waste (which may include recycling), cutting the quantity of waste needing autoclaving by about a half. A similar process led to savings of 25-30% in energy expenditure in a hospital in Saudi Arabia. 59 Alternatives to autoclaving include microwave treatment, compaction combined with chemical treatment, which reduces the risks of aerosols but requires the use of chemicals that pose their own risks, and grinding combined with ozone injection, which is unsuitable for waste that might contain group 4 pathogens. [60] [61] [62] Local use of special treatment processes has disadvantages: a scarcity of maintenance expertise, greater system complexity, deterioration of equipment through infrequent, intermittent use, and diffi culties in obtaining spare parts could all contribute to reduced system functionality and safety.",

Guidance in the USA recommends disposal of liquid waste (eg, blood, urine, vomit) without pretreatment by pouring into the sanitary sewer. 13 A unit in the UK converts all liquid waste from the patient to a gel by use of specially formulated absorbent crystals that are added as degradable sachets to disposable containers/urinals immediately before use. The gel is then managed as solid waste by autoclaving. This procedure avoids contamination of the drainage system with high concentrations of viruses, and protects health-care workers from the risk of spillage. The unit uses this method for peritoneal dialysate (which can contain high concentrations of virus, even if not blood-stained 63 ) , and for fl uids collected when setting up haemodialysis equipment or rinsing the blood compartment at the end of the session, 64 but haemodialysis ultrafi ltrate (likely to contain no, or very low, concentrations of virus because particles of more than 7 nm diameter will be retained by the fi ltration membrane [64] [65] [66] [67] ) is disposed of directly into the dirty drains system.

Most would recommend direct disposal of excreta into the dirty drains system without additional safety measures (eg, pre-addition of hypochlorite), because any signifi cant concentrations of virus would be rapidly diluted within the hospital wastewater system and degraded by agents used for routine cleaning, and the theoretical risk to workers undertaking repairs could be managed by using properly trained, supervised, and equipped maintenance staff . A few participants advise more caution, and would recommend that untreated body fl uids (including urine, faeces, haemodialysis ultrafi ltrate) should not be disposed of into the dirty drain system, arguing that their approach provides maximum protection and would also be of benefi t in the event of the emergence of a new, highly infectious pathogen in the period before the pathogen's Review transmission and capacity for environmental survival were fully understood. However, the group agreed unanimously that treatment of water resulting from washing or showering by unit personnel (or an ambulant, continent, patient) was not required.",

            "text": "HLIUs are designed to provide optimum medical care for patients with highly infectious diseases, while at the same time protecting health-care workers, other patients, and the wider community from infection. The renewed interest in biodefence-related research, fuelled by fear of bioterrorism, has meant that more laboratories are working with group 4 pathogens than at any time in the past 50 years, which has increased the likelihood that occupationally acquired infections requiring HLIU-based care will occur. 68 In 2004, for example, a laboratory technician in the USA was admitted to an HLIU for observation after occupational exposure to Ebola virus, and a Russian laboratory worker died of occupationally acquired Ebola haemorrhagic fever. 69 Laboratory personnel working on newly emergent infections can also be at risk of infection, and might, if diagnosis and containment is delayed, transmit infection to others. 70 Infections caused by hazardous pathogens or by newly emerging infections of unknown transmissibility are likely to occur, or be imported, too infrequently in Europe to generate widespread experience or confi dence in their management, but suffi ciently often enough to justify the maintenance of centres of expertise where they can be most eff ectively and safely managed. [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] This framework for the design and operation of these centres in European countries was developed by consensus by a multinational, multidisciplinary expert group. Strongly opposed positions emerged on only two issues: the management of routine clinical samples and the disposal of liquid clinical waste. In each case, the options expressed represent current practice in at least one of the isolation facilities for patients with highly infectious diseases in Europe; in neither case is there evidence to determine which option is the safest. The more cautious positions rely on a stricter application of the precautionary principle, or have been required by a more conservative interpretation, at national level, of European legislation, but are more costly and complex to implement, and are not recommended by similar clinical guidance elsewhere. 13, 28 There are other areas of uncertainty, including the optimum air exchange rate, optimum mode of patient transport, and the necessity for HEPA fi ltration of exhaust Review air. Future research could provide defi nitive answers, and could also provide innovative design and engineering solutions that reduce costs, simplify maintenance, maximise energy effi ciency, or improve health-care worker or patient comfort without compromising safety. Health-care systems, clinical services and training, and health and safety legislation vary between countries, and it should not be expected, and may not be desirable, that risk assessments, risk management solutions, and operational policies for HLIUs in Europe will be completely standardised. For public-health authorities and individual countries to develop and maintain eff ective, fl exible, high-quality services, and improve regional capacity to respond to health threats, a collaborative approach to the design, operation, maintenance, audit, and oversight of these specialist services is required. This \u2022 Be large enough to contain the specialist equipment (eg, mechanical ventilator, haemofi ltration machine, monitoring equipment) needed for critical care, and to allow free movement by staff wearing personal protective equipment \u2022 Have a self-closing door, with well-fi tted, durable, door seals \u2022 Have a non-hand operated wash basin for clinical use in the patient's room \u2022 Have a non-hand operated wash basin for clinical use in the anteroom \u2022 Have an en-suite bathroom (toilet, hand basin, and shower); entrance to bathroom should be from within the patient's room, not the anteroom \u2022 Have a system for visually monitoring the patient and room from the outside, which is fl exible enough to maintain patient privacy, dignity, and safety \u2022 Have a high-quality patient-clinician communication system \u2022 Have a high-quality clinician-clinician communication system \u2022 Have an emergency alarm system so that help can be summoned immediately if need be \u2022 Have an anteroom (or equivalent designated area) large enough to store immediately necessary personal protective equipment and clinical supplies (eg, intravenous fl uids and tubing, syringes, dressings, specimen containers) \u2022 Have an adequate area for packaging clinical specimens and for decontaminating outer specimen containers \u2022 Be designed and constructed for ease of cleaning and decontamination \u2022 Have sealed windows \u2022 Be designed and constructed to be as airtight as possible (ie, monolithic ceilings, tightly fi tting doors and windows, door grill designed for a controlled air path); other design features that enhance the functionality of the ventilation system may also be desirable (eg, interlocking door system, with clinician controlled override function, which ensures that the patient room-anteroom door and anteroom-corridor door cannot both be opened at the same time)",
