            "text": "This review presents the current state of knowledge on the relationship between the environment and the use of municipal waste compost in terms of health risk assessment. The hazards stem from chemical and microbiological agents whose nature and magnitude depend heavily on the degree of sorting and on the composting methods. Three main routes of exposure can be determined and are quantified in the literature: (i) The ingestion of soil/compost mixtures by children, mostly in cases of pica, can be a threat because of the amount of lead, chromium, cadmium, PCDD/F and fecal streptococci that can be absorbed. (ii) Though concern about contamination through the food chain is weak when compost is used in agriculture, some authors anticipate accumulation of pollutants after several years of disposal, which might lead to future hazards. (iii) Exposure is also associated with atmospheric dispersion of compost organic dust that convey microorganisms and toxicants. Data on hazard posed by organic dust from municipal composts to the farmer or the private user is scarce. To date, microorganisms are only measured at composting plants, thus raising the issue of extrapolation to environmental situations. Lung damage and allergies may occur because of organic dust, Gram negative bacteria, actinomycetes and fungi. Further research is needed on the risk related to inhalation of chemical compounds.",

            "text": "In the management of household wastes, the sorting-composting approach presents many advantages: (i) Sorting not only provides for the selection of recyclable and compostable materials, it also reduces the volume of waste to be treated by incineration. Hence, the putrefiable part represents 50-70% of the weight of the entire municipal solid waste (MSW) [1, 2] . (ii) The volume of the putrefiable portion will be reduced during the composting process. (iii) Compost is widely utilized in agriculture, especially in Europe [3] and its use is also strongly encouraged in the USA [4-61. Depending on its degree of maturity and quality, it can be used in vine yards, for mushroom farming (fresh compost), in horticulture (hot-beds with fresh compost), sylviculture, country-side planning (flower beds), preparation of sports fields, or golf courses, maintenance of public or private parks, maintenance of motor-way embankments to cover waste discharge systems, or in the rehabilitation of sites such as mines and sand pits [7-121. The chemical components play important roles in the physical and chemical properties of the soil f13,14]. Amendment is more interesting for the improvement of soil characteristics than for the fertilizer value of the compost [15] . Indeed, the use of municipal solid waste (MSW) influences the water retention capacity, resistance to erosion, density, pH, conductivity and the nutrient content of the soil [15,161. There are three main methods for cornposting: gathering of waste in windrows that are turned at regular intervals, static piles of waste that are aerated by deliberate passage of air within the mass (aerated static piles), and finally by gathering waste materials in a totally enclosed and controlled environment, that is, in a reactor [2,17-201. Many organic waste products are used for compost: yard wastes (YW), sewage sludge (SS), municipal solid wastes (MSW), industrial and agricultural (wood, animal droppings, etc.) [211. In the present work, we have only studied domestic waste in single composts or accompanied with SS or Yw.",

These chemical or biological contaminants may expose different populations to health hazards, ranging from the composting plant workers to the consumer of vegetable products treated with compost fertilizers. For example, the humus part of composts consists of numerous ligands, some of which are more or less irreversibly bound to metallic elements [22] . The metals may be released in the soil, when a change in environmental conditions such as pH occurs during application of the compost [23] ; released metals then become bioavailable for plants. Among the toxic elements found in composts, arsenic, asbestos, hexavalent chromium, nickel or PCB have been classified as carcinogens or potential carcinogens [241.

It should be noted however that these pathogens are not in their natural environment, that is, in their hosts. This does not favor their survival. If fungi and bacteria strains have the possibility to multiply, viruses and other parasites can at best acquire a form of resistance. The pathogens are forced to compete with other microorganisms which are in their natural environment.

The maturity of compost is also important because of its ability to create nuisance when used. The decomposition of immature compost is completed in the soil under anaerobic conditions, resulting in odor [63] . Furthermore, the bioavailability of heavy metals is a function of the degree of maturity of the compost, since the humic material is capable of binding them. Experiments have shown that metals become less bioavailable with increasing maturity.

For example, on a soil treated for 7 years, 0.9-32 ppm Cd was observed in beetroot several years after treatment was stopped [95] .

The risk associated with ingestion of dust from an amended soil depends on its use. For farming, especially for vegetables and potted farm crops, 50 t/ha of compost is used while 300 t/ha is spread in public places (gardens and green playgrounds). Composts are usually mixed with a depth of soil of approximately 30 cm [127] . If the density of soil and compost are comparable, the dilution of the compost in the soil is, depending on the quantities that are disposed, in a fraction of one-hundredth or one-tenth. The level of exposure of an individual depends on the quantity of soil ingested. The best estimate of ingestion of telluric dust by a normal child is about 100 mg and about 60 mg for an adult while a child suffering from geophagy may absorb up to 5 g/day [82, 83] . This route of exposure is, however, modest because the use of compost for soil treatment by private owners or for public gardens and parks currently represents only 2-5% of the total compost production [127] . The hypothesis that an individual is in permanent contact with an amended soil is theoretically possible, but this is not very likely to occur.

In spite of this, no increases were observed in the levels of Cd and Ni in cultivated crops. Rather, a decrease in the quantity of As was observed while Cr and Pb increased only by 15% in carrots, beetroot, turnip, pears and beans. However, in another S-year study of the fate of Cd and Ni in soils amended annually with SS and of their transfer to the leaves of maize plants, a strong increase in the quantities of both metals were observed (50-105%) for Cd and 40% for Ni in comparison with the levels measured after the first application [88] .",

For instance, when wheat is transformed into flour, the quantity of Cd is reduced by about 46% due to elimination from the chaff [128] . Contamination of the food chain may also come through animals. Grass grown on soils with high concentrations of metals may contaminate animal feed. This hazard is apparently minimal for Cd because the quantities present in composts are not sufficient to yield high amounts in plants that might accumulate in the muscles of animals. With increasing daily intake, accumulation in the body is minor. A 40-fold increase in Cd daily intake in pig does not yield a significant increase in the quantity in the muscle [128,1371. Cd normally accumulates in the offal which represents only a small fraction of our food regime (0.3-0.5%). Only populations that abundantly eat liver or kidney are seriously exposed [1281. However, there is a direct potential risk for animals grazing on grounds treated with composts. During grazing, animals ingest 3-6% of soil with grass. An increase has been observed in muscular tissues for animals grazing in fields amended with SS containing 8.8 ppm of Cd [128] . The concentration observed in compost is much lower (maximum 12 ppm) and the risk is therefore less than when SS is used, even after application for several decades [102] .",

Quantities found in compost may reach 200 ppm which, for a one-tenth dilution, give a non-negligible surplus; this increase is lower in the case of a one-hundredth dilution. These results are due to the high content of certain contaminants (phenanthrene, naphthalene, anthracene, pyrene, acenaphthalene and fluorene) but these compounds are not very toxic. Out of the seven PAHs that are well known carcinogens (Table 5 ) none was found above the standard in the soil after compost was applied. Agricultural use of SS (at levels comparable to those of composts) gives only low concentrations of PAH in plants, even after a very long trial [104] . While PAHs penetrate into plants, they concentrate mainly in the underground teguments and only very little in the aerial parts. Peeling and washing before cooking helps to avoid contamination through the food chain [104] . However, the risks might increase during repeated applications. No accumulation of PAHs in agricultural soil was noticed after treatment with MSW composts for 3 years but the authors of the study admit the inadequacies of the data and the necessity to carry out experiments of longer duration [146] . As regards the risks associated with leachates of composts, 10% of PAHs are free in SS (and many thus percolate) [147] . If this fraction holds true in compost and taking into account future dilution, the chances of contamination of water is minute [147] . PCDD / F. Though WHO has recommended an ADI of 10 pg/day/kg for 2,3,7,8 TCDD [148] , the AD1 for complex mixtures of compounds is not known. The US-EPA has calculated an acceptable exposure dose to PCDD/F for a general population as 6 X 10d9 rig/kg/day [149] . This exposure should not provoke the occurrence of more than one cancer in a population of one million persons. If one considers the least contaminated compost (0.1 ppm) and depending on what the soil is used for, the daily absorbed doses by an adult, a normal child and a child with pica are 40-100000 times the recommended dose. However, this result should be considered with care because there are only a very small amount of measurements on dioxins and furans in composts and it is not possible to assess whether the samples were representative. These compounds are sparingly soluble in water and are strongly adsorbed onto dust and soils. Therefore, they accumulate but have low availability 11041. Yet, a literature review shows that several surveys reported leaf assimilation of PCDD/F by plants due to their dispersion in air [150] . The transfer of PCDD/F by animals has been reported when grazing animals ingest dispersed contaminated SS [150] . Finally, PCDD/Fs are not easily bioavailable and, therefore, are not likely to concentrate in leachates.",

Some authors reported that it is possible for viruses to penetrate into the plant through the roots and to migrate into the stem [1221. The survival of enteric bacteria is also influenced by humidity and temperature. In the soil, they survive longer in the saturated zone. In an experiment, though no bacterial indicator was detected in the soil before amendment with SS, it took 7 months to eliminate the effect of 6 X lo8 Strepto-coccus/g, 1.3 x lo8 total coliforms/g and 0.37 x 10' faecal coliforms/g [80, 122] . During this time span, the paradoxical phenomenon of recolonization of mixtures of soil and compost may take place especially after rain. Hence, a compost with a normal rate of indicators may undergo a sudden increase in their concentration (and reach values above the proposed norms) following changes in environmental conditions [1551. The survival of parasites is the longest. Eggs of Ascaris may persist 3 years during storage of mud and up to 78-107 days in the soil [122, 59] .

Gram negative bacteria are pathogenic because of the endotoxin they produce. The activity of the endotoxin does not depend on the integrity of the bacterial cell because it relates to the lipopolysaccharides present in their wall. A fragment of the wall is as dangerous as the whole bacterial cell [115, 162] . A security level of 1000/m3 has been proposed for Gram negative bacteria [12] , though some authors claimed that this concentration could provoke an allergic reaction [118] .

Bioavailability is much higher in respect of uncomposted sewage sludge and may reach 92% in the case of highly contaminated sewage [90]. Studies on leachates have shown that a liter of leachates collected from compost made up of a mixture of MSW and SS contains 0.17 mg of Cd [91], while SS composted alone gives about 0.1-0.014 mg/l [92]",

This situation is rare since the majority of the observations do not exceed a bioavailability value of 37% [94]. Because of low rate, the methods of analysis are not effective for the detection of Ni in leachates of composts of plant wastes 1861. On the other hand, a concentration of 0.3 mg/l has been found in a compost of MSW and SS [91]. The French standard for drinking water is 50 pg/l. Several studies have shown the absorption of Ni in plants, especially in vegetables, following the application of composts [81,88,94,99,100]. Values ranging from 6.8 ppm to 61.1 ppm have been found in the aerial parts of wheat [99,100] and 15.5 ppm in the entire seedling of soya. Studies on soils treated with uncomposted SS have shown that maize contains 2-17 ppm of Ni [88]. Chromium. The lowest (8.4 ppm) amount of chromium is found in a compost of SS [SS], while the highest (403 ppm) occurs in a MSW compost [77](Fig. 2, graph D). In spite of these observations, there is no statistical difference between compost of MSW origin and the other types (P = 0.56). The bioavailability values are between 0.2% [loll and 37.3% [99](Fig. 2, graph D). The latter represents an extreme value; most fall below 20%. As for other metals, this value is obtained from experiments carried out with soil at low pH (pH 5.27). Leachates of farmyard waste composts do not contain significant amounts of chromium and only 0.1 mg/l was found in mixed composts ofMSW and SS [86,91]. The maximum acceptable concentration in potable water in France is 50 i-%/l* Some authors have described the assimilation of chromium in plants cultivated on soils amended with composts[89,94,100,101].
