This study aimed to quantify the variation in individual test-day milk yield and somatic cell count, risk of reproductive failure after first service of dairy cows, and risk of death of calves and heifers according to the BCV and BRSV status of the herd. Three types of status were defined for BCV and BRSV infections, based on 1) the dynamics over a 7-mo period of BCV-and BRSV-specific antibody levels in pooled milk of primiparous cows; 2) the possible occurrence of presumably BCV-and BRSV-related clinical outbreaks; and 3) the combination of both pieces of information. A total of 36,184 test days, 2,716 cows with a first service, and 4,104 calves and heifers in 65 Swedish herds were included in the analyses. Animal performance associated with BCV and BRSV infections was quantified using hierarchical mixed generalized and survival models, after adjustment for covariates known to influence the performance under study. A significant reduction in milk yield was observed for cows in presumably BRSV recently infected herds, as well as in herds having a presumably BRSV-related clinical outbreak (of 0.57 and 0.91 kg/d, respectively), compared with cows in presumably infection-free herds. There was also a significant increase in somatic cell count (of 12,000 cells/mL) for cows located in herds with a BRSV outbreak. The risk of failure after first service, as well as the risk of death in calf and heifer, was numerically higher in BRSV-infected herds, although this was not statistically significant. In contrast, BCV infection herd status, as defined in the present study, was not significantly associated with any production losses in animals from infected herds compared with those in infection-free herds.",

            "text": "These infections are widespread in dairy cattle. Among 113 dairy herds in the Ithaca area (New York, NY), a 33% incidence of winter dysentery was recorded over a 9-mo period . Bulk tank milk data, reflecting the antibody status of lactating cows, also showed very high nationwide prevalences of BCV (89.2 to 100%; Paton et al., 1998; Tr\u00e5v\u00e9n et al., 1999) and BRSV infections (70 to 100%; Elvander, 1996; Paton et al., 1998) in the UK and Sweden. The use of a BRSV vaccine is considered to have a minimal effect on antibody levels, as its implementation was rare in UK (Paton et al., 1998) and not used at all in Sweden. Furthermore, there is no BCV vaccination program in Sweden, and none was mentioned in Paton et al. (1998) . Moreover, a high BCV and BRSV infection burden and spread in calves has been recently demonstrated in the southwestern part of Sweden (H\u00e4gglund et al., 2006) . Measures to control the spread of these infections may be warranted, because infectious diseases are likely to have detrimental effects on the animals and their productivity. However, information on the production effects associated with these infections on a dairy farm remains scarce, and an assessment of production effects at the farm level might contribute to support decisionmaking for control.",

Herds were members of the local livestock association (Svenska Husdjur) and enrolled in the National Animal Disease Recording System (Emanuelson, 1988) as well as in the Swedish Official Milk Recording Scheme (Olsson et al., 2001) . These herds participated in a specific study aiming at investigating the dynamics of BRSV and BCV infections [A. Ohlson, E. Emanuelson, M. Tr\u00e5v\u00e9n, and S. Alenius (both of Department of Clinical Sciences, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden); unpublished data]. During this study, periodic testing at 4 sampling times (fall 2006, spring 2007, fall 2007, and spring 2008) was performed to measure the level of BCV-and BRSV-specific antibodies in milk. In each herd, information on individual milk production, SCC, and reproductive events (calvings, AI, and pregnancy checks), as well as entrance dates and exit dates and reasons for exit was available for all animals present at any point in time.",

            "text": "In each herd, at each sampling time, the level of BCV-and BRSV-specific antibodies was assessed from pooled milk samples of 5 home-bred primiparous cows. Testing of such samples by ELISA has recently been recognized as a suitable method to detect the putative presence of cows with antibodies to BCV or BRSV in dairy herds: there was good agreement between results of individual samples and the results of pooled samples (Ohlson et al., 2009) . Such a strategy has been successfully used to determine BVDV herd status on a large scale (Lindberg and Alenius, 1999) . Compared with assessment of bulk tank milk, a more immediate assessment of herd status was achieved by sampling young cows, as the antibodies may remain detectable for years without reinfection. The sampling was performed by veterinarians and technicians. Ten-milliliter test tubes containing 1.5 mg of the preservative agent Bronopol (2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1.3-diol, Steins Laboratory, J\u00f6nk\u00f6ping, Sweden) were used. The samples were not diluted or centrifuged and were stored at \u221220\u00b0C until analysis. The milk samples were analyzed for presence of immunoglobulin G antibodies to BCV (Alenius et al., 1991) and BRSV (Elvander et al., 1995) by commercially available indirect ELISA (Svanova Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden). The same batch was used for all analyses. The optical density (OD) at 450 nm was corrected by subtraction of the negative control antigen OD. To adjust for day-to-day variations, the percentage positivity (PP) was calculated as follows: (corrected OD/positive control corrected OD) \u00d7 100. Cut-off was set to PP equal to 20, corresponding to a corrected OD of 0.20, which is the cut-off recommended by the manufacturer for individual milk samples. Using serum, the sensitivity and specificity of the BCV assay, relative to a virus neutralization test, were estimated to be 84.6 and 100%, respectively (91 sera from 9 Swedish dairy herds; Alenius et al., 1991) . Corresponding values for the BRSV assay were 94.0 and 100%, respectively, relative to an established ELISA in use at the Central Veterinary Laboratory (Weybridge, UK; 157 sera from Swedish and English herds; Elvander et al., 1995) . The 2 assays have been recognized to work equally well in milk and serum [S. Alenius (Department of Clinical Sciences, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences, Uppsala, Sweden), personal communication; Elvander et al., 1995] . The same PP cut-off of 20 was applied to pooled milk samples, because Ohlson et al. (2009) found a good agreement (97 and 94%) between results of individual and pooled samples for BCV and BRSV assays, respectively. Therefore, a herd was considered as positive if the PP value was \u226520, and negative otherwise.",

The assumption of proportionality was not rejected (P > 0.05) in any model (results not shown). To account for clustering (i.e., animals are not independent within herd), the data were fitted by using the robust sandwich estimate (Wei et al., 1989) for statistical inference (computation of robust estimates of standard errors). An adjusted relative hazard ratio (HR) was estimated for each covariate by taking the exponent of the estimates of effects.

These findings were in agreement with biological expectations and with the literature. The mortality rate can reach 20% in some severe outbreaks (Stott et al., 1980) , and pneumonia and cough are recognized as major risk factors for death early in life (Waltner-Toews et al., 1986; Curtis et al., 1988; van der Fels-Klerx et al., 2002; Svensson et al., 2006) . These estimates were, however, not significantly different from unity, possibly because of a lack of statistical power because of the relatively low sample sizes (2,716 cows with a first AI within the periods-at-risk and 4,104 calves and heifers at risk of mortality, respectively). Further studies are needed to confirm or reject the trends observed here. We also observed a significant increase in SCC (of more than 10,000 cells/mL) for cows in herds with a BRSV outbreak. This increase cannot only be caused by a concentration effect, because the increase would have been about 3,000 cells/mL if exclusively in relation to the associated reduction in milk yield (\u22120.91 kg/d) observed in the same herds.",

First, the decreased milk yield associated with winter dysentery, even if large in magnitude (on average 22%), is often described as being of short duration (<2 wk; Tr\u00e5v\u00e9n, 2000) . Therefore, if it exists, such an effect would have been difficult to detect using test-day records, which are usually performed 1 mo apart. Second, the TDMY used for comparisons were all those within the periodat-risk (i.e., from October year n to April year n + 1), whereas winter is known to be a predisposing factor for BCV outbreaks (Saif, 1990) . Thus, this strategy may have \"smoothed\" the possible decrease in milk yield associated with an outbreak over the whole period-atrisk.

Because both these groups experienced a recent BCV circulation, this finding might suggest that herds in which the owner noticed a presumably BCV-related clinical outbreak are better managed to some extent with higher performance. This hypothesis is also supported by the fact that only 3 of the 28 herds with a presumably BCV-related clinical outbreak also had a presumably BRSV-related clinical outbreak (for which a decrease in milk yield was observed; Table 1 ). In addition, it may be questioned if all outbreaks classified as BCV related were indeed related to BCV infection, because signs of diarrhea (the main criterion to define an outbreak) may well be related to other factors; for instance, related to feeding regimens, especially in high-performing herds where cows are more sensitive. This reason for misclassification was deemed not differential between herds exhibiting or not exhibiting specific antibodies to BCV, because the farmers were not aware of the status of their herd when they declared the observed clinical signs. In that context, the presumably BCVrelated outbreaks might have been overestimated in our study. The same may not necessarily apply for cough, for which the risk of misclassification toward BRSV infection was deemed lower.",
