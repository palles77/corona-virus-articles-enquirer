The MeOH extracts of the fruits of the Paulownia tree yielded many small molecules capable of targeting PLpro. Five of these compounds were new geranylated flavonoids, tomentin A, tomentin B, tomentin C, tomentin D, tomentin E (1-5). Structure analysis of new compounds (1-5) by NMR showed that they all contain a 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran moiety. This chemotype is very rare and is derived from cyclization of a geranyl group with a phenol functionality. Most compounds (1-12) inhibited PLpro in a dose dependent manner with IC 50 's raging between 5.0 and 14.4 lM. All new compounds having the dihydro-2H-pyran group showed better inhibition than their parent compounds (1 vs 11, 2 vs 9, 4 vs 12, 5 vs 6). In kinetic studies, 1-12 emerged to be reversible, mixed inhibitors.",

            "text": "Between November 2002 and July 2003 world news relayed stories of a deadly disease. The disease became known as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and it is known to have caused the deaths of 916 people. 1 What is most staggering about this disease is that reported death rates were as high as 20% in the general population and can rise to over 50% in the elderly. Importantly, although no cases of SARS have been reported since 2004, the virus has not been eradicated and reservoirs of SARS-like viruses exist among bat populations. 2 SARS is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV), which is a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus that replicates in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Replication is mediated by the replicase polyprotein, which is translated directly from the viral genome, and is processed by corona viral proteases present in the replicase polyprotein. Two cysteine proteases that reside within the polyprotein, a papain-like protease (PLpro) and a 3-Chymotrypsin-like protease (3CLpro), each catalyze their own release and liberation of the other nonstructural proteins from the polyprotein. These processes are there by mandatory for virus-mediated RNA replication. PLpro serves other roles because it is not only responsible for processing the viral polyprotein but can also cleave ubiquitin chains and effect deISGylation (ISGlyation is involved in immune response to viruses). 3 Since these roles serve as virulence factors which are required for infectivity, PLpro is considered to be an attractive target for antiviral drugs.",

Consumption of fruits of this plant is associated with a decrease in the frequency of asthmatic attacks 4 and show a hypotensive effect. An aqueous extract of fruit and leaves regenerates hair and stimulates the scalp. 5 Iridoids, lignans and flavonoids have previously been reported as bioactive compounds within P. tomentosa. 6 Among them, geranylated flavonoids are known as its main bioactive constituents. Some studies have reported that this species displays cytotoxic, antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. 7 Recently, geranylated flavonoid from this plant showed inhibitory activities against acetylcholinesterase and butrylcholinesterase. 8 The aim of the present work is to investigate the PLpro inhibitory activities of P. tomentosa fruit extracts. We isolated a total of twelve PLpro inhibitory flavonoids of which five emerged to be new flavonoids containing a rare 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran moiety. Analysis of all isolated compounds in PLpro inhibition assays showed that all species were able to inhibit the enzyme, but the novel compounds were the most effective.",

            "text": "Starting with a methanol extract of P. tomentosa fruits, we purified compounds displaying PLpro inhibition by activity-guided fractionation using a SARS-CoV PLpro activity assay. Compounds (1-5) emerged to be new geranylated flavonoid derivatives which we have named tomentin A (1), tomentin B (2), tomentin C (3), tomentin D (4), and tomentin E (5). As shown in Figure 1 , compounds (6-12) were identified as the known extracts 3 0 -O-methyldiplacol (6), 4 0 -O-methyldiplacol (7), 3 0 -O-methyldiplacone (8), 4 0 -O-methyldiplacone (9), mimulone (10), diplacone (11), and 6geranyl-4 0 ,5,7-trihydroxy-3 0 ,5 0 -dimethoxyflavanone (12) by comparing our spectroscopic data (Supplementary data) and those previously reported. [6] [7] [8] [9] Compound 1 was isolated as a yellow oil with molecular formula C 25 H 30 O 7 established by the [M + ] ion at 442.1991 (Calcd 442.1992) in the HREIMS. 1 H and 13 C NMR data in conjunction with DEPT experiments indicated the presence of 25 carbon atoms, consisting of the following functional groups: 6 methylenes (sp 3 ), 1 methine (sp 3 ), 4 methines (sp 2 ), 3 methyls and 11 quarternary carbons ( Table 1 ). The analysis of degrees of unsaturation indicated a tetracyclic skeleton with two aromatic rings. According to its 13 C and 1 H NMR spectra, compound 1 was found to contain an sp 3 methylene (diastereotopic protons: H A d H 3.12, dd and H B d H 2.74, dd) in the a-position of the carbonyl group and an oxygenated methine (d H 5.37 dd). The overall NMR characteristics suggested that 1 bears a flavanone backbone. The only notable feature was that H-5 0 and H-6 0 had the same chemical shift (d H 6.88) and thus were an apparent singlet (an A2 system). HMQC analysis verified that these two protons were in fact on non-equivalent carbons. The remaining proton within this ring, H-2 0 , was also a singlet and had a chemical shift of d H 7.04. The only arrangement of the ring consistent with three inequivalent proton-substituted carbons and all coupling constants 0 Hz is the proposed structure (3 0 ,5 0 -disubstitution would lead to a reduction in carbon number due to symmetry and a 2 0 ,3 0 -disubstitution must lead to ortho coupling between all three peaks). A characteristic hydrogen bonded proton signal of the C-5 (d C 162.7) hydroxyl group was observed at d H 12.47. This is consistent with C-5OH forming a H-bond to the isolated proton at C-8 (A ring, d H 6.03). The connectivity of the C ring was affirmed by COSY correlations of C-2H and C-3H2. HMBC correlation of C-2H with aromatic ring B (principally C-1 0 ) proved the position of the B ring relative to the C ring. The presence of the stereogenic center C-2 is responsible for the chemical inequivalence of the two methylene protons at C-3. HMBC correlation of the ketone function (d C 197.7) with C-3H2 indicated that these two groups were juxtaposed. A weak cross peak between C-3H2 and C4a confirmed that rings A and C were fused. The presence of a 2-hydroxy-2-methylpentyl moiety was deduced from proton coupling networks across H-5 00 /H-6 00 /H-7 00 in the COSY spectrum and also HMBC correlations between H-7 00 /C-8 00 , C-9 00 and C-10 00 . The presence of two methylene functions at C-1 00 and C-2 00 was confirmed from both a COSY connectivity between 2H-1 00 , d H 2.65 and 2H-2 00 , d H 1.67 as well as an HMBC correlation of H-2 00 with oxygenated quarternary carbon (C-3 00 , d C 73.0). Finally, the geranyl-derived side chain was unveiled to be a 2-methyl-2-(4-hydroxy-4-methylphentyl)-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran moiety by HMBC correlation of C-3 00 with H-2 00 , H-4 00 and H-5 00 . HMBC correlation of H1 00 with C-5 (d 162.7), C-6 (d C 110.7) and C-7 (d C 165.6) affirmed the cyclization of this side chain with C-6 and C-7 (Fig. 2) . The absolute stereochemistry of 1 was elucidated as S on the basis of CD data (a positive absorption at 328 nm and a negative absorption at 288 nm). 6 Thus, using the above obtained spectral data, compound 1 was identified as (2S)-2-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-5-hydroxy-8-(4-hydroxy-4-methylpentyl)-8-methyl-2,3,7,8-tetrahydropyrano[3,2-g]chromen-4(6H)-one and named tomentin A.",

The difference was the appearance of a 3 proton singlet at d H 3.70, corresponding to methylation of one of the hydroxy groups within the pendant 3,4-dihydroxyphenyl ring (B ring). Given the broad spectral similarities between this species and compound 1, we focus on the position of the methyl group. The strongest HMBC correlation for the arylic OCH 3 was to a quaternary carbon at 149.4 ppm (C-4 0 ). Correlations were also observed from C-5 0 H to C-4 0 and OCH 3 implying that the methoxy group is in the para position to the alkyl substituent. Consistent with this arrangement, C-3 0 showed a strong HMBC correlation to C-2 0 H implying that the OH group was in the meta position to the alkyl substituent.

            "text": "Compound 3 a yellow oil, had the molecular formula C 27 H 34 O 8 [M + ] ion at 486.2257 (Calcd 486.2254) in HREIMS. Its 1 H and 13 C NMR data, parsed out using 2D NMR experiments (Table 2 ) also closely resembled those of 1. However, there were two notable differences: firstly the B ring showed only two singlets at d H 6.79 (H-2 0 ) and d H 6.94 (H-6 0 ); there was also a new 6 proton singlet which corresponds to two methyl groups. In conjunction with the mass spectrometric data, the B ring showed characteristics of a trioxygenated arene (R 1 = R 2 = OCH 3 ;R 3 = OH). Since H-2 0 and H- nonequivalent, the position of the lone aromatic hydroxy group must be on C-5 0 . The signals of d C 57.2 and d H 3.87 (6H, s) were assigned as the two methoxy groups. HMBC correlation of d H 3.87 with d C 149.2 and d C 146.7 further confirmed that these two OCH 3 groups were placed on C-3 0 and C-4 0 , respectively (Fig. 2 ). 3's absolute stereochemistry was elucidated as S on the basis of CD data (a positive absorption at 333 nm and a negative absorption at 296 nm). 6 (Table 2 ). However the 1 H NMR clearly showed a 2H singlet at d H 6.73. This corresponding to two arylic CHs in the B ring. Thus 4 is a regioisomer of 3 where the methoxy groups occupy the 3 0 and 5 0 positions on the B ring. Consistent with this symmetrical arrangement within the B ring, C-3 0 and C-5 0 had identical 13 C NMR chemical shifts at d C 148.9 (Fig. 2) . CD analysis showed that the absolute stereochemistry of 4 was S (a positive absorption at 331 nm and a negative absorption at 294 nm). 6 Thus, compound 4 was identified as (2S)-5-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenyl)-8-(4-hydroxy-4-methylpentyl)-8-methyl-2,3,7,8-tetrahydropyrano[3,2-g]chromen-4(6H)-one and named tomentin D.",

Thus this compound contained 11 degrees of unsaturation. 1 H and 13 C NMR data together with DEPT experiments indicated the presence of 26 carbon atoms, consisting of the following functional groups: 5 methylenes (sp 3 ), 2 methine (sp 3 ), 4 methines (sp 2 ), 4 methyls and 11 quarternary carbons ( Table 2) . The difference between this species and 1-4 was the appearance of one more oxygenated methine (d H 4.68) and disappearance of diastereotopic protons that were present in compounds 1-4. The overall NMR characteristic suggested that 5 bears a dihydroflavonol backbone. The B ring was confirmed to be a 3-methoxy-4hydroxyphenyl function as seen in compound 1. This is clear from ortho-coupled protons (d H 6.89 for H-5 0 and d H 7.06 for H-6 0 ) and a singlet at d H 7.22 (H-2 0 ) and HMBC correlations of C-3 0 (d C 148.6) with OCH 3 (d H 3.89) (Fig. 2) . The emergence of o-coupling (which was not observed in the compounds above) in this compound stems from the fact that H-5 0 and H-6 0 no longer have coincidental chemical shifts and thus are not an A2 system. The large coupling constant between H-2 and H-3 [J = 11.6 Hz] indicate a trans-diaxial arrangement of these two protons. This agrees with the fact that dihydroflavonols are found in nature only in the 2,3-trans configuration. The absolute stereochemistry of 5 was elucidated as 2R, 3R on the basis of CD data (a positive absorption at 332 nm and a negative absorption at 295 nm). 6 Thus, compound 5 was identified as (2R,3R)-3,5-dihydroxy-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-8-(4hydroxy-4-methylpentyl)-8-methyl-2,3,7,8-tetrahydropyrano[3,2g]chromen-4(6H)-one and named tomentin E.",

We set out to validate the medicinally used plant, Paulownia tomentosa, as a rich source of inhibitors of SARS-CoV PLpro. We chose to screen for inhibitors of this protease because it is a promising drug target since the enzyme is required for numerous processes in the viral life cycle. Our search led us to previously undisclosed natural products, which bear an unusual 3,4-dihydro-2H-pyran motif. This structural arrangement was found to be more effective at inhibiting SARS-CoV PLpro enzyme than the parent compounds that were cyclization precursors. This clearly underscores the importance of unearthing new or rare architectures from natural products.

A 10 ml aliquot of an overnight culture was seeded into 1000 ml of fresh LB (Luria-Bertani) medium containing 50 mg/ml ampicillin and cells were grown to OD 600 nm of 0.6 at 37\u00b0C. The cells were cooled down in ice for 30 min and protein expression was induced for 5 h with 0.4 mM isopropyl b-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 30\u00b0C. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 6 min at 4\u00b0C. The harvested cells were washed twice in phosphate-buffered saline. The cell pellet was used directly for purification or stored at \u00c080\u00b0C until use.",

After centrifugation at 15,000 rpm for 1 h, the clarified supernatant was collected, filtered (Qualitative filter paper, Advantec, Japan) and applied onto a column of Nickel Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare, Sweden) beads pre-equilibrated with the binding buffer. The column was washed first with 20 column volumes of binding buffer and then with 2 column volumes of washing buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 30 mM imidazole). The recombinant PLpro proteins were eluted with the elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 100 mM NaCl and 300 mM imidazole). The PLpro eluted from the nickel column was further purified by ion-exchange chromatography using a salt gradient with a SOURCE 15Q column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) in 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.5 and 2 mM DTT. The PLpro was finally purified by size exclusion chromatography with a Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl and 2 mM DTT. The fractions containing PLpro were pooled, exchanged into 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and 10 mM DTT and concentrated to a final concentration of 10 mg/ml by ultrafiltration (Microcon YM-30, Millipore Corporation, Bedford, Massachusetts, USA). The protein purity was examined by SDS-PAGE and native-PAGE. The protein concentration was determined by Bradford method (Bradford, 1976) using bovine serum albumin as the standard. The N-terminal his-tag was removed by TEV digestion for activity assay.",

            "text": "IC 50 values for all inhibitors were determined using a 96-well plate-based assay similar to our previously reported procedures. 12 The substrate used in the assay was the fluorogeneic peptide Z-Arg-Leu-Arg-Gly-Gly-AMC (Z-RLRGG-AMC), which was purchased from ENZO Life Sciences. The substrate contains the five C-terminal residues of human ubiquitin with a C-terminal 7-amido-4-methylcoumarin (AMC) group. Hydrolysis of the AMC-peptide bond dramatically increases the fluorescence of AMC, allowing conversion to be accurately determined. Reactions were performed in a total volume of 250 lL, which contained the following components: 20 mM Tris-buffer, pH 8.0, 10 mM DTT, 52 lM Z-RLRGG-AMC, 2% DMSO, and varying concentrations of inhibitor (0-200 lM). Reactions were initiated with the addition of PLpro to produce a final enzyme concentration of 52 nm. Reaction progress was monitored continuously on a SpectraMax M3Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (k excitation = 360 nm; k emission = 460 nm; gain = 40). Initial rate data were fit to the equation vi = vo/(1 + [I]/IC 50 ) using the enzyme kinetics module of Sigma Plot (v. 9.01 Systat Software, Inc.) where vi is the reaction rate in the presence of inhibitor, vo is the reaction rate in the absence of inhibitor, and [I] is the inhibitor concentration.",
