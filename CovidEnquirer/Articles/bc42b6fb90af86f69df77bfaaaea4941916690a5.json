Studies investigating the shortterm and long-term effects of child sexual abuse (CSA) have demonstrated considerable psychological, behavioral, and interpersonal difficulties in survivors (Bietchman, Zucker, Hood, DaCosta, & Akman, 1991; Browne & Finkelhor, 1986; Neumann, Houskamp, Pollock, & Briere, 1996) . More specifically, research suggests that sexually abused children often suffer from anxiety, depression, somatic complaints, nightmares, low self-esteem, distrust of others, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms (Koverola, Pound, Heger, & Lytle, 1993; Merry & Andrews, 1994) . Furthermore, such difficulties have been demonstrated in both male and female survivors, as well as college student, community and national samples (Bietchman et al., 1991; Browne & Finkelhor, 1986; Trickett & Putnam, 1998) .",

A study examining adjustment in 240 sexual abuse survivors under 18 years old found that 49% of the participants did not evidence signs of emotional distress or PTSD symptomatology following the abuse event (Caffaro-Rouget, Lang, & van Santen, 1989) . Overall, meta-analyses (i.e., Jumper, 1995; Neumann et al., 1996; Rind & Tromovitch, 1997; Rind, Tromovitch, & Bauserman, 1998) suggest that although survivors of CSA often report psychological distress, the effect sizes are small, ranging from .10 to .15. Therefore, though CSA is empirically associated with maladjustment, evidence suggests that abuse events do not result in universally large effects on victims and additional factors likely contribute to future adjustment. Although substantial research has examined mediating factors such as coping strategies and social support, in predicting such variable outcomes in sexually abused children, little research has been devoted to understanding the effects of specific cognitive techniques, or thought control strategies, in this population.",

            "text": "For the current study, we use Wells' Metacognitive Model (2000) of PTSD to conceptualize subsequent adjustment following CSA. Based on this model, intrusions, arousal and attentional orienting are typical symptoms following such a stressful event. In fact, these responses are vehicles for subsequent emotional processing that allow the individual to develop a plan for future threats. Although this process is typically carried out unhindered, it requires flexibility in the individual's cognitive abilities and is influenced by the individual's coping strategies. As such, unhealthy patterns of adjustment emerge due to the individual's metacognitive beliefs. For example, the belief that worrying about a threat will improve one's ability to avoid harm will lead an individual to become hypersensitive to potential threats, and will ultimately be problematic. Wells and Davies (1994) empirically demonstrated five such cognitive coping techniques, called thought control strategies, which individuals use to deal with unpleasant thoughts resulting from negative events. These strategies are (i) distraction (e.g., purposely redirecting one's attention to another thought), (ii) reappraisal (e.g., assessing the meaning of the thought), (iii) social control (e.g., revealing the thought to another person), (iv) worry (e.g., dwelling on a negative thought), and (v) self-punishment (e.g., feeling angry with oneself for thinking about a negative event). Past research suggests that worry and punishment strategies are positively associated with psychopathology, such as depression and PTSD symptoms following negative life events (Reynolds & Wells, 1999; Roussis & Wells, 2008) . Conversely, Reynolds and Wells (1999) found an inverse relationship between both reappraisal and distraction, and depression. In addition, Wells and Davies (1994) suggest that the use of social control strategies may lead to a reduction in PTSD symptomatology and result in better adjustment following a traumatic event.",

To examine the mediating role of thought control strategies in this retrospective study of young adult female CSA survivors, mediation analysis procedures outlined by Baron and Kenny (1986) will be used. Overall, the primary objective of the current study is to test a mediation model in which it is predicted that thought control strategies will mediate the association between the severity of the sexual abuse events and PTSD symptomatology in non-clinical female college-age survivors of CSA. That is, the severity of CSA will be related to the use of thought control strategies that, in turn, will be associated with increased PTSD symptomatology in this sample. This specific population (e.g., college students) was chosen because although they are often overlooked due to the belief that they are higher functioning than other CSA survivors, these individuals typically are still quite distressed (Young, Harford, Kinder, & Savell, 2007) . Overall, based on past research (e.g., Reynolds & Wells, 1999; Wells & Davies, 1994) , we predict that worry and punishment strategies will be positively associated with PTSD symptomatology, while distraction, reappraisal and social control will be negatively associated with PTSD symptomatology.",

A power analysis indicated that approximately 38 participants are necessary to find a large effect using an alpha level of .05 with four independent variables, and 84 participants are necessary to find a medium effect (Cohen, 1992) .

In the current study, the instrument asked the women to indicate how often they used each technique to control cognitions associated with the CSA on a Likert scale ranging from 1 to 4 (i.e., never, sometimes, often, almost always). Scores were calculated by separately summing the six items for each scale: distraction (e.g., I occupied myself with work instead), worry (e.g., I focused on different negative thoughts), punishment (e.g., I was angry at myself for having the thought), reappraisal (e.g., I challenged the thought's validity), and social control (e.g., I didn't talk about the thought to anyone; reversed scored). TCQ scores for each scale, therefore, could range from 6 to 24, with higher scores indicating greater use of the strategy. Previous research has exhibited moderately high internal consistency (Coefficient alphas between .64 and .83) for the five thought control subscales (Wells & Davies, 1994) .

For purposes of this study, the women were asked to rate how distressing each IES item was immediately following the CSA on a scale ranging from 0 to 4 (i.e., not at all, a little bit, moderately, quite a bit, extremely). The three subscales within the total score consist of avoidance (8 items; e.g., ''I stayed away from reminders about it''), intrusions (8 items; e.g., ''Other things kept making me think about it''), and hyperarousal (6 items; e.g., ''I was jumpy and easily startled''). The IES is scored by averaging the corresponding items for each subscale and then summing the three subscale scores. The IES total score could thus range from 0 to 12, with higher scores indicating greater PTSD symptomatology. The IES total has exhibited high internal consistency (.96), as well as the avoidance (.87), intrusions (.94), and hyperarousal subscales (.91; Creamer & Failla, 2003) . In the current sample, the Cronbach alpha coefficients were high (total \u00bc .96, avoidance \u00bc .93, intrusions \u00bc .94, hyperarousal \u00bc .90). It is important to note that the mean scores obtained in the current sample are slightly lower than those obtained from research conducted with other trauma populations, such as motor vehicle accident survivors (avoidance \u00bc 1.44, intrusions \u00bc 1.57, hyperarousal \u00bc 1.81; Beck et al., 2008) and survivors of severe acute respiratory syndrome (avoidance \u00bc .93, intrusions \u00bc 1.11, hyperarousal \u00bc 1.04; Wu, Chan, & Ma, 2005) .",

Severity of CSA was entered in the first step of the mediation model and CSA severity and thought control strategies (i.e., worry, punishment, and social control) were entered in the second step (see Table 3 and Fig. 1) . Worry, punishment, and social control thought control strategies were included in the hierarchical regression analyses to examine the unique contribution of each control strategy. Hierarchical regression analyses showed that before the thought control strategies were accounted for, CSA severity significantly predicted IES total (b \u00bc .336, p < .01; Path C 0 ). When the thought control strategies were accounted for, however, the relation between CSA severity and IES total was no longer significant (b \u00bc .073, p \u00bc .40; Path C 1 ), whereas the worry (b \u00bc .408, p < .001), punishment (b \u00bc .298, p < .01) and social control (b \u00bc \u00c0.216, p < .05) thought control strategies did significantly predict IES total (Path B;6R 2 \u00bc .42, p < .001). Therefore, three thought control strategies (i.e., worry, punishment, and social control) mediated the relationship between CSA severity and IES total. Mediation analyses were also conducted using the IES subscales (i.e., avoidance, intrusions, hyperarousal) and results essentially remained unchanged (i.e., worry, punishment, and social control all served as mediators), with the exception that social control mediated avoidance, but not intrusion or hyperarousal.",

Furthermore, social control would appear to be a beneficial strategy since it involves using one's social network, which buffers the effects of stress (Lauterbach, Koch, & Porter, 2007) .

The positive relationship between distraction and reappraisal with trauma symptoms warrants further exploration and discussion as this is inconsistent with some previous findings (Reynolds & Wells, 1999) . One possible explanation for the inconsistent findings is that both distraction and reappraisal strategies could reflect a belief that avoidant strategies are adaptive, which have in fact been shown to be associated with maladjustment following trauma (e.g., Herman-Stahl, Stemmler, & Peterson, 1995) . Further research is needed to clarify the various roles of these thought control strategies.",

Specifically, adult survivors may not accurately remember how they dealt with unwanted thoughts following CSA events. Likewise, this study did not account for the frequency of CSA events or variation of CSA offense characteristics (e.g., victim-perpetrator relationship) and how thought control strategies may have varied with these variables. For example, one may start using a particular thought control strategy if victimized once; however, if victimized more than once a previous strategy may appear ineffectual. In addition, one may use a different strategy for thoughts of CSA perpetrated by an attachment figure (e.g., father) versus a different caregiver (e.g., babysitter). Such nuances in abuse characteristics and associated thought control strategies warrant further research. Finally, this study used a non-clinical sample from a relatively high functioning population (i.e., college students), which may have served to lower IES symptom scores and consequent relationships to coping.

For example, the TCQ worry subscale may appear similar to the IES re-experiencing subscale and failure to use social control may appear similar to IES avoidance. Careful inspection, however, reveals that the TCQ worry construct involves more than re-experiencing the event as it also encompasses an apprehension about things that could happen. Similarly, the use of social control involves a desire to divulge unpleasant thoughts to another person and is thus more specific than avoidance of event reminders. Also, this potential confound cannot be the sole explanation for the current findings because the TCQ factors also correlate with IES symptom domains other than their supposed equivalent (see Table 2 ). For example, TCQ worry is correlated with IES avoidance and hyperarousal as well as intrusions, suggesting that the coping construct reflects a process that occurs beyond specific related symptomatology.",
