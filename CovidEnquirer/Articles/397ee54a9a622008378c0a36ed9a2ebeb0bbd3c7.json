Subsequently, a pre-dated case was reported in China, in a 24-year-old member of the military based in Beijing in November 2003. 25 Human cases of A/H5N1 in increasing number have since been reported from countries across the world with the majority of cases in Indonesia and Thailand. Almost all such cases have been attributed to direct exposure to infected birds, although limited, unsustained person-to-person spread cannot be excluded in a few cases in Indonesia and Thailand. 26, 27 All confirmed cases are reported on the website of the World Health Organization [http://www.who.int/ csr/disease/avian_influenza/en/]. These features mean the world is in World Health Organization (WHO) Pandemic Alert Phase 3: human infection(s) with a new subtype, but no person-toperson spread, or at most rare instances of spread to a close contact. Progression to Phases 4 and 5 will be triggered by small and then larger clusters of human cases, with limited and localised personto-person spread. Phase 5 indicates a substantial pandemic risk and is followed by Phase 6 when there is \"increased and sustained transmission of a pandemic virus in the general population\". 28 Countries across the world are preparing for cases of A/H5N1 in poultry or wild birds, human cases of A/H5N1 and for the next pandemic (whatever the eventual subtype). The over-arching UK pandemic contingency plan has been developed by the Department of Health, based upon the global WHO plan. 28 It describes the UK strategy of considering a broad range of measures: antivirals (of which the UK has now acquired 14.6 million treatment courses); non-pharmaceutical interventions such as hand washing; voluntary isolation of cases; effective handling of contacts; and limiting non-essential travel and mass gatherings of people to minimise the impact of the pandemic while a vaccine is developed against the pandemic virus. 29 The UK pandemic contingency plan (available at http://www.dh.gov.uk) is supplemented by many other plans specific to other organisations and government departments, such as the Health Protection Agency (available on the HPA website at http://www.hpa.org.uk), and by specific guidelines for care settings. Guidance is also being developed for non-medical care settings, such as schools, local authority domiciliary services, prisons, the emergency services and care homes. These pieces of guidance and others are considered as 'living documents' to be reviewed and updated as the situation develops and as knowledge and understanding about the threat posed by A/H5N1 advances.",

The World Health Organisation also has a stock of oseltamivir available to use to try to contain the first outbreaks of human pandemic influenza at the source, likely to be in Southeast Asia. 30 Neuraminidase inhibitors inhibit viral replication, in particular the release of newly formed virions from an infected host cell, therefore they must be taken as early as possible following infection, certainly within the first 48 hours of becoming infected, in order to be effective.",

Although this has had varied success in the past, recent modelling work indicates that while school closure during the peak of a pandemic might reduce clinical peak attack rates in children by up to 40% and slow the epidemic spread to some degree, it has little impact on overall attack rates across other age groups. 30 Even with school closure it is important to ensure that children do not then meet in informal networks outside of school, thereby negating any positive effect.",
