All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.bmcl.2011.03.034 www.chembridge.com). All compounds were filtered to remove unsuitable components that would not reach and pass clinical trials due to undesired and toxic properties. The three dimensional atomic coordinates of the compounds included in the docking library were generated by the Corina program (Molecular Networks GmbH, Erlangen, Germany). AutoDock version 3.0.5 was used for the computational molecular docking simulation of flexible small molecules to rigid proteins with ligand and rigid proteins. 16 Large scale computations were conducted between 2ZU5 and 308 307 compounds using the KISTI grid infrastructure. 17 In the first Postdocking filtering strategy based on the free binding energy of the lowest energy conformation, 1468 top ranked compounds having a free binding energy ranging from \u00c014.0 to \u00c017.09 kcal mol \u00c01 were selected. To further narrow drug candidate selection, the Chimera software 1.4.1 program (University of California, San Francisco) 18 was used to identify potential H-bonds between residues in the active site pocket of 3CL pro . Selected compounds were analyzed for their hydrophobic and H-bond interactions using the LIGPLOT program. 19 Among 1468 compounds, 22 compounds (1.5% of the top scoring compounds) exhibited no potential hydrogen bond (H-bond) interactions and 381 compounds (25.95% of the top scoring compounds) showed weak H-bond interactions with amino acid residues in the active site pocket of 3CL pro . According to their free binding energy and H-bond interactions with key residues, 214 compounds were selected and classified into 35 groups by library MCS 0.7 (ChemAxon, San Francisco, CA, USA). Fifty-three compounds were selected from the 35 main clusters for in vitro inhibitory activity against 3CL pro . The compounds provided by the vendor were each >90% pure and were used without further treatment. The gene encoding 3CL pro from SARS-CoV polyprotein (amino acid residues 3241-3546, GenBank accession no. AY274119) was constructed by a custom gene synthesis service (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ, USA). The 3CL pro enzyme was expressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3) and purified using a Ni-Sepharose resin (GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). The K m value of 3CL pro calculated from the double reciprocal Lineweaver-Burk plot by fluorogenic peptide Dabcyl-KTSAVLQSGFRKME-Edans using a SpectraMax Gemini XPS apparatus (Molecular Devices, Eugene, OR, USA) with excitation and fluorescence emission wavelengths of 355 and 538 nm, respectively. Each compound from VS was tested in duplicate at a concentration of 100 lM for its ability to inhibit 3CL pro activity. Seven compounds showed optimal inhibition 3CL pro at 100 lM (Table 1 ). The chemical structure of each compound is depicted in Figure 1 , with physicochemical and chemical names of each compound is supplied in the Supplementary data. The seven compounds displayed 3CL pro inhibitory activities with IC 50 values ranging between 38.57 \u00b1 2.41 and 101.38 \u00b1 3.27 lM (Table 1) . These compounds can be considered as a new inhibitor scaffold for further development by structure activity relationship or de novo design studies. Compounds 6 and 7, which were similar in structure and which displayed more than 60% inhibition activity at 100 lM, were subjected to kinetic characterization. To elucidate the inhibitory mechanism of both compounds, inhibition kinetic experiments were performed at different constant inhibitor con centrations (0-60 lM) and different substrate concentrations. For analysis of the modes of inhibition of these compounds, both Lineweaver-Burk and Dixon plots were used. A K i value was calculated from the Dixon plots using the SIGMAPLOT program (SPSS, San Diego, CA, USA). Both compounds were competitive inhibitors. The inhibition of 3CL pro by compound 7 is illustrated in Figure 2 . The Lineweaver-Burk plot of 1/v versus 1/[S] resulted in a family of straight lines with the same y-axis intercept reflecting competitive inhibition toward 3CL pro ( Fig. 2A) . This activity suggests that compound 7 potently impairs the catalytic activity of 3CL pro by binding in the enzyme's catalytic site. The K i value of compounds 6 and 7 were determined to be 9.11 \u00b1 1.61 and 9.93 \u00b1 0.44 lM, respectively, from the common x-axis intercept of lines on the corresponding Dixon plot (Fig. 2B ). Compound 7 was analyzed by molecular docking as a potent binder to the active site pocket of 3CL pro (Fig. 3A) . The predicted free binding energy between compound 7 and 3CL pro is shown in Table 1 . Figure distance 3.23 \u00c5 and another one with the N atom of the main chain of Cys145 with a distance 3.23 \u00c5. Viewing the H-bond between compound 7 and the amino acid residues in the active site of 3CL pro revealed that compound 7 bound to the S1 site (the substrate binding pocket) of SARS-CoV through H-bonds with Phe140, Gly143, Cy145, and Glu166. S1 of SARS-CoV 3CL pro confers absolute specificity for the Gln-P1 substrate residue. 20 The nitrophenyl group of compound 7 is very likely crucial in the 3CL pro inhibition activity, given its H-bond formation with Cys145 and Gly143, as well as hydrophobic interactions with His41, Cys145 and Cys145. Hence, one of the catalytic dyad residues of 3CL pro is vital for the binding of compound 7 to 3CL pro . In summary, VS of 308,307 compounds was done to identify novel 3CL pro inhibitors. Fifty-three compounds were tested for their inhibitory activity towards 3CL pro expressed from E. coli. The IC 50 of seven especially potent compounds ranged from 38.57 \u00b1 2.41 to 101.38 \u00b1 3.27 lM, and two of these compounds (6 and 7) were competitive inhibitors of 3CL pro with K i values of 9.11 \u00b1 1.61 and 9.93 \u00b1 0.44 lM. Detailed docking simulation binding mode analyses showed that the inhibitors could be stabilized by the formation of H-bonds with catalytic residues and the establishment of hydrophobic contacts at the opposite regions of the active site. More detailed inhibition kinetics and molecular modeling studies are underway to elucidate the inhibitory mechanism of compounds 6 and 7.",
