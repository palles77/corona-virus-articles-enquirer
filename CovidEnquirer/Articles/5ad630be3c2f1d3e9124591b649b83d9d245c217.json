Large, commercial service airports often have enough on-airport personnel, with the expertise and equipment to handle most or all of the core functions, at least for the initial response phase. Small, commercial service airports may have to rely heavily on off-airport personnel, through the use of Memorandums of Understanding (MOUs), and with their own personnel assuming multiple duties. Many Airport Operations and maintenance personnel at small airports are trained in Aircraft Rescue and Firefighting (ARFF), and some in Basic Medical Care or as Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs).",

First, it must be recognized that not all emergency situations can be anticipated. Joseph Pfeifer, Chief of Counterterrorism and Emergency Preparedness, Fire Department of New York (FDNY), notes that by its very nature, a crisis is often random, unexpected, and novel, requiring leaders to be prepared for a wide variety of urgent circumstances that demand quick decisions (Pfeifer, 2013, p. 2) .",

Pfeifer classifies three types of extreme events: routine, crisis, and catastrophe. Routine emergencies use a single Incident Commander (IC) and have hierarchical command and control. One person is in charge and gives orders. In a crisis, which requires a multiagency response, the hierarchal structure divides into several leaders, each overseeing their own network, reporting to a central IC. If the incident becomes catastrophic, a formation of random networks haphazardly connected with no one central leader controlling the entire incident may form (Pfeifer, 2013, p. 9) . It is important for both first responders and policy makers to understand that there will be an element of randomness and that not every situation can be controlled at all times.",

For long-duration incidents, personnel will have to rotate in and out of the command structure and will require relief, refreshment, and rest. help them better acclimate to the aviation structure, as airports bounce back and forth between IC on-scene and IC in the EOC structures. Airports have been known to use a blended structure, with the IC on-scene, and an EOC commander in the EOC. To avoid confusion, the EOC commander should be designated as a Deputy IC.",

Incident Command is established by the first responder on-scene until relieved by either a superior officer from the first responder's own organization or the first responding entity that has responsibility over the incident according to the line of succession. For example, Airport Operations officers are commonly first on-scene for an aircraft incident as they are typically in the airfield conducting their continuous self-inspections and other airfield related duties. Upon arrival at the incident scene, the Airport Operations officer will assume Incident Command and broadcast such over the airport's communication system. Regardless of the experience level of the first arriving officer or individual in the line of succession, that individual is in command until properly relieved. If the line of succession said that the first in command is airport fire, followed by airport police, then either the firefighting agency or the police department will take over Incident Command from the Airport Operations officer upon their arrival.",

If an Airport Operations officer does not have firefighting responsibilities, training, or equipment, then their command function is to establish themselves as the IC (for now), set up an Incident Command Post, and ensure responding agencies are notified to the location of the incident and advised on accessible routes, if possible. The IC then ensures overall scene safety and security to the extent possible. Additionally, in some instances, such as an active shooter, any unarmed individual, including Airport Operations personnel, are usually advised to avoid the area entirely, to run away, or seek shelter, if necessary, until the shooter is neutralized. As additional units arrive, the Airport Operations person may retain IC duties, or IC duties may switch to then-appropriate personnel, based on the incident type, such as having ARFF personnel as Incident Command for an airplane crash, whereas airport police would serve as initial Incident Command for a sabotage, hijack, or bomb threat incident.",

During an incident, Airport Operations personnel should assume that noise levels will be higher than normal, both on the airfield and in the terminal building; there may be areas on the airport where radios or cell phone coverage is sporadic or nonexistent; and during the emergency, communications equipment will be used for longer than the usual number of hours, resulting in the need for additional backup equipment and a ready supply of batteries.

The emergency communications system explains how personnel are notified of an airplane or airport emergency, along with daily testing requirements of alarm equipment. Most notifications of an airplane emergency come first to the air traffic control tower (ATCT), which then activates a crash phone or similar alert system, to notify airport fire and operations personnel (Figure 11.1) . However, the ATCT is not always aware an Aircraft Accident has occurred, and other situations necessitate a callout of fire, police, and other response personnel, so the notification system must address when an agency other than the ATCT becomes aware of an incident and how each agency will activate the crash alarm or emergency response process. Usually this is a call to Airport Operations, which can then activate the crash phone or alert system. According to the NFPA (2013), the following agencies should be immediately notified by alarm of an aircraft emergency: airport ARFF, airport police, medical service providers, and the airport operator. Additional agencies should be notified via telephone, or automated notification system, as needed.",

Evacuations are usually somewhat orderly, following established evacuation routes with the assistance of airport personnel. Recovery from an evacuation is also rather orderly, compared to recovery from an active shooter escape. During an active shooter incident, there is no evacuation plan per se, as the primary goal is to escape from the line-of-fire as quickly and effectively as possible. During the Los Angeles International Airport active shooter event on November 1, 2013, thousands of passengers and airport employees streamed onto the ramp through fire alarm access doors as fast as possible. Recovery from such an escape will usually take much longer than recovery from a standard evacuation because of a pending storm as individuals do not follow established evacuation routes and are literally running for their lives. It is unreasonable to think people will follow standard evacuation protocols with someone shooting at them, so airport management should be less concerned with the methods of escape and focus on shutting down aircraft operations, notifying individuals who may be in harm's way that they need to run for cover or safety, and locating and neutralizing the shooter.

During some airport emergencies, local police and sheriff personnel have been known to access an airport by either driving through a gate or fence (knocking it down) and proceeding across aircraft movement areas without clearance, to respond to wherever they see smoke or perceive the incident to be (see Figure 11 .4). These situations can cause runway incursions and potential collisions with aircraft. Offsite responders should be provided grid maps and simple instructions on where to respond at the airport and the importance of waiting for an escort to the incident site. Training with offsite responders is a way to reduce these safety incidents but still retain the benefit of police presence during an emergency.",

Airport police are the first line of response and should know the procedures for securing the area in the event of a bomb threat, how to handle a bomb threat on an aircraft, and the procedures for handling a potentially hijacked aircraft that is on the airport or inbound to the airport. An important note: the TSA's Federal Security Director (FSD) has the authority to assume Incident Command for any security incident at an airport, but the FSD typically does not have any available armed response forces. TSA Transportation Security Officers and Transportation Security Inspectors are unarmed and are not trained in law enforcement response procedures. An ARFF truck responds during an emergency exercise at Centennial Airport, CO.

However, large-incident logistical and financial support is often more easily coordinated from the EOC, rather than on-scene, and clear lines-ofconnection are drawn between the functions of the EOC and the on-scene Incident Command. Organizing around ICS has five levels: Command, Operations, Planning, Logistics, and Finance/ Administration. Important to remember is that the EOC command function is not the IC. Confusion can exist when organizing an EOC around ICS. The IC or Unified Command are on-scene command structures, whereas the EOC command function is more of a policy group that makes decisions and establishes the overall strategy of the response (FEMA, 2008a). The operations function coordinates with on-scene operations responders, which includes police, fire, Airport Operations, Airport Maintenance, and EMS personnel. The planning function serves the same purpose as it does at the incident scene, gathering and analyzing information, keeping decision makers informed, and tracking resources, along with developing Incident Action Plans (IAPs). IAPs set forth specific goals and objectives to be obtained within a set timeframe. IAPs can derive from the Command function/group, which sets the strategic objectives. The planning function/group breaks down the strategic vision into measurable goals and then considers the operational challenges and the overall situation at hand to develop the IAP. Ideally, the Operations function/group then works toward achieving the goals and objectives of the IAP. The logistics function fundamentally serves as the grocery store for the incident, as these individuals have the purchasing authority, along with lists of the necessary resources and the authority to acquire them. The finance/administration function coordinates financial management processes for the incident, tracks personnel hours worked, including hours worked by off-airport responders (for potential reimbursement later), and, if an attorney is present, provides legal advice. In some cases, the on-scene Incident Command may retain certain roles at the incident site, while pushing other responsibilities, such as finance/administration, logistics, and planning, to their EOC counterparts.",

While most airport emergencies do not require the MCU to operate independently for long periods of time, during a natural disaster, the airport may still be expected to maintain some level of minimal functionality, in which case an MCU can fulfill some of an airport's operational and communications requirements, until water, electricity, and other necessary resources can be restored.",

In the initial response phase, efforts are allocated to thoroughly understanding the situation (i.e., gaining situational awareness). During the initial response, an Incident Briefing Form (ICS 201) is used to document the incident name and time it started, along with a map or overview sketch and known resources available to the IC (and estimated time of arrival [ETA] if relevant). ICS 201 also contains a summary of current actions to date and other information relevant to the incident. The next phase in Planning P is to establish the incident objectives, through a meeting by the IC, command staff, and the General Staff (e.g., operations, planning, logistics, and administration section leaders). Once mission objectives are determined, the OSC reviews with the General Staff the tactics (i.e., tactical direction) the OSC is proposing to meet the response objectives in the established timeline and to makes resource allocations.

Also, in the beginning of an incident, information often comes to the IC piecemeal, and the initial information is not always as accurate as information that comes later, once the incident has matured. 2. Advisories and Warnings tell the public about a concern, along with specific action steps the public should take. Advisories and warnings are time-sensitive, and accuracy is important. These messages may also contain technical information, but should still be written using language most of the audience understands, minimizing acronyms and jargon. Examples of advisory or warning messages may be, \"the airport is closed until further notice, call your airline to determine the status of your flight,\" \"all traffic should avoid the frontage road north of the airport as it is reserved for emergency response equipment at this time,\" or \"individuals are prohibited from operating drones 10 over the incident site, and citizens failing to obey, may be subject to arrest . . .\" 3. Action Messages prompt the public to take immediate action, with timeliness and accuracy possibly being a matter of life and death. Action messages require an all-out media blitz during which local TV and radio broadcasts are interrupted, reverse 911 systems are used, and public warning systems, such as tornado sirens, are activated.

The ability of paramedics to triage, treat, and transport is similarly evaluated and improved by skills and drills. However, the ability of EMS providers to perform their critical tasks in a coordinated and wellcommunicated manner as they transition from collecting evacuees from an aircraft on fire to receiving those rescued from the postfire control rescue efforts is an objective of a FSE. To put it simply, if you don't know how to put on your costume and don't know your lines, you're not ready for the show. What should be measured is how are all of those operations coordinated by the EOC, in support of Continuity of Operations, and is everything communicated in a consistent and effective manner.",

            "text": "While PIOs are in the business of passing information along to the public, two areas of information must be protected from public disclosure. Operational Security, aka OPSEC, includes Sensitive Security Information and information about procedures; deployment of police, FBI, or other law enforcement assets during a security incident; discussions about tactics; videos of certain weapons or law enforcement surveillance tools; and tactical deployments that must be kept from public disclosure. Again, social media, UAVs, and citizen journalists may identify such information on their own, but airports should have policies restricting their own personnel from releasing such information via any method. Numerous cases of a family friend posting about the death of a friend or a loved one in Iraq or Afghanistan before the deceased family was formally notified have occurred.Also, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPPA) addresses the privacy of an individual's health status and prohibits it from being publicly disclosed. Only certain personnel, such as law enforcement or clergy, will typically make a death notification; hospitals and health care professionals are required to adhere to HIPPA and can transmit information about the health status of an individual only under certain circumstances. The airport operator should not issue statements about the names and conditions of victims unless first cleared by medical professionals, the NTSB, or an other authorized entity. Furthermore, airlines are obligated to protect the identities of their passengers and crew and will likely not provide passenger manifests to the EOC. 11 However, while police, fire, and Airport Operations will not be provided the passenger manifest, the American Red Cross works with the air carriers and the health and hospitals section leader to coordinate the status and location of victims and others involved in the incident.",

Every agency should have its own Public Information process and personnel, and a key goal during the incident is to coordinate public communication efforts and not point the finger of blame at other agencies. Also, the public messaging should not interfere with the response and recovery operations, but should seek to enhance such operations.The Joint Information System (JIS) is an organized, integrated, and coordinated mechanism to ensure the delivery of understandable, timely, accurate, and consistent information to the public, across multiple jurisdictions, during a crisis. The key elements of JIS are interagency coordination, gathering, verifying, coordinating, and disseminating consistent messages, providing information to decision makers, and staying flexible and adaptable to the situation (FEMA, 2008a) . A JIC is a location that facilitates the JIS. It is where PIOs from various agencies meet and perform PIO functions, across jurisdictions, private sector agencies (such as the airlines), and NGOs (Walsh et al., 2012, p. 3086) . A single JIC is preferable, but multiple JICs may be necessary to provide the adaptability and necessary coverage for the event or incident. While JIC personnel gather and coordinate information, the ultimate authority for releasing information rests with the IC/Unified Command.",
