The stomach, the small intestine and colon are affected and malabsorption results in nutrient deficiency. Enterocyte damage, the primary lesion in southern Indian tropical sprue, is the result of a persistent lesion of the stem cell compartment. This lesion occurs on a background of tropical enteropathy and the available evidence suggests that an immunity conferring agent may be responsible for initiating the damage.",

This clinical descriution of patients with chronic diarrhoea caused by <'the failure of the digestive fire properly to burn ingested food\" is probably the earliest account of tropical sprue and highlights the fact that this syndrome affects indigenous populations in tropical countries (BAKER & MATHAN, 1971) . Tropical sprue became important because it was a major cause of morbidity and mortality in expatriates from temperate zones in several tropical colonies. Unfortunately the wide prevalence of this syndrome in indigenous populations was not appreciated and as late as the 1960s tropical sprue was considered mainly a disease of expatriates from temperate zones.",

            "text": "The initial studies supported by the Wellcome Trust at Vellore showed that almost all non-pregnant adults with megaloblastic anaemia, in southern India, had malabsorption syndromes (BAKER, 1957 (BAKER, , 1958 . The detection of an epidemic of tropical sprue in 1961, and the demonstration that the small intestine in healthy southern Indians was, both structurally and functionally, different from that in apparently healthy residents in-industrialized countri&- (BAKER et al, 1962; MATHAN & BAKER. 1971; BAKER & MATHAN, 1972) , led to the detailed studies during the last three decades which are reviewed in this paper. The \"normal\" background The surface architecture of jejunal mucosal biopsies, from healthy southern Indian controls, showed broad leaf-&/or tongue-shaped structures and long ridges often thrown into a convoluted pattern, but no finger-like villi (BAKER et al., 1962) . This morphological alteration was an acquired defect, since the foetal intestinal epithelium in India was the same as in temperate climates (CHACKO et al., 1969) . The architectural change was accompanied by increased thickness of crypts, increased infiltration of the lamina propria and the epithelium by mononuclear cells, and scattered degenerated enterocytes (?viiWHAN, M. et al., 1975a) . Similar morphological changes develop in laboratory animals (BAKER et al., 1963) and it was shown that exclusion of a segment of bowel from ltial continuity prevented the occurrence of the lesion or even reversed existing changes (CHACKO et al., 1968) . Increased loss of functional enterocytes with accelerated cell turnover was responsible for these changes (IMATHAN, V. I. et al., 1982) . The morphological abnormalities were associated with minor abnormalities of intestinal absorption, nearly half of the apparently healthy adults havmg malabsorption of d-xylose, 10% mild steatorrhoea and about 3% vitamin B12 malabsorption (BAKER & MATHAN, 1972) . These morphological and functional changes in the small intestine in health have been designated tropical enteropathy and are likely to be an adaptation to the intestial luminal environment . Tropical enteropathy has been described from several tropical developing countries (BAKER, 1973) , but not from Singapore, which, although in the hot tropics, has environmental characteristics similar to the industrialized countries, with good nutrition, sanitation and water supply and a low incidence of acute diarrhoea. Among these environmental factors a consistent finding in southern India has been the isolation of bacte&l enteric pathogens from the faeces of asymptomatic, apparently healthy individuals of all age groups (RAJAN & MATHAN, 1982; MATHAN, V. I. & RATAN. 1986 ). In addition. the lumen of the small inte&e as well as the mucosa is heavily colonized by both aerobic and anaerobic organisms- (BHAT et al:, 1972 (BHAT et al:, , 1980 . The prevalence of enterovirus and parasite infections is also high in this population PATEL et al.. 1984 PATEL et al.. . 1985 .

In addition to endemic cases, epidemics of tropical sprue occur. During the second world war, in Assam and Burma, epidemics of tropical sprue were a major cause of repatriation of troops to UK. The Madras public health service also reported several epidemics with chronic diarrhoea. Of the 40 epidemics of diarrhoea studied during the last 26 years at Vellore, 7 were epidemics of tropical sprue, with patients developing malabsorption very early in the course of the illness and many patients continuing to have diarrhoea for periods longer than a month (BAKER & MATHAN, 1970; , 1970 , 1971 MATHAN, V. I. et al., 1966) . The epidemiological characteristics of epidemics of tropical sprue were distinctly different from those of epidemics of acute diarrhoea in this population. The attack rate was higher in adults than in children and the index case was usually an older person. The epidemic evolved over several months and new cases continued to appear for a year or more. The median case-to-case interval in families, during the first wave of the epidemic, was more than a month and secondary cases were usually younger people. Environmental or dietary factors could not be identified in the aetiology. Detailed bacteriological and parasitological studies and conventional virological studies failed to identify any aetiological agent. When villages affected by epidemics of tropical sprue were followed up for several years, secondary waves of the epidemic occurred, 5-6 years after the initial wave. In two such instances the attack rate for svmntomatic illness was significantly higher in children, b&n after the first wave of the eoidemic. than in adults livine in the village at the time of the 'mitial wave, suggeshg that the agent which. caused the epidemic had conferred some immunity.'",

The absorption of a variety of other nutrients, such as folate, iron, vitamin A, proteins and carbohydrates is also abnormal. Jejunal mucosal biopsies, careful radiological examination with small intestinal follow through, immunoglobulin estimation and quantitation of the luminal bacterial flora are among the investigations necessary to exclude secondary malabsorption. Commonly encountered conditions which give rise to secondary malabsorption in southern India include diffuse intestinal lymphoma, hypo-or agammaglobulinaemia with nodular lymphoid hypoplasia, the stagnant bowel syndrome (including intestinal tuberculosis), parasitic diseases and non-specific ulcerative colitis. These conditions account for less than 5% of all patients who have presented to this unit with a history of chronic diarrhoea and malabsorption. Abdominal tuberculosis with diffuse small bowel ulceration or multiple strictures and the stagnant bowel syndrome are particularly difficult to diagnose differentially. In the last 26 years the diagnosis of abdominal tuberculosis with malabsorption was confirmed in only about 40 patients, while over 2000 patients with tropical sprue. were seen.",
