Utilizing the human immunoglobulin transgenic mouse, XenoMouse\u00ae, we produced fully human SARS-CoV spike (S) protein specific antibodies. Antibodies were examined for reactivity against a recombinant S1 protein, to which 200 antibodies reacted. Twenty-seven antibodies neutralized 200TCID 50 SARS-CoV (Urbani). Additionally, 57 neutralizing antibodies were found that are likely specific to S2. Mapping of the binding region was achieved with several S1 recombinant proteins. Most S1 reactive neutralizing mAbs bound to the RBD, aa 318-510. However, two S1 specific mAbs reacted with a domain upstream of the RBD between aa 12 and 261. Immunoglobulin gene sequence analyses suggested at least 8 different binding specificities. Unique human mAbs could be used as a cocktail that would simultaneously target several neutralizing epitopes and prevent emergence of escape mutants.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoV) historically are known to cause relatively mild upper respiratory tract infections, and account for approximately 30% of the cases of the common cold in humans (Baker, 2004) . However, a recently identified CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), causes severe respiratory distress in humans leading to mortality in approximately 10% of infected individuals (Baker, 2004; Rota et al., 2003, www. who.int/csr/sars/). In the year 2003, SARS-CoV established efficient human to human transmission resulting in several super-spreading events. By the end of the outbreak in July of 2003, SARS-CoV was responsible for 774 deaths and 8096 cases worldwide involving 29 countries (www. who.int/csr/sars/). Since the conclusion of the SARS outbreak, several reports in 2004 of confirmed cases of SARS of unknown origin indicate that the environmental threat of SARS-CoV still exists (www.who.int, The Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004) . SARS-CoV-like virus can be isolated from horseshoe bats in China, and researchers postulate that this is the natural reservoir for the virus (Lau et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005b) . SARS-CoV-like virus remains present in intermediate wild animal hosts, such as the Himalayan palm civet, raising the possibility of re-emergence of SARS-CoV infection in humans (Chan et al., 2006; Peiris and Yuen, 2004) . Because of the lingering threat, it is prudent to develop effective modalities of pre-and post-exposure treatments against SARS-CoV infection.",

In humans, SARS-CoV peak viral load is reached approximately about 10 days post onset of symptoms, thus offering an opportunity for effective post-exposure treatment (Chen et al., 2005 (Chen et al., , 2006 . One modality of treatment that may limit virus replication and thus the spread of the virus is passive immunization with pre-formed neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). Such a treatment during the prodromal phase of the disease could aid in rapid clearance of virus and limit poor clinical outcome and person to person spread, without the adverse effects associated with use of corticosteroids, animal sera or human sera.",

SARS-CoV S protein is a type one transmembrane glycoprotein divided into two functional domains S1 (aa 15-680) and S2 (aa 681-1255) (He et al., 2004; Li et al., 2005a) . The S1 domain mediates the interaction of the S protein with its cellular receptor, angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Li et al., 2003) . A region of S1 consisting of 193 amino acids forms the receptor binding domain (RBD) which is responsible for ACE2 binding . More recently, a receptor binding motif (RBM) within the RBD, consisting of 70 amino acids, has been shown to directly contact the tip of ACE2 (Li et al., 2005a) . The S2 domain of the S protein contributes to infection of the target cell by mediating fusion of viral and host membranes through a conformational change in which two conserved helical regions (HR1 and HR2) of the S protein are brought together to form a six-helix bundle fusion core (He et al., 2005a; Huang et al., 2002; Ingallinella et al., 2004; Tripet et al., 2004) . Therapies that can disrupt interactions of these domains with the virus receptor will likely confer protection and be of therapeutic value.",

Intranasal or intramuscular application of a modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) expressing S protein into mice elicits SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies (Bisht et al., 2004) . Immunization of mice with a DNA vaccine encoding the S sequence, devoid of the cytoplasmic domain and/or the transmembrane domain, results in the development of neutralizing antibodies as well as both CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses . However, it is the humoral (IgG) component of immunity and not the cellular component that inhibits viral replication . In fact, transfer of immune serum from immunized mice to naive mice reduces SARS-CoV titers following viral challenge . Together, these studies demonstrate that primarily Abs are responsible for protection against SARS-CoV replication, and indicate the potential therapeutic value of passive transfer of neutralizing Abs against SARS-CoV. The immunogenic property of the S protein, including its ability to induce neutralizing antibodies and its essential role in viral attachment and fusion, make it an ideal target for developing effective immunotherapy against SARS-CoV infection.",

There are several ways to produce human mAbs; the method used here takes advantage of the transgenic XenoMouse\u00ae (Amgen British Columbia, Inc, Burnaby, BC). In the XenoMouse\u00ae, the mouse immunoglobulin (Ig) genes are replaced with genes encoding human Igs. Unlike using human B cells from infected or immunized individuals, these animals allow repeated immunization with the antigen of choice to induce B cells capable of producing a wide array of functionally relevant mAbs with high affinities against the antigen without further antibody engineering (Rathanaswami et al., 2005) . This approach is highly flexible and allows extensive screening to select for different antibodies with unique properties. Furthermore, human mAbs can be directly produced from the hybridomas or the Ig genes can be cloned and used to generate recombinant cell lines, if necessary. Because of these advantages, we used the XenoMouse\u00ae to produce a large panel of neutralizing human mAbs against SARS-CoV S protein with distinct specificities.",

Following purification, the reactivity of mAbs was retested against the 318-510 fragment or 12-510, for those that failed to bind to 318-510. The high ELISA reactivity to the relevant S1-IgG fragments noted in the initial screening was maintained after the purification of the mAbs (Fig. 3) . Most mAbs demonstrated a dose dependent binding in which OD values decreased with increasing dilution of the antibody. Other mAbs, such as 6B5 and 3H12, maintained high OD values possibly indicating a relatively higher affinity; however, the overall binding was somewhat lower than the other mAbs at the higher concentrations, possibly reflective of the availability of the epitope (Fig. 3) .",

Some mAbs neutralized SARS-CoV at concentrations as low as 0.195 \u03bcg/ml. However, some mAbs were not able to neutralize virus below a concentration of 12.5 \u03bcg/ml (Table 3 ). This variance in neutralizing ability between mAbs may be due to differences in affinities, fine binding specificities and/or the extent of availability of the targeted epitope on virally expressed native S protein. Often, the degree of reactivity in ELISA did not correlate with the neutralization titer ( Fig. 3 and Table 3 ). This suggested the possible limited availability of relevant epitopes in the virally expressed native S protein relative to their availability in a particular recombinant S1-Ig fragment, thus limiting neutralizing ability of certain mAbs.",

Sequence analysis suggested that there were at least 8 different binding specificities among the panel of mAbs. Unique binding specificities were deduced from the usage of different V, J and D gene sequences, in the case of the heavy chain (H chain). There was preferential usage of A30 and JK4 rearrangement in the light chain (L chain); 14 of the 19 mAbs used this rearrangement for the L chain. The A30 V region was used 2 more times paired with different J segments. There was less repetition in the H chain rearrangements, though there was preferential usage of VH1-2, D3-10, JH4B rearrangement in the H chain, which is used 8 times, all with the A30 JK4 rearranged L chain. The next most frequent H chain rearrangement was VH1-18, D1-26, JH4B, all these also paired with the A30, JK4 rearrangement of the L chain. In addition, there were several more unique rearrangements on the H chain, usually paired with unique rearrangements of the L chain (Table 3 ). This analysis allowed the groups established earlier by ELISA reactivity to be further subdivided based on the assumption that the different gene rearrangements constitute the production of a unique binding site. Therefore, for example, Group 1B was divided into likely 4 different specificities based on different V(D)J usage in the H and L chains ( Table 3 ). The first group, 1B1, has the V1-18, D1-26, JH4B H chain rearrangement paired with the A30, JK4 L chain and though the group 1B2 also uses the A30, JK4 rearrangement on the L chain, the H chain rearrangement was different, VH1-2, D3-10, JH4B; this likely results in the recognition of a different epitope between groups 1B1 and 1B2 (Table 3 ). The remaining members of the 1B group, 1B3 and 1B4, had unique H and L chain rearrangements and so likely recognize their own unique epitopes (Table 3 ). The differences in H chain and L chain rearrangements are important because they influence the structure of the CDR3 region which confers binding specificity.",

The mAb 6B1 has a single amino acid change in the CDR2 region when compared to 3C7; again this change may alter the affinity of 6B1 for the binding region within the S protein resulting in slightly better neutralizing ability noted with 6B1 (Fig. 4) . In addition, several mAbs have changes in one or more of the four framework regions making up the structure of the mAb (data not shown). Though the CDR regions form the antigen binding pocket, changes within the framework region can also contribute to binding specificity and affinity. Therefore, these changes could result in a greater separation of the mAb groups based on CDR regions and result in different specificity for S protein or binding affinity for the same region. For example, 5D6 belongs to the 1B1 group; however, 5D6 carries a mutation in the framework 3 region, which could potentially alter the recognition of S protein by this mAb and therefore set it apart from the other members of the same group. Monoclonal Abs 6B1 and 3C7 both belong to group 1B4; however, 3C7 has a single amino acid change in framework region 3 which may influence binding specificity and affinity, and therefore, influence neutralizing capability (data not shown).",

            "text": "The Ig sequence analysis indicated that there was a preferential usage of certain H and L chain genes namely, V1-2 D3-10, JH4B and A30 JK4. There were several mAbs that reacted with the S1 fragment but exhibited considerable diversity in their H and L chain gene segment usage. This suggested that these mAbs possibly recognized distinct epitopes within a given domain. A majority of the neutralizing mAbs that bound to 318-510 fell into groups 1A and 1B and exhibited a similar S1 fragment binding pattern. However, the Ig sequence data suggest that there could be up to 5 different binding specificities within these two groups. For example, group 1B, whose likely binding region is 318-510, could be divided into 4 different binding specificities based on different V(D)J rearrangements that yield unique CDR3 regions. In addition, variations seen within the CDR3 sequences of mAbs with common Ig gene usage, such as those seen between groups 1A1 and 1B2, suggested that these mAbs may bind to different epitopes or bind the RBD epitope with varying affinity. Based upon the Ig sequence analysis, we speculate that at least 8 different binding specificities may be represented in our panel of mAbs; when considering mutations found in CDR1, CDR2 and framework regions, this could increase the number of different S1 specificities. The contribution of framework regions to Ab binding is illustrated in the generation of a chimeric antibody to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) or TNF-\u03b1. When the CDR regions of neutralizing murine mAbs were transferred to the Table 3 Summary of HmAbs reactivity, neutralizing titer and heavy (H) and light (L) chain usage HmAb Group a Reactivity S1-IgG (12-672, 12-510, 261-672, 318-510) framework regions of human IgG1, the resulting chimeric mAbs lost their representative neutralizing abilities (Tempest et al., 1991 (Tempest et al., , 1994 . Therefore, the potential for changes that we saw in the CDR and framework regions of our SARS S1 specific mAbs may result in differences in binding specificity or affinity; however, detailed epitope mapping is required to fully characterize the fine binding specificity each of the mAbs. In addition to antibodies that bind to the RBD, we isolated other neutralizing mAbs (groups 2A and 2B) that can interact with epitopes contained within amino acids 12-261, upstream of the RBD. The presence of these neutralizing epitopes demonstrates an important, yet unclearly defined role of this region in SARS-CoV infection. Since this region has not been implicated in binding of ACE2, these mAbs may prevent S protein from acquiring the conformation required for mediating fusion with the target membrane. Deletions within the first 300 aa of S1 eliminate fusion ability of S protein in a cell-to-cell fusion assay while maintaining receptor binding function (Xiao et al., 2004) . The N-terminal region of S protein also seems to play a role in the trimerization of S protein, a structure that may be required for fusion (Xiao et al., 2004) . Therefore, binding of mAb to this region may interfere with important steps that facilitate fusion. Further functional characterization of these mAbs could yield information on the function of this region of SARS-CoV S protein in viral entry.",

These Abs likely react at the junction between S1 and S2, within the S2 domain, or recognize important conformational epitopes that require the entire S protein. Since the S2 domain is involved in fusion of the viral and cellular membranes, antibodies specific for regions within the S2 domain likely neutralize by inhibiting fusion. Such antibodies will be of value to more carefully study the fusion events. Moreover, the S2 domain is more highly conserved than the S1 domain, and therefore S2 region reactive mAbs can be combined with mAbs with distinct S1 binding specificities that can prevent viral attachment to create a mixture of antibodies with a broader range of specificity to more effectively prevent infection by a wide range of clinical isolates (Rota et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2004) .

In fact sequence analysis indicates that the clinical isolates could be divided into early, middle and late isolates (Sui et al., 2005) . The significance of this is demonstrated in the ability of later isolates to escape neutralization by a mAb that effectively neutralized an earlier isolate (Yang et al., 2005) . Therefore, it is important to produce neutralizing mAbs that are effective against a wide range of clinical isolates with antigenic diversity. Because of the potential evolution of antigenic variants, an effective passive therapy against SARS-CoV will likely contain a cocktail of neutralizing mAbs that target different epitopes and/or steps in the entry process, such as blocking receptor binding and fusion. We believe that several of our mAbs can be used to prepare such a cocktail for potential therapeutic use. In addition, identifying neutralizing epitopes conserved over a range of clinical isolates has significant implications for developing a more effective vaccine largely devoid of non-neutralizing epitopes (Traggiai et al., 2004) .",

Neutralizing ability of the Abs in hybridoma supernatants was tested by mixing 50 \u03bcl of hybridoma supernatant, diluted 1:2 in 50 \u03bcl of OptiPro SFM (Gibco, Carlsband, CA) with 200TCID 50 of virus in 100 \u03bcl of medium for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. Following incubation, 100 \u03bcl of the antibody/virus mixture was added in duplicate to Vero cells and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 3 days. At this time, cells were visually observed for cytopathic effect (CPE; indicated by rounding of Vero cells) as an indicator of SARS-CoV infection. The same assay was performed using 1:4 serial dilutions of purified human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs).",
