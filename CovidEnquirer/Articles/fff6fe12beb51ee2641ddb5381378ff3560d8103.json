We show that exogenous health shocks could facilitate the adoption of these behaviors and provide long-lasting effects on health outcomes. Specifically, we exploit the spatial and temporal variation of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic in Mexico and show that areas with a higher incidence of H1N1 experienced larger reductions in diarrhea-related cases among young children. These reductions continue even three years after the shock ended. Health improvements and evidence of information seeking via Google searches were consistent with changes in hand washing behaviors. Several robustness checks validate our findings and mechanism.",

For example, regular physical activity reduces the risk of diabetes; condoms help reduce the spread of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV; reductions in cigarette consumption help avoid pulmonary cancer; and hand washing with soap prevents gastrointestinal diseases. However, despite their effectiveness, the take up rates of these products or behaviors is very low (Dupas, 2011) . For instance, while the role of hand washing as an effective way to reduce gastrointestinal diseases has been known for more than a century (Koplik, 1902) , 2 in developing countries, only 30% of household members wash their hands before preparing food or after defecation. In some countries the rate is as low as zero (World Bank, 2005; Chase and Do, 2010) . Moreover, intensive small-scale interventions show significant reductions in diarrhea (e.g., Ejemot-Nwadiaro et al., 2008; Luby et al., 2004; Luby et al., 2005) , 3 but scaling up similar inter-2 For example, Koplik (1902) summarizes the research of the previous decade and recommends the \"scrupulously\" cleaning of hands and nails (\"with brush and file\") after changing a diaper for nurses handling a newborn. Mothers, he added, \"should carefully cleanse their hands before feeding the baby\" (p. 321). The rationale for this hygiene practice was also well understood \"since this way contamination of the infant's food with fecal bacteria is avoided\" (p. 46). 3 Common interventions to reduce diarrhea have focused on providing infrastructure or information. Infrastructure projects focus on providing safe water supplies and sanitation (e.g., Pattanayak et al., 2009; Kremer et al., 2011) , micronutrients or vaccinations (Dowling and Yap 2014 . Information-based interventions focus on hygiene education and community-led total sanitation (CLTS) (Dowling and Yap 2014 . Also, recent papers have discussed the external validity of these studies. See Hammer and Spears (2016) for a discussion on whether the sites where village sanitation projects take place might be likely to exhibit large effects.",

Rather, the emphasis seems to be on when information alters the decision-making process (Luoto and Carman 2014) . Our paper contributes to this literature by showing that health shocks such as disease outbreaks can operate as \"natural nudges\" that facilitate changes in health behaviors that lead to improvements in health outcomes, and that these types of shock-induced improvements can have long-lasting effects.",

This provides an important context to test theoretical models of health behavior where a decision to engage in preventive behavior is triggered only when the (contagious) disease crosses a high threshold (e.g., Philipson 2000) .

This influenza virus can survive on environmental surfaces such as kitchen counters and door knobs for up to eight hours. H1N1 shares many of the symptoms of the seasonal flu: fever, cough, aches.

As of June 2011, Mexico's Ministry of Health reported that there were more than 70,000 confirmed cases of swine flu in 2009, including more than one thousand deaths and around 2400 hospitalizations. Most of the confirmed H1N1 cases in Mexico involved a relatively younger cohort, aged 10-39, compared to the population typically affected by the seasonal influenza. The incidence of these cases was highest in May, June, and September of 2009 (Appendix Fig. 1 in Supplementary material). All states in Mexico were affected by the swine flu outbreak, but there was variation in the distribution of cases across states (Fig. 1, Panel A) . This distribution does not coincide with the spatial pattern observed for diarrhea cases prior to 2009 (Panel B of Fig. 1 ). The announcement of the first case of H1N1 on April 23, 2009, was followed by a series of other actions coordinated by the Mexican government, including the Ministry of Health, and other national and international organizations. These actions included enactment of the National Pandemic Preparedness and Response Plan which coordinated and implemented risk communication strategies to promote respiratory hygiene and to maintain the public informed about the transmission of influenza. TV and radio ads, a dedicated hot line, alert text messaging, and social media messaging were launched on April 25. The goal of the campaign was to educate the public about frequent and proper hand washing techniques, covering sneezes or coughs, using face masks and hand sanitizers, seeking care if ill, and discouraging self-medication. The Ministry of Health and the Office of the President coordinated with media outlets to provide daily updates on the number of confirmed cases, which was reflected on substantial coverage on the number of confirmed cases in each state as well as key messaging on how to prevent transmission.",

For the purpose of this study we use data for the 2006-2012 period and we aggregate the discharges at the year and state level to match the source of the time and spatial variation in the H1N1 data. 7 Common to many developing countries, the public hospital system covers most of the population and in the case of Mexico, 85 percent of all hospital visits are covered by these hospitals. 8 This large coverage strengthens the external validity of our findings. 9 A key advantage of this dataset is that the coding for the primary diagnosis of the discharge follows the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 10th Revision or ICD-10, created by the World Health Organization (WHO, 2010) , where the treating physician determines the diagnosis. Relying on the report of a trained professional represents a significant improvement in the literature as it helps reduce the recall bias and other measurement errors that plague self-reported data obtained from household surveys (Heady 2016) and improves the accuracy of the diagnosis. The coding included in the database comes from the actual diagnosis regardless of the initial reason that led the patient to the hospital. 10 Furthermore, the use of hospital discharge data implies that we are focusing on the extreme and treated cases of diarrhea (i.e., those severe enough that resulted in a hospital visit and even death) as opposed to those cases that were either treated at local health centers, at home or went untreated.",

The details of the codes are presented in Appendix Table 2 in Supplementary material. In Mexico, diarrheal cases in children under five represent 51 percent of all hospital discharges where the primary diagnosis was diarrhea. 11 For this reason and following the literature of early childhood development we restrict our analysis mainly to this age group. 12 The hospital discharge data are complemented with morbidity information collected in the Anuarios de Morbilidad 13 (Annual Morbidity Statistics). The Anuario is a yearly report produced by the Mexican Health System that collects information from all the public and private health centers nationwide to create an Epidemiological Surveillance Bulletin for the National System of Epidemiological Surveillance or SINAVE, similar to the CDC's National Notifiable Dis-7 Data covering some public hospitals are available from 2002. Data for all public hospitals are available beginning 2004, but we do not incorporate it into this analysis because the age variable was not consistently coded for that year. For 2005, we do not have information of the limited rollout of the rotavirus vaccination campaign and therefore restrict the sample to 2006 onwards when the rotavirus program was nationally implemented. 8 This dataset does not record month of admission. This variable is only included in a dataset that, unfortunately, has a heavily restricted coverage (<50% of the national discharges) and does not represent a random sample of all discharges. These limitations prevent us from using the month-recording dataset in our main analysis. 9 Mexico's Ministry of Health reports that in 2009 there were 91.6 million users of the public hospital system. However, the report does not indicate whether the reported 91.6 million users included repeat users. (Sistema Nacional de Informaci\u00f3n en Salud (SINAIS).

It is defined as, \"The diagnosed condition at the end of the event that led to the primary cause of treatment for the patient. . .if there is more than one (condition), the one that is considered to be responsible for the most use of resources must be selected. If no diagnosis is made, the primary diagnosis is the main symptom, abnormal finding or problem\" (SSA, 2010a, p.78). 11 There were 5.8 million hospital discharges in Mexico in 2011 with a rate of 456.3 discharges per 10,000 population and 129,000 cases were related to diarrhea. 12 Older children (5-14) represent 15 percent of all the hospital discharges diagnosed as diarrhea while people 45 and older constitute 20 percent of the cases. 13 Available at http://www.epidemiologia.salud.gob.mx/anuario/html/anuarios. html eases Surveillance System in the United States. The Anuarios de Morbilidad concentrates on the leading causes of morbidity rather than collecting all possible diseases. It includes ambulatory and physician office visits. This facilitates a weekly report of the incidence of selected diseases, where acute respiratory infections as well as gastrointestinal diseases have been consistently covered in the data throughout the period of analysis. As in the case of the hospital discharge data, diagnoses recorded in the Anuarios de Morbilidad follow the ICD-10 classification and have been determined by a medical professional. In addition, there is a quality assurance process that includes a multi-layer system of checks until the data are released to the public months after the end of the calendar year.

The swine flu cases included in the dataset have been confirmed by a laboratory as true cases of the H1N1 (SSA, 2010b). In an effort to improve and standardize influenza surveillance, the Ministry of Health required all Mexican medical institutions to confirm suspected cases of the H1N1 with laboratory tests \u2212a practice that continues to this day (SSA, 2010b (SSA, , 2013 (SSA, , 2014 . This heavily limits the possibility of misclassification with other diseases that could share symptoms with the swine flu. 15 Additional data on health expenditures by the government (state and Federal), distribution of oral rehydration salts, distribution of vaccines, and hospital infrastructure as measured by the number of hospital beds come from Mexico's Ministry of Health SINAIS (National System of Health Information) data system. 16 We utilized two other data sources. Child mortality due to diarrhea is obtained from Mexico's Vital Statistics. This dataset has 100 percent coverage and includes deaths that occur at home and in hospitals. 17 Also, we use Google Trends data as they provide an index that captures the popularity of a given Internet search across time and states. There is a growing number of papers using data from Google searches (available as Google Trends: http:// www.google.com/trends/) to uncover economic issues. For example, these data have been used to predict economic indicators in the United States and Germany (Choi and Varian, 2012; Askitas and Zimmermann, 2009; D'Amuri and Marcucci, 2010) as well as discrimination and voting behavior (Stephens-Davidowitz, 2014) . 18 In our case, we are interested in searches of the Spanish word for hand sanitizers: \"gel\" or \"gel antibacterial.\" We downloaded the information in pairs of states keeping constant the state with the highest value of searches between 2008 and 2009 because Google Trends only releases it as index. In that way, our data provide the 14 Multiple symptoms can be associated with the swine flu. The top two symptoms associated with potential cases of the swine flu were cough (90 percent) and fever (86 percent), with diarrhea, nausea or votiming being present in 13 percent of the cases (SSA, 2011) . 15 An alternative to laboratory-confirmed cases could be the use of the actual number of people infected with H1N1. However, this number is unknown, as infections do not always create influenza-like symptoms and different approaches are used to compute estimates for the aggregate number of infections (Shrestha et al., 2011) . 16 We also explored data on news coverage from a targeted search for H1N1related articles during the period 2006-2012 in LexisNexis that included 14 major newspapers with national coverage in Mexico. However, there is no spatial variation in this variable and cannot be used in the analysis. 17 Mathers et al. (2005) classify Mexico's mortality records as of the highest quality globally, with 100% coverage, extensive usage of ICD codes and with only 5% illdefined codes. The United States has the same numbers except that it has 7% of ill-defined codes. Germany's record for this measure is 14%. 18 Google even has a site dedicated to predict the incidence of the seasonal flu based on the results from a paper published in Nature (Ginsberg et al., 2009 ). same base, where the highest (lowest) volume is set to 100 (zero). 19 Note that the index is a measure of \"relative popularity\" and so it already takes into account the size of the search volume in each state and period. Table 1 presents summary statistics of the key variables used in our analysis for periods 2006-2008, 2009, and 2010-2012 . The last column of Table 1 shows the p-values of the difference in means between the pre-2009 and post-2009 periods. Given that H1N1 did not exist prior to 2009, the total number of confirmed cases of H1N1 is only available from 2009 onwards. Diarrhea-related hospitalizations for children under the age of 5 were lower in the post-2009, compared to the pre-2009 period, and the difference is statistically significant (p-value = 0.000). On the other hand, federal expenditures in health were higher in post-2009 than pre-2008 (pvalue = 0.020). Except for these two variables, the test of difference in means suggests there is no difference between the pre-2009 and post-2009 periods as captured by most key variables.",

We also investigate other treatment and baseline periods, which are discussed in Section 4.3. We use H1N1 counts rather than rates because we believe that part of the mechanism through which individuals' perceptions changed was rooted in the perceived magnitude of the problem as reported on news media channels. The news media reported the total number of cases that had been confirmed at the national level as well as the states where the highest number of cases had been confirmed. 20 Thus, \u2424 is our parameter of interest as it captures the differencein-difference impact. Robust standard errors clustered at 32 states with a correction with a correction for small clusters are used and are complemented with p-values computed using a wild bootstrap method (Cameron et al., 2008) . Eq. (1) includes controls for year and state fixed effects ( t and s , respectively). The year fixed effects allow us to control for nationwide trends in diarrheal diseases while the state fixed effects account for time-invariant unobserved characteristics during the period of analysis at the state level (e.g., culture, geography, institutional settings).",

Thus, if the H1N1 pandemic induced changes in hygiene behavior, we would expect to observe a larger decline in the incidence of diarrheal dis- eases in states where the swine flu was more prevalent. In other words, we would expect \u2424 to be negative and statistically significant. In the next section, we show the results of estimating Eq. (1) with the data described above. Table 2 presents the results from running the specification described in Eq. (1) for 2009 and 2008, with state and year fixed effects . As shown in Panel A, column 1, our estimate for effect of the 2009 H1N1 on diarrhea cases for children under five is negative, \u22120.105, and statistically significant at the five percent level, marginally, using the wild-bootstrap p-values (0.060). That is, there were fewer hospital discharges related to diarrhea in states with more swine flu cases, even after controlling for time and state fixedeffects. This coefficient implies that for every 1000 cases of the swine flu, there were 105 fewer cases of diarrhea in children under five. Given the average number of diarrhea-related hospitalizations for this group (1117 in the period 2008-2009), the estimated association indicates that for every 1000 cases of the swine flu we observe a 9.4 percent decline in diarrhea-related hospitalizations (-0.105*1000/1117). That is, 3404 cases of H1N1 (or 4.9 percent of all confirmed cases) would have the same effect in the reduction of diarrhea (32 percent) as the estimated average effect from the costly interventions reviewed by Ejemot-Nwadiaro et al.

For example, with the arrival of the H1N1, cases that should have been identified as diarrhea (belonging to ICD codes A00-A09X) could have been incorrectly classified as swine flu. After all, up to 13 percent of the diarrhea swine flu cases exhibited vomit, nausea or diarrhea as an additional symptom. We argue that this misclassification is an unlikely event for the following reasons. First, as explained in the data section above, the H1N1 cases used in our study were confirmed cases using laboratory tests. So even if some of them included a diarrhea symptom, these cases were coded as J09 in our data because a strain of the novel type of influenza was found in these patients. Second, the recorded disease is made by a trained medical professional. So if parents suspect their children have H1N1, when the actually have diarrhea, what is recorded is the actual assessment of the physician and not what the patient (or his parents) suspected. 21 Third, we expect medical professionals to be less likely to misdiagnose a diarrhea case not only because of their medical training but because Mexico has identified intestinal infections as a public health issue based on the magnitude and prevalence of the disease (with at least 11% of children under five being affected by this problem each year). These professionals are also more likely to be aware of the population at risk for different diseases. As shown in Fig. 2 , which presents the age distribution of these two diseases for hospitalizations, 22 the H1N1 affected disproportionally school-going children and adults while diarrhea affects primarily children under 5. This difference further reduces the possibility of misclassification.",

However, when we run our main specification for other age groups and not just for children under five, we do not find evidence suggesting there is a mechanical misclassification of diarrhea to H1N1 (Table 3 ). The parameter for the H1N1 is negative and statistically significant for those under five (column 2). However, it is positive, small and not statistically different from zero for all other age groups (columns 1, 3-5), including older patients who are the second most at-risk age group of diarrhea (as shown in Fig. 2, Panel B) .

In Table 4 we include cases of conjunc-21 It is worth noticing that the official guidelines sent by the Mexican government to parents and schools rarely include diarrhea as one the key symptoms to identify a possible H1N1 case. See SSA (2009b) (4) and (5) tivitis (ICD-10 codes B30 and H10) for children under 5 (column 2). This outcome comes from the morbidity dataset obtained from the Anuarios de Morbilidad. We find a negative association between H1N1 and conjunctivitis cases. However, conjunctivitis affects only a fraction of children under five compared to diarrhea. In 2008, for instance, there were 1.5 million cases of diarrhea nationwide but only 89,103 cases of conjunctivitis. This could explain the lack of statistical significance for this estimate. When we add hepatitis A (ICD-10 code B15, also from the Anuarios de Morbilidad) and conjunctivitis together as a new outcome we continue to observe a negative association with H1N1, alas unable to reject the null hypothesis (results available upon request). Again, this could be explained by the few cases of hepatitis A among this age group (only 4348 in 2008) relative to the diarrhea cases. We think this evidence, although not as strong as desired, adds to the support that the negative, robust and statistically significant effect of H1N1 on diarrhea is less likely to come from a mechanical classification problem. Finally, we take advantage of the fact that diarrhea cases are classified in different ICD codes depending on the cause or disease etiology, where for most cases the cause of diarrhea is not known. If during the H1N1 outbreak doctors misclassified diarrhea cases, these cases are more likely to come from those where the cause is unknown (ICD-10 code A09X) and much less so, if at all, from those where the cause is known (ICD-10 codes A00-A08) (see Appendix Table 2 in Supplementary material for details about specific ICD-10 codes). In Table 4 we test for this hypothesis by using the ratio between known cases of diarrhea and the unknown sources as our outcome variable. Misclassification implies that more cases of H1N1 will be positively associated with this ratio: the denominator (the unknown sources) decreases but not the numerator. Our estimates strongly reject this prediction of misclassification.",

We provided evidence against this possibility earlier as we showed that the effects are also observed among morbidity cases, beyond hospitalizations. We explore this using hospital discharges associated with hip-related procedures for all age groups, and hospital discharges (excluding H1N1) for children under five. Hip-related procedures try to capture hospital visits that could be delayed. If these procedures were negatively related to the H1N1, we would find evidence that adults were avoiding hospitals. In column 3 of Table 4 we identify a null result. Similarly, if we observe a statistically significant decline in all types of hospitalizations for children, it would also suggest that parents were not taking their children hospitals. A null result for this outcome is presented in column 4 of Table 4 . If anything, in both cases we find a (very small) positive parameter that is not statistically significant. Thus, we can rule out the possibility that our findings come from people avoiding hospitals during the swine flu pandemic. 26 In column 3 of Table 4 Panel B, we show the results of the analysis where mortality due to diarrhea is the outcome measure. The estimated coefficient is 0.0003 and is not statistically significant, implying that there is no change in overall child mortality due to diarrhea in areas with more cases of the swine flu. This is important as we can rule out deaths from diarrhea happening at home, rather than at hospitals, for areas of high H1N1 prevalence. 27",

We start by exploring production and consumption patterns of hygiene products. Mexican manufacturing data indicate that between 2008 and 2009, there was a 6.4 percentage point increase in production of soaps, cleaners and cosmetics; compared to a 2.3 percentage point increase from 2003 to 2007. 29 In addition to the changes in production of soaps there is other evidence that suggests changes in hand washing behavior might have occurred during the pandemic. A survey conducted in Mexico City and two states with varying prevalence of the swine flu showed that the top three mitigation efforts adopted to protect against the H1N1 virus included frequent washing of hands with soap, use of a mask, and hand sanitizer (Aburto et al., 2010) . 30 We reproduce these findings in Appendix Table 5 in Supplementary material. This table also shows that people in states 27 We also conducted additional tests to examine alternative functional specifications. These analyses suggest that the linear specification with counts appears to be the preferred specification for our paper (see Appendix Tables 3 and 4 in Supplementary material). 28 Recent papers on infectious diseases are exploring the role of viral interference; a process where individuals infected with the swine flu could become immune to other viruses (e.g., Gr\u00f6ndahl et al., 2014; \u00c5nestad and Nordb\u00f8 2011; Casalegno et al., 2010) . See also Wrammert et al. (2011) for related possibilities. Whether the H1N1 served as an \"antibody\" for the viruses causing diarrhea (e.g., rotavirus) goes beyond the scope of this paper. 29 These numbers underestimated purchases as imports of hand sanitizers are not included. Furthermore, these data are not available at the state level. 30 Although we are uncertain about the methodology, others have indicated that a survey conducted by Nielsen showed that the top two adopted measures by consumers in Mexico during the swine flu outbreak were: 1) the use of face masks, and 2) hand washing with soap and water or hand sanitizers. Nielsen also reported an increase in sales of soaps and hand sanitizers. http://economia.terra.cl/noticias/ noticia.aspx?idNoticia=200906171913 TRM 78156849, accessed on November 24, 2013, and www.cnnexpansion.com/get content.php?q = print&url = mi-dinero/ 2009/06/17/autoservicios-ganan-con-la-influenza, accessed June 11, 2013.",

Prior to week 15 (early April) there are few searches for the expression \"hand sanitizer\" (gel or gel antibacterial in Spanish). However, at the beginning of the swine flu outbreak in early April we observe a spike in the number of searches of more than five times relative to first weeks of the year. The post-outbreak trend remained at a level that was higher than the pre-outbreak period. We further expand this analysis in Panel B of Fig. 4 32 We test whether this demand for knowledge is a possible mechanism by including it as an outcome in Eq. (1). We do this by constructing a panel dataset from searches by the state and year. In columns 6 and 7 of Table 5 , we find a positive and large relationship between the incidence of H1N1 and Google searches. The results of column 6 indicate that 1000 cases of the H1N1 are associated with an increase of 3.2 units in Google searches for hand sanitizers and it is statistically different from zero at the 10% level using bootstrapped standard errors. This represents a substantial increase (42 percent) with respect to average value during the period of analysis (mean = 7.63). Note that due to low search volume there are no data for eight states, 33 so in column 7 we ran our regression for Google searches replacing the missing values with zeroes (the lowest possible value in the Google Trends index) for those eight states. This way, we are able to utilize the full dataset. This imputation leads to similar findings \u2212more Google searches in areas with a higher incidence of the H1N1-and it allows us to gain precision for the estimates by \"recovering\" those missing values (p-value 31 Similar behavioral changes were reported during an outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or SARS. See Leung et al. (2004) for details. Also, there was a spike of purchases for hand sanitizers in the United States during the swine flu in 2009 (see Appendix Fig. 3 in Supplementary material). Furthermore, some research indicates that the H1N1 pandemic led to an increase in hand washing behavior in the US (e.g., Jones and Salathe 2009; Rubin et al., 2009 ) making our mechanism even more plausible. 32 Similar patterns \u2212a spike around week 19 and higher searches relative to the pre-outbreak period-can be observed for Google searches of the word \"cubrebocas\" or face masks (not shown but available upon request). Also, when dividing the sample of states by high and low levels of H1N1, we find that the spike happens in both types of states at around the same time (figure not shown but available upon request). 33 These states are, in alphabetical order, Baja California Sur, Campeche, Colima, Chihuahua, Durango, Nayarit, Tlaxcala, and Zacatecas. (6) and (7) captures the intensity of search volume per state and year, which ranges from 0 to 100. The dependent variable in columns (1)-(5) is the log of the outcome of interest. Columns (1) and (2) denote the log of millions of expenditures in Mexican pesos. b p-value denotes the p-value of wild bootstrapped standard errors for each specification to correct for small number (32) of clusters. c In columns (6) the specifications exclude the states of Baja California Sur, Campeche, Colima, Chihuahua, Durango, Nayarit, Tlaxcala, and Zacatecas for which Google data were missing. In column (7) we assigned a value of zero to states with missing Google searches. < 0.10). These analyses indicate that the main mechanism arises from the demand for knowledge regarding hygiene practices and not so much from the other channels examined above.",

We obtained these data from Mexico's SINAVE for years prior to the H1N1 pandemic (2006) (2007) (2008) . This variable represents morbidity cases of the seasonal flu. While both the swine and the seasonal flu could be considered as health shocks, the latter did not exhibit the unexpected magnitude and the uncertain nature of the H1N1 pandemic. Thus we can test whether small, expected health shocks (the seasonal flu) have similar effects to larger and unexpected health shocks (the swine flu). Analogous to Eq. (2), is the parameter of interest and as before, we control for state ( s ) and time ( t ) fixed effects. We also include state-specific trends ( st ). The results of estimating this equation are presented in column 7 of Table 2 . Unlike the H1N1, there is no link between cases of the seasonal flu and diarrhea cases. Each case of the seasonal flu is associated with 0.003 additional cases of diarrhea but this parameter is not statistically different from zero. The spread of the seasonal flu does not have an effect on diarrhea as the 2009 H1N1 does. This evidence suggests that small and expected health shocks like the seasonal flu do not matter. Large and unexpected shocks like the 2009 H1N1 pandemic do. This evidence is consistent with theoretical models reviewed by Philipson (2000) .",

While other interventions have been able to show the contemporaneous effect of information campaigns on reduction in diarrhea cases (see for examples the 14 papers reviewed by Ejemot-Nwadiaro et al.

For every case of the 2009 H1N1 we observe 0.221 fewer cases of diarrhea, even after controlling for contemporaneous cases of H1N1 (p-value = 0.024). Furthermore, note that the contemporaneous effect of H1N1 is now positive (but not statistically significant based on the bootstrapped p-value). This positive sign is not surprising in the absence of behavioral change since 13 percent of the swine flu cases were associated with diarrhea as one of the symptoms. This reinforces our hypothesis that it is the actual health shock of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic that triggered the behavioral change.",

(3) with four interaction terms of this variable with binary indicators for each year in the period 2009-2012. This allows us to evaluate the contemporaneous impact of each year separately. Likewise, if the contemporaneous effect exists only in 2009 and disappears with future H1N1 cases this would be evidence of a nudge: people adjusted their behavior in the presence of a new shock. The shock allowed them to reach an equilibrium behavior in the sense that future shocks no longer change their hygiene practices. Now consider a situation where the first nudge changed behavior, but it did not lead to an optimal solution. In this case, there is still \"room for improvement\" and further \"reminders\" are needed to foster improvements in the production of health outcomes. In this case, it seems possible that further nudges could have larger, or smaller, effects than the first nudge depending on the degree of dynamic complementarities between nudges in periods 1 and 2. 35 The results are presented in columns 3 and 4 of Table 6 . Column 3 indicates that the effect is negative in both 2009 and 2010 but with larger effects for the latter. The results, however, disappear with the 2012 H1N1. These findings suggest that further reminders help reducing diarrhea cases but for a limited time. Most importantly, in column 4, and analogous to column 2, when accounting for the persistence effect of the 2009 pandemic, we find that the contemporaneous effects become substantially less relevant \u2212much smaller in magnitude and no longer statistically different from zero-but the 2009 effect remains. These results suggest that as a health shock, the 2009 H1N1 pandemic had a contemporaneous and a long-lasting effect in the reduction of diarrhea cases of young children.",

            "text": "These findings expand our knowledge of health economics in several ways. First, as reviewed by Cawley and Ruhm (2012) , previous studies emphasizing the role of health behaviors as key inputs 35 When the H1N1 impacts become larger for all periods after 2009 an alternative explanation could come from structural changes in the health system or mass vaccinations. However, we do not observe such pattern in the post-2009 analysis. Furthermore, we have already ruled out vaccinations as a possible mechanism in section 5.1. We thank an anonymous referee for this insight. in the production of health outcomes have focused on chronic rather than infectious diseases and on advanced economies instead of developing countries. In that regard, by focusing on gastrointestinal infections in Mexico, our study expands our knowledge of the role of behavioral changes in a much less investigated setting and addresses an important gap in the literature. Second, the fact that the 2009 pandemic matters for behavioral change, compared to the null effect found from the smaller (and more predictable) seasonal flu, provides empirical support for theoretical models where a decision to engage in preventive behavior is triggered only when the (contagious) disease crosses a threshold (e.g., Philipson 2000) . Furthermore, our paper complements recent advances in behavioral economics by exploring how health shocks, such as pandemics, can act as \"natural nudges\" that affect the production of health outcomes and generate long-lasting effects. Our findings raise several issues regarding policy implications. First, we show that business-as-usual strategies, such as overall government health expenditures, vaccinations campaigns as well changes in infrastructure (e.g., hospital beds) are unlikely to be behind the reasons for the decline in diarrhea cases. 36 During major health emergencies, such as pandemics, individuals increase their demand for knowledge about ways to remain healthy (e.g. learning about better hygiene practice increases). If governments facilitate access to low cost information sources, such as search engines, (or hot lines, TV or radio spots), especially in areas where the disease is more prevalent, our results indicate that the public will use these resources to acquire information. In that setting, health outbreaks or emergencies could have unanticipated positive effects as long as the population is willing to change behaviors under the appropriate environment, e.g., with adequate information, incentives, and social acceptability.",

Thus, the information to help address their demand does not need to be provided exclusively by the government. During these emergencies, profit-seeking firms could provide a public health service too. This is consistent with the points made by Mathios (1990, 1995) indicating that when producers are allowed to reveal the advantages of their products, firms could provide key information to consumer who then react to this news. For example, producers and sellers of hand sanitizers or other products that improve hygiene practices could complement government efforts by advertising the benefits of their products, especially when government's health budgets are small as in the case of many developing countries. An open research question is whether market friendly policies, such as low entry costs, could complement government efforts during health emergencies by allowing more firms to enter the market and supply the demand for health products that consumers are seeking, as shown by our findings.",

Therefore, the question remains whether it is indeed possible to design information messages that could alter and sustain health behaviors analogous to the effects of the H1N1 pandemic in Mexico, but without the obvious adverse consequences of a health emergency. A possible way to identify these messages could be found in the marketing strategies implemented in another Latin America country, Uruguay, as part of a nationwide antismoking campaign. Harris et al. (2015) find that the inclusion of warning messages in cigarette packages, showing explicit pictograms of newborns affected by smoking during pregnancy, led to a higher smoking cessation for the targeted population of pregnant women. Future research, should explore whether an analogous system of effective messages could be applied to the context of promoting long-lasting and improved hygiene practices.",
