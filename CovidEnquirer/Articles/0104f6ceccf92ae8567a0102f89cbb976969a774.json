A general SARS panic spread over the country when the Taipei Municipal Hoping hospital announced its shutdown as a preventive measure following heavy hospital infection. Further closedown of medical services, including emergency services, appeared sporadically in other hospitals and clinics all over the country. This caused great anxiety among all health care workers. On May 4, 2003, a suspected SARS patient with respiratory failure was brought to the Emergency Service of the Mackay Memorial Hospital in Taipei. The patient was admitted into SARS wards and died 24 hours later. However, during this short period the patient most likely infected 4 health care workers and 5 individuals who were either patients or visiting family members of other patients present at the same time. The hospital set up emergency procedures, and most manpower was put into caring of SARS patients. Taiwan hospitals were facing an unpredictable and invisible enemy for the first time in recent 50 years. The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system is widely used as a strategy in the search for the etiology of infectious diseases and autoimmune disorders. In this study we investigated the HLA-class I and II system for evidence of disease association. It was hoped that the discovery of disease susceptibility or a disease protection phenotype in the Taiwan population would help into setting up a preventive screening program for health care workers at risk.",

On the contrary, the frequency of HLA-B* 4601 in the five severe cases (table 4) was slightly increased when compared to the 28 excluded fever patients (P = 0.007, Pc = ns), but the difference was clearly significant when compared to control A (P = 0.0008, Pc = 0.03).

According to archeological evidences [15] , the populations in the delta of the Hong River in northern Vietnam are also likely related to these populations. After the outbreak of SARS coronavirus infection in the Guangdong Province of China, it was surprising to observe that the spreading of the disease was mostly confined among southern Asian populations (Hong-Kong peoples, Vietnamese, Singaporeans and Taiwanese). Density of populations possibly favored the growth of the epidemic. The question aroused as to whether affected southern Asian populations were more susceptible to SARS infection than peoples of northern China (Beijing), Japan, or Korea. Many peoples in Beijing generally considered as northern Chinese [16] , were also infected, however, infection in Beijing could be attributed to heterogeneity of populations following important recent migration of southern Chinese and population resettlement during the Cultural Revolution.",

Certainly, further independent studies are still needed to confirm this hypothesis. However, Taiwan indigenous peoples have no HLA-B* 4601 and have very low population density. This does not exclude that they may have avoided infection only by chance, even though many indigenous peoples are now urbanized and would have run the same risk as Taiwanese. Southern Asian peoples, not only live in highly densely populated regions, but also have less variation in their HLA related immune repertoires than European or African populations [Variation was inferred here from the heterozygosity (h = 1 -sum of squares of allele frequencies) seen in these populations, and h was obtained and calculated (data not shown) from published data [18] ], which as a whole creates a favorable factor for rapid settling of any epidemic. It becomes evident that authorities must keep a state of disease awareness at all times. Little is known on the routes of infection of SARS coronavirus [19] . In this study, the effect of HLA alleles on the resistance or susceptibility to SARS coronavirus infection was shown to be associated to class I alleles. No association with class II alleles was seen. Quickly establishing a procedure of mass screening for health care workers at risk of exposure to SARS coronavirus by detecting HLA-B* 4601 and possibly HLA-B* 1301 alleles appears justified. The results of such screening would help hospitals to better guard their personals against infection, make the workplace safer, and help to ease the tension and anxiety seen in the hospital environment.",

Between May 5 and 26, 2003, 63 EDTA blood samples from fever patients with respiratory illness were collected in our hospitals. Two earlier specimens from the National Taiwan University Hospital (Taipei) were added to this study.
