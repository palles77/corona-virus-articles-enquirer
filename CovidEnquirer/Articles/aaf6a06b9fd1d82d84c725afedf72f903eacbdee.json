In recent years, China's main focuses for enhancing disaster management have included emergency preparation, emergency management, and legal system mechanisms. However, its well-designed management system faced a great challenge during the Wenchuan earthquake in 2008. By examining the literature on the development of disaster management, we realized that enhancing selforganization in communities can effectively resolve problems caused by collective actions and strengthen resilience to disasters.",

However, literature on the compatibility of social resilience and the government-dominant model in China is still scant. This study investigates China's current disaster management system design; specifically, it identifies ways and methods for counteracting any conflicts between disaster management under social synergies and China's emergency management system. It further explores what factors facilitate the balance between social synergies and the emergency management system if the two concepts were fused together. Using case studies, in-depth interviews, and a focus group in the field of public administration, this study collected qualitative data to understand the changes in China's disaster management system since the Wenchuan earthquake as well as provide recommendations for future reform. However, the above-mentioned plans were challenged by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake, which forced the government to shift efforts to further strengthen emergency management with an \"emergency plan\" and \"emergency management system, construction of mechanism and legal system\" (i.e., three-in-one measurements) (Tong and Zhang, 2012, pp. 23, 28). By the end of 2008, China had established 35 laws, 37 administrative regulations, 55 institutional rules, and 111 documents related to emergency response development (Yu, 2016, pp. 41-42). In October 2016, the National Committee for Disaster Reduction issued China's Disaster Reduction Action Plan during the Twelfth Five-Years, which included four aspects: regulations and institutional mechanisms",

Although the Chinese government wants to be more open to public participation under the traditional administratively oriented system, the level of openness is still deeply influenced by the government system. On one hand, the government wants to open authorization to allow decentralization; however, because of institutional problems, there are still limitations. On the other hand, society also wants to contribute to or expects to expand autonomous governance. However, barriers such as a lack of resources and space have kept them from entering the disaster management network (Wang, 2009; Wang and Chang, 2011) .",

There are 3461 articles on the Wenchuan earthquake alone (Wang et al., 2019) . Since the 1950s, China has endured several major natural disasters, such as the Tangshan earthquake and Yangtze River floods. Knowing how to deal with natural disasters has gradually attracted the government's attention. The United Nations proposed the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction in 1990, which facilitated China's establishment of the National Committee for Disaster Reduction to improve cooperation among different departments and agencies at the state level. Thus, China's first generation of disaster management paid more attention to natural disasters and the role of the government at the state level (Zhang, 2012) .",

            "text": "The one-party political system with an authoritarian regime in China has three main characteristics: it is led by the Communist Party of China (CPC) party, it has a high level of hierarchy, and it has a strong and robust ability to gather resources at higher levels of government (Zhang, 2012) . In recent years, this system has been challenged in terms of its disaster response performance and effectiveness in large-scale disasters. Although some scholars have pointed out the advantages of control and command systems and have considered the system a force for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of disaster response (Gao, 2008; Shan and Chen, 2007) , others have asserted that China's organizational structure and response model should be more flexible to improve disaster management performance (Guo and Kapucu, 2015; Liu and Xiang, 2005) . Comfort (1994) argued that disaster management networks can be understood as self-organizing systems, which is an important corrective action for the assumptions of central planning. With its non-linear and dynamic nature, society can produce a self-organizing process sufficient to reallocate resources and actions so that the crisis is reduced, and society thus continues to operate stably. In other words, self-organization provides a more simple and effective way to deal with complex work than the traditional mechanical view of the organization (Wheatley and Kellner-Rogers, 1996) . Wheatley and Kellner-Rogers (1996) described organizations as being adaptable, flexible, self-renewing, and self-leaning while also having clever features. These characteristics only exist in a living system. Modern organizations have increasingly emphasized complex adaptive systems. A complex environment includes five characteristics: they are composed of many agents who act and interact in unpredictable ways; they are sensitive to changes in the initial state; they adapt their behavior to the environment in an unpredictable way; they swing between stability and instability; and when an imbalance is encountered, they make emergency moves, meaning the complex system is dynamic and non-linear. The concept of emergency self-organization is a complex theory of \"anchor phenomenon\" (Plowman et al., 2007) . Comfort (1994) pointed out that, in a rapidly changing environment, in order to assess the existence of self-organization and its performance in the social system, the concept of self-organization needs to be redefined and explained. First, self-organization is a process in a social context through continuous interaction in a scenario. Through verbal, written, or electronic forms of communication involving two or more participants, these behaviors become the most common ones within the system or between the system and the environment. These actions may also include different forms of communication, such as non-verbal communication or the use of symbols. It indirectly delivers powerful information through examples and actions. Communication behavior includes direct and indirect forms, and these behaviors are the foundation in the process of self-organization. The three elements of self-organization include identity, information, and relationships. Additional characteristics include that the intrinsic driving force in this process of communication is the creative self-expression desire or \"autopoiesis\"; self-organization, along with selections, creates the system's capacity to adapt to environmental conditions; self-organization recognizes that some units exert influence and control over other units in an interdependent system; and self-organizing systems are massively parallel operational systems (Comfort, 1994; Wheatley and Kellner-Rogers, 1996) .",

In a risk-prone society, individuals will take actions and pay attention to their own interests to reduce any individual potential crises (such as the quality of buildings in which they live and the re-planning of illegally constructed areas). However, when it comes to improving collective actions to strengthen the resilience of the community, there are only a few actions, and the discussions on self-organization are effective actions to solve collective problems (Jan 2004) . The significance and importance of self-organization in disaster management has gradually emerged from the previously discussed literature. However, when examining the system in China, it is necessary to understand that the government still plays a critical role in disaster management. In other words, ensuring good interactions between the government and society during disaster management is a key direction that any post-Wenchuan earthquake reforms of the disaster management system should follow.",

In terms of crisis and disaster management, Boin, Comfort, and Demchak (2010, pp. 2-5) pointed out that, for non-routine emergencies, the so-called low-chance, high impact incident has made it difficult for the government to respond using the four stages of traditional disaster management (mitigation/prevention, preparation, response, and recovery). Resilience depends on this social system, the learning of past disasters to achieve better protection in the future, and the degree of self-organization of risk reduction measurements (Jan 2013) .",

However, in some cases, the government is unable to effectively control and deploy sufficient rescue organizations and related resources, resulting in overlapping resources or faults and, thus, weakened disaster relief (Liu et al., 2003) . The interaction between government and non-government actors has become a trend in future disaster prevention and rescue, making it important to understand how to properly use NGOs' resources for disaster management (Huang et al., 2012; Lin, 2013) . In the face of large-scale disasters, the government's disaster prevention capability is far from the threat posed by the disaster itself. Therefore, determining NGOs' role in the traditional government-based disaster management system has become an important issue for public governance. NGOs can play at least eight roles in disaster prevention and rescue: organizers, coordinators, resource integrators, information communicators, supporters, counselors and educators, consultants, and advocates (Zhou and Wang, 2010) .",

However, such mobilization lacks sustainability. Tong and Zhang (2012) demonstrated that, due to China's long-term policy restrictions, the development of Chinese civil organizations still has a long way to go. Although more than 300 civil society organizations were mobilized for disaster relief following the earthquake, with more than 3 million volunteers participating in the action (optimists even consider 2008 as China's first year of civil society), a year later, the number of NGOs still within the disaster-stricken area had likely fallen below 50, with fewer than 50,000 total volunteers. Therefore, through training and management development, NGOs' involvement during emergency and social mobilization mechanisms can be conventionalized.",

Zolli and Healy (2013) pointed out two ways to enhance resilience: enhance its ability to fend off and overcome the limitation during these major damages (even when permanent damage is caused) and maintain (or even expand) survival ability in the ever-changing environment in order to adapt to the new environment healthily, even when pushed to the limits. From economics to ecology, almost all resilience systems have a rigorous feedback mechanism to detect upcoming mutations or critical limitations. For example, in an ecosystem such as the coral reefs, some organisms may change their behavior due to environmental degradation. The same behavior also applies to human society, except that we rely heavily on various tools and techniques to strengthen our alertness to the environment. When sensing information that the system is about to cross its limitation, a system with true resilience uses dynamically reorganized efforts to ensure that the mission is continued, and the scale of operations is maintained. Many systems have built-in counteracting mechanisms that start working once the crisis occurs; the counter-measure mechanism attacks like the human immune system, restoring the system to a normal state. Aldrich (2012) pointed out the importance of social capital for building social resilience in post-disaster recovery, and the cultivation of trust is the key factor in accumulating social capital (Newton, 2001) .",

These functions can be examined in three aspects. First, the ministry accelerates the construction of social forces to participate in the disaster relief platform. For example, in March 2019, the social emergency force participated in the online application system for disaster relief. It was officially put into operation to realize the functions of online registration and reviews of social emergency forces, disaster information releases, rescue applications, and rescue management. Second, the ministry coordinates some policy issues that plague social emergency forces and prevents them from effectively participating in emergency response. For example, in January 2019, the Ministry of Transport and the Ministry of Emergency Management jointly issued the \"Notice on Doing a Good Job in Social Traffic Vehicles for Inter-provincial Disaster Relief and Highway Traffic Protection\" \u300a\u5173\u4e8e\u505a\u597d\u793e\u4f1a\u529b\u91cf\u8f66\u8f86\u8de8\u7701\u62a2\u9669\u6551\u707e\u516c\u8def\u901a\u884c\u670d\u52a1\u4fdd\u969c\u5de5\u4f5c\u7684\u901a\u77e5\u300b to establish a nationwide unified emergency rescue road for free passage and related service guarantee. Third, the ministry improves social organizations' ability to participate in disaster relief. For example, in June 2018, the Ministry of Emergency Management held the first professional training of social forces that participate in disaster relief work; six months later, in December, it launched the first national social emergency strength skill competition.",

Yet disaster coordination governance continued to face challenges from the government, the light society, the inefficient operations of resource integration and emergency management, the insufficient cultivation of specialized teams, and inadequate support measures for social forces and participation (Jin, 2004; Zhou and Liu, 2015) . To this end, the Chinese government has focused on improving the laws and regulations, policy planning, and behavioral norms of social forces participating in disaster relief. Its main content involves the role of market and social forces in disaster prevention, mitigation, and relief. These environmental traits can easily impact the routine operation procedures and decision-making processes of government agencies. In the past, administrative organizations emphasized the development of stability, rationality, and linearity. However, under the advent of the risk society, the concepts of chaos and non-linearity continually impact the thoughts of the traditional public sector. The factors that impact social resilience include trust and social cohesion as well as a sense of community (Enemark, 2006; Poynting, 2006) .
