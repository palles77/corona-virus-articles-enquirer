Clinical records refer to the handling of patient data and include services such as recording, storing, retrieving and communicating SNOMED CT-enabled data in a CIS. Knowledge representation refers to expressing clinical knowledge such as clinical guidelines and care pathways in SNOMED CT. Aggregation and analysis refers to the retrieval of data from CIS for the purpose of secondary analysis. For the purpose of this study, we define implementation as the design, use and maintenance of SNOMED CT in the context of a CIS. ''Design'' refers to compiling subsets, developing data entry interfaces, programming search algorithms, selecting a data storage method, incorporating cross maps and developing data retrieval functions. ''Use'' refers to clinicians interacting with the CIS, receiving training and accepting the system. ''Maintenance'' addresses the continued updating of SNOMED CT-enabled CIS.",

While there are many publications that describe technical aspects of SNOMED CT, compare the content coverage of SNOMED CT to other term sets and report the use of SNOMED CT in research studies [10] , our search for publications describing how SNOMED CT is implemented in clinical settings yielded few results. Implementation publications focused mostly on data capture (e.g., structured data entry templates [11] , clinical documentation [12] [13] [14] , synoptic checklists [15] , questionnaires [16] , indexing clinical notes [17] ) and to a lesser extent data retrieval through the use of synonyms (e.g., clostridium difficile Infections [18] , neuromuscular blockade [19] ) and decision support (e.g., nursing interventions for pressure ulcer wounds [23], detecting adverse drug events [20] ). While there was a fair amount of detail on how SNOMED CT concepts were used in clinical systems, there were fewer details on how those concepts were stored and what methods were used to facilitate retrieval and decision support.",

Third, we discussed together the validity of the questions, combined duplicate questions and after another round of individual prioritisation, pared down the number of questions to 36, spread across 10 sections based on consensus.

One of the reasons for using standardised terminologies is to enable interoperability; however, none of the organisations were communicating SNOMED CT data beyond their enterprise as part of routine operations.

Second, the organisations that have been developing their own SNOMED CT solutions have thus far focused on data entry as opposed to data retrieval and decision support functionality and therefore are unable to demonstrate improvement in areas such as the quality of care.
