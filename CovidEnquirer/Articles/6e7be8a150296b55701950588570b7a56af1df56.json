            "text": "Viral encephalitis is a global health concern. The ability of a virus to modulate the immune response can have a pivotal effect on the course of disease and the fate of the infected host. In this study, we sought to understand the immunological basis for the fatal encephalitis following infection with the murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV)-JHM, in contrast with the more attenuated MHV-A59. Distinct glial cell cytokine and chemokine response patterns were observed within 3 days after infection, became progressively more polarized during the course of infection and with the infiltration of leukocytes. In the brain, MHV-JHM infection induced strong accumulation of IFNh mRNA relative to IFNg mRNA. This trend was reversed in MHV-A59 infection and was accompanied by increased CD8 T cell infiltration into brain compared to MHV-JHM infection. Increased apoptosis appeared to contribute to the diminished presence of CD8 T cells in MHV-JHM-infected brain with the consequence of a lower potential for IFNg production and antiviral activity. MHV-JHM infection also induced sustained mRNA accumulation of the innate immune response products interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1. Furthermore, high levels of macrophage-inflammatory protein (MIP)-1a, MIP-1h, and MIP-2 mRNA were observed at the onset of MHV-JHM infection and correlated with a marked elevation in the number of macrophages in the brain on day 7 compared to MHV-A59 infection. These observations indicate that differences in the severity of viral encephalitis may reflect the differential ability of viruses to stimulate innate immune responses within the CNS and subsequently the character of infiltrating leukocyte populations.

The outcome of viral encephalitis can be considered the result of a competition between the virus and the host immune system. The parameters governing this outcome include the intrinsic virulence of the infecting virus, its tropism, replicative potential, and interactions with the immune system. In addition, the virus infection triggers a host immune response which may be protective or may contribute to the disease process (reviewed in (Noseworthy, 1999; Pavesi et al., 1992) ). Thus, the balance of these factors within the CNS may result in a return to homeostasis, the development of autoimmunity, or the occurrence of fatal encephalitis.",

            "text": "It is now appreciated that glial and neuronal cells are capable of responding to infection by releasing chemokines and cytokines that trigger innate immune responses in the absence of peripheral immune cells (Olson et al., 2001) . Release of type I (IFNa/h) and type II (IFNg) interferons and production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-1 are important early events in response to viral infection (Parra et al., 1997; LeBlanc et al., 1999) . IFNg, in particular, is critical in resolving MHV infection (Marten et al., 2001; Parra et al., 1999; Schijns et al., 1998) . The production of innate immune mediators, such as IL-12, IL-4, and interferons, acts to establish a microenvironment capable of directing adaptive T and B cell responses; whereas, production of RANTES, macrophageinflammatory protein (MIP), and other chemokines acts to recruit T cells and macrophages into the CNS following infection (Lane et al., 1998; Liu and Lane, 2001) . This migration in response to chemokines is reenforced later by the infiltrating leukocytes themselves. These cells can provide protective immunity against CNS infections, as demonstrated by the requirement of cytolytic CD8 T cell activity in the clearance of MHV infections Gombold et al., 1995; Marten et al., 2001) . However, an inappropriate combination of these same factors or timing of their release may result in the initiation of neurologic disease (Olsson, 1995) . Thus, the quality and magnitude of the innate and adaptive responses can influence both the recovery from infection and the development of immunopathology.",

In this study, we sought to understand how viral modulation of early immune responses might influence the outcome of CNS disease following infection with the highly neurovirulent virus, MHV-JHM. MHV-JHM was administered intracranially in the absence of immune manipulation resulting in fatal encephalomyelitis. Chemokine, cytokine, and cellular immune responses in the CNS compartment were documented and compared against mildly neurovirulent MHV-A59 infection. The lack of MHV-JHM clearance was associated with diminished IFNg and CD8 T cell responses. However, the expression of IL-6 and IFNh mRNA was unabated. In contrast, mice infected with MHV-A59 exhibited decreasing accumulation of IL-6 and IFNh mRNA, combined with early and consistent IFNg transcripts that corresponded with the influx of CD8 T cells into the CNS, and control of viral replication by 7 days after infection. Furthermore, MHV-JHM infection was marked by high levels of MIP-1a, MIP-1h, and MIP-2 mRNA correlating with a greater infiltration of macrophages into the brain compared to that observed in MHV-A59-infected animals. The data presented in this report highlight the crucial role that viral induction of early innate immune responses may have in outcome of disease within the CNS.",

MHV-A59 needed to be given at 1000 PFU to induce similar disease scores on day 7 as MHV-JHM at 10 PFU. Therefore, MHV-A59 was also used at 1000 PFU to provide a control that more closely approximated the severity of clinical disease seen in MHV-JHM infection. Examining immune responses from viral infections resulting in similar disease scores increased our confidence that the responses measured following MHV-JHM infection were a function of viral activity and not merely secondary to the more severe clinical disease seen in MHV-JHM infection.",

Mice were injected with MHV-JHM, MHV-A59, or saline (sham). Total RNA was isolated from brains harvested on days 3, 5, and 7 postinjection. With the exception of IL-18 and transforming growth factor (TGF)-h, which were consistently elevated from background even in uninoculated brain (data not shown), saline injections did not induce detectable levels of mRNA message for the cytokines examined (Fig. 2) . Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) (data not shown) and tumor neurosis factor (TNF)-a ( Fig. 2 ) mRNA transcripts were strongly and similarly enhanced in both MHV-JHM and MHV-A59 infections. Otherwise, MHV-JHM infection produced a cytokine mRNA profile distinct from that following MHV-A59 infection. Most striking was the difference in the induction of IFNh and IFNg mRNA levels. IFNh message was induced early in MHV-JHM infection, before the infiltration of peripheral immune cells, and continuously transcribed into day 7, after the arrival of peripheral immune cells (Fig. 2 ). This differed from MHV-A59 infection where moderate IFNh mRNA accumulation evident at day 3 was further reduced by day 7. In contrast to its ability to induce IFNh, IL-12 p40 and IFNg messages were not detected until 5 days after MHV-JHM infection, but were already evident 3 days following MHV-A59 infection (Fig. 2 ). These differences in interferon transcript levels could significantly influence the direct ability to clear MHV, as well as the infiltration of T cells into the brain (Yasuda et al., 1999; Zou et al., 1999) .",

Therefore, mononuclear cells were isolated from infected brains on day 7 and stained to distinguish CD8, CD4, and NK1.1 cells. MHV-JHMinfected brains yielded approximately a 2.5-fold decrease in the percentage of CD8 T cells within the infiltrating cell population as compared to MHV-A59-infected brains.

Thus, the capacity of CD8 T cells to produce IFNg was also examined by intracellular staining. Mononuclear cells isolated from infected brains were stimulated with a control peptide or viral peptides (S510 or S598). Whether other epitopes exist on the MHV-A59 background is currently unknown (Marten et al., 2001) . As previously demonstrated (Castro et al., 1994) , the S510 epitope was immunodominant in MHV-JHM infection (Fig. 4A ). CD8 cells from MHV-JHM-infected brains also exhibited a greater response against the S598 epitope compared to cells from MHV-A59infected brains (Fig. 4B ). Anti-CD3 activates antigen-experienced cells (Yee et al., 1994) and was used to characterize the ability of total CD8 T cell population, which entered the brain in response to infection, to produce IFNg. To evaluate the relationship between the anti-CD3 and viral peptide stimulations, the percentages of IFNg+ CD8 T cells observed following these stimulations were compared (Fig.  4C ). MHV-JHM infection resulted in similar percentages of IFNg+ CD8 T cells in response to either anti-CD3 (21.5%) or known viral peptides (24.2%), resulting in a viral/anti-CD3 ratio of 1:1. In contrast, following MHV-A59 infection, only about 0.29 of the anti-CD3 response reflected that of the viral peptide S598.",

This suggested that a greater recruitment of macrophages into the brain could be initiated early in MHV-JHM infection. This possibility was evaluated directly by FACS analysis of cells within the analyzed within the mononuclear cell gate (as determined by forward and side scatter) and stained with macrophage markers. Macrophage populations were determined by staining isolated cells with anti-CD45 and either anti-FcgR or anti-CD11b enabling differentiation between macrophages (CD45 high/CD11b high) and microglial cells (CD45 intermediate/CD11b high) (Carson et al., 1998) . MHV-JHMinfected brains demonstrated approximately 2-fold greater percentages of macrophages defined as either CD45 high/ FcgR high or CD45 high/CD11b high phenotypes (Fig. 8) . B220 staining was more intense following MHV-A59 infection (data not shown), indicating that disparity in CD45 high/FcgR high staining was not due to greater numbers of B cells in MHV-JHM-infected brains. Thus, strong macrophage responses were clearly not protective, but were associated with severe viral encephalitis.",

It is apparent that a key decisive event in the pathogenesis of MHV-JHM is the early activation of innate immune responses reflected by elevated and sustained activation of IFNh and IL-6, together with the accumulation of MIP-1a, MIP-1h, and MIP-2 mRNA. A subsequent impact on leukocyte recruitment was evident by the macrophage-dominated cellular infiltrate deficient in CD8 T cells. This response, and the fatal consequence of MHV-JHM infection, stood in marked contrast to MHV-A59 infection where the enhanced induction of IFNg transcripts supported CD8 T cell activity.",

At this time, MHV-JHM and MHV-A59 induced distinct patterns of cytokine (Figs. 2 and 6) and chemokine (Fig. 7) transcripts. The RNA profiles of the two infections in vivo became increasingly divergent over time, corresponding to the infiltration of discrete leukocyte populations, suggesting that the polarization of leukocyte responses emerged out of virally induced innate CNS immunity and reinforced them.",

Both infections also triggered the accumulation of early IFNh transcripts that were sustained in MHV-JHM infection, but essentially undetectable in MHV-A59 infection by day 7, perhaps due to the difference in viral loads (Fig. 2) . IFNh production is an essential component in the control of some viral infections (Biron et al., 1999; Orange and Biron, 1996) . However, in MHV infection, continued IFNh appears to have limited benefit, considering the strong, but clearly ineffective, IFNh transcription seen in MHV-JHM infection (Fig. 2 ) and the inability of exogenous IFNh to protect against MHV infection of astrocytoma cells (unpublished data). In contrast, IFNg is considered essential for MHV clearance as observed by an increase in mortality among IFNg-knockout and IFNg receptor-knockout mice infected with attenuated MHV strains (Marten et al., 2001; Parra et al., 1999; Schijns et al., 1998) . Interferons also impact T cell responses. The enhanced presence of IFNh might impede T cell activity as demonstrated in experimental models of MS, where IFNh treatment ameliorated disease impairing T cell proliferation and migration into the brain (Yasuda et al., 1999; Zou et al., 1999) . IFNg, on the other hand, promotes the T cell migration into the brain in part by upregulating adhesion and co-stimulatory molecules within the CNS and the periphery (Grau et al., 1997) . Therefore, the lag in IFNg mRNA expression and the enhanced IFNh, compared to IFNg, transcript levels following MHV-JHM inoculation (Fig. 2) could be instrumental to the failure to control viral replication both directly and indirectly resulting in the lack of appropriate support for CD8 T cells (Figs. 3, 4, and 5 ). The early (d. 3) resident brain cell, possibly neuronal, transcription of IFNg mRNA in MHV-A59 infection defines an environment that would be more supportive of CD8 T cell responses (Mori et al., 2001) .",

Anti-CD3 stimulation was used as a positive control and to quantitate the capacity of the total CD8 T cell population to produce IFNg. In MHV-JHM infection, the known viral epitopes reflected the full potential for antigen-experienced cells to produce IFNg following anti-CD3 stimulation (indicating that in MHV-JHM infection, the response from the anti-CD3 stimulation is representative of the viral epitope stimulations, Fig. 4C ). In contrast, following MHV-A59 infection, the viral epitope stimulations were a fraction (0.29) of the anti-CD3 stimulation. This suggests that an undefined immunodominant epitope, capable of inducing IFNg synthesis, exists within the MHV-A59 genome that is absent in MHV-JHM. Alternatively, this may reflect the activation of non-virus-specific CD8 cells or some combination of these events . The diminished CD8 T cell presence in MHV-JHM-infected brains also appeared to reduce the potential for IFNg production in the brain, resulting in a 3-fold lower potential percentage of IFNg+ mononuclear cells isolated from the MHV-JHM-infected brain as compared to MHV-A59-infected brain (Fig. 4D) .",

Alternatively, macrophages recruited into the brain upon MHV-JHM infection (Fig. 8) may instigate or amplify CD8 T cell apoptosis, as activated macrophages can induce premature CD8 T cell apoptosis (Bronte et al., 1998) .

Activated glial cells can produce chemokines thereby influencing the composition of the ensuing cellular infiltrate. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that glial cells produce MIP-1a and MIP-1h, along with RANTES, in response to MHV and other CNS infections (Asensio et al., 1999; Hoffman et al., 1999; Kitai et al., 2000; Lane et al., 1998) . MIP-1a and MIP-1h predominately enhanced the migration of macrophages, eosinophils, and T cells (Baggiolini et al., 1994) . Upregulation of MIP-1 message following MHV-JHM infection corresponded with elevated CD45 high/FcR high or CD45 high/CD11b high staining positive cells assessed within a mononuclear cell gate (Carson et al., 1998) . These cells are most likely macrophages as staining with anti-B220 and anti-NK1.1 was, respectively, diminished and similar from MHV-JHM compared to MHV-A59-infected brains (data not shown, Fig. 3 ). Although macrophages often play a protective role in immune defense, their presence has also been associated with inflammatory diseases, lethal viral infections, and neurodegeneration (Lidbury et al., 2000; Smits et al., 2000; Xiong et al., 1999) . Severe MHV infections have been previously associated with increased macrophage activation, seen in the upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase message in the brain and macrophage procoagulant activity in the periphery (Fingerote et al., 1996; Parra et al., 1997) . It is probable that the heightened MIP-2 mRNA levels that were observed in MHV-JHM infection are chemotatic for neutrophils. Preliminary experiments with anti-Ly-6G monoclonal antibody (RB6, using a polynuclear cell gate) revealed a 1.6-to 2-fold greater presence of neutrophils in MHV-JHMinfected brains as compared to MHV-A59 (data not shown). Future studies may demonstrate that neutrophils contribute to the limited protection seen in wild-type MHV-JHM infection, as observed in broader protection seen following an attenuated MHV-JHM viral infection (Zhou et al., 2003) . However, taken together, the chemokine and cellular infiltration patterns observed here support our conclusion that MHV-JHM infection induces a pattern of immune responses that may be detrimental to recovery.",

An increasing number of viral components have been found to activate different immune responses, including IFNg downregulation and apoptosis (Basler et al., 2000; Chen et al., 2001; Park et al., 2001) . Considering the genetic similarity of MHV-JHM and MHV-A59, it is likely that distinct viral gene products will be found to impact immune responses. Zhang et al. (1998) reported that expression of MHV-JHM hemagglutinin/esterase, using defective interfering particles, in a MHV-A59 infection enhances the accumulation of IL-6 mRNA in vitro. In addition, other studies in our laboratory (submitted) indicate that elevated MIP-1 transcripts and macrophage recruitment by MHV-JHM was associated with enhanced mortality following infection with a chimeric virus containing the MHV-JHM spike gene expressed on the MHV-A59 background.",
