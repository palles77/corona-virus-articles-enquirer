We extend the existing models by incorporating a piecewise continuous transmission rate to describe that the media coverage exhibits its effect once the number of infected individuals exceeds a certain critical level. Mathematical and bifurcation analyses with regard to the local, global stability of equilibria and local sliding bifurcations are performed. Our main results show that the system stabilizes at either the equilibrium points of the two subsystems or the new endemic state induced by the on-off media effect, depending on the threshold levels. The finding suggests that a previously chosen level of the desired number of infected individuals can be reached when the threshold policy and other parameters are chosen properly.",

Massive news coverage and fast information flow can generate a profound psychological impact on the public. Media communications have played an important role in affecting the outcome of infectious disease outbreaks, such as the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the recent 2009 H1N1 influenza epidemic [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . In particular, the propagation of information and education by media have great influence not only on individual behavior but also on the implementation of public intervention and control measures. If susceptible individuals are alert enough to avoid unnecessary contact with infected individuals or all infected individuals stay in the region being treated and cancel their trips, new transmission will apparently decrease due to reduced contact rates [7, 8] . The role of media coverage on the transmission of disease is thus crucial and should be given prominence in the study of disease dynamics.",

Cui et al., in [3] , proposed a compartment model with incidence rate \u00b5 exp(\u2212mI)SI with m > 0 to reflect the impact of media coverage on the transmission. They have shown that Hopf bifurcation can occur when m > 0 is sufficiently small. Li et al., in [6] , used \u03b2 2 I/(m + I) to reflect the reduced amount of contact rate through media coverage and formulated an SIS (susceptible-infective-susceptible) epidemic model with incidence rate (\u03b2 1 \u2212 \u03b2 2 I/(m + I))SI/N. Moreover, other forms, such as (\u00b5 1 \u2212 \u00b5 2 f (I))SI/(S + I), have been formulated to approximate the media-induced incidence rate (see details in [2, 4, 5] ).",

However, this is not really the case. Mostly, at the initial stages of an emerging infectious disease, both the general individuals and public mass media are unaware of the disease. Media reports, information processing, and individuals' alerted responses to the information can only arise as the number of infected individuals reaches and exceeds a certain level. For example, the A/H1N1 virus was first reported in two US children in Mexico in March 2009, but health officials have stated that it apparently infected people as early as January 2009 in Mexico [9] . Hence, at the initial stage, the number of A/H1N1 cases and information about early precautionary measures against the disease were not available. With a diseases spreading further and information about infectious disease outbreaks being reported, media coverage about an epidemic disease can encourage the public to take precautionary measures against the disease such as wearing masks, avoiding public places, avoiding travel when sick, and frequent hand washing.",

Then any trajectory starting from a point out of the closed orbit l 1 cannot cross the cycle l 1 , and certainly cannot tend to the endemic equilibrium E 1 r , which contradicts the stability of equilibrium E 1 r in G 1 . If the latter holds, it indicates that the endemic state E 1 r is an unstable focus, which also contradicts that E 1 r is stable in G 1 .

This indicates that the media coverage exhibits its effect once the epidemic disease emerges and begins to spread. By Proposition 2, we know that system S 2 will stabilize at the disease-free equilibrium E 0 or endemic equilibrium E 2 depending on the basic reproduction number R 0 . In fact, when R 0 < 1, the disease-free equilibrium E 0 is globally asymptotically stable, suggesting that the disease is eradicated; when R 0 > 1, the endemic equilibrium E 2 turns out to be a global attractor, suggesting that the disease persists and the number of infected individuals approaches the level of I 2 * , which is determined uniquely by system S 2 itself. However, Filippov system (4) is an epidemic system with piece-wise continuous transmission rate. It follows from Theorems 1 and 3 that it may stabilize at one of the endemic equilibria (i.e., E 1 or E 2 ) of the variable structures when R 0 > 1, depending on the choice of the critical level I c . The most interesting and crucial issue is that the switched system (4) can stabilize at the pseudo-equilibrium E S (Theorem 2), which is new and qualitatively different from the equilibrium for system S 2 . This indicates that a previously chosen level of the desired number of the infected persons can be reached when the threshold level and other parameters are chosen properly, which may suggest to us an idea for disease control when the emergent infectious diseases cannot be eradicated immediately.",

The formulated models implicitly assume that the media-induced effect occurs throughout all the epidemic time. However, public mass media usually cannot be aware of or report infectious diseases when the number of infected individuals is generally small at the initial stages of disease spreading. To model this vital fact, we extend the existing models by incorporating a piecewise continuous transmission rate to represent that media reports and education can exhibit their effects once the number of infected individuals exceeds a certain level. To our best knowledge, system (1) with (2) is the first epidemic system that incorporates a piecewise continuous transmission rate to describe the real impact of media coverage on infectious diseases. The proposed epidemic model in this paper, which is described by a piecewise smooth ordinary differential equations, describes the media-induced effect subject to variable structure control. The system is actually called a Filippov system (or switching system) in control language [12] . A commonly used and implementable control is the simple on-off control, which can stabilize the models [21, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . The overall objective of this paper is to examine the effect of media coverage on disease transmission and to address whether the improved function representing the media-induced effect influences the global dynamics of disease transmission.",

In particular, the sliding mode dynamics and the local sliding bifurcations have been addressed in this paper. The crucial role of the variable structure control in determining the dynamical behavior of the model is shown. We have also obtained the global stability for the Filippov epidemic model by using qualitative techniques. Our main results suggest that the system stabilizes at the equilibrium point E 1 r , E 2 r , or E S , depending on the threshold level I c . Six different types of threshold level are considered (see Fig. 5 ). For each one, the sliding segment is exclusively, partly, or totally in the attraction region. Fig. 5(a)-(c) show that the endemic state E 1 r is globally asymptotically stable, i.e., E 1 r is a global attractor. Trajectories may approach the endemic equilibrium E 1 r without sliding, or enter the sliding region and then slide and approach the equilibrium E 1 r , depending on the initial data.

This implies that the infected population can stabilize at a previously chosen level (i.e., I c ) when the threshold policy and other parameters are chosen properly.

In the following, we shall show that E 1 r is globally asymptotically stable.Theorem 1. For Filippov system (4) , the endemic equilibrium E 1 r is globally asymptotically stable if R 0 > 1. Proof. Suppose that \u25b3 1 < 0. Then the endemic equilibrium E 1 r is a focus, which is locally asymptotically stable, by the above discussion. The procedure of the proof for Lemma 2 shows that the trajectory moves from the right to the left on the sliding segment T 1 T 2 in this case.Note that it is easy to get I 1 c > I 1 * , I 2 c > I 2 * and I 1 c \u2265 I 2 c , where I 1 c and I 2 c are defined as those in Section 3. Then, either I 2 c > I 1 * or I 2 c < I 1 * may hold true. For different sets of values of the parameters, the sliding segment may exclusively, partly, or totally be in the attraction region \u2126, so we then consider the following three possibilities.(i) If I c \u2265 I 1 c , then the point (\u03b1, I c ) \u2208 \u0393 1 in the \u03b1 \u2212 I c plane (shown in Fig. 1 ). The sliding segment T 1 T 2 lies out of the attraction region \u2126 entirely, as shown in Fig. 5(a) .Then the regular equilibrium E 1 r and the virtual equilibrium E 2 v are in region G 1\u2229 \u2126, and the direction of the vector field in region G 2\u2229 \u2126 points downward. Hence, no limit cycle which is partly in region G 1 and partly in G 2 exists in the attraction region \u2126. In addition, by Lemma 1, there is no limit cycle totally in G i (i = 1, 2). Therefore the local stability of the endemic equilibrium E 1 r implies that E 1 r is globally asymptotically stable. (ii) If max{I 1 * , I 2 c } < I c < I 1 c , then we get (\u03b1, I c ) \u2208 \u0393 2 in the \u03b1 \u2212 I c plane (see Fig. 1 ). In such a case the sliding segment T 1 T 2 partly lies out of the attraction region \u2126, as shown in Fig. 5(b) . Note that again the direction of the vector field in region G 2\u2229 \u2126 points downward. Moreover, according to Lemma 2, we know that no closed orbit containing part of the sliding segment T 1 T 2 exists. Hence, the endemic equilibrium E 1 r is globally asymptotically stable.(iii) If I c \u2264 max{I 1 * , I 2 c }, then we can get (\u03b1, I c ) \u2208 \u0393 3 in the \u03b1 \u2212 I c plane (see Fig. 1 ), and the sliding segment is totally in the attraction region \u2126, as shown in Fig. 5(c) .Note that a limit cycle totally in the region G 1 or G 2 does not exist. In addition, Lemma 2 precludes the possibility of a limit cycle induced by the sliding nature of the trajectories on the sliding domain \u03a3 S . It follows from Lemma 3 that there is no limit cycle in the attraction region \u2126 which surrounds the sliding segment T 1 T 2 . Hence, the endemic equilibrium E 1 r is globally asymptotically stable.If \u2206 1 \u2265 0, the endemic equilibrium E 1 r is a node, which is also asymptotically stable in G 1 . Note that both the regular equilibrium E 1 r and virtual equilibrium E 2 v are in region G 1 . This indicates that all trajectories will attain the subregion of the attraction region \u2126 below the manifold \u03a3. Moreover, they will remain in it and approach the endemic equilibrium E 1 r . Hence E 1 r is globally asymptotically stable. This completes the proof of Theorem 1.",
