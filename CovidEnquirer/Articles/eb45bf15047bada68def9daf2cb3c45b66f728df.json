Adjuvants are commonly used for antigen sparing in other vaccines, and thereby could potentially have major benefits to extend JJA supplies if they were to similarly enhance JJA VIT immunogenicity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the physicochemical and microbiological stability and murine immunogenicity of low-dose JJA VIT formulated with a novel polysaccharide adjuvant referred to as delta inulin or Advax TM . Jack Jumper ant venom (JJAV) protein stability was assessed by UPLC-UV, SDS-PAGE, SDS-PAGE immunoblot, and ELISA inhibition. Diffraction light scattering was used to assess particle size distribution of Advax; pH and benzyl alcohol quantification by UPLC-UV were used to assess the physicochemical stability of JJAV diluent, and endotoxin content and preservative efficacy test was used to investigate the microbiological properties of the adjuvanted VIT formulation. To assess the effect of adjuvant on JJA venom immunogenicity, mice were immunised four times with JJAV alone or formulated with Advax adjuvant. JJA VIT formulated with Advax was found to be physicochemically and microbiologically stable for at least 2 days when stored at 4 and 25 \u2022 C with a trend for an increase in allergenic potency observed beyond 2 days of storage. Low-dose JJAV formulated with Advax adjuvant induced significantly higher JJAV-specific IgG than a 5-fold higher dose of JJAV alone, consistent with a powerful allergen-sparing effect. The pharmaceutical data provides important guidance on the formulation, storage and use of JJA VIT formulated with Advax adjuvant, with the murine immunogenicity studies providing a strong rationale for a planned clinical trial to test the ability of Advax adjuvant to achieve 4-fold JJAV dose sparing in JJA-allergic human patients.",

Immunotherapy for the prevention of stinging insect anaphylaxis involves the administration https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpba.2019.04.017 0731-7085/\u00a9 2019 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. of increasing doses of purified insect venom to induce clinical tolerance, as reflected by a progressive reduction in venom-specific IgE and increase in IgG4 [2] . JJA venom immunotherapy (VIT) involving a large maintenance dose of 100 g of venom has been shown to be highly effective at preventing JJA sting anaphylaxis, reducing the risk of severe systemic sting reactions by 95% [3] . Real-world experience shows efficacy comparable with yellow jacket and better than honeybee VIT [4] . The applicability of JJA VIT to the wider population, however, is limited by highly restricted JJA venom (JJAV) extract availability, production cost, and high incidence of adverse events [3] [4] [5] .",

A potential candidate adjuvant for VIT is the delta inulin-based adjuvant, Advax TM . Advax is based on the plant derived fructan inulin (\u2424-d-[2\u21921] poly(fructo-furanosyl) \u2423-d-glucose) [7] . Inulin has no immunological activity when in soluble form, but once formulated into delta inulin microparticles of 1-5 m size, it has potent immune-adjuvant activity [8] . Advax has been shown in preclinical studies to enhance immunogenicity of a broad range of vaccines including influenza, hepatitis B virus (HBV), Japanese encephalitis, SARS coronavirus, HIV, listeria, RSV, and anthrax [9, 10] . The safety and efficacy of Advax have been shown in adult humans when formulated with HBV and influenza vaccines [9, 11, 12] . When combined with honeybee VIT and administered to individuals with honeybee-sting anaphylaxis, Advax was shown to be safe and well tolerated [13] , and enhanced the immunogenicity of the honeybee venom with strongly enhanced venom-specific IgG4 responses [14] , a potential marker of successful immunotherapy [15] .",

JJAV in the inhibition mixtures was either baseline or stability samples as described in Section 2.4. A positive control was prepared by diluting PPS 1:4 (v/v) in PBS-T with 0.5% BSA and negative control consisted of PBS-T with 0.5% BSA and incubated overnight at 4 \u2022 C. Subsequently, venom coating solution was discarded and the plate was washed three times with PBS-T. The venom-coated plate was incubated with 100 L of inhibition mixtures, positive control and negative control for 60 min at room temperature (RT). The plate was washed three times with PBS-T, and 100 L of biotinylated mouse monoclonal anti-human IgE antibody (1:2000 (v/v) dilution in PBS-T, clone HP6029, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) was added to each well and incubated in the dark for 60 min at RT. The plate was washed three times with PBS-T, and then 100 L of streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase (1:1000 (v/v) dilution in PBS-T, BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) was added to each well and the plate was incubated in the dark for 20 min at RT. The plate was washed three times with PBS-T, and then 100 L of 1-Step Ultra TMB-ELISA (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) was added to each well and the plate was incubated in the dark for 30 min at RT.

Each sample was analysed in triplicate and presented as mean and SD. alone, with the aim to assess the non-inferiority of the JJAV specific IgG responses in the JJAV 2 g + Advax low dose group when compared to the JJAV 10 g high dose group. Blood samples were collected 2 weeks after the last immunization for measurement of JJAV-specific total IgG and IgG subtypes by ELISA. While only low or undetectable levels of JJAV-specific IgG were seen in animals immunised with 10 g of JJAV alone, all animals in the low dose JJAV (2 g) + Advax arm had detectable JJAV-specific IgG. A formal non-inferiority analysis performed using pre-specified limits, confirmed the low dose JJAV + Advax arm was statistically non-inferior to the high dose JJAV alone group (p = 0.976). A subsequent test of superiority confirmed that the JJAV-specific IgG responses in the low dose JJAV + Advax arm were superior (p = 0.048) to those in the high dose alone arm (Fig. 5) . Hence, Advax was confirmed to provide at least 5-fold JJAV dose-sparing. Analysis of IgG isotypes confirmed that the predominant effect of Advax adjuvant was predominantly through significant enhancement of specific IgG1 rather than IgG2a. No JJAV-specific IgE was detected in the sera of the immunized mice and no local (swelling, redness, hair loss) or systemic (weight loss, fever, inactivity, loss of grooming) adverse effects were observed.",

In particular, the current study used U-100 plastic insulin syringes to store the samples and a lower concentration of JJAV was used than in the previous study. Measurement of total allergenic activity as determined by ELISA inhibition assay is required by regulatory bodies for the standard- ization and batch control of AIT products [23, 24] . The slight increase in JJAV allergenic activity with storage is entirely consistent with previous findings and this has been proposed to be due to conformational changes in the JJAV proteins in the presence of polysorbate 80 in the JJAV diluent [17] . Despite ELISA inhibition data indicating that the vast majority of allergenic activity was preserved, it does not exclude the possibility that one or more \"minor\" allergens might have degraded. This perhaps is better monitored using the immunoblot assay where we observed the shift down in the 22-23 kDa bands, recently found to be Phospholipase A 2 enzyme [1] , to a band at approximately 19 kDa (Fig S2) . This pattern of allergen degradation is consistent with prior findings and it was not affected by the inclusion of Advax in the formulation. Wanandy et al. recently reported the adsorption of Myr p 1 and Myr p 3 allergens when JJAV API grade products were allowed to contact rubber stoppers for more than 24 h [16] . Even though the low-dose JJAV in the current study was stored in plastic syringes with rubber plungers, negligible adsorption was identified. This difference might be due to the inclusion of polysorbate 80 as a surface active agent in the current samples, or different adsorption capacity and surface area of the rubbers.",

            "text": "JJAV solutions above 25 g/mL that are used for immunotherapy are intended for multi-dose use. The addition of benzyl alcohol as an antimicrobial preservative in the JJAV diluent is essential to reduce the risk of bacterial contamination [25, 26] . The insignificant change in the pH of the JJAV diluent in the presence of Advax was important as the solubility and optimal antimicrobial activity of benzyl alcohol is considerably reduced above pH 7 [17, 27] . When used as an antimicrobial preservative, benzyl alcohol is commonly added to parenteral preparations at a concentration between 0.75-5% [27, 28] . A 19% reduction of benzyl alcohol concentration in JJAV diluent due to dilutional effects from the addition of Advax reduced the concentration of benzyl alcohol to below this usual range and could therefore have affected its effectiveness as a preservative. However, the AET experiments confirmed that the antimicrobial efficacy of the combined formulation against challenged organisms was maintained throughout the study period. It is possible that this was due, at least in part, to the inherent antimicrobial activities of JJAV [29] , which provided additive or synergistic effects to the preservative activity of benzyl alcohol. If this was the case, since low concentrations of venom proteins are used during the induction phase of a VIT, a greater reliance on the antimicrobial efficacy of benzyl alcohol is required during this phase.",

The increase in average particle size and PdI observed at the end of study period may be caused by formation of delta inulin aggregates. However, the absence of multimodal peaks in all samples tested throughout the study period suggests that aggregation, if present, is limited under the study conditions employed and importantly the size of these particles was within the accepted range for stability (Table 1 ). Advax has been reported to have minimal protein adsorptive capacity [30] , and similarly we found no evidence that Advax adsorbs JJAV allergens as there was minimal difference in the SDS-PAGE and UPLC-UV analysis of venom components between samples formulated with and without Advax.",

Whilst there is currently no animal model of JJAV allergy, and hence the effects of Advax on inhibition of JJAV IgE during VIT or its ability to induce blocking IgG4 antibodies is unable to be assessed outside of human studies, the ability of Advax to enhance venom-specific IgG responses when compared to immunisation with venom alone has served as a useful predictive marker of favourable human responses in previous human studies of Advax-adjuvanted honeybee VIT, where inclusion of Advax led to an earlier and higher rise of venom-specific total IgG and IgG4 with potential blocking activity [13, 14] . Hence the current results support the rationale for a planned human trial of Advax combined with a reduced dose of JJAV (25 g in maintenance phase) as compared to the currently clinically proven 100 g maintenance JJAV dose. Notably, no safety or reactogenicity issues were identified with the Advax-adjuvanted low dose JJAV formulation in the current study.",

Plans are in place to commence a human clinical trial to assess the ability of Advax to reduce the required maintenance dose of JJAV from 100 to 25 g per dose, which if successful would result in a 4-fold higher number of subjects able to be treated with JJA VIT with current supplies, while also significantly reducing the potential cost of therapy, which largely reflects JJAV costs.
