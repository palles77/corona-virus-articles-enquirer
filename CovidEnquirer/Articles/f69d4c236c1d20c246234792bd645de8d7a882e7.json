            "text": "We have previously shown that cells infected with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) bind rabbit, mouse, and rat IgG by the Fc portion of the IgG molecule. This Fc-binding activity appeared to be mediated by the MHV S protein. S protein could also be precipitated from MHV-infected cells by a monoclonal antibody directed against the murine Fc y receptor (FcrR). To prove definitively that the S protein mediates Fc-binding activity, we have expressed the MHV S protein utilizing recombinant vaccinia viruses. The anti-FcyR monoclonal antibody, 2.462, precipitated recombinant S protein in cells of murine, human, and rabbit origin. Since the anti-Fc receptor monoclonal antibody does not react with human and rabbit Fc receptors these results demonstrate that the epitope recognized by this antibody is carried on the MHV S protein and is not murine in origin. Examination of various MHV isolates and escape mutants failed to identify the precise sequences in S responsible for the molecular mimicry of the murine FcrR. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that a previously identified region of similarity between the S protein and the FcrR mediates this activity. The Fc binding activity of S was expressed on the cell surface, since MHV-JHM-infected cells, but not uninfected cells, formed rosettes with anti-sheep red blood cell (SRBC) antibody-coated SRBC. The anti-FcyR monoclonal antibody neutralized MHV-JHM and inhibited syncytium formation induced by the MHV S protein.",

Mice or rats infected intracerebrally or intranasally with MHV-JHM may develop persistent infection leading to the development of chronic demyelinating inflammatory lesions of the brain and spinal cord (Weiner, 1973; LePrevost et al., 1979; Sorensen et al., 1982 Sorensen et al., , 1984 Perlman et al., 1990) . MHV-induced neurological disease in rodents provides an experimental model for demyelinating diseases of the human nervous system, such as multiple sclerosis. The S protein (formerly called E2) forms spikes or peplomers on the surface of the virus (Cavanagh, 1983) . Each peplomer consists of two or three S molecules, each with a molecular weight of 180 kDa. Analysis of the primary nucleotide sequence of the S gene revealed that it encodes a type 1 membrane protein (Luytjes et a/., 1987; Schmidt et al., 1987) .",

            "text": "In this report we unequivocally demonstrate that the Fc binding activity and immunologic cross-reactivity with FcyR resides on the S glycoprotein. MHV S protein expressed by a recombinant vaccinia virus reacts with anti-FcyR monoclonal antibody. Furthermore, MHV-JHM-infected cells form rosettes with IgG-coated sheep red blood cells, demonstrating that the FcR site is present on the cell surface. Finally, we demonstrate that the anti-FcyR 2.462 monoclonal antibody neutralizes MHV-JHM and inhibits cell fusion in a contact fusion assay. RK-13 (Bearle, 1963) and HeLa S3 cell lines were originally purchased from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD) and propagated in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM, GIBCO Laboratories, Grand Island, NY) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 U of penicillin G and streptomycin per milliliter. The origin and growth of the L-2 (Rothels, 1959) DBT (Hirano et a/., 1974) and 17CL-1 (Sturman and Takemoto, 1972) cell lines have been previously described. MHV-JHM, MHV-A59, and MHV-3 were routinely propagated on 17CL-1 cells as described previously (Robb et a/., 1979) . Vaccinia virus strain IHD was obtained from the ATCC. Isolation and characterization of anti-S neutralizing antibody-resistant MHV variants V5A13, V5A13.1, and V4B.11 have been previously described (Parker et al., 1989; Gallagher et al., 1990) .",

The recombinant protein precipitated by the anti-FcyR 2.4G2 monoclonal antibody had a mol wt identical to that precipitated by goat anti-S antibody. This recombinant S protein was 15 kDa smaller than wt MHV S protein (Fig. 1 , compare lanes j and I with lanes h and i). This difference in size has been noted previously and reflects a deletion in the S gene of the virus from which these clones were derived (Schmidt et a/., 1987; Parker et a/., 1989) . The 1.38.1 and 1.43.2 anti-S neutralizing monoclonal anti-bodies, which immunoprecipitated the 180 kDa wt MHV-JHM S protein (Fig. l) , did not recognize the recombinant vaccinia virus synthesized S protein ( Fig. 1 and data not shown). The inability of these anti-S monoclonal antibodies to recognize recombinant S may be due to deletions of certain epitopes in the recombinant S or due to conformational differences between wt and recombinant S which are a result of this deletion. Precipitation of recombinant S protein expressed by vaccinia virus was not via the secondary goat anti-rat IgG antibody. This antibody as well as goat anti-mouse IgG did not precipitate any protein of this size from DBT cells infected simultaneously with vTF3 and VV-E2 (Fig. 1 ). In addition these results demonstrate that irrelevant goat IgG does not immunoprecipitate recombinant S, in agreement with our previously published findings with wt MHV S. As expected, the 165-kDa polypeptide could not be detected by immunoprecipitation from lysates of cells infected either with recombinant vTF3 alone, with W-E2 alone, or with wt vaccinia virus (Fig. 1) . Recombinant 165 kDa S protein was also immunoprecipitated by a purified rabbit IgG specific for M. lysodeikticus (but not F(ab), fragments) and by an irrelevant rat monoclonal antibody specific for lung surfactant (data not shown).",

S protein synthesized in these diverse cell types all bind the anti-Fc receptor monoclonal antibody 2.4G2. Since this monoclonal antibody does not react with either human or rabbit FcR these results rule out the possibility that Fc receptor activity is due to the association of a cellular murine Fc receptor with the S protein. Furthermore, fibroblastic L cells do not contain FcR gene transcripts (Ravetch eta/., 1986) . It is almost certain that the Fc binding activity and the epitope recognized by 2.4G2 both reside on the S protein.",

This difference in size is due to a deletion in the MHV-JHM cDNA clones that were used to construct our recombinant vaccinia viruses (Schmidt et a/., 1987; Parker et al., 1989; Gallagher et a/., 1990) . This deletion is from residues 453 to 595 using the sequence from MHV (Parker et al., 1989 ) as a point of reference (see Fig. 3 ). Thus, it is clear that the sequences between residues 453 and 595 do not contain the epitope responsible for molecular mimicry between S and FcR. These results were verified by analyses performed on cells infected with 3 mutants deleted within the Nterminal half of the S gene (Fig. 4) . The three variants and the S recombinant vaccinia virus are all deleted adjacent to a region of sequence similarity between MHV-JHM and FcR (Fig. 3) which has been suggested as a candidate for the domain conferring molecular mimicry of the FcR (Oleszak and Leibowitz, 1990) . These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the Fc binding site is located in this domain.",

For HSV-1, the FcR activity resides on a complex of two glycoproteins, gE and gl (Longnecker et al., 1987; Johnson et a/., 1988) . Expression of gE alone was sufficient for FcR activity; however, Fc binding was greatly enhanced by coexpression of gl (Bell et al., 1990; Hanke et al., 1990 ). Therefore, it has been proposed that HSV-1 induces two Fc receptors with different affinities. The Fc receptor activity of MHV S protein more closely resembles that of HSV gE since it appears to be of relatively low affinity. Furthermore, the activity seems to reside on only one MHV protein (this work, Oleszak and Leibowitz, 1990) .",

Alternatively, the neutralizing activity of 2.462 may be due to blocking the membrane fusing activity of S, rather than inhibiting binding of S to the cellular receptor for MHV.

Such binding could reduce complement and cell mediated lysis of infected cells. These effects might allow virus-infected cells to avoid the host immune response, especially ADCCmediated destruction, and potentially play a role in MHV persistent infections.
