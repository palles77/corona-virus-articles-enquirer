            "text": "Bovine Respiratory Disease is the most costly disease that affects beef and dairy cattle industry. Its etiology is multifactorial, arising from predisposing environmental stress conditions as well as the action of several different respiratory pathogens. This situation has hindered the development of effective control strategies. Although different type of vaccines are available, many currently marketed vaccines are based on inactivated cultures of the main viral and bacterial agents involved in this pathology. The molecular composition of commercial veterinary vaccines is a critical issue. The present work aims to define at the proteomic level the most relevant valence of a line of commercial respiratory vaccines widely used in Central and South America. Since Mannheimia haemolytica is responsible for most of the disease associated morbid-mortality, we focused on the main proteins secreted by this pathogen, in particular Leukotoxin A, its main virulence factor. By Western blot analysis and mass spectrometry, Leukotoxin A was identified as a major component of (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/). M. haemolytica culture supernatants. We also identified other ten M. haemolytica proteins, including outer membrane proteins, periplasmic transmembrane solute transporters and iron binding proteins, which are relevant to achieve protective immunity against the pathogen. This work allowed a detailed molecular characterization of this vaccine component, providing evidence of its quality and efficacy. Furthermore, our results contributed to the identification of several proteins of interest as subunit vaccine candidates.",

It has an estimated annual cost to the worldwide cattle industry of over $3 billion (Potter, 2015) . This multifactorial syndrome can be caused either by viral or bacterial pathogens. Viral agents include bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) (Gershwin et al., 2000) , parainfluenza III virus (PI-3) (Fulton et al., 2000) , bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) (Ridpath, 2010) and bovine corona virus (BCV) (Autio et al., 2007) . These respiratory viruses along with some mycoplasmal agents are generally the primary infectious agents involved in BRD (Potter, 2015) . This initial infection establishes a respiratory environment predisposing to the colonization and replication of pathogenic bacteria, including Mannheimia haemolytica (Al-Ghamdi et al., 2000) , Pasteurella multocida (Dabo et al., 2007) and Histophilus somni (Corbeil, 2007) , the former being responsible for up to 50% of the disease associated mortality (Narayanan et al., 2002; Potter, 2015) . M. haemolytica is a Gram negative opportunistic bacterium. Although it is a common bacterium of the upper respiratory tract and nasopharynx of healthy ruminants, it can also act as an opportunistic pathogen infecting the lower respiratory tract under stressful situations such as shipping, adverse environmental conditions or previous respiratory viral infection (Youssef et al., 2004; Orouji et al., 2012) .",

It belongs to the family of the RTX (repeat in toxin) pore-forming cytolysins, which have been linked with the virulence of other bacterial species (Lo et al., 1987; Lainson et al., 1996) . It specifically targets ruminant leukocytes and plays a major role in pathogenesis of BRD by impairing the primary lung defense mechanism and by inducing inflammation as a consequence of leukocyte lysis (Conlon et al., 1991) . This phenomenon has been correlated with its ability to bind and interact with the ruminant beta2-integrin Lymphocyte Function-associated Antigen 1 (LFA-1) (CD11a/CD18) (Zecchinon et al., 2005; Singh et al., 2011) . Neutralizing antibodies generation against the cytolytic toxin is relevant for achieving a high level of protection (Mosier et al., 1989) . Immunity against M. haemolytica also requires antibodies against bacterial cell surface antigens (Shewen and Wilkie, 1988) and iron-regulated outer membrane proteins (Potter et al., 1999) .",
