RPMI 1640 medium was supplemented with a soybean peptone, l-glutamine and antibiotics, so that the protein concentration was less than 5 g/ml (RPMI/SP medium). The resulting adapted MDCK-SP cells showed steady growth after the twenty-eighth passage in RPMI/SP medium (MDCK-SP cell culture). Canine distemper virus, canine parvovirus, canine adenoviruses and canine parainfluenza virus, which are the principal components of canine combined virus vaccines, grew in the MDCK-SP cell culture as efficiently as the parental MDCK cells cultured in the conventional Eagle's MEM containing fetal bovine serum. Consequently, the use of MDCK-SP cell culture can make current canine vaccine products much safer, of higher quality and at lower cost.",

These are canine herpesvirus (CHV), infectious canine hepatitis virus (canine adenovirus type 1: CAV-1), infectious canine laryngotracheitis virus (canine adenovirus type 2: CAV-2), canine parvovirus type 2 (CPV-2), canine parainfluenza virus (CPIV), canine distemper virus (CDV), rabies virus, and canine coronavirus (CCoV). Of these, CAV-1, CPV-2 and CDV cause serious infections with high mortality, especially in non-immune puppies, and therefore vaccines against these infections are regarded as 'core' vaccines for dogs. Vaccination against these pathogens is widely practiced throughout the world. Non-core vaccines include those for CHV, CPIV and CCoV, and are essentially optional. * Tel.: +81 3 3264 7117; fax: +81 3 3264 6094.",

CAV-2 vaccination provides immunity against infectious canine hepatitis caused by CAV-1 because of their shared immunogens. In practice, canine vaccination starts in pups as young as 4 weeks of age, and puppies have to receive several injections until 3 months old, both because these pathogens are ubiquitous, and residual high levels of maternally derived antibodies may inhibit immunization. It is recommended that thereafter dogs should have a booster vaccination with an appropriate interval. For reviews of canine vaccination, see ref. [1] .",

Fetal bovine serum (FBS) has traditionally been used in cell cultures for vaccine production, and it is now widely recognized that FBS, serum components such as albumin, and other proteins of animal origin are not only the cause of such adverse events but may also be the source of adventitious microbial contaminations. Nuisance contaminants are generally fungi, bacteria, viruses, microbial nucleic acids, and more specially the prion of bovine spongiform encephalopathy [2] .

When the cells made a monolayer, they were trypsinized by using a mixture of 0.25% Trypsin (Difco Trypsin 250, swine pancreas origin) and 0.02% EDTA solution, and were resuspended in fresh medium. The cells were subcultured a further 33 times in the \"Opti-MEM I Reduced-Serum medium\" (Invitrogen) without a supplement of FBS.

It is well known that actively dividing cells are required for efficient replication of parvoviruses, and the same is true for CPV-2. The cellular DNA polymerase that is expressed only in mammalian cells during the S phase of the cell cycle is an essential factor for parvovirus replication [15] . Thus, it may be necessary to devise methods for obtaining the virus fluid with higher titers; for example, making use of a higher m.o.i. and of higher cell density in a smaller volume of medium, or of the parvovirus efficient culturing method [3] as applied for the preparation of the stock seed CPV-2 ( Table 1) .",

To our knowledge this is the first demonstration of an animal protein-free cell culture of canine viruses adopted for current canine vaccine products.
