Cathepsin inhibitors ablated cleavage of Nipah F. Proteolytic processing of Nipah F and fusion activity was dramatically reduced in cathepsin L shRNA-expressing Vero cells. Additionally, Nipah virus F-mediated fusion was inhibited in cathepsin Ldeficient cells, but coexpression of cathepsin L restored fusion activity. Both purified cathepsin L and B could cleave immunopurified Nipah F protein, but only cathepsin L produced products of the correct size. Our results suggest that endosomal cathepsins can cleave Nipah F, but that cathepsin L specifically converts Nipah F to a mature and fusogenic form.",

The outbreak was contained with the slaughter of more than one million pigs following the realization that the virus was spread from pigs to humans. Since the initial identification, additional Nipah virus outbreaks in Bangladesh (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) have been described, with case mortality rates approaching 70% and suspected human-to-human transmission (Hsu et al., 2004) . Nipah virus is an enveloped negative-strand RNA virus which together with Hendra virus is classified as a Henipavirus within the Paramyxoviridae family . Although fruit bats are thought to be the natural reservoir for Henipaviruses , both Nipah and Hendra viruses exhibit broad host tropism (Bossart et al., 2002) .",

            "text": "Successful replication and systemic transmission of Nipah virus require viral entry via fusion of the viral envelope with a cellular membrane. This prerequisite first step is facilitated by two viral glycoproteins, namely the attachment (G) protein, which binds the cellular ligand Ephrin-B2 (Bonaparte et al., 2005; Negrete et al., 2005) , and the fusion (F) protein. The F protein is synthesized as a precursor protein (F 0 ) that requires posttranslational proteolytic processing to form a disulfidelinked F 1 + F 2 heterodimer. This essential cleavage event exposes the fusion peptide, thus producing a mature F protein capable of mediating virus-cell and cell-cell membrane fusion. Typically, the paramyxovirus F proteins are processed by either an extracellular, tissue-specific trypsin-like protease after a single basic residue or by furin, a ubiquitous secretory pathway protease, following a multibasic cleavage motif (Garten et al., 1994) . Proteolytic processing of Henipavirus F proteins, however, deviates from these established cleavage mechanisms. N-terminal sequencing of the F 1 subunits predicted that cleavage occurred after a single basic residue (arginine 109 or lysine 109 in Nipah and Hendra virus F proteins, respectively) (Michalski et al., 2000; Moll et al., 2004) . However, neither these basic residues nor the amino acids immediately upstream of the processing site dictated cleavage specificity (Craft and Dutch, 2005; Moll et al., 2004) . Furthermore, activation of the Henipavirus F proteins is furin-independent, requires a low intracellular pH Moll et al., 2004; Pager et al., 2004) , and occurs during endocytosis and recycling of the F protein Meulendyke et al., 2005) . Recently, we demonstrated that the endosomal protease cathepsin L was involved in the proteolytic processing of the Hendra virus F protein (Pager and Dutch, 2005) . However, the protease involved in activation of Nipah F remains to be described.",

Nipah F was immunoprecipitated with a rabbit polyclonal antibody to inactivated Nipah virus, which efficiently detects the mature Nipah F protein. Immunoprecipitated F proteins were analyzed by 15% SDS-PAGE and visualized using the Typhoon imaging system. Immediately after metabolic labeling, a weak precursor F 0 band was seen (Fig. 1, lane 1) , which was subsequently converted during the 2 h chase to the mature F 1 + F 2 heterodimer (Fig. 1, lane 2) . Cleavage was not blocked by the addition of a membrane-impermeable cysteine protease inhibitor, E-64 (Fig. 1, lane 3) and CA-074Me), effectively abolished proteolytic processing of Nipah F (Fig. 1, lanes 4-9) . Correct intracellular trafficking of Nipah F in the absence and presence of select cysteine protease inhibitors was confirmed by endoglycosidase H digestion and biotinylation of cell surface Nipah F (data not shown). These data indicate that inhibition of cathepsin proteases specifically blocked Nipah F processing. Cathepsin L was recently shown to be involved in cleavage of the Hendra virus F protein (Pager and Dutch, 2005) . The sensitivity of Nipah F processing to changes in intracellular pH and the similar profile of inhibition with both the nonspecific and specific cathepsin inhibitors strongly suggest that cathepsin L is involved in activation of the Nipah F protein.",

In contrast, a small amount of cathepsin L protein and moderately reduced enzyme activity was retained following suppression with the Cath L662 shRNA oligonucleotide. Furthermore, both Cath L98-and Cath L662expressing Vero cells demonstrated similar cathepsin B enzyme activities as seen in Scramble-expressing and nontransfected Vero cells (Pager and Dutch, 2005) . To determine if maturation of Nipah F was effected in Vero cells expressing cathepsin L shRNA oligonucleotides, Nipah F was expressed in both untransfected and shRNA-transfected Vero cells, and F proteolysis assessed by metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation. Similar to untransfected Vero cells, Nipah F was efficiently processed in cells expressing the Scramble shRNA Fig. 1 . The addition of nonspecific and specific cysteine cathepsin inhibitors ablate proteolytic processing of Nipah F. Vero cells expressing pCAGGS-Nipah F were starved, labeled with Tran 35 S label, and chased for 2 h in the absence (DMSO) or presence of 10 \u03bcM E-64, E-64d, calpeptin, cathepsin L inhibitor III (Cath LIII), and CA-074Me, 1 \u03bcM MG-132, and 50 \u03bcM cathepsin inhibitor I (Cath I). Samples were analyzed by immunoprecipitation, 15% SDS-PAGE, and the Typhoon imaging system. Positions of F 0 , F 1 , and F 2 are indicated. oligonucleotide ( Fig. 2A, lanes 1 and 3) . In contrast, Nipah F cleavage was undetectable in Cath L98-expressing Vero cells ( Fig. 2A, lane 4) . However, compared to untransfected or Scramble shRNA-expressing cells, Nipah F processing was reduced in Cath L662-expressing cells ( Fig. 2A, lane 5) . These results clearly support a role for cathepsin L in proteolytic processing of the Nipah F protein.",

To ensure sufficient cathepsin L expression levels, pSG5-cathepsin L was transfected at twice the concentration of Nipah F. Transfected MEFs were overlaid with BSR cells and fusion activity quantified as before. As with cell-cell fusion assays performed in Vero cells, fusion in cathepsin L+/+ MEFs required the presence of both Nipah F and G proteins (Fig. 3) . In contrast, expression of both Nipah F and G did not lead to fusion in MEFs lacking cathepsin L, yet cell- cell fusion was partially restored upon coexpression of cathepsin L with Nipah F and G (Fig. 3) . We additionally verified that both cathepsin L+/+ and cathepsin L\u2212/\u2212 MEFs exhibited normal cathepsin B activity (data not shown).

These studies, however, do not directly show that Nipah F is a substrate for cathepsin L. We therefore examined the ability of purified cathepsin L to digest immunopurified uncleaved Nipah F 0 protein to F 1 + F 2 subunits. We previously showed that uncleaved Hendra F was generated by incubating transfected cells at 20\u00b0C. This temperature shift prevents budding of secretory vesicles from the trans-Golgi network and therefore inhibits cleavage of the F protein (Pager et al., 2004) . However, this processing block is overcome by returning cells to 37\u00b0C. Similarly, we found that Tran 35 S-labeled Nipah F was not cleaved when cells were incubated at 20\u00b0C compared to incubation at 37\u00b0C (Fig. 4A,  lanes 3 and 2) . However, upon returning cells to 37\u00b0C, Nipah F processing was restored (Fig. 4A, lane 4) . Therefore, uncleaved Nipah F, produced after metabolic labeling at 20\u00b0C, was immunoprecipitated and used as a substrate for in vitro cleavage with purified cathepsin L. Nipah F 0 was not cleaved to F 1 and F 2 in the absence of cathepsin L (Fig. 4A, lane 5) . However, in the presence of cathepsin L, Nipah F 0 was efficiently digested to two products consistent in size to the F 1 + F 2 heterodimer by 4 h, with the amount of processing increasing with time (Fig. 4A , lanes 6-9). Even in the presence of cathepsin L for 8 h, a fraction of immunopurified uncleaved Nipah F remained undigested, suggesting the presence of an uncleavable form of F 0 possibly due to aggregation of unfolded protein during sample preparation. Therefore, the Nipah F protein is a physiologically relevant substrate for cathepsin L digestion.",

Finally, both purified cathepsin L and B were able to digest immunopurified uncleaved Nipah F protein; however, cathepsin B appeared to cleave Nipah F 0 incorrectly (Fig. 4) .

            "text": "Cathepsin L has historically been thought of as a degradative enzyme (Turk and Guncar, 2003) . However, recent reports describe cathepsin L as a proteolytic processing enzyme involved in protein maturation. For example, cathepsin L proteolytically cleaves the CDP/CUX transcription factor (Goulet et al., 2004) , enkephalin prohormone (Yasothornsrikul et al., 2003) , and a number of viral proteins (Chandran et al., 2005; Ebert et al., 2002; Pager and Dutch, 2005; Simmons et al., 2005) . Although cathepsin L does not appear to have an identifiable substrate recognition site, the protease is thought to prefer hydrophobic residues at P2 and P3 substrate sites (Turk and Guncar, 2003 ). Yet, despite this lack of specificity, cathepsin L has been shown to specifically cleave proenkephalin at dibasic and monobasic cleavage sites (Yasothornsrikul et al., 2003) . Cleavage of both Nipah F and Hendra F proteins is predicted to occur after a single basic residue. However, site-directed mutagenesis of individual amino acids immediately upstream of the cleavage site within Nipah F and Hendra F proteins did not ablate Henipavirus F processing, demonstrating that no single residue is required for efficient cleavage (Craft and Dutch, 2005; Moll et al., 2004) . Indeed, cleavage was only abolished following deletion of six amino acids immediately upstream of the Nipah F cleavage site (Moll et al., 2004) . The ability of cathepsin L to cleave Nipah F correlates with a nebulous cleavage motif within Nipah F and proteolytic processing at arginine 109 .",

            "text": "The ubiquitously expressed cathepsin L and B have been described to proteolytically process viral proteins, thus promoting entry of both nonenveloped and enveloped viruses. Cathepsin L and B were first described to facilitate entry of nonenveloped reoviruses after receptor-mediated endocytosis by degrading the outer capsid proteins to form infectious subvirion particles capable of transversing the endosomal membrane (Ebert et al., 2002) . During exocytic transport, the Ebola virus GP is proteolytically cleaved by furin to GP 1 and GP 2 (Volchkov et al., 1998) . However, entry of enveloped Ebola virus requires that GP 1 is further processed by cathepsin B and/or L (Chandran et al., 2005) . Finally, a role for both cathepsin L and extracellular proteases generated by lung inflammatory cells in maturation of the SARS coronavirus spike (S) protein was recently described (Matsuyama et al., 2005; Simmons et al., 2005 ). An endocytosis motif present within the cytoplasmic tail of Henipavirus F proteins promotes proteolytic activation within the acid environment of the endosome Meulendyke et al., 2005; Vogt et al., 2005) , where cathepsin L was recently shown to be involved in proteolytic processing of the Hendra virus F protein (Pager and Dutch, 2005) . Our results demonstrate that Nipah F proteolytic maturation requires cathepsin L digestion. Despite endogenous cathepsin B enzyme activity in cathepsin L shRNA-expressing Vero cells and cathepsin L\u2212/\u2212 MEFs, proteolytic processing and fusion activity of Nipah F were severely debilitated in these cells, strongly indicating that cathepsin L (and not cathepsin B) is required for maturation and fusion activity of the Nipah virus F protein. Purified cathepsin B can cleave immunopurified Nipah F precursor protein into two fragments, but the smaller digested product migrated slower than an endogenously produced F 2 fragment. The cellular mechanism of how Nipah F is localized to endosomal compartments containing cathepsin L and/or B is unknown and it is also unclear how incorrect processing is prevented in these compartments. These questions warrant further investigation.",

Viral entry of Ebola virus and SARS coronavirus following endocytic uptake and digestion of fusion proteins by endosomal cathepsin proteases may be an additional entry strategy used by enveloped viruses (Chandran et al., 2005; Simmons et al., 2005) . Paramyxovirusmediated fusion is thought to exclusively occur at the plasma membrane (Earp et al., 2004) . Nipah F mediates membrane fusion at neutral pH (Moll et al., 2004 ), yet Nipah virions may be taken up into cells by endocytosis (Vogt et al., 2005) , and proteolytic activation of the F protein by cathepsin L occurs within an acidic endosomal compartment Meulendyke et al., 2005; Pager and Dutch, 2005) .

At 24 h posttransfection, BSR cells were overlaid onto the effector cells, incubated for 3 h and fusion activity quantified as a measure of luciferase activity. Background values were ascribed to cells expressing only the attachment protein Nipah G and then subtracted from the values for Nipah F + G (\u00b1 cathepsin L). Luciferase activity of triplicate samples measured in duplicate was reported, and assays were repeated 3-6 times.",

Vero cells expressing either no shRNA or Scramble-, Cath L98-, or Cath L662-shRNA were transfected with Nipah F, and expression and proteolytic processing analyzed by metabolic labeling and immunoprecipitation as previously described. (B) Luciferase reporter gene assay. Nipah F, Nipah G, and a T7 luciferase reporter gene plasmid were transfected into shRNA-expressing Vero cells. BSR cells, which stably express T7 polymerase, were overlaid onto the Nipah F and G-transfected Vero cells for 3 h at 37\u00b0C. Cells were lysed and luciferase activity was measured. The results presented are representative of three separate experiments, with Nipah G alone set as the background value. Cell-cell fusion values from Cath L98-and Cath L662-expressing Vero cells were normalized to fusion values within Scramble shRNA-expressing cells.",
