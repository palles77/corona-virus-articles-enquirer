            "text": "extension. Reliable estimates place the R0 value of the COVID-19 in 1.4-2.5, similar to the R0 of the coronavirus SARS at the beginning of the epidemic (2.2-3.7). This value was reduced to an R0 of 0.67-1.23 at the end of the epidemic. By contrast, the coronavirus MERS has always remained at lower R0 values (0.29-0.80). 4 It seems that the COVID-19 could be more easily transmitted than SARS. However, there is a need to exercise caution. The R0 value indicates the transmission potential of an infectious disease. A higher R0 does not mean a more extensive disease. The flu, for example, whose R0 value ranges around 1.3 each year, infects millions of people worldwide. Neither does the R0 indicate the transmission rate either. R0 is also an average value: there are people who, although infected, will not transmit the disease to anyone, while others may transmit it to many more people. These individuals, called \u00absuper-spreaders\u00bb, were protagonists of two extraordinary events during the SARS epidemic in Toronto (Canada) and MERS in Seoul (South Korea) when, from one patient who was a \u00absuper-spreader\u00bb, dozens of patients, visitors and health personnel from two hospitals were infected. Control measures, such as those used in China, can significantly reduce the R0 of a disease. In this initial phase of the COVID-19 epidemic, its R0 value is being estimated from multiple assumptions and using complex mathematical models. As epidemiologists, some of us approach these mathematical models with circumspect: a popular saying states \u00abAll the models are wrong, but some are useful\u00bb.",

            "text": "This saying also applies to another controversial parameter appearing at the start of all epidemics: the number of real cases. Current statistics, without entering into discussions about the Chinese authorities' communication policy or transparency, probably reflect a bias towards the most severe cases which are the most likely to have reached out to the health system. Numbers for mild cases and asymptomatic cases are likely to be lower than reality. In recent weeks the detection capacity (RT-PCR test) of infected patients in the epidemic zone has increased, and this fact could partly explain the increase in case numbers, although many patients may still be undiagnosed. This possibility leads to the discussion about the estimation of the fatality rate of this disease, which currently stands at around 2.0%, with more than 40,000 cases and 1000 deaths. 5 The mortality rate for SARS was around 10%, so the disease caused by COVID-19 seems, for now, to be less severe.",

Symptomatic patients produce the majority of infections, however there may be infections from asymptomatic patients and even from people in the incubation period of the disease, although some initial data provided have proved to be mistaken. 6, 7 This type of transmission, although less frequent, would further complicate disease control.",

[8] [9] [10] [11] Clinically it seems that the disease affects slightly more men (50-60%), who are middle aged, with underlying illnesses and who, at the beginning of the epidemic, were exposed to the animal market of Huanan (Wuhan). The incubation period is around 5 days (range: 4-7 days) with a maximum of 12-13 days. The most common symptoms are fever, cough, dyspnea and myalgia or fatigue. About 20% of patients present severe complications, the most frequent being pneumonia and adult respiratory distress syndrome. 80% of complicated cases are persons over 60 years of age. More data are needed to be able to consider this clinical condition as standard, since these data mostly correspond to the initial severe cases, the only ones published to date.

China, the world's second economic power, is a very large country with 1.4 billion inhabitants. China is ranked 153, out of a total of 167 countries, in the Democracy Index. 16 The Chinese government will place a large part of its world prestige on the line if it fails to adequately control this epidemic and if it does not openly share current and updated data of the epidemic, its progress, its doubts and its problems with the rest of the world. From a scientific point of view, there has been greater speed and transparency than there was in 2002-2003 with SARS, but there are reasonable doubts about some of the information provided and decisions taken initially by the Chinese local health authorities, mostly subject to political power. The city of Wuhan is a great communications hub: more than one million people enter and leave by train every day and its airport supports an annual traffic of more than 27 million people. It is estimated that, due to the Chinese Lunar New Year, more than 300,000 people left Wuhan shortly before the government implemented internal movement restrictions. China is a country much more connected to the world today than it was in 2002, when it hid the outbreak of the SARS epidemic for weeks. The Chinese megaproject called the Belt and Road initiative will connect highways, ports and high-speed trains to almost two-thirds of the world's population, including more than 70 countries. The connection of China with several countries in sub-Saharan Africa is especially critical, where the capacity to respond effectively to health threats is low and health systems are very insubstantial. There are more than one million Chinese expatriate citizens working in Africa today. The connecting routes of the Belt and Road Initiative could also be the expansion and extension routes of any epidemic if it is not quickly controlled at source, now and in the future. The economic impact of any epidemic is considerable, but in this case it could reach an unprecedented magnitude. According to some estimates, a fall of 0.5-1% of China's GDP could occur in 2020. Without a doubt, this would be noticed by the whole world.",

The preventive actions derive from classical epidemiology: detect, isolate and treat the cases and monitor any possible contacts. The current epidemiological and clinical criteria will most probably change during the course of the epidemic. However it is essential to continue to adhere to the criteria to optimise the detection of possible cases and the use of resources to deal with this threat, especially at the height of the flu season.
