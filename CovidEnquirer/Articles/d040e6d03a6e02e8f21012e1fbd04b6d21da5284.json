Suckling piglets under 2 weeks of age showed severe vomiting and watery yellowish diarrhea with morbidity and mortality ranging from 80 to 100% and 90 to 100%, respectively. A total of 68 samples from 25 pig farms were confirmed as positive for PEDV and negative for rotavirus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus by reverse transcription PCR, and the partial S gene of PEDV was analyzed. Phylogenetic analysis places all 18 Taiwanese PEDV isolates collected during this outbreak in the same clade as the US strains of PEDV. This novel PEDV is prevailing and currently causing severe outbreaks in Taiwan.",

PEDVs belong to the genus Alphacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae and order Nidovirales. Other members of this subgroup include human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E, HCoV NL63 and Bats coronavirus 512/05 [8] . Although PEDV was first identified in Europe, it has become increasingly problematic in many Asian countries [6] and North America [7] . However, there is no retrospective study on the emergence of PEDV in Taiwan. Pigs of all ages can be affected and can exhibit degrees of diarrhea and loss of appetite, which vary according to age. In suckling piglets that exhibit watery diarrhea, dehydration with milk curd vomitus and thin-walled intestines with severe villus atrophy and congestion, PEDVs are associated with disease. The disease can progress to death within a few days. The outbreak is distinguished by a nearly 100% prevalence of illness among piglets after birth and death rates of 80-100%. Boars and sows with mild diarrhea, vomiting and anorexia for a few days were reported to recover within a week [6, 7] .",

Microscopically, marked enterocyte exfoliation and vacuolation consistent with villi atrophy and blunt were observed in the jejunum and ileum sections. Additionally, the clinical specimens were collected and tested for rotavirus [3] , transmissible gastroenteritis virus [4] and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus [5] .

Clustal W using the MegAlign program (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, U.S.A.). The phylogenetic analyses were conducted with the maximum likelihood method using MEGA 5, version 5.05. All 18 PEDV isolates collected from this outbreak shared 99.5-100% DNA sequence identity of the partial S gene. Two major clusters, based on the phylogenetic relation of the partial nucleotide sequences of the COE domain in the S gene, were detected(Fig. 1). The first cluster was comprised of prototype isolates (TW1/A/2013 and TW2/B/2013) and Chinese strains LJB/03 and DX/2007. The second cluster consisted of all 18 Taiwanese isolates from this outbreak and 7 US isolates(Fig. 1). One nonsynonymous mutation was observed in recent Taiwanese PEDV strains and US strains at nucleotide positions 1,540-1,542 (GTA) of the S gene compared with PEDV CV777 (GTC), PEDV AH2012 (GTC) or the Taiwanese prototype strains TW1/A/2013 and TW2/B/2013 (GTC; Data not shown). Our findings demonstrate that the recent PEDV isolates in Taiwan were genetically similar to US PEDV strains rather than Chinese strains within the COE domain.",
