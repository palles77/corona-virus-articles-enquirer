Due to the polyanionic nature of nucleic acids, metal ions in solutions are crucial to the loop folding thermodynamics. Here, we use the previously developed tightly bound ion theory [1,2] to quantify the contributions of Na \u00fe and Mg 2\u00fe to the loop thermodynamics, where the loop conformational ensembles are produced based on the virtual-bond model [3]. The predicted loop thermodynamics are strongly dependent on loop length, endto-end distance, and Na \u00fe /Mg 2\u00fe concentrations. Based on the calculations, we derive the empirical formulas for the loop thermodynamic parameters as functions of chain length, end-to-end distance, and Na \u00fe /Mg 2\u00fe concentrations. For the three specific loops, namely, hairpin, bulge, and internal loops, the predicted entropies agree with the experimental data at standard salt (1M Na \u00fe ). Furthermore, we apply the calculated loop free energy to predict RNA hairpin stability in Na \u00fe /Mg 2\u00fe solutions. The results show good agreement with available experimental data. We find that both helix and loop can cause significant salt-dependence for the hairpin stability.",

At near-neutral reaction pH (6.0 -8.0), branched polyaniline formed on the surface of TMV prevented lateral association and therefore long 1D nanofibers were observed with high aspect ratios and excellent processibility. At a lower pH (4.0-5.0), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis revealed that initially long nanofibers were formed and upon long reaction time resulted in bundled structures. This association of single nanofibers to form bundled structures is presumably mediated by the hydrophobic interaction of polyaniline on the surface of these composite nanofibers. In-situ time-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering study on the formation of polyaniline/TMV composite nanofibers at two different reaction pH conditions (5.1 and 6.5) supported our mechanism. The polyaniline layer formed on the external surface of TMV is thicker for reaction at pH 5.1 than for reaction at pH 6.5. This novel strategy to assemble TMV into well-organized composites could be utilized in the fabrication of advanced materials for potential applications including electronics, optics, sensing, and biomedical engineering.",

Here we report on experiments in this intermediate response regime. The studies were performed with nanoindentation techniques using an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM), an approach which is becoming a standard method to measure the mechanical properties of viral particles (1, 2) . Capsids of the Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) were used as a model system. This virus was chosen because its capsid is made up out of many copies of a single protein and it can form in either a T\u00bc3 or a T\u00bc4 morphology. After a certain indentation both capsid types show permanent plastic deformations in their structures and the mechanics of this deformation can be described by the F\u20ac opplvon K arm an (FvK) number. It is shown that the experimental observations match the expected behaviour as deduced from simulations (3) . Overall the two morphologies possess the same mechanical characteristics, but a slight difference in deformation characteristics is predicted by theoretical considerations on the difference in FvK number. We are able to observe this difference experimentally, which illustrates the resolution of our approach.",

            "text": "Phi 29 bacteriophage infects the bacterium B. subtilis. During infection Phi 29 packs its newly produced DNA into an empty capsid, against a very high pressure of ca. 50 atm. For this purpose, a packaging machine containing five ATPase units, six pRNAs and a head-tail connector translocates the DNA into the capsid. The ATPase units provide energy for the translocation, the connector has a portal to the capsid and the pRNAs connect the ATPs with the connector. For the role of the connector during packaging three mechanisms have been proposed so far. One suggests a nut-bolt like packaging of the DNA. In the second one, the connector acts as a torrsion spring driving the DNA in a ratchet like fashion. According to the third proposed mechanism, the connector is a valve preventing the packed DNA from leaving, without any active parts at all. Using molecular dynamics simulations of the connector in complex with DNA, and aiming at distinguishing between these three models, we calculated mechanical properties of this system. First we calculated a spring constant and potential for the torsion around the connector axis. Comparing the potential energy of the torsion with ATP hydrolysis energy help to decide whether the connector is too rigid for the torrsion spring mechanism or not. Second we have pulled the DNA through the connector's portal to decide whether the connector has an active part in DNA translocation.",

While models describing the organization of these isolated structures have been proposed, there is a lack of complementary structural evidence in the literature. Through cryo-EM analysis of this phage, we are gaining a better understanding of its assembly and organization. There is a prominent surface feature present at the quasi 3-fold axes corresponding to the cementing protein gpD that is positioned directly over the covalent cross-linking portion of the docked HK97 crystal structure, suggesting an evolutionary replacement of this gene product by a chemical autocatalytic cross-link in HK97. Asymmetric reconstructions of both the empty and fully packaged lambda phage have provided three-dimensional views of the phage interior in the presence and absence of packaged DNA, as well as how the tail assembly is attached to the capsid. A comparison between central slices of the asymmetric wild type and empty particles show clear density depicting the dsDNA and portal proteins, along with evidence that upon completion of packaging, a plug-like gene product or conformational change of the portal closes the portal opening.",

The initial entry is usually classified as fusogenic or endocytotic. However binding of viral spikes to cell surface receptors not only initiates the viral adhesion and the wrapping process necessary for internalization, but can simultaneously initiate direct fusion with the cell membrane. Both fusion and internalization have been observed to be viable pathways for many viruses. We develop a stochastic model for viral entry that incorporates a competition between receptor mediated fusion and endocytosis. The relative probabilities of fusion and endocytosis of a virus particle initially nonspecifically adsorbed on the host cell membrane are computed as functions of receptor concentration, binding strength, and number of spikes. We find different parameter regimes where the entry pathway probabilities can be analytically expressed. Experimental tests of our mechanistic hypotheses are proposed and discussed. was observed. A high salt buffer rinse reversed the conformational change. These results suggest a mechanism by which Gag extension is possible only once bound to the plasma membrane and in the presence of the viral genome. This provides a picture consistent with earlier in vivo and solution studies. A detailed understanding of the viral particle assembly process may elucidate susceptible points providing opportunities to inhibit proper virus formation.",

Using a coarse-grained model for DNA and capsid we performed simulations of DNA packaging inside bacteriophages of different shape and size. We found that the final DNA conformations depend on the size and shape of the capsid, as well as the size of the protein portal, if any. In particular, isometric capsids with small or absent portals tend to form concentric spools, whereas the presence of a large portal favors coaxial spooling; slightly and highly elongated capsids result in folded and twisted toroidal conformations, respectively. By introducing several order parameters and analyzing the conformations of linear polymers confined inside irregular closed cavities over a wide range of packing densities we found that the ordering of DNA to its fully packed structure occurs through two transitions: The first transition is associated with the formation of the global patterns. The second transition corresponds to the loss of mobility and disappearance of the undulations of DNA strands. ",

Second, the axial rise per subunit for this helix is particularly small, whilst having a large diameter.

We present a novel method for creating three-dimensional finite element meshes of viral capsids from both atomic data from PDB files and electron density data from EM files. The meshes capture heterogeneous geometric features and are used in conjunction with threedimensional continuum elasticity to simulate nanoindentation experiments as performed using atomic force microscopy. The method is extremely flexible; able to produce meshes with varying levels of coarseness, in addition to being able to capture varying levels of detail in the three-dimensional structure. Meshes and nanoindentation simulations are presented for several viruses: Hepatitis B, CCMV, HK97, and Phi 29. In addition to purely continuum elastic models, for those viruses with atomic coordinate information available, a multiscale technique is developed that combines the coarseness of the three-dimensional meshes with the atomic level forces calculated from an atomic force-field, using a mathematical mapping scheme. In this way, large-scale deformations such as nanoindentation are simulated without the cumbersome nature of other all-atom simulations, such as molecular dynamics. Simulations of these capsid deformation experiments provide a testing ground for the techniques, as well as insight into the strengthdetermining mechanisms of capsid deformation. These methods can be extended as a framework for modeling other proteins and macromolecular structures in cell biology. ",

Individual Gag molecules contain several domains connected by flexible linkers. Early cryo-EM data showed Gag in the immature virus as elongated rods radial from the membrane with one termini tightly bound to the viral genome [Current Biology, 1997 (7) p.729]. However, in vitro assembly with purified Gag incubated with nucleic acids, forms virus particles significantly smaller in radius than the natural virion [J. Virology, 1999 (73) p.2270]. Furthermore, solution measurements using SANS and other techniques suggest a compact structure for Gag [J. Mol. Biol. 2007 (365) p. 812]. These studies indicate large conformational changes in the Gag protein must occur concomitant with virus assembly. The dimension of Gag bound to the bilayer interface was determined at high resolution by neutron reflectometry. The bio-mimetic environment for observing Gag association consisted of a supported membrane attached to a gold surface via a PEO tether. The membrane was a ternary composition of DMPS:DMPC:Cholesterol lipids capturing key characteristics of the viral lipodome.

Simulation methods provide a valuable adjunct to experimental work in understanding self-assembly by allowing us to perform model-assisted interpretation of assembly systems too complex for detailed experimental dissection and to extrapolate results from in vitro experimental systems to the cellular environment. Unfortunately, it remains computationally intractable to simulate detailed self-assembly dynamics within several biologically important parameter domains, including long time scales needed to understand some in vitro assembly models and dense crowding conditions relevant to in vivo assembly. We have developed simulation methods based on stochastic models of reaction chemistry aimed at extending feasible parameter domains in these biologically important directions.

The force versus distance profiles of assembling SNAREpins reveal that SNARE motifs begin to interact when the membranes are 8 nm apart. Even after very close approach of the bilayers ( 2-4 nm), the SNAR-Epins remain partly unstructured in their membrane-proximal region.
