            "text": "Hepatitis is defined as any inflammatory cell infiltrate within the hepatic parenchyma, and the term cholangiohepatitis describes extension of that inflammation to include the intrahepatic bile ducts. 1 A diagnosis of these conditions is based on histopathologic examination of hepatic biopsy specimens. The histopathologic appearance will give clues as to the duration of the inflammation. Acute hepatitis is characterized by a combination of inflammation, hepatocellular apoptosis, necrosis, and possibly regeneration, but there is a lack of fibrosis. Chronic hepatitis (CH), on the other hand, is identified by the presence of fibrosis, proliferation of ductular structures, and regenerative nodules in addition to the inflammatory infiltrate. 2 The type of inflammatory cellular infiltrate may give the clinician some clues regarding the etiology. Occasionally, etiologic agents will be identified within biopsy specimens. However, the etiology remains unknown for many cases of hepatitis and cholangiohepatitis in dogs and cats. This chapter will discuss the clinical presentation of animals with hepatitis and cholangiohepatitis and outline the most commonly recognized clinical syndromes with respect to diagnosis and treatment of the specific disease. Effective treatment of patients with hepatitis or cholangiohepatitis includes specific therapy of any identified inciting cause and aggressive symptomatic and supportive therapy. A discussion of symptomatic treatment and supportive therapy for the sequelae of hepatitis and cholangiohepatitis can be found in Chapter 127, Hepatic Failure.",

Exposure to certain etiologic agents or toxins may be ascertained from the owner and history and thus raise the suspicion for hepatic involvement. It is important to remember that because of the large reserve capacity of the liver, a short duration of clinical signs does not necessarily indicate acute disease. Animals with CH may not show outward clinical signs until a significant portion of their hepatic function is affected. Presenting owner complaints for animals with hepatitis may include vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, lethargy, polyuria, polydipsia, abdominal distention, dysuria, neurologic abnormalities associated with hepatic encephalopathy or vascular accidents, and icterus.",

Experimental studies have suggested many mechanisms of hepatocellular injury, but their specific evaluation in dogs and cats with hepatitis is lacking. Mechanisms of hepatocellular injury that are not specific to hepatitis include tissue hypoxia, lipid peroxidation, intracellular cofactor depletion, intracellular toxin production, cholestatic injury, endotoxic insults, and hepatocyte plasma membrane injury. 3 Hepatocytes are especially susceptible to anoxia because the liver receives a mixture of venous and arterial blood. Hypoxic damage quickly leads to plasma membrane and cytosolic organelle injury secondary to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion. Free radicals may cause oxidative cellular injury that can result in lipid peroxidation and subsequent plasma membrane damage.",

TNF-a, production of which is induced by the interaction of the costimulatory molecules CD154 on T cells and CD40 on hepatocytes and Kupffer cells, stimulates hepatocyte apoptosis through the Fas-Fas ligand pathway. 4 A better understanding of the complex mechanisms of hepatocellular injury in animals with hepatitis may encourage the development of novel therapeutic modalities for affected patients.",

This disease can be seen in both acute and chronic stages. In the acute stage, edema and neutrophilic inflammation may extend into the portal areas. In the chronic stage, a mixed inflammatory infiltrate may be noted in portal areas, along with varying degrees of fibrosis and bile duct hyperplasia. This syndrome was previously referred to as acute cholangiohepatitis or suppurative cholangitis-cholangiohepatitis. 8, 9 Extrapolating from data using other classification schemes, it is likely that affected cats will be young to middle-aged with a male predisposition. Duration of illness is usually short (<5 days). Anorexia, weight loss, lethargy, and vomiting are common. Many cats are febrile and most animals have elevated serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activity at the time of presentation, with fewer numbers having elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity. Icterus is present in over 50% of cases. Cholangiohepatitis in cats has been associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and pancreatitis, 10 and many investigators believe that NC is the result of an ascending bacterial infection from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. However, bacterial organisms have been isolated inconsistently from cases reported in the literature. When isolated, common bacterial species include Escherichia coli, Enterococcus spp, Clostridium spp, Bacteroides spp, Actinomyces spp, and Streptococcus spp. Hepatic tissue, bile, or both should be submitted for aerobic and anaerobic culture as part of the diagnostic workup for any cat suspected of having hepatitis. Treatment with a broad-spectrum antibiotic combination aimed at enteric flora is recommended pending results of culture and sensitivity testing. Prognosis for cats with NC is typically good with aggressive treatment, although sequelae may include bile duct obstruction, acute necrotizing pancreatitis, sepsis, and multiple organ dysfunction.",

Inflammation within the walls or lumens of intrahepatic bile ducts may be present, but is not a specific hallmark of the disease.

Elevations of serum ALT, ALP, and total bilirubin are common as in NC, but cats with LC tend to have higher ALP than those with NC. The etiology of LC is unknown, although a chronic response to an ascending bacterial infection from GI flora and an association with IBD and pancreatitis (as seen with NC) has been suggested. 8, 9 Active infection has been rarely documented in cats with LC. Treatment typically involves immunosuppressive glucocorticoid therapy in animals with no evidence of infection.

Histologic lesions include multifocal necrosis (often around blood vessels) with associated infiltration with neutrophils and macrophages. Pyogranulomatous lesions may be noted on the liver capsule. 12 When hepatic involvement occurs, the disease is uniformly fatal. Because there is no definitive treatment, supportive care is the mainstay of treatment. Although cats are generally resistant to leptospirosis, experimental infection with L. pomona has caused hepatic lesions in this species. 3 Patients with hepatic involvement will show elevated levels of hepatic enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP), although ALP is often most severely affected. Hyperbilirubinemia and signs of hepatic failure may occur. Diagnosis of leptospirosis is usually based on clinical suspicion due to renal and hepatic involvement combined with serologic evidence of infection. However, antibody titers may be negative during the first week of infection, and antibody production may persist for only 2 to 6 weeks. 3 Suspected patients with negative antibody titers and a short duration of illness should be treated as though they have leptospirosis, and antibody titers should be repeated in 2 weeks. Histopathologic changes in the liver of affected animals may include coagulative necrosis and infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells with lesser numbers of neutrophils and macrophages. Organisms may be identified in biopsy specimens with silver staining, but this is very insensitive. Molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are likely to make this diagnosis less challenging in the future. Optimal treatment includes penicillin to eliminate the leptospiremic stage, followed by doxycycline or enrofloxacin to eliminate the carrier state.

            "text": "The main histologic lesion associated with toxic hepatic injury is diffuse centrilobular necrosis. Depending on the temporal relationship between toxin ingestion and tissue biopsy, necrosis may be accompanied by apoptosis or inflammation. Lymphocytic or plasmacytic cellular infiltrates may occur later in the course of disease and have been described commonly with amiodarone, 2 carprofen, 2 and lomustine 23 intoxications. Phenobarbital, primidone, and phenytoin may cause CH that can progress to cirrhosis with prolonged use. Several other drugs reported to cause hepatitis are noted in Box 126-1, but this is by no means an exhaustive list. Treatment involves removal of the offending agent and aggressive supportive care. S-Adenosylmethionine (SAMe) (20 mg/kg PO q24h) has been effective in treating acetaminophen toxicity. 24,25 Although its efficacy against other forms of hepatotoxicity has not been evaluated, it is a logical choice for supportive care in animals suffering any hepatotoxic insult, mainly because of its ability to increase hepatic glutathione levels.",
