Blocking of this co-receptor and CD14 inhibited the binding of LTA and LTA-induced TNF-a release by human monocytes (Nilsen et al., 2008) . Further research is required to determine if PRCV infection induces increased expression of LTA receptors such as TLR-2 and CD36, as has been shown for CD14 (Van Gucht et al., 2006) . In general, the mechanisms through which Gram-positive bacteria effect host immunological activation are less clearly understood than for Gram-negative infections (Sriskandan and Cohen, 1999; Draing et al., 2008) .",

Our finding that up to 81% of the total BALF cells were neutrophils in LTA-inoculated pigs indicates that this bacterial component may be highly effective in activating pulmonary neutrophil infiltration in this species. A similar rapid influx of neutrophils into the milk of cows occurs following inoculation of 10-100 lg LTA into the mammary gland (Rainard et al., 2008) . In this study the neutrophil influx was accompanied by increased secretion of TNF-a and IL-1b and of chemokines like CXCL-2 and IL-8. In the current study, the finding that the total BALF cell count and neutrophil percentages in the PRCV-LTA pigs were slightly, though not significantly, lower than in LTA-inoculated animals during the first 8 h PI may possibly have been due to their more rapid and effective destruction in the dually-inoculated pigs (Medan et al., 2002; Fuchs et al., 2007; Zhang et al., 2008) .",

Histamine can interact with LPS in the expression of cyclo-oxygenase-2 and of prostaglandin I 2 and E 2 by human endothelial cells (Tan et al., 2007) and can also increase the sensitivity of these cells to the effects of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria through inducing the expression of TLR-2, TLR-4 (Talreja et al., 2004) , IL-8 and IL-6 (Li et al., 2001) .
