Conventional methods for the definitive diagnosis of viral infections consist of culture isolation and serologic confirmation of the etiologic agents. Alternatively, determination of antibody rise in patient sera taken during the acute and convalescent stages of infection may help in the diagnosis of virus infection, although the information may be too late for patient management.",

EM can identify both infectious and noninfectious virus particles as well as those viruses that are unable to replicate in conventional cell cultures. EM identification of virus is based on virus morphology and the ultrastructure of virus-cell interaction; it is not restricted by the narrow specificity of viral test reagents used in most rapid immunodiagnostic methods. Furthermore, conventional methods for identification of virus isolates often rely on their biological and antigenic properties. In some instances, a virus isolate does not possess classical characteristics useful for identification but instead has unusual properties, which make identification more difficult when conventional methods are used. In such situations, the use of electron microscopy has provided an alternative approach to rapid and accurate diagnosis.",

It is the method of choice for rapid identification of virus particles in clinical specimens because of its simplicity, rapidity, and high resolution. A suspension of the clinical specimen is deposited on to a Formvar membrane-coated specimen grid and then stained with a 1-2 percent aqueous heavy metal salt solution, such as sodium or potassium salt of phosphotungstic acid (PTA), at pH 6-7. Afterward the specimen is dried and irradiated by ultraviolet light to inactivate the virus. The grid is then ready to be examined. Fluid specimens containing a high titer of virus particles, such as vesicle fluid, stool extract, and serum, are suitable for direct examination using the NS technique. The entire procedure requires approximately 30 minutes. The limitation of this technique is the need for a large number of virus particles (.106/ml) in the specimen in order to detect the virus. Various methods have been developed to increase virus concentration and hence the sensitivity of the technique.",

Pellets are resuspended in distilled water, which helps to lyse cellular structures but leaves the virus intact.

Immune serum containing specific antibodies to the particular virus suspected is mixed with the specimen, followed by one hour of incubation at room temperature in order to allow antigen-antibody reaction to take place. Virus particles form aggregates by reaction with their homologous antibody. Small virus particles such as Norwalk virus [12] and hepatitis A virus [13] from feces often require use of this technique in order to facilitate the detection and differentiation of the virus particles from background materials. The virus-antiserum mixture can be further concentrated by agar-gel diffusion or ultracentrifugation, as described above. Alternatively, the antiserum can be first absorbed to the grid as a solid phase, after which the virus is applied to the grid and then permitted to form antigen-antibody complexes for visualization [14] .",

EM provides a method for rapid, accurate laboratory diagnosis of virus infection and thus for proper patient management. Although smallpox has been eradicated, other poxviruses, such as vaccinia virus, can cause generalized infection in immunocompromised hosts and require immediate diagnosis. The In the early 1970s, several groups of investigators simultaneously discovered, by electron microscopic examination, a new virus agent named \"rotavirus,\" which was responsible for many cases of infantile gastroenteritis [22, 23] . EM was the only method for rotavirus detection during those years.

Outbreaks have occurred in recreational camps, on cruise ships, in schools, and in nursing homes as a result of drinking or swimming in contaminated water or eating uncooked shellfish [31] [32] [33] . Identification of Norwalk virus is done initially by immune electron microscopy (IEM), using convalescent serum containing antibody to Norwalk virus [ 12] . Virus in Urine Specimens Cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been frequently isolated from urine specimens of children with congenital infection [34] , of immunocompromised patients (including organ transplant recipients), and of patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Isolation of the virus in cell cultures requires from several days to weeks before signs of virus activity become evident. CMV can be directly observed by EM examination, using NS [35, 36] or thin sectioning [37] . CMV particles in urine specimens are usually in low concentration; therefore, it is necessary to concentrate the urine specimens by ultracentrifugation. As a supplemental method to tissue-culture isolation, EM can provide a rapid diagnosis of CMV infection. Now CMV early antigen can be rapidly detected (within 16 hours after incubation of the centrifugation culture) [38] ; this technique has an advantage over EM because it is easily adapted in smaller clinical laboratories that lack an EM.",

Observation of Virusfrom Lung, Liver, and Other Organs Adenovirus is often isolated from lung and other organs of immunocompromised patients. Adenovirus-infected cells in various tissues show intranuclear inclusions when examined under the light microscope. Adenovirus inclusions can be mistaken for CMV inclusions. To distinguish CMV from adenovirus, EM examination is the preferred method. One of our early experiences in the diagnosis of adenovirus infection occurred when a chronic myelogenous leukemia patient, who had received a bone marrow transplant, developed a rapidly fatal gastroenteritis. Histopathologic examination by light microscopy revealed what looked like CMV intranuclear inclusions in the cells of liver, lungs, and small bowel tissues and was diagnosed as CMV infection by pathologists. Postmortem specimens were also processed for EM and virus isolation in cell cultures. EM examination revealed virus particles that resembled adenovirus but not CMV in the nuclei of infected liver cells (Fig. 4B) . Virus isolation showed that this isolate had a broad spectrum of cell susceptibility; it replicated in many types of cell cultures, including primary guinea pig embryo cells, resembling that property of herpes simplex virus (HSV) [43, 44] . By tissue-culture neutralization test, however, the final identification of this virus isolate was adenovirus type 2. In this case, EM identification was the key to an accurate diagnosis of this adenovirus infection.",

            "text": "In a routine diagnostic virology laboratory, most of the virus isolates can be identified by their biological properties, such as the appearance of cytopathic changes, hemagglutination activity to avian or mammalian red blood cells, or by antigenic properties, using group-and type-specific antiserum. In some cases, however, identification of isolates possessing unusual properties can be difficult. EM has often provided rapid identification of those viruses with unusual properties. Identification of Unusual HSVIsolates by EM HSV is the most common virus isolate encountered in clinical specimens today. Since the availability of monoclonal antibody for typing of HSV-1 and HSV-2 by immunofluorescence assay (IFA), the identification of HSV isolates has become a simpler and easier task than ever before. Once the characteristic CPE of HSV is observed, confirmatory typing by IFA can be made immediately. In our experience during the last two and a half years, however, among 682 HSV isolates, there were two HSV isolates which were untypable by use of monoclonal antibody to HSV-1 and HSV-2. These two isolates were finally identified by EM and confirmed by IFA, using polyclonal antibody to HSV. According to EM observation, one of the HSV isolates was type 2, based on the presence of intranuclear fiber structures similar to the characteristics of HSV-2 structure (Fig. 6) previously reported [49, 50] . This result ;Ql~.w W.'' was reconfirmed by use of the selective inhibition of (E)-5(2-bromovinyl)-2'deoxyuridine [51] . In cases of HSV isolates that are not identifiable by monoclonal antibody to either type of HSV by IFA, EM would be very useful as a supplemental method for HSV identification. Detection ofEndogenous Agents in Cell Culture For virus isolation, clinical specimens are routinely inoculated into susceptible cell-culture systems. Primary cell cultures derived from monkeys or other animals often harbor viruses of their own. Primary monkey kidney cells frequently contain simian virus type 5 (SV-5), simian virus type 40 (SV-40), herpesvirus, cytomegalovirus, and adenovirus of simian origin [52] . It is important that a virologist be aware of the presence of such endogenous viruses in cell cultures being used for clinical specimens.",

In specimens containing a large number of virus particles, such as vesicular fluid and stool extracts, EM examination of negative-stained preparations can provide a rapid diagnosis within an hour. In specimens with a low virus yield such as urine, various methods of concentration can be applied to the specimens and the diagnosis obtained within two hours. For virus isolates with unusual biologic and antigenic properties or unknown etiology, EM can provide a rapid identification of the virus group based on morphological characteristics. For those viruses which cannot be cultivated in cell cultures, EM is the method of choice for their detection. Endogenous viral agents and/or mycoplasma contaminants in cell cultures often produce adverse effects on the routine use of cell cultures for clinical specimens. By employing EM, rapid detection of such contaminants is possible.",
