Chemical probing experiments have been done both in the presence and absence of the initiator tRNA with dimethyl sulfate, kethoxal and carbodiimide as reagent probes. As an mRNA, a mini-mRNA containing the initiation region of bacteriophage ~ gene cro has been used. This region is characterized by a long single-stranded Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence followed by two hairpin structures of which the first one comprises in its loop the initiation codon. As compared to a free mRNA, the only nucleotides additionally protected in the binary mRNA-ribosome complex have been those which belong to the S-D sequence and the initiation codon.The protection of other nucleotides has not changed. Addition of the initiator RNA results in the modification of nuclcotides in the stems of the downstream hairpin structures of the initiation region. This reflects their transition into a single-stranded conformation promoted by tRNA. A possible implication of these findings for the decoding process is discussed.",

The sequence of this initiation region can be arbitrarily subdivided into the part upstream from the initiation codon, the initiation codon itself and the sequence downstream from it. Much attention has been recently focused on the structure of the first two of them which are known to represent the primary binding sites for the ribosome (for references see Ref. 1) . Much less information is available on the role of the region downstream from the initiation codon t~oth in binding with the ribosome and in the decoding process. The sequence of this part of the initiation region is, nevertheless, non-random [2] and reveals a high preference for A residues [3] . One may infer, therefore, that it tends to be in a single-stranded conformation, and the secondary structure of this region, when present, has to be destroyed by the ribosome at some step of the initiation of translation, thus preparing the message for the decoding process. The aim of our investigations is to gain some information how ribosomes interact with this part of the initiation region.",

Its secondary structure is shown in Fig. 1 . The predicted folding of the mini-mRNA has been confirmed by enzymatic probing (unpublished) and by chemical modification (this paper). The structure of this mRNA has several important features which, taken together, are not found in mRNAs used by other investigators. It starts by the AUG codon which is not functional under natural conditions of protein synthesis followed by a single-stranded sequence encompassing a very long (9 bp) SD-region. The true initiation codon (nt 19-21) is in the loop of the first short hairpin (nt 14-28) that is probably stabilized by a coaxial stacking interaction with the second longer hairpin encompassing positions 29-50. When using toeprint analysis [6] , cro-mini-mRNA reveals a normal stop at position + 16 from the natural initiation codon (+ 1 is the A residue of the initiation codon), in agreement with data of Hartz et al. [11] . This stop is not observed at all in the absence of tRNA, though the long SD-sequence of cro-mini-mRNA appears to provide rather stable binary binary complex is unclear and requires further investigations.",

From logical consideration, however, the conservation of the secondary structure of this sequence seems unlikely, and the protection of some bases may be a consequence of an interaction with ribosomal components. Addition of 50 S subunits (Fig. 2 , lane 5 and Fig. 3 , lane 4) or/and factor IF-3 (Fig. 2, lanes 4-5) to the mixture containing mRNA, 30 S subunits and tRNA does not affect the pattern of chemical modification. This suggests that: (1) the mRNA binding centers at least for the downstream part of the RNA, are located only on the 30 S subunit; (2) these centers are not affected appreciably on formation of the 70 S initiation complex.",

Addition of tRNA strongly promotes transition of the nucleotide sequence downstream from the AUG codon into a single-stranded form. This is not necessary to mean that the ribosome in the presence of tRNA actively melts the secondary structure of mRNA. One can also accept the point of view of De Smit and Van Duin [12] that the ribosome fix an unfolded conformation of mRNA that preexists in the population of mRNA molecules. If so, the tRNA just displaces the equilibrium between different conformations of mRNA towards the unfolded state of the polynucleotide chain. However, in contrast to the conception of these authors, in our case, the selection of an extended conformation of the downstream sequence should occur rather when mRNA is already bound to the ribosome by means of its SD-sequence than directly from solution.",

In all these cases the only invariant stop at position + 16 (starting from the AUG initiation triplet) has been found. However, in our opinion, these data also suggest that at least distal nucleotides of the downstream sequence are fixed in the ribosome and the tRNA promotes this fixation. Indeed, in the absence of tRNA the toeprint signal is either absent or very weak. Therefore, the single-stranded conformation of the downstream part of the initiation region, if it preexists, must be energetically more advantageous per se and not only because it is not able to occlude SD-sequence or the initiation triplet. That would make an additional contribution to the stability of the mRNA-ribosome complex and it is indeed reflected in its consensus sequence [3] . In this connection, it is pertinent to mention one of our findings (manuscript in preparation) where we have succeeded to bind mini-mRNA to undissociated 70 S ribosomes (tight couples) in the presence of tRNA . We have found only one toeprint stop in this case, namely, that originating from the 5'-terminal AUG triplet of mini-mRNA. As seen from Fig. 1 , this AUG triplet is followed by a singlestranded downstream sequence.",

The role of all initiation factors in this transition is also to be elucidated. These investigations are now in progress.

From this point of view, it is easier to understand some cases described in literature when the secondary structure just downstream from the decoding site affects the decoding process. One can recall, for example, frame-shifting in the translation of Rous sarcoma virus mRNA where slip-page of tRNAs is dependent on the formation of a hairpin stem-loop structure that is immediately downstream [13] or frameshifting with the genomic RNA of the coronavirus IBV which is dependent on the downstream pseudoknot [14] . Also, a very stable hairpin is present immediately downstream from the jump \"take-off' site for the mRNA of phage T4 gene 60 where the ribosome hops over a 50 nucleotide interruption in the coding sequence [15] . In all these cases, the downstream secondary structure is not the only factor that accounts for frameshifting or hopping. However, they may pro-vide some support to the proposed mutual influence of the decoding site of the ribosome and the mRNA structure downstream from it.",

In this connection, it is pertinent to note data of Murakawa and Nierlich [16] who have found protection of the downstream sequence of the lac Z ribosome binding site mainly from the modification by 1,10-phenanthrolinecopper ion oxidative complex. The modification by this reagent is supposed to involve a backbone sugars of the polynucleotides [17] .
