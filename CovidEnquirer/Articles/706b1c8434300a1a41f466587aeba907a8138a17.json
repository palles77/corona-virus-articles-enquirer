The purine derivative of the potent screening hit T-00127-HEV1 has served as a suitable starting point for a thorough investigation of positions 8 and 2. While position 8 of the purine scaffold can only bear a small substituent to maintain the inhibitory activity, position 2 is opened for extensive modification and can accommodate even substituted phenyl rings without the loss of PI4K IIIb inhibitory activity. These empirical observations nicely correlate with the results of our docking study, which suggests that position 2 directs towards solution and can provide the necessary space for the interaction with remote residues of the enzyme, whereas the cavity around position 8 is strictly limited. The obtained compounds have also been subjected to antiviral screening against a panel of (+)ssRNA viruses.",

            "text": "Phosphatidylinositol 4-kinases (PI4Ks) catalyze the transfer of phosphate from ATP to position 4 of phosphatidylinositol, resulting in the formation of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P). This important phosphoinositide is involved in numerous cellular processes such as vesicular budding and membrane dynamics. Apart from these signaling roles, PI4P also serves as a crucial intermediate in the synthesis of other phosphoinositides, including phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3). Mammalian cells contain four different PI4K isoforms catalogued into class II (PI4K IIa and PI4K IIb) and class III (PI4K IIIa and PI4K IIIb). [1] [2] [3] Both members of class III have been proven to be implicated in the replication of various ss(+)RNA viruses. Specific virus-encoded proteins are able to recruit these PI4Ks and misuse them to produce highly phosphorylated membrane compartments, which serve as a base for the replication complex. In particular, PI4K IIIb is known to be indispensable in the replication of a number of viruses from the Picornaviridae family, including the most common human viral pathogens, Rhinoviruses and Enteroviruses. [4] [5] [6] [7] Furthermore, this enzyme is implicated in the replication of Coronaviruses, represented by SARS-CoV. 8 In addition, both isoforms from class III PI4K family, PI4K IIIb and PI4K IIIa, have been shown to be necessary host factors involved in the life cycle of the hepatitis C virus. [9] [10] [11] Recently, several groups have identified new inhibitors of class II PI4Ks [12] [13] [14] [15] and selective inhibitors of PI4K IIIa [16] [17] [18] and PI4K IIIb. 11, [18] [19] [20] [21] Furthermore, the crystal structures of PI4K IIa, 22 PI4K IIb 23 and PI4K IIIb, 24, 25 were solved during the last year, thus allowing further optimization of inhibitor efficiency and selectivity. 26 Generally, two distinct types of selective PI4K IIIb inhibitors have been introduced (Fig. 1) . Firstly, some compounds can be regarded as derivatives of PIK93 possessing a five-membered central core connected to an aromatic side chain. In contrast, the second type of PI4K IIIb inhibitors with the archetypal example being T-00127-HEV1 is characterized by a bicyclic central core and a similar aromatic sidechain. 3 Within this study, we have used purine derivatives and several other structurally related bicycles as potential analogs of the latter group. Our major goals were to complete the structure-activity relationship study and to understand the role of methyl substituents on the central purine core. Although our initial results indicated that the purine analog is approximately six times less active than the parent compound T-00127-HEV1, 6 we decided to use this structural pattern to explore mainly the potential substitution at positions 8 and 2 because of easy access to a vast variety of these derivatives.",

The subsequent closure of the imidazole ring under microwave conditions afforded a complex mixture of compounds with a partially or fully acetylated amino group in position 2 (44). Therefore, the crude mixture was heated under acidic conditions, which led to the desired intermediate 45 in 60% yield. The final 2-aminoderivative 46 was then obtained by the nucleophilic substitution in similar fashion as in the previous cases in 65% yield.

We performed a series of docking studies based on these recently published structural data in order to elucidate these phenomena. The removal of the nitrogen atom at position 7 is accompanied by significant drop of activity (compound 6), which can be easily explained by missing hydrogen bond between the core of the inhibitor and amide moiety of Val613 and steric hindrance of additional hydrogen atom, which causes additional distortion of the amino sidechain and loss of another hydrogen contact with carbonyl moiety of Val613 (Supporting Fig. 1B) . The docking results nicely explain also the observed lack of activity of 8-substituted derivatives caused by a limited space of the binding cavity, which is appropriate for the accommodation of a methyl group (Supporting Figs. 1 and 2) . The partial loss of activity of compounds 14 and 15 with the additional nitrogen at position 8 could be explained by repulsion of electron pair of this nitrogen atom, which occupy this small cavity, and carbonyl group of Glu611(Supporting Fig. 1C and D) . Our data also indicate that the carbonyl oxygen of the amide group attached to the phenyl substituent at position 2 of derivative 51 can easily form a hydrogen bond with Ser618 and enhance the inhibitory effect of the inhibitor (Fig. 2) . Similarly, compound 52 can easily accommodate the position with the carbonyl moiety in close proximity to the Ser618, although an alternative binding mode with an amide hydrogen interacting with the carbonyl group of Gly675 might also be possible according to our docking results (Supporting Fig. 3) .",

In the 8-substituted series, the antiviral activity largely correlated with the observed inhibitory activity against PI4K IIIb, and thus only the methyl derivative 1 and the 8-bromo analog 25 exerted significant activities in the antiviral screening. In the 2-substituted series, the derivatives with small substituents exerted generally lower antiviral activities than the compounds from the 2-phenyl series. The highest antiviral activity of the whole series was observed for the meta-and parasubstituted 2-phenyl derivatives 51, 52 and 53. To our surprise, however, we observed antiviral effects against all tested viruses, not only for the compounds that inhibited PI4K IIIb but also for the other 2-phenyl derivatives, e.g., 54-56. This might be attributed to some off-target effect or cytotoxicity.",

Our study clearly proves that position 8 is not suitable for any extensive modification with the methyl group being the optimum. On the other hand, the opposite side of the purine scaffold (position 2) can be decorated by various substituents. Although we have observed a significant drop of inhibitory activity for derivatives with simple aromatic rings, the analogs bearing appropriately substituted phenyls have exerted restored inhibitory activities against the title enzyme and have also proved to be the most potent in antiviral screening against various (+)ssRNA viruses.",
