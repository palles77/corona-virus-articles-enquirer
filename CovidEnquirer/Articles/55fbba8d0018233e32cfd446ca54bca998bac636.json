An absolutely airtight space effectively prevents infectious diseases from leaking out of the isolation room. Opening the door leads to a breakdown in isolation conditions and causes the dispersion of infectious air out of the isolation room. Extensively employed to manage smoke in cases of fires at subway and highway tunnels, a concept of controlling airflow is applied to the study. This study proposes a design of ventilation system to control air flow rate for containing airborne contaminant and preventing its spread to the adjacent rooms when the door to the isolation room is opened and closed. This paper employs computational fluid dynamics (CFD) as a more effective approach to examine the concentration maps of airborne contaminants and the airflow patterns of room air and discuss the influence of temperature differences between two rooms on airborne dispersion. Results show that an air velocity above 0.2 m/s via a doorway effectively prevents the spread of airborne contaminants out of the isolation room in the state of door opening.",

            "text": "Effective isolation measures in the isolation room are important for controlling the airborne spread of infectious diseases. Several infectious agents such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [1] and tuberculosis (TB) [2] are transmitted by aerosols. The experience with SARS in 2003 has triggered increased attention to the problem of aerosol transmission, short range between healthcare workers and their patients [3] [4] [5] . Airborne transmission of contaminants may be restricted by the use of a negative pressure isolation room [6] . However, when the door of an isolation room is opened, the ventilation system fails to maintain the required negative pressure difference within the room, and this failure results in the dispersion of airborne contaminants out of the room [7] . An experimental model indicates that opening the door leads to a breakdown in isolation conditions and causes the transmission of infectious air out of the isolation room [8] . How to prevent the airborne transmission in the case of door opening is therefore an issue of grave importance. Therefore, this study proposes an arrangement of an anteroom to separate the isolation room and the corridor. The anteroom acts as an airlock to prevent direct dispersion of air-borne contaminants from the room to the corridor. However, when the door of an isolation room is opened, the airborne contaminants in the isolation room will directly disperse to the anteroom instead of the corridor; healthcare workers leaving the isolation room and entering the anteroom are therefore at a higher risk of being infected.",

            "text": "Hence, it is crucial to understand the transmission of contaminated air through the doorway into the anteroom and take proper measures to reduce the spread of airborne contaminants from the isolation room. Air changes per hour (ACH) of ventilation system and airflow pattern of room air movement exercise considerable impacts on the control of airborne contaminant diffusion [9] . It is noted that airflow control is extensively employed to manage smokes from fires at subway, railroad and highway tunnels. Accordingly, controlling the airflow to dominate the room air movement will be evaluated in the present work on the prevention of airborne contaminant transmission. In general, the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) method is effectively employed to evaluate the effect of different air supply systems on indoor air distribution and ventilation effectiveness [10] . The numerical results from CFD software Fluent adopted to predict particle transport and distribution in ventilated rooms agree well with associated experimental data [11] . Using CFD to evaluate the performance of ventilation systems, our study aims to propose a strategy of preventing the dispersion of airborne contaminants from the isolation room when the door to the isolation room is opened and closed. Fig. 1(a) illustrates the configuration of the studied model, including an anteroom of 2.5 m (width) \u00c2 2.5 m (height) \u00c2 1 m (length) in the X, Y, and Z directions respectively, and an isolation room of 2.5 m (width) \u00c2 2.5 m (height) \u00c2 3.7 m (length) in the X, Y, and Z directions respectively. In the isolation room illuminated by a set of light (80 W), the study had a patient lied on a bed at the height of 0.6 m from the floor. An exhaust air vent (2.5 m \u00c2 0.2 m) was located on the lower wall behind the head of the bed. In the anteroom illuminated by a set of light (40 W), a ceiling (1 m \u00c2 1 m) supply air vent was installed at the height of 2.5 m. As revealed in Fig. 1(b) , a healthcare worker and medical equipment with a heat dissipation of 100W stood by both sides of the bed. The sizes of the patient and healthcare worker were listed in Table  1 . Except the location and the facing direction of the healthcare worker were different from the one of the patient, as shown in Fig. 1 (a) and (b), the healthcare worker had the same size as the patient. The distance between the healthcare worker and the patient reported 0.75 m. In order to simulate the transmission of airborne contaminants, certain conditions were assumed regarding the patient, including an activity of 1 met unit (1 met = 58W per square meter) corresponding to a resting state, a CO 2 generation rate of 0.23 liters per minute, a breathing rate of 8 liters per minute [12] , and CO 2 as an indicator of airborne contaminants.",

The exhaled gases consisted of CO 2 with a mass fraction of 0.043. The temperatures of the supplied outdoor air and persons were assumed to be 21 and 37\u00b0C, respectively. The velocities at the supply air vent in the cases of 12, 24, and 48 ACH were 0.078, 0.155, and 0.309 m/s, respectively. The boundary condition of velocity inlet was specified at the supply air vent and the mouth of the patient. Boundary condition inputs at velocity inlets are used to compute the mass flow into the domain through the inlets and to measure the fluxes of momentum, energy, and species through the inlets. The pressure at the exhaust air vent referred to an ambient pressure. The boundary condition of pressure outlet was specified at the exhaust air vent. At pressure outlets, Fluent uses the boundary condition pressure inputted as the static pressure of the fluid at the outlet plane and extrapolates all other conditions from the interior of the domain. At the solid surfaces, no-slip con-ditions were specified. All boundary walls of the model room were assumed to be adiabatic. Moreover, the fluid was considered incompressible with constant properties, and the flow was assumed to be steady and three-dimensional.",

The air, therefore, flows from a cleaner area (the anteroom) to a contaminated area (the isolation room) to prevent the spread of airborne contaminants. In case of mechanical ventilation failure as in Fig. 3(a) , the airflow direction was thermally driven. A clockwise swirl of airflow was generated in the isolation room; room air flowed from the isolation room to the anteroom; and the swirl carried the airborne contaminants from the contaminated area to the cleaner area. As revealed in Fig. 3(b) , when the mechanical ventilation started to function at a rate of 12 ACH, the direction of its airflow was contrary to the one in Fig. 3(a) . It was noted that the reversed airflow occurred at the doorway due to the effects of thermal buoyancy and an average temperature difference of 1.59\u00b0C between the two rooms, causing the airborne contaminants to be spread into the anteroom. An arrangement of left-upper ceiling supply and right-lower wall exhaust plus a mechanical ventilation system resulted in airflow swirl rotating counter-clockwisely in the upper parts of the isolation room. However, increasing the flow rate to 24 or 48 ACH helped eliminate the phenomenon of reversed flow and restricted the swirls to the local area of the isolation room ( Fig. 3(c) and (d)), as more air flowing at the rates of 24 and 48 ACH reduced the average temperature difference between the two rooms to 1.05 and 0.63\u00b0C, respectively, and decreased thermal buoyancy.

With the presence of a healthcare worker and medical equipment in the isolation room, these additional heat sources raised the average temperature difference to 3.5 and 1.8\u00b0C between the two rooms for the cases of 12 and 48 ACH, respectively. The standing person caused a flow disturbance, and the heat generated thermal plumes that could bring the airborne contaminants to the upper zone. The convective flow around the patient brought the air at a lower zone to the breathing zone of the standing person. Therefore, the healthcare worker was exposed in an area with a higher concentration of airborne contaminants. However, a mechanical ventilation system above 48 ACH was able to extract airborne contaminant and reduced its concentration. The left-side upper corners of the isolation room as shown in Fig. 6 stayed as high contamination zones. The increase in the temperature difference caused airflow reversal at the doorway in the cases of 12 and 24 ACH, resulting in stronger diffusion of airborne contaminants from the isolation room to the anteroom and raising the contaminant concentration in the anteroom in the cases of 12 and 48 ACH from 15.16 to 21.25 ppm and from 0.16 to 0.55 ppm, respectively.

Normally, the motorized airtight dampers M1-M4 were open, and manual volume dampers, VD, were modulated once in order to provide the required ACH and negative pressure differentials in the anteroom and the isolation room. In the case of door opening, while interlocking with the door, airtight dampers M2 and M3 were automatically closed to raise the flow rate of air into the anteroom. Accordingly, sufficient air flowed at a rate above 48 ACH from the ceiling supply air vent in the anteroom through the doorway and resulted in an air velocity above 0.2 m/s to effectively prevent the spread of airborne contaminants.",

Airflow patterns are analyzed to be affected by ventilation rates and air temperature differentials. In addition, a design of ventilation system is proposed to control air flow rate for containing airborne contaminant and preventing its spread to the adjacent anteroom when the door to the isolation room is opened and closed. It should be further noted that studies on clean rooms suggest that an airflow velocity above 0.2 m/s is capable of effectively controlling the movement of airborne contaminants. Our research verifies that the same finding can also be applied to regulate the movement of airborne contaminants in isolation rooms. Yet, how the movement of healthcare workers through the doorway of the isolation room may influence the ability of airflow to prevent the spread of airborne contaminants remains an issue that merits future studies.",
