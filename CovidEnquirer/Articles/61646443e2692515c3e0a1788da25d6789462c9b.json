Apart from fever and respiratory complications, gastrointestinal symptoms are frequently observed in patients with SARS but the significance remains undetermined. Herein, we describe the clinical, pathologic, and virologic features of the intestinal involvement of this new viral infection. Methods: A retrospective analysis of the gastrointestinal symptoms and other clinical parameters of the first 138 patients with confirmed SARS admitted for a major outbreak in Hong Kong in March 2003 was performed. Intestinal specimens were obtained by colonoscopy or postmortem examination to detect the presence of coronavirus by electron microscopy, virus culture, and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. Results: Among these 138 patients with SARS, 28 (20.3%) presented with watery diarrhea and up to 38.4% of patients had symptoms of diarrhea during the course of illness. Diarrhea was more frequently observed during the first week of illness. The mean number of days with diarrhea was 3.7 \u060e 2.7, and most diarrhea was self-limiting. Intestinal biopsy specimens obtained by colonoscopy or autopsy showed minimal architectural disruption but the presence of active viral replication within both the small and large intestine. Coronavirus was also isolated by culture from these specimens, and SARS-CoV RNA can be detected in the stool of patients for more than 10 weeks after symptom onset. Conclusions: Diarrhea is a common presenting symptom of SARS. The intestinal tropism of the SARS-CoV has major implications on clinical presentation and viral transmission.",

            "text": "S evere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerged infection characterized by fever and pneumonia. This disease may progress rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome with considerable morbidity and mortality. The disease was first identified in the Guandong Province of China in November 2002, and a major outbreak occurred in Hong Kong in March 2003. 1, 2 The disease then quickly spread around the world at an alarming rate in \u03fd2 months. As of May 31, 2003, SARS has been described in 32 countries affecting 8360 individuals and causing 764 deaths. 3 The overall mortality for this illness is about 16% in Hong Kong 1 and can be as high as 43% in elderly patients. 4 Shortly after the description of this disease, a novel form of coronavirus, named the SARS-CoV, that does not closely resemble any of the 3 previously known groups of coronaviruses was identified to be the causative agent. 5, 6 This virus can be detected by culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from most patients with SARS, and specific antibodies against this new virus can also be shown in the infected host. Furthermore, a monkey inoculation experiment produces similar disease as in humans, fulfilling the Koch's postulate. 7 The coronaviruses are a diverse group of large, enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses. Coronavirus is known to cause a wide spectrum of diseases in animals. In particular, respiratory and enteric infections are the most common presentation. However, it is uncertain whether respiratory and enteric coronaviruses in animals are distinctive in their genetic sequences. Emerging data suggest the differences in the spike protein of the virus may underlie the tissue tropism of bovine coronavirus. 8 In humans, there are 2 forms of coronavirus, HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, that are associated with about 30% of mild upper respiratory tract infections. Moreover, human coronaviruses or coronavirus-like particles have been linked to diarrheal disease in susceptible hosts, including patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome 9 and children from developing countries. 10, 11 Early data also linked the coronavirus to necrotizing enterocolitis in infants, but the real significance remains undetermined. 12, 13 Although SARS is characterized by fever and lower respiratory tract infection, data from recent outbreaks suggest that concurrent gastrointestinal symptoms are not uncommon. 2, 14, 15 In this study, we characterize the enteric manifestations of the first cohort of patients with SARS in the Hong Kong outbreak 2 with histologic and virologic correlations.",

The presence of antibody against coronavirus was detected by indirect immunofluorescent technique based on Vero cells infected with SARS-CoV isolated from a patient with SARS. Paired sera taken during acute (within 7 days after the onset of fever) and convalescent (\u03fe21 days after the onset of fever) phases were tested at serial dilutions starting from 1:40. The results were crosschecked by 2 experienced technicians. Positive serologic evidence of coronavirus infection was defined as having a seroconversion or \u05464-fold increase in antibody titer. 18 Virus isolation was performed by inoculating samples onto multiple cell lines, including rhesus monkey kidney (LLC-MK2), human laryngeal carcinoma (HEp-2), Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK), human embryonic lung fibroblast, and African green monkey kidney (Vero) monolayers. All cell cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C, except for MDCK and one additional LLC-MK2 cell culture tube that were incubated at 33\u00b0C. Cell monolayers were examined daily up to 14 days for cytopathic effect. Hemadsorption was performed for MDCK and LLC-MK2 cells to detect influenza and parainfluenza viruses. When a refractile, diffuse rounding cytopathic effect was observed on Vero cell monolayer, the cell culture supernatant was passaged to another Vero tube to confirm the reproducibility of the cytopathic effect. In addition, the cell culture supernatant was used for detection of coronavirus by reverse-transcription (RT)-PCR.

In the Toronto outbreak, 23.6% of the 144 patients had diarrhea on presentation. 15 Peiris et al. report that up to 70% of their 75 patients in the community outbreak from Hong Kong developed watery diarrhea, although the frequency of patients with diarrhea on admission was not provided. 14 In their study, the mean duration of diarrhea was 4 days, which is similar to our findings. The higher prevalence of diarrhea in their report when compared with our data is postulated to be linked to the different modes of transmission. Our cohort was believed to be infected by droplet transmission, whereas the community outbreak reported by Peiris et al. was linked to the faulty sewage system in an apartment complex in which fecal-oral transmission might be a major route of transmission. 20 In addition, this study shows the tissue tropism of SARS-CoV in the intestinal tract. Although coronavirus affects both the respiratory and intestinal tract in animals, this is the first report to show the presence of active viral replication in the small and large intestine of patients with SARS. Despite a relatively normal endoscopic and microscopic appearance, the presence of coronavirus in the large and small bowel can be shown by both electronic microscopy and viral culture. There was also evidence of active viral replication in intestinal cells with accumulation of virus inside endoplasmic reticulum and possibly leaving of virus from the apical membrane of the enterocytes. Moreover, small bowel biopsy specimens obtained from postmortem examination, which is usually performed a few days after the death of patients, still yielded viable SARS-CoV. In contrast, SARS is associated with epithelial cell proliferation and an increase in macrophages in the lung. 21 It is suggested that cytokine dysregulation plays an instrumental role in the determination of severity of lung disease. However, the current study shows that there was only minimal disruption of intestinal cells by the virus despite the tropism. Given the minimal destruction of enterocytes, diarrhea associated with SARS-CoV infection may be more related to proteins or toxins produced during viral replication than malabsorption or inflammation.",

All other organ tissues obtained during autopsy did not have viable virus recovered. By molecular diagnostic method, the detection rates of viral RNA from stool and nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were comparable in our study. On the other hand, our detection rate of viral RNA in nasopharyngeal aspirate was lower than the 32% reported by Peiris et al. 14 The difference may be accounted for by the differences in primer sequences and the timing of obtaining these specimens. Despite this, all of these data favor the intestinal tropism of SARS-CoV. From the virologic point of view, this intestinal tropism is unusual because most diarrhea-associated viruses (e.g., rotavirus, calicivirus, enteric adenovirus, Norwalk virus) are nonenveloped. Viruses without envelope are generally more resistant and have a better chance of survival in the intestinal tract. The intestinal tropism of SARS-CoV raises the question of whether this virus is more resistant to disinfection than other enveloped viruses.",

Our data further showed that virus can be detected by PCR in stool for up to 73 days from symptom onset in a patient, which may have substantial implications on infection control. Although viable virus is not recovered from stool samples, the question of whether stool remains a potential source of the virus in recovering or even recovered patients deserves further evaluation. It is also imperative that strict precautions be used in handling the excreta of these patients in addition to routine droplet and formite precautions to minimize the risk of viral transmission.
