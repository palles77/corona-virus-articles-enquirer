The IHR (2005) also obligates every member state of the WHO to build national core competency for disease surveillance. However, the regulations do not prescribe exactly how nations are to meet this core capacity. Certain low-and middleincome countries-particularly those facing the need to rapidly strengthen disease surveillance and overall public health infrastructure to meet their IHR (2005) obligations-may be looking to syndromic surveillance options and opportunities. A report from the IHR (2005) negotiations stresses this point: ''Because areas with the highest needs for surveillance of communicable diseases have often the poorest surveillance systems, new surveillance approaches, such as the surveillance of syndromes, adapted to poor laboratory infrastructure should be developed to respond to the challenge of development gaps'' [3] .",

The first point of confusion is the fact that ''many of the systems under discussion do not monitor well-defined constellations of signs and symptoms (syndromes), but instead target non-specific indicators of health, such as a patient with a chief complaint of \u00d4cough\u00d5 or the sale of over-the-counter cold medication; conversely, many systems that do monitor syndromes (e.g., acute flaccid paralysis, Reye\u00d5s syndrome, or carpal tunnel syndrome) are not included in these discussions'' [27] . Second, some refer to the term ''syndrome'' as a specific, clinically defined phenomenon, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), and others use it more loosely and non-specifically as simply a group of symptoms [28] .",

Problematically, these terms overlap, contradict, or are inconsistently applied, maintaining the terminological confusion. Further, several terms frequently applied to syndromic surveillance are not adequately descriptive to convey the type of system being referred to or do not distinguish between types of systems, and thus may not be appropriate as general, overarching terms.

Thus, there is now an even greater need for a consensus about what syndromic surveillance means. Additionally, as plans to translate syndromic surveillance systems to lower resource settings proceed, a proper conceptualization of the systems could increase their acceptance and efficient use. The development and communication of a unified understanding of the field may encourage governments or localities to adopt, invest in, and implement syndromic surveillance, where appropriate, and thus enhance compliance with IHR (2005); this adoption in middle-and low-income nations is being explored in the ongoing work to identify exemplary case studies of successful utilization of syndromic surveillance [30] .

In total, 43 separate articles defined syndromic surveillance, of which 36 provided unique definitions. A majority of the unique definitions found came from overview of articles of syndromic surveillance, rather than countryspecific articles. However, the country-specific articles provided distinguishing examples of systems being implemented in various settings. Table 1 contains the 36 unique definitions of syndromic surveillance found in the literature. The five general points of agreement among those in the field and mentioned above are frequently noted in the definitions and are designated in the set of columns on the far right. The two shaded columns indicate that there are two fundamental categories of syndromic surveillance systems conveyed by the collection of definitions. These two categories involve the same investigational approach, and may even be components of the same system, but monitor two distinct outcome types: specific and non-specific outcomes. Within the two fundamental categories of syndromic surveillance (defined further below), all five principles are relevant, with the principles of early detection and response and the use of pre-diagnostic information being the most commonly referred to across the definitions.",

            "text": "The literature review yielded multiple articles that noted the distinction between specific and non-specific surveillance systems. In a foundational article introducing the field of syndromic surveillance to a wider audience, Sosin explains that indicators of a disease outbreak can either be suggestive of ''highly specific syndrome[s]'' or ''non-specific expressions of the target diseases that occur before a diagnosis would routinely be made'' [18] . The following year, an article based on recommendations from a CDC Working Group contrasted surveillance of a syndrome that ''is relatively specific for the condition of interest'' (such as acute flaccid paralysis as ''a syndromic marker'' in the detection of poliomyelitis) to surveillance with a broader purpose, such as ''sexually transmitted disease detection and control'' [35] . More recently, Fricker differentiates ''well-defined'' data that are ''linked to specific types of outbreaks'' to data that are ''vaguely defined and perhaps only weakly linked to specific types of outbreaks, such as over-the-counter sales [14] X X X X X X Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [33] X X X Pavlin [21] X X X Reingold [34] X X X Smolinski et al. [28] X X X X Sosin [18] X X X X Sosin [19] X X X X X X Buehler [35] X X X X MMWR Editors [36] X X Henning [26] X X Lombardo et al. [37] X X Mandl et al. [22] X X X Stoto et al. [16] X X X Ang et al. [38] Berger et al. [17] X X X X Stoto et al. [39] X X X Chaves and Pascual [40] X Morse [41] X X Buehler et al. [6] X X X X X Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [20] X X Chretien et al. [12] X X X X X Chretien et al. [11] X X X Fearnley [42] X X Fricker [43] X X X Fricker et al. [15] X X X X X Jefferson et al. [44] X X X Nordin et al. [39] Tsui et al. [46] X Buehler et al. [23] X X X Gault et al. [47] X May et al. [13] X X Sintchenko and Gallego [24] X X X Zhang et al. [48] X X X Josseran et al. [49] X of cough and cold medication or absenteeism rates'' [43] . Fricker continues his summary of the types of syndromic surveillance by observing that the meaning of the term ''syndrome'' has evolved in the context of syndromic surveillance: ''A syndrome is \u00d4a set of symptoms or conditions that occur together and suggest the presence of a certain disease or an increased chance of developing the disease\u00d5. In the context of syndromic surveillance, a syndrome is a set of non-specific pre-diagnosis medical and other information that may indicate the release of a bioterrorism agent or natural disease outbreak'' [emphasis ours] [43] . Clearly this term ''syndromic'' as it is narrowly defined imperfectly captures the full range of these systems. An adjustment of the term, while maintaining the root of its meaning to ensure continuity in the field, can help strengthen and expand understanding of this field. Table 2 outlines the two categories of syndromic surveillance system types-specific and non-specific. As explained above and demonstrated in the literature, the purposes of each syndromic surveil-lance category are different. Whereas the ''specific disease/syndrome detection'' category focuses on detecting defined syndromes or a defined outcome of interest, the ''non-specific disease detection'' category aims to monitor or uncover non-specific indicators/trends that suggest an outbreak may be occurring. Based on this distinction, an alteration of the term ''syndromic surveillance'' to ''syndrome-based'' surveillance (SBS) referring to the more specific type of surveillance and ''syndromic-non-specific'' surveillance (SNS) referring to the now more common, non-specific category of disease detection is proposed. The categorization of SBS and SNS is confirmed by the examined literature and will be used throughout the remainder of the article to refer to these categories of surveillance.",

One attempt separated systems into those based on a ''data collection system that is dedicated to the purpose of this public health surveillance'' (e.g., during a specific event) and those for the day-to-day monitoring of ''data that are routinely collected for other purposes'' [27] . Another categorization divided systems by data source: those data sources based on the use of health-care services and those based on health-related behaviors [6] . While these are useful distinctions to make when examining syndromic surveillance systems, they are not the most fundamental. The proposed categorization within the scope of this research addresses the most critical distinction among syndromic surveillance systems, which is the level of specificity of the outcome under surveillance. The distinction between data sources as sub-categories within each of the two larger categories (specific and non-specific detection) is taken into consideration because there is a fair amount of overlap. As noted in Table 2 , the data sources used in SNS systems can include those data sources used in SBS systems, but frequently focus primarily on pre-clinical data.",

Its utilization of data from a variety of sources makes it a valuable addition to traditional surveillance methods [22] . While bioterrorism detection is not typically the primary use of syndromic surveillance today, non-specific disease detection continues to be thought of and investigated as a biosecurity tool [20] .

The importance of taking an all-inclusive view to the field of syndromic surveillance is put best by Fricker: ''a myopic focus only on early event detection for bioterrorism in syndromic surveillance systems misses other important benefits electronic biosurveillance can provide, particularly the potential to significantly advance and modernize the practice of public health surveillance'' [43] .",

These dual-function systems (specific and non-specific detection) collect data from several sources-both the pre-clinical and clinical non-diagnostic types. Nevertheless, the acceptance and application of improved terminology regarding these systems can reduce ambiguity in the field and increase adoption of syndromic surveillance systems where appropriate. Future research must explore the combination of the SBS and SNS systems in more depth.",
