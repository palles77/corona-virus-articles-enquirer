The differences seen between the IgG and IgM levels of the VN-negatlve and VN-posltlve pigs (TABLE II) may represent a recent immune response of the VN-negatlve pigs to organisms in the environment, or the IgG in these pigs may be residual from the ingested colostrum. The colostral contribution of IgM would be low as the calculated mean half-llfe of IgM is 4.8 days, whereas the half-llfe of IgG is 13.8 days (Curtis and Bourne, 1973) . Moon et al., 1975 , demonstrated that 3-day-old pigs are more susceptible to TGEV infection and produce more virus in their intestines than older pigs. The increased replication of the virus in the intestinal tracts of neonatal pigs may provide a greater antigenic mass and may have caused a greater antibody response in neonatal pigs. Alternatively, the neonatal pigs may have had fewer other (extraneous) antigens to interfere with the formation of specific antibody.",
