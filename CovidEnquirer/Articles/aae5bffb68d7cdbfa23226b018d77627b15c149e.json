Effusive FIP was found in 33 cats, non-effusive FIP in 12 cats, and mixed-type in six cats. Highly significant decreases in haematocrit and albumin levels and an increase in total bilirubin level were noted in both effusive and non-effusive FIP, at first presentation and before death. In serial blood examinations of the effusive group, anaemia and increases in bilirubin and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) were observed from 2 weeks to 0e3 days before death. The packed cell volume, bilirubin, AST, potassium, and sodium levels were established to predict disease staging and survival time. Cumulative points ranging from 0 to 4, 5 to 11 and excess of 12, indicate that the cat can survive for at least 2 weeks, less than 2 weeks and less than 3 days, respectively.",

There are two major forms of FIP, an effusive and a noneffusive form. In some cases of non-effusive FIP, body effusion can develop at the terminal stage of the disease and become a mixed-type of FIP upon necropsy. 1 The ante-mortem diagnosis of either type of the disease is often difficult because most of the clinical signs are non-specific. An algorithm for the diagnosis of FIP that includes disease presentation signs, environment, clinical signs, laboratory findings, serological testing, and organism-specific identification has been suggested in the literature. 2 After the diagnosis of FIP, euthanasia is usually recommended. Most of the cats investigated in this study were diagnosed as being in the early stages of FIP at presentation. Due to religious reasons, euthanasia is difficult to perform in Taiwan.",

Fifty-one cats were confirmed to have FIP via pathological confirmation after death and were, therefore, included in the analysis. The medical records of the 51 confirmed cases were included in this study for further analysis. Six cases were excluded from the disease course and survival time analysis because of a non-disease-associated accident or a non-expected severe neurological reaction to treatment. Each cat's age, breed, and gender, as well as its disease-related history, clinical signs, physical findings, survival time, blood test results, and diagnostic tests, were recorded. All cats were grouped into the non-effusive, effusive, or mixed-type group based on histopathological confirmation after necropsy. All of the affected cats were also confirmed by a PCR test to be infected with coronavirus, using samples that included body effusions: nasal, tonsil, conjunctival, and rectal swabs while the animals were alive, and different organ tissues after necropsy. The complete blood counts, leukocyte differential counts, blood smear (stained by Liu's stain) and biochemistry (including total bilirubin, albumin, total protein, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, glucose, sodium, potassium, and chloride levels) of the 51 cats included in this study were regularly collected before death.

Furthermore, 38 of the diseased cats were less than 1 year old, and 22 of these 38 cats were younger than 6 months old. This phenomenon may be due to the fact that most kitten purchases and adoptions from animal shelters in Taiwan involve cats that are 2e3 months old. In the current study, the oldest cat diagnosed with FIP was 7 years old, and the average of age of diagnosis was 1.22 AE 1.56 years. This finding is not consistent with earlier studies, which have reported a secondary increased incidence in cats aged 14e15 years. 8 A lower older cat population in Taiwan in comparison to other countries could explain this discrepancy. In this study, there was no significant difference in representation between purebred (49%) and DSH (51%) cats. The most commonly observed purebred cat breeds with FIP were Persians and Scottish Folds in the study, the former being the most popular purebred type in Taiwan. The first Scottish Fold FIP case was diagnosed in June 2007, and seven more Scottish Fold cases were among the 21 following cases diagnosed as of January 2009. Prior to June 2007, no other FIP diagnoses involving Scottish Fold cats had been reported. 6,7 FIP has been reported to occur most often in cats from catteries, pet shops, and multi-cat households. Furthermore, certain bloodlines and intra-breed mating may more strongly predispose cats to FIP than the breeds themselves. 2, 9 All of the purebred cats involved in this study were purchased from pet shops. In the current study, 15.7% of the diseased cats had siblings who had died from FIP, indicating that a heredity predisposition may exist. In addition, Scottish Fold cats appeared to be over-represented in this study, which could be a result of the small Scottish Fold breeding population in Taiwan; however, this correlation requires further study.",

One of the accidentally killed cats survived nearly 5 months (139 days) after being diagnosed with effusive FIP from an immunofluorescent assay of ascites. Interestingly, the volume of ascites gradually decreased during therapy (the cat received 0.5 mg/kg of prednisone, once daily, 0.5 mg/kg of benazepril, once daily, and human interferon a). The cat died due to acute lung bleeding and shock. During the necropsy, approximately 20 ml of ascites and FIP-associated granulomatous lesions on the liver were observed. Six cats in the mixed-type FIP group originally had non-effusive FIP; five of them developed ascites and one developed pleural effusion 2 to 19 days before death at an average of 9.7 days. These FIP cats also exhibited a concomitant aggravation of clinical signs. All of the PCR tests of the effusion obtained from these cats were positive. One cat was diagnosed with non-effusive FIP at 1.5 years old, and the disease was controlled with prednisolone and human interferon a for about 1 year. After that year, the cat exhibited waxing and waning clinical signs, and nelfinavir was added to control virus replication. 12 Three months later, the cat presented with ascites and survived 477 days after therapy. Cat 6 was treated with prednisolone, nelfinavir, and interferon, and survived for 181 days. According to Pedersen's report, the dry form of FIP sometimes develops into effusive FIP, as has primarily been observed in cases of artificial laboratory infection; 5, 9 this has also been observed in naturally infected cats in this study.",

Approximately 45.8% of effusive FIP-diseased cats exhibited hyperbilirubinaemia at first presentation in comparison to 100% before death. None of the cats in the non-effusive FIP group exhibited hyperbilirubinaemia at first presentation and only two developed hyperbilirubinaemia before death. A greater prevalence of hyperbilirubinaemia was noted in the effusive group relative to the other two groups. In the serial blood examination of the effusive group, there were significant differences in hyperbilirubinaemia between 3 days before death and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 weeks before death. Therefore, hyperbilirubinaemia could be used as an additional parameter to predict poor prognosis and to serve as an indicator for disease stage, especially in the effusive group. The cause of hyperbilirubinaemia in FIP cats is not clearly understood. 1, 7, 13 Hyperbilirubinaemia is frequently a reflection of hepatic necrosis despite the fact that ALP and ALT activities are often not as increased as dramatically in hepatic necrosis as they are with other liver diseases, such as cholangiohepatitis and hepatic lipidosis. 2 In this study, hyperbilirubinaemia was not well correlated with hepatic necrosis in any of the icteric cats. Some cats with icterus did not exhibit any obvious hepatic necrotic lesions. Furthermore, hyperbilirubinaemia could be caused by haemolysis as a result of secondary immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia; however, in our observation, there was no evidence of immune-mediated haemolytic anaemia. Bilirubin is sometimes increased in cats with FIP without evidence of haemolysis, liver disease, or cholestasis. It has been speculated that bilirubin metabolism and excretion into the biliary system are compromised in cats with FIP. 1 According to the serial examination of the effusive group, we developed assessment criteria for the prediction of survival time. A total of 92.2% of the effusive cases satisfied the assessment criteria (Table 3) . Cumulative points ranging from 0 to 4 indicate that the cat can survive for at least 2 weeks. Cumulative points ranging from 5 to 11 indicate a survival time of less than 2 weeks, whereas cumulative points in excess of 12 indicate a survival time of less than 3 days. These criteria could be used to assess survival time at first presentation in a clinical setting.",
