The Adolfo Lutz, a Public Health Institute, has been improving its methodology tools in order to provide a timely answer to public health authorities facing acute respiratory disease outbreaks.",

These samples presented negative results for influenza virus A(H1N1), A(H1N1)pdm09, A(H3N2) and B strains by CDC rRT-PCR ; and were also proven negative by differential diagnosis by the use of respiratory monoclonal panel to investigate: influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus and parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3 viruses by Indirect Immunofluorescence (IFI). The differential diagnosis in samples presenting negative results, by both methodologies, was submitted to the CDC Real RT-PCR containing primers and probes for adenovirus (ADV), rhinovirus (RVs), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV ), parainfluenza 1, 2, 3, 4(PV1, PV2, PV3, PV4), kindly provided by Dr. Dean Erdman. Of the 252 clinical specimens presenting negative results by using differential monoclonal respiratory panel IFI, 60 (23.80%) were positive by Real Time RT-PCR, the following etiologic agents have been identified: RSV 20 (33.40%); PV1 3 (5%); PV2 7 (11.60%); PV3 9 (15%) RVs 10 (16.60%); ADV 11 (18.40%).",
