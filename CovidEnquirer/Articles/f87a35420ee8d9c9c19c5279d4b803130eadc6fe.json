To investigate the scenario, a dynamic error based method, Z-type control is applied in an SI type disease model with the aim of achieving a predetermined disease prevalence. The controlled system is designed by introducing a new compartment (the population in an infection-free region) in the uncontrolled system to capture the removal of susceptible population from the infected region to an infection free region. By performing numerical simulations, our study shows that using Z-control mechanism, the removal of susceptible to an infection free region can effectively achieve a predetermined disease prevalence. The removal rates required for achieving a specific reduction in infected population for different levels of disease endemicity are quantified. Furthermore, the global sensitivity analysis (PRCC) is also performed to have a more clear insights on the correlations of the control parameter with the model parameters.",

Variations in ecological and climatic factors enhance the possibility of the emergence of new pathogens [1] . Moreover, the evolution of pathogens accelerates the emergence of the disease and worsens the predictability of disease invasion [2] . The diseases like HIV, Small pox, Rabies, Measles, Dengue, Cholera, etc. have been emerged since decades whereas Zika, Ebola, Chikungunya, MERS-CoV, etc. are recently invaded and spread worldwide within a short period of time. Communicable diseases become a potential burden to the socio-economic condition of developing and under developed countries [3] . Some neglected tropical diseases cause physical disabilities and even premature death to human which consequently slow down the economic productivity of a country [4, 5] . Not only human, infectious diseases also victimize the animals, birds causing depletion in economic and agricultural growth. Diseases like avian influenza, foot and mouth disease, viral haemorrhagic septicaemia virus in fish, etc. cause huge economic losses in food, agriculture and aquaculture every year [6] . Moreover, the transmission of diseases among animals, birds, etc. create the possibility of infecting the human population. With the growing advancements in the modern transportation technology, infectious diseases spread in the distant parts of the world very quickly and become a global concern [7, 8] .",

Several modelling frameworks such as deterministic, stochastic, agent based model, chain binomial model, spatial model, etc. have been employed to depict the disease transmission [9] . However, among these approaches, mathematical modelling in a deterministic setting gained considerable attentions perhaps because of its modelling and computational simplicity. In this approach, usually a set of ordinary differential equations are constructed with the assumption that the population under consideration is homogeneously mixed.",

            "text": "The investigation of the consequences of interventions is one of the major aspect in the context of infectious disease modelling. Incorporation of different intervention strategies into the model can be executed in different ways. For instance, to model the behavioural change such as awareness [10, 11] , isolation [12, 13] or to study the impact of vaccination [14] , an extra compartment is usually introduced in the model. On the other hand, in the context of vector borne disease modelling, incorporation of self protection such as use of bed net, application of vector repellent on skin, etc. [15] can be accomplished by introducing a control parameter to capture the reduction in the transmission rate. The application of different vector control strategies, treatment, etc. [16] can also be encapsulated by using a control parameter to capture the increase in the respective rates (mortality rate of vector and recovery rate). To quantify the efficiency as well as the outcomes of the control strategies mainly two popular techniques: optimal control, impulsive control have been applied in numerous studies [17, 18] . In optimal control technique, usually one can seek for a time dependent control parameter for which infection burden and the costs associated with the intervention of the disease is minimized [19, 20] . On the other hand, using impulsive control technique, the effect of non-continuous interventions such as weekly/monthly vector control, spraying of insecticides, etc. are evaluated [21, 22] . These techniques are very useful for the assessment of effectiveness of different intervention strategies in lowering or even eliminating the disease. However, the above mentioned methods are not so useful to analyse the situations where the key objective is to achieve a predetermined infected population after applying suitable control. From epidemiological point of view, attaining a predetermined disease prevalence is an important aspect for public health organizations. World Health Organization (WHO) has adopted proper strategies to achieve targeted disease prevalence for several emerging diseases. For instance, WHO implemented strategies: Stop TB and End TB to achieve targets of 50% reduction in the disease prevalence and disease induced mortality by 2015 and 95% reduction in TB deaths between 2015 and 2035 respectively in India [23] [24] [25] . From a dynamical system's point of view, the problem of achieving a pre-decided infected population can be addressed by adopting Z-type dynamic control method proposed by Zhang et al. [26] . In Z-type control, an exogenous control is introduced in the controlled system and the control mechanism is designed in such a way that the difference between actual system's output and targeted output is forced to converge to zero.",

In the context of infectious disease modelling [35] applied Z-type dynamic control in a simple SI model and analysed the dynamics of the system. The author considered isolation of susceptible individuals through migration as the control measure and explored that the rate of migration can be designed by using Z-control method to control infectious disease. In contrast, Lacitignola et al. [36] recently studied the control of backward bifurcation phenomena using Z-type control mechanism in an SIR disease model, where they considered isolation of a portion of susceptible population by using suitable prevention measures such as masks, hand-washing, gargling, vaccination, etc. However, in the present study we consider a different kind of prevention measure: removal of susceptible population from infected region to a neighbouring infection-free region to control the disease spread. We consider a simple SI model and design a Z-type controlled system aiming to explore the disease dynamics and quantify the rate of removal of susceptible to maintain a specific disease prevalence.",

The demography of the population is considered in the model in order to study the long term behaviour of the system. Total population is partitioned into two compartments: susceptible(S) and infected(I) depending on the health condition of the individuals. Susceptible population is assumed to be recruited via birth, immigration, etc. at a constant rate \u039b. It is also assumed that population is decreased due to natural death at a rate \u00b5. To model the transition from susceptible to infected we consider non-linear incidence rate. There are several studies where non-linear incidence rate has been used to capture the saturated contacts or ''psychological effect'' of the population [37] [38] [39] . Following the above mentioned literatures, we consider the incidence rate as \u03b2SI a+I , which essentially captures more restrained increase in incidence than that of bilinear incidence and exclude the possibility of unrestricted contact rate. Here \u03b2 represents the transmission rate and the parameter a is used to capture the saturation factor. We consider the following set of ordinary differential equation to represent the disease transmission mechanism:",

However, in epidemic situation if the Zcontroller is applied in susceptible population then the update parameter is likely to be positive [35, 36] which implies isolation/removal of susceptible population from the region of epidemic. In the present study, we consider a situation where an infectious disease is prevalent in a region. To lower the disease prevalence, susceptible population is removed from the infected region and moved to an accessible region free from infection. We intend to study the temporal dynamics of the infected population as well as the dynamics of the population in the infection-free region with the help of Ztype control mechanism. The primary aim is to reduce the level of disease endemicity and achieve a targeted infection prevalence by removing susceptible population. Here, we introduce a new compartment consisting of the population of an infection free region to design the Z-controlled system. The susceptible individuals removed from the infected region enter the new compartment and increase the total population of the infection-free region.

This assumption is quite reasonable as the variation in demographic factor is negligible between two neighbouring regions. Here u(t) denotes the time-dependent removal or recruitment rate. It is to be noted that the removal or recruitment is always considered to be dependent on the number of susceptible population of the infected region, not on the number of population in the infection-free region. To control the spread of infection or to eradicate the disease, we indirectly control the abundance of susceptible individuals by means of restricted migration depending on the abundance susceptible population in the region of infection. Such restricted migration (extrinsic control) is designed by indirect Z-control parameter. We are to derive an analytical expression for u(t) from Eq.

Therefore, instead of considering the Z-controlled system (4.1), if we apply Z-control to the two compartments SI model (2.1), the overall dynamics of these two controlled systems would not be changed in terms of achieving a desired abundance of infected. However, the inclusion of the new compartment, N(t) in our Z-controlled system helps to identify the differences between the isolation of susceptible individuals by using protecting masks, bed net, vaccine, etc. and the isolation of individuals through migration. In the new Z-control model (SIN) the preventive measure (spatial isolation/removal of a portion of susceptible population) can be incorporated more accurately. After introduction of the compartment N(t), we obtain an upper bound of the desired prevalence I d for which the biological feasibility of the equilibrium is preserved. If we wish to achieve a desired infected abundance below the threshold value then the Z-control method can be applied successfully. However, if the desired infected state is greater than that threshold, then the Z-control method will not work (will not preserve the positivity of the solution trajectories of the controlled system).",

In such a situation, we fix I d = 10 and simulate the system (4.5) along with the update parameter u(t) given in Eq. (4.3) using the in-built function ode45 in MATLAB (Mathworks, R2014a).

The control parameter u(t) assumes positive values throughout the specified time interval (see Fig. 1 ). Positive value of u(t) indicates the removal of susceptible population from infected region to the infection-free region which is indeed practically feasible. Fig. 1 shows that removal of susceptible population from infected region to infectionfree region can effectively achieve the targeted disease prevalence. Initially, 0.14% susceptible population should be removed and the percentage of removal increases from 0.14% to 0.16% between the time interval [0, 760]. In the subsequent time interval ([761, 4656]), the rate of removal decreases and achieve the desired infected population.

We see from the Fig. 2 that the system (4.5) asymptotically converges to the controlled equilibrium (S c , I c , N c ) = (1000, 0, 1500). This implies that the disease eradication is possible by removing the susceptible population from the infected region to an infection-free region. Similar to the case described earlier, the removal rate gradually increases at the initial time period and attains the maximum value 0.3 and in the subsequent time it decreases and converges to zero (see Fig. 2 ). It is observed that in order to eradicate the disease stronger control effort (u(t)) is required. It is to be noted that, once the infected population become zero, in the subsequent time there is no requirement of removal of susceptible population to maintain the disease free state.",

For each parameter 1000 samples are drawn from uniform distribution from a biologically relevant interval. The dynamics of the PRCC values between u(t) and the input parameters are depicted in Fig. 6 . The temporal variations of the PRCCs are represented in three time intervals: (i) at initial time interval, (ii) the time interval when transitions occur and (iii) the time interval when system stabilizes (see Fig. 6 ). It is noted that u(t) and the natural death rate \u00b5 are negatively correlated at the beginning and become positively correlated in the transition time and subsequently the correlation becomes negative. The transmission rate is positively correlated with u(t) throughout the time interval and specifically during the stabilization period the correlation becomes very high. Increase in transmission rate implies higher disease incidence therefore in higher endemicity situation the rate of removal (u(t)) should be higher to achieve the targeted disease state. This might be a possible reason for this positive correlation between \u03b2 and u(t). The design parameter \u03bb is positively correlated with u(t) initially and the correlation becomes negative during transient period and ultimately becomes uncorrelated as the system stabilizes. The recruitment rate of susceptible population in the infected region is always positively correlated with u(t). Since recruitment of susceptible increases the possibility of disease incidence and therefore the removal rate should be kept high to maintain a specified disease state. However the recruitment rate of susceptible in the infection free region does not possess any correlation with u(t). This observation is quite obvious since the rate of susceptible removal from infected region should not be dependent on how much population is recruited in the infection free region. The parameter a is negatively correlated and the correlation becomes highly negative when the system has achieved the desired state.",

Here we quantify the maximum value of u(t) (see Fig. 7(A) ) and the final value of u(t) (see Fig. 7 (B)) while achieving the desired infected density. We vary the force of infection and compute the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) of the uncontrolled system which indicates the endemicity of the current epidemic. Then we vary the density of the targeted infected density and calculate the percentage of change among infected population and also note down the maximum value of update parameter u(t) and the end value of the update parameter when the Z-control is successful. The percentage of reduction in infection (i.e. relative cases reduction) for a successful implementation of Z-controller can be more informative than that of absolute value of reduction in infection. Now we use contour plot of the maximum value of u(t) and the end value of u(t). In X -axis we vary the target i.e. percentage of reduction in infected density and in Y -axis we vary the R 0 (i.e. endemicity/infectiousness). This picture can give a better idea for application of Z-control method in various endemic situations (for different disease transmission rate) with different targets such as controlling up to a desired/predetermined disease prevalence. From Fig. 7(A) it is seen that if the required percentage of infection reduction increases then the maximum value of the removal rate (u(t)) increases quite expectedly to achieve the desired disease prevalence. In particular, say for R 0 = 5 to achieve up to 40% case reduction maximum 0.05% susceptible population should be removed (see Fig. 7(A) ). Further it is observed that to reduce 80% infection, maximum 0.25% susceptible population should be removed. It is also noted that to achieve comparatively low cases reduction say up to 30%, in different levels of endemicity (i.e. for different values of R 0 ), the maximum value of the removal rate does not vary much. On the other hand, from Fig. 7 (B) we observe that for a particular value of R 0 , if the required percentage of infected cases reduction increases then the end value of u(t) also increases. Similar to the case of maximum value of u(t) to achieve comparatively low cases reduction for different values of R 0 , a little variation in the end value of the removal rate is observed.",

Our study also provides the insights on the rate of removal to achieve a particular percentage of reduction in infected population for different levels of disease endemicity. This quantified removal rate serves as essential information about the portion of susceptible population should be removed to an infection free region to lower or even eliminate the disease.",

Since it is not always manageable to provide medicines or vaccines in disease outbreak, the removal of susceptible population to safe region might be beneficial in such a situation. The control mechanism described in our study can be applied not only to the fatal human diseases like Ebola, MERS CoV, etc. but also to the diseases which infect animals, birds, fishes, etc. Therefore, we believe that the application of Z-control mechanism to disease dynamics can provide fruitful insights in designing suitable disease control strategy.",
