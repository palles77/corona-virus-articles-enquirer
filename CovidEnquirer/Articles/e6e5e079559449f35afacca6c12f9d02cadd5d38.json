The objectives of this study were to compare the antiviral activity between monomeric catechin and dimeric procyanidin B2 (PB2) using cultivable human norovirus surrogates (feline calicivirus (FCV-F9) and murine norovirus (MNV-1)) and to understand their potential antiviral mechanism using virus-like particles (VLPs) and the P domain of human norovirus GII (HNoV GII.4). Surrogate viruses at 5 log PFU/mL were treated with 0.5-5 mg/mL monomeric catechin monohydrate, PB2 or phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2; control) at 37\u00b0C over 24 h. Infectivity was determined using plaque assays and data from triplicate experiments were statistically analyzed. PB2 at 0.5 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL reduced FCV-F9 to undetectable levels after 3 h and MNV-1 by 0.21 and 1.23 log PFU after 24 h, respectively. Monomeric catechins at 1 mg/mL reduced FCV-F9 to undetectable levels after 6 h and MNV-1 titers to undetectable levels after 24 h. In addition, PB2 was shown to directly bind the P domain, the main capsid structure of HNoVs in the ratio of 1:1 through spontaneous interactions. Electrostatic interactions played a dominant role between PB2 and the P domain. PB2 significantly altered tertiary but not secondary structures of VLPs. Transmission electron microscopy demonstrated that PB2 aggregated VLPs, further indicating interactions between them. These findings indicate that PB2 causes structural changes of the P domain of VLPs, mainly through direct interaction leading to HNoV inactivation.",

            "text": "Human noroviruses (HNoVs) of the Caliciviridae family are recognized as the leading causes of acute gastroenteritis outbreaks and sporadic gastroenteritis in both developed and developing countries, with newly emergent strains that are recognized as being increasingly virulent particularly to the immunocompromised patients (Su and D'Souza, 2012; Zhang et al., 2012; Kageyama et al., 2004) . In the United States, the CaliciNet reported that HNoVs accounted for 80-95% of all cases of gastroenteritis outbreaks from 2009 to 2013 (Hall et al., 2013; Vega et al., 2014) . Moreover, studies on the prevalence of HNoV infections in China were also widely described in recent years (Mai et al., 2013; Xue et al., 2013) . The HNoV genotype GII.4 that caused more than 85% of all outbreaks was reported to be the most prevalent and infectious strain in past years (Vega et al., 2014; Zheng et al., 2010) . HNoVs are still difficult and laborious to cultivate (albeit at low infectious titers currently) (Ettayebi et al., 2016) . The expression of the capsid protein in a baculovirus expression system has shown to result in the self-assembly of virus-like particles (VLPs) that are morphologically and antigenically similar to the native infectious virion (Jiang et al., 1992) . VLPs are used to determine antiviral activity along with cultivable surrogates such as feline calicivirus (FCV-F9), murine norovirus (MNV-1) and Tulane virus (Jiang et al., 1992; Joshi et al., 2017; D'Souza, 2011, 2013; Su et al., 2010a,b,c) . The X-ray crystal structure of the prototype human norovirus VLPs identified two major domains, the shell (S) and protruding (P) domains, linked by a hinge of 8 amino acids (Jiang et al., 1992) , with the P domain further divided into P1 and P2 subdomains. The P2 domain is evolutionarily highly variable and responsible for binding to human histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs) as ligands or host receptors for attachment, in an early infection event that most likely controls host susceptibility and resistance to HNoVs Tan and Jiang, 2011) . Any substance or compounds that can block HNoV-HBGA interaction is likely to inhibit HNoV host entry, infection and thus function as suitable candidate antivirals against HNoVs .",

            "text": "Procyanidins, the oligomeric forms of flavan-3-ols, are polyphenol compounds from the flavonoid group which constitute oligomers or polymers of (+)-catechin and/or (\u2212)-epicatechin units (Fig. 1A) , linked mainly through C4-C8 or C4-C6 bonds (Howell et al., 1998 (Howell et al., , 2005 . These procyanidins are found in a wide variety of food commodities including vegetables and fruits, such as grapes, berries, apples, litchi, tea, cereals, and cocoa beans (Hammerstone et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2012) , with each having varying composition and percentage of monomeric catechins, epicatechin, oligomers and polymers. The most ubiquitous procyanidin dimers present in nature and human diets are the B-type procyanidins, with units that are linked via C4-C8 bonds ( Fig. 1B) (Lizarraga et al., 2007; Joshi et al., 2017) . These substances are known to exhibit an array of health benefits and pharmacological effects such as anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial and antioxidant activities (Alvarez et al., 2012; Khurana et al., 2013; Terra et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2014a) . As reported earlier, these polyphenols have shown antiviral activity against influenza virus (Yang et al., 2014b) , hepatitis C virus (Takeshita et al., 2009) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Zhuang et al., 2009) . Previous studies suggest that antiviral activity is associated with oligomeric procyanidins. For example, oligomeric procyanidins inhibit herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) by abolishing virus entry into the host cell caused by blocking attachment to the cell surface (Gescher et al., 2011; Kimmel et al., 2011) . The procyanidin B2, A2 and especially C1 showed anti-HIV activity in vitro (Shahat et al., 1998) . Additionally, D'Souza (2011, 2013) reported that grape seed extract, which contains large quantities of monomeric, dimeric and trimeric procyanidins, and also cranberry proanthocyanidins (C-PAC) exhibited antiviral activity against the HNoV cultivable surrogates, FCV-F9 and MNV-1 D'Souza, 2011, 2013; Su et al., 2010a,b) . More recently, blueberry procyanidins were reported to have antiviral effects against HNoV surrogates (Joshi et al., 2016 (Joshi et al., , 2017 . However, the specific potential mechanisms of antiviral activities of the various plant polyphenols are still not well-understood.",

The maximum concentration of catechin hydrate used in the viral treatment and assays was 10 mg/mL and for PB2 was 1 mg/mL, however, the host cell lines were only exposed to a maximum 20-fold dilution of the treatment after stopping of the treatment. Thus, each individual host cell line was exposed to catechin hydrate at 0.5 mg/mL or PB2 at 0.05 mg/mL for 2-24 h at 37\u00b0C and observed under the optical microscope to determine visible changes in cell morphology or cytopathic effects. HNoV GII.4 VLPs were expressed in the commercially available baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at Emory University. The procedures followed were described earlier in detail for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification, cloning, transfection, expression, VLP extraction and purification, in a previous study (Liu et al., 2015) . After the VLPs were examined and confirmed by electron microscopy and immunoblotting, they were used in the TEM experiments as capsid proteins to determine the effects of binding. TEM data images were collected using a H-7650 electron microscope (Hitachi, Japan) operating at 30 k, after VLP solutions (0.2 \u03bcg/\u03bcL) were incubated for 1 h with PB2 (0.1 mM) in 10 mM PBS buffer, pH 7.4. These solutions were then concentrated using Microcon ultrafilters (Microcon YM-100) with a 100-kDa cutoff and then standard protocols were followed of transferring to carbon-coated copper grids before visualization.",

The interaction between PB2 and the P domain protein (purity and identity of P domain is depicted by SDS-PAGE in the Supplemental Fig. S1 ) was evaluated by monitoring the intrinsic fluorescence intensity changes of the P domain upon addition of PB2. The fluorescence spectra of P domain protein in the absence and presence of different concentrations of PB2 in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) are shown in Fig. 3 . The P domain exhibited a strong fluorescence peak at 329 nm upon excitation at 280 nm, indicating that most of the observed fluorescence was due to the fluorescent tryptophan (Trp) residues. With the increased concentration levels of PB2, the fluorescence of the P domain was significantly quenched accompanied by a slight red shift of maximum emission wavelength from 327 nm to 332 nm, which may be due to the decreased hydrophobicity in and around Trp. These results suggest that the microenvironment of the P domain changed and an interaction between PB2 and the P domain occurs. However, we do recognize the limitation of this binding study, in that besides PB2, other compounds as controls for binding need to be tested which were not carried out in this current study to determine their role in viral inactivation using the Stern-Volmer equation (See supplemental material for more information).",

The curves of F 0 (steady state fluorescence intensity in the absence of quencher)/F (steady state fluorescence intensity in the presence of quencher) versus PB2 concentration expressed as [Q] for the interaction between PB2 and P domain are shown in Fig. 4 . The perfect linear correlation coefficients can be seen on the plot (R 2 > 0.99) when the PB2 concentration is less than 33 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mol/L, suggesting that the quenching of P domain by PB2 with low concentrations can be interpreted by the Stern-Volmer equation (Fig. 4A ). Fig. 4B shows the Stern-Volmer plots of P domain in the presence of PB2 (5-35 \u00d7 10 \u22126 mol/L) at three different temperatures (298, 303, and 310 K). Correspondingly, the K SV (Stern-Volmer quenching constant) values at these temperatures are shown in Table 3 . All the K SV values for the interaction of P domain with PB2 decreased from 1.87 \u00d7 10 4 to 1.42 \u00d7 10 4 L/mol when the temperature increased from 298 to 310 K, indicating a static quenching mechanism. Moreover, D. Liu et al. Food Microbiology 76 (2018) [346] [347] [348] [349] [350] [351] [352] [353] all the corresponding K q (quenching rate constant) values, a specific constant describing bimolecular collisional deactivation of electronic energy, were more than 2.0 \u00d7 10 10 L/(mol\u00b7s), which is another indicator of static quenching. Based on the slope of the double logarithm regression curve of log 10 [(F 0 -F)/F] versus log 10 [Q] (equation S2 in supplemental materials; Fig. 4C , R 2 > 0.99), the corresponding number of binding sites 'n' and apparent binding constant of chemical with protein (K a ) were calculated at different temperatures (Table 4 ). The number of binding sites was approximately equal to 1 for P domain, suggesting that only one PB2 molecule binds to each P domain peptide.",

Once identified, methods for optimizing their delivery and maintaining potency and stability as well as determination of their mode of action are required. One of the reasons that the mechanisms of action are not well understood is because appropriate animal models are currently unavailable. Therefore, this study was undertaken to compare the effects of monomeric catechin hydrate and PB2 against human norovirus surrogates, FCV-F9 and MNV-1. Procyanidins, which are oligomers or polymers of catechin, have been shown to exert a range of bioactivities, such as antioxidation, anti-inflammation as well as antimicrobial effects (Alvarez et al., 2012; Terra et al., 2009; Joshi et al., 2016 Joshi et al., , 2017 . Overall, the polymeric procyanidins showed higher antiviral effects when compared to monomeric catechins (Joshi et al., 2016) . Specifically, based on previous literature, procyanidins isolated from both blueberries (B-PAC) and cranberries (C-PAC) were shown to have higher effects against human norovirus surrogates (FCV-F9 and MNV-1) within shorter time and at a lower concentration compared to the commercial PB2 and monomeric catechin. While FCV-F9 titers were earlier reported to be reduced to non-detectable levels with 1 and 2 mg/ mL B-PAC after 5 min (Joshi et al., 2016) , an increased concentration of 5 mg/mL catechin hydrate was required to reduce FCV-F9 to non-detectable levels with a longer treatment time of 3 h. Also, the lower concentration of monomeric catechin hydrate at 1 mg/mL was found to reduce FCV-F9 to undetectable levels after 6 h in the current study. The dimeric B-type procyanidins, PB2 showed an intermediate activity between that of polymeric procyanidins and monomeric catechin, where 0.5 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL could reduce FCV-F9 to undetectable levels after 3 h. Thus, for FCV-F9, it appears that the antiviral activity follows the order of procyanidin extract (polymeric polyphenols) being greater than PB2, and PB2 being greater than monomeric catechin hydrate.",

The current study showed that reductions of 0.42 \u00b1 0.02 and 1.76 \u00b1 0.13 log PFU/mL after 3 h with 1 mg/mL and 5 mg/mL catechin hydrate, respectively, were obtained for MNV-1, while increasing treatment time of 6 h was required to cause reduction of MNV-1 titers to non-detectable levels with 5 mg/mL catechin hydrate. Though, 1 mg/mL PB2 could reduce MNV-1 titers by 1.23 \u00b1 0.11 log PFU/mL only after 24 h. Thus, for MNV-1, the antiviral activity of procyanidins was greater than catechin monohydrate, and monomeric catechin hydrate appeared to have better activity than the dimeric PB2. The difference in responses to the monomeric and dimeric catechins between FCV-F9 and MNV-1 could be speculated to be associated with their varying capsid structure and pH stability.",

Thus, it appears that both A-type and B-type procyanidins exhibit antiviral activity against the tested HNoV surrogates. However, these earlier studies showed that a lower concentration of A-type procyanidins from cranberries at 0.3 mg/mL and even at ambient temperature can have similar effects as 0.5 mg/mL B-type procyanidins from blueberries at 37\u00b0C.

This previous study showed that pre-treatment of host cells with B-type procyanidins had some effect in blocking binding of the virus to the host and thus caused reduction in infectious titers. Therefore, it can be postulated that treatment with B-type procyanidins can exert antiviral activity by destroying the viral capsid structure and blocking the binding receptors, both leading to prevention of host attachment (Joshi et al., 2016) .",

            "text": "To understand the broad spectrum and application of these polyphenols from natural sources and particularly cranberries and blueberries for improved function and to improve human health, their effects in model food systems and under gastric conditions along with feeding studies and clinical trials with correlation to food and diet intake need to be undertaken before recommendations can be made as reported earlier (Joshi et al., 2016; Su et al., 2010b) . Recently, the effects of B-PAC in model foods and simulated gastric conditions against cultivable HNoV surrogates were also reported (Joshi et al., 2017) . Polyphenolic compounds are known to bind to various proteins with different binding affinities leading to changes in the structural and functional properties of both polyphenols and proteins (Soares et al., 2007) , which depends on the polyphenol structure, the proteins, and the system conditions. PB2 can bind to proteins, such as bovine serum albumin (BSA) and human salivary \u03b1-amylase (Bartolome et al., 2000; Soares et al., 2007) . In this study the P domain peptide, which is responsible for binding of the HNoV capsid with HBGAs as ligands or receptors for attachment was used to determine whether PB2 affects the structures of the P domain peptide leading to change of the activity. The interaction between PB2 and the P domain was determined by using spectroscopy techniques in vitro. Fluorescence quenching studies showed that PB2 spontaneously binds to the P domain in the ratio of 1:1 with K SV values from 1.87 \u00d7 10 4 to 1.42 \u00d7 10 4 L/mol with the main interaction force being electrostatic interactions. UV and CD spectroscopy showed that PB2 dramatically affected the tertiary structures but did not affect the secondary structures of the P domain. All of these results indicate that a direct interaction between the P domain and PB2 Table 4 The binding constant, K a , the number of binding sites, n, and the thermodynamic parameters for the association of PB2 with the P domain. occurred. Capsid proteins that were aggregated by PB2 further confirmed the results above, leading to a speculation that PB2 can change the conformation or block the antigenic binding site of the P domain, to exert an anti-norovirus effect. Our findings are also consistent with the results from Lipson et al. (2012) , where the anti-rotavirus activity of procyanidins was determined to be due to a blockage of viral antigenic binding determinants by procyanidins (Lipson et al., 2012) . In summary, using FCV-F9 and MNV-1 as cultivable HNoV surrogates together with studies with VLPs (for HNoV GII.4) and the corresponding P domain, PB2 was found to be capable of decreasing HNoV surrogate titers. PB2 could also bind to the capsid structure as well as to the VLPs and the P domain and caused aggregation of the viral particles. Therefore, the proposed mechanism can only be speculated based on these studies that could potentially be associated with a direct binding between PB2 and viral capsid proteins that cause aggregation of viral particles, change in the viral capsid structure and/or blocking of the antigenic binding sites. Overall, dimeric and polymeric polyphenols show potential as antiviral therapeutic options to prevent HNoV illness.",
