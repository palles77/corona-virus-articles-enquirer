Although essential for infection control, contact isolation has recently been associated with adverse effects in patients. We undertook a systematic review to determine whether contact isolation leads to psychological or physical problems for patients. Studies were included if (1) hospitalised patients were placed under isolation precautions for an underlying medical indication, and (2) any adverse events related to the isolation were evaluated. We found 16 studies that reported data regarding the impact of isolation on patient mental well-being, patient satisfaction, patient safety or time spent by healthcare workers in direct patient care. The majority showed a negative impact on patient mental well-being and behaviour, including higher scores for depression, anxiety and anger among isolated patients. A few studies also found that healthcare workers spent less time with patients in isolation. Patient satisfaction was adversely affected by isolation if patients were kept uninformed of their healthcare. Patient safety was also negatively affected, leading to an eight-fold increase in adverse events related to supportive care failures. We found that contact isolation may negatively impact several dimensions of patient care. Well-validated tools are necessary to investigate these results further. Large studies examining a number of safety indicators to assess the adverse effects of isolation are needed. Patient education may be an important step to mitigate the adverse psychological effects of isolation and is recommended.",

            "text": "Antimicrobial resistance has reached near epidemic proportions in US hospitals, leading to establishment of mandatory infection control programmes. Multiple modalities to prevent transmission of resistant organisms have included the development of antimicrobial stewardship programmes, promotion of hand hygiene products, heightened education, and use of strict barrier and isolation precautions. 1 Since 1996 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Atlanta, GA, USA) have recommended the use of Standard and Contact Precautions for multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO) such as meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococcus (VRE) and certain Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) that are 'judged by an infection control program . to be of special clinical and epidemiologic significance.' 2 To prevent transmission of these MDRO, use of contact isolation in patients known to be colonised or infected with these MDRO is recommended and widely used in healthcare institutions. Although essential for preventing transmission of multidrug-resistant pathogens in healthcare institutions, patient isolation has recently been associated with adverse effects in patients, including the possibility of less than optimal care. 3 For example, some have mentioned that the requirement to wear gown and gloves before patient examination may impede the physician's ability to perform adequate physical examination, or provide a disincentive for healthcare workers to enter patient rooms. 4, 5 Similarly, other studies have pointed out the concern that isolation may negatively affect patients' mental health. 6e10 We undertook a systematic review of the literature to determine whether or not there are physical and psychological adverse effects that are associated with patient isolation.",

            "text": "Seven studies used a standardised scoring scale to assess the psychological impact of isolation. 9, 10, 27, 28, 31, 37, 40, 42 These included Hamilton Anxiety/Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D or HAM-A), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Health Illness Questionnaire (HIQ), Self-Esteem Scale (SES), Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), State Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Profile of Mood States (POMS), Abbreviated Mental Test Score (AMTS), Barthel Index, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), and CrowneCrisp Experiential Index (CCEI). Two studies developed their own questionnaire or patient survey to evaluate their primary outcomes. 1, 26 Three other studies used direct observation, 4, 5, 32 and two used the interview method. 34, 36 A number of studies used one or more of these methods in combination (Table II) . 1, 26, 39 Study results and outcome Impact of isolation on patient psychological well-being The main outcome for most of the studies was assessment of the impact of isolation on patient psychology and behaviour. 9, 10, 27, 31, 34, 36, 40 A few studies focused on the effect of isolation on patient safety, 39 satisfaction, 28 or time spent in direct patient care. 1,4,5, 26 Rees et al. focused on the impact of isolation on both patient psychology and satisfaction. 37, 42 The primary outcome of the study by Klein et al. was incidence of nosocomial infection, but it also examined the influence of isolation on quality of care. 32 Among the studies that focused on the psychological impact of isolation, the majority showed a negative impact on patient psychology and behaviour, including higher scores for depression and anxiety, 9, 10, 27, 40 higher angerehostility scores, 31 and reports of fear and loneliness. 34, 36 In the study by Catalano et al., for example, the HADS scores of patients in isolation increased in proportion to their length of isolation, from 7.25 at baseline to 8.83 at week 1 and 11.5 at week 2. 10 By contrast, the scores of controls decreased from 9.78 at baseline to 5.44 at week 1, and finally 4.22 at week 2 (P < 0.001). Similarly, Gammon found that patients on day 7 of isolation also had higher mean scores for anxiety (12.75 vs 8.15) and depression (12.45 vs 7.3), and lower self-esteem scores (14.35 vs 16.1) compared to controls. 27 Tarzi et al. also found that patients in isolation had significantly higher rates of depression (P < 0.01) and anxiety (P < 0.02) than non-isolated patients. 40 There was no significant difference in anger scores. By contrast, Kennedy and Hamilton did not find any statistically significant difference in terms of depression and anxiety between isolated and non-isolated patients, but found higher angerehostility mean scores for patients in isolation (12.4 vs 4.9, P \u00bc 0.037). 31 Maunder et al. focused on the psychosocial response of both patients and healthcare staff to a SARS outbreak. 34 Although no quantitative analysis was performed, the authors found that in patients isolated for SARS, the most prominent emotional effects included fear, loneliness, boredom and anger. In Rees et al.'s cohort where patients were isolated for different types of infections, they found that 12 of 21 patients had mood disturbances as evidenced by high HADS scores. 37, 42 In Newton et al.'s study, among a total of 19 patients, seven felt isolated and complained about lack of attention from nursing staff. Nevertheless 10 patients identified the positive impact of isolation including greater freedom and privacy. Interestingly, most of the patients did not have a clear understanding for the reason for isolation. 36 Wilkins et al. had a cohort of 41 isolated patients. 9 Their CCEI scores for anxiety and hysteria were found to be higher than that in the general population. Scores were also higher on admission than on discharge. Not surprisingly, history of mental illness was associated with higher scores for anxiety.",

Similarly, Kirkland and Weinstein also found that healthcare workers were about two times less likely to enter the room of patients in contact isolation, with mean room entry/h of 3.9 vs 7.9 (P \u00bc 0.06). 5 Contact was also two-fold less in isolated patients, with mean contacts/h of 2.1 vs 4.2 (P \u00bc 0.03). The duration of interaction was not significantly different between isolated patients and controls (4.5 vs 2.8, P \u00bc 0.6). By contrast, Saint et al. found no difference in the number of examinations by senior medical residents among patients in isolation and controls [risk ratio (RR) \u00bc 0.96, P \u00bc 0.58]. 4 However, attending physicians examined patients in isolation less frequently than their non-isolated counterparts (RR \u00bc 0.49, P < 0.001).",

Overall PFSQ scores, to assess quality of care were also similar in both groups (4.7 vs 4.8, P \u00bc 0.209). 26 Similarly Klein et al. found that frequency of contact between patients in isolation and between those under standard precautions was comparable. Patients in isolation also tolerated this well, without apparent adverse effects. 32 Gasink et al. evaluated patient satisfaction by using the CAHPS survey. 28 Among a cohort of 86 patients, of whom half were isolated, they did not find any statistical difference between the responses of patients in isolation and patients not in isolation, regarding inpatient care. Of the 39 patients in isolation, only 3 (7.7%) thought that isolation worsened their care, whereas 24 (61.5%) thought that it improved theirs. In the second part of the two-part study by Rees et al., patient satisfaction was greatest in the patients who were kept informed regarding their care. 37 Among the 21 patients, 66.7% felt that they were given enough information, and 85.7% felt that they knew someone they could ask regarding healthcare issues. In a study that assessed patient safety, the authors found that compared with patients not in isolation, isolated patients had more errors in processes of care, and had increased likelihood for adverse events. 39 For example, isolated patients were more likely to have either incomplete recordings of vital signs (14 vs 9%, P < 0.001), or to have days with no vital sign recordings at all (5 vs 1%, P \u00bc 0.02). In addition, they had more days with either no nursing narrative notes (14 vs 10%, P < 0.001), or physician progress notes (26 vs 13%, P < 0.001) recorded in the chart. Isolated patients were twice as likely as control patients to experience adverse events per 1000 days (31 vs 15, P < 0.001). This reflected preventable (20 vs 3, P < 0.001) as opposed to non-preventable events (11 vs 12, P \u00bc 0.98). Specifically, patients in isolation were as much as eight times more likely to experience supportive care failures such as falls, ulcers, and fluid and electrolyte abnormalities. There were no significant differences in terms of severity of adverse event or death. Not surprisingly, patients in isolation expressed greater dissatisfaction regarding their care, as reflected by both formal and informal complaints (30 vs 8%, P < 0.001). A summary of these findings is shown in Table II .",

The majority of the literature we reviewed suggests that adverse psychological consequences of isolation exist. Our results update, and are in keeping with, a recent systematic review published on this subject. 43 Most of the studies that focused on patient psychology used standardised scoring scales to assess patient mood and behaviour. However, the use of several different scoring scales makes comparison among studies challenging. In addition, the timing of assessment during isolation was also highly varied. This may have impacted the overall results because of recall bias. Nevertheless, the majority of studies found that the physical process of isolation has a negative impact on patients' moods, including increased rates of depression, anxiety, fear, and hostility.",

Future studies to assess the adverse impact of isolation precautions should examine a broader array of safety indicators, in addition to the psychological aspects. As the problem of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in healthcare institutions continues to grow, isolation will remain and increase in importance as a critical infection control intervention to reduce nosocomial transmission of MDRO. Attention must be paid to the possible collateral damage of isolation, and adverse effects should be monitored closely.",
