The requirement for hemorrhagic disease is likely due to virus entering the oral cavity via gingival bleeding, and a similar pathway to infection is also plausible. It will be important to determine the relationship between hemorrhagic CHIKV infections and compromised immunity in salivabased transmission.",

Nonetheless, the study is potentially of great significance, particularly in the context of severe hemorrhagic disease and immunodeficiency. Many countries most affected by CHIKV have high numbers of immunocompromised patients, particularly due to HIV infection, but also due to other infections, other morbidities, intrinsic immunodeficiency, or even extreme age. In addition to increased susceptibility to CHIKV infection, many of these patients likely have oral lesions, which could also promote transmission and infection via saliva. The impact within this patient population could be highly significant. CHIKV infections can spread extremely rapidly through communities and we wonder whether transmission via saliva can contribute to this rapid spread. Further studies are required to rigorously test for CHIKV transmission via saliva, but this preliminary study suggests that we need to seriously consider this mode of transmission.",

Hepatitis B transmission can occur through saliva [5] , but there are no established reports of transmission via saliva for HIV or hepatitis C [6] . Ebola virus is present in the saliva of infected individuals and although it seems likely that transmission via saliva does occur, the significance of this route of transmission is unclear, particularly as the virus is inactivated rapidly in saliva [7] . A number of viruses can be transmitted through open sores in the mouth, with saliva as the vehicle for transmission. Of course, many respiratory viruses can also be transmitted by saliva. Thus, the significance of viruses in saliva for transmission varies greatly from virus to virus, from highly transmissible to not at all.",

To our knowledge, this is the first report of likely arbovirus transmission via saliva. This mode of transmission has not been considered to date in models assessing CHIKV spread. Although it is unlikely that measuring CHIKV in saliva will have broad diagnostic value, its presence in the saliva may have prognostic value, particularly in relation to disease severity. The possibility of aerosol transmission also needs to be considered. It is intriguing to consider the possibility that CHIKV in the saliva could be related to the neurological complications reported in a minority of CHIKV cases [2] : could salivary CHIKV lead to central nervous system (CNS) infections via olfactory neurons, as has been described for a number of other viruses [9] ? More study is required to assess the significance of CHIKV in the saliva, particularly in immunocompromised patients. This needs urgent attention as it will have a major influence on efforts to counter the spread of this emerging virus. The possibility of saliva-mediated transmission of other arboviruses also needs to be reassessed. [2] . Therefore, recombination analysis should be performed before phylogenetic analysis of MERS-CoV",

            "text": "There are four possible routes of MERS-CoV transmission in humans and camels, namely camel-to-human, human-tohuman, camel-to-camel, and human-tocamel ( Figure 1 ). The former three routes have been well accepted [3, 4] . In the Sabir et al. study [1] , the high prevalence again suggests that MERS-CoV is enzootic in dromedary camels and could be transmitted among camels. However, the humanto-camel transmission is theoretically possible but largely ignored [5] , because of the obsession of animals as sources of human viruses. Recent studies reveal influenza A virus can be transmitted from human to a range of animal species (especially swine), a phenomenon known as reverse zoonosis [6] . For another CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), reverse zoonosis has been reported in cats and pigs [7] . When inspecting Sabir et al.'s phylogenetic trees of MERS-CoV (Figures 1, S2 , and S3 in [1] ), we found many viruses of camel origin fell within the diversity of human viruses. There are two possible explanations for this phylogenetic pattern: (i) It is artifact due to sampling bias, if many camel viral strains are not sampled. If this is the case, we must miss substantial diversity of MERS-CoV and should expand our surveillance in camels to fully capture the MERS-CoV diversity. (ii) MERS-CoV could be transmitted from humans to camels, which means that humans serve as a source of MERS-CoV for camels. The role of camels in generating and maintaining MERS-CoV diversity has been repeatedly emphasized [1] . If human-to-camel transmission occurs, it requires us to refine our concept of the definition of a 'breeding ground' for MERS-CoV, which has important practical implications for developing vaccination strategies and control measures.",

            "text": "). It follows that the barrier of human-animal transmission is relatively lower for MERS-CoV. It is of great importance to understand the mechanisms underlying the difference of transmission pattern between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, with the implications for assessing the emergence risk of other CoVs.Although the study of Sabir et al. provides important insights into the evolution and transmission of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels, several outstanding questions arise: (i) What is the evolutionary and pathogenic significance of recombination in MERS-CoV? Comparing the pathogenicity of parental and recombinant strains might help resolve this question. (ii) Does human-to-camel transmission occurs in MERS-CoV? The phylogenetic analysis of Sabir et al. suggests this possibility. Also, there are some other clues for this type of transmission [5], but rigorous experimental evidence is still needed. (iii) Are there other intermediate hosts for MERS-CoV? To date, other than camels, sheep, cows, and chickens have been detected for MERS-CoV infections. But none of them show serological evidence of MERS-CoV infection [9]. Nevertheless, more animal species should be sampled. (iv) What is the mechanisms underlying the difference of interspecies transmission between SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV? Both ecological and molecular mechanisms [e.g., the usage of dif-In summary, Sabir et al.'s study reveals the extensive diversity of MERS-CoV in dromedary camels. Further studies and surveillance, as conducted by Sabir et al. [1], will help improve our understanding of the evolution, ecology, and humananimal interface of MERS-CoV.",
