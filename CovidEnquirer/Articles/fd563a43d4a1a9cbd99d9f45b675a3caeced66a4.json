Respiratory viruses were reported to cause respiratory damage in patients with cystic fibrosis [3, 4] . Wat et al. suggested that respiratory viruses were associated with 40% of the pulmonary exacerbations in CF patients, which led to disease progression and pulmonary function test (PFT) abnormalities [5] . Armstrong et al. showed that 52% of CF infants who were admitted to the hospital because of respiratory symptoms had viral infections. Thirty-five percent of them had acquired Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) compared with 6% of those who were not hospitalized. The author also showed an association between respiratory viral infections and the inflammatory changes in the airway [6] . This is because respiratory viral infections cause respiratory epithelial injury, which leads to increased adherence of bacterial pathogens to pharyngeal cells. These bacteria include Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus), Hemophilus Influenzae (H. influenzae), Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) [6] .",

Viral infection may be associated with some common CFTR mutations.",
