Population estimates were extracted from national publicly available sources (1-4). Data on arrivals of visitors to and from the Middle East source countries, per nationality/ country of residence, were extracted from the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) Yearbook of Tourism Statistics (5); for UAE official tourism statistics were used as well (6,7). Travel volumes extracted from UNWTO Yearbook include all modes of travel (air, road, sea) and refer to 2012. For arrivals of visitors to the Middle East, data from UNWTO yearbook were extracted for Saudi Arabia and Jordan. For the United Arab Emirates (UAE), visitor data were only available for Dubai (for 2012) and Abu Dhabi (period: Jan-Apr 2013) for the United Kingdom, the United States, France, Italy, Netherlands; the travel volume for Abu Dhabi was scaled to a arrivals of visitors from the source countries on destination countries were extracted from UNWTO Yearbook of Tourism Statistics. Information on arrivals of Middle East source country visitors to Algeria, Austria, France, the Netherlands, and Greece was not available. Information on the length of stay of visitors in the Middle Eastern source countries was taken from different sources. For visitors traveling to Jordan and Qatar, data were drawn from the UNWTO Compendium of Tourism Statistics (8). For Qatar, data were only available for 2008; for Jordan, 2012 data were used (8). For Saudi Arabia, length of stay was obtained per nationality for 2006 from official statistics (9). For each nationality, number of passengers per length of stay interval was available. The final length of stay was a weighted average between the midpoints for each interval, in which the weights were the share of travelers in that length of stay category. Lengths of stay larger than 10.2 days were limited to 10.2 days (the upper bound of the incubation period [10]), to restrict the estimated number of exportations to infectious cases. If using a longer time, exportations would include number of residents in the Middle East source countries that had MERS-CoV cases but were no longer infectious, less useful to understand risk of person-to-person transmission in the destination countries. For UAE, data were retrieved from Dubai (2012 data) and Abu Dhabi (Jan-Apr 2013) official websites (6,7). For UAE, length of stay data were not available per nationality and so an average across all international destination countries was used. For source countries residents visiting abroad, duration of exposure in the source countries was taken to be 10.2 days, the upper bound of the incubation period, again to restrict our estimations to arriving MERS-CoV infectious cases (10). Estimation Overview For each destination country, we calculated the expected number of exportations, and the probability of exportation from each of the source countries (Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, UAE) among travelers to and from the source countries. For each source country, the expected number of cases among travelers was calculated by multiplying the infection rate among residents in the affected countries by the person-time at risk among travelers (11). The incidence rate of infection among travelers was estimated by multiplying the travel volume by the average duration of stay of travelers in each source country. To calculate the expected number of symptomatic cases exported to the destination country we further adjusted for under-reporting: expected number of symptomatic cases exported to destination country = ratio of symptomatic to reported cases \uf0b4 [cases in source country)/(total population in source \u00d7 outbreak duration)] \uf0b4 [(number of travelers) \uf0b4 (traveler's duration of stay)] (1).",
