Thereafter, with the extensive use of tissue cultures in the 1950s, more enteroviruses were isolated which were not pathogenic for animals, or humans such as ECHO viruses (enteric cytopathogenic human orphan) (reviewed by McLean, 1966 , Artenstein et al., 1965 , Karzon et al., 1956 , Grist et al., 1975 . Finally, in the late 1950s viruses were at last isolated from patients with common colds and these were classified as rhinoviruses (Tyrrell, 1965) . Probably in excess of 150 viruses of the latter group circulate in man. Nowadays, all these viruses are designated as 'enterovirus' serotypes (Table 4 .4).",

There is evidence that the RI is an intermediate in virus R N A synthesis. I t consists of an R N A molecule which serves as a template for the simultaneous semiconservative synthesis of several R N A molecules (between six and seven for poliovirus) with nucleotide sequences complementary to that of the template. Two types of RI could existthat using a minus-strand R N A to produce plus-strands (positive RI) and that using a plus-strand R N A to produce minus-strands (negative RI). Unlike RI, which is partially sensitive to the action of ribonuclease, RF is highly resistant to this enzyme, and since it is infective it must contain an intact plusstrand, which is hydrogen-bonded to a minus-strand. R N A synthesis switches from exponential to linear synthesis early in infection, the time varying between 1 and 3.5 h after infection and depending upon input multiplicity. This switch implies that the concentration of positive RI (the structure responsible for the synthesis of the major product) is constant throughout the latter period of infection. This could most readily be explained if synthesis of the template of positive RI (the minus-strand) ceased a t the switch point, or alternatively was produced at a rate equal to its degradation. It may be important that the switch occurs at the time when the virus R N A is beginning to be encapsidated to form progeny virus.",

Second attacks of polio are rare (Bodian, 1951) and, as far as is known, vaccination with one serotype (e.g. type 1) will protect against all members of these type I serotypes, although individual viruses may differ in virulence (Boulger et a] ., 1979), biochemical properties (Romanova et al., 1981) and antigen composition (Nakano et al., 1963 . Polio is a highly infectious disease and infection rates may reach 100% in infant classes. Personal contact is the main method of spread. A seasonal incidence is marked in temperate countries but outbreaks may still occur in winter, whereas in tropical areas it occurs throughout the entire year (Paul, 1955) .",

Most patients excrete virus for 2-3 weeks and more rarely for 6 weeks. The virus then passes to the regional lymph nodes and probably then reaches the bloodstream. At this stage there is no clinical evidence of invasion of the central nervous system (CNS). There is little doubt that the virus travels along neural pathways from the periphery to the CNS and spread becomes neural once the CNS is reached. Certainly, if antibody is present in the blood the virus does not reach the CNS. A basis for a successful immunization is thus apparent already ~ induction of neutralizing antibody in the serum and local IgA antibody in the gut. The incubation period is as long as 2-3 weeks. The most remarkable feature of the pathology of polio is the very high selectivity of the virus for nervous tissue, where it can cause rapid and widespread damage to the central nervous system. The primary changes are to the neurones which can be destroyed.

The distribution of lesions in the CNS seems very similar in most cases of polio and the clinical symptoms depend on the severity of damage to nerve cells (Lassen, 1956) . The brain is normally invaded, particularly in the brain stem area (Baker, 1949) . The virus can also be isolated from extraneural tissues e.g. lymphoid tissue including Peyers patches and mesenteric lymph nodes (Horstmann et al., 1954, Wenner and Rabe, 1951) . The proportion of inapparent to paralytic infections may be as high as 1000 to 1 in children and 75 to 1 in adults. The disease is often described as biphasicminor and major illness. In the minor phase the symptoms are non-specific, with malaise as the common symptom and may clear up after 3-4 days. The major illness may occur without preceding illness and the first symptoms are meningitis, with headache, fever, malaise and vomiting with an abrupt onset (Christie, 1948) . The meningitic phase often concludes in a week. However, in a minority of persons paralysis sets in and first becomes apparent after a couple of days of meningitis symptoms (Fig. 4.3 and 4.4) . In the worst cases nearly every skeletal muscle can be paralysed and the person cannot swallow or breathe properly, whereas in mild cases only a part of one muscle may be affected. Paralysis is a lower motor neurone type with flaccidity of affected muscle and develops quickly. In bulbar poliomyelitis, paralysis of cranial nerves occurs and paralysis of the pharynx is a feature. In fact, the inability to swallow is the main clinical characteristic of bulbar poliomyelitis. Signs of other cranial nerve involvement may be present, facial weakness and paralysis of the flexor muscles of the neck being the commonest. Respiration may be deeply disordered and there may be pharyngeal paralysis (Baker, 1949) .",

Often great improvement takes place in these weeks but by the end of one month muscles still paralysed will probably remain paralysed. In bulbar polio the outlook is good if the patient is still alive by the 10th or so day since the pharyngeal muscles then begin to show signs of recovery. The basic principles for clinical care are outlined by Christie (1980) with his characteristic flair \"to accept into ones care a patient stricken with a disease that may cut him off for all time from a return to normal life, but to ensure at every stage of his illness whether his life is at risk from respiratory failure or a limb is made useless by paralysis, that the exact nature of his disability is analysed as accurately as the medical sciences and clinical skill can measure it and, when that has been done, to bring to his aid all the sovereign art of modern medicine.\" Fortunately, the development of polio vaccines was given considerable priority in the late 1950s following the new developments of tissue culture technology (reviewed by Enders et al., 1980) . Few clinicians, at least in Europe, USA, Japan, Australia and the USSR have now to diagnose polio or to care for the ravages of the virus in children.

Polio vaccine (Melnick, 1954 , Koprowski et al., 1956 , Salk, 1960 , Salk and Salk, 1967 ) has been used so successfully in many countries that the virus and vaccine can be used as an example of a situation where the remote risks of vaccination itself begin to assume major importance (see below).

Polioviruses have been classified into three serotypes ( I , 2 and 3) according to the ability of type-specific antisera to neutralize infectivity. The virus exists in two different antigenic forms: the D antigen, which is associated with the infectious particles, and the C antigen, which is associated with non-infectious particles (Mayer et al., 1957 , le Bouvier et al., 1957 , Roizman et al., 1959 . As infectivity is associated with D antigen particles, it has been assumed that this immunogen is largely responsible for the production of neutralizing antibodies. Most immunochemical work with polioviruses, as well as with other picornaviruses, has been carried out with intact virus particles in which the capsid proteins are arranged in complex structural configurations, so that the immunological and antigenic properties of individual virus proteins could not be shown. In contrast, for foot-and-mouth disease virus it has been possible to establish that immunization with the trypsin-sensitive protein (VPI) induces neutralizing antibodies (Meloen et al., 1979) .

Indeed RNA hybridization shows a high degree of homology between certain members and so common amino acid sequences with corresponding antigenic relationships may exist. Certainly, antigenic cross-reactions have been noted among certain serotypes such as coxsackie A3 and A8 for example, between A9 and 1 I coxsackie B viruses. Again with the ECHO viruses, heterotypic cross reactions occur between some viruses, e.g. types 1 and 8, and between 12,29,23 and 22. Thorpe et al. (1982) using the sensitive immunoblot technique have described antigenic relationships between VP 1 of polio types I, 2 and 3. Furthermore, certain monoclonal antibodies directed towards the C antigen of polio type 3 reacted with VPI of this virus. VPI seems to be immunodominant regardless of the form of the immunizing antigen. A recent report (Blondel et al., 1982) suggests that immunization with VPI causes the production of neutralizing antibodies and in this respect the immune response to poliovirus VPI may be similar to that to VPI of foot-and-mouth disease virus and to VP2 of coxsackie virus (Meloen et al., 1979 , Beatrice et al., 1980 . Although homotypic antibodies binding to VP2 were detected with hyperimmune sera, no heterotypic cross-reactivity was observed for this protein.",

Also, perhaps not unexpectedly Sabin enthusiastically supports the widespread use of live vaccine whilst Salk confines his interest to killed polio vaccine. Both vaccines have their merits and weaknesses and it may not be possible to decide between them (Tables 4.7 and 4.8).

This is because attenuated viruses may (and do) revert to virulence on occasion (Nathanson, 1982). As mentioned above the genetic determinants of virulence or attenuation for polio virus are not known and it will require extensive biochemical analysis of the genome of a number of attenuated and virulent viruses, mutants and recombinants to establish the genetic basis of virulence. At this stage one could envisage that an attenuated and stable variant could be constructed by using DNA technology (see Chapter 2 ) . On the other hand, it may not be practicable to produce large enough quantities of inactivated vaccine cheaply enough for a total eradication campaign and moreover, if the manufacture of vaccine is extended more widely then escapes of virulent virus in incompletely inactivated vaccine may occur. An early example of such an accident was the Cutter affair in the USA where 92 children contracted paralytic poliomyelitis following immunization with insufficiently inactivated vaccine (Nathanson and Langmuir, 1963) . It could be added however that nowadays, should large scale manufacture of inactivated polio vaccine be reinitiated then viruses would be chosen with less than full virulence to avoid potential problems of incomplete inactivation (Salk et al., 1981) . Genetic engineering techniques could now be explored to produce immunogenic polio proteins and synthetic peptides which would side step any 'failure of inactivation' problems although these synthetic techniques are likely to produce problems of their own (see Chapter 2). We can conclude that both vaccines have had their successes and failures, both vaccines are not in evolutionary blind alleys and can be improved in the near future, and both vaccines probably have a long and useful life and function ahead of them.",

This property of neurotropism of polio in vivo and early studies in cell culture which were wrongly interpreted as indicating that polio could only replicate in neural tissues delayed work with the virus and, moreover, erroneously led to deductions that droplet infection and subsequent invasion of the CNS via the olfactory nerve endings was the major point of entry of the virus in humans. In fact it could be said that the early studies of 'chemotherapy' were initiated by these observations and sodium alum, zinc sulphate and picric acid were all used unsuccessfully to prevent paralysis (Armstrong and Harrison, 1935 , Sabin et al., 1936 , Olitsky and Sabin, 1937 , Schultz and Gebhardt, 1937 , Armstrong, 1937 . Sabin and Ward (1941) were among the first to appreciate that the alimentary tract was a major site for polio virus replication in man. Studies in the 1940s and 1950s established that although polio virus could be isolated in flies and cockroaches, and antibodies detected in cattle and chimpanzees (Sabin and Ward, 1942 , Melnick and Penner, 1952 , Sabin and Fieldsteel, 1952 , nevertheless the viruses are maintained in nature by human to human transmission. Epidemiological studies in Eskimoes demonstrated that antibodies to polio persisted for at least 40 years in the absence of re-infection and that natural infection gave rise to complete or partial resistance in the intestine. The scientific ground work was therefore laid for the production and application of polio vaccines. Theiler (1941) reported laboratory modification of the neurotropic property of polio and Koprowski et al. (1952) described for the first time that an immune response could be produced in humans following infection with an attenuated (mouse adapted) type 2 polio virus which had reduced intra-cerebral virulence for monkeys. Finally, the clear demonstration by Enders et al. (1952) that all three polio virus types could replicate in cell cultures of non-nervous tissue (see below) and simultaneously lose monkey virulence (Table 4 .9.) opened the way to the extensive laboratory studies leading to the development of successful formalin inactivated and also live attenuated polio vaccines.",

            "text": "Salk commenced work on producing an inactivated polio vaccine with the premise that circulating serum IgG antibody provided protection against the clinical signs of polio and therefore as long as a killed vaccine induced such antibody in suficient quantity it would be effective. (Earlier work in his laboratory had been orientated towards developing live attenuated viruses, but this ceased as soon as it was apparent that tissue culture cultivated formalin-inactivated virus was immunogenic.) His group demonstrated that virus concentration (and hence antigen concentration) was the single most important variable factor in vaccine production, rather than the inactivation process per se. Inactivation with 1/4000 formalin at 35\u00b0C at pH 7.0 resulted in a constant rate decline of virus infectivity for the first 2; days. However, even at this early stage inactivation of lots of vaccine varying from 30 to 50 litres was showing some variation between manufacturers, with satisfactory 'base line' virus inactivation in one manufacturer detected at 6-9 days but 13 days at another production plant (12 days was later chosen as safer after the Cutter incident). If inactivation proceeded for too lengthy a period then immunogenicity decreased, and hence the time period was critical. Early experiments in monkeys established that vaccine given in three divided doses was more immunogenic than a single large dose. Table 4 .10 summarizes the data from some of the first trials in children who had no antibody prior to immunization with polio vaccine and the effect of boosting at 7 months and at 20 months (Table  4 .1 1). Quite clearly the era of successful immunization against polio had commenc- ed, although problems of incomplete and variable inactivation of virus were to be noted immediately the vaccine process was scaled up to produce the tens of millions of doses required for mass immunization (Nathanson and Langmuir, 1963) . As regards production of polio vaccine nowadays, human diploid cells are used by some manufacturers and still other cell substrates are being considered for polio vaccine production mainly because of the immediate shortage of monkeys and safety considerations but additional advantages might be increased yields of virus (Van Wezel et al., 1978 , Marel et al., 1981 . Possible new cell substrates are: 1: subcultured monkey cells rather than primary cells. In addition, newly devel-2: primate embryo diploid cells (in addition to human diploid cells). 3: continuous cell lines e.g. Vero (these cells have been suggested because of evi-4: 'suspension' cultures of cbntinuous cell lines using Sephadex beads.",

Good cell growth of M K cells is obtained in monolayers and in microcarrier cultures for up to 3 passages (approx. 12 cell generations) although the cells stop growing after 7-8 passages. 15-20 monkeys per year will then be required to produce 3-4 x loh doses of vaccine. Although diploid cells have many favourable properties (absence of viruses, strict control on karyotype (Chapter 2)) they require high quality serum for growth and are less suitable for large scale cultivation. Finally, Vero cells may be suitable particularly since polio virus will be inactivated with formalin at the final stages (so inactivating any adventitious or unknown virus) and these cells can be cultivated in microcarrier systems. Criteria for seed polio viruses for inactivated vaccine include stability, immunogenicity, and replication rate but the most important factor is immunogenicity. Type 2 strains (MEFI) with type 3 (Saukett) induce much higher antibody levels than a comparable antigenic mass of type 1 (G. Mahoney) polio. It has also been recognized that antigenic differences exist within polio types and so the antigenic structure of the vaccine strain should be representative of field strains. Type I virus still gives problems of antigenic instability after formalin inactivation. For final vaccine production, cell debris are removed by filtration and the virus suspension concentrated by ultrafiltration and standardized using D antigen concentration, or by single radial diffusion techniques. Gel filtration on Sepharose (to remove remaining serum proteins), followed by ion exchange on DEAE Sephadex is used to remove further impurities. The original inactivation techniques developed by Salk ( ! 955) using formaldehyde at elevated temperatures has proved successful also for purified polio virus suspensions (Van Wezel et a]., 1978). It could be added that attenuated polio viruses could be used nowadays for production of inactivated polio vaccine thus avoiding potential problems of virus escaping inactivation and infecting and paralysing recipients.",

However, it should be realised that several other groups were actively working at the same problem and several potential 'candidate' vaccine strains had been selected (Koprowski et al., 1952 , Enders et al., 1952 , Melnick, 1954 . They soon found that mere passage had no attenuating effect but, significantly, use of high inocula together with rapid passage favoured the overgrowth of virions able to replicate well in non-nervous tissue and the harvests had diminished virulence for monkeys (Table 4 .12). This suggested a mixed population originally and therefore terminal cloning was carried out and non-virulent variants of all three polio types obtained (Sabin, 1955) . A marked diminution in intramuscular and oral infective capacity for cynomolgus monkeys was noted for these strains (Table 4 .13) and these monkeys produced antibodies in response to infection. Sabin had selected a variant of the mouse passaged Mahoney strain (type 1) which was potentially useful as a vaccine strain, and early tentative trials in volunteers confirmed attenuation of these viruses (Table 4 .14).",

However, Sabin (1955) had by now developed several live attenuated candidate vaccine viruses and since he did not want to interfere with the still progressing trials of Salk vaccine in the USA, he initiated large scale trials in Eur- ope. By this stage the genetic basis of virulence of these new polio strains had been established, at least tentatively, and several phenotypic virological markers which co-segregated with virulence had been observed. Thus, attenuated polio strains often possessed ts or ca properties. In fact it appeared, in retrospect, that since the early tissue culture passage experiments to 'attenuate' these viruses had been carried out at low temperatures of 35\"-36\" C this may have also increased the selection pressure for ts attenuated virus subpopulations (Sabin, 1958) . Large scale polio immunization was carried out in Europe in collaboration with the large and active virology group in Leningrad and these represent, in retrospect, a classic series of experiments both scientifically and for the benefit of mankind. Initially small groups of children were immunized, but as increasing clinical and laboratory experience showed no adverse effects the campaign was widened. Thus, some of the early clinical trials were carried out with Sabin live vaccine virus in the baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania and Esthonia (Chumakov et al., 1959) . Twenty seven thousand individuals were immunized with vaccine provided by Sabin but a further 10 million people were fed with first passage material grown in the USSR. The first cycle of immunizations was carried out in January-March 1959 (Table  4 .15 and 4.16). Almost half the susceptible population in Lithuania received live virus vaccine and convincing proof of the highly immunogenic characteristics of the virus was obtained. Trivalent mixtures were also used effectively with children developing antibody to all three types.",

Also inactivated polio vaccine may not produce herd immunity which is assumed to be so important, since in these countries, the faecal-oral route of transmission is most common and inactivated polio may only reduce transmission via the pharyngeal route (Gelfand et al., 1959 , Chin et al., 1961 . Therefore, further research is clearly needed before a decision is made on the strategy for the control and eradication of poliomyelitis in developing countries. Meanwhile, however, we might learn from the very useful data on the experience of eradication of polio in certain countries like the USA using live vaccine, or in Scandinavia using inactivated vaccine.",

Naturally occurring poliomyelitis due to indigenous wild poliovirus essentially disappeared from the USA after 1972 (Nathanson, 1982) . Nevertheless, 5-10% of children under 16 years of age in the USA are considered to remain susceptible to polio because vaccine coverage is not 100% (Table 4 .19). This success in eradication of polio in the USA was achieved mainly by the use of attenuated vaccine (Table 4 .20), but the continuing problem with this vaccine is the, albeit small, number of vaccine-associated cases of poliomyelitis (Schonberger et al., 1976) which approximate to 2 paralytic cases per million vaccinees. In the USA with 3.5 million children being immunized yearly 7 paralytic cases are expected, caused by the vaccine virus, of which one third occur in recipients of vaccine and two thirds in contacts, who are mainly adults.",

Sweden and Finland (1950-1976) An example of the problem was the outbreak of polio in an unimmunized pocket of Amish fundamentalist Protestants, where I3 cases of polio occurred (Chapter 17). In the post-eradication era in the USA there is a constant risk of introduction of wild type virus. It would seem unnecessary to change vaccine at present in the USA, but inactivated polio vaccines could be used with benefit in immunocompromised individuals (Davis et a]., 1977) , for adult contacts of children immunized with live vaccine, or for boosting immunity in adults travelling abroad. An important, and as yet incompletely answered question, is whether inactivated polio vaccine could reduce the spread of virus in the alimentary tract or circulation of virus in the community. Early experience with inactivated polio vaccines in the USA in 1960 would suggest that inactivated polio vaccine did inhibit virus circulation (Marine et al., 1962) . Thus, studies of polio outbreaks in single towns with high and low socio-economic groups showed clustering in the latter groups and few cases in the former groups. Also polio virus isolations from sewage were infrequent in the upper class areas but were frequent in the lower class areas. In an outbreak in 1960 on Rhode Island polio clustered in two lower class areas in Pawtucket (a high attack rate of 12.873, whereas other areas remained free from polio.

The most likely interpretation is that the better vaccinated affluent neighbourhoods were not subject to the silent ecological spread of virus at a time when there was an intense epidemic in a low class area.",

Although there was some evidence of infection in unimmunized classmates of cases, widespread transmission of virus did not occur. As mentioned above, it seems quite possible that inactivated polio vaccine has an inhibitory effect on pharyngeal excretion of polio virus. Gelfand et al. (1959) followed families who had received inactivated polio vaccine. When wild polio was introduced into the household previous immunization of children had no influence on virus spread and faecal excretion of virus was the same in vaccinated and unvaccinated persons. In contrast, spread of polio was limited in upper economic households and a possible explanation is that inactivated vaccine reduced excretion of pharyngeal virus, whilst the level of hygiene in these homes was high enough to limit spread of virus by the faecal oral routes.",

Recent 'Lameness surveys', a technique pioneered by WHO in the Expanded Programme on Immunization (Chapter 2) have changed previous ideas about poliomyelitis in tropical areas. It is now clear that residual paralytic polio in Burma, Egypt, Thailand, Indonesia, Ivory Coast and Brazil, India, Yemen and Niger is higher now than it was during the prevaccine era in the USA and Sweden. The old dogma that in the tropics the infection rate with polio is high but the paralysis rate is low, and that an increased incidence of the paralytic disease was related to emerging epidemics and an improvement in the standard of living reflected in diminishing infant mortality rates, may no longer hold (Sabin, 1982) . Between 50% and 7 5 \" i of lameness in certain developing countries has been found to be caused by poliomyelitis virus. In the absence of immunization programmes some 4 out of 1000 school age children will be disabled by polio. This estimate does not take into account those who have been afflicted and died, and those who have recovered (Tarantola, 1982) . Obviously, on a world scale there is a serious imbalance as regards incidence of polio which requires correction as a high priority. The complete list of reasons for the calamatous differences between countries are not absolutely clear and disagreement exists in the current scientific literature. But, an important reason is the absence of a modern medical and social infrastructure in certain developing countries.",

            "text": "Even although the scientific debate may and will continue about the merits and drawbacks in underdeveloped countries of inactivated versus attenuated polio vaccines it is, nevertheless, clear from the studies of Sabin and others that a vigorous and concerted rapid immunization campaign (Sabin, 1982) using oral attenuated polio vaccine will stop polio in tropical and semi-tropical underdeveloped countries. As early as the 1960s Cuba showed the way with annual mass vaccination campaigns on two Sundays of the year for all children under five years of age regardless of the number of doses they might have had previously. Only such annual mass vaccinations make it possible to reach the extremely high proportions of children necessary to break the chain of infection. When vaccination is more spread out in time, wild polio and other enteroviruses remain dominant in the community. As another example, Brazil in 1980 and 1981, organized an army of volunteers to vaccinate almost all children ( 1 8 million) under 5 years of age twice a year on a single day (June and August in 1980 and August and October in 1981). A precipitous drop in reported cases followed (Sabin, 1982) . An alternative option is to use more doses of vaccine. John (1976) found that multiple doses of conventional oral vaccine containing lo5 and 105-5 TCIDSo for types I , 2 and 3 (five or more doses) were required to give more than 90'x seroconversion. but such an approach requires good organization and mass campaigns. Fang-chou et al. (1982) have described how polio has been controlled recently in sub-tropical areas in China using oral attenuated vaccine. In Guangxi autonomous region, with a population of 20 million persons, apparently healthy children were found to be heavily infected with non-polio enteroviruses. Even as late as 1971 several polio epidemics were detected since the polio vaccination rates were still low, especially in rural areas. An intensive campaign was initiated in 1973 using 'barefoot doctors' and special immunization teams in rural areas and the incidence of polio has since declined from 0.41 (1973) to 0.05 (1977) and 0.02 (1979) per I00000 persons. Fang-chou et al. (1982) conclude \"the key to elimination of paralytic poliomyelitis from a community is to have a powerful leadership and authority in public health that can provide effective administrational guidance, and measures to train and organize health personnel.\"",

In an early study Beale (1969) showed that vaccine given at 3, 4 and 5 months with a booster at one year gave a high seroconversion rate. The polio was mixed with diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine, thus protecting against 4 diseases in one immunization course. Immunization in Mali or Indonesia with 40 D units of currently used polio vaccine can result in essentially 100% seroconversion and it is probable that a single such dose at 6 months will provide immunological memory; subsequent contact with natural virus would boost immunity (reviewed by Beale, 1982 and see also Table 4 .21). Krishnan et al. (1983) evaluated the immunogenic efficacy of inactivated polio vaccine in India in infants given a quadruple vaccine incorporating polio with diptheria-pertussis-tetanus. A total of 150 babies aged 6-45 weeks were immunized with three doses of vaccine containing 20, 2 and 3.5 D antigen units of polio types 1, 2 and 3 respectively at intervals of 4-8 weeks and the overall sero-conversion rates to poliovirus types I , 2 and 3 were 99%, 89% and 91 % respectively. An otherwise adverse effect of maternal antibody on the immune response is reduced by increasing the intervals between doses from 4 to 8 weeks.",

Therefore the attack rate of paralytic polio has declined from a high of 13.7 cases per 100000 population (1952) to 0.003 cases per 100 000 population in 1981. Of these 203 cases, 40 were associated with epidemics, 127 were endemic, 22 were imported and 14 were in immune deficient persons. Of particular interest is the group of 86 vaccine-associated cases which were examined: 26 had occurred in recipients of oral polio vaccine, while 45 occurred in household contacts of vaccinees and 15 in non-household contacts. Perhaps, as to be expected, there was no seasonal distribution of cases and most (99 cases) were under 5 years of age. Compared to the 1960s more adult cases were being observed. Analysis of polio virus isolates by oligonucleotide mapping showed that most isolates from vaccine cases were vaccine-like in oligonucleotide spot pattern (see Chapter 17 for more details).",

The essential data is summarized in Table 4 .23 and 4.24. The sequences were chosen after a hydrophilicity analysis of protein sequence and a sequence variation analysis obtained by comparing the amino acid sequence of VPI of the three polio serotypes. It was assumed that hydrophilic regions of VPI were more likely to be exposed at the virus surface. Four of the five peptides were recognized by neutralizing monoclonal antibodies raised to the intact type I poliovirus. A single peptide (No. 3) elicited virus neutralizing antibodies when coupled to a carrier protein. Finally, the peptides were able to prime animals who subsequently reacted rapidly when immunized with whole polio virus. The priming was specific in the sense that priming only occurred for the homologous type I virus. It is just possible that priming alone might give sufficient protection against poliovirus infection.

The principal site of guanidine action appears to be the synthesis of viral RNA and more than one step may be affected (reviewed by Tershak et al., 1982, Caliguiri and Tamm, 1968) . Polio RNA polymerase is not inhibited in vitro, presumably because initiation of viral RNA synthesis does not occur in cell free extracts but only results in completion of RNA chains in the process of synthesis during extraction of the crude enzyme (all hough more recently pure preparations of picornavirus polymerase that utilize exogenous viral RNA have been obtained and could now be tested). Inititation of synthesis of viral RNA seems to be depressed by guanidine, and release of completed RNA chains is restricted. Current data would point to the initiation step of viral RNA synthesis as the site of action of guanidine (Tershak et al., 1982) . In addition, guanidine exerts mild conformational changes in viral proteins and specifity could be due to a specific amino acid sequence in picornaviruses compared to cell proteins or proteins of other viruses. It is possible that synthesis and encapsidation of viral RNA both require capsid subunits and Vpg, and any interaction with guanidine would cause multiple aberrations.",

Oral medication with arildone solubilized in corn oil was similarly effective in preventing poliovirus-induced paralysis and death. Arildone was therapeutically effective even when intraperitoneal medication was delayed for 48 h postinfection. Analysis of the virus titres in the central nervous system tissues of animals infected with 200 50% lethal doses demonstrated that arildone reduced titres in the brain and spine by approximately 3 and 4 log,,PFU per g of tissue, respectively, implying that direct inhibition of virus replication was responsible for host survival. However, this animal model depends on direct inoculation of polio into the CNS and therefore the relevance of the study to human polio must await further study. It should be noted that the acute oral LDSo of arildone in mice is in excess of 8 g/kg and monkeys and rats medicated daily for 5 weeks with 1000 mg/kg showed no toxic reactions.",

In addition, they cause exacerbation of chronic conditions such as asthma, chronic bronchitis or cardiac failure (reviewed by Andrewes, 1962 , Hope-Simpson, 1958 . We have mentioned above that, at present, few cross-reacting antigenic determinants have been detected among this group of 150 viruses and hence development of effective vaccines would be difficult. Since the viruses are all closely related as regards physico-chemical properties and presumably biochemistry receptor sites etc., it would appear more logical to place an emphasis on development of antiviral drugs or interferon. Most pharmaceutical groups searching for new antivirals include typical rhinoviruses in their antiviral screening programme and most of the latter work is done in tissue culture systems because of the absence of an animal model of human rhinoviruses. Suitable compounds are tested in volunteers for pharmacological properties and any nontoxic compounds are then tested at, for example, the Common Cold Research Unit at Harvard Hospital,'Shlisbury, or in comparable units in Leningrad and Houston. Volunteers in the UK unit are aged from 18-50 years and on arrival at the unit are given a medical examination and a preliminary serum sample is taken and subsequently used to estimate the level of any anti-virus antibody (Beare and Reed, 1977) . During the experimental period volunteers are isolated in pairs in their own self-contained apartments and no physical contact is allowed with other persons ( Fig. 4.9) . Subjective symptoms and objective criteria are used to grade reactions induced by experimental viruses ranging from very mild (trivial reactions), mild (local symptoms), moderate (both local and constitutional symptoms) and severe (febrile and other unpleasant reactions necessitating bed rest). The number of paper handkerchiefs used each day is counted and may often increase from a baseline of 3 per day to 35 per day during the symptoms of a cold. After 3 days quarantine, antiviral medication is started and the volunteers are then infected with rhinovirus intranasally (Fig. 4.10) . Nasal washings are taken for several days thereafter for virus reisolation studies. Drugs may be administered locally by spray or orally. In the latter case there must be evidence that enough compound reaches the secretions of the upper respiratory tract. On the other hand, mucociliary clearance mechanisms are efficient and may rapidly reduce the local concentration of a nasally administered drug. Reed (1980) has summarized earlier trials in volunteers with both specific antivirals and interferon (Tables 4.31 and 4.32) (see also Chapter 3). In general, guanidinetype molecules have given disappointing results in volunteers but more recently a benzimidazole has been shown to have mild antiviral effects (enviroxime or 2amino-I -(isopropyl sulphonyl)-6-benzimidazole phenyl ketone oxime (Table 4 .33, Fig. 4.1 I) . The compound completely suppressed plaque formation in vitro by rhinoviruses types 3, 9, 14 and 31 (Table 4 .33). Moreover, enviroxime inhibited a fur- Fig. 4.9 .

Enviroxime was equally effective in human embryo fibroblasts and HeLa cells and also in human embryo nasal trachea organ culture at concentrations of 0.2 pg/ml. In clinical trials (Table 4 .34) both intranasal and oral administration of the compound was used. and the severity of colds was reduced (Fig. 4.12) although at the borderline of statistical significance. We should remember also that volunteers were given a minimum virus challenge in the presence of a maximum (near toxic) level of drug. Even under these conditions the antiviral effect was not striking, but it nevertheless represents the first synthesized antiviral coumpound to have detectable anti-rhinovirus effects in man.",

However, administration of intranasal enviroxime (one spray per nostril, five times per day) to susceptible volunteers, beginning 1 day before and continuing for 4 days after virus exposure, did not significantly reduce infection or illness due to experimentally induced rhinovirus type 39 infection. The combined results of two separate trials yielded an infection rate of IOOo,, for 21 pla- cebo-treated and 89% for I9 enviroxime-treated subjects. Approximately one-half of the volunteers in each group had seroconversion to the challenge virus. Overall, 52% of the placebo-treated and 53% of the enviroxime-treated subjects developed colds. No significant differences in symptom scores, nasal mucus weights, or numbers of nasal tissues used were observed between the two groups. Two-thirds of the enviroxime-treated volunteers noted intranasal irritation immediately after sprays, as compared with only one-third of the placebo-treated subjects.",

It selectively inhibited the replication of human picornaviruses, such as rhinoviruses and Coxsackie viruses in tissue culture (Table 4. (Table 4 .41). The critical time for the inhibition of rhinovirus replication by the compound was 2 to 4 h after virus adsorption, i.e., in the early stages of virus replication. It markedly inhibited coxsackie virus and rhinovirus RNA synthesis in infected HeLa cells, but not in a cell-free system using the RNA polymerase complex isolated from the infected cells. In the infected cells, the RNA polymerase complex was not formed in the presence of the drug and therefore, it was suggested that Ro 09-0179 interferes with some process of viral replication which occurs between viral uncoating and the initiation of viral RNA synthesis.",

Ro 09-0410 had a high activity against rhinoviruses but no activity against other picornaviruses. Of 53 rhinovirus serotypes tested, 46 were susceptible to the compound in HeLa cell cultures. The concentration of Ro 09-0410 inhibiting 50% of the types of rhinovirus was about 0.03 pglml, whereas the 50% cytotoxic concentration was 30 pglml. Ro 09-0410 inactivated rhinoviruses in direct dose-, time-, and temperature-dependent fashion. We can conclude that the inactivation may be associated with the binding of the agent to some specific site of the rhinovirus capsid. Finally, we end up near the beginning of attempts at chemotherapy with rhinoviruses, namely with interferon. Merigan et al. (1973) showed that 14 x lo6 units (50 pg approximately) of partially purified human leukocyte interferon could protect volunteers against infection with rhinovirus type 4. At the time this experiment used up a great proportion of the total world supply of interferon and the pretreatment and treatment was prolonged! This classic experiment has now been repeated but \"Groups of three mice were infected intraperitoneally with about 10 LD500f coxsackievirus B1 and were treated orally four times with Ro 09-0298 at 1, 2, 5, and 19h after infection using highly purified and ten-fold more interferon, and using rhinovirus type 9 (Scott et al., 1982) . The data is summarized in Table 4 .42. Symptoms were markedly reduced but virus infection and seroconversion were not prevented and it was possible that interferon only dehyed the onset of the cold. There is still a long way to go before the common cold is vanquished!",

            "text": "This infection caused by enterovirus 70 now has a unique position in virology as one of the two human viruses which are pandemic in their epidemiology (with influenza still heading the 'record' as the classic example). The virus infection was first described by Chatterjee et al. (1970) in Ghana as a disease with an incubation period as short as 24 h and was called Apollo 11 disease in the locality because the outbreak coincided with the time of Apollo I 1 landings on the moon. Within 3 years outbreaks had occurred in Japan (Kono, 1975 ) and a new picornavirus was isolated from the conjunctival scrapings. Enterovirus 70 has now spread almost around the world. (Hierholzer et al., 1975 , Likar et al., 1975 , Mirkovic et al., 1973 . Although Apollo 11 disease is most usually rather benign with complete recovery within 2 weeks, some neurological complications have nevertheless been described affecting about 1 in 10 000 cases. Most of the paralysed cases are men and typically the neurological phase begins 2-3 weeks after the onset of conjunctivitis with an acute hypotonic asymmetrical proximal paralysis of the lower limbs with fever, malaise and nerve root pains. Cranial nerve paralysis is often noted. Paralysis may be permanent in up to 50% of those affected and hence in the near future the virus may be an important candidate for vaccine development or chemoprophylaxis. Epidemics have reached enormous proportions (Table 4 .43) with over a million cases, for example, in Calcutta in 1971. The disease is most frequently seen in young adults and is not common in children, although serological evidence shows that infection occurs no less frequently in children (Table 4 .44). Under conditions of poor hygiene and overcrowding rapid and extensive spread can occur. Enterovirus 70 is seldom found in the faeces of patients. The viruses are rather fastidious from a cultivation point of view but may be isolated in human diploid fibroblasts and organ cultures of human embryonic conjunctiva. They are not pathogenic for suckling mice. Sensitive kinetic neutralization tests have shown that serological differences occur among isolates of enterovirus 70 (Higgins, 1982) .",
