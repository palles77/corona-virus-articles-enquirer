When transmission-based PPE ensembles are not appropriate, HCP must recognize the transmission pathway of the disease and anticipate the exposures to select PPE. Because guidance for this process is extremely limited, we proposed a systematic, risk-based approach to the selection and evaluation of PPE ensembles to protect HCP against infectious diseases. Methods: The approach used in this study included the following 4 steps: (1) job hazard analysis, (2) infectious disease hazard analysis, (3) selection of PPE, and (4) evaluation of selected PPE. Selected PPE should protect HCP from exposure, be usable by HCP, and fit for purpose. Results: The approach was demonstrated for the activity of intubation of a patient with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus. As expected, the approach led to the selection of different ensembles of PPE for these 2 pathogens. Discussion: A systematic risk-based approach to the selection of PPE will help health care facilities and HCP select PPE when transmission-based precautions are not appropriate. Owing to the complexity of PPE ensemble selection and evaluation, a team with expertise in infectious diseases, occupational health, the health care activity, and related disciplines, such as human factors, should be engaged. Conclusions: Participation, documentation, and transparency are necessary to ensure the decisions can be communicated, critiqued, and understood by HCP.",

JHA should involve the workers who perform the activity because they have experience with how the work activity is performed, and their participation can increase their personal hazard awareness and concurrence with the outcome. 9 Human factors engineers are trained to disaggregate work activities into discrete tasks and motions and should be included if possible. 7 Related paradigims, such as failure mode and effect analysis, which focus on opportunities for deviation from standard work practices, may also be helpful.",

The airborne, contract, and droplet transmission routes combine concepts of the exposure pathway and exposure route. We suggest it may be more helpful in the selection of PPE to focus on the exposure surface where the pathogen enters a susceptible host to initiate infection. 10 The exposure surface may be internal (eg, the respiratory tract) or external (eg, exposed mucous membrane surface). However, PPE should prevent the pathogen from reaching the exposure surface, regardless of the source, pathway through the environment, or exposure route.",

This is indicated by recommendations that call for an N95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) or a powered air-purifying respirator (PAPR), with a loose-fitting hood for use with the same infectious disease in the same setting.

These devices are also loose fitting and easy for HCP to by-pass. Respirators protect HCP from inhaling aerosols and from projected droplets. Tight-fitting respirators and respirators with loose-fitting hoods can limit self-contact by HCP. Elastomeric full-facepiece respirators and respirators with loose-fitting hoods offer better respiratory protection and more facial coverage against splash than FFRs. Given the severity of SARS-CoV infection, the higher level of protection afforded by a PAPR with a loose-fitting hood may be warranted. The JHA also indicated that contamination of the torso, arms, and hands is likely. Body and hand coverings should be used because, although SARS-CoV does not infect through the dermis, contaminated clothing and skin may serve as an environmental reservoir. Given the relatively short duration and limited fluid volume produced during intubation of SARS patients, fluidimpermeable gowns may not be required, particularly if HCP are able to rapidly doff soiled body coverings and perform hand hygiene. The exposure surface for MRSA is the dermis and the nares. Although infection typically requires a wound, colonization can occur at many locations on the body (Table 3 ). During intubation HCPs may be exposed to respiratory secretions and vomitus, which are unlikely to contain MRSA unless the patient is colonized in the nares or throat, or has an active MRSA pneumonia. Aerosols formed during intubation may be inhaled by an HCP into the nares, or transferred to the nares during self-contact with hands contaminated during the procedure; the torso and arms may be contaminated with respiratory secretions ( Table 2 ). Unless the HCP has an open wound or indwelling device, there is low risk of developing infection from exposures associated with intubation. PPE is necessary to prevent contamination of HCP clothing and skin, which could serve as an environmental reservoir for future transmission. Colonization of HCP rarely leads to overt symptoms; however, protection of the nares with a mask or respirator could decrease the risk of colonization or further transmission. Selection of PPE for intubation of a MRSA patient, however, should consider the likelihood of undiagnosed colonization or infection by another microorganism.",

This issue was apparent in the changing guidelines for PPE during the 2014-2015 EVD. 5 The risk-based approach we propose in this study enables transparent decisionmaking, even in the face of uncertainty or disagreement, because each step of the approach can be documented, allowing review (and critique) by others.",

Product evaluation tests typically involve only components of the PPE (eg, the penetration of fluid through the textile, not the seams in the garment or performance in the field), 18, 19 and federal agency representiatives and others have been called on to test the permeability of textiles to specific infectious agents. 37 Although there is room to improve the realism of this type of product testing, it is equally important to evaluate how PPE ensembles perform in the field, where human behavior and individual pieces of PPE influence protection. The 2014-2015 EVD outbreak motivated substantial research about the potential for self-contamination associated with doffing complex PPE ensembles, 26 and more work about ensemble performance during care activities. Hall et al 38 evaluated 5 PPE ensembles intended for use with suspected EVD patients, using a complex health care activity simulation with fluorescent simulated body fluids, and found contamination under the PPE and other flaws with all ensembles tested. Herlihey et al 14 evaluated 7 PPE ensembles designed for use with highly infectious diseases, using a human factors lens, and found problems with protection, comfort, and function of all ensembles testing during simulated care activities or doffing. This research highlights that existing pieces of PPE are imperfect and should be evaluated for performance before implementation. Although sophisticated, formal research methods can be used, a lot of information can be gained with fewer resources. For example, in the Chicago area, HCP used visual inspection and colored liquids (eg, Kool-Aid [The Kraft-Heinz Co]) to evaluate dermal coverage and fluid impermeability of PPE, respectively, to increase confidence in PPE selection decisions during EVD preparations. 5 Implementation of a systematic risk-based process for selection of a PPE ensemble to protect HCP from infectious diseases benefits from a team with expertise in occupational health, infectious diseases, human factors, and health care activities. The questions in Table 1 are intended to help ensure that PPE ensembles are evaluated holistically, but may not be complete. Ensemble selection and evaluation should be iterative, changing as new knowledge and perspectives are acquired through discussion and evaluation, and it is unlikely that there is a single best answer for every health care activity or health care setting. Therefore, it is important that the rationale used to select PPE ensembles be documented and transparent. Although the focus of this work has been on occupational health, we recognize that protection of patients is another important function for PPE that should be considered in PPE selection and evaluation.",

            "text": "Questions to consider in evaluation of PPE ensembles to protect health care workers from infectious diseases Question Rationale Donning, doffing, and changing 1. How long does it take to don the PPE ensemble? Doffing duration affects the response time, which can affect the usability of the ensemble in an emergency scenario. 29 2. How long does it take to doff the PPE ensemble? In the event of gross contamination, PPE failure, or high anxiety, HCP should be able to doff the PPE and remove themselves to a safe environment for rapid evaluation of risk or disinfection. Doffing speed is not a priority in all care scenarios. 3. How easy is it to don the PPE correctly? PPE should be easy to don correctly, difficult to don incorrectly, and/or should have a clear indicator of incorrect donning so as to minimize risk of PPE failure. 4. Can pieces of PPE be removed or changed without contaminating the wearer or other pieces of PPE in the ensemble?",

            "text": "Can the wearer move in the PPE ensemble? PPE should be designed to allow for full range of motion. 3. Does the PPE allow for necessary dexterity and tactility? Although dexterity and tactility are most closely associated with hands, it is more broadly relevant as health care requires HCP to use all parts of their bodies. 4. Does the PPE ensemble allow for unobstructed vision? Eye, face, and/or head coverings should not distort or limit the field of view. 5. Does the PPE ensemble allow for the use of corrective eyewear? Many HCP wear corrective eyewear (eye glasses) that must fit under or adjacent to pieces of PPE. 6. Can the wearer hear people and equipment while wearing the PPE ensemble? HCP need to be able to hear the patient, other HCP, and equipment during care activities. Some pieces of PPE, such as PAPRs, make noise that can impact hearing. 7. Can people understand verbal communication from the wearer of the PPE ensemble? HCP need to be understood by the patient and other HCP. Sounds made by the HCP need to penetrate the PPE ensemble. 8. Can the wearer breathe comfortably while wearing the PPE? Resistance to breathing can cause discomfort and anxiety. 9. How long can the PPE ensemble be worn without the wearer experiencing physiological or psychological stress? HCP must be able to wear the PPE ensemble for a longer period of time than the care activity requires. Physiological and psychological stress is known to occur with PPE, 30 and should be evaluated as part of ensemble testing. 10. How long do the pieces of PPE and the PPE ensemble maintain their integrity and functionality during use? PPE should not tear, move on the body, or degrade during the planned duration of use. Frequent complaints in this regard including fogging of goggles and moistening of N95 FFRs. 14 11. Does the PPE ensemble prevent by-pass by the wearer? It should be difficult or impossible for HCP to reach under or around the PPE, such as to shift the respirator to scratch her/his face. 12. Is the PPE disposable? PPE that is not disposable requires a plan for cleaning and disinfection. Disposable PPE requires a plan for waste management, and a robust supply. Fit for purpose 1. Is the PPE sterile? Some contexts require the use of sterile pieces of PPE. 2. Does the PPE ensemble have junctions between pieces of PPE through which pathogens may penetrate?There may be gaps between pieces of PPE that may need to be closed through the use of tape or adjustments. Consider, is there an alternative piece of PPE that would eliminate that junction? Critical junctions may occur at the wrist, forehead, or neck, for example. 14,31 3. Does the PPE ensemble block the anticipated disease transmission pathway?Revisit the hazard analysis to ensure that the PPE ensemble covers the necessary body parts\u2212the exposure surfaces, otherwise effectiveness will be reduced. 4. Does the PPE offer the necessary level of protection? Some pieces of PPE allow penetration of some fraction of pathogens by design, others may fail, resulting in exposure. High hazard infectious diseases should lead to the selection of PPE with low penetration and low likelihood of failure.HCP, health care personnel; PAPRs, powered air-purifying respirators; PPE, personal protective equipment.",
