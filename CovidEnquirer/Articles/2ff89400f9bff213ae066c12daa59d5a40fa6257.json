            "text": "OBJECTIVES: Herpes zoster has been widely described in the context of different systemic autoimmune diseases but not dermatomyositis/polymyositis. Therefore, we analyzed the prevalence, risk factors and herpes zoster outcomes in this population. METHOD: A retrospective cohort study of herpes zoster infections in dermatomyositis/polymyositis patients was performed. The patients were followed at a tertiary center from 1991 to 2012. For the control group, each patient with herpes zoster was paired with two patients without herpes zoster. Patients were matched by gender and the type of myositis, age at myositis onset and disease duration. RESULTS: Of 230 patients, 24 (10.4%) had a histories of herpes zoster (19 with dermatomyositis and five with polymyositis, two-thirds female). The mean age of the patients with herpes zoster was 44.6\u00a116.8 years. No difference between the groups was found regarding cumulative clinical manifestations. Disease activity, autoantibody, muscle and leukogram parameters were also comparable between the groups. No differences in immunosuppressive (alone or in association with other immunosuppressive therapies) or glucocorticoid (current use, medium dose and cumulative dose in the last two months) therapies were found between patients with and without herpes zoster. However, a higher proportion of patients in the herpes zoster group received chloroquine diphosphate compared to the control group. All of the patients received acyclovir; 58.3% of patients had postherpetic neuralgia and no cases of recurrence were reported. Furthermore, individuals who were taking high prednisone doses at the time of the herpes zoster diagnosis had reduced levels of postherpetic neuralgia. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that chloroquine diphosphate could predispose patients with dermatomyositis/polymyositis to developing herpes zoster, particularly women and dermatomyositis patients.",

Six patients had simultaneous involvement of two dermatomes, while no cases of HZ recurrence were reported. Postherpetic neuralgia can result in severe pain such that patients are often unable to wear clothing that comes in contact with the lesions or be exposed to wind because of high skin sensitivity in regions such as the thorax and face. The incidence of postherpetic neuralgia rises from 10% among individuals of all ages to as high as 40% among those aged 50 years and older (40) . A large prospective study identified four independent predictors of postherpetic neuralgia: older age, severe, acute pain, severe rash and a shorter duration of rash before consultation (41) . Although controversial, shortterm use of corticosteroids can reduce the pain severity and improve patient quality of life in the acute phase (42) . Note that high prednisone doses at the time of HZ diagnosis were found to decrease the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia in our patients.",
