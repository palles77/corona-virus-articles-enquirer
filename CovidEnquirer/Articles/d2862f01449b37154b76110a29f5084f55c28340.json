Data was collated on breed, sex, age, number of cats at original location, outdoor access, health status, and time spent in the shelter prior to sampling (range 0 to 4 years). Some cats were also tested for feline leukaemia virus antigen, feline immunodeficiency virus, and Toxoplasma gondii antibodies. The effect of these variables on FCoV seropositivity was explored by multivariable logistic regression. FCoV seropositivity in cats that had spent 5 days or less in a shelter at sampling was significantly associated with a multi-cat origin, cats aged 3 years or less, and Persian breed. Whether pet, stray or feral, health status, indoor/outdoor access, and sex had no significant effect. Overall FCoV seropositivity was associated with time spent in a shelter but this association was not linear. Cats that had spent more than 60 days in a shelter were over five times as likely to be seropositive. This may be the result of a change in husbandry from solitary to communal housing for cats remaining in shelters long term. Rescue of cats for less than 60 days was not associated with a significant increasing risk of seropositivity. Significant variation existed in seropositivity between individual shelters overall and in cats rescued for less than 5 days. These findings may reflect inter-shelter variation in cat husbandry and variation in seropositivity of shelter intake respectively.",

This finding is Outdoor access could also be expected to affect FCoV seropositivity. In this population it did not. Outside access allows cats to bury faeces often in distinct territories and so minimise faecal oral contact and FCoV transmission. However, outdoor access does not mean cats will not make use of communal litter trays; 50% (50/101) of UK pet cats from multi-cat households with outdoor access still make use of communal litter trays (Cave, unpublished data). Even when cats exclusively bury faeces outdoors, urban environments with high cat population densities may lead to communal use of soiling areas such as gardens.",

Analysis of the data from cats that had spent 5 days or less in a shelter did reveal a significant association between pedigree breed and FCoV seropositivity. The majority of pedigree cats were Persians and modelling for Persian breed instead of pedigree breed improved model fit. The effect of breed would not be expected to alter with time spent in shelter. However, analysis of the entire dataset did not reveal any association with breed. The inconsistency of this association suggests that it may be the result of very small numbers of pedigree cats in the dataset. Most cats relinquished to rescue shelters are domestics.

In the current study cats were only sampled once making demonstration of seroconversion impossible; FCoV seropositivity thus reflects past exposure. Therefore documentation of increasing seropositivity in the population with increasing time spent in the shelter cannot be assumed to represent seroconversion following exposure to the shelter environment. It could also represent a trend for FCoV seropositive cats to remain in the shelter for longer. Increasing time spent in a shelter was associated with increased risk of FCoV seropositivity but this association was not linear.

A second possibility is that seropositivity may be associated with a reason for shelter staff to retain a cat for longer before re-homing, for example because FCoV infection had induced diarrhoea. However, this population had not been previously tested for anti-FCoV antibodies, so we cannot know when seroconversion occurred. Acute FCoV infection is usually asymptomatic or associated with only mild diarrhoea or upper respiratory signs, and in this study, FCoV seropositive cats were not more likely to be sick at the time of sampling. There was no significant association between FCoV infection and serological results for other infectious diseases. Finally another risk factor for seropositivity may change with increasing time in shelters. When cats enter shelters it is recommended that they be kept isolated from other cats. However, if they remain in a shelter for a prolonged period such as 60 days they are likely to be transferred to group housing and so would transfer to a multi-cat environment which would probably include cats with which they had not previously been in contact. As already demonstrated multi-cat environments are associated with transmission of FCoV. In our opinion this is the most likely explanation for the association of FCoV seropositivity with time spent in a shelter of more than 60 days. A further study following a cohort of cats from the time of shelter entry would be required to ascertain these findings. The reasons for prolonged retention in the shelter and the timing of movement to group housing would also need to be documented.",

Shelters E and I both become associated with greater seropositivity than shelter A. The remaining shelters do not differ significantly from shelter A.
