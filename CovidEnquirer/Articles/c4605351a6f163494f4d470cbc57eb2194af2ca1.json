The present study aimed to assess the safety of S DEL5/ORF3 and to evaluate its effectiveness as a live vaccine for prime-booster vaccinations. Reversion to virulence experiments revealed that the S DEL5/ORF3 strain retains its attenuated phenotype and genetic stability after five successive passages in susceptible piglets. Pregnant sows were primed orally with an S DEL5/ORF3 live vaccine and boosted intramuscularly twice with a commercial killed vaccine at 2-week intervals prior to parturition. This sow vaccination regimen completely protected nursing piglets against virulent G2b challenge, as evidenced by the increase in survival rate from 0% to 100% and the significant reduction in diarrhea intensity, including the amount and duration of PEDV fecal shedding. In addition, despite a 2-3 day period of weight loss in piglets from vaccinated sows after challenge, their daily weight gain was recovered at 7 days post-challenge and became similar to that of unchallenged pigs from unvaccinated sows over the course of the experiment. Furthermore, strong antibody responses to PEDV were verified in the sera and colostrum of immunized sows with the prime-boost treatment and their offspring. Altogether, our data demonstrated that the attenuated S DEL5/ORF3 strain guarantees the safety to host animals with no reversion to virulence and is suitable as an effective primary live vaccine providing durable maternal lactogenic immunity for passive piglet protection.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly epizootic and fetal swine disease that causes watery diarrhea, vomiting, severe dehydration, and significant mortality rates in newborn piglets (Lee, 2015 (Lee, , 2019 Saif et al., 2012) . PED virus (PEDV), a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus within the family Coronaviridae of the order Nidovirales, is the causative agent of this disease (Gorbalenya et al., 2006; Lee, 2015) . PEDV is a large, enveloped virus containing a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 28 kb in length with a 5\u2032 cap and a 3\u2032 polyadenylated tail (Kocherhans et al., 2001; Saif et al., 2012) . The PEDV genome is composed of seven canonical genes, including the open reading frame (ORF) 3, flanked by 5\u2032-and 3\u2032-untranslated regions (UTRs) (Kocherhans et al., 2001) . The first two large ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1b, encode replicase polyproteins (pp) 1a and 1ab, which are later proteolytically processed into 16 mature nonstructural proteins (nsp1-16). The remaining genes encode four canonical coronavirus structural proteins, including spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N), and a single accessory gene, ORF3 (Duarte et al., 1994; Lai et al., 2007; Lee, 2015) . PEDV can be phylogenetically divided into two genotypes with two sub-genotypes: genogroup 1 (G1a and G1b; classical and recombinant, respectively, with low pathogenicity) and genogroup 2 (G2a and G2b; field epidemic and pandemic, respectively, with high pathogenicity) (Lee, 2015 (Lee, , 2019 Lee et al., 2010; Oh et al., 2014) .",

However, in early 2013, PED first emerged in the United States (US) and rapidly spread nationwide and to North and South American countries, sustaining tremendous damage to pig health and the pork industry (Mole, 2013; Stevenson et al., 2013; Vlasova et al., 2014) . Subsequently, highly virulent US prototype-like highly virulent G2b PEDV strains almost concurrently struck several Asian nations, including South Korea, Japan, and Taiwan, resulting in the recurrence of massive PED epidemics Lin et al., 2014; Suzuki et al., 2015) . Furthermore, the independent re-emergence of recombinant G1b or pandemic G2b PEDV in multiple countries in western and central Europe since 2014 has been reported (Boniotti et al., 2016; Dastjerdi et al., 2015; Grasland et al., 2015; Hanke et al., 2015; Mesquita et al., 2015; Steinrigl et al., 2015; Theuns et al., 2015) . As a result of these pandemics, PEDV has gained international attention as a porcine coronavirus that represents a considerable financial threat to the global pork business.",

            "text": "PED has been considered one of the most economically serious swine diseases in South Korea since the first epizootic in 1992 (Kweon et al., 1993) . Although all four sub-genotypes of PEDV have been reported in South Korea, the current dominant epidemic strains are mostly of the G2b sub-genotype, with frequent moderate-scale regional outbreaks occurring across the nation since the 2013-2014 PED reemergence (Lee, 2015; , 2018 . Due to incomplete cross-protection between two genetic clusters, classical G1a PEDV vaccines have failed to defend against recent virulent strains, and thus new G2b-based vaccines have been developed and commercialized in South Korea. However, only inactivated/killed vaccines against G2b PEDV, which may be incapable of effectively controlling chronic PEDV enzootics, are commercially available in the domestic market. In our previous study, the double-dose immunization of pregnant sows with inactivated G2b vaccines conferred important passive protection to their litters (Baek et al., 2016) . However, this study pointed out potential drawbacks of killed vaccines against PED in their effectiveness that does not fully mitigate mortality and morbidity rates of nursing piglets, probably owing to scant lactogenic immunity. Furthermore, since it is acknowledged that the vaccine administration route is one of the critical factors in stimulating optimum mucosal immunity in sows, the effects of parenteral vaccination with inactivated vaccines in PEDV-na\u00efve sows on immune responses and preweaning mortality may be limited (Crawford et al., 2016; Langel et al., 2016; Schwartz et al., 2016) . It has also been found that the oral administration of live attenuated vaccines can induce a sufficient lactogenic immune response against PEDV in na\u00efve pigs and is thus most effective for PEDV-na\u00efve sows (Chattha et al., 2015; Langel et al., 2016) . Considering these issues, there is an urgent demand for the invention of a next-generation modified live virus (MLV) vaccine that can replicate in the gut and provide the stimulation required to induce protective mucosal immunity without leading to clinical disease.",

Briefly, four animals were assigned to each reversion to virulence experiment, except for the final passage, which included eight piglets. The animals were fed commercial milk replacer 3-4 times daily and had ad libitum access to water for the duration of the study. Following a 2-day acclimation period, a group of four piglets (now 5 days old) initially received an oral 1-ml dose of 10 6 \u00b7 5 TCID 50 /ml S DEL5/ORF3 .

Pigs were divided randomly into three experimental groups: vaccinated group 1 (n = 3; S1, S2, and S3), challenge control group 2 (n = 2; S4 and S5), and strict negative control group 3 (n = 1; S6). A live prime-killed/ killed boost (L/K/K) multiple-dose PED vaccination schedule at 2-week intervals starting prior to farrowing was applied. The three sows in group 1 were orally administered once with 2 ml of a live vaccine and were then intramuscularly (IM) boosted twice with a commercial inactivated G2b PEDV vaccine (ISU46065IA13 strain, PED-X \u00ae , CAVAC) at 6, 4, and 2 weeks pre-partum, respectively. The remaining sows in groups 2 and 3 were unvaccinated and served as controls. Stool samples were collected at days 0, 3, 5, 7, and 14 after oral primary immunization with the live vaccine and analyzed with real-time RT-PCR to detect viral shedding and used as an inoculum for the challenge experiment using PEDV-na\u00efve piglets. All sows were monitored daily for clinical changes and adverse effects following vaccination. To mimic the field conditions for nursing piglets, all sows were allowed to farrow naturally and nurse their piglets freely for the duration of the study. After removing the atrophic and weak newborn piglets from each litter at farrowing, 10 healthy piglets per sow were allocated to each group. Ten 3-day-old suckling piglets per litter (a total of 50 newborn piglets) in groups 1 and 2 were challenged orally with a 1-ml dose of 10 2.7 TCID 50 / ml KNU-141112-P5 virus, which was equivalent to a 100 median pig diarrhea dose (PDD 50 ) Liu et al., 2015) . The shaminoculated piglets from group 3 were administered with cell culture media as a placebo. Animals were monitored daily for clinical signs of vomiting, diarrhea, and mortality throughout the study. Fecal specimens from all groups were collected and examined for PEDV shedding as described above. A clinical significance score (CSS) for diarrheal severity was determined using the following scoring criteria based on a visual examination for 21 days post-challenge (dpc): 0 = normal and no diarrhea (mean cycle threshold [Ct] values of > 45); 1 = mild and fluidic feces; 2 = moderate watery diarrhea; 3 = severe watery and projectile diarrhea (mean Ct values of < 20); 4 = death. Blood samples were collected from sows before (during each vaccination), at, and after farrowing (up to 4 weeks) and also from 5 representative piglets per litter from each dam at 0, 7, 14, and 21 dpc. Colostrum was collected on the day of farrowing, and the piglets were weighed daily until the end of the experiment. Piglets that died after challenge during the study were necropsied upon their death, while the surviving pigs were euthanized at 21 dpc for post-mortem examination, except for six piglets from each of groups 1 and 3, which were kept alive for an additional four weeks and weighed daily to measure their average postweaning daily weight gain.",

Briefly, microtiter plates (Nunc, Naperville, IL) were coated with 1.6 ng per well of the S1 antigen diluted in coating buffer (50 mM bicarbonate buffer, pH 9.6) and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C.

After washing, a 1:20000 diluted peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-porcine IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or IgA (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was added and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. The peroxidase reaction was visualized using tetramethylbenzidine-hydrogen peroxide as the substrate (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) for 20 min at RT in the dark and was stopped by adding 2 N sulfuric acid as the stop solution (R&D Systems) to each well. Optical densities (ODs) were measured at 450 nm using a SPARK 10 M multimode microplate reader (TECAN, M\u00e4nnedorf, Switzerland).

Similar levels of PEDV fecal shedding were also recorded for the piglets in all four subsequent passage groups (P2-P5), and the kinetics for the mean titer values in groups P2-P5 were comparable to those from the piglets in P1. Interestingly, the quantities of virus in the feces from four piglets in the fifth-passage group (P5), which were euthanized at 21 dpi, were lower at 7 dpi, with a mean titer of 10 0.83 genomic copies/ml; thereafter, their feces were negative for the presence of PEDV until the termination of the study (Fig. 1) .

There were no significant differences in the intestinal PEDV quantities between the five groups. Under macroscopic examination, it was observed that entire animals in all passage groups (P1-P5) had no gross lesions in their gastrointestinal tracts and a normal bowel wall thickness ( Fig. 2A-E) . Although mild histopathology was evident in some cases, the microscopic lesions in the small intestine of the inoculated pigs appeared normal (Fig. 2F-J) . There were no significant differences in the mean ( \u00b1 SDM) jejunal VH:CD ratios between the inoculated nursing piglets in the different passage groups: 5.3 \u00b1 0.5 in P1, 5.8 \u00b1 0.4 in P2, 6.1 \u00b1 0.5 in P3, 5.8 \u00b1 0.6 in P4, and 5.5 \u00b1 0.9 in P5. These values were slightly lower than the normal VH:CD ratios (7.6 \u00b1 0.2) in uninoculated negative control pigs but were significantly higher than the VH:CD ratios (1.2 \u00b1 0.8) in the positive control pigs inoculated with the parental KNU-141112-P5 strain. Under IHC analysis, no virus antigen was found in the small intestine of any animal in the first two passages (P1 and P2; Figs. 2K-O). On the other hand, PEDV antigenpositive cells were detected in some small intestinal villi from the inoculated pigs in P3-P5, with a similar range of 0-3 per jejunal villus within all three groups. Altogether, the results demonstrated that attenuated S DEL5-ORF3 did not revert to a virulent phenotype after five continuous back passages in susceptible piglets.",

No mutations arose in the S-ORF3-E-M-N protein-coding region in any of the isolates from the passages, while the distinguishing deletion (DEL) signature present in S and ORF3 within the S DEL5/ORF3 strain remained completely unchanged during the reversion to virulence experiment.

PEDV RNA titers in rectal swabs collected at the indicated time points (A) and jejunal tissue collected at 5 dpi for each back passage (B) were determined using quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis. The virus titer (log 10 genomic copies/ml) values represent the mean virus titer from all pigs in each reversion to virulence test and the error bars represent the mean \u00b1 SDM. Statistical significance was assessed using Student\u2032s t-tests. There were no significant differences between the groups. G. Jang, et al. Veterinary Microbiology 231 (2019) 120-128 passage of the experiment was also determined. Compared to the S DEL5/ORF3 genome, the virus isolate (P6) had three amino acid (aa) substitutions that include 2-aa (Ile to Leu and Cys to Phe) and 1-aa (Phe to Leu) changes at positions 1283 and 1287 of nsp3 and position 370 of S, respectively. Additional nsp3 sequencing revealed that I1283 L and C1287 F mutations were independently acquired during P4 and P3, respectively. Details of the mutations of the 5th in vivo-passaged virus are summarized in Table 1 . Our sequence analysis thus proves that S DEL5/ORF3 was genetically stable during serial passages in piglets.",

After challenge, PEDV-exposed piglets from unvaccinated sows (group 2) experienced clinical signs, including lethargy and diarrheic feces, within 1 dpc (mean CSS of > 2.5) and experienced severe watery diarrhea with vomiting thereafter (Fig. 3A) . However, piglets from vaccinated sows (group 1) had mild diarrhea (mean CSS of < 1.0) beginning at 1 or 2 dpc and remained clinically normal after 7 or 8 dpc; they were thus comparable to the unchallenged piglets from the group 3 sow. These results revealed that litters from vaccinated sows developed notably lesser and milder diarrhea after challenge compared to those from unvaccinated sows. PEDV-associated mortality occurred in 5 of the 20 piglets (25%) from unvaccinated sows at 2 dpc, and all of the remaining animals had died by 4 dpc, thus representing a 100% mortality rate for the unvaccinated challenge control group 2 (Fig. 3B ). In contrast, there was a 100% survival rate among the litters from the vaccinated sows (group 1) and the negative control sow (group 3) over the course of the experiment. After challenge, fecal shedding was detected in all piglets from the unvaccinated sows (group 2) by 1 or 2 dpc, and they continuously shed high amounts of PEDV in their feces until death (Fig. 3C) . In contrast, a majority of piglets (26/30) from the vaccinated sows (group 1) had detectable amounts of PEDV RNA in feces by 3-7 dpc with a peak mean titer of 10 1.27 genomic copies/ml at 5 dpc and continued shedding until 14 dpc. As with all of the unchallenged piglets, viral shedding was not detected in the rectal swabs of two challenged piglets from vaccinated sows over the entire experimental period. All dead piglets from the unvaccinated sows displayed archetypal PED-like gross and histopathologic lesions including dilated and fluid filled intestines with thin transparent walls as a result of villous atrophy, whereas all surviving piglets from vaccinated sows appeared normal both macroscopically and microscopically (data not shown).

Thus, individual samples were collected from preand post-partum sows and from neonatal piglets pre-and post-challenge and tested for the presence of anti-PEDV antibodies using SN assays and ELISA. As shown in Fig. 5A , all sows developed anti-PEDV neutralizing antibodies after the initial live prime vaccination, with titers ranging from 128 to 256 and a geometric mean of 213.3. At farrowing after the killed/killed vaccine boosters, the neutralizing antibody titers in the sera increased, ranging from 64 to 512 with a geometric mean of 362.7, while the titers in colostrum were all measured at 1024. All three sows maintained high levels of neutralizing antibody titer (512) for 4 weeks post-farrowing. Furthermore, representative nursing piglets representative from each litter within group 1 had neutralizing antibody levels ranging from 128 to 512 with a geometric mean of 307.2 prior to challenge, which were comparable to the levels of their own dam, and retained these antibodies with a slight reduction at 3 weeks post-challenge, indicating the adequate protective lactogenic immunity had been acquired from the vaccinated sows. These results were further verified by ELISA to determine anti-PEDV IgA antibody levels (Fig. 5B) . The kinetics for the presence of antibodies in the sera and colostrum from vaccinated sows and their offspring were comparable to those of the neutralizing antibody levels in the corresponding samples. In contrast, neither anti-PEDV neutralizing nor IgA antibodies were detected in the serum and colostrum samples collected from the unvaccinated sows and their nursing piglets (groups 2 and 3). Taken together, our data demonstrate that prime/ booster vaccination efficiently elicits potent antibody responses in sows, which are then transferred to their litters via lactation to provide full protection against PEDV.",

In Asian pig-producing countries, including South Korea, G1a PEDV-based vaccines have been extensively used to control PED for decades. However, the advent of a new-genotype PEDV that led to the 2013-2014 pandemic has raised concerns regarding the efficacy of existing vaccines and the calls for a new effective vaccine against Fig. 3 . Clinical significance scores, survival rates, and virus shedding in piglets from three experimental groups. Pregnant sows were primed orally with a live S DEL5/ORF3 vaccine and boosted twice with a commercial G2b PEDV vaccine at 2-week intervals pre-farrowing and their nursing piglets were challenged with virulent G2b PEDV at 3 days of age. (A) Clinical significance scores were measured as described in the Materials and Methods section. (B) Survival rate of piglets from vaccinated (group 1), challenge-control (group 2), and negativecontrol (group 3) sows through 21 dpc. (C) PEDV titers in rectal swab samples at each time point were determined using quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis. The virus titer (log 10 genomic copies/ml) values represent the mean virus titer from all pigs and the error bars represent the mean \u00b1 SDM. P values were calculated by comparing the data from the vaccinated and unvaccinated sow groups after challenge using Student\u2032s t-tests. *, P = 0.001 to 0.05; **, P < 0.001. G. Jang, et al. Veterinary Microbiology 231 (2019) 120-128 emergent epidemic strains, especially given that classical G1a vaccines are not fully protective against contemporary virulent G2b strains in the field. In 2015, the first licensed G2b PEDV vaccine was introduced to the domestic pig market, and currently three inactivated G2b vaccines are commercially available in South Korea for the immunization of sows against PEDV. Despite the certain benefits of these vaccines in preventing acute outbreaks, they often fail in endemic statuses and na\u00efve herds. One reason for the variable vaccine efficacy observed under field conditions may be that parenteral (IM) inactivated vaccines induce a weaker and less persistent lactogenic immunity compared to oral live virus vaccines. Due to the impermeable placenta barrier in swine, piglets are born immunologically immature or agammaglobulinic and are hence readily vulnerable to a wide range of infections. Newborn piglets rely absolutely on colostrum and milk antibodies for maternal lactogenic immunity (Saif and Jackwood, 1990) . Multiple enteric pathogens, including PEDV, require live viruses to migrate to the intestine and replicate to activate the gut-associated mucosal system in order to efficiently stimulate a local immune response that is passively transferred to suckling piglets via colostrum and milk (lactogenic immunity) (Langel et al., 2016) . While natural infection or oral immunization with live virus can generate sufficient mucosal or lactogenic immunity, intramuscular administration is known to induce a systemic immune response that provides little lactogenic immunity to piglets (Chattha et al., 2015; Langel et al., 2016) . Given these points in the design of PEDV vaccine, the development of next-generation live vaccines that can be applied orally is necessary for effective PED control in the swine industry. Recently, we successfully achieved the development of the cell culture-attenuated G2b strain S DEL5/ORF3, which is genetically stable and homologous to global G2b field strains, and immunogenically comparable to the parental virus . In this study, we sought to assess the safety and efficacy of the S DEL5/ ORF3 strain as an MLV vaccine candidate under experimental conditions. When evaluating the phenotypic stability of S DEL5/ORF3 by passaging the virus in highly susceptible 5 day-old piglets, no reversion to virulence was observed. Consistent with our previous research , the present study reproduced similar amounts and durations of PEDV fecal shedding, with the onset by 2 dpi, a peak at 4 dpi, and absence after 7 dpi. These kinetics were analogous among all animals and comparable for each passage. Most piglets from each passage had normal histopathological lesions but only mildly affected intestinal villi, with mean jejunal VH:CD ranges of 5.3-6.1, which are slightly below normal values of > 6 . PEDV antigen-positive cells were evident in piglets from later passages with a maximum of three cells per jejunal villus. Our experimental data indicated that the S Fig. 4 . Mean body weight and average daily weight gain for piglets from the vaccinated (group 1) and negative-control (group 3) sows after challenge through 49 dpc. Error bars represent the mean \u00b1 SDM. Statistical significance was assessed using Student\u2032s t-tests. There were no significant differences between the two groups. Fig. 5 . PEDV-specific antibody responses in serum and colostrum samples of sows and their corresponding litters. Pregnant sows were primed orally with a live vaccine at 6 weeks prior to farrowing and boosted twice with a commercial killed vaccine at 4 and 2 weeks pre-farrowing and their nursing piglets were challenged with virulent G2b PEDV at 3 days of age. The samples were collected at the indicated time points and were tested with virus neutralization assays using KNU-141112 (A) and an in house IgA PEDV ELISA (B). C/S denotes colostrum samples collected at farrowing. Neutralizing antibody titers for individual samples were presented as a log 2 scale. Values are representative of the mean from three independent experiments in duplicate and the error bars denote the mean \u00b1 SDM. DEL5/ORF3 virus replicated in the gut of inoculated piglets, conserving its virologically and clinically attenuated phenotype during the five back passages. Accordingly, except for 3-aa changes (I1281 F and C1285 F in nsp3 and F375 L in S), no substitutions were found at the genome level after sequential back passages in vivo, demonstrating the genetic stability of S DEL5/ORF3. Furthermore, the genetic modifications, including a 5-aa DEL at each N-and C-terminus of S and a 70-aa DEL at the N-terminus of ORF3, that may have contributed to the attenuation to S DEL5/ORF3 were completely unaffected. The conservation of the 5-aa (KVHVQ) DEL of the S DEL5/ORF3 virus also supports a recent study that demonstrated that two intracellular sorting signals (endocytosis and endoplasmic reticulum-retention) in the cytoplasmic tail of the S protein are associated with PEDV virulence (Hou et al., 2019) . It is thus likely that the discontinuous large DELs of S DEL5/ ORF3 are highly secure and hinder reversion to the native sequences of the virulent parental virus.",

            "text": "Piglets from unvaccinated control sows exhibited much higher mean CSS, as determined by diarrhea severity, than those from vaccinated sows. When differences in CSS between the groups were assessed at 2 dpc, the challenged piglets from the vaccinated (group 1) and unvaccinated (group 2) sows exhibited mean CSS values of < 1.0 and > 3.0, respectively. As a result, all piglets in group 2 died within 4 dpc, whereas no piglets in group 1 died over the experimental period. The onset of PEDV fecal shedding in animals from the vaccinated sows was recorded at different times (3-7 dpc), and its termination varied among piglets, lasting up to 2 weeks after challenge. A recent study revealed that giving sows twice inactivated killed G2b vaccines (K/K vaccination) enhanced the survival rate of piglets against G2b challenge from 0% to 93% and relieved the severity and morbidity of diarrhea, including the fecal shedding of PEDV (Baek et al., 2016) . Considering these results, the maternal L/K/K vaccinations applied in the present study were more efficacious than K/K treatment in terms of absolute improvement in survival rate and the significant mitigation of diarrheal severity, including the quantity and duration of viral shedding in stool. Although our L/K/K vaccination of sows still did not completely prevent morbidity in piglets after challenge, the remarkably shorter duration of PEDV fecal shedding and substantially declined titers would alleviate the environmental burden in the farrowing room by effectively eliminating the direct transmission source for the virus. Furthermore, neither adverse effects nor PEDV genetic and infectious materials in feces were found in any pregnant sows orally primed with S DEL5/ ORF3. These data suggest that PEDV fecal transmission after sow immunization with the oral live vaccine is not possible under experimental conditions. None of the challenged piglets from vaccinated sows experienced body weight loss, and their ADGs returned to standard after a week post-challenge, indicating the favorable effects of vaccination on piglet growth rates. We were also able to confirm sufficient levels of anti-PEDV neutralizing and IgA antibodies in the sera of orally primed sows, which were boosted by the K/K vaccination, colostrum at farrowing, and the sera of sows at and after farrowing, as well as representative offspring sera, indicating that nursing piglets were protected by the transfer of maternal immunity via colostrum and milk from immune dams. These results further support the notion that colostrum and milk IgA and PEDV neutralizing antibody titers are correlated for protective immunity against PEDV; thus, the optimal vaccine regimens tend to promote high levels of both antibodies in the lactogenic secretions of vaccinated sows (Lee, 2015 (Lee, , 2019 Langel et al., 2016; Song et al., 2016) .",

As a part of enzootic PEDV control in South Korea, a multiple-dose vaccination program with live (prime)killed (boost)-killed (boost) vaccines at 2-week or 3-week intervals prefarrowing has been commonly recommended for pregnant sows for decades (Lee, 2015) . Given the lessons from this traditional approach and the unavailability of an effective G2b-based MLV vaccine, the use of classical G1a MLV vaccines or feedback for prime-boost maternal vaccination strategies has been generally considered able to halt continuous devastation in the field since the overwhelming PED epidemic in 2013-2014. However, PEDV vaccination strategies based on historical G1a strains may create beneficial immune environments for the survival of epidemic G2b strains, which would continuously evolve to escape the host immune system under relieved immune pressures. In particular, aggressive feedback (i.e., intentional exposure) practices have since been adopted recklessly and involuntarily in a majority of domestic pig farms. Although feedback can artificially trigger rapid lactogenic immunity and hopefully shorten the outbreak period in PEDV-na\u00efve herds, a number of potential negative consequences exist, including the widespread dissemination of other viral pathogens, insufficient gut stimulation due to heterogeneous and low titers of infectious PEDV in autogenous materials, the increased risk of recombination and viral diversity, and unexpected transmission between facilities and farms followed by an endemic establishment (Jung et al., 2006; Lee, 2015; Park et al., 2009; Saif et al., 2012) . Therefore, it is anticipated that the proposed S DEL5/ORF3-based MLV vaccine will be able to replace the feedback approach used nationwide.",

The present work demonstrated that the fully attenuated phenotype of the S DEL5/ORF3 strain is not converted after five consecutive back passages in newborn piglets. Vaccination-challenge experiments revealed that sow immunization with an oral primeparenteral boost L/K/K regimen provides protective lactogenic immunity for piglets, thus averting mortality completely, greatly reducing morbidity and fecal shedding, and sustainably maintaining piglet growth performance following exposure to virulent PEDV. One disadvantage of oral administration, however, is that it is impossible to ensure that individual pigs are vaccinated with the appropriate dose; this issue needs to be overcome in order to efficiently employ live vaccines for oral priming purposes under various field conditions. Because the introduction of a new, safe, and effective MLV vaccine to the market is expected to be useful for combating PED, particularly in seropositive and PEDV-na\u00efve herds, customized implementation of vaccines such as the application of prime-boost maternal vaccination schemes should be established based on herd circumstances to prevent primary outbreaks, restrict the occurrence of re-infection or recurrent epidemics, and halt potential endemics. More importantly, stringent biosecurity/disinfection procedures and optimal farm and husbandry management practices must be combined to maximize vaccination as the most promising and effective approach to ensuring passive lactogenic immunity for the prevention and control of PED epizootics and enzootics.",
