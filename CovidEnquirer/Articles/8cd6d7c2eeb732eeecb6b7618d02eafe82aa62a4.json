            "text": "One hypothesis for the etiology of central nervous system (CNS) autoimmune disease is that infection by a virus sharing antigenic epitopes with CNS antigens (molecular mimicry) elicits a virus-specific immune response that also recognizes self-epitopes. To address this hypothesis, transgenic mice were generated that express the nucleoprotein or glycoprotein of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) as self in oligodendrocytes. Intraperitoneal infection with LCMV strain Armstrong led to infection of tissues in the periphery but not the CNS, and the virus was cleared within 7-14 d. After clearance, a chronic inflammation of the CNS resulted, accompanied by upregulation of CNS expression of MHC class I and II molecules. A second LCMV infection led to enhanced CNS pathology, characterized by loss of myelin and clinical motor dysfunction. Disease enhancement also occurred after a second infection with unrelated viruses that cross-activated LCMV-specific memory T cells. These findings indicate that chronic CNS autoimmune disease may be induced by infection with a virus sharing epitopes with a protein expressed in oligodendrocytes and this disease may be enhanced by a second infection with the same or an unrelated virus. These results may explain the association of several different viruses with some human autoimmune diseases.",

In molecular mimicry, a pathogen such as a virus shares peptide sequences or conformations with a host protein. The immune response to the viral infection results in a cross-reactive autoimmune attack against a target tissue expressing the mimicked protein. To date, molecular mimicry has been suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis of several human diseases, including insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (6) , ankylosing spondylitis (7), Guillain-Barre syndrome (8) , primary biliary cirrhosis (9) , and multiple sclerosis (MS) 1 (10) (11) (12) , but has yet to be conclusively shown to be the initiating factor of these autoimmune diseases.",

These viral genes were chosen for the following reasons. First, the immune response to LCMV has been well characterized (13, 14) . After peripheral (i.p.) infection of mice with LCMV strain Armstrong, a vigorous CD8 \u03e9 CTL response is generated that clears the virus from all tissues by 7-10 d after infection (13, 14) . CTL epitopes of LCMV have been defined on several MHC backgrounds, including H-2 d and H-2 b (15, 16) . Second, i.p. infection of immunocompetent mice with LCMV results in the infection of many tissues but not cells of the CNS. Thus, in this system it is possible to test whether the generation of an immune response against a 1 Abbreviations used in this paper: \u2424 gal, \u2424 -galactosidase; BHK, baby hamster kidney; CNS, central nervous system; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; GP, glycoprotein; i.p., peripheral; LCMV, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus; MBP, myelin basic protein; MS, multiple sclerosis; NP, nucleoprotein; PLP, proteolipid protein; PV, Pichinde virus; TAL-H, human transaldolase; VV, vaccinia virus. In this report, we present the results of peripheral infection of these transgenic mice by LCMV. We found that the LCMV infection was efficiently cleared, but a chronic CNS autoimmune disease developed and was enhanced by a second infection with LCMV or with unrelated viruses that stimulated LCMV-specific memory immune responses. This disease was characterized by T cell inflammatory lesions in the brain and spinal cord that included areas indicative of myelin loss, marked upregulation of CNS expression of MHC class I and class II molecules, and clinical motor dysfunction. This model establishes that an immune response to a peripheral viral infection can recognize identical antigens presented as self in the CNS, resulting in chronic CNS autoimmune disease.",

The full-length cDNA of the LCMV Armstrong GP was obtained by RT-PCR amplification of viral RNA. Total RNA was purified from the brain of a mouse that had been persistently infected with LCMV Armstrong since birth. cDNA was made using random hexamer primers and murine Maloney leukemia virus reverse transcriptase as described (17) . PCR amplification of the viral GP was done using primers that hybridize to the 5 \u0408 and 3 \u0408 ends of the GP sequence: primer 1, which hybridizes to bp 1-26, 5 \u0408 -CCGGGGATC-CTAGGCTTTTTGGATTG-3 \u0408 ; and primer 2, which hybridizes to bp 1553-1585, 5 \u0408 -GGGGATCCTGTTCTTCAGCGT-CTTTTCCAGAC-3 \u0408 . PCR was done using Taq Polymerase (Perkin Elmer Cetus, Norwalk, CT) following reaction conditions indicated by the manufacturer and performing 35 cycles at 95 \u040a C for 1 min, 60 \u040a C for 1 min, 72 \u040a C for 3 min. The 1575-bp product was cloned into the TA vector system (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA) and then digested with BamHI. The NP and GP cDNAs were cloned into the BamHI site of pMBP001, which contains sequences from \u03ea 1907 to \u03e9 36 of the MBP promoter, followed by a polylinker region linked to a portion of the proteolipid protein (PLP) gene as described (18) . The PLP sequences provided splice and polyadenylation signals and included PLP exon 6, intron 6, and exon 7. Linear DNA fragments containing the regulatory regions plus NP or GP sequences were obtained by NotI digestion. The DNA was microinjected in The Scripps Research Institute Transgenic Facility into BALB/cByJ \u03eb C57BL/6J fertilized eggs. LCMV-NP transgenic mice were bred to BALB/ cByJ (H-2 d ) mice, and the LCMV-GP transgenic mice were bred to C57BL/6J (H-2 b ) mice. MBP-\u2424 -galactosidase ( \u2424 gal) transgenic mice (18) were bred to BALB/cByJ and C57BL/6J mice.

Two MBP-NP (5 and 60) and two MBP-GP (36 and 46) lines with only CNS expression of the transgenes were chosen for further study (Fig. 1 , B and C ) and bred to the F4 level to BALB/c and C57BL/6J mice, respectively. Immunohistochemical approaches (in situ immunohistochemistry and Western blot) were undertaken to identify the transgene products in brain tissue; however, these attempts were unsuccessful.

Previous attempts at identifying LCMV gene products expressed as a transgene of the rat insulin promoter in the \u2424 cells of the Islets of Langerhans had also failed (19) .

This model requires the transgenic mice to mount an immune response against the transgene, which is a self-protein. Therefore, the first question addressed was whether the transgenic mice were immunologically responsive to the transgene (self) products. The ability of the MBP-LCMV transgenic mice to generate both anti-viral (self) CTL and antibodies was assessed. CTL responses of the transgenic mice were measured in 51 Cr release assays using splenic lymphocytes harvested 7 d after infection with LCMV. Transgenic and nontransgenic mice from all four transgenic MBP-NP and -GP lines were able to lyse MHC-matched target cells infected with LCMV (Table 1 ). In addition, BALB clone 7 (H-2 d ) target cells infected with a recombinant VV expressing the NP from LCMV (VV-NP) were lysed by lymphocytes from MBP-NP transgenic positive and negative mice. Likewise, MC57 (H-2 b ) target cells infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the GP from LCMV (VV-GP) were effectively lysed by lymphocytes from MBP-GP transgenic positive and negative mice. The ability of transgenic mice to mount anti-LCMV antibody responses was evaluated using an ELISA assay with gradient-purified LCMV. At 2 mo after infection with LCMV, MBP-NP and -GP transgenic positive and negative mice showed good antibody responses (antibody titers \u03fe 10 5 ; data not shown). Thus, the transgenic positive mice generated LCMV-specific humoral and cellular immune responses equivalent to transgenic negative mice, indicating they were able to mount immune responses to the viral self-proteins expressed as transgenes.",

Approximately 1,000 lymphocytes were observed per sagittal section at 1 wk after infection in both transgenic positive and negative mice. The majority of these lymphocytes were CD8 \u03e9 and were found within the meninges and ventricular linings of the brain. These cells were most likely activated by the viral infection and were trafficking through the CNS as a normal part of immune surveillance after activation in the periphery (32) . By 2 wk after infection, fewer meningeal infiltrating cells were observed in both transgenic positive and negative mice. By 3 wk after infection, in nontransgenic mice less than 30 lymphocytes could be found per sagittal section, and by 5 wk after infection less than 5 lymphocytes were detected per section. In contrast, in transgenic positive mice, at 3 wk after infection about 150-300 CD8 \u03e9 cells were found per section. These cells were located in the brain parenchyma as well as the brain stem and spinal cord, and perivascular cuffs were often observed. In addition, CD4 \u03e9 cells were present and comprised 20% of the infiltrating T cells. Brains of transgenic positive mice taken at various times after infection were found to contain this level of CD8 \u03e9 infiltrates as long as 1 yr after infection. By 1 yr after infection, the numbers of CD4 \u03e9 staining cells had risen to approximately half the number of CD8 \u03e9 staining cells per section. At 3 wk after infection, the infiltrating cells did not localize to any particular area or location within the brain. By 3 mo after infection, clusters of CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 cells were found predominantly within the white matter regions of the CNS, including the corpus callosum, internal capsule, fimbria hippocampus, brain stem, and spinal cord (Fig. 2, A, B, F, G) . Lymphocytes were isolated from the brains of MBP-NP transgenic positive mice 3 wk after LCMV infection and tested in 51 Cr-release CTL assays after in vitro stimulation with LCMV. These lymphocytes were found to effectively lyse MHC-matched target cells infected with either LCMV or recombinant VV expressing the LCMV NP (data not shown).",

To characterize further the effects of the inflammatory cell infiltration of the CNS of transgenic positive and negative mice after LCMV infection, brain sections were stained with additional immunohistochemical markers. The presence of B cells in the infiltrating population was examined using antibody to the B cell marker, B220. Insignificant numbers of B220 \u03e9 cells were observed in both transgenic positive and negative mice. Antibody to F4/80, a cell surface marker found on microglia, monocytes, and macrophages, revealed an upregulation of this molecule in regions of infiltrating T cells in transgenic positive mice (Fig. 2, C and H) . Microglial activation was observed as long as 1 yr after infection in association with T cell infiltration. Antibodies to MHC class I and II molecules were used to determine whether an increase in these antigen presentation markers was observed in response to the immune cell infiltration (Fig. 2, D, E, I, J) . In uninfected and LCMV-infected nontransgenic mice, MHC class I antigen staining was limited to the leptomeninges, choroid plexus, and endothelial cells of blood vessels. MHC class II staining was confined to a few macrophage-like cells in the interstitium of the choroid plexus. Staining for MHC class I and class II molecules in the brains of transgenic positive mice revealed that by 6 wk after infection there was an upregulation of both of these antigens on CNS cells in the vicinity of the infiltrating T cells, particularly pronounced in white matter regions. Antibody to MHC class I detected a fine reticular staining pattern in white matter regions, as well as staining many distinct cell types including those with microglial, lymphocyte, and endothelial cell morphology. Oligodendrocytes expressing MHC class I were identified by laser scanning confocal microscopy by colocalizing antibody to 2\u0408,3\u0408-cyclic nucleotide 3\u0408-phosphodiesterase (CNP) with antibody to MHC class I (Horwitz, M.S, C.F. Evans, and M.B.A. Oldstone, manuscript submitted for publication). Anti-MHC class II antibodies stained cells of different morphologies including cells similar to microglia. This upregulation of MHC class I and class II molecules was observed in association with infiltrating lymphocytes for at least 1 yr after infection with LCMV. Light and confocal microscopic analyses of sagittal brain sections stained with luxol fast blue or antibodies to myelin basic protein and CD8 failed to reveal any areas of myelin damage in the transgenic mice after a single LCMV infection.",

A peptide from the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa was also able to activate one of the MBP-specific T cell clones. Activation of the MBPspecific T cell clones by as many as 3-4 different viral peptides indicated that a single TCR could recognize peptides from several unrelated sources, and this recognition resulted in T cell activation. In other studies, T cell lines established from MS patients were reactive to both MBP and a sequence from the human respiratory coronavirus 229E (11, 34) . Additionally, molecular mimicry between human transaldolase (TAL-H), which in the brain is expressed selectively in oligodendrocytes, and human T cell lymphotropic virus type I/human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gag proteins has also been described (12) . TAL-H stimulated proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes from patients with MS, and in addition, autoantibodies to TAL-H were detected in the serum and cerebrospinal fluid of these patients.

            "text": "Mice expressing the LCMV NP or GP in their oligodendrocytes developed CNS autoimmune disease after a single infection with LCMV, and this disease was enhanced after a second infection with LCMV. This enhancement likely resulted from the activation of LCMV-specific memory T cells that traveled into the CNS, where they encountered transgene-expressing oligodendrocytes presenting LCMV peptides in association with MHC class I molecules. Increased levels of cytokines typically associated with activated CD8 \u03e9 / CD4 \u03e9 (Th1) cells were detected (IFN-\u2425, TNF-\u2423, and TNF-\u2424), as well as cytokines associated with activated macrophages/microglia (IL-1\u2423, IL-1\u2424, IL-12p40, and TNF-\u2423). IFN-\u2425 and TNF-\u2423 have been shown to increase MHC class I and/or class II molecules on a variety of cells (36) (37) (38) (39) , and thus the presence of these cytokines may account for the widespread upregulation of MHC class I and II molecules observed after double infection. In addition, TNF-\u2423 and TNF-\u2424 have been shown to be cytotoxic to oligodendrocytes in vitro (40, 41) . Damage to oligodendrocytes was demonstrated by confocal microscopic analyses of the lesions of infiltrating lymphocytes within the white matter. A number of observations were consistent with active myelin degradation, including the loss of MBP staining at the center of these lesions, the irregular shape of the lesions, the presence of activated microglia/macrophages in and around the lesions, and the uptake of MBP by these activated microglia/macrophages. The enhanced disease observed after a second LCMV infection shares several characteristics with the human CNS disease, MS, including chronic perivascular and parenchymal infiltration of autoreactive T cells in the brain and spinal cord, lesions in myelin tracts associated with the uptake of myelin components by activated macrophages/microglia, upregulation of MHC class I and class II molecules on resident CNS cells, activation of microglia and astrocytes, motor coordination dysfunction, and expression of cytokines in the CNS associated with cytotoxicity. MS is further characterized by the presence of plaques of demyelination in the CNS. These mice showed focal areas of demyelination consistent with sites of early plaque development. It is possible that additional environmental or genetic factors could influence further plaque development. Currently, studies are being done to manipulate the susceptibility of these mice to demyelination by evaluating the effects of genetic background, CNS cytokine expression, and TCR usage. Viruses have often been implicated in the etiology of MS (42, 43) , but it has not been possible to link just one virus with the disease. This model provides an opportunity to examine the roles of multiple viruses in inducing and potentiating CNS demyelinating disease, and will complement results from studies of the classical model of autoimmunity in MS, experimental allergic encephalomyelitis.",

However, no obvious damage to oligodendrocytes was observed after a single LCMV infection of transgenic mice. After a second viral infection of the transgenic mice, the proportion of CD4 \u03e9 T cells increased relative to the number of CD8 \u03e9 T cells (CD8 \u03e9 /CD4 \u03e9 , 2:1). Focal areas of myelin degradation were observed (Fig. 4) , and expression of both MHC class I and class II molecules was found on oligodendrocytes (Horwitz, M.S., C.F. Evans, and M.B.A. Oldstone, manuscript submitted for publication). These findings suggest that CD8 \u03e9 and/or CD4 \u03e9 T cells may interact directly with oligodendrocytes and play a role in oligodendrocyte injury. In addition, the total number of infiltrating T cells in the CNS increased three-to fivefold after a second infection with LCMV. Other models of autoimmune diseases have shown that the number of self-reactive T cells influences the development of disease (44) (45) (46) , so it is possible that the myelin damage seen after a second LCMV in-fection was a result of the increased numbers of infiltrating T cells.",

Upon infection with LCMV, immune-mediated destruction of the \u2424 cells occurred, resulting in diabetes. Although the transgenes and the infecting virus are the same in the pancreatic and the CNS models, destruction of the transgene-expressing target cells was much more severe in the diabetic model. The primary difference between these models is the organ in which the transgene is expressed. The CNS is unique due to the blood-brain barrier, which restricts the entry of certain cells and molecules from the blood, and the low or nondetectable expression of both MHC class I and class II molecules. It is likely that the nature of the immune response in the target organs is influenced by several factors, including differences in permeability of the islet capillaries and blood-brain barrier to various immune cells, in expression of adhesion and MHC molecules on endothelial and target cells, in types of antigen-presenting cells present, and in the local cytokine milieu. Delineation of the factors that determine the outcome of the transgene-specific immune response should reveal important differences between autoimmune disease of a peripheral organ such as the pancreas, and the CNS.",

Infection of naive transgenic mice with a virus not encoding LCMV gene products did not lead to CNS autoimmune disease. Exacerbation of CNS disease after infection with an unrelated virus required the presence of self-reactive (LCMV transgene-specific) memory lymphocytes established by a prior infection with LCMV. Studies of MBP-specific TCR transgenic mice showed that mice housed in a nonsterile environment spontaneously developed experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (48) . These observations suggested that both the TCR repertoire and exposure to environmental agents influenced susceptibility to CNS autoimmune disease. The results from our model indicate that the potential of the TCR repertoire to respond to a self-antigen, as well as the history of viral infections, are both crucial to the development of autoimmune disease.",

This could be due to a general nonspecific stimulation of memory cells (bystander activation) after the upregulation of cytokine expression in response to the second viral infection (49) . Preliminary experiments have shown that treatment of LCMV-immune MBP-NP mice with the interferon-inducer poly I/C (50, 51) did not result in enhanced CNS pathology. Alternatively, reactivation may be a result of cross-reactivities of LCMV-specific CTL with heterologous viral peptides presented by MHC class I molecules (33, 52) . Experiments to distinguish between these possibilities are in progress. After poliovirus immunization of human adults previously vaccinated for polio in childhood, immune responses to unrelated antigens (reovirus and tetanus toxoid) were observed, indicating that secondary activation of immune responses also occurs in humans (53) . The cross-activation of memory T cells specific for an oligodendrocyte protein by subsequent viral infections may explain why patients with an autoimmune disease such as MS often exhibit disease exacerbations after infections by different viruses (54) (55) (56) . It may also serve to explain both the long lag period before disease symptoms and the risk factor association of disease to the first 15 yr of life (57) . A cross-reactive immune response to oligodendrocyte-specific antigens through a process of molecular mimicry early in life could lead to the generation of memory T cells specific for a myelin antigen. These self-reactive T cells could then be reactivated after subsequent pathogen exposures, eventually leading to clinically observable disease exacerbations. Exploitation of the model described here will be useful for evaluating the potential of unrelated viruses to contribute to the exacerbation of CNS autoimmune disease, and for developing therapies to modify such disease.",

Four transgenic positive (open circles) and negative (closed circles) mice were tested for motor dysfunction on a rotorod apparatus in three consecutive trials as described in Materials and Methods. The time on the rotorod was measured, with a maximum of 180 s. The standard error is shown for all trials except the transgenic negative third trial, in which 3 out of 4 mice remained on the rod for the maximum time allowed. uninfected mice, or doubly infected nontransgenic mice: IFN-\u2425, TNF-\u2423, TNF-\u2424, IL-1\u2423, IL-1\u2424, and IL-12p40 (Fig. 5 A). No mRNAs for IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, or IL-13 were detected in transgenic positive or negative brains. Nontransgenic mice showed minor increases in the levels of TNF-\u2423, TNF-\u2424, and IL-1\u2424 message at 4 wk after second infection. This was most likely the result of immune surveillance and trafficking after viral induction of the memory immune response.",
