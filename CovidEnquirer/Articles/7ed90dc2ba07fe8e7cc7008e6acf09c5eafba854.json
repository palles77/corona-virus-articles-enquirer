Chronic cholangiohepatitis may frequently be associated with significant intrahepatic or extrahepatic biliary calculus formation. Discrete calculi can often be visualized ultrasonographically or at post mortem examination, but some horses with cholangiohepatitis develop a sonolucent 'sludgelike' material within the biliary tract.

However, the prognosis for these conditions varies greatly, e.g. successful outcome following treatment of cases of larval cyathostominosis occurs in approximately 50% of cases whereas there is virtually 100% mortality in cases of intestinal lymphosarcoma. For this reason a specific diagnosis is preferable but unfortunately that can generally only be achieved by histopathological examination of intestinal biopsy obtained at exploratory celiotomy/laparoscopy (or rectal biopsy in a minority of cases). Horses with hypoproteinaemia secondary to protein losing enteropathy are high risk for wound dehiscence and this, together with the high cost of equine abdominal surgery, means that a specific diagnosis is often only achieved at postmortem examination.
