            "text": "During the past 20 years, microbial detection methods that are genetically based, such as real-time PCR and peptide nucleic acid fluorescent hybridization, coexisted with traditional microbiological methods and were typically based on the identification of individual genetic targets. For these methods to be successful, a potential cause of infection must be suspected. More recently, multiplex PCR and multiplex RT-PCR were used to enable more broad-range testing based on panels of suspected pathogens. PCR-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR-ESI/MS) has emerged as a technology that is capable of identifying nearly all known human pathogens either from microbial isolates or directly from clinical specimens. Assay primers are strategically designed to target one or more of the broad pathogen categories: bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal, or viral. With broad-range amplification followed by detection of mixed amplicons, the method can identify genetic evidence of known and unknown pathogens. This unique approach supports a higher form of inquiry, asking the following question: What is the genetic evidence of known or unknown pathogens in the patient sample? This approach has advantages over traditional assays that commonly target the presence or absence of one or more pathogens with known genetic composition. This review considers the breadth of the published literature and explores the possibilities, advantages, and limitations for implementation of PCR-ESI/MS in diagnostic laboratories. ( Any practicing microbiologist associates microbial detection with microbial stains, culture, and other phenotypic analysis. Throughout the past two decades, genetic-based detection methods, such as real-time PCR and peptide nucleic acid fluorescent hybridization, co-existed with traditional microbiological methods and were typically based on the detection of individual genetic targets; therefore, prior suspicion of the potential causes of infection was typically required. Within the past decade, multiplex PCR and multiplex RT-PCR were implemented to enable partial broad-range testing based on the detection of panels of likely pathogens. In some cases, true broad-range diagnostic testing was achieved using capillary sequencing or pyrosequencing approaches that interrogate clinical samples with consensus primers to both amplify and sequence conserved genetic regions, such as the 16S region of bacteria or the 18S region of fungi. Although previously described methods remain engrained in diagnostic laboratories, emerging new technologies, such as PCR-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (PCR-ESI/MS), offer a new approach with the capability to identify nearly all known human pathogens directly from clinical specimens and the potential to identify genetic evidence of undiscovered pathogens 1 and genetic changes that may occur to alter sequences used as targets in existing molecular assays. Designed for both broadrange and target-specific identification of pathogens and their genetic characteristics, PCR-ESI/MS can identify minute quantities and mixtures of nucleic acids. Therefore, if a novel microbial genetic sequence is uncovered, it is reported and accompanied by information that describes its relationship to closely related organisms. As an example of pathogen discovery, one situation stands out and exemplifies the potential impact of PCR-ESI/MS technology. In April 2009, the technology detected the first US case of the novel H1N1 influenza virus 2 in San Diego, CA. In this instance, the virus was identified as novel but genetically related to influenza A.",

The first report describing testing of mixed microbes directly from patient samples depicts a military-based outbreak investigation. Analysis of respiratory samples revealed high concentrations of pathogenic respiratory species, including Haemophilus influenzae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Streptococcus pyogenes. When S. pyogenes was identified in samples from the epidemic site, the identical genotype was found in almost all recruits. 31 Kaleta et al 10 performed PCR-ESI/MS testing directly from blood culture bottles and compared results with conventional methods to identify the genus and species of microorganisms found to cause human bloodstream infections (n \u03ed 234). This study demonstrated high analytical accuracy, with 98.7% and 96.6% concordance at the genus and species levels, respectively. Mixtures of microbes were identified in 29 blood culture bottles, including mixed species of the same genus, and mixtures containing Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms, exemplifying the ability to identify multiple organisms simultaneously without the need for further sub-cultivation. The study also reports some microbe combinations that were not accurately detected; therefore, method improvements are still required. 10 In a second study, compared with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-TOF/MS of subcultured microbial isolates, no statistically significant difference in accuracy was observed. 32 Stoodley et al 33 performed testing and evaluated PCR-ESI/MS for use in bacterial biofilms, which have been observed in many prosthesis-related infections. An ankle arthroplasty culture, negative on preoperative aspiration produced positive results via PCR-ESI/MS, detecting Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and the methicillin-resistance gene mecA in soft tissues associated with the explanted hardware. This viable multispecies biofilm was confirmed by further micrographic and molecular examinations, such as confocal microscopy using Live/Dead stain, bacterial fluorescence in situ hybridization, and RT-PCR for bacterial mRNA. These results suggest that PCR/ESI-MS may be a useful adjunct to routine cultures in the detection of biofilm bacteria in prosthetic joint infections.",

            "text": "With promise in the field of influenza surveillance, pandemic preparedness, and as an aid to vaccine strain selection, rapid RT-PCR-ESI/MS is a broad-range influenza identification tool that can be used to simultaneously identify all types of influenza viruses from clinical specimens. Viruses are identified with clade-level resolution of viral populations, which is useful for monitoring global spread and emergence of novel viral genotypes. Base compositions of RT-PCR amplicons from influenza core gene segments (PB1, PB2, PA, M, NS, and NP) are analyzed to provide subspecies identification and infer influenza virus H and N subtypes. In one report, 42 the assay correctly identified 92 mammalian and avian influenza isolates, representing 30 different H and N types, including 29 avian H5N1 isolates. Furthermore, direct analysis of 656 human clinical respiratory specimens collected during a 7-year period (1999 to 2006) showed correct identification of the viral species and subtypes, with \u03fe97% sensitivity and specificity. Base compositionderived clusters inferred from this analysis showed 100% concordance to previously established clades. Ongoing surveillance of samples from the recent influenza virus seasons (2005 to 2006) showed evidence for emergence and establishment of new genotypes of circulating H3N2 strains worldwide. Mixed viral quasispecies were found in approximately 1% of these recent samples, providing a view into viral evolution. 42 In subsequent work, the assay differentiated novel H1N1 from seasonal and other nonhuman host viruses, demonstrating its usefulness and robustness in influenza virus surveillance and detection of novel and unusual viruses with previously unseen genomic prints. 43 In this study, 757 samples collected between 2006 and 2009 were tested, including 302 seasonal H1N1, 171 H3N2, 7 swine triple reassortants, and 277 H1N1 viruses. Of the 277 H1N1 samples, 209 were clinical specimens (eg, throat, nasal and nasopharyngeal swabs, nasal washes, blood, and sputum).",

Subsequent analysis of an additional 276 H1N1 pandemic samples revealed that they shared the genomic print of A/California/04/2009, which differed from those of North American swine triple reassortant viruses, seasonal H1N1 and H3N2, and other viruses tested. 44 Moreover, this assay allowed distinction between core genes of cocirculating groups of seasonal H1N1, such as clades 2B and 2C, and their reassortants with dual antiviral resistance to adamantanes and oseltamivir. 43 In a broader assessment of emerging coronaviruses, 14 isolates of nine diverse Coronavirus species, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus, were tested. 25 The PCR-ESI/MS method identified and distinguished between severe acute respiratory syndrome and other known coronaviruses, including the human coronavirus 229E and OC43, individually and in a mixture of all three human viruses. The sensitivity of detection was estimated to be approximately 1 plaqueforming unit (PFU)/mL. 25 Finally, the NFDU Respiratory Viral Panel identifies respiratory syncytial virus; influenza A and B; parainfluenza 1 to 3; adenovirus A to F; coronavirus; and human metapneumovirus. Chen et al 45 tested nasopharyngeal aspirates to detect acute infections of the upper respiratory tract and found only 77.9% sensitivity but identified an additional 7% positive viruses relative to viral culture and antigen detection.",

First, there is the potential for contamination. Because this instrument is an open platform, there is potential for instruments and workspace to be exposed to amplicons and for subsequent contamination of future samples during processing. To mitigate this concern, it is imperative to maintain a separate positive-pressure space for reagent preparation before PCR and a strict unidirectional work flow. Furthermore, in January 2012, an exhaust adaptor will be available to direct TOF emissions out of the work area.",

Because PCR-ESI/MS is semiquantitative, a relative intensity of multiple organisms can be determined, allowing for selection of a treatment that manages multiple organisms. A confidence score is also assigned to both organisms, depending on the number of primers making the identification and goodness of fit to database compositions. Interpretation of mixtures relies on examining a combination of factors, including the quality of the result (Q score), the signal intensity, the match to the expected base count, and the number of primers that produce a result. Improvements in assessing the signals derived from mixed infection will be required prior to clinical implementation. A future clinical software version will interpret the score automatically, but the NFDU software allows users to see all of the contributing factors and perform the analysis themselves.",

A few published studies 22,25 address the limit of detection in terms of colony-forming unit/mL or PFU/mL, reported as low as 1 to 10/mL. In general, the limit of detection for PCR/ ESI-MS will be similar to that of other multiplex PCR assays. Low-level environmental contamination may be mitigated by the use of DNA-free and ultrapure reagents. In addition, inspection of the semiquantitative measurement of the relative number of genomes per well will be important. Environmental contamination would be expected to produce results associated with low genomes per well. Despite these assessments, it may be difficult to distinguish environmental contamination from low-level pathogens. Appropriate cut-off values for positive signals will need to be refined to address this limitation.",

The combined expense of start-up and kits will make PCR-ESI/MS implementation into general laboratories difficult, but implementation may be within reach for larger clinical and reference laboratories.
