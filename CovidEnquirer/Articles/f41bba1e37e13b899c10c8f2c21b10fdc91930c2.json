Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new human respiratory infectious disease caused by SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV plays an important role in the virus entry into a cell. In this study, eleven synthetic peptides from the S protein were selected based on its sequence homology with human proteins. Two of the peptides D07 (residues 927-937) and D08 (residues 942-951) were recognized by the sera of SARS patients. Murine hyperimmune sera against these peptides bound to proteins of human lung epithelial cells A549. Another peptide D10 (residues 490-502) stimulated A549 to proliferate and secrete IL-8. The present results suggest that the selected S protein regions, which share sequence homology with human proteins, may play important roles in SARS-CoV infection.",

Spike protein is very important in the binding and fusion of coronavirus to the host cells [11, 12] . The S protein of SARS-CoV has 1255 amino acids in length and 23 potential N-linked glycosylation sites. The amino terminus of the SARS-CoV S protein contains a short type 1 signal sequence composed of hydrophobic amino acids that are presumably removed during cotranslational transport through the endoplasmic reticulum. The carboxyl terminus consists of a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic tail rich in cysteine residues. The majority of protein (residues 12-1195) is outside the virus particle, which can be divided into amino-terminal S1 and carboxylterminal S2 domain. The S1 domain (residues 12-672) binds to the host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), while the S2 domain is responsible for membrane fusion [13] [14] [15] . Monoclonal antibodies against S1 domain can block the receptor binding and contain potent neutralization activity against SARS-CoV [16] . However, peptides derived from S2 domain can also inhibit SARS-CoV infection [12] .",

Therefore, identification of the molecular mimic regions of pathogen may be helpful to understand the disease induced by that pathogen. At present, it is unclear whether molecular mimicry occurs between SARS-CoV S proteins and human peptides. We have approached this question using computer to analyze the sequence of spike protein of SARS-CoV and select regions that share the sequence homology with human proteins. The criteria for the selection of potential regions include antigenic analysis and surface accessibility. In this study, we find that several regions of the S protein share sequence homology with human proteins. Synthetic peptides, which represent some of these regions, were synthesized to understand their roles in SARS-CoV infection.",

Algorithms predicting immunogenicity, second structure prediction, protein topology analysis, and hydrophobicity were conducted to design the tested peptides. Immunogenic viral peptides were calculated based on the algorithm developed by Kolaskar and Tongaonkar [18] . The algorithm is based on a table constructed from the occurrence of amino acid residues in experimentally known antigenic epitopes. The reported accuracy of the method is about 75% [18] . In silico secondary structural analyses of spike protein were performed based on PHD [19] and PREDATOR [20] algorithms. Protein topology prediction was based on the algorithm developed by TMHMM [21] . Hydrophobicity of the peptides was calculated based on the algorithm HMO-MENT [22] . Similarity searches between S protein and human genome database were performed by using BLASTP [23] with BLOSUM 62. Extra amino acid residues were added at either N-or C-terminus to keep the hydrophobic amino acid content below 50%. Peptides with high hydrophobicity are difficult to be tested in biochemical experiments since most of in vitro assays are conducted in aqueous buffers. Also, on average, one charged residue is added for every five amino acids. Multiple antigen peptides were synthesized by CytoMol Corp (Mountain View, Calif, USA). In addition, bradykinin and angiotensin I (Ang I) were purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, Mo, USA).",

Mice were boosted with the same peptide in PBS (50 \u03bcg/mouse) intraperitoneally two weeks after priming. Sera were collected from the axially plexus of the mice at different time intervals and tested for the presence of antibody against peptides by ELISA as mentioned above. Significant increase of antibody titer (greater than 4 folds) against immunized-peptide was found in mouse hyperimmune sera as compared to normal sera after boosting.

Among them, pathogenic region 3 (residues 893-941), which shares sequence homology with Angrgm-52 (GenBank accession no. AAL62340), a novel gene upregulated in human mesangial cells stimulated by angiotensin II, may deserve further investigation. Peptides D07 and D08 of this region were recognized by the sera of SARS patient indicating that this region is immunogenic and can be recognized by the immune system during SARS-CoV infection. Murine hyperimmune sera against peptides D07 or D08 were able to bind to recombinant S2 but not S1 domain of S protein (data not shown). In addition, hyperimmune sera against D07 or D08 also bounded to the cytoplasmic region of A549 cells and recognized several proteins in the A549 cell lysate. These results indicate that regions represented by D07 and D08 are immunogenic and may induce autoantibodies. However, further study is required to understand the biological function of these regions and the role of their antibodies in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV infection. In addition to D07 and D08 peptides, we also noticed that D10 peptide which represents residues 490-502 of S1 domain contained some interesting activities. The D10 peptide, which shared sequence homology with bradykinin, was able to generate antibodies crossreactive with bradykinin. In addition, D10 peptide could stimulate A549 to produce IL-8 and proliferation as Ang I did. These results suggest that the region of D10 in S protein may bind to Ang I receptor, ACE2, and may be involved in the binding of SARS-CoV to ACE2. This is consistent with the previous report, which indicates that residues 318-510 of S1 domain can bind to ACE2 [25] 7 and is similar to the receptor binding domain of the HCoV-229E, which is within a fragment containing residues 407 to 547 [26] . Therefore, region 490-502 of S1 domain may be involved in the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV.",
