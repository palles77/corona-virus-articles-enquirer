The 3 Old World camelids (OW) are the dromedary, the domestic Bactrian camel, and the wild Bactrian camel. The lineage of New World camelids (NW) has been more controversial, though most now agree it consists of the genus Lama and a separate genus Vicugna. The llama belongs to Lama glama and the guanaco belongs to L. guanicoe. The alpaca and vicu\u00f1a belong to Vicugna pacos and V. vicugna, respectively. Interbreeding between NW species and between OW species produce fertile crosses, but to date fertile young have not been produced by crosses between NW and OW camelids (Fowler, 2010c) . Only the free-ranging population of wild Bactrian camel is endangered. Bactrian camels held in zoos are generally of domestic origin. Vicu\u00f1a are listed as vulnerable. This chapter focuses on diseases of camelids, most of which have been described in domesticated and zoo animals. Where disease has also been described in free-range animals, it will be specifically mentioned.",

Camelids are foregut fermenters, but the anatomy of the foregut is markedly different from that of other ruminants. A common nomenclature has not been adopted, but most divide the stomach into three compartments: C-1, C-2, and C-3 (Vallenas et al., 1971) . Unlike other ruminants, all of the compartments have glandular regions and none have papillae. C-1 fills the left abdomen and is partially divided into cranial and caudal sacs by a tranverse pillar. Glandular saccules are present along the ventral aspect of both the cranial and caudal sacs ( Fig. 7 .2A). The mucosa of C-2 is largely glandular except for an area along the lesser curvature that forms the esophageal groove. The remaining mucosal surface of C-2 is criss-crossed by bands or crests covered by stratified squamous epithelium forming deep pockets that are lined by glandular epithelium. C-3 is lined entirely by glandular epithelium that appears in three patterns. In the first fifth of its length, there is a retiform (net-like) pattern of shallow depressions along the lesser curvature and folds of mucosa along the greater curvature. In the middle three fifths of C-3, there are permanent longitudinal folds. In the distal fifth of C-3, the mucosa is lined by true gastric glands, is more deeply red and smoother, and the wall is thicker. The pH drops abruptly from 6.5 to 2.0 in the terminal region of C-3.",

New World FIGURE 7.1 Normal red blood cells from an alpaca. Camelid erythrocytes have a unique elliptical shape and are much smaller than those of domestic species. This is suggested to be an evolutionary mechanism that prevents blood sludging during periods of dehydration. camelids have evolved in the presence of highly variable food resources, with a \"feast and famine\" routine -periods of high dietary input followed by very low input. Because of this physiologic adaptation, over feeding in captive and domesticated NW camelids is common and can lead to significant consequences. Maintaining and monitoring proper body condition in camelids can be challenging. Due to their heavy wool, NW camelids may be too thin and managers will not recognize this unless they are palpated. In OW camels, there is not a similar \"feast and famine\" syndrome, but these animals are well adapted to storing nutrients and maintaining condition with poor quality feeds. The hump stores fat and will increase and decrease in size and firmness depending on the nutritional condition (Fowler, 2010b) .",

Serous atrophy of fat is yellow to red, translucent, and gelatinous. This contrasts to normal firm white to tan marrow fat. Atrophy in this marrow cavity was the result of dramatic caloric insufficiency. bilateral laminar necrosis of the neurons in the deep laminae, edema of the superficial laminae, and gliosis are characteristic. While necrosis is most typically seen in the cerebrum, it can also be found in the cerebellum. Gliosis will vary with the age of the lesion, being more prominent as the lesion matures.

Grossly, the liver is enlarged with rounded edges and it is pale tan to yellow with a greasy texture ( Fig. 7.7) . In rare cases, hepatic changes may be so severe as to cause the liver to float in formalin or water. Histologically, changes are diffuse with large clear, distinct cytoplasmic vacuoles and peripheralized nuclei in hepatocytes. Pregnant and lactating camelids are prone to lipidosis in a manner similar to ketotic ruminants with inadequate carbohydrates in the diet (Cebra, 2009) . In other NW camelids, stressful events and/or hepatic toxins are more likely responsible. Secondary hepatoencephalopathy associated with lipidosis has been described in llamas. Alzheimer type II astrocytosis in the cerebrum and to a lesser extent in the hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum are present in affected animals (Pillitteri and Craig, 2012) . Decreased astrocytic immunohistochemical labelling intensity for glial fibrillary acid protein is seen in the brains of neurological llamas with hepatic dysfunction. In addition, distinct from ruminants, fat can accumulate in renal tubular epithelium under similar circumstances as hepatic lipidosis and lead to kidney dysfunction in camelids.",

As in domestic ruminants, deficiencies in camelids can be due to selenium deficient (some geographic areas have low soil selenium) or Vitamin E deficient (mature or inadequately stored) forage. Vitamin E is a fat soluble nutrient that cannot be stored in the liver, so daily ingestion is required. With very severe deficiency, cardiac and skeletal muscle degeneration and necrosis develop; mineralization may be present in areas of necrosis. Heavily used muscles such as the intercostals, diaphragm, and tongue are commonly affected. Cardiac necrosis can lead to sudden death; important differentials for sudden cardiac death due to cardiomyonecrosis are oleander or ionophore toxicity, both of which are relatively common in captive camelids. It is likely that other plants throughout the natural ranges of camelids and ornamental plants used in zoos have similar cardiotoxic effects. In addition to feed and tissue level testing for selenium and Vitamin E, toxicologic testing may be required to rule out toxins when myocardial necrosis is seen. Hepatic lipidosis is characterized by yellow to light tan, locally extensive to diffuse discoloration of the liver, a greasy friable texture, and rounded lobe margins. It is common in NW camelids, particularly in pregnant and lactating camelids when dietary carbohydrates are inadequate. (Photo Courtesy of A. Tibary, Washington State University) Fat necrosis in camelids is associated with vitamin E and selenium deficiency, rapid weight loss, and some toxins (such as endophyte infected fescue), particularly in overweight animals with excessive intra-abdominal fat. In dromedary camels, hump fat necrosis is also anecdotally associated with vitamin E and selenium deficiency and causes histologic lesions similar to those seen in other species, including saponification and mineralization.",

The disease may be unilateral or bilateral and is most often seen on the left ovary though studies vary in the specific percentages of unilateral versus bilateral lesions. Grossly, the bursa is usually mildly to markedly distended by hemorrhagic fluid (Fig. 7 .10). Histologically, there is degeneration and hyperplasia of the bursal epithelial lining; infiltration of the lining by variably intense aggregates of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and macrophages; cysts within the epithelial lining; multiple variably expansive regions of hemorrhage; and intralesional hemosiderin-laden macrophages. The high estrogen content of the bursal fluid in this condition suggests it is a mixture of hemorrhage and follicular fluid (the estrogen content of the distended bursa tends to be much higher than serum). While a specific cause has not been proven, over 86% of camels with hydrobursitis have serological evidence of Chlamydia abortus infection, suggesting this organism may be involved in the pathogenesis .

A history of high environmental temperatures, high humidity, physical activity, social stress, dehydration, and/or fever in a heavily fleeced down, moribund or dead NW camelid is highly suggestive of hyperthermia or heat stress. Tissues will rapidly autolyze under these conditions, so prompt post mortem inspection is critical to make a diagnosis. Lesions suggestive of hyperthermia include petechial hemorrhages, hyperemia, thrombosis, pulmonary edema and congestion, neuronal necrosis, hepatic necrosis, and renal tubular necrosis (Fowler, 2010g) . Hypothermia can also be a concern in NW and OW camelids kept in northern climates where frostbite can occur; it primarily affects the ears. Some NW camelids have congenitally shortened ears FIGURE 7.9 Ulceration and secondary infection of the sternal callosity of a dromedary camel. The sternal callosity (or pedestal) is ulcerated and secondarily infected. It contains a large central cavitation with hemorrhage, and is covered by crusted, serocellular debris. In older NW and OW camelids this condition is due to prolonged recumbency or poor substrates. In OW camels, a bony protruberance underlies this callosity and extension of inflammation can lead to osteomyelitis.",

Microabscesses and neutrophilic infiltration of the superficial epidermis with ballooning degeneration are associated with orthokeratotic and parakeratotic hyperkeratosis.

In C-1 and C-2, ulcerations are typically noted along the margins of saccules primarily in the glandular regions (Fig. 7.11 ). In C-3, ulcers are typically linear along the longitudinal pleats in the proximal 4/5 th , but are focal and deeper in the last 1/5 th . Expansive ulcers may occur at the margin of compartment C-2 and C-3. These are most often seen in neonates with hypothermia, sepsis, or during periods of social or metabolic stress. Ulcers in the distal part of C-3 are the most likely to perforate, leading to peritonitis and rapid death. Underlying causes of ulcer development is poorly understood and likely multifactorial. Social and environmental stresses and associated catecholamine secretion has been suggested. Hypercortisolism is associated with acid hypersecretion in the gastric lumen of other species and is presumed to also be the case in camelids. Duodenal reflux and gastric vasoconstriction may also be factors in stressed animals. There is no acid secretion in C-1, however, so ulceration in this area cannot be explained by this mechanism. Other lesions that might be associated FIGURE 7.10 Ovarian hydrobursitis in a dromedary camel. This is a unique condition seen exclusively in dromedary camels. The ovarian bursa is mildly to markedly distended and filled with a mixture of follicular fluid and hemorrhage. The condition may be unilateral or bilateral. (Photo Courtesy of A. Tibary, Washington State University) with stress-induced gastric ulceration are lymphoid atrophy and adrenal cortical hyperplasia, the latter used to build a case for stress induced disease when ulceration is noted at postmortem examination.",

It is an OIE listed reportable disease and is the most common viral disease in dromedary and Bactrian camels. It is zoonotic and capable of infecting immunocompetent humans, though it is more likely to cause severe disease in immunocompromised individuals. With electron microscopy this virus appears as brick-shaped, enveloped particles with rounded edges measuring 360 \u00b5m x 270 \u00b5m x 250 \u00b5m. Parapoxviruses can be differentiated by their more ovoid shape than camelpox. Camelpox has been experimentally reproduced in NW camelids, though it is not present in the Americas or Australia.

Healing can take up to 4-6 weeks and can leave scars or cause multifocal alopecia (Balamurugan et al., 2013) . Lesions are most commonly found in the skin, but a disseminated form may also occur in young animals stressed by weaning or poor husbandry. In this form, similar crusting lesions may spread more widely, particularly affecting the head and the limbs but also the neck and abdomen. In the most severe cases, proliferative necrotizing lesions in the oral cavity or respiratory or gastrointestinal tracts may lead to death. These animals demonstrate hypersalivation, anorexia, mucopurulent nasal and ocular discharge, and diarrhea. Abortion can also occur.

Typical lesions are characterized by marked epidermal proliferation with superficial necrosis that is most common on the oral commissures and lips of crias and calves, and on the teats and perineum of dams. Microscopically, there is swelling and vacuolation of keratinocytes, epidermal proliferation, suppurative inflammation, and a marked accumulation of crusts. Eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions appear by 2-3 days post-infection and persist for 3-4 days. Lesions in camelids tend to persist longer than those seen in goats and sheep.

Clinical signs include immunosuppressive and respiratory and reproductive tract diseases. In utero infection can lead to the birth of persistently infected offspring. In NW camelids, in utero infection with subsequent abortion or birth of persistently infected (PI) offspring are the most commonly described outcomes. Infection in alpaca has been associated with abortion and BVDV positive fetal tissues, or chronically ill, stunted, and immunosuppressed crias that may be seronegative, but positive for BVDV by PCR or virus isolation Mattson et al., 2006; Nelson et al., 2015) . Other outcomes include stillbirth, neonatal death, and congenital deformities; chronic respiratory or gastrointestinal disease have also been reported. Disease has not been described in OW camelids, but both serological response and molecular presence of BVDV-1 in both Bactrian and dromedary camels suggest exposure (Gao et al., 2013; Intisar et al., 2010) . A new substrain of BVDV (BVDV-1q) was first identified in Bactrian camels and later identified in dairy cattle and swine in China (Gao et al., 2013) .",

Susceptibility varies markedly between species of camelids, making the role of camelids in the epidemiology and regulation of this disease controversial.

NW camelids can contract the disease both naturally and experimentally, but they are significantly less susceptible than cattle and sheep and stop shedding 14 days post-infection; they do not remain carriers after infection (Wernery and Kinne, 2012a) . Lesions are similar to those described in ruminants: vesicle formation followed by erosions and ulcers on the tongue, dental pads, oral cavity, palate, lips, nostril, coronary band, interdigital space with undermining of the footpads, teats, and the pillars of C-1 and C-2.",

It is seen primarily in Peru and South America but has also been reported in North America. Acute forms are usually seen in young animals that develop high fever, depression, and recumbency. Polyserositis is a significant common finding and systemic effects include fibrinous peritonitis and pleuritis, as well as fibrinosuppurative meningitis. Chronic abscesses are more common in adults in which there may be an environmental source of infection. Transmission is likely by direct contact or oral routes, and more severe forms are generally associated with an environmental, nutritional, or social stress (Fowler, 2010e; Jones et al., 2009) . Similar disease has recently been described in OW camelids in North America and in abbatoirs in Africa, suggesting that this may be a more widespread disease among camelids than previously thought (Abubakar et al., 2010; Stoughton and Gold, 2015) .",

Infection is likely transmitted by insects, though specific vectors have not been identified. Vertical transmission has been established, with crias showing infection at 1 day of age before colostrum ingestion. Weight loss, lethargy, and anemia, which can be life-threatening, are commonly reported though the pathogenesis of infection is not well documented.

NW camelids appear to be very susceptible to this infection. It is acquired via inhalation of infectious arthrospores. The fungus is endemic in desert areas of southern California, the San Joaquin Valley, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas in the United States; as well as desert areas of northern Mexico, Northwest Venezuela, Argentina, Bolivia, and Paraguay, Honduras, Guatemala, and Nicaragua (Fowler, 2010e) . Coccidioidomycosis usually presents as a respiratory disease. However, disseminated disease is common and can cause lesions affecting the neurological system, heart, liver, kidney, skin, bone, eyes, or lymphoid tissues; clinical signs reflect the location of the lesions (Coster et al., 2010; Fowler et al., 1992) . Granulomas or granulomatous inflammation surrounding intralesional fungal arthroconidia, spherules, and endospores are characteristic, and inflammation can coalesce into large masses that efface organs. Inflammation surrounding freshly ruptured spherules may be suppurative. Multinucleated giant cells may also be present. In its parasitic form, infective arthroconidia transform into immature spherules (10 \u00b5m -20 \u00b5m in diameter) that mature into large, up to 200 \u00b5m diameter mature spherules (or sporangia) filled with 2 \u00b5m -5 \u00b5m endospores. Sporangia subsequently rupture, releasing endospores into adjacent tissue that form new spherules, or if they are released into the environment, the endospores form mycelia. Aerosolized endospores can be a significant zoonotic threat, especially in a laboratory setting if appropriate precautions are not followed (Caswell and Williams, 2016) .",

In the host, adult worms live in the veins of the dura mater where the eggs and larvae enter the blood vessels, flow to the lungs, and infiltrate the alveoli. They are then expectorated, swallowed, and are defecated into the environment. Terrestrial snails and slugs ingest the larvae, which are subsequently ingested again by the host. Larvae released from the snail in the host's stomach penetrate the peritoneum and migrate to the spinal cord via the spinal nerves. Larvae mature in the gray matter dorsal horns and adults then migrate to the brain via the subdural space and finally through the dura mater to the venous sinuses. In deer, the definitive host, there are few lesions and little clinical disease; however, in aberrant hosts, such as NW camelids, damage to the neurologic system is often severe and clinical signs reflect sites of damage. The presence of peripheral eosinophilia and increased eosinophils in the cerebrospinal fluid is variable.",

Acute massive infections can lead to bile stasis, liver degeneration and necrosis, hepatic insufficiency, and death. More commonly, chronic infections are characterized by bile duct obstruction and bile stasis with cholangitis and bile epithelial hyperplasia (Hilbe et al., 2015) . Anemia and hypoproteinemia are common, and an unthrifty condition and particularly poor wool quality develops. Grossly, hepatic fibrosis and ascites are prominent. Regenerative hepatic nodules, mineralized foci, and abscesses may also be present. Histologically, in chronically infected animals, the liver contains multifocal to regionally extensive and occasionally coalescing areas of abundant fibrosis with biliary hyperplasia that surrounds regenerative nodules. Neutrophils, lymphocytes and plasma cells, and some macrophages are free in the parenchyma, periportal, and in the lumina of bile ducts. Flukes and their ova are often found in affected areas in the bile ducts and within the parenchyma. Characteristic features of trematodes are their tegument, lack of body cavity, and the presence of both gonads (hermaphrodites). Flukes found in camels can be differentiated by their size and the presence of spines. Fasciola spp. are the largest flukes in camelids (cm vs. mm) and have spines on their tegument. F. hepatica ova are large (120 mm -140 mm) and lack a miracidium. D. dendriticum ova are small (40 mm x 25 mm) oval, have a golden wall, are operculated, and contain a miracidium. Pulmonary trematodiasis in NW camelids can be associated with severe intimal and adventitial thickening and mild to moderate medial thickening (Hilbe et al., 2015) .",

Trypanosoma evansii causes surra in camels and is found in Southeast, East, and Central Asia, as well as North Africa (T. evansii has been reported from South America; it has not been identified in NW camelids). The tsetse fly (Glossinia spp.) is the intermediate host and after feeding on the blood of an infected animal, the organisms multiply in the fly's hindgut and are deposited as metamorphosed trypanosome in the salivary secretions when the fly takes its next blood meal. Two syndromes have been reported in camels: an acute and chronic form. In acute surra, there is fever, anemia, edema, and weakness that progresses to paralysis. Pulmonary edema may lead to secondary pneumonia. Abortion and caseous mastitis have also been reported. Death usually occurs within weeks and there are many parasites in blood smears (Fig. 7.15 ). In the more chronic form, there is intermittent fever, anemia and edema, and progressive loss of condition. Between febrile episodes, finding organisms in blood smears may be challenging, so sample collection should coincide with periods of fever. T. evansii is characterized by its spindloid body, undulating membrane along one side, anterior flagellum, and kinetoplast. To detect organisms in blood smears, samples should be collected during periods of fever. Organisms may be very rare during the intervening afebrile periods. Wright-Giemsa stain (Photo Courtesy of A. Tibary, Washington State University) T. brucei and T. congolensis are the causes of human sleeping sickness and can also infect camels. However, they are not a primary cause of surra in camels, though these organisms may prevent camels from being kept in the socalled Tsetse Belt of Africa. T. brucei, T. congolense, and T. vivax have been well described in cattle; however, lesions in camels have not been characterized in the literature. It would be expected that lesions might be similar, and consist of interstitial pneumonia, myocardial degeneration and myocarditis, bone marrow atrophy, lymphadenitis with follicular hyperplasia followed by atrophy and sclerosis, thymic atrophy, and renal membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, and interstitial fibrosis (Valli et al., 2016) . In cattle, organisms are most often seen in the liver and the cerebral cortex, though they may be found in any organ (Valli et al., 2016) . PCR assays have been developed and can be used in camels.",

Thickening of the skin is a differentiating feature of sarcoptic mange. Psoroptic mange produces moist papules progressing to crusts, on the shoulders, back, sides, and tailhead, as well as in the ears with subsequent fiber loss.

Arthropods, including flies and ticks, are suspected vectors. Upon entry, the virus replicates locally producing a primary erythematous lesion. The infection then spreads to local lymph nodes and a leukocyte-associated viremia develops(Balamurugan et al., 2013). During this time virus can be identified in skin, turbinates, lungs, and lymphoid organs. A few days after viremia begins, widespread secondary skin lesions (typical pox) appear and persist for 2-3 days until viremia subsides. Like other poxviral diseases, a Al-Hizab, F.A., Ramadan, R.O.
