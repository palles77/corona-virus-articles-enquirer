Since remyelination is a prominent feature in MS lesions, we examined the frequencies of T cell lines (TCLs) specific for epitopes within exon 2 encoded MBP (X2MBP), and also within 18.5-kDa MBP, in members of a multiplex family with MS. TCLs specific for X2MBP were as prevalent as TCLs specific for immunodominant epitopes within 18.5-kDa MBP. In addition, while frequencies of TCLs specific for 18.5-kDa MBP were no different between the affected and unaffected, the frequency of X2MBP-specific TCLs correlated with disease.",

            "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is widely accepted as an autoimmune disease, and although myelin basic protein (MBP) is a candidate autoantigen, investigation of T cell responses to the 18.5-kDa isoform of MBP has not identified an epitope which is consistently recognized with higher frequency in all MS patients compared to controls (Chou et al., 1989; Richert et al., 1989; Martin et al., 1990 Martin et al., , 1992 Ota et al., 1990; Pette et al., 1990) . In the study of a more genetically homogeneous population, a multiplex family with MS, an epitope within the 18.5-kDa MBP isoform was also not recognized by T cell lines (TCLs) more frequently in affected siblings compared to unaffected siblings (Voskuhl et al., 1993a) . Previous characterization of Correspondence to: R.R. Voskuhl, Neuroimmunology Branch, National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, National Institutes of Health, Building 10, Room 5B-16, Bethesda, MD 20892, USA. immune responses to MBP have focused on the 18.5-kDa isoform, although four isoforms of MBP have been described in humans. The molecular weights are 21.5 kDa, 20.2 kDa, 18.5 kDa, and 17.3 kDa (Roth et al., 1987) with the healthy adult human CNS composed primarily of the 18.5-kDa isoform. The 18.5-kDa isoform is encoded by exons 1 and 3 through 7, with a splicing out of exon 2 (Fig. 1 ). We have previously described CD4 +, HLA class II-restricted T lymphocytes specific for a protein encoded by exon 2 of MBP (Voskuhl et al., 1993b) . Exon 2 containing isoforms, 21.5 kDa and 20.2 kDa, are thought to be expressed early in fetal CNS development in both the human (Roth et al., 1987; Kamholtz et al., 1988) and mouse (Newman et al., 1987; Jordan et al., 1989) . Exon 2 containing transcripts have also been found in relatively increased amounts during remyelination subsequent to MHV-A59 coronavirus mediated demyelination in C57BL/6N mice (Kristensson et al., 1986; Jordan et al., 1990) . Since MBP isoforms expressed during remyelination may parallel those expressed during developmental myelination, we postulated that exon 2 encoded protein might be expressed in the adult human CNS during remyelination. Since remyelination occurs at the edge of MS plaques (Prineas and Connell, 1979; Raine and Scheinberg, 1988) , T lymphocyte reactivity specific for X2MBP could contribute to the pathogenesis of chronic progressive MS. This report compares the frequencies of X2MBP-specific T lymphocytes derived from the peripheral blood of MS patients and controls. In experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model resembling MS, each inbred animal's major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genotype confers susceptibility to disease as well as determining which epitope induces a T cell response (Fritz and McFarlin, 1989) . Thus, a potential difficulty in identifying disease specific differences in T cell responses to myelin antigens lies in the genetic heterogeneity of human population studies (Voskuhl et al., 1993a) . In order to study a more genetically homogeneous human population, we focused our study on members of a multiplex family with MS. Three family members were studied including one with more advanced secondary chronic progressive MS, one with mild relapsing remitting MS, and one unaffected. An unrelated healthy control that was age, sex, and HLA matched with the advanced secondary CP MS patient was also studied.",

Based upon the frequency of TCLs specific for each region within the 18.5-kDa MBP isoform (Table 3 ), an epitope, or epitopes, within the 26 amino acid sequence encoded by exon 2 elicited a T cell response as marked as that of immunodominant epitopes within each region of the 18.5-kDa isoform (Fig. 5 ). In addition, as has been demonstrated for 18.5-kDa MBP-specific TCLs (Martin et al., 1990; Voskuhl et al., 1993a) , X2MBP-specific TCLs have been shown to be CD4 +, HLA class II restricted and capable of cytotoxicity (Voskuhl et al., 1993b) , thereby demonstrating features characteristic of encephalitogenic MBP-specific T cells which mediate EAE (Powell et al., 1990) . Thus, the list of candidate autoantigens in demyelinating/remyelinating autoimmune diseases should be extended beyond assessing T cell reactivity to only the major isoforms of myelin proteins (MBP, PLP, MAG, etc.) . T cell reactivity directed toward epitopes unique to isoforms expressed aberrantly during a disease process should also be considered, with X2MBP a leading candidate. In this regard it is of interest that T lymphocytes specific for the gamma subunit of the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) have been detected in patients with myasthenia gravis, since expression of gamma subunit containing AChR is regulated developmentally, occurring primarily in embryonic and also in denervated muscle (Protti et al., 1991) .",

In order to minimize genetic diversity encountered when studying unrelated patients, members of a multiplex family with MS were studied in an attempt to identifiy disease-specific differences in a more restricted MBP response. The frequency of X2MBP-specific TCLs in the more advanced secondary CP patient was significantly higher than the frequency observed in her healthy brother (P < 0.0001), as well as in her mother with mild RR disease (P < 0.001) ( Table  2 ). Since the secondary CP MS patient did not have the same HLA type as her brother (NL-sib) or her mother (MS-RR), the increased X2MBP-specific response may have been due to HLA differences, as opposed to disease related differences. Therefore, we assessed X2MBP-specific and 18.5-kDa MBP-specific frequencies in an age, sex, and HLA matched healthy control. Class II loci of HLA were chosen for matching since X2MBP-specific and 18.5-kDa MBP-specific TCLs had been previously shown to be CD4 + and HLA class II restricted (Martin et al., 1990; Voskuhl et al., 1993b) . In comparing the more advanced CP MS patient with her matched control, the difference in X2MBP-specific reactivity was even greater, P < 0.00001. These significant differences in X2MBP responsiveness were very specific for X2MBP and not merely a component of a more generalized difference in immune regulation since no significant difference in reactivity to 18.5-kDa MBP was observed. Thus, within this family the increased T cell response to X2MBP was found in the patient with greatest disability by EDSS (Table 1) , and the greatest disease burden by MRI (Fig. 2 ).",

Remyelination commonly occurs at the edge of MS plaques (Prineas and Connell, 1979; Raine and Scheinberg, 1988) , and since MS plaques tend to accumulate in patients with more advanced secondary CP disease, multiple plaques provide multiple foci for remyelination. Since X2MBP expression occurs with myelin formation (Roth et al., 1987; Kamholtz et al., 1988; Kristensson et al., 1986) , patients with advanced disease presumably have a higher level of X2MBP expression. X2MBP in areas of remyelination may then serve to drive an ongoing immune response. A cycle of immune mediated demyelination, subsequent remyelination and X2MBP expression, with further immune mediated demyelination may occur in secondary CP MS patients. Thus, the immune response to X2MBP may contribute to the progression of disease in MS from a mild RR pattern to a more advanced secondary CP pattern.",

In this regard, it is interesting that the the healthy member of the multiplex family, had an, albeit less dramatic but still significantly increased (P < 0.001), response to X2MBP compared to that of the unrelated healthy control. Disease suscepti-bility is known to be higher in first degree relatives of MS patients (McFarland et al., 1985; Doolittle et al., 1990 ) which may be due in part to the coinheritance of susceptible immune response genes, the HLA gene on chromosome #6 and T cell receptor genes on chromosomes #7 and #14 (reviewed in McFarlin and Lachman, 1989) . Most recently, polymorphic differences in the region 5' to exon 1 of the MBP gene, #18, have been shown to confer an additional risk for disease susceptibility by both association and linkage analysis (Boylan et al., 1990; Tienari et al., 1992) . Although the functional significance of polymorphic differences in the region 5' to exon 1 remains to be established, one could hypothesize that elevated X2MBP-specific responsiveness might reflect inheritance of not only susceptible immune response genes, but also an MBP gene which resulted in altered MBP expression. In this setting of genetic susceptibility, if an initiating event were to induce disease, X2MBP-specific T cells might play a role in disease progression.",
