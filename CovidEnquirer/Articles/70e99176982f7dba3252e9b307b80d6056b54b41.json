            "text": "Mice infected with the neurotropic JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV-JHM) develop a demyelinating encephalomyelitis several weeks after infection. Astrogliosis and infiltration of inflammatory cells are prominent findings in the brains and spinal cords of infected mice. In this report, astrocytes in infected spinal cords were analyzed for expression of three pleiotropic cytokines, TNF-a, IL-1b, and IL-6; Type 2 nitric oxide synthase (iNOS); and MHC class I and II antigen. The data show that all three cytokines and iNOS are expressed by astrocytes in chronically infected spinal cords. These activated astrocytes are localized to areas of virus infection and demyelination, although most of the astrocytes expressing these proteins are not MHV-infected. MHC class I and II antigen can be detected in these spinal cords as well, but not in cells with the typical morphology of astrocytes. TNF-a, IL-6, and iNOS are also evident in the brains of mice with MHV-induced acute encephalitis, but in marked contrast to the results obtained with the chronically infected mice, most of the cells expressing these cytokines or iNOS had the morphology of macrophages or other mononuclear cells and very few appeared to be astrocytes. Additionally, astrocytes and, most likely, oligodendrocytes are infected in the spinal cords of mice with chronic demyelination. These results are consistent with a role for both viral infection of glial cells and high localized levels of proinflammatory cytokines and nitric oxide in the demyelinating process in mice infected with MHV-JHM. They also show that analogously to the human demyelinating disease, multiple sclerosis, astrocytes are a major cellular source for these cytokines in mice with chronic, but not acute disease. \u1b67",

Cytokine production by astrocytes may be a general feature of chronic viral infections since al., 1991; Bo et al., 1994a) . TNF-a and IL-1, but not IL-6, can be detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients such production by astrocytes has also been documented at autopsy in patients with subacute sclerosing with MS and MHC class II expression is upregulated in the CNS of both diseased humans and mice (Hauser et panencephalitis (Nagano et al., 1994) . The basis for the predominant synthesis of cytokines by astrocytes and al., 1990). In MS, MHC class II is only rarely, if ever, seen on reactive astrocytes (Bo et al., 1994b) and in our study, not macrophages in chronically infected mice remains to be determined. However, expression of TNF-a and no expression of either MHC class I or II antigen could be detected on cells with the typical morphology of nitric oxide by astrocytes located adjacent to demyelinating lesions might contribute to the process of demyelin-astrocytes (compare Figs. 1C, 1G, and 1H). A caveat to ation since both independently are toxic for oligodendro-our experiments is that astrocytes may express MHC cytes (Selmaj and Raine, 1988; Merrill et al., 1993) .

Our fected in the CNS of mice with chronic demyelination, data are consistent with a recent report in which the although they did not account for the majority of infected constitutive expression of MHC class I antigen by cells in the brain or the white astrocytes was inhibited in cultures persistently infected or gray matter of the spinal cord.
