A secondary data analysis is conducted using the Health Information National Trends Survey (HINTS) of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Findings reveal that people who are more likely to choose the library are, compared to their Internet counterparts, people who lack online experience, are distrustful of online cancer information, and are more aware of cancer sources. However, they are not necessarily more adept cancer information seekers and do not have a greater expectation of getting quality information from the library. These findings suggest how the library plays its role as an information source for cancer information consumers in the e-health environment. Implications of the findings are discussed in a way that libraries could invest their efforts to reduce the digital health divide and to advance consumer health information literacy.",

Selecting relevant and trustworthy information has become a great challenge for them to make informed decisions. In this regard, libraries are expected to serve as filters that select, organize, and disseminate quality health information (Chobot, 2004 ). Yet another attribute pertains to librarians' role as educators or information brokers. Cancer information is produced, often fragmented, by a variety of sources, and the obtained information can often be difficult to interpret. As intermediaries between information and its consumers, librarians can lower the barriers to cancer information by providing effectively organized information packages and by delivering health information literacy programs to the public (Borman & McKenzie, 2005; Chobot, 2004; Deering & Harris, 1996; Dervin, 2005; Plutchak, 2005; Mays, 2005) .

A serious illness or other health condition were among the top personal problems that Americans face in their everyday lives and that brought them to the library (Estabrook, Witt, & Rainie, 2007) . Deering and Harris (1996) claimed that over 60% of the participants in their focus group interviews reported the library as their preferred source of health information. In a national random sample survey of library use commissioned by the American Library Association (2006), 12% of the total respondents reported that health-related topics were the first or second most popular reason for using their public library (N = 1003).

Such challenges could result in negative consequences, such as uncertainty, information overload, and frustrations, even for individuals who are highly literate (Nielsen-Bohlman et al., 2004; Parker & Kreps, 2005) . Thus, libraries could lower the barriers and enhance accessibility to health information by providing more effectively organized information packages and by delivering consumer health information literacy programs (Borman & McKenzie, 2005; Chobot, 2004) . In a nutshell, the three enduring and unique roles of the library make it a promising partner in the consumer health information system.

Where would you go first?\" The former asks about the actual source used in the past, whereas the latter relates to a future intention to choose a particular source. Because there is a considerable gap between actual behavior and intention to perform the behavior (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975) , the former item was selected to identify the characteristics of people who actually used a library as their primary cancer information source. 2 The jackknife variance estimation technique is the standard operating procedure for variance estimation for the HINTS survey in order to generate statistically sound, nationally representative estimators from the collected data. It takes selected subsets of the data for each \"replicate\" and determines a sampling weight for each respondent in the replicate subset as if the replicate subsets were the sample. The resulting weights are called replicate weights. This procedure is necessary to adjust the risk of committing Type I errors because of underestimation of standard errors caused by the multistage sampling design. Consequently, this procedure helps to produce statistically valid standard errors for sampling estimators (Davis & Moser, 2005) .",

In addition, the measure does not take into account the fact that the library is a comprehensive information center that provides various information sources, including the Internet. Asking respondents to select one source may lead to a certain level of imprecision in measurement because a person who used the Internet in the library could answer either \"library\" or \"Internet.\" Similarly, a person who used the Internet at home to access library resources could also answer in either way. The measure may leave some ambiguity in the findings although it is a validated measure in a standardized survey instrument and is often used in the source selection literature. 4 Nonetheless, it is important to understand the reasons certain groups of people chose a particular source first over other sources. Some people access a certain source first because of its accessibility, while others choose one because of its ease of use, or quality. While certain groups of people choose libraries due to one of the above reasons, others choose libraries due to a lack of other options. Because of these reasons, research about the first source is important in identifying the unique profile of citizens whose primary cancer information source is the library regardless of the kinds of resources they use in the library. The unique attributes of the HINTS source selection measure discussed above should be taken into consideration when interpreting the findings of this study.

The findings of this study would provide general suggestions for the overall library community rather than offering suggestions for a specific type of library.

For small public libraries that do not have sufficient resources, library communities at large could further their collaborative efforts in building networks of consumer health information services. For example, the National Network of Libraries of Medicine's (NN/LM's) directory of consumer health information is a national database that lists consumer health information services provided by all types of libraries, including public, academic, and hospital libraries (National Network of Libraries of Medicine, 2008).

(2000) , most public libraries did not set health information services as their primary focus. Some librarians appeared apprehensive about providing health information to their patrons because such a service deals with sensitive issues and risks of intrusion in patron privacy, not to mention responsibility for error with grave health-related consequences for patrons. In a more recent study conducted immediately after the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Toronto in 2003, Harris, Wathen, and Chan (2005) reported problems in the readiness of public libraries in providing adequate reference services to health-related inquiries in the midst of the crisis.",

If approximately three in four people in the Library group would not want to make the same choice again, the cancer information services the respondents experienced at the library may not have met their expectations.

Johnson et al. (2006) noted, \"the relative role of libraries is often ignored in research in health information seeking\" (p. 579). The present study responded to this lament by examining the use of the library as an information source in a much broader consumer health information seeking context, by analyzing the NCI's HINTS data collected from a representative sample of the general U.S. population.

However, the other two roles were not associated with library seeking. There was little evidence that people select the library as a quality information source or as a helpful intermediary lowering barriers to their cancer information seeking. To be perceived as a source that actually performs all three anticipated roles claimed in the literature, libraries should invest in further developing their image as a well-packaged, trustworthy consumer health information source and in advancing health information literacy.
