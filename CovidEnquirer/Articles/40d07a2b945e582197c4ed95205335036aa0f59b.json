            "text": "D entists perform complex procedures routinely in the oral cavity. However, certain adverse conditions or potential complications are inherent to this part of the anatomy. They include continual salivary flow, a relatively dark environment in which shadowing is common, adjacent soft tissues in close proximity to the treatment site, open access to the patient's airway and the patient's difficulty in maintaining an open mouth. The use of a dental dam and rubber bite block is a common method of controlling some of these conditions. Aerosol and spatter production during dental procedures in the oral cavity-including hard-tissue preparation with a high-speed dental handpiece and an ultrasonic scaler-has been well documented in the literature. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] This aerosol and spatter might contain infectious agents originating from the patient or the dental unit waterlines that pose a health threat to the dentist, patient and staff members who are within the spray's pattern. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Miller 1 reported that aerosols generated from a patient's mouth can contain up to 100,000 bacteria per cubic foot of air. Although the aerosol (particles of respirable size < 10 micrometers) may remain airborne for extended periods, the large-particle spatter, which makes up the bulk of the spray from handpieces and ultrasonic scalers, settles quickly, landing on nearby surfaces. This pattern can encompass the area occupied by the dentist and dental team members during routine dental treatment. 12, 13 In their review of the literature, Harrel and Molinari 7 indicated that diseases such as tuberculosis, influenza, legionnaires' disease and severe acute respiratory syndrome are transmissible via droplets or aerosols. Therefore, a reduction of aerosol and spatter generated under normal dental operative conditions may lead to a decrease in the potential for transmission of communicable diseases from patient to dentist and dental staff members. Cochran and colleagues 14 reported the effectiveness of a dental dam in reducing microbial contamination during dental procedures. In addition, several researchers have reported that use of a highvolume evacuator (HVE) can reduce the aerosol and spatter production arising from the dental procedural site by more than 90 percent. 2, [15] [16] [17] [18] We conducted this study to compare the effectiveness of two dry-field isolation techniquesthe Isolite system (Isolite Systems, Santa Barbara, Calif.) and a dental dam with bite block and concurrent use of an HVE-with that of HVE alone (control) to reduce spatter from a dental operative site. Our null hypothesis was that the dry-field techniques would not result in a significant reduction of spatter compared with the control technique.",

Specifically, the Isolite system allows for shadowless illumination, isolation, high-speed evacuation, protection of adjacent soft tissues, assistance in opening the mouth and protection from accidental ingestion or aspiration of foreign objects. In addition, in our experience, the device is easy to place and ideal for preparing teeth for fixed prosthodontics, as well as for other situations in which use of a dental dam would hinder access. To use the system, the dentist or a team member connects the HVE of the dental unit to the Isolite device itself. Generally, this results in no need for additional high-volume evacuation in the operative site.",

We also wanted to determine whether tooth position within the quadrant affected the amount of spatter that was produced. Our data show that the amount increased as we moved mesially from tooth no. 18 to 19 and then to 20. However, the only statistically significant increase occurred in moving from tooth no. 18 to tooth no. 20. This increase can be explained by the fact that the source of the water spray (that is, the handpiece) is positioned closer to the oral aperture for tooth no. 20, and water would be more likely to escape from the mouth than to adhere to the adjacent oral tissue, the dental dam or the Isolite mouthpiece.",

We believe this is due to the design of the Isolite system. The unit has two suction ports whose orifices are located at the junction of the suction unit and the mouthpiece. Suction currents and pooled water suction are aided by perforations along the superior and inferior edges of the mouthpiece. It seems logical to us that the greatest evacuation strength would be toward the most posterior aspect of the unit. This is evidenced by the Isolite system's comparable performance for molars in this study.
