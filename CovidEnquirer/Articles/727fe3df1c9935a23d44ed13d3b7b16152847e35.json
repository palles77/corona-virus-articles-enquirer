Objectives: The objectives were to describe and analyze the impact of 2 major crises (the severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] outbreak, and the electrical system failure [''blackout'']) on pharmacy practice and pharmacists in Toronto, Canada. Methods: An exploratory, qualitative study was undertaken. Pharmacists were recruited, provided informed consent, and were interviewed. Data from transcripts were coded and categorized to identify themes related to adaptive strategies undertaken by pharmacists during times of civil crisis. Results: Five key themes emerged from this research: (1) during times of crisis, pharmacies become frontline health care facilities, (2) a vacuity of leadership/lack of utility of emergency preparedness guidelines and policies, (3) role of and reliance on experience and professional judgment, (4) importance of documentation, and (5) the importance of ''teamness'' in enabling successful adaptation during times of crisis.",

            "text": "Since the events of September 11, 2001 there has been an urgent need for all citizens to be adequately prepared for civil disasters or crises. 1 Emergency preparedness, once the purview of elite teams of health care professionals or highly skilled individuals such as paramedics or firefighters, has now become an everyday preoccupation. 2 A fundamental premise of such emergency preparedness that has now emerged is the understanding that ''rescue'' or relief will likely not come immediately and that individuals must, to a large degree, fend for themselves during the initial aftermath of any major catastrophic situation. 3, 4 Health professionals, in general, may be somewhat more comfortable than most in dealing with or providing leadership during emergency situations, given the independent nature of health care work itself. 5,6 However, few health care professionals are prepared for the breakdown of the civilian infrastructure that supports their day-to-day practice. 7-11 For example, prolonged absence of electricity (and commensurate problems with use of refrigerators or computers), potable water, and supplies and other events that may commonly occur during a natural or human-made disaster will fundamentally affect the way in which health care may be provided to patients. Of course, during such times of civil crisis, the general population's need for health care services may also be expected to rise significantly. 2, 7 Within the profession of pharmacy, there has been some literature published related to disaster preparedness. In general, this consists of hypothetical legal-ethical debates or discussion, or policy documents published by professional or regulatory associations designed to provide pharmacists with guidelines for responding during times of civil crisis. [12] [13] [14] [15] Of interest, there are few published reports outlining the real-world response of pharmacists during times of disaster. Teeter 12 commented on the application of the Comprehensive Emergency Management model within the community pharmacy context, noting that ''.only a few organizations.have made emergency management a priority,'' and that ''pharmacists.have little time available to devoted to preparing for disasters and terrorism.'' Pedersen et al 16 reported on results of a survey to identify pharmacists' opinions regarding their level of involvement in emergency preparedness, and noted that those who have previously been involved in emergency training or emergency situations place a higher premium on preparedness.",

Importantly, the disease was first isolated within health care institutions, and consequently some of those who died were health care professionals such as nurses and physicians. At its peak, the SARS crisis resulted in the World Health Organization (WHO) issuing a major travel advisory cautioning international visitors about visiting the city of Toronto, Canada. As Canada is a First World country priding itself upon its health care and civic infrastructure, the WHO directive was unprecedenteddand reasonable given the lack of understanding of how the illness was spreading and what its implications may be.",

Analysis proceeded using a method described by Chi 21 for coding and categorization of qualitative data. Briefly, this method involved the use of interative analysis of a random sample representing approximately 10% of the data by 2 independent reviewers until agreement on a coding structure was achieved. Once an agreed-upon coding structure had been developed, 2 independent reviewers analyzed another sample of data representing approximately 10% of the data using the coding structure. Where disagreements in coding occurred, a third reviewer was available to adjudicate differences. On the basis of this analysis, revisions to the original coding structure were undertaken to allow for development of a final coding tree. All remaining transcripts (representing approximately 80% of the data) were subsequently read and reviewed by 2 independent investigators; where disagreements in coding occurred, a third researcher was available to adjudicate, using the agreed-upon coding structure. In this way, reliability of analysis is strengthened while minimizing the number of different reviewers required to analyze data. This method of analysis has been used to interpret data collected from a variety of different data-gathering methods, including focus groups and interviews. Data were managed and stored using the software program Knowledge Forum v3 (University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada).",
