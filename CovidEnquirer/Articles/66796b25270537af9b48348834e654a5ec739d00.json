It was not until 2003 when this family of viruses attracted attention due to the discovery of a new virus that caused the pandemic severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [2, 3] . Later on, two additional novel coronaviruses, NL63 and HKU1, were identified in 2004 and 2005 [4, 5] . These two viruses cause respiratory tract infections and they are widely spread within the human population [4] . Thus, thee four known human coronaviruses, 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1, cause mild to moderate upper-respiratory tract illness without significant morbidity.",

In addition, two cases were reported by France. The first case became ill after a 9-day vacation to Dubai, UAE. The second case, reported on 12 May, is a patient who shared a room at a health care facility with the first case [13] . In Tunisia, there were two laboratory confirmed cases, a brother and a sister, who are thought to have caught the virus from their father, who became ill three days after returning from a visit to Qatar and Saudi Arabia and died on 10 May [14] . Countries with reported cases are Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates.

In a recent publication from Saudi Arabia, four patients' members of an extended family had a total of 28 persons living in the extended household, with frequent contact and more often between husbands and wives and their children. None of the family members apart from the four patients and none of 124 health care workers who had contact with the patients developed respiratory symptoms or illness [10] . The data indicates a clear evidence of limited, non-sustained, human-to-human transmission. The exact route of transmission is not clear, but the most likely modes of transmission include droplet and contact transmission. But further studies are required to better understand the risks. When caring for patients with suspected or confirmed cases of MERS-CoV, the following recommendations for infection control measures in hospital settings include: standard precautions, droplet precautions (wearing a medical mask when in close contact (within 1 m) and upon entering the room or cubicle of the patient); and performing hand hygiene in accordance with the World Health Organization's (WHO) 5 moments of hand hygiene. Additional measures include wearing a particulate respirator when performing aerosol-generating procedures in addition to other precautions as outlined by WHO document [19] . A recent publication of MERS-CoV outbreak in healthcare setting, there was evidence of person-to-person transmission and the outbreak was aborted by the implementation of basic infection control measures [12] . The center for Disease Control and prevention, United States, recommends the placement of the patient in an Airborne Infection Isolation Room (AIIR) [20] .",
