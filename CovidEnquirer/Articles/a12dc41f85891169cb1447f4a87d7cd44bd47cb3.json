            "text": "The litany of the viruses described in the previous chapters of this volume makes clear that humans have been subjected to a large number of viral diseases throughout our history. Some of these viruses evolved along with humans and have been present since the earliest human walked the earth. Such viruses include the various herpesviruses, for example, which were present as human pathogens at the time that humans first appeared. Others have been acquired from zoonotic sources. These are animal viruses that have acquired the ability to infect humans. Upon jumping from their animal sources to humans, some of these viruses became human viruses that infect only humans, and humans became the vertebrate reservoir of this new virus. Such viruses include measles, described in Chapter 4, and the dengue viruses, described in Chapter 3 and in this chapter. Many of these viruses entered the human population long ago. Arguments were presented in Chapter 4 that measles virus could not have existed as a human virus until perhaps 5000 years ago when the human population first reached the numbers required to sustain the virus in the population, and that this virus probably jumped from cattle to humans after humans domesticated these animals. Others have entered the human population more recently. The four serotypes of dengue virus, for example, appeared to have jumped independently from monkeys to humans between 200 and 1000 years ago, and HIV was established as a human virus within the last 50-100 years. Other zoonotic viruses that infect humans do so only peripherally and humans do not serve as the vertebrate reservoir of these viruses. Examples are West Nile virus, Eastern equine encephalitis virus, Ebola virus, and rabies virus.",

Some, like HIV, became human viruses while others, like influenza virus, remain zoonotic viruses. There is growing concern that viruses to date have caused small epidemics in humans but may acquire the ability to cause very large epidemics. In this chapter we will consider a number of viruses that are known to have caused epidemics in humans only within the last century, or that have the potential to cause wide-ranging epidemics in the future, or that are undergoing dramatic range expansion at present.",

Although these viruses can cause serious illnesses in humans, they usually cause little or no illness in bats. The recent emergence of bat viruses as human pathogens may seem strange because so many viruses are now known to come from bats, but in fact bats form a sizable proportion of the diversity of mammals. More than 900 species are currently recognized and these constitute more than 20% of all mammalian species. Furthermore, bats are intensely social creatures that are ideally suited to pass viruses back and forth among large populations. Humans impinge more and more into the habitats of bats, and this, as well as disruptions of bat colonies caused by humans, has led to more contact between bats and humans or their domestic animals. Furthermore, in many areas of the world bats are used as food or for medicinal purposes, resulting in human-bat contacts.",

Megachiroptera are mostly large, fruit-eating bats that are classified in a single family, Pteropodidae. There are about 170 species distributed throughout the tropics of the Old World. They find their food, consisting of fruits, flowers, and pollen, using eyesight and an excellent sense of smell. Of these, more than a third, 65, belong to the genus Pteropus and are called flying foxes. The Pteropus flying foxes are found from Australia across southern Asia and India to Madagascar (Fig. 8.1 ). They weigh from 300 grams to more than a kilogram and have a wingspan of 0.6 to 1.7 meters. Microchiroptera are in general smaller and most eat insects. They are virtually worldwide in distribution. They have evolved echolocation to navigate and find their prey in the dark. Bats play an important role in the ecology of the planet, dispersing seeds, pollinating plants, and reducing the number of night flying insects such as mosquitoes.",

In fact, in the United States over the last few years the majority of human cases of rabies have been bat-associated rabies.

The first horse to become ill was a pregnant mare that was pastured in a field, which was then moved into a stable with 23 other thoroughbreds. The disease spread among the horses in this stable and to an adjoining stable and ultimately 17 horses became ill, of which 13 died. Of the four horses that survived, two were left with mild neurological sequelae. Three other horses were infected but did not suffer symptoms. Two humans that nursed the horses became ill with a severe respiratory disease, of whom one died of respiratory and kidney failure. Spread of the disease required close contact, and imposition of quarantine measures contained the outbreak. A previously unknown virus was isolated from the sick animals that was found to be a paramyxovirus and it was initially named equine morbillivirus. Sequencing of the genome showed that it was not closely related to the morbilliviruses; however, and the virus was assigned to a new genus called Megamyxovirus because of the large size of the genome. Subsequent studies established that the virus was a bat virus and widespread in flying foxes in eastern Australia. The virus was renamed Hendra virus after the Brisbane suburb where the outbreak occurred and the genus was renamed Henipavirus. Analysis of sera from healthy humans and horses in the area failed to detect the presence of antibody, and analysis of more than 5000 sera from a variety of wild animals trapped in the areas also failed to detect antibody in any animal other than flying foxes. Flying foxes can be readily infected experimentally with the virus but do not suffer illness upon infection.",

However, in October of 1995 the owner suffered a relapse and died of encephalitis. At this point an investigation showed that Hendra virus was to blame for the illness of the horses and the death of the owner. In January 1999, a fatal case of Hendra infection occurred in a horse near Cairns, Australia, and in 2004 a horse died of Hendra infection in Townsville.

From September 1998 to April 1999, an outbreak of 258 cases of human encephalitis occurred in Malaysia and Singapore that had a 40% mortality rate. Clinical symptoms included fever, headache, myalgia (muscle aches), drowsiness, and disorientation that sometimes progressed to coma within 48 hours. The disease was associated with an outbreak of respiratory disease in pigs with or without neurological symptoms, and humans infected with the disease were pig farmers or others closely associated with pig farming. It was first thought that the outbreak was due to infection by Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus (see Chapter 3 on the importance of pigs as amplifying hosts for this virus) and the Malaysian government vaccinated 2.4 million pigs against JE virus. When this did not slow the epidemic, 1.1 million pigs were culled in an attempt to reduce the incidence of disease. In March 1999, with the assistance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the virus responsible for the epidemic was identified as a Hendra-like virus, a virus related to but distinct from Hendra virus. Retrospective studies suggested that the virus had been responsible for disease in pigs in Malaysia for several years and it seems clear that the human cases were contracted from pigs. There is no evidence for human-tohuman transmission in this outbreak. The virus responsible has been called Nipah virus, after the village in Malaysia where the disease first appeared, and it is classified as a second member of the genus Henipavirus (which gets its name from Hendra and Nipah viruses).",

There, half-eaten fruit or regurgitated fruit that was contaminated with virus-containing saliva from the bats could be eaten by pigs, causing them to become infected.",

No evidence for the intermediate infection of an animal, as occurred in the Malaysian epidemic, has been seen in these epidemics. Furthermore, in the 2004 epidemic evidence was obtained that person-to-person transmission of the virus had occurred. It is likely that the disease was transmitted directly from bats to humans, possibly by human consumption of partially eaten fruit that was contaminated with bat saliva containing the virus, followed by person-to-person transmission. It is known in Bangladesh, for example, that during the fruiting season young boys climb trees to pick fruit. If this fruit was partially eaten by bats, the fruit could be contaminated with the virus from the bat. The fatality rate in these epidemics was as high as 75%. In nearby India, an epidemic of Nipah occurred in 2001. Flying foxes are widely distributed throughout this area ( Fig. 8 .1) and Nipah virus has been isolated from them in both Malaysia and Bangladash.

Field studies have found that 30-70% of bats belonging to this genus have been infected by the virus. In the autumn of 2002 an epidemic of SARS in humans began in Guangdong Province in China. The disease is an atypical pneumonia characterized by high fever, myalgia, and lymphopenia (smaller numbers of lymphocytes). By February of 2003 there were 305 cases with five deaths. The infection was then spread to other areas by a Chinese doctor who had been treating patients in Guangdong. He traveled to Hong Kong on 21 February 2003 and while staying in a hotel he developed symptoms of SARS and died shortly thereafter. Ten guests at the hotel who were housed on the same floor or nearby floors became infected and before developing symptoms traveled to Singapore, Vietnam, Canada, and the United States, spreading the epidemic. The epidemic also spread independently to Beijing in April of 2003. The epidemic finally waned in the summer of 2003 when the World Health Organization reported the cumulative total of 8098 probable cases of SARS with 774 deaths worldwide in 29 countries ( Fig. 8 .2).

Infection by the bat virus or the civet virus appears to cause only mild illness. As stated before, merchants who were infected did not develop illness, and some persons who work with wildlife were found to be seropositive for SARS but suffered no illness. However, several changes are present in the virulent SARS virus isolated from humans. There is a deletion of 29 nucleotides upstream of the start codon for the N protein and there are four amino acid changes in the spike protein. It is believed that the crucial changes are two amino acid changes in the spike protein that allow the virus to bind to the human receptor called ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) 1000-fold more avidly than does the civet strain or the bat strain. This is perhaps the reason why the virus has not to date reappeared in the human population, together with extensive culling of animals in the food markets in China. If occasional human cases occur they are likely to be mild unless the virus has the opportunity to mutate in humans to form the virulent strain of the virus. However, this did happen in 2002 and may happen again in the future. There is need to develop vaccines or antiviral treatments for the virus, as well as to maintain the Chinese food markets in a way that does not encourage the spread of the virus.",

In view of the fact that to become virulent the virus must mutate to bind more strongly to the human form of the ACE2 protein, it is interesting that there is a second receptor for SARS virus, the protein called CD209L or L-SIGN. Why this second receptor cannot compensate for the failure of unmodified SARS to infect humans efficiently is unknown. It may be significant that another human coronavirus, NL63, only recently discovered, also uses ACE2 as its receptor.

Twenty-five laboratory workers were infected and six secondary cases resulted; of these 31 infected people, 7 died. The monkeys in the shipment, which originated in Uganda, also died. Subsequent studies with the virus isolated during the outbreak showed that it caused lethal illness in African green monkeys following experimental infection.

She contracted Ebola but survived, and a new strain of Ebola was isolated from her blood. Then, in May 1995, there was an epidemic in Kikwit, Zaire, that resulted in at least 315 cases with >75% mortality. This was followed by several deaths in western Africa that resulted from consumption of a monkey that had died of Ebola. Then there was a prolonged series of smaller outbreaks in Gabon from 1995 through 1997. In 2000, Ebola appeared in Uganda for the first time and caused an epidemic of more than 425 cases. There have been further outbreaks in 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005 in various countries including Gabon, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Sudan. A map showing these various filoviral outbreaks is shown in Fig. 8 Peters and Khan (1999) , and news bulletins from the World Health Organization (2005) at: http://www.who.int/disease-outbreak-news/. Note that in recent years, outbreaks of Ebola disease have occurred almost annually in the center of the range, particularly in Gabon and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Again, perhaps consumption of partially eaten fruit is to blame. The recent large die-offs of apes and chimpanzees in some areas together with the increasing frequency of human infection indicates that the virus is spreading more widely. Whether this is due to a new strain of virus that is more easily spread to humans and nonhuman primates, or to the recent introduction of the virus from a source outside the areas now experiencing epidemics, or to human alterations of the environment leading to more contact between humans and nonhuman primates with the bats that carry the virus is not known.",

This epidemic occurred in Reston, Virginia, near Washington, D.C., in 1989. The deaths were at first attributed to simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), but investigation by the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that both SHFV and Ebola virus were present in the monkeys. Believing that the community was at risk for Ebola, made even the more alarming because the epidemic was occurring in the neighborhood of the central government of the United States, the army team quickly decided to euthanize the monkeys and decontaminate the facility. Follow-up studies showed that four animal handlers at the facility had been infected by the virus but had suffered no illness. Thus the strain of Ebola present in the Reston monkeys, called Reston ebolavirus, seems to be nonpathogenic for humans although it remains pathogenic for monkeys. The story of the Reston incident was recounted in a book called The Hot Zone by Richard Preston. Since this first epidemic of Reston ebolavirus, a new outbreak has occurred in Reston, two outbreaks have occurred in an animal facility in Alice, Texas, and an outbreak took place in Sienna, Italy. All outbreaks occurred in monkeys imported from the Philippines and it seems probable that the virus is native to the Philippines. No serious illness in humans has occurred in any of these outbreaks. Nucleotide sequencing has shown that Reston ebolavirus is closely related to the African ebolaviruses. The reason it is attenuated in humans is still unexplained, and high containment is used for studies of Reston ebolavirus in the laboratory.",

Over the next 6 years the virus rapidly spread across the United States and north into Canada as well as south into Central America, northern South America, and the Caribbean. The march of the virus across the United States is illustrated in Figs. 8.4 and 8.5. The rapid spread of this virus into a new ecological area requiring adaptation to new mosquito vectors as well as new vertebrate hosts is extraordinary. In the process, more than 20,000 Americans became ill from WN virus infection and more than 800 died of neurological complications (Fig. 8.6). Figures 8.5 and 8.6 illustrate an interesting and not well understood phenomenon. After the front passes through an area, there are many fewer human cases of disease in the following years. Yet only a minority of humans in any area had been infected and are therefore immune to the virus, and the virus continues to be present.

If so, the resurgence of the crow population and the populations of other amplifying species could lead to renewed outbreaks similar to those that occurred with the first appearance and spread of the virus. One encouraging finding relating to the potential of the virus to cause future epidemics of disease is the appearance of an attenuated variant of WN virus in Texas in 2003. In a mouse model, this variant is attenuated in neurovirulence. The emergence of WN virus was associated with the appearance in Europe and the Middle East of a more virulent strain of virus, perhaps enabling it to spread more easily.

The pandemic of 1918 was especially severe, infecting perhaps 30% of the world's population and causing up to 100 million deaths. These pandemics were associated with the appearance of new subtypes of HA and NA, the surface glycoproteins of the virus, in human adapted viruses. The reservoir of influenza A is birds and the bird viruses must ordinarily undergo adaptation in some way to humans in order to infect and cause epidemic spread. In part this adaptation involves reassortment of flu segments to incorporate human adapted segments. It had been thought that virus circulating in birds will not infect humans and cause disease without prior adaptation, and that only HA subtypes H1, H2, and H3 were compatible with spread in humans. Recently, however, there have been numerous cases of direct human infection by several strains of avian influenza resulting in serious, even fatal, illness involving new subtypes of HA. Three such viruses, H5N1, H7N7, and H9N2 will be considered here.",

These birds undergo seasonal migrations over large distances, and episodes of dead and dying migratory birds have been associated with the appearance of the virus in new areas.

If H5N1 virus should acquire the ability to spread readily from person to person, and if its high lethality for humans should continue unabated, it could cause a devastating pandemic. Efforts are being made to prepare defenses against this virus, including vaccines and antiviral drugs, supported by the U.S. government and other governments. Promising vaccines are being developed and tested in clinical trials, and plans are to stockpile such a vaccine for possible use if an epidemic of this virus arises. This effort is complicated by the fact that H5N1 influenza, like all influenzas, continues to evolve, and stockpiled vaccine might not be completely effective against the strain that ultimately might emerge as a pandemic strain. Nevertheless, there is hope that at least partial immunity might be effected by such a vaccine that could ameliorate the symptoms of the disease and protect against the extreme virulence of the virus. As described in Chapter 4, new approaches to flu vaccine development are being tried, including development of a universal flu vaccine that would work against any influenza A strain, but such an approach will clearly require many more years of research before a licensed vaccine for general use could be produced. Efforts are also being directed toward producing and stockpiling antiviral compounds directed against influenza. Unfortunately, most H5N1 isolates tested are resistant to amantadine and related compounds, antiflu agents that have been in use for years and that are readily available. It is thought that this is the result of the wide use of amantadine by Chinese farmers to protect their chicken flocks from influenza, thereby selecting for amantadine-resistant variants of the viruses. This effect may be moderating, however, as some recent isolates are sensitive to amantadine. Inhibitors of the influenza neuraminidase such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir appear to be reasonably effective against H5N1 virus, but these drugs must be used early in infection if they are to be effective. Production of these compounds is limiting at present, but production is being accelerated in order to stockpile them for possible use if or when a pandemic erupts.",

Forest cycles of dengue have been documented in Africa and Southeast Asia in which the vertebrate reservoir is monkeys and various species of Aedes mosquitoes maintain the virus. Recent sequencing studies have now shown that the sylvatic monkey viruses evolved in monkeys into four serotypes. This evolution from a common ancestor occurred in the African/Southeast Asian region at some time in the distant past. These different dengue viruses then jumped independently into humans to become human dengue viruses. A dendrogram of dengue viruses of monkeys (sylvatic strains) and humans (endemic/epidemic strains) is shown in Fig. 8 .7. Notice, for example, that the monkey dengue-4 virus groups with human dengue-4 but forms a distinct lineage from that of the other dengue viruses. Similarly, monkey dengue-1 and dengue-2 group with the respective human viruses but form distinct lineages. Sequencing of sylvatic dengue-3 has not yet been done but it will presumably group in the same way. From the extent of the divergence in sequences between the monkey viruses and the human viruses, it is estimated that the jump to humans occurred on the order of 200 years ago for DEN-1, 600 years ago for DEN-4, and 1000 years ago for DEN-2. It is further estimated that the African and Malaysian sylvatic viruses diverged about 800 years ago. Such estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty but are probably valid to within a factor of two. Since human dengue virus is an exclusively human virus that is epidemic in nature and induces lifelong immunity, it could not have existed until human populations were large enough to support the continued existence of such a virus. This topic is covered in more detail in Chapter 4 when discussing measles virus, but sufficiently large human populations arose only within the last thousand years or so in the regions in which dengue viruses first arose and flourished.",

Prior to the 1980s, a \"native American\" strain of DEN-2 circulated and there was very little dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) in the Americas. A strain of DEN-3 circulated in the 1960s and 1970s but it then disappeared. DEN-1 was introduced into the Americas in 1977 and DEN-4 in 1981 and these viruses then radiated throughout large regions of the Caribbean and northern South America. The first epidemic of DHF occurred in 1981, but interestingly, it was due to the introduction of a new strain of DEN-2 from Asia. This DEN-2 strain grows more vigorously than the native American strain, which is not associated with DHF, and led to the DHF epidemic. Then in 1994 the Southeast Asian strain of DEN-3 responsible for the DHF epidemic in Sri Lanka described in Chapter 3 reached the Americas. The result of all these introductions has been a dramatic increase in the incidence of DHF and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) in the Americas. Whereas in the 1970s there were very few cases of DHF in the Americas, there were more than 10,000 cases in the 1980s and more than 60,000 cases in the 1990s. Cases have continued to increase in number. In the last 5 years (2001-2005 inclusive) , more than 50,000 cases have been reported that resulted in about 700 deaths.",

It seems probable that humans have become infected with SIVcpz repeatedly but in most cases the virus failed to adapt to humans or failed to become epidemic because of the low transmissibility of the virus. Following a human infection, it may have smoldered in a small number of people but then died out. When the viruses crossed the species barrier and became firmly established in the human population as HIV-1 is not clear. HIV-1 has been isolated from serum collected in 1959 in Zaire and antibodies to HIV have been found in serum collected in 1963 in Burkina Faso, so HIV-1 has been in the human population at least that long. From sequencing studies of the glycoprotein gene and examination of the rate of divergence, one estimate is that the virus might have entered the human population about 70 years ago, although estimates of divergence rates are controversial. Recent changes in human behavior, including more extensive travel by truck, bus, and plane, changes in sexual practices, and the use of injectable drugs, as well as the increase in the human population, could have allowed the virus to reach major population centers and spread more extensively than in the past, becoming epidemic worldwide. The spread of the virus could also have been aided by the appearance of mutants that were more easily transmissible from person to person. The large increase in population during the last century has certainly resulted in more opportunities for the introduction and spread of the virus in humans, and therefore for the selection of such transmissible mutants.",

These include two previously unknown retroviruses, HTLV-3 (PTLV-3) and HTLV-4 (PTLV-4). Thus, infection of humans by simian retroviruses has not been a rare event. A book called The River by Edward Hooper claimed that the HIV epidemic started because an early version of polio vaccine was contaminated by HIV (or its progenitor). No evidence for such contamination exists, and recent analysis of lots of this vaccine that had been stored for 40 years by three different laboratories failed to find any trace of SIV/HIV in the vaccine. Further, given that monkey viruses have repeatedly entered the human population, it is unnecessary to postulate human vaccine activity for the origin of HIV. Rumors based upon this claim, however, have led to suspension of vaccination for polio in some African nations, resulting in a resurgence of poliomyelitis in Africa that has spread to other areas previously free of polio (see Chapter 3).",

The strains of SIVcpz that have been found cluster into two divergent lineages corresponding to the chimp subspecies lineages, and the strain of SIVcpz found in troglodytes was the source of HIV-1. Figure has been adapted from Figure 1 in Sharp et al. (2005). excreta. The first hantavirus to come to medical attention was Hantaan virus which caused more than 3000 cases of hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome in U.S. troops during the Korean War. Since then, many hantaviruses have been identified in both the Old World and in the Americas that cause serious human illness. They are examples of emerging viruses because as the number of humans increases and as they invade more habitat occupied by rodents carrying hantaviruses, the incidence of infection in humans has risen. Very interesting in this regard was the isolation, in May 1993, of a new hantavirus that causes acute respiratory distress in humans that can lead to rapid death, a syndrome now called hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) and originally called acute respiratory disease syndrome (ARDS). The virus was isolated by the CDC in collaboration with local health authorities following an epidemic in the Four Corners area of the southwestern United States that resulted in approximately 25 deaths. The virus is associated with the deer mouse Peromyscus maniculatus. It is thought that the epidemic may have resulted from an abundance of pine nuts in the area during a good growing year, leading the local people to harvest larger amounts of these than usual and store them in their homes when their normal storage areas became full. With abundant food available, the rodent population exploded and invaded homes to get to the pine nuts, and it is thought that this more intimate contact between humans and rodents may have led to the epidemic. The hantavirus responsible for this epidemic is now called Sin Nombre virus, which is Spanish for \"without a name.\" Early suggestions that it be called Four Corners virus or Muerto Canyon virus (after a geographical feature in the area) drew objections from local residents who did not want this major tourist area identified with a fatal disease. Eventually the CDC simply named it Sin Nombre (there is a small creek in the area called the Sin Nombre River that serves as justification for the choice of name).",
