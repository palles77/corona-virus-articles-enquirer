            "text": "A virulent infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), designated as CK/CH/GD/QY16 (referred as QY16), was isolated from a diseased chicken farm in Guangdong province, China, in 2016. The complete genome of the strain was sequenced and analyzed. The results show that the genome of QY16 consists of 27,670 nucleotides, excluding poly (A) tail, and that its genome organization is 5' UTR-1a-1b-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-3' UTR-poly (A) tail. Sequence comparison among QY16 and other IBV strains was conducted and its results demonstrate that the S1 gene of QY16 has the highest nucleotide sequence identity with that of 4/91, and the other part of its genome is highly similar to that of YX10. The results of the phylogenic analysis show that the entire genome of QY16 and most of the QY16 genes are located in the same cluster as those of YX10, except for the S1 gene which is located in the same cluster with that of 4/91. It has been further confirmed by the RDP and SimPlot analysis that QY16 is a recombinant strain deriving from YX10 (as the major parental sequence) and 4/91 (as the minor parental sequence), and that the recombination occurs in a region which includes the 3'-terminal 1b sequence (85 nt) and the 5'-terminal S1 protein gene sequence (1,466 nt). The results of the vaccination-challenge test suggest that QY16 is a nephropathogenic strain of IBV and that the vaccine strains-H120 and 4/91-cannot provide effective protection against it. These results indicate that the continuing evolution of IBV strains by genetic drift and genetic recombination may lead to IBV outbreaks even among the vaccinated chickens in China.",

            "text": "IBV belongs to the genus Coronavirus of the family Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales. Its viral genome consists of a linear, non-segmented, positive-sense, and single-stranded RNA of approximately 27.6 kilobases (kb), The genome of IBV contains 6 genes (gene 1 to 6) and can be transcribed into a nested set of mRNAs (mRNA 1 to 6) by a unique discontinuous transcription mechanism of coronavirus (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1998) . The gene 1 encodes 2 polyproteins-polyprotein 1a (pp 1a) and polyprotein 1ab (pp 1ab), which is an extension of pp 1a by a minus 1 frameshift translation mechanism (Brierley et al., 1987) . The 2 polyproteins can be cleaved by viral proteases into 15 non-structural proteins (nsp) that participate in the genome replication, transcription, and viral infection (Hodgson et al., 2004; Armesto et al., 2009 ). The gene 2 encodes a structural protein spike (S) glycoprotein that can be translated into a precursor spike glycoprotein (S0) and later be cleaved into 2 subunits S1 and S2 by cellular proteases (Cavanagh et al., 1992) . The S1 subunit forms the tip of a spike, whereas the S2 subunit anchors the S1 to the viral membrane. The S1 subunit, with virus neutralizing epitopes and serotype-specific sequences (Cavanagh, 1983; Cavanagh et al., 1986) , plays an important role in viral attachment to host cells and the 3519 induction of neutralizing antibodies (Koch et al., 1990) . The gene 3 encodes nsp 3a and 3b, and a structural protein envelope protein (E), whereas the gene 4 encodes a structural protein membrane glycoprotein (M) and nsp 4b and 4c. The gene 5 encodes nsp 5a and 5b. The M and E are 2 membrane-binding proteins, whereas the 4 nsps (3a, 3b, 5a, and 5b) have been proved to be dispensable for virus replication but affect the efficiency of the replication and immunogenicity of the virus (Hodgson et al., 2006) . The gene 6 encodes a structural protein nucleocapsid protein (N) and a nsp 6b. The N protein has the ability to bind the ribonucleoprotein generated by the viral RNA of IBV and plays a key role in viral replication and assembly as well as in cellular immunity (Ignjatovic and Galli, 1994; Ignjatovic and Galli, 1995) . The nsp 4b, 4c, and 6b have rarely reported in literature although they were present in most IBVs and Turkey coronavirus (TCoV) (Cao et al., 2008; Gomaa et al., 2008; Thor et al., 2011; Xue et al., 2012; Reddy et al., 2015) .",

There are several reasons for the difficulties in preventing and controlling IBV. Firstly, the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of IBV is not able to proofread its RNA, leading to RNA insertion, deletion, and substitution in the process of RNA replication. Secondly, due to the unique template switch during discontinuous RNA synthesis in IBV transcription, the nature recombination of the viral RNA frequently occurs among different strains (Zuniga et al., 2010) . In addition, there were at least 30 serotypes of IBV identified worldwide, yet most of the available IBV vaccines can hardly provide effective cross-protection against strains of different serotype (Cook et al., 2012) . As such, variants of the virus that varies in pathogenicity or serotype incessantly emerge, leading to different outbreaks of the disease.",

It can be attributed to the low efficacy of the current vaccines against the emergence of new serotypes or antigenic variants of IBV in China.",

Although 4b, 4c, and 6b are present in the most of the IBV genomes, they have rarely been studied, and their functions were thus unknown (Reddy et al., 2015) . The gene 1 accounts for two-thirds of the genome, and encodes 2 overlapping proteins pp1a and pp1ab. Pp1ab is an extension of pp1a by a minus 1 frameshifting translation mechanism (Brierley et al., 1987) . The pp1a/1ab is cleaved into 15 nsps (nsp2 to nsp16) by PLpro and 3CLpro encoded by the virus. These nsps, forming a transcription/replication complex that involves in the viral genome's transcription, replication, and the viral infection, are important functional proteins for the virus. The cleavage products and cleavage sites of the pp1a/1ab of QY16 are highly identical to those of reported reference IBV strain A2 (Liu et al., 2009) , Sczy3 (Zhao et al., 2013) , and TCoV (Gomaa et al., 2008) . It suggests that pp1a/1ab is highly conserved in IBV. The CS (CTT/GAACAA) of the TRS is another conserved sequence of IBV. The CS can be the binding center of the leader sequence and the subgenomic mRNA, and can promote the transcription of mRNA2 to 6 (Sola et al., 2005) . In this study, the CS sequence 20,335, 21,837 to 27,670, and 20, 336 to 21,836 nt among QY16, YX10, 4/91, and other 14 reference strains. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method (bootstrapping for 1,000 replicates). The recombinant strain QY16 was labeled with green squares, the major parental strain YX10 with blue squares, and the minor parental strain 4/91 with red squares. of QY16 is found to be conserved as CTT/GAACAA except for the gene 5 which is with a 6 nt insertion (GAGAAA) and 2 nt deletion (CG). It has been found in QY16, LX4, and YX10, whereas another 6 nt (AA-GAAA) insertion was reported in the IBV strain (Liu et al., 2009 )-A2 and BJ, and Sczy3. Furthermore, a 3 nt (AAA) insertion was found in the strains including SAIBK, CK/CH/GD/GZ14, DY07, CQ04-1, GX-YL5, and YN which are all Chinese isolates. In addition, the overseas strains 4/91, Beaudette, and M41 were found to have no insertion. The further comparison among QY16, 42 Chinese isolates, and 36 overseas isolates suggests that an insertion in the CS of TRS of the gene 5 is common among the Chinese IBV but uncommon among oversea IBV strains. Whether these insertions could be a genetic marker between Chinese and overseas strains needs to be further verified.",

Despite the fact that the 4/91 strain has become an important gene donor in genetic evolution of IBV in China (Han et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2015) , it is difficult to identify the 4/91 pathogenic or vaccine strain involve in the formation the recombinant IBV strains. In this study, the 4/91 vaccine is proved to be a minor parent strain of QY16 and the recombination region is predicted to include the 3 1b terminal (85 nt) and most part of the S1 gene (1,466 nt). It is believed that the recombination \"hot spots,\" including C(T/G)TAACAA (Jia et al., 1995; Lee and Jackwood, 2000) , CTTTTG (Wang et al., 1993) , CTTTT(C/T) (Mondal and Cardona, 2007) , and other A-T-rich regions (Zhao et al., 2013) , are located adjacent to the putative crossover sites. In our study, these putative crossover sites are found to be nowhere near the breakpoint, and it is difficult to determine whether these motifs are associated with the recombination. As the recombination region of QY16 includes most of the S1 gene, the pathogenicity study and vaccination-challenge tests were conducted to examine the efficacy of the H120 and 4/19 vaccines against QY16. The result shows QY16 causes 40% death among 17-day-old SPF chickens compared with the reported mortality rate of 25% among 15-day-old SPF chickens caused by its major parent strain YX10 (Xue et al., 2012; Feng et al., 2015) . The pathogenicity of QY16 has apparently enhanced in this regard as this result shows. The clinical symptoms of the chickens infected with QY16 are typical nephritis symptoms which are similar to the situations caused by YX10 but different from the muscle lesions caused by the 4/91 pathogenic strain. Meanwhile, it has been proved by our study that the H120 vaccine cannot provide effective protection against the QY16 challenge, and it is probably because of the difference between their serotypes. The diversity of serotypes among the Mass-type vaccines (H120, H52, W93, etc.) and Chinese isolates has been confirmed by previous studies (Li et al., 2012; Feng et al., 2017) , which can provide a possible explanation for H120's failure in serving as an effective vaccine against QY16. Our results also prove that the 4/91 vaccine cannot provide complete protection against QY16 challenge either. On one hand, recombinant QY16 and 4/91 may have difference in serotypes. Although the S1 gene of QY16 is highly similar to that of 4/91, the difference in the S1 gene and other genes may still lead to the great change in the serotype and pathogenicity. On the other hand, a broader degree of cross-protection provided by a vaccine against different viral strains is related to the cell-mediated immune responses to the shared T-cell epitopes among some heterologous strains Seo et al., 2000) . As most of the T-cell epitopes of IBV remain in the M and N protein (Ignjatovic and Galli, 1994) , the diversity in M and N genes may contribute to low cross-protection efficacy, in this case 4/91 vaccine's low protection efficacy against QY16.",

The recombinant strain QY16 is proved by our study to derive from YX10 (as the major parental sequence) and 4/91 (as the minor parental sequence). It can be inferred from the results of the pathogenicity study and vaccination-challenge test that CK/CH/GD/QY16 is a type of nephropathogenic strain and that the vaccine strains H120 and 4/91 cannot provide complete protection against it. These results indicate that the continuing evolution of IBV strains by genetic drift and genetic recombination may lead to IBV outbreaks even among the vaccinated chickens in China, which calls for the further development of new vaccines to help prevent and control the disease.",
