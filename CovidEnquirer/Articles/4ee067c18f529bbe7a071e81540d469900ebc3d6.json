The parietal peritoneum covers the abdominal wall and diaphragm. The visceral peritoneum covers the abdominal organs ( Fig. 26-1 ). The peritoneum consists of a single layer of mesothelial cells covering a basement membrane. 1 The peritoneal mesothelial cells have the same embryological origin as vascular endothelial cells 2 and produce surfactant that acts as a lubricant. 3 The basement membrane is a fibroelastic tissue containing glycosylated proteins, mast cells, macrophages, and lymphocytes and it covers a well-defined network of elastic fibers. The basement membrane is absent in parts of the diaphragm, omentum, and mesentery. 1 The absence of the basement membrane in the diaphragm allows large gaps between the mesothelial cells ('stomata') to communicate directly with underlying lymphatic channels, facilitating absorption of fluid and particulate matter.",

Contraction of the diaphragm closes the stomata and forces fluid into the lymphatic system. 1 This lymphatic system transports fluid and other absorbed material into the internal thoracic (or 'parasternal') mediastinal lymphatic system and mediastinal and parasternal lymph nodes, then to the thoracic duct system, and eventually to the systemic venous circulation. 7 Fluid is normally also absorbed through other sites in the peritoneum, including the omentum. 1, 8 Section The Abdomen | 5 | in the gastrointestinal tract. Polymicrobial infections present a significant problem because of bacterial synergism. This appears to be most important in mixed infections with Gram negative and anaerobic bacteria. Anaerobic bacteria alone (such as Bacillus fragilis) seem to cause minimal pathology in experimental models. However, when combined with Gram negative enteric bacteria, the resulting infection is considerably more severe. 25 Ingesta, exfoliated cells, blood, gastric mucin, and bile salts are adjuvant substances that worsen peritonitis.

Fluid exuded into the peritoneal cavity is rich in fibrinogen. Injured cells release tissue thromboplastin, promoting the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin, stimulating fibrin formation from fibrinogen The normal fibrinolytic system is down regulated in peritonitis, leading to the accumulation of fibrin, which walls off bacteria 17 The inflammatory response within the peritoneal cavity and the associated increased peritoneal vascular permeability result in the effusion of a large volume of protein-rich fluid into the peritoneal space. This results in a substantial loss of intravascular volume. In addition, systemic activation of the inflammatory and coagulation cascades causes further loss of fluid and protein and often disregulation of vascular tone and decreased tissue perfusion. 19 Systemically, macrophages and other cells in the immune system respond to endotoxin and other bacteria-derived molecules ('pathogenassociated molecular patterns' or PAMPS) and endogenous mediators released from dead or dying cells 20 through Toll-like receptors to initiate a complex systemic inflammatory response (SIRS). The SIRS response is referred to as 'sepsis' when initiated by bacteria. Binding of endotoxin from Gram negative bacteria to the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-binding protein on macrophages stimulates the release of multiple cytokines. 21 The mechanisms by which Gram positive bacteria induce systemic inflammation are less well characterized but several substances they contain, including peptidoglycan, teichoic acid, and their polysaccharide-hyaluronic acid capsules have pro-inflammatory effects, including the production of cytokines (tumor necrosis factor [TNF], interleukin-1 [IL1]) and nitric oxide. 22, 23 The macrophage is the main cell initiating the systemic response to bacteria and proteins from damaged cells. 19 IL1 and TNF\u03b1 are rapidly released after macrophage stimulation and promote activation of many of the inflammatory and coagulation cascades. A detailed discussion of cytokines involved in sepsis is beyond the scope of this chapter and the reader is referred elsewhere for a more detailed review. 19 The net result of sepsis in peritonitis is a decrease in intravascular volume, decreased cardiac output as a result of decreased preload, abnormal vascular tone, and vascular thrombosis, leading to maldistribution of blood flow, poor tissue perfusion, and organ damage. For more information on shock and SIRS the reader is referred to Chapter 3.",

In a second study, no anastomosis or biopsy site leaked in 70 cats with alimentary lymphosarcoma. 56 In dogs, factors suggesting an increase in the risk of postoperative dehiscence include presence of a foreign body or a traumatic injury, preoperative peritonitis, and hypoalbuminemia. 54, 55 Perforation of a gastrointestinal ulcer, perhaps associated with carprofen ingestion, has been reported in one cat with peritonitis. 57 Secondary peritonitis in cats may occur following bite wounds, gunshot wounds or vehicular trauma. 27 Bacteria enter the peritoneal cavity directly from the environment or from trauma resulting in rupture of a viscus.

Primary peritonitis is more commonly reported in human than veterinary patients and is usually associated with diseases that cause ascites, such as cirrhosis. 30, 31, 40, 41 In veterinary medicine, FIP is the most common cause of primary peritonitis. 39, 42 FIP is caused by infection with a feline coronavirus and presents in two forms, the granulomatous (dry) form or the effusive (wet) form, which is the form that results in abdominal effusion and peritonitis. 43 In a retrospective study on cats with peritonitis, four out of 65 cats had primary peritonitis resulting from the effusive FIP. 44 There are numerous reports of primary peritonitis in cats due to other pathogens besides FIP; however, the true source of the infection in most cases is unclear. [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] Secondary peritonitis Secondary peritonitis is the most common form of peritonitis seen in veterinary medicine. 31 Bacterial contamination results from penetrating abdominal trauma, bite wounds, contamination from surgery or diagnostic aspiration procedures. Leakage of bacteria from abdominal organs into the peritoneal cavity is another frequent source of contamination in secondary peritonitis. 31 While all of the abdominal organs can be potential septic sources of contamination, leakage of contents from the gastrointestinal tract is the most common cause of peritonitis. 27, [50] [51] [52] [53] In cats, gastrointestinal leakage causing septic peritonitis is most often the result of neoplasia. 27 In one study, neoplasia was the underlying cause of gastrointestinal leakage and subsequent ",

Until these results are obtained, the choice of antibiotics is based on knowledge of the normal bacterial flora of the organ suspected to be the source of the contamination, and antimicrobial pharmacokinetics. Intestinal bacteria are commonly coliforms, enterococci, and anaerobes. Appropriate antibiotics for these bacteria include a combination of ampicillin and either an aminoglycoside or fluoroquinolone. Metronidazole is often added to target anaerobes. Penicillin and cephalosporin antibiotics are 'time dependent' as they rely on maintaining serum concentrations above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) by frequent dosing, generally every six hours. Aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones depend on obtaining the highest possible drug concentration ('concentration dependent') by using a single daily dose for their bacteriocidal effect.",

Severely dehydrated animals with no underlying heart disease can be given 40-60 mL/kg over the first hour; subsequent rates of 5-15 mL/kg/hour are used depending on hydration status. Although some clinicians use 0.9% NaCl to avoid administering potassium, it is clear that more balanced electrolyte solutions (lactated Ringer's, Normasol R) allow for a more rapid correction of acid-base status without affecting normalization of serum potassium levels. 69, 70 In cases of marked hyperkalemia, calcium gluconate (a functional antagonist of potassium) should be administered slowly, intravenously (0.5 mL/kg). Although it does not lower serum potassium, calcium changes the threshold potential and returns membrane excitability to normal for approximately 20 to 30 minutes. Regular insulin (1 unit/kg) and/or glucose (1-2 g/unit of insulin) can also be administered. Animals are often also severely acidotic. Sodium bicarbonate can be administered (3-9 mEq/kg) to correct acidosis; however, this can paradoxically lower ionized calcium and so worsen the effects of hyperkalemia. Correction of the hyperkalemia and acidosis depends on re-establishing urine flow to allow effective potassium and acid excretion from the body. In animals with uroperitoneum this involves placement of a catheter to drain urine from the peritoneal cavity and ideally placement of a catheter into the bladder via the urethra. In cases where the urethra is completely transected a cystostomy tube is placed surgically or by using interventional radiology techniques.",

Synthetic colloids (Hetastarch, Dextran 70) are administered as a bolus (5 mL/kg) with 20-30 mL/kg of crystalloid. When available, fresh frozen plasma provides albumin and clotting factors. Ongoing resuscitation is determined by the response to therapy, measured by clinical and laboratory parameters, including heart rate, direct or indirect blood pressure, acid/base status, and blood lactate levels. In some cases blood pressure and tissue perfusion do not improve despite apparently adequate intravascular volume expansion. This may occur because of sepsis-associated disruption of vascular tone. In these instances, careful use of a vasopressor (dopamine: 5 \u00b5g/kg/minute; norepinephrine: 0.1 \u00b5g/kg/minute) can be effective in restoring vascular tone and tissue perfusion.",

            "text": "Peritonitis is associated with an increased risk of surgical dehiscence and leakage after closure of a viscus. 55, 71 Degradation of collagen and the extracellular matrix by the proteolyic enzymes in peritonitis is thought to predispose enterotomies and intestinal anastomoses to dehiscence. 72 The omentum plays an important role in the body's defense against injury and infection in the peritoneal cavity. The | 26 | space within the abdomen is at a sub-atmospheric pressure. Even with experimental insufflation of air, the intraperitoneal pressure never exceeds atmospheric pressure. 79 Unless either the intraperitoneal pressure becomes higher than atmospheric or air can enter the peritoneal cavity postoperatively through a vent, drainage from the peritoneal cavity will not occur without the use of a vacuum system. The use of drains within the peritoneal cavity is somewhat controversial because of the discrepancy between reasonable clinical results from their use and experimental studies clearly showing that the omentum and viscera rapidly encase drains inserted into the peritoneal cavity. 80 It is therefore not clear if drainage occurs from the peritoneal cavity proper or, more likely, from the area around the encased drain. In an experimental study in dogs, sump-Penrose drains were found encapsulated and isolated from the peritoneal cavity at necropsy performed after 48 hours. 5 Despite this isolation, the drains continued to remove radio-opaque contrast material from the peritoneal cavity. In a clinical study of closed-suction silicone drains for septic peritonitis, drains continued to accumulate fluid for up to eight days, seeming to indicate adequate function. However, it is not clear if closed-suction drains are encased to the same extent as sump-Penrose drains and are draining a localized area, or if they retain functional drainage of the peritoneal cavity despite being encased. 81 This study reported 70% survival in a cohort of 30 dogs and ten cats with septic peritonitis managed with closed-suction drains. Drains were in place for a mean of 3.6 days with a range of two to eight days. The volume of fluid produced was variable but decreased with time. The drains remained patent until removal, as evidenced by ongoing fluid collection. However, it is unclear what percentage of the total peritoneal fluid volume they drained. No significant complications were reported with clinical use of the closed-suction drains. Closed-suction drains are relatively inexpensive, easy to place, and seem to be free of significant complications (see Fig. 26 -5 and Chapter 11). It should be noted, however, that experimentally, latex drains can significantly impair bowel wound healing. It is not clear if silastic closed-suction drains impair bowel healing in a similar manner. Advantages of closed-suction drainage over open peritoneal drainage include the ability to quantify the volume of effusion and decreased cost and labor.",

Once bacteria have colonized and adhered to the peritoneum, they are difficult to remove by lavage. 76, 77 Lavage fluid remaining in the peritoneal cavity dilutes complement and other opsonins and suspends bacteria away from neutrophils and macrophages, making phagocytosis more difficult.

In cases of uncomplicated bladder rupture and uroperitoneum the clinician might reasonably expect a cat to eat within one to two days of a successful surgery. However, in cases of generalized bacterial peritonitis, voluntary food intake is unlikely. At the same time, generalized peritonitis is associated with a significant hypermetabolic state, intraperitoneal protein loss, and protein/energy malnutrition. An esophagosotomy, gastrostomy, or jejunostomy tube allows early enteral feeding (see Chapter 12) . Enteral feeding maintains mucosal enterocyte health and minimizes bacterial translocation from the gut. In cases where enteral feeding is not tolerated, total parenteral nutrition is considered; ideally, a multiple lumen catheter is placed immediately before or after surgery.",

The falciform fat should be excised according to standard exploratory laparotomy technique (see Chapter 23), but omentectomy is not necessary or desirable. The linea alba is closed with non-absorbable suture in a simple continuous pattern with a gap of 1-3 cm between the edges (Fig. 26-6) , depending on the patient's size. The subcutaneous tissues and skin are not closed. A sterile bandage consisting of a nonadherent contact layer, such as petrolatum impregnated gauze, laparotomy sponges, and surgery towels underneath routine bandage material is applied and changed at least daily. If the bandage becomes wet from peritoneal effusion or urine, or if the bandage becomes displaced, the bandage should be replaced as soon as possible. The bandage should be changed in the operating room with the patient sedated or anesthetized. During each bandage change, adhesions at the incision are digitally disrupted and the incision is checked for organ evisceration. The decision to close the peritoneal cavity is based on reassessment of the same factors used in selecting open peritoneal drainage or cytological analysis of the effusion. Closure is performed as a complete laparotomy. ",
