            "text": "Rhinovirus (RV), which is responsible for the majority of common colds, also causes exacerbations in patients with asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. So far, there are no drugs available for treatment of rhinovirus infection. We examined the effect of quercetin, a plant flavanol on RV infection in vitro and in vivo. Pretreatment of airway epithelial cells with quercetin decreased Akt phosphosphorylation, viral endocytosis and IL-8 responses. Addition of quercetin 6 h after RV infection (after viral endocytosis) reduced viral load, IL-8 and IFN responses in airway epithelial cells. This was associated with decreased levels of negative and positive strand viral RNA, and RV capsid protein, abrogation of RVinduced eIF4GI cleavage and increased phosphorylation of eIF2a. In mice infected with RV, quercetin treatment decreased viral replication as well as expression of chemokines and cytokines. Quercetin treatment also attenuated RV-induced airway cholinergic hyperresponsiveness. Together, our results suggest that quercetin inhibits RV endocytosis and replication in airway epithelial cells at multiple stages of the RV life cycle. Quercetin also decreases expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and improves lung function in RV-infected mice. Based on these observations, further studies examining the potential benefits of quercetin in the prevention and treatment of RV infection are warranted.",

Although RV infections cause only mild disease and are self-limiting in normal individuals, they represent a significant economic burden, particularly in loss of working hours and missed school days (Proud, 2005) . Accumulating evidence also suggests that RV is an important trigger of acute exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma (Johnston et al., 1995; Seemungal et al., 2000 Seemungal et al., , 2001 . Experimental RV infection of asthma and COPD patients results in the development of lower respiratory disease, airflow obstruction, and systemic and airway inflammation which are greater and more prolonged than the similarly-infected control subjects (Mallia et al., 2006 (Mallia et al., , 2011 Message et al., 2008) . The clinical outcomes of experimental RV infection correlate with viral load and inflammatory cytokines in sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage.",

            "text": "The RV life cycle offers many opportunities for intervention. The initial stage of the viral life cycle involves binding to a cell surface receptor, endocytosis, acidification of the endosome, viral uncoating, and release of viral RNA (vRNA) to the cytoplasm (Prchla et al., 1994) . In the next stage, vRNA is translated as a single large polyprotein from an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) which is located in the 5 0 untranslated region of RV genome. The polyprotein is processed through sequential enzymatic cleavages by two virus-encoded proteinases, 2A and 3C proteinase (Foeger et al., 2003; Hellen et al., 1989) . Simultaneously, transcription of viral genome that is catalyzed by virus-encoded RNA polymerase begins (Meredith et al., 1999) . In the final stage of viral replication, RNA and capsid proteins are assembled into mature viral particles, which are then released by cell lysis. During the replication process, RNA viruses, including RV, modify the cellular functions to their advantage. For example, RV proteinase 2A attacks the host translational machinery in susceptible HeLa cells by cleaving eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF)-4GI and eIF4GII, thereby shutting off cap-dependent host cell protein synthesis (Glaser and Skern, 2000; Gradi et al., 2003) . Drugs which interfere with any of the above steps would be beneficial in treating RV infection.",

            "text": "Quercetin (3,3 0 ,4 0 ,5,7-pentahydroxyflavone) is a plant flavonoid present in many plants including broccoli, apples, berries, onions, and tea. Flavonoids share a common chemical structure consisting of two phenol rings linked through three carbons. Quercetin has potent antioxidant effects, combined with free radical species to form considerably less reactive phenoxy radicals. Quercetin also has inhibitory effects on several lipid, protein tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases including phosphatidylinositol (PI)-3-kinase, and induces nitric oxide synthase (Agullo et al., 1997; Davies et al., 2000; Huang et al., 1999; Jiang et al., 2006; Peet and Li, 1999) . Quercetin has also been shown to exert antiviral activities in vitro. Quercetin or its derivatives reduce the infectivity or replication of herpes simplex virus type 1, poliovirus type 1, parainfluenza virus type 3, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus an influenza virus in vitro (Castrillo and Carrasco, 1987; Chiang et al., 2003; Kaul et al., 1985; Kim et al., 2010b; Neznanov et al., 2008) . Among the several quercetin derivates examined, 4 0 ,7-dihydroxy-3-methoxy-5,6-dimethylflavone exhibited potent antirhinoviral effects in human skin fibroblasts (De Meyer et al., 1991) . However, quercetin by itself had no antirhinoviral effect in this study. Later, quercetin was shown to inhibit the SARS-CoV protease that is required for SARS virus replication as well as hepatitis C viral protein translation and release of newly formed viral particles (Gonzalez et al., 2009) . Quercetin supplementation was also shown to reduce susceptibility to influenza A virus infection and severity of disease following stressful exercise in mice (Davis et al., 2008) and symptoms of upper respiratory tract infections in athletes (Nieman et al., 2007) . This is of importance, because quercetin supplementation increases skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis modestly in untrained athletes and this is associated with improved exercise performance (Nieman et al., 2010) . Since mitochondria orchestrate antiviral signaling following recognition of cytosolic viral components (Tal and Iwasaki, 2011) , there may exist a relationship between quercetin-induced mitochondrial biogenesis and reduced susceptibility to influenza infection. Although, association of physical stress/fatigue with susceptibility to RV infection is not established, RV causes severe exacerbations in patients with COPD and asthma (Mallia et al., 2006 (Mallia et al., , 2011 Message et al., 2008) . Understanding the mechanisms by which quercetin inhibits rhinovirus infectivity and replication is necessary to determine the suitability of quercetin to treat RV infections in these patients. In the present study, we examined the effects of quercetin treatment on RV endocytosis, viral genome transcription and translation, and pro-inflammatory responses in vitro. We also assessed the effect of quercetin in vivo using a novel mouse model of RV infection (Newcomb et al., 2008) .",

We also showed that endocytosis of RV requires activation of PI-3-kinase. Since quercetin inhibits PI-3-kinase activity (Davies et al., 2000) , we determined whether quercetin pretreatment inhibits endocytosis of RV. Quercetin pretreatment significantly decreased endocytosis of both RV1B and RV39 by BEAS-2B cells ( Fig. 2A and B) . We observed similar attenuation in the endocytosis of UV-RV. We also examined the colocalization of RV1B and EEA1, an early endosomal marker, by confocal microscopy. Cells inoculated with sham HeLa cell lysate showed diffuse signals for EEA1 in the cytoplasm (data not shown). Cells infected with RV1B showed clustering of RV particles. These cells also showed punctate staining for EEA1 as opposed to diffuse staining, an indication of recruitment of EEA1 to endosomes. Clustered RV particles frequently co-localized with endosomal EEA1, indicating endocytosis of RV in these cells (Fig. 2C ). In contrast, cells pretreated with quercetin and infected with RV1B showed an EEA1 distribution similar to sham-treated cells and only faint signals for RV which did not co-localize with EEA1-positive endosomes. (The faint signals for RV may represent the bound, but not endocytosed virus.) These results suggest that pretreatment with quercetin may block endocytosis of RV. Next we examined whether quercetin inhibits RV-induced phosphorylation of Akt, a downstream effector of PI-3-kinase. As observed previously, RV1B treated cells showed increased Akt phosphorylation compared to sham-infected cells (Fig. 2D ). Quercetin pretreatment completely inhibited RV-induced Akt phosphorylation. These results indicate that quercetin decreases RV endocytosis and PI-3-kinase/Akt signaling, leading to a reduction in IL-8 expression.",

Quercetin inhibited replication of RV by suppressing transcription of RV genome. Further, quercetin decreased RV-induced cleavage of eIF4GI and increased phosphorylation of eIF2a. Finally, we showed that quercetin treatment of RV-infected mice decreased viral replication, expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and airways hyperresponsiveness to methacholine challenge.

We and others have shown that PI-3-kinase activity is required for RV endocytosis and also for viral replicationindependent IL-8 responses (Bentley et al., 2007; Lau et al., 2008; Newcomb et al., 2005) . Therefore, treatment of cells with quercetin prior to or during RV infection could inhibit viral infection by abolishing RV endocytosis, an essential initial step of RV infection.

For instance, quercetin and its derivative 3-methylquercetin were shown to inhibit synthesis of poliovirus RNA (Castrillo and Carrasco, 1987; Neznanov et al., 2008) and this was attributed to inhibition of viral RNA polymerase 3D pol (Castrillo and Carrasco, 1987) . Viral RNA polymerase 3D pol is required for conversion of viral genome to create negative-strand RNA, which serves as a template for generating positive strand viral genome (Castrillo and Carrasco, 1987; Hung Fig. 8 . Quercetin decreases RV-stimulated chemokine and cytokine responses in vivo. Mice were infected with RV1B and treated with quercetin or vehicle as described in the Fig. 5 legend. After sacrifice, mouse lungs were excised, homogenized in PBS, centrifuged and supernatant examined by ELISA (A-D) or total RNA was extracted from the lungs and mRNA expression of IFN-a and IFN-k1 was measured by qPCR (E and F). Data represent mean \u00b1 SD calculated from triplicate experiments ( \u2044 p 6 0.05, different from sham; p 6 0.05, different from mice infected with RV and treated with vehicle). et al., 2002) . Recently, polyphenols including quercetin were shown to increase zinc uptake in Caco2 cells and zinc ions have been shown to inhibit 3D pol in vitro (Hung et al., 2002; Krenn et al., 2005; Sreenivasulu et al., 2010) . Further, quercetin may also interfere with the processing of RV polyprotein by RV proteases that is required for activation of RNA polymerase (Hellen et al., 1989) . In addition to processing viral 3D pol , viral protease 2A also cleaves eIF4G to inhibit cap-dependent host protein synthesis and promote viral genome translation (Glaser and Skern, 2000; Gradi et al., 2003) . Our results demonstrate that quercetin significantly reduced both negative and positive strand viral RNA and this was associated with reduced cleavage of eIFG4II and reduction in viral capsid protein, VP2, suggesting that quercetin may inhibit initial polypeptide processing that is required for both viral RNA polymerase processing and for cleavage of eIFG4II thereby blocking all the downstream steps in RV replication. Another possibility is that quercetin may directly inhibit viral RNA polymerase thereby blocking genome translation and synthesis of new progeny virus.",

We observed that quercetin increases phosphorylation of eIF2a, beyond that stimulated by RV infection itself and therefore it is likely that quercetin also limits viral replication by enhancing host innate immune responses. Recently, replication of enterovirus, a member of picornaviridae family was shown to occur in specialized organelles enriched in phosphoinositide-4phosphate (PI4P) lipids generated by PI-4-kinase IIIb (Hsu et al., 2010) . If RV replication requires PI4P-enriched orgenelles, it is possible that quercetin which inhibits PI-4-kinases (Prajda et al., 1995) may interfere with formation of these orgenelles thus blocking viral replication. Together, these observations suggest that quercetin may interfere with viral replication by more than one mechanism.",

Using this model system, we show for the first time that quercetin not only inhibits RV replication in vitro, but also inhibits RV replication, RV-induced pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression, and RV-induced airway hyperresponsiveness in vivo. Mice treated with quercetin showed a significantly decreased viral load, diminished levels Fig. 9 . Compared to vehicle-treated animals, RV-infected mice treated with quercetin show decreased airways responsiveness to methacholine. Mice were infected with RV1B and then treated with DMSO or quercetin as described above. After 1 day, mice were anesthetized and airways responsiveness to methacholine challenge was measured (n = 3; \u2044 p 6 0.05, different from sham infected mice; p 6 0.05, different from mice infected with RV1B and treated with vehicle, two-way ANOVA). Fig. 10 . Treatment of quercetin during RV infection is necessary to limit RV-stimulated cytokine responses. Mice were treated with quercetin or vehicle as described in Fig. 7 for 10 days. Forty hours after the last quercetin or vehicle treatment, mice were infected with RV1B or sham and sacrificed 24 h post-infection and lungs harvested for determination of cytokine proteins by ELISA (A-D) or IFN mRNA expression by qPCR (E-G).

In addition, quercetin treatment decreased RVinduced lung inflammation, as evidenced by reduced expression of CXCL-1, CXCL-2, CCL2 and TNF-a. We have previously shown that, in addition to their role in lung inflammation, CXCR2 ligands and TNF-a contribute to RV-induced airways hyperresponsiveness . Neutrophils, attracted to the airways by CXCR2 ligands, induce a state of hyperresponsiveness by elaboration of TNF-a . Therefore, decreased airways responsiveness observed in RV-infected mice treated with quercetin may be due to decreased lung CXCL1, CXCL2 and TNF-a levels.",

Upon supplementation with 1 g of quercetin aglycone/day increases plasma levels to 1.5 lM (Boots et al., 2007; Conquer et al., 1998) . Previously we have shown that treatment of mice with 0.2 mg of quercetin yield total plasma quercetin (including both quercetin and its primary conjugates) levels on the order of 150 nM (Ganesan et al., 2010; Nanua et al., 2006) . This dose of quercetin was sufficient to reduce lung inflammation in a mouse model of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and also an allergic mouse model of asthma (Ganesan et al., 2010; Nanua et al., 2006; Rogerio et al., 2007) .

One possibility is that quercetin may be absorbed better in vivo via small intestine compared to respiratory epithelial cells in vitro. Another possibility is that quercetin metabolites generated in vivo may be more potent as an antiviral agent than the parent compound. Quercetin dihydrate is metabolized in different organs including small intestine and liver similar to quercetin glycosides (Harwood et al., 2007) . Quercetin glycosides are in fact precursors of quercetin aglycon in vivo. Quercetin glycosides are initially hydrolyzed to form quercetin aglycon in the epithelial cells of small intestine (Murota and Terao, 2003) and the aglycon generated is metabolized by phase II enzymes present in the small intestine, liver and other organs to methylated, sulfated and glycosylated forms. One hour after intragastric administration of quercetin to rats, the majority of the absorbed quercetin was found in the form of quercetin glucuronides, sulfoglucuronides and sulfates as well as isorhamnetic conjugates (Justino et al., 2004) . Quercetin glucuronide was proposed to be a more potent modulator of reactive oxygen-generating enzymes than quercetin (Terao et al., 2011) . Further studies are required to assess the antiviral effects of known quercetin metabolites.",
