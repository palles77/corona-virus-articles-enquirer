The advantages included rapid implementation without NPIRs, flexibility to transfer patients, and re-inforcement for HCWs to comply with infection control procedures, especially handwashing. The efficacy and low cost are major advantages, especially in countries with large populations at risk and fewer economic resources.",

Personal protective equipment and negative pressure isolation rooms (NPIRs) have not been completely successful in protecting HCWs. We introduced an innovative, integrated infection control strategy involving triaging patients using barriers, zones of risk, and extensive installation of alcohol dispensers for glove-on hand rubbing. This integrated infection control approach was implemented at a SARS designated hospital ('study hospital') where NPIRs were not available. The number of HCWs who contracted SARS in the study hospital was compared with the number of HCWs who contracted SARS in 86 Taiwan hospitals that did not use the integrated infection control strategy. Ultimately, 150 individuals contracted SARS from one index case admitted to TMHH, including 113 patients and 37 HCWs. 2 To protect our HCWs and non-infected patients from contracting SARS, we introduced a new approach that we have named the 'integrated infection control strategy'. We assessed the effectiveness of the integrated infection control strategy by comparing the rate of SARS transmission in HCWs in the study hospital with that in other major hospitals in Taiwan without the integrated infection control strategy.",

A 'negative-pressure-like' environment was created in the study hospital as follows. All windows of the rooms facing due east (next to a residential building) were sealed air tight. All gaps at the bottom of the doors of patients' rooms (one patient per room) were sealed. Sixteen-inch exhaust fans were installed in patients' rooms facing due west to create a negative-pressure-like airflow within the rooms. The exits and staircases of each floor were sealed to prevent air interflow between floors. Four separate central air conditioning systems provided ducted air for each floor. Each ventilation system was set up to use a mixture of 50% fresh air taken from the outside and, as an economy measure, 50% air extracted from all areas of the hospital building within the same floor. All of the exhaust air to the west was blown outside to a 60!30 m restricted area, and N95 respirators were required for all personnel who entered this area.

Before entering/leaving each patient's room, healthcare workers were required to disinfect their hands by rubbing (while wearing double latex gloves) with 75% alcohol solution to prevent any contact transmission from the gloves to the doorknob or other surfaces. After entering/leaving the room and closing the door, their hands were disinfected again. This 'disinfecttouch-disinfect' routine was applicable in all zones.",

In a limited six-hospital survey, the circumstantial evidence showed that two SARS-affected hospitals that did not separate the patient transporting route and the isolation ward were epidemiologically linked to transported SARS patients. 18 The strategic installation of alcohol dispensers to enforce hand disinfection between zones of risk is an important aspect of the integrated infection control strategy.

For example, NPIRs were not available in the study hospital, while 746 beds were in NPIRs in the comparison hospitals. Analysis of HCW cases could not be stratified by the severity of illness and degree of infectivity for the index cases since such criteria have not been standardized. So, a prospective randomized study comparing the application of the integrated infection control strategy with the standard approach would have been the most rigorous method to confirm the efficacy of the integrated infection control strategy. However, this ideal method was impossible to implement during an outbreak. Between 27 April and 21 May 2003, only two HCWs contracted SARS from the study hospital. Given this significant difference (PZ0.033) and the fact that the study hospital had the highest proportion of SARS patients in Taiwan and not a single NPIR, the Taiwan CDC mandated that all Taiwan hospitals with SARS patients should immediately adopt the integrated infection control strategy after 21 May 2003 and the SARS epidemic was under control in two weeks. It may be possible to evaluate this approach in a controlled fashion to confirm its effectiveness in other countries. If confirmed, the integrated infection control strategy may be a model of infection control for epidemic infectious diseases of the future.",

Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.jhin.2005.02.011 Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has claimed 73 lives in Taiwan including two first year resident physicians and five critical care nurses. The initial SARS epidemic among healthcare workers (HCWs) in Taiwan started at the Taipei Municipal Hoping Hospital (TMHH). Seventeen HCWs contracted SARS between 22 and 23 April 2003 from six different locations within the hospital; interestingly, none of the 17 HCWs had known direct contact with the index SARS patients admitted from the community. 1 Health officials decided to quarantine the hospital because it was postulated that Taiwan SARS cases involving HCWs were occurring as a result of nosocomial transmission. More than 1000 patients, HCWs and visitors were not allowed to leave the TMHH for three days. Subsequently, the President of Taiwan made an executive decision on 26 April 2003 to evacuate the hospital. Within 48 h, renovation of a military hospital was completed to accommodate transfer of the SARS patients from TMHH to the study hospital.",
