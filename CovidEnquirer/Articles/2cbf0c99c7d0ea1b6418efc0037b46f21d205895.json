EHEC are associated with diarrhoea and dysentery in humans and in ruminants, mainly calves from two to eight weeks of age. Clinical signs and/or lesions have been reproduced experimentally with EHEC strains belonging to serotypes O5:K4/Nm, O26:K-:H11, O111:Nm, and O157:H7 which are isolated from cattle and/or humans. The purpose of this work was to develop an experimental model of infection in newborn calves with a bovine EHEC strain isolated from a calf which of died of diarrhoea, and belonging to the O118:H16 serotype, which is also common to both cattle and humans. The bovine O118:H16 EHEC strain was able to colonize the gut of three newborn calves, and to induce diarrhoea twenty-four hours after challenge and to produce AE lesions in the small and/or large intestines. AE lesions were detected microscopically and ultrastructurally in the small intestine of one calf and in the whole intestinal track of two calves. Internalization of bacteria and also of pedestal-bacteria complex inside of the enterocyte was observed in two of the three calves. The significance of this stage is unknown but may be related to the invasion of the calf by the bacteria. The challenge strain was isolated from the mesenteric lymph nodes of the same two calves but not from other organs or from heart blood. No blood was observed in the faeces of any of the three calves, nor were any lesions in the internal organs, which may have been related to the production of a verotoxin whose role is still unknown in cattle. \u00a9 2000 \u00c9ditions scientifiques et m\u00e9dicales Elsevier SAS",

            "text": "Since 1984 [2] , attaching and effacing Escherichia coli is recognised as a cause of diarrhoea and dysentery in young calves, mainly from two to eight weeks of age [5, 16] . 'Attaching and effacing' was the term first used by Moon and collaborators [22] to describe an intestinal lesion (AE lesion) caused by specific strains of E. coli: 'effacing' because of the localized disappearance of the brush border microvilli; 'attaching' because of the inti-mate attachment of the bacteria to the exposed cytoplasmic membrane of the enterocyte. AE lesions are caused by enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), Citrobacter rodentium, Hafnia alveii, and enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC), which differ essentially from the EPEC by the production of cytotoxins active on various epithelial cells (Hela and Hep-2) in culture, the verocytotoxins (VT1 and VT2 families), also named shigacytotoxins (Stx1 and Stx2 families) [19, 21, 24] . EPEC causes diarrhoea in various animal species and in humans, whereas EHEC is associated with diarrhoea and dysentery in rumi-nants and in humans. In the latter, EHEC also causes the haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (HUS) [4, 16, 19, 24, 25] .",

(In vivo, the most dramatic consequence is the effacement of the brush border microvilli); (iii) intimate attachment to the exposed enterocyte cytoplasmic membrane, mediated by an outer membrane protein, intimin, with polymerisation of actin filaments underneath the zone of adherence of the bacteria and enhancement of the cytoskeleton rearrangements; and (iv) penetration of the bacteria into the cells. The VT/Stx toxins play no role in the development of the AE lesions, but cause damage to the intestinal wall vessels resulting in haemorrhages and dysentery in humans and calves. In humans, they also cause damage to the arterioles of the kidneys, resulting in the HUS [19, 24, 25] .",

Arguments in favour of a role of the O118:H16 EHEC strain are: (i) challenge with a nontoxigenic F17-producing E. coli strain resulted in the absence of any clinical signs (Van Bost and Mainil, unpublished data); (ii) the colonization of the gut was still high as attested by the faecal excretion even after the disappearance of the diarrhoea (figure 1).

            "text": "The severity and the length of the diarrhoea was thus not related to the degree of intestinal colonization, nor to the degree of extension of the macroscopic (acute serous enteritis) and microscopic (AE) lesions (small intestine for calf 1, small and large intestine for calves 2 and 3; table II). Other factors must thus be considered: the presence of other diarrhoeagenic agents, such as a rotavirus in calf 2; the age of the animal and its genetic background; loss of some bacterial virulence genes during storage. Coexistence between EPEC/EHEC strains and other diarrhoeagenic agents has already been noticed in field studies and may be related to the severity and persistance of diarrhoea in farms [5] . The age of the animal is also important: with strains of serotypes O157:H7 and O26:H11 clinical signs could not be reproduced in calves aged one to two weeks but could be reproduced well in newborn calves [1, 6, 7, 18] . The opposite situation may exist for strains belonging to other serotypes, mimicking the situation of EPEC in rabbits [21, 26] . VT toxins are thought to cause the appearance of bloody diarrhoea at least in man [24] , but the situation may be different in calves. No blood was indeed observed in the faeces of any of the three calves, nor were there any lesions in the internal organs which may have been related to the production of a verotoxin, in the brain as in piglets suffering from oedema disease [19] or in the kidneys as in humans suffering from HUS [24] . The role of VT1 produced by most cattle EHEC [17, 19] is actually still unknown. Challenge experiments with the wild-type strain and isogenic mutants in the genes coding for the verotoxins may bring an answer to this question.",

Internalization of bacteria and also of bacteria-pedestal complex inside the enterocyte was (table II) . It is also worth noting that strain 340S89, and several other EHEC and EPEC bovine strains, give images of internalization into the enterocytes when tested in the rabbit ligated intestinal loop assay [4, 12] . The significance of this stage is unknown but may be related to the invasion of the calf by the bacteria. Indeed, the challenge strain was isolated from the mesenteric lymph nodes of the same two calves. However the challenge strain was never detected in other organs or in heart blood. In summary, bovine EHEC strain 340S89 belonging to serotype O118:H16 and isolated from a calf with diarrhoea, was able to induce diarrhoea and to produce AE lesion in newborn calves. Presence of other infectious diarrhoeagenic agents can influence the severity and the length of the diarrhoea. This model can be used for further challenge experiments to study the role of the different genes of the LEE and of VT1 in the pathogenesis of bovine EHEC strains and to study the host specificity of EHEC strains belonging to the same serotype and isolated from both cattle and humans.",
