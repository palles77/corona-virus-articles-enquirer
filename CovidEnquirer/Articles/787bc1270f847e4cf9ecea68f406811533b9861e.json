Using broader inclusion criteria not limited to patients with AECB (ie, using all patients with chronic bronchitis as a primary or secondary diagnosis), Wilson et al25 estimated the cost of chronic bronchitis in the United States at $12 billion per year.

Although the direct medical cost data analyses performed to date have been rather sophisticated, further work is necessary to better quantify the direct nonmedical and indirect costs of AECB.

Thus, the advantage of a treatment that will significantly delay a future exacerbation, independent of the cure rate of the index episode, is obvious. If the DFI differs significantly among available therapies, the effects on clinical outcomes and resource use would be substantial given the recurrent nature of AECB.46 Thus, an antibiotic could prove to be beneficial not only based on its success or failure rates during the incident AECB episode, but also on its effect on the DFI.",

Because patients with AECB may fail initial therapy or experience relapses after initial therapy is prescribed, the clinical and economic consequences of antibiotic therapy depend on subsequent diagnostic and treatment decisions that occur over the entire natural course of the disease. Given the recurring nature of chronic bronchitis, evaluation of treatments as they are prescribed during the course of disease, instead of a single exacerbation, will likely yield more accurate cost-effectiveness data. Analyses that compare antibiotics directly (first-line antibiotic vs second-line antibiotic) may not reflect actual clinical practice, since available alternatives are often used in sequence (ie, if the first-line antibiotic fails, then a second-line antibiA otic is used). The most cost-effective firstline antibiotic agent for AECB, consequently, does not depend entirely on the differences in bronchitis cure rates and treatment costs at the time of use, but also on the variation in patients' symptomatic response and resultant likelihood of future bronchitis-related health care expenditures. Economic analyses of AECB should consider the recurring nature of the condition and account for several treatment changes over an appropriate time period.",
