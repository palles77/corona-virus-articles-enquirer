We aimed to determine the IC and OH resources available and compare this with HCWs' perception of resources, following an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

Both OH and IC were under-resourced post-SARS, with OH professionals particularly lacking in British Columbia. There is a discrepancy between HCWs' perception of what is available Introduction Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian influenza and the increasing awareness of other new or changing pathogens (e.g. Clostridium difficile, monkeypox) have highlighted the importance of adequate and accessible infection prevention and control resources, and have emphasised the importance of a well-prepared and properly protected workforce at the front lines of patient care. Previous work established the importance of environmental, organisational and individual factors in the adoption of safe work practices amongst healthcare workers (HCWs) but few studies have critically audited the resources available to infection control (IC) and occupational health (OH) services in order to promote safe practice. 1e6 In addition, it is known that communication and 'feeling safe' are important determinants of willingness to provide care in outbreak situations. 7 Yet we are aware of no studies to date that have examined how well perceptions of adequacy of safety measures compare with more objective assessments in this regard.",

The occupational hygienist performed an observational walk-through audit at each facility after receiving initial training on observational techniques from a pilot hospital site. An infection control practitioner (ICP) accompanied the occupational hygienist through three critical areas in the facility to validate observations: the emergency department (ER), general medicine units (including a respiratory unit if present) and the intensive care unit (ICU).

Analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS, version 12.0, Chicago, IL, USA). All tests of significance were based on two-sided hypotheses at P 0.05. Table I compares the IC and OH resources in GVR hospitals as compared to the four hospitals in Toronto that admitted SARS patients. In British Columbia, the median infection control practitioner (ICP)/bed ratio was 1 ICP/175 beds (range: 1 ICP/32 beds to 1 ICP/809 beds). In Ontario the average ratio was 1 ICP/90 beds (range: 1 ICP/62 beds to 1 ICP/135 beds) (P \u00bc 0.014). No significant differences were noted in whether there was a dedicated ICP for each hospital site, whether they were available after regular working hours, the number of ICPs that were certified or whether training was available to ICPs. No significant differences were seen in the average ratio of IC officer (ICO) to bed between British Columbia and Ontario hospitals. In British Columbia, two hospitals reported no dedicated ICO. No significant difference was noted regarding the availability of an ICO after regular working hours. A total of 15 of the 16 facilities surveyed in British Columbia (94%) had after-hours IC coverage, whereas 100% of Ontario hospitals surveyed did. However, it should be noted that in the GVR there is only one part-time OH physician covering all the hospitals reporting access to an occupational physician. In the GTA facilities, one facility reported no OH physician and the three that had an OH physician reported a range of availability from a 0.1 FTE to a 0.4 FTE. Table II details the results of the independent observational audit by the units surveyed, across the two provinces. Of note were the similar availabilities of gloves, gowns and masks across the two provinces. Although the differences were not significant, overall protective eyewear was not readily available in the majority of GVR hospitals and the crash carts on the selected units audited were inadequately stocked with personal protective gear in both the GVR and Toronto facilities. Table III compares 'like items' between the questionnaire administered to HCWs and the workplace assessments conducted by OH and IC in the GVR. A total of 1290 HCWs responded to the worker questionnaire, administered at the 16 facilities in the GVR. A total of 80% of the respondents were female. The occupations that responded consisted of: 18% ICU nurses, 19% ER nurses, 36% general medicine nurses, 9% physicians, 9% respiratory therapists and 10% physiotherapists. Questions regarding on-site plans to mitigate against SARS and biological agents received high responses of agreement from staff (i.e. they believe they exist) but scored lower marks from facilities as to their actual existence. The inverse occurred when dealing with staff fit-testing for respirators: facilities unanimously agreed (100% across all sizes of facilities) that workers had been fit-tested but workers themselves did not agree that they had been fit-tested (60.1% of HCWs in small facilities, 72.9% in medium and 78.2% in large facilities responded 'yes' they had been fit-tested). The discrepancy between staff perception and institutional reporting was aptly demonstrated when both HCWs and OH professionals were asked about compliance on baseline OH assessments performed at time of hiring. In small facilities only 33% of OH professionals said that they had completed the required OH assessments regarding vaccination of HCWs but in the same small facilities 67.6% of HCWs said that they had had the assessment done. This pattern continued across the medium and large facilities (82.3% and 20%, and 81.7% and 60%, respectively).",

The SARS epidemic increased the profile of IC and OH and directed public attention to infectious disease transmission in healthcare facilities. Protection from infectious diseases was put 'under the spotlight', and HCWs became more motivated to request advice on appropriate use of personal protective equipment and isolation policies. Subsequent inquiries that identified gaps in IC and OH resources and further refinement of policies and procedures post-SARS should have improved the status quo. 18e21 It was hypothesised by the investigators that three years after the SARS outbreak, IC and OH programmes would be well-resourced and no differences would be found between resources available for these programmes in selected Toronto facilities compared with those in the GVR. The results of this study do not support this hypothesis. IC and OH resources, in the GVR in particular, had fewer staff than those in Toronto. On average, British Columbia hospitals had approximately half the IC staff available when compared with the Toronto hospitals that housed SARS patients and far below the benchmarks set by SENIC and the Public Health Agency of Canada. 4, 22 Unfortunately there has been no benchmark setting for OH resources in Canadian hospitals. This study found a significant difference in the OH resources available in the Ontario hospitals surveyed as compared to the British Columbia hospitals. Three times as many occupational health nurses were found in Ontario hospitals. The reasons for this large difference are unknown but this is an area where further investigation is needed, particularly as several studies have shown the costeffectiveness of injury prevention programmes and employee education. 23 Personal protective equipment was generally available at all facilities, but it was noted during the independent observational assessment that protective eyewear was not readily available to staff members in the majority of clinical areas in GVR hospitals surveyed. This is a concern as the use of protective eyewear is recommended as part of the personal protective equipment that should be donned when providing care to patients with a communicable disease capable of being transmitted by droplets or during procedures where there is a generation of aerosolised droplets. The routine use of eye protection may not have been adopted into the routine practice of HCWs in British Columbia as it has been in Ontario. During the SARS outbreak in 2003, IC directives included the use of eye protection as part of the personal protective equipment to be worn during providing care to a patient with febrile respiratory illness. In British Columbia, use of protective eyewear was recommended but, because only four SARS cases occurred, HCWs may not be aware of the recommendations. As was noted in the Results section, even though other personal protective equipment (gloves, gowns and respirators) are available, there is no indication that there is compliance with their use among HCWs or if they are used correctly. This is an area for further study.",

            "text": "One of the more interesting facets of this study was the discrepancy between staff perception and institutional reporting as to the availability of resources for HCWs. The actual existence of protocols for SARS or SARS-like illness and exposure to biological agents was perceived by HCWs to exist, but in fact this varied widely across the facilities, with the smaller facilities less likely to have formal protocols. In contrast, OH services believed that most HCWs requiring fit-testing had completed this task, while HCWs noted that this was far from true. Incomplete baseline OH assessments were noted by OH personnel for the majority of staff, yet HCWs believed that their documentation was complete. HCWs believed that ICPs were not available during lunchtime and that ICOs were not available after hours. These personnel were, in fact, available at these times. Importantly, approximately one-third of HCWs did not know that there were mechanisms to provide feedback to OH services, nor were they clear on availability of IC services after hours.",

            "text": "Three years post-SARS, IC and OH remain poorly resourced in terms of professional staff and the availability of barriers in high-risk situations is still limited, particularly in British Columbia. This may be due, in part, to the fact that SARS did not have as significant an impact on these healthcare facilities. There were 251 probable cases of SARS in Canada during the outbreak (247 cases in Ontario, four cases in British Columbia) and 44 deaths (all in Ontario). Of these, 109 cases were in HCWs, making SARS, at least in Canada, primarily an occupationally acquired disease. 24 Importantly, there was a discrepancy between what HCWs perceive to be available and what is actually accessible in the healthcare facility, indicating an area where communication between the experts in IC and OH and the HCWs could be improved. The perception of HCWs that expertise and resources were indeed available even when they were not is particularly disconcerting, as perception of safety is a strong determinant of safety climate and willingness to work and comply with safety measures. This is important as concerns regarding the potential for pandemic influenza have recently been emphasised. With a potential pandemic on the horizon, serious examination of IC and occupational medical expertise as well as related personnel and other resources in healthcare facilities are warranted. Healthcare worker perception of safety in regards to communicable diseases needs to be made a reality.",
