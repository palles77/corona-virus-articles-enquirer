In their first years of life children are receptive to obstructive airway diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of redecoration of the apartment on airway symptoms in infants during the first two years of life. The Leipzig Allergy Risk Children Study (LARS) is a birth cohort study with the following inclusion criteria: double positive family atopy anamnesis, cord blood IgE > 0.9 kU/l, or low birth weight between 1500 \u00b1 2500 g. Within the context of LARS, 186 parents of risk children completed a questionnaire on the respiratory symptoms of their children and the redecoration of their apartment at the end of the first and second year of life. A total 22% of the children suffered from obstructive bronchitis once or more during their first year, and 11% experienced this condition during their second year of life. Redecoration of the apartment had a significant influence on the appearance of obstructive bronchitis in the first (OR 4.1 95%CI 1.4 \u00b1 11.9) and in the second year of life (OR 4.2 95%CI 1.4 \u00b1 12.9). (The OR are adjusted for cord blood-IgE > 0.9 kU/l, birth weight 2500 g, male sex and double positive parental atopy anamnesis, dampness, smoking or pet in the apartment). Simultaneous contamination from redecoration activities and additional exposures such as smoking, a pet or dampness in the apartment increased the risk for obstructive bronchitis in the first year (OR 9.1; 95% CI 2.3 \u00b1 34.8) as well as in the second year (OR 5.1; 95%CI 1.6 \u00b1 15.6). Our data suggest that redecoration of the apartment is associated with the development of acute inflammations, but not with a chronic influence on the airways in atopy risk infants. At an exposure to more than one environmental factor, pronounced effects were seen.",

Indoor air quality is partly characterized by a variety of VOCs in relatively low concentrations (Seifert et al. 1986 ). Human activities such as home decoration (Wolkoff 1999 , Wieslander et al. 1997 or smoking (Wallace et al. 1987) typically increase the concentration of VOCs in indoor air. Wieslander et al. (1997) found that in apartments redecorated during the previous year total VOCs had been elevated by an average amount of 100 mg/m 3 . Increased VOC concentrations in indoor air could lead to inflammatory reactions in the mucous membranes of the airways (Molhave et al. 1986 ).",

In a multiple logistic model recurrent wheezing in the first two years was neither influenced by atopy anamneses of the parents nor by elevated cord-blood IgE (Bergmann et al. 1997) . Only male sex was found to be a significant risk factor for wheezing as it was found in our study. Young et al. (2000) reported a 1.5 \u00b1 2 times higher incidence of obstructive airway illnesses for boys which can be explained by the smaller size of their airways at birth compared with girls (Stocks 1999) . The frequency of obstructive bronchitis in our study group decreased from the first (22%) to the second (11%) year of life. This finding can be caused by the growth of the airways and/or by the increasing outdoor stays of two-year-old children. It is somewhat difficult to compare the prevalence of bronchitis symptoms of our infants with findings of other studies, because the results depend on the selection criteria of the investigated collective and the respective definitions of bronchitis and asthma which both may be different. According to the German Multicenter Atopy Study (Bergmann et al. 1994 ), 15% of two-year-old atopy-risk children suffer from recurrent wheezing.",

Redecoration during pregnancy, however, had no influence on subsequent obstructive airway infections during the course of the following time of the first or second year of life. On the other hand, redecoration of the apartment was of influence on symptoms within the corresponding year. Apparently redecoration activities have a short to middle term effect on the airways of children in their first years of life. The use of paints on large walls as well as installing floor coverings and new furniture produce an increased concentration of various volatile organic compounds in the indoor air, such as alkanes, styrene, toluene, or pinene (Wieslander et al. 1997 , Hoffmann et al. 2000 , Diez et al. 2000 . Increased VOC concentrations in the indoor air can have an irritating effect on the epithelium of the airways (Molhave 1991) . They can also increase the inflammatory reaction of the airway epithelium or create an environment favorable for infections by inhibiting the mucociliary clearance. This effect is known in the case of exposure to tobacco smoke (Li et al. 1999) .",

VOCs released during redecoration work could still have an unfavorable long-term effect on the development of obstructive airway illnesses via another pathophysiological mechanism. VOCs enter the body through the lungs and are absorbed by the blood (Ashley et al. 1996) . They may influence the immune regulation of TH-cells. A trend toward a reduction in TH1-cells which produce INF-g as well as an increase of the share of TH2-cells which produce IL4 was observed in 3-year-old children in association with raised VOC concentrations (C6 \u00b1 C12-alkanes, benzene, ethyl benzene, xylene, ethyl toluene, chlorobenzene) in indoor air (Lehmann et al. 2001) .",

Emenius et al. (2001) achieved a similar result in the BAMSE study, where the combined contamination of indoor air due to painting work in the children's bedroom, a family member who smokes, and increased dampness in the apartment raised the risk for asthma in two-year-old children to OR 3.5 (CI 1.38 \u00b1 8.95).",

It should be recommended for small children not to stay in recently redecorated rooms for many hours, e.g. over night. The question of whether this has a long-term negative influence, insofar as it might promote the appearance of asthma or chronic obstructive airway illnesses in later years, should be clarified by further studies.",
