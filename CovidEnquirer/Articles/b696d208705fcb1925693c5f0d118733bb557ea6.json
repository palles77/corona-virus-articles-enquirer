Significant associations (at nominal level; p<0.05) was also observed across multiple datasets, with different analytic methods, and for both type I and II diabetes.

The database was retrieved via the R package \"TwoSampleMR\" (ver 0.5.1). MR analysis was conducted with the same package. Due to the extremely huge number of traits in the database, we performed some pre-selection to the list of traits/diseases before full analysis. Briefly, we selected the following categories of traits: (1) Traits listed as priority 1 (high priority) and labelled as \"Disease\" or \"Risk factor\" (81 and 71 items respectively); (2) traits labelled as \"protein\" as described above (3371 items); (3) (selected) traits from the UK Biobank, as it is one of the largest source of GWAS data worldwide (with sample size ~ 500,000). We consider that a proportion of traits have presumably low prior probability of association with respiratory infections, and others are less directly clinically relevant. To reduce computational burden and for ease of interpretation, a proportion of UK Biobank (UKBB) traits were filtered. More specifically, we excluded GWAS data of diseases or traits related to the following: eye or hearing problems, orthopedic and trauma-related conditions (except autoimmune diseases), skin problems (except systemic or autoimmune diseases), perinatal and obstetric problems, operation history, medication history (as confounding by indication is common and may affect the validity of results 22 ), diet/exercise habit (as accuracy of information .

Of note, MR-Egger gives valid estimates of causal effects in the presence of imbalanced or directional horizontal pleiotropy. In addition, significance of the MR-Egger intercept can be used to judge whether significant imbalanced pleiotropy is present. MR was performed on (approximately) independent SNPs with r 2 threshold of 0.001, following default settings in TwoSampleMR. We only included SNPs passing genome-wide significance (p<5e-8) as instruments. For exposure with only one instrument, the Wald ratio method was used. For analysis with less than 3 genetic instruments, we employed MR-IVW since MR-Egger cannot be reliably performed. As will be detailed in the results section, for selected trait(s) with stronger evidence of association, we also performed further analysis by GSMR and MR-RAPS.

Nevertheless, the consequences of altered ACE2 expression may be rather complex. Kuba et al. reported that the Spike protein of the SARS-CoV down-modulated ACE2 expression 10 , which may lead to heightened risks of acute lung injury. Another study 41 suggested ACE2 may protect against acute pulmonary failure by blocking the renin-angiotensin signaling pathway. However, whether the same may apply to 2019-nCov is still unknown. If this is the case, then one may hypothesize that for unaffected individuals or those without (or with minimal) lung involvement yet (as could be the case for some subjects at the early stage of disease), a lower level of ACE2 expression on lung cells may be beneficial in reducing susceptibility to more sustained infection by reducing viral entry. However, for patients with severe lung involvement or at risk of acute lung injury, higher level of ACE2 expression may prevent risk of acute lung failure. Therefore, it may be clinically relevant to identify both types of drugs, i.e. those leading to elevated ACE2 expression as well as those leading to reduced expression. Further studies are warranted to clarify the role of ACE2 and whether drugs targeting ACE2 may be therapeutically useful.",

We briefly discuss a few drugs highlighted by our analysis. Fostamatinib targets the largest number (seven) of proteins potentially linked to ACE2 expression. According to DrugBank, it serves as an inhibitor for all these proteins, and all were linked to elevated ACE2 expression in the present MR analysis except one. This drug has been approved for treating Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP), and is a spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor 42 . There has been trials on rheumatoid arthritis (RA) 43 and IgA nephropathy as well 42 .",

            "text": "Interestingly, recent studies by the company BenevolentAI 44,45 employed a proprietary knowledge graph approach and found several repositioning candidates 46, 47 . Baricitinib, a JAK 1/2 inhibitor approved for RA, was suggested as a top candidate. The drug was proposed on its action on AAK1 which is a regulator of endocytosis, although how AAK1 was prioritized as target was not described in the study. Fostamatinib, which we prioritized in this study, also inhibits JAK1, JAK2 and AAK1 48 based on curations from DrugBank and was shown to be effective for RA 43 . Of note, two other JAK-STAT signaling inhibitors were recommended by Stebbing et al. 45 , while in our analysis JAK-STAT signaling is among the top 10 pathways enriched for top proteins linked to ACE2 expression. Another candidate highlighted by Richardson et al. 44 , sunitinib, was also top-listed by our MR-based analysis. We have employed a rather different algorithm based on causal inference, when compared to the approach by BenevolentAI. The concordance between different studies provides additional support to the usefulness our MR-based approach, and the drugs with converging evidence by different approaches may be more likely to be true candidates. Zinc was also a top-listed candidate in our study, and it has been reported to reduce the risk of lower respiratory tract infections in some studies, e.g. 49 , although further studies are required as the evidence is not firm.",

We note that a number of drugs may act on more than one target, but the exact pharmacological action on each target is often unclear; the overall direction and magnitude of effect of each drug may not be easily determined and must be verified in further studies. We emphasize that the drugs highlighted in this work are meant to prioritize suitable candidates to speed up discovery for treatments, and are not supposed to be applied to clinical practice or trials yet.
