Here, we analyze the patterns of inflammatory cytokines, procalcitonin (PCT), and C-reactive protein (CRP) in order to determine fl their diagnostic value. Methods: This was a prospective study of 658 patients admitted with CAP. PCT and CRP were analyzed by immunoluminometric and immunoturbidimetric assays. Cytokines (tumor necrosis factor-a [TNF-a ], IL-1 b, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10) were measured using enzyme immunoassay. Results: The lowest medians of CRP, PCT, TNF-a, and IL-6 were found in CAP of unknown cause, and the highest were found in patients with positive blood cultures. Different cytokine profiles fi and biomarkers were found depending on cause: atypical bacteria (lower PCT and IL-6), viruses (lower PCT and higher IL-10), Enterobacteriaceae (higher IL-8), Streptococcus pneumoniae (high PCT), and Legionella pneumophila (higher CRP and TNF-a). PCT \u0546 0.36 mg/dL to predict positive blood cultures showed sensitivity of 85%, specifi city of 42%, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 98%, whereas a cutoff of \u0545 0.5 mg/dL to predict viruses or atypicals vs bacteria showed sensitivity of 89%/81%, specifi city of 68%/68%, positive predictive value of 12%/22%, and NPV of 99%/97%. In a multivariate Euclidean distance model, the lowest infl ammatory expression fl was found in unknown cause and the highest was found in L pneumophila, S pneumoniae , and Enterobacteriaceae. Atypical bacteria exhibit an infl ammatory pattern closer to that of viruses. Conclusions: Different infl ammatory patterns elicited by different microorganisms may provide a useful tool for diagnosis. Recognizing these patterns provides additional information that may facilitate a broader understanding of host infl ammatory response to microorganisms.",

The ciliated epithelium, alveolar macrophages, and neutrophils are able to destroy and remove pathogenic agents and prevent the progression of tissue invasion. 1, 2 When the innate response is overcome, local reactions, with activation of cytokines and infl ammatory markers, promote a specific fi immune response against the microorganism. 2 This reaction is not limited to the lungs; there is also a systemic response that has repercussions on the course of the infection and its outcome. 1, 3, 4 Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is the leading cause of mortality due to infection in developed countries. 5 The host infl ammatory response is crucial fl to fi ghting the microorganism, and that interplay determines the outcome. Nevertheless, the mechanisms that trigger activation of the cytokine cascade and its different patterns (responsible for the outcome) are not suffi ciently understood. An exuberant systemic activation of cytokines has been associated with a poorer outcome, although in some patients it is an adequate response, suggesting that this feature is far from understood. 6 Kellum et al 6 pointed out the Cytokines, PCT, and CRP Blood samples were taken the morning after admission, and the serum was frozen at 280\u00b0C. Determination of IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 and TNF-a was made using an enzyme immunoassay (Biosource). Limits of detection were 3 pg/mL for TNF-a , 2 pg/mL for IL-6, 0.7 pg/mL for IL-8, and 1 pg/mL for IL-10. PCT was measured using an immunoluminometric technique (Liason Brahms PCT) with a detection limit of 0.3 ng/mL and CRP using an immunoturbidimetric test (Bayer Diagnostics) with a detection limit of 1.5 mg/dL.",

Hedlund and Hansson 3 also reported lower PCT in atypical bacteria and/or viruses, with no differences in CRP. Our data confi rm that PCT \u05450.5 provides high sensitivity and NPV for viral and/or atypical causes. Kr\u00fcger Prior use of antibiotics reduced the levels of PCT and cytokines, mainly IL-6 and IL-10, suggesting that the infl ammatory phase was beginning to be downregulated. 11, 17 We consider that PCT-guided antibiotic prescription in CAP requires extreme caution in patients with prior antibiotic treatment because it could underestimate bacterial cause, 9, 10 and even in those without prior antibiotics it would appear that a low PCT has insuffi cient NPV to exclude pathogens. NPV (94%). We found that higher levels of TNF-a and IL-6 in L pneumophila had a high NPV compared with S pneumoniae. PCT and IL-8 showed different patterns among bacteria: higher IL-8 and lower PCT in gram-negative vs gram-positive germs. However, the clinical relevance of these findings fi has yet to be demonstrated, and it is possible that, for diag nostic purposes, several markers will be required. 16 as Toll-like receptor-9 in the case of L pneumophila , Toll-like receptor-4 in gram-negative bacteria, and Toll-like receptor-2 in gram-positive bacteria.
