However, the clinical importance of these findings in relation to symptoms is not known. Objectives: The seasonal fluctuations of respiratory viruses and the clinical outcomes of single infections and dual infections were investigated. Study design: Nasal aspirate samples were obtained from outpatients and inpatients of a children's hospital and these samples were subjected to real-time PCR to detect 16 respiratory viruses. Seasonal variations of the 16 viruses and the clinical outcomes such as wheezing, the need for oxygenation and prolonged hospitalization of patients with single viral infections and multiple infections were determined for the 5 most often detected viruses. Results: Among 512 specimens analyzed, one or more viruses were detected in 424 (83%) specimens. Two or more viruses were detected in 160 samples (31% of all samples). The epidemic peaks of the viruses did not coincide with each other. Rhinoviruses were the most frequently detected viruses and their coinfection rates were also higher. However, the disease severity in the lower respiratory tract did not differ in most respiratory viral infections regardless of whether there was single infection or dual infection with a rhinovirus and other respiratory virus. Conclusions: Seasonal distribution was seen for each virus. There were no significant differences in clinical symptoms in the children studied. Because the infection of rhinoviruses is the common occurrence in children, it is hypothesized that the factors related to disease severity are mainly the underlying conditions of the children.",

Briefly, nucleic acids were extracted from 200 L specimens using the Magtration System with a MagDEA viral DNA/RNA 200 kit (Precision System Science Co., Ltd., Chiba, Japan) with a 50 L elution volume. RT reactions were performed using a ReverTra Ace qPCR RT kit (Toyobo Co., Ltd., Osaka, Japan) following the manufacturer's instructions. The cDNA was then amplified using Realtime PCR Master Mix (Toyobo) with a total volume of 25 L. The sensitivity of each of the realtime PCR methods was reported previously [10] . Enteroviruses and rhinoviruses were genotyped by direct sequencing. Amplification of the VP4/VP2 region of the enterovirus or rhinovirus for typing was performed with semi-nested RT-PCR as previously described [11] . The purified PCR products were subjected to direct sequencing with a BigDye Terminator v1.1 kit as per the manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). Sequence analysis was performed using the DNADynamo program (Blue Tractor Software, UK). Using MEGA5.2 (Tamura et al., 2011, Ver5.2.2), we employed the neighbor-joining method [12] to construct phylogenetic trees from the VP4/VP2 region (420 nt) sequences of prototype isolates of each rhinovirus type commonly used in epidemiologic studies of human rhinoviruses retrieved from GenBank [13] [14] [15] and new types proposed previously [13, 16, 17] .

The reason may be that our method had many detection targets. Furthermore, the higher detection rates among young children likely correspond to the higher incidence of viral respiratory tract infections in children, although other factors such as pre-existing immunity might also have played a role [4] . Since the specimens from children aged 1 year or younger accounted for 68% of those studied, it is considered that the rate of viral detection and the rate of concurrent infections became higher than in past reference data. The largest number of viruses detected in one sample was 5 in the nasal aspirate from a 9-month-old girl. When comparing the number of viruses detected per specimen, it was found that the specimens from younger patients tended to include more than one virus (data not shown).",

It has been suggested that rhinovirus infections could reduce subsequent RS virus and influenza virus type A infections by inducing an interferon response, thereby creating an undesirable environment for these viruses [21, 22] .

Though there was no significant difference in the number of hospitalization days of patients with single infections by rhinoviruses or other respiratory viruses, our data suggested the importance of rhinoviruses as a potential cause of pediatric pneumonia. Recently, our group evaluated the prevalence of rhinovirus infections among asymptomatic children [10] . Rhinoviruses were often detected in their throats at a time without any symptoms. Since rhinoviruses do not exist in the upper respiratory tract for a long time even if a child does not show symptoms, these were \"active\" asymptomatic infections rather than persistent infections.",
