I tried to say at the end of my talk the main problems are getting reliable animals and keeping them in proper conditions. I hope, Mr. Chairman, I made it very clear that I think there are now reliable sources of animals which are free from infectious disease; that we know basically how to keep our laboratory animals in toxicological laboratories; and, therefore, there should be no great expense for this health monitoring. You should meet these two basic questions head on: get reliable animals and keep them properly.",
