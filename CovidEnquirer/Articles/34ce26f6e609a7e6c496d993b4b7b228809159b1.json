The guidelines were less precise allowing significant leeway in the interpretation, which led to high degree of variability between providers in defining when a patient had pneumonia.

The new VAP definition has defined qualitative and quantitative values of neutrophil count and colony-forming units that must be met to establish possible-VAP and probable-VAP. The second of the four pulmonary criteria vaguely defined worsening gas exchange. However, these criteria were described as desaturations, increased oxygen requirements, or increased ventilator demand but did not define the increment or duration of time. In comparison the diagnosis of VAP is contingent on the patient having met the criteria of a VAC. The VAC criteria clearly establish minimum increases in FIO 2 and/or PEEP and stipulate the duration of time relative to a previous period of stability and to the diagnosis of VAP. The two remaining pulmonary criteria for PNU1 were comprised of patient symptoms: worsening cough, dyspnea, or tachypnea; and patient examination findings, such as rales or bronchial breath sounds.

One of the first studies to evaluate how the surveillance criteria for VAE could be used to identify patient complications used retrospective data collected from three academic medical centers in different regions of the United States. Each unit submitted 100 patients that were mechanically ventilated 2 to 7 days and 100 patients that ventilated for greater than 7 days. Each patient was independently assessed using the VAC criteria and according to the PNU1 definition. This study demonstrated that patients who met criteria for VAC and PNU1 had a longer duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU LOS, and hospital LOS. VAC diagnosis was associated with increased mortality, whereas PNU1 diagnosis was not, and VAC assessment was considerably less time consuming for the assessors to perform compared with evaluation with the PNU1 criteria. 3 Another early study performed in 11 ICUs in Canada and the United States prospectively evaluated 1320 patients using VAC, IVAC, and PNU1 criteria. 4 This study demonstrated that patients meeting criteria for VAC and IVAC had increased mortality compared with patients diagnosed with VAP using PNU1. The results also highlight the importance of the subjective surveillance definition, because there was a poor correlation agreement between patients that met the criteria for VAC or IVAC and patients diagnosed with VAP using the PNU1 definition. Similarly, another retrospective study from a tertiary, teaching hospital in Australia evaluated 543 patients intubated greater than or equal to 2 days, using the VAC surveillance criteria, and demonstrated patients with VAC had increased duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU LOS, and duration of antibiotic therapy. 5 In 2014, a group from the Netherlands published results from a prospective evaluation of the EMR from patients in two tertiary care centers from 2011 to 2012. This study reviewed ventilator settings, microbiology, and clinical data from 2080 patients who were mechanically ventilated for greater than 2 consecutive days. In addition to screening the EMR with the VAE surveillance criteria, the authors also developed clinical definition of prospective VAP, which used the VAE criteria for possible-VAP and the radiographic evidence from PNU1. The results of this study demonstrated that patients with VAC diagnosis have an increased mortality compared with those without Table 2 . VAC. This was similar to the patients diagnosed with prospective VAP. VAE surveillance criteria only detected 32% of prospectively diagnosed VAP. 6 The Dutch study was the first to demonstrate the complexity involved in applying the surveillance criteria to EMR data. The authors identified that using the minimum FIO 2 and PEEP settings recorded daily in the respiratory flow-rows frequently identified the values recorded during the spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) and were not the true baseline levels of oxygen support. Transitions from the FIO 2 and PEEP during SBT back to the baseline levels when patient completed their trial but were not extubated resulted in an erroneous identification of VAE. The authors realized that establishing a surveillance programs that does not accommodate for similar variations in support will likely result in overestimating patients with respiratory deterioration and can significantly effect VAE reporting.",

            "text": "Two large retrospective studies were published in 2014 that used automated data analysis to review the EMR of patients, based on VAE surveillance criteria, and provide descriptive epidemiology of VAE. The first study reviewed the charts of 20,356 mechanically ventilated patients and found a low overall rate of VAC (5.6%) with low rates of IVAC (2.1%) and even lower rates of possible-(0.7%) and probable-VAP (0.6%). The median day to the onset of VAC was 6, and was more common in medical, surgical, and thoracic units. 7 The other study reviewed the records from 10,998 patients and identified a lower overall rate of VAE (3%). This study focused on the reliability of automated data evaluation compared with manual extraction. The automated method of identifying VAE was more reliable than using a human abstractor. Both studies demonstrated patients with VAE had longer duration of mechanical ventilation, hospital LOS, and mortality compared with patients without VAE, and suggest in their discussions that the future performance improvement initiatives should be targeted on the prevention of VAE rather than VAP. 8 One of the important selling points of the new VAE surveillance criteria is that it is based on objectivity and eliminates subjective criteria, thus reducing variability and increases validity of data and outcomes. Several recently published studies have argued that the nested definitions of possible-VAP and probable-VAP underperform, because they do not account for radiographic findings common in patients with VAP. 9,10 Lilly and colleagues 9 reviewed the charts of 8408 mechanically ventilated patients and identified a total of 83 incidences of clinical VAP. In this group, 27 patients met criteria for VAC, which means most patients (n 5 56) that were diagnosed with clinical pneumonia in this study did not have any evidence of increased oxygen requirements. An even smaller number of patients in this cohort had either qualitative (possible-VAP, n 5 18) or quantitative (probable-VAP, n 5 4) microbiologic data supporting the VAP diagnosis. Another study by Chang and colleagues 10 demonstrated similar results; only one-third of the 165 episodes of clinically diagnosed VAP would have met VAC criteria with even fewer possible-VAP (12.1%) and probable-VAP (1.2%). Although this study demonstrated that patients with VAC had higher mortality than patients with clinical VAP, it is one of the few that demonstrates patients with possible-and probable-VAP have increased hospital mortality compared with the patients with clinical VAP.",

Probable-VAP and possible-VAP accounted for 44.1% and 17.6% of the IVACs, whereas the remaining cases did not have microbiologic data to delineate the cause. This study also attempted to determine which cases of VAC were preventable. Two investigators reviewed each case and identified cases where medical error contributed to the respiratory complication or whether the VAC was a result of the patient's underlying disease process. They determined that 25 (37.3%) were potentially preventable events. 11 The other study was a large retrospective review of 16 years of data from a French national ICU database (OUTCOMEREA). This study evaluated the data for patients who were intubated a minimum of 5 consecutive days. They identified 3028 patients, 77% of them had VAC and 29% had IVAC. Patients with either possible-VAP or probable-VAP accounted for only 14.5% of VAC events and only 27.6% of the IVAC events. Other significant causes of VAC and IVAC were attributed to other nosocomial infections, failed extubation requiring reintubation, derecruitment during patient transport, and overresuscitation. The authors attribute the high rate of VAC to the study group; patients that require mechanical ventilation a minimum of 5 days are higher risk for adverse events. Both of these studies are important because they begin to characterize the frequent causes of respiratory deterioration in mechanically ventilated patients. By understanding how VACs occur clinicians can identify methods to prevent future events. 12 These 15 studies discussed in this review are concisely summarized in Table 2 . The studies are organized in alphabetical order by first author for each year published. The study design, patient population, and type of institution or database used and a succinct description of the each study findings are included. Additionally, the rates of the different categories of VAE identified for each study are presented. Four studies used the clinical definition of pneumonia to calculate their rate of VAP and are included in the table for comparison. The cumulative number of patients that were diagnosed with VAC, iVAC, possible-and probable-VAP from the studies that evaluated patients using the new NHSN VAE criteria is presented in Fig. 2 . The sizes of the circles are proportional to the percentage of patients that meet the different categories of VAE. The total number of patients evaluated using VAE criteria was 33,276. VAC was diagnosed in 1808 (5.4%) of the patients and of these patients 738 (2.2%) met the iVAC criteria. The total number of patients with either possible-or probable-VAP was 458, representing 1.5% of all mechanically ventilated patients.",

            "text": "Although the NHSN surveillance definition of VAE has been shown to be an effective method of characterizing respiratory deterioration, several areas may require further clarification. The current definition requires a 2-day period of stability with subsequent sustained increases in either PEEP or FIO 2 . This requirement necessarily eliminates any patient with a primary process that adversely affects the pulmonary status at the time of admission to the ICU. Stoeppel and colleagues 14 demonstrated a large number of surgery patients (77%) were excluded from meeting VAE criteria, because they never had a period of stability before their respiratory deterioration. In these patients, this deterioration was an evolution of their inciting process. Similarly, several studies have discussed that VAE criteria does not account for airway pressure release ventilation or similar modes that do not use PEEP, which results in underreporting the number of patients that would otherwise have VAE. 11, 14, 15 Potential solutions that would accommodate the use of these modes would be to include increasing requirements of mean airway pressure or potentially using changes in the P/ ratio. Although the goal of tracking VAE may be to track and trend preventable causes of respiratory failure; it is important for the surveillance criteria to have the broadest view including modes that directly affect the mean airway pressure so as to capture all events so that even these patterns of care may be analyzed for possible improvement.",

In these studies, the possible-VAP and probable-VAP identified using the VAE surveillance criteria were compared with clinical pneumonias. Frequently the clinical pneumonias were characterized using a hybrid of the objective probable-/possible-VAP criteria but allows the inclusion of the subjective radiographic criteria of PNU1. The comparisons have demonstrated that using the objective VAE surveillance criteria to identify pneumonia correlates poorly with the diagnosis of clinical pneumonia. Nearly all of the studies demonstrated that ventilator days, ICU LOS, and hospital LOS correlates more closely with VAC compared with clinical VAP. These findings support the decision of NHSN to place emphasis on identifying the broader range of VAEs even at the expense of missing some clinical VAPs.",

The Wake Up and Breathe Collaborative study evaluated how adherence to spontaneous awakening trials (SATs) and SBTs affects the incidence of VAE and VAP. 16 This collaborative was really an education initiative that prospectively tracked the incidence of daily SAT, SBT, and VAEs in participating ICUs over 2 years from 2011 to 2013. Each participating ICU designated a physician, nurse, and respiratory therapist to champion the education and data collection. The results of the study were impressive. Initial compliance with SAT and SBT in most centers was low but through the course of the study rates of daily SAT and SBT significantly improved while the rate of VAC and IVAC per episode of mechanical ventilation was significantly decreased. During the study, the duration of mechanical ventilation decreased by 2.4 days, ICU LOS by 3.0 days, and hospital LOS by 6.3 days. There were no changes in the rate of hospital morality or VAP. Not surprisingly, the rate of self-extubations per episode of mechanical ventilation increased but there was no change in the rate of reintubation within 24 hours. This paper brings to the forefront VAP is not an adequate surrogate for quality. Dr Klompas, the architect of the new criteria, outlines future efforts directed at minimizing VAE in a recent review. 16 He summarizes several strategies to reduce or prevent VAEs. Intrinsic to the efforts are approaches that minimize the duration of mechanic ventilation and coincide with the Society of Critical Care Medicine's initiative Awakening, Breathing, Coordination, Delirium monitoring/management and Early exercise/ mobility bundle. This bundle has been shown to improve patient outcomes by eliminating sedative and narcotic infusions, decreasing delirium, increasing patient participation in SATs and SBTs, and promoting early participation with occupational and physical therapy. All of these efforts, in turn, reduce duration of mechanical ventilation, and translate to decreased incidence of VAE. 16 Other efforts that may play a role in reducing VAE include using lung-protective ventilation and preventing overaggressive fluid or blood product resuscitation. Although there have not been any studies to date demonstrating the effects of these strategies on VAE, each has been shown to mitigate lung injury, which may lead to deterioration of pulmonary function in ventilated patients.",

Many of the publications reviewed in this article were performed in mixed populations and so how the criteria apply to surgical patients is unclear. Many surgical patients require mechanical ventilation secondary to another insult or injury and not from a primary pulmonary process as in many of the medicine patients. There is a bimodal distribution of pulmonary dysfunction in surgical patients. Some patients have early progressively worsening respiratory failure as a consequence of their initial injury or process and other patients develop late pulmonary dysfunction as a consequence of pneumonia or aggressive resuscitation secondary to the treatment of their primary event. The VAE criteria do not readily identify the first group because they never have a period of stability, but readily identify the other group. The appropriate resuscitation of a surgical patient with abdominal sepsis or the trauma patient with acute hemorrhage may secondarily exacerbate pulmonary dysfunction. Future studies that investigate VAE in these subsets of patients may help identify new end points for resuscitation that minimize pulmonary dysfunction while providing correction of acidosis and restoration of end-target organ perfusion.",

The VAE criteria stratify respiratory compromise of ventilated patient into a tiered system that includes VAC, iVAC, possible-VAP, and probable-VAP. Each classification has defined objective criteria that eliminate the subjectivity of previous PNU1 definition. The implementation of VAE criteria is intended to better characterize and quantitate the broader causes of respiratory deterioration in ventilated patients, and to shift the focus away from VAP as the only relevant ventilator-associated complication. This new definition eliminates radiographic finding as a component of the definition and, as a result, may underestimate the rate of clinical pneumonia. Instead these categories are intended to also capture all of the other noninfectious causes of respiratory compromise in ventilated patients. These objective criteria facilitate the automated collection of data from the EMR and reduce variability in reporting, which allows for easier comparison of data within institutions, between health care systems, and even across international borders. The current definition has been well studied in medicine patients but has not been well vetted in the surgical population. Additionally, these criteria may need to be amended to account for nonconventional modes of ventilation, such as airway pressure release ventilation. Using the new VAE surveillance definition serves as a quality indicator proxy. Adherence to the best practices standards of daily awakening and breathing trials and initiating early mobilization reduces the duration of ventilator dependence and the subsequent incidence of all classifications of VAE.",
