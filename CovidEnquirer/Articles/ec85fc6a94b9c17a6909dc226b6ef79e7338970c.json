Taking different viewpoints to consider public health policies to control the disease, we derive different basic reproduction numbers and clarify their common/different mathematical natures so as to understand their meanings in the dynamics of the epidemic. From our analyses, the short-stay visitor subpopulation could become significant in determining the fate of diseases in the community. Furthermore, our arguments demonstrate that it is necessary to choose one variant of basic reproduction number in order to formulate appropriate public health policies.",

The history of man is replete with stories of epidemics invading groups of people, sometimes resulting in mortality. In the long run, such diseases can disappear and recur in the future or become less deadly due to people getting immune. Some notable epidemics in history include the \"Spanish\" flu (1918) (1919) as well as the Black Deaths (1346-1350) which invaded Europe from Asia and recurred for three decades afterwards before getting eliminated ( Brauer, 2017 ) .",

The threat of measles is a serious one because it has about the highest basic reproduction number R 0 among the most commonly known infectious diseases ( van den Driessche, 2017 ). It has been established that R 0 is a very vital threshold parameter that theoretically determines whether a disease is eliminated or becomes endemic after it is introduced into a given population. In fact, it is widely believed to be one of the most important contributions of mathematics to the field of epidemiology ( Diekmann et al., 2010; Heffernan et al., 2005; van den Driessche and Watmough, 2002 ) . Heffernan et al. (2005) gave a concise summary of prevalent approaches for formulating R 0 from deterministic models as well as relevant data. They also looked closely at the use of R 0 in evaluating diseases like severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and avian influenza as well as some livestock and vector-borne diseases. van den Driessche (2017) applied the theoretical concepts of R 0 to various disease models, namely the West Nile virus in birds, anthrax in animals, cholera and Zika in humans.",

In the frequently referred paper by van den Driessche and Watmough (2002) , very helpful results were obtained for disease control having investigated the actual definition of R 0 based on a compartmental system of ordinary differential equations. Diekmann et al. (2010) highlighted the NGM as the foundation for the mathematical definition of R 0 . As such, their work attempted to demystify issues surrounding the formulation of NGMs since R 0 s are basically defined as the spectral radii of such matrices. We should recognize that, as described above, the basic reproduction number is defined both biologically/conceptually and mathematically as the supremum for the expected number of secondary cases in epidemic dynamics, whereas it is clear that the index R 0 could be important and useful to characterize the threat of infectious diseases.",

Such residents and visitors may be considered to be either humans or animals as a variety of situations can be considered. The R 0 focused on residents can be considered as the most standard case as it may be a bit difficult to really estimate the impact of short-stay visitors in the spread of diseases. The R 0 focused on short-stay visitors is very important when the residents are considered as some vectors in the community which can easily spread diseases to visitors. That way, we can make inferences by combining different R 0 s. Besides we shall demonstrate that R 0 only deals with the initial behavior of infections because the overall behavior is governed by the model under consideration.",

Thus, this result can be understood as the case when the basic reproduction number of the resident subpopulation corresponding to R rr is kept beyond 1. As such, the visitor subpopulation is regarded as always being exposed to infective residents by cross infection (which corresponds to the divergence of the above-mentioned sum).

As stated earlier, reducing the visitor population size will be very effective although it is in general quite difficult to achieve within a country except in conserved areas. For transnational human movements, visa application processes can be tightened but in a world of growing globalization, that might be counterproductive. The dynamics of swine fever, which is endemic and of major concern in the global hog business, is a very good example which corresponds to our model since there is the possibility of cross infection within and between domestic pig and wild boar populations such that we have \u03b2 rr > 0, \u03b2 vr > 0, \u03b2 rv > 0 and ",

N r and N v also have direct effect, but more attention should be paid to the latter because of its square order contribution on the basic reproduction numbers. If we can control the mosquito density N v so that R 0 | v < 1, the outbreak of malaria could be successfully suppressed. This argument could be extended to other vector-borne diseases like Dengue fever, Lyme disease, West Nile fever, etc. Taking a different standpoint where we consider mosquitoes as residents and humans as visitors, for example, the case of some explorers in a mosquito infested environment, the expected duration of stay N v / M appears very crucial. A sufficiently short duration of stay could help manage the epidemic effectively. Also, an enough low contact rate with the mosquito population would be very vital. This can be achieved by control measures like the use of insecticide-treated nets (ITN) and mosquito repellents. Another control measure might be the use of vaccination by the visitors to make them immune to being infected. Horimoto et al. (2005) predicted that a new influenza pandemic would occur following outbreaks of the H5 and H7 subtypes of avian influenza A in birds and humans. Infection in humans was known to occur through very close contact with birds which had been infected while bird to bird infections were obviously easier. Using the concept of the basic reproduction number, investigated the dynamics of a bird-to-human transmission model with regards to human psychology vis-\u00e0-vis avian influenza. Their outcome shows that if there is an outbreak, \"the saturation effect within avian population and the psychological effect in human population cannot change the stability of equilibria but can affect the number of infected humans\". Liu and Fang (2015) formulated a two-host dynamic model for H7N9 virus infection in both bird and human populations. Critical transmission parameters were computed using nationwide surveillance data of infections in mainland China.",

Frequently, such movements correspond to migration as opposed to temporary visits for a finite period as we consider in our case, or to human transportation on a large spatial scale during relatively long trips. Our scenario of short visits does not fully capture the metapopulation framework in most of those previous works but the interaction between the resident and visitor subpopulations has some semblance of metapopulation behavior. Indeed, the two subpopulations may be regarded as patches between which diseases can spread. This may be said to display some metapopulation dynamics in the context of modern trends in social networks ( Hackl and Dubernet, 2019; while metapopulation dynamics have been generally based on a spatially heterogeneous structure of population distribution ( Arino and van den Driessche, 2006; Ball et al., 2015; North and Godfray, 2017 ) .",

These arguments prove thatThis result can also be supported by the local stability analysis. We can easily get the following Jacobian matrix for the system (2) about) exists locally asymptotically stable. In the same way, making use of the eigenvalue analysis about the Jacobian matrix for the linearization of (2) , it can also be proven that the equilibrium point (0,0,0) is unstable if R vv > 1 .",
