There are no licensed RSV vaccines available, and the few treatment options for high-risk individuals are either extremely costly or cause severe side effects and toxicity. Immunomodulation mediated by a novel formulation consisting of the toll-like receptor 3 agonist poly(I:C), an innate defense regulator peptide and a polyphosphazene (P-I-P) was evaluated in the context of lethal infection with pneumonia virus of mice (PVM). Intranasal delivery of a single dose of P-I-P protected adult mice against PVM when given 24 h prior to challenge. These animals experienced minimal weight loss, no clinical disease, 100% survival, and reduced lung pathology. Similar clinical outcomes were observed in mice treated up to 3 days prior to infection. P-I-P pre-treatment induced early mRNA and protein expression of key chemokine and cytokine genes, reduced the recruitment of neutrophils and eosinophils, decreased virus titers in the lungs, and modulated the delayed exacerbated nature of PVM disease without any short-term side effects. On day 14 post-infection, P-I-P-treated mice were confirmed to be PVM-free. These results demonstrate the capacity of this formulation to prevent PVM and possibly other viral respiratory infections.",

The first component of this formulation is poly(I:C), which promotes Th1 immune responses by inducing high levels of IL-12 and type I IFNs (Zhao et al., 2012; Tewari et al., 2010) . The second component is an innate defense regulator (IDR) peptide, which is a derivative of bovine bactenecin and possesses immunomodulatory properties (Nijnik et al., 2010; Wu and Hancock, 1999; Hilchie et al., 2013) . Lastly, this adjuvant platform contains poly[di(sodiumcarboxylatoethylphenoxy)]-phosphazene (PCEP), a synthetic water-soluble polymer that acts as a delivery system and can modulate innate immune responses (Mutwiri et al., 2007; Awate et al., 2012) .

Mice were given intranasal treatment of P-I-P or PBS 24 h prior to challenge with 3000 pfu PVM-15. Animals were weighed and scored before treatment (i.e. day -1), on the day of challenge (i.e. day 0), and for 14 days after infection. Panel A highlights the events occurring in the animal trial. Collection of lung tissue for virus titrations, cell influx and mRNA/protein expression studies was scheduled on days 0 (prior to infection), 3 and 5 p.i. Lung samples for histopathology studies were collected on day 6 p.i. On day 14 p.i., qPCR was performed on survivor mice to determine their PVM status. Panel B illustrates weight loss of mice following P-I-P treatment and PVM infection as a median percentage of the starting weight with error bars indicating the interquartile range. The stars indicate the difference between P-I-P/PVM and PBS/PVM groups. Panel C represents survival rates as the median percentage of the total number of animals per group during the 14 days following infection. Panels D and E show clinical scores for weight loss and appearance represented by the median value for each group throughout the entire animal trial.

P-I-P-treated mice showed early upregulation of CCL2, CCL3, CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL10 mRNA on day 0 p.i., compared to the PBStreated animals. This was confirmed for CCL2 and CXCL1 at the protein level. During the next two time points following PVM infection, chemokine expression remained fairly stable and did not change over time (Figs. 7 and 8A,B) . In contrast, PBS-treated mice expressed increasing amounts of these two chemokine molecules over time (Figs. 7 and 8A,B) . P-I-P-treated animals displayed slightly upregulated mRNA levels for TNF-a, IL-1b, IL-6, IL-12 and IL-10 on day 0 p.i. (Fig. 7) . Similarly, higher cytokine protein concentrations were detected in these mice on day 0 p.i. compared to PBS-treated mice (Fig. 8CeG) . With the exception of IL-10, which increased over time, the P-I-Ptreated group continued to have relatively stable cytokine gene and protein expression profiles throughout the remaining days following PVM infection. Conversely, cytokine gene and protein expression profiles of the PBS-treated group were characterized by increasing levels of these molecules over time, with highest overall expression detected on day 5 p.i. Overall, P-I-P-treated mice displayed lower cytokine protein concentrations on day 5 p.i. compared to the PBS-treated animals. P-I-P-treated animals displayed an earlier expression of type I IFN mRNA compared to PBS-treated mice (Fig. 7) . By day 3 p.i., these mice experienced a significant drop in both IFN-a and IFN-b mRNA levels. In contrast, the PBS-treated animals showed a slightly delayed expression of type I IFNs, with highest IFN-a and IFN-b mRNA expression on days 3 and 5 p.i., respectively. P-I-P-treated mice displayed elevated levels of both IFN-g mRNA and protein on day 0 p.i., significantly higher than those detected in PBS-treated animals (Figs. 7 and 8H ).

P-I-P significantly upregulated the expression of genes involved in host defense within the first 24 h p.t. Thereafter, these levels decreased as expected due to their relatively short half-lives. P-I-P prophylaxis at 24 h prior to PVM challenge prevented weight loss and clinical symptoms, reduced lung immunopathology, and conferred complete survival. Additionally, P-I-P was found to be a superior formulation compared to poly(I:C), IDR peptide or PCEP alone (data not shown). P-I-P did not cause any observable adverse effects as evidenced by the absence of clinical signs following treatment. Interestingly, P-I-P mediated a substantial reduction of neutrophil and eosinophil influx during PVM infection, and induced the early recruitment of NK cells and DCs into the lungs. Lastly, the protective effect of P-I-P was maintained if delivered as early as 3 days prior to lethal challenge. Survivor mice were deemed PVM-free on day 14 p.i. This suggests that P-I-P modulation of host immune responses can trigger complete clearance of the virus from the site of infection.",

With regards to PVM as well as RSV, an effective therapeutic approach should be both antiviral and immunomodulatory in nature (Rosenberg et al., 2005; Bonville et al., 2003) . One group demonstrated this principle for PVM by injecting mice with ribavirin together with CCL3 blockade by either gene-deletion or antibody (Bonville et al., 2003) . In order to achieve the desired outcomes, two daily doses of ribavirin and a single daily dose of anti-CCL3 antibody were required during a period of 12 days (Bonville et al., 2003) . As mentioned previously, ribavirin is known to induce toxicity and severe side effects in pediatric patients, discouraging its use in these populations. A few advantages of P-I-P treatment include the fact that it indirectly induces moderate antiviral activity and can down-modulate the levels of chemokines and cytokines such as CCL3, CCL2, CXCL1, TNF-a, and IL-6 during PVM infection.",

One group recently showed that depletion of alveolar macrophages prior to RSV infection resulted in increased virus titers in the lungs, exacerbated disease and lung inflammation (Kolli et al., 2014) . P-I-P treatment is associated with enhanced viral clearance, reduced immunopathology and higher alveolar macrophage numbers in the lungs during lethal PVM infection. It is likely that the latter event provided P-I-P-treated mice with an advantage, as alveolar macrophages are known to dampen excess inflammatory responses within the lung microenvironment (Pribul et al., 2008) .",

Similarly, prominent granulocyte accumulation in the lungs is a hallmark of PVM infection, which eventually progresses to pulmonary edema and respiratory distress (Bonville et al., 2009) . In contrast, one group showed that mice depleted from neutrophils before the establishment of influenza A infection resulted in increased morbidity and mortality (Tumpey et al., 2005; Drescher and Bai, 2013) . This evidence suggests that neutrophil infiltration, if properly controlled, can be beneficial by reducing disease (i.e. promoting viral clearance). Interestingly, early neutrophil influx was detected in P-I-P-treated mice. While it is possible that the treatment mediates moderate neutrophil recruitment into the lungs by the production of chemoattractants like CXCL1 and CXCL2, these mice did not show signs of neutrophilia.",

Treatment with P-I-P had a direct effect on NK cell infiltration. This formulation mediated the expression of NK cell chemo-attractants in the lung (i.e. CCL2, CCL3, CXCL10). Once within the tissue, these cells are likely to find an optimal environment that supports their activation and autocrine production of IFN-g (Vivier et al., 2008) . Consequently, IFN-g can act directly on alveolar macrophages, leading to their activation and increased phagocytic activity (Schroder et al., 2004) . The advantage of P-I-P is that these mice had an early local antiviral immune response prior to PVM exposure. Fig. 9 .

These individuals could be treated with the P-I-P formulation during outbreaks of RSV or possibly other respiratory infections such that partial immune protection can be provided. P-I-P acts primarily at level of the innate immune system of the host, which allows us to speculate on the possibility of a well-established P-I-P therapy to protect patients from multiple viral infections at once. It would be beneficial if one can protect the most vulnerable populations from major diseases like influenza, coronavirus, and RSV infections as most of these tend to be transmitted through the same route of exposure and during the same seasons. Studies confirming such pleiotropic effect are yet to be performed. Fig. 10 . Percent weight loss, survival and external appearance clinical scores of Balb/c mice treated with P-I-P or PBS 3 days (panels AeC), 4 days (panels DeF), 5 days (panels GeI) and 6 days (panels JeL) prior to intranasal PVM challenge.
