To better understand the molecular biology of the prototype HCV-229E strain, the complete nucleotide sequence of the membrane protein (M) gene was determined from cloned eDNA . The open reading frame is preceded by a consensus transcriptional initiation sequence UCUAAACU, identical to the one found upstream of the N gene . The M gene encodes a 225-amino acid polypeptide with a molecular weight (MW) of 25,822, slightly higher than the apparent MW of 19,000-22,000 observed for the unprocessed M protein obtained after in vitro translation and immunoprecipitation . The M amino acid sequence presents a significant degree of homology (38%)with its counterpart of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV) . The M protein of HCV-229E is highly hydrophobic and its hydropathicity profile shows a transmembranous region composed of three major hydrophobic domains characteristic of a typical coronavirus M protein . About 10% (20 amino acids) of the HCV-229E M protein constitutes a hydrophilic and probably external portion . One N-glycosylation and three potential O-glycosylation sites are found in this exposed domain . C 1990 Academic Press, Inc .",

The sequencing of both strands was performed by the plasmid sequencing technique (17), using T7 DNA polyrnerase .

As shown in Fig . 2 , six viral polypeptides were observed, which migrated with apparent molecular masses of 98, 58, 42, 28 .5, 19, and 14 kDa, respectively . Although the identity of these proteins has not been firmly established, by comparing with other coronaviruses, p98 probably corresponds to S, p58 to N, and p19 to M . The nature of p42 and p28 .5 is not known at this time . Thus, the molecular mass of M predicted from the nucleotide sequence is slightly higher than the molecular mass estimated by SDS-PAGE . Other studies have shown that the mature M protein has a molecular mass of 23-to 26-kDa (12) (13) (14) and that virions also incorporate a nonglycosylated 20-to 22-kDa precursor of the M protein (12, 14) . The latter observation is consistent with the identification of in vitro translated p19 as M . The lower apparent molecular mass of M estimated by SDS-PAGE is consistent with the unusual electrophoretic behavior of this and other hydrophobic proteins, as was observed for MHV (19) .",

The hydropathicily profiles of M proteins from HCV-229E, TGEV, BCV, MHV-JHM, MHV-A59, and IBV are presented in Fig . 4 . The main features characterizing these M proteins include three large hydrophobic domains alternating with short hydrophilic regions . This suggests a selective pressure to maintain the potential transmembranous domains of this coronavirus protein . As with other coronaviruses (26), only about 10% (20 amino acids) of the HCV-229E M protein constitutes the hydrophilic putative external domain . On the other hand, Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences of M proteins of HCV-229E (top row) and TGEV (bottom row) aligned for maximum homology . Regions common to both proteins are underlined . The analysis was performed on an Apple Macintosh Plus computer with the MacGene Plus program (Applied Genetic Technology Inc ., Faiiview Park, OH) . the large N-terminal putative signal sequence found only in the M protein of TGEV (20, 25) is not observed in HCV-229E, which is similar to the structure reported HCV-229E for BCV, MHV-JHM, MHV-A59, and IBV . The coronavirus M protein is important for several reasons . This membrane protein is implicated in virus assembly and is believed to integrate the viral proteins TGEV prior to budding, most likely because of this protein's affinity for RNA (26) . Moreover, some monoclonal antibodies against the M protein of MHV-JHM are protective in vivo and thus may influence the outcome of dis-BCV ease (27) . We are currently pursuing the cloning and sequencing of other genes of HCV-229E, with emphasis on the gene coding for the spike protein S, which is potentially important in viral pathogenicity . The availability of molecular probes for human coronavirus MHV-3HM genes opens new avenues for the verification of the potential involvement of these viruses in neurological diseases .
