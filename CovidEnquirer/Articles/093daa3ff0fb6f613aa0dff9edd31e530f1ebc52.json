The time of the outbreak coincided with the Chinese Spring Festival, when the largest annual population movement began. Before the lockdown on January 23 rd , an estimated 5 million residents left Wuhan [2] . The infected people in incubation period had brought the virus to other cities and person-to-person transmission of the new coronavirus caused the spread of infections across the country.",

In the study of Zhao et al., they found significant association between travel by train and spread of COVID-19 infections, but not for travelling by car and flight [3] . In order to evaluate the role of public transportation in the spatial transmission of COVID-19, we searched daily flights, buses, and trains from Wuhan to these cities in January (https://www.ctrip.com). The figure shows destinations and frequencies of these flights (B), buses (C) and trains (D) from Wuhan. We also obtained straight line distances between Wuhan and these cities (https://map.baidu.com) and excluded those \u22651500 km to avoid outlier effects. The daily number and the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases in each city were obtained from the official website (http://health.people.com.cn/GB/26466/431463/431576/index.html) with real-time updates at 12:00 pm on each day since January 24 th . All the data were logarithmically transformed and the Pearson\u00b4s correlation analysis was used to examine correlations of daily frequencies of each transportation methods and the distance between Wuhan and other cities, with the daily 4 number and the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases.",

The distance between Wuhan and other cities was inversely associated with the numbers of COVID-19 cases in that city (all P values < 0.001), and the correlation became increasingly stronger and went stable after February 1 st . The mean incubation period was estimated to be 5.2 days [1] , therefore real associations appeared after most infected cases out from Wuhan presented typical symptoms and were diagnosed [4] . ",

Panel B shows flight destinations and frequencies from Wuhan. Panel C shows bus destinations and frequencies from Wuhan. Panel D shows train destinations and frequencies from Wuhan. Higher weights of lines indicate higher frequencies. Panel E shows the correlation coefficients of daily frequencies of each transportation methods from Wuhan and the distance between Wuhan and other cities, with the daily number of COVID-19 cases. Panel F shows the correlation coefficients of daily frequencies of each transportation methods from Wuhan and the distance between Wuhan and other cities, with the cumulative number of COVID-19 cases.
