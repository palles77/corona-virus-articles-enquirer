            "text": "The effect of different routes of immunization with either live or killed bovine rotavirus (BRV) on the production of lactogenic antibody response in mice was evaluated. The routes of immunization were intramuscular (IM), oral (0) or intradermal in the mammary region (IMam). Following immunization, serum antibody responses were monitored by an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Following whelping, the mice were allowed to stay with their mother until sacrificed on alternate days post-parturition from day l-l 1. Milk from their stomach was collected for antibody titration by ELISA and virus neutralization test. Regardless of the routes of immunization, a rapid increase in serum anti-rotavirus antibody titers was observed for the first 5 wk after immunization followed by a gradual decline. After parturition, the mean antibody titer of lacteal secretions, as determined by ELISA, increased gradually for 7 days with the greatest increase on day 9, followed by a decrease in anti-rotavirus antibody. These titers also correlated with antibody titers in milk as measured by virus neutralization test. The best lactogenic antibody response was observed when IMam x IM x 2 route of immunization was used with live BRV as the antigen. Interestingly, immunization via the oral route with killed BRV also resulted in good antibody responses. In contrast, in the group where killed BRV was used, animals receiving 3~ orally had the highest antibody titer. The distribution of different antibody subtypes in milk samples revealed IgG to be the predominant antibody followed by IgM and IgA.",

Although previous studies have indicated no correlation between protection from rotavirus infection and the titers of passively acquired antibodies in the serum of newborns (Saif and Smith, 1983; M.K.

In addition to the humoral immune response, the role played by the cellular component of immunity in the production of lactogenic immune response has also been documented (Parmerly and Beer, 1977; Ripenhoff-Talty et al., 1983) . Cell transfer experiments in mice have revealed the migration of lymphoblasts from mesenteric lymph nodes into the intestine and mammary gland and other secretory organs and peripheral lymph nodes (McDermott et al., 1980; McDowell and Lascells, 1971) . Most cells migrating into secretory organs and mesenteric lymph nodes synthesized IgA, but most of those migrating to peripheral lymph nodes produced IgG or IgM (Bohl et al., 1972; McDermott et al., 1980; Roux et al.. 1977) . Experiments carried out in porcine and bovine models have revealed the predominance of IgA and IgG subtypes in porcine and bovine milk, respectively, with the decrease of these subtypes occurring during the post-parturition period (Saif and Bohl, 1979; Saif and Smith, 1983) . Thus it becomes imperative to direct efforts in order to stimulate the lactogenic anti-rotavirus antibody response to higher titers for longer periods after parturition to ensure protection against rotavirus infection in neonates receiving these antibodies in mother's milk. Earlier experiments conducted to determine the kinetics of BRV replication in a mouse model revealed that the neonates are most susceptible to infection at the age of seven days (Ijaz et al., in preparation) .",

In the case of rotavirus induced neonatal diarrhea in calves and lambs, it has been experimen-tally shown that by feeding colostrum, milk, or serum containing suffcient anti-rotavirus antibodies, infection of the intestine can be prevented (Snodgrass et al., 1982) . The degree of protection not only correlated with the quantity of anti-rotavirus antibodies present but also with the subtype of the Ig involved (Snodgrass et al., 1982) . Local immunity against rotavirus can perform two functions. First. the presence of antibody in the intestine should protect the neonate from disease. Secondly, it should help in the reduction of rotavirus in feces and hence reduce environmental contamination (Saif and Smith, 1983) . Since the mouse model being used in our protective-challenge experiments against rotavirus infection, utilizes neonates at 7 days of age, the time when mouse enterocytes have the highest number of rotavirus specific receptors, thereby making them more susceptible to infection (Riepenhoff-Talty et al., 1983) . We studied lacteal antibody responses spanning this time frame, plus a few days beyond. To achieve this, different routes of immunization were evaluated.",

It has been shown by Halsey et al. (1982) that such a transfer does take place in the mouse with as much as 80% of the milk IgA on the fourth day of lactation coming from serum as compared to 20% on the eighth day. The rest of the IgA is likely produced locally by sensitized cells, in the mouse model. In contrast, there is no evidence for local production of IgA in the mammary gland in early or mid-lactation in sheep (A.J. Husband et al., 1986; 6th International Congress of Immunology, Toronto, Canada, 1.43.4). Hanson et al. (1983) could not observe any transfer of dimeric IgA from the circulatory system to milk in rats. Bohl and Saif (1975) vaccinated pregnant cows via the IMam route with live attenuated transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) virus and found that antibodies in milk from these animals were primarily of the IgG class. In contrast, after natural infection with TGE virus via the oral route, they observed that the antibodies in lacteal secretions are mainly of the IgA class (Bohl et al., 1972) . Thus, it suggests that the route of infection or vaccinations with virus may influence the Ig class in secretions. Although in the present study the majority of antibody in milk was of the IgG class, in natural infection with rotavirus it is the secretory IgA which is closely related to protection in mice and humans because of its resistance to degradation by trypsin, chymotrypsins, and pepsin (Offit and Clark, 1985) .",

Even though the IgM and IgG antibodies were predominant in lacteal secretions, their effectiveness in preventing enteric infection in mice has been questioned (Newby, 1984) .

The plaque reduction neutralization (PRN) titer of milk in particular was much lower (3 log,,,) after oral immunization compared to parenteral immunization (Offit and Clark, 1985) .
