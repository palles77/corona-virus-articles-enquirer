            "text": "To characterize the antigenic epitopes of the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of H1N1 influenza virus, a panel consisting of 84 clones of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were generated using the HA proteins from the 2009 pandemic H1N1 vaccine lysate and the seasonal influenza H1N1(A1) vaccines. Thirty-three (39%) of the 84 mAbs were found to be strain-specific, and 6 (7%) of the 84 mAbs were subtype-specific. Twenty (24%) of the 84 mAbs recognized the common HA epitopes shared by 2009 pandemic H1N1, seasonal A1 (H1N1), and A3 (H3N2) influenza viruses. Twenty-five of the 84 clones recognized the common HA epitopes shared by the 2009 pandemic H1N1, seasonal A1 (H1N1) and A3 (H3N2) human influenza viruses, and H5N1 and H9N2 avian influenza viruses. We found that of the 16 (19%) clones of the 84 mAbs panel that were cross-reactive with human respiratory pathogens, 15 were made using the HA of the seasonal A1 (H1N1) virus and 1 was made using the HA of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus. Immunohistochemical analysis of the tissue microarray (TMA) showed that 4 of the 84 mAb clones cross-reacted with human tissue (brain and pancreas). Our results indicated that the influenza virus HA antigenic epitopes not only induce type-, subtype-, and strain-specific monoclonal antibodies against influenza A virus but also cross-reactive monoclonal antibodies against human tissues. Further investigations of these cross-reactive (heterophilic) epitopes may significantly improve our understanding of viral antigenic variation, epidemics, pathophysiologic mechanisms, and adverse effects of influenza vaccines.",

IAV belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family and is a single stranded negative sense RNA virus with eight RNA segments encoding at least 11 proteins. Hemagglutinin (HA), encoded by the fourth RNA segment, is the major membrane glycoprotein that mediates viral attachment and fusion and determines pathogenicity and virulence. Neuraminidase (NA), encoded by the sixth RNA fragment, is the second major membrane glycoprotein. Both HA and NA are crucial antigenic components of the virus. Due to immune selection pressures, low fidelity of RNA transcription, and RNA reassortment of the viral genome, a variety of genetic and immunogenic HA and NA variants emerge constantly. Up to now, 18 HA and 9 NA subtypes of type A influenza virus have been identified (Tong et al., 2013) .",

            "text": "In the 21st century, the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus emerged in 2009 from Mexico and quickly spread all over the world (WHO, 2012) . In the first year of infection alone, H1N1 caused 151,700-575,400 deaths, and there were an estimated 60 million cases of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic strain and a number of severe cases in young adults without underlying disease (cdc.gov). People at higher risk of serious complications include the elderly (>65 years), younger children (<5), and pregnant women. In severe cases, symptoms included pneumonia, respiratory failure, thrombocytopenia and death (Desdouits et al., 2013; Guedj et al., 2012;  http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.imbio.2015.02.002 0171-2985/\u00a9 2015 Elsevier GmbH. All rights reserved. Mammas et al., 2011) . Vaccination is the best preventive strategy against influenza. The safety and efficacy of the vaccine for the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain was evaluated (Liang et al., 2010) , and the adverse events associated with 2009 H1N1 vaccination raised concerns that affected the large-scale administration of the influenza vaccine (CDC, 2009; Williams et al., 2011; Choe et al., 2011) . Guillain-Barre syndrome was one of the several adverse events observed after vaccination with the 2009 H1N1 vaccine (Deeks et al., 2011; Greenberg et al., 2009) . However, the pathological mechanisms underlying influenza A virus infection and vaccine-induced serious adverse reactions are still poorly understood. Monsalvo et al. (2011) found non-protective antibodies in the sera from patients with severe pandemic 2009 H1N1 influenza disease, and these non-protective-antibodies were found to be associated with immune complexes. We hypothesized that autoimmunity plays a role in the development of severe symptoms after virus infection and vaccination-related adverse events (Ahmed et al., 2014; Perdan-Pirkmajer et al., 2012) . However, more evidence is required in support of this hypothesis.",

After centrifuging the cells, the supernatant was discarded and 60 mL HAT medium was slowly added to the cells.

Till date the application of monoclonal antibodies against influenza virus has mainly been concentrated on diagnosis, immunotherapy and prophylaxis. The pathological mechanisms underlying the severe symptoms of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus infection and the severe adverse events after vaccination are still poorly understood. A panel of 84 clones of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were successfully generated using the HA proteins from the 2009 pandemic H1N1 vaccine lysate and the seasonal influenza A1 vaccines. Among the 84 clones of mAbs obtained, 38 (H1N1) were made from the 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine (for example, H1N1 A/South Carolina/1918 (A/SC/1918)), 46 from seasonal influenza A1 vaccine (add information same as before). Forty six of the mABs were found to belong to the IgM subclass1, and because polysaccharide antigens are known to easily elicit IgM antibodies, it was suggested that some of the antibodies in the panel might be specific to polysaccharide epitopes on the H1 glycoprotein.",

These results suggested that antigenic mimics or heterophilic antigenic epitopes are shared between influenza virus HA protein and human tissues (brain and pancreas). Because such heterophilic antigenic epitopes are capable of inducing autoimmunity in the host, they may be involved in the pathological mechanisms underlying 2009 H1N1 influenza virus infection and vaccine-triggered adverse events. Based on previous studies on some heterophilic antigenic epitopes shared by pathogenic microorganisms and human tissue (Kraus and Beachey, 1998; Laercrantz et al., 1968) , we proposed that autoimmunity induced by the influenza HA protein might play a role in the pathogenesis associated with influenza virus infection and vaccination. Carlo Garzelli et al. found that the monoclonal antibody secreted by Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphocytes could react with multiple organs including the thyroid, pancreas, stomach, muscles and nerves, indicating that Epstein-Barr virus can induce autoantibodies (Naundorf et al., 2002) . Srinivasappa et al. (1968) reported that 600 mAb clones prepared using 11 viral antigens were able to react with 14 different organs from normal uninfected mice. Approximately 3.5% of these mAbs (21/600) reacted with specific types of cells from these organs. Therefore, viral infections might stimulate autoimmune reactions.",

However, rare severe adverse events (Guillain-Barre syndrome) after large-scale vaccination raised some concerns (Vellozzi et al., 2010; Evans et al., 2009) . Two of the 84 mAbs generated in our study were capable of binding to human brain tissue. These two clones may be useful tools to further understand whether the development of Guillain-Barre syndrome is related to influenza vaccination or not. In addition, 2 more clones were found to react with human islet \u2423 cells (data to be published). Our study suggests that autoimmunity might be induced by influenza infection and vaccination. Further investigation of the pathological mechanisms of influenza infection and vaccine-induced adverse events using these 4 crossreactive mAbs is currently underway in our laboratory.",
