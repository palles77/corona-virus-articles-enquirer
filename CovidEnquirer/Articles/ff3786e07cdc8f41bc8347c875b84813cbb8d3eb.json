In addition, thyroid glands, breast, and lungs are among the most cancer-susceptible organs in the body, and those organs are all included in chest CT.

Clinical diagnosis of neutropenic fever was based on fulfillment of body temperature higher than 38 Celsius with absolute neutrophil count lower than 500.

Final diagnosis was made in each case by reviewing each patient's medical record and laboratory findings, including the following two weeks chest radiographs. An internal medicine physician (S.Y.P.) who subspecialized in respiratory medicine for eight years made an integrative confirmative diagnosis taking into account all clinical symptoms, laboratory test results, and response to treatments after discussion with more than three physicians, including an intensivist, pulmonologist, oncologist, intensive care unit fellow, and the physician in charge. If the decision was not concordant, we requested consultantation to the division of infectious disease. We validated precise diagnosis through serial follow up of chest X-ray, inflammatory markers such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, and clinical symptoms of patients. Evidence of pneumonia on follow-up chest images and microorganisms detected during follow-up microbiologic studies were also regarded as documentation of pneumonia.",

The infectious pneumonia group was subdivided into four categories according to pathogens identified: bacterial, viral, fungal, and Pneumocystis jiroveci organisms. For example, in the case of cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia, we checked CMV antigemia and treatment response. Second, diagnosis of noninfectious pneumonia was made on lung parenchymal lesions, which were deemed to be less responsible for infectious focus. In addition, the patients in this category did not show any response to antibiotic or antifungal treatment. Patients who had no abnormal lesions on ULDCT, no evidence of extrathoracic fever focus, no response to antibiotic, antifungal or antiviral treatments, and no new lesion on follow-up chest radiographs taken during two weeks after fever onset were categorized as having normal chest finding. Extrathoracic fever focus was elucidated by making a diagnosis of extrathoracic fever focus by disclosing definite evidence, such as catheter related infection, pseudomembranous colitis, or urinary tract infection.",

Therefore, it seems to be no longer tenable to claim that CT risks are \"too low to be detectable and may be non-existent\" [3] . Given the current level of scientific uncertainty regarding radiation risk at low-dose level, it may be appropriate to act on the assumption that such risks are real, as this conservative approach is unlikely to underestimate patient risks [21] . Our study has demonstrated a significant reduction of effective radiation dose without abandonment of the image quality. ULDCT contributed to the appropriate treatment for neutropenic patients, at a relatively early stage. By using ULDCT, we might expect a better survival rate in febrile neutropenic patients with hematologic malignancy.",

            "text": "The current study has several limitations. First, invasive diagnostic procedures for histopathologic or microbiologic confirmation were not performed in all patients. However, even with surgical lung biopsy the definite diagnosis could not be made in a certain percentage of patients in whom identifiable abnormalities were observed on CT or chest radiography. Also in our study, diagnoses for lung abnormalities were made by integrating clinical, laboratory, imaging, microbiologic, or histopathologic findings. Second, because this study was conducted prospectively before the clinical use of state-of-the-art dose reduction techniques such as adaptive statistical iterative reconstruction (ASIR) or model-based iterative reconstruction [25] , such new techniques could not be applied in our study. If these techniques could have been applied, the lowest thus more mitigated radiation-dose CT images might have been produced and used for image interpretation. However, there has still been debate regarding the image quality of ASIRapplied image, particularly for interstitial lung lesions or ground-glass opacities due to spatial resolution and edge sharpness [23] . In addition, we did not obtain the standard dose CT simultaneously for direct comparison with image quality because our concern was the precise impact on clinical decision. The other reason was the ethical concern of increased radiation exposure by double scanning. We also worried about a higher radiation exposure dose of ULDCT compared with chest X-ray. We did the best we could to References reduce the radiation dose even approximately one twelfth of the effective dose of conventional chest CT (7.0 mSv). And, we thought that reduction of mortality due to early detection of fever focus is more important than radiation hazard.",
