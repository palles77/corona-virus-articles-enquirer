This will initially require a risk stratification to determine what the critical targets of surveillance should be. In the USA and other higher-income countries, many surveillance activities will be mandated by local or federal authorities and other licensing and regulatory bodies. Other surveillance activities will vary, based on an understanding of the epidemiology and risk at a particular institution. For instance, surveillance for invasive aspergillosis in an institution",

Surveillance should be an active process that includes review of microbiologic data, clinical and nursing records, pharmacologic and pathologic data, readmission and reoperation data following surgery for selected procedures, etc. Automated surveillance systems utilizing computer-based patient records or other electronic data may provide a sensitive, specific, time-efficient and cost-effective mechanism in many institutions. 12 5. Appropriate benchmarking should be sought. Increasingly, healthcare systems are being compared and inferences on quality of care are being made, sometimes with suboptimal risk adjustment. 6. Appropriate risk stratification is essential to identify and prioritize which areas should be targeted for performance improvement within a given institution. However, differences in hospital size, patient mix and risk adjustment introduce complexity when comparing rates between smaller community hospitals and tertiary care/specialty hospitals. In 2009, NHSN transitioned from reporting rates of HAIs to the standardized infection ratio (SIR). 14 The SIR is the ratio of expected over observed events for a particular HAI. Expected events are based on NHSN national data collected in the previous years and risk adjusted using multivariate regression analysis. Both SIR and rates are currently being used to compare similar healthcare facilities at the state and national level. 15 7.

Unlike other quality and safety measures, surveillance of CLABSI has proven very helpful in the objective evaluation of the efficacy of performance improvement initiatives. 36 In 2002, a working group published guidelines for the prevention of intravascular device-related bloodstream infections. Among the key evidence-based recommendations were education and standardization of insertion and maintenance processes, the use of maximal sterile barrier precautions upon insertion, chlorhexidine skin preparation, antiseptic/antibiotic-impregnated central venous catheters for short- infection prevention measures and coordinated antimicrobial stewardship programs. 54, 55 ",
