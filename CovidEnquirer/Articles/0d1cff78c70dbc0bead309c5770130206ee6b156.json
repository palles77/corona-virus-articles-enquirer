            "text": "Adjuvant enhancing mucosal immune response is preferred in controlling many pathogens at the portal of entry. Earlier, we reported that a toll-like-receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist, resiquimod (R-848), stimulated the systemic immunity when adjuvanted with the inactivated Newcastle disease virus vaccine in the chicken. Here, we report the effect of R-848 when adjuvanted with live or inactivated avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) vaccines with special emphasis on mucosal immunity. Specific pathogen free (SPF) chicks (n = 60) were equally divided into six groups at two weeks of age and immunized with either inactivated or live IBV vaccine adjuvanted with or without R-848. Groups that received either PBS or R-848 served as control. A booster was given on 14 days postimmunization (dpi). R-848 enhanced the antigen specific humoral and cellular immune responses when coadministered with the vaccines as evidenced by an increase in the antibody titre in ELISA and stimulation index in lymphocyte transformation test (LTT) till 35 dpi and increased proportion of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells on 21 dpi in the flow cytometry. Interestingly, it potentiated the IgA responses in the tear and intestinal secretions when used with both live and inactivated IBV vaccines. The combination of IBV vaccine with R-848 significantly up-regulated the transforming growth factor beta 4 (TGF\u03b24) transcripts in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) than that of the respective vaccine per se. An enhanced secretory IgA response is likely due to the up-regulation of TGF\u03b24, which is responsible for class switching to IgA. In conclusion, co-administration of R-848 with inactivated or live IBV vaccine enhanced the systemic as well as mucosal immune responses in the chicken.",

            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis (IB) is an acute, highly contagious disease of all age groups of chicken and affects primarily the respiratory system with possible infection of renal and reproductive systems [1, 2] . It is a disease of global importance and listed in the world organization for animal health (OIE) diseases. Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), the causative agent of IB, belongs to the genus Coronavirus, family Coronoviridae, of order Nidovirales [3] . Vaccination with live attenuated and inactivated vaccines is the mainstay tool to control the IB [4] . As IBV enters the host through the mucosal surfaces and replicates in the epithelial cells, vaccines inducing mucosal immunity can prevent the entry of the pathogen before establishment of infection [5] . Studies indicate that local administration of attenuated IBV vaccines is effective as compared to systemic administration implying that respiratory mucosal immunity is essential for protection [6] [7] [8] . In fact, an increase in the lachrymal-fluid IgA levels in chickens increases the resistance against IBV infection [9] and re-infection [10] . Further, in the inbred chicken lines, resistance to IBV was correlated with higher IgA levels in the tear and saliva [11] .",

Conventional mucosal adjuvants like heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) from E. coli and cholera toxin (CT) from Vibrio cholerae are toxic to the host [12] . Owing to the immunostimulatory capacity, Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists are explored as an alternate and promising source for future adjuvant systems [13] . [14, 15] . Emerging evidence supports the notion that the TLR agonists increase the secretory IgA (sIgA) when used with the vaccine antigens [16] [17] [18] [19] . LPS, a TLR4 agonist, when used with inactivated Newcastle disease virus (NDV) vaccine significantly increased the mucosal and humoral immune responses [20] . Flagellin [21] and combination of CpG and poly I:C [22] increased the sIgA titres along with systemic immune responses in chicken with avian influenza virus vaccine. Resiquimod (R-848) (TLR7/8 agonist) and gardiquimod (TLR7 agonist) enhanced sIgA response besides cellular and humoral responses when used with virus like particles (VLPs) based Norwalk virus vaccine in the mice [17] . The response seen is equivalent to that seen when cholera toxin is used as adjuvant with the same antigen. Co-delivery of Norwalk VLPs with gardiquimod (TLR7 agonist) or CpG ODN (TLR9 agonist) produced strong systemic as well as mucosal immune responses in the mice [23] . Recently, we reported the adjuvant potential of R-848 in the chicken when used with inactivated NDV vaccine [24] . However, the effect of R-848 on the mucosal immune response is not explored in the chicken hitherto. Accordingly, we investigated the systemic as well as mucosal immune responses of live or inactivated IBV vaccine in the chicken when adjuvanted with R-848.",

The antiviral activity of TLR7 agonists has been reported against genital warts, herpes genitalias and molluscum contagiosum [32] . TLR 7/8 agonists like imiquimod and R-848 are FDA approved drugs for basal cell carcinoma, actinic keratosis and papilloma virus in the human [33] [34] [35] [36] . Recently, we reported the enhanced antigen specific cellular as well as humoral immune responses in the chicken when resiquimod (R-848) was used with inactivated NDV vaccine resulting in complete protection against virulent NDV challenge [24] . Since the adjuvant potential is likely to vary with the type of vaccine, we studied the effect of R-848 with IBV vaccine. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the effect of R-848 in modulating the mucosal immune response in the chicken.",

Further, the combination of R-848 withinactivated IBV vaccine showed higher antibody response than the vaccine alone group.

In support of the findings, it is reported that the administration of R-848 with VLPs of Norwalk virus enhanced the mucosal IgA response in the mice [17] . To explain the impressive sIgA response, we studied the relative expression of TGF-\u03b24 as it has a major role in the induction of IgA class switching [45] . It is well known that TGF-\u03b21, which is the orthologue of TGF-\u03b24, is primarily responsible for class switching of B cells to produce IgA in the mammals [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] . A significant increase in the relative copy number of TGF-\u03b24 (Fig. 6) suggests a role of R-848 in IgA class switching in the groups that received live or inactivated IBV vaccine. In this study, the TGF-\u03b24 transcripts were significantly higher in vaccine plus R-848 groups than that of the respective vaccine alone groups. Activation of TLR7 by R-848 would initiate the signaling cascade through the MyD88-dependent pathway, which might have resulted in the up-regulation of TGF-\u03b24 transcripts [51] . Studies by our group have shown that R-848 improves the vaccine response of NDV when adjuvanted [24] and has prophylactic potential against IBDV [29] . Thus, the adjuvant effect of R-848 with IBV is needed to be tested following challenge studies.",

The potential of R-848 to enhance mucosal immunity has translational significance in poultry vaccination. Fig. 4 . Lymphocyte proliferation specific to IBV antigen in the PBMCs collected from the SPF chickens following vaccination in the presence or absence of R-848. Birds of 2 week age were immunized with live or inactivated IBV vaccine in the presence or absence of R-848 (50\u03bcg/bird) with a booster 14 days later. PBMCs (n = 6/group on 14, 21, 28 dpi and n = 3/group on 35 dpi) were collected and stimulated with IBV antigen to assess lymphocyte proliferation using MTT dye at weekly interval from dpi 14. The experiment was repeated twice independently and data from the first experiment was used for analysis. Treatment effect was analyzed at each time point by One way ANOVA with Duncan's multiple range test to compare the pair-wise mean difference. Alpha error was set at 1%. **Indicate significant difference (P < 0.01) between the groups. dpi: day post-immunization. 5 . CD4 + and CD8 + cells (%) in the PBMCs of SPF chicken following IBV vaccination in the presence or absence of R-848. Birds of 2 week age were immunized with live or inactivated IBV vaccine in the presence or absence of R-848 (50\u03bcg/bird) with a booster 14 days later. The PBMCs (n = 6/group) were collected from the birds on 21 dpi and analyzed by flow cytometry following addition of chicken specific monoclonal antibodies. The experiment was repeated twice independently and data from the first experiment was used for analysis. Treatment effect was analyzed by One way ANOVA with Duncan's multiple range test to compare the pair-wise mean difference. Alpha error was set at 5%. *Indicate significant difference (P < 0.05) between the groups. dpi -day post-immunization. Fig. 6 . Quantitative real time PCR analysis of TGF-\u03b24 expression in the PBMCs of the SPF chicken following vaccination in the presence or absence of R-848. Birds of 2 week age were immunized with live or inactivated IBV vaccine in the presence or absence of R-848 (50\u03bcg/bird) with a booster 14 days later. The PBMCs (n = 6/group) were collected from the birds on 15 and 16 dpi (24 and 48 h post-booster) and the TGF-\u03b24 transcripts were analyzed by real time PCR using \u03b2-actin as the house keeping gene and expressed as n-fold increase or decrease relative to the control following 2 \u2212\u0394\u0394Ct method (34) . The experiment was repeated twice independently and data from the first experiment was used for analysis. Treatment effect was analyzed at each time point by One way ANOVA with Duncan's multiple range test to compare the pair-wise mean difference. Alpha error was set at 1%. **Indicate significant difference (P < 0.01) between the groups.",
