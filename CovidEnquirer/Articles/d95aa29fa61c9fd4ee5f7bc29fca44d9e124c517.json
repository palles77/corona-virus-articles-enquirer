Objectives: Evaluation of a diagnostic approach including multiplex PCR assays for revisiting the epidemiology and etiology of CAP in children at hospital. Study design: Children of all ages consulting at the Emergency Department of the University hospital of Saint-Etienne, France, during the 2012-2013 winter period were included. In addition to bacterial cultures, the following pathogens were detected using biplex commercially-available rt-PCR tests: adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, bocavirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, coronavirus, influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza viruses, Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumonia. Results: From 85 patients with CAP, at least one pathogen was identified in 81 cases (95.3%), including 4 bacterial exclusive infections (4.7%), 53 viral exclusive infections (62.4%) and 24 mixed infections (28.2%). Coinfection by at least two viruses was observed in 37 cases (43.5%). Mean age was higher in the case of documented bacterial infection (P < 0.05). In the subgroup of viral exclusive infection, the mean age of severe cases was 2.0 years vs 3.8 years in mild and moderate cases (P < 0.05). Conclusions: These findings highlight the huge proportion of CAP of viral origin, the high number of coinfection by multiple viruses and the low number of bacterial CAP, notably in children under 5 years, and address the need to re-evaluate the indications of empiric antimicrobial treatment in this age group.",

In developed countries, the systematic prescription of antimicrobial drugs to patients with CAP has led to a dramatic reduction in mortality linked to this pathology [2, 3] . However, a bacterial origin of CAP has not been documented in a large proportion of cases despite extensive aetiological investigations. The current recommendations [4] [5] [6] encourage pediatricians to prescribe a probabilistic antimicrobial treatment, even when no bacterial infection is documented, which results in prolonged use of antibiotics and in the possible selection of resistant strains within the endogenous flora [7] .",

At this time, most of the epidemiological data from pediatric CAP relied on traditional bacteriological cultures. With the occurrence of new diagnostic tools and notably of multiplex PCR assays able to simultaneously detect a large panel of viruses and atypical bacteria, it now appears that a large proportion of CAP could be related to viral infection [10] [11] [12] . Many studies have evaluated these new tools but most of them were limited to subgroups of children notably to the young [13, 14] , to hospitalized children [11, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] , or for selected pathogens [10, 12, 18, 19 ].",

It has been suggested that infection by several viruses could enhance the severity of CAP [12, [30] [31] [32] . In the present study, a trend was observed in the association between the mean number of infectious agents and the severity of CAP as defined above (P = 0.09); a larger effective size would have been needed to determine a statistically significant difference. In terms of clinical evolution, neither death nor major complications were reported in this study, despite rates of 30.6% for severe pneumonia and 42.4% for hospitalization. There was no statistical difference in the severity of CAP between viral and bacterial infections. Almost all of the children received antibiotics, which was unnecessary in a large proportion of cases (62.4%) for which only viruses were detected. This finding raises the question of the systematic use of antimicrobials to treat childhood CAP, which is still recommended in different guidelines [4] [5] [6] .",

This situation represents half of the cases recorded in this study: 62 children (72.9%) were less than five-years old, and 40 of them presented a mild or moderate CAP, which corresponds to 47.1% of all cases. The use of a rapid molecular test detecting a large set of viral and bacterial pathogens within 2 or 3 hours, such as that described in [33] , would allow an improvement in the management of the antimicrobial treatment. In the case of positive result, it would be recommended to avoid the use of amoxicillin as a first-intent therapy (or to prescribe erythromycin in the case of detection of an agent of atypical pneumonia) and to reconsider the use of antimicrobial treatment 24-48 h later according to the clinical evolution and to the results of bacterial cultures. Conversely, the negativity of the rapid test would lead to the empiric prescription of amoxicillin, as currently recommended [4] [5] [6] . It is obvious that this attitude would be dedicated to CAP with mild or moderate symptoms and that CAP with severe presentation at entry should include a systematic probabilistic antimicrobial therapy, whatever the results of PCR assay. The present results are indicative that this strategy could dramatically reduce the proportion of unnecessary antimicrobial treatments in mild or moderate child CAP. Wider studies are needed to prospectively evaluate the benefits of this approach in terms of patient recovery, prevention of antibiotic resistance and medical economy.",
