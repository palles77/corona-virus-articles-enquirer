            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is responsible for greater than $664 million direct loss to the US pork industry annually. 1 The causative agent, PRRS virus (PRRSV), is an enveloped positive-sense ribonucleic acid (RNA) virus that belongs to the family Arteriviridae. There are two known PRRSV genotypes, European (type I) and North American (type II), with varying inter-and intragenotypic, genetic, and antigenic diversity signifying the high mutagenic nature of the virus. 2 Since the 1990s, both modified live (PRRS-MLV) and inactivated PRRSV vaccines have been in use, but control of PRRS has remained unsuccessful. Moreover, PRRS-MLV has been implicated in the spread of mutated vaccine virus to susceptible pigs. 3 Available inactivated vaccines are safe, but poorly immunogenic. 4 Therefore, the development of a potent inactivated PRRSV vaccine is warranted.",

            "text": "There are limitations associated with current PRRSVkilled vaccines, such as the antigens are soluble in nature, poorly immunogenic, viral proteins degrade by proteolytic enzymes, insufficient antigenic mass in vaccine formulations, etc. Since PRRSV enters its host primarily through respiratory and genital mucosal surfaces, delivery of PRRSV vaccine by the noninvasive intranasal route to induce robust local mucosal immunity appears to be beneficial. Moreover, the primary target cells of PRRSV are alveolar and interstitial macrophages, and the virus causes disease primarily in the lungs. 5, 6 Intranasal immunization is not only efficient in stimulating protective immune responses in the lungs but also elicits immune responses at distant sites, such as gastric and genital mucosa. 7 Ultraviolet (UV) or chemical (eg, binary ethylenimine) inactivation of PRRSV preserves immunogenic epitopes. 8 UV-or binary ethylenimine-inactivated PRRSV has several advantages over PRRS-MLV: unlike the live PRRSV, inactivated virus does not downregulate secretion of the important innate cytokine interferon (IFN)-\u03b1; such an inactivation procedure preserves the viral neutralizing epitopes; and abrogation of development of regulatory T-cell subsets. [8] [9] [10] [11] However, the delivery of inactivated virus alone in a vaccine formulation is not efficacious, and it needs coupling with a potent adjuvant/s. 12 We have previously established adjuvant effects of Mycobacterium tuberculosis ([M. tb] whole-cell lysate [WCL] ) to PRRS-MLV. [13] [14] [15] M. tb WCL is an endotoxin-free extract containing only water-soluble components of the bacterium, shown to possess potent adjuvant effects in rodents, guinea pigs, and rabbits. 16, 17 Importantly, unlike complete Freund's adjuvant, M. tb WCL is free from water-insoluble toxic cellwall components of the bacterium. 18, 19 Therefore, M. tb WCL does not cause any toxicity or granulomatous inflammatory reaction at the site of injection or inoculation. 17 Components M. tb WCL, such as heat shock protein 70 and PE (Pro-Glu)/PPE (Pro-Pro-Glu) have been shown to possess potent adjuvant activity, driving primarily T-helper (Th)-1-biased responses. 20, 21 Biodegradable, biocompatible, nontoxic, repetitive polymers, such as poly(lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA)based micro/nanoparticles (NPs), are being used widely for targeted drug and vaccine delivery. 22 Moreover, PLGA is a US Food and Drug Administration-and European Medicines Agency-approved polymer for various human applications. Soluble vaccine antigens entrapped in PLGA NPs of up to 5 \u00b5m in size have been shown to protect encased antigen/drug from enzymatic or ionic degradation in vivo. 23, 24 Immunization with NP (200-600 nm size range) vaccines enhances IFN\u03b3 production, long-lasting antigen-specific T-cell response, and production of high-affinity neutralizing antibodies. [25] [26] [27] [28] Intranasally delivered particulate antigens are sampled readily by mucosal M-cells of the nasal lymphoid tissues and delivered to underlying professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the respiratory tract. 29 Recently, we have shown that a single-dose of PLGA NP-entrapped inactivated PRRSV (NP-KAg) vaccine delivered intranasally to pigs elicits anti-PRRSV immune responses. 30, 31 In order to reinforce further the efficacy of NP-KAg vaccine, we slightly modified the vaccine constituents and coadministered the vaccine with the potent adjuvant M. tb WCL twice intranasally. In vaccinated pigs, enhanced cross-protective humoral and cell-mediated immune responses against a challenged PRRSV were detected, which were associated with the complete clearance of detectable replicating challenged heterologous virus (not the viral RNA) in the blood.",

A total of 30 pigs were randomly divided into one of the ten groups (three pigs/group) and vaccinated with the indicated vaccine adjuvant formulation (Table 1) . Every dose of PRRSV vaccine had either 100 (low) or 500 (high) mg of semipurified viral protein equivalent to approximately 0.5\u00d710 6 or 2.5\u00d710 6 50% tissue-culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) of killed PRRSV, respectively, and adjuvant M. tb WCL (1 mg/dose/pig). The vaccine and adjuvant, either encapsulated in NPs or unencapsulated, were inoculated intranasally twice at 2-week intervals (2 mL/pig) ( Table 1) . Except pigs in group 1, all the other groups were challenged on postvaccination day 28 with the virulent heterologous North American PRRSV (type II) strain MN184 (5 \u00d7 10 5 TCID 50 /pig), which is genetically highly divergent (only 85% identical) to the vaccine strain VR2332. 2 Adjuvant and vaccine were entrapped separately and combined before immunization. The doses of the adjuvant and NP-KAg had been tested to be efficacious earlier. 15, 30, 34 Pigs were killed at postchallenge (PC) day 15. Pigs were monitored daily for respiratory disease, and rectal temperatures and body weights were recorded every third day postchallenge. Animals were maintained with food and water ad libitum, and samples collected and pigs killed as per the approved protocol of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Ohio State University. PRRSV-specific antibody responses were determined as described previously. 36 Briefly, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates were coated with pretitrated semipurified MN184 Ags (5 \u00b5g/mL) or with PRRSV-recombinant N, M, or GP5 proteins (5 \u00b5g/mL). A mean optical density (OD) value of 30 tenfold-diluted PRRSV-negative plasma samples plus twice the standard deviation was considered the positive-negative cutoff. The reciprocal of the highest dilution of the plasma sample that showed an OD value above the cutoff OD was considered the end titer. PRRSV-specific IgG 1 and IgG 2 antibodies in the plasma samples were analyzed as described previously. 37 Avidity of PRRSV-specific antibodies in the lungs and blood PRRSV-specif ic antibody avidity was determined as described previously, 38 with a few modifications. Briefly, the plasma samples (1:100) were added to PRRSV Ags-coated ELISA plates and incubated. Plates were washed four times, serially twofold diluted in NH 4 CN (5-0.313 M), and incubated for 10 minutes at room temperature. The remaining procedure was followed as described earlier to estimate PRRSV-specific antibodies. The OD value of the test sample from NH 4 CN-untreated (0 M) wells was considered 100% absorbance. The test-sample OD value from NH 4 CN-treated wells was compared to untreated (0 M) wells of the corresponding sample to estimate the retained Ag-Ab complex, which is expressed as percentage absorbance.",

Both sham-and entrapped NPs were circular in shape ( Figure 1A ). Dynamic light scattering of NPs determined their diameter-based distribution, and the mean diameter \u00b1 standard deviation of sham NPs, NP-KAg, and NP-M. tb WCL were 480\u00b153, 520\u00b141, and 650\u00b198 nm, respectively. Further, 85% of sham NPs, 92% of NP-M. tb WCL, and 78% of NP-KAg were in the size range of 400-700 nm. Interestingly, there was no difference among all three NPs with respect to surface electrostatic potential (-26 mV) measured by zeta potential, indicating that differential surface charges of entrapped proteins did not influence the net electrostatic potential of finally formed different NPs. After reconstitution of NPs entrapped with any agents in PBS, all the surface-associated agents will release immediately into the solution at time zero, and this is called burst release. 43 In freshly prepared (just 2 weeks old) NP-KAg, the burst release was 9.5%, and after 24 hours of reconstitution, 30.5% of protein was released ( Figure 1B ). Further, after 30 days, 61% of the entrapped vaccine protein was released ( Figure 1B) , and from the unlysed NP-KAg the remaining 39% of viral protein was recovered. In stored NP-KAg (1 year old), 13.6% burst release and 76% of released proteins at 30 days were detected.

Among the mucosal routes, intranasal delivery of NP-based vaccines induces higher and more prolonged duration of both IgG and IgA antibody responses compared to rectal, oral, and intramuscular routes of immunization. 45 PLGA NPs have the ability to mediate activation, maturation, and antigen presentation by APCs. 49 They facilitate sustained release of vaccine Ags and mediate induction of robust B-and T-cell responses. 50 We used PLGA (75:25) to entrap UV-inactivated PRRSV (VR2332) Ags.

A recent study has shown that the magnitude of CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses is dependent on the duration of available vaccine Ags, as effector T cells (also to a lesser extent memory T cells) require sustained antigenic stimulation for their expansion. 57 PLGA NPs promote cross-presentation of vaccine antigens due to their phagosome-disruptive properties inside DCs and macrophages, resulting in enhanced delivery of antigens to the cytosol for major histocompatibility complex class I loading and increased CD8 + T-cell effector response. [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] It also helps in the generation of memory CD8 + T-cell response and clearance of invading pathogens. 56 Consistent with the other studies, rapid uptake of NP-KAg vaccine by PAM cells was noticed, suggesting the ability of PLGA NPs to deliver vaccine Ags rapidly and efficiently to target cells. 50, 64 Clinically, only mock (group 2) and KAg (group 3) vaccinated, MN184 virus-challenged pigs had irregular fever with reduced feed intake during the first 2 weeks postchallenge, and such physiological changes were absent in other pig groups.

It is desirable to have both vaccine Ags and adjuvant in the same NPs, considering the added benefits of delivery of antigen and adjuvant to the same APC. However, we entrapped them separately, because it is difficult to differentially quantify entrapped vaccine proteins from the adjuvant, as the M. tb WCL principally contains proteins. However, in future, we will evaluate such combined entrapped vaccines.",

Enhanced avidity of polyclonal antibodies in vaccinated or infected animals is positively correlated with their VN titers. 38 Avidity of PRRSV-specific IgG in the plasma of group 6 pigs gradually increased, becoming significantly higher at PC day 15 in NP-KAg plus M. tb WCL-vaccinated pigs, attributed to gradual domination of high-affinity B-cell clones. 38 NPs have been shown to interact with pathogenrecognition receptors on APCs (especially B cells), leading to affinity maturation and production of high-avidity antibodies. 69 Virus-specific neutralizing antibodies play an important role in the clearance of PRRSV viremia 46,70-72 by limiting the viral uptake by target cells. 73 The mean VN titer in adjuvanted NP-KAg-vaccinated pigs was higher than the proposed titer of eight, which cleared the viremia at 2 weeks postchallenge. 46, 74 The clearance of detectable, replicating PRRSV was absent as early as 6 days postchallenge, which could be attributed to early appearance of VN antibodies, possibly targeted against putative neutralizing epitopes present on PRRSV GP5 and M proteins. 75 We will consider analyzing viral load at earlier time points in future studies. Normally, PRRSV-specific VN activity is detectable only after 3-4 weeks in infected pigs, 76, 77 and significantly varies with the strain of PRRSV. In adjuvanted NP-KAg-vaccinated pigs, VN titers were detectable by 1 week postchallenge and later steadily increased. Thus, using our NP-based vaccination approach, it is possible to induce high levels of long-lasting PRRSV VN titers and to elicit an effective memory response. 56 Inactivated vaccines elicit predominantly Th2 responses, 78 but NP-based vaccines have been shown to drive either Th1-Th2-balanced or Th1-biased responses. 45 In adjuvanted NP-KAg-vaccinated pigs, a balanced Th1-Th2 response was observed, indicated by increased levels of virus-specific IgG 1 and IgG 2 production and enhanced IFN\u03b3 and IL-4 responses.

Since we detected increased but comparable frequency of IFN\u03b3-secreting cells in other lymphocyte subsets of both stimulated and unstimulated PBMCs of group 6 pigs, our data also indicate that other T-effector cells and NK cells were actively secreting IFN\u03b3 as part of the response to the PRRSV-challenge infection in vivo.

PLGA encapsulation of vaccine Ags (hepatitis B core antigen) and adjuvant (monophosphoryl lipid A) failed to increase an antibody response. 79 Another advantage of NP-based vaccines is their ability to reduce greatly the required vaccine dose. A recent study has estimated that a dose of PLGA NP-based vaccine could be reduced by as much as 63 times compared to administration of a Freund's incomplete adjuvant emulsified vaccine. 80 Although in pigs vaccinated with adjuvanted NP-KAg (100 \u00b5g/pig/dose) vaccine, a substantial level of immune response was elicited, the virus clearance was not satisfactory, indicating the need for a suitable vaccine dose (500 \u00b5g/dose) for better viral clearance. PLGA-mediated vaccine-delivery systems are getting global recognition, due to their flexibility to engineer particles of any size, charge, content, and cell-targeting properties, and they have proved to be highly effective in delivery of both subunit and inactivated whole-pathogen vaccines, especially to mucosal sites. 7 In conclusion, intranasal delivery of PLGA NP-entrapped inactivated PRRSV vaccine adjuvanted with soluble M. tb WCL has the potential to induce cross-protective immune response in pigs. Future studies are aimed at elucidating the duration of cross-protective immune responses in vaccinated pigs and detection of challenge PRRSV in lymphoid tissues. In addition, fractionation of M. tb WCL to identify the important component/s involved in potent adjuvant effects and evaluation of immunostimulatory effects of entrapped M. tb lysate compared to soluble lysate using porcine DCs and macrophages will also be considered.",
