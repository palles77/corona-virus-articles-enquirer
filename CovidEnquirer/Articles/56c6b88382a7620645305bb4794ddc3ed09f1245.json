All these systems thrive on stability, which can easily be challenged by unexpected risks. This study compares zooanthroponosis and climate change-induced sea level rise through a cost-benefit analysis in Korea. Borrowing from other methodological approaches, this study shows that the cost-benefit estimation is consistent with the existing macroeconomic speculations, which assume potential loss of GDP due to the two risks. This paper also presents a policy alternative of creating research institutions specializing in the two risks from a cost-benefit perspective as a prerequisite for the \"Creative Economy\".",

            "text": "Societies in the 21st century require more proactive management of risks in many areas due to the complexities people have built into socioeconomic systems, ranging from science and technology, economic, and finance to education, entertainment, and tourism infrastructure. These systems thrive on stability, which can easily be challenged by unexpected risks (Commission, 2008; Fraser et al., 2004) . Thus, preparing for unexpected risks is a significant component of sustainable growth management. We have focused more on traditional factors of production even when we consider creative economy. Theoretical and practical debate, such as the introduction of more robotics can be an agenda from the supply side. Yet, in thinking of creative economy, just considering supply and demand will not be sufficient. Our global economy as a whole can be endangered with an unexpected outbreak of a symptom, whether it could come from naturally or unnaturally. Actualizing the creative economy depends on risk management at social and global levels, and especially depends on the most serious upcoming risks this research selected, which we tend to under invest due to our socio-economic decision making system. This paper, with the backdrop, compares economic risks that may arise from climate change-based sea level increases (Stern, 2007b) and zooanthroponosis by conducting a cost-benefit analysis using data on the Korean economy (Parker, 2013b) . By comparing the two risks, this study suggests the relative magnitude of preparation that societies may choose to undertake. Second, this study shows how a policy measure could be cost effective by proposing the hypothetical alternative of creating research institutions for both the climate change and zooanthroponosis cases. Specifically, a cost-benefit analysis was presented to examine whether these institutions can be effective against the risks related to climate change and disease.",

In the past 15 years in the US, about 17,367 medical cases have been reported, of which 1654 lives were lost (Barrett, 2014) . Delving further into the cases, in 2003, in 17 hospitals in four counties in the state of Colorado, 80 of 221 hospitalized patients were investigated. Among them, 38 patients participated in a longitudinal study for 5 years. From this patient group, a median medical cost of US$22,628 was found.

While the difference between the actual GDP size between the US and Korea is more than 10 times, an individual level consumption or PPP level comparison roughly gives about a ratio of 1:2 between the two countries. Based on this assumption, if cases of the West Nile Virus should arise, individual level medical costs could be between US$14,000 and 15,000; and if about 0.027% of the total population of 48 million people in South Korea contracts the virus, the estimated total medical costs would be approximately KRW195 billion. The calculation is based on 1300 patients, of which 500 patients were from the Seoul and Gyung gi Province, which takes about half of the population, and the other 800 patients from 8 major cities generating 100 patients each. This figure is compared in terms of absolute size with the estimation from this study in the following section.",

Australia has established the National Tidal Center (NTC), and Japan, the Coastal Movement Data Center (CMDC), both of which are designed to cope with the risks associated with sea level rise. With these organizations taking their duty and with organizations and research groups working on the issue, several publications of these institutions warn of the danger of sea level rise, such as \"Coastal Sensitivity to Sea level Rise: Focus on the Mid-Atlantic Region\" by the Climate Change Science Program (2009) and National Climate Assessment (2013) and the UK's \"Adapting to Climate Change\" (2013). In Australia, research initiatives such as \"Climate Change Risks to Australia's Coast: National Assessment\" (2009) can also be considered a valid effort in this field (Parker, 2013a; National Research Council, 2012; Katsman et al., 2011) .",

Based on this logic, this analysis assigned a 10% a priori impact expectation for each sector. While this seems to be very significant, other factors to be multiplied in the formula will dramatically reduce the absolute size of the impact from SARS. The information usage rate, another element in the formula, denotes the possibility of given scientific knowledge of the impact of the disease (in this case 10%) on a specific sector, and seeks to determine the possibility that the sector will utilize the information. In this analysis, the agricultural and fishery sectors were given 10% for both expected impact on GDP and information usage increase rate as an exception. Together, the calculation of the impact is designed to be conservative. The last element of the decision rate denotes the possibility that each sector will actually use the information in decisionmaking, when knowing the expected impact and increased usage of information. The outcome from the formula is conservative in estimating the impact from SARS for two reasons. The first reason is that this is the lower bound estimate. Second, to produce a macroeconomic level estimation, it seems safer to be conservative, especially in the costbenefit analysis, by not exaggerating.",

Thus, the top-down and bottom-up (sector-wise build up) approaches showed only minimal differences in calculating the loss of GDP. It is quite clear that the calculation was very conservative in estimating possible damage to the economy, since the formula itself was designed to reflect how industries will use the scientific information, and how in that process, a buffering effect was taking place. For example, in reflecting the information usage increase rate, agricultural and fishery sectors were given 10%, while other sectors were assigned 5%. Similarly, the decision rate, which shows whether industries actually make decisions based on calculated risks, for the agricultural and fishery sectors was 12%, while other sectors were given only 2%.",

As mentioned earlier, other major countries have established similar organizations, yet the size varies depending on national characteristics. Considering this factor, this study prepared a small organizational design to perform an organizational cost-benefit analysis. As the table shows, with a 10-year time horizon, costs can be itemized, and in year 1, total costs were estimated to be KRW11.64 billion (or US$11 million approximately). One peculiar element in the table is the benefit element from \"direct research.\" This element was to highlight a case in which a small institute outsources most of its research projects. In this case, it was argued that this outsourcing is minimized, and therefore, the amount that was to be outsourced was added as a benefit element in the lower cells of the table.",

The total benefit was added for the inflationary factor for the upcoming years by multiplying the 3% annual increase. With these settings, the cost-benefit ratio of establishing a special institute aimed at sea level rise risks was between 11.26 and 11.27, which shows that about 11 times, the benefits can be attained through the establishment of an organization. This is consistent with what WMO has claimed as the benefit size from weather-related research for the economy (Adams et al., 1995) . WMO claims that about 10 times the benefits will be generated with research (WMO, 2003 (WMO, , 2007 . In this case, slightly higher numbers are suggested as a policy measure for establishing an institute (Frei, 2009 ).",

Implications for the creative economy: implications for vaccine research and industry against the risk and climate change adaptation What makes this research applicable for the creative economy comes from the notion that managing risks will determine whether we can make our economy prosper or not. Traditionally, we have underestimated the importance of prevention from the risks this paper has raised. We have focused more on traditional factors of production even when we consider creative economy. Theoretical and practical debate, such as the introduction of more robotics can be an agenda from the supply side. Yet, in thinking of creative economy, just considering supply and demand will not be sufficient. Our global economy as a whole can be endangered with an unexpected outbreak of a symptom, whether it could come from naturally or unnaturally.",

Against the understanding, this research tried to show the relative magnitude of the zooanthroponosis in conventional economic numbers. Second, this research tried to stereotype the risks that making creative economy may be faced. This study focused on both zooanthroponosis and climate changed based sea level change. Both risks can endanger our civilization from the bottom. Especially, the reason why this study focused on the zooanthroponosis case with a special attention to establishing a research center specialized for the type diseases was its implication for the creative economy in a narrow sense. While people can easily be drawn by the sheer numbers of potential danger from such diseases, it is not easy to get the public budget for preventing the risks. Making a research center like this will need public money, which is tax money. This will require a series of thorough feasibility tests. Ironically, however, to pass the test, cost benefit analysis results should not be big enough. An implication from the dynamic is that as a society as a whole, we may underinvest in vaccine research and production until when we finally acknowledge the risks. Third, the same story can be told for the climate change. Society has traditionally underestimated the potential danger from the risk. After the Stern report of the U.K., people hailed the implications from the report until people have turned away from them, due to slowly changing nature of the phenomenon. After the Stern report, research communities have, in some sense, over reacted by reproducing the implications, which have undermined the original intention and warning from the phenomenon. This chain reaction has eventually may result in underinvestment at the societal level as well as global level.",
