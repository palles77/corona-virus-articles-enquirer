Once it was a vibrant fishing and farming community, but today its economy is reliant on tourism. The majority of enterprises provide only a marginal income and most workers are seasonal. Yet, this business provides the residents with the economic rationale to remain on the island, and in doing so, enables them to retain their existing social networks, sense of place, and connection to their ancestral homes. Thus, the net social benefits of pursuing subsistence-level tourism outweigh the limited economic gains.",

            "text": "Tourism is a spatially selective activity that is clustered in relatively compact areas focused around shopping and business precincts or anchored by primary attractions (Tunbridge and Ashworth 1996) . The degree of spatial selectivity is especially noticeable in a place like Hong Kong, where the Special Administrative Region's (SAR) mountainous topography dictates that all development is concentrated tightly along the coastal fringes of Victoria Harbor, on reclaimed land, or in bedroom suburbs located in lowland areas of the New Territories (HKY 2001) . It is this compactness that gives the city its distinctive skyline. While many people consider Hong Kong to be one of the world's most densely populated cities, in reality about three quarters of its 1,092 sq km landmass is undeveloped and almost 40% of it is gazetted as Bob McKercher has diverse tourism interests in sustainability, culture, product and regional development, and spatial movements. He is a Professor in The Hong Kong Polytechnic University's School of Hotel and Tourism Management (Hong Kong, China. Email <hmbob@polyu.edu.hk>). Candace Fu is a graduate of the same institution. They undertook this study out of mutual interests in the disappearing lifestyles of New Territory residents. Annals of Tourism Research, Vol. 33, No. 2, pp. 508-524, 2006 \u00d3 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. (AFCD 2004) . Most of the undeveloped land can be found in the New Territories or on outlying islands. These rural areas have largely missed out on the economic miracle that is Hong Kong, in general, and on the tourism miracle, in particular. Many of the villages in the New Territories have suffered depopulation and economic stagnation. Within one generation, formerly vibrant fishing and farming communities settled by ethnic minority Hakka and Tanka people for more than 300 years have entered steep decline. Ghost towns, decaying villages occupied by remnant populations, and abandoned farmland and aquaculture operations are now the norm in many areas. These areas have also undergone economic transformation to become part of the pleasure periphery, providing nature-based, camping, and small-scaled domestic tourism opportunities for city dwellers wishing to escape crowded urban conditions. This paper presents a study of those individuals who have chosen to remain on one such peripheral island, Tap Mun, and who now own and operate small businesses serving tourists. Tap Mun is a small island (1.7 sq km) located off the northeast coast of Hong Kong (Figure 1 ). Its name was first given by fishermen for the island's resemblance to a Buddhist pagoda. It once had 5,000 residents and served as the supply station for other coastal communities. However, it began to decline in the 60s as water pollution, a decline in farming, and few opportunities for young people saw its population drift into the city or emigrate overseas. Today, perhaps as few as 100 mostly elderly people live there permanently. The island is a popular hiking and camping destination for Hong Kong residents. It is also a popular spot for charter tours that deposit upwards of 2,000 people on any given Sunday during the summer season for sightseeing and a seafood dinner.",

A growing body of emerging literature documents the positive and negative impacts of second home development on host communities (Cassado-Diaz 1999; Dredge 2001; Tress 2002; Visser 2004) . Interestingly, there is no tradition of second or holiday home development in Hong Kong. A limited land supply means that any land released for development in remote communities is earmarked for residential development. Existing village houses in communities such as those found in Tap Mun, are not suitable for redevelopment as second homes. Legislation enacted in 1905 dictated that their maximum size had to be 436 sq ft or less and that they had to be single story structures with a pitched roof and a cock loft. A side room was added for cooking, ablutions, and storage. There was no indoor plumbing. Windows were not glassed in; instead they were small openings protected by iron bars. The policy was modified in the 60s to permit the construction of two-story homes with flat roofs and again in the 80s to expand the floor space (Hopkinson and Lao 2003) . Older houses were abandoned when newer ones were built and have now fallen into such disrepair that they are structurally unsound. Additionally, Hong Kong residents tend to be superstitious and believe these places to be haunted. Consequently, few people are interested in redeveloping them.",

The Tanka are thought to be descended from the original inhabitants of Hong Kong (Rodwell 1992; Lee and DeStefano 2002) . They were traditionally nomadic fisher folk who spent their lives on their boats and rarely if ever went ashore. The influx of Punti people (the ancestors of the modern Cantonese) in the 1100s supplanted the Tanka and pushed them to the coastal margins.

The coast became a desolate wasteland as it was turned into a military zone (Lee and DeStefano 2002) . The order was rescinded in 1669, but because most of the evacuees had perished during their period of forced eviction, repopulation was slow and sporadic. In response the Manchu rulers invited people from outside the region to migrate and the Hakka, people who had moved from northern China some generations earlier, responded. The term Hakka is somewhat derogatory and literally means ''guest family,'' in reference to their outcast status in their adopted homeland of Southern China. According to Lee and DeStefano the Hakka were a ''people proud of their language and traditions [and] they did not assimilate themselves with the mainstream culture of Southern China. As such they were never quite welcomed by the majority Cantonese''. As a result ''partly to preserve their own culture, but mainly to protect themselves from violent acts of xenophobia, the Hakka tended to live away from mainstream populations on poorer lands' ' (2002:53) . The only land available to them was found on hillsides and other marginal areas leased from the Cantonese (Hung 1998) , placing them in a socially inferior position economically indebted to the dominant cultural community (Dudgeon and Corlett 1994) . Thus, the Hakka and Tanka inhabitants found themselves relegated to the geographical, social, and political margins, where they coexisted with some enmity with the dominant Cantonese population (Welsh 1997) , continuing to speak their own dialects and practicing their own traditions. Many elderly Hakka and Tanka still speak their own dialects.",

It also earned the nickname ''mini Macau'' as the village's main street ''was very busy with various kinds of gambling activities.'' But the winds of social and economic change were blowing as Hong Kong modernized quickly in the 60s. Tap Mun, along with many other isolated islands, was on the cusp of rapid transformation leading to decline as traditional agriculture and fishing activities were abandoned while the region underwent its own industrial revolution. A marine biologist in the 60s commented, ''you have a sense of making a journey through a doomed landscape.

Social change continued as the Tanka abandoned their traditional lifestyle of living in their boats and moved into permanent housing on shore. The New Fishermen's Village was established in 1964 by a group of villagers who migrated to New Zealand and remitted money. The construction of this village represented the last new construction on the island.

This characteristic can be found in the remaining villagers, explaining to a large extent why they have chosen to stay. One elderly Hakka women stated that her family has been living on the island for five generations, while the wife of a food stall owner traced her family tree back six generations. Mrs. Li a Tanka women of about 70 said that her family has lived on the island for 13 generations. Yet, this generation is the last one that has retained such a strong sense of place, for in each case, the children have either emigrated overseas or moved to suburbs in Kowloon or the New Territories. In spite of the strong Chinese tradition of children looking after their parents, few residents interviewed were interested in moving in with their families. The Lai couple is typical. Although their sons and daughters are living in the New Territories, they choose to stay on the island. They visit for short periods of time, but become restless and complain of the lack of fresh air. Another woman continues to stay on the island while her husband and daughters live in the New Territories. Her family refuses to visit even during weekends. Another says that in spite of the inconveniences, she stays on the island because she does not get along with her daughter-in-law. As she commented, ''I could hardly live peacefully with my daughter-in-law, maybe we are too old to understand why sometimes they would do something . . . we just end up quarrelling.'' Comfort, familiarity, and strong social network also emerged as important reasons to stay, even though residents realized island life is becoming increasingly isolated. The husband of a water-taxi operator stated that they have chosen not to live with their children in a public housing estate because they are accustomed to the simple life of the island. She rises at 6:00 and normally goes to bed about 5:00 in the afternoon. Another woman added, ''it is just free and secure to live here, I can just wander around and leave my house open without any locks. I tried to live with my children for a few days, but I was just nervous and dared not to leave the house. I have heard of too many cases about elderly people being cheated.'' Another interviewee, who was sitting in the backyard talking to three other Hakka women, said, ''villagers here are just nice and friendly. I can chat with them at any time and occasionally play card games with them. We can entertain ourselves here while when I was living outside with my children, I got a feeling of being caught in a cage. I could talk to nobody but myself.'' While the more aged residents may stay because of choice, those residents in their late 40s and early 50s indicated that they lacked the necessary skills to find suitable work off-island. Typically, they felt they were too old and too unskilled to find work elsewhere. Were they to leave, they would be relegated to the economic margins of Hong Kong. By staying, they can enjoy a relatively simple and stress free lifestyle.",

Local tours are popular for two reasons. First, they provide access that is otherwise not available to remote areas. Car ownership rates are low (less than six cars per 100 residents, compared with more than 60 cars per 100 US residents). In jurisdictions where car ownership rates are higher, people will selfdrive to these attractions, but in Hong Kong, tour operators fill the niche.

Most of the permanent residents now live in the New Fishermen's Village which is situated 500 m to the east of the main ferry pier.

Most tourists follow the main path that leads to the main street of the original village, past the temples and on to the hiking trails, and do not deviate to the path to the village. Only a small number of elderly women and shopkeepers continue to live in the original village, which is now largely abandoned and in a poor state of repair. 518 Much of the research on the relationship between tourism and local residents or other stakeholders is framed within a conflict context. But as McKercher, Ho and du Cros (2005) illustrate, conflict is most likely to occur during periods of rapid expansion, resulting in a shift of power balances between stakeholders. Negative attitudes are most likely to occur when otherwise stable systems are pushed to the edge of chaos. But conflict is a transitional stage and, over time, relationships between stakeholders tend to stabilize.
