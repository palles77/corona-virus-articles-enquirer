The aim of this study was to evaluate the immune cross-reactivity between human and avian infl uenza (H5N1) strains in healthy donors vaccinated for seasonal infl uenza A (H1N1)/(H3N2). A small frequency of CD4 T cells specifi c for subtype H5N1 was detected in several persons at baseline, and seasonal vaccine administration enhanced the frequency of such reactive CD4 T cells. We also observed that seasonal vaccination is able to raise neutralizing immunity against infl uenza (H5N1) in a large number of donors. No correlation between infl uenzaspecifi c CD4 T cells and humoral responses was observed. N1 may possibly be a target for both cellular and humoral cross-type immunity, but additional experiments are needed to clarify this point. These fi ndings highlight the possibility of boosting cross-type cellular and humoral immunity against highly pathogenic avian infl uenza A virus subtype H5N1 by seasonal infl uenza vaccination.",

According to the antigenic differences in nucleoprotein and matrix proteins, 3 types of infl uenza viruses (A, B, and C) have been described. Infl uenza viruses A and B are associated with seasonal illness and death, whereas infl uenza virus C causes mild infections (1, 2) . Infl uenza A viruses are subtyped on the basis of the antigenic differences on external hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) glycoproteins. Human type A infl uenza virus subtypes have been limited to H1, H2, and H3 and to N1 and N2 (3) . Several HAs and NAs have been isolated from avian hosts; occasionally, they have been associated with human outbreaks (4, 5) .",

Neutralizing antibodies are completely protective against secondary challenges only with closely related strains, but they are ineffective against viruses with major antigenic divergence. For this reason, current infl uenza vaccines are prepared annually on the basis of World Health Organization forecasts on the most probable infl uenza A and B virus strains thought to be circulating in the next seasonal outbreak (5, 7) . By contrast, cellular responses to cross-reactive epitopes may provide a substantial degree of protection against serologically distinct viruses (9) . The ability of infl uenza viruses to mutate and reassort their HA-NA genome segments between different animal species is a main concern because immunity generated by previous infections or vaccinations is unable to prevent infection by itself, although it may reduce virus replication and spread (8) (9) (10) .",

Infl uenza virus (H5N1) was inactivated by exposure to UV light for 10 min, and complete inactivation of UV-exposed virus was checked by infecting MDCK monolayers with undiluted preparation and by back-titrating the infectivity after 5 days postinfection. Four synthetic peptides of the infl uenza (H5N1) were purchased from Biodesign International (Kennebunk, ME, USA). The sequence of these peptides is specifi c for H5-C-terminal (15 aa), H5-middle region (14 aa), and N1-C-terminal (15 aa) and for N1middle region (16 aa), with no cross-matching with other HA and NA sequences. These peptides can bind different HLA-DRB1 alleles, as established according to the SYF-PEITHI site (www.syfpeithi.de). Specifi cally, N1-specifi c peptides can bind the following HLA-DR alleles: HLA-DRB1*0101, B1*0301, B1*0401, B1*0701, B1*1101, B1*1501. The H5-specifi c peptide from the N-terminal region binds several HLA-DR alleles (HLA-DRB1*0101, B1*0301, B1*0401, B1*0701, B1*1101, B1*1501). In contrast, the H5-specifi c peptide from the middle region did not appear to bind any HLA-DR alleles. According to the HLA-DRB1 allele frequency in the local population, these peptides can be effi ciently presented by most (up to 84%) of study participants.",

However, antibodies to both anti-infl uenza (H5N1) and infl uenza vaccine are raised by vaccination.

This fi nding may be explained by hypothesizing that older people, although not previously exposed to H5N1 subtype, may have gained protective immunity by previous infections sustained by circulating infl uenza virus strains. It has also been shown that immunity to the N1 NA from the human infl uenza virus cross-reacts with the avian N1 NA virus and that this cross-reactivity protects mice against infection with the avian infl uenza virus (H5N1) (26) . All these fi ndings may be explained by hypothesizing that cross-reactive immunity is targeting the N1 NA antigen. However, whether cross-reactive antibodies to NA and CD4 T cells would be protective against illness and death, especially from infl uenza (H5N1) infection is not known. Further studies will be necessary to elucidate this point.",
