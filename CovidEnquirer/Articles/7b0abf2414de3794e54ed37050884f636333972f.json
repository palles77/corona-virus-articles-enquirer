To better track public health events in these situations, agencies can conduct event-based surveillance, which is defined as the organized collection, monitoring, assessment, and interpretation of unstructured information regarding public health events that may represent an acute risk to human health. 1 When conducting event-based surveillance, information can be collected through formal channels, such as already-established public health surveillance systems; in such instances, event-based surveillance can be complementary to indicator-or case-based surveillance systems that collect information on individual cases rather than events. Event-based surveillance can also be conducted through informal channels, such as through monitoring media reports, blogs, or even social media. Because events reported through informal channels commonly involve unconfirmed media reports, they must be verified before any action is taken.",

Surveillance, including event-based surveillance, is now being highlighted as part of the ''detect'' element of the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA), launched in 2014, which works toward making the world more safe and secure from disease threats through building capacity to better ''Prevent, Detect, and Respond'' to those threats. Capacity to ''detect'' disease threats is built by establishing and strengthening global networks for real-time biosurveillance; strengthening rapid, transparent reporting and laboratory sample sharing; strengthening laboratory systems; and deploying an effective biosurveillance workforce. 2 Facilitating detection is the Biosurveillance Indications and Warning Analytic Community (BIWAC), which is a self-organized, informal biosurveillance informationsharing group with participants from multiple US government agencies. The BIWAC shares data via unsophisticated web interfaces (eg, password-protected internet interface) and has focused on interagency collaboration and partnership. 3 A key member of the BIWAC is the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Branch (AFHSB), which also houses the Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System (GEIS). 4 Pre-dating the GDDOC, GEIS was created in 1997 to provide a mechanism in the Department of Defense (DoD) to centralize coordination of surveillance efforts conducted by the DoD, including outbreak response, epidemiologic training and capacity building, and the support of research and innovation in the US military and partner organizations. 4 The GDDOC has a team of 6 staff and a director with professionally diverse backgrounds, including epidemiology, microbiology, and human, veterinary, and tropical medicine; it is situated in dedicated space located in CDC's Emergency Operations Center (EOC), with which the GDDOC liaises both during GDDOC-supported international deployments of CDC teams and also when the EOC is activated to respond to an international disease event.",

Coordinated by the World Health Organization (WHO), GOARN is an independent collaboration of institutions and networks ready to respond to all-hazard threats of international importance. 5 Typically, the GDDOC monitors outbreaks of infectious disease and, to a lesser extent, events involving other disease threats, including disasters, intoxications, and chemical, radiological, or nuclear events. The GDDOC also monitors outbreaks of unknown etiology, many of which are later determined to have an infectious cause; outbreaks among animals are also monitored for known zoonotic diseases and are continually assessed to determine whether human cases are associated with a particular outbreak. 6 The GDDOC was created to alert CDC programs as soon as possible for the purpose of responding rapidly to mitigate the effects of an event, and, by conducting event-based surveillance, the GDDOC is able to better position CDC to respond earlier. Through rapid information gathering, prompt verification, and timely dissemination of information, the GDDOC ensures that CDC is always prepared to respond. CDC response teams can deploy internationally within 24 hours of learning about an outbreak.",

The 5 potential top threats were not selected on the basis of an analytical algorithm or quantitative method. They were: avian influenza A (H5N1), cholera, poliomyelitis, enterovirus-71, and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, with addenda of MERS-Coronavirus and avian influenza A (H7N9), both of which were newly emerging. The same judgment was used to arrive at the top potential threats during 2013 to 2016, and the rationale for the selection of each is provided here. These threats have been attributed to recent or current outbreaks around the world, and future potential international outbreaks are not limited to those described in this article. Further, the GDDOC is continuously monitoring threats that could evolve into international outbreaks in the near future that would warrant placement in future updates to this report.",

Influenza B viruses can cause seasonal epidemics, influenza C viruses typically cause mild respiratory illness and do not cause epidemics, and influenza D viruses primarily affect cattle and are not known to cause illness in people. 9 Novel influenza A viruses refer to viruses of animal origin that have infected humans and that are antigenically and genetically distinct from seasonal influenza A viruses circulating among people. We closely monitor novel influenza A viruses, because influenza A viruses continue to evolve and because zoonotic transmission could herald an increasing pandemic influenza health threat. If a novel influenza A virus acquires the ability for sustained human-tohuman transmission, a pandemic can result. Accordingly, early detection of pandemic-potential viruses may aid in the control and possible prevention of the next pandemic. Although a swine-origin influenza A virus caused the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, 10, 11 and sporadic transmission of swineorigin influenza A viruses to humans (termed ''variant viruses'') continue to be detected in the United States and in other countries with appropriate laboratory capacity, the public health threat posed by avian influenza A viruses appears to be higher because of their diversity and wide circulation among birds worldwide; the birds' migratory flyways may also be conducive to spread of influenza A viruses. Furthermore, some previous pandemic influenza A viruses have been partly of avian origin. 11",

Avian influenza A viruses are classified on the basis of molecular characteristics and pathogenicity criteria as ''highly pathogenic'' or ''low pathogenic,'' which generally refers to the extent of disease in infected poultry. Highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus infection of poultry can be rapidly fatal, whereas low-pathogenic avian influenza A virus infection of poultry may be asymptomatic or cause only very mild disease. However, sporadic human infections with either low-pathogenic or highly pathogenic avian influenza A viruses can result in a wide spectrum of illness, ranging from mild to severe to fatal disease. The zoonotic disease potential is attributable to the close relationship humans share with birds: production (ie, as a food source) or companionship. Risk factors for human infection with avian influenza A viruses include direct or close exposure to infected poultry, including backyard poultry, or working at or visiting a live poultry market. Although several novel influenza A viruses have been identified that are circulating among birds (eg, H5N1, H5N6, H6N1, H7N2, H7N3, H7N7, H7N9, H9N2, H10N7, H10N8), 2 subtypes of avian influenza A viruses have caused the highest number of human infections and are of special concern.",

Since then, infections in humans with low-pathogenic avian influenza A (H7N9) virus infection have been reported from throughout China. 24 As of April 2017, there were nearly 1,400 infections in humans with avian influenza A (H7N9), with at least 530 deaths reported to WHO, 25 including those reported from China's Special Administrative Region (SAR) of Hong Kong (21 infections). Of particular concern are those that were acquired in China and then subsequently exported to other countries and later diagnosed, allowing potential autochthonous transmission in those areas, including Taiwan SAR (5), Canada (2), Macao SAR (2), and Malaysia (1). 25 Most reported infections with avian influenza A (H7N9) have been hospitalized with pneumonia, and decedents had multi-organ failure. 26 Risk factors for H7N9 virus infection are visiting or working at a live poultry market and raising backyard poultry in China. 27, 28 Prevention measures have included the temporary closure and decontamination of live poultry markets. 29, 30 While studies have shown that the exposure potential of avian influenza A (H7N9) virus persists in live poultry markets, closure and decontamination of these markets may rapidly reduce the occurrence of infections of avian influenza A (H7N9) virus in poultry, thus preventing transmission of the virus to humans. 31 During the fifth epidemic of this outbreak, which began October 1, 2016, there was a significant increase in human infections with avian influenza A (H7N9) compared with the first 4 epidemics. 32, 33 The number of provinces with H7N9 infections has increased, and some human infections with highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H7N9) virus have been reported in 2017, suggesting ongoing evolution of H7N9 viruses in poultry. 34 We are constantly monitoring disease reports that not only report human illness, but that also report detection of H7N9 virus in poultry, including backyard poultry and in live poultry markets.",

And like sub-Saharan Africa, with a less than ideal healthcare infrastructure, the well-proven risk of explosive epidemics in Haiti and of spread to other nations remains as long as cholera is present. 39 To combat endemic and epidemic cholera, in 2013 WHO created the world's first oral cholera vaccine (OCV) stockpile, which continues to expand. 40 Tanzania; outbreaks in Guinea and Malawi; and in endemic areas such as Bangladesh and DRC. 41 Also of note, to prevent international spread of cholera, particularly among travelers, is the recent licensure and availability of Vaxchora\u00d4, a single-dose, live attenuated, oral cholera vaccine in the United States, the first cholera vaccine to be licensed in the United States in many decades and the only one that is available in the United States. 42 In 2016, GDDOC closely watched and reported on widespread and persistent epidemics of cholera in Haiti, Kenya, Tanzania, DRC, South Sudan, the Central African Republic, Burundi, Benin, Ethiopia (acute watery diarrhea), Djibouti, and Yemen and have responded to requests for assistance or otherwise provided technical assistance to Haiti, Kenya, Tanzania, and DRC.

Signs and symptoms were nonspecific at clinical onset but progressed to include others such as sore throat, fever, maculopapular rash, abdominal pain, and bleeding. 43 Ultimately, there were 318 cases reported in association with this outbreak, with 280 deaths. Laboratory investigations revealed the outbreak was caused by a virus similar to Marburg virus (discovered in 1969), and it was named Ebola virus. Ebola virus is now a member of the genus Ebolavirus (in the Filoviridae family), which contains 5 related virus species: Ebola, Sudan, Reston, Ta\u0131\u00a8Forest, and Bundibugyo ebolaviruses. Since their discovery, these viruses have been the cause of more than 30 separate reported outbreaks. 44 Fatality rates vary between the viruses and among outbreaks, however; for example, Reston ebolavirus infection does not cause disease in humans, only in nonhuman primates. 45, 46 Outbreaks of EVD had been limited to localized outbreaks in sub-Saharan Africa or laboratory exposures until March 2014, when approximately 50 cases (with 10 deaths) of an unspecified viral hemorrhagic fever were reported in the forested southeastern prefectures of Macenta and Gueckedou, Guinea, close to the border with Sierra Leone. Signs and symptoms associated with these cases included high fever, diarrhea, vomiting, and bleeding. Specimens tested at Institut Pasteur's BSL-4 facility in Lyon, France, indicated that these cases were attributable to a filovirus, one of a family of single-stranded negative-sense RNA viruses that can cause severe hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates. 47 On March 22, the outbreak was confirmed as an Ebola virus (Zaire ebolavirus) associated outbreak. Cases had increased to a total of 86 cases with 59 deaths; all cases were epidemiologically linked and included healthcare workers. 48 Later that March, cases began to be reported from other Guinean prefectures, including the capital Conakry, and from Liberia in patients who had traveled to Guinea prior to illness onset; additional cases began to be reported from Sierra Leone and Nigeria.",

As of March 2016, a total of 28,646 suspected, probable, and laboratoryconfirmed cases with 11,323 deaths had been reported from Guinea (3,811 cases; 2,543 deaths), Liberia (10,675; 4,809), Sierra Leone (14,124; 3,956), Nigeria (20; 8), Mali (8; 6), and Senegal (1 case), resulting from importation of cases and minimal sustained transmission. The remainder of cases were a result of importation or travel: Italy (1 case), Spain (1), the United Kingdom (1), and the United States (4 cases; 1 death). 51 We monitored this global outbreak very closely because of the unforeseen explosion of cases and transmission across international borders. This occurred as a result of weakened or fractured healthcare infrastructure, continued infection of healthcare workers, and anthropologic or cultural concerns, such as families hiding their deceased family members-all contributing to propagation of the outbreak. The outbreak was declared over in June 2016; however, we continue to closely monitor any reports, including media reports, from West Africa in hopes of quickly identifying any additional EVD that could be a result of, for example, sexual transmission from EVD survivors. 52, 53 (Recent studies have indicated that Ebola virus can survive in semen for extended periods of time. 54, 55 ) Not limiting ourselves to Ebola virus, we closely monitor any reports of cases that could appear to be a viral hemorrhagic fever, so we may provide early warning for a rapid response to prevent another massive global outbreak.",

As of early November 2016, there have been an additional 1.2 million suspected autochthonous transmission cases reported to PAHO from January 2015 to November 2016. 67 Chikungunya virus causes fever, rash, and most notably severe arthralgia; it is rarely fatal, but the arthralgia can be severely debilitating and, in some people, initiate a lifetime of chronic pain and disability. 68 There is neither a specific treatment for chikungunya nor a vaccine to prevent it; care is typically supportive. 67 The GDDOC continues to conduct event-based surveillance for reports of illness potentially attributable to chikungunya virus and informs leaders of findings. Further, streamlined communications with CDC's Division of Vector-Borne Diseases as well as with PAHO allow for prioritization of resources, including staff and funding.",

Both mosquito species are present in the United States, with Ae. albopictus having a much wider range. 73 However, unlike chikungunya or dengue viruses, Zika virus has been documented to be spread through sexual transmission, complicating the transmission dynamics of this virus. Zika virus infections are often asymptomatic or produce a mild rash illness among healthy adults and children infected after birth. However, in addition to its association with GBS, Zika virus infections in pregnancy now have been associated with congenital infection typically resulting in microcephaly and other nervous system defects. 74 It is the association with the neurologic diseases, both microcephaly and GBS, that prompted WHO to declare the neurologic diseases and their potential association with Zika virus a public health event of international concern, 75 and which has caused Zika virus to be one of the GDDOC's top potential global threats that we are monitoring.",

Although the index exposure occurred in a large, crowded emergency facility, the affected hospital and the health ministry were quickly able to mitigate the outbreak. 77 This event in South Korea demonstrates how quickly MERS-CoV can be transmitted from person to person in a tertiary CHRISTIAN ET AL care hospital in a developed health infrastructure, further underscoring the necessity to monitor cases of MERS-CoV.",
