In this study, a total of 138 blood specimens collected from Bactrian camels from Zhangye City in Gansu Province and Yili and Aksu in Xinjiang Province, China, were examined for the presence of Borrelia spp. Speciesspecificity nested PCR based on the 5S-23S rRNA, OspA, flaB and 16S rRNA genes revealed that the total positive rate of Borrelia spp. was 3.6% (5/138, 95% CI = 0.2-17.9). These results were confirmed by sequence analysis of the positive PCR products or positive colonies. This is the first report of Borrelia pathogens in camels in China. Two Borrelia species that cause Lyme disease and one that causes relapsing fever were identified in the camel blood samples by sequencing. The findings of this study indicate that the Bactrian camel may serve as a potential natural host of Lyme disease and/or relapsing fever in China.",

In humans, Borrelia spp. are the causative agents of a major disease: Lyme borreliosis (LB) (mainly caused by B. garinii, B. afzelii, and B. burgdorferi sensu stricto). LB is also an important disease of domestic animals and wildlife worldwide. LB-group spirochetes, commonly known as B. burgdorferi s.l., cause one of the most significant natural zoonosis diseases that is carried and transmitted by Ixodes spp. ticks (Wodecka et al., 2010) . There are at least 20 genospecies of B. burgdorferi s.l., which are classified based on their genetic differences. More than six of these genospecies have been reported in China (B. burgdorferi s.s., B. garinii, B. afzelii, B. valaisiana, B. sinica and B. yangtze) (Yu et al., 2016) . B. garinii is the main genospecies and is distributed mainly in northern China, while B. burgdorferi s.s. is widely distributed in south China (Chen et al., 2013; Wan et al., 1998) . B. burgdorferi s.l. has been detected in more than 20 mammalian species and seven genera of birds (Li, 2009) . Studies have shown that in addition to humans, at least six other taxa of mammals (sheep, cattle, horses, dogs, cats and mice) and two types of birds (seabirds and migratory birds) can be infected by Borrelia spirochetes in China (Keesing et al., 2009) . Previous research used antibodies to detect the Borrelia spp. antigen within camel sera in Egypt and reported a positive rate of 47.8% (Helmy, 2000) .",

The primer sequences are shown in Table 1 . First-round PCR reactions were performed in a thermocycler (BioRad, Hercules, CA, USA) with a total volume of 25 \u03bcl containing 2.5 \u03bcl of 10\u00d7 PCR buffer (Mg2+ Plus), 2.0 \u03bcl of each dNTP at 2.5 mM, 1.25 U of Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Dalian, China), 1.0 \u03bcl of template DNA, 1.0 \u03bcl of each primer (10 pmol), and 17.25 \u03bcl of distilled water. The PCR conditions were as follows: 4 min of denaturation at 94\u00b0C; 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing for 30 s (annealing temperatures of primers are listed in Table 1 ), and 72\u00b0C for 30-48 s (depending on amplicon size); with a final extension step at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. Nested PCR reactions included 1 \u03bcl of the first-round PCR product as template for another 30 cycles with the same parameters and annealing temperature profile as described above and in Table 1 . To avoid cross-contamination and sample carryover, pre-and post-PCR processing and PCR amplification was performed in separate rooms. B. garinii SZ genomic DNA (from Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute) was used as a positive control, while distilled water was used as a negative control. PCR products were separated by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis, and some positive amplicons from the second round of PCR amplification were directly used for sequencing (GENEWIZ, Inc. Beijing China) or cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Positive colonies were then selected for PCR amplification and sequencing.",

According to the nested PCR results, 138 field-collected blood samples assayed with primers targeting the 16S rRNA, 5S-23S rRNA, flaB, and OspA genes revealed 8 (5.8%), 4 (2.9%), 2 (1.4%) and 2 (1.4%) positive samples, respectively, from three regions of two provinces in China where these camels live. According to our knowledge, this is the first report of Borrelia spp. infection in camels in China, indicating their reservoir role in the maintenance of this organism in the environment. The 16S rRNA gene sequences of Borrelia spp. detected from the Aksu region had the highest infection rate (11.6%), followed by the Ili region (6.1%). The genetic identity of B. burgdorferi Fig. 5 . Phylogenetic tree of the OspA gene sequences of Borrelia species obtained in the present study and those deposited in GenBank from different countries; accession numbers are shown after isolate names. The OspA gene sequences obtained in this study are indicated by bold triangles. The tree was inferred using the neighbour-joining method of MEGA 6.06; bootstrap values are shown at each branch point. Numbers above the branch reflect bootstrap support from 500 replications. All sites of the alignment containing insertions-deletions or missing data were eliminated from the analysis (option \"complete deletion\"). spirochetes can be clarified by their differential reactivity with genospecies-specific PCR primers targeting the 5S-23S rRNA intergenic spacer amplicon gene. Genetic heterogeneity should be further classified by analysing longer sequence data among B. burgdorferi strains that have been previously identified as the same genospecies of atypical strains of Borrelia spirochetes (Mathiesen Jr et al., 1997; Postic et al., 1998) . Moreover, the 16S rRNA gene was detected at a higher positive rate in blood examined for Borrelia spirochetes than other genes in previous research (Wodecka et al., 2010) . Our study showed that the infection rate of these genes decreased in the order 16S rRNA > 5S-23S rRNA > flaB > OspA.",

            "text": "Two Borrelia species, B. garinii and B. burgdorferi s.s., were identified, and B. garinii was found to be widely distributed in camels in China. In the present study, B. garinii and B. burgdorferi s.s. were identified in camels from Aksu and Ili in Xinjiang Province. Sequence and phylogenetic analysis revealed that those isolates were closely related to the corresponding genotypes based on 16S rRNA gene with high sequence similarities (99.4%-100%, GenBank accession numbers: CP007564; 100%, GenBank accession numbers: AY342028), although the bootstrap values of the phylogenetic tree were relatively low. This finding suggested the genetic diversity of B. garinii and B. burgdorferi s.s in different hosts and geographic locations. Interestingly, the sequencing of cloned PCR products from the 16S rRNA gene of Borrelia spp. from the Ili region showed the presence of a new Borrelia species belonging to the relapsing fever group. The 16S rRNA gene sequence of Borrelia sp. obtained from camel has a 99.5%, 99.8% and 99.8% similarity to the gene of B. theileri KAT strain, Borrelia sp. 120618D12 and Borrelia sp. 130707_13_HJF, respectively (GenBank accession numbers: KF569941, AB897890 and AB897891). B. theileri belongs to the RF Borrelia spp. group and is the causative agent of bovine borreliosis. It was initially identified in cattle and subsequently in goats, sheep and deer from Africa, South America, Mexico and Australia (L, 1903; Mathiesen Jr et al., 1997) . Most of the RF Borrelia spp. are transmitted by soft-bodied ticks, but B. theileri is found in hard-bodied ticks and is transmitted by Rhipicephalus spp., including R. annulatus, R. decoloratus, R. microplus and R. evertsi (Barbour et al., 2005; Smith et al., 1985; Trees, 1978) . This study provides the first report of B. theileri in camel blood samples in China.",

A previous study reported that the Borrelia isolates were isolated from D. marginatus collected from camels in Xinjiang, China, and these isolates were genetically identified as B. burgdorferi sensu stricto . The blood samples from Bactrian camels in this study were donated by Dr. Li, who reported that there are ticks available to be collected from these Bactrian camels that have been identified as belonging to H. asiaticum, H. dromedarii, R. sanguineus group, and D. niveus . Thus, these tick species might act as potential vectors to carry and transfer Borrelia spp. that cause camel borreliosis in China. Further study is required to determine whether these ticks are competent vectors for Borrelia spp.",

Further studies concerning the prevalence of Borrelia spp. groups for both Lyme disease and relapsing fever should be performed to confirm the presence of these different Borrelia species in camels within China. Our findings suggest that Borrelia infection in camels could potentially present a concern for public health. More detailed and widespread monitoring of tick populations and the screening for Borrelia in a greater variety of hosts are warranted in future studies.",
