Inflammation and remodeling of the small airways are major determinants for the progression and severity of COPD, as defined by the decline in FEV 1 [5] . The airway inflammation in COPD is generally described as neutrophilic. Several immune cells, proinflammatory chemokines, and cytokines extensively participate in the induction and maintenance of the inflammatory response in the airway [6] . The chemokine CXCL8 (also referred to as interleukin-8), which is secreted from the leukocytic cells (monocytes, T cells, neutrophils, and natural killer cells) and other cells such as epithelial cells and fibroblasts [7] , has a well documented role in the pathogenesis and maintenance of airway inflammation in COPD.",

CXCL8 production is not constitutive, but is inducible by proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a [8] , bacteria and virus and their products [7, 10] , and several environmental factors such as hypoxic conditions [11] . Two distinct G-protein-coupled receptors -CXCR1 and CXCR2 -exist for CXCL8 in humans and rodents [12, 13] . The primary function of CXCL8 is the induction of chemotaxis in its target cells, especially neutrophils and lymphocytes [10] , which involves Gbg subunit-activated phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-g and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP 3 ) signaling [14, 15] . CXCL8 also induces upsurge of cytosolic calcium, which is essential for exocytosis (e.g. mediator release), and respiratory burst [7, 10] . Numerous previous studies have suggested the critical role of CXCL8 in the induction and maintenance of airway inflammation in the rodent model and in clinical patients with COPD.",

One of these, the p38 MAPK pathway, is activated by cellular stress and regulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines, including CXCL8, TNF-a and MMPs [16] . Four isoforms of p38 MAPK family (a, b, g, and d) exist. Usually, p38 MAPKs are activated by phosphorylation on Thr180 and Tyr182 in the Thr-Gly-Tyr motif of the activation loop by upstream MAPK kinases MKK3 and MKK6, which are in turn activated by the MAPK kinase kinases (MEKK). Once activated, p38 MAPKs effectively act on several downstream kinases, such as MAPK-activated protein kinase (MAPKAPK2/3), and eventually influence the function of some transcription factors, cytoskeletal proteins and translational components, and other enzymes [17] .",

Patients were excluded if they had a history of asthma, bronchiectasis, tuberculosis, or other confounding diseases, such as severe congestive heart failure (Stage III-IV New York Heart Association), cancer, diabetes, thyrotoxicosis, and autoimmune diseases. Lung function test was performed in all participants with the inhalation of salbutamol sulfate. COPD was defined according to international guidelines (post-bronchodilator FEV 1 /FVC ratio <70%), and the severity of COPD was classed according to current Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) criteria [4] . These patients are classified into COPD grade I (13 patients), Grade II (13), grade III (12) , and grade IV (10) . The control group included the 12 outpatients for routine health check, with matched age and without any known respiratory diseases. The institutional human research review board approved the present study and all patients signed an informed consent.",

In the lung diseases caused by bacterial or viral infection, exogenous microbes and their production induced CXCL8 protein production in the lung tissue [7] , recruiting neutrophils to infection sites to eradicate invasive microbes [27, 28] . In bronchioalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome, significantly increased CXCL8 was observed and correlated with increased neutrophil numbers in BALF [7, 29] . In the rodent model and in patients with asthma, CXCL8 directly provokes bronchoconstriction [30] and induces neutrophil infiltration and activation in the airway, preceding 1233 late exacerbation of acute asthmatic attack [31, 32] . Similarly, CXCL8 levels, as an indicator of disease activity, significantly increased in both serum and BALF of patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [33] .",
