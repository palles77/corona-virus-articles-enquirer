The second section covers the alimentary parasitic conditions: ostertagiasis, and small and large intestinal parasitism (for coccidiosis, see 2.31, 2.32). The remaining conditions are listed by anatomical site (oral cavity to anus), irrespective of their traumatic, nutritional, or other etiology.",

Such animals may be either clinically normal or stunted, but they continually excrete virus. Unpredictable nervous signs such as aggression may be seen in some BVD persistent infection (P1) calves. At a later date, usually 3-30 months old, superinfection with a noncytopathic strain of BVD virus leads to a syndrome of mucosal disease, with ulceration throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Clinically these animals present signs of oral, intestinal and respiratory involvement. Erosions and hyperemia around the nares, lips, and gums are seen in 4.3.",

The dilated cecum can be percussed in the caudal upper right flank and be palpated per rectum (slightly mobile \"loaf of bread\" shape).

The cecal apex has been prolapsed through a dorsal and caudal right flank laparotomy incision (4.89), but most of the cecum still lies within the abdominal cavity. The peritoneal surface is slightly congested. Many cases of simple cecal dilatation are asymptomatic. Some develop into cecal torsion and show more severe pain and depression. Others may even recover spontaneously from dilatation. Clinical features: it may be localized or generalized, acute or chronic. It is commonly secondary to contamination of the abdominal cavity, e.g., secondary to traumatic reticulitis or cesarian section. In active disease, guarding of the abdomen results in a stiff gait (see p. 69). The bovine peritoneum and greater omentum have a remarkable facility to wall off leaks of bowel contents and localized areas of abscessation. This process often results in few or no complications in the cranial part of the abdomen. Adhesions developing in the caudal part can cause progressive bowel obstruction. In 4.90 the visceral and parietal peritoneum (rumen, jejunum, and greater omentum) is covered with a fibrinous and purulent exudate, typical of early generalized peritonitis.
