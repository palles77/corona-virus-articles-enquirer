            "text": "Influenza breaks out every year and causes severe infection in the respiratory system. 1, 2 The novel H1N1 influenza pandemic that erupted in North America caused more than 575,400 deaths in 2009. 3 Vaccines and antiviral drugs are the main methods to prevent and control influenza. Because of the variation of influenza virus, application of vaccines is severely circumscribed. Current therapeutic strategies for influenza include the M2 ion channel inhibitors, neuraminidase inhibitors, and broad-spectrum antiviral RNA polymerase inhibitors. Amantadine, oseltamivir, and zanamivir, the main M2 ion channel inhibitor and neuraminidase inhibitors that once had a remarkable effect on influenza virus infection, have been reported increasingly for their resistance. [4] [5] [6] Development of new drugs and drug combinations is focused on in medicine. Ribavirin (RBV) is a triazole compound and nucleoside analog. As an RNA polymerase inhibitor, RBV is a well-characterized and broad-spectrum antiviral drug against various RNA and DNA viruses, including influenza A and influenza B viruses. 7 It was approved by Dovepress Dovepress 5788 lin et al the American Food and Drug Administration for treatment against influenza virus or respiratory syncytial virus infection through nebulizer inhalation in 1986 and hepatitis C virus infection combined with interferon in 2001. 8 Nanomaterials have been studied or applied as carriers of drugs in the biomedical field because of their special physical and chemical properties compared with normal materials, such as the small particle size that contributes to the stable nanostructure and enables easy entrance into cells. 9, 10 It has been reported that silver nanoparticles loaded with paclitaxel enhance apoptosis of HepG2 cancer cells compared with paclitaxel alone. 11 Gold nanoparticles are used to deliver chemotherapeutic drugs in research studies because of their remarkable properties, including high surface-areato-volume ratio, surface plasmon resonance, and so forth. 12 Mesoporous silica nanoparticles loaded with doxorubicin exhibit higher intracellular drug release in cancer cells. 13 Compared with these elements, selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) have their own characteristics against virus infection. First, selenium status may affect the function of cells of both innate and adaptive immunity. It has been reported that selenium deficiency is supposed to be related to virus infection, including coxsackie virus and human immunodeficiency virus. 14, 15 Selenium supplementation in healthy human adults with marginal selenium status results in both beneficial and detrimental effects on cellular immunity to flu caused by influenza virus. 16 Sodium selenite suppresses hepatitis B virus transcription and replication in vitro. 17 Furthermore, SeNPs were used to induce robust Th1 cytokine pattern with hepatitis B virus vaccination. 18 Besides, SeNPs showed anti-type-1 dengue virus activity by depressing cytopathic effect. 19 Our previous studies proved that SeNPs loaded with oseltamivir or amantadine can, respectively, inhibit apoptosis induced by influenza virus infection in vitro. 20, 21 It has been reported that viruses induce apoptosis through caspase-3 activation. [22] [23] [24] Caspase-3 is the primary executioner of programmed cell death. It is directly or indirectly responsible for the cleavage of many proteins and caspases involved in apoptosis. 25 It is activated when cleaved into two protein fragments. Cleaved caspase-3 is responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of many critical proteins. Here, RBV was carried by SeNPs, making a new nanoparticle drug system that enters the cells more effectively. Then, the antiviral activity against H1N1 influenza virus of the nano system was detected via cell viability assay and viral titer test in vitro, followed by lungs injury detection. Finally, the relationship between the antiviral activity and caspase-3 apoptotic pathway was explored in both in vitro and in vivo experiments.",

All mice were anesthetized with 10% chloral hydrate at a dose of 3 \u00b5L/g through intraperitoneal injection. Then, the control group was treated with 20 \u00b5L physiological saline by nasal dripping, while the other four groups were treated with 20 \u00b5L H1N1 virus at a 1,000 TCID 50 /mL titer by nasal dripping as well. 35, 36 After 24 hours, RBV, SeNPs and Se@RBV that contained 20 \u00b5g RBV and 50 nmol SeNPs were administered to anesthetized mice, respectively, via intranasal absorption every 24 hours thereafter for a total of three times. Clinical symptoms of the mice were observed, and then the mice were executed by cervical dislocation after anesthesia with chloral hydrate on the 14th day from which treatment was given last.

Activity of caspase-3 was detected, and expression of cleaved caspase-3 or cleaved PARP was investigated. As reflected in Figure 4 , caspase-3 activity of cells infected by H1N1 virus without treatment was 352% of the control group in which cells were uninfected, while the Se@RBV-treated group markedly reduced to 208%, compared with 262% of the RBV-treated group and 304% of the SeNPs group. It suggested that H1N1 virus probably induced apoptosis through caspase-3 and was effectively suppressed by Se@RBV. In addition, expression of caspase-8 protein was decreased and that of cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP increased after H1N1 infection. When treated with Se@RBV, changes of the three turned weak. These results suggested that Se@RBV inhibited apoptosis by regulating caspase-8, caspase-3, and PARP proteins. Caspase-8 is an apoptosis initiator. Activated caspase-8 cleaves apoptosis executioners, such as caspase-3, caspase-6, and caspase-7. 42 Cleaved caspase-3 is responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of many critical proteins, such as the PARP. Cleavage of PARP facilitates cellular disassembly and serves as a marker of apoptosis. 43 It could be inferred that Se@RBV restrained the caspase-3-mediated apoptosis pathway by inhibiting the activation of caspase-8.",

It enhances membrane permeability and helps the activation of caspase pathways, such as caspase-3. 44 As shown in Figure 5A , H1N1 virus infection led to an increased expression of Bax protein. After treatment with Se@RBV, the expression was downregulated. In addition, expression of p-p53 had an identical variation tendency with Bax. P53 is activated after phosphorylation. Activated p53 affects apoptosis by regulating Bcl-2 and Bax gene. As an activator of transcription of Bax, p53 benefits the expression of the protein and promotes the apoptosis process after phosphorylation. 45 The results suggested that Se@RBV might regulate the expression of Bax through attenuating the expression of p53 protein.

Mice infected with H1N1 virus without other treatments tended to reduce physical activity and feeding. Mice treated with Se@RBV post infection present a more active and increased appetite. As the H&E staining reveals in Figure 6B , the H1N1-infected group manifested as alveolar collapse and perivascular and peribronchiolar edema, compared with the control group. When treated with RBV or SeNPs, the symptoms lessened. Crucially, it is quite amazing that Se@RBV attenuated the histopathological manifestations substantially. The result directly indicated that Se@RBV evidently protected the lungs from being injured by H1N1 infection. DNA around nucleosomes was cut when apoptosis occurs. Tunel is used for detecting the DNA fragmentation disrupted during apoptosis. As shown in Figure 6B , Se@RBV prevents DNA damage during H1N1 infection. Altogether, the H&E stain and tunel analyses illustrate that Se@RBV had a good effect on lung injury in mice suffering from H1N1 virus infection. To further investigate the probable mechanism through which Se@RBV cured the mice, immunohistochemical test of the lungs was implemented. As exhibited in Figure 6C , cleaved caspase-3, cleaved PARP, p-p53, p-JNK, and p-p38 proteins were found positive for H1N1 virus infection. Nevertheless, treatment with Se@RBV reduced the appearance visibly. This result was coincident with the previous in vitro study in which caspase-3, p53, JNK, and p38 participated in the restriction against the H1N1 virus infection of Se@RBV.",
