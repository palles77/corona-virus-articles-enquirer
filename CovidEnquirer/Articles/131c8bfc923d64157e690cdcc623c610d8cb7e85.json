Cleaning is required after long-term use; however, very little has been published on the subject. An experimental investigation has been launched to determine backpulse, backblow and combined backpulse-backblow on cleaning of a loaded nanofiber filter. Nylon 6 nanofiber filters were loaded with polydispersed NaCl particles, 60% < 100 nm and 90% < 160 nm, generated from an aerosol generator. Air jets in form of backpulse, backblow and their combined mode were used to clean a loaded filter. During cleaning, the filter cake was removed first for which the pressure drop across the loaded filter decreased rapidly, followed by loosely attached aerosols in the filter being removed with finite pressure drop reduction at a reasonable rate, ending in the final stage for which much lesser aerosols were being removed. Ultimately, the filter reached a residual pressure drop which was higher than that of the initial clean filter indicating residual aerosols were trapped both in the cake heel and filter.",

Subsequently, the aerosols accumulate on the filter surface eventually forming a cake. A similar phenomenon happens in the microfiber filter as well. Numerous experimental studies on pulse-jet cleaning of microfibrous filter have been carried out in the past. Previous studies [1] [2] [3] [4] reported that the cleaning efficiency of microfiber filter is directly affected by the applied pressure of the clean air source that provides the steady jet or jet pulses. In a backpulse cleaning profile, the cleaning effectiveness is dominated by the overpressure, where the overpressure has to be sufficiently high to overcome the adhesion force between the particles of the cake layer and the adjacent filter for detachment of the cake. Humphries and Madden [5] concluded that ineffective cleaning of pulse-bag filter is due to using an applied pressure lower than the critical value, and moderate enhancement can be made in cleaning performance by increasing slightly the applied pressure that has already reached the critical value. Other parameters, such as standoff distance between nozzle and filter, jet duration, nozzle design, nozzle diameter, etc. were also investigated [3, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Granell and Seville [9] conducted experiments to examine the influence of standoff distance between the nozzle and the inlet of a candle filter for backpulse cleaning. They found that too short standoff distance can lead to entrainment, while too long standoff distance can result in ineffective jet pulse. Laux [3] also found that the jet duration is a trivial factor on cleaning performance, as the overpressure which dominates cleaning does not increase with the jet duration. Guidelines for testing of cleanable filter media, such as VDI 3926 [12] exist, yet they are written strictly for cleaning of loaded microfiber filters.",

Upon dipping into the N6 solution, a thin film is conveyed by the rotating electrode out of the solution into the air and is exposed in a rather high-strength electric field. When the film becomes sufficiently thin, the electric force exceeds the surface tension of the thin film resulting in formation of numerous Taylor cones on the thin film surface. The Taylor cones become unstable and eventually form fibers, carrying positive charges, jetting toward the grounded collecting plate. During free flight, the positive charges deposited (from the rotating electrode) along the fiber repel each other stretching the fiber continuously. Concurrently, the formic acid solvent also evaporates under ventilation thinning continuously the fiber. Both phenomena occurring during the course of free flight result in much thinner nanofibers. The nanofibers are eventually deposited on a substrate prepositioned on the ground collecting plate located at a standoff distance opposite to the rotating electrode. The substrate should have antistatic property to facilitate collection and the adhesion of the nanofibers to the substrate, which is important for cleaning by backblow and backpulse.",

Fig. 2 shows the relationship of fiber diameter versus the solution concentration used for electrospinning. Larger fiber diameter can be obtained with more concentrated solution. As an example, to obtain fiber diameters of 200 nm, the solution concentration for electrospinning should be at 18% by wt. It is worthy to note that this result also depends on the specific electrospinning setup and conditions, such as operation temperature and relative humidity. The conditions for electrospinning of nylon nanofibers are most favorable for producing 100-300 nm nanofibers. It is known that there is an active region that a slight change in solution concentration would result in a large change in mean fiber diameter. Fig. 2 further confirms this result. Indeed, as the concentration increases from 18 to 20% by wt., the fiber diameter increases exponentially. Outside this active region, increase solution concentration would only favor the formation of ribbon-shaped large ''fiber diameter\" which is not desirable for filtration application. On the other hand, it is more difficult to further decrease the mean fiber diameter by lowering the solution concentration alone beyond 12% by wt. An increase in applied voltage can also produce thinner diameter nanofibers.",

Not only the SEM images were used to determine the mean fiber diameters, the nanofiber shape (cross-section round or ribbon shaped) and morphology (e.g. without and with beads formation) can also be confirmed. Mean fiber diameter and fiber diameter distribution were estimated by counting at least 100 fiber diameters obtained from the SEM images by an image processing and analysis software, Image J (National Institutes of Health, US). The conditions of electrospun N6 nanofibers also depend on conductivity of the substrate material. Conventional substrate material in aerosol filtration is typically spunbond non-woven Polypropylene (PP) that has low conductivity, which hinders nanofibers production by electrospinning. Pre-treatment on the substrate is one of the several means to increase the conductivity to improve adhesion between the electrospun nanofibers and substrate. The latter is very important as it allows effective backpulse and backblow on cleaning loaded nanofiber filter without nanofibers detaching from the substrate. By enhancing the wettability of the PP substrate by use of hydrophilic substrate, this can improve the adhesion of nanofibers onto the substrate, which is most desirable.",

Over time, as more aerosols deposit the cake layer increases in thickness, it is possible that the cake layer is nonuniformly packed with finer aerosols infiltrating toward the bottom of the cake layer adjacent to the filter and larger aerosols deposited near the cake surface. In any event, there is flow resistance which is manifested as pressure drop across the cake as well as across the filter loaded with aerosols.

Higher values are also acceptable.

Under continuous supply of 0.2 MPa compressed air flowing into the atomizer, the NaCl(aq) was atomized into submicron particles, with sizes between 10 and 1000 nm, mixed with the compressed air forming the aerosol stream. The aerosol flow rate and concentration can be varied by further mixing with dilution air. The mixed polydispersed NaCl aerosol stream was subsequently dried by passing through the air dryer made of Nafion membrane, a copolymer that enhanced moisture removal of gas stream by perevaporation. The latter was driven by water content gradient between the gas streams flowing respectively inside and outside of the membrane. The dehumidified aerosol stream then flowed through the impactor with a 90\u00b0bend so that large particles (>300 nm) got captured by the impactor plate and were removed. The particle cut size depended on the impactor diameter as well as the aerosol flow rate. The remaining particles were directed to an electrical neutralizer where the high concentration air ions, generated by the electrical neutralizer, brought the incoming aerosol to conform to a Boltzmann charge distribution. The size distribution of the aerosols loading the filter is shown in Fig. 5 . As can be seen, large particles greater than 300 nm are removed. The feed aerosols consist by count 60% less than 100 nm and 90% less than 160 nm. As such, it can be considered the filter is approximately loaded with primarily nano-aerosols (6100 nm).

Finally, for cleaning, the setup was modified as shown in Fig. 6c and the flow direction in the test column was reversed.

Fig. 7 shows several possible designs of trinozzle setup, and design (c) was finally adopted for the test setup based on simplicity in design and the superior control in delivering three jets each with nearly the same rate.

Three characteristic stages of regeneration can be identified. First, there was a very rapid cleaning process that removed most of the deposited cake that contributed to the pressure drop in a loaded filter, thus the pressure drop decreased precipitously once the cake composed of aerosols were removed. The second stage represented a transition between the first rapid cleaning stage and the final ineffective cleaning stage. In the second stage, the remaining aerosols were more difficult to be removed and this involved aerosols migration dislodging from one location and reattaching possibly to the filter further downstream of the flow. This seemed to be a time-dependent slow process, and the pressure drop decreased slowly over time. In the third and final stage, the pressure drop remained nearly constant despite continuous backpulse or backblow. This indicated that little-to-nil additional trapped aerosols were removed and the ''residual pressure drop\", Dp r , reflected the residual aerosols remaining in the filter. Fig. 9 shows an example on the cleaning behavior. (Note that the tank pressure for the air jet was set to 6.5 bars for all the experiments with the exception for the experiments where the pressure Fig. 8 . The working logics of (a) backpulse, (b) backblow and (c) combined backpulse-followed-by-backblow. of the tank was deliberately varied to explore the effect of the tank pressure on cleaning a loaded filter.) The filter was loaded with aerosols under steady-state condition to the maximum pressure drop of 840 Pa. Once the pressure drop reached this maximum level, loading was halted and filter cleaning was ensued subsequently. The results of backpulse cleaning on a test filter sample is shown in Fig. 9 , where the normalized pressure drop, DP 0 , is the pressure drop of a loaded filter, DP, with reference to the clean filter pressure drop, DP f , i.e. DP 0 \u00bc DP \u00c0 DP f .",

For backpulse, each single pulse with duration of 0.7 s consisted of 0.5 s jet pulse and 0.2 s of idle. For backblow, a time interval based on 10 s was set to ensure that the duration for valve in opening position was sufficiently long to develop steady-state flow for which a steady air jet could be realized in the test. For both experiments, after 138 s (2.3 min) of cleaning the residual ratio was determined to be 0.16 for backblow alone and 0.15 for backpulse alone. While the end points reached by the two methods were not too far different, the time to attain an intermediate pressure drop was much faster for backpulse than with backblow. For example, to achieve the pressure drop of 150 Pa, the time needed for backpulse was 6 s which was about 1/6 that required for backblow cleaning, namely 36 s. This reveals that backpulse is a more efficient cleaning process. Therefore, in terms of effectiveness or efficiency, backpulse is a better choice than backblow in filter regeneration. This is due to the inertia force or shock that backpulse exerted on the loaded filter loosening the cake and removing the cake by the flow. It took about 4 s (end of first stage) for the cake to be removed by backpulse, see also inset figure in Fig. 10 , and the pressure drop was at 165 Pa. Once the cake was removed, the trapped aerosols in the filter could be removed by further backpulsing by first detaching the aerosols from anchoring to the nanofibers and subsequently carrying these loosened aerosols in the flow away from the filter.",

Additional backblow was required to remove the cake heel before cleaning off the aerosols trapped by nanofibers in the filter.

This is especially in removing the cake from the nanofiber filter. However, the synergy of the combined mode may be advantageous as the two mechanisms each works best under certain circumstances. Instead of using backpulse to carry the loosen aerosols away from the nanofiber filter, it may be advantageous in providing a steady flow to carry the detached aerosols from residing in the nanofiber filter for which they can be easily recaptured. To that end, further experiments were carried out to investigate the cleaning behavior of loaded filter first by backpulse to be followed by backblow, and the result is compared with that of cleaning by backpulse alone in Fig. 11 . In the experiment, there were 10 pulses in a series of backpulses (i.e. n = 10), for which each single pulse consisted of 0.5 s jet pulse followed by 0.2 s of idle. After the 10 backpulses, it was followed by 10 s of backblow. This ''cleaning cycle\" was repeated. The backpulse setting for the ''backpulse only\" was the same as with the backpulse in the combined mode.",

In fact, the pressure drop in the second stage is faster for the combined mode than just the backpulse mode alone. It can also be seen in Fig. 11 that the slope of a secant line drawn between the two points on the backpulse curve at 100th pulse and 200th pulse (at transition from second to third stage) is less for the backpulse as compared to that for the combined mode. This is because with additional backblow followed by backpulse, the detached aerosols got carried further downstream, if not out, of the filter with reduced chance of being recaptured by the nanofiber filter. This mechanism of efficient removal of detached aerosols in the nanofiber filter extended from the second to the third stage with the combined mode having a steeper decrease in pressure drop as compared with the backpulse alone. Indeed, the ultimate residual ratio at the end of the third stage dropped down to 0.13 for the combined regeneration, which is lower than 0.15 for backpulse cleaning alone. It can be seen in this comparison that backpulse alone is most effective for cake removal at the early stage, in the second and third stages additional backblow can effectively remove the aerosols reducing the chance for recapture of detached aerosols.",

As with the previous case, cleaning with combined backpulse-and-backblow resulted in lower residual ratio, as depicted in Fig. 12 , due to effective blowing-away of the detached aerosols. More importantly, increasing from 0.1 to 0.5 s jet duration resulted in lower residual ratio. Both sets indicate that longer jet duration is beneficial to lowering the residual pressure drop, thus lowering residual aerosols in the filter. Longer jet duration produces a larger air volume with high momentum that resulted in more intense vibration and shock on the filter which can loosen the trapped aerosols in the filter. Hence, the jet duration indeed makes a difference to cleaning unlike conventional baghouse filter. Fig. 11 .

The only variation was the compressed air tank pressure which considered as low, moderate and high applied pressure, i.e. 3 bar, 4 bar and 6.5 bar respectively. The results are plotted in Fig. 13 . The residual ratio of for the filter cleaned with low applied pressure, 3 bar, doubles that of high applied pressure; while the case with moderate applied pressure is in between the two. This shows that the cleaning efficiency increases with the magnitude of applied pressure, similar to the case of conventional microfibrous filter cleaning. However, it is worth noting that there is an upper limit of applied pressure due to the fragility of nanofibers which depends on the fiber diameter, fiber mat thickness, adhesion between nanofibers and its supportive substrate, and the cleaning setup configurations (i.e. standoff distance of jet, single versus multiple jets, jet velocity, area coverage and uniformity of jet impingement). The three jets from the tri-nozzle setup have been able to reduce jet impingement from a single vigorous jet focusing on a concentrated area on the filter, which otherwise can induce local damage on the nanofiber filter.",

However, it is best to use the inertial force of backpulse to loosen the cake from the filter, as well as the aerosols inside the filter from the nanofiber attachment; and use the convection from the backblow to remove loosen aerosols from the filter preventing recapture.

The impingement of the jet on the backside of the loaded filter needs to be distributed uniformly around the filter to avoid single shot-gun effect that can break the nanofiber mat. A tri-nozzle spray has been found to be more favorable to deliver a uniform area of cleaning than a single jet.
