The knowledge of its precise distribution is crucial to investigate its physiological role. This requires the use of appropriate probes such as the recently developed highly potent and selective radiolabeled APN inhibitor 2(S)-benzyl-3-[hydroxy(1P P(R)-aminoethyl)phosphinyl]propanoyl-L-3-[ 125 I]iodotyrosine ([ 125 I]RB 129). Its binding properties were investigated using rat brain homogenates (K d = 3.4 nM) or APN expressed in COS-7 cells (K d = 0.9 nM). The specific binding was 95% at [K d ], and preliminary autoradiography in intestine is promising. The decreased affinity of [ 125 I]RB 129 ( = 10 36 M) for the E 350 D APN mutant, supports the critical role of E 350 in the aminoexopeptidase action of APN.",

            "text": "Aminopeptidase N (APN; EC 3.4.11.2) is a membranebound zinc metallopeptidase involved in the extracellular metabolism of biologically active peptides. APN is expressed in many tissues, with highest levels in intestinal and kidney brush border membranes [1] , but also found in lower quantity in brain, lung, blood vessels, and primary culture of \u00a2broblasts [2] . Furthermore, APN has been shown to be identical to human lymphocyte surface cluster di\u00a1erentiation antigen CD13 [3] , and has been reported to act as a major receptor for transmissible gastroenteritis virus [4] and for human coronavirus 229E [5] . APN exhibits a broad speci\u00a2city for peptides with an N-terminal neutral or basic amino acid, and has been shown to be involved in enkephalins and nociceptin catabolism in the central nervous system [6, 7] and to participate in the enzymatic cascade of the renin-angiotensin system in brain and peripheral organs by cleaving angiotensin III [8] . All these \u00a2ndings make this enzyme an interesting target for possible therapeutic applications [9] . The knowledge of the precise distribution of APN is therefore crucial to investigate its physiological role. Few studies on the localization of APN have been done exclusively by using antibodies. In brain APN has been reported to be essentially located on blood vessels [101 2], a distribution which is hardly reconcilable with its peptide metabolizing role. Radioactive inhibitors have the advantage over antibodies to label the active site quantitatively in all tissues and species, and to reveal even low levels of a biological target [13] . However, it is essential to verify that the labeled inhibitor has a good a\u00a4nity and is speci\u00a2c for the enzyme, as zinc metallopeptidases have many active site features in common [14] . Another advantage of radioactive inhibitors is that their in vivo distribution can easily be followed after di\u00a1erent routes of administration [15] , an important factor, considering the potential clinical applications of such molecules.",

The \u00a2lters were rinsed twice with 5 ml of ice-cold bu\u00a1er and the radioactivity was measured. For kinetic studies [ 125 I]RB 129 was used at 100 pM and dissociation was initiated by addition of 1 WM cold iodinated ligand RB 129 after a 120 min incubation. For saturation studies, incubations were for 80 min and the radioactive ligand was used from 0.075 nM to 8 nM. For competition experiments a \u00a2xed concentration of 10 pM [ 125 I]RB 129 was used in presence of various concentrations of di\u00a1erent APN inhibitors. Non-speci\u00a2c binding was determined with 1 WM RB 129. Moreover, all experiments were performed in presence of thiorphan to avoid non-speci\u00a2c binding to NEP, for which the ligand has a K i value of 23.6 nM when tested in an enzymatic assay [17] . Competition curves were analyzed, and kinetic and saturation binding parameters were determined with the computer program EBDA. K i values were determined with the Cheng-Prussof equation:",

In this study we have characterized the binding of its radioiodinated form, [ 125 I]RB 129, using either rat brain membranes or recombinant APN expressed in COS-7 cells. The binding was tissue concentration dependent, reversible and saturable. Saturation analysis indicated that [ 125 I]RB 129 binds with high a\u00a4nity to a homogeneous population of non-interacting sites in rat brain membranes and COS-7 cells transfected with APN wild-type. Thus, Scatchard plots were linear, and Hill plots had slopes which were not signi\u00a2cantly di\u00a1erent from unity. From rat brain homogenates [ 125 I]RB 129 bound to a single class of binding sites with a K d value of 3.4 nM and a B max of 722 fmol/mg of protein. Speci\u00a2c binding was high, being almost 95% at the K d value. In binding studies using recombinant APN expressed in COS-7 cells [ 125 I]RB 129 had a K d of 0.9 nM and again a high speci\u00a2c binding (V92% at the K d value). Recently, E 350 has been characterized as a critical residue involved in the N-terminal amine binding site of APN [19] . The mutation E 350 A led to a non-measurable speci\u00a2c binding. This result was expected, as E 350 is essential to stabilize aminophosphinic inhibitors in the S 1 subsite, and the binding data are in good agreement with the enzymatic assay demonstrating that this mutated APN shows an activity at least 10 000-fold lower than that of the wild-type APN [19] . This reinforces the argument that E 350 , found highly conserved in zinc metallopeptidase by sequence comparison, interacts with the amino group of substrates and inhibitors and participates to the exopeptidase speci\u00a2city of aminopeptidases.",

These more than 10-and 15-fold lower a\u00a4nities of both inhibitors observed in binding studies are very likely due to the lower selectivity of RB 38A and Phe-thiol inhibitors for APN as compared to the aminophosphinic inhibitors in regard to the various other aminopeptidases present in rat brain membranes. This is strongly supported by the results obtained with the recombinant APN expressed in COS-7 cells, which could be considered as a partially puri\u00a2ed enzyme preparation.

The use of such an inhibitor for autoradiography has advantages over enzymatic assay which is very imprecise or immunological methods for which quantitation could be hampered by di\u00a1erences in the tertiary structure and epitope presentation of the enzyme in various tissues, as shown in the case of angiotensin converting enzyme [29, 30] . Furthermore, although the primary sequences of APN from di\u00a1erent species are highly conserved [4,31^34] , it cannot be excluded that the enzyme appears to be di\u00a1erentially glycosylated not only in di\u00a1erent species but also in di\u00a1erent tissues of the same species, as already observed for neprilysin, another zinc metallopeptidase (NEP) [35] , which might a\u00a1ect its recognition. Moreover, the use of 125 I needs only short exposure times to obtain autoradiograms, and due to its high speci\u00a2c activity o\u00a1ers the possibility of a precise visualization of the enzyme in various tissues. As a preliminary experiment, we have visualized APN in the rat intestine with [ 125 I]RB 129 and found a distribution at the level of the brush border in good agreement with previous studies reporting immunolabeling of APN in intestinal membranes, where its physiological function appears to be the hydrolysis of dietary peptides [36, 37] .",

Furthermore, this radiolabeled compound could be modi\u00a2ed to generate new dual inhibitors of NEP and APN, which both are involved in enkephalin degradation, o\u00a1ering the possibility to follow its bioavailability after di\u00a1erent routes of administration, an important factor considering the potential clinical application of such molecules (review in [9] ). In vivo displacement could also be performed to study the physiological modulation of enkephalin pathways by others neuromodulators.",
