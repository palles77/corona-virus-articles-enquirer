Taken together, these data do not define a natural host for H-1 or RV beyond question, although the difference in antibody frequencies for both viruses between rat and man is suggestive that human immunity and the possible isolation of virus from human tissue may represent zoonoses.

            "text": "In some studies of experimental parvovirus pathogenesis, especially in the I960 1 s when the viruses were being assessed for their ability to cause tumors, several investigators reported instances of tissue hyperplasia, such as odontomas and cementomas, resulting from parvovirus infection (30,61,62,63,81) . When further characterized, these were found invariably to be benign. This appears a somewhat enigmatic observation, since no evidence has been found in cell culture studies for any type of cellular transformation elicited by these viruses. In addition most animal studies have revealed that these viruses exhibit an oncosuppressive rather than tumor-indicative behaviour. One possible explanation for these hyperplasias is that they might be caused by viral ablation of a distinct cell type which normally exerts a controlling influence on the extent of growth in the hyperplastic tissue, either by direct contact or by the production of humoral factors\u00b7 Studies on viral target-cell biology in such situations may shed light on some growth-control processes in normal development\u00b7",

This was most dramatically demonstrated by the study of MVM by Parker and colleagues (52) who found that 44% of spontaneous tumors from various sources regularly transplanted in mice were contaminated with the virus.A further study (57) which screened transplantable tumors for eleven different agents showed that MVM, with an incidence of 32%, was second only to lactic dehydrogenase virus in frequency of isolation. This incidence is very high and leads one to wonder how many experiments in cancer chemotherapy and immunology have been influenced by the unsuspected presence of MVM. The isolation of both MVM(i) and the TRV strain of RV as immunosuppressive agents present in transplantable tumors (16,23) underlines the profound effects such contamination might have on the interpretation of both IjL vivo and jln vitro experiments with infected tumors or material derived from them.",

This allotropie variant of MVM, known as MVM(i), is capable of lytic growth in cytotoxic T cell clones, will abrogate cytotoxic T cell responses, reduce T cell mitogenic responses and interfere dramaticaly with helper dependent B cell responses in vitro (92,93,94). Moreover, under appropriate conditions MVM(i) is highly cytopathic jyi vitro for the original tumor cell line EL-4 (G-) from which it was isolated (32), suggesting that during passage in vivo, the developing transplanted tumor was probably protected by the imune response of the mouse either to the contaminating MVM or to MVM experienced previously in an enzootically infectedTABLE V.
