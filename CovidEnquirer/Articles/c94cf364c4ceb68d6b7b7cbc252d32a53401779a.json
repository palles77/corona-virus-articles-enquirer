In this article, we share our practical experiences in outbreak management and in safeguarding the population against novel diseases. Given that cities represent the financial nexuses of the global economy, global health security necessitates the safeguard of cities against epidemic diseases. Singapore's public health landscape has undergone a systemic and irreversible shift with global connectivity, rapid urbanization, ecological change, increased affluence, as well as shifting demographic patterns over the past two decades. Concomitantly, the threat of epidemics, ranging from severe acute respiratory syndrome and influenza A (H1N1) to the resurgence of vector-borne diseases as well as the rise of modern lifestyle-related outbreaks, have worsened difficulties in safeguarding public health amidst much elusiveness and unpredictability. One critical factor that has helped the country overcome these innate and man-made public health vulnerabilities is the development of a resilient field epidemiology service, which includes our enhancement of surveillance and response capacities for outbreak management, and investment in public health leadership. We offer herein the Singapore story as a case study in meeting the challenges of disease control in our modern built environment.",

But until the first International Sanitary Conference in 1851 and its serial meetings, there were few mechanisms that facilitated international cooperation among countries [1] . The long time span between the inaugural conference and the subsequent institutionalisation of a common framework suggest the difficulties and sensitivities involved in facilitating international cooperation on epidemic disease control [2] . Yet, that countries remain concerned with, and are willing to cooperate on the cross-border transmission of disease, indicates a rationale far surpassing historical continuity or obliga-tory duty. A seemingly archaic and oft-overlooked reason is that disease epidemics have vast implications on national survival, and that the health of the domestic population provides countries with the assurance and freedom to pursue its vision and goals.",

Legal provisions were strengthened to endow the Director of Medical Services with the legal authority to order the quarantine of persons, and confer an offence for persons who disobeyed [6] . When the disease threatened to establish itself within hospitals, mandatory protection gear and infection control procedures were set in place, along with close monitoring of healthcare workers for SARS symptoms as well as movement restrictions on all staff, patients, and visitors in hospitals [6] . In mounting large-scale quarantine operations alone, it cost the government approximately US$5.2 million [6] . 238 cases with 33 deaths were reported [7] , yielding a 14% case fatality rate. Compared to the economic recession in 1997-1998 and 2001, the SARS crisis had the deepest, albeit shortlived impact on visitor arrivals with many airlines drastically reducing flight numbers to Singapore [8, 9] .

In order to facilitate a strong command and control centre where knowledge is effectively cascaded to stakeholders and efforts Singapore Field Epidemiology Service coordinated across various government bodies and agencies, Singapore adopts a \"whole-of-government\" approach through its Homefront Crisis Management System. Our modus operandi gathers relevant ministries and inter-agency groups that either lead or support a sector (e.g., health, foreign affairs, trade and industry) to mitigate the consequences of an outbreak. Since Singapore is highly dependent on international trade and food supplies from overseas, total border closure is not feasible. The aim, therefore, is for the country to maintain continuity of essential services and supplies. In the meanwhile, morbidity and mortality can be reduced through early isolation and treatment of cases, quarantine of close contacts, mass vaccination once a pandemic vaccine becomes available, and the stepping up of infection control in different settings [18, 19] . Clear communication at the national level is also needed at all stages during an outbreak. This helps ensure public confidence and strengthen social morale, which are likely to run deficit. As illustrated during SARS [20] , the timely provision of information, advocacy for social responsibility, and promotion of good hygiene practices helped build trust between the people and the government.",

            "text": "As for elaborations on our flora and fauna, we shall state what is most obvious to infectious disease: the presence of vectors. Singapore's tropical climate gave over to the prevalence of mosquito vectors such as the Aedes spp. and Anopheles spp., whose populations were ruthlessly abated through a range of stringent control measures and the removal of marshlands and forested areas, though not entire, as the country rapidly urbanized [24] . It was with some degree of concern then that epidemic chikungunya, a mosquito-borne viral disease, surfaced in 2008 [25, 26] . Genetic analysis showed that the first three local episodes were most likely the result of independent importations of the virus from neighbouring Asian countries while locally acquired cases that occurred around July in the same year were largely due to a single strain which was closely related to the strain detected in cases imported from Malaysia [26] . In a similar measure, although Singapore was certified malaria-free by the World Health Organization in 1982 and the Anopheles spp. vector population was reduced to low levels, the country remains vulnerable to outbreaks involving foreign workers with relapsing malaria who, due to socio-behavioural and economic reasons, did not seek early medical treatment [27, 28] . The first locally acquired human Plasmodium knowlesi infection, an emerging malaria parasite, was also reported in 2007, with four additionally detected human cases within the same year, and one in 2008. All cases involved military personnel who had undergone training in restricted-access forested areas in Singapore [29] . The quintessential vector-borne disease, dengue, continues to be endemic in Singapore with cyclical outbreaks observed. In 2005, a switch in denguevirus (DEN) serotype predominance from DEN-2 to DEN-1 unleashed an unprecedented epidemic in both size and geographical distribution of cases [30] . Low herd immunity against the DEN-1 serotype due to the introduction of immunologically naive non-residents from non-dengue endemic countries, as well as the cunning of the Aedes aegypti in exploiting difficult-to-reach habitats were factors that contributed to the outbreak.",

A new variable that may amplify disease transmission is climate change as evident by extreme weather events, particularly the unprecedented flash flooding witnessed in parts of the country from 2010 to 2011. Our national environment agency has acknowledged the difficulties in rainfall prediction, which may augur unfavourably for mid-to long-term infrastructural planning. Extreme weather events are indicatory of an upset ecological system that remains poorly understood and addressed even as the country grapples with the new realities of climate change. Moving for-ward, our disease control programmes require periodic review as the epidemiological triad of host, environment, and agent rebalances dynamically.",

This illustrated a lack of patient knowledge of the potential harm of novel products if not used properly. More recently, during the Escherichia coli food poisoning outbreak in Germany and the Fukushima nuclear incident in Japan, the agri-food and veterinary authority had to increase its surveillance of food imports to ensure consumption safety. Our high dependency on food imports, a lack of good local substitutes, and the proclivity for international food items made available through a global food production and supply-chain network place Singapore at increased risk of food-borne incidents [39, 40] . This is compounded by the flagrant use of antibiotics and pesticides, mass production of processed food items, high ambient temperatures, and an extensive farm-to-fork process, providing many opportunities for contamination of food items [41] . With such risk factors, the national pastime of exotic dining outside the home needs only small mentioning.",
