Healthcare workers and visitors can serve as transmission vectors to patients. We hypothesized that improved family and visitor hand hygiene (FVHH) and visitor screening would reduce HARVIs by at least 25%. Methods: This quality improvement project took place in a large tertiary NICU to reduce HARVIs. Interventions primarily focused on improving FVHH and reducing visitation by symptomatic family members and visitors. We defined correct FVHH as hand hygiene performed immediately before touching their child. Hand hygiene observations were performed by direct observation by NICU staff using a standardized tool. Interventions to improve FVHH included education of staff and visitors, reminder signs, and immediate reminders to families to prevent lapses in hand hygiene. Staff screened family and visitors before NICU entry. Symptomatic individuals were asked to defer visitation until symptoms resolved. HARVIs were identified during prospective surveillance by infection preventionists using standard definitions. Results: Baseline FVHH was 27% in 2015. After May 2017, the average FVHH remained at 85%. When reminded, family members and visitors performed hand hygiene 99% of the time. Staff screened ~129,000 people for FVHH. Between January 2013 and March 2019, there were 74 HARVIs; 80% were rhinovirus/enterovirus. After the implementation of improved FVHH, the HARVI rate decreased from 0.67 to 0.23/1,000 patient days. Conclusions: Adding interventions to improve FVHH and visitor management to existing healthcare worker prevention efforts can help reduce",

In 1 study, about 30% of children with healthcare-associated viral infections were exposed to an ill caregiver or visitor. 1 In efforts to limit transmission of viral infections, most pediatric hospitals enact some form of visitor restrictions or visitor screening in an attempt to limit the presence of symptomatic persons in the hospital. 14 The scope and implementation of these types of interventions are variable.",

Age-based restrictions limit exposure to children who may have inadequate respiratory hygiene but do not address the role contagious adult visitors play in HARVIs. Limiting the number of visitors to a small cohort of key individuals determined by the family (including children) may be more effective than age restrictions. Washam et al 26 recently described a 37% reduction in HARVIs after standardization of visitor restriction policies that included restricting the number of visitors during a hospitalization. It is also important to identify potentially contagious individuals and prevent them from visiting until symptoms improve. A recent study by Mermel et al 27 reported relatively fewer HARVIs in units that performed visitor screening compared with units that did not screen. Unfortunately, these investigators did not measure compliance with visitor screening. We implemented a similar process to screen family members and visitors before entry into the NICU. Although Unit Secretaries asked symptomatic family members and visitors to defer visitation, these episodes were not documented, which limited our ability to assess the full effectiveness of the screening process. In addition to screening, during the 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 influenza seasons, visitation was restricted to 2 parents/caregivers. This intervention likely provided additional protection for patients. Hospitals must balance the decreased family-centeredness of more restrictive policies with the challenges of implementing visitor screening when developing a visitor management plan. Finally, since respiratory viruses circulate throughout the year, processes must also provide year-round protection.",
