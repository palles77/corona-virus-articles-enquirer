            "text": "Introduction Severe trauma represents the leading cause of mortality worldwide. While 80% of deaths occur within the first 24 hours after trauma, 20% occur later and are mainly due to healthcare-associated infections, including ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). Preventing underinflation of the tracheal cuff is recommended to reduce microaspiration, which plays a major role in the pathogenesis of VAP. Automatic devices facilitate the regulation of tracheal cuff pressure, and their implementation has the potential to reduce VAP. The objective of this work is to determine whether continuous regulation of tracheal cuff pressure using a pneumatic device reduces the incidence of VAP compared with intermittent control in severe trauma patients. Methods and analysis This multicentre randomised controlled and open-label trial will include patients suffering from severe trauma who are admitted within the first 24 hours, who require invasive mechanical ventilation to longer than 48 hours. Their tracheal cuff pressure will be monitored either once every 8 hours (control group) or continuously using a pneumatic device (intervention group). The primary end point is the proportion of patients that develop VAP in the intensive care unit (ICU) at day 28. The secondary end points include the proportion of patients that develop VAP in the ICU, early (\u22647 days) or late (>7 days) VAP, time until the first VAP diagnosis, the number of ventilator-free days and antibiotic-free days, the length of stay in the ICU, the proportion of patients with ventilator-associated events and that die during their ICU stay. Ethics and dissemination This protocol has been approved by the ethics committee of Poitiers University Hospital, and will be carried out according to the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical Practice guidelines. The results of this study will be disseminated through presentation at scientific conferences and publication in peer-reviewed journals. trial registration Clinical Trials NCT02534974 IntroduCtIon Background and rationale Severe trauma represents the leading cause of mortality worldwide, and is the third highest cause of death in France behind cardiovascular disease and cancer. About 46 deaths following trauma occur per 1 00 000 inhabitants per year in France, representing strengths and limitations of this study \u25ba This study will be conducted as a multicentre randomised controlled and open-label trial adequately powered to determine whether continuous regulation of tracheal cuff pressure using a pneumatic device reduces the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia. \u25ba This will be the first large study on that topic with the potential of changing international recommendations on ventilation-associated pneumonia prevention. \u25ba Study's benefits include reduced duration of mechanical ventilation and stay in the intensive care unit, improved patient prognosis and reduction in antibiotics use. \u25ba Limitations due to the lack of masking related to the nature of the intervention are limited by a masked end point assessment.",

[3] [4] [5] [6] More than 50% of patients that present with severe trauma will develop at least one HAI during their stay. Neurological disorders, recourse to mechanical ventilation and early post-traumatic immune suppression may explain the elevated incidence of HAI, particularly ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP), which mainly occur in the first week following trauma. [7] [8] [9] VAP represents the predominant HAI in severe trauma patients with a mean incidence of 35%, which may even exceed 60% in some series, followed by catheter infections and bacteraemia. 3-6 HAI account for heightened morbidity and mortality, longer stays in the intensive care unit (ICU) and increased treatment costs. In France, the additional cost is estimated at \u20ac800 million per year. 1 These infections also require high use of antibiotics, and VAP alone makes up more than half of the antibiotic treatments prescribed in the ICU. 7 Given the selection pressure they induce, these antibiotic therapies favour the appearance of bacterial resistance.",

Tracheal contamination originates through bacterial aspiration, resulting from the passage of secretions from around the cuff of the tracheal tube accumulating above the tracheal cuff. 10 More rarely, VAP can arise from contaminated stagnant water in the ventilator circuit, use of colonised aerosols or a contaminated contiguous site (almost exclusively the pleural cavity). 11 Prevention measures for VAP Enhanced knowledge of the pathophysiology of VAP has led to the development of effective preventive strategies. The VAP prevention measures recommended by the 2008 French consensus conference on nosocomial infection prevention 12 state that the orotracheal route should be used for tracheal intubation instead of the nasal route, 7 11 13 and the tracheal cuff pressure should be maintained between 25 and 30 cm H 2 O. 14 15 They also recommend using a sedation-analgesia algorithm that facilitates early weaning off ventilation, avoidance of unplanned extubation, 16 prioritising the use of non-invasive ventilation by following the recognised indications, 16 17 placing the patient in a semi-recumbent position between 30\u00b0 and 45\u00b0, 18 19 regularly decontaminating the nasal and oropharyngeal cavity through suitable mouth care 20 21 and starting enteral nutrition as early as possible. 22 When combined with systemic antibiotic therapy, selective digestive decontamination may be recommended, but its implementation requires specification of its modalities (choice, dosing, duration of selective digestive decontamination and antibiotic therapy) and the targeted population.",

            "text": "Maintaining a sufficient level of pressure in the tracheal tube cuff is of critical importance. When the pressure is too low, the patient risks inhaling the accumulated subglottic secretions from the oropharynx, which is known to play a major role in VAP incidence. 14 15 Alternatively, if the pressure is too high there is a risk of ischaemia of the tracheal mucosa and, at removal, of tracheal oedema and later tracheal stenosis. Therefore, regular monitoring of tracheal cuff pressure is recommended, but the optimal monitoring frequency has yet to be clearly determined. Underinflation and/or overinflation of the tracheal cuff often occurs in ventilated patients under intermittent manual control of tracheal cuff pressure using a manometer, which is a well-known source of morbidity and mortality. 23 Recently published data favour use of automatic devices that are able to continuously regulate the tracheal cuff pressure. [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] Even though several learned societies do not recommend their implementation for the purpose of VAP prevention in ventilated patients, recent findings in the literature tend to favour their use. 24 25 27 29 32 However, these studies have several limitations, as all were monocentre studies that included a relatively small number of participants, which rarely included severe trauma patients even though they are at greatest risk for VAP, and these studies did not systematically apply other recommended VAP preventive measures, with a contestable choice for the main study end point.",

At an individual level, the benefits are expected to include a shorter duration of mechanical ventilation and stay in the ICU, as well as improved patient outcomes.
