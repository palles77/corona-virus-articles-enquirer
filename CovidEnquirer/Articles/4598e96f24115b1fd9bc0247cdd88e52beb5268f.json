            "text": "CD13/Aminopeptidase N (CD13) is known to play an important role in tumour cell invasion. We examined whether basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is involved in the regulation of CD13 expression in human melanoma cells. 1F6 human melanoma cells were stably transfected with constructs encoding either the 18 kDa (18kD) or all (ALL) bFGF isoform proteins. We observed highly increased CD13 mRNA and protein expression in the 1F6 clones regardless of the overexpression of either the 18kD or all isoform proteins. Neutral aminopeptidase activity was increased five-fold and could be inhibited by bestatin and the CD13-neutralising antibody WM15. The enhanced invasion through Matrigel, but not migration in a wound assay, was efficiently abrogated by both bestatin and WM15. Upregulation of CD13 expression was the result of increased epithelial and myeloid promoter activity up to 4.5fold in 1F6-18kD and 1F6-ALL clones. Interestingly, in a panel of human melanoma cell lines, a significant correlation (r 2 \u00bc 0.883, Po0.05) between bFGF and CD13 mRNA and protein expression was detected. High bFGF and CD13 expression were clearly related with an aggressive phenotype. Taken together, our data indicate that high bFGF expression upregulates CD13 expression in human melanoma cells by activating both the myeloid and the epithelial CD13 promoter. In addition, we show that high bFGF and CD13 expression results in enhanced invasive capacity and metastatic behaviour of human melanoma cells.",

            "text": "Cutaneous melanoma is a type of skin cancer with high metastatic potential. Melanoma cells can express a wide variety of (angiogenic) growth factors, such as basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), plateletderived growth factor (PDGF) and interleukin-8 (IL-8). During tumour development, melanoma cells depend on the autocrine production of these growth factors for proliferation and survival (Rodeck, 1993; Halaban, 1996) Most specifically, bFGF appears to be a key signal in melanoma progression. Basic fibroblast growth factor is involved in proliferation, migration and invasion of tumour cells (Bikfalvi et al, 1997) We here report that bFGF overexpression in human melanoma cells is responsible for upregulation of CD13 resulting in a highly increased invasive capacity.",

Although CD13 was first described to be a marker for haematopoietic cells of myeloid origin, expression has been reported on non-haematopoietic cells and tissues, such as fibroblasts, brain cells, epithelial cells of the liver, kidney and intestine. The C-terminal part of the protein is located extracellularly and contains the active site (Riemann et al, 1999) . CD13 preferentially cleaves neutral amino acids from small peptides rather than from large proteins. Because of its broad substrate specificity, the functional role of CD13 strongly depends on the location of expression. Previous studies have indicated that in the intestine, CD13 is involved in the terminal degradation of small peptides and amino-acid scavenging (Turner, 1986) . In synaptic membranes in the brain, CD13 has been shown to inactivate endorphins and enkephalins (Matsas et al, 1985) . In addition, CD13 participates in the processing of peptides presented by the major histocompatibility complex class II molecule (Hansen et al, 1993; Larsen et al, 1996) . Furthermore, CD13 acts as the receptor for the transmissible gastroenteritis virus and the human coronavirus (Delmas et al, 1992) .",

Few observations have been done with regard to the functional role of CD13 in malignancies. In melanoma cells, CD13 was reported to act as an auxiliary adhesion molecule that translocates to sites of cell -cell contact (Menrad et al, 1993) . In renal cell carcinoma, fibrosarcoma and melanoma cell lines, CD13 facilitates invasion by degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) (Menrad et al, 1993; Saiki et al, 1993; Fujii et al, 1995) . CD13 is also involved in tumour angiogenesis, since CD13 is present on tumour endothelial cells, but not on existing blood vessels in normal tissues (Pasqualini et al, 2000) . Menrad et al (1993) have been the first to describe the presence of CD13 on melanoma cells, whereas CD13 expression could not be detected on normal melanocytes. Moreover, CD13 expression becomes increasingly prevalent during the process of melanoma progression (Elder et al, 1989; Menrad et al, 1993) and is directly associated with ECM degradation and invasion. Transfection of CD13 into A375M and A2058 human melanoma cells resulted in increased degradation of type IV collagen and invasion in ECM. It was suggested that CD13 may serve as an activator of type IV collagenase required for the invasive and metastatic phenotype of melanoma cells (Fujii et al, 1995) .",

The epithelial promoter is mainly active in epithelial cells of the intestine, kidney, liver and brain and in endothelial cells, while the myeloid promoter is active in monocytes, myeloid leukaemia cells and fibroblasts (Shapiro et al, 1991) . The two promoters are regulated by different transcription factors, but both transcripts result in expression of the same protein. In addition, both promoters are thought to be activated in a mutually exclusive manner (Shapiro et al, 1991) . In endothelial cells, CD13 mRNA and protein expression can be transcriptionally upregulated in response to diverse factors influencing the tumour microenvironment, such as hypoxia and increased presence of angiogenic growth factors such as bFGF, VEGF, tumour necrosis factor a (TNFa) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) (Bhagwat et al, 2001) . The upregulation of CD13 in endothelial cells was shown to be mediated through activation of the proximal promoter of CD13, while its regulation in melanoma cells remains to be determined.",

Since CD13 has been implicated in melanoma invasion, we determined whether this protein was upregulated in our bFGF-overexpressing 1F6 clones. We here report that bFGF induces the expression of CD13 in human melanoma cells resulting in a highly increased invasive capacity. In addition, we report that both CD13 promoters are activated upon upregulation of CD13 by bFGF. Furthermore, we found a strong correlation between bFGF and CD13 expression in a panel of human melanoma cell lines.",

Exponentially growing 1F6 cells and bFGF-overexpressing 1F6 clones in duplicate wells of sixwell plates were transiently transfected with 0.5 mg of each reporter plasmid for 48 h using Fugene 6 transfection reagent (Roche Diagnostics) following the manufacturer's protocol.

Changes in cell morphology were observed in 1F6 cells overexpressing both the 18kD and ALL bFGF isoforms. In contrast to 1F6 cells, which are large cells with numerous dendritic cell processes, 1F6-18kD and 1F6-ALL cells appeared smaller, were more rounded and formed less dendritic cell processes. In addition, significantly accelerated in vitro and in vivo growth rates up to, respectively, two-and three-fold were observed in 1F6 cells and tumours overexpressing either 18kD or ALL bFGF isoforms (Fontijn et al, unpublished data).

In contrast, the high molecular weight (HMW) isoforms are located in the nucleus and are thought to play a role in transcriptional regulation (Renko et al, 1990; Bugler et al, 1991; Florkiewicz et al, 1991; Quarto et al, 1991) . Upon transfection, however, both 1F6-18kD and 1F6-ALL clones expressed similar amounts of CD13, which suggests that expression of the 18kD protein alone is sufficient for the induction of CD13. Moreover, changes in morphology and growth rate were similar between 1F6-18kD and 1F6-ALL clones. Induction of CD13 expression by exogenous bFGF has previously been described in human endothelial cells and is required for vasculogenesis. In the study by Bhagwat et al (2001) , addition of the 18kD bFGF protein to serum-starved HUVECs upregulated CD13 mRNA expression up to 2.5-fold. Although bFGF was the most potent stimulator of CD13 expression in that study, induction of CD13 protein was also observed when endothelial cells were cultured under hypoxic conditions or were treated with the angiogenic growth factors VEGF, TNFa or IGF-1. Inhibition of CD13 expression by bestatin, amastatin or the monoclonal-anti CD13 antibody MY7 resulted in a clear reduction of capillary tube formation of HUVECs, while there was no effect (Bhagwat et al, 2001) . The authors have also reported that exogenous bFGF could induce CD13 expression in KS1767 Kaposi sarcoma cells (Bhagwat et al, 2001) . Recently, Kehlen et al (2003) have shown induction of CD13 expression upon stimulation of serum-starved 1736 thyroid carcinoma cells with bFGF. Repeatedly, we were not able to increase CD13 expression by stimulating serum-starved 1F6 cells with exogenous recombinant human bFGF, regardless efficient stimulation of cell proliferation (data not shown). This finding indicates that the bFGF-mediated induction of CD13 in 1F6 cells is an indirect effect of the transformation process in itself, rather than a direct effect on CD13 promoter activity. Since CD13 can be detected on melanoma cells (Elder et al, 1989; Menrad et al, 1993; Fujii et al, 1995) , we are the first to report that endogenous bFGF can mediate the expression and activity of this protein.",

Although bestatin is often considered to be specific for CD13, it also inhibits other aminopeptidases, such as aminopeptidase B and leucine aminopeptidases (Scornik and Botbol, 2001) . High concentrations of bestatin (150 -300 mM) clearly reduced invasion of HT1080 fibrosarcoma cells and WM1158 melanoma cells through Matrigel (Menrad et al, 1993; Fujii et al, 1996) . WM15 is a monoclonal antibody that specifically neutralises CD13 activity. WM15 has been shown to inhibit invasion through Matrigel, as described for SN12M renal-cell carcinoma, HT1080 fibrosarcoma and A375 melanoma cells (Saiki et al, 1993) . In our bFGF-overexpressing 1F6 clones, both bestatin and WM15 almost completely abrogated the enhanced invasive capacity. This observation indicates that the increased CD13 expression and activity in the bFGF-overexpressing clones is mainly responsible for the facilitated invasive potential.",

As a result, expression of CD13 protein in a particular cell type is thought to be mediated by activation of either the myeloid or the epithelial promoter. We now show that both CD13 promoters can be activated in response to bFGF overexpression. Although in 1F6 cells the basal expression of the myeloid promoter was consistently found to be higher than the activity of the epithelial promoter, both activities were increased to the same extent, up to four-fold in clones 1F6-18kD and 1F6-ALL. We do not know if the current results are specific for melanoma cells, or whether the use of the more sensitive techniques would also allow to detect upregulation of both promoters in other cell types. While initial CD13 promoter studies were performed with chloramphenicol acetyl transferase (CAT) assays and Northern blots (Shapiro et al, 1991) , we made use of RT -PCR and promoter-luciferase assays allowing us to detect the activities of both promoters in 1F6 melanoma cells and clones.",

Petrovic et al (2003) have demonstrated in activated endothelial cells that CD13 transcription was induced by RAS/MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of the transcription factor Ets-2 resulting in increased activity of the epithelial CD13 promoter. In our bFGF-overexpressing 1F6 clones, phospho-AKT and phospho-p38 MAPK levels were increased as compared to basal levels in parent 1F6 cells, while basal phospho-ERK1/2 MAPK was not further increased (Fontijn et al, unpublished data). We are further investigating the possible contribution of the PI-3K/AKT and p38 MAPK signalling pathways in the increased CD13 expression in bFGF-overexpressing 1F6 clones. In general, high CD13 expression in solid tumours in patients is considered as an unfavourable factor. Few clinical studies are available, among which are observations in pancreatic carcinoma, colon carcinoma and thyroid carcinoma, which will be described shortly. CD13 protein expression was detected in 48% of pancreatic carcinoma patients and was significantly associated with a shorter median survival (Ikeda et al, 2003) . The disease-free and overall survival rate for patients with CD13-positive colon carcinoma was significantly lower than that for patients without CD13 expression (Hashida et al, 2002) . Kehlen et al (2003) have shown that CD13 expression in undifferentiated thyroid carcinomas was higher than that in papillary or follicular thyroid carcinomas, suggesting that it is a marker for differentiation. Clinical studies on CD13 expression in cutaneous melanoma are yet to be carried out.",

Upon transfection of CD13 into A375M and A2058 melanoma cells, increased degradation of type IV collagen and invasion in ECM have been observed (Fujii et al, 1995) . These CD13-transfected cells showed a significantly augmented lungcolonising potential in nude mice (Fujii et al, 1995) . The observations are in agreement with our data that 1F6 cells could hardly invade through Matrigel, but their invasive capacity is greatly facilitated in the case of CD13 overexpression. As proof of concept, in our panel of human melanoma cell lines, we found a clear correlation between bFGF and CD13 mRNA and protein expression (Figure 9 ).

Prospective randomised clinical trials in various solid tumours contained either too few patients or were negative to demonstrate a beneficial effect on survival (Ota, 1991) .

Selective inhibition of CD13, or even of bFGF itself, should therefore be an attractive strategy for the treatment of advanced melanoma, but likely also for adjuvant treatment in stage II disease.",

Luciferase-coupled CD13 myeloid (MP) or epithelial (EP) promoter construct (1 mg) and pGL2-basic vector were transiently transfected using a mg DNA : ml Fugene ratio of 3 : 1. Cotransfection with 5 ng pRL-CMV was performed to correct for differences in transfection efficiency between cell lines. Mean values of relative light units (RLU7range) of duplicate samples are shown. The experiment was repeated three times with similar outcome. A) Correlation between bFGF and CD13 mRNA expression in a panel of human melanoma cell lines. cDNAs were analysed for bFGF and CD13 mRNA expression with Light Cycler RT -PCR and plotted as mean relative expression ratios between bFGF, CD13 and human b2microglobulin (hMG) of two independent experiments. Significance was determined with the Spearman's correlation test. (B) Basic fibroblast growth factor and CD13 protein expression in a panel of human melanoma cell lines. Of each cell line, 20 mg (bFGF) or 50 mg (CD13) protein of total cell lysates was subjected to Western blot.
