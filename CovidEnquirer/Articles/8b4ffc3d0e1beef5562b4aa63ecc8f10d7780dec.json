Bovine cryptosporidiosis occurs worldwide with prevalences of 20-80% in young calves in different European countries (Appelbee et al., 2005) . Studies performed in the United States showed that particularly calves at 2 weeks of age were excreting C. parvum oocysts (Santin et al., 2008) with prevalences of 45.8% in calves of 1-8 weeks of age. Prevalences in milking cows were significantly lower and mainly not concerning C. parvum, representing the only zoonotic species and also the most pathogenic species for cattle (Fayer et al., 2007) . Although C. parvum infection is often detected in combination with other enteropathogens such as Rotavirus, Coronavirus, Escherichia coli K99 or Salmonella species, many experimental studies and investigations in the field have shown that Cryptosporidium may act as a primary pathogen (Tzipori et al., 1983; Naciri et al., 1999) . More than 200 substances have been tested against cryptosporidiosis (O'Donoghue, 1995; Stockdale et al., 2008) and some such as halofuginone and decoquinate are reported to exhibit promising effects (Lefay et al., 2001; Lallemand et al., 2006) . Prophylactic administration of paromomycin inhibited oocyst shedding and reduced the number of days with diarrhoea in experimentally infected calves (Fayer and Ellis, 1993) , but in a field trial oocyst shedding and diarrhoea started with withdrawal of the drug and no reduction of the disease was obtained (Grinberg et al., 2002) . Reports on the outcomes of halofuginone treatment are controversial: in some studies, calves showed significantly reduced oocyst excretion and decreased diarrhoea (Joachim et al., 2003) preventing mortality (Naciri et al., 1993) . In another study treatments with halofuginone or decoquinate had no effect on the levels of diarrhoea or dehydration, but halofuginone significantly reduced the excretion of oocysts and decoquinate increased the average daily weight gain of calves (Lallemand et al., 2006) . In a further study the administration of halofuginone during the first 7 days of life inhibited oocyst excretion until 2 weeks of age, but the incidence of diarrhoea was only delayed for 3.1 days and there was no significant difference compared to the control group concerning weight gain (Jarvie et al., 2005) .",

Calves were purchased from surrounding farms 1-3 days after birth and all calves had received colostrum. They were housed in pens (8.5-10.5 m 2 ) in groups of up to 5 animals with a litter of straw over a concrete base. The pens were cleaned daily with hot vapour pressure. Calves were fed with a commercial milk replacer supplied by an automatic milk deliverer; animals with reduced appetite were additionally hand-fed with milk and/or electrolyte solution. Water was supplied ad libitum and from the third week hay was also available. Calves were neither vaccinated, nor did they receive any supplementary vitamins during the experiment. All animals were checked twice daily clinically including faecal consistency and appetite. Weight was recorded daily. At the first manifestation of diarrhoea, faeces from all calves were tested once for antigens of bovine Coronavirus (FASTest 1 BCV), Rotavirus (FASTest 1 Rota), E. coli main pilar K99 (FASTest 1 E. coli-K99) and against C. parvum (FASTest 1 Crypto), all from MegaCor, Austria.",

The drug was described to be also active against microaerophilic and anaerobic bacteria of the gastrointestinal flora (Euzeby et al., 1980) . This could therefore cause significant problems in the gastrointestinal tract of ruminants, which in turn could be more serious than the disease itself (Fox and Saravolatz, 2005; Hemphill et al., 2006) . It has been speculated that gastrointestinal problems could be due to the action of the enzyme pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase (PFOR) or other nitro-reductases which have been hypothesized to reduce the thiazole ring-associated nitro group, and thus kill the intestinal bacterial flora through the production of free radicals (Sisson et al., 2002; Hoffman et al., 2007; reviewed in Hemphill et al., 2006) . A concomitant C. parvum-infection or other infectious agents damaging the superficial intestinal epithelium may enhance the potential toxicity of treatments substances due to augmented resorption. As a consequence the severity of diarrhoea may increase, augmenting also dehydration and mortality of the animals, particularly of this delicate age group. This is the first report about the use of NTZ against Cryptosporidiosis in calves. In conclusion, neither prophylactic nor therapeutic use of NTZ in new born calves infected with C. parvum improved clinical appearance in this preliminary experiment or diminished intensity or duration of oocyst excretion. Treatment with NTZ did not show the expected anti-cryptosporidial effect and appeared to fail. Histopathology would be required to support the hypothesis that NTZ has a negative impact on the integrity of the intestinal epithelium or on the normal flora in the calves, but in consideration of animal welfare reasons the results of this study were not sufficiently encouraging to justify the prosecution of experiments. Table 2 Number of days with oocyst excretion, mean OPG based on daily faecal samples (1-28 dpi) and number of oocysts shed (sum of the daily OPG per calf) on days 1-28 postinfection for each calf of the prophylactic, the therapeutic and the control group.",
