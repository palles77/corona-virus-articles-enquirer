Isolates (n = 53) were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing against six antimicrobial agents (ceftiofur, enrofloxacin, florfenicol, tetracycline, tilmicosin and tulathromycin) using disc diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) assays. Clonal relationships were assessed using repetitive sequence PCR and descriptive epidemiological analysis was performed. The H. somni isolates appeared to be geographically clonal, with 27/53 (47%) isolates grouping in one cluster from one Australian state. On the basis of disc diffusion, 34/ 53 (64%) isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobial agents tested; there was intermediate susceptibility to tulathromycin in 12 isolates, tilmicosin in seven isolates and resistance to tilmicosin in one isolate. Using MIC, all but one isolate was susceptible to all antimicrobial agents tested; the non-susceptible isolate was resistant to tetracycline, but this MIC result could not be compared to disc diffusion, since there are no interpretative guidelines for disc diffusion for H. somni against tetracycline. In this study, there was little evidence of antimicrobial resistance in H. somni isolates from Australian cattle. Disc diffusion susceptibility testing results were comparable to MIC results for most antimicrobial agents tested; however, results for isolates with intermediate susceptibility or resistance to tilmicosin and tulathromycin on disc diffusion should be interpreted with caution in the absence of MIC results.",

Antimicrobial agents including tetracycline, tilmicosin, florfenicol, tulathromycin, ceftiofur and enrofloxacin are used routinely to prevent and/or treat BRD (Welsh et al., 2004) . A reliance on these drugs creates a selection pressure that may result in the emergence of drug-resistant microorganisms (Barton et al., 2003) . Resistance is emerging amongst BRD pathogens, particularly to those antimicrobial agents from first generation classes (e.g. tetracycline) (Welsh et al., 2004; Portis et al., 2012) . Moreover, antimicrobial resistance patterns vary according to bacterial species and geographical location (Hendriksen et al., 2008) , meaning that local knowledge of susceptibilities is critical for the effective prevention and treatment of H. somni infections.",

The isolates in cluster 6 were cultured from 1989 to 2011 and 85% were from cattle used for meat/ feedlot production, but few conclusions can be drawn about the virulence potential of these isolates until further characterisation is performed. While this study was able to demonstrate low levels of resistance in H. somni isolates tested against a panel of commercially available antimicrobial agents, there are certain limitations to the study design. The sample size (n = 53) was too small to be able to draw definitive conclusions based on epidemiological data. Data were limited to histories provided at the time of submission.
