            "text": "Just as China's economy grows and develops at a very fast pace, its system for watching over drug safety is evolving very quickly as well. Whereas two decades ago, it would have been next to impossible to identify a noncentralized safety problem, nowadays, the national drug safety system, headed by the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) is quite likely to identify it, investigate it, and solve it. Although patterned loosely after more developed systems, like the system involving the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States, the Chinese system has some unique features, stemming partly from its very large 1.3 billion population, its extreme regional demographic disparities, and different clinical practices. The system has already been tested heavily. Shortly after several high-profile pharmaceuticals like Vioxx (rofecoxib), Baycol (cerivastatin), and Propusid (cisapride) were withdrawn from the US market, the SFDA was able to react quickly by either issuing a drug-use warning or withdrawing the drug from the Chinese market as well. Moreover, it has faced several challenges within its own borders. In this review article, we first describe the Chinese system for drug safety surveillance, which relies strongly on the adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting and monitoring system and some major Chinese drug-safety regulations. We also describe the system's response to three drug safety events, one involving a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), the heartleaf houttuynia herb, one involving the Armillarisni A injection, and the third involving clindamycin glucose infusions. We conclude by comparing the Chinese system with drug safety frameworks in the United States and the European Union. Because the Chinese system is so new, there is no scholarly literature as yet on the economics of improved drug safety in China. However, in the United States, where a longer surveillance history exists, drugrelated morbidity and mortality are major patient safety issues that have an estimated US$177.4 billion annual cost because of treatment failures and new medical problems they generate [1] . The overall incidence of serious and fatal ADRs in US hospitals is estimated to be 6.7% and 0.32% of hospitalized patients, respectively [2] . This estimation implies 76,000-137,000 fatal ADRs each year in the mid-1990s, making ADR mortality the sixth leading cause of death in the United States. By the time that Vioxx\u00ae was withdrawn from the market in September 2004, the number of people who suffered heart attacks, strokes, and blood clots (often with significant health care costs and resource utilization) because of the drug was estimated to be over 100,000 [3] . Hence, improvements in either the ADR reporting system or in the techniques used to screen ADRs are expected to lead to significant improvements in clinical as well as economic outcomes in any country.",

In late 1989, the National Center for ADR Monitoring was formally established and primarily focused on 85 hospitals nationwide that were responsible for monitoring ADR events [4, 5] . In 1998, the National Center joined the World Health Organization's Collaborating Center for International Drug Monitoring (called the Uppsala Monitoring Center) [4, 5] . In 1999, the National Center for ADR Monitoring which also houses the Center for Drug Reevaluation (CDR) joined the SFDA and reports to both the SFDA and the MOH. The National Center consists of five divisions and has a network of 32 provincial centers for ADR monitoring that are affiliated with local SFDA offices in different provinces, autonomous regions, and municipal governments [6] .",

It is the responsibility of the regional center to report all new ADRs/ADEs and all serious ADRs/ADEs within three days to the National Center. Other ADR/ADE reports are sent from the regional centers to the National Center on a quarterly basis. The Internet is used for the filing of all reports, and advanced information technology supports the system. Whereas the National Center received a total of 4700 reports in the 11 years from 1988 through 1999, it received 17,000 in the year 2002 alone, and an incredible 173,000 in 2005 (see Fig. 2 ) [4, 7] . The system is clearly now receiving heavy use. This spontaneous reporting system can be used by any alert physician or other health care professional who thinks that a disease, symptom, or disorder might be related to the use of a particular drug.",

Of course, the easy-to-use, inexpensive spontaneous reporting system has its limitations. The number of ADR/ADE reports alone does not provide an ADR/ADE incidence rate, because we do not generally know the number of people exposed to a specific drug. Moreover, the information on the ADR/ADE reports may have inaccuracies and omissions. Finally, even with the large number of reports being submitted, it is still probably the case that significant under-reporting is still occurring in some parts of China.",

This regulation includes administrative responsibilities, reporting procedures, and measures for evaluation and control [11] .

The Regulation requires pharmaceutical companies, distributors, pharmacies, and medical organizations to monitor and report all ADRs/ADEs.

Deadly ADRs/ADEs must be reported immediately to the provincial monitoring center, which is then required to investigate and verify the event, as well as report it to the National Center within three days. Those reports should be accompanied by suggestions for follow-up action.",

The first challenge described in this section came from a TCM: heartleaf houttuynia herb (Yu Xing Cao) which has been orally administered in China for more than 2000 years [15, 16] . In the 1980s, however, injectable formulations of the heartleaf houttuynia herb were approved by the SFDA, and because of their cheap prices and rapid effect, became widely used in clinical practice for infections. From 1988 to 2003, the National Center for ADR Monitoring received 272 ADR/ADE reports, 52 of which were for severe ADRs/ ADEs, related to its injection [17] [18] [19] . In August 2003, the National Center issued a warning letter to health professionals [18] . Then, on June 1, 2006, the SFDA temporarily withdrew all seven injectable forms of the heartleaf houttuynia herb from the market [20] . After a three-month evaluation, the SFDA decided to let the injection return to the market step by step with riskmanagement (e.g., collecting ADR/ADE reports and alerting clinicians about appropriate use) [21] . In addition, production of the heartleaf houttuynia herb must follow strict requirements. Another unique drug safety event threatened the Chinese people in the summer of 2006. After receiving injections of clindamycin phosphate glucose, many people were becoming violently ill with multiple symptoms including chest distress, abdominal pain, pain in the kidney, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and anaphylactic shock [22] . More than 100 severe ADRs/ADEs, including nine fatalities, across 15 provinces, were reported to the National Center for ADR Monitoring [22, 23] . On July 27, just three days after the first suspected fatal case, the SFDA posted an ADR warning for the clindamycin injection on its Web site. After a preliminary investigation, the SFDA asked for a nationwide recall of the injections on August 4 [24] . Soon it was found that a single brand of clindamycin, Xinfu, produced by the Anhui Huayuan Company, was responsible for the ADEs. The ADEs were caused by bacterial infections during production. Throughout the investigation process, the MOH worked closely with the SFDA to develop guidance for physicians and hospitals regarding treatment of patients reacting to the Xinfu injection. On August 3, the MOH activated its emergency daily reporting system-last used during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in China-in 2003 [24] .",

Moreover, it is very clear that the Chinese government still has significant work to do regarding safe manufacturing practices. The Anhui Huayuan Pharmacy Company is not the first company to violate Good Manufacturing Practice standards. In fact, in Spring 2006, shortly before the Xinfu events, at least 11 people fell ill and five people died after taking an injection of Armillarisni A (a drug used to treat gall bladder, liver, and gastric disorders) made by Qiqihar No. 2 Pharmaceutical Co. in China's Heilongjiang Province [25] . The drug company used diglycol instead of propylene glycol for the production of the Armillarisni A in September 2005. Diglycol caused acute kidney failure for patients taking Armillarisni A. The disaster caused a national outcry and prompted the government to shut down the Qiqihar Company.",

The FDA Guidance requires companies to identify and describe drug safety signals, to investigate signals beyond case review, and to interpret signals in terms of risk.

Elements for clinical specification involve limitations of clinical trial safety data, postmarketing exposure, populations not studied, identified and potential ADRs/ADEs, disease epidemiology, potential medication error, and class effects. The RMP requires that pharmaceutical companies collect drug safety data once a drug is marketed in order to identify safety risks and benefits. The EU-RMP activity includes signal detection, adverse reaction reporting, periodic utilization reports, and pharmacoepidemiological studies. The EU-RMP is needed primarily for newly marketed products. It is useful as well when there are significant changes to marketing authorization with a new dosage form, a new route of administration, or new indications/patient populations. To protect public health and reduce the burden of ADRs/ADEs, the Guideline discusses risk minimization tools that might effectively reduce risk for patients and/or populations, including label changes, warnings, educational programs for health care professionals and the public, such as letters, a physician's guide to prescribing, a pharmacist's guide to dispensing, patient information brochures, patient registries, informed consent, and so on.",

Second, China does have some well-developed systems in other countries that it can try to mimic, to the extent that it makes sense. It can watch the new developments across the globe to find best practices for application. In particular, both the United States and the E.U. have recently issued risk-management guidelines which attempt to balance the benefits of pharmaceuticals with their safety risks of adverse reactions. Third, the evolution of thinking about drug safety surveillance is that there should be a multidisciplinary approach to drug safety, making use of expertise in all relevant disciplines.
