A total of 649 patients , was defined as the peak period of incidence and was compared with the same period in 2002. During the SARS epidemic, there was a 21% decrease in the number of patient consultations and a 15% reduction in the number of patients treated with RT. There was no significant change in the tumor type or reason for referral. Short fractionation schedules were employed for 35% of treated patients compared with 34% in 2002. Patient waiting times between referral and treatment decreased during the period of interest, from 16 days to 8 days (P = 0.021). This study demonstrates a reduction in palliative RT services that is similar in magnitude to decreases observed in other essential cancer services during the SARS epidemic. Use of single-fraction RT and delayed follow-up visits may help to minimize hospital transfers and visits in the event of future infectious disease outbreaks.",

The number of patients accessing these services decreased in April and May 2003 compared with the same time period in 2002. 4 The decreases ranged from 6% for lumpectomy/mastectomy (May 2003) to 27% in the number of breast biopsies (April 2003). The present study demonstrates a similar decrease in the number of patients evaluated by the palliative RT program (21%) and the number of patients receiving palliative RT (15%). There are multiple causes for decreased patient access to palliative RT during the SARS outbreak. The decrease in the number of patients seen is largely attributable to fewer patients attending the clinic for follow-up, with a 60% decrease during the period of interest compared with the previous year. The cancer center was classified as a level 0 facility, which was defined as a health care facility with no known cases of probable or suspected SARS, which would prevent the transfer of any patients located at facilities classified as levels 1-3 (those with \u2265 1 suspected or probable case). Access to palliative RT may also have been affected by patient and physician perceptions of the cancer center, which is associated organizationally and geographically with Sunnybrook and Womens' College Health Sciences Centre (designated a level 2 facility). Similarly, patients' and physicians' perceptions of exposure to SARS or the risk of transmission of SARS to individuals seen or treated by the RRRP provides another possible factor that may have contributed to the decrease in access and utilization of services provided by the RRRP.",

There was no significant change in fractionation schedules or the number of follow-up visits. Waiting times actually decreased, possibly attributable to the decreased number of patients seen. This may be a result of priorities being shifted such that lessurgent cases were delayed until after the acute phase of the SARS crisis had passed.",
