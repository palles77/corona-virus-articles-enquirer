To identify the molecule that interacts with JHMV, we focused on heparan sulfate (HS) since it works as a receptor of a mutant MHV-rec1 that infects in an MHVR-independent fashion. The present study indicates that HS interacts with both wt JHMVand srr7 but it does not function as an entry receptor as it apparently does for MHV-rec1. Furthermore, HS failed to serve as an entry receptor in the MHVR-independent infection of wt JHMV, indicating that HS is not a host factor that wt JHMV utilizes in an MHVR-independent infection.",

            "text": "The highly neurovirulent JHMV strain of MHV is able to spread from cells infected via the receptor for MHV (MHVR), a carcinoembryonic cell adhesion molecule 1 (Dveksler et al., 1991) , to cells without MHVR (MHVR-independent infection) (Gallagher et al., 1992; Taguchi and Matsuyama, 2002) , while a mutant srr7 (soluble-receptor-resistant mutant 7) isolated from the JHMV cl-2 strain (wt JHMV) because of its resistance to inactivation by soluble form of MHVR (soMHVR) lacks this ability . The mutation responsible for the srr7 phenotype was mapped to S2 (Saeki et al., 1997) . MHVR-independent infection is attributed to a unique feature of the S protein of wt JHMV, namely the labile association of S1 with S2. Dissociation of S1 from S2 triggers a conformational changes in S2 and facilitate virus-cell membrane fusion (Gallagher, 1997; Krueger et al., 2001; Matsuyama and Taguchi, 2002) . A key condition for this infection may be that the dissociation of S1 takes place in close proximity to MHVR-negative cells, so that the fusion peptide is exposed and penetrates into the adjacent cell membrane. We found that both wt JHMV and srr7 attached to MHVR-negative cells (Watanabe et al., 2006) and infection could be activated by the addition of soMHVR, indicating that wt JHMV and srr7 may bind to molecules other than MHVR. Mutants of the A59 strain of MHV that arose during persistent infection of cell expressing MHVR (Sawicki et al., 1995) were reportedly able to infect MHVR-negative cells (Baric et al., 1999 (Baric et al., , 1997 Schickli et al., 1997) . One of the mutants, MHV-BHK, utilized heparan sulfate (HS) as a receptor (de Haan et al., 2005) . This virus has three copies of the putative HS-binding motif in its S protein: one in the S1 as a 7-amino acid insertion that is not present in the original MHV-A59, one in the cleavage site and one in the S2 subunit (de Haan et al., 2005) , as illustrated in Fig. 1 . These binding motifs are thought to make it possible to use HS as an attachment/entry receptor. There is one copy of the HS-binding motif adjacent to the cleavage site in the S protein of both wt JHMVand srr7 (Fig. 1 ). This suggests that HS might also interact Virology 366 (2007) We also addressed whether or not HS is responsible for the MHVR-independent infection by the wt JHMV.",

            "text": "We have previously reported that highly neurovirulent wt JHMV could infect cells lacking MHVR if it was forced to attach to cells by spinoculation, i.e. infection by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. We also found that both wt JHMV and srr7 attached to MHVR-negative BHK cells during a standard infection protocol, i.e. without spinoculation (Watanabe et al., 2006) . To further confirm these findings, we inoculated 10 5 PFU, corresponding to ca. 10 7 copies of genome of those viruses onto MHVR-negative BHK cells and BHK-R1 cells, which express MHVR, without spinoculation. We then evaluated the copy number of the attached viruses by real-time PCR analysis. As shown in Fig. 2A , about 10 5.5 and 10 5 copies of wt JHMV and srr7, respectively, attached to the BHK cells, which was about 50% of the binding to BHK-R1 cells. This finding clearly indicated that wt JHMV and srr7 attached, even onto MHVR-negative cells. To evaluate the infectivity of the attached virus, 50 nM of soMHVR was added to the culture of BHK cells inoculated with wt JHMV and srr7 and those cells were further incubated for 14 h at 37\u00b0C. As shown in Fig. 2B , srr7 efficiently infected BHK cells in the presence of 50 nM of soMHVR but not at all without soMHVR. Infection of MHVRnegative cells with wt JHMV was greatly enhanced by soMHVR, although a very low level of infection was found without soMHVR (Fig. 2B) , which was presumably due to an extremely inefficient MHVR-independent infection after ordinary protocol of infection. These results are in good agreement with our previous findings that soMHVR facilitated the infection of both wt JHMVand srr7 after adsorption onto MHVR-negative cells (Watanabe et al., 2006) , suggesting that some molecule(s) on the cell surface other than MHVR allow the attachment of both wt JHMV and srr7.",

Because JHMV also has one potential HS-binding site, we evaluated the contribution of HS to wt JHMV and srr7 attachment to the cell surface by treating the cells with heparinase. As shown in Fig.  3A , heparinases reduced cell surface HS effectively as shown by FACS analysis, but had little effect on the level of MHVR of BHK-R1 cells. To determine the effect of removing HS on wt JHMVand srr7 attachment of BHK and BHK-R1 cells, the cells, either treated with heparinases or left untreated, were then inoculated with 10 7 copies of viruses and incubated for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. After removal of unattached virus by washing with PBS, cell-associated total RNA was extracted, and the number of viral genomes was measured by real-time PCR. The data in Fig. 3B show that heparinases reduced viral attachment by approximately one-half on both BHK and BHK-R1 cells, suggesting that about 50% of JHMV attached to target cells via HS, irrespective of the presence or absence of MHVR on the cell surface.",

As shown in Fig. 3C , virus infection of BHK cells was reduced by heparinase treatment in a heparinase concentration-dependent manner. At the highest concentration, a 70-90% reduction was observed, when compared to untreated cells. Together with the data shown in Fig. 3B that the binding of srr7 is reduced by heparinase treatment, the data in Fig. 3C suggest that srr7 bound HS in a physiologically active form since addition of soMHVR facilitated the infection to cells to which srr7 bound. The infection was not reduced in MHVRpositive BHK-R1 cells by heparinase treatment (Fig. 3C ), indicating that HS does not influence the infection by srr7 via MHVR.",

The pretreatment of viruses with heparin with the same disaccharide-repeating units as HS can generally block virus infection when cell surface HS contributes to their attachment/infection (Liu and Thorp, 2002) . We mixed srr7 with heparin and incubated the sample at 4\u00b0C for 1 h before inoculation of BHK or BHK-R1 cells. Infection of BHK cells was examined in the presence of soMHVR. Heparin reduced soMHVR-mediated infection of BHK cells by srr7 at a concentration of 5 \u03bcg/ml or higher (Fig. 3D) , suggesting that HS is the molecule that interacts with srr7 to attach it to the cell surface. There was no effect of heparin on virus infection of BHK-R1 cells. This suggested that the region of S protein responsible for heparin binding is different from that required for MHVR binding. In combination with the observation that normal BHK cells, untreated with heparinase, are not at all permissive to srr7 infection, the above data collectively suggest that HS is a binding molecule but does not function as a receptor for infection nor enhance MHVR-mediated infection.",

It was further shown that HS does not work as a receptor for MHVRindependent infection by wt JHMV, namely infection by spinoculation. We have also confirmed the previous observation that MHV-rec1, another MHV with MHVR-independent infection activity, is able to use HS as a functional receptor. The remarkable biological difference between wt JHMV and MHV-rec1 (Schickli et al., 1997) is that the latter infects cells without MHVR by the standard protocol of infection; however, the former fails to infect under such conditions. Wt JHMV must be forced to attach to cells by spinoculation when it executes the infection of MHVR-negative cells. This difference could be attributed to the nature of S protein in terms of its process of binding to HS; MHV-rec1 has three copies of the HS-binding motif, while wt JHMV S contains only one copy (Fig. 1) . This difference could affect the strength of binding between HS and the S protein. It is possible that tight binding of MHV-rec1 with HS could trigger the conformational changes of the S protein and facilitate its infection, while weak binding of the wt JHMV S protein with HS fails to trigger the conformational changes and also, therefore, entry. In fact, de Haan et al. (2006) reported that cooperative involvement of two regions containing HS consensus sequences is important for the utilization of HS as an entry receptor by MHV-rec1.",

Before permissive cell lines become available for virus propagation, JHM strains of MHV have been maintained over the years by passage through mouse brains, where only microglia cells are positive for MHVR among the various types of cells (Nakagaki et al., 2005; Ramakrishna et al., 2004) . To survive in the brain, JHMV would have to have been selected during passage through the mouse brains because of its unique ability to spread to a variety of MHVR-negative cells. Thus, the original virus may have been more like srr7 that infects truly in an MHVR-dependent fashion. Also, MHV-A59 mutant viruses that have a wide range of hosts were selected from unusual infection environments: some were forced to infect cells without MHVR (Baric et al., 1999; Baric et al., 1997) and the others were isolated from persistently infected cells with profoundly reduced MHVR expression (Sawicki et al., 1995; Schickli et al., 1997 Schickli et al., , 2004 . Thus, the viruses that survived to grow in an environment of reduced or no receptor expression could have adapted to use another molecule as a receptor, as did MHV-rec1, while some others, like wt JHMV, established unique features to allow them to survive in the environment. Comparative studies on the S proteins of these viruses that infect in an MHVR-independent fashion will be of interest in terms of the molecular mechanism of receptor independence in viral infection.",
