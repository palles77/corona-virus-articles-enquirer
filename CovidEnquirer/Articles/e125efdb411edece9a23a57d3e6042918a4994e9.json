Since SD and SK were isolated by inoculation of multiple sclerosis (MS) central nervous system (CNS) tissue into mice or cultured mouse cells, it is important to determine their relationships to other murine and human coronavirus isolates. Our results indicate that SD and SK share almost complete nucleotide homology (approximately 90% ) with MHV-A59 and generate subgenomic RNAs of the same sizes as MHV-A59. The human coronavirus (HCV) strains tested show less homology with MHV-A59. The immunologically unrelated HCV-229E shows no nucleotide homology with MHV-A59. The immunologically crossreactive HCV-OC43 shows nucleotide homology with MHV-A59 by blot hybridization but not when hybridized in solution and assayed by S1 nuclease digestion.",

After initial panencephalitis caused by MHV-JHM, this virus produces a persistent infection with primary demyelination with some evidence for remyelination (Weiner, 1973) .

There is one report of particles with coronavirus-like morphology seen by electron microscopy in brain tissue from an MS patient (Tanaka et al., 1976) . More recently Burks and co-workers have isolated two coronaviruses, designated SD and SK, by intracerebral inoculation of unfrozen MS CNS autopsy tissue either into weanling mice or into 17CL-1 mouse cells in culture (Burks et al., 1980) . Gerdes et al. (1981a, b) and we (this manuscript) have examined the relationship between these viruses and other known murine and human coronaviruses. Gerdes et al. (1981a, b) showed that SD and SK are antigenically related to MHV-A59 and to HCV-OC43 but not HCV-229E. They were inconclusive about which strains their isolates were more related to. We have further compared murine and human coronaviruses and SD and SK by using molecular hybridization of virus-specific RNA with cDNA probes. Our results show extensive nucleotide homology between SD and SK and MHV-A59, more than that between the human viruses and MHV-A59.",

            "text": "We have used nucleic acid hybridization with cDNA to further explore the relationship among these viruses. Our cDNAs are representative of most if not all of the genome RNA sequences Leibowitz, 1981, 1983) and thus are appropriate reagents for quantitating sequence homologies. The relationship between SD and SK and MHV-A59 as determined by molecular hybridization experiments basically agrees with immunological studies. The SD and SK viruses show extensive homology in nucleotide sequence (approximately 90%) to the A59 strain of MHV even when assayed by the stringent $1 nu-clease assay. This is more homology than that shared between MHV-A59 and another MHV strain, JHM Leibowitz, 1981, 1983) . Furthermore, the pattern of intracellular RNAs generated by SK and SD is very similar to that of MHV-A59. This is not surprising, considering that Gerdes et al., (1981a, b) showed that cells infected by SD or SK have patterns of viral proteins similar to A59-infected cells (Gerdes et al., 1981a, b) . An extra polypeptide of 42,000 daltons molecular weight was observed in , or SK (lane c) were electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel containing formaldehyde as a denaturant (Lehrach et aL, 1977) . After electrophoresis the gel was stained with ethidium bromide to locate ribosomal RNAs, blotted onto nitrocellulose (Thomas, 1980) , hybridized with l0 s cpm of A59 [32p]cDNA, and autoradiographed (Alwine et al., 1977) . Arrows designate the position of 18 S and 28 S ribosomal RNAs. Viral RNAs are numbered according to (Bailey and Davidson, 1976) . After electrophoresis the gel was stained with ethidium bromide to locate ribosomal RNAs and fluorographed (Chamberlain et aL, 1979) . The positions of 18 S and 28 S ribosomal RNAs are designated by arrows.",

However, there is similar variation among the MHV strains (Cheley et al., 1981b; Leibowitz et al., 1981; Weiss and Leibowitz, 1981 ) and we do not understand its significance.

This homology is not detected when liquid hybridization followed by the more stringent S1 nuclease assay is used. There is precedence for this in at least two other systems. Homology between murine and human papovaviruses (Howley et al., 1979) and murine and human rotaviruses (Schroeder et aL, 1982) is detected only under relaxed hybridization and assay conditions.

This is not surprising considering these viruses fall into different antigenic groups (Pederson et al., 1978) . However, there are reports of immunological cross-reactivity between the nucleocapsid proteins of these viruses (Gerdes et al., 1981b) .

It is possible that the 10% of SD and SK sequences that are not homologous to MHV-A59 are homologous to either HCu or HCV-229E. However, if that were the case, it would still suggest that these isolates are more related to murine than human coronaviruses.
