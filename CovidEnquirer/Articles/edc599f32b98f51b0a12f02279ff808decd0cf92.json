One potential source of an emerging pathogen is a different host species (a 'reservoir') in which the pathogen is already established (Table 1) . Switches from one host species to another (species 'jumps') have led to some of the most devastating disease epidemics recorded, including the ongoing HIV/AIDS pandemic in human communities worldwide, the decimation of the European rabbit population by myxomatosis during the mid 20th century, the catastrophic impact of rinderpest on African ruminants during the late 19th century and, more recently, widespread mortality of North Sea seals as a result of distemper [2] [3] [4] [5] . It has even been argued that many of the main killer diseases of humans (e.g. measles, TB, influenza and smallpox) emerged through pathogens jumping from domestic animals to humans over the past 10 000 years [6] . Species jumps have also given rise to devastating epidemics of plant pathogens in crop species (e.g. potato late blight in the cultivated potato) and in wild plant species (e.g. the near extinction of American chestnut trees by chestnut blight) [7] [8] [9] .",

Moreover, there are many pathogens that have a long history of routinely jumping between species (e.g. rabies virus into humans from domestic or wild carnivores) without, again, triggering major epidemics in the 'new' host population. Understanding the epidemiology and evolutionary biology underlying these differences is crucial for understanding the phenomenon of emerging infectious diseases in human, domestic animal, wildlife and plant populations.",

The expected size of an outbreak depends upon the number of introductions, so-called 'primary' cases of infection, and the potential for transmission of the pathogen from one new host to another (Box 1, Figure Ia ). This transmission potential can be expressed in terms of the basic reproduction number, R 0 , and pathogens that enter a new host population via a species jump can be placed in two categories depending on its value. If R 0 is !1 in the new host population then, even if the new host repeatedly acquires the pathogen, there will be only limited spread of infection within that population. This category of emerging pathogen is unlikely to constitute the greatest disease threat; examples in humans include the Ebola, monkeypox and avian influenza viruses and the vCJD agent. Conversely, if R 0 is O1 in the new host population, then there is a finite chance (Box 1, Figure Ib ) that a major epidemic will occur. This category is likely to constitute the greatest disease threat; examples in humans include HIV, influenza type A virus and SARS coronavirus.",

There is a transition between these behaviours in the region R 0 z1, where the size of an epidemic is highly sensitive to small changes in the transmission potential (Box 1, Figure Ia ). This is especially relevant to pathogen emergence because it implies that relatively small changes in R 0 can have large impacts on the incidence of infection. As has been widely discussed, there are many reasons why R 0 might change. These include:",

For example, urbanization has been cited as a key factor increasing the transmission potential of many human viral and bacterial infections [10, 11] , as has the extremely high densities of European wheat and barley crops for diseases such as yellow rust and powdery mildew, respectively [12, 13] . Another example is the ongoing concern that climate change might be associated with changing distributions of vector-borne diseases, such as tick-borne encephalitis and Lyme disease [14] [15] [16] ; \u2020 Changes in host behaviour and movements. For example, patterns of sexual behaviour directly affect the potential spread of sexually transmitted diseases [10, 17] , and global travel exacerbated the spread of SARS [18] ; \u2020 Changes in host phenotype. For example, immunosuppression during hospital treatments or due to the effects of HIV/AIDS has been cited as contributing to the spread of numerous infections (e.g. the fungal pathogen Pneumocystis carinii) [10, 11, 17] . The loss of cross-immunity (where acquired immune responses induced by exposure to one microorganism are at least partially protective against infection with another; a quite general concept that, for example, underlies the efficacy of BCG vaccination) might also increase the potential for invasions by new pathogens, as has been suggested for several pairings: yaws and syphilis; leprosy and TB; yellow fever and dengue fever; smallpox and monkeypox; and vivax malaria and falciparum malaria [17, 19, 20] ; \u2020 Changes in host genetics. For example, the loss of major histocompatibility complex haplotypes or other genetic diversity in inbred livestock or small populations might increase susceptibility to infection [21] . Among plants, the use of single cultivars increases the vulnerability of many crop species to widespread epidemics of pathogens spilling over from closely related wild host species: for example, commercial banana plantations composed of a single clone are at risk from various races of Panama disease, Fusarium oxysporum [22] ; \u2020 Changes in pathogen genetics (discussed in detail below).",

The rate of exposure will be a function of the ecologies and behaviour of the two host species and of the transmission biology of the pathogen itself (including the biology of any vectors involved). Indeed 'ecological' change, in its broadest sense, is associated with most instances of disease emergence [11, 23, 24] ; for example, those of phocine distemper, Lyme disease, BSE and hepatitis C. For vector-borne diseases, exposure of new host species might be facilitated by the pathogen jumping between vector species or populations, as has been suggested for Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) [25] . Review TRENDS in Ecology and Evolution Vol.20 No. 5 May 2005 The second step is for the pathogen to be able to infect the new host; that is, for pathogen and host to be 'compatible'. Pathogens have highly variable host ranges: some only naturally infect a single species (e.g. the mumps virus or Plasmodium falciparum in humans), whereas others can infect hosts from different taxonomic orders or even classes (e.g. rabies virus or the protozoan Blastocystis hominis) [26] . The reasons for this variation are poorly understood, although certain factors, such as an indirect route of transmission, are known to be associated with a broad host range [26] . For viruses, one such factor is the use of cell receptors that are phylogenetically conserved [23] . Crucial to the ability of a cell-free virus to infect hosts is the presence of appropriate cell receptors on host cells. When receptors are conserved across a range of potential host species, the hosts are likely to be predisposed to Box 1. Epidemic thresholds and R 0 , the basic reproduction number",

R 0 defines an important threshold: if R 0 O1, each primary infection will, on average, generate more than one secondary infection and the pathogen is capable of invading the host population; if R 0 !1, each primary case will, on average, fail to replace itself (although short chains of transmission are still possible) and each single introduction will lead to no more than a minor outbreak.",

However, even if capable of infecting a different host species, pathogens are usually, although not always, significantly less infectious to it. This is referred to as the 'species barrier', and it can be substantial, implying that much higher doses are required to infect the new host: for example, the dose of rabies virus from foxes required to infect dogs and cats has been shown experimentally to be up to a million times greater than that required to infect other foxes [28] .",

It is relatively simple to see that the probability of emergence increases linearly with I 0 , but is much more sensitive to the evolution of R 0 , particularly when this is close to 1 [19] . This is because the probability of each (rare) evolutionary step is proportional to the expected size of the initial outbreak and, hence, the number of opportunities for the required genetic change(s) to occur (Box 1, Figure Ic ). The expected size of an outbreak is related non-linearly to R 0 (Box 1, Figure Ia) and, because conditions are likely to differ from outbreak to outbreak, outbreak sizes in practice tend to be highly overdispersed, with occasional larger outbreaks providing more opportunities for adaptation ( Figure 2) .",

For example, fluctuating transmission rates can increase persistence times for pathogens with R 0 !1 [40] . It is also possible that, rather than single introduction(s) into a new host population, there are periods when the pathogen is spreading in a mixture of host species (e.g. as has been proposed for human sleeping sickness [41] ); this could increase persistence times in the new host but, simultaneously, reduce selection pressure on the pathogen to adapt to the new host. And the new host population itself is unlikely to be homogeneous: some individuals might be more susceptible to novel pathogens (e.g. owing to immunosuppression) and/or more exposed to them (e.g. owing to their behaviour or spatial location [42] ) and/or more likely to transmit infection (so-called 'supershedders'). Such heterogeneities can increase outbreak sizes [5] . The structure of the new host population might also be important: contrast Ebola, which usually affects remote communities, with SARS, which arose in a region with high human population density, large numbers of movements and extensive travel. Similarly, the HIV/AIDS epidemic apparently took off once it had escaped remote communities and entered urban populations [17] . The general issue here is the relationship between 'samplers' (individuals with high risk of acquiring novel infections) and 'spreaders' (individuals with high potential for transmitting a novel infection onwards within the new host population): the closer the epidemiological linkage between these groups the greater the potential for successful invasions by new pathogens. The mechanism of genetic change of the pathogen is also likely to be important: if it can evolve not only by mutation, but also by recombination (e.g. influenza viruses and SARS coronavirus [32, 43] ) or by gene capture (e.g. pathogenicity islands or antimicrobial resistance genes in bacteria [44, 45] ) or by hybridization (e.g. P. alni) then this might influence the epidemiology of species jumps by requiring the same host to be co-infected with two different pathogens, perhaps from different sources.",

Although it is extremely hard to predict which pathogens are most likely to jump between host species, there are some hints that some progress can be made. For example, perhaps the most striking feature of the list of examples of species jumps given in Table 1 is that the pathogens involved are mostly, and disproportionately, single-stranded RNA viruses. Although Table 1 should not be regarded as an exhaustive survey, this might well be a genuine effect reflecting the typically broader host ranges and much higher mutation rates of RNA viruses [26] , facilitating both the initial infection of a new host and subsequence adaptation to that host. Further refining this observation, none of the RNA viruses listed are transmitted by arthropod vectors, perhaps reflecting the constraints imposed on a small genome by having to be compatible with a vector as well as a definitive host. In support of this, both emerging and long-recognised zoonotic RNA arboviruses tend to be poorly transmissible between humans [24, 25] , although experimental evidence for such constraints is inconclusive [25] .",
