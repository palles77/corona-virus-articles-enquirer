It is currently unknown whether Tritrichomonas foetus or Pentatrichomonas hominis is identified more commonly in dogs with trichomonosis or how often these infections are accompanied by concurrent enteric infectious agents. The objective of this study was to determine the identity of trichomonads present in a series of 38 unsolicited canine diarrheic fecal samples submitted for T. foetus diagnostic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing between 2007 and 2010. We also examined each fecal sample for an association of trichomonosis with concurrent infection using a convenient real-time PCR panel for nine gastrointestinal pathogens. P. hominis, T. foetus, or both were identified by PCR in feces of 17, 1, and 1 dogs respectively. Feces from the remaining 19 dogs were PCR negative for T. foetus, P. hominis and using broader-spectrum Trichomonadida primers. The total number and specific identities of concurrent enteropathogens identified did not differ between fecal samples from dogs that were or were not identified by PCR as infected with trichomonads. These results suggest that P. hominis infection is more frequently identified than T. foetus infection in diarrheic dogs with trichomonosis and that concurrent enteropathogen infection is common in this population.",

These protozoa are obligate parasites of warm, moist, and anaerobic locations within the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract (Felleisen, 1999) . In dogs and cats, trichomonads were initially thought to be only opportunistic commensals. However, in 2003 the pathogen Tritrichomonas foetus was identified as a cause of large bowel diarrhea in the cat (Levy et al., 2003) . Both T. foetus and an unrelated trichomonad, Pentatrichomonas hominis have been infrequently reported in dogs and their pathogenicity is unknown (Gookin et al., 2005 (Gookin et al., , 2007 Kim et al., 2010) . In particular, P. hominis is presumed to be a commensal that may overgrow in dogs with other causes of diarrhea. It is unclear if T. foetus or P. hominis is more common in dogs with trichomonosis or how often these infections are accompanied by concurrent infections.",

Each extract of fecal DNA was then subjected to singletube nested PCR amplification of a 208-bp sequence of the partial internal transcribed spacer region (ITSR) 1 and 5.8S rRNA gene of T. foetus using previously published reaction conditions and primer sequences (Gookin et al., 2005) . Amplicons migrating at 208-bp based on gel electrophoresis were digested with ApoI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) at 50 \u2022 C for 90 min. Electrophoresis of 10 l of each digest in a 3.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide was performed to confirm the presence of specific confirmatory bands at 89 and 119-bp (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Each DNA extract was subjected to PCR amplification of a 339-bp sequence of partial 18S rRNA gene of P. hominis using previously published reaction conditions and primer sequences (Gookin et al., 2007) . Amplification products of the appropriate size were submitted for purification and bi-directional DNA sequencing (MCLAB, San Francisco, CA). Finally, DNA extracts that tested negative for T. foetus and P. hominis rRNA genes were assayed for the presence of DNA sequences sharing common identity with a larger number of trichomonadida. PCR amplification of 339 to 372-bp sequences of partial ITS1, 5.8S, and ITS2 rRNA gene was performed using primers TFR1 and TFR2 designed by Felleisen (1997) . The PCR assay was performed in a 100 uL reaction volume using 1x PCR Buffer II, 2.5 units of Taq polymerase, 100 pmol of each primer, 200uM of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 10 g of bovine serum albumin, 6.25 mM MgCl, and 5 L of DNA. DNA amplification was performed under the following thermocycling conditions: 5 min of initial denaturation at 95 \u2022 C, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 \u2022 C for 30-s, annealing at 66 \u2022 C for 30-s and extension at 72 \u2022 C for 90-s, and a final extension at 72 \u2022 C for 15-min.",

Twelve dogs (10 Group A and 2 Group B) resided in a military working dog facility in South Africa. The location of 6 dogs was not recorded and the remaining 20 dogs resided in different geographical locations within the U.S. The dogs were represented by 20 different breeds. German Shepherd Dogs were most common (11 dogs) of which 8 resided in the non-U.S. facility. Age of the dogs ranged from 10 weeks to 10 years (median, 2.0 years). Twenty-one dogs were male (14 intact, 7 castrated) and 15 were female (8 intact, 7 spayed). No differences in breed, age or sex were observed between Group A and Group B dogs. Fecal consistency was recorded in the medical record of 33/36 dogs. All dogs had diarrhea that was variably described as soft, mucoid, hemorrhagic, or watery. Fecal diagnostics results were reported for a subset dogs. A direct examination of feces revealed flagellated protozoa in 17/17 dogs in Group A and 5/8 dogs in Group B. A fecal flotation revealed parasite ova in 3/5 dogs in Group A and 3/8 dogs in Group B that corresponded in identity to Toxocara spp. (2 dogs), Coccidia spp. (3 dogs), and Giardia spp. (3 dogs). Giardia spp. specific antigen test results were positive for 4/5 dogs in Group A and 1/6 dogs in Group B. No differences in recorded fecal diagnostic test results were identified between Group A and Group B dogs. Three dogs from Group B had an active history of underlying primary gastrointestinal disease including histiocytic ulcerative colitis, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, and lymphocytic-plasmacytic enteritis. An underlying primary gastrointestinal disease was not recorded in the medical record of any dogs in Group A.",

It remains unclear which trichomonads are more common in dogs and whether these infections are more or less likely to be accompanied by other possible infectious explanations for diarrhea. The present study examined fecal samples from 38 dogs that were submitted for T. foetus PCR testing. While the reason for sample submission was not clear in every case, where reported 100% of these dogs had diarrhea and 88% had flagellates observed at the time of a direct fecal examination. Among these dogs, 50% had trichomonosis verified by means of PCR amplification of P. hominis or T. foetus rRNA genes from feces. Trichomonal infection in these dogs was attributed to P. hominis far more frequently than to T. foetus. This finding provides objective data to support prior assumptions that most commonly trichomonosis in dogs is due to P. hominis infection. Five dogs in the study had flagellates reportedly observed in feces but were PCR-negative for trichomonadida. Whether these samples contained non-trichomonad flagellates, trichomonads not identified by our PCR assays, or represented false negative test results is unknown. Because our sample population included only dogs that were suspected of having trichomonosis, future prospective studies will be necessary to establish a true prevalence of trichomonosis in dogs with diarrhea.",

Consequently, P. hominis is presumed to be a commensal that may overgrow in the intestinal tract of dogs with other causes for their diarrhea. An additional aim of this study was to examine the occurrence of concurrent gastrointestinal infections in dogs identified with P. hominis infection compared to those dogs in which trichomonosis was not identified. Since we were limited to the testing of fecal DNA from each dog, each sample was tested for a battery of known canine enteropathogens by means of real-time TaqMan \u00ae PCR. There were no obvious differences in the specific identity, percentage of dogs identified with or total number of concurrent enteropathogens between dogs with and without P. hominis infection. These findings would suggest that dogs with P. hominis are as likely as dogs without P. hominis to have a plausible non-trichomonad enteropathogen responsible for their diarrhea. It remains unclear however, if any of the concurrent infectious agents identified on the PCR panel was ultimately responsible for clinical signs of diarrhea in these dogs. In this regard we included a control group of dogs without diarrhea to determine the likelihood that the PCR panel could distinguish between dogs with and without presumably infectious diarrhea. The number of enteropathogens identified in the control dogs was consistently lower than that in the dogs with diarrhea, but interpretation of these findings is unconvincing because of the limited number of samples available. Accordingly, larger numbers of dogs with and without P. hominis infection will be needed to definitively answer the question of disease causation or alternatively, the pathogenic potential of P. hominis could be defined by means of experimental infection studies.",

It is noteworthy that trichomonosis was diagnosed in dogs as old as 10 years of age in the present study. The two dogs identified with T. foetus infection were also adult dogs (2 and 4.5 years of age). We were also surprised at the number of German Shepherd Dogs identified with P. hominis infection in this study although this finding could be easily attributed to overrepresentation by a single facility from which 7/8 of the P. hominis positive German Shepherd Dogs were housed. On the other hand, German Shepherd Dogs have been the subject of at least three independent reports of dogs with trichomonosis and diarrhea where infections were documented in a single dog, a litter of puppies, and a working dog facility respectively (Gookin et al., 2005; Kim et al., 2010; O'Donnell, 1954) . Further investigation of German Shepherd Dogs for a possible breed predisposition to P. hominis infection or shedding of P. hominis secondary to primary gastrointestinal disease appears to be warranted.",
