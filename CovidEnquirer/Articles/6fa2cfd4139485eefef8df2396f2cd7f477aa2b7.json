Ascent to an altitude of 10 000 ft (3000 m) produces a fall in the partial pressure of oxygen in the alveoli, but only a slight fall in the percentage saturation of hemoglobin with oxygen. Once altitude exceeds 10 000 ft (3000 m), however, the percentage saturation of hemoglobin falls quickly, resulting in hypoxia. Indeed, above 8000 ft (2500 m), the effects of lack of oxygen will begin to appear and a decrease in an individual's ability to perform complex tasks and a reduction in night vision can be measured. 1 Figure 46 .1 shows the oxygen dissociation curve of blood. The concentrations of physically dissolved and chemically combined oxygen are shown separately and the curve illustrated is the average for a fit young adult. The actual shape of the curve will be influenced by factors such as age, state of health, tobacco use and ambient temperature.",

However, in the case of the elderly or of individuals suffering from some diseases of the respiratory or circulatory system, there is less tolerance of the mild hypoxia at even this altitude. In an ideal world, the cabin would be pressurized to maintain sea level conditions. To achieve this would require an extremely strong and heavy aircraft structure with severe implications on load carrying capacity, fuel consumption and resulting effects on the external environment. As a result, a compromise has to be struck, and airworthiness regulations (US Federal Aviation Regulations and European Joint Aviation Requirements) state that 'pressurized cabins and compartments to be occupied must be equipped to provide a cabin pressure altitude of not more than 8000 ft (2500 m) at the maximum operating altitude of the aeroplane under normal operating conditions.' 2",

            "text": "Pressurization is achieved by tapping bleed air from the engine compressors and passing this flow of air through the air-conditioning packs into the cabin. The outside air is very dry and cold, and the temperature is controlled via the air-conditioning packs. The cabin pressure is maintained at the desired level by regulating the flow of air overboard. Figure 46 .2 illustrates ambient and cabin altitudes for a typical flight. SECTION As a result of the required cabin pressure change during climb and descent, it is possible for individuals to suffer discomfort as a result of expansion of gas trapped within the body. In particular, gas can be trapped within the gut and within the middle ear and sinuses. Normally, this trapped gas is able to escape without any problem, but there may be occasions when this is not so, such as when the individual is suffering from upper respiratory tract congestion due to infection or allergy. In particular, the human ear is very sensitive to rates of pressure change, the threshold for detection being 0.132 PSI (0.910 kPa). This is equivalent to a change in cabin altitude of 250 ft (76 m) at sea level. In the human ear, the cavity of the middle ear is separated from the outer ear by the tympanic membrane. It communicates with the nasopharynx and, in turn, the atmosphere by way of the eustachian tube, the proximal two-thirds of which has soft walls that are normally collapsed. During ascent to altitude, the gas in the middle ear cavity expands and escapes along the eustachian tube into the nasopharynx, equalizing the pressure across the tympanic membrane. The pharyngeal portion of the eustachian tube acts as a one-way valve, thus allowing expanding air to escape easily to the atmosphere. This can be sometimes felt as a 'popping' sensation as air escapes from the tube during ascent.",

In some individuals, the one-way valve mechanism of the eustachian tube can prevent passive flow of air back into the middle ear cavity. This causes a relative increase of pressure on the outside of the tympanic membrane, pushing it into the middle ear cavity and causing a sensation of fullness, a decrease in hearing acuity and eventually pain. It is possible to perform active maneuvers to open the eustachian tube, such as swallowing, yawning, and jaw movements. In some people, these simple maneuvers are not effective and it may be necessary to occlude the nostrils and raise the pressure in the mouth and nose to force air into the middle ear cavities. This increase in pressure can usually simply be achieved by raising the floor of the mouth with the glottis shut, while other individuals raise the pressure in the lungs and the respiratory tract by contracting the expiratory muscles while forcibly exhaling (Valsalva's maneuver).",

This requirement is facilitated by the practice of recirculation of approximately 50% of the cabin air. This is achieved by extracting air from the cabin and mixing it with conditioned outside air. Recirculation provides two benefits: one, it allows the total airflow rate to be higher than the flow rate of the outside air, so good circulation in the cabin can be maintained independently of the outside airflow; and two, the conditioned air is mixed with comparatively warm recirculated air before being introduced into the cabin. As a result, the conditioned air is supplied at a much lower temperature without causing discomfort from cold drafts. The recirculated air will also have picked up moisture from the cabin occupants and the cabin activities, improving the humidity level. In older generation jet aircraft, all the air supplied to the cabin came from outside air, without the benefits of recirculation (improved humidity, reduction in perceived drafts). This practice was inefficient with a substantial energy, and hence environmental, cost.",

These are high efficiency particulate (HEPA) filters, which have an efficiency of 99.97% for 0.3 \u03bcm particles. They are effective in removing bacteria and viruses from the recirculated air, so preventing their spread through the cabin by this route. Air filters are changed during routine aircraft maintenance, as specified by the manufacturer in the servicing schedule. Recirculated air is obtained from the area above the cabin or under the floor; air from the cargo bay, lavatories and galleys is not recirculated. The flow rate of outside air per seat ranges from 3.6 to 7.4 L/s (7.6-15.6 cubic ft/min) with the percentage of recirculated air distributed to the passenger cabin being of the order 30-55% of the total air supply. 3 The result of filtering the recirculated air is a significant improvement in cabin air quality by the removal of particles and biological microorganisms. It is not necessary to pass the compressed air from outside through HEPA filters, because the ambient air at high altitude is free of microorganisms and particulates.",

            "text": "At a typical aircraft cruising altitude of 30 000 ft (9150 m), the outside air temperature is in the region of \u221240\u00b0C and is extremely dry, typically containing about 0.15 g/kg of moisture. For pressurized aircraft flying at these levels, the conditioned air entering the cabin has a relative humidity of <1%. Exhaled moisture from passengers and crew, together with moisture from galleys and toilet areas, increases the humidity to an average level of 6-10%, which is below the 20% normally accepted as comfort level. 4 Research has shown that the maximum additional water lost from an individual during an 8-h period in 0% humidity, compared with normal day-to-day loss, is around 100 mL. The sensation of thirst experienced by healthy individuals in the low humidity environment is due to local drying of the pharyngeal membranes, and this itself may lead to the spurious sensation of thirst. There is no evidence that exposure to a low-humidity environment itself leads to dehydration, although local humidity can cause mild subjective symptoms, such as dryness of the eyes and mucous membranes. 5, 6 No significant effect has been shown on reaction time or other measures of psychomotor performance, although there can be some changes in the fluid regulatory hormones. 5, 6 It is unlikely that low humidity has any long-or short-term ill-effects, provided overall hydration is maintained by drinking adequate amounts of fluid. 7 The body's homeostatic mechanisms ensure that central hydration is maintained, although the peripheral physical effects can lead to discomfort. Dry skin can be alleviated by using moisturizing aqueous creams, particularly just before flight, and dry eye irritation can be alleviated by the use of moisturizing eye drops. Individuals prone to develop dry eyes are advised not to wear contact lenses during long flights in pressurized aircraft. 8 A National Academy of Sciences report identified humidity as one of the areas deserving more attention in future research concerning aircraft cabin environment. 9 The aircraft cabin is similar to many other indoor environments, such as homes and offices, in that people are exposed to a mixture of external and recirculated air. The cabin environment is different in many respects (e.g. the high occupant density, the inability of the occupants to leave at will and the need for pressurization). In flight, there is a combination of environmental factors including low air pressure and low humidity, as well as low frequency vibration and constant background noise. Although the noise and vibration can contribute to fatigue, the levels are all below those which are accepted as potentially harmful to hearing. 9,10 OZONE Ozone is a highly reactive form of oxygen found naturally in the upper atmosphere. It is formed primarily above the tropopause as a result of the action of UV light on oxygen molecules. The amount and distribution of natural ozone in the atmosphere varies with latitude, altitude, season and weather conditions. The highest concentrations in the northern hemisphere are generally found at high altitude over high latitude locations during the winter and spring.",

Droplet transmission may occur whenever a person coughs, sneezes, or talks. 14 Droplets are relatively large particles (>5 \u03bcm) that can travel only a short distance through the air; they do not remain suspended. Infection occurs when microorganisms within the droplets come into contact with the conjunctivae, nasal mucosa, or mouth of a susceptible person. In air-borne transmission, smaller respiratory particles (\u22645 \u03bcm), called droplet nuclei, are inhaled by a susceptible host. These particles remain suspended in air indefinitely and may spread over long distances, depending on environmental factors. 14 Humans are the most important reservoirs of infectious agents on aircraft. Most microorganisms that have been isolated from occupied spaces, including aircraft cabins, are human in source, including bacteria that have been shed from exposed skin and scalp, as well as from the nose and mouth. 9 These microorganisms are typically part of the normal human flora and very rarely cause infections.

TB is transmitted by the inhalation of droplet nuclei (air-borne transmission). Two of six investigations conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) between 1992 and 1995 have indicated that the transmission of TB from a symptomatic person to other passengers or crew members does occur during air travel. 21, 22 In one investigation, a flight attendant was diagnosed with cavitary pulmonary tuberculosis in November, 1992. Of the 212 flight crew who worked with this flight attendant between August and October, 1992, 25.6% had a positive tuberculin skin test (TST) result. Two of these contacts had documented conversion of TST status. TST positivity and conversion was associated with a cumulative flight-time exposure of 12 h or more. In the second investigation, a foreign-born passenger developed symptomatic pulmonary tuberculosis while visiting friends in the USA. She traveled from Baltimore, Maryland to Chicago, Illinois (2 h flight) and then from Chicago to Honolulu, Hawaii (8 h and 38 min flight). Three of the 113 passengers on the Baltimore to Chicago flight had a positive TST, two were foreign-born. Fifteen of the 257 passengers on the flight from Chicago to Honolulu had a positive TST. Four of these passengers converted their TST. In both investigations, all of the new infections were latent TB infection; none developed active tuberculosis.",

From 1996 to 2000, 63 of the 207 cases of imported measles into the USA developed a rash directly before or on the day of air travel. From these imported cases, only one documented case of in-flight transmission was reported. 32 Despite the risk, few cases of measles occur as a direct result of inflight exposure. 32, 33 Amornkul and colleagues investigated the extent of measles transmission aboard an international commercial flight after exposure to an infected passenger. 32 Of the 276 potentially exposed passengers, 82% completed a follow-up questionnaire, including 29 passengers who reported close contact with the ill passenger before, during, or after the flight. None of the contacted passengers reported symptoms consistent with measles.",

From investigations of disease outbreaks associated with air travel, two main risk factors for the spread of communicable diseases have been identified: flight duration (>8 h, including ground time) and seating proximity to the source. There is no evidence that the pressurized cabin itself makes transmission of disease any more likely. Once the aircraft doors are closed, airconditioning is provided from the auxiliary power unit until it can be supplied from the aircraft engines, thus ensuring the filtration benefits of air recirculation. There does appear to be increased risk of disease spread when the aircraft ventilation system is inoperable.",

It may or may not involve the use of medical equipment or drugs, and may or may not involve a request for assistance from a medical professional traveling as a passenger on the flight. It can be something as simple as a headache, or a vaso-vagal episode, or something major, such as a myocardial infarction or impending childbirth. The incidence is comparatively low, although the media impact of an event can be significant. One major international airline recently reported 3022 incidents occurring in something over 34 million passengers carried in 1 year. The breakdown of these incidents into generalized causes is shown in Table 46 .2. 39, 40 The top six in-flight emergency medical conditions reported by the same airline are shown in Table 46 .3. 39, 40 Any acute medical condition occurring during the course of a flight can be alarming for the passenger and crew because of the remoteness of the environment. Cabin crew members receive training in advanced first aid and basic life support and the use of the emergency medical equipment carried on board the aircraft. Many airlines give training in excess of the regulatory requirement, particularly when an extended range of medical equipment is carried.",

Some airlines maintain a worldwide database of medical facilities available at or near the major airports; others subscribe to a third party provider giving access to immediate medical advice and assistance with arranging emergency medical care for the sick passenger at the diversion airport. The link from the aircraft is made using either radio-telephone voice or datalink (VHF or ACARS), high-frequency radio communication (HF) or a satellite communication system (Satcom). Satcom is installed in newer, long-range aircraft, and is gradually replacing HF as the industry norm for long-range communication. The advantage is that Satcom is unaffected by terrain, topography or atmospheric conditions, and allows good transmission of voice and data from over any point on the globe. Digitization and telephone transmission of physiological parameters is a well established practice, particularly in remote areas of the world. An aircraft cabin at 37 000 ft (11 500 m) can be considered a remote location in terms of availability of medical support, and the digital technology used in Satcom is similar to that used in modern ground-to-ground communication. The advent of Satcom has enabled the development of air-to-ground transmission to assist in diagnosis. Pulse oximetry and ECG are examples of data that can assist the medical advisor to give appropriate advice to the aircraft captain, although the cost/benefit analysis has to be weighed very carefully. 40",

Recirculating the air has the advantage of reducing cold draughts and increasing the humidity \u25aa In modern aircraft, all the recirculated air is passed through high-efficiency particulate filters which remove >99% of particles, including bacteria and viruses \u25aa There is an extremely low probability of airline passengers or crew suffering any abnormality or disease as a result of exposure to cosmic radiation. The passenger cabin of a commercial airliner is designed to carry the maximum number of passengers in safety and comfort, within the constraints of cost-effectiveness. It is incompatible with providing the facilities of an ambulance, an emergency room, an intensive care unit, a delivery suite, or a mortuary.",
