            "text": "Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine, Virginia Tech, Blacksburg, VA 24061, U.S.A. (Accepted 5 September 1989) The temporal manifestation of bovine parainfluenza-3 virus (BPDV) proteins in the cytoplasm and on the surface of bovine embryonic lung (BEL) cells was characterized by indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) and hemadsorption (HAd) assays. Intracellular proteins appeared earliest at 0.5 h post inoculation (p.i.) and the infection spread to virtually all cells by 48 h p.i. Viral proteins on the surface of cells were seen first at 16 h p.i., and by 48 h p.i. the entire cell monolayer was IFA positive. Hundred-fold less virus in the inoculum delayed appearance of the intracellular as well as cell-surface viral proteins by 24 h and allowed the infection of only about l/3 of the cells by 48 h p.i. Kinetics of the development in the proportion of I&Ad-positive cells correlated with those of the surface fluorescence-positive cells. Morphology of the manifestation of BPI3V proteins is characterized by microphotography. Thomson, 1975a) , calf testicle (Gratzek et al., 1967) , Madin Darby Bovine Kidney (Crandell and Michuda, 1972; Tsai and Thomson, 1975a) and most frequently in bovine embryonic kidney cells (Hamdy, 1965; Frank, 1970; Tsai and Thomson, 1975a; Fernandez et al., 1981) . However, little information is available about the behavior of BPI3V in in vitro culture of bovine lung cells. Bovine embryonic lung cells were used to titrate the infectivity of BPI3V samples in a study of the aerosol stability of the virus (Elazhary and Derbyshire, 1979) . Hemadsorption and bacterial adsorption to BPI3V-inoculated bovine embryonic lung (BEL) cells was also studied (Toth and Gates, 1981) . The purpose of the present study was to characterize the kinetics of the expression, the morphology and location of BPI3V proteins in the cytoplasm and on the surface of BEL cells by fluorescence microscopy, and to correlate hemadsorption of guinea pig erythrocytes (GPE) with cell-surface fluorescence.",

            "text": "The post inoculation time at which we have seen the first intracellular BPDV proteins corresponds with the results of Portner and Russel (1973) with measles virus, but precedes by about 8 h the first demonstration of intracellular measles virus by Norrby (1972) and by about 16 h the first appearance of intracellular bovine respiratory syncytial virus proteins (Rossi and Kiesel, 1977) . Our results agree with those of Tsai and Thomson (1975a) who used fluorescence microscopy to demonstrate intracytoplasmic inclusions, as small granules, surrounding the nuclei in more than 90% of BPI3V-inoculated bovine embryonic kidney and spleen cultures 2 days p.i. As they have not tested the kinetics of the appearance of BPDV prior to 2 days p.i. we do not know how our results would have related to theirs in earlier times of virus replication. In our study lOO-fold lower BPI3V inoculum resulted in a 24 h delay in the appearance of detectable intracellular viral proteins. Proteins of the BPDV appeared 16 h later on the surface than in the cytoplasm of the cells. This agrees with the results of Norrby (1972) with measles virus membrane associated proteins and demonstrates the period necessary for the BPI3V envelope proteins to be inserted'into the cell membrane. While the proportion of cells positive for intracellular FA increased within 22 h from 5% at 2 h p.i. to 55% at 24 h p.i., the proportion of surface FA positive cells increased within 24 h from ~1% only to 35% (Table 1 ). This suggests that the rate of the insertion of the BPI3V proteins into cell-membranes lagged somewhat behind the rate of the appearance of the intracellular BPI3V proteins. One of the viral proteins on the surface of the cells, the hemagglutinin, is involved in binding red blood cells to the surface of the infected cells (Kahrs, 1981; Toth and Gates, 1981) . The kinetics of the adherence of the GPEs to the BEL cells inoculated with the 2 different doses of BPDV correlated closely with the kinetics of the appearance of the IFA positive cell-surface BPI3V antigens (Table 1 ). This finding indicates that the BPI3V hyperimmune serum has recognized BPI3V hemagglutinin on the surface of inoculated cells.",

We have seen granules, presumably also viral nucleocapsids, relatively early, e.g. 4 and 8 h p.i.",
