This airflow obstruction is generally progressive, may be accompanied by airway hyperreactivity, and often is partially re~ersible.~ Declining lung function is almost universally caused by decades of tobacco smoke exposure and develops insidiously so that patients often do not complain of exertional dyspnea until their 1-second forced expiratory volume (FEV,) is between 40% and 59% of its predicted value.20 When the FEV, falls below 1 L, patients are disabled in the activities of daily living and have a 5-year survival of approximately 50?!0. Forced expiratory volume in 1 second declines by about 30 mL/year in healthy nonsmokers, whereas the average decline is approximately 45 mL/year in smokers.20 Approximately 15% of smokers are susceptible to the airway effects of smoking and will develop COPD. These patients show accelerated rates of decline in FEV, of between 50 and 90 m L /~e a r .~~ In 1994, approximately 16 million Americans suffered from COPD, an estimated increase of 60% since 1982.'j It ranks fourth among leading causes of death in North America and is the only leading cause of death that is rising in prevalence.'j, 28 According to 1993 estimates made by the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute, the annual total cost arising from COPD was nearly $24 billion dollars. This amount includes almost $15 billion in direct health care expenditures, nearly $5 billion in indirect morbidity costs, and $4.5 billion in indirect mortality costs. 6 Periods of relative clinical stability during the course of COPD are interrupted by recurrent exacerbations. The definition of an acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD) is imprecise but is generally considered clinically as an episode of increased dyspnea, sputum production, and sputum purulence in a patient with COPD.\" When these symptoms are severe and accompanied by significant hypoxemia or hypercapnia, patients may require hospitalization. This article focuses primarily on the management of hospitalized patients with AE-COPD outside of the intensive care unit and reviews the evidence supporting the available therapies for COPD exacerbations.",

The source of bacterial infection during a COPD exacerbation may be endogenous or exogenous. In a small group of patients followed for 3 years, exacerbations coincided with reinfection by strains of H. influenzae having either the same (i.e., endogenous) or different (i.e., exogenous) DNA fingerprint.

Positive serology was found in 31 patients (34%), of whom 26 patients (28%) had viral infections. The most common organism was influenza A, with 18 patients demonstrating positive serology (20%). Five patients had positive serology for Legionella, whereas no evidence was found for infections caused by Mycoplasma or Chlamydia.48 Gump et a155 observed 25 patients every 2 weeks for 4 years and documented 116 exacerbations. They derived a striking correlation of infection with exacerbations by interpreting their data in a time-weighted analysis. They found that the incidence of infection was 3L\"/o per patient week of exacerbation but only 0.9% ver patient week in remission. In their 5-year aniiysis, Buscho et alZ5 found that 25% of exacerbations were associated with viral infection. This rate was twice that of viral infections during remission detected as an asymptomatic fourfold rise in antiviral antibody titers. In the largest study, Smith et aP3 followed 150 patients over 8 years and analyzed more than 1000 acute respiratory illnesses. They associated nonbacterial infections with approximately 20% of acute respiratory illnesses but only 6% of illnessfree periods. In contrast with the work by Buscho and Gump, Smith et noted a high rate of rhinoviral infection. Uncontrolled studies by McNamara and Eadie4,, 75 also reported rhinoviral infections to be associated with COPD exacerbations in 43% and 20% of cases, respectively. Common colds may have a deleterious effect upon lung functionz9 and patients with COPD are more likely to develop increased cough and lower respiratory tract symptoms during rhinoviral infections than healthy 113 Smith et aPz performed a 7-year observational study of 120 patients to assess potential interactions between viral, mycoplasmal, and bacterial infections in patients with COPD. They calculated the ratio of number of observed exacerbations to number of expected viral or bacterial associations. Haemophilus influenzae and S. pneumoniae were isolated more than twice as often as expected following influenza virus infection. Marked rises in titers of antibodies against H. influenzae were associated with preceding viral or Mycoplasma infections, suggesting that viral infection promotes increased invasiveness of H. influenzae and subsequent infection. There are no other rigorously performed clinical studies of the interaction between viral and bacterial infections in AECOPD. Although the concept that viruses promote secondary bacterial infection seems biologically plausible and is supported by animal research, it remains unknown how often bacterial infection in AECOPD follows an inciting viral infection.",

The drive to breathe therefore remained very high in spite of oxygen treatment. In a later study by the same authors,I3 patients with COPD and acute respiratory failure received 100% 0, for 15 minutes to abolish hypoxic drive. Minute ventilation fell by only 7% and could not account for the entire increase in Paco,.

More recent work by Dunn et a139 and Stradling119 has challenged Aubier's conclusions and defended the traditional concept that hypoventilation, rather than V / Q mismatching, is to blame for 0,-induced hypercarbia. One further mechanism that appears to contribute, albeit to a minor extent, is the Haldane effect, whereby CO, is displaced from hemoglobin by 0, causing a rise in P~c o , .~~~ Nevertheless, the risks for acute hypoxemia far outweigh the risks for severe hypercarbia.

Rarely, overzealous 0, administration produces progressive hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis.2o, 34, 74 For this reason, response to 0, must be assessed according to arterial blood gas and pH measurements. These should be obtained at baseline and within 60 minutes of starting or changing the 0, concentration. If Pao, remains intractably low or the pH drops as a result of increasing Paco, alternate strategies to improve hypoxemia and respiratory acidosis must be devised. These include maximizing bronchodilation and the use of assisted ventilation.",

Exacerbations were classified according to severity. Type 1 (the most severe) was defined as an increase in dyspnea, sputum volume, and sputum purulence. Type 2 involved the presence of only two of the three symptoms, and type 3 was defined as the presence of one of the three symptoms in addition to one other finding (sore throat, rhinorrhea, fever, increased wheeze, or increased cough). Compared with placebo, antibiotics shortened the duration of exacerbations by about 2 days and accelerated recovery of peak expiratory flow rate ( P < 0.02 for both). Treatment success, defined as resolution of symptoms within 21 days, occurred in 55% of the placebo group and 68.1% of patients receiving active treatment (P < 0.05).

A clinician therefore would need to treat roughly eight exacerbations with antibiotics to achieve one treatment success beyond chance, or two in order to avoid a single deterioration. The authors concluded that avoidance of deleterious outcomes is the strongest reason to offer antibiotics to patients with AE-COPD. Furthermore, they stated that antibiotics are clearly indicated in type 1 exacerbations, of no benefit in type 3 exacerbations, and probably justifiable for patients with type 2 presentations.\" Similar findings were reported in another largescale, randomized trial comparing amoxicillin / clavulanate to placebo? , Saint and associate^'^^ systematically reviewed the clinical efficacy of antibiotics for AECOPD.

From the six trials that reported peak expiratory flow rates, an overall improvement of 10.75 liters per minute favoring the antibiotic group was noted.

Although the acquisition cost of newer antibiotics (cephalosporins, macrolides and fluoroquinolones) was higher, the overall costs of the treated patients given these drugs were lower. In particular, the group receiving amoxicillin/ clavulanate, azithromycin, or ciprofloxacin had the lowest hospitalization rate, clinical failure rate, and costs compared with cephalosporins or first-line therapy. The hypothesis that aggressive antibiotic therapy should be offered to high-risk patients was tested in a recent, prospective, health economic study.= Patients with at least three treated exacerbations of chronic bronchitis in the past year were randomized to receive either ciprofloxacin or any nonquinolone-based therapy for their next acute exacerbation. Clinical endpoints (days of illness, hospitalizations, time to next exacerbation) were blended with quality-of-life measurements (Nottingham Health Profile, St. George's Hospital Respiratory Questionnaire, Health Utility Index), and total respiratory costs from a societal perspective. Although the overall results indicated no advantage for either treatment arm, in patients with risk factors (severe underlying lung disease, more than four exacerbations per year, duration of bronchitis greater than 10 years, elderly, significant comorbid illness) the use of ciprofloxacin led to improved clinical outcome, higher quality of life, and fewer costs. The results of this study would suggest that aggressive antimicrobial therapy directed especially toward resistant organisms in high-risk patients is a more effective strategy than no therapy or therapy with older antimicrobials that would not be effective against the usual target organisms, particularly P-lactamase-producing H. influenzae.",

The dose of methylprednisolone was high (125 mg every 6 hours for 3 days) and resulted in significantly more hyperglycemia and, possibly, increased secondary infection rates.'06 In summary, the evidence from randomized, controlled trials supports the conclusion that among patients with acute exacerbations, oral or intravenous corticosteroids significantly increase the FEV, for up to 72 hours and likely reduce the risk for treatment failure. There is no proved benefit for treatment longer than 2 weeks. Hyperglycemia is the most common short-term complication of steroid treatment. As further studies become available, it will be possible to better understand the risk-benefit ratio for corticosteroids and, through meta-analysis, to better define the optimum dose and duration of therapy.136 It is also important to investigate the long-term risk for adverse effects of intermittent corticosteroids in patients who require them for recurrent exacerbations over many years time.",

Malnutrition impairs muscle function by reducing the availability of energy substrates such as glycogen and phosphate and by altering the structure of muscle fibers. When combined with intercurrent airway infection and the mechanical disadvantage of the diaphragm in COPD, malnutrition may have a profound effect on respiratory muscle mechanics. Experimental evidence for blunted hypoxic drive in response to semistarvation suggests another mechanism by which patients with COPD may be predisposed to respiratory failure.91, 133 No randomized, controlled trial has demonstrated reduced morbidity and mortality as a result of nutritional support during acute respiratory failure. Nevertheless, clinicians should be able to identify malnourished patients and understand the goals of nutritional therapy. Particular attention should be paid to patients with hypercatabolic states that increase the risk for protein-calorie malnutrition. The Subjective Global Assessment and the Harris-Benedict equation are two valid clinical instruments for assessing malnutrition and planning nutritional therapy. They are reviewed elsewhere?\" 91 In general, the goals of nutritional supplementation among patients with acute respiratory failure consist of maintaining body weight and preventing protein breakdown. The effects of malnutrition and nutritional supplementation in patients with COPD are discussed in more detail in the article by Schols and Wouters in this issue.",

Current outcomes appear to be better than those of the past, in part because of the widespread use of controlled Oz therapy, corticosteroids and IB, availability of better p,-agonists, reduced use of methylxanthines, and increased use of noninvasive ventilatory support.j3 Indeed, there is evidence to support a trend toward improved survival for hypercapnic respiratory failure over the past 20 years. The mortality rates in studies of survival of acute respiratory failure in COPD conducted from 1968 to 1973 ranged from 22% to 34%, with an overall mortality of 26%.

Baseline FEV, was not available for most patients. Half the patients required intensive care unit admission and 35% required mechanical ventilation. Hospital mortality was 11%. More striking, however, was the finding that following discharge, one third of the patients died in within 6 months and one half within 2 years. Not surprisingly, patients who survived hospitalization had a substantial risk of discharge to a facility other than their home (20%) and of readmission to acute care over the ensuing 6 months (50%). Higher acute physiology score (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation; APACHE 111), older age, and poor functional status prior to admission independently increased risk of death. Improved survival was of 10%.132 predicted by greater BMI and albumin level, higher Paoz / Fio, and, surprisingly, the presence of cor pulmonale and congestive heart failure as the cause of the exacerbation. The latter findings may be explained by the good response of these two disorders to acute therapy. also supports the finding that host factors are principal determinants of outcomes of AECOPD. In their retrospective analysis of 232 exacerbations in 107 patients with COPD, severity of airflow obstruction, use of home 0, frequency of exacerbation, history of previous pneumonia or sinusitis, and use of maintenance corticosteroids each were independently associated with treatment failure. Surprisingly, age, choice of antibiotics, and presence of comorbid conditions did not affect the treatment outcome in that study.",

In contrast, Menzies et a17* reported that, among their 95 patients, higher baseline FEV, and serum albumin were significantly associated with improved 1-year survival following mechanical ventilation.

They observed episodes of acute respiratory failure in 19 and 33 patients with baseline FEV, of greater and less than 1 L respectively. Only 56% of the cohort with severe COPD survived weaning and spontaneous breathing for 72 hours. Furthermore, in the same group, 1-year survival was only 27%. Absence of infiltrates on chest radiograph was the most influential predictor of survival in patients with severe COPD. Pneumonia accounted for most of the infiltrates that were seen in this group. Baseline FEV, obtained during a period of clinical stability prior to the episode of acute respiratory failure was available for all patients. The extent of baseline obstruction alone was not statistically correlated with short-term survival in either group, but the combination of severe baseline obstruction and pulmonary infiltrates markedly increased the risk for death.

They analyzed 362 admissions for acute COPD exacerbation from the APACHE I11 database. Hospital mortality was 24%. For patients aged 65 and older, hospital and 1-year mortality rates were 30% and 59% respectively. Their report emphasizes that individual clinical variables have different value for predicting short-and long-term survival. Patient age, for example, was a statistically significant determinant of 6-month survival but not influential for hospital mortality after accounting for nonrespiratory organ dysfunction. Similarly, the presence of hypercarbia was of no value in predicting hospital mortality but became important over the long term; 1-year mortality rates for patients with admission Paco2 of less than 50 mm Hg versus greater than 50 mm Hg were 54% and 70% respectively. The most significant predictors of short and long-term mortality are development and severity of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Respiratory dysfunction is more important over the longer term. As the authors state: \"In most cases, the acute, life-threatening components of the exacerbations can be reversed and short-term death avoided by mechanical ventilation and other appropriate treatments. However, because abnormalities in respiratory physiology reflect underlying severity of lung disease, patients with greater abnormality who survive hospitalization are at greater risk of subsequent death.\"Io7",

The medical and economic costs arising from acute exacerbations of COPD are therefore expected to increase over the coming years. Although exacerbations may be initiated by multiple factors, the most common identifiable associations are with bacterial and viral infections. These are associated with approximately 50% to 70% and 20% to 30% of COPD exacerbations, respectively. In addition to smoking cessation, annual influenza vaccination is the most important method for preventing exacerbations. Controlled O2 is the most important intervention for patients with acute hypoxic respiratory failue. Evidence from randomized, controlled trials justifies the use of corticosteroids, bronchodilators (but not theophylline), noninvasive positive-pressure ventilation (in selected patients), and antibiotics, particularly for severe exacerbations. Antibiotics should be chosen according to the patient's risk for treatment failure and the potential for antibiotic resistance. In the acute setting, combined treatment with P-agonist and anticholinergic bronchodilators is reasonable but not supported by randomized controlled studies. Physicians should identify and, when possible, correct malnutrition. Chest physiotherapy has no proven role in the management of acute exacerbations. ",

If symptoms persist for longer than 1 week, a macrolide or tetracycline is suggested to treat suspected pathogenic organisms (i.e. M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae). Group 2 patients have simple chronic bronchitis with minimally impaired lung function and no additional risk factors for treatment failure. In these patients, amoxicillin, tetracycline, or trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole are the proposed first-line agents because the consequences of treatment failure in this group are generally few.\" Probable pathogens are H. influenzae, M. catarrhalis, and S. pneumoniae. Group 3 patients have moderate to severe COPD and other risk factors for treatment failure, such as frequent exacerbations and comorbid conditions, including congestive heart failure, diabetes mellitus, chronic renal insufficiency, or chronic liver disease. The probable bacterial pathogens are similar to those in group 2, although gram-negative organisms are more likely in patients with severely impaired lung function. Because the costs of treatment failure are high in this group, and because P-lactamase-producing strains of H. influenzae and M . catarrhalis are increasingly prevalent, fluoroquinolones are the suggested firstline treatment. Group 4 patients have chronic suppurative lung disease, particularly bronchiectasis.",
