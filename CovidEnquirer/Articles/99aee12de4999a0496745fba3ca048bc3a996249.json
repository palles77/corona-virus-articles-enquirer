The aerial part of Strobilanthes cusia (Nees) Kuntze (Acanthaceae) recorded in Taiwan Herbal Pharmacopeia is the one of candidate materials that have been used to manufacture Qing Dai (Lee et al., 2019; Lin, 2016) . The crude extracts and pure phytochemicals of S. cusia leave (Da-Ching-Yeh or Nan-Ban-Lan-Yeh) and root (Na-Ban-Lan-Gen) showed many pharmacological properties, including anti-viral (anti-herpes simplex virus type-1, anti-influenza A virus), anti-severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), antifungal, anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive, and antipyretic effects (Feng et al., 2016; Gu et al., 2015; Ho et al., 2003; Honda and Tabata, 1979; Tanaka et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2017) . To date many secondary metabolites, such as alkaloids, terpenoids, flavonoids, sterols, lignans, phenylethanoids, and isocoumarin have been isolated from this species (Feng et al., 2016; Gu et al., 2015; Honda and Tabata, 1979; Tanaka et al., 2004; Zhou et al., 2017) . However, interleukin 17 (IL-17) inhibitions of S. cusia and its processed drug, Qing Dai are not known. Qing Dai could provide a highly effective approach for not only psoriasis (topical use), but inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) (oral use) in modern clinical therapy (Lee et al., 2019; Sugimoto et al., 2016) . In addition, Qing Dai ointment could significantly reverse the IL-17A gene expression in psoriatic skin lesions in our previous studies (Cheng et al., 2017) . Therefore, Qing Dai and its anti-IL-17 components are interesting for us and this TCM is needed to clarify the active phytochemicals for further clinical application. Our previous investigation indicated that indole alkaloids could contribute to anti-IL-17 properties of Qing Dai that was prepared from the aerial parts of S. cusia (Lee et al., 2019) . Continuing studies on bioactive constituents of Qing Dai resulted in isolation of two compounds; besides, their IL-17 inhibitory effects and possible biogenetic pathways of active components were also discussed within.",
