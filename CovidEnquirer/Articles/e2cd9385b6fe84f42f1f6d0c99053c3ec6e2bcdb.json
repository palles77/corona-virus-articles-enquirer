The effect of NO upon protease activity was determined by adding et al., 1997). Although proteins capable of being nitrosylated at a cysteine residue contain a consensus nitrosy-NO donors and luciferase to either wild-type or mutant protease. NO reduces wild-type 3C pro activity, and DTT lation motif, the 3C pro lacks this sequence (Stamler et al., 1997). Coxsackievirus may have a selective advantage if restores wild-type protease activity (Figure 6). However, such as members of the Picornavirus family and the Coronavirus family (Mannick, 1995; Reiss and Komatsu, 1998). In contrast, NO does not inhibit the replication of some viruses that encode serine proteases, such as alphaviruses. However, NO also inhibits the replication of some viruses that do not encode cysteine proteases, implying that there exist other viral targets of NO. For example, the EBV transcription factor Zta and ribonucleotide reductase may be targets of NO (Mannick et al., 1994; Melkova and Esteban, 1995). Nonetheless, to our knowledge there are no viruses that have cysteine proteases that are resistant to NO.
