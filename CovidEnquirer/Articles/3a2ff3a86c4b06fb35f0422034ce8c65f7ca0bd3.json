However, recent studies on the ecology of influenza viruses in avian species has shown that many more influenza viruses have been isolated from cloa-cal samples than from the, respiratory tract Shortridge et al ., 1977) . The question arises as to the site of replication of these influenza viruses, and whether the biological and biochemical properties of the viruses would permit physical contact between feral avian species and mammalian species. Since many influenza A viruses have been isolated from the cloaca of ducks, the site of replication of these viruses was studied. The present report shows that A/ duck/Memphis/546/74 influenza virus replicates in both the respiratory tract and in the lower intestinal tract of ducks and is shed in high concentration in the feces. In contrast, human influenza A viruses replicated in the respiratory tract of ducks but not in the intestinal tract. The temperature and pH stability of the duck and human strains of influenza viruses were compared in an attempt to elucidate the properties of the duck strain that would permit replication in the lower intestinal tract of ducks.

Groups of four mallard ducks were inoculated both orally and intratracheally with 0.5 ml of allantoic fluid containing A/duck/Memphis/546/ 74 influenza virus. Each duck received lo7 EID,, of virus. At hourly intervals for 12 hr after infection and twice during the first day after infection, blood samples were drawn by syringe from the wing vein. Tracheal and cloacal samples were collected into 1 .O ml of buffered glycerol saline (Hinshaw et al., 1977) at the above time intervals. The samples were collected with dacron swabs, if cloaca1 swabs were not stained with fecal material the swabs were inserted into the rectum. On the second day after infection, and at daily intervals thereafter, one duck was exsanguinated and samples of the organs were collected aseptically for virus titrations. The pH of the gizzard cavity was measured by inserting an electrode directly into the organ immediately after exsanguination. The organs were ground in a mortar with powdered glass to give a 10% suspension with antibiotics and saline (Hinshaw et al., 1977) . The samples were tested undilute for viral infectivity in 11-day-old embryonated eggs, and were stored at -70\". Samples that contained virus were titrated to determine the EIQ,, and the agents recovered were identified with specific antiserum to duck/Memphis to verify that the virus isolated was the one inoculated. For inoculation directly into the crop or rectum of ducks, the virus was put into gelatin capsules (0.2 ml per capsule lo7 EIQ,,) and inserted by plastic tube into the crop or 15 cm into the rectum. anterior to the caecal junction, and of the large intestine (from the caecal junction to rectum) were studied.

The present studies show that duck/Memphis/ 546/74 influenza virus was relatively stable at pH 4.0, whereas the human strains tested were destroyed at this pH. The relative stability of this virus probably permits these strains to pass through the digestive tract of the duck. Even though the pH of the gizzard of ducks can be as low as 2.9 (a pH that will inactivate duck influenza viruses), the rapid passage of virus mixed with food through the digestive tract must permit at least a proportion of the virus from being exposed to the low pH and bile salts. Thus in the above studies, when high doses of duck/Memphis/74 influenza virus or of human influenza viruses were fed to ducks, residual infectivity was detected 1 hr later in fecal samples from birds infected with the duck influenza virus but the human strains failed to transit the digestive tract.",
