Analogously, two esters of Cidofovir [(S)-HPMPC] bearing a hexaethyleneglycol moiety were prepared. The activity of the prodrugs was evaluated in vitro against different virus families. A loss in the antiviral activities of the hydroxylated decyl or decyloxyethyl esters and hexaethyleneglycol esters of PMEA against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and herpesviruses [including herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV), and human cytomegalovirus (CMV)] occurred in comparison with the parent compound. On the other hand, the (5-methyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxolen-4-yl)methyl ester of PMEA showed significant activities against HIV and herpesviruses. (S)-HPMPC prodrugs exhibited anti-cytomegalovirus activities in the same range as the parent drug, whereas the anti-HSV and anti-VZV activities were one-to seven-fold lower than that of Cidofovir.",

Their development has resulted in three approved drugs, and research on ANPs continues to provide new active compounds. 1, 2 The presence of the phosphonate group is responsible for their ionic character when subjected to physiological pH. The ionized molecule is not easily permeable through the gastrointestinal wall and biological membranes. In order to achieve better oral bioavailability, the phosphonate group of the drug can be transformed to a phosphonic ester or amidate, which is enzymatically cleaved to the parent drug after passing the intestinal barrier, or later inside the cells. A considerable number of ANP prodrugs have been evaluated, but only a few of them passed the preclinical studies. This likely arises from the complexity in achieving the right balance between the suitable chemical, physical, and pharmacological prodrug properties.",

PMEA has demonstrated a broad spectrum of antiviral activity 1 against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and other retroviruses and is active against various DNA viruses, including the hepatitis B virus and seventeen herpesviruses. The bis(pivaoyl-oxymethyl)ester of PMEA [Adefovir Dipivoxyl, bis(POM)-PMEA] ( Fig. 1 ) has been approved as an oral prodrug for the treatment of hepatitis B. The orally administered prodrug is absorbed and then cleaved by carboxyesterases in the serum generating pivalate and formaldehyde as its byproducts. Formaldehyde is the significant contributor to the overall cytotoxic effects of the prodrug. 3 Another masking group of the pharmacochemistry of antibiotics-the dioxolenone unit-has been previously utilized to mask the carboxylic function analogously to the pivaoyloxymethyl variety. However, rare examples of dioxolenone esters on phosphate or phophonate have been published. 4 The bioavailability and stability of (5-substituted 2-oxo-1,3-dioxolen-4-yl)methyl esters have been explored. Methyl as a substituent in position 5 proved to be optimal with respect to oral absorbability as well as stability of the prodrug. 5 We have aimed at the preparation of a conjugate of this particular dioxolenone unit and 1.",

            "text": "Lipophilic esters constitute another important class of phosphate and phosphonate prodrugs. Some alkyl 6 and alkyloxyalkyl 7 esters of nucleotides or acyclic nucleoside phosphonates have already been advanced into clinical studies. Their antiviral activities are superior when compared to the parent drugs. On the other hand, their physical properties are far from being optimal. They suffer from low solubility in water. Additionally, a simple alkyl chain is subjected to a x-oxidation process resulting in inactivation of the prodrug. Therefore, we have focused on those promoieties consisting of the aliphatic chain modified by means of addition(s) 0968 of hydroxyl group(s) or insertions of oxygen atoms. A hydroxylated alkyl or alkyloxyalkyl unit or a hexaethyleneglycol unit was attached by ester linkage to the phosphonate group of Adefovir as a model drug. The influence of the above-mentioned modifications on the in vitro antiviral activities is reported here. We also studied the effects of the addition of the hexaethylene glycol unit in Cidofovir [(S)-HPMPC, 2] as prodrugs closely related to Cidofovir hexadecyloxypropyl and octadecyloxyethyl esters, that is, HDP (S)-HPMPC and ODE (S)-HPMPC, respectively 7 (Fig. 1) . HDP (S)-HPMPC (CMX001) is currently being developed for use in the prophylactic and preemptive therapy of dsDNA viral infections.",

The resulting tetrabutylammonium salt is soluble in organic solvents and reacts with 2 equiv of an appropriately protected alkyl bromide or tosylate in moderate yields. The acid labile protecting groups of the prepared phosphonate diesters 18-22 were cleaved in a subsequent step by conventional methods (AcOH, Dowex 50).

The compounds were also evaluated against retroviruses [(i.e., human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and type 2 (HIV-2)] ( Table 2 ). All of the compounds were also examined against several RNA viruses, including vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Coxsackie B4, respiratory syncytial Table 2) . None of the prodrugs showed activity against the different RNA viruses, except for HIV-1 and HIV-2. However, a loss in the antiviral activities of the hydroxylated decyl or decyloxyethyl and hexaethyleneglycol esters of PMEA (compounds 3-14) against HIV was observed since compound 7 {2-[(10-Hydroxydecyl)oxy]ethyl ester of PMEA} was the only compound among this type of prodrugs showing some activity against HIV at nontoxic concentrations. Thus, compound 7 was able to inhibit HIV replication with 50% effective concentrations (EC 50 ) which were $10-fold higher than those observed for PMEA. In contrast, the (5-methyl-2-oxo-1,3-dioxolen-4-yl)methyl ester of PMEA anti-herpesvirus activities of the prodrugs 3-14 decreased when compared to the parent compound, with compound 7 being the most active one among these prodrugs. In the case of HSV and VZV, the drop in antiviral activities was inferior to that observed for HIV since the EC 50 values for compound 7 against HSV and VZV were three-to four-fold lower than those for PMEA. However, compound 7 was totally inactive against CMV. The (5-methyl-2oxo-1,3-dioxolen-4-yl)methyl ester 15 had anti-herpesvirus activities. The activity of compound 15 against herpesviruses was equivalent (HSV-1 and VZV) or two-(CMV) to four-fold (HSV-2) lower than that observed for the parent compound PMEA. Other esters of PMEA, that is, compounds 6, 8, 11 and 12, showed weak activities only against VZV, with EC 50 values in the range of 18-114 lM, which is 3-to 15-fold higher than the EC 50 values for the parent compound. None of the PMEA prodrugs showed activity against vaccinia virus or feline herpesvirus, like the parent compound PMEA.

Both prodrugs had activities equivalent to that of (S)-HPMPC against CMV, with EC 50 values in the range of 0.6-0.95 lM as compared to 0.9 lM for (S)-HPMPC. However, compounds 16 and 17 had six-to seven-fold lower activities than (S)-HPMPC against VZV.

The loss of anti-HIV activity of 12 is even more significant (>10 7 -fold compared to HDP-PMEA). Comparison of activities of compounds 3-11 with HDP-PMEA is not possible because different chain length plays a role. We can only speculate based on the relationship between activity and chain length, as observed with Cidofovir prodrugs. 11 The adequate chain shortening from 20 atoms (HDP) to 12 atoms (octyloxypropyl) caused circa 1000-fold drop in anti-CMV activity. However, the decrease in antiviral activity of compounds 3-8 is more significant ($10 7 -fold compared to HDP-PMEA) and is hardly accountable solely to the chain shortening.",

The residue (1.25 g) was tosylated with tosylchloride (1.54 g, 8.08 mmol) in a mixture of CH 2 Cl 2 (20 ml) and Et 3 N (1.3 ml, 9.3 mmol) at room temperature for 24 h. The mixture was washed with water (20 ml), and the aqueous layer was extracted with EtOAc (3 \u00c2 20 ml) again. Combined organic fractions were dried (MgSO 4 ) and evaporated.

The antiviral assays, other than HIV, were based on the inhibition of virus-induced cytopathicity or plaque formation in human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblasts, African green monkey cells (Vero), human epithelial cells (HeLa), Crandell-Rees feline kidney cells (CRFK), or Madin Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK) . Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID 50 of virus (1 CCID 50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) or with 20 plaque forming units (PFU). After 1-2 h adsorption period, the residual virus was removed, and the cell cultures were incubated in the presence of varying concentrations of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity or plaque formation (VZV) was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test",
