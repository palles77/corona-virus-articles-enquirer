Whereas TGEV-immune pigs were completely protected against challenge, all PRCV-immune pigs showed serological evidence of TGEV replication. Nevertheless, the aerosol or intragastric inoculation with PRCV primed the humoral immune system against TGEV and the TGEV challenge induced a secondary antibody response in most PRCV-immune pigs. Furthermore, all PRCV-immune pigs showed a decrease in the duration of the excretion of infectious TGEV (0-4 days) in comparison with the duration of the virus excretion by seronegative pigs (5-6 days).",

The infection, however, did not consistently induce diarrhoea or induced only a mild diarrhoea. TGEV always induces severe diarrhoea in neonatal piglets whereas a subclinical infection or mild disease is observed in growing pigs 1\u00b0. The increased resistance to disease in growing pigs has been attributed to a more rapid replacement of the villous epithelium 11 and to an increased capacity of the colon to absorb water in comparison with both mechanisms in neonatal piglets 12. The fact that a TGEV-immune pig developed a pasty faeces following TGEV challenge even though no virus or enteropathogenic bacteria could be isolated from the faeces indicates that not only the TGEV infection but also other factors such as possibly deprivation of food prior to the challenge and stress due to the manipulation at challenge could be partly responsible for the increased faecal fluid content.",

This is in agreement with previous results obtained by van Nieuwstadt et a1. 13 . Nevertheless, the degree of virus replication must have been limited in four of eight pigs immune following aerosol inoculation with PRCV since no TGEV was isolated from the faeces of these pigs. This suggests a partial protection against the TGEV infection in these pigs. Furthermore, all other PRCV-immune pigs showed a decrease in the duration of excretion of infectious TGEV in comparison with the duration of virus excretion by seronegative pigs. This suggested that the PRCV-immune pigs eliminated the TGEV infection more rapidly, or that they produced lower quantities of infectious virus from day 4 6 than the seronegative pigs. Low quantities of infectious virus produced in the small intestine are not detected in the faeces by viral isolation (unpublished observation) indicating that inactivation of virus may occur during the passage in the large intestine. Results in the killed pigs showed that at least some PRCV-immune pigs eliminated the infection more rapidly than the seronegative pigs, since virus replication could not be demonstrated in the small intestine of the PRCV-immune pigs killed on days 4 and 5 after challenge, whereas replication was seen in the seronegative pig killed on day 5 after challenge.",

            "text": "Van In the present study, results were obtained which suggest that the decreased duration of TGEV excretion was due to a local secondary immune response occurring at the intestinal mucosa. TGEV-IgA was detected in the faeces after TGEV challenge of pigs immune following aerosol inoculation with PRCV. TGEV-IgA could not be detected in the rectal contents of the four TGEV-immune pigs, but could be detected in low titre in the intestinal contents of the TGEV-immune pig slaughtered 2 days after challenge. Most probably, high TGEV-IgA titres have to be secreted at the intestinal mucosa before IgA can be detected in the faeces as seen in the PRCV-immune pig killed 4 days after challenge. Therefore, the appearance of IgA in the faeces sampled 1 2 weeks after challenge suggests that a secondary immune response occurred at the intestinal mucosa. This is in agreement with the observation that an IgA booster response occurs in the milk of PRCV-immune sows which become infected with TGEV. The sows obtain very high TGEV-IgA titres ( > 1024-10 240) in their milk within 1 to 2 weeks after the TGEV infection (Pensaert and Hooyberghs, unpublished results). It is well known that the antigenic stimulation of most of the lgA-secreting plasma cells in mammary tissue occurs in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). The stimulated cells migrate to the mammary gland shortly before parturition and during lactation. There they secrete lgA in the milk. This phenomenon is known as the gut mammary immunologic link 16. The presence of an IgA booster response in milk and in faeces after TGEV challenge, indicates that PRCV-primed IgA-positive cells appear in the intestinal mucosa following an infection with PRCV.",

It has been demonstrated that small amounts of infectious virus produced in the respiratory tract become ingested and reach the small intestine 5. Replication of PRCV, however, could not be demonstrated in small intestinal epithelial cells of 5 6-week-old seronegative pigs which were inoculated directly into the lumen of the cranial jejunum with 105 TCIDs0 PRCV 5. In the present study, intragastric inoculation with a higher dose, namely l0 T TCIDso of PRCV twice within 24h, induced virus-neutralizing antibodies. An attempt was made to induce virusneutralizing antibodies in two seronegative pigs by oral administration of l0 T TCIDso UV-inactivated PRCV, twice a day for 14 days, without success (unpublished results).

The difference between their results and the results in the present study cannot be explained. It should be mentioned that van Nieuwstadt et al. ~3\"14 performed their experiments in specific pathogen-free (SPF) pigs. It has been observed in 8 10-week-old mice, that SPF mice have significantly less IgA-secreting plasma cells in the small intestinal Protection in PRCV-immune pigs against TGEV: E. Cox et al. lamina propria and in mesenteric lymph nodes than conventionally reared mice 15. It was not examined whether this difference influenced the immune response. Furthermore, van Nieuwstadt et al. used ELISA to demonstrate TGEV excretion. ELISA detects not only infectious virus but also inactivated virus. It should be determined if viral antigen can be detected in the faeces for a longer period than infectious TGEV.",
