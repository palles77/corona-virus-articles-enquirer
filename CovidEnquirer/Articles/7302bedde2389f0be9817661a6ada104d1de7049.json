            "text": "Two recombinant FIPV spike proteins were assessed for their immunogenic properties in 8week-old kittens, which were then challenged intranasally with FIPV 79-1146. Humoral responses were assessed by ELISA and serum neutralisation test. Changes in PBMC cytokine mRNA levels were detected by a reverse transcription, semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction assay (RT-sqPCR), assessing IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and IFNg. All of the kittens developed clinical signs typical of FIP, which were confirmed on gross post mortem examination. The recombinant proteins induced little or no specific antibody response prior to challenge, and failed to alter the course of disease compared to controls. One week after virus challenge, the stimulated PBMCs showed small increases in the expression of IL-6 and IFNg mRNA, which correlated with a transient pyrexia. After this time expression of IL-6 mRNA remained unaltered but, as FIP developed, mRNA levels of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12 and IFNg became markedly depressed. #",

            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is an immune-mediated, usually fatal disease of domestic and exotic felids. The disease presents as a fibrinous serositis, with accumulations of highly proteinaceous fluid within body cavities, disseminated pyogranulomata formation, hypergammaglobulinaemia, and the formation of immune complexes (reviewed by Pedersen, 1995) . It is caused by infection with certain variants of Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 65 (1998) 221\u00b1242 feline coronavirus (Pedersen, 1987; Vennema et al., 1995; Herrewegh et al., 1995) . The pathogenesis of the disease is complex, with cell mediated immunity (CMI) playing a protective role, while humoral responses are generally detrimental, aiding viral dissemination by opsonising its uptake by macrophages, and resulting in immune complex (IC) formation (Weiss and Scott, 1981a; Pedersen, 1987) . The ICs are deposited in small blood vessels, where they fix and activate complement (C3) and become phagocytosed by macrophages (Weiss and Scott, 1981b) . Infected macrophages then promote immune-mediated tissue reactions via the interaction of their altered cell membranes with complement-fixing antibody or cytotoxic T-cells. Degeneration of infected macrophages leads to the release of new virus and complement components (Jacobse-Geels et al., 1980; Weiss and Scott, 1981a; Jacobse-Geels and Horzinek, 1983) . A vicious cycle of complement-mediated vascular damage ensues, generating chemotactic complement components and attracting neutrophils, which then release proteolytic enzymes, leading to further tissue damage. These reactions can be seen as degenerative and proliferative changes in blood vessel walls, particularly in the endothelial and medial layers of small veins and arteries in the peritoneal and pleural serosa, and in the interstitial connective tissue of parenchymatous organs (Hayashi et al., 1977; Jacobse-Geels et al., 1980; Weiss and Scott, 1981a, b) . Cytokines are intimately involved in the control of immune reactions (Mosmann and Coffman, 1986; Romagnani, 1997) . While it is not yet known which cytokines are of particular importance in the development of FIP, it has been postulated that, as the disease progresses, increased production of IL-6 and possibly IL-4 (typical Th2 cytokines) and reduced production of IL-2 and/or interferon g (IFNg) (typical Th1 cytokines) may result in decreased Th1-associated protective CMI, and increased Th2-associated nonprotective antibody responses. Evidence in support of this comes from studies showing that clinical FIP is associated with markedly increased expression of IL-10 within lymphoid tissues (Dean et al., 1997) , IL-10 usually being classified as a Th2 cytokine. FIP is also associated with high levels of IL-6 and IL-1 in both sera and ascitic fluid (Goitsuka et al., 1990) , the cytokines being secreted by FCoV-infected macrophages within the granulomata and peritoneal exudate (Goitsuka et al., 1987b (Goitsuka et al., , 1988 (Goitsuka et al., , 1991a Hasegawa and Hasegawa, 1991) . IL-6 is also produced, along with IL-1, by vascular endothelium within areas of vascular damage (Carvalho and Savage, 1997) . The presence of IL-6 can polarise naive Th cells to effector Th2 cells, inducing the initial production of IL-4 by CD4 T-cells (Rincon et al., 1997) . Acting in synergy, IL-6, IL-1 and IL-4 can then stimulate B cell activation and induce the non-protective hypergammaglobulinaemia that is seen commonly in clinical FIP (Maggi et al., 1987; Sparkes et al., 1991; Clerici and Shearer, 1993) . Increased levels of plasma leukotriene B4 (LTB4) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) have also been seen associated with clinical FIP (Weiss et al., 1988) . PGE2 favours the development of a Th2 response, augmenting the production of IL-6 and IL-10 (Berger et al., 1996) , and inhibiting the production of Th1 cytokines (IL-12 from dendritic cells and IFNg from T-cells) ( Van der Pouw Kraan et al., 1995; Hilkens et al., 1996) . While, taken together, these findings support the hypothesis that FIP is a Th2 disease, a number of results are in disagreement with this conclusion, including mild elevations in IL-12 within the spleen, reduced levels of IL-4 within the thymus and minimal changes in TNF (Dean et al., 1997) .",

This trend was also seen with IL-4 mRNA, while the expression of IL-12 mRNA was slightly reduced. From the day of challenge to euthanasia mRNA levels for IL-2, IL-4, IL-10 and IL-12 were significantly reduced. This downward trend was also followed by IFNg, but with this cytokine the fall was preceded by a small rise 1-week after challenge, most obviously in the Control group. Overall, the IL-6 mRNA levels remained unchanged as the disease progressed. While the cytokine mRNA levels showed quite marked variation between individual kittens, there was little evidence that the immunisations had any effect. Statistically there was no significant difference between the three treatment groups; all showed suppression of IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12 and IFNg mRNA levels after challenge. When looking at the IL-6 levels in individual kittens, two basic patterns emerged; the majority showed elevated IL-6 expression, at least initially, while in three of the kittens (Nos. 4, 6 and 12) there was no elevation in IL-6 ( Fig. 8) . Interestingly, these were three of the earliest kittens to show evidence of clinical disease.",

The mean rectal temperature curves were also similar to those seen previously, with a fever spike in the week following challenge, after which time the temperatures returned to normal, prior to more persistent pyrexia developing alongside the development of clinical signs (Weiss and Scott, 1981c; Vennema et al., 1990) . Why the vaccines used in this study failed to generate an immune response remains unclear. Previously the baculovirus system has successfully generated biologically active feline proteins, including IFNg (Sakurai et al., 1992; Argyle et al., 1996) , and has produced feline viral proteins that are immunogenic in cats (ENV and GAG proteins of FIV) (Lutz et al., 1995; Berlinski et al., 1996) , and mice (feline herpesvirus hemagglutinin) (Maeda et al., 1996) . The carbopol adjuvant has been successfully used in a number of vaccine studies (Gualandi et al., 1988; Mumford et al., 1994) . Since the protein in the current study induced low levels of IgG which were not neutralising, it may have been presented inappropriately, perhaps being incorrectly folded.",

Con A, a putative T-cell mitogen, tends to be used since feline lymphocytes respond poorly to PHA and LPS, but respond well to Con A (Schultz and Adams, 1978; Rottman et al., 1996) . Feline macrophages respond to stimulation by LPS (Lin and Bowman, 1991) . The optimal dose of Con A has been determined to be $10 mg/ml (Goitsuka et al., 1986; Rottman et al., 1995) . Prior to stimulation, feline IL-2 mRNA is not readily detected (Cozzi et al., 1993) , while IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 and TNF appear to be expressed constitutively at low levels (Rottman et al., 1995) . However, since these latter cytokines are synthesised by monocytes and macrophages this low level expression may result from cell activation during processing (Rottman et al., 1995) . After stimulation with Con A, feline PBMCs readily produce mRNA for IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IFNg and TNF (Cozzi et al., 1993; Rottman et al., 1996) . Our study confirmed this finding for each of these cytokines, except TNF, which was not assessed.",

Less abundant cytokines included IFNg, IL-2 and IL-4. These came mainly from T-cells, with CD8cells being the major source of IFNg in most individuals, although in others it appeared to be being secreted by either CD4 or CD14 cells (Zhou et al., 1994; Hagiwara et al., 1995) . In disagreement with these findings, IL-6 and TNF are normally difficult to detect in unstimulated PBMC cultures (Al-Janadi et al., 1993) . The reason for this discrepancy may relate to inadvertant activation of the monocytes during the isolation process, since the separation of PBMC on a hyperosmolar solution, such as Ficoll-Hypaque, and their culture ex vivo may modify PBMC function (De Groote et al., 1992) . Stimulation with PHA failed to alter the production of IL-6, IL-10 or TNF, but caused a significant increase in IL-2, IL-4 and IFNg. This probably arose because the T-cell mitogen had a positive effect on the CD4cells, which are the primary source of IL-2 and IL-4, along with the CD8cells that also secrete IFNg. However, a T-cell mitogen is unable to affect the CD14 monocytes that are the main source of IL-6 or IL-10 production in humans (Hagiwara et al., 1995) . This is unlike the situation in mice, where IL-6 and IL-10 come from CD4cells.",

Small increases in IL-6 and IFNg expression were seen in the week following the challenge, after which IL-6 expression stayed fairly constant, while the expression of the other cytokines became significantly reduced. The initial increase in IL-6 corresponded with the initial fever spike, and since IL-6 is pyrogenic, it is possible that the two events are linked (Helle et al., 1988) , with the source of IL-6, and possibly IFNg, being virus-infected monocytes/ macrophages. While clinical signs of illness did not arise until more than 2-weeks after the viral challenge, the general depression of cytokine expression was seen very early, then progressed as clinical signs developed. This is consistent with findings seen in the lymphoid tissues of cats with FIP, where changes in cytokine production occur rapidly after a virulent challenge (Dean et al., 1997) .",

IL-6 apart, this study demonstrates overall immunosuppression, with reduced expression of cytokines from both monocytes/macrophages (IL-10, IL-12), and T-cells (IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IFNg). FIP has previously been shown to suppress blastogenic responses to Con A by both PBMC and lymphocytes from affected lymph nodes (Haagmans et al., 1996) , and reduced IL-2 expression has been seen in other feline viral diseases, including FeLV infection (Goitsuka et al., 1987a) . Lymphocyte apoptosis and lymphopenia may be responsible for the lack of T-cell cytokine expression from the PBMCs, while the reduced expression of monocyte/macrophage cytokines may perhaps relate to their exhaustion or dysfunction. Dean et al. (1997) demonstrated increases in IL-10 within lymphoid tissue, with small increases in IL-12 within spleen, and reduced levels of IL-4 within thymus. However, it is difficult to correlate these findings with those of the present study since tissue samples rather than PBMC were assessed.",

While IL-6 activity is not seen in the plasma of healthy cats (Goitsuka et al., 1990) , it is markedly increased in the plasma and ascitic fluid of cats with FIP (Goitsuka et al., 1990) . While it may have been expected that circulating monocytes would be expressing this cytokine at high levels (Jirik et al., 1989; Sironi et al., 1989) , from this study this appears not to be the case. That said, since the expression of the other monocyte-derived cytokines were depressed in this study, while the overall level of IL-6 remained constant, the overall expression of IL-6 may be enhanced to some degree. Evidence for IL-6 being generated mainly outside the blood stream comes from studies showing that IL-6 is secreted by FCoV-infected macrophages within granulomata and peritoneal exudates, from where it then diffuses into the circulation (Goitsuka et al., 1987b (Goitsuka et al., , 1988 (Goitsuka et al., , 1990 (Goitsuka et al., , 1991a Hasegawa and Hasegawa, 1991) . The case of kittens 4, 6 and 12, is of particular interest. These were three of the earliest kittens to show evidence of clinical disease, and in each case they failed to show an elevation in their IL-6 expression at any point after challenge. The significance of this finding remains unclear.",

Apoptosis is seen in both T-and B-cell areas of the lymphoid organs, plus the omentum, pyogranulomata, and thymus. Although, it is not yet proven that the apoptotic cells are T-cells, the virtual removal of all T-cells from affected tissues, together with thymus atrophy, argue that it is more likely to be the T-cells that are dying, rather than the B-cells (Stoddart, 1985; Pedersen, 1987; Haagmans et al., 1996) , particularly given that the apoptosis is occurring in the face of hypergammaglobulinaemia and immune complex formation (Jacobse-Geels et al., 1980; Sparkes et al., 1991; Haagmans et al., 1996) . Apoptosis occurs as a result of the release of soluble mediators from virus-infected monocytes/macrophages and neutrophils, rather than from viral infection of the lymphocytes per se. The exact nature of the soluble factors has still to be determined, but it is known that it does not involve TNF or transforming growth factor (TGF) (Haagmans et al., 1996) . Our results showing profound reductions in PBMC cytokine expression is further evidence of the immunosuppressive nature of this disease.",
