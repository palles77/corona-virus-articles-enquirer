Zoonotic viruses are those viruses of animals that can cross boundaries such that they occasionally infect humans. Some examples of diseases induced in humans by zoonotic viruses are dengue and Ebola fever, the equine encephalitids (i.e., Eastern, St. Louis, Venezuelan, and Western), hantavirus pneumonia, Lassa fever, Marburg fever, rabies, and yellow fever. Additionally, it should be noted that the zoonotic category includes most, if not all, of the human illnesses induced either by arboviruses (viruses whose transmission is vectored by arthropods) or by the hemorrhagic fever viruses. With respect to the zoonotic viruses humans are, at best, alternate hosts. Humans do in fact usually represent dead-end hosts for these zoonotic viruses, meaning that subsequent transmission of those viruses either to new humans or back to the natural host is not sustained.",

That overall approach must enable the virus to attain its two principal goals, namely, that the virus be able to reproduce itself within a host and that the virus then be transmitted onward to a new host. Those mechanisms that any given virus species employs for achieving its sustainment, of course, have been developed through a process that involved an initiation of events by random chance followed by evolutionary selection. The most successful overall approaches may be those that subsequently evolve into the types of relationships between a virus and its host species that will allow the virus to persist without eliminating the host population. This latter point is very important, because the virus may in turn become extinct if it kills off the host population. It is for this reason that excessive virulence will be detrimental to the virus, and an interesting side point may be that, if an individual host cannot successfully surmount the infection, then the death of that individual host may be seen as an altruistic defense mechanism for the host population as a whole.",

Productive, in this context, means that the number of progeny viral particles produced during the course of an infection is sufficient for the particles to transmit the infection to a new host with some reasonable probability. The productive approach involves an evolutionary decision as to whether there will be either a very short initial but highly productive course of infection (short term-initial), a course of infection that is prolonged but only intermittently productive (recurrent), or a productive though very slow course of infection whose severity progressively increases with time to reach a dramatic end-stage (increasing to end-stage).

Host survival depends on the type of virus involved, the extent to which the involved virus and humans have had time to coevolve as species, and whether or not the ancestral humans of that particular subgroup of the human host population previously have had contact with the causative virus. Coevolution usually will tend to make the outcome of this pattern of viral infection sufficiently mild as to be associated with a fairly low incidence of mortality in an otherwise healthy population of human hosts. Some examples of this pattern would be the infections caused by the human caliciviruses (family Caliciviridae), human influenza viruses (family Orthomyxoviridae), human polioviruses and human rhinoviruses (family Picornaviridae), and the human rotaviruses (family Reoviridae).",

A nonproductive infection is one in which the production of infectious virus particles is so limited that the virus must transmit itself through other means, usually by transferring a copy of only the nucleic acid genome of the virus. In these instances, the viral infection is normally acquired by direct transfer of the viral genetic material from the human parents to their developing fetuses, such transfer occurring via the egg and sperm cells. There may be no apparent health effects associated with such an infection. An example of this pattern is the infections caused by the endogenous retroviruses (family Retroviridae), whose genomes are incorporated into the chromosomal material of every cell in the human body (Villareal, 1997) . The nonproductive pattern of infection seems to suggest the highest degree of coevolution between a virus and its host, since a nonproductive virus has no means of transmitting itself to a new host without some very active, albeit perhaps unwitting, participation on the part of the present host.",

Such a molecule is said to be the \"virus's receptor,\" and will be some cellular protein or lipid component naturally produced by those cells. The virus's choice of receptor is a product of viral evolution. After binding to its receptor, the virus gains entrance to the interior of the cell and viral replication begins. Viruses whose genomes are composed of DNA generally replicate mainly within the nucleus. In contrast, those viruses with RNA genomes generally focus their center of replication in the cytoplasm. During the course of replication, the virus must decide which cellular systems and machinery it will employ. Some large viruses carry the genomic coding capacity for many of their own enzymes, while others may rely almost completely on the enzymatic machinery possessed by the host cell. Many viruses, including those belonging to the genus Enterovirus of the family Picornaviridae, are said to be highly cytopathogenic, meaning that they usually quickly kill the host cell as a result of infection. Other viruses, such as those that occupy the genus Rubivirus of the family Togaviridae, may cause prolonged and severe crippling of the cell rather than killing it outright. A further discussion of these issues can be found in Chapter 3.",

Primary tropisms will be associated with production of those viral particles that subsequently contribute to transmission of the viral infection to a new host. As such, the primary tropisms tend to be related to those sites (termed \"portals\") through which the virus either enters or exits the host body. Secondary tropisms may represent accidents. Some of these accidents may come about as a result of the molecule that a virus uses as its receptor, existing on the cells of tissues that are unrelated to those that the virus must employ in order to achieve transmission.

Various glands associated with mucosal tissues secrete antimicrobial compounds into the mucus produced by those tissues. Some mucosal tissues also possess cilia whose movement helps to expel both the mucus and any foreign materials, including pathogens, that become entrapped within the mucus. An additional example of a non-immune defense is the stomach acid produced to aid digestion of organic compounds. Many gastroenteritis viruses, such as the rotaviruses of the family Reoviridae and the astroviruses of Astroviridae, have evolved such an effective resistance to attack by proteolytic enzymes that those viruses virtually need partial proteolysis to facilitate their infectivity.

The first is transmission by direct contact (also known as direct transfer) between two members of those species that host the virus. This includes both the possibility of transmission between two members of the principal host species and the possibility of transmission between a member of that principal host species and some alternate host species, and the latter may represent a vectoring species. The second group is transmission by indirect contact (also known as indirect transfer). These routes have been described in detail by Hurst and Murphy (1996) and are represented in Figures 9 and 12 of Chapter 1 herein. As explained in Chapter 1, there are some routes of viral transmission that are considered unnatural vehicular routes. Such routes represent the use of unnatural vehicles as a means to evade the host defenses associated with natural portals of entry. These unnatural routes involve invasive medical devices (such as syringes, endoscopes, and other surgical instruments) and transplanted tissues, including transfused blood and blood products.

The advantage is that those viruses transmitted by direct contact need not be stable when exposed to ambient environments. The drawback is that the number of new hosts to which they have potential access may be smaller than for viruses transmitted by indirect contact. Viruses that are endogenous by their nature will survive for as long as the host survives. Although endogenous viruses can only be transmitted to host progeny, these viruses neither have to adapt themselves to nor coevolve with any other hosting species. An example of this type of endogenous agent would be the endogenous retroviruses of the family Retroviridae. Viruses that are venereal in nature, that is, transmitted in semen and vaginal secretions during sexual activity, have a somewhat greater potential for contacting new hosts. Represented among the venereal viruses of humans are some species of the genera Simplexvirus (family Herpesviridae) and Papillomavirus (family Papovaviridae). Once these venereal viruses infect a host, they remain associated with the host for the rest of the host's life in the form of a permanent infection. Thus, although the frequency with which endogenous and venereal viruses can find a new host is restricted, the viruses compensate for this to some degree by remaining with the host for a very long time. The next step on the scale of host access is represented by those viruses transmitted via direct contact with insect vectors. These viruses have greatly increased access to new hosts and tend not to remain with their present host for the remainder of the host's life. Those viruses transmitted by biting insects are commonly referred to as \"arboviruses,\" which is an abbreviation of \"arthropod-borne viruses.\" Included among those arboviruses that infect humans are members of the genera Alphavirus (family Togaviridae); Bunyavirus, Nairovirus, and Phlebovirus (all of the family Bunyaviridae); and Flavivirus (family Flaviviridae).",

If any particular type of virus that is secreted into saliva has either no stability when exposed to ambient environments in oral secretions or only limited stability under those conditions, then the virus will have to be transmitted by saliva that is transferred during oral contact between hosts. Conversely, if the particular virus type has good stability when exposed to ambient environments in oral secretions, then that virus can be transmitted on shared food or in association with fomites. Some of the viruses transmitted in saliva do remain associated with the host as a permanent infection, and these often are the viruses that possess limited stability in ambient environments, such as members of the family Herpesviridae. Many of the viruses that are secreted into saliva and can be transferred to a new host in association with fomites do not remain associated with the host as a permanent infection, such as members of the family Picornaviridae. In general, those viruses transmitted by indirect contact between hosting individuals tend to produce only transient infections of their individual hosts rather than remain associated with the individual host as a permanent infection. These several latter points suggest that there may be some evolutionary relationship between ease of viral transmission to a new potential host individual or the frequency of opportunities for viral transmission, and the length of time that a virus must be capable of remaining with its present host to have a reasonable chance of achieving eventual transmission.",

Viruses transmitted by indirect contact have the advantage of potential access to a far greater number of hosting individuals than is the case for viruses transmitted by direct contact. The drawback is that the viruses must have evolved stability when they are exposed to the ambient environment. The vehicles that viruses utilize to achieve transmission between hosting individuals by indirect contact are subdivided into the following four categories: food, water, air (in actuality, this refers to aerosols), and fomites. Transmission by any of these four categories of vehicles will usually be associated with some specific physical activity on the part of the present host, and will always be associated with some physical activity on the part of the proximate host.",

Notable examples of viruses transmitted in this manner are those belonging to the viral families Coronaviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, and Paramyxoviridae, and members of the genus Viral contamination of fomites (defined as solid environmental surfaces that can serve in transmission of infections) can occur in many ways. The variety of things that represent fomites include items used to conserve warmth (e.g., blankets, clothing), items used while eating (e.g., cups, dinner plates, and utensils), tables on which diapers are changed, doorknobs, medical devices, toilet seats, and toys. The ways by which these environmental items become contaminated include projection of droplet aerosols onto environmental objects during sneezing or coughing, aerosols falling onto objects, and unintended surface contamination (including children's clothing, blankets and toys) by blood, feces, fluid from skin lesions (rashes), nasal secretions, saliva, or urine. The task of achieving viral transmission via this route is accomplished when these objects are subsequently handled or used by a potential proximate host. Among the viral genera whose members can be transmitted via fomites are Orthopoxvirus (family Poxviridae) and Rhinovirus (family Picornaviridae).",

Transmission of this virus between hosts occurs when an infected animal bites an uninfected animal, with the virus being transferred by saliva into the bite wound. Subsequent movement of viral infection into the nervous system and salivary glands of the newly bitten host animal is considered to represent primary tropisms, as infection at these sites is directly related to movement of virus into the body of the current host and subsequent transfer of virus to the next host. Infection of the adrenal cortex is considered a secondary tropism, since those viruses produced in the adrenal cortex will not be transferred to a subsequent host animal. However, infection of the adrenal cortex may play a role in the viral ecology by augmenting the aggressiveness of this newly infected host, thereby increasing the likelihood that this animal will then bite other potential host animals.
