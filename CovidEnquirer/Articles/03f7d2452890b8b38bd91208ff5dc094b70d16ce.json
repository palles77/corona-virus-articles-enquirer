The limitations of this approach were recognized in 1 acute health care organization that led to the development of an Infection Control Continuous Quality Improvement tool. Methods: The Pronovost cycle, Barriers and Mitigation tool, and Hexagon framework were used to review the existing monitoring system and develop a quality improvement data collection tool that considered the context of care delivery. Results: Barriers and opportunities for improvement including ambiguity, consistency and feasibility of expectations, the environment, knowledge, and education were combined in a monitoring tool that was piloted and modified in response to feedback. Local adaptations enabled staff to prioritize and monitor issues important in their own workplace.",

Conclusions: Hand hygiene compliance monitoring alone misses other important aspects of infection control compliance. A continuous quality improvement tool was developed reflecting specific organizational needs that could be transferred or adapted to other organizations.",

The value of hand hygiene remains undisputed, but despite regular monitoring and performance feedback, compliance is suboptimal. 4, 5 Hand hygiene forms only part of an overall infection prevention program, and its use as the overall indicator of infection prevention excellence is questionable, especially as monitoring is fraught with pitfalls. Hand hygiene compliance monitoring is commonly undertaken by directly observing practice, 6 but this is flawed because HCWs are aware of scrutiny and transient improvement in performance may occur, 7 generating inflated scores and not reflecting usual behavior. [8] [9] [10] A review of the hand hygiene monitoring throughout 1 organization found the data that were based on observation of practice did not accurately reflect infection control compliance, 11 contributed little to improving practice, were not considered the best use of time, and lacked local credibility. These factors are likely to influence the value of these data in practice improvement. 12 ",

Five themes emerged that are summarized. a) Knowledge, education, and training Improving infection control knowledge, education, and training can enhance compliance and potentially reduce infection acquisition, [21] [22] [23] although its impact and value is disputed. 24, 25 The effect of education is difficult to gauge as it is one of a bundle of interventions in studies in which it has been judged to be beneficial. [26] [27] [28] [29] Further, improvements after education may not be sustained, [30] [31] [32] and may require continuous renewal to sustain reported effectiveness, 29 although a limited ongoing residual effect has been reported. 33 The \"stickiness\" 34 and memorability of ideas have influenced key concepts such as the \"My Five Moments of Hand Hygiene\" concept 35 promoted by the World Health Organization, which has been widely adopted as an approach to indicate when hands should be cleaned.",
