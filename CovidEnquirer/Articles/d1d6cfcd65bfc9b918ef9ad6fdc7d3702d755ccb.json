In this study, a killed vaccine against TGEV-like CCoV strains, included in the new subtype CCoV-IIb, was developed through inactivation with betapropiolactone and emulsification with MF59 TM adjuvant. Safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of the developed vaccine were evaluated in vivo. Five 10-week-old beagle pups were administered (three weeks apart) two vaccine doses, whereas two animals served as unvaccinated controls. The vaccine was shown to be safe as no local neither systemic reactions were observed after first and second dose administration. Serum antibodies against CCoV were detected in vaccinates starting from study day 14 (by enzymelinked immunosorbent assay) or 28 (by virus neutralisation test). Subsequent challenge with virulent CCoV-IIb resulted in the development of mild gastroenteric disease in control pups, whereas vaccinates did not display clinical signs. Faecal shedding of the challenge virus occurred in both treatment groups, but vaccinated dogs were found to shed very low viral titres in comparison to controls. The developed vaccine may help control the CCoV-IIb-induced disease (and active virus circulation) in environments, such as kennels and shelters, where the pathogenic potential of this virus is greater as a consequence of predisposing factors and concurrent infections.",

CCoV is strictly related to feline coronavirus type I (FCoV-I) and type II (FCoV-II), transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine (TGEV) and its respiratory variant porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV). Based on the similarities in their genomic organisation, all these viruses have been now included in a unique viral species Alphacoronavirus-1 [1] . CCoV has a classical faecal-oral route of transmission and colonises the top of the villi of the enteric tract, being responsible for mild, self-limiting enteritis. Infected pups usually recover spontaneously from CCoV-induced disease [2] . However, hypervirulent CCoV strains have been reported in the last years [3] and a pantropic variant [4] has been associated to systemic, sometimes fatal disease in pups under natural [5] and experimental conditions [6] [7] [8] .",

In addition, CCoVs with a recombinant origin between CCoV-II and TGEV have been identified in the faeces of dogs with diarrhoea and have been found to be widespread in dogs populations. Accordingly, CCoV-II has been further classified into two subtypes, CCoV-IIa and CCoV-IIb, including \"classical\" CCoVs and TGEV-like strains, respectively [13] . Subtype CCoV-IIb has been reported in several European countries [14, 15] , as well as in Japan [12] . Limited antigenic cross-reactivity has been observed between subtype IIa and IIb CCoVs and this has raised some concerns about the real efficacy of the CCoV vaccines available in the market (prepared with subtype IIa) against the TGEV-like strains [13, 15] .",

In the present study, virus 341/05 was used for vaccine preparation, whereas the Hungarian strain served as challenge virus. CCoV-IIb strain 341/05 was chosen as vaccine virus since it contains a 154nucleotide deletion in ORF7b that could be used in the future as vaccine genetic marker, whereas strain174/06 was used as challenge virus since it had a distinct geographical origin.

The dogs had tested negative for CCoV RNA by a realtime RT-PCR assay [23] carried out on the faeces and for CCoV antibodies by an ELISA test [24] carried out on serum samples. All dogs were housed individually in separate boxes, fed twice daily with a commercial dry dog food and provided water ad libitum.

Analogous CCoV strains, TGEV-like, have been identi- fied about 40 years later in dead pups raised in Italy or imported from eastern Europe [13] . Upon genomic characterization, the virus was found to have a chimerical S gene, with the 5 end of the S gene being acquired from TGEV via recombination. Also, the virus was associated with a form of mild gastroenteritis in infected pups and it was named CCoV-IIb, in order to distinguish it from classical CCoV-II viruses (CCoV-IIa). Subsequent studies showed that CCoV-IIb is widespread in Europe with highest frequency of detection in eastern countries [15] . Limited antigenic cross-reactivity has been demonstrated between CCoV-IIa and CCoV-IIb and this has been hypothesised to account for a possible decreased efficacy of the current vaccines, based on inactivated CCoV-IIa strains, against TGEV-like CCoV strains [13, 15] . In order to overcome the possible limitations of the existing CCoV formulations, we have developed an inactivated, MF59 TMadjuvanted vaccine prepared with a CCoV-IIb strain. This vaccine was found to be safe as neither local nor systemic reactions were induced in subcutaneously injected beagle pups. The CCoV-IIb vaccine was immunogenic, eliciting seroconversion in inoculated pups, and effective, as it was able to prevent CCoV-induced disease. Mild gastroenteritis occurred in all unvaccinated pups after infection with the challenge virus, as observed in previous challenge studies [13] .",

By converse, an experimental modified-live virus (MLV) vaccine administered oronasally appeared to be able to prevent both CCoV disease and infection [27] . In this study, the inactivated CCoV-IIb vaccine, albeit not completely protective against the infection, was able to decrease markedly shedding of the challenge-virus, thus preventing the spread of virulent strains in the environment. A possible explanation for the good vaccine efficacy may rely on the MF59 TM adjuvant used in the formulation. MF59 TM is an oil-inwater formulation that contains surfactants (Tween 80 and Span 85), along with squalene emulsified under high-pressure conditions [29] . This adjuvant is satisfactorily included in the vaccines commonly used for prevention of seasonal and pandemic influenza [28] . The immune responses elicited by the MF59 TM -adjuvanted CCoV-IIb vaccine, in terms of ELISA OD values and homologous VN antibody titres, were greater than those observed with an aluminium hydroxide-adjuvanted CCoV-IIa formulation [26] and comparable to experimental MLV vaccines [27] . The higher efficacy of the vaccines based on MF59 TM adjuvant is still largely unclear. Enhancement of the interaction between the antigen and the dendritic cell seems to be involved [28] . However, considering that the efficacy of commercially available CCoV vaccines was not evaluated in the present study, the claimed higher efficacy of the MF59 TMadjuvanted formulation may be biased by different ages and/or genetic backgrounds of the pups employed for the vaccination trials.",

            "text": "In dogs CCoV generally causes mild, self-limiting infections restricted to the gastrointestinal tract. Accordingly, CCoV vaccines are not considered as core vaccines and their use is discretional. The World Small Animal Veterinary Association currently does not recommend CCoV vaccination as the prevalence of CCoV-confirmed clinical cases is rather low [30] . However, the prevalence of CCoVinduced enteric disease in dogs is likely largely underrated, as diagnosis of CCoV infection requires specific tests that are not available in all the laboratories [2] . In addition, fatal diseases may occur as a consequence of mixed infections by CCoV and other canine pathogens, such as CPV-2, CAdV-1, or CDV [2] . Although it has never been proved that vaccination against CCoV reduces the severity of mixed infections, CCoV vaccination should be considered a priority in some settings, such as kennels and animal shelters, where CCoV is expected to circulate largely, mixed infections are common and animals are subjected to stress conditions, that may trigger the development of severe clinical forms. To date, there is still limited information on CCoV-IIb infection in dogs, but our findings seem to suggest that the pathogenetic patterns of this new CCoV subtype are similar to those observed for CCoV-IIa [13, 15] . Accordingly, similar prophylaxis strategies could be enacted to prevent and control CCoV-IIb-associated disease in dogs. The one-way antigenic cross-reactivity, already shown by neutralisation in vitro between CCoV-IIb and CCoV-IIa [13] , was confirmed by the present study, as antibodies elicited against recombinant CCoV were able to cross-neutralise only partially the heterologous virus (CCoV-IIa). Based on these findings, as well as on the poor efficacy of aluminium hydroxide-adjuvanted formulations even against CCoV-IIa, it could be speculated that commercially available vaccines are not protective against CCoV-IIb. Therefore, it will be pivotal to assess whether and to which extent cross-protection occurs in vivo and whether CCoV-IIb (TGEV-like)-based vaccines may be developed for prevention of CCoV disease induced by both CCoV subtypes in dogs.",
