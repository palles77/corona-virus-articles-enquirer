The altered immunological response of these patients may contribute to the original article Annals of Oncology development of more severe forms of disease. In our study, three cases still excreted virus after 5 days in the ICU, as already reported [16] . Prolonged periods of viral shedding could be associated to disease severity [17] and perhaps with an oseltamivir-resistant strain of the virus [18] .
