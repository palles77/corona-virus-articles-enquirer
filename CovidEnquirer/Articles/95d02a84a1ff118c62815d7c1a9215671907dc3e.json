            "text": "A coronavirus which was isolated from a cheetah (Acinonyx jubutur) that succumbed to feline infectious peritonitis was characterized in vitro. The virus was determined to be highly cell-associated with Crandell feline kidney (CrFK) cells and was routinely rn~~ned as a persistent infection (CrFK 83-4497). The cheetah coronavirus was compared with other members of the feline coronavirus group including the feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) 79-1683 and the feline infectious peritonitis viruses (FIPV), 79-1146, and UCD-1. The cheetah coronavirus was demonstrated to have a restricted host-cell range with limited cytopathic effect. Indirect immunofluorescence with antisera to FIPV UCD-1 revealed the concentration of viral antigens in the perinuclear region of cells infected with the cheetah coronavirus. Ultrastructural studies of the cheetah coronavirus indicated a limited number of immature viral particles within cytoplasmic vesicles and at the cell surface. This was in contrast to electron microscopy results of FECV 79-1683 and FIPV 79-1146, which had numerous mature virus particles within the cytoplasmic vesicles, as well as at the cell surface. The cheetah coronavirus was tentatively placed in the feline coronavirus family based upon its antigenic reactivity by immunofluorescence; however, the possibility that it represents a unique coronavirus of cheetahs should not be dismissed without further analyses at the host and genomic levels. Coronaviral infections of cats have been of considerable interest due to the severity of disease manifestations and the lack of prophylactic measures for containment of infection and disease (Barlough and Stoddart, 1989; Horzinek and Osterhaus, 1979a; Pedersen, 1987) . The feline coronaviruses are comprised of two major pathogenic groups known as feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) and feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) (Pedersen et al., 1984) . The FIPV strains cause an i~une-mediated vasculitis which has a high mortality once clinical signs are observed (Pedersen, 1987; Weiss and Scott, 1981) . The FECV strains, although closely related to FIPV strains antigenically, cause a mild to asymptomatic infection of the gastrointestinal tract (Fiscus et al., 1987; McKeirnan et al., 1981; Pedersen et al., 1981b Pedersen et al., , 1984 Tupper et al., 1987) . Although the feline coronaviruses have been primarily studied in their natural host (Pedersen, 1987) , reports of FIP-like disease conditions have been reported in other members of the Felidae, including the large exotic cats, lion, tiger, and most recently, the cheetah Evermann et al., 1984 Evermann et al., ,1986 Horzinek and Osterhaus, 1979b; Pfeifer et al., 1983; Quesenberry, 1984; Worley, 1987) . The outcome of FIPV infection in the cheeetah has taken on an apparently more virulent aspect as higher percentages of the cheetah population have succumbed to disease than is currently recognized in the domestic cat population . The apparent increased susceptibility of the cheetah to disease may be due in part to the introduction of an FIPV strain into an immunologically naive population, or to an abnormality in the cheetah's immune response or a combination of both factors Heeney et al., 1989; Marker and O'Brien, 1989; O'Brien et al., 1985) . In an effort to determine if the strain of coronavirus which was isolated from a cheetah that died of FIP (Evermann et al., 1984) was unique from other currently available strains of feline coronavirus, comparative studies were conducted to characterize the cheetah coronavirus in vitro.",

Selected fields were observed and photographed using a Zeiss IIIRS fluorescent microscope with a mercury light and Kodak T&X pan 400 ASA film. Cheetah sera were obtained as part of a serologic survey for determining the prevalence of feline coronavirus infection in captive and wild-caught cheetahs (Heeney et al., 1989) . Feline coronavirus antibody titers were determined by the indirect immunofluorescence test (Evermann et al., 1984) , which has been shown to correlate closely with competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (Fiscus et al., 1985) .",

The most permissive cell types were those derived from domestic cat and included CrFK, Fcwf-4, FC-009, and FEA cells. The two cell lines derived from cheetahs, AjuKid and AjuFib, were less permissive for CPE and virus infectivity than those cells derived from domestic cats. There was a gradient of CPE noted in cells with the FIPV strain 79-1146, the most virulent, followed by FECV 79-1683, FIPV UCD-1, and FIPV UCD4, respectively. The cheetah agent was highly cell-associated and required prolonged incubation (up to 14 days post-infection) before the monolayers showed CPE. The cheetah agent also expressed the most limited host range in that virus was not detected in two of the domestic cat cell lines, FC-009 and FEA cells, and one of the cheetah-derived cell lines (AjuFib). Based on these observations, electron microscopy and imrnunofluorescence were conducted on virus-infected CrFK cells. Routine propagation of the cheetah coronavirus was accomplished by maintenance of the persistently infected cell line, CrFK 834447, and harvesting supematant fluids for attempted isolation of cell-free virus and for Western blotting (to be reported elsewhere, Heeney et al., 1989) .

This limited growth potential (cytopathic effect) in cell culture could be augmented by the addition of trypsin to the growth medium in the absence of serum (Table 1) . It has been well documented that host-cell proteases are essential in the replication of certain viruses, especially during the maturation phase of crucial glycoproteins (Holmes et al., 1987; Sturman et al., 1985; Wellink and VanKammen, 1988) . Trypsin has been used to enhance the plaque-forming capability of bovine coronavirus and has been used to select potential phenotypic markers on strains of transmissible gastroenteritis and feline coronaviruses (Chen, 1985; Chen and Kahn, 1985; McKeiman et al., 1987; Toth, 1982) . Additional studies are required to determine if other factors, such as viral interference by replication-defective mutants, temperature-sensitive mutants, etc., may be controlling the persistent cheetah coronavirus infection in the CrFK cells (Whitaker-Dowling and Youngner, 1987) . The in vitro properties of the cheetah coronavirus (highly cell-associated and reactive by indirect immunofluorescence with UCD-1 antisera) tentatively place it between the non-cell adapted FECV strain, UCD, and the FIPV strain of low to moderate virulence in vitro and in vivo, UCD-1 (Pedersen et al., 1981a; Pedersen and Floyd, 1985) . The cytopathic strains FECV 79-1683 and FIPV 79-1146 demonstrated the widest host range in vitro. Although both of the aforementioned viruses were highly lytic in cell culture, surviving cell populations were demonstrable in cheetah fibroblastic cells (AjuFib) with both strains and in CrFK cells and cheetah kidney (AjuKid) with FECV 79-1683. Characterization of these persistently infected cell cultures is currently underway.",
