Treatment of cells with papaverine strongly inhibited the production of viral RNA and both cellular RNA and DNA. It was found that VSV causes an immediate but transient stimulation of DNA synthesis in HEp-2 cells which is prevented by papaverine treatment. This drug also selectively blocked primary transcription of VSV in vivo and to a lesser extent in vitro RNA polymerase activity of the virion-bound transcriptase. The finding that papaverine has a strong inhibitory effect on viral biosynthesis including early transcription suggests that VSV replication may depend on host factors that regulate intracellular levels of cyclic nucleotides such as CAMP.",

Miller and Carrigan (1982) showed that treatment of neural cells with papaverine. a potent agonist of phosphodiesterase which elevates intracellular CAMP levels, caused a marked but reversible suppression of measles virus growth. Others have found that RNA but not protein synthesis of measles virus can be inhibited by papaverine in neural and non-neural cells (Yoshikawa and Yamanouchi, 1984) .

Under these conditions, there was a rapid and progressive recovery of the viral permissive state with increasing virus yields seen as a function of time after drug removal ( Table 2 ). The kinetics of virus production during the cell recovery period was similar to that of a group of untreated cultures infected at the same time (24 h p.i.) that papaverine was removed from test cultures, indicating that no viral shown). We also tested the effect of known modulators of cyclic nucleotide metabolism for their ability to counteract the viral inhibitory effect of papaverine. The most significant effect was obtained when cells were exposed to cGMP during treatment with drug (Table 3) . Cyclic GMP totally negated the papaverine block of viral replication if it was present during the entire drug treatment period. Inhibition of measles virus growth in vitro by papaverine is similarly antagonized by exogenous addition of cGMP (Miller and Carrigan, 1982) . Although papaverine is known to affect intracellular levels of Ca2+ ions which in turn can regulate phosphodiesterase activity (Carpendo et al., 1975) , we found that altering the calcium concentration of the culture medium had no apparent effect on inhibition of VSV by this drug (data not shown).",

Considering that drug levels greater than 30 PM are toxic for the HEp-2 cells used in this study, this partial inhibition of in vitro viral transcriptase activity obtained suggests that the stronger block of VSV transcription induced in vivo may not necessarily reflect a direct effect of papaverine on viral transcriptive complexes under the conditions used.

Recent studies on the possible role of cyclic nucleotides as modulators of acute and persistent infections with measles virus have established that elevation of CAMP levels either by exogenous addition of this nucleotide (Robbins and Rapp, 1980) or by treatment of cells with papaverine (Miller and Carrigan, 1982; Yoshikawa and Yamanouchi, 1984) renders cells reversibly nonpermissive for measles virus replication. Yoshikawa and Yamanouchi (1984) reported that papaverine blocks measles virus in vitro at the level of viral RNA synthesis although their ability to detect relatively low levels of measles P protein in neural and non-neural cells treated with this drug would indicate that inhibition of viral transcription in this system was not absolute. Other workers have shown that papaverine can selectively inhibit production of intracellular matrix (M) protein in measles infected neural cells without negatively affecting synthesis of other viral structural proteins detected by immunofluorescent staining (Miller and Carrigan, 1982) . it would thus appear that host cell differences influence the extent to which papaverine interferes with virus-specific macromolecular synthesis observed in these systems.",

            "text": "The results of the present investigation contrast with those cited above since we found that VSV biosynthesis, including early transcriptive events, is strongly compromised by papaverine treatment of cells. This profound inhibitory effect parallels that observed in our recent studies on the ability of indomethacin, an antagonist of fatty acid cyclooxygenase, to reversibly block VSV transcription, RNA synthesis and protein synthesis in HEp-2 cells (Mukherjee and Simpson, 1985) . We also recently reported (Mukherjee and Simpson, 1984) that CAMP and specific modulators of cyclic nucleotide metabolism such as theophylline, can partially negate the inhibitory effect of indomethacin which itself can block phosphodiesterase activity at higher concentrations (Flower and Vane, 1974) . It is possible, therefore, that the inhibition of viral transcription in VSV-infected cells treated with either papaverine or indomethacin involves common host factors required for viral mRNA synthesis in vivo. Of relevant interest is our recent discovery of a host membrane protein factor from normal cells that can significantly restore in vitro RNA synthesis of functionally defective viral nucleocapsids recovered from VSV-infected cells treated with indomethacin (Mukherjee and Simpson, in preparation) .Whether this viral transcription enhancing factor can counteract the inhibitory effect of papaverine on VSV remains to be determined.The reversibility of the inhibition of virus replication by papaverine seen in this and other investigations (Miller and Carrigan, 1982; Yoshikawa and Yamanouchi. 1984) indicates that compromised host factors required for productive infections can be restored upon removal of drug. Alternatively, the elevation of intracellular CAMP resulting from exposure of cells to this drug may arrest the cell cycle (Coffin0 et al., 1975) and require a return to normal levels of this nucleotide before cells recover their permissive state for viral replication. That CAMP plays an important role in the inhibitory effects seen in this study is strongly suggested by the ability of cGMP to block papaverine action (Table 3) . However, since papaverine has complex pharmacological and biochemical properties which affect other enzyme systems besides CAMP phosphodiesterase (see Ferrari, 1974) it is entirely possible that the viral inhibitory effect obtained in this study may entail additional cellular targets.The fact that papaverine was found to inhibit both cellular DNA and RNA synthesis without adversely affecting production of host proteins would suggest that translation of existing cellular mRNA species is not blocked by this metabolic antagonist.These experiments also revealed the interesting finding that VSV causes an early stimulation of host DNA synthesis immediately after infection (Fig. 3) . This phenomenon may relate, in part, to the association of VSV-specific leader RNA species with the nuclear compartment recently demonstrated by other workers (Kurilla et al.. 1982) and may possibly represent an obligatory event that occurs prior to the shutoff of host macromolecular synthesis postulated to be caused by these early viral transcripts (Week et al., 1979; McGowan et al., 1982) .",
