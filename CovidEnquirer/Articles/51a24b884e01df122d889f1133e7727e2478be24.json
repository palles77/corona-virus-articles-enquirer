In this work, we studied the homologous recombination of BMV RNA in three different hosts: barley (Hordeum vulgare), Chenopodium quinoa, and Nicotiana benthamiana that were co-infected with two strains of BMV: Russian (R) and Fescue (F). Our work aimed at (1) establishing the frequency of recombination, (2) mapping the recombination hot spots, and (3) addressing host effects. The F and R nucleotide sequences differ from each other at many translationally silent nucleotide substitutions. We exploited this natural variability to track the crossover sites. Sequencing of a large number of cDNA clones revealed multiple homologous crossovers in each BMV RNA segment, in both the whole plants and protoplasts. Some recombination hot spots mapped at similar locations in different hosts, suggesting a role for viral factors, but other sites depended on the host. Our results demonstrate the chimeric ('mosaic') nature of the BMV RNA genome.",

The BMV RNA1 molecule is 3.1 kB long, and it was cloned in two fragments, covering nucleotides 1-1,500 and nts 1495-3190 (Fragments 1 and 2 in Fig. 2 ). The clones were sequenced in both directions, and the sequences aligned with each other as well as with the parental F and R RNA1 sequences. This allowed us to determine the distribution of single nt markers and thus to characterize the recombinants. For N. benthamiana, seventyone clones of Fragment 1 and sixty-eight clones of Fragment 2 were sequenced, demonstrating 8 per cent and 3 per cent of recombinants, respectively (Fig. 2) . Therefore, the entire recombination frequency (RF), defined as the ratio of recombinant clones to the total number of sequenced clones, (see Urbanowicz et al. 2005 ) equaled 11 per cent (or fifteen recombinant clones). The F strain sequences slightly dominated for both fragments. Ten RNA1 recombinants appeared to have a single crossover, but five recombinants had multiple crossovers ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ).",

As shown by the red line in Fig. 2 , there was one region (hot spot II) of elevated recombination activity in the NTPase domain and a slightly increased activity at the 3 0 -noncoding region, observed in N. benthamiana. More meaningful data about the distribution of recombination hot spots in RNA1 ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ) were observed in C. quinoa, the local lesion host. Here, among sixty-seven cDNA clones covering the shorter fragment (Fig. 2) , twenty-one F clones and twelve R clones represented the wt (un-recombined) sequence, showing a dominance of the F strain. In addition, eighteen clones were the recombinant ones yielding an RF of 26 per cent. Similarly, sixty-three clones that covered the larger fragment of RNA1 encompassed twenty-five wt F clones, fourteen wt R clones, and seventeen recombinant clones, corresponding to an RF of 27 per cent. Six recombination hot spots (marked with Roman numerals I through VI), altered with the regions of lower activity (Fig. 2, green line) . Hot spot I covered the 5 0 -noncoding region, hot spots II and III were located within the NTPase domain of protein 1a open reading frame (ORF), hot spot IV mapped within the linker central region of the ORF, and Regions V and VI were within the helicase domain. Interestingly, the 3 0 -noncoding region supported a low level of recombination. Among the regions of elevated activity, the sequence within hot spot II had an RFN of 0.017 per cent, while hot spots V (nts 1979-2273) and VI (nts 2810-2814) had the highest RFNs, above 0.22 per cent.",

Full sequence coverage of RNA2 from N. benthamiana and C. quinoa revealed five regions of increased crossover activity, with Regions II-IV within the 2a (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, RdRp) protein ORF. Interestingly, the GDD RdRp motif was recombinationally silent. Hot spots I and V were in the 5 0 -and 3 0 -UTRs, respectively, with the RFNs higher in hot spot I, reaching the highest value in N. benthamiana (RFN \u00bc 0.175%). Interestingly, all the hot spots mapped to similar regions of RNA2 in all three hosts. The statistical relationship between the RFN data sets for RNA2 was significant for pair of N. benthamiana versus C. quinoa, with correlation coefficient 0.38 and P value 0.0098, differing significantly from other much lower coefficients (Table 1 ). This suggests that RNA2 recombined in a similar way in both hosts. The regions between the hot spots were less active, again located at similar positions for both hosts. For pairs of barley versus C. quinoa and barley versus N. benthamiana, there were lower correlation coefficients and higher P values (Table 1) , likely due to incomplete data from barley.",

Barley protoplasts have been used in the past to study BMV RNA replication (Sivakumaran, Hema, and Kao 2003; Sztuba-Solinska and Bujarski 2008) . Mixtures of F and R BMV RNAs were co-transfected onto barley protoplasts, and the BMV RNA2 and RNA3 components were amplified by RT-PCR, followed by cloning and sequencing. The protoplasts were inoculated with two different ratios (1F to 1R and 3F to 1R ratio) of BMV RNAs. It has been reported previously that the composition of the BMV RNA inoculum influences the recombinant profiles (Kwon and Rao 2012) . To analyze RNA2 recombinants, forty-one clones from the 1F to1R ratio were sequenced and six recombinants were identified, corresponding to an RF of 15 per cent (Fig. 5A, blue line) . For hot spots I, II, and III, the distribution of crossovers followed the patterns found for RNA2 in whole barley plants. The Pearson correlation coefficients for the pairs of barley plants versus 1F to 1R protoplasts and N. benthamiana versus 1F to 1R protoplasts (Table 1) were high (0.437 at P \u00bc 0.023 and 0.652 at P \u00bc 1.21E-06, respectively). However, those for 1F to 1R and 3F to 1R protoplasts correlated to a much lesser extent with the plant hosts. Hot spot Ia (nts 340-484) was much more active in barley protoplasts than in whole plants. Interestingly, both hot spots Ia and V disappeared for the 3F to 1R inoculum ratio (yellow lines). Also, the RF increased to 36 per cent with the 3F to 1R ratio. Overall, these observations not only reveal limited effect of the host on recombinant spots but also suggest some role of the initial availability of viral RNAs for recombination. Three F to R RNA inoculum ratios were also tested for their effect on RNA3 recombination in protoplasts ( Supplementary  Fig. S4 ). For 1F to 1R ratio, seventy clones were sequenced, with an RF of 24 per cent. Both 1F to 3R and 3F to 1R ratios had similar RFs (22 and 20%, respectively) Figure 3 .

However, there were significant differences at hot spots II, III, and IV. Hot spot II had its highest RFN value for 1F to 3R ratio (black line) and the lowest for 3F to 1R ratio (yellow lines). At the intercistronic region (hot spot III), the 1F to 1R ratio (blue line) supported the highest RFN, whereas the 3F to 1R ratio had the lowest RFN. The observed hot spot activity in the intercistronic region confirmed our prior observations (Wierzchoslawski et al. 2003; Wierzchoslawski, Dzianott, and Bujarski 2004) . For hot spot IV, the 3F to 1R ratio had the highest RFN, but the 1F to 3R ratio had no recombinants. Significantly, a central portion of the CP ORF (nts 1350-1598) did not support recombination with any of the three F to R ratios in protoplasts or in whole barley plants. Apparently, there were some constraints, of a mechanistic rather than of a selection-based nature that prevented crossovers at these locations. The correlation coefficients between barley plants and both 1F to 1R and 1F to 3R protoplasts were high (0.520 and 0.580, respectively) at high confidence (P \u00bc 0.039 and P \u00bc 0.019, respectively). Also, the patterns between protoplasts 1F to 1R and 1F to 3R correlated well with each other (0.644 at P \u00bc 0.007). It remains to be demonstrated whether recombination of RNA1 in barley protoplasts is as low as in barley plants (shown in Fig. 2 ).",

In general, the error bars (based on a 95% binomial confidence interval distribution) were large for RFNs in most of the recombination hot spots (see Supplementary Fig. S5 ). This was due to a limited number of cloned and sequenced recombinants. Most likely, their accuracy could be increased with the use of methods of next-generation sequencing (especially RNASeq).",

Similar to RNA1, the recombination rates were higher in C. quinoa and N. benthamiana than in barley, and the patterns of crossovers covered the 5 0 -UTR, some overlapping regions in the 2a ORF, and the proximal portion of the 3 0 -UTR (Figs 3 and  5A) . Interestingly, the rates of crossovers within the tRNA-like structure (distal portion of 3 0 -UTR) were low in all three hosts and also in protoplasts. Although, as in RNA1, the host did affect the rate of crossovers in RNA2, the distribution of crossover spots was affected to a much lesser degree. In fact, good statistical linear correlations were apparent between patterns of crossover sites in C. quinoa versus N. benthamiana, and even stronger correlations with barley protoplasts (Table 1 ). These correlations reveal that recombination in the three different hosts occurs at similar positions, most likely as a viral feature. For RNA3, the recombination sites were generally similar in barley plants and barley protoplasts, again with strong statistical correlations (Table 1) , although in protoplasts some spots depended on the initial F to R ratio in the RNA inoculum (Figs 4  and 5B ). The previously reported hot spot within the intercistronic region was confirmed (Wierzchoslawski et al. 2003; Wierzchoslawski, Dzianott, and Bujarski 2004; Sztuba-Soli\u0144 ska et al. 2012) . Also, the PE region (nts 620-800, Region I, Figs 4 and 5B) has been previously mapped as the CP binding/encapsidation site and found to be a CP-dependent recombination region (Sztuba-Soli\u0144 ska et al. 2012) .

In HIV-1, studies have revealed a clear bias for more frequent recombination inside hairpins than in regions outside hairpin structures (Simon-Loriere et al. 2010) . Our studies show that one large portion of the CP ORF (nts 1350-1598, Figs 4 and 5A) represented a low crossover frequency region in RNA3, in both barley plants and protoplasts. It remains to be determined whether the folding of this region reveals a structural complexity similar to that of recombination-active regions. If yes, then the RNA folding complexity would not be the sole determinant of the crossover frequency. Both host and viral factors may contribute to recombination activity at the hot spots (Knies et al. 2008) . It has been shown that the binding of both CP and replicase proteins to PE and the intercistronic regions of RNA3 affect recombination (Sztuba-Solinska et al. 2012) . For Tobacco bushy stunt virus, various cellular pathways and factors were found to be major drivers of viral recombination in yeast (Nagy 2011), affecting the 'molecular crowdedness' within the viral replicase (Nagy and Pogany 2011) .",

Because this high accuracy was observed both in whole plants as well as in barley protoplasts, this feature seems to be an intrinsic characteristic of viral mechanisms rather than an effect of selection pressure. The high precision was also reported in the CMV/TAV recombination system (Morroni et al. 2013) . At the least, imprecise crossovers must occur at a much lower frequency than precise events.",

A study revealed a dynamic mosaic populations of HIV-1 RNAs, with the rate of homologous exchanges reaching 0.1 per cent per nucleotide (Vuilleumier and Bonhoeffer 2015) . Our results indicate that BMV recombination frequencies are lower by an order of magnitude from that of HIV-1 in each BMV RNA component: 0.016 per cent per nt for RNA1 (highest in C. quinoa), 0.02 per cent per nt for RNA2 (highest in N. benthamiana), 0.02 per cent per nt for RNA3 in barley plants, and 0.01 per cent per nt for RNA3 in barley protoplasts.",

Both mechanisms can recombine functional units. Notable examples in this work include the exchanges between the two BMV RNA3 ORFs, and the exchanges between two functional domains within the 1a protein ORF in RNA1. Extensive crosses between two ORFs in RNA3 were also reported in natural strains of CMV (Nouri et al. 2014) . Such exchanges can reduce the stochastic degradation of already fit RNA populations (Worobey and Holmes 1999; Bedhomme, Hillung, and Elena 2015) .",
