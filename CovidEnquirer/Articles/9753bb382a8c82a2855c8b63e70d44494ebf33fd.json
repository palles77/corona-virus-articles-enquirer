In particular, the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infects nearly all children within the first two years of life [1] , resulting in more than 120,000 hospitalizations annually in the United States. Because immunity after the first infection is not complete, RSV is also a common cause of respiratory morbidity in older children and adults and mortality in the elderly. In addition to the acute care costs, a common sequela of earlylife RSV infection is the development of recurrent wheezing and asthma [2] . A new paramyxovirus genetically related to RSV, the human metapneumovirus (hMPV), has been discovered recently and characterized as a frequent cause of lower respiratory tract infections [3] . Other common viral respiratory pathogens include influenza viruses, rhino-viruses, and adenoviruses. Given the considerable public health burden, it is important to develop relevant disease models using in vitro, in vivo and in silico techniques to better understand the acute and chronic effects of viral infection on the respiratory tract.",

Viral serotypes can be distinguished by the unique hybridization pattern generated by each virus.

Through the study of SARS-CoV mutation patterns, tracing index cases and contacts in human populations is made much easier.

Stronger inflammatory responses developing in the lower respiratory tract early in life might explain why RSV bronchiolitis tends to occur in infants, whereas this infection tends to be restricted to the upper respiratory tract infection in older children and adults.

The epidermal route for vaccine delivery has also been evaluated for RSV vaccination using two G protein-derived molecules attached to a bacterial enterotoxin adjuvant, demonstrating adequate protection against RSV in mice [34] . Another novel prophylactic approach against RSV utilizes chitosan-DNA nanospheres containing a cocktail of plasmid DNAs encoding most RSV antigens, which is suitable for intranasal delivery. Mice treated with these nanospheres have a significant reduction of viral titers and viral antigen load after acute RSV infection [35] . These new prophylactic strategies can increase significantly the availability of vaccines in underdeveloped areas where refrigeration is an issue, as is the availability of sterile syringes and needles. Furthermore, methods derived from in vivo models are probable to be crucial in the future for rapid mass immunization against known and newly emerged airborne biological agents.",
