As of January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) has been notified of 2494 laboratory-confirmed cases with 858 mortalities [2] , with the majority of cases reported from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA), which-at the time of this writing-has a total of 2131 laboratory-confirmed cases with 827 deaths [3] , making the case fatality rate (CFR) 39%. Currently, KSA continues to report MERS-CoV cases on weekly basis, but the overall number of nosocomial transmissions has significantly been reduced [4] [5] [6] [7] . Recently, at the end of December 2019, a cluster of pneumonia cases were reported from Wuhan city, Hubei Province, China, linked to a wet seafood market with a new coronavirus identified as the etiologic agent currently named Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-2) [8, 9] . To date, the virus has rapidly spread causing-at the time of this writing-a total of 50,272 laboratory-confirmed cases and 16 The Global Surveillance Interim guidance by WHO developed [11] the following case definition for suspect case: a patient fulfilling either criteria A or B as detailed in Table 2 .",

But with the lack of standardized and approved point of care testing for MERS-CoV, HCWs continue to be challenged with rapidly detecting and properly isolating patients with MERS-CoV, especially among patients with congestive heart failure (CHF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD) who present with unexplained deterioration of their chronic conditions. This challenge will now be faced by the whole global health community dealing with COVID-19 since the disease tends to be more prevalent and more severe in patients with CHF or CKD. Those patients can present with broad range of signs and symptoms and should now be tested for both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 simultaneously, and with the already wide international spread of SARS-CoV-2, the travel history to China in the last 14 days should be ignored.",
