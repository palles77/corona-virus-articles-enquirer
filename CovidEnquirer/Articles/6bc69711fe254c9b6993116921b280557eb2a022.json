A complete remission (over 2 years) and a partial remission (2 to 5 months) were observed in four (33.3%) and four (33.3%) cases, respectively. Those that survived for more than 2 years were all older cats (6 to 16 years old) with the effusive form of FIP. \u00a9 2004 ESFM and AAFP. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

For the treatment regimen, rFeIFN 1 was initially administered subcutaneously at 1 MU/kg every other day until remission, followed by weekly subcutaneous injections with the same dosage. Glucocorticoid was used either as intrathoracic injection of dexamethasone at 1 mg/kg once, in case of respiratory emergency, followed by oral doses of prednisolone at 2 mg/kg daily gradually tapering to 0.5 mg/kg every other day, or oral prednisolone only from the start.

Case 5 was a 6-year-old spayed female domestic shorthair (DSH) cat presented with difficulty breathing and fever, and diagnosed as the thoracic effusive form of FIP. The FCoV antibody titer was 1:400 with a marginal low normal PCV of 32% and an elevated serum total protein of 10.8 g/dl with a marked polyclonal gammopathy. With rFeIFN at 1 MU/kg every other day and prednisolone at 1 mg/kg PO bid, the pleural effusion disappeared in 1 week.
