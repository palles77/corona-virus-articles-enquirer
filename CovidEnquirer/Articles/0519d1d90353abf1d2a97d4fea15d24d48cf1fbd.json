The recommendation is to use alcohol-based materials such as foam with an alcohol by volume of 60-70%, or if suspected C. difficile, hand washing with vigorous physical manipulation to reduce the amount of spores of pathogens. [4] This must be coupled with Standard Precautions, which involves the use of barriers such as gloves, gowns, masks, and eye wear, in order to prevent in-equal to 5 micrometers), and remain in the air for several hours. Measles and Tuberculosis (TB) among others are transmitted via airborne particles. N95 mask or powered air-purifying respirators are required. [4, 5] Isolation rooms that have high ventilation (several changes in the air system per hour), and negative pressure should also be used. [4, 6] Large particle droplet transmission occurs with vectors such as Haemophilus influenzae, Group A Streptococcus, and Bordetella pertussis among many others. [4] Patients suspected of meningitis or a respiratory infection that does not qualify under airborne should wear a surgical mask, in addition to the provider, and this is usually sufficient to prevent major spread. If able, a separate room or at least an area blocked by curtains is preferred. [5] Contact precautions are used for pathogens infecting mucosal or skin surfaces such as S. aureus, Methicillin Resistant S. Aureus (MRSA), or C. Difficile. Use of protective gowns and gloves is usually sufficient unless suspicion of a higher level of precautions exists. [5] Vaccinating health care personnel against pathogens including, but not limited to, Hepatitis B, Measles, Mumps, Rubella, Pertussis, Varicella, and Seasonal Influenza, is highly efficient in decreasing the risk of transmission of many infectious diseases. [7] This is not a replacement for standard precautions, airborne, droplet, contact precautions, or hand hygiene, but is another measure of safety to undertake. [4] ",

Rapid progression to respiratory failure after day 10. o November 2002 was the first case, and the outbreak, around Southern China, lasted until 2004. o Diagnosis: PCR is available for sputum, urine and stool, but is not fully reliable. Since 2004, there has not been any documented SARS-CoV infection so testing is not available in most places. o Reservoir: likely the Himalayan masked palm civet (Paguma larvata). \u2022 Fully isolate with contact and airborne precautions if SARS-CoV is suspected to have reemerged. \u2022 MERS (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome), MERS-CoV: o 2012 emergence in Saudi Arabia. o Viral pneumonia. o Clinical: Fever, and cough. Severe respiratory distress requiring intubation. More recently, milder cases have been diagnosed, but mortality is 40% in severe cases, especially in patients with comorbidities such as heart disease, and immunosuppression. o Diagnosis: sputum samples and serum should be tested via rapid real-time PCR. Test all suspected cases (significant respiratory symptoms in patients that have traveled to, or reside in, the middle east). o Reservoir: unknown. Possibly bats, or dromedary camels. o Incubation: unknown, estimated at 2-14 days. o Transmission: unknown, but likely similar to SARS-CoV. o Prevention: Use N95 respirator, and maximum contact/airborne precautions, when treating, and in particular, intubating, a patient suspected of MERS-CoV.
