In order to obtain detailed information about the pathogenesis and host immune response in a PEDV-infected host for first In vivo study we used high-throughput sequencing to analyze the gene expression differences of the small intestinal mucosa after infection with PEDV. Transcripts obtained were over 65,525,000 clean reads after reassembly were 22,605 genes detected, of which 22,248 were known genes and 371 new genes were predicted. Moreover, 3168 genes expression was up-regulated and 3876 genes down-regulated. (Gene Ontology) GO annotation and functional enrichment analysis indicated that all of the DEGs (differentially expressed genes) were annotated into biological process, cellular component and molecular function. Most of these unigenes are annotated in cellular processes, the cell and binding. KEGG analysis of the DEGs showed that a total of 7044 DEGs unigenes were annotated into 323 pathways classified into 6 main categories. Most of these unigenes are annotated were related to immune system response to the infectious diseases pathways. In addition, 20 DEGs were verified by quantitative real-time PCR. As the first, in vivo, RNAseq analysis of piglets and PEDV infection, our study provides knowledge about the transcriptomics of intestinal mucosa in PEDV-infected piglets, from which a complex molecular pathways and pathogenesis-related biological processes are involved in PEDV interaction with piglet intestinal mucosa.",

            "text": "Proteomic analysis by Zeng et al. [3] showed that many changes in protein expression were present in PEDV infected Vero cells. These proteins are involved in the regulation of apoptosis, signal transduction and the stress response. Moreover, Kim et al. [4] showed that the apoptosis induced by PEDV infection mainly activates the intracellular caspase-dependent mitochondrial apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) signaling pathway. PEDV infection can also cause intracellular MAPK signaling including ERK (extracellular signaling-regulated kinase), p38 MAPK and JNK (c-Jun N-terminal kinase) activation [5, 6] . Therefore, the proliferation of PEDV will stimulate a variety of signaling pathways, such as apoptosis [4] , stress response, making cells provide a microenvironment conducive to PEDV proliferation, and the induction of cellular pathological changes [6] . Most research on PED has focused on pathogen isolation and identification, genomic and structural protein analysis, diagnosis and vaccine development [7] ; however, the detailed molecular mechanisms of viral pathogenesis remain unclear. The results of a virus infection are mainly determined by the interaction between the virus and the innate immune system [8] . Therefore, understanding how the virus interacts with the innate immune system of the host is essential to understand the molecular mechanisms of viral pathogenesis. In addition, PEDV infection not only causes ER stress and activates NF-\u03baB [6, 9] . Furthermore, it has been reported that stable expression of PEDV N and E proteins in porcine intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) can activate NF-\u03baB and upregulate the expression of IL-8 [10] . Ding et al. [11] reported that transient expression of PEDV N protein could inhibit NF-\u03baB activation in HEK-293T cells. However, the exact mechanism that regulates NF-\u03baB activity during PEDV infection remains to be elucidated.",

PEDV was isolated from the previously infected piglets in Anhui Province, and subsequently achieved in the laboratory. Piglets were divided into two groups (n = 6); the first group were infected with 10 mL of 10 6.62 copies/\u03bcL of PEDV using 9 mm French tube with syringe at the end. Second group was the controls (n = 4), which were fed with 10 mL of culture medium. After infection, we monitored the time of onset of diarrhea and other symptoms of PED and data were recorded. After 6 h of PED symptoms were detected, the pigs were euthanized, and the inner wall of the small intestine was flushed with sterile PBS solution and sections of the small intestinal mucosa were scraped with a sterile glass slide for RNA sequencing.",

Cao et al.

Reports have shown that Bcl-2 expression is also by NF-\u03baB [23] . As an anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-xl/Bcl-2l1 protein can directly inhibit channel activity by binding to VDAC on the mitochondrial membrane to stabilize it, inhibit cytochrome C release and block activation of the caspase family of proteins, and thus achieve the purpose of anti-apoptotic action; it can also inhibit Fas and Fas-mediated apoptosis [24] . The results of this study are consistent with the above findings wherein we demonstrated that PEDV infects the host and activated the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway and subsequently, up-regulated the expression of Bcl-2L1 pathway which play a role in resisting apoptosis after PEDV infection.",

            "text": "In our study, interferon (IFN) response was significantly high and is considered to be the first line of defense against all vertebrate-borne viral infections [25, 26] . Interferon activates NK and dendritic cells (DCs) to activate the adaptive immune system [27] . Moreover, interferons exerts its antiviral activity by inducing the expression of IFNinducible antiviral effectors [28] , such as IGS15 and MX1. Among them IGS15 inhibits virus replication by enhancing the activity of the JAK/ STAT1 signaling pathway [29] or directly modifying the viral proteins [30] . Due to the wide distribution of IFNGR1/2 most cell types respond to IFN-\u03b3, thereby IFN-\u03b3 produces pleiotropic effects on immune cells and limited direct antiviral activity [31] . In this study, the high expression of IFN-\u03b3observed in the intestinal mucosa of piglets infected with PEDV may indicate that IFN-\u03b3plays an important defensive role against PEDV infection, this is consistent with above finding. Hence, our data suggest that infected piglets have shown to produce antiviral responses through multiple pathways.",

IL-1 (\u03b1/\u03b2) is mainly produced by macrophages and all nucleated cells which plays a role in transmitting activation signals. When cells are stimulated by IL-1, PI3 forms a complex with IL-1 and IL-1R1 to regulate the inflammatory response through intracellular signal transduction and activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway. The results of our study showed that the increased expression of IL-1 (\u03b1/\u03b2) might inhibit the expression of IL-1R1 by activating certain pathways, this observation makes it more important to study the role of PEDV infection in modulation of immune system in piglets.",

Xue et al.[34] found that recombinant mature pIL-22 (mpIL-22) inhibited alpha coronavirus replication such as PEDV, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine rotavirus (PoRV). In our study, the expression of IL-22 in porcine intestinal mucosa after PEDV infection was increased by 6.1 times compared with the mock infection. Thus, when PEDV infects piglets, the body's immune system expresses a large quantity of IL-22 against the virus. IL-18 is a known cytokine that improves T cell proliferation and enhances NK and CTL activity [46-49] and induces IFN production",
