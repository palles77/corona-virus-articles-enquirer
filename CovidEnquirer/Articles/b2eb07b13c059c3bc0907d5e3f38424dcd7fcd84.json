Droplet, air, contaminated fomites, and rodent pests have been proposed to be mechanisms for transmitting SARS in a short period. We studied nasopharyngeal viral load of SARS patients on admission and their geographic distribution. Higher nasopharyngeal viral load was found in patients living in adjacent units of the same block inhabited by the index patient, while a lower but detectable nasopharyngeal viral load was found in patients living further away from the index patient. This pattern of nasopharyngeal viral load suggested that airborne transmission played an important part in this outbreak in Hong Kong. Contaminated fomites and rodent pests may have also played a role.",

The number of cases worldwide has reached >8,000 with 774 deaths within a period of 9 months (1). A community outbreak affected 321 residents of a densely populated housing estate, the Amoy Gardens in Hong Kong, from March 20 to April 15, 2003 (2) . This housing estate consists of 19 high-rise apartment blocks (A-S). Each block has 33 floors and 8 units per floor. Residents from 15 blocks were affected. The mechanism of the spread of SARS in Amoy Gardens has remained enigmatic. The suggestion has been made that virus-laden aerosols were forced from the sewage system by negative pressure of an exhaust fan in an airshaft into the dried U trap of the toilet in the bathroom of the index patient (3). Results of another study in which computer modeling was carried out without virologic proof suggested that these contaminated aerosols were spread by natural air currents to other apartment units (4) . Other means of spread might have been droplet transmission among residents or by rodent pests (5) .",

We analyzed the distribution of the initial SARS-CoV viral load by quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of nasopharyngeal aspirates of the first 79 SARS patients from Amoy Gardens admitted to our hospital.

The initial nasopharyngeal load of patients was highly correlated with the distance in relation to the block of the index patient (Spearman \u03c1 -0.63, p<0.001, Figure 4 ). The percentage of specimens with a negative nasopharyngeal viral load in each block in order of patient distance from block E was as follows: block E (4/52) 7.7%; block D (4/7) 57.1%; block F (2/2) 100%; block C (1/6) 15.2%; block G (2/2) 100%; block A (1/1) 100%; block B (2/6) 33.3%; and block H (1/1) 100% (p = 0.04 by chi-square test). Subgroup analysis showed that patients in E7 and E8 had the highest median viral load, 6.80 and 5.98 log 10 copies/mL, respectively. Patients from these 2 units also accounted for 12.7% and 31.6% of the total number of patients, respectively. This pattern of distribution is strongly affected by the distance of the patients' units from the index patient (Figures 2 and 4) . On the basis of a visual inspection of the layout of the units (Figure 2 ), the direction in which patients' flats faced may also have influenced the viral load; patients in flats that faced away from the index patient's unit had a lower viral load.",

Amoy Gardens was placed under active surveillance during the SARS outbreak and the residents underwent frequent examinations. They were admitted to the hospital soon after any symptom of SARS developed, and nasopharyngeal specimens were collected at an early stage. Variation in collection time cannot explain the viral load distribution. The size of the viral inocula may have progressively decreased downstream. A recent study has demonstrated in mice that SARS-CoV viral load in the respiratory tract is proportional to viral inocula administered intranasally (6) . Similarly, the degree of viremia is related to the size of the viral inoculum in HIV and hepatitis C virus infections in various models (9, 10) . Three patients from E7 and 12 patients from E8 had a higher viral load and more severe disease than the index patient in E7 (Figure 3 ). This finding can be explained by the fact that secondary case-patients had probably received higher viral inocula through droplets or close contact (11) (12) (13) (14) . The viral load gradually decreased in tertiary patients who lived further from the index case; dilution factors may have had an effect. Moreover, the shape of the U trap and the warm aerosol generated from the bathroom of the index patient caused the aerosol to circulate upwards, which may explain why only the upper floors of E7 were initially affected. Subsequently the virus-laden aerosols cooled and sank. At the same time, the virus was carried by a southwestward wind to E8 and other parts of Amoy Gardens. This scenario accounted for the higher rate and more widespread distribution of SARS patients in E8 than E7.",

In more distant transmission, airborne spread, contaminated fomites, and rodent pests can spread this disease (4, 5, 16) . The initial viral load pattern in our study may help explain the different mechanisms involved in transmitting SARS in this outbreak. The highest nasopharyngeal viral load was detected in patients residing in E7 and E8, which were near the unit inhabited by the index patient. Direct contact transmission with the index patient and droplet spread by cough may have occurred among patients living in block E. Rodent pests may have spread the virus in the same block or even to distant blocks. Transmission by contaminated fomites such as elevator door knobs or door handles would also lead to spread among patients in the same block.",

However, more patients and higher viral load were found in patients living in block D than block F, in block C than block G, and in block B than blocks A and H, even though they were a similar distance from the index block (Figure 2 ). The attack rate was highest in block E, which accounted for 41% of the 321 SARS cases in Amoy Gardens, followed by block C (15%), block B (13%), and block D (13%). The remaining cases (18%) were distributed in 11 other blocks (2). This distribution pattern can be explained by airborne transmission as virus-laden aerosols circulated inside the complex and were driven by a southwestward wind from block E to blocks D, C, and B (4). Meteorologic data from The Hong Kong Observatory, Hong Kong Special Administrative Region showed that the prevailing wind direction on March 14 and March 19, 2003 was from the southwest. This pattern is consistent with a hypothesis of airborne transmission (17) . Patients living in block D had a lower viral load than those in blocks B and C, even though they lived closest to the index patient. They may have been protected by a nearby construction site ( Figure  2 ), which created a shield against the virus-laden draft. Patients from E7 living on floors 15-20 had higher viral loads than those living above or below them ( Figure 3A ). This distribution may be the result of a dilution effect as the virus-laden plume rose from the middle floors to the higher floors. Nonetheless, the airborne hypothesis is not possible to prove because simultaneous air sampling and analysis of the SARS viral load was not carried out.",
