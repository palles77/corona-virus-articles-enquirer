Results: Annual peaks in NHS Direct cough and difficulty breathing calls occurred in late December, with peaks in 'cold/flu' and fever calls occurring between November and April.

Conclusions: It is estimated that respiratory viruses, notably influenza and RSV, are responsible for at least 50% of the seasonal variation in NHS Direct respiratory calls.

Published work about NHS Direct 'respiratory' calls suggests that some of the temporal variation may be related to the seasonality of influenza. 3 Many other pathogens (viral and bacterial) may cause respiratory disease, however, and the relative contribution of these pathogens to NHS Direct calls has not been estimated. Describing and quantifying the burden of respiratory disease is necessary to identify health priorities and provide evidence to support future research and development.",

NHS Direct call centre data have been monitored for surveillance purposes since 2001 (the NHS Direct Syndromic Surveillance System 4 ) in order to provide early warning of a rise in community morbidity. Syndromic surveillance systems use a variety of pre-diagnostic data sources (e.g. ambulance encounters, 5 A&E admissions, 6 pharmacy sales, 7 calls to health helplines 4 in an attempt to identify outbreaks and incidents of public health importance. Although NHS Direct syndromic data have alerted public health teams to national or local rises in illness 4 there is no mechanism for routine microbiological confirmation of the cause of NHS Direct calls about presumed infections. Comparison of trends in NHS Direct calls against laboratory reports may, therefore, help elucidate a likely cause of NHS Direct respiratory calls, and help interpret surveillance trends.",

This method uses a regression model to estimate how the seasonal variation in laboratory reports is reflected within the variation in NHS Direct calls. Linear regression models assume that the relationship between the dependent and explanatory variables is linear and that the model errors are distributed normally and do not exhibit serial correlation. A constant number of NHS Direct calls due to other infectious or non-infectious disease (other causes) was assumed within each model. Variables that contributed little to the model were removed by backward stepwise regression. This technique gradually removes the variable that causes the smallest reduction in R 2 (goodness of fit of the model) until removal of a further variable causes a significant reduction in R 2 (by the F-test). Once non-significant variables were removed, any remaining significant variables with negative coefficients were also removed from the model as it was considered biologically implausible that they negatively influence the number of NHS Direct calls. The model was then re-estimated with the remaining variables (Model1). Possible model misspecification was tested by constructing alternative models to examine the changes in coefficients of the final model (Model1) to sequential deletion of significant variables. Model residuals were examined for autocorrelation.",

            "text": "Annual peaks in NHS Direct cough and difficulty breathing calls occurred in late December, whereas peaks in cold/flu and fever calls were less predictable and occurred between November and April. The regression models estimated that at least half of the seasonal variation in NHS Direct respiratory calls was due to the seasonality of influenza and RSV. During short lived winter periods, influenza and RSV accounted for half of the NHS Direct calls about cold/ flu, cough and fever. Rhinovirus accounted for a tenth of cold/flu and cough calls, distributed evenly throughout the year, with parainfluenza estimated to account for a quarter of cough calls (0e4 years) during spring. The main bacterial cause of NHS Direct respiratory calls was S. pneumoniae, with an estimated year round contribution, peaking during mid-winter. The cough models demonstrated the importance of incorporating a bank holiday factor when modelling NHS Direct call data and provide evidence that closure of GP surgeries during bank holidays stimulates acute demand for NHS Direct: a third of all cough calls during Christmas week were accounted for by this bank holiday effect. Although a good fit was achieved for the final cold/flu, fever and cough models, methodological problems were encountered. Dropping variables with negative coefficients from the models before re-estimating is an inelegant approach to multiple linear regression. Resulting bias due to this is considered negligible, however, as the removal of these variables did not greatly alter the values of the significant positive coefficients (e.g. RSV, influenza, S. pneumoniae) in the final models. The statistical models described here use laboratory data which are subject to case ascertainment bias. For example, common causes of respiratory infections (e.g. coronavirus, 13 and human metapneumovirus 14 ) that peak during winter, are rarely tested for and are therefore present in low numbers within LabBase. These pathogens do contribute to the intercept (other causes), however, and are therefore implicitly included within our models. Consequently, over estimation of the contribution of significant variables (e.g. RSV, influenza, and S. pneumoniae) is considered negligible.",

Finally, the two winters covering the study period were characterised by low levels of influenza activity. 22, 23 The estimated contribution of influenza to NHS Direct respiratory calls, 13e22% during our study, is dependent on epidemiological conditions and would be greater during years with more virulent strains of influenza.",

            "text": "The weekly estimates of the contribution of different pathogens to NHS Direct respiratory calls will provide greater confidence in interpreting sudden rises in calls detected through syndromic surveillance. For example, a sharp rise in cold/flu calls from adults and/or rise in fever calls about children may represent an increase in influenza circulating in the community. A rise in cough calls during November/December may indicate a rise in RSV and also influenza; a rise during January to March suggest only influenza; and a rise during spring may indicate a rise in parainfluenza infections. The use of this intelligence within the NHS Direct syndromic surveillance system will complement other primary care surveillance systems: the weekly returns service of the RCGP 10 and the newly established Q-Research system. 24 These pathogen specific estimates may also be of use for NHS winter planners in managing elective hospital admissions and in informing the health service of impending problems. Similarly, analysis of emergency department respiratory syndrome data in the US suggests these data could be a useful early indicator of influenza and RSV circulation. 25 This work has provided a detailed weekly picture of the type of respiratory infections, throughout the year, that cause people to phone NHS Direct. This has implications for the advice offered by NHS Direct nurses in handling respiratory calls (currently 8% of total symptomatic calls). The supporting clinical advice and rationales within the decision support system used by NHS Direct nurses (NHS CAS) can be modified to reflect awareness of the prevailing respiratory infections. For example, this would include specific advice on seeking urgent help in the event of RSV being the likely cause of significant acute respiratory impairment in a child (bronchiolitis).",
