While these methods are relatively sensitive and specific for pathogen detection, they have several limitations, including the long time to acquire results, high technicality, and costly equipment such as a thermal cycler (Yang and Rothman, 2004; Barken et al., 2007; Mori and Notomi, 2009; Huang et al., 2006) . Additionally, multiplex detection techniques, which detect two or more targets simultaneously in a single reaction, are required to distinguish the target pathogen from similar family members and offers reduced time and reagent costs (Brinkmann et al., 2017; Chung et al., 2013) . Multiplex detection techniques are critical for rapid diagnostics; however, self-inhibition and false-positive results caused by primer dimerization (from a primer-target template mismatch or primer itself) can reduce detection sensitivity and specificity in clinical applications. To overcome the limitations of multiplex detection, a solid-phase DNA amplification technique was developed by grafting both forward and reverse primers. However, the amplification efficiency of the grafting primer assay was approximately 90% lower than that of conventional PCR in solution (Adessi et al., 2000; Fedurco et al., 2006; Shendure and Ji, 2008) . Thus, the solid-phase DNA amplification technique has not been widely explored for applications in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bios.2018.08.007 Received 21 May 2018; Received in revised form 24 July 2018; Accepted 7 August 2018 pathogen diagnostics. These limitations have made it difficult to apply diagnostic methods in hospitals. Resolving these limitations will require the development of diagnostic methods that are easy-to-use, accurate, and rapid for use in hospitals.",

An isothermal amplification enzyme and oligonucleotide primers were immobilized on a silicon microring resonator (SMR) for specific detection of target nucleic acids from emerging infectious pathogens, such as MERS-CoV, Zika, and Ebola. In this study, rather than applying the amplified target and probe hybridization assay, we established long (> 50 base pair, bp) oligonucleotide primers at a high concentration (5 \u03bcM) to create an arch shape on the sensor surface for solid-phase amplification, thus overcoming primer dimerization. The SMR sensor allows for sensitive, label-free, and real-time sensing (Kim et al., 2018; Koo et al., 2017) , and the long primers at a high concentration greatly increased the rate and detection sensitivity of this method. For nucleic acid amplification, we used a recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) enzyme, which requires a small instrument for isothermal amplification (Piepenburg et al., 2006) . Using the archshaped sensing platform, we detected RNA from human coronavirus (HCoV), MERS-CoV, ZIKA, and EBOV with high sensitivity and specificity. The detection limit was 10-fold more sensitive than that of realtime reverse transcription-PCR. Furthermore, this multiple-target sensing platform rapidly (< 20 min) detected MERS-CoV in 20 clinical specimens, including MERS-CoV and HCoV infections. Therefore, the arch-shaped multiple-target sensing platform can be used to rapidly identify pathogens in various clinical applications.",

            "text": "To use the arch-shaped multiple-target sensing platform as a multiple detection system, we structured the SMR sensor as previously described (Kim et al., 2018; Koo et al., 2017) . For arch-shaped amplification and detection with specific primers immobilized on the sensor, a three-step primer modification was required on the surface of the sensing chip. First, amine group modification using 3-aminopropyltriethoxysiane (APTES, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) was performed on the sensing surface. Subsequently, the sensors were treated with oxygenated plasma and soaked in a solution of 2% APTES in a mixture of ethanol-H 2 O (95:5, v/v) for 2 h, followed by thorough rinsing with ethanol and deionized (DI) water. Second, carboxyl group modification was conducted using glutaraldehyde (GAD, Sigma-Aldrich) as a linker. The sensors were cured by heating to 120\u00b0C for 15 min. Next, the sensors were incubated with 2.5% GAD in DI water containing 5 mM sodium cyanoborohydride (Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 h, rinsed with DI water, and dried under a nitrogen stream. Third, both forward and reverse primers were immobilized to target specific primers containing the 5\u2032 amino-modifier C12. The pretreated sensor was prepared by overnight incubation at room temperature in a 5 or 10 \u03bcM solution of forward and reverse primers containing 5 mM sodium cyanoborohydride. After incubation, unbound target specific primers were removed by washing with phosphate-buffed saline and the sensors were dried using nitrogen. The prepared sensor chip was stored at room temperature until further use. To test the target amplification and detection in the primer immobilized sensor chip, recombinase polymerase amplification-reverse transcription (RPA-RT, TwistDx, Cambridge, UK) containing 29.5 \u03bcL of rehydration buffer, 15 \u03bcL of RNase inhibitor and water, 2 \u03bcM of DTT, recombinase, polymerase enzyme, and 2.5 \u03bcL of magnesium acetate solution. To start the reaction, 10 \u03bcL of RPA-RT solution and 5 \u03bcL of target RNA were mixed. Next, 15 \u03bcL of this mixture was added to the sensor chip with an acrylic well surrounding the microring sensor area. Additionally, mineral oil was added to prevent evaporation of the mixture during amplification. The arch-shaped multiple-target sensor assay was operated at a constant temperature (43\u00b0C). The sensor consists of four rings connected to a common input and separate dedicated output waveguides. One of the four microrings was used as a reference sensor to monitor temperature-induced drift. The 3 remaining microrings were used for sensing three targets (MERS, EBOV, ZIKV) with a vertical grating coupler. For multiple target monitoring, each dedicated output waveguide corresponding to the microring immobilized different target specific primer was measured sequentially by moving the optical fiber. The tunable laser emits light at wavelengths of 1550-1580 nm (EXFO IQS-2600B, Quebec, Canada). To obtain a baseline as a reference, the resonance wavelength was immediately measured. The resonance wavelength shift for multiple target detection was then measured every 5 min for up to 30 min to monitor the arch-shaped amplification of MERS, ZIKV, EBOV, and HCoV RNAs in a label-free and real-time manner.",

As such, primers were designed that were 10, 20, and 30 bp longer than the conventional primers. Different lengths of MERS primers for detecting MERS and HCoV were immobilized to the microring on the SMR sensor. Subsequently, primers of suitable length for detecting MERS, ZIKV, EBOV, and HCoV were immobilized on the microring resonance sensors. For multiplexing experiments, we used an ultra-small dosage dispensing system with sciFLEXARRAYER SX (SCIENION AG, Monmouth Junction, NJ, USA) to avoid cross-contamination. Subsequently, droplets of other target specific primers solutions were dispensed to the microring at desired locations. Because a smaller amount of primer volume was used than in the previous method, a higher concentration of primer solution was used. Finally, the resonance wavelength shift by products of archshaped amplification was measured on the microring.",

Design of arch-shaped multiple-target sensing platform Fig. 1 shows the design of the arch-shaped multiple-target sensing platform for rapid diagnosis of emerging infectious pathogens, such as MERS-CoV, HCoV, ZIKV, and EBOV, using a SMR sensor. We established a series of primers for target amplification and simultaneous detection of specific multiple-targets rather than asymmetric amplification on a SMR sensor lacking multiple target detection (Kim et al., 2018; Koo et al., 2017) . For multiple-target sensing, the SMR surface was first amine-modified with APTES and linked to the NH 2 -modified 5\u2032-end of both primers. Second, both primers (forward and reverse) of a target were immobilized on the SMR sensor surface. Immobilization of both primers reduces non-specific target binding and false-positives due to primer-dimerization, which leads to the production of non-specific amplicons in the solution. To form an arch-shaped template on the surface, we used longer primers containing non-specific poly dT spacers (Shin et al., 2014) . The pair of primers for a single target was immobilized on an individual sensor using a spotting system Array of silicon microring resonator (SMR) sensors for multiple-target detection. Each microring was modified with specific primers (forward and reverse) of MERS-CoV (blue), ZIKV (red), and EBOV (purple) recognizable target sequences. (B) Scheme representation of the principle of arch-shaped amplification and detection assay. First, SMR sensors with specific primers immobilized to detect target RNA were prepared. Next, a mixture containing recombinase polymerase amplification-reverse transcription (RPA-RT) reagent and target extracted RNA was added to the platform (#1). During the reaction, RNA was synthesized by the RPA-RT enzyme mixture in an isothermal state (43\u00b0C) as cDNA and either recombinase/ forward (red arrow) primer or recombinase/ reverse (blue arrow) primer complexes bound to double-stranded target cDNA and facilitated strand exchange at a constant temperature. After the displaced strand formed a D-loop by gp32 (sky blue), the immobilized primers were extended by polymerase (green) on the sensor surface (#2). The extended primers formed an arch-shaped amplification complex in the same microring and continued amplification (#3). Target detection was monitored in real-time by measuring the resonant wavelength shift by arch-shaped amplified products on the solid surface.",

To produce a copy of the hybridized template, RPA enzyme (including Taq polymerase) was activated to amplify the target template on the sensor surface. The attached forward primer bound the template, which could also bind to the attached reverse primer and form additional arch-shaped copies near the initial copies. Finally, we used an SMR sensor, which is a rapid and highly sensitive system for evaluation in a real-time and label-free manner, for the signal readout from multiple sensors.

Asymmetric amplification (one primer immobilized on a solid surface) generated one of the strands from the target template, and thus the detection sensitivity was less than that of symmetric amplification (Fedurco et al., 2006) . Therefore, to overcome the limitations of solid surface amplification methods, the size and concentration of the attached primers should exceed the critical value for efficient amplification on the solid surface. To optimize the primer protocol for multiple-targets, T7 RNA transcripts from a MERS-CoV sample were prepared for the model pathogen. We examined different primer lengths, including a nonspecific oligo-dT sequence, to determine the optimal primer length. The resonance wavelength of 54-bp primers was found to have shifted significantly compared to other primer sizes (Fig. 2 A) . Moreover, we determined the concentration of the attached primers (5 \u03bcM) (Fig. 2B) . A primer concentration of 1 pM resulted in asymmetric amplification, indicating that this concentration was not suitable for the arch-shaped multiple-target sensing platform. Even high concentrations (10 \u03bcM) of attached primers could not discriminate between target and non-target templates (Fig. 2B) .

A series of target primers from three pathogens, specifically MERS-CoV, ZIKV, and EBOV, was immobilized to the individual sensor with the spotting machine, which can immobilize the primer in a specific area (Fig. 3A) . Using the specific attached primers for MERS-CoV, the amplified MERS-CoV RNA was detected with low background signals from other pathogens (Fig. 3B) . Similarly, primers for other pathogens showed high specificity with low non-target binding (Fig. 3B) . Additionally, when mixed virus (MERS and HCoV) samples were used, the resonance wavelength shift of the MERS-specific primer immobilized on the platform was 560.71 \u00b1 28.51 pm when only MERS (2.5 \u00d7 10 4 copies/reaction) virus was present and was 572.98 \u00b1 11.05 pm when both MERS (2.5 \u00d7 10 4 copies/reaction) and HCoV (1.5 \u00d7 10 4 copies/reaction) viruses were present. The resonance wavelength analysis clearly detected the target RNA in the mixed virus samples, which showed similar results to the use of the single virus sample ( Supplementary Fig. S4 ). Indeed, a rapid, high-sensitivity, and high-specificity platform for multiple-target detection is needed for emerging pathogen diagnosis. The arch-shaped multiple-target sensing platform enables rapid and accurate pathogen genotyping.",

To optimize the multiple-target sensing for MERS-CoV prior to use in clinical samples, T7 of in vitro-transcribed MERS-CoV and HCoV-OC43 RNA was prepared. Two sensing microrings for the MERS-CoV and HCoV primers were in the same waveguide. Subsequently, the RNA template of either MERS-CoV or HCoV was added onto the platform (Fig. 4A-B) .

For clinical testing (sensitivity and specificity) of the multiple-target sensing platform, we added RNA from MERS-CoV patients into the platform, which included immobilized primers with either MERS-CoV or HCoV on an individual sensing ring. The wavelength shifted to higher than 220.83 pm in the MERS-CoV sensing ring; however, the wavelength shifted to lower than 146.24 pm in the HCoV-OC43 sensing ring.

However, the amplification efficiency of these methods is too low for clinical use (Adessi et al., 2000; Fedurco et al., 2006; Shendure and Ji, 2008) . In this study, we developed a method for enhancing the sensitivity of solid-phase amplification approaches by using an optimal length (about 50 bp) and concentration (5 \u03bcM) of oligonucleotide primers within the SMR sensor. Using this platform, inhibition due to primer-dimerization can be prevented during multiple-target detection. Further, we performed diagnostic and identification testing on the platform using several emerging infectious pathogens, such as MERS-CoV, HCoV, ZIKV, and EBOV. We compared the arch-shaped multipletarget sensing platform results to those obtained by PCR (Table 2) . Based on the results, the platform showed high accuracy for detecting all pathogen types identified by PCR. Additionally, the detection limit of the platform was superior to that of the conventional method. Therefore, this method can be used for early diagnosis and identification of pathogens in low-level pathogen samples. This platform has advantages over the isothermal, PCR, and bio-optical sensing systems, particularly in terms of time (< 20 min) and label-free detection. Furthermore, the clinical utility of the platform for identifying multiple pathogens in clinical samples is useful for overcoming the limitations of conventional approaches. Further in-depth studies to maximize the clinical ability of the platform in larger prospective clinical trials are needed. Therefore, the arch-shaped multiple-target sensing platform can be used for rapid diagnosis and identification of pathogens in various clinical applications. NT: Not tested.",
