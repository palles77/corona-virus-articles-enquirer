A hospitalized patient with health care-associated pneumonia based on clinical and radiological evidence. 3. A person with (1) acute febrile (\u226538\u00b0C) illness (2) body aches, headache, diarrhea, or nausea/ vomiting, with or without respiratory symptoms and (3) unexplained leucopenia (white blood cell count [WBC] <3.5\u00d710 9 /L) and thrombocytopenia (platelets <150\u00d710 9 /L). 4 . A person (including health care workers) who had protected or unprotected exposure to a confirmed or probable case of MERS CoV infection and who presented with upper or lower respiratory illness within 2 weeks after exposure. Although Saudi Arabia is a hub for the Makkah and Madinah cities, which are visited by millions of pilgrims from around the world, studies do not show increased patient numbers, indicating a low infection rate. The reported mortality rate is around 30% to 40%. 4 There are already reports on the spread of MERS CoV in Europe and North America. 5 No definite data exist regarding its mode of transmission. Multiple zoonotic transmissions from animal reservoirs leading to human infection have been suggested; in particular, the camel as a reservoir for the virus has been postulated. [6] [7] [8] Isolation and sequencing of MERS CoV obtained from a dromedary camel and from a patient who died of laboratory-confirmed MERS CoV infection after close contact with camels have been reported. 9 There are no guidelines on the treatment of MERS CoV infection. Animal data suggest that the treatment of MERS CoV-infected rhesus macaques with interferon-a2b and ribavirin reduces virus replication, moderates the host response, and improves clinical outcomes. 10 A case series of 5 critically ill patients with a late diagnosis of MERS CoV infection who were treated with IFN-a2b and ribavirin did not show any benefit. 11 Omrani et al 12 reported that treatment with ribavirin and pegylated IFN-a2a significantly improves survival 14 days after the diagnosis of MERS CoV infection (P=.004). Enhanced survival 28 days after diagnosis in patients who received ribavirin and pegylated IFN-a2a was not statistically significant (P=.054). 12 The King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center is the major tertiary care institute in the country. We report a single-institute experience of patients with MERS CoV infection, its outcomes in infected individuals, the treatment response to ribavirin and IFN-a2b, and its potential transmission to immediate contacts.",
