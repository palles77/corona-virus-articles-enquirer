Worldwide, the annual influenza epidemics are estimated to result in approximately 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and approximately 250 000 to 500 000 deaths [2] . Among hospitalized patients, antiviral therapy is most efficacious if started within 48 hours of influenza illness onset [1, [3] [4] [5] . Nonetheless, some studies have demonstrated that antiviral treatment is still beneficial in hospitalized patients when started 4 and 5 days after illness onset [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . Current available antiviral treatments include the neuraminidase inhibitors ([NAIs] inhaled zanamivir, oral oseltamivir, and intravenous peramivir) and M2 ion channel blockers (amantadine and rimantadine). However, all currently circulating strains of influenza are adamantane-resistant, and therefore this class is not recommended for the prevention or treatment of influenza [13] . The NAI peramivir is given intravenously, and so it offers potential advantages in the management of severe hospitalized influenza. Indeed, NAI peramivir was used to treat critically ill patients during the 2009 pandemic under emergency use authorization by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) [14, 15] and, it received FDA approval to treat acute uncomplicated influenza patients [16] [17] [18] .",

Virological measurements include detection and quantification of shed virus by viral culture or quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Virologic endpoints that are typically assessed, as secondary endpoints, in clinical studies of novel antivirals include baseline viral RNA copy number or infectious viral titer during the baseline visit and change in viral RNA copy number or titer over the course of illness [16] [17] [18] 21] . Quantitation of viral RNA by molecular techniques is a standard and sensitive method for VL determination. Cell-based assays are more labor intensive but have the advantage of detecting the infectious virus particles. Regulators preclude virology from being a primary endpoint because they feel that there is insufficient correlation between viral titers and change in titers with clinical symptoms. Furthermore, there is significant variability in viral shedding from patient to patient. Lastly, there is a lack of standardization in the collection of samples and location (eg upper vs lower respiratory tract) and assays for virologic measurements [21] .",

The A/Aichi/ 2/1968 (H3N2) influenza strain (cultured in MDCK cells) was used as a positive control in every experiment (in 7 replicates).

This kit is a high-sensitivity ATP-monitoring one-step addition assay kit for the quantification of viable cells.

Pearson's product-moment correlation coefficient and the sample means were estimated using a left-censored bivariate normal likelihood-based approach as proposed by Lyles et al [29] . Figures were generated using R (version 3.0.2). Confidence bands for linear trend were calculated by sampling the bivariate normal distribution and were based on the regression coefficients for intercept and slope as well as their covariance matrix (n = 5000).",

The study enrolled 150 influenza-infected, hospitalized patients during the 2012-2013 influenza season. Serial assessment of viral shedding was studied with both molecular and cell culture methods. These 2 methods were highly co-linear, although the rate of decay of cell culture-based infectious viral titer was faster than that observed with molecular methods. This study documented a clear decreasing ratio of influenza RNA copy number to infectious viral titer of the patients over time. Clinical diagnosis has limitations because ILI symptoms are not specific for influenza virus infection and can be caused by other respiratory pathogens. Influenza VL decay, which quantifies infectious and noninfectious viral particles over time, and TCID 50 decay, which quantifies only the infectious viral particles over time, could be used as virological (secondary) measurements [16-18, 30, 31] . In this study, paired influenza A VL decay and TCID 50 decay data points were available for 433 samples. The VL decay of 0.41 \u00b1 0.04 log 10 copies per mL per day in this study is more pronounced but comparable with the respiratory tract A(H1N1)pdm09 decrease rates of 0.31 log 10 VL units per day as reported by Lu et al [32] . Likewise, the TCID 50 decay (\u22120.51 TCID 50 [mL\u00b7day] \u22121 ) was comparable with the median decay rate of \u22120.39 TCID 50 (mL\u00b7day) \u22121 (corresponding to a 10-fold drop every 2.6 days over a period of 4.5 days) reported by de Jong et al [16] . The mechanism of prolonged viral shedding, ie, the detection of influenza viral RNA for a longer time period, has been described in many studies [30, 33, 34] . The clinical (and infection control) relevance of detecting low levels of viral RNA in the absence of cultivable virus can be questioned.",

We have shown that there is a significant decline of the log ratio of TCID 50 /VL over time within the same patient.
