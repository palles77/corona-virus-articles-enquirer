In this context we deemed interesting to further investigate the structure activity relationship (SAR) of our first series of cycloguanil-like dihydrotriazines, designing two novel azaspiro dihydrotriazine scaffolds. The present study allowed the exploration of the potential chemical space, around these new scaffolds, that are well tolerated for maintaining the antiviral effect by means of interaction with the hDHFR enzyme. The new derivatives confirmed their inhibitory profile against influenza viruses, especially type B. In particular, the two best compounds shared potent antiviral activity (4: EC 50 \u00bc 0.29 mM; 6: EC 50 \u00bc 0.19 mM), which was comparable to that of zanamivir (EC 50 \u00bc 0.14 mM), and better than that of ribavirin (EC 50 \u00bc 3.2 mM). In addition, these two compounds proved to be also effective against RSV (4: EC 50 \u00bc 0.40 mM, SI ! 250; 6: EC 50 \u00bc 1.8 mM, SI ! 56), surpassing the potency and selectivity index (SI) of ribavirin (EC 50 \u00bc 5.8 mM, SI > 43). By a perspective of these results, the above adequately substituted azaspiro dihydrotriazines may represent valuable hit compounds worthy of further structural optimization to develop improved host DHFR-directed antiviral agents.",

            "text": "Beside vaccination, therapeutic strategies to combat infectious diseases have mainly targeted some unique enzymes or components of viruses, bacteria and parasites. This approved and pathogen-directed approach, while highly successful in many cases [1] , is faced with rising resistance to individual drugs or drug classes. This is also occurring in the field of influenza virus. Influenza epidemics and pandemics continue to be a global threat to human health [2] . Influenza therapy is currently restricted to two classes of virus-directed drugs: M2 ion channel blockers and neuraminidase inhibitors [2] . The first class suffers from global virus resistance and neurological side effects [3] . The alternative neuraminidase inhibitors can also induce resistance and only provides rather modest clinical outcomes [4] . This highlights the urgent need to develop new antiviral strategies with entirely novel action principles and reduced risk for drug resistance. An alternative concept is to design new molecules to target host cell factors that are being hijacked by the virus during its replication [5] . Host factor-directed antiviral therapy is increasingly recognized as a relevant approach to counteract viral resistance and provide broadspectrum antiviral agents [6e8] . The study of virus-host interactions allows the identification of the mechanisms by which viral factors co-opt host cell functions and host regulatory mechanisms that influence disease progression and treatment outcome. These host factors may be potential drug targets for disease management. Host factors for influenza virus [9, 10] , RSV [11, 12] , dengue virus [13, 14] , and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [15e18] were recognized by transcriptomic and proteomic methods, providing more detailed biochemical insights into the replication strategies of these viruses. In general, host-directed anti-infective interventions may enhance host cell responses to pathogens, target disease-causing virulence factors, or stimulate innate or adaptive immune responses [19] . Today, different classes of anti-influenza agents are under development to target viral or cellular proteins/ processes [2, 9, 20] .",

This class of host DHFR inhibitors possessed intriguing dual activity against influenza A and B viruses and RSV. For the most promising derivatives (11a, 13a, 14a and 16a: range EC 50 \u00bc 0.015e0.10 mM), the potency against influenza B was comparable to that of zanamivir (antiviral EC 50 \u00bc 0.060 mM) [21] , a neuraminidase inhibitor that is globally advised for influenza therapy [22] . These DHFR inhibitors also exhibited nanomolar activity (mean EC 50~0 .008 mM) against RSV with a SI (ratio of cytotoxic to antiviral concentration) above 10,000 for compounds 11a, 14a and 16a, far surpassing the potency and safety profile of the anti-RSV drug ribavirin (EC 50 \u00bc 5.8 mM, SI > 43).",

These new dihydrotriazines were designed in order to better explore the chemical space around these scaffolds that are well tolerated for targeting the host (human) DHFR enzyme, with a view to evaluate its effect on virus inhibition. The new compounds confirmed the inhibitory profile against influenza viruses, especially type B. In order to verify the host-factor DHFR as the molecular target also for the azaspiro dihydrotriazines, the most promising derivatives were assayed against the recombinant hDHFR. These investigations were accompanied by molecular modeling studies of the title compounds in complex with the hDHFR, which predicted the most important features underlying protein/ligand binding. These information suggested the key molecular interactions required to achieve pharmacological activity and helped to rationalize the observed SAR of dihydrotriazinecontaining derivatives acting as host (human) DHFR inhibitors.",

Nevertheless, 4 and 6 result significantly less effective anti-RSV agents than cycloguanil-like dihydrotriazines (11a-16a), which exhibited EC 50 values in the range 0.0075e0.080 mM, and markedly superior SI values between 1250 and 13333 [21] . None of the compounds investigated here displayed activity against DNA viruses (i.e., herpes simplex virus, adenovirus or vaccinia virus), enveloped RNA viruses (i.e., HIV, coronavirus, parainfluenza-3 virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, sindbis virus, yellow fever virus or Punta Toro virus) or non-enveloped RNA viruses (i.e., Coxsackievirus B4 and reovirus-1) (data not shown).",

Also the (imidazo-pyridazinyl) benzenesulfonamide derivative (10) has displayed a significant antiviral profile (mean EC 50~5 4 nM and SI~339) against three single stranded \u00feRNA viruses, such as human rhinovirus 1 (HRV1), coxsackie virus B3 (CVB3) and HCV (1 b-genotype), impairing the activity of phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase IIIb (PI4KB) [7] . By comparison with the aforementioned host-factor directed compounds, also the azaspiro dihydrotriazines 4 and 6 may represent valid hits, worthy of further assessment to develop more efficient antiviral agents. 3.2. Inhibition of hDHFR enzyme. In order to verify the host factor DHFR inhibition as mechanism of action by which the novel azaspiro dihydrotriazines exploit their antiviral effect, the most potent compounds (4, 6 and 20) were assayed against the recombinant hDHFR enzyme, displaying sub-micromolar or low micromolar Ki values (Table 2) . Interestingly, these compounds exhibited an inhibitory behaviour (Ki) on hDHFR comparable to the antiviral activity (EC 50 ) showed against Influenza B virus: in fact, the most potent compound 6 (EC 50 \u00bc 0.19 mM) provided the lowest Ki value equal to 0.53 mM, and the less effective compound 20 (EC 50 \u00bc 3.0 mM) possessed the highest inhibition constant (Ki \u00bc 1.40 mM). Therefore, as previously demonstrated for cycloguanil-like dihydrotriazines [21] , the host (human) DHFR was found to be the molecular target of the novel azaspiro dihydrotriazine derivatives.",

In the new compounds series, the nitrogen of the spiropiperidine nucleus allowed the study of the role of different functionalized side chains, to understand the chemical space for enhanced interactions within the hDHFR enzyme. Whereas the previous series of cycloguanil-like dihydrotriazines emerged as highly potent influenza B and RSV inhibitors displaying nanomolar activity, the novel azaspiro dihydrotriazines, that we presented herein, possessed lower antiviral activity. By enzyme inhibition assays a DHFR-mediated mechanism of action was also confirmed for the new compounds, as we previously demonstrated for cycloguanil-like dihydrotriazines. The two novel compounds with superior activity and selectivity against influenza B and RSV were characterized by the piperidine nitrogen bearing a H-bond acceptor moiety linked to an aromatic lipophilic groups, such as the p-tolylcarbonyl (4) or (4-fluorophenyl)carbamoyl ones (6), joined with the 1-phenyl azaspiro dihydrotriazine. Also compound 20 has been found as promising new hit, combining a methoxyethyl chain at N (1) with an ethylsulfonic group at spiropiperidine nitrogen. Thus, besides the previously studied cycloguanil-like dihydrotriazine derivatives, also the above adequately substituted azaspiro dihydrotriazines may represent valuable starting points deserving further structural optimization.

The antiviral activity was determined with a broad panel of viruses using cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction or formazan-based cell viability assays. Unless mentioned otherwise below, all cell lines and virus strains were from ATCC. Human influenza A/PR/8/34 (A/H1N1) and B/Ned/537/05 (from R. Fouchier, Rotterdam, the Netherlands) were examined on Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells, a kind gift from M. Matrosovich (Marburg, Germany) [27] . Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; strain Long) was evaluated on human cervix carcinoma HeLa cells; these cells were also used for vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and Coxsackie B4 virus. African Green Monkey Vero cells were used for para-influenza-3 virus; reovirus-1; Sindbis virus; Coxsackie B4 virus; Punta Toro virus and yellow fever virus (Stamaril strain 17D). The following viruses were investigated in human embryonic lung fibroblast (HEL 299) cells: herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2; vaccinia virus; human adenovirus type 2 (clinical isolate); VSV; and human coronavirus 229 E. Finally, the activity against human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 [28] was assessed in human MT-4 lymphoblast cells. All cell lines were subcultivated in medium with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS). In the influenza assays, the MDCK cells were kept in FCS-free medium, i.e. Ultra MDCK \u00ae medium (Lonza) containing 2 mg/mL TPCK (tosylphenylalanyl-chloromethylketon)-treated trypsin to cleave the influenza hemagglutinin and achieve multicycle virus replication [23] . HeLa, Vero and HEL 299 cells were kept in medium with 2% FCS, while the MT-4 cells were left in medium with 10% FCS.",

HEL 299 were infected after reaching confluency, i.e. at day 5 after seeding. The cell cultures were infected with virus at a multiplicity of infection of 100 CCID 50 (50% cell culture infective dose, i.e. virus dose producing infection in 50% of inoculated wells; calculated by the method of Reed and Muench [32] . Simultaneously with the virus, serial five-fold dilutions of the test or reference compounds were added. To assess compound cytotoxicity, mock-infected plates were prepared in parallel, by adding medium instead of virus. The plates were incubated at 37 C (or 35 C in the case of influenza and coronavirus) during 3e6 days, or 10 days in the case of adenovirus. At that time, manifest CPE was visible in the untreated virus control with 100% of the monolayer showing, dependent on the virus, cell rounding, shrinking, lysis or cell-cell fusion. Microscopy was performed to score the CPE (i.e. score 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4, corresponding to 0, 25, 50, 75 or 100% of the cells showing CPE). Microscopy was also done to monitor cytotoxicity, expressed as the minimum cytotoxic concentration, i.e. the tested compound concentration causing minimal changes in cell morphology such as rounding, shrinking or lysis. In the case of influenza, the CPE assay was complemented by the formazan-based MTS cell viability assay (CellTiter 96 \u00ae AQ ueous One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay from Promega) For HIV, the similar MTT method was used [31] .",
