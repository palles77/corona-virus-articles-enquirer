Since palmitoylation of transmembrane proteins occurs at or near the membrane anchor, we investigated whether cysteines 804, 811 and 815 are acylated and analyzed the relevance of these residues for Env functions. Replacement of cysteines 804, 811 and 815 individually or in combination by serine residues resulted in Env glycoproteins that were efficiently expressed and processed. However, mutations C804S and C811S reduced Env fusogenicity by 93% and 84%, respectively, compared with wild-type Env. By contrast, mutant C815S exhibited a fusogenic capacity representing 50% of the wild-type value. Remarkably, the double mutation C804S/C811S abrogated both Env fusion activity and Env incorporation into virions. Finally, by means of Click chemistry assays we demonstrated that the four FIV Env cytoplasmic cysteines are palmitoylated.",

There is no clear consensus sequence for protein palmitoylation that would allow the identification of potential addition sites by simple examination of the protein primary structure. The most practical approach is to determine if mutagenesis of the cysteine residues at or near the protein membrane anchor affects protein palmitoylation (Drisdel et al., 2006) . Another distinctive feature of protein palmitoylation is that it is a reversible process.

It has been shown that palmitoylation targets proteins to lipid rafts, specific membrane microdomains that are enriched in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids. This is the case of the influenza virus hemagglutinin which requires three palmitoylated cysteines for efficient association with lipid rafts (Melkonian et al., 1999) and of the luteinizing hormone receptor which localizes to lipid rafts only after palmitate addition to its C-terminus (Lei et al., 2005) . Moreover, the reversibility of palmitate attachment to proteins has led to the proposal that this modification plays a critical role in the regulation of protein function and cell signaling, as it has been shown for cell surface receptors and ion channels (Chien et al., 1996; Drisdel et al., 2004) .",

Cysteine 787 is at a distance of 71 residues from the C-terminus of the membrane anchor.

(2000) have shown that removal of both palmitoylation sites in the HIV-1 Env cytoplasmic domain results in decreased Env association with lipid rafts, inhibition of Env incorporation into virions and a 60-fold reduction in viral infectivity. Based on the fact that several infectious HIV-1 molecular clones do not contain cysteines in their Env cytoplasmic domains, two other groups further examined whether Env palmitoylation plays any role in viral infectivity. Using the HIV-1 NL4-3 strain, which conserves the cysteine residue at position 764 but exhibits a tyrosine at position 837, Bhattacharya et al. (2004) have shown that substitution of cysteine 764 and tyrosine 837 by serines or alanines inhibits Env localization in lipid rafts and reduces both Env incorporation and viral infectivity. However, HIV-1 Env mutants carrying at positions 764 and 837 amino acids with bulky hydrophobic side chains, such as phenylalanine and tyrosine, exhibit an infectivity capacity representing approximately 80% of that of wild-type viruses (Bhattacharya et al., 2004) . In this regard, it should be emphasized that those HIV-1 isolates lacking cysteines in their Env cytoplasmic tails bear hydrophobic amino acids with bulky side chains at positions 764 and 837. Surprisingly, Chan et al. (2005) have reported that Cys-to-Ser mutations at HIV-1 Env positions 764 and 837 do not affect either Env cell surface expression or Env incorporation into virions. Moreover, this Env mutant virus efficiently replicates in CD4 \u00fe T cells (Chan et al., 2005) .",

The TM regions are highlighted: ectodomain (black box), membrane anchor (gray box) and cytoplasmic domain (white box). Amino acid numbering corresponds to the Env protein of the Petaluma F-14 isolate. The different Env mutants used in this study, in which the membrane-proximal cysteines 804, 811 and 815 were replaced alone or in combination by serines, are indicated. and 815 are located in close proximity to the TM membranespanning domain, whereas cysteine 848 is at a distance of only 8 amino acids from the Env C-terminus (Fig. 1) . We therefore speculated that, due to their location, cysteines 804, 811 and 815 could be potential sites for protein palmitoylation. To examine the relevance of these membrane-proximal cysteines for Env biological properties, we performed a site-directed mutagenesis study in which we first replaced, alone or in combination, the conserved cysteine residues by serines and then analyzed the effect of these amino acid changes on Env-mediated viral functions. The substitution of a cysteine residue for a serine residue only replaces the thiol group of the former amino acid with a hydroxyl group thereby minimizing the effect of the mutation on the overall protein structure.",

After 48 h of coculture, cells were stained for b-galactosidase activity and scored for syncytia formation. This cellcell fusion assay is based on the facts that the FIV Petaluma isolate is independent of the CD134 primary receptor for cell entry (Shimojima et al., 2004) and that FIV can efficiently use human CXCR4 (Poeschla and Looney, 1998; Willett et al., 1997) .",

When we examined the fusion ability of the mutant Env glycoproteins we found that mutations C804S and C811S significantly impaired Env fusogenicity. Indeed, mutant Env proteins C804S and C811S exhibited fusogenic capacities representing only 16% and 7.6%, respectively, of the wild-type value (Table 1) . By contrast, mutation C815S allowed substantial Env fusion activity; mutant C815S retained 50% fusogenic capacity when compared to wild-type Env ( Table 1) . The most drastic effect on cell-cell fusion was observed for the double (C804S/ C811S and C811S/C815S) and triple (C804S/C811S/C815S) mutants. These amino acid substitutions almost abrogated Env fusogenicity (Table 1) . It should be mentioned that the fusion assay used in these experiments is specific for the Env-CXCR4 interaction since addition of the CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100 (50 mg/ml) almost completely inhibits wild-type Env fusion activity (Table 1) . Our results therefore demonstrate that, although mutation of any of the TM cysteines at positions 804, 811 and 815 reduces Env-mediated membrane fusion, replacement of cysteines 804 and 811 by serine is highly detrimental to this Env property.",

The viral proteins were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), blotted and probed for the TM and capsid (CA) proteins as described in ''Materials and methods''. To evaluate the ability of each mutant Env glycoprotein to associate with particles, virions were tested for the presence of the TM protein instead of the SU subunit because the latter can be spontaneously shed from the cell surface of the transfected cells and therefore contaminate the particulate fraction (Celma et al., 2001) . As shown in Fig. 4A , replacement of cysteines 804, 811 or 815 by a serine residue did not affect Env packaging into virions. By contrast, the Env glycoproteins carrying either the double mutation C804S/C811S or the triple substitution C804S/C811S/C815S were not incorporated into particles (Fig. 4B) . Indeed, the TM proteins of these mutants could not be detected in the particulate fraction despite the fact that the levels of virionassociated CA protein observed for these mutant viruses were similar to those of their wild-type counterpart ( Fig. 4A and B) . Biotinylation experiments of CrFK cells expressing the wildtype Env or the mutant glycoproteins C804S, C811S, C815S and C804S/C811S/C815S demonstrated that the levels of cell surface-associated Env precursor and SU proteins detected for the single and triple TM mutants were comparable to those observed for wild-type Env (Fig. 4C ). Similar results were obtained when we applied cellular ELISA to assess the cell surface expression in CrFK cells of the single, double and triple Cys-to-Ser mutants (data not shown). Taken together, these experiments indicate that the defect in Env incorporation exhibited by the double and triple mutants (Fig. 4B ) cannot be attributed to inefficient expression of these mutant glycoproteins at the plasma membrane.",

CrFK cells were transfected with the wild-type FIV proviral DNA and metabolically labeled with azideconjugated palmitic acid.

The viral proteins were then resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. Fig. 5 shows that the FIV TM is modified by palmitoylation as inferred from its detection using HRPconjugated streptavidin. The specificity of the reaction is demonstrated by the fact that the TM is visualized only in the protein sample that was incubated with biotin-alkyne (Fig. 5) .

Cells were first lysed in Triton X-100 at 4 1C and then centrifuged so as to obtain the Triton-soluble material in the supernatant. The pellet was resuspended in b-octylglucoside, a detergent that disrupts lipid rafts, and centrifuged to recover the Triton-insoluble material in the supernatant. We found that the wild-type and mutant Env glycoproteins were mostly detected in the Triton X-100 insoluble fractions (Fig. 7A ). By contrast, when the Triton X-100 extraction was performed a 37 1C instead of 4 1C, the wild-type and mutant glycoproteins shifted from the insoluble to the soluble fraction (Fig. 7A ). Of note, when using the same two-step detergent extraction method, we observed that the lipid raft marker flotillin-1 was recovered in the insoluble fraction, whereas the rough endoplasmic reticulum integral membrane glycoprotein rotavirus VP7 was solubilized by treatment with Triton X-100 at 4 1C (Fig. 7B) . Interestingly, most of the FIV Gag protein was detected in the insoluble fraction (Fig. 7C ). However, a nonmyristoylated FIV Gag, which we have previously shown to be incapable of plasma membrane binding (Manrique et al., 2001b) , was found in the soluble fraction (Fig. 7C) .

To this end, we constructed a series of single, double and triple mutants in which cysteines 804, 811 and 815 were replaced, alone or in combination, by serines. When these FIV Env mutants were phenotypically characterized, we found that they were all expressed and processed into the SU and TM subunits in a wild-type manner. By contrast, when we tested the fusogenic capacity of the TM cysteine mutants, we observed that substitution for serine of cysteines 804 or 811 drastically reduced the ability of these glycoproteins to mediate cell-to-cell fusion when compared with wild-type Env. A highly defective fusion phenotype was also demonstrated for the double mutant C804S/C811S and the triple mutant C804S/C811S/C815S. Interestingly, replacement of cysteine 815 by serine allowed Env fusion to proceed with an efficiency representing approximately 50% of that of wild-type Env. Taken together, our results clearly indicate that cysteines 804 and 811 are critical for FIV Env fusogenicity. It should be stressed that the defect in Env fusion imposed by the C804S and C811S mutations cannot be attributed to an impairment in Env transport to the plasma membrane since these mutant Env glycoproteins are readily detected at the cell surface at levels comparable to those of wild-type Env.",

            "text": "A crucial step in lentiviral morphogenesis is the incorporation of Env into the Gag-made budding virions. In the case of SIV, we have demonstrated by means of genetic, biochemical and pulldown experiments that Env packaging into viral particles results from a specific interaction between the Env cytoplasmic tail and the matrix domain of the Gag protein (Celma et al., 2001; Gonz\u00e1 lez et al., 1996; Manrique et al., 2001a Manrique et al., , 2003 Manrique et al., , 2008 . The same mechanism operates in HIV-1 (Freed and Martin, 1996; Murakami and Freed, 2000) . When we examined the ability of the most relevant FIV Env cysteine mutants generated in this study to associate with viral particles, we found that the substitution of cysteines 804, 811 or 815 by serine do not affect Env incorporation into virions. However, the double C804S/C811S and the triple C804S/C811S/C815S mutations abrogate Env packaging into particles. There are at least two possible explanations for the Env incorporation defect exhibited by the double and triple Env mutants. These amino acid substitutions may modify the structure of the FIV TM thereby impairing its association with Gag. Alternatively, the double C804S/C811S and the triple C804S/ C811S/C815S mutations may alter the distribution of Env on the plasma membrane which in turn may prevent its recruitment into budding particles. However, the mutant Env glycoprotein lacking the three most membrane-proximal cytoplasmic cysteines is resistant to Triton X-100 extraction at low temperature, suggesting that this protein is associated with lipid rafts. The same behavior is exhibited by both wild-type Env and Gag. It is therefore likely that the triple mutant Env glycoprotein is not excluded from the virus assembly sites at the plasma membrane. The fact that removal of three of the four palmitoylation sites from the FIV Env glycoprotein does not appear to affect its cell surface distribution is in line with the results of Yang et al. (2010) showing that the two cytoplasmic palmitoylated cysteines in the HIV-1 Env protein are not involved in its association with lipid rafts. Instead, HIV-1 Env localization to detergent-resistant membrane domains is promoted by molecular determinants present within the C-terminal a-helix of the cytoplasmic tail (Yang et al., 2010) .",

However, the phenotype of these Env mutants is explained by the instability of the SU-TM complex exhibited by these glycoproteins, which causes SU secretion and TM degradation (Celma et al., 2007) . Therefore, mutations C804S/C811S and C804S/C811S/C815S are the first amino acid substitutions to be described for the FIV TM cytoplasmic domain that abrogate Env incorporation without affecting Env processing or cell surface expression. An important result stemming from our work is the demonstration, by means of the Click chemistry technology, that the FIV TM cytoplasmic tail is palmitoylated and that the four highly conserved cysteine residues within this Env domain are the sites of this modification. In this regard, the endodomain of the spike glycoprotein of SARS-coronavirus bears nine cysteine residues, all or most of which appear to be palmitoylated (Petit et al., 2007) .",

In this respect, in the Env proteins of most HIV-1 and SIV isolates the TM cytoplasmic cysteines that are modified by palmitate addition are also distantly located from the membrane-spanning domain (Yang et al., 1995) . We did not address in this work the role in Env function of cysteine 848 because we have previously characterized an FIV Env truncation mutant lacking the C-terminal 11 amino acids (including cysteine 848) which showed a wild-type phenotype with respect to fusion activity and Env incorporation into virions (Celma et al., 2007) .",

            "text": "To examine whether the cytoplasmic domain of the FIV TM is modified by the addition of palmitic acid we performed metabolic labeling of FIV Env-expressing cells with palmitic acid-azide followed by detection of its incorporation into the TM protein using Click chemistry (Charron et al., 2009; Martin and Cravatt, 2009 ). Namely, CrFK cells (grown in 35-mm-diameter dishes) were transfected in duplicate with wild-type or mutant proviral DNAs. At 48 h post-transfection, cells were incubated during 1 h in FBS-free DMEM after which cells were metabolically labeled with 100 mM palmitic acid-azide (Invitrogen) for 6 h in DMEM supplemented with 2.5% (v/v) FBS. Cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed as described above. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with pooled sera from FIV-infected cats and immunocomplexes were eluted from the protein A-Sepharose beads by incubation at 80 1C during 15 min in buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 1% SDS, 1 mM PMSF and 10 mg/ml aprotinin. The eluates containing the FIV proteins were subjected to Click chemistry using the Click-iT Metabolic Labeling Reagents for Proteins (Invitrogen). The viral proteins obtained from one set of transfections were incubated with 20 mM biotin-alkyne (Invitrogen) in the presence of 2 mM CuSO 4 as catalyst during 20 min at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by the addition of 3 volumes methanol, 0.75 volumes chloroform and 2 volumes water and centrifuged at 16,000g during 5 min. Proteins present in the interface layer were precipitated by the addition of methanol, centrifuged at 16,000g during 5 min. The protein pellets were airdried and resuspended in non-reducing loading buffer. The other set of protein samples was treated likewise except that the biotinalkyne reaction step was omitted. All samples were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. Membranes were first incubated with HRP-conjugated streptavidin to visualize the palmitoylated proteins and then reprobed with the mouse polyclonal anti-TM serum.",

(2008) but with several modifications. 293T cells were transfected with the wild-type, C804S or C804S/ C811S/C815S proviral DNAs, and 48 h post-transfection cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed on ice for 5 min in a solution containing 0.2% Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 10 mM EGTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol and protease inhibitors. Cell lysates were then centrifuged at 16,000g for 60 min at 4 1C. The supernatants containing the detergent-soluble fractions were separated from the pellets corresponding to the Triton X-100 insoluble material. The pellets were resuspended in a lysis solution with a composition similar to that described above but containing 60 mM b-octylglucoside instead of Triton X-100. The samples were incubated on ice for 10 min and centrifuged as described above. The two sets of supernatants resulting from the two-step detergent extraction method were immunoprecipitated with pooled sera from FIV-infected cats, subjected to SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. FIV Env proteins were detected by Western blotting using the anti-SU MAb whereas FIV Gag was visualized with the MAb directed to the CA domain. Non-transfected 293T cells were subjected to the same two-step detergent extraction assay described above and the lipid raftassociated protein flotillin-1 was visualized in the resulting supernatants with a MAb (BD Biosciences) kindly provided by Eduardo Casta\u00f1 o (Leloir Institute, Argentina). Rotavirus VP7 (SA11 strain) was expressed in 293T cells using a recombinant vaccinia virus as we have previously described (Celma et al., 2001) and detected by means of an anti-SA11 polyclonal rabbit serum. To express nonmyristoylated FIV Gag, we transfected 293T cells with a proviral DNA in which the codon for the glycine residue at position 2 in the gag open reading frame was mutated to alanine (Manrique et al., 2001b) .",

Cells were subjected to the Triton X-100 extraction procedure at 4 1C and soluble (S) and insoluble (I) fractions were obtained by centrifugation as described in ''Materials and methods''. Both the wild-type and myr \u00c0 Gag proteins were detected by Western blotting using the MAb directed to the CA domain of Gag.",
