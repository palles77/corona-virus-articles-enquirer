The neurological examination revealed flaccid tetraparesis with decreased spinal reflexes but preserved conscious proprioception and skin sensation. Extensive electrophysiological tests were conducted including electromyography, motor and sensory peripheral nerves potential recordings and 'late' potentials, defining the electrodiagnostic characteristics of this disease. Based on the electrophysiological findings, a generalised proximal and predominantly axonal neuropathy affecting the ventral (motor) nerve roots was suspected. As no aetiology was identified, this disease was classified as idiopathic polyradiculoneuropathy. Over a year, the cat presented three separate episodes of tetraparesis, each with a spontaneous complete recovery, consistent with the reportedly good prognosis for this disease.",

The cat was examined 8 days after becoming unable to walk. The cat had had a similar episode at 6 months of age; at that time, motor function improved significantly over 2e3 weeks and took 3 months to return to normality.

This report also adds new information about the natural course of the disease as this case showed three reversible episodes of subacute tetraparesis within 1 year (Gerritsen et al 1996) . Finally, very specific electrophysiological tests such as the study of late potentials (F wave) and the sensory potentials have been conducted in our case. The recording of those potentials is usually more difficult than motor potentials because the amplitude of the waves is in the range of the microvolts (mV).",

            "text": "Our case was presented with a very rapidly developing symmetric flaccid tetraparesis and markedly decreased flexor reflexes, but normal patellar reflexes, preserved sensation (persistence of conscious proprioception and normal skin sensation), and normal cranial nerve reflexes. This clinical picture is very similar to the acute IP described in dogs and Guillane Barr\u00e9 syndrome (GBS) in humans (Cuddon 1998, Hughes and Cornblath 2005) . In many The amplitudes of the CMAP are reduced (7.5 mV for both the distal and proximal CMAP; normal CMAP amplitude e distal stimulation: 30.9 AE 6.6, normal CMAP amplitude e proximal stimulation: 29.0 AE 6.2) (Malik and Ho 1989) . Note the polyphasic shape of the CMAPs. The vertical bars are positioned at the level of the first peak of each CMAP obtained in traces A and B. The distance between the proximal and distal stimulation points on the cat, divided by the time elapsed between the two vertical bars allow the calculation of the conduction velocity of the nerve impulse between the stimulation points, which was normal in this case (83 m/s, normal nerve conduction velocity: 88.3 AE 17.8) (Malik and Ho 1989). animals affected by peripheral nerve diseases, the myotatic reflexes (as the patellar reflex) are preserved, whilst flexor reflexes become notably depressed, as in the case reported here. It has been proposed in human medicine, that the myotatic reflexes may be useful for the distinction between axonal and demyelinating polyneuropathy (patients with demyelinating disease have a significantly greater loss of their myotatic reflexes) (van Dijk et al 1999) . In our case, the electrodiagnostic results were more indicative of an axonal type polyradiculoneuropathy, which may account for the preservation of the patellar reflexes. In previously described cats, the patellar reflex was recorded as absent in all the cases and post-mortem examination of two of the cases revealed a mixed involvement of the axons and the myelin (Gerritsen et al 1996) .",

If the disease affects only the nerve roots, the histopathological diagnosis from the peripheral nerve is frequently non-specific and no help in the diagnosis (Gerritsen et al 1996) . Therefore, electrodiagnostic tests, which are minimally invasive, are of far greater value. The electrodiagnostic findings obtained on the presented cat were very similar to those reported in dogs and in acute motor axonal neuropathy in humans, which is one of the three main subtypes of GBS (Cuddon 1998, Hughes and Cornblath 2005) . In our case, abnormal spontaneous electrical activity recorded in the muscles, combined with decreased amplitude of the CMAP suggest axonal loss. The nerve conduction velocities, which reflect the integrity of the myelin sheath of the peripheral nerves, were only moderately reduced. Those findings, therefore, demonstrate a balance towards greater axonal than demyelinating lesions.",

The sensory potentials are usually easily recorded and have normal conduction velocity (Cuddon 1998) , as obtained in the presented case for the sensory potential of the peroneal nerve. The study of the late potential (F wave) provides definitive evidence of the involvement of the nerve roots. The F wave represents a purely motor event and is a means of assessing the ventral nerve root (motor). In peripheral nerve diseases, the F wave latency is increased, as observed in our case. To assess the relative distribution of nerve pathological findings (proximal versus distal versus equal distribution), the F ratio can be used. The F ratio is obtained with a specific formula that basically divides the latency of the F wave by the latency of the M wave. If the ratio is greater than the reference value, it indicates more severe involvement of the proximal segment of the nerve, as demonstrated in our case.",

Thus, the diagnosis is based on combining the results of the neurological examination, the electrophysiological findings, and possibly the history of a recurrent disease. This disease should be recognised by veterinarians as it exhibits a marked discrepancy between the severity of the clinical signs and the overall good prognosis, although the early prognosis may be guarded because of possible respiratory failure.
