The mutant protein accumulated in the trans-Golgi, as judged from the acquisition of trans-Golgi-specific modifications of the protein and from the immunofluorescence staining pattern. It was localized to juxtanuclear, tubular structures that were also stained by antibodies against galactosyltransferase and -y-adaptin. The results of further mutagenesis in the cytoplasmic domain indicated that the size rather than the specific sequence of the cytoplasmic domain deter-mines whether H1 is retained in the trans-Golgi or transported to the cell surface. Truncation to less than 17 residues resulted in retention, and extension of a truncated tail by an unrelated sequence restored surface transport. The transmembrane segment of H1 was not sufficient for retention of a reporter molecule and it could be replaced by an artificial apolar sequence without affecting Golgi localization. The cytoplasmic domain thus appears to inhibit interaction(s) of the exoplasmic portion of H1 with trans-Golgi component(s)",

The determinants for retention in Golgi compartments have so far been shown to comprise the transmembrane domain with or without flanking sequences.

The ER thus performs a quality control function for secretory and membrane proteins (Hurtley and Helenius, 1989) . Many natural and artificial mutations in such proteins have been observed to result in ER retention and degradation, apparently because they affect protein folding or oligomerization. Alterations in the signals for targeted exit from the TGN generally cause missorting rather than TGN localization of the mutant. Only very few mutations have been documented that cause a specific accumulation of the mutant protein in post-ER compartments of the secretory pathway. Such mutations may reflect properties of retention or transport mechanisms in the Golgi. Here we describe mutants of the asialoglycoprotein (ASGP) 1 receptor subunit H1 that specifically accumulate in the trans-Golgi.",

Ligand ASGPs are bound at the cell surface, internalized via clathrin-coated vesicles, and released in the acidic environment of endosomes for subsequent degradation in lysosomes. The ASGP receptor cycles constitutively between the cell surface and early endosomes. The human receptor is at least a trimer composed of two homologous subunits, H1 and H2, which both are required for high affinity ligand binding. The subunits are single-spanning type II membrane proteins with amino-terminal cytoplasmic domains of 40 and 58 residues, respectively. The major subunit H1, which is 2--4 times more abundant than H2, contains all the signals necessary for endocytosis and specific basolateral transport in polarized epithelial cells . A tyrosine-containing signal necessary for efficient endocytosis and basolateral sorting has been identified in the amino-terminal segment of residues 1-11 Geffen et al., 1993) . Mutation of the critical tyrosine at position 5 to alanine or deletion of residues 4-11 result in apolar sorting in transfected MDCK cells and in accumulation of H1 at the plasma membrane in transfected fibroblast and MDCK cells.",

Although this mutant protein exits the ER, it is not detectable at the cell surface. Here we show that it accumulates specifically in a trans-Golgi compartment. The sequence requirement for retention or exit to the plasma membrane was investigated by further mutagenesis. The results indicate that the size of the cytoplasmic domain determines the fate of the protein and modulates an intrinsic ability of the transmembrane and/or exoplasmic portion of H1 to interact with component(s) resident in the trans-Golgi.

In 5-10% of the transiently transfected cells, but not in the stable cell lines, the mutant protein could be detected also on the cell surface in addition to the typical intracellular structures. Since surface appearance of Hl(A4-33A) was also observed in a small fraction of mock-transfected M1A cells, this phenomenon is probably caused by the transfection conditions. The absence of Hl(A4-33A) from the cell surface was confirmed biochemically by immunoblot analysis of proteinase K digested M1A and M1 cells (Fig. 3) .

The tyrosine sulfation tag was introduced into the mutant Hl(A4-33A) and stable expressing MDCK cell lines, named M1A rs, were generated. The tagged protein Hl(A4-33A) rs accumulated intracellularly like Hl(A4-33A), as judged by immunofluorescence microscopy and proteinase K digestion (not shown).

As markers for endosomes and lysosomes we used fluorescein-conjugated dextran internalized for 5-15 rain at 37\u00b0C, and the lysosomal membrane protein LAMP-I, respectively. As illustrated in Fig. 5 (A-C), the staining patterns of these markers differed considerably from the labeling of Hl(A4-33A). Trans-Golg~ was visualized using antibodies directed against human galactosyltransferase transiently expressed in MDCK cells, yielding a staining pattern similar to that of Hl(A4-33A) (E). Furthermore, endogenous ~/-adaptin (a TGN marker; D) and the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) receptor (present in the TGN, endosomes, and the plasma membrane; F) were predominantly immunolocalized to a similar j uxtanuclear region as H1(A4-33A).",

This is in contrast to Hl(A4-33A) with the combined deletion. Mutation of tyrosine-5 of HI(A12-33) to alanine in the construct Hl(A12-33/5A) also resulted in transport to the cell surface, arguing against a role of the tyrosine signal in surface transport. In a series of amino-terminal deletions, HI(A2-19) and HI(A2-24) were expressed on the cell surface, whereas HI(A2-28), HI(A2-33), and HI(A2-37) accumulated intracellularly in the typical tubular structures.

To test this correlation, the cytoplas-mic sequence of Hl(A4-33A) was extended by insertion of an unrelated sequence of 10 residues, the human c-myc epitope, in place of the initial deletion. The cytoplasmic domain of the resulting mutant Hl(A4-33m) thus consists of 21 amino acids.

The results cannot be explained by the accidental generation of a retention motif or the deletion of a hypothetical export signal. However, the localization of H1 mutants correlates with the size of their cytoplasmic domains. Deletion of more than two-thirds of the 40 cytoplasmic residues caused Golgi retention. Extension of the truncated tail of Hl(A4-33A) by insertion of 10 unrelated residues of c-myc again resulted in surface transport. Similarly, the 65-residue cytoplasmic domain of the transferrin receptor fused to the transmembrane and exoplasmic portion of H1 allowed surface transport, whereas truncation of the fusion protein's tail to only 11 residues yielded efficient Golgi retention. In contrast, tailless transferrin receptors have been reported to be transported to the cell surface (Giron~s et al., 1991; Kundu and Nayak, 1994) . Cytoplasmic sequences have been shown by mutational analysis to be necessary for endocytosis, basolateral transport, and sorting to lysosomes (summarized by Sandoval and Bakke, 1994) . Mutant proteins lacking cytoplasmic sequences may be missorted to inappropriate post-Golgi compartments, but are generally not blocked in exit from the Golgi. Golgi retention of truncated H1 therefore appears to be due to a specific interaction of the trans-membrane and/or exoplasmic portions of H1 with Golgi resident components. This interaction is impeded by large cytoplasmic domains. Coexpression of Hl(A4-33A) with wild-type H2 resulted in the formation of functional ligand-binding hetero-oligomers detectable on the cell surface. However, since both subunits could also be detected by immunofluorescence microscopy in the typical Golgi pattern, association with H2 only weakened the interaction of Hl(A4-33A) with the trans-Golgi.",
