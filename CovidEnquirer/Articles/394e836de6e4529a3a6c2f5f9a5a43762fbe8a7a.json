            "text": "In 2001, Nassim Nicholas Taleb introduced the idea of a ''Black Swan Event'' as an incident which is deemed highly improbable yet has massive consequences. 1 He applied three criteria for an event to be classified as a Black Swan: (1) The event was a surprise to the observer; (2) The event has a major impact; and (3) After the event, it is rationalized by hindsight as if it could have been expected, but was not addressed by risk mitigation methods. Taleb argues that attempts to predict Black Swan events are unproductive, but the knowledge that such events occur should be used to develop robust risk mitigation methods to prevent them. This argument is also advanced by Elizabeth Pate-Cornell 2 who maintains that the Black Swan idea is being excessively used to rationalize infrequent but predictable events as an excuse for poor planning or risk management.",

For example, on the Fox business website, commentator Adam Samson recently listed ''eight Black Swan Events that would instantly change the world''. 3 None these can be properly categorized as a Black Swan. The emergence of a pandemic, for example, has major consequences, but may or may not be predictable. Global monitoring systems are now in place for well-recognized early warning signs of impending Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) or Bird Flu pandemics. But the sudden emergence of the AIDS virus as a pandemic disease had no warning signs for epidemiologists of human disease, and even in retrospect was random and not predictable. With the AIDS experience now incorporated into our public health world picture, new zoonoses with pandemic potential loom larger in our awareness and practices.",

As a chemist plans an experiment, time should be spent on considering ''what if . . . went wrong''. This is already done to some degree with respect to liquid spillssecondary containment has now become a normal part of equipment set-up. The thought process should be taken further, to include the mechanical integrity of the system, the actual energy changes of the chemistry and the physical consequences of those energy changes, including heat transfer and pressure relief (among others). Soft factors, such as operator training, past behavior of the personnel, and the performance history of the research group can readily be included in the ''What if . . .'' analysis. Including this type of thinking in planning experiments provides a very large improvement on procedure safety for a very low investment of time or resources.",

The task is difficult because the permeability characteristics of protective fabrics must meet the physical and chemical characteristics of a wide variety of liquids, solids and gases. Engineers at the University of Michigan have developed a superomniphobic 4 (how is that for a new word?) coating that repels (almost) all liquids from concentrated acids to oils, solvents, and bases. They took electrospun polydimethylsiloxane fibers and coated them with nanoscale cubes of polyhedral oligomeric silsequioxane to create a coating with an extremely low surface energy. The coating creates extremely fine pores within the pore-structure of the coated fabric which markedly reduces the surface area available for an impinging liquid to contact. In testing, 98 of 100 liquids tested were repelledwith no detectable breakthrough. The two liquids which wetted the fabric were both chlorofluorocarbons (Freons TM ).",

It will take educating the students and working with each PI to make him/her an example worth emulating. This will require a topdown influence from Department Chairs, Deans, and campus Presidents. Each of them will need to understand what their responsibilities are and how to implement them. The recent book by Hill and Finster 5 provides good guidance on educating students. The Committee on Chemical Safety's report 6 on improving Safety Culture provides the information needed by campus administrators. Many resources address the implementation of best practices in the laboratory. This Journal is clearly the gold standard for current, cutting-edge information. The National Academies 7 book, Prudent Practices in the Laboratory provides excellent implementation methods. The information and methods are available.",
