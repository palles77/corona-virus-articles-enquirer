            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a new respiratory viral epidemic that originated in China but has affected many parts of the world, with devastating impact on economies and the practice of medicine and rehabilitation. A novel coronavirus has been implicated, with transmission through respiratory droplets. Rehabilitation was significantly affected by SARS, because strict infection control measures run counter to principles such as multidisciplinary interactions, patients encouraging and learning from each other, and close physical contact during therapy. Immunocompromised patients who may silently carry SARS are common in rehabilitation and include those with renal failure, diabetes, and cancer. Routine procedures such as management of feces and respiratory secretions (eg, airway suctioning, tracheotomy care) have been classified as high risk. Personal protection equipment presented not only a physical but also a psychologic barrier to therapeutic human contact. Visitor restriction to decrease chances of disease transmission are particularly difficult for long-staying rehabilitation patients. At the height of the epidemic, curtailment of patient movement stopped all transfers for rehabilitation, and physiatrists had to function as general internists. Our experiences strongly suggest that rehabilitation institutions should have emergency preparedness plans because such epidemics may recur, whether as a result of nature or of bioterrorism.",

This was the start of a new viral respiratory epidemic for the island-nation of 4 million; the infection rapidly spread from this index case, who was in a multibed ward without barrier infection control measures. Those infected at TTSH included 9 of approximately 30 family members and friends who visited this patient, 1 of the 12 patients in adjacent beds, 1 of the 8 physicians, and 9 of the 30 nurses who attended to her. 1 Based on nasopharyngeal and serum samples of patients, the infective agent implicated was a novel coronavirus. [2] [3] [4] The name severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), adopted for this infection, was an appropriate recognition of its nature and virulence. SARS started as an atypical pneumonia in the Guangdong Province of China in November 2002, affecting 792 people and causing 31 deaths. 2, 3 It was carried into Hong Kong and transmitted to 3 vacationing Singaporeans (including the index case), apparently while they were waiting for a hotel elevator along with a SARS-infected person. The epidemic spread to many countries across the globe, with the hardest hit areas being the cities of Beijing, Hong Kong, 5 Taipei, Singapore, and Toronto. The last probable case of SARS in Singapore was hospital-isolated on May 11. As of June 20, 2003, the tally in Singapore was a total of 206 probable cases, with 170 recovered and discharged home, 32 dead, and 3 still hospitalized. On July 5, 2003 , the World Health Organization issued a declaration that SARS had been contained worldwide.",

Fear of the unknown with a new disease entity and the potential for uncontrollable spread resulted in much apprehension and the implementation of far-reaching measures. In Singapore, the economic toll has been significant and estimates suggest that SARS may have taken 2% from the gross domestic product growth in 2003. This resulted not only from direct costs to control the epidemic, but also from losses in productivity, decreased demand for sales and services, and a massive blow to the important airline and tourist industries. Tourism to Singapore decreased drastically and international conferences were postponed. Many multinational business corporations instituted policies against travel to affected countries like Singapore. Travel from Singapore to other SARS-affected countries was similarly curtailed. In simple terms, nobody wanted to put themselves at risk of contracting the SARS virus.",

US$60 million was spent on infrastructure expenditures, including construction of isolation rooms and renovation of wards and medical facilities. 6 The fears and concerns generated by the disease also had a considerable impact on hospitals. 7 A striking feature of SARS was the significantly increased risk to health care workers, with a large proportion of those infected in Singapore (90/206 [44%]) from among these ranks. The fear of the \"super-spreader\" (a person who directly infected \u054610 other persons 8 with minimal contact), lying undiscovered in the wards, asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, was of considerable concern and caused much stress.",

Ironically, a significant number of healthy staff with higher body temperatures were ordered to take sick leave until it was determined that these people had higher baseline temperatures and waivers were issued.
