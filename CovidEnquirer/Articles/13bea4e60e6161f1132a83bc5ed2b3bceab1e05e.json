            "text": "Recent cases of emergent diseases have renewed interest in the evolutionary and ecological mechanisms that promote parasite adaptation to novel hosts [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Crucial to adaptation is the degree of mixing of original, susceptible hosts, and novel hosts. An increase in the frequency of the original host has two opposing effects on adaptation: an increase in the supply of mutant pathogens with improved performance on the novel host [7-9]; and reduced selection to infect novel hosts, caused by fitness costs commonly observed to be associated with host switching [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . The probability of disease emergence will therefore peak at intermediate frequencies of the original host. We tested these predictions by following the evolution of a virus grown under a range of different frequencies of susceptible (original) and resistant (novel) host bacteria. Viruses that evolved to infect resistant hosts were only detected when susceptible hosts were at frequencies between 0.1% and 1%. Subsequent experiments supported the predictions that there was reduced selection and mutation supply at higher and lower frequencies, respectively. These results suggest that adaptation to novel hosts can occur only under very specific ecological conditions, and that small changes in contact rates between host species might help to mitigate disease emergence.",

We established replicate bacterial populations with a range of susceptible host frequencies (between 0% and 90%), but with the same total population density, in glass tubes containing nutrient-rich media, and then inoculated 10 5 isogenic lytic phage particles into the bacteria populations. Phages were evolved by transferring a fraction (1%) of the phage population to fresh bacteria and media every 48 hr, during which time they reached maximal densities of approximately 10 9 ml 21 in the most permissive treatment (90% susceptible hosts; Figure S1 , available online). We re-established initial frequencies of susceptible and resistant bacteria (from frozen stocks) at the beginning of each transfer, to ensure the different mixing treatments imposed consistent selection pressures on the phages. Note that although the percentage of susceptible hosts varied during 48 hr growth, there was a near-perfect positive correlation between the percentage of susceptible hosts between 0 and 48 hr when measured across treatments (see Supplemental Data). The presence of phage clones that could infect the susceptible and ''resistant'' bacteria were assessed on a daily basis, and densities of phage genotypes that could infect the resistant or susceptible host were determined at the end of the 10 transfer experiment.",

Consistent with this view, we found that the growth rate of the ancestral phage did indeed increase with increasing susceptible host densities ( Figure 2 , quadratic term F 1,45 = 11.0, p = 0.002). Furthermore, the relationship between phage growth rate and starting susceptible host frequencies demonstrates that starting host frequency is a predictable determinant of phage epidemiology.",

Costs associated with generalism can arise for two biologically plausible reasons. First, if viral yields produced by mutant phages in novel hosts are lower than those in the original host (an ecological cost of generalism) [10, 11] . This scenario is analogous to that assumed in optimal foraging theory, where patches vary in quality [18] . Second, if the ability to infect novel hosts is associated with reduced performance on the original host [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] (an evolutionary cost of generalism [19] ). We tested these possibilities by isolating mutant phage and growing them on both the original and ancestral hosts. We found that growth of the newly arisen mutant phages did not differ significantly between the novel and original host ( Figure 3A ; paired t = 1.35, p = 0.24), but that growth was considerably lower than the ancestral phages on the original host ( Figure 3a ; t = 7.95, p = 0.001).",

These costs were ameliorated to some extent by the final time point of the experiment, but generalist phages still showed a growth rate cost relative to the ancestral phages on the susceptible host ( Figure 3 ; t = 14.73, p < 0.001). Generalist phages showed marginally worse performance on the resistant host than ancestral phages on the susceptible host ( Figure 3 ; t = 2.35, *Correspondence: angus.buckling@zoo.ox.ac.uk p = 0.065), but, strikingly, 78% of clones from the final time point had lost the ability to infect the susceptible host; no such specialists were observed when mutant phages were first detected. Consistent with a cost of generalism, these specialist phages performed substantially better on the novel host than did the evolved generalists ( Figure 3b ; t = 2.7, p = 0.024). We are not aware of other studies that have reported such rapid loss of a virus' ability to infect its original host, and subsequent experiments will explore the ecological and genetic determinants of virus host switching in contrast to the more frequently observed evolution of generalist viruses.",

Increasing mutation supply rate (by increasing the density of susceptible hosts) will, by definition, increase the probability of a mutation appearing in the population that allows infection of the novel host. Crucial to the subsequent decline in viral adaptation with increasing susceptible host frequency are costs associated with the ability to infect and transmit from multiple hosts, and data from laboratory populations of viruses suggest that both ecological and genetic costs of generalism are common [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Crucially, natural populations of parasites can often infect and transmit from multiple host species [1] , and initial costs associated with infecting novel hosts are also likely to be common [1, 6] .",

Interactions in natural populations are likely to be assortative, such that, for a given ratio of host species within an environment, hosts are more likely to interact with their own species, and hence transmit parasites, more than with other species. This can have a major impact in a purely epidemiological (nonevolutionary) context, with heterogeneity decreasing the probability of an epidemic [21] but increasing the severity if it does occur [22, 23] . Surprisingly, the extent of assortative interactions appears to have relatively little impact on the probability of parasite adaptation to novel host [9] , possibly because heterogeneity can both promote and inhibit parasite transmission and hence density. However, existing theory does not, as far as we are aware, consider the role of assortative interactions on selection against infecting novel hosts because of ecological or evolutionary costs of generalism.",

It is conceivable that adaptation to humans by a number of disease-causing organisms is not fundamentally constrained, but is selected against. For example, avian influenza virus infects, but does not successfully transmit from, humans. Conversely, adaptation of zoonotic parasites to humans (such as SARS coronavirus) might have resulted from increased selection to infect humans because of reduced contact between humans and natural hosts. The precise levels of host mixing that promote, or prevent, adaptation of parasites to novel hosts in natural systems will of course be system specific. However, if low frequencies of original hosts cause the greatest risk of disease emergence, it could be that imperfect isolation or quarantine between host types is more risky, as a management tool to avoid disease emergence, than intermediate levels of mixing. Estimates of parasite transmission from original and novel hosts might allow accurate predictions of the impact of changes in natural or managed host population mixing on disease emergence.",
