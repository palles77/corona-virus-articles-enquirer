Because plants do rather well in Nature, this question has often been overlooked. We are well aware of the defensive strategies of higher animals against microbes and predators (1,2,4,15,17,28,494) . The complex immune system with its cellular and humoral components is a well-studied area in the context of vertebrate-microbe interactions. Against predating animals, Nature evolved weapons, armor, crypsis, thanatosis, deimatic behavior, aposematism, flight, or defense chemicals (usually called \"poisons\") (1).",

We can distinguish the following defense mechanisms in plants (3, 4, 7, 15, 17) ; the mechanisms are not independent and may act cooperatively and synergistically. We should be aware that many species have additionally evolved specialized traits in this context. 1 . Mechanical protection is provided by thorns, spikes, trichomes, glandular hairs, and stinging hairs (which are often supported by defense chemicals). 2. Formation of a thick bark on roots and stems can be considered as a sort of armor, and the presence of hydrophobic cuticular layers as a penetration barrier directed against microbes. b. Cell walls are biochemically rather inert with reduced digestibility to many organisms because of their complex cellulose, pectin, and lignin molecules. Callose and lignin are often accumulated at the site of infection or wounding (6,7) and form a penetration barrier. c. Synthesis of inhibitory proteins (e.g., lectins, protease inhibitors) or enzymes (e.g., chitinase, lysozyme, hydrolases, nucleases) that could degrade microbial cell walls or other microbial constituents would be protective, as well as synthesis of peroxidase and phenolase, which could help inactivate phytotoxins produced by many bacteria and fungi. These proteins are either stored in the vacuole 1. ALLELOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF ALKALOIDS 3 or are secreted as exoenzymes into the cell wall or the extracellular space (8, 9) . These compounds are thus positioned at an \"advanced and strategically important defense position.\" In addition, storage proteins (of cereals and legumes) are often deficient in particular essential amino acids, such as lysine or methionine. d. As a widely distributed and important trait, secondary metabolites with deterrenthepellent or toxic properties against microorganisms, viruses, and/or herbivores may be produced (2-4, 10-21) . These allelochemicals can be constitutively expressed, they may be activated by wounding (e .g., cyanogenic glycosides, glucosinolates, coumaryl glycosides, alliin, ranunculin), or their de ~O U O synthesis may be induced by elicitors (so-called phytoalexins), infection, or herbivory (4,7, [22] [23] [24] . These products are often synthesized and stored at strategically important sites [epidermal tissues or in cells adjacent to an infection (25,26)] or in plant parts that are especially important for reproduction and survival [flowers, fruits, seeds, bark, roots (2, 3, 15) ].",

Classic taxonomy, however, has taken little account of alkaloid distribution: If the same alkaloid is present in two plants of the same taxon, this is interpreted as evidence for a relationship, but its occurrence in two plants of nonrelated taxa is taken as evidence of independent evolution. Because secondary metabolites are also derived characters that were selected during evolution, their general value for taxonomy and systematics is certainly smaller than formerly anticipated (233).",

In 1887 and 1888, Errera and Stahl (92, 308, 504) published the idea that natural products are used by plants for chemical defense against herbivores. Since the leading plant physiologists of that time were mostly anti-Darwinian, they were not willing to accept the defense argument, which was too much in line with the Darwinian concept. Therefore, this early defense concept was negated and remained forgotten for nearly 60 years. In 1959, Fraenkel(10) reopened the debate in a review article and presented new data supporting the view that secondary metabolites serve as chemical defense compounds against herbivores. During the next three decades this concept was improved experimentally, and we can summarize the present situation as follows Although the biological function of many plant-derived secondary metabolites has not been studied experimentally, it is now generally assumed that these compounds are important for the survival and fitness of a plant and that they are not useless waste products, as was suggested earlier in the twentieth century (34, 35) . In many instances, there remains a need to analyze whether a given compound is active against microorganisms (viruses, bacteria, fungi), against herbivores (molluscs, arthropods, vertebrates), or against competing plants (so-called allelopathy).",

Rather, it constitutes a general barrier which will be effective in most circumstances, that is, most potential enemies are repelled or deterred. Plants with allelochemicals at the same time represent an ecological niche for potential pathogens and herbivores. During evolution a few organisms have generally been successful in specializing toward that niche (i.e., in a particular toxic plant) in that they found a way to sequester the toxins or become immune to them (14, 15, 32) . This is especially apparent in the largest class of animals, the insects (probably with several million species on earth), which are often highly host plant specific. The number of these \"specialists\" is exceedingly small for a given plant species as compared to the number of potential enemies that are present in the ecosystem. We can compare this situation with our immune system: It works against the majority of microorganisms but fails toward a few viruses, bacteria, fungi, and protozoa, which have overcome this defense barrier by clever strategies. Nobody would call the immune system and antibodies useless because of these few adapted specialists! We should adopt the same argument when we consider plants' defenses by secondary metabolites (2) .",

The waste product argument probably came from animal physiology: Carnivorous animals take up relative large amounts of proteins and nucleic acids, containing more nitrogen than needed for metabolism, which is consequently eliminated as uric acid or urea. A similar situation or need, however, is not applicable for plants. In fact, many plants remobilize their nitrogenous natural products (including alkaloids) from senescing organs such as old leaves (2,37,506). If alkaloids were waste products, we would expect the opposite, namely, accumulation in old organs which are shed. On the other hand, the alkaloids produced by animals were never considered to be waste products by zoologists, but rather regarded as defense chemicals (16,28,494496) . Thus, the more plausible hypothesis is that alkaloids of plants, microorganisms, and animals, like other allelochemicals, serve as defense compounds.

In many medicinal experiments relatively low doses are applied because of the toxic properties of many alkaloids. If the same compound would have been tested at relevant (which normally means elevated) concentrations that are present in the plant, an ecologically relevant activity might have been detected. Another restriction is that the activities of alkaloids have been tested with organisms that are sometimes irrelevant for plants but medicinally important. However, if a compound is active against Escherichia coli, it is likely that is is also active against other gram-negative and plant-relevant bacteria.

Some scientists have called this phenomenon a \"coevolutionary\" process, but it has to be recalled that the associations seen today are not necessarily those in which the chemical interactions originally evolved (18,505,506). Applications of synthetic insecticides have shown that resistance to these new compounds can occur rapidly, sometimes encompassing only a dozen generations. Times can also be much longer. If plant species are introduced to a new continent or island, it usually takes a long time before new pathogens or herbivores become adapted and specialized to this new species. For example, Lupinus polyphyllus from North America has a number of specialized herbivores, but is rarely attacked by herbivores in Europe. This lupine left its enemies behind when it was transferred to Europe three centuries ago. About 10 years ago, however, the North American lupine aphid (Macrosiphum albifrons) was introduced to Europe accidentally. This aphid is specialized to alkaloid-rich lupines with lupanine as a major alkaloid. At present, this aphid has spread over most of Europe and is now colonizing its former host, L. polyphyllus (2, 503) .",

These \"generalists,\" as we can also call this subgroup of herbivores, are usually deterred from feeding on plants which store especially noxious metabolites and select those with less active ones (such as our crop species, where man has bred away many of the secondary metabolites that were originally present; see Table XI ).

However, these specialized insects are exceptions to the general rule. For these specialists, the defense chemistry of the host plant is usually not toxic, but they are susceptible to the toxicity of natural toxins from non-host plants (32) .

Examples of bitter alkaloids (at least for man) are quinine, strychnine, brucine, and sparteine, and for pungent alkaloids are capsaicin, and piperine. It should be recalled that these taste properties are not identical for all animals. For example, geese, which are obligate herbivores, hardly avoid food with alkaloids or smelly compounds (amines, mercaptoethanol) that man would hardly touch (185). Conversely, fragrances that are attractive to us are highly repellent to geese (185). Even within a given population taste can differ significantly.

We can distinguish molecular targets and processes that are important for all cells, such as synthesis of DNA, RNA, and proteins, replication, transcription, translation, membrane assembly and stability, electron chains, or metabolically important enzymes or proteins including receptors, hormones, and signal compounds (Table IV ). In the following we discuss some of these toxic effects. a. Cellular Targets Nucleic Acids. DNA, the macromolecule which holds all the genetic information for the life and development of an organism, is a highly vulnerable target. It is not surprising that a number of secondary metabolites have been selected during evolution which interact with DNA or DNAprocessing enzymes. Some alkaloids bind to or intercalate with DNA/RNA (Table IV) and thus affect replication or transcription, or cause mutations, leading to malformations or cancer (Table V) : 9-methoxyellipticine, dictamnine, ellipticine, harmane alkaloids, melinone F, quinine and related alkaloids, skimmianine, avicine, berberine, chelerythrine, coptisine, coralyne, fagaronine, nitidine, sanguinarine, pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAS), cycasin, olivacine, etc. Many of the intercalating molecules are planar, hydrophobic molecules that fit within the stacks of AT and GC base pairs. Other alkaloids act at the level of DNA and RNA polymerases, such as vincristine, vinblastine, avicine, chelilutine, coralyne, fagaronine, nitidine, amanitine, hippeastrine, and lycorine, thus impairing the processes of replication and transcription. Whereas these toxins usually cause a rapid reaction, some alkaloids cause long-term effects in vertebrates in that they are mutagenic or carcinogenic (Table V) . Besides basic data obtained in Salmonella or Drosophila, there are a few reports which illustrate the potent mutagenic effect of alkaloids on vertebrates. Anagyrine, anabasine, and coniine cause \"crooked calf disease\" if pregnant cows or sheep feed on these alkaloids during the first period of gestation (329,341,348,349,351,352) . The offspring born show strong malformation of the legs. Some of the steroid alkaloids (e.g., cyclopamine, jervine, and veratrosine), which are produced by Veratrum species, cause the formation of a central large cyclopean eye (329-330, an observation that was probably made by the ancient Greeks and thus led to the mythical figure of the cyclops. It is likely that any herbivore which regularly feeds on plants containing these alkaloids will suffer from reduced productivity and reduced fitness in the long term. In effect, the plants which contain these alkaloids are usually avoided by vertebrate herbivores.",

The alkaloid aristolochic acid, which is produced by plants of the genus Aristolochia, is carcinogenic. The mechanism of action of this alkaloid is believed to be similar to the well-known carcinogen nitrosamine (344,345) , because of its NO, group. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids and their N-oxides, which are abundantly produced by members of the Asteraceae and Boraginaceae but also occur in the families Apocynaceae, Celestraceae, Elaeocarpaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Fabaceae, Orchidaceae, Poaceae, Ranunculaceae, Rhizo- esterified (425,426) . After oral intake, the N-oxides are reduced by bacteria in the gut. The lipophilic alkaloid base is resorbed and transported to the liver, where it is \"detoxified\" by microsomal enzymes. As a result, a reactive alkylating agent is generated, which can be considered as a pyrrolopyrrolidine. The alkaloid can then cross-link DNA and RNA and thus cause mutagenic or carcinogenic effects (especially in the liver) (502). Thus, pyrrolizidine alkaloids represent highly evolved and sophisticated antiherbivore compounds, which utilize the widespread and active detoxification system of the vertebrate liver. The PA story is very intriguing, since it shows how ingenious Nature was in the \"arms race.\" The herbivores invented detoxifying enzymes, and Nature the compound which is activated by this process. A herbivore feeding on PA-containing plants will eventually die, usually without reproducing properly. Only those individuals which carefully avoid the respective bitter-tasting plants maintain their fitnes and thus survive. The protection due to PA can easily be seen on meadows, where Senecio and other PA-containing plants are usually not taken by cows and sheep, at least as long other food is available.",

At higher alkaloid concentrations, a marked reduction in the germination rate can be recorded regularly. More sensitive, however, is the growth of the radicle and hypocotyl. They respond to alkaloids at a much lower level, and usually a reduction in growth can be observed but sometimes also the opposite, either of which reduces the fitness of a seedling.

We must remember that alkaloid composition and levels are often tissue or organ specific (4,25,38) . They may vary during the day [a diurnal cycle has been observed for QAs and tropane alkaloids (185,503,506)l or during the vegetation period (39.  505,506) . Furthermore, as in all biological systems, there are differences at the level of individual plants and between populations and subspecies. Unfortunately, many phytochemical reports do not contain any quantitative information, or these data are given for the whole plant without realizing the above-mentioned variables. In addition, concentrations are usually given on a dry weight basis, which is appropriate in the chemical or pharmaceutical context. However, herbivores or pathogens do not feed on the dry plant in general, but on the \"wet\" fresh material. In the context of chemical ecology we urgently need data on a fresh weight basis. As an approximation, in this chapter we use a conversion factor of 10 to convert dry weight to fresh weight data if only the dry weight data are available.",

In annual species actively growing young tissue, leaves, flowers, and seeds are often alkaloid-rich, whereas in perennial ones, like shrubs and trees, we find alkaloid-rich stem and root barks in addition. All these plant parts and organs have in common that they are important for the actual fitness or for the reproduction and thus the long-term survival of the species. Spiny species, which invest in mechanical defense, accumulate fewer alkaloids than soft-bodied ones (15); examples are isoquinoline alkaloids in cacti or QAs in legumes (184) . If a plant produces few and large seeds, their alkaloid levels tend to be higher than in species with many and small seeds (15,184); thus. a plant with few and big seeds is generally a rich source of alkaloids, which makes sense in view of the defense hypothesis.",

This ensures that a certain level of defensive compounds is present at any time. Furthermore, continuous turnover is a common theme for molecules of the cells whose integrity is important, such as proteins, nucleic acids, and signal molecules. The same seems to be true for a defense compound. An alkaloid which mimics a neurotransmitter, such as hyoscyamine, nicotine, or sparteine, could be oxidized or hydrolyzed in the cell by chance, and thus would be automatically inactivated. Only by replacing these molecules continuously can the presence of the active compounds be guaranteed. For example, it was suggested that nicotine has a half-life of 24 hr in Nicotiana plants, and that more than 10% of the CO, fixed passes through this alkaloid (505).",

Classic examples of phytoalexins include isoflavones, phenolics, terpenes. protease inhibitors, coumarins, and furanocoumarins. Using plant cell cultures it could be shown that a similar process can be observed with some alkaloidal plants, which start to produce alkaloids with antimicrobial properties (e.g., sanguinarine, canthin-6-one, rutacridone alkaloids) when challenged with elicitors from bacterial or fungal cell walls (Table XI) . But what is the situation after herbivory? When plants are eaten by large herbivores, a de nouo synthesis would be almost useless for a plant (except maybe trees), since this would not be quick enough. The situation is different, however for small herbivores such as insects or worms, which may feed on a particular plant for days or weeks. Here the de nouo production of an allelochemical would be worthwhile. There are indeed some preliminary experimental data that support this view.",

In Poland, where the sweet yellow lupine is one of the more important fodder plants, the invasion of the aphids became a serious problem not only because the aphid enfeebles the plants by sucking its phloem sap, but also because it transfers a viral disease. The disease, known as lupine narrow leafness, decreases seed production in infected plants, and the infection takes place early, that is, prior to the plants' blossoming. Thus, a mixed population of sweet and bitter lupines can, after a few generations, lose all sweet forms. Infestation by the aphid and the following viral infection accelerate the elimination of alkaloid-poor plants, which, even without infection, are already inferior in seed production (506).

We regularly see one to five main alkaloids in a plant, but also several (up to 80) minor alkaloids. This qualitative pattern is not constant, but differs among organs, developmental stages, individuals, populations, and species. Normally, we classify the compounds as belonging to one or two chemical groups. This does not mean, however, that their biological activities are identical. On the contrary, the addition of a lipophilic side chain to a molecule seems to be a small and insignificant variation from the chemical point of view, but this may render the compound more lipophilic, and thus more resorbable. In consequence, its toxicity may be higher (see QAs in Table I ). Thus, a herbivore or pathogen has to adapt not only to one group of chemicals but to the individual compounds present.

Ergot alkaloids are strong vertebrate toxins (Tables I-IV) ; they mimic the activity of several neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, serotonin, and noradrenaline (Table IV) . In fact, the impact of herbivores on populations which were highly infected by fungi was more reduced than those without. This means that the fungi exploit the nutrients of their host plants and supply them with strong poisons, which are not produced by the plants themselves.

First, man tends to avoid food with bitter, pungent, or strongly scented ingredients. As a prerequisite he needs corresponding receptors in the nose or on the tongue which evolved during the long run of evolution as a means to avoid intoxication. Second, our liver still contains a set of detoxifying enzymes which can handle most xenobiotics. Furthermore, some of these enzymes, such as cytochrome P.450 oxidase, is inducible by dietary xenobiotics. Third, besides these biological adaptations, man has also used his brain to avoid plant allelochemicals. (a) Many fruits or vegetables are peeled. As many alkaloids and other compounds are stored in the epidermis, for example, steroid alkaloids in potato tubers or cucurbitacins in cucurbits, peeling eliminates some of these compounds from consumption. (b) Most food is boiled in water. This leads to the thermal destruction of a number of toxic allelochemicals, such as phytohaemagglutinins, protease inhibitors, and some esters and glycosides. Many watersoluble compounds are leached out into the cooking water and are discarded after cooking (e.g., lupines or potatoes). (c) South American Indians ingest clay when alkaloid-rich potato tubers are on the menu. Since clay binds steroidal alkaloids, geophagy is thus an ingenious way to detoxify potential toxins in the diet (522) . (d) Man has modified the composition of allelochemicals in his crop plants, in that unpleasant taste components have been reduced by plant breeding. From the point of view of avoidance, this strategy is plausible, but, as was discussed earlier, it is deleterious from the point of view of chemical ecology. These plants often lose their resistance against herbivores and pathogens, which then has to be replaced by man-made pesticides.",

Because viral life strategies are related in plants and animals, we suggest that a wider number of plant viruses may be controlled by alkaloids in Nature than the limited data imply. Viral multiplication can be controlled at the level of replication, transcription, protein biosynthesis, and posttranslational protein modification. The number of molecular targets is thus quite restricted for antiviral activities (compare Tables IV and VIII). The processing of DNA and RNA is extremely important for viruses, and it is not surprising that this area (intercalation in DNA, binding to DNA, inhibition of RNA and DNA polymerases) is probably one of the potential targets of alkaloids, for example, camptothecine (365,366), quinine, p-carboline alkaloids (1381, and acridone alkaloids (145). Other alkaloids could inhibit protein biosynthesis or posttranslational protein modifications. Examples include polyhydroxy alkaloids (150,212,410-414), cryptopleurine (404,444), haemanthamine (390), hippeas trine (148), narciclasine (451), pretazettine (390), sparteine and other QAs, and pseudolycorine (390).
