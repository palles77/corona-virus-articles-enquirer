The model describes a branching process for the spread of the infection and the effects of intervention measures. We discuss scenarios in which ring vaccination of direct contacts of infected persons is sufficient to contain an epidemic. Ring vaccination can be successful if infectious cases are rapidly diagnosed. However, because of the inherent stochastic nature of epidemic outbreaks, both the size and duration of contained outbreaks are highly variable. Intervention requirements depend on the basic reproduction number (R 0 ), for which different estimates exist. When faced with the decision of whether to rely on ring vaccination, the public health community should be aware that an epidemic might take time to subside even for an eventually successful intervention strategy.",

While new vaccines with fewer adverse consequences are being developed (3), the existing vaccines, which have potential side effects and may be lethal, are the only vaccines available (4, 5) . In the United States during the recent voluntary smallpox vaccination program, a limited number of healthcare workers volunteered for vaccination because of the risks associated with vaccination and the low for infection (6) . If an outbreak occurs, vaccination strategies include ring vaccination around diagnosed cases of smallpox or a mass vaccination to begin as soon as the first cases are diagnosed. Without natural smallpox infections, practical experience with ring vaccination against smallpox cannot be gained; accounts of the vaccination programs that eradicated smallpox in the 1970s are the only source of information (7) . Combined with information collected during the last decades of smallpox circulation, mathematical modeling offers a tool to explore various vaccination scenarios if an outbreak occurs (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) .",

We derived expressions for the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) and the effective reproduction number (R \u03c5 ). We investigated how effectiveness of ring vaccination depends on the time until diagnosis of a symptomatic case, the time to identify and vaccinate contacts in the close contact and casual contact ring, and the vaccination coverage required to contain an epidemic.",

The time until the epidemic is over is quite variable: on average it takes 82 days, in some cases it takes up to 1 year (range 22-334 days). To contrast the baseline scenario, in Figure 3C and D we show results for the case that R 0 = 10.46, i.e., twice the value of baseline scenario. To contain the epidemic, we now assumed that 80% of all contacts in the casual contact ring were vaccinated in time. The effective reproduction number R \u03c5 was 0.91. A fraction of 91.8% of transmissions took place in the casual contact ring. The mean number of infected persons during the epidemic was 101 (range 2-663), excluding the infected contacts vaccinated in time and 340 (range 2-2,175 persons) including those contacts. The mean time to extinction was 229 days (range 32 to >900 days). The time to extinction can be very long when R \u03c5 is near 1 because the epidemic can flare up again when a case by chance produces many secondary infections. A similar picture would result if, in addition to vaccinating casual contacts with a coverage of 55%, those contacts are monitored. The effective reproduction number is then 0.96; 93.0% of transmissions are in the casual contact ring.",

We varied those two variables separately while assuming that after diagnosis intervention took place within the parameters defined in the Table, i.e., with an R \u03c5 of 0.67 (Figure 4 ). While the number of cases increases almost linearly with the number of index cases, the dependency on the time to diagnosis shows the influence of the variable infectiousness during the infectious period. In the beginning, when infectiousness is high, the number of infected persons increases rapidly. Another rise occurs toward the end of the index patient's infectious period because the second-generation patients become infectious and produce the third generation of infected persons. Once the second generation of infected persons has the opportunity to disseminate the infection further, the range of possible outcomes increases greatly (range 6-221 infected persons). A similar picture emerges for the time needed to extinguish the outbreak. The duration of the outbreak increases when diagnosis is delayed during the first few days of infectiousness, then stays on a stable level, and finally increases again when diagnosis is delayed towards the end of the infectious period ( Figure 4D ). Therefore, diagnosing the first index case before the second generation of infected persons start transmitting the virus is important. If diagnosing the first case at the beginning of its infectious period is possible, the number of cases during the epidemic can be kept at a low level.",

The branching process approach does not allow for overlapping rings of contact, but we implicitly include such an effect by varying the effective transmission probability such that the distribution of transmissions over the infectious period agrees with empiric findings (8) . In other words, the decreasing probability of contacting new susceptible persons during the infectious period is incorporated in the decreasing transmission probability per contact. For larger numbers of index cases, our approach can be viewed as a worst-case scenario. Second, we assume that the population is completely susceptible, i.e., no residual immunity from vaccination in the pre-eradication era exists. This lack of immunity means that if previously vaccinated persons cannot become infectious to others, our results are too pessimistic, whereas if they become infectious with mitigated symptoms, our results might be too optimistic.",

On the basis of a low estimate for R 0 , Meltzer et al. (8) concluded that even quarantine alone can control the epidemic, as can vaccination alone, if the transmission rate is reduced sufficiently. However, the model does not allow analysis of how intervention parameters determine the reduction of the transmission rate. On the other hand, Kaplan et al. (10) conclude that with a large number of initial cases, mass vaccination will prevent more deaths than will a vaccination strategy based on contact tracing. Those authors explicitly take into account the limited resources available for tracing and vaccinating contacts, a limitation that is an important factor in large outbreaks. Also, they assume that infectivity is high during the prodromal phase. As in the model by Kaplan et al.

The effective reproduction number R \u03c5 , that determines the success of intervention is shown as a function of the basic reproduction number R 0 for a vaccination coverage of 50% in the casual contact ring. In A, contacts are not monitored after vaccination; in B, all identified contacts are isolated and cause not further transmission. The different lines in A are for different assumptions about how long it takes to trace and vaccinate those contacts. In B, it does not make a difference whether it takes 1, 2, or 3 days to find the contacts. If R 0 is 5, the intervention will be successful in both cases, if R 0 is 10, 50% coverage is no longer sufficient to curb the epidemic. Figure 6 . Here the critical vaccination coverage in the casual contact ring is shown as a function of the basic reproduction number R 0 for different assumptions about the time it takes to diagnose infectious persons. A, for the baseline assumption, that diagnosis is very quick after the beginning of the infectious period, a low coverage is sufficient if R 0 is 5, but for R 0 around 10 the coverage has to be at least 70% for the intervention to be successful. If the probability of being diagnosed shifts to later days of the infectious period, the situation quickly gets out of control and vaccination can no longer curb the epidemic. In B, the same is shown with the difference that here we assume that vaccinated contacts are successfully monitored such that they can no longer produce any secondary infections, even if their vaccination was too late to prevent them from becoming infectious. In this case a later diagnosis is not that influential, but nevertheless, if R 0 is 10, the vaccination coverage (or the percentage of contacts identified and monitored) must be at least 50% to guarantee success. In C, the critical coverage of the casual contact ring is shown as a function of the average number of contacts per day, again for the situation where vaccination is combined with monitoring of contacts. The average number of contacts was varied by varying the number of daily casual contacts. The effect is similar to that of varying R 0 through the transmission probability per contact as shown in B.",

While the model by Kaplan et al. is based on differential equations with exponentially distributed sojourn times in different compartments, our model is a stochastic model that is able to deal with more realistic distributions for sojourn times in different disease states. Also, our model can provide estimates for variability in outcomes (Discussion in [25] ). In a study by Halloran et al. (11) , a stochastic model for smallpox outbreaks in small, structured communities is described. In some respects the model is similar to ours, namely, that there is a distinction between household contacts and other contacts in the community with differing transmission probabilities. The values of most biologic parameters are choices similar to ours, with the exception of Halloran's assumption that persons are highly infectious during the prodromal phase. An important difference between the models is the natural limitation of the number of infected persons in any epidemic attributable to the rather small community size in Halloran's model. The nonlinear effects of saturation play a rather large role in determining the outbreak size, especially for less effective intervention measures. Also, Halloran's model seems to be too complex to derive an explicit formula for the basic reproduction number R 0 , and thus makes sensitivity analysis of the results based on that quantity much more tedious. One of the main differences, however, is the way that vaccination is incorporated into the model does not allow investigation of the effects of those parameters that largely determine the success of intervention, namely the time to diagnosis of new cases and the time needed to trace contacts. In a small closed community as the one described in the model, tracing of contacts is not that difficult, but in modern society with its increasing mobility the tracing of casual contacts can pose a big problem.",

Recently, some useful data about contact patterns have been collected during severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks, but a more systematic investigation of contact tracing is advisable.
