            "text": "Recent reports from the UNAIDS reveal that there are 34 million HIV-infected patients worldwide. 1 The number of annual AIDS-related deaths is estimated to be 2.5-3.3 million, or 25 million deaths overall. 1 Despite the development of resistance to many currently used therapeutics, HIV reverse transcriptase (HIV-RT) remains one of the major biological targets in the search of new drugs against HIV. HIV-RT plays a key role at early stages of viral replication by catalyzing the RNA-dependent synthesis, ribonuclease H and DNA-dependent DNA synthesis of proviral double-stranded DNA. 2 Compounds inhibiting HIV-RT are categorized as nucleoside/nucleotide (NRTI) and nonnucleoside (NNRTI) inhibitors. Nucleoside/nucleotide inhibitors bind in the active site of HIV-RT, while the NNRTIs comprise a structurally diverse spectrum of compounds capable of initiating conformational changes in HIV-RT by binding allosterically, which then results in the loss of HIV-RT polymerase activity. 3 The first generation of NNRTIs (nevirapine, 4 delavirdine, 5 efavirenz 6 ) displayed potent activity and low toxicity. However due to the high genetic variability of the virus, resistant strains with one or more point mutations in the RT binding pocket rapidly developed, and these first generation drugs proved to be problematic. 7 In contrast, second generation FDA-approved drugs including etravirine (TMC125) 8 and rilpivirine (TMC278) 9 proved to be highly active against both wild-type and the most frequent mutant HIV strains with enhanced safety profiles. Etravirine and rilpivirine are classified as diarylpyrimidines. More recently biaryl esters such as MK-4965 have further increased the structural diversity of the NNRTI inhibitors (Fig. 1) . 10 These biaryl ethers are also active against both wild-type and mutant RTs at nanomolar concentrations. Notably, the common feature of these two NNRTI types, as well as many others, particularly, the benzophenone derivatives 1 11 is the presence of three aromatic rings connected by short linkers (Fig. 2) .",

It is more attractive than a benzene ring because of increased potential to form polar intermolecular interactions and hydrogen bonding interactions, both of which can improve enzyme affinity and the pharmacokinetic properties of target compounds. Drawing upon the structural features of other highly active NNRTIs, 12, 13 we previously reported 14 a series of benzophenone derivatives of pyrimidines 2 with potent antiretroviral activity. Like the original benzophenones 1 reported by GlaxoSmithKline (Fig. 2) 11, 12 our compounds featured replacement of the distal benzene ring by uracil. As a logical extension of our previous investigations, herein we have prepared a new series of compounds with the central aromatic system replaced by uracil (Fig. 3) .",

Next, 1-cinnamyluracil (28) was prepared by condensation of 2,4-bis(trimethylsilyloxy)pyrimidine with cinnamyl bromide. The reaction mixture was refluxed in 1,2dichloroethane for 20 h to give 28 in a 90% yield. As noted by TLC, 1-cinnamyluracil (28) was the only product. Although different synthetic routes were employed, the physicochemical and spectral data matched those published previously. [17] [18] [19] It should be noted that Malik et al. 20, 21 initially incorrectly assigned the structure of 1-cinnamyluracil (28) to its isomerization product 22 when 28 and some of its analogues were synthesized using I 2 as a catalyst. The product of the isomerization is apparently the oxazolo[3,2-a]pyrimidin-7-one heterocyclic system as previously reported by Skaric. 22 Next, 1-cinnamyluracil (28) was treated with the corresponding benzyl halides in DMF solution in the presence of K 2 CO 3 (1.5 molar excess) at room temperature. 23 This reaction afforded the corresponding 3-benzyl-1-cinnamyl derivatives of uracil 29-34 with yields ranging between 71% and 81%.",

An excellent correlation between the benzyl of 19 and the corresponding moiety of the original 3DYA ligand was revealed.

Strong correlation between the benzophenone's and uracil's carbonyl groups is also noteworthy and hypothesized to be a consequence of steric preferences. As depicted in Figure 6 , unfavorable p-stacking interactions associated with mutations at Tyr181 and Tyr188 are also predicted, along with the lack of H-bonding at Asn103. These findings may explain the dramatic loss in activity against K103N and some other mutant HIV strains. As a result, further optimization of this region should be pursued.

This can be explained by the interactions of the groups of ring R 2 with Trp229 ( Fig. 3) , while proton substitution in position 4 disrupts the favorable CH-p stacking (compounds 17 and 20). In contrast, the extended groups in position 4 of ring R 1 are not favorable as they reach solvent accessible area at the entrance of the pocket. The absence of binding for compound 20 is due to steric restrictions between the methyl group in the ortho position of the R 2 ring and the carbonyl oxygens in the central uracil ring R 3 since they are densely packed in the pocket. However it appears there are still enough degrees of freedom to properly orientate the R 2 ring when only one methyl group in the ortho position is present (compound 18).",

Moreover, the double mutant K103N/ Y181C was detrimental for anti-HIV-1 activity. Some cinnamyl derivatives showed moderate anti-HCMV activity, however this was not the case for the phenyloxyethyl derivatives, which were essentially inactive. Efforts are currently underway to improve the promising activity noted by several of the compounds. New structural modifications guided by additional docking efforts are currently being explored. For example, it may prove that the N 1 -side chain can be optimized for maximizing interactions with the amino acid landscape by use of H-bond donors and/or introducing conformational restrictions.

The antiviral assays were based on inhibition of virus-induced cytopathicity or plaque formation in human embryonic lung (HEL) fibroblasts, African green monkey cells (Vero), human epithelial cells (HeLa) or Madin-Darby canine kidney cells (MDCK) . Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID 50 of virus (1 CCID 50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) or with 20 plaque forming units (PFU) (VZV) in the presence of varying concentrations of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity or plaque formation was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC 50 or compound concentration required to reduce virus-induced cytopathogenicity or viral plaque formation by 50%.",
