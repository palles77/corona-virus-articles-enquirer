Therefore, appropriate and evidence-based handling and management strategies in moving forward universal health coverage and sustainable development goals (SDGs) are essential components to the China-Africa health development initiatives. It is necessary to understand how to strengthen robust and sustainable \"One Health\" approach implementation in national and regional public health and disaster risk reduction programs.

            "text": "The China-Africa partnership is one of the most important geopolitical and economic relationships of the 21st century that has ushered a new era of investment in mutual health development [1] . China has become the world's second-largest economy and offered Africa various based on win-win cooperation. Traditionally, China is willing to work together with Africa to achieve mutual benefits by taking advantage of its status as assistanceprovider in tackling infectious diseases of poverty [2, 3] . Furthermore, since Africa is home to seven of world's ten fastest growing economies, Chinese investments in the health sector in the continent can produce substantial financial gains and generate invaluable public health commodities and other goods that are much needed [4, 5] . The need for an African Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) was recognized at the African Union Special Summit on HIV and AIDS, TB and malaria held in Abuja, Nigeria, in July 2013. The Africa CDC has launched year with the establishment of an African Surveillance and Response Unit, which will include an Emergency Operations Center and exchanges on China's national disease surveillance and reporting system [4] . Currently, Africa continent is experiencing a rapid economic growth, with a gross domestic product (GDP) of $ 2.4 trillion USD in 2013 and is estimated to increase to $ 3.3 trillion USD by 2020. Health-care spending rose from $ 28.4 billion USD in 2000 to $ 117 billion USD in 2012 across African countries [6] [7] [8] . The fact that Sub-Saharan Africa accounts for 14% of the world's population and 24% of the global burden of infectious diseases caused by poverty, millions of people could be lifted out of poverty through bilateral trade and cooperation between China and Africa. Increasing and robust new commitments of outbreak and accounts for about 85% of all deaths recorded (a total of 585 suspected cases, 56 confirmed cases and 73 deaths recorded since disease onset in August 2015. In 2014, US CDC estimated the yearly number of LF cases to be between 300,000 to 500,000 resulting in about 5,000 deaths across West Africa. LF is endemic in most parts of West Africa with sporadic cases occurring in other African countries every year. Studies have predicted approximately 80% of Liberia and Sierra Leone, 40% of Nigeria, and 30% of Benin to be at risk of LF through spatial analysis. In Nigeria, approximately 4883 cases and 277 deaths have been reported from 2012 to date. Due to a paucity of data, the actual number of cases in other West African countries to date is still unknown. However, seroprevalence studies in the past have shown a prevalence of Lassa IgG antibodies in 8% to 52% of the general population in Sierra Leone and in Guinea, and as high as 25% to 55% among inhabitants of tropical rain forest and 29% to 40% in hospital staff of Gueckedou and Lola Prefectures in Guinea. Direct transmission from rodent to humans mainly occurs through inhalation of primary aerosols from infected rodent urine, ingestion of food contaminated with rodent excreta or by direct contact with broken skin. Regional and nosocomial outbreaks of LF are commonplace in LF endemic countries and played a major role in recent outbreak. In Nigeria, the 2016 LF outbreak has been estimated to have an overall case fatality rate of 48% and 60% in confirmed cases; the impact on healthcare workers due to inadequately equipped, weak preventive measure for hospital associated infections (HAI) and well trained staff and facilities with poor laboratory and clinical management practices were the main reasons for a dearth of data. While there is no known vaccine for LF, early supportive care and treatment with ribavirin. Prevention efforts include isolation of cases, implementing infection control measures such as barrier nursing supplies, rodent control and practicing adequate food hygiene (storing grain and other foodstuffs in rodent-proof containers) and personal hygiene. Although treatment for LF is available, early diagnosis, prevention and prompt management of infection are necessary (Table 1) . These growing public health emergencies and challenges prompted a memorandum on building the Africa CDC that was signed by the African Union with two parties are including Chinese and US govemrnents. This cooperation exploring ways of further cooperation and lessons learning from China's national disease surveillance and reporting system model [1, 4] . Based on a unified and integrated plan, China and US government are willing to leverage their respective strengths to support the African Union in building this system, which will be the first regional disease surveillance system on the African continent from the Ebola crisis. It is important to strengthen disease surveillance and monitoring efforts at the regional level in providing technical expertise and response coordination in future health emergencies, address complex health challenges, and build needed capacity responses, responsible for disease surveillance, investigations, analysis, and reporting trends and anomalies. This is a landmark event in African ownership of improving health across the continent. The US CDC looks forward to engaging in this partnership for many years to come to advance public health across Africa and global health security [1, 4] Results from the First and Second China-Africa Ministerial Health Development Forum held in Beijing, China and Cape Town, South Africa in 2013 and 2015, respectively, showed that China-Africa health development partnership had entered a new collaborative paradigm with great global health opportunities [1, 5, 8] . Chinese and African health ministers have adopted a declaration to increase access to facilities, medication, health workers and training, linking Chinese scholars with those in Africa into shared responsibility and global solidarity [5] . Importantly, China-Africa collaboration in health development will use \"One Health\" approach to set the collaborative priorities, such as developing innovative information and communication technology for health, building regional surveillance systems, improving the core capacities of international health regulations and enhancing the using regulation of traditional medicines, etc [1, 6, 9] .",

This laudable mutual commitment was realized through the full operationalisation of the Africa CDC in early 2016 supported by the Chinese government, including providing infrastructure construction, equipment, information system, expertise, and professional training, etc. As well fostering continuous strengthening African states public health prevention and control system under the Chinese supports are also provided through comprehensively capacity building (e.g., staff, postdocs and students) and providing technical assistance and technology transfering to Africa CDC sub-regional centres. The benefits of the translation of the immense mutual public health priority aligns \"Africa Union health vision 2063\" in the fields of infectious diseases of poverty surveillance and elimination, emergency preparedness timely response to early alert and risk communication capabilities against public health emergencies and disaster crises events. Previously, China has already provided two million US dollars cash aid for the Africa CDC in terms of capacity building and the on-site Chinese experts visit for the regional collaboration with other partners' support [4] .

National and regional public health emergencies, biosecurity surveillance, preparedness, rapid response, and recovery policy and strategies are robust and sustainable assets for socioeconomic transformation in line with Africa Health Strategy (2016-2030), the Africa Union 2063 agenda and in attaining SDGs [1, 4, 10, 11] .",

In addition, leveraging on the unique \"One Health\" approach to transform health care and health policy and to prioritize collaborative programs can be extended from infectious diseases to maternal and child health and health disparity in the poorest populations in Africa [1, [10] [11] [12] . Secondly, building regional surveillance systems is another way to enhance the local health system. The importance of implementing a local and national \"One Health\" policy and programs holds tremendous prospects, such as co-tackling the epidemiological and environmental challenges, and accelerating in the transition from control to elimination of infectious diseases under China-Africa collaboration [5, 15] . Furthermore, it has potential to revolutionize national health systems, policies and strategic priorities and the patterns in health financing and resources allocation of African countries that require careful understanding of the local context of diverse stressors and drivers [21, 13] . These will continue to dominate the performance and effectiveness of \"One Health\" in threats and epidemics prevention strategies and policies on healthcare and health outcomes. Thus, assessing health impact especially how greenhouse gas and ozone emissions, rising temperature and environmental pollution resulted in climate change impacts to health ecosystem, such as population movement, animal trading and ecology of vectorborne disease and ill health, aging, chronic disease, drug use and domestic violence, inequity and poverty [16] . Thirdly, improving the core capacities of international health regulations is the sustained efforts to improve the human welfare. For example, China's response impacting the global health fund (e.g., malaria, HIV/AIDS, schistosomiasis, Ebola, influenza, TB, hepatitis, etc.) has shown robust global health leadership engagement [1, 2, 3] . The leadership reflected in the strategic mobilization and investment of resources fostering more easily accessible, availability and cost effectiveness of prevention and treatment interventions to resources limited countries including African countries [1] . The growing mutual China-Africa win-win collaboration spans to technical expertise, technology transfer and capacity development using scientific and advanced methods to tackle the disease, and have enhanced their commitment to respect the dignity of the people such as Chinese Ebola outbreak emergency response in West Africa. Fourthly, enhancing the use and management of traditional medicines could improve the community involvement in health care and extend the trade among countries. So far, trade between China and Africa is projected to reach $ 385 million USD a year by 2015. Increasingly, embracing \"One Health\" strategy to increase universal coverage of healthcare is significant as sharing China's rich expertise and lessons learnt in strengthening health systems and tackling public health burden both in China and Africa communities. Thus, Africa has the opportunity to improve capacity of community health workers to reach remotes rural communities living beyond the margins of traditional health care systems [5, 10] .",

These have been resulting in significant direct and indirect health impacts including limited access to food, clean water, medicines, pre-existing mental health and other health services. Conflict-affected countries have not achieved a single Millennium Development Goal and have significantly higher maternal and infant mortality rates compared to stable and peaceful countries. Natural disasters affect nearly 160 million people each year, with a disproportionate effect on populations and environment. There is also limited quantity of highquality and integrated research to build evidence \"One Health\" approach response. For example, recent emerging Zika virus is known to be circulating in Latin America, America, Africa, Asia-Pacific and Middle East regions due to climate change and rapid urbanization, intense regional and global travel and trade impact on Zika virus risk transmission and documented congenital complications on fetal and maternal health. Efforts to strengthen regional and global public health emergencies surveillance and preparedness should be maintained in order to better characterize the intensity of Aedes and Culex vectorial capacity, asymptomatic or syndromic viral circulation and geographical infection spread, epidemiology and laboratory monitoring of Zika virus related complications in vulnerable settings. We found that most existing and emerging infectious diseases of poverty and chronic diseases public health programs are based more on top-down and anecdotal experiences rather than accurate research in fostering an integrated humananimal and environment or \"One Health\" community practice in most vulnerable settings in Africa and China (Table 1) .",

These projects and activities aim at tackling the persistent and growing burden of infectious diseases of poverty, maternal and child morbidity and mortality, and responding timely to the global health concerns and emergency response called on emerging threats and epidemics in the continent. Some examples of the landmark achievements include the China-Zanzibar and China-Tanzania projects on sharing Chinese lessons and experiences in infectious diseases to support schistosomiasis and malaria prevention and control in African countries respectively, as well as Chinese maternal-child heath safety and children nutrition, dissemination and transfer experiences in Ghana [9, 25, 26] . Furthermore, China-Comoros support to national malaria elimination that led to interruption of transmission and reducing in malaria mortality to zero in the last eight years in Comoros [8, 9, 10] . Likewise, understanding strategic public health financing and human resources systems capacity is necessary in promoting uptake and efficiency of Chinese global health initiatives and innovations in strengthening healthcare delivery system and quality outcomes in LMICs including Africa, Asia-Pacific, Middle East and Latin American countries. Strikingly again, during the West Africa Ebola outbreaks in 2014-2015, the Chinese assistance in response valued at $ 120 million USD and more than 1,200 experienced medical professionals were deployed in the frontline affected and neighboring communities to combat and contain the rapid spread of the Ebola virus epidemics [8] . In addition to the mobile biosafety laboratory, China also built permanent and well-equipped public biosafety laboratory in Seirra Leone and DR Congo to improve the national capacity to detect, prevent and respond to future threats and epidemics. Over 30 batches of public health, clinical medicine and laboratory experts were dispatched in 11 African countries in scaling up public healthcare delivery capacity and training of health workers and communities in risk assessment, communication, and response measures in effective Ebola, malaria, schistosomiasis prevention and containment, amongst other shared responsibility and mutual commitment [1, 4, 8, 9, [25] [26] [27] .",

Globalization of travel and trade is ever increasing local, national and global emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases threats and their impacts on human and animal health. Resolving the persistent and unprecedented rising of emerging and reemerging epidemics, and new priorities of Ebola, Zika, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) requires collaborative and mutual cooperation with governments, bilateral and multilateral initiatives, including boosting private-public partnerships, regional and international organizations in achieving the global health security threat and agenda 2030 [2, 3, 5, 6, 7] . For example, China has dispatched more than 1,000 medical experts to resist West Africa Ebola epidemics through contributions to coordinated international emergency response efforts that helped to contain Ebola virus transmission dynamics and spread that retrieved lives of over 12,200 people [1, 5, 6] . Similarly, Zika virus belongs to the family Flaviviridae, genus Flavivirus, and includes Africa subtype and Asia subtype. It is a mosquitoborne virus primarily transmitted by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, sexual transmission; blood transmission and mother-to-fetus transmission have been also reported. Zika virus can go through blood-brain barrier and infect central nervous system. Symptoms are generally mild and self-limited, but recent evidence suggests a possible association between maternal Zika virus infection and adverse fetal outcomes, such as congenital microcephaly, as well as a possible association with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. In absence of safe vaccine or effective antiviral Zika medication for prevention and control Zika virus infection, early laboratorial diagnosis includes nucleic acid detection, serological test, and isolation of virus and epidemiology and clinical risk assessment and syndromic surveillance is crucial [1, 3, 13] . Nevertheless, there remains a need to build a platform with function of effective surveillance, recovery, preparedness, consultation and communication, and to share surveillance based on the principle of sincerity, real time problem-solving and results-giving, and good faith towards collaborative global health solutions [4, [14] [15] [16] .",

Enhanced disease surveillance response, community capacity development and strain capacity can provide significant opportunities in health education and promotion, shared responsibility, positive behavior changes and best practices by different health facilities, training health practitioners of diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation services. Identification of local and national health needs and evidence-based effectiveness of \"One Health\" solutions are urgently needed to improve appropriate and sustainable resource development policies and strategic programs across Africa. Such new partnership initiatives linked to China Belt and Silk Initiative action plan should attract more indigenous and international partners and stakeholders, more qualified multidisciplinary professionals to work, communicate and share experiences and lessons collectively.
