            "text": "It is likely that gene-based vaccines will enter the human vaccine area soon. A few veterinary vaccines employing this concept have already been licensed, and a multitude of clinical trials against infectious diseases or different forms of cancer are ongoing. Highly important when developing novel vaccines are the safety aspects and also new adjuvants and delivery techniques needs to be carefully investigated so that they meet all short-and long-term safety requirements. One novel in vivo delivery method for plasmid vaccines is electroporation, which is the application of short pulses of electric current immediately after, and at the site of, an injection of a genetic vaccine. This method has been shown to significantly augment the transfection efficacy and the subsequent vaccine-specific immune responses. However, the dramatic increase in delivery efficacy offered by electroporation has raised concerns of potential increase in the risk of integration of plasmid DNA into the host genome. Here, we demonstrate the safety and lack of integration after immunization with a high dose of a multigene HIV-1 vaccine delivered intradermally using the needle free device Biojector 2000 together with electroporation using Derma Vax TM DNA Vaccine Skin Delivery System. We demonstrate that plasmids persist in the skin at the site of injection for at least four months after immunization. However, no association between plasmid DNA and genomic DNA could be detected as analyzed by qPCR following field inversion gel electrophoresis separating heavy and light DNA fractions. We will shortly initiate a phase I clinical trial in which healthy volunteers will be immunized with this multiplasmid HIV-1 vaccine using a combination of the delivery methods jet-injection and intradermal electroporation.",

In order to verify the safety and efficacy, the two applications require different approaches. For plasmid immunization, the aim is to rapidly induce an immune response, while for safety rea-sons, the plasmid should preferably be cleared rapidly from the body/tissue. In contrast, gene therapy applications aim at introducing the genetic material in the target tissue without evoking an immune response, which could serve to eliminate cells expressing the therapeutic agent.",

However, the plasmids are eventually, and often rapidly, cleared from the organs and are normally found exclusively at the site of injection at later time points [12] . For safety reasons, the presence of plasmid in gonads has been given special attention, but in no study has plasmid been detected in testis or ovaries for more than one week after immunization (Table 1) . Moreover, there is no indication that either the inserted gene or the plasmid backbone itself plays any major role for the distribution or persistence of the plasmid [9] . The introduction of in vivo electroporation for increasing the uptake and immunogenicity of plasmid vaccines has re-energized the field of genetic immunization and currently several electroporation devices are being evaluated in clinical trials against cancer and infectious diseases (http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=electroporation). However, since electroporation dramatically increases the transfection efficacy, concerns have been raised that the method might affect the persistence of plasmid DNA in the target tissue. This may result in increased risk of integration of foreign DNA into the host chromosomal DNA as reported in a single publication [13] .",

            "text": "Plasmid vaccines have been developed and evaluated in clinical trials for the prevention against, or treatment of, many different infectious diseases and cancers. Plasmid vaccines have shown an excellent safety profile and more than ten years have passed since the first clinical trials including genetic vaccines were concluded [22, 23] . However, plasmid vaccines have so far only induced moderate immune responses in man and the best responses have been obtained after boosting with recombinant microbial vectors or recombinant proteins. However, the application of in vivo electroporation increases the transfection efficacy and the immunogenicity of plasmid vaccines in animal models several fold [24] [25] [26] [27] . Currently, several clinical trials are ongoing in order to determine if the benefits of this methodology can be translated into successful use in humans. However, the significant increase in transfection efficacy observed after electroporation has raised concerns of prolonged persistence of plasmid in the target tissue and increased risk of integration of plasmid DNA into the host genome. Although electroporation is unlikely to influence the distribution of plasmids to other organs it is reasonable to assume that the more efficient transfection could affect the local persistence of plasmid at the site of injection [28, 29] . As shown in the present study, the plasmid DNA is indeed rapidly cleared from all organs except the site of the injection and the underlying muscle. At days 40 and 60 very low amounts of plasmid could be found in spleen and lungs, respectively. However, by day 120 no plasmid could be detected in any of the analyzed organs beside the skin at the site of injection. The presence of plasmid in the spleen at day 40 could potentially be a result of immune cells obtaining plasmid at the site of injection followed by trafficking to the spleen but the reason for the low, but detectable, levels of plasmid observed in the lung at day 60 is unclear. Possible explanations for the detected plasmid in lung might be that the mice inhaled plasmid during grooming (as there are high levels of plasmid in the skin at day 40 and 60) or that plasmids temporarily get retained in the fine mesh of capillaries surrounding the alveoli in the lung. As the analyses showed that plasmid was retained at the site of injection up to 120 days, we performed an extensive integration study of the skin from the injection site. The qPCR used for quantifying plasmids in extracted DNA allows for detection of as low as 10 plasmid copies/g of total DNA, corresponding to a sensitivity of 10 plasmids/150,000 diploid cells. The results from integration experiments confirmed the persistence of plasmid in the injection site skin at day 60 but showed that there was no association of plasmid DNA with the host chromosomal DNA (Table 3) . A previous study has shown that the transfected and antigen-expressing cells are concentrated in the deepest layer of the skin but also found in the hypodermis as well as in the dermis and epidermis [30] . It is unknown in what compartment the majority of plasmids are retained, but one can assume that both intra-and extracellular localization is involved.",

The level of integration demonstrated in the study was very low and would in a \"worst case scenario\" result in a level of integration similar to the rate of spontaneous geneinactivating mutations [31] . Contrasting these results there are reports indicating that the increased immune responses induced by electroporation results in a more efficient clearing of plasmid/antigen as a consequence of a more potent cytotoxic response killing transfected antigen-expressing cells [20, 24, 32] Moreover, experiments conducted with the aim to incorporate genetic material into the host chromosome indeed confirms that plasmid vectors are highly inefficient for this purpose [33] and that viral vectors are much more powerful for purposes of integrative gene therapy. These studies thus serve as additional safety data for plasmid DNA vaccine applications, emphasizing the difficulties in achieving integration using plasmid DNA injection.",

The safety of the vaccine is further strengthened by the fact that the amount of DNA used in the mice, 200 g, corresponds to roughly 10 mg of plasmid DNA/kg body weight and this is substantially higher than the 8-10 g of plasmid DNA/kg body weight that is planned for the clinical testing of this vaccine strategy. Furthermore, the skin delivery, in contrast to intramuscular delivery, allows for the possibility to visually inspect the injection site, thus making it easier to detect any potentially malignant changes. In conclusion, a high dose of highly immunogenic vaccine plasmids delivered intradermally by jet injection followed by electroporation was shown to be safe and did not result in integration of plasmid DNA into the host genome. The vaccine and delivery method presented here were recently approved by the Swedish Medical Products Agency and will shortly enter a phase I clinical trial in Stockholm involving healthy non-HIV infected volunteers.",
