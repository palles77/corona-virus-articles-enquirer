The specific virus, the tissue infected, stimuli for activation, and the nature of the host immune response impact the nature of viral latency. Some viruses are metabolically inactive when latent, while others continue to replicate at low levels that may be determined by the effectiveness of the host's immune response. Multiple factors contribute to viral reactivation after transplantation, including graft rejection and therapy, immune suppression (especially reduction of T-cell mediated, cytotoxic immunity), inflammation, and tissue injury. Numerous cellular pathways are involved in the control of viral replication and are activated after transplantation, such as nuclear factor kB, IkB, and JAK-STAT (the Janus family of protein tyrosine kinases (JAKS) and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins). Antirejection therapy can also result in a significant release of pro-inflammatory cytokines which may increase viral replication. In general, reactivation of viruses, especially late after transplantation, should suggest new immune defects (e.g., cancer) or relative over-immunosuppression.",

In general, latency is considered to be the absence of viral replication, with viral genomes present in the cell without replication or spread. Studies of other viruses, such as Friend virus in mice, suggest that protective antiviral immunity is an active process mediated by 'leaky' (low-level) viral replication. The existence of true latency, as opposed to low-level replication, remains controversial. Herpesviruses make 'latency' proteins that both control viral persistence within the target cell and influence other cellular processes. The latent state is characterized by low levels or the absence of detectable viral antigens, minimal transcription of productive or lytic cycle genes, and expression of the latency-associated viral transcripts. Viral latency may be occasionally interrupted, leading to reactivation and spread of infectious virus with or without recurrent disease. EBV establishes latency in B lymphocytes in association with expression of a limited set of viral genes. Immune control of HSV infection and replication occurs at the level of skin or mucosa during initial or recurrent infection and in the dorsal root ganglion, where latency and reactivation are controlled by immune mechanisms mediated by interferons, myeloid and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, and other cytokines. Despite similarities, the molecular details and mechanisms of latency and reactivation vary considerably among the herpesviruses. Mechanisms responsible for maintenance of latency are unclear.",

Thus, immune injury, inflammatory cytokines, and ischemia-reperfusion injury stimulate viral replication and change expression of virus-specific cell-surface receptors.

The respiratory viruses are the most common new infections after transplantation, including RSV, influenza, parainfluenza, and adenovirus. Newer respiratory pathogens (metapneumovirus and SARS coronavirus) also cause major infections in immunocompromised hosts. Gastrointestinal viruses such as rotavirus or Norwalk virus are common and can cause significant diarrhea and dehydration; diarrheal syndromes may alter absorbance and metabolism of calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., cyclosporine and tacrolimus), with unexpectedly elevated levels of tacrolimus. Nonimmune patients can acquire primary EBV, CMV, VZV, parvovirus B19, and other infections in the post-transplantation period. In the absence of previous immunity and with the attenuation of immunity due to the immunosuppressive regimen, new infections are often more severe and prolonged than in the general population. For example, parvovirus B19 infection is often more persistent and relapsing in transplantation patients, occasionally complicated by the unusual findings of hepatitis, myocarditis, pneumonitis, glomerulopathy, arthritis, or transplantation graft dysfunction.",

            "text": "The effects of viral infection are conceptualized as 'direct' and 'indirect' (see Table 2 ). This classification serves to separate the tissueinvasive viral infection (cellular and tissue injury) from effects mediated by inflammatory responses (e.g., cytokines) or by alterations in host immune responses. Syndromes such as fever and neutropenia (e.g., with CMV infection) or invasive disease resulting in pneumonia, enteritis, meningitis, and encephalitis are considered direct effects. Indirect effects of viral infections are generally thought to be immunomodulatory responses to viral infections mediated by cytokines, chemokines, and/or growth factors. The impact of these effects is diverse and includes systemic immune suppression predisposing to other opportunistic infections (notably with CMV or HCV infections). In addition, viral infection may alter the expression of cell-surface antigens (e.g., major histocompatibility antigens) provoking graft rejection and/or cause disregulated cellular proliferation (contributing to atherogenesis in cardiac allografts, obliterative bronchiolitis in lung transplantation, or to oncogenesis). Increased viral replication and persistence may contribute to allograft injury (fibrosis) or chronic rejection. Infection with one virus may stimulate replication of other viruses in a form of viral 'cross talk'. As was noted above, infection with HHV-6 and/or HHV-7 serve as risk factors for CMV disease and vice versa. The direct and indirect effects of HHV-6 reactivation can be significant: HHV-6 infection is associated with high levels of IL-6 and TNF-a, and in pediatric renal or bone marrow transplantation, HHV-6 reactivation is strongly associated with acute rejection. Co-infection with HCV and CMV predicts an accelerated course for hepatitis. Co-infection with CMV and EBV increases the risk for post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD) by 12-20-fold. A more theoretical concern is that T-cell responses against viral infections are thought to produce cross-reacting immune responses against graft antigens, possibly via 'alternative recognition' within the T-cell receptor. This cross-reactivity is termed 'heterologous immunity' and may provoke abrogation of graft tolerance.",

            "text": "When available, antiviral therapies (such as acyclovir, ganciclovir, ribavirin, lamivudine, and oseltamivir) are often essential. The toxicity of some agents (such as cidofovir, foscarnet, and ribavirin) may complicate management, notably in the face of reduced renal function in patients receiving calcineurin inhibitors as part of the immunosuppressive regimen. The duration of therapy is often longer in transplant patients than in normal hosts, and often reflects the ability to reduce the overall level of immunosuppression, that is. less immunosuppression may result in a shorter treatment time. The increased information provided by molecular diagnostics may allow for more directed treatment regimens. Antiviral therapy is often used for prophylaxis in the post-transplantation period, especially for individuals at risk for primary infection. In general, acyclovir and related agents are used to prevent HSV and VZV and ganciclovir or valganciclovir to prevent CMV as well as HSV and VZV. The relative advantages of universal prophylaxis (i.e., the use of antiviral medication in all susceptible patients for a period after transplantation) or monitoring with preemptive (early) therapy remain to be established. Meta-analyses suggest that universal prophylaxis with antiviral medications in SOT recipients reduces CMV disease and CMV-associated opportunistic infections, graft rejection, and mortality; their use is recommended for high risk individuals (CMV-positive recipients and in CMV-negative recipients of CMV-positive organs). Some studies indicate that universal prophylaxis and preemptive therapy are effective in reducing the incidence of CMV disease. In the HSCT setting, where the risks of bone marrow toxicity from valganciclovir are higher, many programs choose to use preemptive monitoring and therapy for CMV.",

Immunoglobulins (i.e., intravenous immune globulins (IVIG), CMV, and HBV hyper-immune globulins (both prepared from plasma preselected for high titer antibodies to CMV and HBV, respectively), as well as monoclonal antibodies such as those for RSV) have been helpful in preventing and treating viral infections, likely due to both direct and indirect immunomodulatory properties. A significant percent of patients have post-transplantation hypogammaglobulinemia, which has been linked to increased mortality and may benefit from globulin repletion. This may be most apparent in the setting of active infections, as well as prophylaxis. Immunostimulatory agents, such as interferon-alpha used to treat hepatitis C, can be helpful at treating the viral infection but may perturb the relationship between the graft and the host, precipitating rejection. Reversal of neutropenia can be done using colony stimulating factors such as G-CSF, which is generally well tolerated in sold organ transplantation patients.",
