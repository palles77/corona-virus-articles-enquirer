Rotaviruses were demonstrated by stool electron microscopy (EM) in 132 of these cases (25\"4 per cent), but in none of IO8 age-and sex-matched controls. Non-specific cases, where no potentially pathogenic organism could be demonstrated in stools submitted for EM, viral and bacterial culture accounted for 46 per cent of cases. If EM of the stools had not been performed the proportion of non-specific cases would have risen to 85 per cent, thus demonstrating the importance of this technique in diagnosis.",

Comparison of the rotavirus and non-specific groups yielded many results outlined below (Tables IV, V and VI) . Pyrexia was significantly commoner in the rotavirus cases (P < o.oo2) and maximum temperatures recorded in hospital tended to be higher in this group (Table IV) . Minor differences were observed in mean age, sex distribution, hospital stay, duration of diarrhoea, previous history of gastroenteritis and the incidence of vomiting, but these differences were not statistically significant (P > o-o5). The reporting of vomiting occurring before diarrhoea was significantly commoner in the rotavirus group (P < o.0I). Although a history of contact with another case of gastroenteritis was found more commonly in the rotavirus group, the difference between the two groups did not reach statistical significance (o. IO > P > o'o5); however, when such a history was confined to contact with adult cases, the difference was more pronounced and was statistically significant (P < o'o5). A significantly larger proportion of the rotavirus cases had symptoms or signs of an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) (P < o.oi) and a similar difference was noted for patients with visibly inflamed tympanic membranes (P < o.ooi). Three cases with pneumonia, diagnosed on both clinical and radiological criteria, and two of bronchitis, were observed amongst the rotavirus group; no such features were encountered in the non-specific group. Rectal bleeding, rashes, conjunctivitis, meningism and febrile convulsions were noted in a small number of cases and, interestingly, in none of the cases with a rash was there evidence of an enteroviral infection. The necessity to use intravenous fluids was significantly higher in the rotavirus group (P < o.ooi). The gastroenteritis patients as a whole tended to be of lower weight than normal on admission although the skewing of these figures may be partly accounted for by dehydration. Small differences in haemoglobin, ESR, urea, electrolytes and bicarbonate levels in the blood were noted, but none of these reached statistical significance. Hypernatraemic dehydration, a condition seen less frequently nowadays in association with gastroenteritis, was not significantly commoner in any group of patients.",

Similar patterns of seasonal variation in rotavirus and adenovirus identification in faeces have been documented, 5, 7 and one report suggests that this variation for rotaviruses may be lost in tropical climates. 17 The failure in this study to find rotaviruses in the stools of control patients without diarrhoea correlates with other similar reports, a, 5, 15,16 A similar age distribution to that shown in this study has been previously described for rotavirus gastroenteritis, the relatively lower incidence in the under six months age group being explained by maternally-derived antibody. 18, 19 The male predominance in gastroenteritis, a well-documented but poorly understood feature, was reproduced in both rotavirus and non-specific groups in this study. Pyrexia has been said to occur in 5o-6o per cent of cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis, 9, 20 although one group in Romford noted fever as a feature of all Ioo of their cases. 14 In this study, pyrexia is seen to be significantly commoner and generally more severe in the rotavirus than in the non-specific cases. The incidence of vomiting in this survey of 93\"2 per cent in the rotavirus cases correlates well with other reports,*, 18 and although one of these studies suggested that vomiting was commoner in rotavirus than in other forms of gastroenteritis, 2 this study, based on larger numbers of patients and statistical analysis, cannot confirm this finding. However, this study does show that vomiting occurring prior to the onset of diarrhoea is a significant feature of the rotavirus infection. As the study year went by, an impression was formed that a definite history of contact was obtainable more often in the rotavirus cases than in other groups, and although there was a difference in this respect between the rotavirus and non-specific groups, this difference did not qualify for statistical significance. Although an outbreak ofrotavirus gastroenteritis has been described involving adults without the known infection of children, 8 the finding of rotaviruses in adult stools has usually been acompanied by no intestinal symptoms, zl The finding in this study of a significantly higher incidence of a history of contact with an adult with gastroenteritis in the rotavirus than in the non-specific cases would suggest that adults may represent a reservoir for potential rotavirus infection in infants.",

The frequency of otitis media in rotavirus gastroenteritis in this study was lower than in two other reports, 21,1~ but this series demonstrates it as a significant feature of this illness. The finding of three cases with pneumonia and two with bronchitis amongst the rotavirus group without any such cases in other groups was surprising. These findings suggest that when gastroenteritic symptoms occur in a patient with URTI, otitis media, pneumonia or bronchitis, rotaviruses should be sought in the stools rather than accepting the diarrhoea or vomiting as being secondary to the respiratory or ear infection. The failure to find rotaviruses in the stools of any control patients with similar infections, but without diarrhoea, would support the role of the rotavirus as being responsible for the intestinal features of such illnesses. What role rotaviruses play, if any, in the non-intestinal features of such illnesses is not known; there is no record of demonstration of these viruses from throat, bronchial or aural secretions of such cases.",

Gram-staining provided 80 per cent of diagnosis, Gram-staining and culture together, 85 per cent. CIE alone provided 9o per cent of diagnosis, LA alone, 82 per cent (but meningococcal cases were not so well detected, being 72\"5 per cent by CIE and 71\"2 per cent by LA). The best combination of tests was Gram-staining plus CIE which provided a 95 per cent successful diagnosis.Difficulties were encountered in that H. influenzae and tuberculous meningitis sometimes produced false-positive pneumococcal CIE, and some pneumococcal and meningococcal types produced cross reactions with LA. Some of the undiagnosed cases had epidemiological features of meningococcal meningitis. The authors concluded that serological and Gram-stain diagnosis of the three common types of bacterial meningitis might avoid the need for expensive cultural techniques, which require a good standard of laboratory facilities. These simple techniques can be performed on CSF samples which have been stored at low temperatures, or transported long distances, and so lend themselves particularly to use in developing countries.",
