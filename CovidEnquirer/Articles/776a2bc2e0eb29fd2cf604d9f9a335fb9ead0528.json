In the present study, in vitro Caco-2 cell, in situ single-pass intestinal perfusion and in vivo pharmacokinetics study were performed to investigate the effects of COS on the intestinal absorption of phenolic acids. The pharmacological effects such as antiviral activity improvement by COS were verified by MDCK cell damage inhibition rate after influenza virus propagation. The observations from in vitro Caco-2 cell showed that the absorption of phenolic acids in Flos Lonicerae extract could be improved by COS. Meanwhile, COS at the same low, medium and high concentrations caused a significant, concentration-dependent increase in the P app -value for phenolic acids compared to the control group (p < 0.05), and was all safe for the Caco-2 cells. The observations from single-pass intestinal perfusion in situ model showed that the intestinal absorption of phenolic acids can be enhanced by COS. Meanwhile, the absorption enhancing effect of phenolic acids might be saturable in different intestine sites. In pharmacokinetics study, COS at dosage of 25 mg/kg improved the bioavailability of phenolic acids in Flos Lonicerae extract to the greatest extent, and was safe for gastrointestine from morphological observation. Besides, treatment with Flos Lonicerae extract with COS at dosage of 25 mg/kg prevented MDCK cell damage upon influenza virus propagation better than that of control. All findings above suggested that COS at dosage of 25 mg/kg might be safe and effective absorption enhancer for improving the bioavailability of phenolic acids and the antiviral activity in vitro in Flos Lonicerae extract.",

And oral preparations of Flos Lonicerae extract are usually more accepted for patients than injections owing to their elimination of pain and discomfort, and lower costs to produce oral formulations, but their clinical effect was unsatisfactory compared with that of injections, which becomes one of the most limited points in the development of Chinese medicine preparations. The presumptions that whether the low bioavailability of oral Flos Lonicerae extract resulted in the poor efficacy or whether efficacy could be improved as the absorption of active ingredients Table 1 The preliminary study on MS and MS/MS data of the identified components in rat plasma after oral administration of Flos Lonicerae extracts in negative mode. in Flos Lonicerae extract was enhanced are all yet to be investigated. As shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1 , we found that only phenolic acids and flavones, not saponins were found in the Flos Lonicerae extract. According to the HPLC figureprint profile shown in Fig. 1 (A) and UPLC-MS/MS shown in Fig. 1(B) , we found that the contents of phenolic acids in Flos Lonicerae extract such as neochlorogenic acid, chlorogenic acid, cryptochlorogenic acid, 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid or 3,4-dicaffeoylquinic acid were about 16.1, 16.9, 16.6, 18.9 and 37.8 mg/ml, respectively, higher largely than that of other ingredients, but their absolute bioavailability orally was significantly low (unpublished). Besides, the content of flavones such as galuteolin was 0.335 mg/ml, lower than that of phenolic acids such as isochlorogenic, and we also found that about 100% of the apically loaded hyperin, galuteolin, rutin were retained on the apical side from Caco-2 cell transport (unpublished). Conceptually, all compounds in the pharmaceutical product that are bioavailable in the systemic circulation can be considered as relevant active markers for pharmacological effects. Therefore, the properties above of main ingredients in Flos Lonicerae extract led us to postulate that low bioavailability of phenolic acids in Flos Lonicerae extract might result in low efficacy of clinical therapy.",

Recently, it was demonstrated that nitric oxide (NO) donors and polyamines were also effective for improving the intestinal absorption of poorly absorbable drugs the MeOH soluble portion of Flos Lonicerae extract was filtered through a 0.45 m membrane filter and the resulting filtrate was subjected for HPLC analysis. The analyses were performed using a Waters 2695 Alliance HPLC system (Waters Corp., Milford, MA, USA), consisting of a quaternary pump solvent management system, an on-line degasser, and an autosampler. The raw data were detected by 2998 PDA, acquired, and processed with Empower TM software.

The ability of chitosan to enhance gastrointestinal (GI) drug absorption has been of special interest (Gao et al. 2008 ). Illum et al. (1994) proposed that the mechanism of absorption enhancement was a combination of mucoadhesion and a loosening effect on the tension of the tight junctions through ionic interactions with negatively charged groups of glycocalix. However, the polymer was only soluble in an acidic environment in which the pH was less or if the order of the pK a value of chitosan (5.5-6.5), which restricted its application to the absorption enhancer seriously. For example, the reduction of TEER of Caco-2 cell monolayers was found after the apical incubation with chitosan hydrochloride and chitosan glutamate at a pH of 6.20, but no decrease of TEER, which is a good measurement of the tightness of the junctions between the cells, was observed at a pH of 7.40. At this pH, both chitosan salts (hydrochloride, glutamate) did not form clear solutions. In agreement with the results of the TEER experiments, no increase in the transport of the hydrophilic model compound [14C]-mannitol was found at a pH of 7.40 after incubation with these chitosan salts (Jonker et al. 2002) . Therefore, the potential use of chitosans, as absorption enhancer in the more basic environments of intestine, was limited.",

Chito-oligosaccharide (COS) shown in Fig. 3 , a new type of chitosan molecular, had remarkable solubility in water at physiological pH due to its low molecular weight, and we found that the contents of d-glucosamine, chitosan dimer, chitosan trimer, chitosan tetramer, chitosan pentamer and chitosan hexamer were 0. 42%, 9.19%, 18 .78%, 0.69%, 14.48% and 2.56% of totally, respectively. Gao et al. (2008) reported the effect of chitosan oligomers on the intestinal absorption of hydrophilic macromolecular drugs, such as fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled dextrans (FD4), and found that the bioavailability of FD4 could be all increased by about 2 times by chitosan dimer (0.5%, W/V), 1.5 times by chitosan trimer (0.5%, W/V) and 2.4 times by chitosan hexamer (0.5%, W/V) from jejunum. Besides, a moderate increase in the colonic absorption of FD4 was observed in the presence of chitosan pentamer (0.5%, W/V) and dimer (0.5%, W/V) from in situ loop method in rats.",

However, flavonoids glycosides in vivo can not be quantitative assessed well illustrated by Fig. 8 .

All evidence above supporting the hypothesis that phenolic acid can be considered as one of the important marker compounds to control the pharmacology of Flos Lonicerae extract. We also found that the absorption enhancing effect of COS for improving the intestinal absorption of phenolic acids was affected by their concentrations, a maximal absorption enhancing effect of COS was observed at a dosage of 25 mg/kg, not higher doses. Gao et al.

Therefore, our present result is consistent with the previous report and chitosan has some optimal concentrations to show the greatest absorption enhancing effects for improving the intestinal absorption of phenolic acids in Flos Lonicerae extract, although the type of chitosan was different.",
