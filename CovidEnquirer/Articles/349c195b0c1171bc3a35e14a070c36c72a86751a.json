Similar to traditional, seasonal strains of influenza, Swine Flu is very contagious, and can spread through coughing, sneezing, or touching (Center for Disease Control and Prevention, 2009) . Although the Swine Flu does not significantly differ in symptomology compared to the traditional, seasonal flu, it garnered much attention in the media and became a significant health concern for many during the 2009 Swine Flu pandemic.

            "text": "The 2009 Swine Flu pandemic provided researchers with an opportunity to examine relationships between pandemic fears and health anxiety. Other recent pandemics showed that anxiety was elevated among individuals living in urban areas associated with the outbreak. For example, during the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which had primary outbreaks in Hong Kong and Toronto, it was shown that there was high anxiety regarding the risk of illness in general population of Hong Kong (Cheng & Cheung, 2005 ) and for individuals who attending a conference in Toronto (Stinson, McCartney, Leung, & Katz, 2004) . The incidence of psychiatric disturbance following the SARS outbreak was limited primarily to those with prior psychiatric histories (Lancee, Maunder, & Goldbloom, 2008) . Collectively, these studies show that widely publicized pandemics are associated with increased anxiety and potentially exacerbations of psychiatric disturbance. In the case of psychiatric disturbance, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is an especially important condition that may be influenced by pandemic outbreaks. Those already suffering from symptoms of anxiety may be at greater risk of Swine Flu fears, and may also be more susceptible to taking excessive measures to reduce the likelihood of contracting Swine Flu. Additionally, given the common symptoms of contamination fears in individuals suffering from OCD (American Psychiatric Association, 2000; Ball, Baer, & Otto, 1996) , it is possible that individuals with obsessive-compulsive (OC) symptoms or OC beliefs are more likely to fear exposure to Swine Flu, along with taking excessive measures to prevent contracting this illness. Understanding these relationships could benefit clinicians in developing treatment plans for clients with significant pandemic fears, or anticipate the primary concerns of clients at risk for these fears when there are outbreaks presented in media reports of flu or other viral infections.",

This normal level of anxiety often causes us to take the necessary measures to prevent and alleviate illness. Health anxiety becomes problematic when the anxiety is chronic and excessive, or when the anxiety is significantly greater than the severity of the healthrelated threat (Taylor, McKay, & Abramowitz, 2012) . This kind of anxiety can be disabling, and is a common symptom in myriad psychological disorders, such as hypochondriasis, OCD, panic disorder, and specific phobias (Taylor et al., 2012) .",

Additionally, a common OC belief includes overestimation of threat. In contamination-based OCD, this overestimation of threat may include health anxiety-based symptoms such as obsessions with becoming ill or contaminating others (Cisler, Brady, Olatunji, & Lohr, 2010) . It is important to note that OC beliefs are not specific to OCD and are often experienced by individuals suffering from other anxiety disorders as well (Tolin, Worhunsky, & Maltby, 2006) . Finally, those who are more likely to experience disgust may also endorse a greater number of pandemic-related fears. Disgust sensitivity is seen in anxiety disorders such as OCD and certain phobias, and has been shown to play a critical role in those suffering from OCD, especially when symptoms are contamination-based (Thorpe, Patel, & Simonds, 2003) .",

            "text": "A telephone survey study in the UK examined how perceptions of Swine Flu affected behaviors taken to reduce Swine Flu (Rubin, Amlot, Page, & Wessely, 2009 ). Participants in this study were asked questions about specific behaviors they had engaged in over the previous few days relating to fear of Swine Flu. The researchers found that individuals with higher levels of anxiety about Swine Flu were significantly more likely to carry out avoidance behaviors recommended by the government than those who did not have high levels of anxiety (Rubin, Amlot, Page, & Wessely, 2009 ). Goodwin, Haque, Neto, and Myers (2009) conducted an internet and paper-based survey in Malaysia and Europe, which examined ''attitudinal and behavioral responses'' related to the Swine Flu pandemic. In terms of anxiety regarding Swine Flu infection, about half of the participants reported being at least ''somewhat concerned'' by catching Swine Flu, and this percentage was significantly higher in the Malaysian sample (71% indicated they were at least ''somewhat concerned'') (Goodwin et al., 2009) . Interestingly, the researchers found that while participants in the European sample were more likely to discuss their fears with their friends when compared to the Malaysian sample, Malaysian participants were more likely to contemplate behavioral changes (i.e., not using public transportation, and purchasing masks and other goods in preparation of an outbreak) (Goodwin et al., 2009) . These findings, plus the higher level of overall anxiety in the Malaysian population, shed light on some potential cultural differences when examining Swine Flu fears. This could be based on multiple factors, such as access to health care, access to information regarding Swine Flu, and cultural differences about emotional expression to friends and family.",

While this study did not directly examine the relationship between anxiety and Swine Flu, it did find that almost half of the participants felt they did not have enough information regarding the pandemic, and only 33% of the participants felt that being infected by Swine Flu would affect their lives ''very seriously'' (Seale et al., 2009) . Perhaps, there is a relationship between media exposure and perceived threat of Swine Flu, considering many participants in this study felt under-informed. While the effects of media exposure on Swine Flu anxiety are beyond the scope of this paper, it is an important point to consider in future studies of epidemic attitudes and behaviors. While the research above describes different factors that may affect attitudes toward Swine Flu, none of these studies have directly examined the effect of psychological symptoms on Swine Flu attitudes. A 2011 study examined the relationship between Swine Flu fears and various symptoms related to health anxiety, including contamination fears, panic symptoms, and disgust in an undergraduate sample (Wheaton, Abramowitz, Berman, Fabricant, & Olatunji, 2012) . Using regression analyses, Wheaton, Abramowitz, Berman, Fabricant, & Olatunji (2012) found that health-related anxiety, disgust sensitivity, and contamination fears all significantly predicted Swine Flu fears. This study was the first to demonstrate a relationship between various symptoms of anxiety and fears related to Swine Flu.",

Understanding these relationships would benefit clinicians treating individuals suffering from symptoms of health anxiety, as they may be able to determine who is at higher risk for fears surrounding future pandemics. Recent research from other pandemic outbreaks (i.e., SARS) shows that individuals exposed to information regarding these outbreaks experience higher anxiety (Cheng & Cheung, 2005) and, among at risk populations, there is a risk of exacerbation of preexisting psychiatric disturbance (Lancee et al., 2008) .

This is not consistent with the study's second hypothesis, which predicted that of anxiety would significantly mediate OC symptoms and beliefs and Swine Flu fears and behaviors. This finding indicates that internal monitoring of physical reactions may not be as closely related to pandemic fears in individuals containing OC beliefs as opposed to actual OC symptoms. However, our findings show that anxiety sensitivity plays an intermediary role between obsessive-compulsive beliefs and Swine Flu fears. This finding builds upon the prior research by Wheaton, Abramowitz, Berman, Fabricant, & Olatunji (2012) , which relied on a regression model to evaluate simultaneous effects in predicting Swine Flu fears. However, mediation models allow for causal sequencing of variables (MacKinnon, 2008) , Future research should evaluate multiple mediators (i.e., both anxiety and disgust sensitivity multiple mediator variables (MacKinnon, Fairchild, & Fritz, 2007) , which based on the parameter estimates obtained would have required approximately triple the sample size reported here . The results from the path models also indicate that the ASI-3 was a stronger mediator than the DS-R. The best fitting model included the ASI-3 mediating the relationship between the OCI-R and the Swine Flu Inventory. The path models indicate that individuals suffering from OC symptoms and beliefs are at higher risk for having anxiety centered around ongoing pandemics if they also experience anxiety sensitivity, which are closely related to panic symptoms. The results of this study support past research that indicates overlap between health anxiety and OCD (Fallon et al., 1991; Hollander, 1993; Deacon & Abramowitz, 2008) . Results from this study also support past survey data examining anxiety and Swine Flu, such as the research conducted by Rubin, Amlot, Page, & Wessely, 2009 . As discussed earlier, Rubin, Amlot, Page, & Wessely, 2009 also found that higher levels of anxiety significantly predicted avoidance and safety behavior related to Swine Flu.",

First, the time over which the data were collected may have impacted the results. Data were collected from November 2009 to March 2011. Over this time, two flu seasons occurred, when individuals are more likely to contract Swine Flu. The datacollecting period also included long stretches of time outside of flu season, when it is less likely for individuals to contract Swine Flu. Therefore, it is possible that more Swine Flu fears and behaviors were reported when the threat of the flu was more immediate. Researchers may examine future health threats and determine the historical effect of when the data were collected. In this case, future research may compare Swine Flu anxiety during flu season to Swine Flu anxiety out of flu season. However, given the results of this study that an increase in symptoms of anxiety appear to predict an increase in Swine Flu fears, it would still be expected that this would be the case outside of flu season. Further, during both flu seasons of data collection, there was regular reporting of Swine Flu in the media, including public health initiatives for receiving vaccines as well as reports on limitations in the efficacy of the vaccines.",

Future mediation analyses might investigate these relationships by examining different subtypes of panic disorder, which include respiratory, nocturnal, nonfearful, cognitive, and vestibular (Kirchanski, Phil, Craske, Epstein, & Wittchen, 2009 . Additionally, researchers may also consider examining environmental factors, such as media exposure to a pandemic, and their relationship to pandemic fears. Although cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an empiricallybased treatment for health anxiety (Barsky & Ahern, 2004; Taylor et al., 2012) . Wheaton, Abramowitz, Berman, Fabricant, & Olatunji (2012) note that exposure to media related to a pandemic may inhibit treatment effectiveness.
