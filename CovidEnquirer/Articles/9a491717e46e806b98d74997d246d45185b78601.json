National and municipal officials throughout the world monitored the trickle of SARS diagnoses in their jurisdictions and worried that they might be the next Toronto. 5 Assignments of blame for the SARS crisis quickly focused on legal and governmental failings in the contagion's place of origin. Critics faulted the PRC for its characteristic secrecy and denial; its weak legal and bureaucratic mechanisms for reporting, screening, quarantining, or otherwise stemming the disease's spread; and its creaky public health infrastructure. 6 Diagnoses of institutional ailments came with prescriptions for cure. The Asian financial crisis had brought IMF conditionality that demanded fiscal reforms, as well as calls for improved banking and bankruptcy law, greater transparency in government, and improved corporate governance. Now, SARS has brought calls for China to cooperate fully with international health authorities, remove political barriers to Taiwan's engagement with the WHO, and make the PRC's public health institutions more transparent and effective. 7",

            "text": "The international community's reactions to the Asian financial crisis and to SARS differed in one important respect. With SARS, external efforts to elicit cooperation in targeted countries had to operate without a powerful international institution. The WHO is no IMF. It does not have the Fund's demanding agenda for reform, high level of support from key states, or leverage as gatekeeper of resources. The WHO lacked the authority to require member countries to take steps to contain SARS. Member states' diseasereporting obligations extended only to a few listed illnesses. WHO provisions on international travel were inadequate, weakly balancing limits on states' latitude to impede commerce and mobility with their need for authority to take the drastic exclusionary measures that SARS seemed to require. 8 Initially unable to move Beijing to grant its teams access to affected areas, the WHO precious weeks in its mission to understand SARS' origin and spread. PRC opposition confined the WHO to dealing with Taipei indirectly, through the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, until Beijing finally acquiesced to the WHO's sending a mission to Taiwan. Amid what some saw as implausible reported patterns of infection in China, worries arose that the WHO was being fatally restricted by PRC authorities. 9 The WHO has, however, escaped the resentment, charges of disregarding national sovereignty, condemnation for pursuing an inappropriate agenda with little regard for its consequences, and accusations of serving as the agent of Western domination that dogged the post-Asian financial crisis IMF. WHO assistance has been welcome or at least tolerated in several SARS-affected places, and its advice continues to have widespread credibility. But the lack of ire at the WHO also reflects the organization's inability to impose its will on states. SARS focused attention on international public health threats that can be as dangerous as the illiberal trade policies and irresponsible monetary policies that the WTO and IMF police. It prompted modest steps to create a more institutionally robust international public health structure and accelerated a long-term project to strengthen the WHO. WHO has acquired new powers to report promptly on disease outbreaks based on unofficial information and is also gaining clearer authority to issue global health alerts (as it did for SARS) and send teams to assess member states' measures to contain international health threats. 10 Such changes do not, however, portend an international public health regime resembling the international trade and monetary regimes. As the IMF's and WTO's histories make clear, states do not easily achieve the levels of cooperation, willingly provide the resources, or lightly undertake the cessions of sovereignty necessary to create such strong institutions. Any international response to a recrudescence of SARS or new public health threats will have to rely, for the foreseeable future, on a weak WHO and ad hoc multilateral cooperation.",

With the disease's early emergence in Hong Kong and its subsequent spread in Taiwan, SARS' vectors for global propagation were especially dense in these two places. More than geographic proximity to China was at work. Indeed, one could say that the two areas suffered from ''Special Administrative Region syndrome,'' after the structure Beijing devised for Hong Kong and proposes for Taiwan. The channels for SARS' spread were created by the economic integration that underpins Beijing's agenda of transforming ''lost'' Chinese territories into PRC Special Administrative Regions (S.A.R.s). The PRC's pursuit of foreign investment beginning in the late 1970s had some of its greatest effects in the Pearl River region. Investment flowed across the border from Hong Kong, transforming the British colony into a front office for manufacturing operations inside China and a portal between China and the outside world. The PRC and Hong Kong have long been among each other's top trade and investment partners. 12 In the pre-reversion years, these economic ties and the PRC's resultant interest in preserving a thriving Hong Kong helped make conceivable to many in Hong Kong and their British guardians the territory's return to Chinese rule.",

The PRC-Hong Kong border is among the world's busiest controlled frontiers, with PRC residents crossing into Hong Kong as tourists, business people, or laborers and Hong Kongers heading to Guangdong for recreation, to visit relatives, to oversee investments, or to work in office jobs. Affluent Hong Kongers often have second homes on the PRC side of the border. Some Hong Kongers commute from primary residences in Guangdong. 14 Hundreds of thousands of Taiwanese now live relatively permanently in the PRC, primarily company owners, employees, and their dependents. Many return regularly to Taiwan for business or social purposes. Huge numbers of Taiwanese travel to the mainland as tourists, businesspeople or visitors to their families' old home villages. Because bans on direct air links between Taiwan and the mainland persist, almost all of the cross-Strait human traffic flows through Hong Kong. 15 With this volume of travel, it is hardly surprising that SARS spread from southeastern China to Hong Kong and Taiwan. It quickly reached Hong Kong (apparently by means of a PRC-based ''superspreader'' who infected fellow guests at Kowloon's Metropole Hotel) via one of countless available routes. The greater puzzle is why SARS took so long, relatively speaking, to strike Taiwan.",

            "text": "Special Administrative Region syndrome also has a political dimension which caused differing but similar symptoms in each of Taiwan and Hong Kong. To some in Hong Kong, SARS was potentially the most serious episode of inept governance by the Beijing-imposed S.A.R. leadership, following on the botched crisis-management efforts of the 1997 bird flu and the Asian financial crisis. The Tung Chee-hwa administration was derided for its belated and ineffective response to SARS. Embarrassingly, the territory's most serious outbreak swept through two buildings in the Amoy Gardens, a block of middle-class housing, just after the government stated that SARS was being contained. The incident intensified calls for the government to make more aggressive use of Hong Kong's quarantine law and police powers. 16 As public confidence in Tung's administration sank, calls for his resignation rose and an opposition members' motion calling on Tung to step down came to a vote in the legislature. Some saw SARS as evidence of the deadly consequences of the Hong Kong leadership's subservient posture toward Beijing. 17 To its harshest critics, the Tung government showed its true colors in failing to elicit prompt cooperation from PRC authorities. Once the SARS crisis accelerated in Hong Kong, sanguine comments from officials sounded disturbingly similar to those of former PRC trade minister Long Yongtu, who notoriously opined in late March that 300 cases were not particularly noteworthy in a place with 6 million people. 18 It was too little too late when the Hong Kong government declared in mid-April that Chinese president Hu Jintao's talks with Tung during Hu's tour to Shenzhen had included his pledge to provide Hong Kong with ''the full support of the central government. '' 19 In Taiwan, conflict over the PRC's S.A.R. agenda drove the politics of SARS. As SARS invaded Taiwan, Beijing continued to oppose Taiwan's quest for participation in the WHO, even as an ''observer'' (rather than member) and a ''health entity'' (rather than a state). 20 This reflected the PRC's long-standing opposition to Taiwan's participation in any states-member-only organization, which could enhance international recognition of Taiwan's state-like status and thus Taiwan's ability to resist the PRC's calls to reunify on S.A.R. terms.",

Some of the initial infections of Taiwanese might have occurred as travelers passed through Hong Kong between the mainland and Taiwan along a circuitous route mandated by a policy rooted in Taiwan's worries that more direct links would deepen integration and strengthen Beijing's ability to press for reunification.

            "text": "The SARS story in Hong Kong and Taiwan provides a dramatic example of one side of contemporary China's two-sided reality: China has become ''glocalized.'' SARS spread from Guangdong to Hong Kong and on to Taipei, Hanoi, Singapore, Toronto, and other urban centers in more than two dozen countries, while few cases seemed to arise in rural China outside the disease's original epicenter. This pattern illustrates that globalization for the PRC has meant that its coastal cities and their environs are in some respects more closely linked to metropolises in East Asia and the advanced industrial economies than they are to the Chinese hinterland. On one account, SARS reached Beijing from southeastern China via a passenger on a flight from Hong Kong. The cases in North America, Europe, and Southeast Asia appear traceable to business travelers arriving from China. 24 Yet, as the pattern of SARS in China also shows, rapidly developing areas of China's east and southeast are by no means insulated-in politics, economics or public health-from the PRC's troubled rural and inland areas. SARS appears to have traveled to PRC cities and the wider world from origins in areas of the Chinese countryside where the factories that have built the PRC's economic boom stand amid densely populated agrarian areas with bad sanitation, near-tropical climates, myriad farm animals, and hunting and ranching sectors that supply exotic beasts to poorly-regulated urban markets. 25 This slice of rural China provides a fertile environment for the transmission of diseases from animals to humans. This occurred even in the absence of the dense connections that a quarter-century of outward-oriented economic development has forged between such areas and urban centers in 24 deLISLE China and beyond. The point was not lost on Beijing officials, who moved in May to monitor more carefully and quarantine new arrivals and returnees from the countryside and to ban eating of wild animals. 26 The dense links between urban and rural China and the poor hygiene and crowded conditions of China's cities also raised the prospect of a reverse spread of SARS to lesser cities and villages. More than 100 million PRC citizens, almost all recent migrants from the countryside, live without official permission in Chinese cities. Sometimes by choice and sometimes upon forcible ''repatriation'' by city authorities, a fraction of this ''floating population'' returns to its home areas. Because economic opportunity and high-status employment are concentrated in the PRC's metropolises, many legal residents of China's largest cities come from elsewhere and often travel to their old abodes throughout the country, often on cramped trains.",

WHO teams were belatedly granted access to Beijing, SARS-epicenter Guangdong, and elsewhere. The WHO welcomed China's increased cooperation, and many of the remaining complaints assert incompetence rather than recalcitrance. 28 After months of denial, PRC government officials and newspapers finally declared SARS to be a serious problem and conceded their lack of effectiveness in dealing with it. The newly installed acting mayor of Beijing, Wang Qishan, told a television audience, ''SARS is an epidemic that has hit us head-on.'' 29 Premier Wen Jiabao was quoted in the official media describing SARS as a grave threat. The director of China's CDC said abjectly (in comments that were not much reported domestically) that ''we . . . apologize to everyone.'' 30 Even today, these are not small matters in the PRC. Despite China's rapidly expanding engagement with the outside world, the legacy of humiliation by foreign powers in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and the growing dependence of the reform-era regime on nationalism as a basis for legitimacy have hardened a strong, even paranoid, commitment to sovereignty and opacity.

            "text": "Having admitted a SARS problem in Beijing and Guangdong, a SARS threat nationally, and a mishandling of the initial phases of the crisis, on April 20 the leadership sacked the Minister of Health and the mayor of Beijing. While this much would have been standard procedure in an earlier era, what followed arguably was not. China's rulers placed the ousted officials' authority and additional powers to address SARS in the hands of those whose distinctive qualifications were demonstrated competence in coping with crises and strong international reputations. Vice Premier Wu Yi, the Tiananmen incident-era Beijing vice mayor, former foreign trade minister, and WTO accession negotiator, was appointed to serve as minister of health and head of a special SARS task force. Veteran provincial trouble-shooter Wang Qishan was brought in as Beijing's acting mayor. Both were highly regarded as members of the group of skilled, tough, and smart officials associated with recently retired Premier Zhu Rongji-a group that had fared badly in the recent round of appointments to top leadership posts. 31 28 These moves were presented as part of a broader shift to openness and accountability. The principal Party organ, People's Daily, conceded that China's disease prevention system had been inadequate and ill-prepared. Other prominent media and commentators criticized as ''habitual'' behavior the government's hiding and impeding reports of the SARS problem and noted how the outbreak highlighted the dangerous imbalances created by years of emphasizing economic development over social development. 32 Before SARS, official media expos\u00e9s of failures in the system, along with repudiations of the policies of those who have fallen from power, were commonplace. The SARS coverage went further in suggesting shortcomings of the system. A significant trigger for these regime responses was a whistleblower who has gone unpunished. When Beijing officially maintained that there were only a dozen SARS cases and three fatalities in Beijing, Jiang Yanyong, a retired Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) physician, told foreign news media that there were sixty infections and seventeen deaths at one Beijing military hospital. Six weeks later, PRC media acknowledged the doctor's role in prompting a change in the government's line. Calls within the Party to sanction him encountered sharp resistance. 33 Recently installed President Hu Jintao and Premier Wen Jiabao took visible and politically risky public roles in supporting the new openness, raising hopes that the approach might endure beyond SARS. Wen dined with students at SARS-affected universities, visited hospitals, and toured construction sites, shopping malls, and residential neighborhoods. Hu inspected the SARS-affected cities of Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen. 34 Both staked their reputations on their success in beating SARS.",

A week and a half into February, authorities in Guangzhou were still trying to restrict information about the outbreak and to declare SARS under control. Well into March, Beijing officials were pursuing the same strategy. 35 The traditional ban on bad news during key Party or state meetings quashed the possibility of addressing the matter publicly until after the conclusion of the March meeting of the National People's Congress in Beijing.",

People's Daily affirmed that, under the ''staunch leadership'' of the Party Central Committee and ''Comrade Hu Jintao, the whole nation, united as one man . . . has struck up a heroic song featuring the Chinese people's strong will.'' 39 The media informed the people that the ''strong and correct'' Party leadership was the key to success. President Hu called for a ''people's war''-a classic Mao-era phrase-against SARS. 40 Draconian legal and policy measures suggested a throwback to an earlier era. In mid-May the Health Ministry issued a sweeping set of ''Management Measures'' imposing strict rules for reporting, quarantine, isolation, and other matters, and the Supreme People's Court and Procuracy announced severe penalties for violating SARS-related regulations. Anyone who knowingly spread the pathogen could face capital punishment. Those who broke quarantine or evaded a mandated medical exam or treatment and accidentally passed on the illness faced up to seven years in jail. Lesser infractions too could lead to prolonged incarceration. 41 Criminal charges were soon made against a Beijing-based doctor for knowingly infecting residents of his home village, and over one hundred people were detained for spreading SARS rumors.",

Nanjing, for example, offered cash rewards for turning in people suspected of having returned from SARS-affected areas. 44 While some of these moves parallel those adopted in heavily SARS-hit areas beyond mainland China, the PRC's measures caused unique alarm because they were coupled with more obviously harsh measures and unfolded against the background of the PRC's history of severe and arbitrary uses of governmental power.

It was equally unlikely that China would be able to ignore pressure to address the problem in ways that the international community demanded. In an era of extensive foreign trade and investment dependence, the economic and diplomatic costs to China of non-cooperation were too high to bear. SARS, however, provided an unusual occasion on which foreign pressure was exceptionally likely to be effective. Other states had an indisputably legitimate stake in how China handled the crisis, for their own economies and public health appeared to be at risk. Clearly as a matter of causation and (given Beijing's early stonewalling) probably as a matter of culpability, China was responsible for the problem that the world was calling on it to help fix. Moreover, what outsiders demanded was less offensive to the regime's notion of sovereignty than were many other international calls on China for reform, such as those addressing China's lack of democracy, weak legal system, human rights abuses, or the vestigial non-market features in its economy.",

SARS created opportunities for Hu and Wen to wield decisively the power they formally held and move beyond Jiang's shadow in a Politburo that was packed with Jiang's prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. It helped that Jiang was rumored to be hiding out in the safety of Shanghai and that his Politburo acolytes remained silent while Hu and Wen manned the frontlines and saturated the airwaves.

Modest rhetoric about attending to reform's left-behinds has yet to generate a significant shift of ideological emphasis, much less action. Despite the flirtation with ''going west,'' Jiang ultimately remained closely associated with the ''coastal strategy'' of the Deng Xiaoping years and solidified that commitment with his doctrine of the ''three represents,'' by which the Party opened its doors to China's urban and littoral entrepreneurs. Hu's nominal succession has brought no backpedaling on this element of Jiang theory. 47 Does the SARS episode, then, reveal anything important about China's internal order and its engagement with the outside world? SARS has been characterized as China's potential Chernobyl or 9/11. 48 It is likely neither. The response to SARS may have been belated, bungling, indicative of systemic shortcomings, and/or corrosive of the system's depleted legitimacy. But SARS so far has not exposed a regime so inept, indifferent, or dangerous to its people and the world that it must consider glasnost-like reforms that might spell the demise of the existing order.

If SARS returns, or when the next crisis strikes China, the same paradoxical tendencies toward liberalization and authoritarian institutionstrengthening, openness and opacity, cooperation and obstreperousness, can be expected to recur. SARS has underscored the importance of learning how to navigate the resulting turbulence in and around China, where seemingly irresistible forces of globalization and reform press against intractable obstacles rooted in China's hypertrophic notion of sovereignty, residually Leninist institutions, destabilizing social cleavages, and weakly institutionalized politics. deLISLE",
