With a view to establishing effective management strategies, the origins of these illnesses and the diagnostic techniques that have been developed to discover them are reviewed. Therapeutic regimens with documented efficacy are outlined with emphasis on specific rather than empiric treatment. Although many respiratory tract pathogens remain exquisitely sensitive to penicillin, the emergence of resistant strains underscores the need for safe and effective alternative therapies. R espiratory tract infections include both the most common and the most life-threatening illnesses plaguing humankind. The ordinary \"sore throat\"pharyngitis-accounts for approximately 40 million visits to physicians per year in the United States, as well as significant time lost from work. Although often considered more of a nuisance than a disease, unrecognized and/or untreated pharyngitis can lead to serious suppurative and nonsuppurative complications.",

In as many as 40 percent of cases, attempts to identify any specific agent-viral or bacterial-will be unsuccessful. From a therapeutic standpoint, the most important pathogen in pharyngitis is group A Streptococcus, which accounts for 10 percent to 30 percent of cases. Less common causes of pharyngitis, which may require specific isolation procedures or serologic assay, include Neisseria gonowhoeae (isolation requires Thayer-Martin medium), Corynebacterium hemolyticum (sore throat and skin rash), group C Streptococcus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Epstein-Barr virus (infectious mononucleosis). Diagnosis and treatment of streptococcal pharyngitis are clearly indicated, for a number of reasons. Several prospective, placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated that treatment decreases duration of fever and other symptoms of sore throat due to streptococcal infection [l-4] . Treatment of streptococcal sore throat also contributes to controlling and reducing the spread of such infections within families and classrooms. Clinically, prompt and appropriate treatment prevents suppurative complications-not only can bacteria spread from the pharynx to the tonsils but also to the retro-and lateral pharyngeal spaces. Even meningitis was a not-uncommon consequence of streptococcal pharyngitis before the availability of antibiotic drugs. Finally, perhaps the best recognized reason to treat group A streptococcal infections is to prevent the development of acute rheumatic fever, which appears, after years of declining incidence, to be on the rise again in the United States.",

Cultures of two sequential specimens, for example, taken from the same patient will show identical results only about 90 percent of the time [5] . Moreover, a study conducted by Saslow and colleagues [6] showed that 24 percent of throat culture specimens failed to reveal streptococcal infection that was later identified when the patients' tonsils were removed and examined. One of the most frustrating drawbacks of the culture method of diagnosis is the 24-to 36-hour delay before results are available. Delay also may compromise treatment efficacy; in one study, immediate institution of antibiotic drugs was associated with less incidence of morbidity than when treatment was delayed until culture results became available 131.",

Although penicillin remains a mainstay of therapy for many patients with bacterial pneumonia, the emergence of resistance should provide the impetus for discovery and testing of alternative therapies.",
