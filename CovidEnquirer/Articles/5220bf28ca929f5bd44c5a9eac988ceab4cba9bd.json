CONCLUSIONS: Ethical and effi cient critical care triage is a complex process that requires signifi cant planning and preparation. At present, the prognostic tools required to produce an eff ective decision support system (triage protocol) as well as the infrastructure, processes, legal protections, and training are largely lacking in most jurisdictions. Th erefore, critical care triage should be a last resort aft er mass critical care surge strategies.

Failure to do so may lead to situations that are ethically compromising and undermine public trust, such as when access to critical care resources is denied based on crisis standards by one institution without referral to a nearby institution capable of providing critical care. Regions should institute an Incident Management System (IMS) at the facility, local, regional or state, and national level to exercise command and control over scarce resources. 16 Furthermore, decision-makers should communicate with community emergency services and local hospitals to ensure a coordinated approach to patient transfers, standards of care, and resource allocation. 16 , 17 2. We suggest critical care only be rationed when resources have, or will shortly be, overwhelmed despite all eff orts at augmentation and a regional-level authority that holds the legal authority and adequate situational awareness has declared an emergency and activated its mass critical care plan. A basic tenet of ethically conducted triage is that the degree of rationing through triage is proportionate to the anticipated or realized shortfall in resources. 18 Th erefore, the rationing of critical care should be held as a last resort and only implemented when all eff orts have been made to optimize the use of resources. Th e task force considers all eff orts at augmentation to include all attempts to acquire scarce critical resources or to transfer patients to other health-care facilities that are able to provide care (state, national, and even international partner institutions). 19 In rapidly evolving disasters, critical care may need to be rationed before the appropriate authority has declared an emergency or activated its mass critical care plan, but this should only be done in exceptional circumstances. Similarly, in some jurisdictions, the relevant authority will be responsible for declaring an emergency and activating a mass critical care plan but may not have statutory powers. Nevertheless, a decision to ration critical care should not be made unilaterally at an institutional level because individual institutions do not possess the situational awareness in isolation to operationally or ethically justify such a decision. Similarly, the decision to cease triage should occur in a graduated and coordinated manner by altering the prioritization criteria and exclusion thresholds as resources become available. 19 3. We suggest health-care systems provide oversight for any triage decisions made under their authority via activation of a mass critical care plan to ensure they comply with the prescribed process and include appropriate documentation.",

Th e use of senior physicians and surgeons as triage offi cers is based on their training and decision-making capacity, which makes them ideal candidates. 40 -45 Specifi cally for trauma, burns, and critically ill or injured patients, senior trauma surgeons, burn surgeons, and intensivists are best qualifi ed to fulfi ll the role in each of the respective situations. Ideally, to enable timely decisions and avoid duty-to-care confl icts, triage offi cers should not be involved in triage and direct care of patients requiring triage simultaneously. 42 , 43 , 46 Th e decision to have a single triage offi cer vs a triage team depends on the context of the situation and the philosophic approach adopted. Using a sole triage offi cer model allows for effi ciency of decision-making, minimizes the impact on staff resources, and avoids confl icting opinions. However, a sole offi cer carries a signifi cant intellectual and emotional burden. Furthermore, in situations with diverse groups of patients requiring critical care (eg, during a pandemic as opposed to a sudden static event), it is less likely that a very-welldefi ned set of criteria will exist to guide triage offi cers, and predicting patient outcomes will be more challenging. Th erefore, in such settings, using a triage team comprising a senior intensivist and another senior physician from an acute care background may have advantages. Th is model ensures that at least two perspectives are provided on each case. Given the aim is to maximize the incremental benefi t of critical care, the combination of an intensivist and a nonintensivist physician may be advantageous as one estimates the probability of good outcome with intensive care and the other without intensive care. Furthermore, a team approach may mitigate some of the emotional burden associated with sole decision-making. A team model, however, increases physician resources and requires processes to deal with disagreements within the team. Hospitals that choose to have a triage team must ensure that this approach does not compromise the ability to make eff ective and effi cient decisions. Finally, it will likely be necessary for support staff (clinical and clerical) to be provided for the triage offi cers and teams.",

We believe that for a prognostic score to be useful, it must reliably predict mortality, with an initial cutoff of . 90% mortality being reasonable to consider excluding a patient from admission to the ICU during a mass casualty event. Currently, there are no scores that meet these criteria. Previously, an admission Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score of . 11 had been recommended as an exclusion criterion predicting signifi cant mortality. 7 , 54 , 55 , 61 , 62 However, some studies showed confl icting evidence regarding mortality rates associated with this threshold. 60 , 63 , 64 Th erefore, predictive ability of the SOFA score varies across populations and, hence, a specifi c SOFA score threshold cannot be recommended for use in all adult populations.

In altering standards from conventional to contingency and, subsequently, to crisis care, decisions will already have been made to limit the use of therapies that require extraordinarily expensive equipment or consume extensive staff or hospital resources. Examples of such therapies include advanced ventilatory support and rescue therapies, such as inhaled nitric oxide, high-frequency ventilation, prone positioning ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. 65 Areas for Future Research During a disaster, there is an obligation to provide clinical care as well as research to guide eff ective and effi cient care. Studies and trial designs should be preplanned and modifi ed quickly when specifi c events occur. During the 2009 infl uenza A(H1N1) pandemic, observational study case report forms, registry, clinical trial design, and cooperation of international critical care research organizations occurred. 66 Rigorous, relevant, timely, and ethical clinical and health services research is sorely lacking but crucial to improve care and outcomes of patients during disasters. Recommendations Table 2 legend for expansion of other abbreviation. have been made to clinical investigators and research ethics committees for critical care research during a disaster that proposed strategies for expedited and centralized research ethics committee reviews and alternate consent models. 67 The literature search presented in this article reveals an almost complete absence of data on which to base recommendations. Conducting research on triage during a static event is likely to be challenging. However, even simple observational data on the feasibility of the suggestions given in this article would be useful. More comprehensive research is more feasible during a dynamic event, such as an epidemic. Preliminary research on outcomes, including patients admitted and not admitted to the ICU in the interepidemic period, will facilitate predictions of benefit for those with nonepidemic diseases and provide clues about the data to collect during the epidemic . This may allow for the rapid development of appropriate CDSSs early in the epidemic.",

Tertiary triage (3\u00b0) involves decisions regarding the priority for defi nitive care of patients in the ICU or operating room . Th e degree to which the decisions at each stage involve resource allocation (rationing) in addition to prioritization depends on the degree of imbalance between the demand for and supply of resources. As one progresses from primary through secondary and tertiary triage, the information and data available on which to base the triage decisions increase but so too does the complexity of the decisions.
