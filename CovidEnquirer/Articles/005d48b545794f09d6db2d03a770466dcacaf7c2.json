The target enzyme of C-Cyd is supposed to be CP synthetase that converts UTP to CTP. In keeping with this assumption are the observations that (i) C-Cyd effects a dose-dependent inhibition of RNA synthesis in both virus-infected and uninfected cells, and (ii) exogenous addition of either Urd cr Cyd reverses both the antiviral and cytocidal activity of C-Cyd, whereas addition of dThd or dCyd fails to do so. The selectivity of C-Cyd against Sindbis, vesicular stomatitis and reo virus is markedly increased when C-Cyd is combined with Cyd (10 pg/mL). This combination may therefore be worth pursuing as a chemotherapeutic modality for the treatment of virus infections.",

These carbocyclic analogues are resistant to phosphorolysis by nucleoside phosphorylases which cleave the N-glycosidic linkage of regular nucleosides and thereby abrogate their antiviral or antitumor activity. Various carbocyclic derivatives of pyrimidine nucleosides have been synthesized [l-lo] . When derived from 5substituted 2'-deoxyuridines with anti-herpes virus activity, the carbocyclic compounds, akin to their parent compounds, appeared to specifically block herpes simplex virus (HSV) replication [4, 6, 7, 91 . The carbocyclic analogues of (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (BVDU) and (E)-5-(2-iodovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (IVDU) were shown to react equally well with the viral 2'-deoxythymidine kinase (TK) as their parent compounds [ll] and, following phosphorylation by the virus-infected cells to their triphosphate forms, both IVDU and its carbocyclic counterpart may be incorporated into DNA of these cells [12] .",

Also consistent with the inhibition of CTP synthesis is the inhibitory effect of C-Cyd on DNA synthesis (Table 3) , because inhibition of CTP synthesis also leads to a reduction in the supply of the pyrimidine deoxynucleoside 5'-triphosphates (dCTP, dTTP) as outlined in Fig. 4. From Fig. 4 it is also clear that if the mode of action of C-Cyd is based upon inhibition of the UTP+ CTP step, additional supply of UTP and CTP through the Urd and Cyd salvage pathways may be expected to overcome the inhibitory effects of C-Cyd. This premise was borne out, as both the antiviral activity (Table  4 ) and cytocidal activity ( selective as an antiviral agent. However, the antiviral selectivity of C-Cyd can be markedly increased when combined with Cyd: addition of Cyd (at 10 pg/mL) reverses the cytocidal activity of C-Cyd to a significantly greater extent (Table 4 ) than its antiviral activity (Table 5) , thus resulting in a marked increase in the antiviral selectivity index of C-Cyd (Table 6) .
