The nurses persevered; the majority reported that they learned CTAS well and that their triaging skills were more accurate and consistent. One nurse commented, ''It's made me change my whole approach. I think I'm more efficient and thorough with my assessments.'' Another remarked, ''Last night someone had something in his eye, a couple of babies came in, and a respiratory problem came in. They all arrived at the same time. Having a rationale now for prioritizing the patient makes things easier.'' When in doubt about a patient's status, they were ''triaging up,'' that is, erring on the side of patient safety. Nurses reported that the online discussion area provided them with an opportunity to really explore the rationale for assigning patients to a particular triage level. The forum also gave nurses the opportunity to hear about other nurses' experiences and to network, sometimes with nurses working in hospitals more than 3000 miles away.",
