We used a complex consisting of the epitope peptide of the MERS-CoV S protein and CpG-DNA encapsulated in liposome complex to immunize mice, and produced the monoclonal antibodies 506-2G10G5 and 492-1G10E4E2. The western blotting data showed that both monoclonal antibodies detected the S protein and immunoprecipitated the native form of the S protein. Indirect immunofluorescence and confocal analysis suggested strong reactivity of the antibodies towards the S protein of MERS-CoV virus infected Vero cells. Furthermore, the 506-2G10G5 monoclonal antibody significantly reduced plaque formation in MERS-CoV infected Vero cells compared to normal mouse IgG and 492-1G10E4E2. Thus, we successfully produced a monoclonal antibody directed against the RBD domain of the S protein which could be used in the development of diagnostics and therapeutic applications in the future.

MERS-CoV, a lineage C betacoronavirus, first appeared in Saudi Arabia in June 2012 (3) (4) (5) . Since then, the cases of MERS-CoV human infection have been reported to the World Health Organization (WHO) from 27 countries, mostly from Middle East countries (6) . Globally, as of May 2018, MERS-CoV has caused a total of 2,220 cases of infections with at least 790 individual deaths (mortality rate: 35.6%), with majority being reported from Saudi Arabia (1844 cases with 716 deaths) (6) . Another major outbreak outside of the Middle East took place in South Korea in 2015 resulting in 186 cases with 36 fatalities (7, 8) . An elevation in the pathogenicity of MERS-CoV and absence of effective vaccines or therapeutics against the virus could be a risky combination inviting a pandemic in the future. Therefore, ideal and effective therapeutic measures for the prevention and treatment of MERS are urgently required.",

The MERS-CoV genome consists of structural proteins such as the spike (S), membrane (M), envelope (E) and nucleocapsid (N) (2, 11) . The S glycoprotein of MERS-CoV portrays a crucial role in viral attachment and subsequent entrance into host cell (12, 13) . The S glycoprotein is comprised of two subunits: receptor recognizing S1 and membrane fusion S2 (12, 13) . The S1 subunit of MERS-CoV contains the receptor binding domain (RBD) which is responsible for interacting with the cellular receptor dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; also called CD26) in the host cell membrane (13, 14) . The heptad repeat (HR) 1 and 2 regions of the S2 subunit mediate fusion between the viral and host cell membranes (12) . Due to the vital antigenic property, the S protein has been focus of the development of therapeutic strategies against MERS (2, 11) . Importantly, antibody production against the RBD has been a functional determinant factor for promising diagnostic and therapeutic targeting (2) .",

Hence, candidate B cell epitopes from the amino acid sequence of the MERS-CoV S protein were predicted using the Immune Epitope Database and Analysis Resources (IEDB) tool based on the epitope prediction, surface accessibility and antigenicity scale (http://tools.iedb.org/bcell). Because the RBD domain within the S protein is responsible for binding to the host cell (2, 18) , the Spike-492 and Spike-492 (L506F) peptide sequences corresponding to the 492th-516th amino acid residues within the RBD domain of MERS-CoV S protein were selected and synthesized ( Fig. 1A and B) . To determine the efficiency of the peptides as a B cell epitope, each peptide and the Lipoplex (O) complex were formulated and then immunized into the BALB/c mice. To screen the antibody titers, ELISA was performed using the sera of the immunized mice. Both of the peptides induced a robust production of peptide-specific IgGs (Fig. 1C) . Thus, the immunogenic epitope peptides were successfully designed and produced. http://bmbreports.org BMB Reports ",

The western blotting results (Fig. 2D, Fig. S1D and Fig.  S2A ) show that both monoclonal antibodies detected a protein band corresponding to the S protein in the molecular weight range in the MERS-CoV-infected Vero cells, however, no band was observed in the non-infected Vero cells. Treatment with peptide-N-glycosidase (PNGase F) resulted in the reduction of the apparent molecular weight of the S protein band compared with the untreated sample ( Fig. 2D and Fig. S1D ) suggesting that both monoclonal antibodies could recognize the S protein in its glycosylated and de-glycosylated form. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation was done to evaluate if the monoclonal antibodies could recognize the S protein in its native form. Both monoclonal antibodies immunoprecipitated the native form of the S protein from MERS-CoV-infected Vero cells lysates (Fig. S1E and Fig. S2B ). In addition, both monoclonal antibodies recognized the de-glycosylated protein band in the PNGase F treated immunoprecipitated lysate ( Fig. 2E and Fig.  S1E ). To further determine the cross-reactivity of the 506-2G10G5 and 492-1G10E4E2 monoclonal antibodies with each corresponding epitope, ELISA was performed. The 506-2G10G5 monoclonal antibody showed remarkable cross-reactivity to Spike-492 peptides which was higher than the result shown by the 492-1G10E4E2 monoclonal antibody to Spike-492 (L506F) (Fig. 2G and H) . Therefore, both of the antibodies exhibited specific binding to the MERS-CoV S protein.",

To identify the isotype of the monoclonal antibody, the HRPconjugated anti-mouse IgG (each isotype) antibody (Southern Biotechnology Associates Inc.) was used. For detection of cross-reactivity, 96-well immunoplates were coated with the MERS-CoV Spike-492 or Spike-492 (L506F) peptides and incubated with either 492-1G10E4E2 or 506-2G10G5 monoclonal antibody for 2 h before incubation with the secondary antibody. The absorbance was evaluated with the Spectra Max 250 microplate reader (Molecular Devices Co.) at 450 nm and then calculated with the SigmaPlot program to determine the affinity constant (EC50 value) as described previously (17) .",

To obtain the monoclonal antibody on a large scale, ascitic fluid was collected from the mice injected with the 506-2G10G5 clone (Fig. 2A)or 492-1G10E4E2 clone(Fig. S1A), and the antibodies were purified. Next, the isotypes of the 506-2G10G5 and 492-1G10E4E2 monoclonal antibodies were determined by ELISA and found to be IgG1 and IgG2a, respectively (Fig. 2B and Fig. S1B). The binding affinities of the monoclonal antibodies targeting the Spike-492 (L506F) peptide and Spike-492 was assessed by ELISA, and the EC50 values of the monoclonal antibodies 506-2G10G5 and 492-1G10E4E2 were determined to be 178 pM and 3.3 nM, respectively (Fig. 2C and Fig. S1C).",
