The incidence of tuberculosis (TB), once on the downward slope, has been on the increase. In the early 1990s, plague reemerged in India, killing 54 persons, a number quite small in comparison with the thousands who die daily from malaria and TB but sufficient to alarm the medical community. 1 Subsequently, in 1999, West Nile encephalitis emerged in New York, sparking a new emergency. Other diseases thought to be under control or even eliminated are reemerging; certain diseases previously considered to be strictly zoonotic are appearing in people in different parts of the world; diseases that are new or that once were unrecognized, such as severe respiratory syndrome (SARS), have appeared with alarming ferocity; and many antibiotics are losing their effectiveness as a result of resistance that has been acquired by different organisms. This emergence of new and reemergence of old infectious diseases have become a major global problem. [2] [3] [4] Although the numerous concerns that these and other factors present are far beyond the scope of this publication, the next several issues of Seminars will present a series of special articles devoted to this subject, beginning in this issue with a review of the threat to human and social security and various factors that contribute to the situation. One particularly recent threat, West Nile virus (WNV), will be considered in this issue",

Subsequent to the outbreak of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the Institute of Medicine (IOM) noted the existence of associations among various emerging diseases, emphasizing that microbial threats endanger public health across the globe and demand the urgent need for better strategies and tools to tackle infectious diseases. The IOM outlined several factors contributing to microbial spread, which officials at IOM, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization, and other health agencies are attempting to halt by limiting antimicrobial use, by pouring money into global health funds, by establishing international surveillance networks and, in severe instances, by limiting travel. 10",

            "text": "The emergence of these diseases and the resistance that is developing against various antibiotics have numerous psychological, sociological, and political implications. These three aspects are the underlying subject of an analysis provided by Brower and Chalk. Using the psychological theories of Blatz, 11 these authors delineate the effects of transnational spread of emerging infectious diseases as they threaten human security, defined as \"the quality of life of the people of a society or polity. Anything which degrades their quality of life-demographic pressures, diminished access to or stock of resources, and so on-is a security threat.\" 12 Human security is seen to differ in three ways from the traditional concept of security: (1) the individual rather than the state is the main agent of analysis; (2) the emphasis is on unstructured chaos and turmoil as the chief challenge to global stability rather than on structured, militarized interstate violence; and (3) the potential for individual/communitarian cooperation is based on cooperation that achieves the good of all rather than on interactions in which one party \"wins\" at the expense of the other(s). 13 The threat to this concept of human security is depicted by Browers and Chalk in six specific aspects, as reviewed below. 13 First, of course, is the toll on human life and the accompanying societal implications. Disease kills-and in doing so, it poses an even greater threat than that caused by war: acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) alone is expected to account for the deaths of more than 80 million people by the year 2011, TB accounts for 3 million deaths (including 1 million children) annually, and \"a staggering 1500 people die each hour from infectious ailments, the vast bulk of which are caused by just six groups of disease: human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/AIDS, malaria, measles, pneumonia, TB, and dysentery and other gastrointestinal disorders.\" 14 Second, unchecked disease can undermine public confi-dence in the custodial function of the state, perhaps even undermining the ability of the state to function and placing acute pressure on first responders and medical personnel that increases the responsibility of an already-stressed government to respond adequately. Two examples of this concern can be provided. The threat of the anthrax attacks in the United States in the fall of 2001 was accompanied by a lack of coordination at the federal level, which led to a loss of confidence among some citizens, particularly postal workers. Additionally, other responses were misguided (eg, the purchase by the general public of Cipro\u00ae [Bayer, West Haven, CT] the antibiotic approved for treating anthrax, in large numbers). Another example was provided by the severe food poisoning epidemic caused by Escherichia coli 0157 that occurred in Japan in 1996, when the perceived inability of the Tokyo government to initiate an appropriate response led to widespread public criticism of an administration that already was reeling from the effects of the previous year's Kobe earthquake.",

            "text": "A third concern with regard to public security is the adverse economic effect, especially evident in the fiscal burden that has been posed by the HIV/AIDS epidemic, health care for which is projected to cost in excess of $500 million USD in South Africa by the year 2009. 15 If the projected trend, which indicates that South and Southeast Asia will surpass Africa in terms of infections by the year 2010, continues, countries with fragile economies and public health infrastructures could experience demographic upheaval and wide destabilization, including the possible reduction of the general gross domestic product by as much as 20 percent. 16 The negative impact that disease can have on a social order of the state, its function, and psyche poses the fourth effect. One example of this effect can be seen in the distortion, resulting from AIDS, of the wantok system of Papua, New Guinea, which formalizes reciprocal responsibilities that ensure that those who encounter hard times receive care from extended family members. Another example is the reaction in the Gulu district of Uganda, where the outbreak of Ebola in late 2000 led to a complete withdrawal of the populace from the outside world, such that common societal interactions and functions were reduced to a bare minimum. Adverse psychological as well as societal consequences have been associated with the emotional stress suffered during times of such withdrawal, continual subjection to poor sanitary conditions, and outbreaks of diseases. 17 The spread of infectious diseases can pose a fifth threat as a catalyst for regional instability, as seen already in the military, demographic, and fiscal effects of the AIDS crisis in Africa. Epidemics can galvanize mass population flows across borders, thereby fostering economic problems and creating a widespread volatility that can develop quickly into heightened tension both within and between countries.",

The costs of outbreaks can be staggering and can compromise or even retard economic development processes, particularly in developing countries. One result is the diminished size of the workforce when an epidemic occurs. Particularly in developing countries, productivity hampered by a handicapped workforce can have a seriously adverse effect on the national economy. As has occurred especially with HIV/AIDS, the incidence of new cases disproportionately affects developing countries, in which 90 percent of such cases are found. Because HIV/AIDS affects primarily individuals in their prime economic productive years, the consequences to the local, regional, and national economies can be devastating. 3 Also, because this population is in its child-bearing years, the socioeconomic consequences include a huge number of children and adolescents who are left orphans when the parents succumb to AIDS, leaving the responsibility of their children's care to extended family members, many of whom already are ill themselves or unable to bear the burden psychologically or financially. Beyond the strain on the family is the social consequence of adolescents and even children resorting to prostitution as a means of survival, thereby increasing their risks of acquiring and/or transmitting HIV and other infectious diseases.",

Also, agricultural practices have changed considerably with the advent of new technologies, which allow farmers to breed animals in close proximity to one another but provide an ideal setting for the transmission of viral and bacterial agents. The rapid transport of animals from one locale to another provides yet another means for transferring infectious disease across the country, with little ability to track the geographic spread of infections, especially those that are zoonotic. Importation of food products adds additional threat of exposure to a variety of diseases when nonhygienic food production, preparation, and handling practices in the countries of origin introduced pathogens into other countries, including the United States. 13 During the past 2 decades, the increase in migration and movement of populations also have resulted in the disappearance of national boundaries as far as the transmission of diseases is concerned. 20 In the United States, more than 1 million immigrants and refugees enter annually, often bringing with them a burden of disease. This concern is especially true for the 3 to 4 million undocumented aliens who enter illegally and do not undergo the required medical screening that is required for legal immigrants. Exacerbating the problem is that many of these same individuals do not have access to adequate health care once they enter the United States and, thereby, become reservoirs for various diseases, posing extensive public health threats. 21 In other instances, internal displacement of individuals due to conflict, war, and natural disasters has facilitated the transmission of microbes, as has the increased poverty, poor sanitation, and inadequate nutrition that often accompany these incidents. In 1990, the number of displaced persons worldwide was estimated to be 30 million. When individuals are displaced, they often must resort to using temporary living quarters such as refugee camps and temporary shelters, both of which are harbingers of diseases and share the risk factors associated with other ideal environments for emerging infectious diseases and re-emerging infectious diseases: crowding, limited access to medical care, lack of clean water and food, and inadequate barriers for disease-carrying agents. 22 A prime example is the migration of 500,000 to 800,000 Rwandan refugees into Zaire in 1994. In this incident, cholera and Shigella dysenteriae type 1 swept through the refugee camp, killing almost 50,000 refugees during the first month of their displacement. 22 Economic hardships also have contributed to the migration from rural to urban areas, allowing diseases that once were relatively isolated to reach larger populations, especially those in slum areas, which serve as breeding grounds for physical diseases and social ills such as drug abuse and prostitution. 22",

A glycoprotein envelope may be responsible for mediating viral entry into cells, tissue tropism, and host range. Although serologic cross-reactions exist between WNV and SLE virus, SLE virus does not cause avian infection. 26 Six viral subtypes that represent two principal lineages have been proposed; one of them includes strains that have been associated with neurologic infections in humans. 34 Natural infections have been found in a wide variety of birds and mammals. Most notable among these infections have been encephalitis outbreaks in horses; mild febrile illness with myopathy in dogs; and widespread epornitic episodes of fatal disseminated viscerotropic and neurotropic infection in North American crows, cranes, geese, and various passerines, columbiformes, and raptors. 35 Strains from different geographic regions have been differentiated antigenically and genetically, and they have been correlated in a novel application of cluster analysis to patterns of human virulence. Strains found in the United States are related genetically most closely to strains that circulated as early as 1997 in Israel, where they were implicated in human outbreaks and epornitic diseases involving principally geese and cranes. 35 ",

Three major clinical categories of WNV infection have been reported: asymptomatic infection, West Nile fever, and meningoencephalitis. 26 WNV commonly manifests as a subclinical infection, with an incubation period of 1 to 6 days. A West Nile fever, in which the patient experiences an abrupt onset of fever, headache, muscle aches, conjunctivitis, pharyngitis, gastrointestinal symptoms, chills, malaise, arthralgia, and myalgia, developed in approximately 20 percent of patients during the 1999 epidemic. 33 Headache often is severe and may be accompanied by ocular pain. Most patients experience grippe symptoms. A morbilliform rash affecting the trunk and extremities manifests in approximately 20 to 50 percent of cases, most frequently children. 26, 35 Lymphadenopathy may be prominent, and arthralgias have been noted in some outbreaks. Defervescence usually occurs within 5 days and, as with dengue, it may be followed by a recrudescence of fever and symptoms in some cases. 35 Poor prognostic factors include presence of profound weakness, deep coma, failure to produce specific anti-WNV IgM antibody, immunosuppressive treatment, and coexisting conditions such as hypertension or diabetes.",

Generally, vero cells and continuous mosquito cell lines are used. Intracerebral inoculation of suckling mice is a sensitive system that has been used in reference laboratories to isolate the virus. Direct detection of viral genomic sequences from CSF is highly sensitive. Detection of virus-specific IgM in serum is presumptive evidence of recent infection, and the presence of IgM in the CSF confirms that the patient has had recent infection. Confirmation also can be established by demonstrating four-fold or greater changes in antibody titer by hemaglutination, complement fixation, immunofluorescence, or neutralization. The most specific is neutralization antibody assay, which in most cases must be performed to establish the diagnosis.",

Neurologic infection also may result in aseptic meningitis, an encephalitis syndrome including changes in mental status, cranial nerve and bulbar palsies, motor weakness, abnormal reflexes, and myelitis. Optic neuritis and polyradiculitis and plyneuropathy with elements of axonal degeneration have been reported, as have generalized weakness that resembles that of Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and polio-like flaccid paralysis that appears to result from cell damage of the anterior horn. Persistent weakness, memory loss, and movement disorders, may develop in as many as 30 percent of survivors. 26 The case fatality rate in neurologic cases is 10 percent.
