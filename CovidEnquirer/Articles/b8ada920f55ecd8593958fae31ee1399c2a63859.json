Three calves were studied in stages of spontaneous cryptosporidial infection with particular reference to the relation of the cryptosporidia to the follicleassociated epithelium (FAE) over the ileal Pe~'er's patch (IPP) . In early infection scanning electron microscopy and streptavidin immunoperoxidase staining showed marked predilection of cryptosporidia for the FAt:. Cryptosporidial antigen was also found in subepithelial tissue. both in the domes over the II'P and in villi. apparently in macrophages. where the parasites seemed to be progressively degraded. The .'AE showed long tightly spaced microvilli. replacing normal low folds and protrusions. particularly in late infection. Endocytosis of indian ink was restricted to the cell periphery in late infection. contrasting the normal. more even distribution of endocytosis in the FAE apical cytoplasm. t'e\\\\ parasites were seen in the intestinal mucosa at this stage. At convalescence the FAE was normal. but all stages of infection were characterised by elongation of microvilli in absorptive cells.",

The present study concerns another frequent infection in calves. cryptosporidiosis (review, Angus 1983 ) with respect to changes in the FAE. Such studies have attracted particular interest after the demonstration that the 11'1' is responsible for the antigenindependent primary generation of B-lymphocytes in sheep (Reynolds and Morris 1984 , Gerber et al 1986 . Disturbances of the 11'1' function arising as a result of infections may thus have consequences for the individual's ability to develop immunity later in life. Since changes of the rAE often may be of an apparently persistent nature (Landsverk 1981 b) emphasis is given to examination of both early and late phases of the disease. Some attention is also given to the possibility that the FAE may function in antigen transfer to immunocompetent lymphoid tissue,",

They were also smaller, probably being composed of younger stages. In formol-calcium fixed sections, where the endogenous peroxidase had been inhibited by hydrogen peroxide treatment, cryptosporidial antigen was seen in apparent macrophages in the lamina propria of the villi over the IPP as well as proximal to the IPP (Fig 6) . Sometimes the reacting material within the leucocytes had the appearance of the brush border cryptosporidia. More often, smaller particles were found, probably formed by degradation of larger particles. In the apparent final stages of degradation a faint granular staining was seen within the leucocytes.

There are studies in other mammalian species suggesting that the PI' is also susceptible to infections (Sprinz et al 1956 , La Brec and Formal 1961 , Carter and Collins 1974 , Hohmann et al 1978 , although the ruminant FAE over the 11'1' is of a type different from that so far described over the PI' in other mammals. The properties of FAE over the 11'1' that may contribute to a predilection by microorganisms are not known. Among the possible factors may be absence of goblet cells in the FAE, a modified cell surface and enzyme activity (Torres-Medina 198 I, Landsverk 1981 a) and a low frequency of antibody secreting plasma cells in the domes (T. Landsverk, unpublished) . Of interest is the recent demonstration that the FAE over the human PI' is deficient in secretory component, which suggests that this FAE lacks IgA transporting capacity (Brandtzaeg 1985) . No comparable studies have been made in ruminants, but such a condition if present, would render the epithelium more susceptible to infections.",

Elongation of the microvilli closely adjacent to the parasites has been reported (Pohlenz et al 1978) . However, in the present material the change was also found in cases where parasites were rare. Exotoxins have, so far, not been associated with cryptosporidia, and the cause of the change therefore remains obscure. The consequences of microvillous growth in the FAE seem to include a conformation of luminal membrane that is less compatible with an endocytic function. Endocytosis is apparently one of the main functions of the FAE, its normal lack of rigid cytoskeletal elements and special surface morphology rendering it well equipped for that purpose. The altered pattern of endocytosis of colloidal carbon demonstrated in the present study may thus be due to the growth of microvilli.",

The uptake of carbon particles in the FAE over the IPP demonstrated here confirms an earlier work in lambs (Reynolds and Morris 1983), and may be associated with such an antigen sampling function. Calf rotavirus has likewise been shown to be taken up through endocytosis by the FAE over the IPP (Torres-Medina 1984) . In cryptosporidiosis of man a high antibody titre develops (Campbell and Current 1983) , probably due to a transport of antigen to the subepithelial tissue allowing an encounter with immunocompetent cells. The cryptosporidia may otherwise be inaccessible to the immune system, hidden as they are in a pocket of th~apical epithelial cell membrane (Hampton and Rosario 1966) . It is quite possible that cryptosporidial antigen may be transported to the subepithelial tissue by phagocytosis of the FAE over the IPP. The FAE over the IPP has thus been shown to phagocytise Q. 6 lAm latex particles (T. Landsverk, unpublished) . However, the fact that cryptosporidial antigen was also found in the lamina propria of villi, even proximal to the IPP, suggests that the phagocytising capacity of the FAE was not indispensable to the transport of the antigen.",
