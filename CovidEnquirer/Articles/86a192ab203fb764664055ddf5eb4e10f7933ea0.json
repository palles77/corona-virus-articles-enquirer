(2013) HIV The utilization of these BWAs in previous bioterror incidences leading to adverse consequences has been well documented in various review articles (Jansen et al., 2014; Madad, 2014; Krishan et al., 2017) . Following the historical pattern of biological terror attacks and disease outbreaks, it can be concluded that biotechnology has accidently unleashed a new threat to mankind in the form of virulent bioweapons to inflict mass causalities and devastation (Lesser et al., 1999) . So, highly efficient and cost-effective medical countermeasures based on ethnic specificity of the biological agent need to be developed with the purpose of bio-preparedness and biosecurity (Horn, 2003; Jansen et al., 2014; Pal et al., 2016) . Associated risks with human pathogens must be evaluated on the basis of rate of mortality, availability of treatment and prophylactic measures, need for hospitalization, public perception, and epidemiological spread (Rotz et al., 2002) .",

            "text": "Any documentation related to history of biological warfare is difficult to extract from the literature since all the allegations are based solely on eye-witness accounts and circumstantial evidence after the event. Moreover, the allegations in most of the cases have been denied by the accused parties. In 1155 AD, at a battle in Tortona, Italy, Barbarossa broadened the scope of biological warfare by using the dead bodies of soldiers as well as animals to pollute wells. During war with the French in 18th century, British forces under the direction of Sir Jettray Ahmest gave blankets that had been used by smallpox and yellow fever victims to the native Americans in order to spread disease (Frischknecht, 2003) . During the US civil war, in 1863 AD, General Johnson used dead bodies of sheep and pigs to pollute drinking water at Videsburg, Mississippi. During World War I, in 1915, the first allegation was made against the Germans that they had attempted to employ the biological agents of Cholera against Italy and Plague against Britain. Later, in 1916, they were accused of using Anthrax at Bucharest, Romania (Metcalfe, 2002) . The first incidence of biological warfare was documented during World War I when millions of deaths were recorded due to pandemic outbreak of The 1918 Spanish Influenza virus (H1N1) that triggered naturally. This was the most striking example of indirect offense where a disease causing biological agent was used to deteriorate combat capabilities of enemy forces at the war front. This perhaps led to the establishment of the concept of biowarfare agents and bioterrorism. The period from 1940 to 1969 can be considered as the golden age of biological warfare research and development. In the last few decades, several incidences of bioterrorism/biological warfare were recorded (Ainscough, 2002) .",

As a rapidly evolving super power, the FSU initiated its biological warfare program during the mid-1960s to 1970s, when they started showing interest in genetics and genetic manipulations of potential human pathogens. Despite being a signatory member of the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapon Convention (BTWC), the FSU developed highly potent and deadly chimeric biological warfare agents. Extensive research was carried out to weaponize the developed agents to powder or aerosol formulations for direct loading into munitions such as spray tanks and cluster bombs. The first genetically engineered vaccine tolerant pathogen Francisella tularensis, causing tularemia, was established under the \"Enzyme\" program during the 1950s to 1960s, which modernized the concept of biological warfare. Until 1992, they had a repository of 52 highly contagious strains that could overcome all the barriers of immune systems and current medical treatments. Anthrax strain 836, Pasechnik's superplague strain, glanders strain, myelin toxin forming Yersinia pestis, tularemia (Schu S-4), and viruses like Ebola, Marburg and influenza are only a few to name them. They also tried their hands at the production of chimeric viruses by introducing genetic elements from Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEEV), Ebola (EBOV), and Marburg (MARV) into native smallpox virus (Ainscough, 2002) .",

Introduction of antibiotic resistant genes in pathogenic strains can significantly enhance lethality of disease by reducing treatment options (Athamna et al., 2004) . Similarly, the prophylactic effects can be circumvented by suppression of the immune system through the expression of immune modifier genes using viral vectors, e.g., expression of mouse interlukin-4 in recombinant Ectromelia virus suppresses immune functions of the host and overcomes genetic resistance to mouse pox. In 1998, a DNA sequence based investigation on the preserved samples of 11 victims revealed simultaneous occurrence of 4 distinct virulent variants of B. anthracis, showing the continuation of a biological warfare program, which was reportedly denied from time to time by FSU. Surprisingly, genetic manipulation procedures were adopted to enhance resistance of the existing etiological agents to high temperature and the available range of therapeutic antibiotics and prophylactic measures, and to make novel immune-suppressive agents that could be easily weaponized when needed. These facts indicate the violation of 1972 BTWC by FSU, as they were continuously engaged in developing designer lethal agents, which they might have integrated into their special war plans (Ainscough, 2002) .",

Later, a lower level bench scientist in Pasechnik's lab, referred by the code name \"Temple Fortune,\" also defected to the United Kingdom, 3 years after the defection of Dr. Pasechnik, where he replicated his previous account of a biowarfare program and then disclosed it to the British government. In late 1992, Dr. Kanatjan Alibekov (now known as Ken Alibek) became the third defector from the Russian biowarfare program (Mangold and Goldberg, 1999; Tucker, 1999; Ainscough, 2002) . In 1999, Alibek's article on \"Biohazard\" narrated his first-hand experience as a member of the FSU program and emphasized the extensive research and development of genetically manipulated biological warfare agents, large scale production facilities, weaponization of BW agents, defensive measures, and future BW goals of the Russian Government (Alibek, 2008) . Former USSR president Mikhail Gorbachev (1990-91) and, later on, Russian president Boris Yeltsen (1991-99) had announced the termination of their biowarfare programs in the early 1990s. But many intelligent analysts suspected the execution of a biowarfare program in a very secretive mode and its substitution in the Russian military doctrine.",

The US military has repeatedly discussed the possible use of biotechnology for upgrading offensive warfare potential by developing material degrading microbes to destroy biofuels, construction materials, and stealth paints. The first evidence emerged in 1998, when J. Campbell at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington DC described the possible application of genetically modified fungi to destroy military paints in 72 h. The second evidence came to light in 1990, when the United States started conducting field trials on pathogenic Pleospora papaveracea strains against the drug producing crop, opium poppy. Potential risks were successively tested by evaluating crop destruction in 2001 in Tashkant, Uzbekistan. Similarly, pathogenic Fusarium oxysporum strains were developed in the United States to destroy coca plants with field test scheduled to be held in Columbia, 2001 . However, worldwide protest against field trials on pathogenic destruction of drug producing (cocaine, benzoylecgonine, ecgonine) cash crops produced strong public opposition leading to termination of the project. The third evidence came from the use of psychoactive substances (sleeping gas-BZ) as biological weapons in the Moscow hostage crisis in 2002, which caused death of more than 170 people. The US Marine Corps also investigated the military usefulness of benzodiazepines and alpha-2 adrenoreceptor agonists as potential weapons. Other BTWC signature states have developed potential biowarfare agents through extensive research and development, but as far as their delivery is concerned, it is still in its infancy as compared to weaponization of biowarfare agents by FSU (Van Aken and Hammond, 2003) .",

Out of a total of eight genes, hemeagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), and polymerase B1 (PB1) were considered important virulent factors contributing to the severity of the disease. Sixteen different variants were reported for HA antigens, mainly aglycoproteins in nature that help in attachment of virus to the host cell, while nine subtypes of NA, antigenic glycoproteins, were reported in humans and animals, with N1 and N2 linked to epidemics in man and others, specifically, for ducks and chickens. HA type-5 (HA5) and NA type-1 (N1) are important components of viral capsids required for assembly of infectious viral particles. Neuraminidase activity is important to release replicated viruses from the infected host cell. The Spanish Flu virus probably originated in birds, and evolved to cause the 1918 epidemic.",

The main aim of this new approach is to understand an organism's pathogenic properties in relation to humans and to protect or treat human viral disease, if any. It is, however, necessary to understand the detailed mechanism of packaging viral genomes, which enhances infectivity of the synthesized host specific chimeric constructs. Different models have been proposed for encapsulation of viral genomes, as discussed below. For genome packaging, viruses must make a distinction between viral and host nucleic acid, which is assisted by an outer membrane capsid protein with receptor binding domain (RBD) that helps in recognition and subsequent binding to the target genome. In case of L-A virus of yeast, a stem-loop secondary structure and a site-specific sequence at 5\u2032-end of the genome is recognized by polymerase-group antigen (pol-gag) fusion protein prior to packaging (Fujimura et al., 1992) . Although only a few applications of virus synthesis have been described as yet, key recent findings have been the resurgence of influenza virus and polioviruses (Wimmer et al., 2009) . Various methods of in vitro packaging of viral genes for the assembly of infectious viruses are described in subsequent paragraphs.",

P4 ATPase comprises a hexameric multifunctional unit (lined with a helix \u03b16 and loops L1 and L2) that plays an important role in procapsid assembly and ssRNA packaging. During infection, it acts as a passive channel for the extrusion of newly synthesized mRNA molecules from the virus. The genome of \u03c612 encloses three segmented dsRNAs, each comprising a positive strand sequentially recognized by the procapsid, which undergoes conformational changes to accommodate all the RNA segments. The loops L1 and L2 are vital for RNA binding and translocation. The phosphatebinding P-loop upon ATP hydrolysis changes its confirmation from \"down\" to \"up\" form, accompanied by similar transition of \u03b16 and loop L2 from \"up\" to \"down\" position, signifying the driving force for RNA translocation. The arginine finger of hexameric ATPase motors plays an important role in sequential ATP hydrolysis, inducing conformational changes that direct the trans arginine finger to active center of ATPase (neighboring subunit), thus triggering the successive ATP hydrolysis.",

ATP hydrolysis is triggered upon dsDNA binding to C-terminal domain (gp17 subunit) and thereby positioning the cis \"arginine\" finger of N-terminal domain into the ATPase active center that further results in subsequent conformation changes. These changes align opposite charges of both N-and C-terminal domains that pull C-terminal domain towards N-terminal domain by the action of electrostatic forces, leading to packaging two base pairs of dsDNA (Sun et al., 2010) .",

An in vitro course of action for the packaging of AAV was studied by Zhou and Muzyczka (1998) . Synthesis of an infectious AAV particle was done by using its replicative-form of DNA as a substrate, AAV Rep, and capsid proteins in order to transfer recombinant gene to mammalian cells. Two types of products formed, both were heat-resistant, indicating an appropriate ratio of protein-to-DNA. In addition, products also share structural resemblance of mature AAV particles. An efficiently synthesized particle enclosing intact terminal repeats always shows chloroform, DNase I, and heat-resistance, pertaining to an authentic AAV particle. Resistance is known to be a vital property for packaging purposes. However, nonpathogenic and persistent nature, in combination with its broad range of infection, as reported by Wright and coworkers, marked this virus as an imperative nominee for a therapeutic gene transfer vector (Wright et al., 2003) .",

Effective protection against BWAs is quite difficult because of their intricate detection and expensive protection measures. To counter this threat, several countries have established their own biodefence programs to strengthen the strategies for detection, protection, and decontamination of biowarfare agents (Pal et al., 2016) . Early detection and identification of BWAs is essential to initiate corrective emergency responses for management of such incidents. Efforts are being made across the globe for development of efficient technologies and systems for detection and identification of BWAs. Many advanced molecular and microbiological sensing techniques such as antibody-based immunoassays, cellular fatty acid profiling, flow cytometry, nucleic acid based detection, mass spectrometry, microbiological culturing, and genomic analysis have been used for primary identification of biological agents. These techniques are highly reliable, sensitive, and selective, and have been successfully applied for detection of potential biowarfare agents. However, despite the handiness of available techniques and tools, no foolproof system is available for the complete detection of hazardous biowarfare agents. Regardless of being highly efficient, these detection methods possess various drawbacks such as complicated and laborious isolation and purification procedures, low detection limits, contrasting etiology and pathology, and different physiochemical and structural attributes of bioagents, which ultimately affect the detection efficacy (Suter, 2003; Sapsford et al., 2008; Das and Kataria, 2010; Madad, 2014) .",

Antibodies bind to specific antigens present on the surface of the cell and form a colored or detectable complex, which ultimately marks the presence/detection of a bioagent in the sample. Enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) has been mainly used for quantitative detection of antigen following the basic principle of immunoassays. ELISA has been widely used for diagnosis of several diseases and simultaneous screening of large number of samples. Thus, the technique is highly efficient, economical, and reliable. To date, ELISAs have been successfully employed for the detection of biowarfare agents such as B. anthracis, B. pseudomallei, B. mallei, Brucella abortus, Ebola virus, F. tularensis, Marburg virus, toxins, and Y. pestis. Besides these, fluorescent microscopy has also been used for biowarfare agent detection, where a fluorescent labeled antibody attached to antigenic receptors present on the surface of the microbial cells aids in its detection. Immuno-histochemical based methods have also enabled detection of some viruses such as Alphaviruses and Chikanguniya viruses (Wang et al., 2008) . Other immunoassay, namely, hand-held immuno-chromatographic assays (HHIAs), are also used for detection of biowarfare agents such as B. anthracis, B. abortus, B. pseudomallei, botulinum, F. tularensis, smallpox virus, Ricin toxin, variola virus, and Y. pestis. HHIAs are cost-effective, simple, rapid, and are performed on nitrocellulose or nylon membranes and are based on lateral flow immunoassays. Even having several advantages, these assays are less sensitive and specific as compared to other immunological methods (Gomes-Solecki et al., 2005; Wang et al., 2009; Ghosh and Goel, 2012; Sharma et al., 2013; Pal et al., 2016) .",

In recent years, NGS technologies have gained much importance and validation as an effective biodefense strategy due to their highly specific and rapid detection capabilities. NGS techniques have been applied for B. anthracis detection in air and soil samples. Strain-specific polymorphism has also been identified by NGS in the case of B. anthracis and Y. pestis. F. tularensis was detected in human abscess samples of unknown etiology by next generation direct DNA sequencing technique.

Development of chimeric, humanized, and antiviral antibodies has been very beneficial for treatment of many viral infections. An FDA approved monoclonal antibody known as Synagis was developed and proved successful in prevention and treatment of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). This antibody inhibits viral replication by binding specifically to the RSV surface glycoprotein and has been considered as the primary medical means of providing protection against RSV (Cohen, 2000) . Host cell receptor blockers have also proven to be efficient in inhibiting viral infections by blocking virus entry into the cell. Receptor-blocking has been commonly carried out via application of monoclonal antibodies that bind to specific epitopes present on the receptor molecules. A MAb was generated against ICAM-1 (adhesion molecule responsible for viral entry and attachment), which was capable of providing protection against infections caused by human rhinoviruses (HRV) (Marlin et al., 1990) . However, the efficacy of MAbs is limited to an extent because of their low functional affinity for adhesion molecules in comparison to multivalent viral particles (Casasnovas and Springer, 1995) . To overcome this challenge, avidity or functional affinity of antiviral antibodies was improved by the generation of recombinant antibodies. A tetravalent recombinant antibody, CFY196, with improved avidity was developed against ICAM-1 and was capable of preventing HRV infections (Charles et al., 2003) .",

Successful animal and cell based trials have been carried out, which confirms the use of ribozymes as potent antiviral agents. Ribozymes have been efficient viral inhibitors for infections such as influenza, hepatitis B and C, HIV, etc. (Yu et al., 1993; Tang et al., 1994; Welch et al., 1996 Welch et al., , 1997 . HEPTAZYME, a modified ribozyme, cleaves target entry site of the hepatitis C virus and hence inhibits the infection. However, further research on use of ribozymes as biotherapeutics has been hampered by low potency and inefficient in vivo intracellular delivery. In contrast to this, RNA interference has significantly enhanced potency in comparison to other technologies. Therefore, only low levels of RNAi based antiviral drugs are sufficient to generate an effective immune response. Synthetic siRNAs have potential applications as potent antiviral agents. RNAi technology has been successfully applied for inhibition of replication of several pathogenic viruses such as filoviruses, influenza virus, HIV-1, poliovirus, and RSV (Jacque et al., 2002; Novina et al., 2003; Ge et al., 2003; Ursic-Bedoya et al., 2013) .",

An EBOV outbreak in West Africa claimed at least 11,000 lives and caused a huge economic loss to the country during 2013-16 (Bausch, 2017) . Baize and coworkers suggested that a single spill over from animal reservoir is sufficient to initiate a fresh outbreak of the EBOV (Baize et al., 2014) . Egyptian fruit bats Rousettus aegyptiacus have been identified as likely reservoirs of MARV and EBOV without developing symptoms (Jones et al., 2015; Paweska et al., 2016) . Many studies have reported essential involvement of Niemann-pick C1 glycoprotein for entry into bat and human cells. However, the magnitude of infection may be species dependent in these filoviruses (Carette et al., 2011; C\u00f4t\u00e9 et al., 2011; Hoffmann et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2019) .

Localized small-scale remediation has usually been done by treating contaminated surfaces with liquid formulations of decontaminant solutions such as hydrogen peroxide, chlorine dioxide gas dissolved in water, phenolics, sodium hypochlorite, and quaternary ammonium compounds, or decontamination foams.

Hence, the use of such perilous chemicals is limited to an extent because of requirement of special biosafety approvals for their storage, transport, and disposal. Also, some risks have been associated with use of wet chemicals as they often lead to the corrosion of materials such as leather, plastics, paints, metals, rubber, and skin. So, the use of these hazardous chemicals on sensitive equipment and materials is not recommended. Moreover, these chemicals are nonspecific in nature and, when released into the environment, lead to toxification and degradation of our natural resources. Thus, the existing decontamination systems are not thoroughly effective (Hawley and Eitzen, 2001; Raber et al., 2001; Kumar et al., 2010) .",

Decontaminants are required that are generally present in dry forms, can be easily transported with no mass storage requirement, and are fast working. Hence, alternative decontamination methods have been developed that include the use of ionizing and nonionizing radiations, thermal energy, and reactive gases produced by plasmas. Ionizing gamma radiations were also used for the decontamination of biological agents but somehow led to the destruction of sensitive equipment. Nonionizing ultraviolet (UV) radiation has also been tested for the destruction of some biological agents, but the success of this technique was limited because of resistance of dried spores to UV radiation. Thermal energy methods have also been tried, but their efficiency is limited by the temperature constraint; also, it leads to the damage of surfaces or equipment and the method is relatively time consuming.",

Emission spectroscopy of the plasma torch revealed the production of ample amounts of reactive atomic oxygen that effectively oxidized the biological agents. Moreover, plasma or gas in a highly energized state is highly reactive, which is capable of destruction of all kinds of organic contaminants by means of a nonthermal method. For decontamination purposes, B. cereus was selected simulant of B. anthracis spores. The results revealed that all spores were killed in <8s at 3 cm distance, 12 s at 4 cm distance, and 16 s at 5 cm distance away from the nozzle of the torch. Thus, plasma torch can be also used as an alternative decontamination technique (Lai et al., 2005) . A research and development project was also initiated for providing novel decontamination systems against biowarfare agents with key focus on effective, economical, fast, nontoxic, and specific decontamination. The project also aimed for the development of adsorptive elimination technologies or deactivation technologies using photocatalysis technique (Seto, 2009) .",

With the rapid evolution in synthetic biology techniques, the construction of synthetic biological agents and their further use as next generation bioweapons has been rapidly increasing, which eventually has enhanced the risk of biological warfare compared to the past. Many draft and whole genome sequences of important pathogenic bacteria and viruses infecting humans have been decoded to date and are accessible through nucleic acid sequence databases, such as Genbank, EMBL, DDBJ, GDB: The Human Genome DB, Microbial Genome DB for Comparative Analysis (MBGD), Virulence Factors of Bacterial Pathogens (VFDB), The National Microbial Pathogen DB Resource (NMPDR), Virus Pathogen Resource (ViPR), Integrated DB for Viral Genomics (viruSITE), Barcode of Life Data Systems, CTD (Comparative Toxicogenomics DB), etc. So, there exists a virtual platform in the form of essential genes, virulence factors, or synthetic constructs with humanized infectious elements that provide huge scope to the bioweaponeers to develop next generation bioweapons based on designer genes or designer diseases models for instigating serious consequences in future bioterror attacks. A simple alteration in genetic compliment may make a pathogen more deadly than the existing natural forms. The emergence of next generation bioweapons including chimeric agents previously unknown to man can be even more dangerous and challenging than natural agents as they can cross all the barriers of pathogenicity. Also, due to current limitations in the methods of detection, protection, and decontamination, there exists a huge knowledge gap that needs attention for developing appropriate defensive strategies against biowarfare agents.",

Discontinuation of biowarfare programs can have a serious limitation on the nation's ability to develop appropriate defensive tools such as antibiotics, vaccines, and other therapeutics. Deployment of biowarfare programs in the military doctrine of a nation without endangering military alliances is always advantageous for national security and protecting the vulnerable civilian population. Additionally, domestic laws against use of bioweapons should be enacted. The Biological and Toxin Weapon Convention should be strengthened through a legal binding instrument. The authors highly recommend the use of physical protective and prophylactic measures to eliminate natural spread of existing contagious biowarfare agents at a mass scale, especially among the most vulnerable populations such as children with poor immunity and armed forces involved in direct combat at the war front.",

The causal agent was soon identified as a new species of coronavirus named \"severe acute respiratory syndrome virus coronavirus (SARS-CoV)\" by the World Health Organization. SARS-CoV disappeared in July 2003, as rapidly as it had emerged in 2002. Bats are natural reservoirs of SARS-CoV and none of the human in vitro culture systems supports viral replication. The possibility of human adaptation of bat SARS-CoV was studied using synthetic SARS-CoV viral cDNA. Authors created artificial clones by exchanging the receptor binding domain (RBD) with that of human SARS-CoV capable of infecting VeroE6 cell, DBT-hACE2, DBT-cACE2 (murine cell lines), HAE human cell lines, and BALB/c mice. This was the example of the largest retroviral genome (approx. 30 kb) capable of replicating and infecting human cells.",
