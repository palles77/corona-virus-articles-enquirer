In addition, it has recently become apparent that lipid-containing viruses occur in plants and bacteria as well. although their known occurrence is not as frequent as in the case of viruses which infect animal cells. The lipid is generally present in a limiting membrane structure termed the viral envelope; hence these viruses are referred to as enveloped viruses. Although the presence of lipid serves to distinguish enveloped from non-enveloped viruses, lipid-containing viruses are a diverse group of agents which can be classified into several major groups on the basis of the structural properties of the virus particle. Fortunately, viruses which were originally classified together on the basis of structure have turned out almost invariably to be very similar in the biochemical processes of their replication, and to some extent in their biological properties.",

Particular emphasis will be placed on those groups of viruses which form by a process of budding at a cellular membrane. These viruses are excellent systems for the study of the structure and biosynthesis of membranes for a variety of reasons, which will be discussed at length in this paper. The viruses can be isolated in a high degree of purity and contain a limited number of structural protein components, all of which appear to be coded by the viral genome. The lipids of the membranes of many of these viruses closely reflect those of the plasma membrane of the host cell of origin: thus it is possible to obtain viruses with the same proteins but different lipids by growing a given virus in two different cell types. Similarly, one can obtain viral membranes with similar lipid composition but no protein in common by growing two different viruses in the same cell type. For studies of membrane biogenesis, it is significant that the envelope proteins of many of these viruses become an integral part of the cell surface membrane prior to formation of virus by a process of budding. In addition, it is often the case that host cell biosynthesis is markedly inhibited during virus infection, and it is therefore possible to analyse a system in which only a small number of identifiable proteins are produced by a cell, and to follow the pathway by which they are incorporated into the cellular plasma membrane.",

The arboviruses consist of over 200 different agents, many of which are causes of encephalitis. There are two main antigenic subgroups, A and B, with spherical particles 600 700 A in diameter. However, other arboviruses differ in morphology; hence the name togavirus has been adopted for the group of agents which have the structure of the arboviruses in groups A and B.

The pox viruses, which will not be discussed in detail, differ in that their membrane forms de novo in the cytoplasm (Section VILE). They have a much more complex structure, about which many questions remain to be answered.",

(2) All enveloped viruses contain one or more species of glycoproteins which are located on the external surface of the viral envelope, forming the layer of projections which are visible by electron microscopy. (3) All carbohydrate-free polypeptides appear to be located in the interior of the virus particle. In many viruses, one of these non-glycosylated polypeptides is a major component which appears to be associated with the inner surface of the viral membranes. (4) The viral polypeptides are coded by the viral genome. This is particularly clear with the major structural polypeptides, and even with minor components there is no instance in which it has been established that a polypeptide derived from the host cell is an essential viral component.",

In many instances it is possible to isolate the viral nucleocapsid, i.e. a symmetrical structure composed of the viral nucleic acid and a protein shell showing either helical or icosahedral symmetry. The myxo-, paramyxo-, and rhabdoviruses all have nucleocapsids with helical symmetry which contain a single major polypeptide species [35] [36] [37] [38] . The togavirus nucleocapsid may be icosahedral [39, 40] , and also contains a single polypeptide specms [41, 42] . A single polypeptide also appears to be closely associated with the RNA of the RNA tumor viruses [43, 44] but no symmetry was evident in the ribonucleoproteins of these viruses [43] so that the term nucleocapsid may not apply. The herpes virus particle possesses a large icosahedral nucleocapsid which, unlike that of the various RNA-containing viruses, appears to contain many different species of polypeptides [32] .",

The glycopeptides obtained from Sindbis virus after Pronase digestion were analyzed by gel filtration [61] . Three glycopeptide fractions, differing in carbohydrate molecular weight and composition, were recognized. The smallest contained only mannose and glucosamine, suggesting, by analogy with some mammalian glycopeptides, that this was a \"core\" glycopeptide from which the larger ones were obtained by the further action of specific glycosyltransferases. Since the viral genome is insufficiently large to specify the minimum of five glycosyltransferases required for incorporation of five different monosaccharides, it was suggested that the incorporation occurred via host cell transferases. Grimes and Burge [62] showed that neithel the specific activity, nor the acceptor specificity of two different cellular glycosyltransferases was altered by infection with Sindbis virus. Further, they showed that Sindbis glycoprotein can act as an acceptor for the sialyltransferase from uninfected cells. Since viral glycoprotein is the only glycoprotein being synthesized in the infected cell, the results indicate that host transferases are involved in viral glycoprotein synthesis [62] .",

Thus, it appears that the extent of host cell specificity of the viral carbohydrate sequences will only be resolved by much more complete composition and sequence data than have yet been obtained.",

This has proven to be a rapid, quantitative assay for influenza and other viruses. The hemaggluthain is the component to which neutralizing antibody is directed [68, 69] , and extensive antigenic variation in the hemagglutinin protein is the major reason for the frequent appearance of the new strains of influenza virus which give rise to pandemics of influenza. The hemagglutinin is one of the glycoproteins on the surface of the influenza virion, the other being the enzyme neuraminidase, which cleaves neuraminic acid from the same species of glycoproteins to which the hemagglutinin will attach. The neuraminidase appears to function in elution of virus from the cell surface [70, 71] .",

The two chains have been separated preparatively on a gradient of guanidine. HC1 and dithiothreitol, and their amino acid compositions have been determined. Polypeptide HA~ contained about 9 times more proline and much more glucosamine than polypeptide HA2, but otherwise the two chains had very similar amino acid composition. Thus amino acid analysis did not indicate that one of the two polypeptides had a marked hydrophobic composition. Other evidence suggests that polypeptide HA2 may be located in the part of the spike attached to the viral envelope.

Concentration of the material led to the formation of crystals consisting of the two glycoproteins. Thus it appears that bromelain removes a small segment of the HA 2 polypeptide which was involved in attachment of the hemagglutinin to the viral envelope, and that the remainder of the spike is resistant to proteolytic digestion. The modified spikes do not in fact cause agglutination of erythrocytes, indicating that the missing segment may be a hydrophobic region responsible for the ability of the spikes to aggregate into rosettes. Such rosettes from unmodified spikes are polyvalent and therefore cause hemagglutination.",

The finding of a major protein of about 26 000 molecular weight, which was not associated with the nucleocapsid and was completely resistant to proteolytic digestion, suggested that this protein was associated with the viral membrane, and it has been referred to as the M, or membrane protein [22, 23, 82] . Several additional observations support the idea that the M protein is located in a shell beneath the lipid bilayer. The presence of a shell or layer surrounding the nucleocapsid of influenza virus is revealed in glutaraldehyde-fixed particles which have been treated with Nonidet P-40, which removes all of the phospholipid [83] . Iodination of influenza virus proteins using chtoranfine T oxidation, under certain conditions, results in labeling of the membrane protein more rapidly than the nucleocapsid protein, indicating that the membrane protein is external to the nucleocapsid [56] . The membrane proteins of two strains of influenza virus have been isolated and their amino acid compositions determined, but no unusual distribution was found [84] .",

In principle, a given viral polypeptide is associated with only one type of structural component. Thus separation of viral spikes, nucleocapsids, spikeless particles or isolated envelopes may yield isolated polypeptides, and in any event serves as a starting point for further subfractionation by other procedures. Viral polypeptides may be obtained directly from sodium dodecylsulfate-potyacrylamide gels, but biological activities are lost and removal of dodecylsulfate may present a problem. With some strains of influenza virus, it is possible to isolate the two surface components, hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, after dodecylsulfate treatment at room temperature, and retain biological activity [52] .

After dialysis against low ionic strength buffer, the non-glycosylated protein precipitates, leaving the glycoproteins in solution. The two glycoproteins can be separated by sedimentation on a sucrose gradient containing 1 M KCI and 1 ~,, Triton. A similar proceclure was used to separate the glycoproteins of NDV [77] and Triton treatment was also used to isolate the glycoprotein of VSV [86, 106] .

[60] have used a radioactive surface label, [35S]-formytmethionylsulfone methylphosphate, in an attempt to learn the detailed arrangement of lipids in the bitayer of SFV. This compound reacts with free amino groups at elevated pH and was claimed not to penetrate the red cell membrane [115] . Observations made with this reagent suggested to Bretscher [116, 117] that the red cell membrane bilayer is asymmetric, with the choline-containing phospholipids predominating in the outer monolayer, while phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine, which contain free amino groups, are concentrated in the inner monolayer. When intact SFV is labeled with this reagent, the relative distribution of labeling of three phospholipids which contain free amino groups is the same as that in the total viral lipid. However, the total amount of labeling of these three lipids is increased 8-fold after the virus is disrupted by non-ionic detergent. This could arise from preferential localization of the phospholipids containing free amino groups on the inner surface of the bilayer. Alternatively, it might arise from shielding of the lipid by the viral glycoprotein, or from some other difference in reactivity or accessibility of the phospholipids in the intact and disrupted states. It is likely that lipids, and particularly glycolipids, may be distributed asymmetrically between the inner and outer halves of the bilayer in vlrat membranes. However, existing data (Table V) do not support a model [116, 213] in which phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine are always located only in the inner half, and sphingomyelin and phosphatidylcholine in the outer half, of viral membranes. Such a model might be expected to require a molar ratio of amine-containing to choline-containing phospholipids of 1. Alternatively, it has been suggested that protein can substitute for some of the lipids of the inner monolayer, permitting a molar ratio of less than 1 [1t6,213]. However, the ratio of amine-containmg to choline-containing phospholipids in SV5 varies from 1.6:1 when grown m primary rhesus monkey kidney (MK) cells to 0.3:1 when grown in BHK21F cells [122] . It is important that these very different molar ratios occur in viral membranes which contain the same set of proteins [214] . The possibility that protein may replace part of the fipid in the bilayer therefore cannot compensate for these differences in phospholipid composition.",

Assuming that the stain ~s in fact selective for amine-containing phospholipids, this would suggest that these phospholipids are localized in the inner surface when they are present in relatively small amounts, but are present in both surfaces when they are present in larger amounts, such as in MK plasma membranes. It seems that the presence of large amounts of amine-containing phospholipids in the outer half of a membrane such as that of the MK cell, or the MK-grown virus, should be experimentally demonstrable.

A decrease in sphingomyelin synthesis and an increase in synthesis of the major glycolipid, globoside, was observed in SV5-infected MDBK cells [215, 216] .

This has been strikingly demonstrated in a study in which plasma membranes isolated from the same cell line by two different procedures were found to have significantly different lipid compositions [13] . Similarly, many virus preparations may not be pure by the chemical criteria required for meaningful comparisons of lipid composition. It has been reported that lipid composition of viruses can be altered by introducing fatty acids [122] , phospholipids [123] or steroids [124] into the growth medium. These exogenous lipids may be incorporated into some cellular lipid pool, or they may be intercalated directly into the existing viral or plasma membrane bilayer.

However, the viruses grown in the two cells had closely similar lipid contents, and it was suggested that the lipid composition reflected the lipid affinities of the viral proteins [127] . On the other hand, Heydrick et al. [128] reported that Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus had different lipids when grown m L cells as compared to the same virus grown in CEF. The lipid composition of SFV was found to be quite similar to the plasma membrane of the BHK21 cells in which it was grown, but to differ from whole cells or endoplasmic reticulum [129] . The virus contained much less free fatty acid and a little more cholesterol than the plasma membrane. The phospholipid composition of Uukuniemi virus grown in the same cells was virtually identical to that of Semliki Forest virus, suggesting that the plasma membrane composition rather than the lipid affinity of different viral proteins determined the viral lipid composition [130] . This argument was further elaborated by an analysis of the fatty acid chains in different phospholipid classes isolated from SFV, and plasma membranes and endoplasmic reticulum from BHK21 cells [131] . Each phospholipid class was found to contain a characteristic mixture of fatty acids which differed from that in all other classes. The fatty acids in each viral lipid class resembled that of its counterpart in both the host plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum [131 ] .",

In a thorough study, Klenk and Choppin [122.132.133] analysed the lipid composition of four different cell types, their plasma membranes and SV5 virus grown in each cell type. They found that the plasma membrane composition differed substantially from the whole cell. and that membranes from different cells differed from each other. The composition of the virus generally resembled that of its host cell plasma membrane fairly closely, although some differences in both phospholipid class and phospholipid fatty acid compositions were found. The authors concluded that \"in general, the virions acquire the lipid pattern of the host cell plasma membrane\" but that \"within narrow limits, some selective rearrangement of membrane lipids incorporated into virions is possible in some cells\" [122] . The neutral glycolipids characteristic of each cell type were incorporated into virions grown in that cell, while gangliosides were not, a finding which the authors attributed to the action of viral neuraminidase [134] . When VSV. a virus which lacks neuraminidase, was grown in the same cell type it contained the ganglioside found in the plasma membrane, thus supporting the concept that the viral tipids reflect the plasma membrane composition, and that the absence of gangtiosides in SV5 is due to the neuraminidase of the virus [17] .",

They observed that the proportion of neutral lipids was higher in the New Jersey serotype than in the Indiana serotype. A less pronounced difference was found when these serotypes were grown in CEF, and the difference was limited to neutral lipids other than cholesterol [13] . The lipid composition of both viruses resembled the host cell plasma membrane more closely than the whole host cell. The authors concluded that while the viral lipid composition \"primarily\" reflected its membrane site of maturation, there was some evidence that the viral proteins could influence the proportions of phospholipid and neutral lipid incorporated into the virus [13] . Klenk and Choppin [17] found that a single ganglioside was present in BHK21 cells, and was also found as the only ganglioside in VSV grown in these cells. This was supported by the finding that the host cell antigen of VSV grown in BHK21 cells was glycolipid in nature [137] . The finding that L cells synthesize desmosterol and not cholesterol provided the basis for a study of sterol incorporation into VSV by Bates and Rothblat [124] . These workers showed that L cells with different ratios of cholesterol to desmosterol could be prepared by adding cholesterol to the growth medium. Viral infectivity and growth was independent of this ratio, but VSV was found to contain a consistently higher cholesterol:desmosterol ratio than the host cells [124] . It was not determined whether the viral ratio was closer to that of the host plasma membrane. My.vorirus. Blough and co-workers [138] have reported differences in fatty acid composition of different strains of influenza virus grown in ovo. They have also observed different lipid composition in the same strain of influenza virus grown in eggs treated with vitamin A [139] or with branched chain fatty acids [140] . They interpret these results to indicate that lipid incorporation into the virus is directed by the viral protein.",

The major discrepancies between viral and membrane phospholipid composition appear to occur in cell systems derived from embryonated hen's eggs, which are clearly heterogeneous cell populations in which a small proportion of the cells may produce most of the virus. These differences have been emphasized by some workers and minimized by others, and are generally fairly limited in extent.

Such an effect might reduce the average mobility of one class of lipids relative to the others to some degree intermediate between freely diffusing lipid and that tightly bound to protein. Such interactions in the plasma membrane may act to make a population of lipids available to the viral proteins which is not accurately reflected by the total lipid composition of the membrane.",

Complete proteolytic removal of the glycoprotein spikes on influenza virus did not result in any detectable change in the viral bilayer as monitored by several spin label probes [111 ] .

Any appreciable space between the two structures (as has been suggested by Nermut [152] to occur in influenza virus based on the finding of an electroluminescent space between the unit membrane and the underlying structure) should result in a trough in the electron density profile just internal to the lipid polar region. Further, recent studies have demonstrated transfer of fluorescence from internal proteins of influenza virions to a fluorescent probe, 12-(9-anthroyl)stearic acid, incorporated into the lipid bilayer. Since the maximum distance over which fluorescence transfer can occur in this donor-acceptor system is about 39 A, this sets a maximum distance of approx. 11 A between aromatic residues of the internal viral proteins and the lipid bilayer [126] . Preliminary observations suggest that alterations ofbilayer structure affect the conformation of internal viral proteins, suggesting a very close relationship [126] .",

In one strain such structures were isolated, although they appeared in a sufficient variety of shapes and sizes as to suggest that their stability was marginal [I 54]. They could be prepared from another strain only after stabilization by cross-linking with glutaraldehyde [155] . The isolation of a stable core structure would require that protein-protein interaction between the M protein subunits are sufficient to hold the core together. The failure to isolate cores as stable structures implies that lipidprotein interactions play a larger role in stabilizing these particles. Each virus might have its own unique balance of protein-protein and protein-lipid interaction in stabilizing the shell of membrane protein. In cases where the protein-lipid interaction predominates, one might be more apt to find protein-directed selection of lipids from the membrane for incorporation into the viral bilayer.",

With most groups of viruses, the plasma membrane is the site of virus maturation, whereas with the herpes virus group the inner nuclear membrane serves as the maturation site, and maturation of VSV has been reported to occur on either the plasma membrane or intracellular membranes depending on the host cell type [157] . Detailed electron microscopic studies have been carried out on the process of maturation of a variety of viruses which form by budding, including togaviruses [I 58,159] , myxoviruses [80, 88] , paramyxoviruses [87, 161 ] , rhabdoviruses [157, 160] , RNA tumor viruses [162] and herpes viruses [163, 164] . The paramyxoviruses provide a system in which viral components, because of their relatively large size, are easily recognizable by electron microscopy. The helical nucleocapsids of paramyxoviruses are assembled free in the cytoplasmic matrix of the infected cell. The nucleocapsids then align in a regular arrangement under regions of the plasma membrane, and a layer of surface projections is present on the outer surface of such areas of membrane (Fig. 3) . Virion formation then occurs by a process of outfolding of such a region of modified membrane. During the process of budding, the emerging virus particle is seen to contain a unit membrane structure which is continuous with the unit membrane on the cell surface. The steps in the assembly of influenza virus appear to be generally similar, although the nucleocapsid is more difficult to visualize by electron microscopy [80, 88] .",

Specific adsorption of erythrocytes occurs to surfaces of cells infected with influenza and parainfluenza viruses, presumably to regions of membrane containing hemagglutinin polypeptides, yet no morphological change is detectable in regions of membrane showing such hemadsoriation [80, 165, 168] . Using ferritin-labeled antiviral antibody, it is also possible to demonstrate antigens of influenza and parainfluenza viruses in membranes of normal morphology [168, 169] . The antigens of parainfluenza viruses occur in discrete patches, as would be expected of a region of membrane containing entirely virus-coded polypeptides (Fig. 4) . The highly ordered arrangement of SV5 nucleocapsid beneath the cell membrane also suggests that the nucleoeapsid is aligning with specific components at the cell surface rather than associating with cell membranes at random. This is further indicated by the lack of association of nucleocapsid with intracellular membranes, and the fact that the large accumulations of nucleocapsids which frequently are found in paramyxovirus-infected cells occur free in the cytoplasmic matrix, rather than in association with cell membranes [87] .",

One of the primary questions regarding the process of viral assembly is the exact mechanism by which such patches of viral membrane are generated. Alternative modes of generating discrete patches of virusspecific components are depicted in Fig. 5 .

These glycoproteins bind to membranes during or after their synthesis and become glycosylated in association with membranes [172] . Herpes virus glycoproteins were not detected free in the cytoplasm [172] . Wagner et al. [1731 found the glycoprotein and non-glycosylated membrane protein of VSV to be associated with various cytoplasmic membrane classes. Smooth cytoplasmic membranes from influenza virus-infected cells contained large amounts of the viral glycoproteins as well as a detectable peak of the non-glycosylated membrane polypeptide [174] [175] [176] . Rough endoplasmic reticulum fractions also contained the hemagglutinin polypeptide, and the results of pulse-chase experiments suggested that this glycoprotein migrates from rough to smooth membranes [174, 176] . Virtually all of the hemagglutinin polypeptide is membrane associated, rather than free in the cytoplasm [96.174-177] . The envelope gtycoproteins of Sindbis virus are also associated with a membranecontaining cell fraction [178] .",

It is clear that the synthesis of complex carbohydrate occurs by stepwise attachment of individual monosaccharides by specific transferases.

Residues most proximal to the polypeptide chain, including glucosamine, appear to be attached to polypeptides in rough endoplasmic reticulum [184, 185] .

By labeling influenza virus-infected cells with glucosamine, it was found that hemagglutinin polypeptides in both rough and smooth cytoplasmic membrane fractions were labeled [ [87] . In contrast, fucose labeled the hemagglutinin polypeptides in smooth membranes, but not in rough membranes. Stanley et al. [175] observed that fucose continued to be incorporated into the hemagglutinin polypeptide for 10-15 rain after inhibition of protein synthesis by puromycin, whereas incorporation of glucosamine ceased rapidly, in pulse-chase experiments, the bulk of the HA polypeptide was found in rough membranes after a short pulse [174, 176] , but the amount in smooth membranes increased after chases [174 176] . These results all suggest that the HA polypeptide may be synthesized in association with rough endoplasmic reticulum, where glycosylation is initiated, but that glycosyl residues nearer to the distal termini of side chains are incorporated after the HA polypeptide has migrated to the smooth cytoplasmic membranes. The finding of a qualitative differ-ence in carbohydrate content of HA polypeptides in smooth and rough cytoplasmic membranes supports the view that the components in rough membranes are precursors of the smooth membrane-associated polypeptides, and that both may represent essential stages in the process by which completed HA polypeptides arrive at the cell surface.",

Consequently, there is no reason to assume, a priori, that the viral envelope is characterized by symmetrical constraints. The characterization of phenotypically mixed viral particles containing the internal proteins of VSV and the glycoprotein spikes of SV5 [218, 219] also argues against the existence of the specific interactions which are required to generate a symmetrical structure.",

This characteristically high diffusion implies that there is no a priori reason for long-range order to exist in a biological membrane. If such order does exist, then specific factors must be found to account for it [203] . As has been documented in Section IV, the lipids of enveloped viruses are arranged in a bitayer, and their composition bears a close resemblance to that of cellular membranes. There is thus no reason to suppose that the lipid phase provides a rigid matrix to hold the viral proteins in some regular array, at least at physiological temperature and conditions of hydration. Rather, a bilayer of this composition would be expected to provide a fluid matrix such as is present in the host cell plasma membrane, and such fluidity is demonstrated by spin-label studies [111,113.114] . The logical conclusion from these considerations is that viral envelopes should resemble biological membranes in their structural characteristics far more closely than they resemble the small crystallizable viruses.",

            "text": "The general structural organization of the influenza virus envelope proposed in 1969 by Laver and Valentine [52] corresponds in many respects to the fluid mosaic model subsequently proposed for the arrangement of lipids and proteins in biological membranes, a model which is supported by much recent experimental evidence [203] . The subsequent studies which have been reviewed in this article have confirmed that there are indeed many similarities between the organization of viral membranes and other membranes. Structural asymmetry, with all carbohydrate-containing components located on the external surface, is a characteristic of both viral membranes and cellular surface membranes such as the erythrocyte ghost. A lipid matrix which interacts with amphipathic globular proteins is the basic structure proposed in the fluid mosaic model, and is clearly the most likely arrangement for spike interaction with the lipid bilayer. The degree of penetration of viral spike proteins into the bilayer appears to be more limited than that of some cellular proteins. One indication of this difference is the presence of particles seen by freeze-fracture electron microscopy in cellular membranes, which are thought to be proteins deeply penetrating the lipid phase. Such particles are not found in similar studies of viral membranes [39, 88] , indicating that viral proteins do not penetrate the membrane to this extent. However, it is possible that various cellular proteins may also be bound to the membrane in a manner similar to that of viral spikes. To cite just a single specific example. the glycocalyx of the intestinal brush border is a glycoprotein coat, often visualized as knobs, which can be removed by suitable treatment with proteases [204, 205] or non-ionic detergents [206] , conditions strongly remintscent of those which are effective in removing the viral glycoprotein spikes.",

It is possible that other membranes may also possess such a double matrix structure, at least in specialized regions. By a protein matrix, we mean a large two-dimensional aggregate stabilized by protein-protein interaction. Two specific candidates for such an organization in cellular membranes are the large two-dimensional aggregates of intramembranous particles observed in gap junctions [207] , and the protein termed spectrin which is associated with the inner surface of the erythrocyte membrane [208] . The fluidity of the lipid phase of viral membranes, as demonstrated by spin-label studies, is similar to that observed in other membranes [lll] . However, at least some of the proteins associated with cellular membranes are able to undergo lateral diffusion in the plane of the membrane [209] , whereas such lateral diffusion must be restricted in the case of viral proteins incorporated into cellular plasma membranes. The main indication that such diffusion is restricted is the specific exclusion of cellular proteins from the viral envelope. The mechanism by which such lateral diffusion of viral proteins could be restricted is not clear, and could involve protein-protein interaction or lipid-mediated interactions. It is possible that some cellular membrane proteins are likewise restricted in lateral diffusion by similar mechanisms.",

In many instances the viral RNA does not appear to be the messenger for protein synthesis, but molecules complementary to the genome serve as messenger RNA. Furthermore, the synthesis of progeny genomic RNA may either occur on an RNA or DNA template. Viruses in which messenger RNA is complementary to virion RNA contain a polymerase in the virion, which catalyses the synthesis of the complementary RNA. RNA viruses which replicate through a DNA intermediate contain an enzymatic activity in the virion which catalyses the synthesis of DNA which is complementary to viral RNA.",
