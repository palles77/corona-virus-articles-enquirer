Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) is a rapid and reliable identification method in bacterial diagnostics, but has not been used in virological diagnostics. Mass spectrometry systems have been investigated for the identification of respiratory viruses. However, sample preparation methods were laborious and time-consuming. In this study, a reliable and rapid sample preparation method was developed allowing identification of cultured respiratory viruses. Tenfold serial dilutions of ten cultures influenza A strains, mixed samples of influenza A virus with human metapneumovirus or respiratory syncytial virus, and reconstituted clinical samples were treated with the developed sample preparation method. Subsequently, peptides were subjected to MALDI-TOF MS and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The influenza A strains were identified to the subtype level within 3 h with MALDI-TOF MS and 6 h with LC-MS/MS, excluding the culturing time. The sensitivity of LC-MS/MS was higher compared to MALDI-TOF MS. In addition, LC-MS/MS was able to discriminate between two viruses in mixed samples and was able to identify virus from reconstituted clinical samples. The development of an improved and rapid sample preparation method allowed generic and rapid identification of cultured respiratory viruses by mass spectrometry.",

Approximately 200 million cases of viral community-acquired pneumonia occur every year: 100 million in children and 100 million in adults (Ruuskanen et al., 2011) . A wide range of viruses, including current circulating subtypes of influenza A virus (influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 and influenza A H3N2), influenza B virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses, adenovirus, and rhinovirus, have been implicated in respiratory tract infections in past decades. In the last ten years, new viruses have emerged as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), avian influenza A (H5N1) virus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1, and human bocavirus. Rapid identification of existing and emerging respiratory viruses is of the utmost importance in combating outbreaks and epidemics, and starting early therapy and prophylaxis. Currently, cell culture, serology, and real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) are used in virological diagnostics. However, there are a few drawbacks with these techniques: (i) serology and rRT-PCR-based assays are target directed and thus potentially miss non-selected or emerging pathogenic viruses (Binnicker et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2014) ; (ii) culturing is time consuming; (iii) serology-based assays are not applicable in the acute phase and/or have low sensitivity. Furthermore, multiple tests are needed to detect and subtype mixed infections.",

Thus far, mass spectrometrybased methods have not been used for virological diagnostics. However, it has been shown that purified influenza virus particles could be identified with either MALDI-TOF MS or MALDI Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance MS (MALDI-FT-ICR MS). Identification was based on the proteolytic digestion of concentrated and purified viral samples and on mass spectrometry analysis of the specific peptide mass profile. The sample preparation methods used in these studies included virus concentration and/or purification with either ultracentrifugation, differential centrifugation, precipitation, filtration, isolation of viral particles or protein(s) with an affinity capture immunoassay or gel electrophoresis (Downard et al., 2009; Schwahn et al., 2009a Schwahn et al., ,b, 2010a Chou et al., 2011; Jang et al., 2011; Nguyen and Downard, 2013; Fernandes and Downard, 2014) . These sample preparation procedures were laborious and often time consuming (up to 24 h) and are therefore not applicable for high-throughput virological diagnostics.",

Subsequently, obtained peptides were subjected to MALDI-TOF MS and LC-MS/MS for analyses. The identification of the respiratory viruses was based on peptide sequence differences in abundant viral proteins. To confirm correct identification of peptides by mass spectrometry, the amino acid sequences were compared to the corresponding DNA sequences, obtained by sequencing of the viruses.

Tenfold serial dilutions for all of the strains (influenza A virus, RSV, and hMPV) were prepared in CyMol medium (Copan Italia, Brescia, Italy). CyMol is a collection, transport, and preservation medium for cells (cytology analysis), viruses, and nucleic acids (PCR-based assays) (Luinstra et al., 2011a) . Subsequently, 200 l of each tenfold dilution step was treated according to the in-house developed sample pretreatment protocol, as follows.

Next, DL-dithiothreitol (DTT, Sigma-Aldrich) and acetonitrile (LC-MS Chromasolv, Sigma-Aldrich) were added to 5 mM and to 25% final concentration, respectively.

            "text": "The accurate and rapid identification of influenza and other respiratory viruses is important in combating outbreaks and epidemics, detecting newly emerging viruses, and initiating prophylaxis and early therapy. Antigen-detection and rRT-PCR tests are used most frequently for the detection of viruses in the acute phase. PCR-based methods can yield results within 3-8 h with high sensitivity and specificity (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Guidance for Clinicians on the Use of rRT-PCR and Other Molecular Assays for Diagnosis of Influenza Virus Infection, 2013), whereas the rapid antigen-detection tests can even yield results within 15 min. However, both methods feature drawbacks. (i) They are target-directed and can potentially miss non-selected or emerging pathogenic viruses that are not covered by the PCR primer sets and antibodies used in the antigen-detection assays. For instance, it was shown that a new type of human papillomavirus (HPV) was not detected by a broad HPV-primer PCR system (Johansson et al., 2013) and newly emerging mutations in the conserved region of M1 prevented rRT-PCR detection of influenza A H1N1 and H3N2 from clinical specimens (Binnicker et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2014) . (ii) Multiple tests (different PCRs or PCR followed by sequencing) are needed for (sub)typing and for detection of mixed infections. (iii) The sensitivity of rapid antigen-detection tests is low. The commonly used Rapid Influenza Diagnostic Test (RIDT), although fast, lacks accuracy and sensitivity (40-70%), resulting in a high percentage of false-negative results (Beck et al., 2012) . Theoretically, mass spectrometry-based systems could overcome these drawbacks and they were already investigated for the identification of respiratory viruses. However, until now the used sample preparation methods were too laborious and time-consuming for mass spectrometry to be an identification method of clinical potential. Therefore, in this study a rapid, generic and robust sample preparation method for mass spectrometry-based virus identification was developed. Subsequently, the sensitivity of the combined procedure of this sample preparation and mass spectrometry analysis was determined.",

In these studies, the same nucleoprotein-derived peptides were found among the identified viral peptides as detected here (Schwahn et al., 2009a,b; Li et al., 2014) , which indicates that with the in-house developed sample preparation method, comparable results could be achieved in a much shorter time. Furthermore, in the developed sample preparation method, prior purification or extended concentration of cultured viruses, for example by applying ultracentrifugation, is not required for the identification of viral proteins in the presence of other viral or non-viral proteins. The sample preparation time was significantly reduced to approximately 1.5 h by the introduction of REDS for rapid reduction, alkylation, precipitation, and trypsin digestion. The tenfold serial dilutions of cultured viruses were prepared in CyMol, a collection, transport and preservation medium known for its compatibility with multiple diagnostic platforms including cytology and molecular diagnostics (Luinstra et al., 2011) .

            "text": "Besides monocultures of influenza A strains, mixed samples of influenza A virus with either hMPV or RSV were subjected to MALDI-TOF MS and LC-MS/MS. Viruses were identified simultaneously and specifically by LC-MS/MS (Table 5) , with a detection limit of 5.3 \u00d7 10 7 for influenza A (H1N1 and H3N2), 3.6 \u00d7 10 7 for RSV, and 1.1 \u00d7 10 7 genome copies for hMPV. Identification was not possible by MALDI-TOF MS due to its low sensitivity. In addition to monocultures and mixed samples, throat swabs spiked with influenza A, hMPV or RSV were subjected to LC-MS/MS. All the spiked viruses were identified, with detection limits of 10 7 , 10 8 , and 10 7 genome copies for influenza A H3N2, influenza A H1N1 and RSV, and hMPV, respectively. These results demonstrate that LC-MS/MS is not only able to identify monocultures of viruses, but can also discriminate between two viruses in the same sample and can identify a virus from a sample containing human proteins originating from a throat swab. Sensitivity of LC-MS/MS appeared to be lower when mixed samples or reconstituted samples were tested. Viral loads in clinical samples vary depending on the type of respiratory material, subtype of the virus, severity and phase of infection, and host factors, such as immunity. In general, viral loads fall within the range of 10 4 -10 6 genome copies/ml (Ngaosuwankul et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2011) . In addition, in a recent pan-European survey (Nuttall et al., 2011) , the average CT values for influenza virus, RSV, and hMPV detected in patients were 29, 29, and 30, respectively (Coenjaerts, F.E.J., personal communication). Therefore, the ultimate identification limit of a mass spectrometry method should reach 10 4 genome copies/ml for direct clinical application. The sensitivity of the developed sample preparation method in combination with LC-MS/MS is 100-fold lower and therefore not good enough for direct application in virological diagnostics. For detection of viruses from clinical samples, viral culture is needed before samples can be prepared and analyzed. Because culturing is required, viable virus has to be recovered and successfully grown. For application in virological diagnostics, sensitivity should be increased by developing techniques that enable fast and efficient virus concentration and purification from respiratory samples. Furthermore, mass spectrometry systems should be improved to increase sensitivity. In the meanwhile, keeping the drawbacks into mind this in-house developed sample preparation method in combination with LC-MS/MS could be experimentally used for patients with suspicion of a respiratory infection where routine diagnostics are negative.",

All these identified peptides were found to be encoded in the corresponding genome sequences. MALDI-TOF MS and LC-MS/MS both detected nucleoprotein-derived peptides. In addition, LC-MS/MSidentified peptides derived from other viral proteins, namely M1, NS1, HA, and NA proteins of influenza viruses and M, M2-1, P, and F proteins of RSV and hMPV. The identification of peptides from different proteins not only accomplishes identification but also potentially delivers information about virulence, resistance to antiviral medications, and/or transmission efficiency. For instance, an amino acid substitution in nucleoprotein (M136L) was shown to enhance human-to-human transmission (Zhou et al., 1999) . Interestingly, one of the identified nucleoprotein-derived peptides, i.e., QANNGEDATAGLTHIMIWHSNLNDATYQR, contained this substitution. This peptide was found in all of the tested influenza strains ( Table 4 ), suggesting that these strains might exhibit increased human-to-human transmission efficiency.",

However, used sample preparation methods were laborious and time-consuming. The developed sample preparation method in combination with LC-MS/MS allowed rapid and reliable identification of cultured respiratory viruses and viruses spiked in throat swabs. To introduce this LC-MS/MS based identification method in virological diagnostics, sensitivity must be improved up to 100-fold and clinical samples have to be tested. The combination of an improved mass spectrometry technique and/or clinical sample preparation method allowing direct identification of viruses from clinical samples will be an important new diagnostic tool in clinical virology.",
