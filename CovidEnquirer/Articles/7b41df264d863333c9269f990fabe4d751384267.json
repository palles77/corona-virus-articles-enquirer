Study design: 878 stool specimens from children with acute gastroenteritis and 112 from control children were tested by RT-PCR to detect HCoV groups 1B, 2A and SARS. HCoVs were typed by sequencing all PCR positive samples. Results: Twenty-two (2.5%) of the 878 stool specimens of children with acute gastroenteritis were positive for HCoVs. The following HCoV types were detected: OC43 (10 cases, 45.5%), HKU1 (6 cases, 27.3%), 229E (2 cases, 9.1%) and NL63 (4 cases, 18.2%). In 4 of the cases a HCoV was the only detected virus; in the remaining cases rotavirus or norovirus was found in the same sample. In control groups there were two HCoV positive samples of 112 tested. Conclusions: This study shows that all known non-SARS HCoVs can be found in stools of children with acute gastroenteritis. On the basis of this study, the significance of coronaviruses as gastrointestinal pathogens in children appears minor, since most of the coronavirus findings were co-infections with known gastroenteritis viruses.",

            "text": "The first human coronaviruses (HCoVs) 229E and OC43 were identified in the 1960s. [1] [2] [3] [4] These viruses are common causes of upper respiratory tract infections 5, 6 but also have association with lower respiratory tract disease especially in patients with underlying disease. [7] [8] [9] Coronavirus-like particles have also been seen by electron microscope (EM) in stool samples of both diarrheic and healthy patients evoking discussion about human enteric coronaviruses. 10 The clinical significance of these findings has been unclear and there are findings showing that such putative enteric coronaviruses are antigenically unrelated to OC43 and 229E viruses. 11 In 2003 interest towards coronaviruses increased when a new coronavirus was found to be a causative agent of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome). [12] [13] [14] SARS-HCoV caused a serious lower respiratory tract infection with high mortality. [15] [16] [17] The main symptoms were fever, chills, myalgia, cough and headache, but also diarrhea was common and in one study registered in 38.4% of patients. In the same study SARS-HCoV was also isolated from intestinal tissue and viral RNA was found in 16% of stool samples, which was comparable to the detection rate in nasopharyngeal aspirates. 18 In another cohort of patients diarrhea was seen in 73% of patients and viral RNA was detected in 97% of stool specimens. In this cohort it was suggested that the outbreak was caused by faulty sewage system whereby the transmission might been fecal-oral rather than respiratory. 19 No association between the presence of diarrhea and mortality in SARS cases has been observed, however. 20 A fourth human coronavirus, HCoV-NL63, was identified in 2004 in the Netherlands. It was isolated from a 7-month-old child suffering from bronchiolitis and conjunctivitis, and was categorized to be a new group 1 coronavirus. 21 Soon after, another group in the Netherlands independently detected the same virus in an 8-month-old child with pneumonia. 22 Since the discovery, NL63 has been detected in patients with respiratory tract infection in several countries around the world, including Canada, Australia, Korea and France. [23] [24] [25] [26] NL63 has been associated with severe lower respiratory tract infection and croup. 24, 27 The seroprevalence in 6-12-month-old children for NL63 is 28.6-40.0%. 28 Less than a year later a second new coronavirus, HCoV-HKU1, was discovered in Hong Kong. This group 2 coronavirus was detected in a 71-year-old man with pneumonia. 29 HKU1 has been found globally [30] [31] [32] [33] and in addition to respiratory samples it has been detected in stools, but no clear connection to enteric disease has been found. 34 ",

Healthy children (N = 36), children with indeterminate fever and vomiting (N = 43), and children with respiratory tract infection (N = 33) were used as control groups. Also group A rotavirus, calicivirus (including norovirus genogroups I and II, and sapovirus), aichivirus and human bocavirus were studied from the same material. Adenovirus was not tested systematically but of 101 samples tested 13 were positive for adenovirus (six belonging to subgroup F, types 40 and 41) and none of these were co-infections with coronaviruses including two positive samples for coronavirus. A total of 878 samples from children with acute gastroenteritis, 43 samples from children with indeterminate fever and vomiting, 33 samples from children with respiratory tract infection and 36 samples from healthy children were tested for HCoVs.",

Most of the coronavirus findings were co-infections with well known enteric pathogens, norovirus and rotavirus. Furthermore, half of the patients with coronavirus in stools had symptoms related to respiratory tract infection and, therefore, HCoVs found in the stools could have originated from respiratory tract. Unfortunately, no specimens from respiratory tract were collected to confirm the presence of coronaviruses in the respiratory tract in these patients, and further studies are needed to evaluate simultaneous presence of HCoV in stools and respiratory tract. Even if coronaviruses were found in respiratory tract in cases of acute gastroenteritis it would be difficult to determine whether they were primarily causing the respiratory or gastrointestinal symptom.",

PCR program was run as follows: 2 min at 94 \u2022 C, 35 cycles of amplification (30 s at 94 \u2022 C, 30 s at 54 \u2022 C, 1 min at 72 \u2022 C) and final extension at 72 \u2022 C for 5 min.
