This study provides an initial analysis among epidemiologic characteristics 145 and two typical transmission phenomena of COVID-19. Most index cases were 146 exposed to Wuhan or confirmed cases related to Wuhan, but it is also necessary to In addition to the evidence of the human-to-human transmission, it is likely 153 that there exists infectiousness to some extend during the incubation period, and the 154 presence of \"super-spreaders\". The median incubation period was 8.2 days (95% CI: 155 7.9 -9.5) in our study, which is longer than a recent report of 425 patients (8.2 days 156 vs. 5.2 days), this may be a results of recall bias, during epidemiological investigation, symptoms does not yet infect others, which assumes that all index cases should show 165 symptoms before their secondary cases. However, as the investigation went on, 166 Guizhou CDC found that there existed index cases who showed symptoms after that 167 of their secondary cases.
