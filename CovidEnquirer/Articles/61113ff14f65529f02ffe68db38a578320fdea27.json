RUFO y *Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati and y Children's Hospital Boston acute diarrhea A diarrheal illness of less than 14 days duration. Acute diarrheal disease in children is most often the result of self-limited viral infections. Management includes prompt assessment and repletion of hydration status. Evaluation for an etiologic process is generally not warranted unless there is an associated \u00aending such as blood in the stool or systemic symptoms. chronic diarrhea A diarrheal illness of greater than 14 days duration. Chronic diarrhea in children can be due to either infectious or noninfectious processes. Evaluation for a speci\u00aec etiology is indicated. Management of comorbid conditions such as poor growth or malnutrition is essential. colitis Any in\u00afammatory process affecting the colon. Colitis usually presents clinically as bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and tenesmus. congenital diarrhea A group of diarrheal illnesses that are present from birth. Congenital diarrhea can be the result of either a speci\u00aec genetic defect in a secretory or absorptive pathway or abnormal intestinal development. gastroenteritis A diarrheal process that affects the upper gastrointestinal tract and presents most typically as an acute watery diarrhea. Gastroenteritis usually denotes an acute diarrhea that is infectious and self-limiting. hemolytic uremic syndrome A sequela of Escherichia coli O157:H7 colitis. This toxin-mediated microangiopathy results in a triad of hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and renal failure. The occurrence of the syndrome is generally limited to children under 10 years of age. in\u00afammatory diarrhea A diarrheal illness in which the predominant pathologic \u00aending is an invasion of the intestinal epithelium by immunocytes. This type of diarrhea can be the result of either a normal immune response to an abnormal environment, as in infection, or an abnormal immune response to a normal environment, as in in\u00afammatory bowel disease. IPEX syndrome (immunodysregulation, polyendocrinopathy, and enteropathy: X-linked) An inherited X-linked syndrome that results from a mutation in the FOXP3 gene in humans. It is characterized by autoimmune enteropathy and multiple endocrinological abnormalities including diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, and hemolytic anemia. osmotic diarrhea A diarrheal illness that is driven by osmotic forces that promote a net\u00afux of water out of the interstitium and into the intestinal lumen. A stool sodium level of mEq/liter and an osmotic gap of greater than 100 mosm/liter suggest an osmotic diarrhea. secretory diarrhea A diarrheal illness that is driven by the active secretion of salt and water by intestinal epithelial cells. A stool sodium level of 470 mEq/liter, an osmotic gap of less than 100 mosm/liter, and a failure of the diarrhea to respond to a controlled fast suggest a secretory diarrhea.",

The prevalence of diarrheal illness across cultures is inversely proportional to the availability of public sanitation, clean water supply, and adequate medical care. As such, it is not surprising that the incidence of diarrheal disease is much higher in developing societies and can approach 10 episodes per child per year in children under 5 years of age. In these areas, aggregate mortality can reach 3 to 5 million deaths per year. In the United States and other developed nations, both the incidence (1\u00c02 episodes per year) and mortality (approximately 400\u00c0500 deaths annually) are considerably decreased. Nonetheless, the burdens placed on Western health care systems by pediatric diarrheal disease are considerable and approximately 20% of all pediatric ambulatory visits and 10% of all inpatient hospital admissions in children under 3 years of age are for the evaluation and treatment of these disorders and their complications.",

These con\u00aficting responsibilities include the maintenance of a tight barrier against potentially virulent bacterial and viral pathogens in the intestinal lumen, while at the same time presenting a selectively permeable interface through which to carry out immune surveillance and nutrient absorption. In this context, intestinal\u00afuid secretion can serve both defensive (\u00afushing away pathogens and toxins) and homeostatic (maintenance of mucosal hydration necessary to facilitate enzymatic digestion) purposes. Stool output in humans is a composite of ingested, secreted, and absorbed\u00afuid intermixed with residual dietary matter and cellular debris. Adults typically ingest approximately 2 liters of\u00afuid per day and produce an additional 9 liters in the form of salivary, gastric, small intestinal, and pancreato-biliary secretions, to complete the process of digestion. The small intestine and colon have evolved highly ef\u00aecient intercellular and transcellular pathways for the reabsorption of the vast majority (approximately 99%) of this intestinal\u00afuid, and the average adult will pass only approximately 200 g of stool per day. This balance between\u00afuid secretion and absorption is therefore quite tight. Any microbiologic, dietary, pharmacologic, or hormonal input that affects cell membrane transporters and/or the intercellular tight junctions responsible for\u00afuid absorption can tip this net\u00afuid balance in favor of secretion (or reduced absorption) and thereby trigger the increased stool output observed in patients with diarrheal illnesses.",

In contrast, agonists utilizing Ca 2 as a second messenger activate the apical membrane Cl \u00c0 conductance CaCC in concert with the basolateral membrane K channel IK1 (KCNN4).

The accumulation of absorbed Na ions in the tissue interstitium favors the subsequent movement of Cl \u00c0 ions and water molecules out of the intestinal lumen via transcellular and paracellular pathways, thereby effecting salt and water uptake. Na channels have been identi\u00aeed in the apical membrane of gut epithelium. By acting in a coupled fashion with basolateral membrane Na /K -ATPase pumps, these channels permit lumenal Na ions to move down their electrochemical gradient and into the cell. The favorable Na gradient established by Na /K pumps has also been exploited by the small intestine to promote nutrient absorption. SGLT1 is the Na -coupled glucose transporter expressed along the apical membrane of enterocytes. Similarly, Na uptake in the small intestine is effected through Na -coupled amino acid transporters that are present along the enterocyte brush border. Finally, the Na /H exchanger NHE-3, expressed in the apical membrane of enterocytes, appears to mediate electroneutral Na transport in the intestine. The tasks of intestinal\u00afuid secretion and absorption are separated spatially along the length of the crypt\u00c0villus axis through a segregation of relevant plasma membrane channels and transporters. Cells newly differentiated at the crypt base display a primarily secretory phenotype and express high levels of CFTR. As these cells mature and migrate up the axis to take up more villous positions, they express increasing numbers of absorptive proteins including NHE-3 and Na -coupled glucose and amino acid transporters. Stool output is therefore the net product of intestinal\u00afuid secretion originating in crypt cells (which occupy approximately one-third of the crypt\u00c0villus axis) and\u00afuid absorption from villus cells (which take up the remaining two-thirds of the crypt\u00c0villus axis). Any disorder damaging surface villi, and thereby decreasing the villus/crypt ratio, will selectively decrease mucosal absorptive potential and cause increased stool output. This explains the increased stool output observed in patients with celiac disease, postviral syndromes, and giardiasis.",

Poor growth and malnutrition can also become a factor in children when diarrhea is chronic in nature. During infancy and early childhood, a large proportion of caloric intake is devoted to growth.

All children exposed to rotavirus, regardless of whether or not they manifest symptomatic diarrhea, will develop circulating antibodies to this pathogen. The decreasing incidence of rotavirus in adults is thought to be due to the protective effect of these antibodies. Rotaviruses are small, wheel-shaped viruses approximately 70 nm in diameter. Of the four major groups (A, B, C, and D), type A viruses are the most important in children. The virus invades the epithelium and promotes an in\u00afammatory response that ultimately contributes to the destruction of the villous surface. However, the frequency and severity of stool output in these patients does not correlate closely with the degree of intestinal damage observed endoscopically or histologically. This has led to the speculation that there are other pathogenic mechanisms that contribute to the malabsorption and net uid losses observed in these patients.

This group of viruses presents in a similar fashion to rotavirus, with the exception that the diarrhea is usually milder. Astroviruses are similar to calciviruses and are a common cause of diarrheal illness. Adenovirus (serotypes 40 and 41) is a well-established cause of viral diarrhea and has a slightly longer incubation period and a longer course than rotaviral disease. More recently, Torovirus has been implicated as a potential cause of diarrhea in children. However, more de\u00aenitive epidemiologic data concerning this pathogen are currently lacking. Bacterial infections can also cause diarrheal disease in infants and children (Table I, part B) . As in the case of viral diarrhea, the onset of bacterial illness is usually acute and presents with fever and sometimes vomiting. Because the most common forms of bacterial diarrhea are invasive, bloody diarrhea is often reported in these patients. Speci\u00aec types of bacterial illness have been reported to occur more commonly in speci\u00aec age groups. Campylobacter jejuni, for instance, has a bimodal distribution of onset with the \u00aerst peak occurring in children from 1 to 5 years old and a second peak in adolescents. Nontyphoid Salmonella enteritidis can cause a bacteremia in infants and in immunocompromised hosts. Shigella species can be found in the toddler age group, but is not a commonly isolated pathogen in the United States. Clostridium dif\u00aecile, an important cause of antibiotic-associated diarrhea in adults, is not usually a pathogen in infants. C. dif\u00aecile toxin can be found in up to 10% of healthy newborns and is even more prevalent in neonatal intensive care units. The reason for the inability of this organism to cause diarrhea in infants remains unclear. Based on animal studies, it is thought that the receptor for this toxin is developmentally regulated and absent in early infancy. Vibrio cholerae causes a prototypical bacterial secretory diarrhea. It produces a toxin composed of two subunits. The B, or binding, subunit displays a pentameric form that binds selectively to the ganglioside GM 1 . The A, or active, subunit is internalized by intestinal epithelia, alters signal transduction, and leads to increased production of cAMP and Cl \u00c0 secretion. Other forms of toxin-producing organisms include enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli, the pathogen responsible for traveler's diarrhea, and organisms responsible for acute food poisoning such as Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus. E. coli O157:H7 is an important pathogen in children. This enteropathic E. coli adheres to the intestinal lumen and produces a toxin that is absorbed and causes the hemolytic\u00c0uremic syndrome.",

The gene defect is thought to lie within the FOXP3 gene and it has been shown to encode the protein scur\u00aen, a regulator of T-cell function in mice. The important role played by lymphocytes in maintaining intestinal barrier function can be appreciated in the context of bone-marrow transplant recipients. Diarrhea is a major feature of graftversus-host disease, a clinical condition in which donor lymphocytes recognize host intestinal epithelial cells as being foreign. Activated immunocytes subsequently initiate a destructive process that is manifest histologically as increased epithelial cell apoptosis and clinically as a secretory or in\u00afammatory diarrhea.",

These diarrheal illnesses can be broadly categorized into congenital or acquired forms (Table I , part E). Congenital diarrheas are most often the result of abnormal gene expression, resulting in a clinical presentation within the \u00aerst week of life. Congenital chloride diarrhea is caused by a mutation in the Down-Regulated in Adenoma (DRA) gene, thought to be a colonic chloride transporter. This disease presents uniformly in utero with polyhydramnios. Severe diarrhea and abdominal distension appear shortly after birth and profound electrolyte disturbances can occur in these patients if not resuscitated promptly. In contrast, the cause of congenital sodium diarrhea is not known but is thought to be due to a functional uncoupling of sodium and hydrogen exchange in the intestine. No mutations have been described in the known Na /H exchangers in the intestine to date. The clinical presentation of congenital sodium diarrhea is similar to congenital chloride diarrhea with the exception that stool chloride levels in these patients are typically lower and the stool pH tends to be more alkaline. In addition to defects in ion transporters, there have been a number of diseases that have been described with altered transport of glucose, galactose, and amino acids. Gastrointestinal symptoms vary from defect to defect. Amino acid transport defects often have extraintestinal manifestations whose consequences far outweigh changes in bowel patterns.",

The most common example of this is toddler's diarrhea or chronic nonspeci\u00aec diarrhea of childhood.

As such, the diarrhea will resolve in most patients within a few days after removal of the offending juice.

The presence of``neutral'' fat in the stool suggests some de\u00aeciency in the production or delivery of pancreatic (lipase) or hepatic (bile acid) secretions into the intestinal lumen. An increase in``split'' fat in the stool indicates a primary inability of enterocytes to perform fat absorption. Reducing substances are the result of undigested carbohydrates making their way into the large intestine. The presence of these fecal sugars can be readily assessed with commercially available colorimetric strips or test solutions. It must be remembered that sucrose is a nonreducing sugar. As such, stool must \u00aerst be pretreated with an acid solution to make this nonreducing sugar detectable. Undigested carbohydrates, as well as dietary \u00aeber, are consumed by bacteria in the large bowel and generate short-chain fatty acids.

When oral intake is limited secondary to an altered mental status or when severe dehydration or shock is present, intravenous replacement of\u00afuid and electrolytes can be lifesaving. Once the patient is adequately hydrated, the diet may be readily advanced. The provision of adequate calories is critical to maintain an anabolic state that will provide the metabolic fuel necessary to promote epithelial restitution. The advantages of enteral supplementation should not be overlooked as lumenal contents have been shown to be trophic to the intestinal epithelium. A transient lactose intolerance may occur in either acute or chronic diarrhea. This can be addressed using soy, rice-based, or lactose-free milk products. High-fructose and sorbitol-containing drinks are palatable, but should be avoided due to the increased osmotic load they place on an already compromised epithelial lining. Other supportive measures that have been used include antisecretory agents, anti-motility agents, and resin binders. These agents decrease overall stool output by slowing intestinal transit. Although clinically bene\u00aecial in most cases, clinicians must be wary of the possibility that these agents can contribute to third-spacing of bod\u0233 uid in distended and pharmacologically atonic intestinal loops.",
