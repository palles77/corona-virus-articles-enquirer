The purpose was to elucidate the pathogenicity and viral distribution in PEDVinfected piglets over a period of 60 h, by morphometric analysis, in-situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry. At 24-60 h post-inoculation (hpi), the villous height/crypt depth (VH/CD) ratio of infected pigs was significantly less than that of control pigs. Positive cells typically exhibited a dark black reaction product (in-situ hybridization) or brown reaction product (immunohistochemistry) in the cytoplasm, without background staining. PEDV nucleic acid and antigen were detected in the duodenum, jejunum and ileum of experimentally infected pigs. The results suggested that the Korean strain was virulent and caused severe villous atrophy in the small intestine. q",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED) virus (PEDV) is an enveloped RNA virus with a single-stranded positive-sense genome. It belongs to the family Coronaviridae which, together with the Arteriviridae family, constitutes the order Nidovirales (Cavanagh, 1997) . PEDV mainly affects unweaned piglets but occasionally older animals. Piglets up to 7 days old often vomit and develop a severe watery fetid diarrhoea that leads to dehydration, rapid weight loss, and death in 2 to 4 days. Clinical signs last 3 to 5 weeks in farrowing units (Chasey and Cartwright, 1978; Pensaert and Debouck, 1978) . Two forms of PED have been described, namely, (1) epidemic diarrhoea type I, clinically characterized by diarrhoea in swine of all ages except unweaned piglets (Anonymous, 1972) , and (2) epidemic diarrhoea type II, characterized by acute diarrhoea in swine of all ages (Wood, 1977) . Both forms of PED are recognized in Korea .",

There was a direct relation between viral replication and the development of histopathological lesions in the small intestine. A first peak in the number of virus-infected cells, observed shortly after the onset of diarrhoea, coincided with a shortening of the villi. Infection of villous enterocytes by PEDV apparently led to destruction or sloughing of the cells in the intestinal lumen, resulting in a degree of villous atrophy. Ultrastructural studies have revealed considerable damage to the villous enterocytes by PEDV infection (Ducatelle et al., 1981 Pospischil et al., 1981) . Destruction of, or damage to, these cells by PEDV may induce villous atrophy and fusion, which result in a decreased intestinal surface area; this, in turn, results in intestinal maldigestion and malabsorption, severe diarrhoea, and dehydration Pensaert, 1989) .",

The slightly greater sensitivity of ISH has been attributed to higher quantities of PEDV nucleic acid than of proteins. Early in the viral cycle, quantities of viral nucleic acid may predominate over protein. The current understanding of the replication cycle of coronavirus is that large quantities of mRNA begin forming within 12 -24 h of cellular infection; this is then followed by protein synthesis (Spaan et al., 1988; Lai, 1990) . It is conceivable, therefore, that ISH is superior to immunohistochemistry for the detection of PEDV during early infection. This O. Kim and C. Chae explanation is supported by our observation that insitu hybridization succeeded in detecting PEDV nucleic acid in jejunal tissue sections in the apparent absence of viral antigen in two PEDV-inoculated piglets at 24 hpi. Viral nucleic acid and antigen were detected equally, however, in the jejunum thereafter.",

Moreover, both infections cause destruction of villous enterocytes and villous atrophy in the jejunum and ileum (Debouck and Pensaert, 1980; Debouck et al., 1981; Ducatelle et al., 1981; Pospischil et al., 1981; Kim and Chae, 2002a) . Despite these similarities, the two viruses are distinct. The progression of enterocyte infection by PEDV appears to be slower than that by TGEV. In TGEV infection, viral nucleic acid could be detected as early as 12 h after inoculation (Kim and Chae, 2002a) , whereas in PEDV infection in the present study, viral nucleic acid was absent at 12 h after inoculation, becoming distinct only at 24 h. The longer incubation period observed in PEDV infection is a result of this slower infection rate. Moreover, replication of PEDV is confined to the epithelial cells covering the villi of the intestinal tract, as previously reported (Kim et al., 1999; . This differs from TGEV infections, in which hybridization signal is also seen in crypt enterocytes (Sirinarumitr et al., 1996; Chae, 2001, 2002a) . Since the viral distribution corresponded to the distribution of viral receptor (Weingartl and Derbyshire, 1993) , crypt enterocytes may not possess the PEDV receptor.",
