We show that cholesterol depletion by treatment with methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (m\u03b2CD) affects infection by SARS-CoV to the same extent as infection by vesicular stomatitis virus-based pseudotypes containing the surface glycoprotein S of SARS-CoV (VSV-\u0394G-S). Therefore, the role of cholesterol for SARS-CoV infection can be assigned to the S protein and is unaffected by other coronavirus proteins. There have been contradictory reports whether or not angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV, is present in detergent-resistant membrane domains. We found that ACE2 of both Vero E6 and Caco-2 cells co-purifies with marker proteins of detergent-resistant membranes supporting the notion that cholesterol-rich microdomains provide a platform facilitating the efficient interaction of the S protein with the cellular receptor ACE2. To understand the involvement of cholesterol in the initial steps of the viral life cycle, we applied a cell-based binding assay with cells expressing the S protein and cells containing angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). Alternatively, we used a soluble S protein as interaction partner. Depletion of cholesterol from the ACE2-expressing cells reduced the binding of S-expressing cells by 50% whereas the binding of soluble S protein was not affected. This result suggests that optimal infection requires a multivalent interaction between viral attachment protein and cellular receptors.",

            "text": "Importance of cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains in the interaction of the S protein of SARS-coronavirus with the cellular receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 Introduction Cellular infection by enveloped viruses proceeds via (i) the interaction of viral surface proteins with cell surface receptors to achieve the attachment of virus particles to the cell surface and (ii) the initiation of a fusion event that is usually triggered by a conformational change of a fusion protein (reviewed by Marsh and Helenius, 2006) . Other features of this process vary between different groups of viruses. The viral membrane may fuse with either the plasma membrane or, upon endocytotic uptake of the virion, with the endosomal membrane. For many viruses the fusion protein has to be cleaved into subunits which may occur during transport to the plasma membrane or after virus release from the cell (Garten and Klenk, 1999) . Another variant is the involvement of membrane microdomains in the fusion process (Chazal and Gerlier, 2003) .",

            "text": "Within a membrane, sphingolipids and cholesterol form microdomains with an increased structural order (reviewed by Simons and Ikonen, 1997) . Cholesterol maintains the tight packaging of the sphingolipids with their saturated fatty acid chains. Some proteins partition into these microdomains while others are excluded from them. The tight packaging of the lipid components renders the proteins resistant to solubilization by non-ionic detergents at 4\u00b0C. Depletion of cholesterol from the membrane by drugse.g. by methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (m\u03b2CD)abolishes the detergent resistance. Pretreatment of cells with m\u03b2CD has revealed that viruses differ in their dependence on cholesterol for initiation of infection. For several viruses, e.g. Human immunodeficiency virus, Murine leukemia virus and Herpes simplex virus, it has been shown that they are sensitive to a reduction of the cholesterol content in the plasma membrane (Liao et al., 2001; Lu et al., 2002; Bender et al., 2003) . For some virusesinfluenza viruses and Canine distemper viruscholesterol-enriched microdomains appear to be important in the viral membrane, but not Virology 381 (2008) (Sieczkarski and Whittaker, 2002; Imhoff et al., 2007) . On the other hand, Vesicular stomatitis virus does not show a decreased infectivity after depletion of cholesterol from either the viral or cellular membrane (Popik et al., 2002; Imhoff et al., 2007) .",

However, the explanation of the results is difficult because there are two reports that the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is not present in detergent-resistant membrane domains but rather in the detergent-soluble fraction. Warner et al. (2005) obtained this result for CHO cells transiently expressing ACE2 and Li et al. (2007) for endogenous ACE2 of Vero E6 cells. By contrast, Lu et al. (2008) recently identified ACE2 as a raft protein similar to caveolin-1. So far there was no experimental indication whether cholesterol is required for binding of the virus to the cell surface or for the subsequent fusion event.",

M\u03b2CD is known to capture cholesterol and thereby sequestering cholesterol from the plasma membrane. As a result, lipid microdomains are disrupted and biological processes that depend on them are blocked. First, we determined the effect of m\u03b2CD treatment on the cholesterol content of Vero CCL-81 cells. These cells were used because in contrast to Vero E6 cells that are commonly used for propagation of SARS-CoV, the CCL-81 subline is sensitive to our control virus IBV. Using a fluorometric method based on an enzymecoupled reaction that detects both free cholesterol and cholesteryl esters we found that incubation with increasing amounts of m\u03b2CD resulted in a decrease of the cholesterol levels in Vero cells. At an m\u03b2CD concentration of 10 mM, the concentration of cholesterol was reduced by about 50% (data not shown). To exclude that m\u03b2CD treatment has toxic effects we analyzed the viability of the cells after drug exposure. Up to a concentration of 10 mM m\u03b2CD, the cells exhibited viability rates comparable to that of untreated cells (data not shown).",

At 8 h p.i., the infectivity was determined by counting the fluorescent cells. In the case of pseudotype-infected cells, fluorescence was derived from eGFP expressed from the VSV genome.

At m\u03b2CD concentrations of 2.5 mM and 10 mM, the percentage of infected cells was reduced by about 20% and 50%, respectively, compared to the untreated cells. For the infection by Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) or VSV-G-pseudotyped viruses, it has been reported that virus entry is not affected by depletion of cellular cholesterol (Popik et al., 2002; Thorp and Gallagher, 2004; Imhoff et al., 2007) . We confirmed these results with our pseudotype system (Fig. 1A) . For Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), an avian coronavirus, it has been demonstrated that the infection is dependent on cellular cholesterol (Imhoff et al., 2007) . Consistent with these data, IBV infection of cholesterol-depleted cells resulted in a decreased number of infected cells (Fig. 1A) .

This is in contrast to a recent report that cholesterol depletion results in a decreased expression level of ACE2 (Li et al., 2007) . Possible reasons for this discrepancy will be discussed in a later section. To understand by what mechanism cholesterol depletion inhibits virus entry and to define the molecular step at which the inhibition occurs we established a cell-based binding assay as well as a binding assay with a soluble spike protein fused to human Fc. For the cell-based binding assay we generated a cell line derived from baby hamster kidney cells (BHK21) that constitutively expresses the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein (BHK-S\u039418). To monitor the amount of cells that bind to ACE2-expressing Vero E6 cells, we applied the fluorescent fatty acid dye BODIPY FL C 12 that incorporates into the plasma membrane. Fluorescent dye-labeled BHK-S\u039418 cells were resuspended in serum-free culture medium and added to a Vero E6 monolayer in a ratio of 1/2 (BHK-S\u039418 cells/Vero E6 cells). Unbound cells were removed by washing with PBS containing 0.5 M sodium chloride. As shown in Fig. 3A (panels c and d), BHK cells expressing the S protein of SARS-CoV bound efficiently to Vero E6 cells, whereas only a few cells of the parental BHK cells were detected (panels g and h). Pretreatment of BHK-S\u039418 cells with a rabbit serum directed against SARS-CoV reduced the binding to a level comparable to that of BHK cells, i.e. about 3% (compare panels e and f with panels g and h). To address the question whether in our assay S protein interacts with ACE2 or another cellular protein, we performed the binding assay with three Vero cell lines that differed in the expression of ACE2. As determined by FACS analysis, the expression level of ACE2 on the surface of the Vero cell lines E6, CCL-81, and RIE15 was characterized by the ratio 30:23:5 (Fig. 6A , supplemental material). Compared to Vero E6 (100%) the number of bound BHK-S\u039418 cells was reduced to about 85% and 22%, when the CCL-81 or RIE15 sublines of Vero cells were used for the binding assay (Fig. 6B, supplemental material) . These results indicate that the binding of BHK-S\u039418 cells to Vero E6 cells is mediated by the S protein of SARS-CoV.",

Using this assay, we analyzed the importance of cholesterol for the binding. Confluent Vero E6 cells were treated with m\u03b2CD followed by the addition of BODIPY FL C 12 -labeled BHK-S\u039418 cells. The treatment of Vero E6 cells with m\u03b2CD inhibited the binding of BHK-S\u039418 cells to Vero E6 cells in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3B) . At an m\u03b2CD concentration of 10 mM, binding was decreased to about 50% which is similar to the reduction of the infection rate observed with VSV-\u0394G-S ( Fig. 2A) and SARS-CoV (Fig. 3) at the same m\u03b2CD concentration. The detrimental effect of the cholesterol depletion on the binding capacity of BHK-S\u039418 cells was abolished by the addition of exogenous cholesterol (Fig. 3B ). The treatment with cholesterol even resulted in a 2-fold increase in binding of S-expressing cells to receptor-expressing cells. M\u03b2CD or cholesterol treatment of parental BHK cells did not affect the unspecific binding to Vero E6 cells (data not shown). The cell-based binding data suggest that cholesterol is important for optimal interaction of the spike protein with the receptor ACE2. This assay allows multi-ligand interactions which may be facilitated by cellular receptors arranged in membrane microdomains. To determine whether the interaction of isolated S proteins with membranebound ACE2 is also cholesterol-dependent, we applied a binding assay with soluble S protein. Cholesterol-depleted or replenished Vero E6 cells were incubated with soluble S proteins followed by the quantification of bound protein (Fig. 4) . Compared to the cell-based binding assay, binding of the soluble spike protein construct was not dependent on cholesterol; similar amounts of S protein were bound whether or not the cells were pretreated with m\u03b2CD and/or cholesterol comparable to control cells. To avoid the criticism that the soluble S protein is not functional or not properly folded we performed experiments showing that the S1-Fc construct used is recognized by an antibody directed against the S protein of SARS-CoV (Fig. 7A, supplemental material) . Furthermore, we demonstrated that the soluble S protein binds to transfected BHK cells expressing ACE2 but not to non-transfected cells. Binding was prevented by an antibody directed against S protein (Fig. 7B, supplemental material) .",

However, it has been reported that, ACE2 is not located in detergent-resistant membranes (Warner et al., 2005; Li et al., 2007) . On the other hand, Lu et al. (2008) recently detected ACE2 in the raft fraction of Vero E6. To clarify this discrepancy, we also analyzed whether ACE2 is resistant to solubilization by Triton X-100 at 4\u00b0C. In contrast to previous reports (Warner et al., 2005; Li et al., 2007) we found that a substantial amount of ACE2 from Vero E6 cells was floating to the light fractions of the gradient where the detergent-resistant membranes are expected as indicated by the raft marker flotillin-2 (Fig. 5A ). By contrast, the non-raft marker LAMP-2 was completely solubilized and recovered from the bottom fraction of the gradient. When m\u03b2CD-treated Vero E6 cells were subjected to such an analysis, ACE2 was detected only in the detergent-soluble fraction (Fig. 5B ). This result indicates that a substantial portion of the SARS-CoV receptor ACE2 is associated with cholesterol-rich membrane microdomains that are resistant to detergent-solubilization at 4\u00b0C. The same result was obtained when Caco-2 cells were analyzed (data not shown). The discrepancy between these results and previous reports will be discussed below.",

Our data obtained with the cell-based binding assay indicate that S-mediated binding to target cells is reduced by depletion of cholesterol from the ACE2containing cells. On the other hand, the binding of soluble S protein was not affected. The differences can be explained by a multivalent interaction between the viral glycoproteins and cellular receptor molecules in the case of the cell-based binding assay which may be facilitated by the concentration of receptors in membrane microdomains. In contrast, soluble S proteins can only interact with individual ACE2 molecules and therefore, the binding efficiency is similar whether or not the receptor molecules are arranged in microdomains. Virus binding to cells does also allow multivalent interactions between the viral attachment protein and the cellular receptors. Therefore, arrangement of ACE2 in membrane microdomains would explain why cholesterol depletion from target cells reduces the infectivity of SARS-CoV by about 50%.",

The difference to our data may be due to different staining protocols. In our analysis, the anti-ACE2 antibodies were added prior to m\u03b2CD treatment whereas in the report by Li and co-workers, the antibodies were added after cholesterol depletion. We interpret these results such that cholesterol in the plasma membrane affects the conformation of ACE2 and thus the presentation of the antigenic epitopes.

            "text": "A straightforward explanation of the effect of cholesterol depletion on the binding of S protein would be that ACE2 is located in DRMs and that the concentration of this receptor in microdomains increases the efficiency of binding. The depletion of cholesterol from ACE2-expressing target cells might result in the dispersion of ACE2 molecules on the cell surface and abolish the spatial concentration of ACE2 in membrane microdomains. In fact, we found that a substantial amount of ACE2 from Vero E6 cells was colocalizing with flotillin-2, a marker for detergent-resistant membranes, and cholesterol depletion resulted in a reduction of ACE2 in the detergentresistant membrane fraction after Triton X-100 solubilization. The same result was obtained when ACE2 from Caco-2 cells was analyzed (data not shown). The finding that ACE2 is located in DRMs is contradictory to previous reports that ACE2 is mainly detected in detergent-sensitive fractions (Warner et al., 2005; Li et al., 2007) but in agreement with Lu et al. (2008) . The reason for this discrepancy with the former two reports may be the different experimental conditions. In one report, nonpolarized Chinese hamster ovary cells were analyzed (Warner et al., 2005) , whereas the polarized cell lines Vero E6 and Caco-2 cells were used in our study. Furthermore, we determined the membrane association of endogenous ACE2, whereas others analyzed hamster cells overexpressing human ACE2 protein (Warner et al., 2005) . In one report, the ACE2 distribution was also analyzed in Vero E6 cells (Li et al., 2007) ; however, it is not indicated at what time point after seeding the detergent treatment was carried out. In our experiments confluent Vero E6 cells were used three to four days after initial seeding; the differentiation state of the cells may influence the ACE2 distribution in the membrane environment. We found that endogenous ACE2 is located in detergent-resistant membranes of cells that are sensitive to infection by SARS-CoV. This location provides an explanation of the cholesterol dependence of the virus infection, most-likely during the binding of the virus to its receptor. A similar observation was reported for the binding of HIV-1 to dendritic cells (DC). Treatment of DCs with m\u03b2CD abolished virus binding at 4\u00b0C indicating that DC-specific HIV-receptors are present in the cholesterol-enriched microdomains of the lipid bilayer (Gummuluru et al., 2003) . As mentioned above, the importance of cholesterolrich microdomains for infection by SARS-CoV may be a concentration effect on cellular receptor proteins. A clustering of ACE2 in certain areas of the membrane may allow multivalent binding of virus particles to the cell surface. In this way, microdomains may increase the efficiency of infection, but are not an absolute requirement for the entry process. This explanation is in agreement with the finding that cholesterol depletion reduces the susceptibility to infection but does not abolish it. Infectivity rates were reduced by about 50-60%. This may appear not to be a dramatic effect. However, infection of a host requires many replication cycles. Therefore, a virus that is able to produce a twofold higher number of infectious particles in one round of infection should have a huge advantage to survive in the long run. This is also evident from the other reports on the cholesterol dependence of SARS-CoV. These authors did not determine the infectivity of the m\u03b2CD-treated virus but the effect of m\u03b2CD treatment on a multi-cycle replication of SARS-CoV. Using this approach a 90% reduction of virus in the supernatant was found demonstrating the importance of efficient infection mediated by ACE2 in detergent-resistant membranes.",

The cell line was designed for the generation of viral pseudotypes containing the S proteins of SARS-CoV. Efficient pseudotyping was reported only for S constructs that lacked the carboxyterminal amino acids (Nie et al., 2004) . Therefore, a mutant was generated with a deletion of the 18 carboxyterminal amino acids in the cytoplasmic tail of the S protein. For the generation of BHK-S\u039418 cells, the inducible mammalian GeneSwitch System (Invitrogen) was used. The following primers: 5\u2032-TTTTGGATCCATCATGGATGCAATGAAGAGAGGGCTCTG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-TTTTGAATTCTCACTTCAGGCAGCTGCAGCAGCTGGTCAT-3\u2032 were designed to generate the truncated version of the SARS-CoV S protein by using a synthetic, codon-optimized sequence of the S gene (amino acid sequence is identical to strain BJ01, GenBank Accession No. AY278488) as a template. The BamHI/EcoRI digested and purified PCR product was inserted into the vector pGeneC to give pGeneC-S\u039418. The total open reading frame was sequenced and found to be correct. A cell line expressing the truncated SARS-CoV S protein was generated as described by the manufacturer. In brief, pGeneC-S\u039418/pSwitch-cotransfected BHK21 cells were cultured for 14 days in selection medium containing hygromycin B (500 \u03bcg ml \u2212 1 ) and zeocin (1 mg ml \u2212 1 ). Cell clones were isolated by limiting dilution and analyzed for mifepristone-induced SARS-CoV S expression by Western blotting and the production of VSV-\u0394G-S pseudoparticles as described above. After a recloning step, one cell clone was selected and used throughout the study.",
