            "text": "Although the effective use of highly active antiretroviral therapy results in the suppression of virus production in infected individuals, it does not eliminate the infection and low level virus production in cells harboring virus in sanctuary sites. Thus, the continued search for new antiretroviral agents with unique and different mechanisms of HIV inhibition remains critical, and compounds that can reduce the level of virus production from cells already infected with HIV, as opposed to preventing de novo infection, would be of great benefit. A mercaptobenzamide (MDH-1-38) and its prodrug (NS1040) are being developed as potential therapeutic compounds targeting the zinc finger of HIV nucleocapsid. In the presence of esterase enzymes, NS1040 is designed to be converted to MDH-1-38 which has antiviral activity. While we presume that NS1040 is rapidly converted to MDH-1-38 in all experiments, the two compounds were tested side-by-side to determine whether the presence of a prodrug affects the antiviral activity or mechanism of action. The two compounds were evaluated against a panel of HIV-1 clinical isolates in human PBMCs and monocyte-macrophages and yielded EC 50 values ranging from 0.7 to 13 mM with no toxicity up to 100 mM. MDH-1-38 and NS1040 remained equally active in human PBMCs in the presence of added serum proteins as well as against HIV-1 isolates resistant to reverse transcriptase, integrase or protease inhibitors. Cell-based and biochemical mechanism of antiviral action assays demonstrated MDH-1-38 and NS1040 were virucidal at concentrations of 15 and 50 mM, respectively. Cell to cell transmission of HIV in multiple passages was significantly reduced in CEM-SS and human PBMCs by reducing progeny virus infectivity at compound concentrations greater than 2 mM. The combination of either MDH-1-38 or NS1040 with other FDA-approved HIV drugs yielded additive to synergistic antiviral interactions with no evidence of antiviral antagonism or synergistic toxicity. Serial dose escalation was used in attempts to select for HIV strains resistant to MDH-1-38 and NS1040. Virus at several passages failed to replicate in cells treated at increased compound concentrations, which is consistent with the proposed mechanism of action of the virus inactivating compounds. Through 14 passages, resistance to the compounds has not been achieved. Most HIV inhibitors with mechanism of antiviral action targeting a viral protein would have selected for a drug resistant virus within 14 passages. These studies indicate that these NCp7-targeted compounds represent new potent anti-HIV drug candidates which could be effectively used in combination with all approved anti-HIV drugs.",

Despite the development of highly effective antiretroviral agents (ARVs), therapy does not eradicate HIV infections and life-long treatment is necessary (Berg, 1986) . In the course of long-term treatment, emergence of drug-resistant HIV which reduces the effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy can threaten virologic suppression of HIV. Developing novel therapeutics with a high genetic barrier to HIV resistance and low toxicity thus remains a necessity. The development of a specific virucidal compound with the ability to interfere with multiple stages of HIV replication has the potential to add significantly to the ability to treat HIV infection.",

            "text": "The nucleocapsid protein 7 (NCp7) of HIV is an unexploited target to disrupt HIV with small molecules (Mori et al., 2015) . Established HIV targets for therapeutic applications are enzymes (namely HIV protease, integrase, or reverse transcriptase) or viral entry/fusion inhibitors. HIV-1 NCp7 is a small, 55 amino acid protein that contains two highly conserved zinc fingers derived from a Cys-Xaa 2 -Cys-Xaa 4 -His-Xaa4-Cys (CCHC) motif. The main role of NCp7 is to bind to viral RNA and protect it from degradation (Covey, 1986; Guo et al., 2002; Ramboarina et al., 1999; Tanchou et al., 1998) . The alteration of any one of the zinc-chelating amino acids or surrounding amino acids results in the production of noninfectious virus. NCp7 functions at multiple stages of HIV replication, including: reverse transcription, integration, Tat-promoted transcription, auto-catalysis of Gag-Pol precursors to form functional protease, promotion of Gag assembly and interaction with viral genomic RNA, and protection of double-stranded HIV genomic RNA from degradation (Buckman et al., 2003; Guo et al., 2000; Hargittai et al., 2004; Turpin et al., 1996; Zybarth and Carter, 1995; Berkowitz et al., 1993; Dawson and Yu, 1998; Shubsda et al., 2002; Lapadat-Tapolsky et al., 1993) . The mechanistic activities of NCp7 suggest a potentially high genetic barrier to the selection of resistance and suggest that any resistant strains that may emerge might suffer significant loss of fitness. In vitro evaluations have confirmed that removal of zinc from the zinc fingers results in a loss of viral infectivity, impaired reverse transcription, and defective Gag-precursor maturation.",

Some NCp7 inhibitors act by covalent modification of the target, although these molecules typically lead to undesirable toxicity. The recent report using diselenobisbenzamides to inhibit HIV replication via covalent modification of NCp7 is a promising new development in this area (Sancineto et al., 2015) . Another strategy to inhibit NCp7 is to screen for non-covalent inhibitors. There is recent success in this area that has identified compounds based on a rhodanine core structure (Kim et al., 2015) . The entire collection of NCp7 inhibitors, however, all have EC 50 values for antiviral activity against HIV in the low micromolar range. Compared to most drugs used to treat HIV infection, the antiviral activity of NCp7 inhibitors is significantly weaker. Therefore, alternative strategies to target NCp7 should be considered.",

SAMTs also inhibit HIV replication in both acutely and chronically HIV-infected cells. SAMTs specifically transfer an acetyl group to a cysteine of NCp7, which is then transferred intramolecularly to a neighboring lysine side chain. After NCp7 is acetylated by the SAMT, the protein loses zinc coordination, unfolds, and can no longer function to support HIV replication. We also discovered that after acetyl transfer to NCp7, the conjugate thiol of the SAMT can be reacetylated via a pathway involving acetyl CoA. This mechanism potentially allows SAMTs to inactivate multiple copies of NCp7 via a catalytic mechanism shown in Fig. 1 .",

Additional studies on the mechanism of SAMTs determined that the acetyl group did not need to be part of the molecule at the time of delivery to an infected cell. Instead, treatment with the conjugate thiol of the SAMT (see conjugate thiol of 247, Fig. 1 ) was sufficient to achieve antiviral activity due to the intracellular activation of the conjugate thiol with acetyl CoA (Miller Jenkins et al., 2010) . While the thiol is relatively stable in solid form, in solution it can slowly oxidize to form a disulfide. Therefore, we wanted to investigate whether a thiol and its corresponding prodrug (which would avoid oxidation in solution) may provide an easier drug formulation solution to designing SAMT-based therapy to treat HIV infection.",

Combination antiviral effects (efficacy and toxicity) are analyzed statistically by the Prichard and Shipman MacSynergy II methodology. The MacSynery II analysis includes calculation of the dose response of the two compounds when used alone followed by calculation of the expected additive level of antiviral inhibition when the compounds are used together based on the individual dose response curves. The expected level of activity at each of the concentration data points was then compared to the experimentally determined antiviral activity in the assay. The expected activity was subtracted from the realized activity, yielding a negative, zero or positive value. These values were plotted, yielding a threedimensional representation of the data. Zero values indicating that the expected and realized activity were the same yields a flat surface which is indicative of an additive interaction of the two compounds. Positive values indicate that the realized activity was greater than the expected activity and thus a potentially synergistic interaction of the compounds was observed in the assay. The accumulation of positive points on the synergy plot yields a threedimensional surface projecting above the plane of additivity and the volume of the surface above the plane can be calculated and expressed (in units of mM 2 % for MacSynergy II). In contrast, negative values indicate that the realized activity was less than the expected activity, yielding a surface projecting below the plane of additivity indicative of an antagonistic interaction of the compounds. Our extensive experience with the evaluation of combination assay data has resulted in the following interpretations of the synergy volumes derived from MacSynergy II data: >100 mM 2 % is defined as a highly synergistic interaction; 51e99 mM 2 % is defined as synergistic; 0e50 mM 2 % and \u00c050 to 0 mM 2 % is defined as additive; -99 to \u00c051 mM 2 % is defined as antagonistic; and <-100 mM 2 % is defined as highly antagonistic.",

Once this reaction is complete, a standard work up yields the disfulfide 1 in 73% yield. This disulfide is reduced using TCEP to yield MDH-1-38. The synthesis of the prodrug NS1040 is performed in two-steps, in a single flask, without the isolation of any intermediates. After performing the same amide bond reaction between thiosalicylic acid and b-alanine amide, chloromethyl butyrate is added. After work up of the reaction, NS1040 is isolated in 52% yield (Scheme 1). To ensure that NS1040 could be easily converted to MDH-1-38, routine metabolite identification studies were performed in vitro using human plasma (Supporting Information).

MDH-1-38 and its prodrug were equally active against monocyte-tropic strains of HIV-1 in fresh human monocytes. These data demonstrate that MDH-1-38 and its prodrug NS1040 would be expected to be active against HIV-1 strains found throughout the world as a therapeutic product. The lack of cross resistance to HIV strains conferring resistance to reverse transcriptase inhibitors, integrase inhibitors and protease inhibitors, as well as multidrug resistant isolates, indicates a distinct mechanism of antiviral action for MDH-1-38 and its prodrug when compared with approved HIV drugs. Following cell-based and biochemical inhibition assays to evaluate mechanism of antiviral action, it was concluded that MDH-1-38 and its prodrug act as a virucidal agent and reduces transmission of infectious virus over multiple rounds of virus replication. This reduction in virus infectivity proved a challenge when passaging virus in the presence of MDH-1-38 and NS1040 in attempts to select for drug resistant HIV.

Most importantly, there was no significant combination antagonism or synergistic toxicity for any of the combination therapy assays at the concentrations tested. The evaluation for in vivo toxicity in rats showed that NS1040 is non-toxic, even at doses of 2000 mg/kg repeated for 14 consecutive days. A detailed pharmacokinetic analysis showed that NS1040 rapidly breaks down to MDH-1-38 in blood. Subsequent studies are underway to characterize the metabolites of MDH-1-38.",
