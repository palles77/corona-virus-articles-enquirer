A child born in 1900 had almost a 10% chance of dying between the ages of 1 and 4, often as a result of pneumonia or a diarrheal disease [2] . But with improvements in nutrition, housing, sanitation, hygiene, and the availability of safer food and water, the average life span increased tremendously. The discovery of antibiotics in the mid-twentieth century has also contributed to the increased estimated life span. With such phenomenal progress being made in combating illness, Surgeon General William H. Stewart informed the United States Congress in 1969 that it was time to ''close the book on infectious diseases'' [3] . However, when declaring such a victory, he never could have predicted the increase in emerging, re-emerging, and antibiotic-resistant infectious diseases that were witnessed in the subsequent 30 years [4] . This has led to growing concern regarding new and re-emerging infectious diseases.",

At age 47, he observed that a mold, Penicillium, had inhibited the growth of bacteria, which led to the subsequent identification of penicillin [10] . This discovery was a tremendous advancement in public health. It gave the world a ''miracle drug'' and spawned research that resulted in a vast array of other antibiotics [7] .

According to the WHO, from January 2005 to March 2006, 221 cases of MDR-TB were identified at the district hospital in Tugela Ferry, Kwa Zulu-Natal Province, South Africa [26] .

From April 2003 to April 2007, a total of 291 confirmed cases were reported to the WHO, and 172 (60%) of these cases were fatal [27] . Although sporadic cases of human-to-human transmission of the H5N1 strain have been confirmed [28] , large-scale transmission between humans fortunately has not been observed. Nonetheless, the likelihood that this or another avian flu strain in the future will develop into a human pandemic remains high. Soon after, the West Nile virus, previously associated with Africa and the Middle East, appeared in New York City. It spread rapidly and, by early 2004, had become endemic in the United States. The virus is transmitted via mosquitoes, which have already infected various species including birds, horses, and humans [2] . Human West Nile virus infections never took off in Europe, due apparently to the promiscuity of Culex pipiens mosquitoes in North America, which infect humans and birds, unlike their European counterparts [29] .",

One of the primary reasons for migration of populations is the urge to enter the cash economy, along with the international demand for both skilled and unskilled workers in a globalizing marketplace [2] . With the movement of populations, comes the movement of their microbial agents. The effects of deforestation, along with associated land use changes and human resettlement, have also contributed to changes in diseases like malaria and its vectors throughout the tropics [44] . Similarly, high-rise housing structures in Hong Kong, a direct effect of urbanization, were found to be hot spots for SARS infections and AIDS [45] . Air travel has shortened the time necessary to travel across the globe, besides increasing the number of environments to which all people are exposed. The globalization of the food market has also accentuated the movements of pathogens from one place to another. A prime example of this was an outbreak of cholera in the US that was traced to imported frozen coconut milk and alfalfa sprout seeds that had been contaminated with Salmonella [2] .",

Other less direct effects of climate change are on the ecosystem as a whole, in addition to water and food supplies [55] . Studies on infectious diseases due to climate change have mainly focused on the El Ni\u00f1o/Southern Oscillation, the strongest variability in weather currently observed on earth. Climate changes due to El Ni\u00f1o have been found to be related to the incidence of malaria in South America, Rift valley fever in East Africa, Dengue fever in Thailand, hantavirus pulmonary syndrome in the southwestern United States, childhood diarrheal disease in Peru, and cholera in Bangladesh. Currently, the WHO estimates that climate changeinduced risk of various health outcomes will double by the year 2030 based on the projected increase of greenhouse gases [56] . The geographic distribution of disease-propagating vectors will also change with warmer climates, as recently noted with the ''Tiger mosquito'', Aedes Albopictus.

Renewed effort, resources, and new approaches in battling against infectious diseases are therefore needed. Besides development of more rapid methods for detecting and identifying novel pathogens, there is also a need for designing new drugs against ''old pathogens'' that are developing resistance against currently-used drugs. Heightened surveillance should minimize the chances of outbreaks spreading, while more imaginative policy measures may be required to contain pandemics.",
