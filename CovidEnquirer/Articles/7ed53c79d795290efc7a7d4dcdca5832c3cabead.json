Caliciviruses are important human and veterinary pathogens which are associated with a broad spectrum of diseases in their hosts. Here, norovirus, a prototype of calicivirus and the causative agent of nonbacterial gastroenteritis in humans, will be covered. Classification: Caliciviruses comprise four genera (Table 13 .1). Norwalk virus, a member of the genus Norovirus, causes epidemic gastroenteritis. Sapporovirus, a member of the genus Sapovirus, also causes epidemic gastroenteritis. Besides human caliciviruses, two veterinary caliciviruses are found. Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV), a member of the genus Lagovirus, is associated with a fatal liver disease in rabbits. Feline calicivirus (FCV), a member of the genus Vesivirus, causes respiratory disease in cats.",

VPg (virion protein genome-linked) is covalently linked to both the genomic and the subgenomic RNAs. The ORF1 polyprotein encoded by the genomic RNA encodes nonstructural proteins such as 3CL PRO and RdRp that are essential for viral RNA replication. On the other hand, the subgenomic RNA encodes the structural proteins such as VP1 and VP2. Unlike picornaviruses, internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element is not found in the 5 0 NCR. Instead, the VPg recruits eIF4E, a cap-binding translation initiation factor, to initiate translation (Box 13.1). In other words, the VPg substitutes for the cap structure in recruiting host translation factors. Cultivation in Cell Culture: The investigation on human norovirus has been hampered by the lack of cell lines that support the virus infection. Since human norovirus has remained uncultivable, the studies on viral genome replication could be performed only by transfection of viral genomic RNA into appropriate cells. Recently, major progress in norovirus research was made by a successful demonstration of a human norovirus infection in a cell culture (see Journal Club). Successful establishment of an in vitro cultivation system of human norovirus will facilitate the development of prophylatic vaccine and antivirals.",

Surprisingly, it was found that VPg has the ability to bind eIF4E and, in doing so, it facilitates the translation initiation of viral RNAs in eIF4E-dependent manner. In other words, VPg substitutes the role of the cap structure of eukaryotic mRNAs in recruiting eIF4E, a cap-binding protein.
