We identified those who met the criteria for definite and advanced NEC, as proposed by Bell 3 : history of perinatal stressor (prematurity, intrauterine growth retardation, pulmonary disease, abnormalities of labor/delivery, multiple birth, maternal or infant infection, umbilical catheter, or exchange transfusion), systemic signs of illness (temperature instability, lethargy, apnea, bradycardia, deterioration of vital signs, shock, or gastrointestinal hemorrhage), gastrointestinal signs or symptoms (poor feeding, increasing pregavage results, emesis, or occult blood in stool, plus persistent blood in stool or marked abdominal distention), and abnormal abdominal radiographic findings (significant bowel distention with ileus, bowel wall edema, peritoneal fluid, pneumatosis intestinalis, portal vein gas, or pneumoperitoneum). We calculated monthly attack rates expressed as the number of NEC cases per 100 admissions to the NICU. Monthly attack rates were plotted as a function of time. We compared incidence densities with a Poisson model, as described by Rothman and Greenland. 5 From medical records and nursing notes, we logged the bed assignments of affected newborns from admission to illness onset and applied the Grimson test for spatial clustering. This statistical test examines the geographic locations of ill and non-ill persons by comparing the observed number of adjacent borders shared by persons in the illness-containing area with an expected number with the assumption (null hypothesis) that ill persons are randomly distributed throughout the area being assessed. 6 We conducted a case-control study categorizing as cases the newborns in the NICU with a gestational age at birth \u03fd34 weeks in whom NEC developed in January 1998. We categorized as control subjects the newborns in the NICU with a gestational age at birth \u03fd34 weeks in whom NEC did not develop. Newborns with a gestational age at birth \u03fe34 weeks were excluded. We abstracted demographic, epidemiologic, and clinical data from the medical records of the newborns and their respective mothers by means of a standardized form. Demographic data collected included date of birth, sex, race, weight and gestational age at birth, and birth order, when applicable. Clinical data included Apgar scores at 1 and 5 minutes of life; evidence of severe (\u03fd10th percentile of weight for age) intrauterine growth retardation; age at first enteral feeding and type of feedings; administration of antibiotics and duration of antibiotic therapy; administration of total parenteral nutrition, indomethacin, caffeine, surfactant, histamine 2 blocking agents, corticosteroid, granulocyte-colony stimulating factor, and cardiovascular pressor agents; diagnosis of patent ductus arteriosus, and respiratory distress syndrome or hyaline membrane disease and patent ductus arteriosus; place-ment of umbilical catheter; intubation and duration of intubation; exchange transfusion; and death. Epidemiologic data gathered the names of staff members providing care, as documented in the medical record, to the day of NEC diagnosis for cases and to the day of discharge for control subjects. From the mother's medical record, we recorded age at delivery of the newborn; history of prenatal care, cocaine use during pregnancy, and pre-eclampsia; human immunodeficiency virus status, when known; prolonged rupture of membranes and its duration; administration of corticosteroids and antibiotics; and history of gastrointestinal illness in the 2 weeks before delivery.",

No additional cases of NEC were identified after January 17-the date control measures were implemented-although new patients continued to be admitted to the unit. Control measures included the cohorting of staff and infants, the mandatory donning of gowns and gloves when providing any care to newborns in the NICU, and the encouraging of hand washing. Hand washing was further facilitated in the NICU by the later replacement of antiquated sinks. Additionally, staff, parents, and visitors were asked to avoid coming to the NICU when they had symptoms of vomiting or diarrhea and to keep out until 72 hours had passed after resolution of symptoms.",

During investigations of clusters of NEC cases, fecal samples should be collected from affected and non-affected newborns and from staff members. Samples should be submitted for general viral diagnostic testing and for testing for NoV. Institution of barrier precautions, cohorting of patients and staff, and enhanced hygiene are appropriate while waiting for results of virologic testing. In the case of NoV, control measures are hampered by this virus' low infectious dose and stability in the environment, but should include appropriate hand washing techniques, disposal of waste and soiled materials, and disinfection. 17 We would like to acknowledge Rose Vitagliano, Rebecca L. Frankhauser, and Stephan Monroe for their contributions to this work and Thomas Fekete for his editorial assistance.",
