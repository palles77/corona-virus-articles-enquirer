            "text": "Background: Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most frequent nosocomial infections. Since 1999, a national coordination of regional networks has been implemented to gather SSI incidence data according to standardised method. The aim of the current study was to describe the largest database ever collected in France on SSI and to analyse a 6-year temporal trend. Methods: Surgery patients were enrolled by voluntary participating wards in a yearly 3-month incidence survey. In each ward, 200 consecutive surgery procedures should be included and patients followed up to 30 days after surgery. SSI was defined based on standard CDC criteria. For each patient, risk factors were collected on the day of surgery including age, ASA score, Altemeier wound class, type and duration of procedure, emergency/elective, and when videoscopy surgery was performed. Results: During 6 years, the study included 620,176 operations (17,430,253 operated patient-days follow-up; median post-operative follow-up: 28 days). The overall SSI incidence rate was 1.68%. Organ space and deep incisional SSI accounted for 41.7% although their proportion varied according to the type of surgery. SSI incidence rate increased from 0.91% [0.88-0.94%] for NNIS-0 patients to 13.8% [12.5\u221215.2%] for NNIS-2, 3 patients. The SSI incidence varied from 1.15% for herniorraphy to 9.2% for colon surgery. In NNIS-0 patients, emergency surgery increased the SSI risk for C-section whereas videoscopy surgery was at lower risk for cholecystectomy. From 1999 to 2004, NNIS-0 SSI incidence decreased from 1.1 to 0.9 for 100 operated patients (relative difference: \u221218%). According to procedure, the trend remained significant only for herniorraphy.

Impact of the national policy on SSI incidence remains to be further evaluated, although encouraging results were evidenced for specific surgery.",

Data on HAI surveillance in maternity units are lacking. The Mater Sud-Est Study Group is a HAI continuous surveillance network on maternity units located in south eastern France. We report changes in risk-adjusted HAI rates over a 6-year long surveillance period in this maternity units network. Methods: 161,077 vaginal deliveries and 37,074 cesarean deliveries were included in the surveillance between January 1st 1997 and December 31st 2003. We studied the changes in four HAI: endometritis and Urinary tract infection (UTI) after vaginal deliveries, surgical site infection (SSI) and UTI after cesarean deliveries. We used a logistic regression modeling to estimate risk-adjusted HAI rates. The year of delivery was considered as a risk factor. The trend of risk-adjusted HAI rates over the study period was studied by a linear regression of the year-of-delivery odds ratios for each targeted HAI. Results: The rate of endometritis and UTI after vaginal deliveries was 0.3% (534/161,077) and 0.5% (728/161,077) respectively. Over the study period the decrease in endometritis odd ratios was statistically significant. We found no statistically significant trend in vaginal delivery's UTI.",

Conclusion: These findings highlight the positive effect of participating in a surveillance network for infection control and for improvement of care. Infection Alert, Investigation & Surveillance Network (RAISIN) Bordeux, FR Background: National surveillance of occupational blood and body fluids exposures (BBFE) in France is conducted since 2002 through the Nosocomial Infection Early Warning, Investigation and Surveillance Network (Raisin) in collaboration with Geres (Groupe d'Etude sur le Risque d'Exposition des Soignants aux Agents Infectieux). Methods: Participation of healthcare facilities (HCF) is voluntary and anonymous. BBFE occurring from 01/01/04 to 31/12/04 were documented using a standardised questionnaire documenting the nature, circumstances (mechanism, type of device, infectious status of the source) and follow-up of each BBFE. Incidence of BBFE is reported per 100 hospitalisation beds, by type of personnel per 100 full time equivalents (FTE), or by type of material per 100,000 devices. S4 17th ECCMID / 25th ICC, Oral presentations Results: In 2004, 13,041 BBFE were documented in 371 participating HCF, which accounted for 15% of HCF and 29% of hospitalisation beds in France. BBFE overall incidence was 8.9 per 100 beds. Considering that all French hospitals account for 465,494 beds, 41,276 [95% CI: 40,896-41,656] BBFE could have occurred in France in 2004.",

Post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) was prescribed to 4.5% of exposed personnel (vs. 5.8% in 2003 and 6.3% in 2002); this decrease may reflect the impact of April 2003 French recommendations, which reduced PEP indications. For the first time in 2004, sutures were the most frequent cause of BBFE associated with needles (more than subcutaneous injections) and accounted for 1,103 (11%) of all BBFE; one third occurred among residents, and 20% in ICU or emergency rooms (beyond surgery or obstetrics). Prevention through education and use of safety devices (such as blunt suture needles) may thus be a priority. Data from a cohort of 173 HCF which participated in 2003 and 2004 also were compared and demonstrate significant progresses. Compliance to glove use increased from 58.6% in 2003 to 62.3% in 2004, and BBFE incidence among nurse assistants fell from 2.3 in 2003 to 2.1 per 100 FTE in 2004. Last, BBFE incidence fell from 17.2 to 13.7 per 100,000 catheters, and from 71.6 to 43.2 per 100,000 implantable venous access systems. Conclusion: AES-Raisin is one of the biggest BBFE surveillance network and results demonstrate an increase in observance to standard precautions and a significant decrease in the incidence of some types of BBFE. They also point out future priorities for improvement.",

Suwanpimolkul, M. Pongkumpai, W. Kulwichit, C. Suankratay (Bangkok, TH) Background: Contaminated blood cultures have been recognized as a bothersome issue for decades, and continue to cause a frustration for clinicians. The contamination rates vary widely between institutions from less than 1% to over 6%. Skin antiseptics can prevent the contamination of blood cultures. To our knowledge, no randomised trial of 2% chlorhexidine in 70% alcohol for venipuncture site disinfection has been conducted. Objective: Our study was aimed to evaluate the efficacy of venipuncture site disinfection with 2% chlorhexidine in 70% alcohol compared with 10% povidone-iodine in preventing blood culture contamination. Patients and Methods: A prospectively randomised investigator-blinded trial was conducted in all patients hospitalised in Internal Medicine wards and attended at emergency department at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand from August 15 to October 31, 2006. Antecubital venipuncture sites were randomly disinfected with either 2% chlorhexidine in 70% alcohol or 10% povidone-iodine, and blood cultures were drawn by medical students or residents. The blood culture contamination rate associated with each antiseptic was then determined. Results: Of 2,146 blood culture collected during the study, 108 (5.03%) were contaminated with skin flora. The contamination rate for blood cultures after 2% chlorhexidine in 70% alcohol was 3.2% (34 of 1,068), compared with a rate of 6.9% (74 of 1,078) (P < 0.001) after 10% povidone-iodine. Of the inpatient wards, the contamination rate was 2.6% (18 of 695) and 3.9% (28 of 709) after 2% chlorhexidine in 70% alcohol and 10% povidone-iodine, respectively (P = 0.013). Of emergency department, the contamination rate was 4.3% (16 of 373) and 12.5% (46 of 369) after 2% chlorhexidine in 70% alcohol and 10% povidone-iodine, respectively (P < 0.001). The most common contaminant organism was coagulase-negative staphylococci (81%). Conclusion: 2% chlorhexidine in 70% alcohol is superior to 10% povidone-iodine for venipuncture site disinfection before blood culture sampling.",

            "text": "Objectives: The inanimate hospital environment can become contaminated with nosocomial pathogens. Hydrogen peroxide vapour (HPV) decontamination has proven effective for the eradication of persistent environmental contamination but the rate of recontamination following HPV decontamination is largely unknown. We investigated the extent of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycinresistant enterococci (VRE) and gentamicin-resistant Gram-negative rod (GNR) contamination in a ward side-room occupied by a patient with a history of MRSA, VRE and GNR infection and colonisation. Methods: Fifteen standardised sites in the room were sampled using a selective broth enrichment protocol to culture for MRSA, VRE and GNR. Sampling was carried out before cleaning, after cleaning, after HPV decontamination and at intervals over the subsequent 19 days on two separate occasions. Results: Environmental contamination was identified before cleaning on 60%, 30% and 6.7% of sites for MRSA, GNR and VRE, respectively and 40%, 10% and 6.7% of sites after cleaning (figure). Only one site (3.3%) was contaminated with MRSA after HPV decontamination (figure). No recontamination with VRE was identified and no recontamination with MRSA and GNR was identified in the two days following HPV decontamination (figure). Substantial recontamination towards pre-cleaning levels was identified by day five and six after HPV decontamination for MRSA. Recontamination with GNR at approximately post-cleaning levels was noted on days 7, 8 and 19 ( Figure 1 ). Infection control S5 infection control measures. Detection of risk groups and infection sources and knowing the transmission ways of infections are important for the prevention from NI. In this study it was aimed to evaluate the knowledge level and behaviour models of hospital cleaning staff about NI in our setting which is a 1788 bedded tertiary care educational hospital. Methods: A questionnaire of with 21 questions was implemented to the hospital cleaning staff, who volunteered to enter the study. The questionnaire was composed of two parts: first part contained parameters for determination of sociodemographic properties and the second contained questions about evaluation of the knowledge about prevention from NI. Questions were prepared by using the references about the subject and by the help of the executives of the cleaning staff firm and statistics unit. Data were evaluated by SPSS 13.0 programme using Chi square and Student's t tests. The questionnaire was completed by one by one interview method. Results: A total of 240 of 290 (82.7% of total, 122 male, 118 female, aged 36.2\u00b18.7) hospital cleaning staff volunteered to enter the study. When evaluated according to the educational status; 55.4% were graduated from primary school and only 54% had been working in the hospital more than three years. Mean knowledge level was 18.15\u00b13.97 (maximum 24). Knowledge level was not associated with gender, educational status and duration of working as cleaning staff (p > 0.05) but mean knowledge level of the staff working in the clinics was found higher than staff working in administrative sections (p < 0.05). 71.3% had received a formal education about prevention from NI before starting working but their mean knowledge level was not different from the others (p = 0.294). Only 48% and 50% knew the true order (x,y), while cleaning the patient rooms. 58.8% thought that they could prevent themselves from NI by hand washing before and after cleaning process, 80.8% stated they obeyed handwashing rules and 90.4% stated that they used gloves. Only 48.3% stated that they dried their hands by paper towels. Conclusion: Measurement of the level of the knowledge of the hospital cleaning staff may be beneficial for determination of the existing problems. Periodical well-established educational programmes should be started to improve the current situation. Objectives: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) causes increasing healthcare problems worldwide. Rapid and sensitive screening methods for direct detection of MRSA are essential to limit further spread in the hospital. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the new molecular dipstick assay GenoQuick \u00ae MRSA (Hain Lifescience, Nehren, Germany) for the direct and specific detection of MRSA in clinical specimens. Methods: The analytical specificity of the assay was evaluated by using a subset of 25 MRSA isolates (including SCCmec types I\u2212V); 17 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA) and 38 coagulase-negative staphylocococi (CoNS) of different culture collections. The lower detection limit of the assay was determined by serial dilutions of MRSA strains representing SCCmec types I to IV. The test was evaluated for direct detection of MRSA in clinical swab specimens. MRSA carriage was analysed by both the standard culture methods [Chromagar MRSA (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany), Columbia blood agar, trypticase soy broth] and two PCR assays [GenoQuick MRSA and GenoType \u00ae MRSA Direct (Hain Lifescience)]. Both PCR assays were performed directly from the swab and after overnight incubation in trypticase soy broth. MRSA isolates were confirmed using a mecA gene and S. aureus specific PCR. Susceptibility testing was performed with an automated system (VITEK 2, bioM\u00e9rieux, N\u00fcrtingen, Germany). Results: The lower detection limit of 25 CFU was determined with serially diluted MRSA strains. For analytical specificity all MRSA strains representing SCCmec types I to V were tested positive by the assay. The MSSA and CoNS were tested negative, respectively. Of 187 patient specimens tested for clinical evaluation, 24 were identified MRSA-positive by culture and by both PCR assays. One specimen was positive only by PCR. Among the 163 culture-negative specimens, 162 were negative with both PCR assays. The GenoQuick assay showed a diagnostic sensitivity of 100%, and a diagnostic specificity of 99.4%, a positive predictive value of 96% and a negative predictive value of 100%. Time-to-result for the direct detection of MRSA from clinial specimens is reduced to 2h 20min with the molecular GenoQuick MRSA dipstick assay (2h 5min for amplification and 15 min for detection). Conclusions: The GenoQuick MRSA dip stick assay proved to be a rapid, sensitive and specific assay for direct detection of MRSA in clinical swab specimens in 2h 20min. O22 Throat swabs are necessary to reliably detect carriers of Staphylococcus aureus Background: The anterior nares are considered to be the primary colonisation site of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and approximately 30% of healthy people carry the bacteria in their anterior nares. However, recent studies indicate that the throat may be an additional important site of colonisation (Nilsson P. J Clin Microbiol 2006). Most screening programmes for S. aureus including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) require a swab from the nose only, and a swab of the throat is not considered as standard. Objectives: To determine the frequency of positive S. aureus cultures with positive samples from the throat and negative from the nares. Methods: Specimens were obtained with a sterile polyester fiber-tipped swab moistened with sterile saline from the anterior nares (5 rotations in each anterior nostril), the posterior wall of the pharynx, and the soft palate. Swabs were transported to the laboratory in a transport tube (M40 Transystem, Copan, Brescia, Italy) and put in selective enrichment broth (Chapman broth containing brain heart infusion broth with 6% NaCl, Biomedics, Madrid, Spain). Results: A total of 905 individuals were screened for S. aureus between 2000 and 2005. Complete data were unavailable from 54 individuals who were excluded. Overall, S. aureus was isolated in 386/851 (45.4%) individuals from any site. Screening results No. of % of overall Nares Throat individuals positive pos pos 196 50.8% pos neg 119 30.8% neg pos 71 18.4% 386 100% neg neg 465 Conclusion: Limiting S. aureus screening to the nares fails to identify 18.4% of carriers. Additional cost can be avoided by pooling the specimens while maintaining the higher sensitivity. Therefore, optimal screening for S. aureus should include swabs from both the nares and the throat. This may be even more important if screening is focused on MRSA carriage. Objectives: MRSA rates in a hospital in the North-East of Scotland were significantly declining due to a series of infection control interventions. S6 17th ECCMID / 25th ICC, Oral presentations These included terminal disinfection of the environment in isolation rooms and cohort areas by application of 1:1000 sodium hypochlorite in place of detergent (ECCMID '06, abstract P1333). We evaluated the effect of replacing sodium hypochlorite with a standard detergent. Methods: From January 1997 to May 2006, monthly percentage, nonduplicate S. aureus clinical cases caused by MRSA were collated. In February 2005 hypochlorite cleaning solution as replaced by a standard detergent. Other infection control measures remained unchanged. Dynamic regression analysis with linear transfer functions and interrupted time-series analyses were used to estimate the effect to the intervention. Results: Previously, MRSA rates wee successfully reduced due to environmental screening (p = 0.03), use of hypochlorite for environmental disinfection (p = 0.002), use of alcohol based hand disinfection (p = 0.03) and patient admission screening (p < 0.01). Stopping the hypochlorite disinfection was associated with a sudden increase in clinical cases of MRSA from 10 to 25% over a 6 month period (p = 0.03), with levels approaching those seen prior to the start of the infection control programme in 2001 (see figure). Conclusions: Stopping hypochlorite environmental disinfection was strongly associated with an increase in clinical MRSA cases. This work adds significantly to the meagre published evidence that environmental contamination is important in the spread of MRSA. Objectives: To determine antibiotic-resistant enterococci in Portuguese piggery samples and to analyse antibiotic resistance genes among these strains after European growth promoter ban. Methods: Samples from waste treatment and dry faeces from 2 pig farms in the South of Portugal were studied during 2006. Samples were plated onto selective Slanetz-Bartley agar with or without antibiotics. Bacterial identification was performed by both standard biochemical profiles and amplification of species specific genes. Antibiotic susceptibility (12 antibiotics) was determined by disk diffusion method (CLSI). Detection of genes coding for resistance [vanA, B, C1, C2, ermA, B, C, tetM, L, O, K, S, aac(6 )-Ie-aph(2 )-Ia, aph(2 )-Ib,Ic,Id, aph(3 )-IIIa, vat E] were searched by PCR.

            "text": "Objectives: Antibiotic resistance in veterinary isolates has been reported to be higher than in human isolates due to frequent empirical use, and there are concerns about transfer of resistance between staphylococcal species. S. intermedius is the more common colonising species in dogs, but S. aureus, including MRSA, may also be present. Case reports suggest there can be cross-infection between companion animals and man. Increasing concern about MRSA in the community has led to recommendations for surveillance of antibiotic resistance in isolates from companion animals. This study compared antibiotic resistance in isolates of S. aureus and S. intermedius from dogs and their owners. Methods: A cross-sectional study of owners and their dogs was performed using a convenience sample of 800 pairs recruited at six veterinary practices. Nasal swabs were collected from both owner and Resistance surveillance S7 dog, and held at 4\u00baC in transport medium until culture within 8 h of collection. Subjects completed a questionnaire providing demographic information of owner and dog, and stating if the dog had received antibiotics within the last 3 months. Swabs were inoculated onto blood agar and mannitol salt agar and placed in 5% salt meat broth for enrichment. S. aureus or S. intermedius were identified by means of coagulase, VP, polymyxin susceptibility, and trehalose fermentation. Several colonies of each isolate were tested for susceptibility to methicillin. Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by disc diffusion and interpreted using CLSI guidelines. Results: S. aureus: 168 owners (25%) and 64 dogs (8.5%) were colonised. 16 owners and their dogs were concurrently colonised. 6 dogs (1.3%) and 4 humans (0.5%) were colonised with MRSA. Resistance to oxacillin, clindamycin, gentamicin, tetracycline and fusidic acid was significantly higher in dog isolates. S. intermedius: 64 dogs (7.9%) and 8 owners (1.1%) carried S. intermedius. Four colonised owners had colonised dogs. Methicillin resistance was not detected. Resistance to chloramphenicol, clindamycin, tetracycline, and cotrimoxazole was higher in dog isolates. Resistance to fluoroquinolones and gentamicin was only displayed by dog isolates. Conclusions: Methicillin resistance was found only in S. aureus, but resistance to other antibiotics was higher in S. intermedius. Dog isolates were more resistant than human for both species. Veterinary use of antibiotics may increase resistance and the risk of transmission of resistant strains. Objectives: Antimicrobial susceptibility to human-use antibiotics was investigated among the commensal bacteria E. coli (Ec) and Enterococcus spp. (Ent) from healthy food animals at slaughter across the EU. Methods: Colon or caecal content was randomly collected at 4 abattoirs per country (n = 5 per host). Each herd/flock was sampled once. Ec and Ent were isolated using standard methods. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was done by agar dilution (CLSI, M31-A2) against 9 (Ec) and 5 (Ent) antibiotics in a central laboratory. Resistance (CLSI, M100-S16) was assessed per drug/organism/country. Results: A total 1465 Ec were recovered (cattle n = 490, pigs n = 494, chickens n = 481). Mean resistance (%) for Ec was: ampicillin (A) 3, 29, 53; cefepime 0, 0, 0; cefotaxime 0, 0, 0.4; ciprofloxacin 1, 0.4, 6; chloramphenicol 2, 16, 15; colistin 0, 0.4, 0; gentamicin (G) 1, 2, 2; tetracycline 8, 66, 65; and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 4, 42, 52 respectively. For Ec, Italy and Spain consistently showed the highest resistance; Denmark showed the lowest. A total of 718 Ent isolates were recovered, comprising 356 E. faecium, 83 E. faecalis and 279 other species including E. durans, E. hirae and E. casseliflavus. All Ent but one bovine isolate, were susceptible to linezolid. For E. faecium resistance to A and G was 0\u22122%; vancomycin (V) resistance amounted to 1.9 to 3.5%, whereas resistance to quinupristin/dalfopristin (Q/D) combination varied: 8% (cattle), 19% (pigs) and 20% (chickens). Though low prevalence of E. faecalis limited conclusions, particularly in chickens (n = 6), G and V resistance was low in cattle and pigs (0-11%), resistance to Q/D was very high (46 and 83%, respectively). In the other Ent species, resistance among the 3 hosts to G and V was low (0\u22121.6%). Resistance to A was absent except in chickens: 9.8%. Q/D resistance was among the highest: 5\u22129% for livestock hosts; 26% in poultry. Striking differences among countries were absent for Ent. Conclusion: This pan-EU survey, with uniform methodology, shows that antimicrobial resistance among enteric commensal bacteria at slaughter was variable. For Ec, prevalence of antimicrobial resistance varied for older antimicrobials and between countries but resistance to newer medically important antimicrobials was absent or very low. With respect to Ent, antimicrobial resistance rates varied for quinupristin/dalfopristin, but resistance was absent or very low for other antimicrobials including linezolid and vancomycin. O28 Demography and antibacterial susceptibility of communityacquired respiratory tract infection pathogens in Year 6 vs Year 5 of the PROTEKT surveillance programme D.J. Farrell, C. Couturier, D. Felmingham (London, UK; Paris, FR) Objectives: Patterns of antibacterial resistance among communityacquired respiratory tract infection (CARTI) pathogens vary among countries. PROTEKT is a global surveillance study monitoring antibacterial resistance among CARTI pathogens. We report here the results of the sixth year of the PROTEKT study (Y6: 2004-2005) and changes compared to Y5 (2003-2004). Methods: Clinical isolates of Streptococcus pneumoniae (SPN) and Haemophilus influenzae (HI) from respiratory samples were submitted from 93 centres from 28 countries. MICs and susceptibilities were determined according to CLSI guidelines. Genotyping was performed to define macrolide resistance mechanisms. Frequencies were compared for Y5-Y6 common sites using c 2 or Fisher's exact tests as appropriate with a = 0.05. Results: In Y6, a total of 5182 SPN and 1609 HI were collected. SPN/HI distribution by site were: sputum & BAL (55%/72%), blood (19%/2%), nasopharynx (10%/13%), ear (10%/7%), sinus (6%/6%). The distribution of specimens by age groups were: 2 y 12%, 3\u221214 y 14%, 15\u221264 y 44%, and >64 y 30%. SPN penicillin and erythromycin resistance (PR and ER) prevalences were 19% and 35% respectively [20% erm(B), 9% mef(A), 5% erm(B)+mef(A), and 1% ribosomal mutation]. SPN with both PR and ER was >25% in Far East, South Africa and France and >15% in Hungary, Poland, US and Australia. Significant increases in PR were seen in Poland and China. Falls in PR were seen in Italy, Spain and Japan. Erythromycin resistance was stable in all countries except Germany and Venezuela (decrease). SPN with multiple drug resistance (>2 antibiotic classes) increased in Poland and decreased in Russia. Prevalence of isolates resistant to at least 5 antibiotic classes increased in China. Betalactamase (BL) production in HI was 14% overall, while 2.9% of HI were BL negative and ampicillin resistant (BLNAR). BL production frequencies were stable in all countries except South Africa (increase). Telithromycin showed a sustained activity against both SPN (99.6% susceptible, MIC50/90 0.015/0.25 mg/L) and HI (99.3% susceptible, MIC50/90 1/2 mg/L). Conclusions: Resistance to several first-line antibacterials is a continuing problem worldwide. The last 2 years of PROTEKT indicate changing patterns of resistance in several countries. Telithromycin exhibited significant in vitro activity against the principal CARTI pathogens, including strains resistant to other agents.

Natural plasmids have systems guaranteeing their autonomous replication but also mechanisms controlling the copy-number and ensuring stable inheritance during cell division. Plasmids have evolved as an integral part of the bacterial genome, providing additional functions to their host. The best example of functions associated to a plasmid is given by the antimicrobial resistance. Resistance genes located on plasmids offer immediate advantage to their host under antimicrobial pressure and they can be easily exchanged among bacteria of different species and genera, through the natural process of conjugation, rapidly spreading in bacteria of diverse origin and source. Plasmids are playing the major role in the diffusions of antimicrobial resistance in Gram-negative bacteria, promoting the spread of resistance genes coding b-lactamases such as CTX-M, SHV, TEM, DHA, CMY, VEB, or aminoglycoside modifying enzymes or proteins mediating quinolone resistance. Plasmid-mediated antimicrobial resistance arises from a complex multifactorial process supported by a panoply of mobile genetic elements that contain and transfer resistance determinants. Bacterial plasmid sequence comparisons provided the historical events through which these genetic determinants are assembled by transposition, homologous recombination, and illegitimate recombinational events. Plasmids also play a very important role in bacterial pathogenesis as carrier of virulence genetic traits. Several resistance plasmids have been described in Enterobacteriaceae to carry virulence factors, such as bacteriocins, siderophores, cytotoxins, or adhesion factors and virulence plasmids have been described to carry resistance genes. Plasmids are consequently a fashionable field of scientific research.",

            "text": "Among the most important issues of clinical microbiology, increasing prevalence of bacterial pathogens expressing resistance to multiple antimicrobial agents is of special concern. The observed high frequency of multiresistance suggests mechanisms by which bacterial species can concentrate and efficiently exchange a variety of resistance determinants. Lateral gene transfer, which has been proposed as a fundamental process underlying bacterial diversity, is mainly mediated through plasmids and phages. While integrons are capable of concentrating resistance genes, they are uncapable of self-transposition. The mobility of the resistance genes is mediated by insertions sequences and transposons. Along with the discovery of novel resistance genes, the number of different transposable elements isolated and characterised at the nucleotide sequence level is exploding, and over 1500 different ISs have been identified to date. Bacterial insertion sequences (IS) are small DNA segments (<2.5 kb) with a simple genetic organisation. Most IS elements exhibit short terminal inverted-repeat sequences (IR) and encode a transposase, an enzyme that is required for transposition. These mobile elements play an important role in assembling sets of \"accessory\" functions in bacteria (such as genes forming parts of degradative or catabolic pathways) and in dissemination of resistance genes. By inserting within a coding sequence they may inactivate the gene, or by inserting upstream of a gene they may modify its expression. ISs may also help integration of plasmids into the chromosome of bacteria. Some ISs, such as ISEcp1, are capable of mobilising nearby DNA, by a mechanism similar to one-ended-transposition, while others may form a composite transposon, being capable of carrying the sequence located between the two ISs. True transposons such as Tn7, and the large group of type II transposons of the Tn3 family are complicated structures and include multiple antibiotic resistance genes carried by integrons. The association of integrons with transferable elements may promote rapid dissemination among clinical strains, and create further opportunities for inclusion of additional resistance determinants. Recently novel genetic structures, Repeated Elements (Re), have been described being capable of mobilising resistance genes through a transposition/recombination process that still needs to be fully understood. The study of novel resistance mechanisms and their underlying genetic background revealed novel mobile DNA elements responsible for their mobilisation. These elements are of interest for clinical microbiology, since they are associated to the emergence of novel antibiotic resistance genes, and for fundamental research, since novel genetic mechanisms for gene mobilisation and dissemination were identified.",

            "text": "Synthetic antibacterial drugs such as antifolates, sulfonamides and quinolones have been widely used in human and veterinary practice over the last 60 years. The clinical efficacy of these drugs is undermined by the integration and spreading of resistance borne on transmissible plasmids and genetic islands. In 1977, Pattishall et al. divided the plasmid-borne trimethoprim resistance genes into two distinctive structural classes later referred to as dfrA and dfrB. The number of identified gene types has grown to more than 30 at present. We matched the contexts of all sequenced dfr genes with signatures of two gene capture mechanisms. These are uptake of gene cassettes in integrons by site-specific recombination and one-ended transposition mediated by IS91-like elements referred to as common regions or ISCR. The data we assembled showed that trimethoprim resistance in Gram-negative bacteria is spread, at nearly full coverage, via either of these recombinational paths. Nineteen types of dfr genes in three families, examplified by the gene types A1, A12 and B1, are borne on integron-based cassettes while seven dfr gene types, A3b. A9, A10, A19, A20, A23 and A26 (Grape et al., unpublished) have been inserted via the second recombination path. IS91 family insertion elements use a one-ended transpositional mechanism to produce single-stranded DNA through rolling circle replication. Integron cassettes use recombination sites that are in fact recognized by the cognate tyrosine recombinase in the form of harpins. This suggests that IS91 might enhance excision and integration of cassettes that are situated within replication range of IS91-like elements. If the two gene capture systems are indeed engaged in a functional crosstalk this could explain their frequent co-localisation. The spreading of resistance to other synthetic drugs differs. For instance, sulfonamide resistance in Gram-negative bacteria is ubiquitous but much less diverse with only three gene types in the metagenomic pool. The recombinational spread of sul genes is cryptic and may be diverse. However, one of the genes, sul1, is strongly linked with both integrons and common regions of the IS91 type. Sulfonamides were introduced prior to other modern antibacterial drugs suggesting that it was the key selecting factor for making the dual recombinational platform of integrons and IS91-like elements fixed in most bacterial populations. Quinolone resistance gets contribution from transmissible qnr alleles of three families reported in connection with IS91-like regions (Robicscek et al. 2006 ).",

ISCRs were also interesting in that they are intimately associated with different resistance genes carried on each integron.

Normally, termination of replication occurs at a defined site; misreading of this site leads to replication of large sections of DNA to the left-hand end of the element including antibiotic resistance genes. Many elements are found next to class 1 integrons which we believe to be expressed and active -possibly driven by a hybrid promoter. The only ISCR element shown not to be expressed is ISCR2.

Early and appropriate antibacterial therapy remains an important intervention for such patients. To optimise antibacterial therapy, the clinician should possess not only knowledge of the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of commonly used antimicrobials, but also how these parameters may be affected by the pathophysiological changes occurring during sepsis or septic shock. Pathophysiological changes can be contrasting. Sepsis, and the nonantibiotic treatment, increasing renal preload may result in higher antibacterial clearances. Alternatively, sepsis can induce multiple organ dysfunction, including renal and/or hepatic dysfunction, causing a decrease in antibacterial clearance. Aminoglycosides, b-lactams and carbapenems are distributed in plasma and interstitial space, therefore their concentrations could be dramatically affected during sepsis. These drugs can have a higher Vd during sepsis leading to a reduced Cmax. Some patients with serum creatinine within the normal range can have higher than normal drug clearances, thereby producing low serum concentrations. If a drug needs to have a minimum serum concentration maintained (e.g. b-lactams), a high drug clearance will lead to underdosage for renally excreted drugs. All b-lactams should, in such patients, be administered more frequently than suggested in non-sepsis patients; administration by continuous infusion should be considered. In relation to the aminoglycosides, this means that not only are large doses required to be administered, but because of a high CLCR these antibacterials may also need dosing even more frequently than every 24 hours. Regarding the renal clearance of the fluoroquinolones, in the presence of a high CLCR can be assumed that fluoroquinolone clearance is also high. If this were true these antibacterials would also need to have higher daily doses than proposed in the standard literature.",

Results: We found that 17.2% (34/198) of the children carried E. coli NAR in the first survey and 42.3 (85/208) in the second. Among the children examined in both surveys (n = 147), 9.4% harboured E. coli NAR in the first survey but became negative in the second while 38.5% children found negative in the first survey carried E. coli NAR in the second. E. coli NAR were isolated in both screenings among 11 (9.4%) children. 21% and 34% of the E. coli NAR strains were also resistant to ciprofloxacin in the first and second surveys, respectively. Persistent resistance to NA was associated with an increase in MIC, number of mutations in the gyrA and parC genes and presence of efflux pumps. Acquisition of resistance to NA was significantly higher in two of the DCCs located in one of the 3 villages. The carriage of E. coli NAR was not associated with the child's age or gender, use of antibiotics, or carriage of E. coli NAR among mothers and siblings. Conclusions: The lack of evidence for intra-familiar spread of E. coli NAR and the significant acquisition of E. coli NAR in 2 specific DCCs suggest that other means of transmission such as the food or waterborne routs may explain the high carriage rate of E. coli NAR. Persistent carriage of E. coli NAR is of concern in view of the association with an increase in both phenotypic and genetic markers of resistance to quinolones.",

This has been accomplished by enforcing preventive contact isolation of all hospitalised patients suspected or confirmed as MRSA positive. This has been facilitated by the fact that in these countries the predominant risk factor for patients for MRSA acquisition was hospitalisation abroad, making these at-risk patients relatively easy to identify. Additionally, secondary cases seldom arose after hospital discharge. The recent change in epidemiology where transmission of MRSA increasingly occurs outside hospitals has changed the situation, and an increasing number of MRSA has been reported in all the above mentioned countries.",

The majority of these MRSA has been identified in primary healthcare (community onset) and, in approximately 33% of the cases, the patient had had no connection with healthcare institutions for at least one year prior to the diagnosis. These cases have therefore been considered as community acquired (CA-MRSA). CA-MRSA infections have especially been reported from children and younger adults. Skin and soft tissue infections dominate and represent approximately 90% of the cases. Approximately 30% of CA-MRSA cases have been reported in persons with another ethnicity than Danish. This could indicate that there is a continued influx of MRSA from high prevalence areas into Denmark. Strains belonging to the ST80-IV complex have been the most frequent cause of CA-MRSA in Denmark, however, an increasing diversification has recently been observed including almost all strains known as associated with CA-MRSA. During the same time period the number of MRSA diagnosed in hospitals also increased. This has happened despite continued use of contact isolation of MRSA positive patients during. Hospitalisation of MRSA carriers not identified on admission due to lack of risk factors is probably one important factor responsible for the increased number of nosocomial MRSA in Denmark. An increase in the prevalence of MRSA outside hospitals including in otherwise healthy persons, is thus of great concern as this not only gives rise to CA-MRSA infections but also inevitably will increase the risk of nosocomial MRSA infec-tions and outbreaks.",

            "text": "The first question to ask when considering any screening programme for the identification of CA-MRSA carriage is why? The importance of epidemiological data cannot be underestimated. Data on prevalence can inform empirical therapy requirements or help in the design of intervention strategies. Prevalence can be established for the population in general, or, specific subgroups such as children, military personnel, indigenous or disadvantaged populations can be targeted. Community intervention measures similar to the 'search and destroy' techniques used in hospitals would require large-scale screening. A narrower approach concentrating on high-risk groups to enable programmes such as education on hygiene to reduce transmission would allow a more targeted screening programme. A second more pragmatic area for screening is on admission or during hospitalisation. In some areas in the world there is a blurring of the boundaries of CA-MRSA and HA-MRSA. These organisms have now been reported as a cause of hospital acquired bacteraemia, surgical and prosthetic joint infection and to colonise neonates and adult patients in hospitals. Targeted screening of high-risk patients or all patients on entry into high-risk units are strategies to prevent CA-MRSA from becoming endemic in hospitals. Screening to control recognized outbreaks entails identification of the reservoir to enable appropriate isolation, cohorting and decolonisation measures. The value of screening healthcare workers for carriage of CA-MRSA has yet to be established. How to screen is the next question. Which site(s) give the best yield? Which laboratory method should be used? The ideal test would have high negative and positive predictive values, be rapid, inexpensive, applicable to the routine laboratory, and have high through put capabilities. Currently used tests are traditional microbiological culture and identification methods, use of selective media including various types of CHROMagar and molecular techniques using real time PCR. The requirement for broth amplification increases the sensitivity for some of these methods but also increases the time to identification. There are many different CA-MRSA clones in the world, in Western Australia alone there are over 40 different multi locus sequence (MLST)/SCCmec CA-MRSA clones. Any molecular test must therefore have the ability to identify all clones in diverse regions of the world. The last questions are when and whom to screen. The answer is very much dependent on the purpose of the screening. The range can be from large-scale periodic population screening for epidemiological purposes to continual hospital unit, high-risk patient screening. There are no established guidelines or recommendations for screening for CA-MRSA. Many questions have yet to be answered particularly, whether control of transmission in the community is possible. By looking at what evidence is available we can move a step closer to control of this very significant community pathogen.",

Given that CA-MRSA has been now been implicated in healthcare-associated infections, efforts to reduce the spread of this organism within the healthcare environment are also important and include appropriate hand-hygiene, isolation, and environmental decontamination. Incision and debridement remains critical in the management of most CA-MRSA infections. The use of antibiotics is indicated in many CA-MRSA infections and therapeutic options include older agents, such as clindamycin, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, tetracyclines, and rifampin, and newer agents such as linezolid.

Recent developments in the field of pneumococcal pathogenesis reflect significant developments in both genomics and proteomics. The breadth of microbial genetic diversity is increasingly being recognized. Our understanding of the importance of traditional virulence factors such as polysaccharide capsule, pneumolysin and generation of hydrogen peroxide is evolving while important roles for factors such as pneumococcal pili are emerging. Genetic screens are identifying increasing roles for previously poorly characterised proteins involved in metabolism and transport of key molecules. The importance of the physical state of the bacteria in different tissue compartments is also becoming evident. An improved range of models of various aspects of infection ranging from colonisation and sub-clinical infection to fulminant pneumonia and invasive disease are allowing assessment of both microbial and host factors central to disease pathogenesis. The range of receptors involved in the innate response to pneumococci in the respiratory tract is starting to be appreciated and includes Tolllike receptors and receptors primarily involved in the phagocytosis of bacteria. The interaction between soluble factors and the resident phagocytes of the lung is being clarified and the complexity of cytokine networks involved in the innate host response is being elucidated. Important roles for T-lymphocytes, Natural Killer cells and dendritic cells in the response to pneumococci are being identified. Furthermore our understanding of the regulation of the inflammatory response and of the significant role of apoptosis in the regulation of the inflammatory response has lead to important insights into how cell survival and outcome of infection are closely linked. These observations are enabling a more scientific interpretation of many of the central clinical features of pneumococcal pneumonia and may encourage novel approaches to therapy to improve disease responses. Streptococcus pneumoniae (the pneumococcus) continues to be a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide particularly among young children, the elderly and the immunocompromised of all ages. Infection is preceded by colonisation of the nasopharynx, which is the ecological niche of pneumococci. In most individuals colonisation is asymptomatic and does not evolve to disease. The carrier state is more frequent in young children and may reach over 70% in some populations such as those attending day-care centres. Indeed, this latter group has been found to be a major reservoir of pneumococci playing a key role on the amplification and transmission of the bacteria to other individuals. Of interest, several drug-resistant clones internationally disseminated have been found to be frequently carried by this population. In recent years, there has been some debate on the relative contribution of serotype and genetic background to the invasive disease potential of pneumococcal strains. We will present a study that addresses this question. The study was conducted in Portugal and results from the detailed comparison of two large collections of pneumococcal isolates: a group of over 450 invasive disease isolates and a group of over 750 colonisation isolates collected during the same time period which were characterised in detail by antibiogram, serotype, PFGE macro-restriction profiles, and multilocus sequence typing. The invasive disease potential of serotypes and clones will be discussed.",

The current conjugate vaccines are ideally aimed at protecting against all pneumococcal disease, but have been very successful at preventing invasive pneumococcal disease. Understanding invasive disease epidemiology, both preceding vaccine implementation and after vaccine introduction, is crucial to the design and development of future vaccines. Several recent studies have shown that pneumococcal serotypes differ in their invasive disease potential, and this has particular relevance for the selection of serotypes to include in future conjugate vaccines. It is also essential to understand the serotype-specific changes that have occurred subsequent to conjugate vaccine implementation in the USA, as a model for what might occur post-vaccine implementation in other countries.",

The vaccine as currently formulated affords protection against invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) due to the 7 most common serotypes causing IPD among children less than 2 years of age prior to vaccine introduction in the USA. This formulation is not optimal for many developing countries where serotypes such as 1 and 5 are important. Global, second generation vaccines therefore include at least 10 serotypes. The importance of prevention of pneumococcal disease extends beyond IPD to pneumonia, meningitis, otitis media, prevention of antibiotic-resistant infections, and even prevention of mortality in young infants. Each of these presents specific challenges. The vaccine has been shown to prevent between 25% and 37% of all cause X-ray confirmed pneumonias and this implies a level of protection against pneumococcal pneumonia due to vaccine serotypes in excess of 70%. This reduction in pneumonia has translated into a reduction in allcause mortality due to the vaccine of 16% in rural Africa. The major preventable burden of disease in Africa may be among HIV infected children where the vaccine has also been shown to reduce pneumonia burden. An innovative aspect of the vaccine is the fact that it may reduce the pneumococcal super infections that follow viral respiratory infections, such as influenza, and conjugate vaccination of children may thus be a useful adjunct to pandemic influenza planning preparedness. The interruption of carriage of vaccine serotypes has been shown to reduce IPD in adults in the USA due to herd immunity so the population benefit in an influenza pandemic may extend beyond protection just of immunised children. Herd immunity has also recently been shown to protect young un-immunised infants from IPD. Conjugate vaccine has had little impact on all cause otitis media in randomised trials, but post-marketing studies in the USA suggest that healthcare utilisation for otitis episodes has reduced significantly post vaccine introduction suggesting a major role for herd immunity and allowing physicians to feel more comfortable in a \"wait and see\" attitude to otitis once the prospects of significant complications due to the pneumococcus are likely to be rare. The conjugation of pneumococcal polysaccharides to Haemophilus influenzae protein D has allowed the development of a more efficacious vaccine against otitis media. There has been a dramatic reduction in antibiotic resistance among vaccine serotypes causing IPD in the USA, in both children and adults, but resistance, driven by continuing high levels of antibiotic use, is now selecting resistance in non-vaccine serotypes. In particular, multiresistant global clones of serotype 19A are now dominant in the USA and a 13-valent vaccine formulation including serotype 19A is under development. The implementation of immunisation programmes including conjugate pneumococcal vaccine to infants in European countries affords the opportunity to monitor the impact on all of these health outcomes in both children and adults.",

Tetracyclines were already introduced 50 years ago but have undergone a considerable resistance development in nosocomial and communityacquired pathogens. In June 2005, a minocycline derivative, the new glycylcycline antimicrobial tygecycline, was approved by the FDA for treatment of complicated intra-abdominal and complicated skin and skinstructure infections. Tigecycline, a bacteriostatic agent, binds to the 30S ribosome unit, blocks entry of amino-acyl tRNA molecules, and prevents protein synthesis; it has a broad antibacterial spectrum with activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens, including multidrug-resistant organisms and anaerobes. The modification of the basic tetracycline molecule has overcome the two resistance mechanisms seen with tetracyclines (efflux, ribosome protection). Tigecycline exhibits linear pharmacokinetics, has a long half-life (24\u221248 hours), is highly protein bound (71\u221289%), and has a large volume of distribution (7\u22129 L/kg). Tigecycline is not extensively metabolised; the primary route of elimination is biliary excretion (59%) and 33% is excreted unchanged in urine. The recommended dosing regimen is an initial dose of 100 mg, followed by 50 mg every 12 hours. Time above MIC and AUC/MIC ratio are the most important pharmacodynamic parameters. In two double-blind studies the safety and efficacy of tigecycline versus aztreonam plus vancomycin were compared in hospitalised adults with complicated skin and skin-structure infections. Over 1000 patients were randomised and the results of the pooled analysis determined that tigecycline monotherapy was as effective and statistically non-inferior to aztreonam plus vancomycin. Two double-blind studies including more than 1000 patients analysed safety and efficacy of tigecycline versus imipenem/cilastatin in adults with complicated intra-abdominal infections. Results of the pooled analysis determined that tigecycline was efficacious and statistically noninferior to imipenem. Nausea (20\u221230%) and vomiting (15\u221220%) are the most common adverse effects observed in clinical trials. They usually occur within the first two days of therapy, are more common in women (48%) than in men (24%), and may also be age related.",

The lack of new effective agents in the near future has revived interest in the re-use of some molecules, abandoned because of their toxicities. Colistin (colistimethate sodium) is a polymyxin antibiotic available in parenteral formulation and used for intravenous, aerosolised and intrathecal/intraventricular administration. The bactericidal activity of colistin is due to a detergent effect on the cell membrane and therefore not dependent upon bacterial metabolic activity. Because this drug was developed during the 1950s, only little pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information are available and the optimal daily dose for severely ill patients is still unknown. Colistin, used both intravenously and by inhalation, was used until last decade mainly in cystic fibrosis patients. Recently, colistin has been used in non cystic fibrosis patients as a salvage therapy for the treatment of infections with Gram-negative bacteria resistant to all other antibiotics. Clinical reports on the efficacy of intravenous colistin in these patients are not randomised studies and in most of them, colistin was frequently associated with other antimicrobial agents with a lack of a control group. A good outcome occurred in most infections (52\u221275%) but with the poorest results observed in pneumonia (25%). In vitro studies have shown synergistic effect between colistin and rifampin but no clinical study has been designed to confirm this synergy. Nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity are the most common toxicities of colistin. However recent studies demonstrated a reduced toxicity as compared with previous studies, even if a higher dosage is used. This low renal toxicity rate was observed in both critically ill patients and patients treated with prolonged courses of colistin. There are also recent clinical reports on the use of colistin in continuous intravenous infusion to minimise potential toxicity. This reduction of toxicity without impairment of efficacy (concentration-dependent killing in in-vitro timekill studies) should be confirmed by further studies. Neurotoxicity has also been more frequently reported in case of renal dysfunction. Development of resistance to colistin is a major problem, especially in A. baumannii. This highlights the urgent need to preserve this molecule by the best appropriate dose regimen and by an optimal synergistic combination with other antibiotics.",

In fact, It is not mentioned specifically in the current editions of the most prestigious textbooks of internal S13 medicine or infectious diseases. The emergence of infections caused by bacteria resistant to almost all antimicrobial agents may have renewed the interest for addressing the contributions, limitations and future clinical indications of this drug. Fosfomycin exhibits a rapid bactericidal activity against a large number of aerobic Gram positive and Gram negative bacterial species by inhibiting the initial step of cell wall syntesis. Some important multiresistant pathogens such as penicillin-resistant pneumococci, methicillin-resistant staphylococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and ESBL-producing enterobacteriaceae are usually susceptible to the drug. To date, no cross-resistance with other antibiotics has been reported. Favourable pharmacokinetic properties include a low molecular weight, a negligible protein binding, a large volume of distribution in human tissues and a good penetration into the inflamed CSF. The disodium salt of fosfomycin can be administered intravenously in high doses due to its very low toxicity, achieving plasmatic peak levels that are several times above the MIC of susceptible microorganisms (breakpoint 64 g/mL). An oral salt of fosfomycin and tromethamine with enhanced bioavailability is also available since 1990. The major drawback of fosfomycin is the frequent development of resistance during therapy. This phenomenon, which has been demonstrated in \"in vitro\" and \"in vivo\" studies, precludes its parenteral use as a single agent in the clinical practice. As a counterbalance, fosfomycin can act synergistically with other antibiotics, especially with those that inhibit later points in cell-wall synthesis. Such synergism has been shown repeatedly against different strains of Staphylcoccus aureus, CNS, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Moreover, in experimental animal models of MRSA endocarditis and cefalosporin-resistant pneumococcal meningitis, fosfomycin and b-lactam (or vancomycin) combinations have proved to be superior than monotherapies, preventing the emergence of drug-resistant populations as well. However, the reported clinical experience with these combinations is very scarce and, therefore, there are not evidence-based recommendations supporting its use. On the other hand, various clinical trials have indicated that fosfomycin trometamol, as a sole antibiotic, is effective and safe for the treatment of uncomplicated UTI, providing high and long lasting urinary fosfomycin levels, which help to prevent the emergence of resistant strains. Because of the increasing prevalence of CTX-M type ESBL-producing E. coli in the community, the oral administration of a single dose of 3 gr. of fosfomycin trometamol may be considered nowadays as a first line therapy for uncomplicated UTI in young women. However, the possible emergence of fosfomycin-resistant mutants among ESBL-producing enterobacteriaceae should be taken into account.",

Chloramphenicol proved to be an effective alternative for the treatment of pneumococcal and meningococcal disease and also in patients with meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae. Chloramphenicol's loss of favour began in the 1960s, when it was shown to have two distinct toxic effects on hematopoiesis: a frequently observed, dose-dependent anaemia, reversible on cessation of therapy, and an irreversible, 'idiosyncratic' aplastic anaemia, which had an incidence of approximately 1 case per 30,000 courses of therapy, a high case fatality rate, and no correlation with the or duration of treatment. The use of chloramphenicol has then become restricted to life-threatening infections for which there are no acceptable alternative treatments like brain abscesses. Analogues of chloramphenicol have been developed that lack the aromatic NO 2 group that is thought to cause irreversible marrow aplasia. Although the clinical efficacy of such compounds has not been evaluated, they are effective in vitro against most bacteria, even those that are resistant to chloramphenicol. The data provided in support of a hypothesis that these molecules needed a nitro group in order to cause the blood dyscrasias were insufficient in themselves. Florfenicol has followed chloramphenicol in veterinary medicine. The potential for florfenicol to cause blood dyscrasias, such as aplastic anaemia, in humans was discussed in relation to the chemically related chemicals chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol. Human epidemiological data could not be used to demonstrate the safety of florfenicol as florfenicol has never been used in human medicine. Nevertheless, because there is as yet no way to monitor the potential for irreversible bone marrow toxicity, it is unlikely that such compounds will become available for the treatment of chloramphenicolresistant infections in general -and meningococcal disease in particular. The future of chloramphenicol is not entirely certain. On one hand, it is a well-studied, long-standing treatment for fighting a number of different infections; it is also very inexpensive and consequently has very widespread use. It would, however, be a very good thing if we could find a new drug or group of drugs that produced similar results in fighting infection but did not have as many serious side effects. It would take a long time before any drug could ever replace chloramphenicol, because of both its broad use and its very low cost.",

            "text": "Results: Most sera predominantly recognized the immunodominant regions of the molecule. Increasing the age was negatively correlated with parasitaemia and positively with IgG antibody responses and haemoglobin levels indicating that total IgG responses to domains 2, 3 and crude schizont extract coincidental to a decrease in parasitaemia density and frequency. IgG3 response was the main IgG in those who had no parasitaemia at the final time point. IgG2 and IgG3 were increased amongst individuals with no parasitaemia and with higher levels of haemoglobin at higher ages that had exposure to parasite over a long period of time. Conclusion: IgG3 was the main antibody, mainly against domain 3 of MSP-2, that was associated with increase in haemoglobin levels and decrease in parasitaemia suggesting that domain 3 is preferred over other domains and crude schizont extract in presenting a clearer picture of immunity against malaria. These results could be an evidence of protective role of these antibodies against malaria disease and, therefore, domains 3 can be considered as reliable vaccine candidate antigens. Objectives: Our country is hyperendemic for dengue virus infection. Serosurveillance indicates that almost all native adults have been infected, mostly asymptomatically. A long-held mechanism explaining clinical severity involves sequential infections by different serotypes. Even though some of its peer flaviviruses are known to reside persistently within the host and contribute to host illnesses, dengue virus has not been shown to behave in a similar fashion. As dengue is a haematotropic virus, we sought to find evidence of its persistence in the bone marrow of previously-infected persons. Methods: We studied patients clinically suspected or known of haematologic malignancies and indicated to have diagnostic bone marrow initial or follow-up studies. A fraction of cellular marrow was employed for RNA extraction and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) by dengue-specific primers. Serologic assessment by haemagglutunation inhibition test (HI) for dengue and chikungunya viruses and by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for dengue was performed on the study of bone marrow study and, in some cases, 14\u221260 days later, to minimise a chance of including patients with recent dengue infection. Serologic interpretation was made according to standard criteria. Demographic data of all patients were analysed, especially for the history of recent febrile illnesses which could be due to dengue infection. Background: Intermittent preventive antimalarial treatment of infants (IPTi) is considered a promising malaria control strategy. Among the factors that influence the extent of protection provided by IPTi are malaria endemicity, seasonality, drug resistance patterns and the IPTi application schedule. Studies modeling the effect of malaria incidences on IPTi are scarce. The aim of this study was to describe how far protective efficacy of IPTi depends on the incidence rate of clinical malaria. Methods: One-thousand seventy infants were enrolled in a registered controlled trial on the efficacy of sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine based IPTi in the Ashanti Region, Ghana. In an ecological analysis, malaria incidence rates in the first year following IPTi were stratified by the village of residence and month of birth of participants and the spatiotemporal variation of the malaria incidence on the protective efficacy of IPTi was analysed. Findings: The rate of malaria attacks during the first year of followup was highly dependent on the month of birth and on the village of residence of the children. Protective efficacy of the first IPTi administration (IPTi-1) correlated with malaria incidences in children living in a particular village or born in a particular month (r2 0.48, p < 0.04 and r2 0.63, p < 0.003, respectively). A corresponding trend was seen after the second (IPTi-2) and third (IPTi-3) drug administration. Interpretation : Correlations between IPTi efficacy and malaria incidences may have implications on IPTi implementation strategies I will discuss the role mathematical modelling in pandemic planning and response. Recent research examining whether antiviral prophylaxis and social distance measures could be used to contain a nascent pandemic at its point of origin will then be reviewed. Containment is potentially feasible, but requires rapid detection of the initial transmissible case cluster and a rapid and organised response to each new case. These may be demanding criteria for much of SE Asia. If containment fails, slowing spread becomes a policy priority and in that context I will discuss the potential impact of restrictions on international travel. To conclude, I will discuss pandemic mitigation strategies which make best use of limited vaccine and antiviral supplies.",

Invasive fungal infections today represent the main causes of fatal outcome. Early diagnosis of probable or proven invasive aspergillosis is therefore one of the most important objectives of supportive care in patients with profound and prolonged neutropenia. With the advent of more effective and well-tolerated antifungals active against aspergillosis, the incidence of other mould infections such as zygomycosis is on the rise. The use of highly aggressive chemotherapy induces severe mucosal damage in many cancer patients. Apart from neutropaenic enterocolitis, a broad spectrum of infections associated with impairment of mucosal barriers may be clinically important, e.g., streptococcal bacteraemia, septic enterococcal infection, or candidaemia. The widely spread use of multi-lumen central venous catheters causes a considerable number of bloodstream infections caused by coagulase-negative staphylococci, S. aureus, Gram-negative bacilli, or Candida spp. Primary removal of foreign material may be important for the successful management of these catheter-related infections. Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with reducedintensity conditioning has become more common also for treatment of aggressive haematologic malignancies in elderly patients as well as in patients with severe co-morbidity, who formerly have not been taken into consideration for myeloablative transplant procedures. Despite a marked reduction of complications related to pancytopenia combined with acute graft-versus-host reaction, the rate of severe and life-threatening fungal infections and cytomegalovirus diseases has turned out to be comparable to conventional allogeneic transplantation. Most importantly, more than half of these infectious complications emerge after more than 90 days post transplant, i.e., in patients already managed on an outpatient basis.",

In the last decade, IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) typing has gained recognition as the gold standard in the molecular epidemiology of tuberculosis. The application of RFLP typing has provided new insights in, e.g., the natural history of tuberculosis infection and (inter-)national transmission of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in Europe (to be presented). However, this method is technically demanding and labour intensive, and requires weeks of culturing to obtain sufficient DNA. The complex RFLP patterns are difficult to interpret and exchange.",

This study comprised the initially explored 12 loci (as applied in the USA) and most of the exploitable loci disclosed in the international context so far. The typing results of 824 M. tuberculosis isolates revealed the 24 most optimal loci. The use of 15 selected loci is recommended as the new international gold standard for typing of M. tuberculosis complex isolates. A recent study pointed out that VNTR typing on basis of 24 loci is useful to study the phylogeny of the complex. As experienced after the standardisation of IS6110 RFLP typing in 1993, it is expected that the recent (December 2006; J. Clin. Microbiol.) international consensus on VNTR typing will facilitate the comparison of molecular epidemiological data from various geographic regions, the spread of multi-drug resistance in Europe, the establishment of an international VNTR database and the meta-analysis of worldwide typing results in order to study the population structure and spread of M. tuberculosis. Many institutes in the world have large databases of IS6110 RFLP patterns of M. tuberculosis isolates from extended time periods. Because in the epidemiology of tuberculosis transmission and manifestation of the disease can be separated in time by multiple years, the switch to VNTR typing can not be done without any overlap of the application of the two typing methods.

            "text": "A large proportion of new cases of tuberculosis (TB) in the world arise from a reservoir of people latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). In TB endemic areas of the world, the average time to diagnosis a case of TB after the onset of active disease is 6 months. During these 6 months, such a case of TB is likely to infect, on the average, 10 close contacts. If one of these 10 newly infected contacts then develops TB sometime in his life time, he will infect 10 other persons before diagnosis. The cycle then repeats itself. Thus, if a TB control programme is only focused on the treatment of active cases, TB will never come under control. The fundamental question in TB control, therefore, is \"can we predict who among the latently infected people will progress to active disease so that such a person can be given preventive treatment?\" To answer this question, the mechanism of Mtb persistence and reactivation needs to be better understood. A variety of models for bacterial persistence has been proposed recently. Most genetic studies that provide evidence for the putative role of a gene in persistence are based on demonstrating that an Mtb strain disrupted in such a gene is attenuated in an animal model of TB. However, several recent gene disruption studies have shown that Mtb mutants can also become hypervirulent in an animal model. This suggests that some Mtb genes may actually help to temper the virulence potential of Mtb so that the organism can establish a stable niche in a host without harming the host. We provide evidence that a cluster of genes in an operon called mce1 in Mtb is involved in lipid transport and metabolism that helps to remodel the bacterial cell envelope. The operon appears to respond to a signal induced by the host's granuloma cell turnover, while the host's proinflammatory cells that comprise the granulomas appear to respond to the changing bacterial cell envelope lipid turnover. An Mtb mutant disrupted in the mce1 operon becomes hypervirulent in a mouse model of TB; it is unable to induce well-organised granulomas in mouse lungs, and the mouse dies from an uncontrolled bacterial proliferation. This mutant accumulates free mycolic acids on its surface. On the other hand, an Mtb strain disrupted in the negative regulator of the operon (mce1R) constitutively expresses the mce1 genes in vivo. This mutant is also hypervirulent but for an opposite reason-it causes rapidly progressive, hyper-proinflammatory response. Thus, the mce1 operon appears to serve as a homeostatic regulator of pro-inflammatory response by the host, helping to establish a balanced relationship favourable to both the host and Mtb. Understanding and exploiting this relationship may lead to new ways to predict a subset of latently infected people who progresses to active disease; it may also lead to the development of a therapeutic vaccine to prevent latently infected people from ever developing TB. Strain Sv29 was sequenced up-and downstream of cpsA. Approximately 25 kb of DNA (9 kb upstream of the cpsA start and 15 kb downstream) were comprised between an upstream dexB and a downstream aliA gene. 14 genes were found between the cpsA start and the aliA stop, comprising genes identical to the pneumococcal capsulation genes wzg (capsular polysaccharide expression regulator), wzh (Wze phosphotyrosine phosphatase), wzd (Wze phosphorylation), wze (autophosphorylating protein-tyrosine kinase), wchA (undecaprenyl phosphate glucose-phosphotransferase), wzy (oligosaccharide repeat unit polymerase), wzx (flippase) and several genes with putative glycosyl, glycerol and acetyl transferase activity and a putative UDPgalactopyranose mutase. Four genes were upstream between the cpsA start and the dexB start, comprising dexB, aliA-like orf1 and 2 genes and an unidentified gene. Objectives: Staphylococcus aureus can be a respiratory pathogen in cystic fibrosis (CF) and its pathogenicity is related to a combination of virulence and antibiotic-resistance genes. Little is known about the agr-group in CF-isolates.

Results: MRSA was isolated in 8% of cases. All staphylococci showed the following resistance profile: 37% for ERY, 21% for GM, 5% for DA, 14% for CIP, 11% for LVX, 12% for RD, 6% for TE and 3% for C. Among the strains, agrII was the most prevalent (35%) while agrI-III-IV were isolated approximately in 21% of cases. Within the agr-groups the distribution of virulence determinants revealed a common conservedcore background (sarA-rnaIII-spa-icaA-hla-hlg), whereas accessorygenes were always represented, in different combinations, and copossessed significantly. Capsule type-5 was prevalent in agrI while type-8 was prevalent in agrII/III. agrI was associated with the presence of many virulence-genes such as cytotoxins and proteases (sea-lukE-splB) and in one agrI isolate lukS/F-PVL was found; agrII also possessed an adhesin sdrE; agrIII was associated with adhesins and enterotoxin (fnbA-sea-cna), the exfoliatinA was never detected; agrIV possessed the cytotoxin lukE, adhesin cna and exfoliatinA, eta. Protease gene (splB) was always found associated with cytotoxin lukE in agrI-II-III and, mostly, sdrE adhesin was associated with these. A frequent inversecorrelation was found between cna and lukE-splB in all agr-groups and a close correlation was observed between cap8 and cna in agrIII-IV. Conclusion: Our data demonstrated for the first time an increase of MRSA in our centre; furthermore, CF-persistent infections were not associated with a distinct agr-specificity group or a diffused antibioticresistance of the strains, but rather S. aureus isolates have a complex distribution and combination of virulence determinants which contribute to S. aureus pathogenicity in CF patients.

Methods: To evaluate neurogenesis in patients with acute infection of the central nervous system, brain sections of 18 patients dying from bacterial meningitis and 8 patients dying from non-neurological diseases were investigated by immunohistochemistry. Results: In the dentate gyrus of the hippocampal formation, the density of Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA)-expressing cells was higher in patients with bacterial meningitis compared to the control group (p = 0.02). Furthermore, the number of cells expressing the immature neuronal marker protein TUC-4 was increased in brain sections of persons dying from bacterial meningitis compared to control cases (p = 0.004). In the subventricular zone, no difference of cells expressing TUC-4 was observed between both groups (p = 0.39). Immature neurons expressing TUC-4 had no morphological features of apoptotic cell death and no evidence of DNA fragmentation.",

Stimulation of neurogenesis might help to improve therapy of acute inflammatory diseases of the brain. Methods: C57Bl6-mice (n = 21) were trained to find a hidden underwater platform within less than 90 s (18 trials over 3 days). Swim tracks and the latency to escape from the water were recorded by a video camera. Thereafter, mice received CpG-DNA (0.001 mg/d) or the same volume of sterile saline over 28 days into the right ventricle after stereotactic implantation of a catheter connected to a subcutaneous osmotic pump. Water maze testing was peformed weekly. Results: After initiation of treatment, the latency to reach the hidden platform in the water maze was sigificantly longer in mice receiving CpG-DNA than in control animals (p = 0.006 at day 28 after initiation of treatment). Histology showed profound inflammation with invasion and activation of T-and B-cells and axonal damage. Furthermore, ependymal damage and loss was seen in CpG-treated animals. Additional experiments with TLR9-deficient mice showed no major inflammation after CpG-treatment over 28 days. Background: Early detection of microorganisms in blood is essential for early diagnosis and treatment of bloodstream infections. Calorimetric detection of microbial growth may be more sensitive and rapid than blood culture systems. We compared microbial detection in spiked blood specimens using a commercial system (CO 2 detection by colour change) and an isothermal microcalorimeter. Methods: Escherichia coli (ATCC 25922) or Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213) were added at 3 different concentrations to anticoagulated blood obtained from healthy volunteers. Aliquots of 7.5 ml spiked blood were added into aerobic blood culture bottles containing 40 ml growth medium and incubated in the blood culture instrument (BacT/ALERT, bioM\u00e9rieux, Durham, NC, USA). Before incubation, 1 ml of the bottle content was inoculated in glass ampoules containing 2 ml sterile trypticase soy broth for calorimetry (TAM III, Thermometric AB, J\u00e4rf\u00e4lla, Sweden). Blood cultures and calorimetry ampoules were simultaneously loaded in corresponding instruments and incubated at 37\u00baC for 72 hours. Time to positivity was defined as the interval from incubation start until positive signal (BacT/ALERT) or until the heat flow rate increased 10 mW above baseline (calorimeter detection limit = 0.3 mW). Results: Time to positivity was considerably shorter using calorimetry (Table) . Blood without added pathogens produced no heat signal above baseline. Spiked specimen heat signals rose to >100 mW as the pathogens multiplied during the incubation period. The objective of the work carried out was to determine the increase rate of MRSA detection using an enrichment step compared to direct culture on chromogenic agar. MRSA screening swabs from neonates in the NICU were compared: each swab was first cultured directly onto chromogenic MRSA ID agar and then incubated in Brain Heart Infusion broth for 24 hours. The broths were subsequently subcultuerd onto MRSA ID agar. All plates were incubated for 48 hours aerobically at 37\u00baC and checked for the presence of green colonies, which is indicative for MRSA, at 24 and 48 hours. All green colonies had confirmatory tests for MRSA. The limit of detection was determined for both direct and enriched cultures on MRSA ID agar using doubling dilutions up to 1/4096 from an initial 0.5 McFarland suspension. Plates were incubated for 24 hours aerobically at 37\u00baC after which colony counts were performed. A total of 1181 swabs were tested using direct and enriched culture methods. With direct culture, 16 isolates of MRSA were detected after 24 hours incubation and a further 6 after 48 hours incubation (22 in total). Following enrichment, 34 isolates were detected after 24 hours incubation and one more following 48 hours incubation (35 in total). Enrichment yielded a 59% increase in the number of isolates of MRSA detected compared to direct culture. The limit of detection for direct culture was 69,000 cfu/mL at 1/128 dilution with 84,000 cfu/mL at 1/2048 dilution following enrichment. Results showed that the limit of detection was higher following enrichment indicating a 16-fold increase in sensitivity compared to direct culture. The comparison of patient samples correlated with this by showing an increase of 59% in the rate of detection of MRSA following enrichment. In conclusion enrichment has proven to dramatically increase the sensitivity and rate of detection of MRSA compared to direct culture alone and in order to ensure maximum sensitivity in the detection of MRSA enrichment should be employed as the method of choice in routine laboratories.

Objectives: The increasing cross-border transfer of patients and healthcare workers (HCW) within the EU causes enormous problems with regard to control the spread of multi-resistant pathogens. Especially within the Dutch-German border region, there are great differences in the prevalence of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA): the Netherlands <1%, Germany~5\u221225%. In addition, within the last two years an increasing number of community-acquired (CA)-MRSA could also be noted in the Netherlands, which represent an additional danger. The objective of this study was to elucidate the molecular cross-border epidemiology of MRSA within the EUREGIO Twente/M\u00fcnsterland. Methods: The first MRSA isolates of all patients and HCWs obtained within the EUREGIO MRSA-net Twente/M\u00fcnsterland were typed. The epidemiological backbone of the project is a typing network providing a common language based on S. aureus protein A (spa) gene sequencing. Results: Since the beginning of the project in July 2005, more than 1400 isolates from in-and out-patients and nursing home inhabitants were typed. Three spa types (t025, t091, t162) were detected only within the Euregio. The spa types t004, t009, t012, t024, t036, t051 and t084 were determined in the German part of the Euregio, only. However, the majority of spa types on the German side were in concordance to the national epidemiological trend with spa t001, t002, t003, t004 and t032 as the most common spa types. The spa type t044 -often associated with CA-MRSA in central Europe -was detected on both sides; 1% on the German and~15% on the Dutch side of the border, underlining the emerging problem of CA-MRSA. Focusing on hospitalised patients, MRSA in blood cultures -only detected on the German side -were mainly spa type t001, t003, t004, t008 and t032. Conclusion: In summary, the use of spa typing elucidated differences in the regional epidemiology of MRSA. However, cross-border spread of MRSA was also detected. Therefore, new co-ordinated regional and cross-border strategies have to be developed in the MRSA-net to fight against MRSA. Objectives: The success of pandemic hospital-acquired MRSA clones may be due to high adhesive properties. Adhesion is mediated by various different cell wall proteins called adhesins that are tightly regulated. The accessory gene regulator (agr) is one acting regulator. agr dysfunction is associated with overexpression of certain adhesins and seems to be responsible of the success of the CMRSA-3 clone in Canada. In this way, we compared adhesive properties, the adhesin gene content and the functionality of agr of MRSA Lyon clone isolates to those of MSSA isolates. Methods: We studied S. aureus isolates responsible for bloodstream infections in intensive care units in 2003. Nineteen isolates were susceptible to methicillin and 13 MRSA isolates had characteristics of the MRSA Lyon clone (sequence type 8, agr allele type 1 and positive for the sea gene). The binding behaviour onto airway epithelial cells (HAECs) were determined by quantifying the number of adherent bacteria per cell (30 cells per strain were used). The adhesin gene profile (bbp, can, eno, ebpS, fib, clfA, clfB, fnbA and fnbB) was determined with multiplex PCR for each isolates. The dysfunction of agr was detected by the absence of delta-haemolysin production. Results: The number of S. aureus isolates per cell was more homogeneous for MSSA isolates than MRSA isolates, but the adhesion of MRSA isolates was significantly higher than MSSA isolates (68.94 \u00b1 8.483 and 34.31 \u00b1 3.446, respectively, p < 0.001) (Figure) . MRSA isolates were all positive for eno, fib, clfA, clfB, fnbA and fnbB, only. MSSA isolates were all positive for eno, clfA, clfB and fnbB and inconstantly positive for others. The absence of delta-haemolysin production tended to be more frequent among MRSA isolates (7/13 versus 16/19 isolates), but the difference was not significant (p = 0.11). No correlation between the adhesive property and the absence of deltahaemolysin production was observed, both in MRSA and in MSSA isolates.",

Objectives: Although many distinct genetic lineages of communityassociated MRSA (CA-MRSA) have been reported worldwide, one clone has proved highly successful in the USA. The ST8-SCCmec IVa (or socalled USA-300) clone has been associated with community outbreaks, nosocomial transmission, and identified as the primary cause of skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) presenting to Emergency Departments across the USA. Following enhanced surveillance for CA-MRSA, and in the light of these observations, we have mapped the epidemiology of this clone in England and Wales. Methods: Over a 2 year period (2004/5), all MRSAs referred to the national Staphylococcus Reference Unit for England and Wales were characterised microbiologically. Isolates identified as CA-MRSA were subjected to detailed characterisation (including MLST, spa typing, toxin gene profiling, PFGE and antibiotic susceptibility testing). Epidemiologic, demographic and clinical data were also collated. Results: Of ca. 300 CA-MRSA identified, 40 belonged to the ST8-SCCmecIVa clonal lineage; the third most common CA-MRSA occurring nationally. All 40 isolates were PVL-positive, spa t008 and belonged to agr group 1. Nine different sub-types were distinguishable by PFGE; almost half belonged to a single pulsotype. All were resistant to b-lactams; resistance to erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, tetracycline and fusidic acid was variable. All were susceptible to clindamycin, trimethoprim, vancomycin, linezolid and mupirocin. The majority of patients (32, 80%) were community-based, including 23 males and 17 females; ages ranged from <1 to 89 y (median 25 y). 60% presented with skin infections (e.g. boils, abscesses or insect bites) and 25% with soft tissue infections. One patient died. Most cases were sporadic, but 4 community-based clusters were identified involving MSMs, household contacts and individuals attending the same GP surgery. Eight patients gave a history of foreign travel (e.g. the USA), the remainder were acquired domestically.",

Whilst numbers remain small, the occurrence of community-based clusters and the death of one patient give cause for concern. The emergence of resistance to multiple classes of antimicrobials allied to evidence of clonal expansion highlight the need for continued surveillance to underpin effective therapeutic and infection control strategies. On secondary efficacy endpoints, the three treatment arms were similar in terms of clinical and mycological response, and there were no significant differences in the incidence of emergent fungal infections during the study and in the incidence of relapse post-treatment. There were no clinically significant differences between the three treatment arms in terms of adverse events, including those of special interest, such as hepatic and renal function adverse events. The incidence of death during treatment was similar across treatment groups. Conclusion: MICA100 and MICA150 were equally effective and were non-inferior to CAS on the primary efficacy endpoint of treatment success as defined by the investigator. There were no significant differences between the MICA treatment arms and CAS on all secondary endpoints. All three treatment regimens had similar safety profiles. Objective: To compare the efficacy and safety of micafungin (MICA) with AmBisome \u00ae (L-AmB) in a paediatric subpopulation in a large, randomised, phase III trial in patients with invasive candidiasis or candidaemia. Methods: In this double-blind, multicentre study, non-neutropaenic and neutropaenic paediatric patients aged 15 years with clinical and microbiological evidence of invasive candidiasis or candidaemia were randomised 1:1 to receive intravenous MICA (2 mg/kg/day) or L-AmB (3 mg/kg/day) for a minimum of 14 days. All randomised patients were included in the full analysis set (FAS). Efficacy analyses were also performed for the per protocol set (PPS), which included all patients who had confirmed invasive candidiasis or candidaemia but did not have a further invasive infection caused by a non-Candida fungal pathogen, for whom the investigator's assessment of overall treatment success at the end of therapy (EOT) was available, and who received at least five doses of study drug and did not receive a prohibited antifungal medication. The safety set included all FAS patients. Overall treatment success was based on clinical and mycological response at the end of therapy, as assessed by the investigator. The post-treatment follow-up period was 12 weeks. Results: A total of 106 patients (52 MICA and 54 L-AmB patients) were included in the FAS; 83 patients were included in the PPS. Age groups, including prematurity at birth, were well represented; candidaemia was the primary infection in the majority of patients in both treatment groups. The key efficacy results are shown in the table. The incidence of treatment-related adverse events (AEs) was lower with MICA than with L-AmB (36.5% versus 42.6%, respectively), as was the incidence of serious AEs (3.8% versus 9.3%, respectively). In addition, fewer patients receiving MICA than L-AmB discontinued therapy because of AEs (3.8% versus 16.7%, respectively). One cipro-resistant isolate (MIC > 32) was isolated from a cipro-treated subject. 9 levo subjects were clinical successes, 2 were failures. With cipro, 7 subjects were clinical successes, 2 were failures and for 3, the outcome was unknown. The urine pathogen was eradicated in 10 and was unknown for 1 levo subject compared to eradicated in 7, persisted in 3, and unknown in 2 cipro-treated subjects. A repeat blood culture was obtained for 7 levo and 8 cipro subjects, with the blood pathogen eradicated in all subjects. For one other cipro-treated subject, the blood pathogen was presumed persisted based on clinical failure. The outcome for the cipro-resitant E. coli was unknown. Conclusions: For the overall population (cUTI and AP) and for the cUTI and AP cohorts. 5 doses of levo were non-inferior to 20 doses of cipro. Levo and cipro eradicated blood pathogens in all subjects who had a 2nd blood culture. Approximately two-thirds of patients were from the USA; the remainder were recruited from Canada, Australia, South Africa, Russia and various other countries across Europe, Asia and South America. Patients with infections due to MRSA tended to be younger (<65 years of age) and a greater proportion were of Black race compared with patients with infections not due to MRSA (non-MRSA; Table) . MRSA was most commonly associated with major abscesses, whereas non-MRSA was most commonly associated with deep/extensive cellulitis. Regardless of MRSA status, cSSSI occurred more frequently on the lower extremities. Conclusion: Together, ATLAS 1 and 2 represent the largest prospective, double-blind studies ever conducted in patients with cSSSIs. The MRSA cohort was also the largest ever enrolled in a registrational programme. MRSA infections appeared to be more common in patients who were younger, of Black racial origin, and in those with a major abscess compared with patients with infections not due to MRSA. Objectives: The use of aminoglycosides has decreased due to doubts regarding lack of efficacy and adverse effects. Yet, the prevalence of microbial resistance to aminoglycosides has remained low. This study sought to compare the efficacy and adverse effects of aminoglycosides as a single antibiotic to other antibiotics for the treatment of patients with infection.",

Two reviewers assessed trial eligibility, quality and extract data. Pooled relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated for dichotomous data. We conclude that each of the three major clones can readily be demarcated from other A. baumannii members, and that molecular diagnostics could be developed to identify them rapidly. Analysis of the recombination/mutation rate shows that nucleotides do not change by recombination more frequently than by mutation, showing that recombination is unlikely to disrupt the clonal frame of the clones, which can therefore be expected to be stable over very long periods of time. Objectives: Molecular epidemiology studies of clinically relevant microorganisms frequently focus on a comparison between the assigned types of different typing methods. Therefore, there is a critical need to understand the correspondence between types produced by different methods. This may be useful not only for the comparison of the genetic backgrounds of the particular set of isolates under study but also to produce a broader view of how the results of the different typing methods are related. To achieve this goal, a framework of measures for the quantitative comparison of typing methods results was developed (Carri\u00e7o et al., Illustration of a common framework for relating multiple typing methods by application to macrolide-resistant Streptococcus pyogenes, J. Clin. Microbiol. 2006) and is now implemented in a free-access web-based interface, on which users can analyse their data anonymously and retrieve the results. Methods: To facilitate the use of the framework developed, a web-based interface was implemented to provide researchers with a user-friendly interface to compare their typing methods results. On the website, we also provide a set of Bionumerics TM scripts to allow the users to implement the proposed analysis on their Bionumerics databases while offline.",

Furthermore, as new microbial typing methods are proposed, this methodology allows for their comparison in terms of type assignments with established methodologies. Despite several case control studies and enhanced surveillance of both human cases and animal environmental isolates, there is still much unknown about the epidemiology of Campylobacter infection. We describe a multi-agency project evaluating the utility of sequence typing of human infection isolates to inform surveillance and distinguish environmental sources of human infection. Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) developed for C. jejuni and C. coli was applied to all human case isolates from four local authorities in North West England, two largely rural and two largely urban, over a continuous 3-year period. Isolates from drinking water supplies and recreational surface waters were also sequence typed. We describe here an analysis of the three year study data and steps taken to adapt the methodology for use in routine surveillance settings. The study has demonstrated several interesting correlations between specific sequence types and a number of explanatory variables for disease (eg month of infection, locality of residence, and travel abroad).",

R. felis, a flea-transmitted spotted fever, and R. parkeri, a tick-transmitted spotted fever, have been shown since to infect human beings in the USA and in Urugay. Moreover, R. africae has been found in patients in West Indies. Many Rickettsia have been identified in ticks but have not been currently found in patients.

            "text": "In recent years, the rules for selection of antimicrobial agents have been undergoing critical revision in terms of optimum dosing for control of infectious diseases, with the goal of potentiating treatment efficacy and reducing the risk of selecting multidrug resistant pathogens. The most important criterion for rational choice of an antimicrobial agent is defined by its pharmacodynamic (PD) characteristics, and thus its antimicrobial activity which can be summarised as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC). The second criterion for selecting an antibiotic is due to its pharmacokinetic (PK) characteristics, since it has been demonstrated that antibiotic concentrations at the infection site influence the intensity and duration of the effect, and together with the PD parameters, provide a general inter-relationship and contribute to defining the potential clinical efficacy of a drug. Pharmacodynamics have been upgraded in the last 10 years with in vitro and animal models which have helped to identify fairly precise correlations with therapeutic efficacy of antibiotics. Moreover, the principles that link concentrations of antibiotics in humans and their effects have been outlined in order to determine the optimal dosing interval. Antimicrobial drugs with a concentration-dependent activity, i.e. the newer quinolones and aminoglycosides, should be administered as a single daily dose to maximise the peak serum concentration/MIC ratio. AUC/MIC ratio is also an important parameter for PK/PD correlations. Existing data on fluoroquinolones suggest that a ratio of 100-125 correlates with high bacterial eradication and optimal clinical outcome in infections due to Gram-negative pathogens, while a ratio of 50 is associated with a high probability of eradication of S. pneumoniae strains. For this group of antibiotics the new concept of the so called mutant prevention concentration (MPC) and mutant selection window (MSW) may be helpful in restricting the enrichment of mutant subpopulations and consequently, at least partially, in controlling the spread of resistance. Beta-lactams, having time-dependent efficacy, usually do not have great post antibiotic effects (PAEs), and the parameter which seems to better correlate PD with PK is the time duration with concentrations higher than the MIC (T > MIC). These antibiotics need to be given with short dosing intervals or even by continuous infusion to maintain plasma levels exceeding the MIC for a sufficiently long period.",

Surveillance of antibiotic susceptibility is a key element to provide updated information on the magnitude and trends in resistance, and to plan and monitor intervention strategies aimed at preserving the therapeutic efficacy of antibiotics. In low-resource countries, effective surveillance programmes are difficult to implement for a number of reasons, including scarce financial resources, lack of laboratory facilities and, where laboratories do exist, lack of quality control, reliable reagents and adequate supervision. In these settings, the development of reliable and low-cost alternative methods could facilitate the implementation of large-scale surveillance. There is an increasing agreement about the importance of extending the surveillance of antibiotic resistance to the commensal microbiota of humans and animals. This bacterial population, although not being a specific target, is continuously exposed to the selective pressure generated by antimicrobial chemotherapy and may become a potential reservoir of resistant strains that can cause infections, and of resistance determinants that can be transferred to pathogenic bacteria. Therefore, surveillance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria carried by healthy individuals is considered an indicator of the spread of antibiotic resistance that could also be useful to predict the emergence of resistance in pathogenic bacteria. In this perspective, resistance patterns of some members of the commensal microbiota, such as the faecal Escherichia coli, have been evaluated in various epidemiological settings. For this purpose, different microbiological approaches have been implemented and evaluated as useful tools to conduct large scale resistance surveillance studies and to monitor resistance control programmes in a cost-effective manner.",

Soon after their discovery, phenotypic methods were developed for their detection and confirmation. Confirmation depended largely on the ability of clavulanate to inhibit the main culprit enzymes at the time, the TEM and SHV variants. Later this technique proved reliable for CTX-M type enzymes. Many susceptibility testing methods recommended the use of ESBL screening and confirmation tests on a routine basis, including CLSI, BSAC, CA-SFM, and SRGA.

Ideally, one should include a minimum of 4, namely cefpodoxime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone or cefotaxime, and aztreonam, and at concentrations that often differ from those used for susceptibility breakpoints. 2. The lack of reliable phenotypic methods to detect ESBLs in species with inducible AmpC b-lactamases. Some of these species have been shown to be important reservoirs for ESBLs, and resistance to extended-spectrum cephalosporins cannot solely attributed to stable de-repression of AmpC. 3. The failure of current methods to provide advice on the interpretation of a positive screening test but a negative confirmation test, especially if the isolates are \"susceptible\" to extended-spectrum cephalosporins using method-recommended breakpoints. Such strains have been shown to harbour OXA enzymes, inhibitor-resistant TEM enzymes, or particularly plasmid-borne AmpC enzymes with significant frequency. Thus there is no current phenotypic or genotypic test that can be practically and effectively applied in the routine laboratory with sufficient sensitivity to detect the emerging range of transmissible enzymes. However, we can rely to a great extent on the selection of or change to appropriate susceptibility breakpoints. A range of recent studies has suggested that failures of treatment with extendedspectrum cephalosporins are likely when strains of Enterobacteriaceae have MICs elevated above the wild-type. Further, application of pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) principles to the most widely recommended dosing schedules of cephalosporins suggest that the susceptibility breakpoints recommended by many methods are too high, and should to lowered to values that fortunately coincide wild-type cutoff values. Hence, lowering of susceptibility breakpoints for extendedspectrum cephalosporins to those defined by PK/PD will indicate the presence of an ESBL or plasmid-borne AmpC enzyme with sufficiently high likelihood to allow laboratories to report both resistance to these agents and provide advice about appropriate infection control procedures. Objectives: Since antibiotic resistance often is associated with a biological fitness cost for bacteria it is assumed that a reduction of antibiotic use is followed by a reduction in resistance rates. Over the last 10 years trimethoprim (TRI) resistance in Escherichia coli has increased in Sweden. In Kronoberg county the TRI resistance has increased from Antibiotic usage S33 7% (1990) to 11% (2004). So far no prospective intervention in the community has been carried out to investigate whether a substantial decrease of the use of a single antibiotic will result in a corresponding decrease in antibiotic resistance. Method and Material: Physicians (n = 564) in county Kronoberg (approx. 180,000 population), Sweden, were convinced, by personal visits and mail, to cease their use of TRI and cotrimoxazole during two years starting October 1st 2004. Monthly sales data for oral antibiotics were retrieved from the National Corporation of Swedish Pharmacies and made known to the physicians. All E. coli isolated from urinary tract specimens at the Dept of Clin Microb, V\u00e4xj\u00f6, were included in the analysis. The susceptibility testing methodology was stable since 1990 and the baseline consisted of quantitative data from 1990-2004.",

Results: An immediate and sustained decrease of 85% in total use of TRI was achieved. TRI use was in most cases replaced by mecillinam (MEC), nitrofurantoin (NIT) and ciprofloxacin. The total decrease in antibiotics used for UTI treatment was 4%. Resistance to TRI did not decrease (10% and 12% in 2005 and 2006, respectively). Resistance to NIT and MEC did not increase despite the substantial increase in the use of these drugs, 31% and 69%, respectively. Resistance to fluoroquinolones (FQ) increased from 4% to 10% between 2000 and 2006. The phenotypic diversity index was 0.954 in the period prior to the intervention, 0.964 during the first 4 months and 0.949 during the last 4 months of the intervention. Conclusion: A substantial and sustained decrease in the use of TRI in a 180,000 population did not result in any drastic changes in resistance rates. Whether the increase in FQ-resistance was related to the increase in use remains to be evaluated. The diversity index, based on E. coli phenotypes, was stable indicating that the intervention did not favour any certain clone to expand in the community. Objectives: Increasing use of antibiotics and spread of resistant pneumococcal clones in the beginning of the 90ies alarmed the medical profession and medical authorities in Sweden. A coordinated effort to prevent further spread and preserve the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents was therefore initiated Methods: Strama (The Swedish strategic programme for the rational use of antimicrobial agents and surveillance of resistance) was initiated in 1994. The Strama network includes a broad representation of medical disciplines, professional organisations and relevant authorities. The programme includes surveillance of antibiotic use and resistance, implementation of rational use of antibiotics and development of new knowledge. The main goal is to preserve the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents. Results: Yearly validated data on antibiotic use and resistance were made publicly available on a website. Multidisciplinary Strama-groups were formed in each county to disseminate knowledge and implement rational antibiotic use.

There is limited variation in the use of different antibiotic groups in most hospitals -a risk factor for emergence of antibiotic resistance. Our web-based PPS provides a tool for quality assessment of antibiotic prescribing in European hospitals. Methods: Face to face structured interviews were conducted in 11 countries (Austria, The Netherlands, Sweden, UK, Belgium, Italy, Malta, Israel, Czech Republic, Lithuania and Croatia). The study population included respondents of our previous survey who agreed to be interviewed. We aimed to recruit at least 100 respondents in each country, including a group of users of self-medication and non-users. Scales were grouped based on theoretical concepts and confirmed by factor analysis. The four scales were: attitudes towards appropriateness of self-medication with antibiotics for bronchitis, beliefs about antibiotics for minor ailments, attitudes towards situational use of antibiotics and knowledge about antibiotics and viruses or bacteria. Knowledge of antibiotic resistance was measured by an open-ended question. Analysis: To deal with the possible confounding effect of both use of selfmedication and education, we performed stratified analyses, i.e., we studied the differences between countries separately for users and non-users of self-medication, and for respondents with high and low education. The differences between countries were considered relevant when regression coefficients were significant in all stratum-specific analyses. Objective: Antimicrobial resistance to ciprofloxacin, a valuable secondline antibiotic, is increasing. To limit this increase the appropriate use of ciprofloxacin should be encouraged. The objective of this study was to reduce the number of inappropriate prescriptions and improve the quality of ciprofloxacin prescriptions by way of educational intervention. Methods: Five units (197 beds) of the departments of Internal Medicine, Gastro-Enterology, Surgery, Urology and Pulmonary Diseases, selected because of a high rate of ciprofloxacin prescription, participated in a prospective intervention study. The study comprised three periods of three months: 2 observation periods (phase 1 and 3) and an intervention period (phase 2). A follow up of 3 months was done 9 months after start of intervention. During the two observation periods all ciprofloxacin prescriptions were registered and the quality of each ciprofloxacin prescription was evaluated in a standardised manner by two experts in infectious diseases independently. During the intervention period physicians prescribing ciprofloxacin were interviewed by a medical microbiologist, and educational presentations were given to physicians of the participating units. Results: During phase 1 491 prescriptions per 1000 admissions of ciprofloxacin were written, declining to 184 prescriptions per 1000 admissions in phase 3, a reduction of 62.5%. The greatest reduction was observed in units of the Departments of Surgery and Urology (83.9% and 75.6% respectively), mainly due to a reduction of erratic prophylactic use. Unjustified prescriptions (no use of antibiotics indicated) decreased with 25.9%. Inappropriate prescriptions (wrong choice of antibiotic or duration of prescription) declined from 69.5% to 57.7%, mainly due to the decrease of ciprofloxacin courses of too long duration. Appropriate prescriptions increased with 33.5%. Nine months after intervention 136 prescriptions per 1000 admissions of ciprofloxacin were prescribed, a total reduction of 72.3%.",

Conclusions: Amphotericin B at 1mg/kg/d with flucytosine is more rapidly fungicidal in the treatment of HIV-associated cryptococcal meningitis compared to standard dose amphotericin B. Increasing the dose of amphotericin B did not result in a clinically significant increase in nephrotoxicity. Cases diagnosed by culture and confirmed by restriction fragment length polymorphism as C. gattii and HIV negative cases diagnosed by serology and histopathology with no exposure to international endemic areas were included. Cases reported to provincial authorities between 1999 and 2006 were interviewed to determine clinical presentation and epidemiological characteristics. Frequencies were calculated based on denominators available using SPSS \u00ae v14.0. As of November 16 2006, 162 cases of locally-acquired cases of C. gattii infection occurred in BC with an annual provincial average of 6.3 cases/million population. Mean age was 59 years (2\u221292 years) and 56% were male. 16 cases (10%) were asymptomatic. 2 (1%) had dermatological findings. Most common symptoms included cough (46%), shortness of breath (44%), fever and night sweats (both 35%). Chest X-rays revealed nodules in 65 cases (66%) and infiltrates in 14 cases (14%). 19 cases (30%) were on oral steroids in the year prior to diagnosis and 50 (49%) were current smokers. Only 5 (4%) were HIV positive, 3 (3%) were organ transplant recipients, 30 (31%) had a chronic lung disease and 26 (26%) had a history of cancer. 103 cases (64%) were culture-confirmed as C. gattii and 81 isolates (79%) were genotyped as VGIIa. 4 cases (3%) died due to their C. gattii infection. Most cases were treated with fluconazole and amphotericin B for several months. Most cases were exposed on Vancouver Island but the range of the fungus has spread over the years and 4 recent cases were exposed on the BC mainland. Clinicians should be aware that C. gattii can be acquired in Canada and that the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of this disease differ from C. neoformans. Objectives: The incidence of invasive zygomycosis (IZ) appears to be increasing, especially in patients treated for haematological malignancy. Presently, no biological markers exsist that facilitate early diagnosis, and one has to rely on conventional diagnostic methods, such as culture, which lack sensitivity. We investigated the presence of zygomyceteantigen (zAg) and zygomycete DNA in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of patients with documented IZ and of those at risk for this disease. Methods: BALF of 18 neutropaenic patients, who underwent a bronchoscopy on suspicion of invasive fungal infection (IFI), was investigated for the presence of water-soluble somatic zAg by immunoblotting with a commercially available monoclonal antibody (anti-Rhizomucor, Dakocytomation, Denmark). Five of 18 patients had proven IZ. Of the remaining 13 patients without documented IZ, 8 had proven or probable invasive aspergillosis (IA). BALF from 10 non-haematology patients was used as control. BALF samples were also investigated for presence of zygomycete DNA by PCR, using 18S primers. Results: The BALF of the 5 patients with proven IZ were positive for zAg. In the remaining 13 neutropaenic patients, zAg was detected in BALF of 7. Four of these had probable or proven IA The number of zAg positive BALF from neutropaenic patients with suspected IFI was higher than in the control group (7 of 13 versus 1 of 10, P < 0.002). Zygomycete DNA was detected in 11 of 12 BALF samples positive for zAG, and all BALF samples negative for zAg were also negative for zygomycete DNA by PCR. Conclusion: zAg and zygomycete DNA are present in BALF of patients with IZ, and might be a useful tool for early diagnosis. The presence of both markers in BALF samples from high-risk patients without a clinically manifest disease might indicate the presence of colonisation or subclinical infection. Results: All the strains tested were able to form biofilm in all the media tested. However, differences were detected between the different media. The isolates were able to form biofilm faster in Middlebrook 7H9 (100% of surface covered in day 28 for all the strains) than in tap water (100% of surface covered in day 63 for all the strains). The day 70 none of strains covered all the surface when using PBS-5% glucose. No difference was found between species in biofilm development.",

Higher local Ca 2+ concentration, as well as strengthened bacterial aggregation, may lead to increased crystal formation. Bacteria may adhere to crystals, additionally to the later mechanism due to biofilm formation. In crystallisation process, bacteria were embedded into the crystal structure.

Three key properties of this antigen are that it is highly immunogenic, it is not found in BCG or many environmental mycobacteria, and it is a key virulence factor. Its immunogenicity and specificity led to a series of studies to assess its potential as a major component of new diagnostic tests. Such tests have evolved into two major forms-a whole blood assay marketed under the name Quantiferon and an ELISPOT assay marketed under the name T-spot. New antigens have been assessed for improved test performance, most notably CFP-10. Studies of in-house versions of these assays, and more recently the commercial kits, have shown encouraging results in TB cases for the diagnosis of disease and in their close contacts for the diagnosis of M. tuberculosis infection. It is clear that these tests are not confounded by prior BCG vaccination and are probably not subject to boosting by injected tuberculin. Their quantitative readouts may also provide important information with respect to infectious load. However, some findings have caused concern: disparity in test performance between temperate non-TB endemic and tropical TB-endemic settings, evidence of relatively poor sensitivity to the presence of certain M. tuberculosis strains (eg. M. africanum) and in certain sub-groups (eg. Pulmonary TB, certain TB contacts), and rapid unexplained test reversion. It is therefore becoming clear that T cell assays may have a niche in the diagnosis of certain TB cases and in certain individuals suspected of having M. tuberculosis infection, but this niche has not yet been fully defined. More longitudinal studies, especially following TB case contacts for the development of disease, are indicated. Also more studies should be undertaken in TB endemic areas. Finally, if these tests are to have any role in TB control globally they would need to be much cheaper and more easy to use. Some advances with respect to these two issues have already taken place.",

Three classes of drugs have been contributed to this success: the nucleoside (NRTI) and the nonnucleoside (NNRTI) reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and the protease inhibitors (PI). With the advent of the fusion inhibitor enfuvirtide (T20) the field has been opened for new classes of drugs. During the last year a whole bundle of drugs with new targets has been studied in humans. Among the most developed compounds are CCR5 antagonists and integrase inhibitors. Other classes in earlier phases of clinical development include attachment inhibitors and maturation inhibitors. It is expected, that integrase inhibitors and CCR5-antagonists will be introduced into clinical practice in 2007/2008. Both of these drug classes have been first studied in heavily treatment experienced patients having failed NRTI, NNRTI and PI therapy. In preliminary analyses the integrase inhibitor MK-0518 combined with optimised background treatment (OBT) has shown clinical superiority over OBT alone.

Preliminary data also suggest a high virological potency of the drug in treatment na\u00efve patients. MK-0518 was applied bid and was well tolerated in both pretreated an treatment na\u00efve patients. Two CCR5 antagonists are currently studied in clinical trials, maraviroc and vicriviroc. Vicriviroc together with OBT has shown superiority over OBT alone in treatment experienced patients, but has failed in a phase II study in treatment na\u00efve patients presumably due to matters of dosing. Further studies to define the optimal dose (together with ritonavir boosting) are underway. With maraviroc results of a study in treatment experienced patients exhibiting dual tropic virus (R5/X4) are available. In this population, maraviroc did not show additional virological efficacy over placebo, but lead to a greater increase of CD4 cells.",

Current antiretroviral regimens however cannot achieve virus eradication and virological rebound virtually always occurs after therapy discontinuation. Long-term highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is life saving, but poses several challenges. Potential adverse events can be categorised as problems related to adherence, pharmacokinetics, toxicity and drug resistance. Various interventions have been explored to improve and maintain good adherence among treated individuals, ranging from treatment simplification strategies to addressing mental health problems, and a major challenge is related to the need for integrated biomedical, social and behavioural interventions. Inadequate adherence however accounts for only a subset of subtherapeutic drug levels in clinical practice. There is a significant degree of inter-individual variability in absorption, metabolism and cellular transport of antiretroviral drugs, with potential impact on both efficacy and toxicity of therapy. Important determinants include gender, age, ethnic origin, and genetic polymorphisms. Although evidence of the influence of pharmacogenomics is growing, there remain limited data to guide clinical practice. Proton pump inhibitors are an example of commonly prescribed medications that can affect antiretroviral drug levels by reducing the absorption of certain protease inhibitors (PIs) and increasing exposure to others. Herbal medicines such as St. John's wort, widely used by HIV patients, also have the potential to interact with antiretroviral drugs. Thus, patient education and good communication across care providers are paramount to prevent unfavourable drug-drug interactions.",

Major examples of HAART-related toxicity include mitochondrial damage and lipoatrophy associated with the use of nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), and fat accumulation, dyslipidaemia and insulin resistance associated with the protease inhibitors (PIs). The risk of cardiovascular disease is a particular concern, due to the combined effects on the cardiovascular system of HIV infection, HAART and lifestyle related risk factors such as smoking which are common among HIVinfected persons. In addition, renal, hepatic and bone toxicity represent emerging side effects of long-term treatment. Patients starting therapy on recommended first-line regimens achieve a high degree of virological and immunological success. However, drug resistance continues to emerge as a result of problems with adherence and tolerability. Furthermore, there remain a large number of HIV-infected persons who have accumulated drug resistance through mono and dual therapy in the pre-HAART era and the suboptimal use of therapy in the early HAART era. In addition, a substantial proportion of newly infected persons acquire drug-resistant virus. New drugs and drug classes are required to optimise treatment among drug-experienced persons and reduce the risk of side effects. Several new compounds have recently entered clinical use that show improved tolerability profile or activity against drug resistant virus. Improved methods for detecting and interpreting drug resistance are also being developed to adequately guide treatment. In spite of these concerns however, the benefits of HAART far outweigh the risk of adverse events. The results strongly suggest that keratinocytes are able to produce cytokines in response to L. major stimulation through in part-TLR-2.",

Immunocompetent and non-atopic subjects are relatively resistant to A. fumigatus diseases and disease occurs in the setting of host damage. The inherent resistance to diseases caused by A. fumigatus suggests the occurrence of regulatory mechanisms that provide the host with adequate defence without necessarily eliminating the fungus or causing unacceptable levels of host damage. Respiratory tolerance is mediated by plasmacytoid dendritic cells producing IL-10 and inducing the development of CD4+ T regulatory cells expressing FoxP3 and regulating inflammation and allergy through the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO)-dependent pathway.

New foci have been discovered in China/Tibet with a prevalence rate of up to 4% of the affected population. Imaging techniques, such as Ultrasound, CT, MRI and PET/CT contributed to a much better description of the lesions. However, the expertise of the radiologist is often not available due to the low incidence of AE. Serology is helpful, but may be misleading due to non-standardised tests.

Current antifilarial drug therapies target only the first stage larvae, requiring many years of annual/biannual treatment. Another problem with controlling filarial infections is the lack of any alternative drugs that can be used in the current mass drug administration programmes should resistance develop. Wolbachia, endosymbiotic bacteria that are found in most of the human filarial worms are excellent targets for the discovery of new antifilarial drugs because of their requirement for worm embryogenesis, development and adult survival. In both lymphatic filariasis and onchocerciasis, administration of 6 weeks of doxycline at a dose of 200 mg/day results in a high macrofilaricidal effect of over 80% and 70%, respectively. Targeting of Wolbachia with antirickettsial drugs has lead to the recommendation of doxycycline for use on an individual basis and may be recommended in areas where resistance to current drugs may develop. Evidence that eliminating the endobacteria reduces adverse reactions to current drug therapies and even reduces early stages of lymphatic pathology is also accruing. Research is underway to discover new drugs, preferably those already approved for use in humans, that have antiwolbachial activity and work in a shorter time and are widely applicable. vancomycin MIC: 2 and 16 mg/l, respectively) to study their ability to (i) adhere to fibrinogen (Fg) and fibronectin (Fn) in vitro, (ii) persist in the bloodstream after intravenous inoculation, (iii) colonise aortic vegetations in rats, (iv) multiply in situ thereafter, and (v) compete for valve colonisation when inoculated in mixed cultures. Methods: GISA M1V16 was selected by vancomycin exposure of the glycopeptide-susceptible, methicillin-resistant S. aureus M1V2 (agr type II) in the laboratory. The phenotypic expression of resistance to vancomycin and the stability of the phenotype was analysed by population analysis. Adherence was tested on immobilised Fg and Fn. Rats with catheter-induced aortic vegetations were inoculated with 10 3 \u221210 6 CFU of the test strains. Rats were killed after 24 h. Vegetations and spleens were cultured and the lower inoculum infecting 90% of vegetations (ID90) was recorded. Blood cultures were drawn within the first 60 min. Infectivity was also compared by co-inoculation with 10\u00d7 the ID90 of M1V16 and a rifampin-resistant variant of the parent M1V2, to discriminate them in organ cultures. Results: The GISA M1V16 mutant grew on plates containing 16 mg/l of vancomycin and its resistance phenotype remained stable after 5 passages on drug-free medium. Both GISA and parent strains adhered similarly to Fg and Fn in vitro. In rats, the GISA M1V16 was cleared faster from the blood (P < 0.005) and required 100\u00d7 more bacteria than the parent (10 6 versus 10 4 CFU) to infect 90% of animals. GISA M1V16 had also 100-1000\u00d7 lower bacterial densities in vegetations and spleen. After co-inoculation, M1V2 and GISA M1V16 produce similar vegetation densities early after injection. However, while the vegetation counts of the parent increased at 48, 72 and 120 h, the counts of GISA M1V16 remained stable. Conclusions: GISA showed attenuated pathogenicity (ID90) and fitness (intra-vegetation growth) in rats with experimental endocarditis. Thus, the GISA phenotype is globally detrimental to infectivity. This might explain its clustering in immuno-compromised patients. Whether a very prolonged exposure to glycopeptides might restore pathogenicity and fitness defects remains to be determined. Most adult cystic fibrosis (CF) patients are chronically infected with P. aeruginosa in their lungs. Two major features of P. aeruginosa are the abillities to form biofilms and become mucoid. Recently, we reported a time-dependent reduction in the ability to form biofilm by non-mucoid P. aeruginosa isolates from the same CF patient obtained over a period of 23 years. In order to investigate whether the declined ability of the PFGEidentical isolates to form biofilm in vitro correlated to pathogenicity in vivo, 5 non-mucoid clones from 1980 and 1988 (early clones), and 1997, 1999 and 2003 (late clones) embedded in alginate were installed in the lungs of five groups of BALB/c mice. Mice were sacrificed after 5 days of infection. The experiment was evaluated by macroscopic lung pathology, histopathology, quantitative bacteriology (CFU/lung) and pulmonary cytokine production. Survival was significantly higher in mice infected with the late clones, as compared to mice infected with the early clones (p < 0.025).",

Methods: A panel of 118 isolates of S. enterica resistant to nalidixic acid and with concomitant decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin (MIC: 0.25\u22121.0 mg/L), from cases of human infection and from foods in England and Wales, were screened for the presence of qnrA, qnrB and qnrS by PCR. Isolated qnr plasmid was tested by PCR genes and for ESBL genes, and for 18 commonly occurring replicons. All strains positive for qnr genes were further characterised by PFGE. Results: All isolates were negative for qnrA and qnrB; 6 isolates belonging to four serovars (S. Stanley, 2; S. Typhimurium, 1; S. Virginia, 1; S. Virchow, 2) were positive for qnrS.

A sensitive ligation-step ensures specificity of the assay. We designed MLPA-probes specific for a range of discriminatory SNPs in MTB. In addition, we selected three sequences of conserved regions to use as internal controls and for quantitation. The size of MLPA-products corresponds to the specific SNP they targeted. Amplified MLPA-products were identified on an agarose-gel or by fragment analysis, using capillary electrophoresis. Results: Probes were initially validated on DNA from reference strains. All probes were then combined in a single mixture and used to characterise laboratory strains and a panel of clinical isolates from Brazil, Peru and the Netherlands.

All strains were assigned to phylogenetic groups by means of a triplex PCR protocol. In order to compare isolates from different groups and susceptibilities, a similar and as large a number as possible of susceptible and resistant strains were chosen randomly from groups A (23; 27), B1 (7; 11), B2 (17; 9), and D (15; 25). The occurrence of different VF was determined by use of PCR and summarised for each isolate as a VF score. Moreover, the mutation frequency was determined by plating on 100 mg/L rifampicin containing agar. Results: Assignation to phylogenetic groups confirmed differences between susceptible and resistant isolates in the distribution among phylogenetic groups: 82 out of 146 susceptible isolates belonged to group B2, in contrast to just 9 out of 135 resistant isolates, with a majority of 61 isolates belonging to group D. The VF score was highest both in strains belonging to groups B2 and D without significant differences between susceptible and resistant isolates. However, there was a small, but significant difference in the median of the mutation rates between the isolates of different groups, increasing in the order B2 < D < B1 < A. The median mutation rate of B2 isolates (1.3\u00d710 \u22128 ) differed significantly (P < 0.05) from the remaining isolates as did, conversely, that of the group A isolates (2.4\u00d710 \u22128 ). Conclusion: Slightly, but significantly reduced mutation rates in strains of the deep rooted phylogenetic group B2 might be an explanation for their rare occurrence among fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates. Objectives: Resistance to ceftazidime (CAZ) has mostly emerged among enzymes of CTX-M-1 lineage. The aim of this study was to understand evolution of CAZ resistance among CAZ susceptible ESBL belonging to this cluster by step-wise in vitro selection experiments. Methods: blaCTX-M-1, blaCTX-M-3 and blaCTX-M-10 genes were cloned into pBGS18 plasmid vector (KanR) using EcoRI and PstI restriction enzymes. Recombinant plasmids were further transformed into E. coli strain MI1443 (del-ampC, plasmid free) and its hypermutable isogenic strain GB20 (mutS::Tn10 MI1443). GB20 transformants corresponding to each ESBL were submitted to daily serial passages with increased concentrations of CAZ (0.5\u2212256 fold respect to MIC). Plasmids containing mutants obtained at distinct concentrations were transformed in MI1443 cells, selecting with CAZ (at 4\u00d7 their corresponding MIC). MICs to CAZ, cefotaxime (CTX), cefuroxime (CXM), cefepime (FEP), and amoxicillin-clavulanate (AMX) were determined in MI1443 carrying the different evolved and nonevolved recombinant plasmids. blaCTX-M genes from strains containing recombinant plasmids displaying reduced susceptibility to CAZ were sequenced. Results: A high frequency of CAZ mutants was detected (73%; 8/11 transformants tested) with significant increments in CAZ resistance. Interestingly, and with exception of two variants and CXM, a concomitant loss of resistance to all other antibiotics tested (antagonistic pleiotropy) was observed. All mutants contained new blaCTX-M variants except blaCTX-M-52, which evolved from blaCTX-M-3. The most frequent mutations found were D240G and P167S/T, the later conferring higher resistance to CAZ than the former. However, D240G change determined a lower decrease to FEP and CXM than P167S/T. Additionally, two variants were recovered from the evolved blaCTX-M-3 gene: P167S and P167S+A77V, found at 16 and 128 mg/L of CAZ respectively. The double mutant yielded higher resistance level to CAZ, CTX and to a lesser extent to FEP than P167S variant. The A77V change is one of the three polymorphisms between CTX-M-3 and CTX-M-1, whose mutants obtained revealed the highest resistance levels to CAZ and CTX in our study. Conclusions: This work demonstrates an antagonistic relationship between the susceptibility to CAZ and to other b-lactam antibiotics tested. A77V could be a secondary mutation site affecting CAZ or could be involved in re-equilibrium of CTXR/CAZR co-resistance. Objectives: Fluoroquinolone (FQ)-R group A Streptococcus (GAS) worldwide are predominantly of the emm6 serotype. Emm6 GAS are intrinsically low-level FQ-R due to a polymorphism in the FQbinding region in parC, which confers resistance to the older FQs like ciprofloxacin (CIP). The new respiratory's FQs, levofloxacin (LEV) and moxifloxacin (MOX), retain their activity against these first-step parC mutants, although there are concerns that their widespread use might select for second-step, high-level FQ-R mutants. LEV and MOX were introduced into clinical use in 1999 and 2002, respectively, in Belgium. We studied the prevalence and evolution of FQ-R GAS recovered from tonsillopharyngitis and invasive infections in Belgium during 2003-2005. Methods: From a total of 3765 isolates collected from 10 provinces during 2003\u221205, 261 (7%) isolates were resistant to CIP (MIC 2 mg/mL) and corroborated with MICs of 4 FQs in the presence or absence of reserpine. Clonality was studied by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and emm typing. Clonal isolates with CIP MIC 2 mg/mL were sequenced for mutations in the FQ binding regions of parC, gyrA, gyrB, and parE. Results: During 2003\u221205, FQ-R GAS increased from 2%, 5% to 16%. The predominant emm type was emm6, which formed 76% of the total FQ-R GAS during these three years. Emm6 and emm75 isolates together constituted 92% of the FQ-R GAS. Isolates with CIP MICs 2\u22128 mg/mL showed previously identified mutations in parC leading to amino acid substitutions as S79A (emm6) and S79Yor S79F (emm75), and no changes in gyrA, gyrB or parE. However, an emm6 throat isolate, recovered from a 36-year old female in 2005, exhibited highlevel resistance to CIP (MIC 32 mg/mL), full resistance to LEV (MIC 8 mg/mL) and decreased susceptibility to MOX (MIC 1 mg/mL). This isolate also showed a second-step mutation in the FQ-binding region in gyrA (predicted substitution S81Y). Reserpine-sensitive efflux was not observed for any FQ-R GAS. Conclusions: We report a dramatic increase in FQ-R GAS in 2005 in Belgium probably related to natural fluctuations of the low-level FQ-R emm6 clone. More importantly, we describe, for the first time, an emergence of high-level FQ resistance in a clinical emm6 isolate. Although respiratory FQs are usually not a therapeutic option for GAS infections, dissemination of this parC/gyrA double-mutant emm6 strain needs close monitoring. This method replaced phage typing in combination with SmaImacrorestriction analysis for routine S. aureus strain typing. This study reviews typing results for six month with respect to typeability, reproducibility, discriminatory power and concordance with alternative typing methods. Methods: A total of 1464 S. aureus isolates were characterised. The polymorphic X-region of the protein A gene was sequenced and a spa type was assigned using the Ridom StaphType software. The algorithm BURP (based upon repeat patterns) was used to cluster resulting spa types into different groups. To verify the results a subset of isolates was subjected to SmaI-macrorestriction analysis and MLST. Results: Among 1464 S. aureus isolates more than 200 different spa-types were defined. The twenty spa-types most frequently found comprise more than 60% of all isolates and include most types linked to predominant clonal lineages of MRSA in Central Europe, previously defined by phage typing and SmaI-macrorestriction analysis. Among those clonal lineages distinct differences in spa-type variability were seen; while some lineages (e. g. the Barnim epidemic MRSA, t032, ST22) encompassed a variety of closely related spa-types, others (e. g. a subclone of Rhine-Hesse epidemic MRSA, t003, ST225) are represented only by a single type. For assessment of widely disseminated lineages exhibiting only a single spa-type, additional markers must be applied. More than one hundred spa-types were determined only once. For these isolates BURP proved to be a valuable tool to assign them to particular clonal groups. Thereby, results of BURP grouping were overall concordant with those of SmaI-macrorestriction analysis and MLST. Conclusion: spa-typing in combination with BURP based grouping of isolates proved to be a valuable tool for strain typing with regard to the demands of a national reference centre. The BURP algorithm revealed extremely useful for grouping new and uncommon spa-types.",

In children, the majority of bacterial RTIs are caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (Pnc), Haemophilus influenzae (mostly nontypeable, NTHi) or both. In AOM, NTHi and Pnc are equally common. Pnc is slightly more 'aggressive' than NTHi (i.e. higher temperature, higher polymorphonuclear counts and complications are more frequent), but NTHi can still cause significant disease. The role of NTHi in recurrent and non-responsive AOM in both infants and in older children is recognized, suggesting different biological pathways compared with Pnc. In both acute and subacute sinusitis, NTHi is found as commonly as Pnc. NTHi is the most common causative agent of conjunctivitis and the most significant in relation to the co-presence of AOM and systemic symptoms and signs. The role of NTHi in LRIs in general, and in pneumonia in particular, is not yet clear. In cystic fibrosis, however, NTHi is an important pathogen. Although H. influenzae type b disease has practically been eliminated in vaccinated populations, the picture with S. pneumoniae in the 7-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine (PCV7) era is much more complex owing to its limited serotype coverage and some replacement with nonvaccine serotypes. A vaccine with additional pneumococcal serotypes and activity against NTHi would be a very welcome addition to our vaccine armamentarium.",

OM is caused by the synergistic interaction between upper respiratory tract viruses and three predominant bacterial species, all of which are members of the commensal flora of the paediatric nasopharynx. Despite their similar roles as opportunistic pathogens of the middle ear, the pathogenic mechanisms utilised by these bacteria (nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Moraxella catarrhalis) are unique. Thus, to date, most laboratories have investigated the pathogenesis and prevention of disease caused by these microbes individually. Recently, it has become appreciated that OM, and particularly chronic and recurrent OM, is a disease that includes a biofilm component. By definition, bacteria resident within a biofilm community are inherently resistant to eradication due to their significantly enhanced ability to resist the action of antibodies as well as antibiotics. Moreover, residence within a biofilm promotes the bacterial exchange of DNA, which confers resistance to antibiotics, and induces a markedly reduced bacterial growth rate that commonly results in false-negative bacterial cultures.",

This enhanced understanding of the biofilm component of middle ear infections is greatly influencing the current approaches to both the management of OM and the design of novel strategies to treat, or better to prevent, OM. It is particularly intriguing that some of the paediatric middle ear mucosa-derived biofilms characterised were of mixed bacterial aetiology, suggesting that progress made on single-microbe directed strategies for the treatment and/or prevention of OM, while highly encouraging, are also likely to be inadequate. Therefore, a significantly greater understanding of how microbial physiology relates to the involvement of biofilms in OM is required to identify points in the disease course that are perhaps more amenable to treatment strategies, and also biofilm-relevant antigenic targets that would be helpful in the rational design of vaccine candidates to prevent OM. Protein D (PD) is a highly conserved surface exposed 42 kDa lipoprotein found in 100% of all NTHi and encapsulated Hi, and is highly immunogenic in humans. Evidence suggests that PD is involved in the pathogenesis of respiratory tract infections, and has been implicated in NTHi adhesion and invasion of host cells. An isogenic PD-deficient NTHi-mutant, compared with the wild type strain, had an approximately 100-fold lower capacity to cause acute otitis media (OM) in rats and induced significantly less impairment of ciliary function in a human nasopharyngeal tissue culture model. The likely mechanism of pathogenicity is that PD is an enzyme (glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase, GlpQ) that releases phosphorylcholine (ChoP) from host epithelial cells to the lipooligosaccharide (LOS) on NTHi. LOS-ChoP interacts with platelet-activating factor receptors, inhibiting ciliary beat frequency of human bronchial epithelial cells and activating G protein-related pathways. PD is also capable of inducing bactericidal anti-protein D antibodies that protect against NTHi disease. PD-immunised rats cleared NTHi significantly better than non-immunised animals after middle ear and pulmonary bacterial challenge. In addition, chinchillas, PD-immunised or passively given anti-PD sera, showed protection against NTHidependent OM. PD was recently introduced as an antigenically active carrier protein in an experimental 11-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. In a recent Phase III clinical trial with this experimental vaccine, significant protection was achieved against OM caused by pneumococci and/or NTHi.",

New PCV candidates in development with wider serotype coverage or new PCV formulations for both infants and adults will be evaluated for efficacy. Large efficacy trials are not feasible any more, and the acceptance of the new PCVs will rely on immunogenicity studies. In the WHO guidelines (http://www.who.int/biologicals/publications/trs/ areas/vaccines/pneumo/en/index.html) the primary threshold for such trials is the proportion of subjects with antibody concentration of 0.35 mg/mL for all serotypes when measured via the WHO non-22F ELISA. The protective functional mechanism of antibodies to pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides resides in opsonophagocytosis and the demonstration of the opsonophagocytic activity (OPA) has been regarded as an important secondary threshold. Thus far there are only few published PCV efficacy trials that connect with OPA data and their good correlation. Considering those data it is becoming evident that measuring OPA has an added value when evaluating the vaccine efficacy based on immunogenicity studies. In general, the OPA titers and the antibody concentrations correlate well, but different serotypes can show various OPA/EIA ratios meaning that for certain serotypes (like 19F or 1) more antibodies are needed for killing the bacteria than for the rest. Importantly, the elderly and HIV positive patients seem to have antibodies of low functional activity, and measuring OPA in studies in the elderly and HIV patients has been considered important. Various assays for determining OPA have been developed and some laboratories have already performed extensive validation steps. A multilaboratory standardisation of the OPA assay is imminent. Measuring OPA with the classical killing assay consumes serum and time and thus measuring OPA for large materials is not always feasible. However, the development of multiplex and/or high throughput assays will end up in wider use of this technology in the future clinical trials. This would be in concordance with the guidelines for evaluation meningococcal conjugate vaccines by serum bactericidal activity assay.",

Recurrent infections occur in as many as 10% of children <3 years of age. Recurrent and persistence disease can lead to temporary or even permanent hearing loss and surgery (tube placement). In order to address these issues, preventive acute OM (AOM) strategies should include a vaccine with broader pneumococcal serotype coverage as well as protection against additional otopathogens. This presentation describes a novel vaccine approach in which polysaccharides from the 11 leading streptococcal paediatric serotypes are conjugated to a carrier protein (protein D) derived from Hi. Resistance to erythromycin, clindamycin, moxifloxacin and tetracycline was found in 45.8%, 50.6%, 9.1% and 33.7%, respectively. All the strains were fully susceptible to metronidazole and vancomycin. Resistance to moxifloxacin and erythromycin was tightly associated and MICs of moxifloxacin were significantly higher in patients previously treated with fluoroquinolones. Prevalence of the 027 epidemic strain was 5.7%. It was found in Ireland (n = 1), Netherlands (n = 8) and Belgium (n = 11). This strain exhibits the same phenotypic and genotypic features as the NAP1 clone described in North America: it is positive for binary toxin genes, it has an18-bp deletion in tcdC gene and it is resistant to erythromycin and moxifloxacin. Mean incidence of CDAD was 2.45 cases per 10,000 patient-days but it varied widely from one hospital to another. Patients infected with 027 strain were likely to have a more severe disease (RR = 1.72, 95% CI: 1.07\u22122.75, p = 0.048), to have received less antimicrobials in the month preceding diarrhoea (RR = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.53\u22121.10, p = 0.05) and to have been more specifically treated by metronidazole or vancomycin (RR = 1.32, 1.17\u22121.49, p = 0.02).

The infection control measures include recommendations to isolate infected patient on a single room with designated toilet, to apply proper hand hygiene with soap and water, to use appropriate protective clothing (gloves and aprons or gowns), to intensify environmental cleaning with a chlorine containing disinfectant and to take specific precautions for the use of devices (disposable or dedicated to individual patient). Patient isolation must continue at least until diarrhoea has ceased. Each hospital should have an appropriate surveillance system to recognize an increase of the incidence of CDAD in an early stage. All infection control measures should be written in a local protocol so that additional measures can be carried out as soon as a problem with CDAD arises. When outbreaks occur, additional recommendations include a reinforcement of general and hand washing measures, intensifying of testing patients with diarrhoea for C. difficile, reinforcement of environmental cleaning, information and education of healthcare workers, cleaning department and visitors, cohorting of infected patients, and eventually closure of the unit followed by intensive environmental cleaning. Restricted antibiotic prescribing is also highly recommended to reduce polypharmacy and duration of administration.

However, Acinetobacter infections can also be acquired outside the healthcare setting. Wound infections caused by Acinetobacter are now common among trauma patients in conflict zones or following natural disasters, and there have also been reports of other community-acquired infections, mainly in patients with some type of co-morbidity. Most of the latter reports originate from tropical or sub-tropical areas, and may become more common following ongoing changes in the global climate. Strains of A. baumannii harbour inherent or acquired resistance mechanisms against the vast majority of available antimicrobial agents, including the carbapenems. These organisms also have a remarkable capacity to persist in the hospital environment and to cause epidemic outbreaks of infection in hospitals. A recent increase in the number of carbapenem-resistant strains, particularly in eastern Europe, is currently of great concern. The recent EU-funded ARPAC study revealed that 130 of 169 participating European hospitals in 32 European countries had encountered carbapenem-resistant isolates of Acinetobacter, ranging from very rare sporadic resistant isolates to an endemic/epidemic situation. Certain multiresistant epidemic clones are currently spreading worldwide, and epidemics of multiresistant A. baumannii infections have occurred following the repatriation of casualties from the recent wars in Kuwait, Iraq and Afghanistan to European and American hospitals. In general, multiple isolates from a single hospital usually belong to the same clone, but some hospitals yield isolates belonging to more than one clone. Three 'European Clones' (lineages) have been identified in hospitals throughout Europe, but numerous other, more localised, clones have also been characterised, showing that the problem of A. baumannii is not confined solely to the widespread 'European clones I, II and III'. The reasons why certain A. baumannii lineages are more successful than others are not understood at present. Overall, the available epidemiological evidence suggests that A. baumannii is becoming one of the most significant microbial challenges of the current era. Strains in some hospitals are already effectively untreatable, and more scientific efforts and resources are urgently needed to further elucidate the epidemiological and infection control issues related to these infections.",

Whereas A. baumannii has itself a quite high level of naturallyoccurring antibiotic resistance, it may acquire additional resistance traits as a source of multidrug resistance. These resistance mechanisms may involve most of the antibiotic molecules, i.e. aminoglycosides, b-lactams and fluoroquinolones. Rate and spread of specific mechanisms of resistance depends on each country. A similar trend between the number of A. baumannii infections and antibiotic resistance may be observed worldwide. Acquired resistance genes are located on chromosome, plasmids, insertions sequences, transposons, integrons, and the recently described resistance island. One of the most worrying antibiotic resistance problems in A. baumannii is the increasing trend of carbapenem resistance since carbapenems are often used as antibiotics of the last resort. Carbapenem resistance results from metallo-b-lactamases, carbapenem-hydrolyzing oxacillinases and often combined mechanisms of resistance. Methods: During the two flights the patient had no cough but a urinary tract catheter which was disconnected from the reservoir and released relevant amounts of urine on the passenger's seat. The patient's urine was tested positive for Lassa virus, which was taken into account for the risk assessment and contributed to the decision to trace back copassengers potentially exposed. The passengers at risk were defined as those sitting in maximum three rows distance from the patient. 57 additional persons from the airline and the airport were exposed. With the help of the airline the passenger's lists of both flights were available within two days. 92 passengers from nine countries were identified. Every country received a list with names and contact telephone numbers of all passengers at risk who were allocated to the country as well as a questionnaire about symptoms to be filled for traced passengers. The trace back of the concerned staff was done by the airline and the Belgian public health authorities. 7) . In all cases, the magnitude of the reproduction number was comparable between the two waves. Our best estimate for the initial reproduction number (R 0 ) was 3.7, although it could range from 2 to 11 depending on assumptions regarding incubation and lifespan in mosquitoes. In the best fitting case, each infected individual may have contaminated 3 mosquitoes at most, and each mosquito contaminated 1.4 persons on average. Using data from the first season alone, modelbased extrapolations suggested that epidemic outbreaks were possible as long as more than one third of the population remained susceptible. Conclusion: Despite a thousand-fold change in incidence between the two seasons, the transmission characteristics of Chikungunya were similar; therefore there is no epidemiological evidence for an increase in virulence between seasons. At a time when information systems make it easier to monitor the course of emerging diseases, methods for timely and efficient analysis of the data must also be developed. Results: During the study period, a total of 138 cases of invasive Hi disease were reported from AK (76) and N Can (62). Among the 88 (67%) invasive Hi cases with serotype information available, 42 (48%) were serotype a, 27 (31%) were serotype b, 12 (14%) were serotype f. Among Hia isolates, 35 (83%) occurred in aboriginal peoples; median age was 1.1 years (range 3 mo to 74 years); 62% were male. Two Hia cases (1 adult/1 child) were fatal. Common clinical presentations included: meningitis (33%), pneumonia (29%), and septic arthritis (12%). There were no cases of epiglotittis. Overall annual Hia incidence was 0.9 cases per 100,000 population. Annual incidence rates in aboriginals in AK and N Can were 1.1 and 4.6 per 100,000 persons, respectively; rates in aboriginal children <2 years of age were 22 and 101 cases per 100,000 persons, respectively. PFGE analysis revealed genetically similar Hia strains in both AK and N Can. Conclusions: Serotype a is now the most common Hi serotype seen in the North American Arctic, with the highest rates among indigenous children.

Objectives: Telavancin is a novel, multivalent, lipoglycopeptide antibiotic that exerts rapid bactericidal activity against a broad range of Grampositive pathogens. Telavancin has a unique multifunctional mechanism of action that includes both inhibition of bacterial cell wall synthesis and disruption of bacterial membrane function. Previous studies with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) revealed that telavancin increases cell membrane permeability and causes rapid dissipation of the bacterial membrane potential. This study aimed to further characterise the effects of telavancin on the functional integrity of the MRSA cell membrane using flow cytometry. Methods: Cell membrane potential and membrane permeability were studied in telavancin-treated S. aureus ATCC 33591 (MRSA) cells. The fluorescent dyes, DiOC2(3) and propidium iodide, were used to assess membrane potential and permeability, respectively. Flow cytometry was used to analyse uptake of these dyes in telavancin-treated cells.",

Conclusion: Exposure of MRSA cells to telavancin initiated concentration-and time-dependent membrane depolarisation and increases in permeability, further demonstrating that telavancin interferes with bacterial cell membrane function. These effects were observed at telavancin concentrations that are achieved clinically with 10 mg/kg intravenous dosing, and further highlight the therapeutic relevance of telavancin's multifunctional mechanism of action. Objectives: Telavancin (TLV) is a novel, rapidly bactericidal lipoglycopeptide with activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). TLV possesses a unique, multivalent, multifunctional mechanism that contributes to enhanced activity and includes inhibition of cell wall peptidoglycan (PG) biosynthesis and disruption of bacterial membrane barrier function. In vitro studies suggest that TLV exhibits superior antibacterial potency relative to vancomycin (VAN); this may be due to the lipophilic decylaminoethyl side chain that targets TLV to the bacterial cell membrane. All isolates with the erm(A) gene were susceptible to oleandomycin whereas no inhibition zone was observed for the isolates with the erm(C) gene. Conclusion: S. aureus with the erm(C) gene are more readily susceptible to develop constitutive resistance to clindamycin than those with the erm(A) gene, regardless methicillin resistance. Susceptibility or inducible resistance to oleandomycin was associated with the presence of an inducible erm(A) or erm(C) gene, respectively and might constitute markers of these genes. The risk analysis for the clindamycin use in therapy of infections due to S. aureus inducibly resistant to erythromycin might include the nature of the resistance gene. Objectives: Multiple resistance of Escherichia coli to distinct classes of antimicrobials is usually attributed to simultaneous increased expression of AcrAB-TolC efflux system and loss of porin F generated by transcriptional activators marA, soxS or rob. AcrAB-TolC is also upregulated by SdiA, an E. coli protein that regulates cell division. In this study, multidrug resistant mutants selected in vitro with diazepam (DZ) and lomefloxacin (LOM) from two E. coli susceptible clinical isolates were characterised. Methods: Mutants were selected with DZ or LOM at 2, 3, 4 or 6 \u00d7 the MIC. Tolerance of strains to 10% cyclohexane was measured in liquid medium. Inner and outer membrane proteins (IMP and OMP) were analysed by electrophoresis on polyacrylamide gels. Penicillin-Binding-Proteins (PBPs) were detected with Bocillin FL and Imperial Protein Stain. Active efflux was evidenced by 0.05 mM carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). The expression of the acrA, acrB, marA, soxS, rob and sdiA genes was studied by reverse transcription of total RNA and PCR of cDNA (RT-PCR), using gapA gene as internal control of expression. PCR products were separated on polyacrylamide gels and detected using silver staining. Ag100 strain (induced or noninduced with 5 mM salicylate or 0.2 mM paraquat) was the control strain. Results: Nine different clones were selected with DZ or LOM. Selection frequencies were around 10 \u22129 to 10 \u22128 . The nine mutants increased resistance to quinolones, chloramphenicol and b-lactams (2\u22128 fold ceftazidime, cefpirome and aztreonam MICs). The presence of CCCP increased the susceptibility of mutants to antimicrobial agents. The OMP TolC increased in mutants, coinciding with their increased cyclohexane tolerance. Mutants and parent strains showed a high expression of acrA and acrB genes. Nevertheless, only mutants showed overexpression of sdiA and soxS and OmpF decrease. Neither parent strains nor mutants showed marA or rob overexpression. Increased PBP3 expression was detected in only the mutants selected with 6 \u00d7 MIC of DZ or LOM.",

Objectives: To study the role of Qnr-like pentapeptidic proteins of several Gram-positive species in resistance to quinolones in vitro. Methods: Enterococcus faecalis V583 homologue QnrA protein sequence was used to search pentapeptidic proteins with different levels of aminoacidic identity in the NCBI database. A PCR-based strategy was used to clone and express the genes coding for Qnr-like pentapeptidic proteins of E. faecalis ATCC 29212, E. faecalis V583, E. faecium BM4147, Listeria monocytogenes 868 (clinical isolate), Clostridium perfringens 455 (clinical isolate) and Bacillus cereus ATCC 11778 in pPCR-Script vector (Stratagene) in Escherichia coli DH10B. According to CLSI guidelines, MICs of nalidixic acid, ofloxacin, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin were determined for clinical strains, reference strains and Escherichia coli DH10B harbouring recombinant plasmids containing genes coding for the pentapeptidic proteins. Results: The aminoacidic identity of Qnr-like pentapeptidic proteins of the Gram-positive strains compared to those of plasmid-mediated QnrA1, QnrB1 or QnrS1 quinolone resistance proteins ranged from 20% to 27%. When compared to the homologue of QnrA in E. faecalis V583, the aminoacidic identity ranged from 30% to 35%. All the clones obtained in E. coli DH10B expressing a pentapentidic protein from the Gram positives strains conferred reduced susceptibility to quinolones. The recombinant plasmids expressing pentapentidic proteins in E. coli DH10B increased the MICs from 4 to 12 folds for nalidixic acid, from 6 to 24 folds for ofloxacin, from 2 to 47 folds for norfloxacin, from 12 to 32 folds for ciprofloxacin, from 4 to 21 folds for levofloxacin, and from 4 to 32 folds for moxifloxacin.",

However, it is unknown whether loss of K + is sufficient to cause cell death. In this study we determined the kinetics of both cell death and lysis of S. aureus treated with DAP to establish any relationships between the two. Methods: Time-kill experiments were performed at various concentrations of DAP to determine the kinetics of cell death and samples were taken and prepared for scanning and transmission electron microscopy (EM). Culture samples were taken at intervals and the extracellular and intracellular amounts of ATP determined.

There is evidence for dosedependent leakage of ATP and b-gal from cells treated with DAP, but this leakage occurs at very different rates. After 30 min of treatment with DAP at 32 mg/L, 90% of the total ATP has been released but only a negligible amount of b-gal. The percentage of b-gal released increases steadily over a period of hours, reaching 40% after 6 h and 90% after 24 h. After 30 min of treatment with DAP at 4 mg/L, 50% of the total ATP has been released and this amount continues to increase steadily. The leakage of b-gal is less apparent and after 24 h the cells have released less than 30%. The EM images show some cellular disruption in the first hour after DAP treatment, with this damage becoming more apparent and widespread over the following hours. The images clearly show that the rate and extent of cellular lysis is dose-dependent. Conclusion: Our findings support the Silverman model for the mode of action of DAP and the hypothesis that it can cause rapid cell death without whole cell lysis. We have, however, shown that cell lysis does occur over time, through both EM images and the leakage of large amounts of b-gal. Our findings, while upholding the Silverman model, suggest that it is too simple to conclude that cell death is due only to loss of K + and membrane de-energisation. The rapid loss of ATP would be an equally likely cause of cell death.",

By contrast, all the qnrA1-positive but blaVEB-1-negative isolates were negative for the A/C2 replicon. These results clearly indicated that the genes encoding QnrA1 and VEB-1, when identified concomitantly in a given isolate, were always located on plasmids belonging to the same IncA/C2-incompatibility group that may vary in size and digestion pattern. In addition, plasmids carrying the blaVEB-1 gene but lacking qnrA1 were also of the A/C2 type. On the opposite, plasmids that were qnrA1-positive but blaVEB-1-negative were of distinct replicon types, suggesting independent acquisition of the qnrA gene on different plasmids. Restriction pattern analysis of plasmid DNAs performed using the PstI endonuclease revealed that the blaVEB-1-positive plasmids exhibited different restriction profiles but also sharing common bands, likely corresponding to a common plasmid backbone. Hybridisation performed with an A/C2-specific probe showed an identical signal revealing that the bands carrying the replication control region of the plasmids were of identical size, as expected with plasmids from the same lineage. Conclusion: It is shown here that the IncA/C2 plasmid may be the main vehicle of the blaVEB-1 gene on which the QnrA1 determinant may be added. Understanding these patterns will help to identify potential targets for public health intervention.",

Objectives: Staphylococcus aureus remains the prevalent bacterium causing acute osteomyelitis in children. The involvement of methicillinresistant S. aureus (MRSA) as a cause of acute childhood osteomyelitis was investigated. Methods: Included in the study were all children treated for acute osteomyelitis due to S. aureus in Western Greece from January 2005 until August 2006. Bone scan, MRI and X-rays were performed in order to ascertain the diagnosis and to assess the severity of the disease. S. aureus was isolated from blood and/or bone tissue when surgical drainage was necessary. The Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome (SCCmec) type and Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) genes (lukS-PV and lukF-PV) were detected by PCRs. MRSA clones were defined by PFGE of SmaI DNA digests. Signs, symptoms and laboratory findings were prospectively registered and statistically evaluated (Mann-Whitney-U test) in all patients until cessation of activity of the disease. Results: Nineteen patients, 12 males and 7 females, median age 11 years, range 2\u221213 years, were diagnosed as having acute staphylococcal osteomyelitis. Three children had a suspected site of bacterial entrance (injury, burn, insect bite). S. aureus was isolated from the blood of nine patients, from the tissue of nine more patients and from both clinical specimens in one patient. In five children community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA) carrying SCCmec type IV and PVL was identified. Among the 14 MSSA isolated from the remaining patients, two were PVLpositive. The maximal ESR and CRP values as well as the time necessary for normalisation of ESR and CRP differed statistically significantly in patients with PVL positive stains (MRSA and MSSA) compared to PVLnegative MSSA (p < 0.05). Surgical drainage was more often necessary among patients with PVL-positive stains. Conclusions: PVL-positive CA-MRSA are recovered not only from patients with superficial but also with invasive musculoskeletal infections. The production of PVL seems to be the main factor that contributes to the course of acute osteomyelitis. Here, we describe the first report of family transmission of C-MRSA PVL-, tsst1+, in a patient (pt) with osteomyelitis. Case report: In October 2006, a 29-year-old alcoholic man with no medical history was admitted in our department of infectious diseases for acromioclavicular osteoarthritis. He was married and had two children (6 and 8 year-old). In 2005 he had a traumatic dislocation of the right acromioclavicular joint and was operated one year later for tendons refection using homogenic graft. Two weeks after surgery, a purulent discharge from the post-operative wound was noted, and MRSA was cultured from swabs. The strain was resistant to oxacillin, kanamycin, tobramycin, and susceptible to ofloxacin, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, pristinamycin, clindamycin, vancomycin, and was intermediate to fusidic acid. He was given oral pristinamycin (1 g tid for 8 weeks). One week after the end of treatment, in October 2006, he was admitted for a right acromioclavicular osteoarthritis which required surgical debridement and intravenous vancomycin treatment. A C-MRSA strain PVL\u2212 tsst1+ grew from intra-operative samples. The family carriage screening (including the pt) showed that the pt's children were colonised with the same MRSA strain according to the antibiotic susceptibility profile (PVL and tsst 1 detection still in process). The members of the pt's family had no healthcare associated risk factors for C-MRSA. Vancomycin was switched to oral trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole and rifampicin combination for 3 months. Discussion: In 2002, a new type of MRSA producing tsst1 has been described in France and Switzerland. To the best of our knowledge, family transmission of C-MRSA PVL-, tsst1+ strain has never been reported. In the present case report, a cross contamination between the pt and his family is highly suspected.",

A primary trigger for these conditions is the complex microbiota found as dental plaque, a complex microbial biofilm. Despite 3000 years of history demonstrating the influence of oral status on general health, recent decades have seen an accelerated effort for the prevention and management of these conditions through groundbreaking advances. One outcome of these advances is the realisation that periodontal diseases are associated with systemic conditions such as coronary heart disease and stroke; higher risk for preterm, low birth weight babies and pose threats to those with chronic disease: diabetes, respiratory diseases and osteoporosis. This presentation will highlight recent research associating periodontal disease with systemic diseases. The relationship between oral infections and systemic disease represents a paradigm shift in current research. A portion of this lecture will be devoted to examining the role of chronic infections and their association with cardiovascular diseases (CVD). These infections include Helicobacter pylori, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Cytomegalovirus (CMV), and, more recently, periodontopathic bacteria including Porphyromonas gingivalis. Although a number of potential mechanisms have been postulated, the mechanism by which these infections are associated with CVD is still unclear. The various hypotheses concerning this relationship include common susceptibility, inflammation via increased circulating cytokines and inflammatory mediators, direct infection of the blood vessels and finally the possibility of cross-reactivity or molecular mimicry between bacterial and self antigens. The evidence for each of these mechanisms will be presented and the clinical implications for medical and dental practitioners discussed. This introductory lecture will set the stage for subsequent speakers highlighting the medico-dental interface as a required shift in health practices for the future.",

This is increasingly required to capitalise on recent advances in health sciences for the management of chronic diseases that have reduced morbidity. Improvements in longevity have resulted in unique populations with special oral care needs and include those with cancer of the head and neck, immunocompromised, HIV/AIDS, geriatrics, residents of long-term care facilities, patients with lifelong conditions, after organ transplantation and those on prescription medications like those for blood-pressure control or anticoagulation therapy. This session will highlight the unique oral care needs for our changing patient population, and how oral health can be improved when dentists and physicians work together. The role of prescription medications to treat medical conditions and their adverse reactions in the oral cavity will form a separate another area for discussion. Many medications, for instance, are xerostomic. Patients with xerostomia are at increased risk for tooth decay and periodontal disease. The need for increased collaboration between dentists and physicians to prevent or reduce complications by maintaining better oral and medical health will form a core theme for this session.

Oral hygiene formulations with significant effects on the dental biofilm augment ineffective practices of routine prophylaxis. Chlorhexidine and triclosan formulated in oral hygiene formulations have an extensive history of clinically proven efficacy and safety. An overview of clinically effective oral hygiene formulations and their role as therapeutic strategies will commence this presentation. With triclosan serving as a case-study, the talk will bring together recent advances in the assessment of oral biofilms, analyses of clinical strains including susceptibility to demonstrate the microbiological safety and efficacy of oral hygiene formulations. The past three decades have witnessed no general reduction in the effectiveness of triclosan for its target bacteria including periodontal bacteria. Whilst triclosan is not noted for its activity against enteric bacteria and pseudomonads, laboratory studies demonstrated that chronic sub-lethal exposure of Escherichia coli can select mutant clones with significantly reduced susceptibility. These mutants are either mutated in an enzyme (FabI) associated with fatty-acid biosynthesis or overexpress multi-drug efflux pumps. Initial concern that mutations in FabI might be capable of horizontal transfer between environmental bacteria and noscomial pathogens or that parallel processes might occur directly in Gram-positive pathogens have subsided. Similarly, concern about possible selection of resistance towards third-party agents (antibiotics) that might share the FabI gene target has proven unfounded. Selection of efflux-on mutants, whilst demonstrated in the laboratory is not supported by analyses of isolates from the hospital or domestic environment where agents such as triclosan have been widely deployed. Evidence suggests that efflux-on mutants are unable to compete in natural microbial communities. Whilst there is insufficient evidence to suggest that the uncontrolled use of triclosan in domestic products is totally free of risk, its deployment for oral hygiene, especially where such use might limit the number of refractory infections and their possible complications contributes ultimately to a reduction in antibiotic use is encouraged. Collectively, there is no evidence that the long-term application of triclosan formulations to the oral cavity or skin selects for triclosanresistant bacterial populations.",

The maintenance of an effective level of oral hygiene is the cornerstone of all attempts to prevent and control periodontal diseases and yet the widespread prevalence of these diseases indicates the inability of most people to achieve a level of plaque control commensurate with periodontal health. The inclusion of antibacterial agents, such as chlorhexidine and triclosan/copolymer, into oral care products has provided the consumer with the means to improve their oral health. Randomised controlled clinical trials have demonstrated that a dentifrice containing triclosan/copolymer significantly improves gingival health, prevents the onset of periodontitis and furthermore reduces the progression of the disease. These benefits were initially attributed to the antibacterial action of triclosan but evidence now suggests that it is also an anti-inflammatory agent. The delivery of such benefits is considerable with implications for the maintenance of oral and general health and the costs of dental care.",

            "text": "The emergence of multidrug resistance (MDR) in pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Enterobacteriaceae that produce extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) is alarming. Increasing MDR in patients treated for nosocomial infections is causing an increase in costs, morbidity, and mortality. Traditionally, a narrow-spectrum drug was used first, and the most potent drugs were reserved for subsequent use. Unfortunately, the traditional approach increases the chance of treatment failure and the emergence of multidrugresistant strains. In fact, the inappropriate choice of antibiotics is the most important independent risk factor for death. ESBL producers are resistant to most penicillins and cephalosporins and are often cross-resistant to aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones as well. Carbapenems have been shown to provide superior outcomes compared with other agents for infections caused by ESBL producers. Consequently, the first-line use of carbapenems is optimal for serious infections in which ESBL pathogens are suspected. The major non-fermentative Gram-negative pathogen of concern is P. aeruginosa. P. aeruginosa is a common cause of nosocomial infections and the leading cause of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Initial therapy should include an antipseudomonal b-lactam, such as piperacillintazobactam, an antipseudomonal carbapenem, or an antipseudomonal cephalosporin, plus an aminoglycoside or a fluoroquinolone. A. baumannii generally is susceptible to carbapenems, aminoglycosides, sulbactam, colistin, or tigecycline. Carbapenems are one of the few classes that remain an excellent choice for both nonfermenters. Doripenem is a new broad-spectrum carbapenem with activity superior to that of other carbapenems against P. aeruginosa and similar to other carbapenems against A. baumannii. As antibiotic resistance increases, empiric therapy for severe infections should be based on local pathogen etiology and resistance patterns. A new approach is to start with a high-dose, broad-spectrum antibiotic and then tailor the individual therapy based on microbiological results. Carbapenems are likely to remain an important option for serious Gramnegative infections for the foreseeable future. Since the number of new intravenous agents with activity against Gram-negative organisms is extremely limited, the development of a new carbapenem may help to reduce the mortality, morbidity, and cost of serious nosocomial infections.",

Use is also growing, driven by the spread of extendedspectrum b-lactamases (ESBLs). The carbapenems have much in common with each other, with broader activity and better stability to ESBLs and AmpC enzymes than other b-lactams, but with lability to metallo-and KPC b-lactamases and to the OXA carbapenemases of Acinetobacter clones. Three carbapenem groups nevertheless can be defined. Group 1 agents lack activity versus non-fermenters; they are represented by ertapenem and perhaps in the future also by oral analogues. Ertapenem's utility lies in the treatment of community-acquired infections, where ESBL producers are likely or proven; it has convenient, oncedaily, dosing but is the most vulnerable carbapenem to combinations of ESBL or AmpC plus impermeability. Group 2 comprises imipenem, meropenem, and doripenem, plus analogues available only in East Asia; they are active versus most non-fermenters and are appropriate in nosocomial settings where these pathogens are likely. Doripenem and meropenem are very similar, but with doripenem circa two-fold more active versus most species; imipenem is slightly less active against Gram-negative bacteria except Acinetobacter but is the sole carbapenem active versus Enterococcus faecalis. Doripenem and meropenem need two mutations -loss of OprD and up-regulated efflux -for resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Imipenem resistance arises by loss of OprD alone and can be selected in therapy; nevertheless, imipenem is unique in evading pseudomonal efflux. Meropenem and doripenem are relatively stable to renal dehydropeptidase, but imipenem needs protection with cilastatin; doripenem and meropenem are chemically stable, allowing prolonged infusion, whereas imipenem is not; doripenem and meropenem have little seizure potential (meropenem is licensed for meningitis), but CNS side-effects limit imipenem dosage. Group 3, comprising analogues active versus MRSA, is represented by the developmental agent CS-023; its minimum inhibitory concentrations for MRSA are more widely distributed than those of anti-MRSA cephalosporins, but it has the wider spectrum typical of a carbapenem. As carbapenem usage expands, it is critical to understand these differences, so that the most appropriate analogues can be selected.",

The goal of antimicrobial chemotherapy is to optimise the combined pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profile of a drug so that the greatest percentage of patients achieves the PD target associated with a favourable outcome, while minimising the development of resistant organisms. Integration of population PK, a PD target, and microbiologic surveillance data by Monte Carlo simulations can generate an empirical dosing strategy that maximises the likelihood that an antibiotic regimen achieves the desired PD end point (exposure target). For b-lactams, the exposure target is the percentage of time that free drug levels are above the minimum inhibitory concentration (T > MIC). For carbapenems, the T > MIC requirement is lower than for other b-lactams. By extending the infusion period to achieve the necessary T > MIC, a lower dose can achieve the same efficacy as a higher dose, while lowering cost and potential toxicity. For example, a recent publication showed that a 1-g 0.5-h infusion of meropenem has a 77.1% rate of target attainment against Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from hospitals in Hungary, whereas a 3-h infusion of 0.5 g meropenem would have an 83.8% rate of target attainment. In a retrospective study that compared 0.5 h piperacillin/tazobactam infusions (3.375 g, q6h) with 4-h infusions (3.375 g, q8h) in patients infected with P. aeruginosa, the 4-h infusions reduced 14-day mortality from 31.6% to 12.2% (P = 0.02) and median length of stay from 38 to 21 days in patients with APACHE II scores 17 (P = 0.02). Doripenem is more stable upon reconstitution than other carbapenems, potentially making it more convenient and easier to use as an extended infusion. Furthermore, the study design for the doripenem ventilatorassociated pneumonia phase 3 trial includes an extended infusion regimen (0.5 g over 4 h).",

Two randomised, double-blind phase 3 cIAI trials compared intravenous (IV) doripenem (500 mg q8h) with IV meropenem (500 mg q8h), with an option to switch to amoxicillin/clavulanate for both treatment arms after 9 doses of IV study drug therapy. Results from the cIAI trials showed that doripenem (500 mg q8h) is welltolerated and non-inferior to meropenem (1 g q8h). Doripenem was microbiologically effective against major causative organisms of cIAIs, including Enterobacteriaceae and Bacteroides spp. Adverse events (AEs) occurring in 3% of subjects in either treatment arm were nausea and vomiting. No seizures were reported. A randomised, double-blind phase 3 cUTI trial compared IV doripenem (500 mg q8h) with IV levofloxacin (250 mg q24h), with an option to switch to oral levofloxacin for both treatment arms.

Doripenem had greater efficacy in patients who remained on intravenous therapy and in patients with levofloxacin-resistant E. coli. Fewer pathogens had a 4-fold increase in minimum inhibitory concentration during therapy with doripenem than with levofloxacin. AEs occurring in 3% of subjects in either treatment arm were headache, diarrhoea, and phlebitis. No serious study drug-related AEs were reported.

Current vaccination strategies have to consider both pre-exposure and post-exposure vaccines. Acquired immunity against tuberculosis is a T cell-dependent phenomenon. The T cell system comprises distinct populations. CD4 T cells are undoubtedly of central importance for acquired resistance against tuberculosis. Antigens of M. tuberculosis also stimulate CD8 T cells, probably through crosspriming. In addition, unconventional T cells also seem to participate in immunity against tuberculosis. What can we learn for rational vaccine design? Novel vaccination strategies either focus on subunit vaccines or viable attenuated vaccines. Subunit vaccination strategies are based on the assumption that one or few antigens suffice for an efficient immune response. Hence, the identification of protective antigens represents an essential prerequisite for the success of this type of vaccines. Subunit vaccines come in three forms: Protein/adjuvant formulations, recombinant heterologous carriers or naked DNA constructs. Viable attenuated vaccines are based on the assumption that multiple antigens are required for efficacious protection. Two major strategies are being pursued: Knockout mutants of M. tuberculosis and improved recombinant (r)-BCG vaccines. Improved r-BCG should first be endowed with a higher immunogenicity and second may need a broader antigenic repertoire. Rational vaccination strategies performed in the laboratory of the author focus on improved BCG. A r-BCG strain which expresses listeriolysin induces better protection than wild-type BCG. It is tempting to speculate that a prime/boost scheme comprising prime with improved r-BCG and boost with the most efficacious subunit vaccine candidate will provide optimal protection. Identification of a biosignature that allows distinction between infection/protection and infection/disease in tuberculosis could speed up efficacy testing of vaccines in clinical trials. The Grand Challenge 6 of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation aims at identifying such biosignatures. Taking advantage of our increasing knowledge about the immune response to M. tuberculosis will facilitate rational design of novel vaccines against one of the most frightening threats in the world, tuberculosis. The following years will witness the transformation of vaccine candidates from preclinical to clinical trials requiring intensive coordination in order to identify the most appropriate candidate(s).

            "text": "One of the most important characteristics that separate antimicrobials from other drugs used in clinical medicine is that their target (the receptor of the drug) is part of the microbe, and not of men. The activity of the antimicrobial can therefore be studied both in vitro and in model systems, such as animal models, and a relationship between exposure and effect established. The exposure is primarily determined by the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the drug, while the effect is determined by the concentration-effect relationship of the antimicrobial and the micro-organism. However, in most clinical settings, it is the potency of the antimicrobial that is measured in terms of the MIC and not the concentration-effect relationship itself. Therefore, a relationship needs to be ascertained between the MIC, exposure of the drug and effect. Over the last decade, these pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships of antimicrobials have been established for most classes of drugs. The two major indices describing these relationships are the time the concentration of the antimicrobial remains above the MIC (T >MIC) as a fraction of the dosing interval and the Area under the Time Concentration curve over 24 hours divided by the MIC (AUC/MIC ratio). The Peak/MIC ratio correlates with effect for a number of drugs, but it in many, if not all, cases the effect can not be clearly distinguished from the AUC/MIC effect. Importantly, for virtually all antimicrobials, it is the exposure of the free non-protein bound fraction of the drug that best correlates with efficacy, and is of particular significance when drugs are compared with each other within a class and/or across species, including men. From these PK/PD relationships, a number of issues have come forward. Importantly, it has been shown in a number of clinical trials -now exceeding 10 -including several classes of drugs, that the PK/PD relationships that do exist in animals are, as expected, similar to those in men. Moreover, it has been shown that the quantitative relationships are remarkably similar. In other words, exposures in infected animals result in the same effect as exposures in infected humans under similar conditions. A second, perhaps even more important topic is that these relationships -once well established -can be used to optimise therapy in patients by optimising exposure of the drug. In a relatively simple approach, these relationships are used in daily clinical practice in the use of clinical breakpoints. These MIC values are used to discriminate between high and low probabilities of successful outcome of treatment (S and R, respectively) based on the PK/PD relationships of the antimicrobial together with the clinical setting. For instance, lower exposures to obtain the same effect are needed in the immunocompetent host because of the contribution of the immune system. More sophisticated, these relationships are used to adjust dosing regimens once the MICs of the infectious micro-organisms are known, and thus provide an integrated approach to the individual patient. Finally, PK/PD relationships are used in the development phase of the drug in determining the optimal dose for the indication sought. Alternatively, once dosing regimens are established, they can be used to form an opinion on the possible indications for various clinical treatment modalities.",

            "text": "Dissemination of microbial drug resistance observed in the antibiotic era is clearly related to the selective pressure generated by the use of antibiotics in clinical, veterinary and agricultural practices. This notion is universally acknowledged and supported by the several studies that have correlated the emergence and dissemination of resistance with the use of new antibiotics, and by documentation of the absence of acquired resistance in clinical isolates from the pre-antibiotic era. However, the presence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has recently been reported also in humans and in wild animals living in remote areas where antibiotic exposure has been absent or minimal [1\u22123] . This unexpected finding raises a question on the mechanisms responsible for spreading and maintenance of antibiotic resistance in similar settings, and could have important implications for the design of strategies addressed at controlling bacterial resistance based on antibiotic restriction policies. Results of studies on antibiotic resistance in settings of minimal antibiotic exposure (including investigations recently carried out in very remote human communities living in the Bolivian Chaco and in the Alto Amazonas jungle of South America, and among wild reptiles (land iguanas) from a remote and protected island of the Gal\u00e1pagos archipelago with no documented sources of antibiotic exposure and minimum human contacts) will be critically reviewed in this presentation, and the mechanisms potentially involved in the dissemination of resistant strains and resistance genes unrelated to antimicrobial consumption will be discussed. Results from the characterisation of resistance determinants carried by bacterial isolates from these settings pointed to their likely origin from antibiotic-exposed areas rather than to a local and independent resistance selection process. However, the mechanisms responsible for this flow of resistance genes and for their maintenance and spread in absence of sustained antibiotic use remain elusive. Objective: The objective of this study was to identify the 43-kDa ChoP containing protein and characterise its function in the virulence of P. aeruginosa. Methods: To identify the ChoP containing protein, bacterial cell fractions were separated by FPLC. Fractions were analysed by Western blot using specific monoclonal anti-ChoP antibodies and those that contained the ChoP epitope were further purified by SDS-PAGE. A 43-kDa protein containing the ChoP epitope was cut out of the gel, trypsinised, and subjected to capillary LC-MS and MS/MS. ChoP epitope expression of whole cell extracts of 92 genetic unrelated P. aeruginosa isolates (46 from chronic infections and 46 from acute infections) was analysed by Western blot analysis using specific monoclonal anti-ChoP antibody.

Objectives: We aim to develop novel therapies for the treatment of Gram-negative bacterial infections, by isolating monoclonal antibodies that are capable of binding to signal molecules involved in bacterial quorum sensing. Signalling blockade was hypothesised to prevent the production of virulence factors and so allow the host immune system to eliminate the infection. Methods: As Gram-negative bacterial signaling molecules are typically of low molecular weight (less than 500 Da) they have been considered intractable to standard antibody discovery methodologies. Therefore we have used a novel suite of antibody discovery processes termed Haptomics \u00ae to isolate a panel of human antibodies capable of binding to signal molecules produced by Gram-negative bacteria. Results: We have demonstrated the abilities of the antibodies to bind bacterial signaling molecules using a range of in vitro experiments, and we have also evaluated the antibodies using in vivo models of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection. Results will be presented demonstrating the efficacy of our fully human recombinant antibody fragments and whole IgG molecules in the treatment of Gram-negative bacterial infections. Conclusion: Our approach offers the exciting prospect of using powerful immunological reagents to combat bacterial infection. By targeting the signal molecules, rather than the bacteria themselves, we believe that resistance is considerably less likely to develop to these antibody-based therapeutics.

In that species, most of the mechanisms involved in the b-lactam resistance are linked to the production of b-lactamases, including clavulanic-acid inhibited expanded-spectrum b-lactamases (ESBLs) and carbapenemases which are the most powerful enzymes able to degradate most b-lactams.

Noteworthy, most of the ESBL and MBL encoding genes encountered in E. coli are vehiculed by plasmids and located into class 1 integron structures, thus facilitating the occurrence of multidrug resistance via the co-localisation of other antibiotic resistance genes.",

The Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) is a global programme to reduce mortality rates in severe sepsis, endorsed by 11 International Medical Societies. This Campaign produced the guidelines for management of severe sepsis and septic shock [2] . These recommendations were reviewed during the annual meeting of the Society of Critical Care Medicine held in January 2006. The Campaign has taken an action to create National and International networks to collect data and monitor interventions. In Italy the network was settled in September 2006. But, can we monitor therapy for severe sepsis if concepts, tools, ideas and attitudes differ largely between centres? With the aim of answering this crucial question, we conducted a survey on the perception of Severe Sepsis, its diagnosis and monitoring through the national network for the Italian Chapter of the SSC. Twenty-three participating centres (10 community and 13 teaching hospitals) responded to our survey, for a total number of 261 ICU/critical care beds. When the participants were asked to describe the methodology currently used for implementation of data in their institution, 70% of the respondents adopted a continuous data collection methodology and the other 30% a \"before and after event\" design. On the question whether an educational tool was used to sensitise people to the campaign, 13% of the respondents declared that no specific tool was used and the other 87% (20 centres) stated that they used different educative means (mostly chart documentations and department conferences). When asked when data collection for the diagnosis of sepsis usually takes place, thirteen respondents said that their collection occurred within 24 hours from the diagnosis, only 2 contemporary, and 8 retrospectively.",

The effect of this mentality is that only 6 (26%) of the interviewed hospitals currently apply a screening for severe sepsis in the ward. One main concept that illustrates the spirit of the SSC is the idea of an early intervention to apply the different recommendations. Again, in checking how the time of presentation of sepsis is conceived in the emergency department, in the ward and in the ICU we obtained answers that were quite diverse. Of the 23 participating institutions, 16 responded. Only 50% of physicians in the Emergency Department identified the \"presentation time\" of severe sepsis with the moment of triage or hospital admission. The remaining 50% had a sort of \"a posteriori\" diagnosis, losing the possibility of an early approach. Things are much worse looking at the ward, where in 80% of cases the moment of severe sepsis presentation corresponded to the identification of symptoms from the \"a posteriori\" reviews of the medical notes, the arrival of a critical care consultant or ICU admission. Surprisingly, in the ICU still 30% of the cases is usually diagnosed through the review of the medical reports. ",

Besides, another standard related with the susceptibility of filamentous fungi to antifungals will be published very soon. The EUCAST General Committee has recently published guidelines for harmonisation of breakpoints for antimicrobials and therefore the Antifungal Susceptibility Testing Subcommittee of EUCAST has adopted it. In order, to prove that breakpoints for antifungals can be obtained, EUCAST-AFST decided to make a proof of concept with fluconazole. All the requirements raised for EUCAST committee to obtain break points for antimicrobials have been addressed and fluconazole break points have been attained. The data obtained through the revision system to obtain break points for fluconazole will be discussed. Also the discrepancies of EUCAST and CLSI break points will be examined and analysed. In the near future, it is intention of EUCAST AFST develop break points to all licensed antifungals. Objectives: In recent years K. pneumoniae has been shown to have increasing resistance, due to production of extended-spectrum b-lactamases (ESBLs) or metallo-b-lactamases (MBLs). The aim of this study was to record the bacteraemias due to K. pneumoniae in our ICU, to analyse the patterns of resistance, as well as the clinical characteristics of the ensuing infections. Methods: Prospective observational study in patients who were hospitalised in the ICU, from September 2004 to October 2006. The demographic characteristics of all patients admitted were recorded, as well as the underlying diseases, disease severity as estimated by the APACHE II score and possible factors predisposing to infections, such as previous consumption of antibiotics. Susceptibility testing of culture isolates was performed by MicroScan autoSCAN4. The outcome of all bacteraemias was recorded. Statistical analysis was done with ESPSS v.12. Results: During the study period 290 patients were admitted to the ICU and 160 episodes of bacteraemia were recorded. Of these, 29 (18%) were due to K. pneumoniae. The isolates were resistant as follows: 100% to ampicillin, 72% to b-lactamase inhibitors, 90% to 3rd-generation cephalosporins, 41% to imipenem (MIC > 4 mg/L), 41% to aztreonam, 86% to quinolones and 31% to aminoglycosides. All isolates were susceptible to colistin (MIC 2 mg/L). The carbapenemresistant isolates (CRKP) were also resistant to all other antibiotics tested, except aztreonam and gentamicin (75% and 58% sensitive respectively). The bacteria were isolated in 23 patients (mean age 67 years, 69% male) of whom 56% were surgical. Their mean APACHE II score was 19. Ten bacteraemias were primary, 5 secondary to ventilator-associated pneumonia and 14 catheter-related. The 14days mortality of patients with bacteraemia due to CRKP was 53%, while in those with sensitive strains it was 28% (p = 0.2). Outcome was significantly related to the APACHE II score (p = 0.02). Of the patients who had bacteraemia due to CRKP, 77% had been previously receiving a carbapenem. Of those who had a carbapenem-sensitive isolate, 35% had been receiving a carbapenem (p = 0.4) Conclusions: Infections due to K. pneumoniae resistant to carbapenems represent a serious clinical problem in our ICU and are associated with a high mortality rate. It seems that previous use of carbapenems leads to increased resistance. Larger studies are needed in order to obtain statistically significant results. Objectives: Nosocomial infections surveillance was performed in an Italian ICU in order to pretest the HELICS protocol before its nationwide implementation, and to evaluate the impact and the routes of acquisition of three emerging multiresistant pathogens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia by determining: (i) the occurrence of carriage on admission; (ii) the microrganism-specific ICU-acquired infection rates, by site; (iii) the impact of cross-transmission using molecular typing data, and (iv) the individual risk factors for infection. Methods: A six-months surveillance survey was performed at the ICU of an Italian Hospital, in accordance with the HELICS protocol, excluding patients staying less than three days. An electronic data form, was designed using the SPSS Data Entry Enterprise Server (SPSS Inc.). Clonality was determined by macrorestriction analysis using well established criteria, and the presence of two indistinguishable strains in two patients was considered one episode of cross-transmission. Results: During the study period, 121 patients were enrolled into the survey for a total of 2165 days. The ICU-acquired infection rate was 82.6% patients and the incidence density was 46.2\u2030 patient-days. The occurrence of P. aeruginosa carriage on admission was 1.6% patients. No episode of A. baumannii or S. maltophilia carriage was identified. The ICU-acquired P. aeruginosa, A. baumannii and S. maltophilia associated infection rates were respectively: 35.9%, 13.0% and 12.4% patients.",

Eighteen P. aeruginosa, one A. baumannii and four S. maltophilia distinct clones were identified by macrorestriction analysis over a total of 162 isolates. The impact of cross-transmission was estimated to be at least 52.4%, thus defining the preventable proportion of all cross-transmission episodes. Two major risk factors were identified: inappropriate management of invasive devices and of antimicrobial usage. Conclusion: Our study confirms the essential role of epidemiologic surveillance to provide advanced risk-adjusted infection rates as a measure of quality of care. Objectives: The role of the multi-gene PE family of proteins unique to mycobacteria, in the pathogenesis of tuberculosis is still poorly understood. Tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) is essential for successfully combatting tuberculosis. Our objective was to understand how PE_PGRS33, a surface-exposed protein known to undergo variation among strains, influences TNF-a release from macrophages, and how this is linked to apoptosis of macrophages.",

Its binding to cell surface TLR2 was analysed by flow cytometry and the role of TLR2 was studied by transfecting cells with dominant-negative TLR2 prior to analysing PE_PGRS33-induced TNF-a release. The signaling pathways activated were studied by assaying for the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase ASK1 and downstream MAPKs. Cell death was analysed using histone ELISA and also by assaying surface-associated annexin-FITC. Results: PE_PGRS33, a surface exposed protein, elicits TNF-a release from macrophages in a Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2)-dependent manner. Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) is activated downstream of TLR2. ASK1 activates the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) p38 and JNK. PE_PGRS33-induced signaling leads to enhanced expression of TNF-a and TNF receptor I (TNFRI) genes. Mycobacterium smegmatis expressing PE_PGRS33 elicits the same effects as purified PE_PGRS33. Neutralising TNF-a antibodies showed that release of TNF-a is required for triggering apoptosis in macrophages challenged with PE_PGRS33. The death receptor-dependent signals are amplified through classical caspase 8-dependent mitochondrial release of cytochrome c, leading to the activation of caspases 9 and 3.",

Our objective was to understand the role of PPK1 in bacterial survival under stress. Methods: To evaluate the role of PPK1 in mycobacterial survival, the gene encoding PPK1 was disrupted in M. smegmatis through homologous recombination. The effect of stress on the wild type and the mutant were then analysed. ppk1 was also silenced by antisensing in M. tuberculosis. Results: The PPK1-deleted strain of M. smegmatis exhibited significantly reduced intracellular survival in murine RAW 264.7 macrophages compared to the survival of its wild type counterpart. It exhibited an extended lag phase of growth when shifted to a low phosphate-containing medium, was unable to grow in nitrogen-depleted medium and impaired in its ability to survive in anaerobic conditions. It showed decreased transcription of the stringent response regulator relA. M. tuberculosis ppk1 could complement the mutant. Antisensing of the ppk1 gene in M. tuberculosis also showed reduced levels of relA transcription. The ppk1 mutant was defective in its ability to form biofilms.

Methods: A two-step recombination protocol was used to replace the cholesterol oxidase gene with a non-functional copy. The pathogenicity of resultant strains was analysed in vitro using peritoneal macrophages and in vivo by mice infection. Results: Cholesterol oxidase is known to be a key enzyme initiating cholesterol degradation processes in many soil bacteria, including fast growing mycobacteria. Pathogenic mycobacteria accumulate cholesterol without its utilisation and express cholesterol oxidase as an extracellular enzyme. A homologous recombination was used to construct an M. tuberculosis strain with an unmarked deletion within the choD gene. The wild type M. tuberculosis strain (Mt-wt), choD-mutant (mut-choD) and mutant complemented with choD gene controlled by a heat shock protein promoter (mut-choD-PhspchoD) were used to study the function of cholesterol oxidase in mycobacterial pathogenesis. Peritoneal macrophages (10 6 /well) were infected with Mt-wt, mut-choD and mut-choD-PhspchoD M. tuberculosis strains (10 5 /well) and incubated for four and six days. The numbers of Mt-wt and mut-choD-PhspchoD viable bacteria recovered from macrophages were at least an order of magnitude higher compared to mut-cho strain as revealed by cfu analysis. The same strains were used for infection of mice. Ten weeks post infection, lungs and spleens were isolated from euthanised mice. The numbers of viable bacteria in each organ were detected by cfu. Analysing at least 10 mice of each group, the strong attenuation of choD mutants was observed compared to wild type and complementation strains. We studied the cytokine/chemokine profiles associated with LTBI and TB in order to gain insight into ongoing immune activation events in Mtb-infection.",

Interferon-gamma (IFN-g) that was released from sensitised lymphocytes upon ex vivo stimulation with Mtb-specific antigens was determined using the QuantiFERON-TB \u00ae Gold In Tube assay as recommended by the manufacturer (Cellestis Ltd., Carnegie, Australia). Microsphere-based multiplex assays (Lincoplex \u00ae , Linco Research Inc., St Charles, MA, USA) were used to assess the plasma concentrations of IFN-g, TNF-a, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12p40, IL-12p70 IL-13, IL-15, Fraktalkine, GM-CSF, MCP-1, and IP-10 before (NIL) and after (TbAg) ex vivo stimulation. Values were determined using Bio-Plex Manager (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA). The limit of detection was 3.2 pg/mL. Statistical analysis was performed using Prism 4.1 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). The Kruskal-Wallis test was used for multiple group comparison, and the Mann-Whitney test for group to group comparison. Results: IFN-g, IP-10, IL-2, GM-CSF, IL-13 concentrations were significantly higher in patients with TB and LTBI as compared to controls (Table) . Conclusions: Mean plasma concentrations of IP-10 were 50 to 90-fold higher than those of IFN-g, both in patients with active TB and LTBI. Assessment of IP-10 might substantially increase the sensitivity of IFN-g release assays (IGRA) for detecting Mtb infection. Ex vivo profiling of cytokines/chemokines using IGRA in combination with flow-cytometer multiplex assays identified additional candidate parameters to confirm Mtb infection and will improve our understanding of TB pathogenesis. results suggested that all isolates from patients of hospitals I and II were identical. No transmissions of patients from hospital I to hospital II had been found and vice versa indicating prevalence of one prevailing C. difficile strain in the local region. Binary toxin was not found in these isolates indicating the strain neither NAP 1 nor 027. Conclusion: One C. difficile strain seems to be predominating in Northern Bavaria CDAD patients. The increased number of CDAD cases was probably promoted by common events, e.g. increased antibiotic use due respiratory infects in winter. Therefore, infection control programmes to restrict spread of C. difficile should not be restricted to hospitals but also should imply other healthcare facilities (nursing homes, house doctors). Giardia lamblia and Yersinia enterocolitica were isolated in 2 and 1 patients, respectively. C. difficile was detected in 66 (9.3%) of all faeces samples; 13 (26%) patients had moderate-severe diarrhoea and 53 (74%) suffered from mild diarrhoea. Of 66 patients with community-onset CDAD, 31 (47%) were healthcare-associated (onset of symptoms within 48 h following admission or within 4 weeks after discharge) and 53% were community-associated. The mean age of 66 patients (24 males and 41 females) with CDAD was 66 years. The most frequent underlying diseases were cardiovascular disease (41%), urogenital disease (20%), lung disease (14%), diabetes mellitus (11%) and malignancy (9%). Recent antibiotic use was reported by 34 (52%) patients with cephalosporins (33%) and fluoroquinolones (33%) as most frequently. Of 66 patients, 19 (29%) received a PPI and 17 (26%) NSAID. Preliminary results of typing of 14 strains revealed 8 different types with type 001 (21%) and type 015 (14%) as the predominant types. Conclusion: Clostridium difficile was the most frequent cause of diarrhoea in a population of patients who visited the GP because of diarrhoea, but 47% was healthcare-associated.",

Few studies have evaluated risk factors for the development of C. difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) in patients with antibiotic-associated diarrhoea. Our objective was to compare clinical characteristics of hospitalised patients who received antibiotics and developed CDAD with hospitalised patients who received antibiotics and developed diarrhoea with negative C. difficile toxin assay in their stool. Methods: A prospective cohort study of hospitalised patients who had received antibiotics and developed diarrhoea were included. CDAD patients were defined as patients who had diarrhoea and was associated with a positive stool toxin A/B enzyme immunoassay test. Univariate and stepwise logistic regression analyses were used for prediction of C. difficile toxin. The predictive capability of the model was demonstrated by a receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve. Results: Fifty-two (24%) out of 217 patients were found to be positive for C. difficile toxin A/B in their stool. The logistic regression model included impaired functional capacity, watery diarrhoea, use of a proton pump inhibitor, use of a histamine receptor blocker, leukocytosis, and hypoalbuminaemia. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve for the model as predictor to positive stool toxin assay was 0.896 [95% CI: 0.661-1.00; p < 0.001], with a 95% specificity and 68% sensitivity. Conclusions: Our results may help clinicians predict the risk of CDAD in hospitalised patients with antibiotic-associated diarrhoea, guide careful antibiotic prescription and early attention to infection control issues. Inpatient cases receiving oral MET or VANC were analysed, and initial dual therapy cases were excluded. Groups were compared on demographics, prior CDAD admissions, and comorbidity proxy measures, the APR-DRG Severity of Illness (SOI) and Risk of Mortality (ROM). Length of stay (LOS), in-hospital mortality, ICU stay, colon resection defined case outcomes. Chi-square and t-tests produced p-values. Results: We identified 32,325 CDAD cases treated first with MET (89%) or VANC (11%). Cases were similar in age (mean 70 years, p = 0.38). Fewer (p < 0.0001) MET than VANC cases were female (58% vs 64%), had a principal CDAD diagnosis (19% vs 31%), prior CDAD admission (10% vs 31%) or prior acid suppressive therapy (42% vs 53%). Higher SOI and ROM were observed in MET vs VANC (p < 0.0001), with 30% MET and 24% VANC rated extreme SOI. During hospitalisation, 15% VANC cases subsequently received MET, and 12% MET received VANC; 9% MET and 11% VANC received IV MET (unknown if specifically for CDAD), and 1.5% MET and 3.1% VANC received rifampin. MET vs VANC had increased LOS (12.8 vs 11.5 days, p < 0.0001), in-hospital death (7.9% vs 6.8%, p < 0.02), and ICU stay (23.2 vs 17.7 days, p < 0.0001). There was no difference in colectomy (1.0% MET vs 0.8% VANC, p = 0.37). Despite lower costs of MET vs VANC therapy, total pharmacy costs were similar ($2,439 vs $2,492, p = 0.52), while total hospitalisation costs were higher ($16,953 vs $14,718, p < 0.0001). Conclusion: Most CDAD patients received MET, and modification to initial therapy occurred in similar proportions of MET and VANC cases. Compared to initial VANC therapy, those treated with MET had higher rates of poor discharge outcomes and greater resource use, however comparisons do not adjust for acute comorbidities.",

Retrospective evaluation of laboratory data showed short episodes of CDAD outbreaks in hospital A in October 2002 (incidence 62/10,000 admissions) and June 2003 (121/10,000); in hospital C in December 2003 (50/10,000) and April 2004 (44/10,000).

Also a laboratory algorithm was introduced to investigate all faecal samples from hospitalised patients with diarrhoea. Subsequently, during the 4th part of 2005 until the 3rd part of 2006, CDAD incidence decreased to a mean of 21/10,000 (range 30\u221213/ /10,000) admissions, corresponding with the national incidence. The percentage type 027 strains decreased from 67% to 36% and 8% in the 3rd 05, 1st 06 and 3rd 06 period, respectively. Conclusion: Specific hygienic measures in combination with restrictions of antibiotic prescriptions and intensified laboratory surveillance are successful to overcome CD 027 outbreaks.",

We have designed and built a seven-strain Staphylococcus aureus microarray, and used it to compare S. aureus isolates from nasal carriage, community-and hospital-acquired disease. We found the S. aureus genome consists of three parts, core, core variable (CV) and mobile genetic elements (MGE). About 70% of the genes in a S. aureus genome are common to all strains and called core. Surprisingly, about 12% of genes are CV, their presence, absence or variabity can be used to classify an isolate into one of about ten human lineages. This classification matches well with multilocus sequence typing clonal complexes. Many CV genes are regulators of virulence genes, or known or predicted to be expressed on the bacterial surface and to interact with the host during nasal colonisation and infection. Since each lineage carries a unique combination of CV genes scattered throughout the chromosome, there was likely to be a common S. aureus ancestor but early evolutionary divergence of lineages, with possible selection in the nose. MGE often carry key resistance and virulence genes, and show substantial variation within and between lineages, indicating frequent horizontal transfer. Interestingly, we have been unable to identify any markers that differ between carriage and typical invasive community isolates (not CA-MRSA), suggesting community-acquired invasive disease is strongly dependent on host factors.",

In the past natural products dominated the field of antibiotics and have had a significant role in the discovery and development of commercially successful drugs of all classes. Over 75% of the antibacterial new chemical entities (NCEs) introduced worldwide between 1981 and 2002 were based on natural products. The unmatched chemical diversity and complexity of natural products is one reason for their success over those obtained by pure chemical synthesis. Another reason for their superiority can be explained by the fact that their synthesis evolved naturally in response to needs and challenges of the natural environment generating compounds which are pre-selected for activity. Despite these facts, natural product research has recently gone through a phase of reduced interest. Big pharmaceutical companies in particular have downgraded or even stopped this kind of research. The reasons for this development may be that natural products are often produced in low quantities and as mixtures of similar compounds, the rediscovery of known compounds and the challenge of natural product derivatisation using classical chemical means. The past few years have witnessed major developments in the use of innovative natural product related technologies, such as fermentation optimisation, separation, structure elucidation and dereplication allowing much faster access to sufficient quantities of pure natural compounds. The application of modern medicinal chemistry adapted to the special needs of natural products is also an efficient way to revisit and recycle old antibiotic classes. The use of modern Genome-based technologies, established in the past few years, offers the opportunity to increase the attractiveness of natural products. Genome-based screening technologies provide fast access to the enormous genetic potential of Actinomycetes, soil bacteria known to represent one of the most important sources for bioactive metabolites. Additionally, genetic engineering technologies will help to overcome two of the main hurdles connected to natural products, the difficulty in derivatising complex structures and the quantitative improvement of the production yield. By focussing on examples in the field of genome based screening and genetic engineering this presentation will give an overview of major improvements that may lead to a rediscovery of natural product based drugs to meet the urgent need for new antibiotics.

However, different phylogenetic relationships among the three clusters were observed in different regions of their genomes. From nsp4 to nsp6, the genotype A strains were clustered with the genotype B strains. For nsp7 and nsp8, and from nsp10 to nsp16, the genotype A strains were clustered with the genotype C strains. From hemagglutinin esterase (HE) to nucleocapsid (N), the genotype B strains were clustered closely with the genotype C strains. Bootscan analysis showed possible recombination between genotypes B and C from nucleotide positions 11500 to 13000, corresponding to the nsp6/nsp7 junction, giving rise to genotype A; and between genotypes A and B from nucleotide positions 21500 to 22500, corresponding to the nsp16/HE junction, giving rise to genotype C. Multiple alignments further narrowed the sites of cross-over to a 143-bp region between nucleotide positions 11750 and 11892, and a 29-bp region between nucleotide positions 21502 and 21530. Genome analysis also revealed variable numbers of tandem copies of a perfect 30-base acidic tandem repeat which encodes NDDEDVVTGD and variable numbers and sequences of imperfect repeats in the N-terminal of nsp3 inside the acidic domain upstream of papain-like protease 1 among the 22 genomes. All 10 CoV-HKU1 with incomplete imperfect repeats (1.4 and 4.4) belonged to genotype A. Conclusions: Three genotypes, genotype A, genotype B and genotype C, exist in CoV-HKU1. Analysis of a single gene is not sufficient for genotyping of CoV-HKU1, but would require amplification and sequencing of at least two gene loci, one from nsp10 to nsp16 (e.g. pol or helicase) and another from HE to N (e.g. spike or N).

            "text": "Objectives: Influenza pandemic preparedness plans are currently being developed on national and international levels. Planning public health responses rely on predictive models by which the impact of different intervention strategies can be evaluated. Previous research has rather focused on producing predictions for certain localities or under specific conditions and on the administration of antiviral drugs. The effectiveness of these interventions depends on various factors which must be explored by sensitivity analyses, based on mathematical models. We investigate how pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions can mitigate an influenza pandemic and examine how intervention schedules, restricted stockpiles and contact reduction (social distancing measures and partial isolation of cases) determine the course of a pandemic wave and the success of interventions. Methods: We provide the freely available planning tool InfluSim ( figure) , a deterministic compartment model, which is based on a system of over 1,000 differential equations and designed to operate with an optimal combination of the competing requirements of precision, realism and generality. It allows for producing time courses and cumulative numbers of influenza cases, outpatient visits, applied antiviral treatment doses, hospitalisations, deaths and work days lost due to sickness, all of which may be associated with economic aspects. Results: The model shows that a timely application of antiviral drugs combined with a quick implementation of contact reduction measures is required to substantially protract the peak of an influenza epidemic and reduce its height. Delays in the initiation of antiviral treatment (e.g. because of parsimonious use of a limited stockpile) result in much more pessimistic outcomes and can even lead to the paradoxical effect that the stockpile is depleted earlier compared to early distribution of antiviral drugs. Conclusion: InfluSim efficiently assists public health planners in designing optimal interventions against pandemic influenza. It reproduces the infection dynamics of pandemic influenza like complex computer simulations while offering at the same time reproducibility, higher computational performance and better operability. When controlling pandemic influenza, pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical measures should not be used exclusively. Contact reduction measures must be part of mitigation strategies and have the advantage to be not limited per se. Objectives: Although influenza (Flu) is an old infectious disease, it will cause pandemics and requires global cooperation for control and prevention. In addition to the avoidance of exposure during the influenza season vaccination has been the most effective modality for preventing influenza epidemics. However, due to the genetic variability of the influenza it requires vaccination every year. Our Department of Health supported free influenza vaccination for aged people (>65 year-old) for years and the host antibody responses are evaluated. Methods: A total of 89 paired sera was collected before and 3 weeks after the vaccination with one dose of a commercial trivalent influenza vaccine for 2006-2007. The paired samples were tested for influenza A and B antibodies by complement fixation (CF) and quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In addition, 83 paired sera were tested by haemagglutination inhibition (HI) using an A/New Caledonia/20/99-like strain. There were 49 males and 34 females, and 47 people were older than 65. Results: Our results indicated that the CF response rates (defined as 4-fold titer increase of the paired sera) for both influenza A and B were low (33.7% and 15.7%, respectively). However, the pre-immunised ELISA titers for both influenza A and B were much higher than normal (average 98.3\u00b145.6 RU/mL for Flu A and 176\u00b157.5 RU/mL for Flu B; normal <22 RU/mL). The overall response rate for HI was 32.5% (27/83), but the response rate of the aged (>65 year-old) was lower (27.7%, 13/47) than people <65 year-old (38.9%, 14/36). However, the rate of pre-immunised sera with protective HI titer (HI 40) was 80.7% (67/83). Conclusion: The antibody responses induced by the 2006-2007 influenza vaccine were low, but the pre-immunised antibody positive rates and titers were high. The phenomenon might reflect the quality of the vaccine and the consequences of previous vaccination. , among nurses with above-average knowledge about the influenza vaccine (OR 2.1) and an underestimation of non-severe AE rates (OR 3.6). Conclusion: HP overestimated the severe AE rates and underestimated the non-severe AE rates of influenza vaccination. The appraisal of these AE rates appears to be very important in the decision of HP to get vaccinated. A better mediation of the actual very low rates of severe adverse effects may improve the influenza-vaccination rates among HP. Objectives: Avian H5N1 influenza viruses could be transmitted to humans, resulting in severe or fatal disease. Aim of this study was to evaluate the immune cross-reactivity between human and avian (H5N1) influenza strains in healthy donors vaccinated for seasonal H1N1/H3N2 influenza A. Methods: Healthcare workers wishing to receive seasonal influenza vaccination at the Spallanzani Institute were enrolled. Blood samples for the assessment of humoral and cell-mediated responses were obtained before and 30 days after vaccination. The frequency of circulating antigen-specific CD4 and/or CD8 T-cells in healthy donors enrolled in the study were analysed by flow cytometry, using intracellular cytokine staining assay after the expansion of effector-cells in vitro. Human sera from the same donors were tested for their HA-inhibition activity against vaccine preparation and neutralisation activity against H5N1 virus.",

This cross-type immunity may represent an important component of the immune response against novel influenza A infections. Considering the local serotype distribution, the direct effect of PCV-7, -10, and -13 was estimated in children under 5 years (<5 y), assuming a 90% vaccination coverage and a 97% effectiveness in reducing IPD caused by vaccine-serotypes. Herd immunity effect was estimated assuming a 40% reduction of IPD caused by vaccine-serotypes. Results: (1) Incidence: The total incidence remained stable throughout the period,~20/100,000 population, whereas the incidence in <5 y increased from 25 to 34. The highest incidence was observed among adults >65 years,~69 per 100,000. 92% of cases presented as bacteraemia. Approx. 100 cases of pneumococcal meningitis were registered annually, with an overall mortality of 20%. Methods: Twenty-seven and 20 healthy adults were immunised with either a PCV or a PPV intramuscularly. Sera were obtained before and at 4 weeks after immunisation to determine IgG pneumococcal antibody titers by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and opsonisation tier by opsonophagocytic killing assay to the 7 serotypes represented in the PCV. Results: Antibody titers and opsonisation titers to 7 pneumococcal serotypes were significantly increased after immunisation in PCV and PPV groups. Post-immune antibody titers to serotype 4, 18C and 23F were significantly higher in PCV groups than in those in PPV group. Also PCV elicited significantly higher fold rise of opsonisation titer compared with PPV in serotype 4, 18C and 23F. Antibody titers and opsonisation titers to 7 serotypes have good correlation in pre-immune sera as well as post-immuue sera in both groups. More than 95% of subjects in both groups have antibody titer 1 mg/mL to 7 serotypes after immunisation. ",

Strains displaying resistance (defined as non-susceptibility based on CLSI breakpoints) to >2 classes were considered MR. Statistical analysis was carried out using linear mixed effects models for repeated measures.

Methods: KPC-specific polymerase chain reaction was performed on total DNA and plasmid DNA from 108 consecutive Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates.

Six of the 13 isolates were identified from three patients, while each of the remaining seven came from individual patients. Eight of the eleven isolates were resistant to imipenem by disk diffusion testing while three of the isolates were fully susceptible. Plasmids containing the KPC gene were isolated and verified by PCR from the 8 imipenem-resistant isolates. In contrast, we were unable to isolate any plasmids from the 3 imipenem-sensitive strains; however, they were positive for the KPC ORF using PCR on total genomic DNA. Two distinct clusters of Klebsiella pneumoniae were seen following repetitive sequence PCR. The first cluster of 7 isolates was 86.0% identical suggesting a clonal expansion while the other 5 isolates were unrelated.

This fact, in combination with a growing number of humans, creates an arena where domestic animals, humans and finally zoonotic pathogens can interact. Influenza A virus is the ultimate actor in this play where some subtypes may change into highly pathogenic forms. These may be transmitted directly to man. Another worrying scenario is that an avian influenza virus will reassort with a circulating human influenza. A genetic trait might then readily go from the human to the bird virus so that avian influenza acquires the capacity to pass from person to person.

The use of fluconazole susceptibility profile as a surrogate marker for prediction of voriconazole susceptibility has also been proposed recently. In addition, based on the modifications of the CLSI M38-A reference method, new guidelines for in vitro susceptibility testing of antifungal agents against Aspergillus spp. have been developed by AFST-EUCAST. A standard assay for testing antifungal agents against dermatophytes is also under development. Further investigations address the applicability of other methods, which are more practical and/or require shorter incubation periods. Among these are Etest, colorimetric methods, flow cytometry, and ergosterol quantitation. Utility of flow cytometry for AFST of yeasts and moulds is being currently studied and appears promising. Assessment of metabolic activity by using XTT colorimetric assay is also being investigated as a novel approach, particularly for determination of quantitative endpoints for testing caspofungin against Aspergillus, and for susceptibility testing of Zygomycetes. Despite these progressions, utility of AFST in direction of antifungal therapy and prediction of clinical outcome is still limited. While in vitro triazole (particularly fluconazole) susceptibility results for Candida appear to be optimally correlated with clinical outcome, data are either limited and investigational or fail to demonstrate any significant in vitro-in vivo correlation for most of the remaining fungus-antifungal drug combinations. Importantly and conclusively, the results obtained by AFST constitute one of the several factors that influence clinical outcome. Optimisation of test methodologies and parameters for routine use and expanded in vitro-in vivo correlation studies may further enhance the role of AFST as an adjunct in direction of antifungal therapy.",

The enzymes vary in their substrate ranges which are often broad and each enzyme is characterised by a particular profile of resistance which allows its putative identification from the conferred phenotype. The enzymes from Gram-positive cocci generally differ from the enzymes detected in Gram-negative bacteria. Generally, the presence of an enzyme confers to the host frank resistance to the antibiotics modified in vitro. However, there are some exceptions, both in Gram-negative and in Gram-positive bacteria. For instance, resistance of Gram-positive organisms to the kanamycin-neomycin group of antibiotics is due to the synthesis of an APH(3 )-III enzyme. The enzyme catalyzes efficient phosphorylation of amikacin in cell-free extracts but does not always determine resistance to this antibiotic. However, bactericidal synergism of amikacin with b-lactams or vancomycin is always abolished. Therefore, the test of kanamycin better predicts the activity of amikacin against Gram-positive organisms. In this case and several others, interpretive reading of susceptibility tests based on identification of resistance phenotypes may help to identify impaired activity of aminoglycosides.",

Staphylococci may be resistant to macrolides by production of a ribosomal methylase encoded by erm genes conferring the MLSB phenotype or by production of an efflux pump encoded by the msr(A) gene. In case of inducible MLSB resistance, clindamycin that is not an inducer remains active. However, constitutively resistant mutants can be selected by clindamycin and clinical failure during treatment by clindamycin have been reported in a few occasions. The use of clindamycin is probably best avoided in severe infections or infections with heavy bacterial inocula. In case of resistance by efflux, clindamycin is not substrate for the pump and the risk for selection of resistant mutants is not greater than that for erythromycin-susceptible isolates. By a disk diffusion test, the inducible MLSB phenotype can be identified by the flattening of the clindamycin zone facing the erythromycin disk. The relative importance of the contaminated inanimate environment is discussed controversially: Whereas outbreaks due to environmental sources have been described repeatedly, its role as a source for endemic colonisation (and, as a consequence, infection) in intensive care patients has not been firmly established. More recent data show that in an ICU, a high figure of 35% of all cases of P. aeruginosa acquisition may originate from contaminated tap water (clonal relationship between isolates) and that retrograde contamination of faucets by patients may occur in 15%. However, surveillance of intestinal colonisation (which plays a relevant role in the epidemiology of P. aeruginosa) was not undertaken. The majority of colonised patients is already colonised on admission, with preceding antibiotic exposure being responsible for the majority of cases of acquired respiratory tract colonisation. With regard to infection control, adequate hand hygiene is essential, whereas 'sterilisation' of sinks or routine use of water filters seems impractical. Alcohol-based handrubs, via dispensers near the bedside or in coat pockets, should be preferred in most situations over hand washing with soap and water. All open water sources including sinks may be a potential habitat of pathogens like P. aeruginosa, and the use of tap water for critically ill or immuno-compromised patients must be restricted. A second pathogen was reported in 65% of patients and Candida sp. was seen in 14%. There were significant regional variations in the distribution of pathogens and the number of culture tests taken (0\u22125.9 cultures per patient admission). The principal pathogen was resistant to the most commonly used antibiotics in 60\u221290% of cases. The prevalence of asymptomatic bacteriuria was about 30% in most regions, while the prevalence of urosepsis varied between 2\u221227% in the regions studied. Conclusions: Urology sections should be encouraged to monitor the susceptibility of pathogens causing NAUTI in order to tailor a better empirical antibiotic treatment. Urologists need to work out guidelines on when to take blood cultures after urological surgery to obtain a more uniform reporting of urosepsis between regions. The high prevalence of urosepsis after urological surgery is a cause of concern.",

            "text": "Escherichia coli accounted for about 80% of organisms in uncomplicated UTIs. In contrast, in complicated UTI many kinds of enterobacteriaceae isolates, staphylococci, enterococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and the other glucose-nonfermentable Gram-negative rod (NFGNR) are isolated. Almost nosocomial UTI (NUTI) is complicated UTI. In the 2003 GPIU study (formerly PEP study), NUTI prevalence rate was 9.4% (326/3350). In the 2003 GPIU study, E. coli was the most frequent pathogen, accounting for about 30% of all pathogens isolated. Pseudomonas (13%), Klebsiella (10%), Enterococcus (9%), and Proteus (7%) were isolated frequently. In our hospital, Enterococcus faecalis was the most frequent of all isolated organisms, accounting for 24%. The other enterococci (12%), S. marcescens (12%), P. aeruginosa (9%), the other NFGNR (9%), E. coli (6%), Staphylococcus epidermidis (6%) were isolated frequently. It is considered that these differences occurred by the difference of patients' background. The fluoroquinolone-and cephem-resistant enterobacteriaceae isolates from patients with NUTI are increasing. Most of the cephem-resistant isolates of E. coli, K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis are producing Extended-Spectrum b-lactamases (ESBLs). ESBLs are plasmid-mediated broad-spectrum b-lactamases. The ratios of ESBL producers in E. coli and K. pneumoniae are quite different in each country (less than 5% to more than 80%). Most of the nosocomial ESBL producers have acquired resistance to non-b-lactams, such as fluoroquinolones, phosphomycin, co-trimoxazole. Some of the multi-drug resistant isolates have no effective oral antibiotics. According to the 2003-2004 GISP study, the ratios of fluoroquinolone resistance of E. coli and K. pneumoniae accounted for about 20%, respectively, that of enterococci accounted for more than 60%. Mechanisms of resistance to quinolones are mainly target mutations, especially GyrA and ParC. Qnr that is plasmid encoded quinolone resistance reported in 2002. The emergence of qnr also alerts us to the potential rapid dissemination of quinolone-resistant determinants. Qnr shows quinolone specific resistance, but the qnrplasmids reported are integron-associated and carry multiple resistance determinants providing resistance to several classes of antimicrobials including b-lactams and aminoglycosides. Multi-drug resistant isolates cause nosocomial spread easily. There are many reports about nosocomial spread of multi-drug resistant ESBL producers. To prevent prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant isolates appropriate antimicrobial selection is needed. Geographic variations in pathogen occurrence and susceptibility profiles require monitoring continuously, and it is important to update treatment guidelines based on susceptibility profile and the results of clinical trials.",

            "text": "Urosepsis accounts for approximately 25% of all sepsis cases and may develop from a community or nosocomial acquired urinary tract infection (UTI). The underlying UTI is almost exclusively a complicated one with involvement of the parenchymatous urogenital organs (e.g. kidneys, prostate) and mostly associated with any kind of obstructive uropathy. If urosepsis originates from a nosocomial infection, a broad spectrum of Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens have to be expected which are often multiresistant. In urosepsis, as in other types of sepsis, the severity of sepsis depends mostly upon the host response. The treatment of urosepsis follows the generally accepted rules of the Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines. Early normalisation of blood pressure and early adequate empiric antibiotic therapy with optimised dosing are equally important to meet the requirements of early goal directed therapy. In most cases of urosepsis an early control of the infectious focus is possible and as important. Optimal supportive measures need to follow the early phase of resuscitation. Although most antibiotics achieve high urinary concentrations there are several unique properties in complicated UTI, and thus in urosepsis, that influence the activity of the antibiotic substances: (i) The renal pharmacokinetics in unilateral and bilateral renal impairment and in unilateral and bilateral renal obstruction differ. (ii) Varations in pH may influence the activity of certain antibiotics. (iii) Biofilm infection is frequently found under these conditions, which may increase the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of the antimicrobials at the site of infection by several 100-folds. In order to assess the antibiotic pharmacodynamic properties in such situations not only the MIC as determined in vitro and the plasma concentrations of the free (unbound) drug, which are the guiding principle for many infections, but also the actual renal excretion and the urinary bactericidal activity of an antibiotic substance should be taken into account. In the treatment of urosepsis it is important to achieve optimal exposure to antimicrobials both in plasma and in the urinary tract. The role of drugs with low renal excretion rate is therefore limited. Since urosepsis originates quite often from catheter associated UTI and after urological interventions, optimal catheter care and optimal strategies to prevent nosocomial UTI may be able to reduce the frequency of urosepsis. 28.5%; p < 0.001) and were more commonly classified into Pneumonia Severity Index high-risk class (group V) (48% vs. 16%; p = 0.001). They also had received more frequently prior corticosteroid (30% vs. 6%; p = 0.001) and antibiotic (44% vs. 17%; p = 0.011) therapy. Multivariate analysis identified COPD (OR = 6.83) and prior corticosteroid therapy (OR = 4.22) as independent risk factors. Patients with CAP due to P. aeruginosa presented more frequently with septic shock at entry (25% vs. 3.8%; p = 0.001) and multilobar pneumonia (50% vs. 25.4%; p = 0.019) than the remaining patients. They were also given more frequently an inappropriate initial empirical antibiotic therapy (68% vs. 9%; p < 0.001). Early (29% vs. 2%; p < 0.001) and overall (55% vs. 8.5%; p < 0.001) case-fatality rates were higher among patients with CAP due to P. aeruginosa. Conclusions: CAP caused by P. aeruginosa is uncommon and occurs mainly in patients with COPD treated with corticosteroids. It frequently presents with shock and causes high case-fatality rates. The risk factors delineated in this study should be considered when selecting initial empirical antibiotic therapy for patients with CAP.",

Observational studies suggest that adherence to guidelines and atypical pathogen cover results in better outcomes. There is concern about the ecological impact, however, of broad-spectrum agents. This study compared mortality in hospitalised patients who had received amoxicillin/macrolide (narrow spectrum, NS) with those who had received either co-amoxiclav/macrolide or a second/ third-generation cephalosporin/macrolide (broad spectrum, BS Objective: Bacteraemia is an important cause of mortality in hospitalised patients. CURB65 has been validated as a predictor of mortality in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) (Lim et al. Thorax 2003), but not in other causes of sepsis. The aim of this study was to assess the performance of CURB65 in patients with bacteraemia. Methods: A retrospective cohort study was performed using data routinely collected in the delivery of the Hull Bacteraemia Service. As part of this service, patients with confirmed bacteraemia are seen at the bedside by an infectious diseases physician. A typed report, which includes physiological data, is then sent to the patient's physician. Patients were included if they had all CURB65 criteria recorded at the point of bacteraemia. 30-day mortality was established by hospital database and stratified by CURB65 score. A receiver operating curve (ROC) was produced and area under the curve and 95% confidence intervals (CI) calculated. Results: Of 151 patient reports, 61 patients (62% male) had a full set of CURB65 criteria. 49% of patients were over 65 years old and 34% were being managed on a renal ward. The most common bacteria were: MSSA (41% of patients), MRSA (23%); various Gram-negatives (16%); thought to be significant coagulasenegative staphylococci (15%); Group A\u2212G streptococci (10%); and enterococci (8%). The most common sources of bacteraemia were: central venous line (31% of patients); intravenous drug use (15%); urinary tract (13%); contamination (10%); and skin/soft tissue (8%). 9% of patients were receiving discordant therapy prior to review. Overall, 30-day mortality was 25%. Recrudescence within 90 days occurred in 5.5% of patients. The table shows 30-day mortality stratified by CURB65 score. The area under the ROC was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.6\u22120.86). Conclusions: This is the first study to assess the performance of CURB65 in a non-respiratory infection. Although preliminary, CURB65 appeared to stratify 30-day mortality in patients with bacteraemia. The cut-off for severe illness may need to be lower, however, than in CAP. There is the potential, therefore, to identify a low-risk cohort of patients (i.e. CURB65 = 0) who may be appropriate for an early switch to oral therapy and discharge from hospital. Likewise, patients at high risk (i.e. CURB65 2) are more likely to need aggressive therapy according to the principals of the surviving sepsis campaign. A large prospective study is warranted. . Mortality occurred rapidly after the onset of symptoms (median 3 days; range 1\u221217 days) in seven patients with non-menstrual STSS (7/32, 22%). Deceased patients were more aggressively treated in comparison to survivors but they never received clindamycin, linezolid or intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg).",

Comparing with menstrual STSS, non-menstrual STSS patients have a high positive blood culture and mortality rate (50% and 22%, respectively). This could reflect an evolution of the S. aureus isolates towards a higher virulence and expression of various superantigenic toxins. Bacteraemia could partially explain the severity of non-menstrual cases and may be a composite form of shock, frontier between septic shock and STSS, potentially more severe than STSS itself. Specific therapeutic intervention has to be implemented for patients with non-menstrual STSS and we proposed the following strategy: rapid wound debridement whatever the importance of local inflammation; rapid addition of anti-toxinic antibiotic such as clindamycin or linezolid; and prescription of IVIg. To determine the best model, Model Selection Criterion (MSC) and coefficient of determination (R2) were taken into account as well as a visual inspection for goodness of fit. Results: Two susceptibility stages were defined for MRSAstage 1: self-replicating and susceptible to linezolid, and stage 2: unsusceptible and metabolic inactive. In the log-growth phase, susceptible bacteria grow with a growth rate constant k s that is greater than their natural death rate constant k d in a certain ratio. Converging to the stationary phase this ratio changes in a non-linear manner, described by an additional N max term. In the presence of linezolid a concentration C dependent kill has to be taken into account. From certain drug specific concentrations on, a maximum effect is reached, described by the maximum kill rate constant k max . However, both the onset of growth and kill can be delayed and modeled by exponential terms, characterised by time t and dg or dk, respectively.

Such concentrations occur under therapeutic conditions at the site of infusion. Subsequently, they were stained with fluoresceinisothiocyanate-or phycoerythrin-conjugated monoclonal IgG mouse-antibodies for the four antigens mentioned above. Cells were incubated with the drugs for 2 h and analysis was carried out after an additional time period of 22 h.

The most pronounced changes were observed at 800 mg/l (erythromycin), 600 mg/l (azithroymcin), and 400 mg/l (clarithromycin). Erythromycin (800 mg/l) caused significantly increased expressions of all epitopes [CD 34 (+6%), E-Selectin (+5%), ICAM-1 (+15%) and VCAM-1 (+5%)]. At 600 mg/l the azalide azithromycin provokes a stronger upregulation of the proinflammatory antigens: CD 34 (+17%), E-Selectin (+16%), ICAM-1 (+27%) and VCAM-1 (+17%).

Type B was found in 10 PSA strains and the individual EC strain, harbouring an integron with aacC4, blaVIM-4 gene cassettes and the insertion sequence ISPpu17.

Objectives: We sought to evaluate the bactericidal effect of human b-defensin 3 against metallo-b-lactamase (MBL)-producing P. aeruginosa clinical isolates. Materials and Methods: A total of 15 unique multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa strains were tested that originated from relevant specimens of patients hospitalised at our hospital. Bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed with the VITEK 2 automated system. According to their drug susceptibilities all clinical isolates were categorised into 3 distinct resistance phenotypes. Metallob-lactamase (MBL) production was detected with the use of Etest MBL strips, according to the manufacturers' instructions. To determine the MBL types all isolates were subjected to PCR analysis to confirm the presence of blaVIM and blaIMP genes. The bactericidal activity of recombinant hbD-3 was assessed by the liquid microdilution assay in the presence of 10mM sodium phosphate buffer, as previously described. Briefly, exponentially growing bacteria (inoculum density of 1\u00d710 4 cfu/mL) were exposed to different concentrations of hbD3 (0.5 ug/mL and 0.25 ug/mL). Following incubation for 20 min at 37\u00baC, 0.1 ml of each sample was plated onto McConkey agar plates. Bactericidal effect was expressed as percentage of reduction in numbers of viable bacteria after 18 to 24 hr incubation at 37\u00baC in ambient air. Results: At a concentration of 0.25 ug/mL, the peptide produced a reduction rate ranging from 55% to 95.4% whereas the use of 0.5 ug/mL of hbD-3 resulted in 68% to 100% killing. The significant variability in the bactericidal effect observed, appears to be independent of the isolates' resistance phenotypes. Conclusion: Despite the relatively low concentrations used, hbD-3 exhibited bactericidal activity against MBL-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa nosocomial strains and therefore it would be an attractive alternative to current theurapeutic agents.

It collects large biological datasets by novel, high-throughput-based technologies and develops computational tools for its bioinformatic analysis. It thus allows a holistic view on complex biological systems and to set up improved biological models, particularly if several different experimental parameters are integrated (for example protein interaction and expression profiling data). Although Systems biology is usually based on screening assays and thus starts without bias, in contrast to hypothesis-driven research, in most cases it eventually leads to a multitude of novel working hypotheses. Particularly interesting are hypotheses derived from bioinformatic concepts like network emergence, robustness and modularity, since it is currently completely unclear if and how they translate into biology. Systems biology-based approaches in infectious diseases are even more complex, as they investigate the interactions between the components of two distinct biological systems, pathogen and host. On the host side, cellular components which directly deal with the control of the infection, i.e. the innate and adaptive immune system, are of particular interest. For the understanding of the pathogenesis, pathogen products counteracting these cellular components are similarly important. By integrating all components of the immune system, Systems biology-based approaches might be able to generate better disease models than previous reductionist approaches focusing on only one or few pathogenic aspects. For example, in herpesviruses, which cause persistent latent infections, both the innate as well as the adaptive immune system and their components play a role at different time points after infection and thus have to be considered to fully understand their pathogenesis.",

Due to the high rate of replicative cycles, and the errorprone polymerase (able to make about 1 error out of 10,000-30,000 nucleotides), the entire genome of HIV can be changed every day. Based on these factors, it has been calculated that HIV genome varies in one day more than the variability of influenza virus (another highly variable virus) in 10 years, and more than the variability of the human genome during the whole history of mankind. Despite this immense potentiality, only few mutations that are randomly produced during the daily replicative cycles are fixed within the viral genome. This is because of a bottleneck phenomenon related to the constraint of target cells (unable to support the replication of all vira strains daily generated) and because the large majority of the mutations generate variants whose replicative capacity is very low/ absent, or in any case lower than the one that characterised the wild type strain.

In case of therapeutic pressure, the ability of the virus to rapidly deselect the wild-type strain in favour of a resistant mutant is a function of the strength of drug regimen. In case of fully suppressive therapy, the virus is unable to generate and/or select new variants, the wild-type strain remains prevalent and the therapy is highly successful. By contrast, if therapeutic pressure is inconsistent, erratic, or not sufficiently potent, the virus continues its replicative cycles under drug presence, and this represents the best environment to select mutant-resistant strains. The rapidity with which this selection occurs is a function of the genetic barrier of each drug, that in turn is related to the number of mutations occurring to generate a new variant fully resistant to each drug. A low genetic barrier means few (1 or 2) mutations are required to generate resistant variants, that will occur rapidly. A high genetic barrier (5\u22126 or more mutations occurring in sequence) makes more difficult and slower the process of selection of a resistant strain.

In this study, comparative single-dose response experiments were performed with API-1252 and linezolid to assess their quantitative oral efficacy against hospital-acquired (HA)-MRSA and community-acquired (CA)-MRSA. Methods: MICs were determined by CLSI guidelines. Single dose PK studies were conducted. The thighs of neutropaenic mice were inoculated (~10 6 ) with a single isolate of HA-MRSA or CA-MRSA. API-1252 and linezolid were administered orally in single doses ranging from 1 to 300 mg/kg. CFU were determined in infected thighs 24 hours postdose. Efficacy was determined as the change in CFU/thigh at 24 hours versus the 0 hour controls. Results: MICs of API-1252 and linezolid against both isolates were 0.004 and 2 mg/L, respectively. For the HA-MRSA, CFU reduction was seen with API-1252 doses of 10 mg/kg. While the 10 mg/kg dose displayed a variable effect for the CA-MRSA, doses of 40 mg/kg of API-1252 resulted in sustained antibacterial activity. Linezolid doses of 100 mg/kg were required to maintain sustained antibacterial activity over the 24 hour exposure period for both isolates. With both MRSA isolates, the 80% maximally effective dose (ED80, mg/kg), ED50, and ED5 were 4\u221220\u00d7 lower for API-1252 when compared to linezolid. Pharmacodynamic index correlations showed that the fAUC/MIC of API-1252 was the best predictor of efficacy. For both MRSA strains the API-1252 fAUC/MIC ranges resulting in the ED80, ED50, and ED5 were 32\u221269, 29\u221232, and 6\u221225, respectively. These ED values were similar to that observed with MSSA for API-1252 (ICAAC 2006, Abstract F1-759). Conclusion: These data demonstrate the superior dose-response of API-1252 as compared to linezolid against HA-MRSA and CA-MRSA in the mouse thigh model. fAUC/MIC appears to best characterise the PD profile of this novel agent. The low efficacious fAUC/MIC values support the further development of API-1252 as a novel oral and intravenous agent for challenging staphylococcal infections. The emergence of multi-drug-resistant pathogens, including methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), combined with the absence of new antibiotics from the pharmaceutical sector demands that alternative anti-MRSA agents are scientifically evaluated and developed as a matter of urgency. Recent studies have shown the enormous potential of the use of phage endolysins as potential therapeutics. Objectives: To characterise the staphylococcal phage K-derived protein, LysK, a bifunctional endolysin with antimicrobial activity against MRSA, with a view to identifying the domain or domains responsible for lytic activity. Methods: The lysK gene was PCR-amplified from phage K cDNA and cloned into the pTOPO (Invitrogen) vector. The domain architecture of LysK was studied by performing deletion analysis on the intact LysK protein using PCR and/or slicing by overlap extension (SOEing) PCR on this pTOPO clone. To assess the activity of LysK deletion derivatives, constructs were recreated in the pQE60 (Qiagen) expression system. SDS-PAGE and zymogram assays were used to visualise the activity of LysK and its deletion derivatives in pQE60 and to assess which domain(s) the lytic activity of LysK could be ascribed to.",

Analysis of deletion derivatives of LysK confirmed that while Amidase_2 and SH3b domains had no significant activity alone, the CHAP domain was as active as the intact LysK, displaying an identical lytic spectra when examined by zymographic assays. While attempting to define the smallest possible functional CHAP domain with antimicrobial activity, we found that the endopeptidase activity associated with the CHAP domain is contained within the first 161 amino acids of LysK. Further deletions resulted in a complete loss of antimicrobial activity. The 161 amino acid truncated CHAP has been found to be active against the main MRSA strains emerging in hospitals in the local area.

            "text": "Two-component signal transduction systems are ubiquitous in bacteria and are woven within the fabric of the regulatory processes that are used to sense environmental change and respond accordingly. These systems allow the bacterial cell to continually re-programme patterns of gene expression rapidly and in defined ways to bring about cellular adaptation as a direct consequence of specific environmental signals. To achieve this function two-component systems are composed of a signal ligandresponsive sensor histidine kinase that is usually an integral membrane protein, and a response regulator that is often a transcriptional regulator. Signal ligands are sensed by the sensor histidine kinase resulting in ATP-dependent autophosphorylation and the subsequent transfer of the phosphoryl moiety to the cognate response regulator influences its DNA binding and transcriptional activity, and therefore gene expression. For bacterial pathogens these signal transduction pathways are frequently key elements in the regulation of a myriad of virulence responses that facilitate colonisation, survival and persistence within the host environment and at specific host sites. Examples of the types of virulence attributes modulated by two-component systems include biofilm formation, quorum sensing, resistance to host defence peptides, and secreted toxin production. In addition, two-component systems that are essential for bacterial viability are known to exist. For these and other reasons two-component signalling systems and their variants have been recognized as targets for the development of anti-infective drugs. In this presentation the features of two-component systems that make them potentially attractive targets for the development of novel antiinfectives will be discussed. The mechanisms of action and limitations of some classes of previously developed two-component system inhibitors will also be discussed, as will the current and future perspectives for the development of selective inhibitors of these bacterial signalling systems. The global increase of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has generated much attention over the last decade. The public have linked the so-called 'superbug' with their experience of dirty hospitals, but the precise role of cleaning in the control of this organism is unknown [1] . There is some support for a link between poor hygiene in hospitals and MRSA, since its epidemiological characteristics permit survival in the clinical environment as well as make it potentially vulnerable to the cleaning process [2] . Unfortunately, we cannot assess the risk of acquiring MRSA from the clinical environment because there is no way of measuring the effect of cleaning. Perhaps it is time to introduce microbiological standards for surface levels in hospitals [3] . This would not only allay concerns over the grading of hygiene by visual assessment, but would provide a means whereby the removal of dirt becomes an evidence-based science [3, 4] . Without such evidence, the importance of a clean hospital will continue to remain speculative. Even if the benefits of cleaning are well established, buffing the floors to a shine will not reduce the number of patients acquiring MRSA. Floors may form a repository for a variety of organisms but they do not play a major role in HAI [5] Pathogens are delivered to patients on hands, and it is more likely that contaminated hand-touch sites are a greater risk for MRSA acquisition [3, 6] . Such areas should be prioritised when managing cleaning schedules, since a targeted approach to hospital cleaning might be a useful control factor for MRSA [7] . We will never be able to guarantee consistent hand hygiene nor a sustained reduction in antibiotic consumption. Improvements in cleaning, however, are not insurmountable [1] . More research on the association between MRSA and environmental hygiene is urgently required. Basic cleaning could deliver significant cost benefits in MRSA control and could ultimately be our only defence against this organism.",

            "text": "Carriage of MRSA is most often transient but can be persistent. In patients carriage is associated with an increased risk for the development of infection. Healthcare workers who carry MRSA may transmit the micro-organism to patients. To control transmission and prevent the development of infection, eradication of carriage may be indicated. The decision to start decolonisation therapy should be carefully balanced with the risk for the development of resistance. Factors that are associated with increased failure rates are: the presence of wounds or other skin lesions, the presence of indwelling devices, multisite carriage and the presence of reservoirs at home. In individuals without these risk factors treatment with mupirocin nasal ointment is succesfull in the majority of subjects. It is often combined with the application of antiseptic showering. In individuals who fail on this topical treatment or with the presence of risk factors for failure, systemic antimicrobial treatment is indicated. Well-designed trials are not available so at present an evidencebased recommendation can not be made. The existing data indicate that a combination of two agents including rifampicin is preferred. The choice of the agents should be based on the susceptibility testing results. Treatment failure may be based on recolonisation from a persisting reservoir at home. Therefore, in patients who (repeatedly) fail on decolonisation therapy these sources should be sought for. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) was set up in 2002 following a decade of food scares and a loss of confidence by the European public which led to a complete overhaul of the European Union food safety system and policies. EFSA's mission is to provide Risk Assessment on matters related to Food and Feed Safety and to communicate on these risks. In 2005, twenty-four Member States, Iceland, Norway, and Switzerland submitted information on the occurrence of zoonoses, zoonotic agents, antimicrobial resistance and foodborne outbreaks to the European Commission and EFSA. Campylobacteriosis was found to be the most frequently reported zoonotic disease in humans within EU. Reported Campylobacter cases increased by 7.8% compared to the previous year rising to an incidence rate of 51.6 cases per 100,000 people and to a total of 197,363 recorded cases. Salmonellosis remained the second most frequent zoonosis with 171,775 reported human cases, despite the fall by 9.5% to an incidence rate of 38.2 compared to 2004. Salmonella was most often reported from fresh poultry and pig meat where proportions of positive samples up to 18% were detected. In table eggs, findings of positive samples ranged from 0% to 6%, but over the past 5 years, an overall decreasing trend in occurrence of Salmonella in the eggs was observed. In animal populations, Salmonella was most frequently detected from poultry flocks. Salmonella, Campylobacter and viruses were the most important causes of reported foodborne outbreaks in 2005. Egg and bakery products were the most common reported sources of Salmonella outbreaks, whereas broiler meat was an important source for both Salmonella and Campylobacter outbreaks. Foodborne virus outbreaks were most often caused by drinking water, fruits and vegetables. Relatively high proportions of Campylobacter and Salmonella isolates from animals and food were resistant to antimicrobials commonly used in treatment of human diseases. This is especially the case for resistance to fluoroquinolones in Campylobacter isolates from poultry. Foodborne infections caused by these resistant bacteria pose a particular risk to humans due to possible treatment failure. When the results of the routine monitoring of laying-hen flocks are compared to the results from an EU-wide, fully harmonised Salmonella baseline study in laying-hen holdings, the prevalences in the baseline study are remarkably higher than those in routine monitoring. This reflects the different sensitivities of sampling scheme and sample types used and demonstrates that a harmonised protocol should be used when comparing the situation in one Member State with another.",

The clinical manifestations range from acute gastroenteritis to divers postinfectious sequelae, most notably reactive arthritis. The pathogenicity of these Gram-negative bacteria has been studied intensively during the last decades, resulting in identification and molecular characterisation of a set of chromosomally and extrachromosomally (plasmid pYV) encoded pathogenicity factors (PF). Here, the function of the PFs in the context of cell culture and animal infection models will be discussed. The most intriguing PFs are the yersinia outer proteins (Yops) which are \"microinjected\" into host cells via a type 3 secretion system (T3SS) and function as \"tranquilliser\" towards the innate host defence. Several PFs of yersiniae have become prototypic members of growing families of PFs: such as the invasin, the trimeric autotransporter (TATA) Yersinia adhesin (YadA) and the siderophore yersiniabactin encoded by high pathogenicity island (HPI). The Yersinia invasin (Inv) is closely related to the intimins (EaeA) of enteropathogenic (EPEC) and enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC). The Yersinia adhesin (YadA) is a trimeric autotransporter and member of the oligomer coiledcoil adhesin (Oca) family which comprises adhesins of Haemophilus influenzae (Hia), Moraxella catarrhalis (UspA) and other species. The yersiniabactin biosynthetic gene cluster of the HPI is widely spread among members of the family of Enterobacteriaceae and has become a marker for extraintestinal pathogenicity, in particular in E. coli. The molecular analysis of the pathogenicity of Yersinia has not only improved our understanding of bacterial mechanism of invasion and persistence but has also provided us with new tools for laboratory diagnosis and prevention. Several PFs turned out to be useful antigens for (i) differentiation between virulent and avirulent Y. enterocolitica, (ii) detection of a class-specific serum antibody response (serological diagnosis) and (iii) vaccination. Moreover, the T3SS of yersiniae is suitable for delivery of antigens to antigen presenting cells and, thus, opens a new strategy for the design of oral live vaccine carrier strains.",

Currently, the most frequently identified pathotypes are the enteropathogenic (EPEC), enterotoxigenic (ETEC), enteroinvasive (EIEC), enterohaemorrhagic (EHEC), enteroaggregative (EAEC) and diffusely adherent (DAEC) E. coli strains. Individual classes are defined on the basis of more or less characterised interactions between the bacterial cell and the host when inducing diarrhoea. There are several problems associated with the recognition of these strains in the laboratory. Easily detectable phenotypic markers sufficiently specific and sensitive to distinguish these strains from their non-pathogenic counterparts are not known. Although certain virulence factors (toxins, adhesins, invasins) are always, or often present in particular groups, the detection of their expression frequently goes beyond the capabilities of diagnostic laboratories. The use of molecular methods specific to genes of these factors, often in multiplexed PCR systems, is currently the most straightforward diagnostic approach. The detection of some of these genes (e.g. Shiga toxin, stx, or intimin, eae) can serve screening purposes but their identification may not prove the actual virulence of the isolate. Virulence factors can be shared by members of different pathotypes, and can be present in isolates recovered from healthy individuals or in non-pathogenic strains. For some classes it is still not clear which particular combination(s) of these genes are necessary to cause disease (e.g. EAEC), while in others the existence of subgroups with various pathogenic potential are already known to exist (e.g. EPEC, or Shiga toxin producing strains). Currently, the lack of straightforward diagnostic algorithms limits our knowledge on the epidemiology of diarrhoea-causing E. coli. Furthermore, more data on the incidence of these pathotypes should help to understand the role of the individual host's susceptibility in the outcome when encountering these strains.",

            "text": "Since their discovery antimicrobials have been extensively used in livestock and poultry, with significant beneficial effects on food animal health and production efficiency. Most classes of antimicrobials used in animals, including fluoroquinolones, have human analogues. Fluoroquinolones (FQ) are used in animal production primarily for: (1) therapy; (2) prophylaxis; (3) infection control (metaphylaxis); and (4) growth promotion in healthy animals. In contrast to human medicine in which treatment is customarily directed at the patient, entire groups of animals may be treated with the use of medicated feed and/or water. Moreover, growth-promoting dosages are usually at low concentrations for extended time periods, therefore both practices are a potentially significant driving force in accelerating the emergence of resistant bacteria in these animals that can be transferred through contact or food to infect humans. The acquisition of quinolone resistance in Gramnegative bacteria is mainly due to chromosomal mutations either in topoisomerase genes (mainly gyrA and parC) or in genes associated with a decreased uptake or by increased efflux of quinolones. In addition, a plasmid conferring low levels of quinolone resistance linked to the presence of the qnr gene, which encodes a protein protecting DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV from quinolones, has been reported. The above mentioned mechanisms have been described in both Escherichia coli and Salmonella spp. and generate an increased level of FQ resistance in a step-wise model, with the first mutation found either in the gyrA gene or in genes involved in efflux pump(s), such these producing an overexpression of acrAB. However, Campylobacter spp. easily acquire high levels of FQ resistance associated with a mutation in the gyrA gene, likely because this microorganism does not have topoisomerase IV. Several studies have demonstrated an association between FQ use in animals and the subsequent isolation of FQ-resistant bacteria from the same animal. Antimicrobial-resistant enteric pathogens can reach humans through direct animal contact, or more commonly, through ingestion of contaminated water or foods. Three scenarios may be proposed by which the use of FQ in food animals could affect the treatment of diseases in humans: (1) FQ-resistant bacterial pathogens are selected, and food is contaminated during slaughter and/or preparation. After consumption of the food, these pathogens cause an infection that requires antibiotic treatment and therapy is compromised; (2) FQ-resistant bacteria non-pathogenic to humans are selected in the animal. When the contaminated food is ingested, the bacteria transfer FQ-resistance determinants, such as plasmid carrying the qnr gene, to other bacteria in the human gut, commensal and potential pathogens; and (3) FQs remain as residue in food products, which allow the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria after the food is consumed.",

Objectives: It has been suggested that tuberculosis (TB) in the elderly is often atypical and difficult to diagnose. There is a lack of information about TB in people over 80 years of age. The aim of this study was to examine current clinical manifestations, time to diagnosis and outcomes in old ( 65 years) and in very old ( 80 years) patients with TB. Diagnosis of TB infection was based on anamnesis for TB risk, two step tuberculin skin testing (TST) and chest X-ray. Patients were followed up throughout the period of chemoprophylaxis and adherence was monitored by determining isoniazid metabolites in urine (or urine colour when appropriate). A positive TST was defined as an induration 5 mm. Results: 210 patients, 64% women, mean age 52 years, were evaluated. Baseline illness: 60.5% rheumatoid arthritis, 13.8% cutaneous psoriasis, 13.3% psoriatic arthritis, 11% ankylosing spondylitis, and 1.4% Crohn's disease. Thirty-eight (80.2%) patients were on immunosuppressive treatment. Thirty-one (14.9%) patients had BCG-vaccination, 6 had been treated for TB, and 2 had prior positive TST. Of 201 patients who underwent TST, 84 (41.8%) resulted positive (59 and 25 in the first and second test respectively), and 117 (58.2%) resulted negative. Chemoprophylaxis was given to 79 (39.3%) patients: 78, isoniazid for 9 months and 1 rifampin for 4 months. Three patients (3.8%) experienced a 5-fold increase of transaminase level above the ULN. After a 237 patient-years follow up, one of the 130 patients who finally received anti-TNF treatment developed TB (0.42%; 95% CI: 0.01\u22121.71). His twostep TST resulted negative and he began on adalimumab. Five months later, TB developed. Conclusion: Systematic and protocolised assessment for TB infection and its treatment when indicated is a reliable and useful method to prevent anti-TNF-associated TB. Our data show that two-step TST is helpful to detect TB infection in a significant number of patients. Prolonged treatment with isoniazid seems to be safe in anti-TNF treated patients.",

            "text": "Objectives: Interferon-gamma release assays (IGRA), such as the QuantiFERON \u00ae -TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT; Cellestis Ltd., Carnegie, Australia), are increasingly used for the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB). These tests exploit immunological mechanisms that normally contain Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infecting the human host. Failed containment results in clinical TB and is associated with proliferating Mtb. We thus wondered if in this situation indeterminate or negative QFT-GIT results were associated with positive microscopy, thus serving as a surrogate for the bacterial burden. Methods: Between November 2004 and October 2006, 67 consecutive patients with culture-confirmed TB were prospectively enrolled. Patients had received no or less than 14 days of antituberculous therapy (n = 58) or were recruited within two months since begining treatment (n = 9). Severe immunosuppressive conditions were present in 14 (21%). QFT-GIT was performed according to the manufacturers' instructions. Laboratory investigations included fluorescence microscopy for acidfast bacilli, and culture on both liquid and solid media. Univariate and multivariate analysis were done in StatView \u00ae version 5.0 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). Results: Overall, 52%, 36%, and 12% of the patients had pulmonary, extrapulmonary, or combined pulmonary and extrapulmonary TB, respectively. In one patient, no microscopy result was available as Mtb was only detected in blood culture. Microscopy was positive in 40/66 patients (61%; 95% CI: 49\u221272%); respiratory and extrapulmonary specimens were smear-positive in 30/39 (77%) and 10/27 (35%) of TB patients, respectively. Overall, QFT-GIT was positive in 51 (76%; 95% CI: 65\u221285%) TB patients; indeterminate or negative QFT-GIT results occurred in 6 (9%) and 10 (15%) TB patients, respectively. Age and gender did not influence the QFT-GIT test result. However, the likelihood of having a negative or indeterminate QFT-GIT test result was significantly and independently associated with a positive microscopy (odds ratio [OR] 5.8, 95% CI: 1.2\u221228.2%; p = 0.03) and with immunesuppression (OR 3.2, 95% CI: 0.91\u221211.4, p = 0.08). Conclusions: To our knowledge this is the first study that demonstrates a significant association of smear-positive TB and negative or indeterminate QFT-GIT results. This association was independent of, and stronger than, the effect of concomitant immune-suppression. The finding has implications for the use of QFT-GIT in clinical practice. Objective: Duration of exposure to tuberculosis (TB) is a major risk factor for transmission of the disease. Current WHO guidelines, based on transmission of TB on aeroplane flights, recommend an 8 hour period as a cut off for screening. However this was before the routine use of IFN-g assays. We compared Mantoux skin testing with QUANTIFERON-TB GOLD (QFN) in a hospital associated outbreak, stratifying patients by duration of contact. Methods: Hospital contacts of the index case were screened in a sequential manner (close contacts sharing the same room for 8 hours, contacts on the same ward for 8 hours and contacts on ward <8 hours Objectives: Nation-wide surveillance on transmission and resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the Netherlands has functioned since 1993. Presumably due to a lower transmissibility and a well-organised tuberculosis control, transmission of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) was so far limited to single secondary cases. However, a MDR strain with an unusually low level of rifampicin resistance (MIC 1\u22122 mg/l) was transmitted from a single source to nine persons, of whom three developed active disease so far. In the current study we assessed the molecular basis of the INH and rifampicin resistance of the outbreak strain and its implications for transmissibility and therapy. Methods: The katG and rpoB gene of the MDR strain were sequenced and the minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) to INH and rifampicin was determined. DNA fingerprinting of M. tuberculosis isolates and conventional contact tracing was performed to investigate the spread of the MDR strain. Results: The respective outbreak strain had a Ser315Thr mutation in the katG gene (k315). INH resistant strains with k315 mutation were previously found to maintain a higher transmissibility than other INH resistant strains. An Asp516Tyr mutation was found in the rpoB gene (r516). Phenotypically, most of the outbreak isolates were interpreted resistant, but a part of the isolates were read as susceptible, which confused the therapy guidance and the surveillance of MDR-TB. Conclusion: The relatively high rate of transmission of this k315/r516 variant may be related to evolutionary development of M. tuberculosis to maintain its transmissibility despite the adaptation to withstand the therapy by our most important anti-mycobacterial drugs; INH and rifampicin. More studies are needed to investigate the contribution of k315/r516 MDR strains to transmission of MDR-TB. The consequences of the unusual low level of rifampicin resistance for therapy guidance and surveillance will be determined. It is considered to introduce the term \"intermediate susceptibility\" to indicate this level of rifampicin resistance. Objectives: The \"Real Time TB\" assay (RT-TB) is a new multiplex real time PCR assay that allows the rapid detection and differentiation of the M. tuberculosis complex from other mycobacteria. The assay targets the IS6110 element and the RD9 specific region that differentiate M. tuberculosis (IS6110 positive -RD9 positive) from the other mycobacterial species included in the M. tuberculosis complex (IS6110 positive -RD9 negative). We recently evaluated the first version of the RT-TB kit, demonstrating that the assay is sensitive, particularly in smear negative-culture positive clinical samples. Here, we report on the evaluation of a new version of the RT-TB assay in which the labelling of the IS6110 probe has been modified in order to improve its stability and detection level.",

Further experiments are in progress to confirm these preliminary data. Objectives: A Dot-Blot hybridisation assay that detects all mutations occurring in the M. tuberculosis rpoB hot-spot region is being developed. The assay uses five probes, capable of binding to a different target segment within the rpoB hot-spot region of the wild-type M. tuberculosis genome. The present study is a preliminary investigation to assess the suitability of the assay for detection of resistance mutations in rpoB in clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis from Delhi, India. Methods: Susceptibility testing of 142 isolates of M. tuberculosis was carried out by proportion method and confirmed by BACTEC 460TB system. Dot-Blot assay was performed on 106 isolates with two of the probes hybridising to the wild-type sequence of M. tuberculosis, from codons 522 to 527 (Probe D) and 528 to 533 (Probe E). Absence of hybridisation with any of the probes in the assay when a mutation was present indicated Rifampicin resistance, a surrogate marker for Multidrug-resistant M. tuberculosis. Results: Susceptibility testing of 142 isolates revealed isoniazid resistance in 53.5%, rifampicin resistance in 41%, streptomycin resistance in 53% and ethambutol resistance in 37% of strains. Fortyfive strains (32%) were multidrug resistant. Further analysis of the data showed that 96.4% of rifampicin-resistant strains and 100% of ethambutol-resistant strains had co resistance to one or the other antituberculous drug. It was also interesting to note that 77% of the rifampicin-resistant strains were multidrug resistant, while the corresponding figure for ethambutol-resistant strains was 87%. Dot-Blot hybridisation assay with probes D and E was carried out on 106 isolates of M. tuberculosis, of which 43 were resistant to rifampicin. Of the rifampicin-resistant isolates tested, 15 did not hybridise with probe E, indicating a mutation at this site. The results of 10 strains were confirmed by sequencing when a mutation was detected in 9 strains at codon 531 and in one of them at codon 533. The remaining 28 rifampicin-resistant strains, which hybridised with probe E, may have a mutation at a site other than that complimentary to probe E. Of these, 10 hybridised with probe D, indicating a mutation at the site complimentary to probe D (codons 522 to 527). Of the 63 rifampicin-susceptible isolates, 62 (98%) hybridised with probes D and E, indicating a wild-type sequence.",

The agreement rate was 75.6% with those determined by the API STAPH when these CoNS isolates were identified into species level by the MALDI-TOF. Seven PVL-positive MRSA isolates were correctly recognized by the MALDI-TOF with 100% accordance with the results determined by real-time PCR. The whole process, from the sample preparation to result analysis, can be completed between 1.5 and 2.5 hours, which greatly shortens the time usually needed for current phenotypic identification. Conclusion: MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry provides a rapid and relevant system for clinical identification of staphylococci. Detecting PVL protein directly from clinical isolates provides a bacterial identification system that is desirable in clinical diagnostic services. Objectives: Bacteroides fragilis is the Gram-negative anaerobe isolated most often from human infections. Some B. fragilis strains produce a 20 kDa enterotoxin (BFT). Enterotoxigenic B. fragilis (ETBF) have been isolated from various diarrhoeic animal species and epidemiological studies worldwide note a significant correlation between ETBF and human diarrhoeal disease, especially in children. The prevalence of ETBF in gastrointestinal diseases in the UK, however, has not been investigated, partly due to the lack of a simple identification test that can be used in diagnostic laboratories. The aim of this study was to develop a sensitive and specific multiplex PCR assay for the detection of ETBF directly from faeces, and to investigate if ETBF are associated with cases of community-acquired diarrhoea in the UK. Methods: Primers were designed from published enterotoxin sequences to amplify 416 bp of bft, and multiplexed with primers amplifying 293 bp of nanH (+ve control for presence of B. fragilis). The assay was validated against 136 strains from 52 species. DNA was extracted from stools using the QIAamp DNA stool mini kit (Qiagen). Spiking experiments were used to determine sensitivity of the assay. Stool was obtained from 193 cases of community-acquired diarrhoea, selected on the basis that no other bacterial pathogen had been identified. Where bft was detected in DNA extracts, a second novel multiplex PCR assay was used to determine which of the 3 bft isoforms was present. Results: The PCR assay for ETBF was found to be 100% specific and had a detection limit of 10 4 cfu/g stool. 13% (25/193) of the diarrhoea samples gave a positive result for bft and nanH. The predominant isoform in the ETBF +ve samples was bft-1 (n = 20, 80%). Three samples had bft-2 and 1 had bft-3. A diarrhoeal sample from a 1-yr old male yielded PCR amplimers for both bft-1 and bft-2 suggesting carriage of at least 2 different ETBF strains. Conclusion: The multiplex PCR assay was highly specific for ETBF and allowed detection without the need for culture. This is the first report of ETBF in community-acquired diarrhoea in the UK. The distribution of isoforms in the clinical samples was similar to earlier reports from Europe, but the occurrence of 2 different bft isoforms in a faecal sample has not been described before. The finding of ETBF in a high proportion (13%) of samples for which there was no other bacterial explanation for the diarrhoea merits further investigation of this pathogen.",

This study aimed to compare the levels of Aspergillus GM antigen in HIV-infected patients with Penicillium marneffei infection and cryptococcosis. Methods: Stored sera of 14 HIV-infected patients with P. marneffei infection (9 [64.3%] with fungaemia and 7 [50%] with cavitary lung lesions) and 22 HIV-infected patients with cryptococcosis (14 [63.6%] with fungaemia and 8 [36.4%] with cavitary lung lesions) diagnosed between January 2000 and October 2006 were subjected to Aspergillus GM antigen testing using a commercial kit. Medical records of those patients with invasive fungal infections were reviewed to exclude the possibility of aspergillosis and concurrent use of antibiotics ever reported to interfere the interpretation of GM antigen test. The median time between diagnosis of invasive fungal infection and collection of serum samples was 0 day (range, \u22127 to 6 days) for penicilliosis and 1 day (range, 0 to 6 days) for cryptococcosis. Results: HIV-infected patients with penicilliosis had a statistically significantly higher optic density (O.D.) index of Aspergillus GM antigen (median 3.19; range, 0.158->20) than those with cryptococcosis (median 0.247; range, 0.112\u22123.849) (p < 0.0001). Of the patients with penicilliosis, patients with fungaemia had a statistically significantly higher O.D. index of Aspergillus GM antigen (median 10.48; range, 0.401->20) compared with patients without fungaemia (median 0.378; range, 0.158\u22124.419) (p < 0.0001). Of the patients with cavitary lung lesions but without fungaemia, the median O.D. index of Aspergillus GM antigen was also significantly higher in penicilliosis than in cryptococcosis (1.009 [range, 0.247\u22124.419] vs 0.227 [range, 0.112\u22123.849]; p = 0.009). Conclusion: Our study suggest that O.D. index of Aspergillus GM antigen is elevated in HIV-patients with penicilliosis when compared with those patients with cryptococcosis.

Fonseca, J.C. Sousa (Porto, PT) Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of dynamic conditions and antibiotic-induced morphological changes on growth, adhesion and biofilm formation ability of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Methods: A modified microtitre plate assay was used to quantify adhesion, biofilm formation and planktonic culture density of Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 under the effect of 0.5 Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of Piperacillin/Tazobactam, Imipenem and Meropenem. Hydrodynamic conditions were obtained by orbital shaking at 250 rpm with the presence of a glass bead in each microtitre well. Results: These conditions decreased the adhesion and biofilm formation abilities of bacteria with antibiotic-induced morphological changes in comparison to static conditions. The planktonic culture density significantly correlates with adhesion but not with biofilm formation. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate the importance of using a high-throughput dynamic model to assess the adhesion and biofilm formation deficient behaviour of P. aeruginosa with antibiotic-induced morphological changes and suggest the possible use of sub-MIC antibiotics in clinical applications to prevent infections acquired by haematogenous spread. This dynamic model contributes to a better simulation of in vivo conditions of adhesion and biofilm formation of P. aeruginosa with altered morphologies induced by b-lactam antibiotics.

Launois (Epalinges, CH; Osaka, JP)Objectives: Some features of the cutaneous pathologies observed in patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis can be reproduced in the murine model of infection with L. major. After subcutaneous injection of parasites in C57BL/6, mice are resistant to infection; in contrast BALB/c mice are susceptible to infection. Resistance and susceptibility to the infection were related to the development of polarised Th1 and Th2 response. Keratinocytes are the first effector cells encountering parasites during infection with L. major but their role in the initiation of the immune response is mainly ignored. The aim of this study is to analyse the role of the interaction between L. major and keratinocytes in the subsequent immune response induced by infection with this parasite. Methods: Cultured primary murine keratinocytes from neonatal C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice (1\u22123 days old) were stimulated in vitro by L. major LV39 strain (MHRO/Sv/59/P strain), and mRNA expression and secretion of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-a) and chemokines (MIP-2) were analysed. Results: Parasites adhere to keratinocytes through the flagellar tip, the flagellar base or with the posterior pole in both strains of mice, but they never infect keratinocytes. Whereas this interaction induces an upregulation of IL-1 and MIP-2 mRNA expression and secretion in both BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice, IL-6 is produced in response to L. major only in BALB/c mice. Furthermore, we demonstrated that TLR-2 \u2212/\u2212 mice are unable to produce MIP-2 in response to L. major stimulation. Conclusion:",

Edelstein (Smolensk, RU) Objectives: To determine the prevalence of major molecular class A extended-spectrum b-lactamases (ESBLs) of TEM, SHV and CTX-M families among nosocomial Enterobacteriaceae from Russian ICUs. Methods: A total of 1373 consecutive nosocomial isolates of Enterobacteriaceae collected as part of the national surveillance study of antimicrobial resistance in ICUs of 32 Russian hospitals in 2002-2004 were screened for ESBL production using the MIC and doubledisk synergy tests with cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime and clavulanic acid. All strains with ESBL phenotype were tested for the presence of TEM, SHV and CTX-M ESBL-encoding genes using three real-time PCR assays. Two of these assays employed postamplification melting curve analysis with differentially labeled fluorogenic probes to detect all the known mutations associated with ESBL activity in blaTEM and blaSHV genes, respectively.

Chart reviews were conducted on laboratory-confirmed cases using standardised forms to verify illness episode information. All Hia isolates were characterised using pulsedfield gel electrophoresis (PFGE).

Monnet, X. Bertrand (Besan\u00e7on, FR; Copenhagen, DK; Vandoeuvre, FR)Objectives: Overproduction of the MexXY efflux pump results in increased resistance to aminoglycosides (AGs), fluoroquinolones (FQs) and cefepime (FEP) in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). This mechanism is very prevalent (up to 40%) in the clinical isolates. However, the conditions that favour the emergence of MexXY-overproducing mutants (PA/XY+) in the hospital setting remain unclear. We therefore analysed the temporal relationship between the prevalence of PA/XY+ and antibiotic use, and then compared the results to in vitro selection experiments. Methods: The incidence of PA/XY+ per 1000 patient-days was determined between 2001 and 2004 (3,800 isolates) from the laboratory susceptibility database (% of isolates with a low-level resistance to all the tested AGs). We conducted time-series analysis of monthly incidence of PA/XY+ and monthly consumption of various antibiotic classes in our hospital. In parallel, the ability of antibiotics at 1 or 2 MICs to select for PA/XY+ mutants was determined in vitro with reference strain PAO1. Detection of PA/XY+ was done by replicating resistant clones on MH plates containing gentamicin (5 mg/L) or FEP (5 mg/L). The PA/XY+ in vitro mutants were further characterised phenotypically and genotypically. Results: The adjusted Linear Transfer Function model showed a significant relationship between the AGs and the FQs use series and the PA/XY+ series. This was observed for contemporaneous data and with a lag of several months. Conversely a negative correlation was found between third generation cephalosporins (cefotaxime and ceftriaxone) or anti-pseudomonal penicillins use series and PA/XY+ series. There was no correlation between the FEP use, which is very low in our hospital (<0.5 DDD/100 PD), and PA/XY+ series. The model explained 70.1% of the variability of the resistance series (adjusted r-squared = 0.701). In vitro, PA/XY+ were readily selected by all the tested FQs (n = 4), AGs (n = 3) and FEP at a frequency of 3\u00d710 \u22127 to 5\u00d710 \u22126 . Conclusion: This study strongly suggests that PA/XY+ are selected by AGs and FQs in the hospital setting. The broad-spectrum resistance of these mutants could reduce the efficacy of combination therapy involving substrates of the MexXY efflux pump (i.e. FEP, AGs and FQs).",

Leclercq (Caen, Cherbourg, Lyon, FR)Objectives: S. aureus isolates inducibly resistant to erythromycin by production of ErmA or ErmC methylases are still susceptible to clindamycin. However, constitutive mutants resistant to clindamycin may be selected in vitro or in vivo in the presence of this antibiotic. The risk for selection may depend on several factors including the frequency of mutation to resistance, the bacterial inoculum size and the type of infection. Our objective was to compare the clindamycin mutation rate of clinical isolates of S. aureus containing an erm(C) or an erm(A) gene. Methods: 28 isolates of S. aureus bearing erm(C) (n = 18) or erm(A) (n = 10), originating from various countries and including 12 communityacquired methicillin resistant strains representative of different clones, were studied. For determination of mutation frequencies, cells from an overnight broth culture were plated onto trypticase-soy agar plates supplemented with 20 mg/L of clindamycin. After 48 h of incubation at 37\u00baC, colonies were counted and the mutation frequencies were determined relative to the total count of viable organisms plated. Each experiment was repeated three times. Two erythromycin-susceptible S. aureus and 4 S. aureus with the efflux gene msr(A) were included as controls. Susceptibility to oleandomycin was determined by the disk diffusion method.Results: S. aureus erm(C) displayed a 14-fold higher mean frequency of mutation to clindamycin [range: 1.7\u00d710 \u22126 to 4.4\u00d710 \u22128 ; mean: 4.7\u00d710 \u22127 (\u00b15.5\u00d710 \u22127 )] than the S. aureus erm(A) strains [range: 7.3\u00d710 \u221210 to 1.8\u00d710 \u22128 ; mean: 3.4\u00d710 \u22128 (\u00b12.4\u00d710 \u22128 )].

Material and Methods: Seventeen non-repetitive VEB-1 and/or QnrApositive isolates (mostly transconjugants) have been included in the study. They had been collected from 1999 to 2005 from patients hospitalised in different parts of the world scattered on four continents. PCR-based replicon typing (PBRT) method including eighteen primer pairs was used, allowing to recognize FIA, FIB, FIC, HI1, HI2, I1-Ig, L/M, N, P, W, T, A/C, K, B/O, X, Y, and FII replicons. Plasmid restriction analysis followed by Southern hybridisation was performed to compare their structures. Results: PBRT results showed that the thirteen blaVEB-1-positive plasmids (including eleven qnrA1-positive) were positive for the A/Ctype replicon and sequencing identified the A/C2 replicon in all cases.",

Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is a common hospitalacquired infectious agent that can cause life-threatening infections in susceptible individuals. We hypothesise AM to have important function in early stages of PA infection. Rationale: Recently, we have shown that Lyn tyrosine kinase is critically involved in alveolar epithelial cell invasion with PA through lipid raft mechanism. Lyn is known to be involved in mast cell motility and generation of superoxide free radicals in neutrophils. Thus we propose a role for Lyn in AM function during PA infection. Methods: Akt activity was detected by immunoblotting with phospho Akt (Ser 473) antibody and by in vitro kinase assay. Lyn, PI3Kinase and Akt protein interactions were analysed by co-immunoprecipitation and Lyn-GST pull down assays. Phagosome formation and localisation of signaling proteins were studied by immunostaining with fluorescent antibodies followed by confocal microscopy. Lyn-YFP and PH-Akt-GFP co-transfected MHS cells were used for studying spatio-temporal association of Lyn and Akt during PA phagocytosis by live cell confocal microscopy. Phagosomes from infected cells were isolated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation for biochemical characterisation. Results: PA-infection induced Akt activity in MHS cells depends on Lyn function. Lyn, PI3Kinase and Akt were actively recruited to phagosome fractions in PA-infected cells. Both Lyn-YFP and PH-Akt-GFP were found to colocalise in the lamellipodium and phagocytic cup of PA-infected MHS cells from live cell imaging studies. GST pull down assay confirmed Lyn-Akt interaction. Respiratory burst activity depends on Lyn function. Conclusions: Our data indicates that Lyn-PI3Kinase-Akt pathway is crucial for regulating phagocytosis and respiratory burst activity of AM.",

Prevalence data of CDAD particularly resulted from analyses performed at university hospitals, etc. In our lab we perform microbiological analyses for more than 3500 facilities comprising more than 40 hospitals in Northern Bavaria allowing examination of C. difficile prevalence in the local region.Methods: Stool samples were analysed by ELISA detecting toxins A and B of C. difficile (Cdt). The total number of ELISA performed in 2004, 2005, and 2006 and the number of positive results was determined by hybase analysis. All C. difficile positive patients identified in 2005 were documented. Analysis of toxin genes IStron types integrated into the genome (C. difficile integration profiles) was performed on C. difficile cultured from stool samples of 17 patients treated at 2 hospitals. Results: The number of Cdt positive stools samples increased from 372 in 2004 to 515 (2005) and 642 (Jan-Sept 2006). From October 2005 to January 2006 there was a marked increase from 31 to 103 Cdt positive stool samples per month. High numbers were also observed in the subsequent period until June 2006 (median 84/month). In July this number decreased to 39. When this analysis was performed on Cdt positive findings of patients from 4 harvested hospitals (I, II, III, IV) courses of each facility was very similar to that of the total collective suggesting that increase of CDAD in particular depended on community factors and secondarily on hygiene of certain hospitals.

Wang (East Geelong, AU)Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) represents the first pandemic transmissible disease of previously unknown aetiology in the 21st century. The pandemic started in November 2002 in Guangdong, China and was brought under control in July 2003, after it had spread to 33 countries on 5 continents resulting in more than 8000 infections and close to 800 deaths. The outbreak was caused by a newly emerged coronavirus, now known as the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). A closely related virus was detected in masked palm civets from a live animal market in Guangdong during the outbreaks. In late 2003 and early 2004, sporadic outbreaks were reported in the same region of China where the 2002/3 outbreaks originated. This time, civets were identified as the direct source of the virus responsible for human infections. However, a large-scale survey in China failed to find any evidence of infection of farmed or wild civets with SARS-CoV. It appears that the infection of civets was limited to animals present in the live animal markets only. The role of civets as a natural reservoir of SARS-CoV was hence never confirmed. Molecular epidemiological studies revealed that the viruses responsible for the 2003/4 outbreaks were not the same as those isolated during the 2002/3 outbreaks, indicating independent species-crossing events. These findings indicate that a SARS epidemic may recur in the future and that SARS-like coronaviruses (SARS-like-CoVs) originating from different reservoir host populations may lead to epidemics at different times and in different regions depending on the distribution of the reservoirs and transmitting hosts. This notion was supported by the later discovery of a group of diverse SARS-like-CoVs in bats. At least five different SARSlike coronaviruses have been identified in different species of horseshoe bats in the genus Rhiolophus. Sequences of four complete genomes were determined and the overall nucleotide sequence identity between bat SARS-like coronaviruses and SARS-CoV was 87\u221292%. Although the exact host species for the SARS-CoV has not been identified, the great genetic diversity of bat coronaviruses highly suggests that a different horseshoe bat or a closely related bat species is the most likely natural reservoir of the SARS-CoV responsible for the 2002-2004 outbreaks.",

Dominguez (Barcelona, ES) Objective: To determinate IFN-g response by specific T cells with QuantiFERON-TB GOLD (QFN-TB GOLD) (Cellestis, Australia) and T-SPOT.TB (Oxford Immunotec, United Kingdom) in contacts of people with sputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis. Materials and Methods: We included 91 individuals enrolled in contact tracing studies after exposure to a sputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis case. Blood samples and isolated peripheral blood isolated mononuclear cells were stimulated with M. tuberculosis-specific antigens ESAT-6 and CFP-10. We determined the IFN-g production in wholeblood supernatants samples by EIA with the QFN-TB GOLD assay and in mononuclear cells by ELISPOT with the T-SPOT.TB assay. Both IFN-g tests were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. Tuberculin skin test (TST) was administered by the Mantoux method using two tuberculin units of PPD RT23 (Statens Serum Institut, Denmark). Induration was measured after 48\u221272 h. Indurations higher than 5 mm were considered positive. Results: We included 91 individuals with a exposure higher to 6 h/day, 62 of them with BCG vaccination scar. The percentage of positive results for TST, T-SPOT.TB and QFN-TB GOLD, in non-vaccinated and vaccinated individuals were the following: 71.4% and 94.9%; 70.4% and 47.3%; and 57.7% and 40.3%, respectively. The overall concordance between T-SPOT.TB and QFN-TB GOLD was higher (k = 0.632). Between vaccinated individuals that initiate a prophylaxis treatment, T-SPOT.TB was negative in 45.7% of cases, and QFN-TB GOLD in 59.2%. Conclusions: (1) Both in vitro assays seem to have lower interference results with the BCG vaccination than TST, which suggest a higher specificity for QFN-TB GOLD and T-SPOT.TB assays. (2) Utilisation of these tests can help to reduce the number of unnecessary prophylaxes.

            "text": ": Of 83 enrolled patients, dengue genome was detected in cellular marrow of 6 cases (table). All these 6 cases were in the stage of remission of their haematologic diseases. They had had no prior history of recent febrile illnesses and HI and ELISA results of single or paired sera from these patients were compatible with either remote (#1\u22125) or remote/no (#6) infection by flaviviviruses. As for the rest, one may have had fairly recent dengue infection and one had rising titers for chikungunya virus.Conclusions:Sequential infections by different serotypes seem to be a key in severe dengue pathogenesis. Its peer flaviviruses, however, have been shown both in vitro and in vivo to do so. The persistent firstserotype dengue genome, defective or complete, could possibly confer a biological influence when co-infected with a second serotype later on in their life.Our understanding of dengue pathogenesis is far from perfect, and this finding may open up a door to a new arena of dengue research. MSP2 alleles). Multiplicity of infection (MOI) with MSP2, a high polymorphic genetic marker, was higher in Kagando than in Mbarara being 2.1 and 2.7 genotypes/PCR positive-sample, respectively. The difference in MOI in children in the two districts was statistically significant (MSP1 P < 0.0001; MSP2 P = 0.036). Clear differences in the distribution of individual alleles of FC27, IC and RO33 were apparent in the study areas. A deletion of a 12-amino acid sequence in RO33 160 bp allele yielded RO33 130 bp, which predominated in symptomatic children in Mbarara. About 13% of asymptomatic children in Kisinga, Kasese carried HbAS. MOI was age-dependent and higher in children with HbAS than with HbAA. Haemoglobin type influenced the distribution of FC27-type alleles among asymptomatic children Kagando. Conclusion: P. falciparum polymorphism is extensive in western Uganda, and most of the infections are composed of multi-clonal infections. HbAS increases MOI and is important in development of naturally acquired immunity. In vivo, MyD88 \u2212/\u2212 mice showed significant higher parasite loads and a mortality of 38% compared to 0% in controls. However, time shown to have parasitic infection with the highest prevalence reported for Trichuriasis and Giardiasis, 26% and 25.30% respectively. Amongst 34 percent of individuals who had H. nana infection Giardia Lamblia were also diagnosed as a mixed infection; 3% of individuals who had H. nana infection were diagnosed with Taenia Saginata infection too. Abdominal disorders, lack of appetite, dizziness, vomiting and diarrhoea were the main reported symptoms. The cure rate of Praziquantel against Hymenolepis nana infection was about 100% using both doses of drug. Discussion: There is a high rate of parasitic infection, some with mixed infection, in children of primary and secondary schools in Iran with higher prevalence for those living in poor parts of country like Ilam.Background: Chagas' disease is a parasitic infection caused byTrypanosoma cruzi. It is endemic in Central and South America and, during the last few years, a large number of migrants from these areas have settle in Spain. Therefore the diagnosis of Chagas'disease has become a common event in our clinical practice.Methods:We have reviewed all cases of Chagas' disease during the last 2 years. Specific serology (ELISA) was the diagnostic procedure. Epidemiological, clinical, cardiac ultrasound, serological and therapeutic aspects were analysed. DAI and the other had ventricular dysfunction and constipation. All cases but one previously treated received therapy with benznidazole for 30\u221260 days with good tolerance. A pregnant woman did not receive treatment.Conclusions:The new entry of immigrants to Spain, coming from rural endemic areas of Chagas' disease of Bolivia and other Southamerican countries should make us suspect this entity in young people with cardiac or gastro-intestinal disturbances.Conclusion:Dengue virus is not only excreted in urine in at least half of the patients, but it is also live and culturable. These findings have implications for dengue pathogenesis and for public health. Urine is implicated as a potential mode of transmission for certain viruses. Whether the arthropod-borne dengue will be added to the list is subject to further investigation.O65 Spatiotemporal variations of malaria incidence and protective efficacy of intermittent preventive antimalarial treatment of infants J.

            "text": "60% of all) were in Asia. However, TB is everywhere and there is no country in the world that has eliminated it or is near elimination. The HIV epidemic has fuelled TB incidence in many settings, especially in Africa. Multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) is particularly frequent in the former USSR and in China (up to 14% of all new cases), and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) has emerged in all continents and caused major concern in South Africa, where it has appeared among persons living with HIV/AIDS. Globally, the curve of TB incidence seems to have flattened, largely the result of the possible peaking of the epidemic in Africa. In other regions, incidence is stable or in decline, thanks to recent control efforts. Clear targets for TB control exist, as defined within the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) and by the Stop TB Partnership. To reach a stable decline in incidence (MDG 6) and to halve prevalence and mortality by 2015, several challenges must be faced. First of all, DOTS (the 5-element essential strategy promoted by WHO since 1995) needs to be fully implemented everywhere and of high quality, so that diagnosis, treatment and monitoring can be guaranteed in all settings and for all patients, and the operational targets of at least 70% case detection and 85% cure can be achieved. Second, the association of TB and HIV and the emergence of severe drug resistance require specific policies and interventions in most countries. Third, general health systems and services, especially at primary care level, must be robust enough to allow TB control and care practices to be effective; hence, national TB programmes need to engage in the broad discussion on health system strengthening and contribute to it. Fourth, it is clear that in most settings in 2007, many non-state sector practitioners or some public practitioners not linked with national programmes, are delivering sub-standard TB care. Thus, it is necessary to ensure that they are fully engaged in sound care delivery. Fifth, communities are playing an increasingly important role in contributing to their health; however, too few are adequately informed on TB and active in its care and control, thus losing an opportunity to mobilise more resources and increase political commitment at all levels. Finally, research is still badly under-funded and too slow in delivering new tools that could radically improve current practices in diagnosis, treatment and prevention. A renewed effort is necessary if new tools are to be made available quickly. To face these challenges, WHO has recently launched the new Stop TB Strategy, built around the cost-effective DOTS approach. and promote research. If fully implemented, this new Strategy will allow a proper response to the modern challenges to TB control. The Stop TB Strategy underpins the Global Plan to Stop TB 2006-2015, which defines the financial requirements and the gaps to be filled in order to reach the 2015 goals.

            "text": "Previous studies have shown that Membrane cofactor protein (MCP) CD46 is the cellular receptor of keratinocytes for S. pyogenes of the M types M6, M5 and M22. However, data using other M types and cells have cast some doubts on the role of CD46 as the main receptor for S. pyogenes in all human cells. Objective: The aim of the present study was to analyse the binding of CD46 to clinical isolates of S. pyogenes of different M types.Methods: Twenty six S. pyogenes clinical isolates from different origins and expressing different M types were included in this study. To investigate the role of the hyaluronic acid capsule, the Emm18 protein and the Enn18 protein, we used a set of mutants derived from the wild type strain 87-282 including the Emm18 protein deficient mutant 282KZ and the capsule deficient mutant TX72. Isogenic mutants TX74and TX76, derived from TX72, deficient in the Emm18 protein and the Enn18 protein, respectively, were also included in the study. Binding of human CD46 to S. pyogenes is highly heterogeneous and do not depend on the presence of hyaluronic acid capsule. Despite Emm proteins have been assumed to mediate binding of S. pyogenes to CD46, M type18 strains bind CD46 very efficiently through a cell surface protein different from the Emm and Enn proteins.Objectives: Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDC) represent the major source of type I interferons (IFN-I) in the human body. IFN-I are secreted in response to viral infection and represent early mediators of innate immune defence. Less is known about the role of IFN-I in bacterial infections. Since S. aureus has been shown to induce IFN-I we asked whether other staphylococci stimulate human pDC and addressed the molecular mechanism of staphylococcal IFN-I induction. Methods: pDC were isolated from PBMC of healthy donors by positive selection with anti-BDCA4-coated microbeads. All clinical isolates of coagulase-negative staphylococci failed to display significant stimulatory activity. -Only viable S. aureus cells stimulated significant amounts of IFN-a. Based on these results we assumed that S. aureus may stimulate pDC by secreting a S. aureus-specific substance: -Since alpha-toxin has been shown to activate immune cells we stimulated pDC with recombinant alpha-toxin or with clinical S. aureus isolates typified as alpha-toxin positive or negative by gene analysis. Alpha-toxin failed to induce IFN-a secretion and S. aureus isolates stimulated pDC independent of alpha-toxin gene expression. -Recombinant protein A (SpA) failed to promote IFN-a synthesis from pDC. Moreover, no differences between Wood 46 strain (SpA-deficient) and Cowan I strain (high producer of SpA) were observed. Induction of IFN-a by clinical S. aureus isolates was not dependent on SpA gene expression. Conclusions: Stimulation of human pDC by S. aureus is species-specific since coagulase-negative staphylococci fail to induce significant IFN-I responses. Since viability of S. aureus is required for pDC stimulation we assumed that S. aureus activates pDC via secretion of S. aureus-specific molecules. Two major pathogenic factors, SpA and alpha-toxin, failed to stimulate IFN-a synthesis. We conclude that other molecules specific for S. aureus are recognized by pDC, thus triggering IFN-I defence against pathogenic staphylococci. lower levels of mRNAs coding for alpha-toxin and its global regulator agr, which are potentially involved in lysis of eukaryotic cells. This study analysed the potential impact of these molecular changes on bacterial invasion and survival. Methods: Quantitative uptake of TeiR and TeiS strains was evaluated after 2 h of incubation at 37\u00baC with human embryonic kidney 293 cells at a 10:1 ratio, by a lysostaphin protection assay, and expressed as percentage of control strain S. aureus Cowan I uptake. Differential intracellular survival of all S. aureus strains from 2 to 24 h was evaluated by CFU counts of Triton X-100-lysed 293 cells, following lysostaphin inactivation. Results: Endocytic uptake of TeiR strain 14\u22124 was equivalent to that of Cowan I but 4-fold higher than that of TeiS strains MRGR3 and 14\u22124rev. Even more spectacular differences were recorded for the endocytic survival of strain 14\u22124, which showed an 11-fold increase in CFU counts at 24 h, as opposed to Cowan I and the TeiS strains MRGR3 and 14\u22124rev, whose intracellular CFU counts showed marginal (<2-fold) changes from 2 to 24 h. Infected 293 cells showed no evidence of lysis at 24 h, as assessed by the Trypan blue dye exclusion test. Conclusions: The increased endocytic uptake of TeiR strain 14\u22124 compared to its TeiS counterparts may be a consequence of the higher expression of FnBPs by the TeiR strain. The improved intracellular survival and proliferation of TeiR strain 14\u22124 is an interesting in vitro observation, whose cellular and molecular basis has yet to be explained and would deserve further investigations. Intracellular location might confer a significant fitness benefit to glycopeptide-intermediate isolates of MRSA, not only in experimental in vitro models but also in relevant in vivo situations.O96 Staphylococcus aureus in cystic fibrosis patients: Agr-alleles, resistance and virulence determinants V.

            "text": "Chronic activation of TLR9 in the CNS causes inflammation, ependymal loss and memory deficits.Objectives: Fibronectin, an extracellular matrix (ECM) protein, is discussed to be a potent stimulator of the innate immune system through Toll-like-receptor 4. Toll-like receptors (TLR) play a key role in the recognition of products from virtually all classes of pathogenic organisms. In central nervous system (CNS) infections several ECM proteins and bacterial compounds are elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). For this reason, we hypothetised that endogenous and pathogenderived molecules may jointly stimulate the innate immune system and increase the neuronal damage in bacterial meningitis.Results: Fibronectin was elevated in the CSF of patients suffering from bacterial meningitis and with an elevated CSF protein due to other causes, but not in patients with multiple sclerosis and in healthy S21 control patients. Co-administration of fibronectin in a concentration which occurs in bacterial meningitis [10 mg/mL] with CpG, LPS or Pam3Cys to primary cultured microglial cells led to an additive release of NO and TNF-a. Conclusion: The inflammatory reaction to the TLR agonists CpG, LPS and Pam3Cys in primary cultured microglial cells is enhanced by fibronectin in concentrations occurring in CSF during CNS infections. Exogenous-endogenous Co-activation leads to stronger microglial stimulation and may be in part responsible for neuronal damage occurring in these diseases. In standard adherence and invasion assays we evaluated the capacity of scpB-lmb and lmb mutants of S. agalactiae to adhere to and invade into HBMEC and performed inhibition studies using wildtype S. agalactiae in combination with recombinant Lmb or polyclonal Lmb-antibodies. Furthermore interleukin (IL)-8 release was detected by ELISA. Results: Deletion of the scpB-lmb region, coding for the C5a peptidase and Lmb, respectively, resulted in a decreased invasion of S. agalactiae into HBMEC. Decreased invasion was also seen in lmb mutant strains. Finally, host cell invasion was significantly blocked in competition experiments with either purified recombinant Lmb or a polyclonal antibody directed against the Lmb of S. agalactiae. The S. agalactiae scpB-lmb mutant induced an equal amount of the neutrophil chemoattractant IL-8 release in comparison to the wild-type. Conclusion: Taken together, our studies support the conclusion that Lmb promotes invasion of S. agalactiae into HBMEC but does not play a role in IL-8 release from HBMEC. It might be hypothesised that the beneficial effect of GL in SS is seen for patients with low expression of the TNF gene.Objectives: Staphylococcal and streptococcal toxic-shock syndrome (TSS) are severe illnesses associated with the production of superantigenic toxins, which activate specific fractions of the T-cell population by linking the Vbeta domain of the T-cell receptor. Each superantigenic toxin is associated with a characteristic Vbeta \"signature\" in vitro. We postulate that an early analysis of the Vbeta repertoire of T cells in vivo during TSS may facilitate the diagnosis and the introduction of antitoxinic agents.Methods: We have prospectively included in 2005 and 2006 patients with streptococcal or staphylococcal TSS according to case definition. The Vbeta repertoire of T cells (24 Vbeta segments) was analysed by flow cytometry with fresh PBMC obtained in the first 48 hours of admission. The presence of each superantigenic toxin gene in S. aureus and S. pyogenes isolates were detected by PCR. Results: Four patients with staphylococcal (three menstrual and one non-menstrual) and two patients with streptococcal TSS (one postpartal and another associated with S. pyogenes bloodstream infection) were included in the study.In cases of menstrual S. aureus TSS, a Vbeta 2 expansion corresponding to the signature of TSST-1, was detected at admission. Corresponding isolates were positive for the gene encoding TSST-1. A Vbeta amplification corresponding to the signature of SEB was detected in the patient with staphylococcal non-menstrual TSS. The corresponding isolate was positive for the gene encoding SEB but also genes encoding SEA and SED. All patients received clindamycin, when cultures detected S. aureus (none received linezolid as all isolates were susceptible to methicillin), and the latter received intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIg). In cases of S. pyogenes TSS, a Vbeta signature of SPEB was detected in the patient with the postpartal TSS. No Vbeta signature was detected in the other patient who developped severe disseminated intravascular coagulation requiring limb amputations. The two corresponding isolates were positive for the gene encoding SPEB. All patients with streptococcal TSS received clindamycin and IVIg when cultures detected S. pyogenes. Conclusion: The analysis of the Vbeta repertoire in patients with staphylococcal and streptococcal TSS may be a useful tool for the early diagnosis, apart in the case of associated severe bloodstream infection. Such analysis may facilitate the early introduction of anti-toxinic agents such as clindamycin, linezolid or IVIg.",

Recent trends indicate a decreasing incidence throughout the Mediterranean countries, whereas important new foci have been disclosed in China/Tibet, and re-emergence is obvious in countries of the former Soviet Union. For Central Europe it is believed that CE is an imported disease. However, autochthonous infections are being observed, and underline the fact that transmission is still possible. Based on molecular markers the species of E. granulosus was recently further subdivided according to its main intermediate host in E. granulosus, E. ortleppi, E. equinus, E. intermedius. In contrast to AE, the larva forms a single or several fluid-filled cyst(s), and induces a well-organised, compact capsule of host origin. Serological diagnosis of the disease in humans is still unsatisfactory, since young and unruptured cysts remain serologically negative.

Moxifloxacin (MXF) has recently been approved for this indication. In this study, the therapeutic efficacy of MXF or levofloxacin (LFX) against a clinical isolate of S. pyogenes (6A47 wild-type) was investigated. We studied both quinolones in a murine sepsis model and in two cSSSI models: the granuloma pouch and the Gelfoam \u00ae implant model. Methods: Sepsis model: bacteria were suspended in 5% mucin in saline and inoculated intraperitoneally. Antibiotics were given intravenously (i.v.) at 1, 4, 24 and 32 h post-infection (p.i.; 5 animals/group). Survival was monitored for 5 days. Granuloma pouch model: pouches were formed by injecting 5 mL of air and 0.5 mL of 0.1% croton oil in olive oil under the skin of the back. After 72 h, the air was replaced by 1 mL of 0.25% agar in saline. A bacterial suspension (0.5 mL) was injected into the pouch after 48 h. Antibiotics were given i.v. at 0.5, 4, 24 and 32 h p.i. (7 animals/group), and viable counts in exudates were assessed at 48 h. Gelfoam \u00ae model: a collagen piece was implanted under the skin of the back. After 3 days, 50 mL of bacterial suspension was injected into the implant. Antibiotics were given i.v. for 3 days (b.i.d.), starting 2 h p.i.

Sheehan (Cleveland, New York City, US)Objectives: Catheter-related biofilm infections (CRBI) are a major cause of bloodstream infections in the USA. One of the most common causes of CRBI related bloodstream infection is methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Catheter removal has become an integral part of the therapeutic approach to CRBI, however, it is associated with increased medical costs, potential morbidity, and is not always feasible in critically ill patients. Antibiotic lock therapy provides the means for local delivery of high drug concentrations to overcome resistance due to bacterial biofilms that coat the catheter surface. In this in vivo study, we compared the effectiveness of linezolid (LIN) versus vancomycin (VAN) antibiotic lock therapy against MRSA CRBI. Methods: In New Zealand White rabbits, silicone catheters were tunneled subcutaneously and surgically placed in their jugular vein. The catheter lumen was infected by locking 1\u00d710 7 MRSA in the lumen for 24 h. To maintain catheter patency, heparin flushes were performed daily. Rabbits were randomised into three groups: untreated control, VAN 2 mg, and LIN 2 mg. Each drug was locked in the catheter lumen for 8 h a day for 7 days. After treatment, the animals were anaesthetised and peripheral blood cultures were taken from the catheter. Animals were sacrificed, catheter removed and divided into two pieces; one piece for quantitative culture and the other for scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Results: Biofilms were confirmed by blood culture showing MRSA growth from the catheter 3 days post-infection. Catheters removed from untreated controls yielded a higher fungal burden than LIN and VANtreated groups (2.59\u00b10.76, 0.20\u00b10.08, and 0.18\u00b10.68, respectively). No significant difference was observed between LIN and VAN treatment groups, (P value 0.8764). SEM of untreated control catheters revealed patchy, abundant biofilms while both LIN and VAN treated catheters had almost completely cleared surfaces. VAN-treated catheters had small patches of bacteria with damaged biofilm matrix, while LIN-treated catheters had scattered patches of bacteria with little or no surrounding matrix. Conclusion: Antibiotic lock therapy with LIN may be a useful treatment strategy against MRSA in CRBI's. A prospective, randomised clinical trial evaluating LIN for the treatment of MRSA caused CRBI is warranted.",

Ramirez (Lisbon, PT)Objectives: Recently, we demonstrated that the prophage-like elements belonging to the Tn1207.3/Phi10394.4 family in Streptococcus pyogenes encode a DNA-modifying methyltransferase. In this study, the presence of the Tn1207.3/Phi10394.4 family was evaluated in group G streptococci (GGS) presenting the M phenotype. Methods: Five GGS clinical isolates identified as Streptococcus dysgalactiae ssp. equisimilis and expressing the M phenotype of macrolide resistance were collected from 2002 to 2005 in Portugal. The presence of the mef gene as well as it linkage with the msr(D) gene, both involved in macrolide resistance, were investigated by PCR. The isolates were also characterised by PFGE. To identify the general structure of the mef genetic elements, the presence of phage-related ORFs belonging to the Tn1207.3/Phi10394.4 family was investigated by PCR, including the one encoding M.Spy10394I. Moreover, to discriminate between these two genetic elements, the structure of the left insertion site in the bacterial chromosome and a Phi10394.4-specific ORF, annotated as encoding an R28-like protein were investigated.Results:The analysis of SmaI PFGE patterns showed that three of the isolates were clonally related while one was not typable by PFGE, since its DNA was resistant to SmaI digestion. All isolates showed the presence and linkage of mef and msr(D) genes and four carried the mef(E) variant while only one carried the mef(A) variant. Only the isolate, refractory to SmaI digestion and positive for the mef(A) variant, was also positive for all PCR reactions performed. The structure of the left insertion site of the Tn1207.3/Phi10394.4 family in the chromosome of this isolate revealed that in this streptococcal species the elements are inserted at the same locus as in S. pyogenes. Moreover, the absence of a PCR product for the ORF encoding the R28-like protein established Tn1207.3 as the element present in this strain.Conclusion: The data demonstrated the presence of an element of the Tn1207.3/Phi10394.4 family in a GGS isolate. Resistance to SmaI digestion in this M phenotype isolate is probably due to the expression of the M.Spy10394I methylase, previously described in S. pyogenes. The dissemination of the Tn1207.3/Phi10394.4 family among S. pyogenes and GGS emphasize the important role of these related chimeric elements and their associated prophage in the worldwide emergence of macrolide resistant streptococci expressing the M phenotype.O207 Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants, QnrA, QnrB, and QnrS, among clinical isolates of Enterobacter cloacae in a Taiwanese hospital J. Yan, J. Wu, W. Ko, S. Tsai (Tainan, TW) Objectives: A total of 526 nonreplicate clinical isolates of Enterobacter cloacae collected in 2004 at a Taiwanese university hospital were analysed to: (i) determine the prevalence of three plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance determinants, QnrA, QnrB, and QnrS, and (ii) investigate the association of the Qnr determinants and the IMP-8 metallo-b-lactamase. Methods: The qnrA-, qnrB-, and qnrS-like genes were detected by colony hybridisation and PCR-based experiments. Beta-lactamase contents of qnr-positive were determined by isoelectric focusing and PCR. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was used for strain typing. Restriction analysis of qnr-positive plasmids and blaIMP-8-positive plasmids were performed after conjugation experiments. Results: Eighty-six (16.3%) of all isolates were qnr-positive, and the qnrA1-like, qnrB2-like, and qnrS1-like genes were detected alone or in combination in 3 (0.6%), 53 (10.1%), and 34 (6.5%) isolates, respectively. Among 149 putative extended-spectrum b-lactamaseproducing isolates, 59 (39.6%) isolates, all of which were SHV-12 producers, harboured qnrA (0.7%, 1 isolate), qnrB (28.9%, 43 isolates), or qnrS (12.1%, 18 isolates). Forty-four (78.6%) of 56 IMP-8 producers carried qnrB (58.9%, 33 isolates), qnrS (25.0%, 14 isolates), or both. Conjugation experiments revealed coexistence of qnrB and blaIMP-8 on the transferred plasmids and the absence of b-lactamase content on the transferred qnrS-positive plasmids. The transferred blaIMP-8-positive plasmids with and without qnrB had very similar restriction patterns. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis showed 6 major patterns among the 44 qnr-positive IMP-8-producing isolates.Conclusion: This study demonstrated the high prevalence of qnr among E. cloacae isolates at a Taiwanese hospital. The extreme high prevalence of qnr among metallo-b-lactamase-producing E. cloacae isolates may be mainly due to intra-hospital spread of several clones and dissemination of plasmids containing both qnrB and blaIMP-8.O208 Biological fitness of fluoroquinolone-resistant invasive clinical isolates ofStreptococcus pneumoniae C.B. Duesberg, T.T. Nguyen, T. Welte, M.W. Pletz (Hannover, DE) Background: Resistance to fluoroquinolones in pneumococci is emerging globally. Biological fitness of resistant strains in absence of selective pressure is an important parameter determining the spread and persistence of resistance. In vitro studies using isogenic isolates have shown that most of the mutations in the quinolone resistance determining regions are associated with a fitness cost. In this study resistant clinical isolates (LFX 8 mg/L) were used to take into account potential compensatory mutations. Methods: Invasive isolates related to international multiresistant clones defined by the Pneumococcal Molecular Epidemiology Network (PMEN) were analysed (Antimicrob Agents Chemother 2004; 48: 3491\u22127). Because isogenic susceptible ancestors of resistant clinical strains can not be obtained, the isolates studied were compared with their respective fluoroquinolone-susceptible PMEN reference clone. Growth curves were determined in three independent experiments with three replicates each by measuring optical density at 600 nm. Relative fitness was assessed comparing the slope of the curve of each isolate with its respective reference clone by Mann-Whitney U test. For the majority of isolates no significant fitness cost was found when compared to their respective reference clone. In three clusters (Spain 9V-3, England 14\u22129, Greece 6B-22) individual isolates with a fitness gain could be identified. Only in the Spain 23F-1 cluster, 3 of 8 isolates exhibited a fitness cost which was associated with a serotype switching from 23F to 19F. Conclusion: We found notably few resistant clinical isolates with a fitness cost. Therefore even in the absence of selective pressure (fluoroquinolone usage), fluoroquinolone-resistant strains may not be replaced completely by susceptible strains.

Spores of CD may survive in the environment for long periods and are resistant to alcohol. More than 150 PCR ribotypes and 24 toxinotypes have been recognized; epidemic ribotypes may have enhanced sporulation. The spectrum of C. difficile-associated disease ranges from asymptomatic carriage to fulminant, relapsing and potentially fatal colitis. Since 2003, increasing rates of CDAD have been reported in North America and Europe involving a more severe course, higher mortality, increased risk of relapse and more complications. The outbreaks are difficult to control and require a multifaceted approach. The most important infection control measures act on interruption of transmission of spores to vulnerable patients from infected patients and from the environment. Vulnerable patients are mainly patients who receive antimicrobial treatment, and therefore fewer antibiotic prescriptions should lead to less vulnerable patients. At present, no sufficient evidence exists to propagate the use of probiotics to vulnerable patients for prevention of CDAD. Transmission of spores occurs mainly via contact of contaminated healthcare workers to patients, directly by patient-to-patient transmission or by transmission from the contaminated environment to patients. There is no evidence that patients or healthcare workers who are symptom-free but colonised with C. difficile in the intestinal tract are significant sources of infection. Airborne transmission of infection is unlikely to occur based on recent reviews of the literature.",

Part of the Belgian data allowed investigation of the temporal changes in spatial distribution of E. multilocularis, revealing spreading into northwestern direction.

Medical records were reviewed; pertinent demographic, bacteriologic and clinical data were collected and the presumptive focus of infection was determined. Persistent bacteraemia was defined as positive blood cultures 48 hrs. Variables evaluated included: age, gender, functional capacity, healthcare-associated acquisition, co-morbid conditions, McCabe and Charlson scores, presence of prosthetic devices, intravascular and urinary catheters, mechanical ventilation, recent surgery or invasive procedures, steroid or cytotoxic therapy, neutropenia, source of infection, susceptibility to methicillin and the clinical status and laboratory findings at the time of the first positive blood culture. Results: We included 334 patients with SA bacteraemia. Statistically significant risk factors for persistent bacteraemia included a recurrent episode of SA bacteraemia, the presence of a pacemaker or a prosthetic joint, and endovascular, joint or bone infections as sources of infection (table). The difference for prosthetic valves was not significant (12.1% with vs. 9.9% without persistent bacteraemia, p = 0.56) and no IVDUs were included in our cohort. Persistent bacteraemia was present among 48/197 (24.4%), 30/73 (41.1%) and 7/10 (70%) of patients who received appropriate antibiotic treatment, when appropriate treatment was started on days 0, 3 and 7, respectively. Echocardiography was performed for 70 (28.8%) patients without vs. 54 (59.3%) patients with persistent bacteraemia. Invasive procedures or interventions were performed more frequently with persistent bacteraemia (43/243, 17.7%, vs. 28/91, 30.8%, p = 0.009). No significant differences were noted with regard to complications at follow-up, including septic shock, mechanical ventilation, renal failure and days in ICU. Fever duration was longer with persistent bacteraemia (5.5 vs. 3.1 days, p < 0.001). All-cause 30-day mortality among patients alive at 48 h was 82/215 (38.1%) vs. 27/87 (31%), p = 0.24. Conclusions: Identification of risk factors for persistent bacteraemia can support the performance of repeat blood cultures and direction of appropriate antibiotic treatment. With adequate management of foreign bodies, persistent bacteraemia may not portend a poorer prognosis. O418 Clinical and microbiological features of 55 cases of staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome in France T. Perpoint, E. Descloux, T. Ferry, G. Lina, M. Bes, F. Vandenesch, J. Etienne (Lyon, FR) Objectives: To describe and compare the clinical presentation, the management, the outcome and microbiological features of menstrual and non-menstrual staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome (STSS). Methods: We have prospectively collected cases of suspected STSS in France from December 2003 to June 2006. STSS was defined by the CDC diagnostic criteria and cases were divided in confirmed or probable TSS. The superantigenic toxin gene content were determinated by PCR for the corresponding isolates. Results: Among 100 patients suspected to have staphylococcal STSS in the study period, 55 fulfilled the case definition of confirmed (20 cases) or probable STSS (35 cases), and 21 women (38%) presented with menstrual STSS versus 34 patients with non-menstrual STSS (62%). Non-menstrual STSS occurred in post-operative period in 7/34 cases (21%). Blood cultures were positive with S. aureus in 17 cases of non-menstrual STSS (50%) and never in those of MTSS (p < 0.001). The tst gene encoding TSST-1 was detected in all but one menstrual STSS cases (20/21, 95%). At least one gene encoding a superantigenic toxin was positive for all isolates responsible for non-menstrual STSS. Most of patients with non-menstrual STSS have primary focal infections, mainly localised on skin or mucous membranes (22/34 cases, 65%)",

Meyer (Copenhagen, Roskilde, DK)Objectives: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the quality of the initial diagnostics and to identify clinical factors correlating to an unfavourable outcome. Hypothetically, sequelae and mortality could correlate to age, presence of risk factors, bacterial aetiology, and the time from the arrival to the hospital to the administration of relevant antibiotics (time-arrival-ab). The time-arrival-ab was thought to correlate with the quality of the initial diagnostics. Methods: All culture positive CSF in Denmark from 2002 and 2003 were identified by the regional departments of clinical microbiology. Clinical data was collected retrospectively from medical charts from all bacterial meningitis (BM) patients in East Denmark. Unfavourable outcome was identified as death or invalidating sequelae (e.g. total deafness). Positive outcome was identified as none, reversible or milder lasting means (e.g. deafness on one ear). Results: 187 patients were included. 20% of patients admitted with the tentative diagnosis BM and 27% of patients with a typical clinical presentation got antibiotics later than 2 hours. The mortality was 12% for patients receiving relevant antibiotics within 2 hours compared to 40% when antibiotics were administered later than 2 hours (P = 0.00001). The general mortality was 23%. Age >50, presence of 1 or more risk factors, and non-meningococcal disease were also correlated with a unfavourable outcome (p < 0.001). 58% had a time-arrival-ab <2 hours. 73% of patients with a classical clinical presentation were treated within 2 hours compared to 29% with less typical presentation (P < 0.001). Age was not correlated to classical clinical presentation. By multivariate analysis age >50, late administration of antibiotics, nonmeningococcal disease, and presence of risk factors were independently correlated with unfavourable outcome: Age >50 (OR 3.9, P = 0.003), non-meningococcal disease (OR 3.9, P = 0.046), presence of 1 or more risk factors (OR 2.4, P = 0.018), time-arrival-ab >2 hours (OR 1.6, P = 0.007). Conclusion: A general correlation between time-arrival-ab and the severity of outcome was found. Age, non-meningococcal disease, presence of risk factors and time-arrival-ab >2 hours were independently correlated with unfavourable outcome in the multivariate analysis. The results may indicate that the outcome could improve further by optimal initial management of the BM patient.O420 Penetration of telavancin into pulmonary epithelial lining fluid and alveolar macrophages S. Wong, J. Shaw, M. Gotfried, S. Barriere, M. Kitt, M. Goldberg (South San Francisco, Phoenix, US)Objectives: Telavancin (TLV), a novel, rapidly bactericidal lipoglycopeptide with a multifunctional mechanism of action against methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus and other Gram-positive pathogens, is undergoing Phase 3 trials for hospital-acquired pneumonia. This study evaluated the level of TLV in plasma, and its penetration into pulmonary epithelial lining fluid (ELF) and alveolar macrophages (AM) after IV administration to healthy subjects. Methods: Three daily doses were administered as 60-min TLV 10 mg/kg IV infusions to healthy subjects (n = 20; mean\u00b1SD age, 30\u00b16 years). TLV was assayed (using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry) in blood taken preinfusion on Days 1 and 3, and at 0,1, 3, 5, 7, 11 and 23 h after the Day 3 infusion, and in bronchoscopy samples obtained on Day 3 at 4, 8, 12 or 24 h after infusion initiation. Predictive modelling software simulated the pharmacokinetic disposition of TLV in different compartments. Results: The pharmacokinetic model included plasma and peripheral compartments. Pulmonary ELF and AM appeared to be deeper extensions of the peripheral compartment. A chain of catenary compartments was incorporated to account for the delay in peak AM concentration. 6%) mL/h/kg for CL21, CL23, CL24, CL32 and CL42, respectively. Mean (CV) rate constants, k0 and k12, were 0.213 (5.6%) and 0.839 (17.4%) per h, respectively, and the mean (CV) volume of the central compartment was 62.2 (5.7%) mL/kg. The model predicted rapid equilibrium with plasma, slow transfer (CL23) to ELF and even slower transfer (delay + CL24) to AM. The maximum TLV concentration (Cmax) in ELF was~3.7 mg/mL, which occurred 8 h post dose (Tmax) due to a very low clearance-in from the peripheral compartment. The TLV concentration profile of ELF was relatively flat, mainly because of the high clearance-out to the peripheral compartment. Cmax in AM (~50 mg/mL) occurred approximately 16 h after dosing. These simulations showed that TLV in ELF and AM have very different time-concentration profiles from those observed in plasma, where Tmax occurred 1 h after dosing and Cmax was 116 mg/mL. Conclusion: Compartmental modelling results support the hypothesis that AM containing TLV originate in the circulation and that TLV penetrates deeply into non-infected pulmonary tissue. Objectives: Inappropriate empiric antibiotic therapy for secondary peritonitis (SP) promotes poor patient outcomes. The emergence of resistance in target organisms contributes to this issue. Tigecycline (TG) is a novel compound with activity against vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA); it is newly indicated for intra-abdominal infections, and was equivalent to imipenem (IMP) in clinical trials. We predicted microbiological success against aerobic species causing SP by evaluating TG and 6 antimicrobials from classes recommended for SP by the Infectious Disease Society of America. Methods: Cumulative fraction of response (CFR) via a 5000subject Monte Carlo simulation was predicted for cefepime (FEP), ceftazidime (CAZ), ceftriaxone (CRO), IMP, levofloxacin (LVX), piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP) and TG using a pharmacodynamic analysis incorporating pharmacokinetic variability in patients and global minimum inhibitory concentration data. Excluding anaerobic bacteria, isolates collected in the 2004-2005 SENTRY and TEST Programmes were analysed by individual species then weighted by prevalence in SP, both with and without Enterococcus. A predicted CFR of 90% was considered desirable. Results: Agents with predicted CFRs 90% when modeled against all species excluding Enterococcus were (dose, %CFR): FEP (1 g & 2 g q12h, 92 & 95); CAZ (2 g q8h, 94); IMP (500 mg q6h, 97); and TZP (3.375 g q6h, 91). TG displayed %CFR of 85 at the indicated dose of 50 mg q12h. CRO at 1 g and 2 g q24h had %CFRs of 76 and 78; LVX 750 mg q24h showed %CFR of 76. When Enterococcus was included in the analysis, IMP, TZP and TG showed %CFRs of 93, 88 and 87, respectively. Against individual species, TG had the highest %CFR vs. Enterococcus, at 100. Against Escherichia coli, the most prevalent aerobic species causing SP, all agents had 90%CFR except LVX (%CFR of 75). Conclusions: Decisions regarding empiric therapy for SP should consider local epidemiology, as success is strongly influenced by species prevalence and susceptibility. Based on this analysis, resistance contributed to poor attainment of target exposures for CRO and LVX.When Enterococcus is not included, FEP 1 g or 2 g q12h or CAZ 2 g q8h given as combination therapy with an agent to cover anaerobes would be viable choices, as would monotherapy with IMP 500 mg q6h or TZP 3.375 g q6h. When Enterococcus is included in the epidemiologic mix, IMP, TZP and TG all appear to be viable monotherapeutic choices.O422 Concentration-dependent selection of resistant mutants of Enterococcus faecium exposed to linezolid in an in vitro dynamic modelD. Gilbert, I. Lubenko, A. Firsov, S. Zinner (Providence, US; Moscow, RU; Cambridge, US) Objective: Enterococcal resistance to linezolid (LZD) has been reported from a few clinical studies. Without pharmacokinetic data, these observations cannot be related to LZD concentrations with respect to placement in or out of the mutant selection window (MSW), i.e., the concentration range from the MIC to the mutant prevention concentration (MPC). To test the MSW hypothesis, E. faecium was exposed to LZD at concentrations that fell into the MSW for varying portions of the dosing interval (TMSWs). Methods: A clinical isolate of E. faecium 392 (MIC 1.8 mg/L, MPC 7 mg/L) at a starting inoculum of 8 log CFU/mL was exposed to b.i.d. LZD for three consecutive days in a hollow-fiber two-compartment model. The simulated ratios of 24-hour area under the curve (AUC) to MIC were designed to provide TMSWs from 0 to 100 per cent of the dosing interval. Peripheral compartments of the dynamic model were sampled during and after treatment to determine bacterial counts and LZD concentrations (bioassay). Changes in E. faecium susceptibility and bacterial growth on agar plates containing 2\u00d7, 4\u00d7, 8\u00d7 and 16\u00d7MIC of LZD were examined daily. Results: The AUC/MICs were estimated at 33, 53 and 114 h, the respective steady-state peak concentration-to-MIC ratios were 4.7, 7.5 and 15.8 and TMSWs were 88%, 55% and 0%. At the two lower AUC/MIC ratios, E. faecium resistant to 2\u221216\u00d7MIC and 2\u22128\u00d7MIC of LZD, respectively, were selectively enriched with a concomitant slight loss in susceptibility. Neither growth on LZD-containing media nor changes in susceptibility occurred at the high AUC/MIC ratio that is comparable to the clinically attainable AUC/MIC for this strain (186/1.8 = 100 h). Conclusions: This study suggests that (1) selection of mutants of E. faecium resistant to LZD depends on drug concentration;(2) both bacterial growth on LZD-containing plates and loss in susceptibility of E. faecium occur at AUC/MICs similar to those reported in earlier in vitro studies with fluoroquinolone-exposed staphylococci and pneumococci; (3) the MSW concept may be used to predict the anti-mutant concentrations of LZD.O423 Pharmacodynamics of gentamicin againstPseudomonas aeruginosa: modelling bacterial response to drug-selective pressures V.H. Tam, G. Vo, S. Kabbara, M. Nikolaou (Houston, US) Objective: We have previously developed a mathematical model predicting the response of P. aeruginosa (PA) to various fluctuating pharmacokinetic profiles of meropenem (Tam, ICAAC 05). However, the applicability of the model to other drug-pathogen combinations is unknown. We extended our model to predict PA response to fluctuating gentamicin exposures. Methods: Time-kill studies with 10 7 cfu/mL of PA ATCC 27853 at baseline were performed. Gentamicin at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16\u00d7MIC was used for 24 h (MIC = 2 ug/mL). The experimental data were used to derive the best-fit estimates of the model parameters, and PA response to various gentamicin exposures over 72 h was predicted via computer simulation. Three parallel differential equations were used, each characterising the rate of change of drug concentration, overall susceptibility and microbial burden of the surviving bacterial population over time, respectively. Various gentamicin profiles (t 1/ 2 = 3 h) were investigated, corresponding to Cmax/MIC (dosing frequency) of 4 (q8), 12 (q24), 36 (q24) and 30 (q12). The computer simulations were subsequently validated using an in-vitro hollow fiber infection model (HFIM) with similar gentamicin exposures. Samples were obtained at baseline, 4, 8, 24, 48 and 72 hours to determine the bacterial burden. Results: Time-kill studies data were satisfactorily captured by the model (r 2 = 0.96). A significant initial reduction in bacterial burden was predicted for all gentamicin exposures examined. However, regrowth over time due to resistance emergence was predicted for regimens with Cmax/MIC (dosing frequency) of 4 (q8), 12 (q24), and 36 (q24). Sustained suppression of bacterial population over 72 h was predicted with Cmax/MIC of 30 (q12). These predictions correlated well with our experimental data in HFIM.Conclusions:The model was reasonable in predicting extended PA response to various fluctuating gentamicin exposures qualitatively, based on limited input data from time-kill studies. In view of its robustness and efficiency, our mathematical modeling and simulation approach holds great promise as a high-throughput screening tool for dosing regimen selection in antimicrobial (pre)-clinical development.O424 PK/PD modelling of linezolid against MRSAObjective: In vitro PK/PD models, based on time-kill curve data, have become a powerful tool to predict the in vivo situation. To date, several physiology-based or semi-mechanistic modeling approaches have been undertaken to develop suitable PK/PD models that fit in vitro data sufficiently well. Widely used simple sigmoid Emax-models meet these criteria only partly. A further approach was undertaken to address the weak points of currently used models and applied to model the effects of linezolid against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Methods: Constant concentration time-kill curves were performed in triplicates in Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB, DIFCO) using linezolid concentrations, ranging from 0.25MIC to 16MIC. The change in number of viable bacteria (CFU/mL) versus time was linked to the antimicrobial effect of linezolid. MRSA OC 2878 was employed as the test organism. Samples were taken at 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 hours. A modified sigmoid Emax-model was fitted simultaneously to the data using the software Scientist \u00ae 3.0 for Windows TM .",

Zinner (Moscow, RU; Cambridge, US)Objective: The anti-staphylococcal pharmacodynamics and killing kinetics of telavancin (TLV) and vancomycin (VAN) against methicillinresistant S. aureus ATCC 43300 were studied in five-day treatment courses over a wide range of ratios of the 24-h area under the curve (AUC) to MIC. Methods: MICs of TLV and VAN for S. aureus ATCC 43300 were 0.25 and 0.8 mg/L, respectively. The respective mutant prevention concentrations (MPCs) were 5 and 18 mg/L. An 18-hour culture of S. aureus ATCC 43300 at a starting inoculum of 8 log CFU/mL was exposed to mono-exponential concentration decays of TLV (once-daily dosing, half-life of 8 h) and VAN (twice-daily dosing, half-life of 6 h). With each antibiotic, peak concentrations were designed to be equal to the MIC, above the MIC but below the MPC, i.e., within the mutant selection window (MSW), and above the MPC. The respective steadystate AUC/MICs of TLV varied from 50 to 1200 h and those of VAN varied from 30 to 1200 h. To determine the antimicrobial effect, the area between the level corresponding to the starting inoculum and the timekill curve (ABBC) was calculated from time zero to 144 h. To detect possible changes in susceptibility to TLV or VAN, bacterial growth on agar plates containing 2\u00d7MIC and 4\u00d7MIC of antibiotic was recorded and the MICs were tested every 24 h. Results: With both TLV and VAN, anti-staphylococcal effects depended on the AUC/MIC ratio: the higher the AUC/MIC, the greater the killing and delay of bacterial regrowth. Linear relationships of ABBC to log AUC/MIC were established with each antibiotic. Based on these relationships, the anti-staphylococcal effect of the proposed therapeutic dose of TLV (10 mg/kg; AUC/MIC 3400 h) is 25% greater than that of two 1-g doses of VAN given at a 12-h interval (AUC/MIC 500 h). Regardless of whether TLV and VAN concentrations were in or out of the MSW, no bacterial growth occurred on antibiotic-containing plates and no change in susceptibility was observed. Conclusion: These findings suggest greater anti-staphylococcal efficacy of TLV relative to VAN at their clinically achievable AUC/MICs.O426 In vivo pharmacokinetics and intracellular accumulation of five antistaphylococcal agents in a murine model of peritonitis J.H.R.

            "text": "Denamur, F. Van Bambeke, M.-P. Mingeot-Leclercq, P. Tulkens (Brussels, BE) Objectives: Apoptosis is now recognized as an early, and probably critical determinant in gentamicin (GEN)-induced nephrotoxicity in animals (Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2000; 44: 665\u221275) as well as in renal cultured cells (Toxicol Sci. 2000; 56: 229\u221239). Models using electroporated cells also show that direct delivery of GEN in the cytosol of cultured renal cells enhances at least 30-fold its capacity to induce apoptosis (Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2006; 50: 1213\u221221). Our aims were (i) to examine whether the capacity of GEN to induce apoptosis is restricted to renal cells; (ii) to compare amikacin (AMK) to GEN in this context, since AMK is generally considered to be less nephrotoxic than GEN (Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 1999; 43: 1003\u221212).Methods:We used non-confluent murine J774 macrophages and porcine LLC-PK1 renal cells grown to 80% of confluency. Electroporation was performed on trypsinised LLC-PK1 cells (8 square wave pulses; 800 v/cm; 1 ms) as previously described (Antimicrob Agents Chemother. 2006;50:1213\u221221). Cell viability was checked by measurement of LDH release (only cultures with <10% release were used for evaluation). Apoptotic cells were enumerated after DAPI staining by observers unaware of the experimental conditions, and expressed as percentage of all visible cells. Results: The Table shows the extent of apoptosis observed in controls (no aminoglycoside), in cells exposed to GEN concentrations known from previous studies to induce marked apoptosis or to AMK equimolar concentrations. For GEN, apoptosis developed on a concentrationdependent manner from an extracellular concentration of 1 mM for incubated cells and from 32 mM for electroporated cells. For AMK, no significant increase of apoptosis was seen at concentrations tested. a 24 h incubation; b 48 h incubation; c 24 h incubation in drug-free medium after electroporation in the presence of the drug.Conclusions: Apoptosis develops in both renal and non-renal cells upon incubation with GEN. The lack of apoptosis observed with AMK with both incubated (renal and non-renal) and electroporated (renal) cells support the concept that this aminoglycoside is intrinsically less toxic than GEN.O429 Inhibitors and activator of the P-glycoprotein (P gp) efflux pump modulate the accumulation of daptomycin (DAP) in THP-1 macrophages and its intracellular activity towardsStaphylococcus aureus S. Lemaire, F. Van Bambeke, P. Tulkens (Brussels, BE) Objectives: The concentration of antibiotics in eukaryotic cells can be reduced by efflux pumps such as P-gp, which may impair their activity against intracellular bacteria (JAC 2003; 51: 1167-1173). DAP is a lipopeptide antibiotic with an amphiphilic character (calculated logD at pH 7 and 25\u00baC: 9.56). Since amphiphilicity is an important determinant for recognition and transport by P-gp, we have examined whether the activity of this transporter in macrophages could affect the handling and intracellular activity of DAP. Methods: Uninfected THP-1 macrophages were exposed to DAP (24 h) or to the fluorochrome dimethyloxadicarbocyanine iodide (DIOC2; a specific P-gp subtrate; 5 h) and their cell contents measured by fluorimetry (see JID 2005; 191: 2149-2152 for assay method of daptomycin). Intracellular activity of DAP was measured against phagocytised S. aureus (ATCC 25923; MIC in Ca 2+ supplemented MH broth: 0.125 mg/L) after a 24 h exposure to an extracellular concentration of DAP yielding an apparent static effect for intracellular bacteria (1 mg/L; see AAC 2006; 50: 841-851 for description and validation of the model with other antibiotics). The activity of P-gp was inhibited by incubation with verapamil (100 mM) and GF120918 (0.25 mg/L), or stimulated with ouabain (1 mM). Gemfibrozil (an inhibitor of the MRP transporters) was used as control. Results: The data presented in the Table show that P-gp modulators affect the cell handling and the intracellular activity of DAP in the same directions (verapamil and GF120918 increase DAP accumulation and activity, while oubain decrease them both), whereas a MRP inhibitor is without effect. Results: Among isolates from Northern Stockholm, 59/63 isolates were positive for CTX-M. CTX-M-15 was the most prevalent subtype (39/59). CTX-M-14 was found in 17/59 isolates, while 7 isolates produced CTX-M-2-like or TEM-derived ESBLs. From Southern Stockholm 92/97 isolates were found to be CTX-M positive, out of which 72 were CTX-M-15 and 17 were CTX-M-14. Two isolates produced CTX-M-22, and the rest produced either CTX-M-2-like or TEM-derived ESBLs. The PhP-typing revealed the presence of one Northern clone (n = 16) and one Southern clone (n = 13). All isolates were resistant to cefpodoxime, and 70% were resistant to ciprofloxacin. In vitro susceptibility to ceftazidime (according to EUCAST) was observed in some CTX-M-14 isolates, and some TEM-producers were cefotaxime susceptible. Conclusions: This study identified CTX-M-15 as the dominating ESBL genotype in Stockholm. Although two clones of respectively 14 and 16 isolates could be identified, the majority of the strains were clonally unrelated. O433 Faecal carriage of extended-spectrum b-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli: prevalence and risk factors in different populations J. Rodr\u00edguez-Ba\u00f1o, M.D. Navarro, L. L\u00f3pez-Cerero, C. Morillo, M.A. Muniain, A. Pascual (Seville, ES) Objectives: Extended-spectrum b-lactamase-producing Escherichia coli (ESBLEC) is an emerging cause of community acquired infections. We investigated the prevalence of faecal carriage of ESBLEC in different groups of patients and the variables associated with carriage. Methods: Faecal carriage of ESBLEC was investigated from June 2005 to September 2006 in 4 groups of persons: outpatients from whom ESBLEC had been isolated from a clinical sample (group A); livingtogether relatives (group B1); non-living-together relatives (group B2); and patients randomly chosen among those being attended at the emergency department (group C). Rectal swabs were obtained from all of them and inoculated in MacConkey-cefotaxime (2 mg) and MacConkeyceftazidime (2 mg). ESBL production was studied following CLSI recommendations. The following data were collected: demographics, previous healthcare relation, co-morbidities, previous use of antimicrobials and proton-pump inhibitors, invasive procedures, feeding habits, and pets. Multivariate analysis of the association of the different variables with faecal carriage were performed using logistic regression. Results: We included 54, 74, 32, and 54 patients in groups A, B1, B2 and C, respectively. Rectal colonisation by ESBLEC was detected in 36 (68%), 22 (30%), 5 (16%) and 4 (7%) persons from groups A, B1, B2 and C, respectively. The prevalence rates were significantly different between group A and all others (p < 0.001), and between groups B1 and C (p = 0.02). Among people in groups B1, B2 and C, multivariate analysis showed higher risk of colonisation in relatives of group A patients, either living with them (OR = 16.1; 95% CI: 4.Previous antimicrobial use was not associated with increased risk.Conclusions: Faecal carriage of ESBLEC is more frequent in relatives of patients from which ESBLEC is isolated from a clinical sample than in non relatives, suggesting either person to person transmission of isolates/ genetic elements, or acquisition from a common source. Some feeding habits were associated with carriage, but previous antimicrobial use was not. Molecular studies are progress to further elucidate the epidemiology of faecal carriage of ESBLEC.O434 Occurrence of ESBL-producing Escherichia coli in outflow from a wastewater treatment plantS. Galvin, D. Morris, P. Hickey, M. Cormican (Galway, IE)Objectives: This study describes the isolation of extended spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) producing E. coli strains in outflow from a munici-pal secondary wastewater treatment plant. The role the environment plays in the dissemination, maintenance and amplification of antimicrobial resistance is an area of increased scrutiny. Few studies have examined surface waters and effluent for the presence of antimicrobial resistant organisms. Methods: Six samples (1 per week) were collected from the outflow of a municipal secondary wastewater treatment plant between August and September 2006. These were screened for the presence of E. coli resistant to ampicillin, cefoxitin, cefotaxime, and ciprofloxacin. Resistant isolates were tested for susceptibility to sixteen antimicrobial agents by Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) disk diffusion methods, including the following b-lactams: ampicillin, cefpodoxime, cefotaxime and ceftazidime. ESBL production was confirmed by the CLSI combination disk method for ESBL production using cefpodoxime. Confirmed ESBL producers were screened for blaTEM, blaSHV and blaCTX-M by PCR using specific primers. Relatedness of ESBL producers was determined by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) using XbaI. Results: Thirty-four isolates of E. coli resistant to one or more antimicrobial agents tested were identified. Seven (21%) were confirmed as ESBL producers. All 7 confirmed ESBL producers were resistant to 3 or more antimicrobial agents tested. PCR revealed a blaTEM gene in all 7, and a blaCTX-M group 1 gene in 3 isolates. PFGE analysis identified 5 pulsed field profiles (PFPs). These were isolated from samples taken on 3 separate dates. Isolates with indistinguishable PFPs were isolated from samples taken on different dates. Isolates with distinguishable PFPs were isolated on the same date. Conclusion: This is the first report of the occurrence of ESBL-producing E. coli in the outflow from a secondary wastewater treatment plant and reflects the extent to which this resistance phenomenon is now very widely disseminated.O435 Prevalence of ESBL in the Netherlands: the ONE studyJ. Mouton, A. Voss, J. Arends, S. Bernards on behalf of the ONE Study groupBackground: The prevalence of extended spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) producers is increasing worldwide. Data on prevalence in The Netherlands are sparse. Therapeutic options for ESBL producers are generally limited to fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and carbapenems. Ertapenem is a new broad spectrum carbapenem that may be suited to use against ESBL-producing enterobacteriaceae. Aim of the ONE study was to determine the prevalence of ESBL in the Dutch population and the susceptibility of ESBL producers against Ertapenem and other antibiotics.Methods: 22 laboratories equally distributed in the Netherlands participated in the study. Each lab was asked to collect up to 100 consecutive enterobacteriacea isolates from clinical samples during a 4 month period. Isolates from rectal and nose swabs were excluded, as were isolates from surveillance cultures. A maximum of one isolate per species per patient was allowed. Isolates were identified by participating laboratories using their own standard identification technique. MICs were determined using Etest on site for ertapenem, amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, tobramycin, cotrimoxazole and ciprofloxacin. Control ATCC strains were included. Afterwards, strains were collected by the central lab for further analysis. For ESBL screening, primary isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae were subcultured on a ESBL screening plate with ceftazidime and cefotaxim. Colonies growing on the screening plate were tested for ESBL using the Etest TZ/TZL and CT/CTL strip and if necessary the PM/PML strip. K. oxytoca was evaluated based on Etest results of ceftazidime and ceftriaxon. All other enterobacteriacae were tested with the Etest PM/PML strip to differentiate the ESBL from the AmpC producers. Results: The overall prevalence of confirmed ESBL producers was close to 6%. 43% of all isolates were identified as E. coli and 12% as K. pneumoniae, with ESBL prevalences of up to 6% and 8%, respectively. The MIC90's (mg/L) were 0.38 for ciprofloxacin, 0.125 for ertapenem, 0.094 for meropenem, 32 for cotrimoxazole and 2 for tobramycin. Conclusion: This was the first large scale survey to determine the prevalence of ESBL-producing enterobacteriaceae in the Netherlands. The overall prevalence of close to 6% is significant and indicates that there is reason to start monitoring ESBL prevalence on a regular basis in order to better guide control measures. O436 Genetic characterisation of highly prevalent MBLs and OXA carbapenemases in multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strains in a Romanian hospital R. Cernat, C. Balotescu, V. Lazar, O. Banu, D. Ivanescu, M. Bucur (Bucharest, RO) Objective: This study was designed to demonstrate (1) the clonal relationship, (2) the prevalence and type of acquired metallo-b-lactamases (MBLs) and oxacillinases with carbapenem-hydrolyzing activity and (3) the potential risk of integron dissemination among multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii strains isolated from cardiovascular devices associated infections. Material and Methods: Multiresistant A. baumannii isolates collected between 2003 and 2006 at the Institute for Cardiovascular Diseases C.C. Iliescu were tested by VITEK 2 automatic system, IPM disc Hodge test, IPM-EDTA+SMA double disk synergy tests, double disk test in MH agar plus cloxacillin (250 mg/l), microdilution tests of b-lactams and colistin, IEF, PCR for blaIPM-1, blaVIM-1, blaVIM-2, blaOXA-23, blaOXA-24, blaOXA-51 and blaOXA-58, class 1-and class-2 integrons and sequencing for MBL-, OXA-types carbapenemase-encoding genes and integrons. The clonal relationship between the isolates was evaluated by PFGE.Results: 120 IPM-resistant (MIC 8\u221264 mg/l) A. baumannii isolates were MBL-and multiple OXA-types producers carrying blaIPM-1 and blaVIM-2 alleles, blaOXA-23 and blaOXA-58-plasmid mediated genes, respectively. PFGE showed six different clonal lineages. The blaVIM2 gene was carried on a gene cassette inserted into class-1 integrons, identical to those from P. aeruginosa in Europe and which included 5 different known additional cassettes (arr-3, catB3, aadA1, aacC1 and aacA4).",

Verhaegen (Yvoir, Ghent, Brussels, Antwerp, Leuven, BE)Objectives: Temocillin is a 6-a-methoxy-derivative of ticarcillin with increased stability to most b-lactamases including AmpC and extendedspectrum types (ESBL). Data concerning its activity against Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates are however scarce. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro activity of temocillin against 652 clinical isolates of Enterobactericaeae collected from patients hospitalised in ICUs at seven Belgian university hospitals in 2005. Materials and Methods: Each centre collected prospectively up to 100 unduplicated Enterobacteriaceae isolates from patients hospitalised in ICUs for >3 days in order to focus the collection on nosocomial pathogens. E-test MICs were determined for temocillin and five comparators (ceftazidime, piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, ciprofloxacin, and amikacin). The presence of ESBL was assessed by double combination disks (cefotaxime and ceftazidime) and by ESBL E-tests. ESBLs were characterised by IEF and PCR for bla genes of SHV, TEM, and CTX-M families and by DNA sequencing. Results: The prevalence of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ES-BLE) averaged 12% but ranged between 3% and 29% in the different hospitals. A large diversity of ESBL types was observed within different species with the predominance of TEM-24 among Enterobacter aerogenes, CTX-M-1 group in Escherichia coli, and CTX-M-9 group in Enterobacter cloacae and Klebsiella oxytoca. SHV-derived ESBLs (SHV-5 and SHV-12) occurred less commonly and mainly in E. cloacae and Klebsiella spp. Temocillin was active against >90% of the isolates, with MIC50 and MIC90 of 4 mg/mL and 16 mg/mL, respectively. Meropenem exhibited the best activity overall (susceptibility 99%; MIC50 and MIC90 of 0.064 mg/mL and 0.19 mg/mL) whereas ceftazidime (21% nonsusceptibility) and ciprofloxacin (20% non-susceptibility) scored the worst. A high frequency of resistance to ceftazidime (89%) and to ciprofloxacin (72%) was observed especially among E. aerogenes. On the other hand, temocillin retained good activity against ESBL-producing E. coli (92%) but was found less active against some ESBLE and AmpCderepressed producers (E. aerogenes, Serratia marcescens). Conclusions: These in vitro data illustrate the wide variation in prevalence of ESBLE isolates in Belgian ICUs and support the usefulness of temocillin as therapeutic option for infections caused by ESBLE and other cephalosporin-resistant strains which are causing an increasing number of infections in critically-ill patients.",

Patients under the age of 18 with immunodeficiency (HIV, transplant, infliximab use) or suspected imported disease (less than five years of residence in Spain) were excluded. Results: Out of a total of 449 patients with documented TB, 319 adult patients were included; of these, 210 (65.8%) were under the age of 65 and 109 (34.2%) were 65 [27 (8.4%) were 80 years]. The mean age of the younger group was 37.1 (range 18\u221264), and that of the older group was 75.5 (range 65\u221298). Comorbidities (measured by Charlson index) were significantly associated with older age (1.43 vs. 0.43; p < 0.001). Pulmonary tuberculosis was more frequent in the younger group (73.8% vs. 49.5%; p < 0.001) and had a higher rate of cavitation in the chest X-ray (27.6% vs. 2.75%; p < 0.001). Extra-pulmonary and disseminated tuberculosis were more common in the elderly (50.4% vs. 26.1%; p < 0.001). No significant differences were observed between groups in time to diagnosis (65.34 vs. 59.44 days; p = 0.66). Drug toxicity was significantly higher in the elderly (22% vs. 9.8%; p = 0.006), mainly due to hepatic toxicity. Tuberculosis-related mortality (30-day mortality) was higher in the elderly (18.3% vs. 1.6%; p < 0.001), mainly due to acute respiratory failure (30%). The subset of patients older than 80 years had a significant higher TB-related mortality (44.4% vs. 9.8%; p = 0.01) compared with those between 65 and 79 years. No significant differences in co morbidities or in clinical manifestations were observed. Conclusion: Tuberculosis in the elderly and in the very old had a higher frequency of atypical features and disseminated TB, more adverse drug reactions and increased TB-related mortality. Data suggest that TB in the ninth decade has a mortality rate 2-fold higher than in the age group of 65 to 79 years.O471 A risk of tuberculosis persists in patients treated with anti TNF-a antagonist therapy despite prophylactic guidelines: identification of main risk factors D. Salmon, F. Tubach, P. Ravaud, R. Chiche Manian, C. Michelet, P. Dellamonica, N. Benammar, X. Mariette, O. Lortholary on behalf of RATIOIntroduction: Official guidelines for TB screening and chemoprophylaxis have been elicited in France (2002 modified in 2005) as in other countries for patients who begin TNF-a antagonist therapy. Our objective was to assess the impact of these guidelines on TB incidence in such patients. Methods: A prospective cohort study involving 486 clinical departments in mainland France was designed by a multidisciplinary group (RATIO) to describe opportunistic infections, severe bacterial infections or lymphomas occurring in patients treated with anti TNF. In accordance with national health authorities, all cases are notified to RATIO. All TB cases were validated by an experts committee. A case-control study (25 first TB cases matched with respect to gender and subjacent illness with 2 control patients for each case) was performed. Results: We report 37 cases of tuberculosis that occurred within 2.5 years in patients treated with TNF antagonists in France (infliximab 18 cases, adalimumab 17 cases and etanercept 2 cases). Median age was 61 years (range 20\u221283). Median anti TNF treatment duration at onset was 33 weeks (2\u2212231). Indication was rheumatoid arthritis in 25 cases, ankylosing spondylitis in 10 cases, Takayashu disease in 1 case. All patients were taking concomitant immunosuppressive agents: prednisone (15), methotrexate (13), salazopyrine (5) or azathioprine (4). No one had received antituberculous chemoprophylaxis before starting anti TNF therapy. Before anti TNF therapy, results of the intradermal tuberculin test (Mantoux test) was <5 mm in 18 patients, between 5 and 10 mm in 7 patients, >10 mm in 1 patient and not done in 3 patients. In the multivariate analysis, the case-control study identified the following risk factors of TB: age (OR = 1.05 [1.03; 1.07], p = 0.02), last anti TNF received (reference etanercept OR = 1; adalimumab OR = 14.6 [1.65; 129.0], p = 0.01; infliximab OR = 5.9 [0.74; 47], p = 0.09) and methotrexate treatment (OR = 0.28 [0.01; 1.08], p = 0.01). Conclusion: Although national guidelines for TB prophylaxis have been elicited, TB remains a risk associated with anti TNF-a therapy. The risk of TB is higher for older patients and for those treated with adalimumab and infliximab than with etanercept.",

Data on symptoms, duration of exposure and prior BCG vaccination were recorded. Results: 36 contacts were referred for screening, of whom 29 were screened, 28 with both QFN and Mantoux. 20 patients had 8 hours exposure, with 8 (40%) having a positive QFN test compared with 3 (15%) a positive Mantoux test. Of the 9 patients with <8 hours exposure 1 (11.1%) had a positive QFN test, 2 (22.2%) having positive Mantoux tests. 60% of positive Mantoux tests were known to have had BCG vaccination, with 22.2% of QFN positive patients having had BCG. QFN and TST results stratified by 8 hour exposure Conclusion: QUANTIFERON-TB GOLD testing in a hospital associated outbreak of TB correlates well with 8 hour duration of exposure, in agreement with WHO guidelines.

Uzakova, B. Shrestha, I. Bozo, S. Yann, K. Feldmann (Gauting, DE; Tashkent, UZ; Kathmandu, NP; Santa Cruz, BO; Donetzk, UA) MDR-TB is defined by resistance of the respective pathogen (Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex, MBTC) against INH and rifampin RMP. Mortality of MDR-TB is double compared to sensitive TB. Phenotypic drug-susceptibility-testing (DST) lasts up to 8 weeks. Following the DOTS and waiting for DST results, MDR-TB patients are miss-treated with INH and RMP. A new resistance test, Genotype MTBDR TM (G-MDR), has been released, detecting MDR-TB. The test is based on PCR and hybridisation.For its validation, 64 strains have been characterised by threefold DST on solid and liquid media. 100% of RMP resistances (n = 31) and 90% of INH resistances (n = 49) were detected by G-MDR. Specifity was 100%. 112 TB isolates from highly endemic countries were analysed: 31 from Bolivia, 58 from Nepal and 23 from Ukraine. 93% of RMP-resistances were detected with G-MDR. The sensitivity for detection of INH resistance increased with the prevalence of MDR-TB in the respective countries from 64% in Nepal, 74% in Bolivia, 83% in Usbekistan, to 86% in the Ukraine. All G-MDR assays for Nepalese strains were performed in the National Reference TB-Laboratory in Katmandu, demonstrating that the test is robust enough to be applied in developing countries. Finally, the test was applied to 35 sputum specimen from Usbekistan, which were all positive in microscopy. All MDR cases have been detected. Additionally, heteroresistance to INH and RMP could be visualised in nine cases. Genotype MTBDR TM is a fast, easy to perform and robust test, applicable in highly endemic countries. Its sensitivity for the detection of RMP resistance is 100%, for INH up to 90% depending on the MDR prevalence. It is an excellent tool for the detection of heteroresistance. The test can be performed from microscopically positive sputum, reducing the DST time to zero days.O480 Characterisation ofNeisseria meningitidis B causing invasive disease in the Czech Republic P.

Objectives: The presence of ESBL producers (particularly among uropathogens) in geriatric long-term care and rehabilitation facilities (LTCRFs) has not been investigated in Italy, until now. The objective of this study was to evaluate the diffusion of CTX-M type b-lactamases among Escherichia coli clinical isolates from LTCRFs. Methods: During the period April 2003-May 2004, a total of 529 E. coli consecutive non-replicated isolates were collected from inpatients at the LTCRF-RSA ASP \"Golgi-Redaelli\" of Milan. All isolates were identified and screened for ESBL production using the GNS-530 card of the VITEK 1 system, the double-disk synergy test and/or the confirmatory CLSI method. IEF coupled with a bioassay, PCR amplification and sequencing were carried out to identify the nature of the blaCTX-Mtype determinants. Conjugation experiments, plasmidic DNA extraction followed by restriction analisys were also performed. The clonal relationships between the isolates were evaluated by PFGE of genomic DNA digested with NotI. Results: All the E. coli clinical isolates resulted susceptible to piperacillin-tazobactam; 69/529 (13%) were ESBL producers. Such strains were obtained mainly from urinary samples (92.8%), in most cases from catheterised patients (90.6%). The CTX-M-type enzymes detected in 52/69 (75.4%) E. coli isolates showed a pI 8.2 or 8.4 active on cefotaxime, cefepime, and aztreonam. 40/52 (76.9%) CTX-M positive isolates were found to produce also a TEM-1 enzyme. The CTX-M determinants were transferable in 20/52 (38.4%) cases. Sequencing results showed that 4/52 (7.7%) strains were CTX-M-14 producers while the remaining were CTX-M-1 producers. There was a common plasmid in 2/4 of the CTX-M-14 producers, both strains have been isolated from the Golgi institute. After plasmids restriction analysis, the CTX-M-1 coding plasmids exhibited different restriction profiles, while 2/4 CTX-M-14 producers resulted clonally related. PFGE profiles demonstrated the presence of at least 9 different clones. Conclusions: Finding the different CTX-M-1-encoding plasmids in clonally related and unrelated strains of E. coli from the RSA ASP \"Golgi-Redaelli\" indicates a notable spreading potential for these plasmids and suggests that horizontal transfer could be the principal, but not the only mechanism of CTX-M enzymes spreading in the hospital environment. This is the first report of a CTX-M-14 gene in E. coli in Italy. Objectives: One of the emergent factors for the b-lactam antibiotic resistance of pathogenic bacteria is the production of metallob-lactamases (MBLs), which are able to hydrolyse the b-lactam ring in a broad spectrum of substrates, particularly the carbapenems. MBLs have been divided into three different sub-classes B1, B2 and B3 based on sequence similarities [1] . In this report, we investigated the inhibitory effect of mercapto-phosphonate derivatives against MBLs. Methods: The laboratory of P Metzner (University of Caen, France) synthesized 12 different mercapto-phosphonate compounds with the ability to inhibit the subclass B1 VIM-4, the subclass B2 CphA and the subclass B3 L1 MBLs respectively. Consequently, we determined the competitive inhibition constant (Ki) as described by DeMester et al. [2] . We also measured the minimal inhibition concentration ( considerably with molecular screening. 4. Automation of the extraction and detection procedures will further speed up the process and improve standardisation of the molecular screening procedure. These two probes hybridise adjacently to each other. After ligation of the specific probes, all targets are amplified with one universal primerset. The amplified fragments can be discriminated by size fractionation. A competitive internal RNA control is added to each sample allowing discrimination between a true negative sample and a negative sample due to a PCR failure. Prior to the multiplex amplification, viral RNA is converted into cDNA using an one step RT-PCR followed by a limited number of PCR cycles. Results: The RespiFinder-kit was compared with singleplex QPCR assays as well as conventional culturing procedures. Sensitivity of the assay was compared with QPCR using serial dilutions of virus cultures. The same sensitivity was obtained with the RespiFinder-kit as with QPCR. Clinical samples were tested with all three approaches. This showed increased sensitivity of the two nucleic acid based tests over the conventional diagnostic procedures. The results with the RespiFinder-kit and the QPCR assay showed a high degree of correlation.",

Prevalence of L. pneumophila is significantly higher when analysed by PCR as compared to the urine antigen test (P = 0.01), suggesting that the prevalence of this pathogen in severe CAP is higher than suspected so far.Since urine antigen test is restricted to serogroup 1 of L. pneumophila, the fact that the PCR kit detects serogroups 1 to 15 may help to explain this difference. The use of this PCR as a complement of conventional techniques is recommended to improve the detection of L. pneumophila in clinical laboratories.",

The latter are commonly referred to our laboratory for confirmation as \"probable salmonellas\" or Salmonella cultures are received contaminated with other organisms. These require selective isolation prior to identification. This in turn requires time and expense, including special media, additional exposure to microbes and more technologist time to perform subcultures. As many laboratories face budgetary constraints including loss of personnel, we propose a simple, cost-effective method of confirming Salmonella sp. prior to typing. Method: We tested over 350 known Enterobacteriacae with a simple PCR assay. On the basis of their initial biochemistry, e.g. atypical results, we also tested 250 \"probable salmonella\" isolates referred to us for typing. Oligonucleotide primers were prepared according to the sequence of the chromosomal invA gene and the PCR assay was performed from a boiled cell template. An internal amplification control (IAC) was included to indicate possible PCR inhibitors. The trial now aims to evaluate 6-month resource use and costs of both PCR and traditional methods.",

Most of the \"probable Salmonella spp.\" did not produce a PCR product. Further work confirmed them as non-salmonellas. For the isolates that did demonstrate the presence of the invA gene, further testing found that these were salmonella cultures contaminated with other organisms. Current cost savings already demonstrated by using the PCR assay were largely attributable to the time taken by the technologist to perform all the traditional tests before producing a final customer report.",

Results: All strains were resistant to all tested antimicrobials except carbapenems and colistin and negative for metallo-b-lactamase. ERIC-PCR showed four genotypic profiles. Etest MICs for carbapenems ranged from 0.38 to 32 mg/L for imipenem and 0.38 to 6 mg/L for meropenem. Population analysis showed imipenem MIC of heteroresistant populations from 4 to 128 mg/L while meropenem MIC from 0.50 to 16 mg/L with respective frequencies ranging from 4\u00d710 \u22126 to 9\u00d710 \u22125 and from 2\u00d710 \u2212\u22126 to 2\u00d710 \u22124 . All strains showed heteroresistant subpopulations with lower carbapenem susceptibility. Four of them were unstable after subcultures in drug-free medium, while one produced stable carbapenem heteroresistant subpopulations. Real-Time PCR showed increased expression of blaOXA-58 in both imipenem and meropenem heteroresistant populations, whereas genes blaOXA-51 and ampC were unchanged. OMP analysis showed no particular differences. One isolate was positive for ISAba1 which was unrelated to blaOXA-51 and two isolates were positive for ISAba3, adjacent to blaOXA-58 allele. OXA-58 inhibition experiments using 200mM NaCl showed approximately 4-fold reduction of carbapenem MIC in the heteroresistant subpopulations. Conclusions: Gene blaOXA-58 appears to elevate carbapenem MICs in carbepenem heteroresistant A. baumannii strains. Thus, laboratory susceptibility assays may need to be adjusted in order to detect the heteroresistant subpopulations.",

Methods: Strain P. aeruginosa 140 was studied. Identification and susceptibility testing to antipseudomonal antimicrobials was performed by the VITEK 2 automated system. MICs of imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, aztreonam, gentamicin and piperacillin/tazobactam were determined by agar dilution. Etest MBL and the imipenem-EDTA double disc synergy test (DDST) were done to detect MBL production. PCR for gene blaVIM and conserved segments of class-1 integrons was performed. Mating experiments were performed by mixed broth mating using P. aeruginosa PU21 (rif r ) as recipient and plasmid isolation with alkaline lysis. Quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (QRT-PCR) was performed in order to detect transcripts of genes mexB, mexY and ampC. Relative expression levels in strain 140 were compared against those in a susceptible isolate. Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) were analysed by SDS-PAGE. Results: Isolate PA140 was resistant to all tested antimicrobials except aztreonam. Agar dilution MIC of imipenem was 512 and that of meropenem 128 mg/L, while MICs of both gentamicin and piperacillin/ tazobactam were >512 mg/L. MICs of ceftazidime and aztreonam were 32 and 8 mg/L, respectively. Etest MBL exhibited marked decrease in MICs of imipenem compared to imipenem-EDTA (256 and 1.5 mg/L respectively) and DDST was positive. PCR revealed two class-1 integrons. The MBL-associated integron was sequentially consisted of genes blaVIM-4 and blaP1b coding for b-lactamases VIM-4 and PSE-1/ CARB-2 respectively. The second integron comprised sequentially of genes aac(6 )-Ib and blaOXA-35. Plasmid extraction did not reveal any visible plasmids and no transcojugants were produced by mating experiments. QRT-PCR revealed overexpression of genes mexB and mexY as well as a fairly detectable expression of gene ampC in strain PA140 relatively to the susceptible strain. Also, OMP analysis revealed a lower intensity of a protein band of MW \u2248 46 kD in strain 140, consistent with OprD. Conclusions: A P. aeruginosa clinical isolate harboured a novel class-1 integron with two (blaVIM-4 and blaP1b) b-lactamase gene cassettes and a second integron. The isolate was highly carbapenem-and multidrugresistant, had reduced production of porin oprD and overexpressed efflux pumps MexAB-OprM and MexXY-OprM. Methods: Strains were identified using an API 20 NE kit. The MICs were determined using Etest ESBL or MBL strips (AB biodisk, Solna, Sweden) and a wide range of antimicrobial test discs. Isolates positive by Etest MBL strips were further investigated for resistance determinants by PCR using blaVIM, blaIMP, blaSPM-1, blaGIM, blaSIM-1 and class-1 integron specific primers, as well as primers designed to the transposition genes of Tn5090. Amplicons were sequenced by using custom designed primers using standard methods. Results: Six strains were identified as P. aeruginosa and one as Acinetobacter spp. All strains were resistant to imipenem >256mg/L which reduced in the presence of EDTA from 1 to 8 mg/L (MBL Etest strip). All isolates were multi-resistant and only sensitive to colistin. Five P. aeruginosa isolates harboured the blaVIM-2 gene cassette in a class-1 integron containing the gene cassette array: aacA7, blaVIM-2, dhfrB5 and aacA5. The structure was very unusual as it did not contain a 3 conserved sequence (3 CS). However, it did contain Tn5090 transposition genes, absent from most commonly found integron structures. The integron array was identical to those found in P. aeruginosa strains harbouring the blaVIM-2 gene recently characterised from the USA and Norway, and very similar to one recently characterised from India. One strain of P. aeruginosa and an isolate of Acinetobacter spp. also contained the blaVIM-2 gene in a normal class-1 integrons as gene cassettes in the first position that also contained an OXA-2 gene cassette.",

The class-1 integron structure was very unusual as it did not contain a 3 Conserved Sequence (3 CS) consisting of fused qac and sul1 genes. However, it did contain Tn5090 transposition genes, absent from most commonly found class-1 integron structures. The integron array was very similar to a structure found in a P. aeruginosa strain harbouring the blaVIM-2 gene recently characterised from the USA. Conjugation and plasmid isolation experiments failed to transfer resistance to PA01; however, Southern hybridisation demonstrated that blaVIM-2 is carried on a plasmid. The concomitant loss of resistance to ceftazidime and the blaVIM-2 gene was observed after overnight growth at 37\u00baC confirming the hybridisation data. Conclusion: This is the first description of P. aeruginosa strains harbouring blaVIM-2 from India. This further extends the geographic distribution of this multi-resistance conferring allele. The absence of a 3 CS and the presence of the tniC transposition gene suggests that this integron predates the formation of both the 3 CS and a deletion event that immobilised the Tn5090 transposon that carries the class-1 integron. Alkaline lysis method and commercial kits were used to detect the plasmid content. To locate bla OXA-40 Southern transfer hybridisation experiments were carried out using a specific DNA probe labelled with digoxigenin. Preliminary mapping of plasmid DNA was achieved with EcoRI, PstI and Hind III restriction enzymes. Results: Plasmids of similar sizes were observed in all isolates belonging to both clones, frequently combined in groups of several structures. The size of the plasmids were 125, 112, 84, 32, 8, 4, 3.4 and 2.5 kb. Our results showed that the same plasmids were in both clones and that there were some structures which were always presented in groups. Concerning the blaOXA-40 location we could see different signals on different bands. Although some isolates showed a chromosomal positive signal, the majority of them also showed it on different plasmids. Although high diversity was found, it was the plasmid of 32 kb the main structure where the positive hybridisation signal was seen. Mapping of a representative isolate containing that plasmid showed different fragments were the blaOXA-40 gene could be located. Conclusion: Although the predominant clones producing the OXA-40 carbapenemase in our environment are genetically unrelated they bore plasmids of the same size. Isolates from both clones bore plasmids from 2.5 to 125 kb frequently associated in groups. We could see the same plasmids in isolates obtained along the period of study which means that they are stable among the population. The predominant location of the blaOXA-40 gene was on plasmids.

Strains were examined for the presence of carbapenemases using primers for blaKPC and blaOXA 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 33, 40, 48, 49, 51 and 58, as well as metallo-b-lactamases. Amplicons were obtained with all strains with primers for blaKPC; sequencing revealed that 13 contained blaKPC-2 and one contained blaKPC-3. We also examined the ompk35, 36 and 37 porin genes in these strains. Sequencing data indicated that 9/14 strains contained a 1 bp insertion at NT245 in ompk35 resulting in a stop codon. The ompk35 sequence was absent in one strain. Most of the strains had from 3 to 10 aa long inserts into OmpK36 and 37 but these did not correlate with obvious functional disruption in the sequence of these porins. Conclusion: Endemic outbreaks of multi-drug-resistant K. pneumoniae in NYC hospitals are becoming a concern and such resistant strains have spread to other areas of the Eastern USA. Presence of KPCclass carbapenemases in many of these strains account for high-level resistance to carbapenems and loss of functional outer membrane porins may contribute to resistance to these and other antimicrobials. Results: The A. baumannii isolates were mostly from patients hospitalised in intensive care units. MICs determination allowed to divide these isolates into two main phenotypical groups, both being resistant to most b-lactams including carbapenems. Twenty-two A. baumannii isolates possessed the blaOXA-97 gene encoding the novel carbapenemhydrolysing oxacillinase OXA-97 differing from OXA-58 by a single amino acid substitution (Gly to Ala at position DBL35). OXA-97 exhibits the same hydrolysis profile as OXA-58, hydrolysing penicillins and carbapenems but sparing expanded-spectrum b-lactams. Genotyping revealed that the OXA-97-positive A. baumannii isolates belonged to a single clone, although six distinct genotypes were identified thus defining subclones. The blaOXA-97 gene was located on plasmids varying in size and they were all transferred to an A. baumannii reference strain by electroporation, whereas mating-out assays were unsuccessful. Only one isolate harboured the blaOXA-97 gene on its chromosome. The other twenty-four carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii isolates did not produce any carbapenemase and they did not possess any CHDL gene. They were clonally related according to PFGE analysis. Conclusion: This study constitutes the first description of dissemination of a CHDL enzyme in Africa and reports on the identification of the novel OXA-97 being closely related to OXA-58. As observed for OXA-58 in other countries, the gene coding for OXA-97 was mostly located on plasmids and identified in A. baumannii isolates being the source of an outbreak. Interestingly, this epidemiological survey showed that outbreaks of two different carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii strains had occurred in that hospital during the same period of time.",

Further testing for susceptibility to cefoxitin and cefepime was done to identify putative AmpC producing strains. Strains resistant to cefoxitin were tested by the AmpC-disk test. This test discriminates between cefoxitin-resistance caused by cephamycinase activity in test-positive strains and other causes (e.g. loss of permeability or altered drug target) in test-negative strains. Results: 68 of the 152 cephalosporin-resistant isolates exhibited resistance to cefoxitin and were classified as putative AmpC-producers. When further tested with the AmpC-disk test, 47/68 strains tested positive and were classified as AmpC producing; resistance to cefoxitin of the remaining 21 strains was not accountable for by b-lactamase production. 20/47 AmpC-disk test positive strains were inhibited by clavulanic acid and were classified as both AmpC and ESBL producing. These strains were significantly less sensitive to cefepime than the 26 strains not inhibited by clavulanic; the latter strains were classified as exclusively AmpC producing. Conclusion: AmpC is prevalent in cephalosporin resistant E. coli and Klebsiella spp. In the present study 19% of the strains were classified as AmpC producing and of these strains 43% were also ESBL producers.Whether the latter group is truly AmpC producing or the positive AmpC disk test is the result of cephamycinase activity of the ESBL present is presently unknown. Molecular characterisation of the b-lactamases produced by the strains is in progress and may help resolve this question.",
