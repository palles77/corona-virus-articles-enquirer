            "text": "Rat coronaviruses (RCVs) infect laboratory rats and confound biomedical research results. In vitro systems developed so far have limited the growth in knowledge about RCVs by not permitting generation of plaque-cloned virus stocks, reliable isolation of RCVs from rat tissues, or growth of high titered stocks of all isolates. Due to the fact that less than 20% of L2(Percy) cells were becoming infected, sublines were produced and selected for maximal growth of RCVs. Screening of 238 cell sublines yielded L2p. 176 cells which were highly susceptible to all RCVs tested; however, susceptibility declined after 30 passages in vitro. Low-passaged L2p. 176 cells Were used to isolate virus from natural outbreaks and to propagate individual RCV plaques into high titered stocks. Proteins from six RCV isolates were immunoblotted using polyclonal rat and mouse antibodies to sialodacryoadenitis virus and polyclonal monospecific rabbit and goat antibodies against the peplomer (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). Proteins of two prototype, one Japanese and three wild type RCVs were examined and found to be similar to those of MHV, although the exact sizes and ratios of protein forms were unique for most RCV isolates. This study reports the development of a continuous cell line which reliably supports RCVs opening an opportunity for further in vivo studies of the biology of these agents. As a first step in the characterization of RCVs, we have shown that RCV proteins are very similar to those of MHV.",

RCV infections stocks of prototype RCVs in the Percy subline of mouse fibroblast L2 cells (Percy et al., 1989 (Percy et al., , 1990 and improved virus quantification and yields in L2(Percy) cells treated with dietheylaminoethyl dextran (DEAE-D) and trypsin (Gaertner et al., 1991 (Gaertner et al., , 1993 . These improvements in culture techniques have facilitated the production of high titered stocks of previously cultivated RCV isolates and production of individual RCV plaques for further study, but when individual plaques were put back into L2 (Percy) cells, the resulting stocks had only low titers (Gaertner, unpublished) . Alternative methods, including intracranial inoculation of infant mice and oronasal inoculation of athymic nude rats, also failed to yield high titered stocks from individual plaques. Additionally, RCVs could not be reliably isolated from rat tissues using L2 (Percy) cells. Because less than 20% of L2(Percy) cells became infected when inoculated with high titered mouse brain suspensions of sialodacryoadenitis virus strain 681 (RCV-SDA-681, or with Parker's rat coronavirus (RCV-P, Parker et al., 1970) , cell sublines were produced and selected to maximize growth of wild-type and prototype isolates. We report the generation of an L2 (Percy) cell subline, L2p.176 cells, which exhibits marked CPE and yields high titered virus stocks when inoculated with all RCV strains. This subline was used to isolate RCVs from naturally infected rats and to propagate RCV stocks from plaques. Immunoblots of RCVs grown in L2p.176 cells revealed typical coronaviral proteins that were antigenically related to mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) . Diversity in molecular weights and ratios of S and N proteins was detected among two prototypes, one Japanese and three wild-type isolates; suggesting that biological differences in the behavior of isolates may be related to differences in proteins.",

CPE was scored subjectively. Cell lines that had visible CPE due to all four virus isolates were re-screened with a lower virus dose of the same isolates (0.02-0.06 PFU/cell) and were also inoculated with 0.1 PFU/cell of RCV-SDA-L2. The extent of CPE in each well was scored and cells were scraped into the media and the media was frozen from cell lines with CPE due to all five isolates.

Purified RCV-SDA-681 virus grown in L2p.176 cells and MHV-A59 grown in J774A.1 cells were prepared for use in immunoblots by centrifugation on 30/60% sucrose gradients in a SW 28 rotor at 24K for 4 h and were frozen at -20\u00b0C until use. Viral proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in 8 or 12% acrylamide running gels with 5% stacking gels (Towbin et al., 1979) . Undiluted lysates of cells infected with RCVs were loaded into wells except for RCV-SDA-681, CARS and MHV-A59. Lysates of RCV-SDA-681 and CARS were diluted to twothirds and one-third concentrations prior to loading, respectively, based on their stronger reactivity with polyclonal mouse antibody against RCV-SDA-681. Volumes of MHV-A59 lysate or virion were selected based on signal strength from previous blots (Kunita et al., 1995) . Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose (Hoeffer Scientific Instruments, MN). Blots were blocked with milk or bovine serum albumin.

An RCV wild-type virus previously cultivated only by mouse brain inoculation has been grown from mouse brain stock to a hightitered tissue culture stock (106.5 PFU/ml) in L2p.176 cells (Fig. 2) . Two forms of an additional isolate, RCV-V230 and RCV-V20 also grew in L2p.176 cells. Both isolates produced typical CPE within 24-48 h and yielded titers of 105.6 and 104.4 PFU/ml on initial passage. CARS, a Japanese isolate of rat coronavirus propagated by mouse inoculation, produced a stock in L2p.176 cells containing 105.3 PFU/ml and produced granular CPE consisting of small syncytia and less refractile (dark) areas of the cell sheet without forming the large syncytia typical of other RCVs (Fig.  3(A) ). Plaques formed by CARS in L2p. 176 cells under agarose were small, ragged and difficult to count. Although CPE due to CARS was subtle compared to other RCV isolates, more than 75% of L2p.176 cells inoculated with CARS contained RCV antigen when stained by IFA (Fig. 3(B) ).",

Both rat and mouse antiserum primarily detected proteins of 40-55 kD, a size range likely to be forms of the N protein (Fig. 5 (A) and 5(B)). The rat antiserum also detected a protein at approximately 180 kD in RCV-SDA-681 and CARS and a protein of greater than 200 kD in RCV-SDA-681, RCV-BCMM, RCV-WT, and RCV-W which are suspected to be uncleaved and multimeric S protein forms, respectively (Fig. 5(A) ). Proteins greater than 55 kD were not detected using mouse anti-RCV-SDA-681. Rabbit and goat polyclonal monospecific antibodies produced against gel-purified (denatured) proteins of MHV-A59 were used to confirm the identity of RCV proteins. The proteins, seen at 180 and > 200 kD using rat-anti-RCV-SDA-681 serum in RCV-SDA-681, RCV-BCMM, 5, 6, 7 and 8, Fig. 5(A) ) were visible using polyclonal rabbit anti-S MHV-A59 antiserum as uncleaved forms and multiples in all RCVs tested (lanes 2 8, Fig. 6(A) ). Proteins visible at < 180 kD were suspected to be cleaved forms of S and were seen in varying proportions in RCV-SDA-681, RCV-BCMM, and RCV-W, as well as in MHV-A-59 ( Fig. 6(A) ). Each isolate had a different pattern of protein sizes and proportions recognized by anti-S antibody, with the exception of RCV-SDA-681 and RCV-WT which were similar. The cleaved S protein fragments of RCV-SDA-681, each approximately 90 kD in MHV A59, differ in size, resulting in two distinct bands (Fig. 6(A) ). Thus the RCV S protein forms The protein bands ranging in size from 40-55 kD that were detected by polyclonal mouse and rat anti-RCV-SDA-681 antiserum (Fig. 5(A) and (B)) were confirmed to be multiple forms of the nucleocapsid (N) protein using rabbit anti-N MHV-A59 antiserum (Fig. 6(B) ). The sizes and proportions of dominant N variants varied among RCV isolates, with the dominant N proteins of RCV-SDA-681, RCV-P and RCV-WT appearing identical in size. Thus the N protein of RCVs is the dominant protein against which antibody is generated in animals and ranges in size from 40-55 kD.",

L2p.176 cells were shown to be superior to the parental cell line in their abilities to detect RCV stocks as higher in titer, to isolate new RCVs from rats, and to grow all RCV isolates tested, including individual RCV plaques, to high titered stocks. Although growth curves showed the amount of virus ultimately produced by DEAE-D-and trypsin-treated L2(Percy) and L2p.176 cells to be similar, virus was produced more slowly in L2(Percy) cells. Mouse brain suspensions of RCVs may have been more readily cultivable than individual RCV plaques in L2(Percy) cells due to the mixture of viral types within a mouse brain stock versus the single viral type in an RCV plaque. In our screening of cell clones it is likely that we have propagated a clone of a cell type more uniformly susceptible to RCVs. Additionally, some of our difficulty propagating individual RCV plaques may have been due to the use of more highly passed cultures ( > 80 generations) of L2(Percy) cells while using low passage L2p.176 cells. When using either L2 (Percy) or L2p. 176 cells, repeated cell line passage tended to diminish RCV-induced CPE and we recommend the use of low passage cells ( < 30 generations) to maximize visualization of CPE.",

CARS, isolated in 1982 in Japan by Maru and Sato, is less well studied than the two American prototype isolates, RCV-SDAV-681 (sialodacryoadenitis virus) and RCV-P (Parker's rat coronavirus), and had been passed 95 times in cell culture prior to arrival in our laboratory. CARS differs from other RCVs studied in its cell tropism in vitro, its apparent inability to induce large syncytia formation and its failure to produce the typical pneumotropic infection associated with RCVs when inoculated parenterally into infant mice. In vitro cell tropism, syncytia formation and pneumotropism may have changed as a result of multiple cell culture passages. However, the cross reactivity of CARS with other RCVs by immunofluorescence and the similarity of CARS proteins to those of MHV and RCVs confirm that it is closely related to these coronaviruses. Furthermore, the recognition of CARS peplomeric S protein by rat anti-RCV antiserum confirms its likely identity as an RCV strain rather than as an MHV strain. Because CARS forms ill-defined plaques on L2p.176 cells, generation of plaque-cloned CARS stocks and it's use in future studies may be hindered.",

This may be due to differences in viral passage histories and virus preparation methods. Barker et al. detected primarily the M and N proteins of purified virions of RCV-SDA-681 and RCV-P grown in L2(Percy) cells. Their use of virus grown in L2(Percy) cells resulted in relatively low-titered material and necessitated multiple concentration steps in order to produce detectable protein bands. In contrast, using L2p.176 cells, we were able to detect RCV proteins routinely in infected cell lysates without concentration steps. Barker et al. (1994) found the primary RCV virion N protein of both prototype isolates to be approximately 53 kD. A protein of 53 kD is consistent with the size of the N protein seen in RCV-SDA-681 virions (lane 2, Figs. 5 and 6). They also detected multiple-sized N-forms, similar to the forms we saw in both virion and infected-cell preparations and indicated that they are due to alternative phosphorylation sites. In Barker's studies, a band of 100 kD, detected with polyclonal antibody was postulated, but not confirmed to be monomeric RCV S protein. The authors attributed their difficultly in detecting the S protein to it's loss during purification steps. We readily detected the S protein using goat antiserum against the S protein of MHV-A59.",
