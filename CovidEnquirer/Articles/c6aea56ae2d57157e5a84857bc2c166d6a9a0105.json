            "text": "Background: On May 19, 2017, the cluster of 6 acute respiratory infections due to adenovirus in the swimming department of a physical education school (School J) was reported to Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An epidemiological investigation was conducted to identify the transmission route of the infection and to control the outbreak. Materials and Methods: A retrospective cohort study (Study 1) was conducted on students and teachers of the athletic departments using the swimming pool, and a prospective surveillance (Study 2) was conducted on all students and teachers of the School J. A case was defined as any student and school personnel who developed more than two of the following symptoms from April 10 to July 2, 2017: fever, sore throat, cough, rhinorrhea, or headache. Relative risks (RRs) were calculated to compare the attack rates according to potential risk factors. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to identify the risk factors for infection in the outbreak. Results: 47 cases were identified: 33 (55.9%) cases occurred among 59 students and teachers in Study 1 and 14 (3.9%) among 362 students and school personnel in Study 2. There were 18 laboratory confirmed adenovirus infection cases. The common symptoms were headache (71.7%), fever (69.6%), rhinorrhea (63.0%), sputum (56.5%), and sore throat (54.3%). 23.9% of the cases were accompanied with diarrhea and 19.6% with eye congestion. None of the cases developed pneumonia. 32.6% of the cases were hospitalized. In Study 1, attack rate in the swimming department was higher than that in others (RR: 1.90; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.01-3.60). In Study 2, being a member of the shooting department (RR: 20.70; 95% CI: 4.90 -87.47) and being a first year high school student (RR: 10.95; 95% CI: 2.90 -41.33) were identified as risk factors for the infections. Genetic analyses of the adenoviruses showed 100% identical sequence in homology and confirmed the human adenovirus B55 (HAdV-B55). No adenovirus was detected at examining the water and environment of the swimming pool and dormitory. Conclusion: The outbreak is inferred to be occurred via propagated transmission among the students in the same athletic department, while the students with symptoms of respiratory infection continued performing school activities without any restrictions. Infection control measures such as early detection of symptoms of respiratory infection and restriction of group activity are necessary to prevent respiratory infection outbreak in the communal living setting.",

            "text": "The adenovirus (HAdV) is a double-stranded DNA virus. It is divided into seven species by DNA homology and has more than 70 serotypes [1] . Depending on the serotype, HAdV causes various infectious diseases such as respiratory infections, gastroenteritis, and epidemic conjunctivitis. The most common infection due to HAdV is pharyngitis [2, 3] . Mainly developed among children, most of them recover naturally. However some cases progress to severe respiratory infection such as pneumonia and cause death. The known types that cause severe respiratory infection among adults are types 3, 4, and 7, and types 14 and 55 have been reported as the cause of outbreaks [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Adenovirus is transmitted via respiratory droplets, fecal to oral routes, or contaminated environments, and rarely via swimming pool water [10, 11] . The incubation period of an acute respiratory infection by adenovirus is 2~14 days [2] . Adenovirus infection outbreak in swimming pool, the healthcare facilities, and military camps have been reported [5, [12] [13] [14] [15] . An oral vaccine has been introduced in the United States to prevent extensive epidemics of respiratory infections caused by types 4 and 7 in military camps [16] . In Korea, a severe case of adenovirus infection in a military camp, cases of pneumonia and consequent death caused by type 55 have been reported [17] [18] [19] [20] . But there has been no report of adenovirus respiratory infection outbreak in schools, education facilities, and private residential facilities in Korea. This study is the first report of the outbreak of acute respiratory infection caused by adenovirus, occurred on school in Korea.",

The analysis on the HAdV B-14 acute respiratory infection that occurred in the 4 states of the US showed a case fatality rate of 5% [19] . It has been reported that HAdV B-55 caused severe pneumonia in among the members of the Korean military. The physical education School J had some similarities with military camps: all students are accommodated in a dormitory, sometimes stayed during weekends to attend trainings, and performed lots of physical activities. Although none of them developed pneumonia, 32.6% were hospitalized. There are some opinions that overcrowding or increased physical and psychological stress is one of the factors for the of HAdV B-55 infection among adults [4, 24] . Therefore, HAdV B-55 is considered as a possible causal pathogen when the acute respiratory infection outbreak occurred in those settings.",

Sharing a dormitory room was also assumed to have contributed to the transmission of the infection, but it was not identified as an independent risk factor. Therefore, it was presumed that the propagation mostly occurred during the performance of activities held by each athletic department, while some propagation occurred during class activities. Adenovirus is transferred via contacts, droplet, and exposure to contaminated environments [10, 11] . In this investigation, infection control measures were applied on two infection transmission routes.

Thus, there is a possibility that a thorough investigation has not been conducted on non-users of the swimming pool.

In order to minimize the bias, face-to-face interviews were conducted for a considerable amount of time. In cases of hospital admission, medical records were investigated.
