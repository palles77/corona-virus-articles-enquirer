            "text": "Acute lung injury/acute respiratory distress syndrome (ALI/ARDS) is a common critical emergency with high mortality in clinical practice. The key mechanism of ALI/ARDS is that the excessive inflammatory response damages the integrity of alveolar and bronchial cell membrane and thus affects their basic function. Phospholipids are the main component of cell membranes. Phospholipase A2 (PLA2), which catalyzes the cleavage of membrane phospholipids, is the most important inflammatory mediator of ALI. However, clara cell secretory protein 1 (CCSP1), an endogenous PLA2 inhibitor can increase the self-defense of membrane phospholipids. Thus, CCSP1 up-regulation and PLA2 inhibition constitutes an effective method for ensuring the stability of membrane phospholipids and for the treatment of ALI/ARDS. In the present study, we developed an in vitro model of ALI via lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation of a human bronchial epithelial cell line, BEAS-2B, and assessed the mRNA and protein levels of CCSP1 and PLA2 in the model cells. The results demonstrated LPS induction inhibited the transcription and protein expression of CCSP1, but only the protein level of membrane associated PLA2 was increased, suggesting that in the in vitro ALI model, abnormally regulated CCSP1 transcription plays a crucial role in the damage of cell membrane. To find out the reason that CCSP1 expression was decreased in the ALI model, we predicted, by means of bioinformatics, putative transcription factors which would bind to CCSP1 promoter, examined their background and expression, and found that a transcription factor, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein \u03b2 (C/EBP \u03b2), was correlated with the transcription of CCSP1 in the in vitro ALI model, and its phosphorylation in the model was decreased. CHIP-PCR and luciferase reporter assay revealed that C/EBP \u03b2 bound to CCSP1 promoter and facilitated its transcription. Therefore, we conclude that there is a C/EBP \u03b2/CCSP1/PLA2 pathway in the in vitro ALI model. The study of underlying mechanism show that the activity of C/EBP \u03b2 depends on its phosphorylation:LPS stimulation reduced C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation and suppressed the transcription of CCSP1 in BEAS-2B cells, which resulted in enhanced PLA2 and the consequent membrane damage. And further study shows that overexpression of CDK2(Cyclindependent kinase 2), promoted the phosphorylation of C/EBP \u03b2 and inhibited PLA2 through the C/EBP \u03b2/CCSP1/PLA2 pathway, so as to attenuate membrane damage. The significance of this study lies in that artificial C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation regulation may ease the membrane damage in ALI and improve membrane repair.",

The integrity of the cellular membrane is essential for maintaining the vital activities of cells (Lucas et al., 2009) . The physiological function of damaged membranes can be recovered by repair, regeneration or reshaping. Phospholipids are the main component of cell membranes, and their degradation marks the start of cellular damage (De Luca et al., 2012; Elder et al., 2012) . PLA2, a phospholipase highly expressed on cellular membranes, catalyzes the hydrolysis of the sn-2 position of membrane glycerophospholipids to release lysolecithin, platelet activating factor (PAF) and arachidonic acid (AA), which process is a key link to induce lung injury (Kitsiouli et al., 2009; Shiyu et al., 2011) . CCSP is a major secretion of pulmonary clara cells, the nonciliated epithelial cells coving distal bronchiole (Jorens et al., 1995) . As an endogenous PLA2 inhibitor, CCSP1 has potent immune inhibition and anti-inflammation activity (Rastogi and McHowat, 2009 ) and can increase self-defense of the membrane phospholipids (Magrioti and Kokotos, 2010) . CCSP1 reduces the production of lysolecithin, blocks the abnormal deposition of integrins in fibroblasts, and inhibits the release of AA derivatives as inflammatory mediators, the chemotactic response of fibroblasts to PAF, and the production and action of multiple inflammatory mediators (Wong et al., 2009 ). In our initial study stage, we found that the mRNA and protein of CCSP1 were reduced in the in vitro ALI model, BEAS-2B cells exposed to LPS (Shiyu et al., 2011) . Up-regulation of CCSP1 can therefore stabilize membrane phospholipids and maintain normal cellular function in response to external factors, particularly endotoxin, by inhibiting PLA2 activity and thus preventing lung injury.",

One day before viral infection, BEAS-2B cells in logarithmic phase were made into suspension by trypsin digestion, and the number of viable cells was counted by using trypan blue staining. Cells were collected by 1000 \u00d7 g centrifugation and re-suspended in LHC-8 medium to a concentration of 5 \u00d7 10 5 cells/ml. Cells were seeded on 6-well plates, 2 ml/well, and cultured overnight under normal conditions. One day after seeding, BEAS-2B cells were infected with lentiviruses diluted by LHC-8 at a MOI of 10, and the medium was refreshed after 24 h.

ELISA results ( Fig. 2A) show that TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-10 were increased in BEAS-2B cells induced with LPS for 12 h, 24 h or 48 h, with significant difference in the three inflammatory factors between the LPS group and the cell group at 24 and 48 h (P < 0.05). Measurements of PAF and AA demonstrate that induction of 10 mg/ml LPS for 12, 24, or 48 h increased PAF and AA, both of which peaked at 48 h. The inflammatory indicators and membrane metabolic indices suggested that BEAS-2B cells displayed an obvious inflammatory response after being induced by 10 mg/ml LPS and released PAF and AA, indicating the successful establishment of the in-vitro ALI model. Based on the model, we assessed CDK2, CCSP1 and PLA2 levels and C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation in the cells (Fig. 2C) , and found the expression of CDK2 and CCSP1 and C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation displayed similar changes-a decrease after treatment of LPS, with significant differences between the LPS treated groups and the cell groups (P < 0.05); PLA2 was increased by LPS treatment, significant difference found at 24 and 48 h (P < 0.05).

In addition, the expression of PLA2 was significantly increased in the ALI model, which was negatively correlated with the expression of CDK2 and CCSP1, and the phosphorylation of C/EBP \u03b2.These findings hinted that the increase in the expression of CDK2, and CCSP1, and the phosphorylation of C/EBP \u03b2, and the decrease in PLA2 may have a positive impact on ALI.",

At the same time, we also overexpressed and depleted CCSP1 to observe the effect on C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation, which would help us to ascertain the relation between C/EBP \u03b2 and CCSP1. The results (Fig. 3) indicate that CDK2 overexpression increased both C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation and C-CSP1 expression (P < 0.05 vs cell control) while CDK2 knockdown suppressed both C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation and CCSP1 expression (P < 0.05 vs cell control).

We infected BEAS-2B cells with these lentiviruses and overexpressed CDK2, and then qualified CCSP1 mRNA to verify the predicted binding site of C/EBP \u03b2. The results (Fig. 4A) show that infection of Lv-wPro-CCSP1 or Lv-mPro-CCSP1 increased CCSP1 mRNA (P < 0.05 vs control). In comparison with infection of Lv-wPro-CCSP1 alone, co-infection with Lv-CDK2 increased CCSP1 mRNA, and co-infection with Lv-shRNA-CDK2 impaired the increase (P < 0.05). The co-infection with Lv-CDK2 or Lv-shRNA-CDK2 did not change CCSP1 mRNA in the cells infected with Lv-mPro-CCSP1 (P > 0.05). All these data suggest that C/EBP \u03b2 regulates the transcription of CCSP1 through the predicted binding site. We further verified the binding by using CHIP-PCR (Fig. 4B ). In the BEAS-2B cells infected with Lv-wPro-CCSP1, C/EBP \u03b2 bound to more DNA fragments around the binding site in CCSP1 promoter (P < 0.05 vs Lv-control), and in the cells infected with Lv-mPro-CCSP1, no difference was observed (P > 0.05).

The results (Fig. 5A) show that CDK2 overexpression attenuated LPS-induced increase of PLA2 protein (P < 0.05 vs LPS group), indicating that overexpression of CDK2, or C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation, could significantly inhibit PLA2 expression in the in vitro ALI model. Knockdown of C/EBP \u03b2 or CCSP1 impaired the inhibition of PLA2 expression by CDK2 overexpression (P < 0.05 vs LPS + Lv-CDK2), indicating in the in vitro ALI model, there was a specific C/EBP \u03b2/CCSP1/PLA2 pathway. To illustrate the effect of C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation on membrane phospholipid damage in the in vitro ALI model, we treated BEAS-2B cells which overexpressed or were depleted with CDK2 with LPS for 48 h and assessed PAF and AA by ELISA. The data (Fig. 5B) show that CDK2 overexpression inhibited the release of PAF and AA induced by LPS (P < 0.05), while the contents of PAF and AA in the group of CDK silencing and LPS induction were slightly higher than that in the LPS group (P > 0.05). No change in PAF or AA was found in the Lv-NC group (P > 0.05 vs LPS group). In conclusion, we believe that the phosphorylation of C/EBP \u03b2 can promote the transcription of CCSP1 and subsequently inhibit the expression of PLA2 and then resist the disruption of phospholipids caused by ALI.",

To verify the existence of C/EBP \u03b2/CCSP1/PLA2 pathway, we analyzed the relation between C/EBP \u03b2 and CCSP1 gene. The experiment revealed that C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation or dephosphorylation could enhance or suppress CCSP1 transcription but overexpression or knockdown of CCSP1 had no effect on C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation, hinting at CCSP1 being downstream C/EBP \u03b2. We next employed co-infection and CHIP-PCR to verify the binding site of C/EBP \u03b2 in CCSP1 promoter predicted by bioinformatics. Quantitative determination of CCSP1 mRNA shows that C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation enhanced CCSP1 transcription controlled by the wild promoter but not that controlled by the promoter with binding site mutation, and dephosphorylation of C/EBP \u03b2 only inhibited CCSP1 transcription controlled by the wild promoter. CHIP-PCR results show that C/EBP \u03b2 was capable of binding to the promoter DNA carrying the wild binding site but not the one carrying mutant binding site. However, though endogenous CCSP1 promoter is at a low level in CHIP-PCR experiments, it may have a certain inference on the experimental data. Therefore, we employed the luciferase reporter assay to verify the results of CHIP-PCR. The results indicated that overexpression of C/EBP \u03b2 significantly increased the luciferase controlled by wild type CCSP1 promoter, but had no obvious effect on that controlled by the CCSP1 promoter with a mutant binding site. Eliminating the background impact, these data demonstrated that the transcription factor can bind to CCSP1 promoter through the predicted site and activate the transcription.",

LPS stimulation inhibits the phosphorylation of C/EBP \u03b2 in BEAS-2B cells, suppresses the C/EBP \u03b2/CCSP1/PLA2 pathway, and increases the expression of PLA2 protein, leading to membrane injury. Since CCSP1 is an endogenous inhibitor of PLA2, we tried to inhibit the damage of membrane in the in vitro ALI model through regulating PLA2 via C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation. To regulate phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of C/EBP \u03b2, we overexpressed or silenced its upstream kinase CDK2, which is proved to be an effective means to phosphorylate or dephosphorylate C/EBP \u03b2 by the experimental data. The findings suggest that overexpression of CDK2 suppressed LPS-induced increase of PLA2 in the cells via the C/EBP \u03b2/CCSP1/PLA2 pathway, and inhibited the release of PAF and AA, a clear inhibition of membrane phospholipid damage in the in vitro ALI model. These findings are promising, since it is of significance to the treatment of ALI that increase of C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation could inhibit PLA2 expression and membrane injury in ALI. The results indicate that C/EBP \u03b2 is a potential target for ALI treatment. However, we also have some urgent work for the future. For example, what is the mechanism by which LPS stimulation inhibits the phosphorylation of C/EBP \u03b2, and is there some approach that regulates the phosphorylation of C/EBP \u03b2 in a more effective, more direct and specific way? The experimental strategy of increasing C/EBP \u03b2 phosphorylation by CDK2 overexpression is obviously not suitable for clinical application.
