Other countries fostered this new paradigm after the ensuing terrorist events in Spain on March 11, 2004 and then in the UK on July 7, 2005 . These actions diverted the attention of public health authorities to bioterrorism preparedness activities, shifting many resources (human and financial) from existing public health priorities. Many considered that chasing the chimera of the unforeseen consequences of bioterrorism was a misallocation of public health resources.",

Indeed, it has provided a window of opportunity to define some structures and processes that can withstand the test of time in dealing with epidemics and pandemics of emerging infections including pandemic influenza (1) . Some of these benefits were evident during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003e2004 when a recently developed network of international reference laboratories collaborated to identify the SARS-associated coronavirus in a timely manner; and many countries activated their emergency preparedness response plans relying on international epidemiologic surveillance networks (2e3). This opened a new area of unprecedented collaboration among scientists, epidemiologists, and policy-makers in the present globalized world. In a similar fashion, many countries including Mexico were in a more suitable vigilance position and international collaboration efforts to effectively respond to the emergence of the novel swine-related influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in 2009 (3).",

Nowadays, while intentional bioterrorism continues to represents a minor threat, influenza pandemics carry a constant menace to humans due to the capricious biological behavior of these highly unstable viruses from a genomic perspective. This risk is amplified by the constant reservoir of influenza strains in wild birds with different combinations of hemagglutinin and neuraminidase protein combinations in wild birds. These potential emerging influenza strains can benefit from some aspects of modernity such as travel and high-population densities ubiquitous in many settings (6e7). In this manner, there is a dynamic and relentless evolutionary struggle between humans and influenza viruses demanding a permanently and proactive revision and strengthening of influenza pandemic preparedness and response plans.",

Viruses that contain surface glycoproteins to human populations that are immunologically na\u00efve to these strains are responsible for influenza pandemics. Such genomic segments can be introduced into human populations through genetic reassortment between human and avian viral strains or through the direct cross-transfer of an avian influenza virus to humans (9) . Regretfully, given this large reservoir of antigen types for reassortment, the possibility of pandemic influenza could emerge from any part of the world at any time (10e11). This is a critical issue frequently forgotten by leading international public health agencies and the reason why it remains crucial to scale-up international networks for surveillance, laboratory detection, and collective international responses. The recent human and economic burden caused by a new strain of the H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza and the current pandemic caused by the novel H1N1 strain both underscore the continued danger posed by the uncontrolled spread of zoonotic disease. In each case, failure to either effectively anticipate the outbreaks or to coordinate an immediate, integrated, and effective response after they jumped species and infected humans suggests that much work remains to mitigate the risks emerging infectious diseases pose to human health and economic livelihoods, especially in developing countries (11e12).",

Currently, only the first two of these pandemic requirements have been met by highly pathogenic influenza A (H5N1). Despite the significant international attention paid to influenza A (H5N1), this particular type of influenza virus has clearly met only the first two criteria for causing a pandemic (high mortality and the absence of widespread immunity).

Whereas the media and many scientists focused their attention during the last few years to outbreaks of H5N1 in different countries, the current pandemic demonstrates that we can never be sufficiently prepared for the sudden and unexpected emergence of novel influenza strains (2e3,6). Pandemic influenza A (H1N1) continues to be the predominant circulating strain of influenza in most countries with influenza activity with widespread outbreaks in some parts of North America, Europe and Asia (15e17).

In this regard, we need to focus our planning and response efforts on those interventions that are critical during the early phases of a pandemic where there is no availability of a specific pandemic vaccine (2, 19) . In particular, those related to nonpharmacologic measures such as social distancing measures (isolation and quarantine; school closing and prohibiting mass gatherings). There is great historical value of nonpharmacological interventions with immediate applicability (11,19e20) . Nonetheless, further evidence-based data need to be collected in order to optimize decision-making ability of policymakers in terms of the efficacy of social distancing measures (2e3).",

Additionally, there is an urgent need to have better detection methods for influenza viruses including the creation or strengthening and scaling-up of laboratory capacity for influenza diagnosis in most settings (low-, middle-, and high-income countries) through international networks of collaboration, technology transfer, and capacity-building efforts (2) .",
