Many cats have concurrent feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) infection. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is often the most useful test to confirm the diagnosis and typical findings include a dramatic elevation in protein concentration in the presence of non-septic inflammation with a large number of neutrophils, macrophages and lymphocytes. 3 The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features may also be highly suggestive, comprising obstructive hydrocephalus and marked contrast enhancement of post-gadolinium T1-weighted MRI scans around the third ventricle, mesencephalic aqueduct and brainstem (Figs 5 and 6 ). The risk of brain herniation is significant in these cases (Fig 6) and care should be taken when anaesthetising them or performing a CSF tap.

The function of the vestibular system with regard to vision is to maintain the visual image in a steady position on the retina in response to movements of the head. This is achieved by inducing eye movements (termed nystagmus), via the vestibulo-ocular reflex, that are equal to, but in the opposite direction to, the head movements. In contrast to the vestibular system, the saccadic system functions to change the line of sight to focus a new visual stimulus on the retinal region with the highest visual acuity. Saccadic eye movements occur in response to startle reflexes (sudden visual and auditory stimuli) and during the fast phase eye movements of the vestibulo-ocular reflex.",

When the head is moved from side to side or up and down at a steady rate without the gaze being fixed on a single object, a nystagmus (also termed physiological nystagmus) is induced, with the fast phase movements of the eyeball occurring in the direction of the head movement. Physiological nystagmus should stop once the head movement stops. An exception to this is where the head movement continues for a prolonged period in the same direction and at a constant speed (eg, as a result of being spun on a revolving chair); in this situation the vestibular system has time to adapt, and the physiological nystagmus stops during the constant movement but briefly restarts when the speed or direction of movement changes or is stopped.",

Owners need to be warned that the clinical signs related to the vestibular dysfunction may temporarily deteriorate post anaesthesia. Otitis media/interna is usually initially treated with antibiotics. The prognosis is generally good with a prolonged course of appropriate oral and topical antibiotics, selected on the basis of bacterial culture results. Where culture and sensitivity results are not available then empirical antibiotic treatment is usually attempted. Suitable choices include cefalexin (20-25 mg/kg PO BID) and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (20 mg/kg BID) for 4-6 weeks. If there is evidence of keratoconjunctivitis sicca then additional use of artificial tears and ocular lubricants is recommended. In advanced cases, or where medical treatment is not successful, surgical drainage of the middle ear via a ventral bulla osteotomy may be required.",
