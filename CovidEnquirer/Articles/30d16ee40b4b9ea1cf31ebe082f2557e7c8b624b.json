            "text": "H uman metapneumovirus (HMPV), discovered in the Netherlands in 2001, has been increasingly recognized as a major cause of lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in young children worldwide. [1] [2] [3] [4] This virus is detected in 5%-16% of children with an LRTI in the community, emergency room, and hospital settings, occurring in seasonal peaks with variable year-to-year activity. 1- 6 The clinical features of HMPV infection closely resemble those of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Although the association between HMPV and bronchiolitis has been well documented, the extent of involvement of HMPV in pneumonia has not been assessed directly. Alveolar pneumonia is often considered a bacterial infection, with pneumococcus the leading pathogen in all age groups. 7, 8 But using the pneumococcal vaccine as an epidemiologic probe, Madhi et al 9 recently demonstrated that the 9-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine substantially prevented viral-associated pneumonia. A subsequent analysis specifically revealed a 58% overall reduction in hospitalization for HMPV-associated clinical pneumonia in vaccinated children, 10 suggesting an important involvement of HMPV as a copathogen in pneumonia. These findings provide indirect evidence that childhood pneumonia is commonly a result of Streptococcus pneumoniae and respiratory virus coinfection and suggest the frequent involvement of HMPV in such events. In a preliminary study comparing the clinical presentation of HMPV, RSV, and influenza A infection in young children hospitalized for a wide spectrum of LRTIs over a 1-year period, we found that HMPV infection was more often associated with a diagnosis of pneumonia compared with RSV and influenza A. 11 The objectives of the present study were to determine the involvement of HMPV in radiologically diagnosed CAAP (often considered to have a bacterial etiology), and to compare the demographic, clinical, and laboratory features of children with HMPV-associated CAAP and children with CAAP associated with other respiratory viruses.",

The specimens were diluted with 4 mL of RPMI culture medium (Kibbutz Beit Haemek, Israel). Three mL of sample was studied for the presence of RSV, influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza viruses, and adenovirus by direct immunofluorescence assay (DFA), using commercial monoclonal antibodies (Chemicon, Temecula, California), and by tissue culture, as described previously. 11 A second DFA was performed after 10 days of culture incubation. Thus, the final virologic results for all viruses (except HMPV) consisted of a combination of DFA applied on the initial sample, cytopathic effect as observed in tissue culture, and DFA applied to tissue culture cells. This combination enhanced our detection by $10% compared with DFA testing of the sample alone (data not shown). Residual aliquots were stored at -80 C until analysis for the presence of HMPV by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) at the Clinical Virology Laboratory of the Hadassah University Medical Center in Jerusalem. For HMPV detection, RNA was extracted from 140 mL of sample using the QIAamp Viral RNA Minikit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Then 5 mL of the 60 mL of purified RNA solution was tested in a one-step real-time RT-PCR reaction, using conserved nucleoprotein gene primers and probe as described previously. 13 Statistical Analysis Data were recorded using the Access Microsoft Office software (Microsoft, Redmond, Washington), and statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 14.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois). Univariate analysis was initially used to compare independent risk factors for HMPV-associated CAAP and those for CAAP associated with other respiratory viruses. The univariate analyses used the t-test or one-way ANOVA for quantitative dependent variables and the c 2 test or Fisher exact test for categorical dependent variables, as appropriate. Age is a common confounding variable and here was found to be a significant factor in virus distribution as well as in most potential risk factors tested, along with medical history-related and clinical variables. Thus, THE JOURNAL OF PEDIATRICS www.jpeds.com Vol. 156, No. 1 multivariate analyses were performed for all tested potential risk factors, controlling for age (< 12 months and $ 12 months).

With regard to the extent of inflammatory response, including maximal temperature, CRP level, WBC count, and neutrophil count, children with HMPV did not have unique features compared with children with any other virus tested except adenovirus.
