            "text": "Due to global climate change, the natural water temperature has significantly increased, resulting in decreased dissolved oxygen levels in the past few decades (Dong et al., 2020) . Thus, in aquaculture ponds, high temperature (HT) and low dissolved oxygen (LO) conditions in aquatic systems may co-occur more frequently. Extremely high temperature and low dissolved oxygen would cause thermal stress and hypoxic stress, respectively. These environmental stresses could lead to yield loss and reduce the germplasm quality in the aquaculture industry (Huo et al., 2018) . The sea cucumber Apostichopus japonicus is a deposit feeder that participates in carbon cycling in marine ecosystems (Huo et al., 2019b) . In China, it is an economically important food species raised extensively in the mariculture; for example, the area, yield and quantity of seedlings in the country were 2.2 \u00d7 10 5 hm 2 , 2.1 \u00d7 10 8 kg and 52.8 billion by 2017, respectively (Ministry of Agriculture, 2018). Thermal and hypoxic stresses have been identified as the main causes of massive death of sea cucumbers over the summer in China in recent years, with these stresses negatively impacting of these stresses on the behavioral, physiological, histomorphological and molecular characteristics of A. japonicus (Huo et al., 2019a) . To reduce the damage caused by environmental stress, sophisticated adaptive response mechanisms have been developed by sea cucumbers. The regulation of gene expression occurs at the transcriptional, posttranscriptional and posttranslational levels (Shukla et al., 2008) .",

Due to the recent availability of high-quality genomic information for A. japonicus , research on non-coding RNAs in sea cucumber can now be conducted. Therefore, we obtained lncRNA and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression profiles from respiratory tree of sea cucumbers under thermal stress, hypoxic stress, and combined thermal + hypoxic stress (HL) as well as control treatment conditions (NC) . Respiratory tree was selected as the target tissue in the present study, because it is the major organ responsible for respiratory metabolism in the sea cucumber and is very sensitive to environmental stress . The integrated analysis of the differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs and mRNAs may provide clues to find genes with active roles in stress adaption in sea cucumbers under environmental stress in the context of global climate change. Our results represent the first construction of lncRNA-mRNA coexpression networks and lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks identified by the dualluciferase reporter system in sea cucumbers. The data reported herein provides important information about stress resistance in echinoderms with potential applications to other species in aquaculture.",

Around 50 active sea cucumbers (wet weights: 90-110 g) were then randomly selected and divided into groups. Sea cucumbers from each group were cultivated in separated tanks and exposed to stress for 48 h, and the moment when the water temperature had risen and/or oxygen decreased to the corresponding set value was defined as the treatment start time. For A. japonicus, water with sufficient dissolved oxygen (8 mg/L) and a temperature of 16\u00b0C were suitable for survival, thus this condition was taken as control (NC). Treatment group with low dissolved oxygen (2 mg/L) condition was set as the hypoxia treatment group (LO). The thermal stress treatment group (HT) was maintained at a high temperature of 26\u00b0C and the thermal and hypoxia combined treatment group (HL) was maintained at a high temperature of 26\u00b0C and low dissolved oxygen concentration (2 mg/L). Acclimation was carried out by using a 2-kW heating rod and dissolved oxygen control system, respectively (Huo et al., 2018) . Respiratory trees from nine sea cucumber individuals in each group were sampled promptly and preserved in liquid nitrogen, and stored at \u221280\u00b0C. The sea cucumber (A. japonicus) is not an endangered or a protected species and no permission was needed for sea cucumber collection.",

Subsequently, random hexamer primers were used to synthesize the firststrand cDNA by utilizing RNA fragments as a template. Afterwards, second-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using a buffer, dNTPs, DNA polymerase I and RNase H. Then the library fragments were purified with QIAQuick PCR kits, and eluted with elution buffer (EB). Later on, terminal repair, poly(A) tailing and adapter ligation were implemented. The library fragments were purified with agarose gel electrophoresis to referentially select cDNA fragments of 300 bp in length and the UNG enzyme was used to digest second strand cDNA.

After measuring the RNA concentration of each library by a Qubit\u00ae RNA Assay Kit with a Qubit\u00ae 2.0 instrument, the RNA was diluted to 1 ng/\u03bcl. The insert size was assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA), and the Taqman fluorescence probe of the AB Step One Plus Real-Time PCR system (library valid concentration N 10 nM) was used to quantify the qualified insert size.

The lncRNA-mRNA co-expression network was built by Cytoscape software (Cytoscape Consortium, San Diego, CA, USA) (Shannon et al., 2003) based on the correlation between the DE-lncRNAs and DE-mRNAs. LncRNAs and coding genes were identified based on Pearson's correlation coefficients (equal to or N0.8) for trans-targets or based on the genomic positional relation in 50 kb regions (upstream and downstream) for cis-targets. Based on our previous study, Aja-miR-2013-3p was taken as a key stress-responsive-miRNA connected with lncRNAs and mRNAs in A. japonicus . Hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1\u03b1), a key hypoxia responder, was predicted by RNAhybrid to be one of the targets of Aja-miR-2013-3p. Thus, these two were used for lncRNA binding possibility screening and lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network prediction. All the plasmids used in the present study were custom synthesized by GeneChem Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) (Table S2) and cloned into a GV272 firefly luciferase plasmid (GeneChem). The GV272 empty vector was utilized as a negative control (3\u2032 UTR-NC) (GeneChem), and the multiple cloning sites of it were digested by XbaI/XbaI restriction enzymes. The 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTR) segment of mRNA (HIF-1\u03b1) and lncRNA (MSTRG.93731, MSTRG.10941, MSTRG.34610 and MSTRG.81281) or their mutant was inserted into the vector to yield the 3\u2032 UTR or 3\u2032 UTR-MU. The recombinant products were verified by DNA sequencing, and the group details can be found in Table S2 . Hsa-miR-146b and its target gene TRAF6 were utilized as positive controls (Park et al., 2015) . The pGL3 control vector (Promega) and pRL-TK were used as a firefly luciferase reporter vector and a Renilla luciferase control reporter vector, respectively. PCR amplification of the RNA sequences was performed using a PrimerSTAR Max DNA Polymerase Mix (Takara Bio Inc., Japan). The top 10 competent bacterial cells were transformed with the ligation product of the luciferase reporter vector and the digested PCR fragment. Transformed cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C on LB agar plates with antibiotics overnight, and isolated clones were inoculated in LB medium with antibiotics at 37\u00b0C with shaking overnight. The ZR Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research, Orange, CA, USA) was used for the plasmid DNA purify. All constructs were verified by sequencing (Table S2 ). The transfection and detection of the luciferase activities were performed using Li's method . The human embryonic kidney cell line, HEK 293 T at 90% confluence in 24-well plates was transfected with a 3\u2032 UTR luciferase plasmid (0.1 \u03bcg), a microRNA plasmid (0.4 \u03bcg) and a Renilla plasmid (0.02 \u03bcg) using the X-tremeGENE HP DNA Transfection Reagent (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). The firefly luciferase plasmid and the Aja-miR-2013-3p expression plasmid were co-transfected with a Renilla luciferase vector (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) for normalization. Luciferase activity was measured using a microplate reader (M2009PR, Tecan infinite) after 48 h following the manufacturer's instructions. All experiments were performed in triplicate, and the original data and the normalization method are shown in Table S2 . The analysis methods were the same as those desribed for RT-qPCR, including software, statistical test and figure construction.",

Validation of key DE-lncRNA and DE-mRNA transcripts by RT-qPCR yielded results consistent with the RNA-seq analysis in most cases, thus confirming the reliability of the RNA-seq technique and the high quality of the identified lncRNAs and mRNAs.",

The group interactions without practical meanings or significance were not shown in the figure. Our previous study found several environmental-stress-responsive miRNAs that include Aja-miRNA- 2013-3p , and its predicted binding structure and mature sequence were shown in Fig. 6c . We analyzed the possible targeted mRNAs and lncRNAs, and found that hypoxia-inducible factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1) was a potential target gene, which is a key responder in hypoxia defense. Moreover, binding sites for Aja-miRNA-2013-3p were also found in four lncRNAs (MSTRG.93731, MSTRG.10941, MSTRG.34610 and MSTRG.81281) (Fig. 6b) . Details of information of DLRAS, such as group content, sequences and primary data can be found in Table S2 . Compared with that in the positive control (PC)-miRNA-NC group, the PC-miRNA was significantly downregulated. Thus, the transfection system used in the current study proved to be effective. Compared with the mmi2 group, the mmi4 group showed a significant decrease of over 20% in expression. Thus, Aja-miRNA-2013-3p was proven to suppress the expression of HIF-1\u03b1. Compared with the lmi2 group, the lmi4 and lmi16 groups showed significant decreases of N20% in expression. Moreover, the lmi12 group showed significantly decreased expression levels compared with the expression levels in the lmi2 group, but the difference was only approximately 17%. Thus, Aja-miRNA-2013-3p was proven to bind lncRNAs such as MSTRG.93731, MSTRG.10941 and MSTRG.34610. Under hypoxic stress, the HIF-1\u03b1 gene and MSTRG.10941 showed increased expression levels and could both bind Aja-miR-2013-3p; under thermal stress and combined stress, the HIF-1\u03b1 gene and MSTRG.34610 showed decreased expression levels and could both bind Aja-miR-2013-3p. Therefore, the \"HIF-1\u03b1 gene/ Aja-miR-2013-3p/MSTRG.34610\" network and the \"HIF-1\u03b1 gene/Aja-miR-2013-3p/MSTRG.10941\" network might play important roles in sea cucumbers under environmental stress (Fig. 6) . The relative expression levels of these lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs were compared for the three treatment groups and the NC group, and the results are shown in Fig. S4 (unpublished data).",

Emerging evidence indicates that lncRNAs play crucial roles in many biological processes and contribute to stress resistance. However, the regulatory mechanisms remain unclear, especially in sea cucumber. To date, many lncRNAs have been identified in model animals including human (Wapinski and Chang, 2011) , rat (Wang et al., 2014) , zebrafish (Pauli et al., 2012) , arabidopsis (Liu et al., 2012) , fruit fly (Nyberg and Machado, 2016) , and elegans (Nam and Bartel, 2012) ; they have also been identified in other vertebrates, such as pig (Wang et al., 2016) and chicken (Li et al., 2012) ; and other marine animals, such as oyster (Feng et al., 2018) and salmon (Valenzuela-Miranda and Gallardo-Esc\u00e1rate, 2016). However, information concerning the systematic identification and function of lncRNAs in marine invertebrates remains lacking, especially for echinoderms. A. japonicus is a good model holothurian species, because of its economic and ecological value. LncRNAs of A. japonicus have fewer exons and shorter transcripts in length compared with mRNAs, and these results are in agreement with those of previous studies examining pig (Wang et al., 2016) , rat (Wang et al., 2014) and oyster (Feng et al., 2018) . With the absence of lncRNA data for other holothurians, the conservation of lncRNAs is difficult to properly evaluate in sea cucumbers. Delightfully, recent advances in sea cucumber genome sequencing have resulted in the identification of novel lncRNAs in A. japonicus and the exploration of novel regulatory pathways in different situations .",

Although the functions of most lncRNAs in A. japonicus are not yet clear, evidence suggests that lncRNAs can regulate protein-coding gene expression in organisms through cis-acting mechanisms or trans-acting mechanisms (Han et al., 2012) . Thus, we constructed a coexpression network joint by lncRNAs and their target mRNAs and explored potential lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks, which may play crucial roles in A. japonicus exposed to adverse environmental stress. As a key modulator of most oxygen-limitation responses, HIF-1\u03b1 has received extensive attention in hypoxiarelated studies. Aja-miRNA-2013-3p was reported to be important in sea cucumbers coping with hypoxic stress . The luciferase assay results showed that Aja-miRNA-2013-3p was able to bind to the HIF-1\u03b1 gene, and so were lncRNAs, such as MSTRG.93731, MSTRG.10941 and MSTRG.34610. For example, under hypoxic conditions, Aja-miRNA-2013-3p was downregulated, but the HIF-1\u03b1 gene and MSTRG.10941 were upregulated under hypoxic stress . This might be explained by a competent relationship between the HIF-1\u03b1 gene and MSTRG.10941 binding to Aja-miRNA-2013-3p. However, no reported function was found for the novel lncRNAs mentioned above. Future studies of the regulatory mechanisms of coding and non-coding genes are needed.",

In vertebrates, emerging evidence suggests that lncRNAs are expressed in a highly lineage-specific manner and play an important role in Table 3 KEGG pathways analysis of differentially expressed mRNAs and lncRNAs in sea cucumbers under environmental stresses. immune regulation (Chen et al., 2017 ). The complement system is an essential immune response in invertebrates (Mastellos and Lambris, 2002) . In the present study, thermal stress and hypoxic stress lead to the up-regulation of complement factor B, indicating mediation of the alternative pathway. In addition, the complement component C3 was also found to be induced in sea cucumbers under environmental stress in our previous study (Huo et al., 2019b) . Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are widely viewed as a bioindicator of thermal stress in A. japonicus. HSPs can stimulate the immune system (Yang et al., 2010a) and were reported to be related to apoptosis (Roberts et al., 2010) and protein degradation (Nelson et al., 1992) . The expression of HSPs was more sensitive to thermal stress than to hypoxic stress, possibly because it is easier to induce protein denaturation during thermal stress than during hypoxic stress.",

To our knowledge, the present study represents the first comprehensive analysis of the lncRNA-mRNA co-expression networks and the validation of lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA networks in the response of marine organisms towards individual and combined influences of heat and hypoxia. Although this study was still limited by the absence of a lncRNA database for marine organisms, the identification and annotation of the putative lncRNAs provide a basis for the further clarification of the mechanisms underlying the regulation of mRNAs expression by lncRNAs in the environmental stress response of invertebrates. In future research, overexpression, CRISPR-Cas9 and RNA interference gene silencing strategies in sea cucumbers are expected to be useful for elucidating the specific roles of lncRNAs.Supplementary data to this article can be found online at https://doi. org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.136045.
