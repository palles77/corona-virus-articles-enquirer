Despite significant progress, infectious diseases are still the largest cause of death in the world, and epidemics, caused by emerging and re-emerging infectious organisms, are a serious threat to human health (Heeney, 2006) . Consider these recent examples: the generation and spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, West Nile virus (WNV), and H5N1 avian influenza virus. These infectious diseases can spread quickly because of increased global travel and the export and import of animals that may harbor these viruses (Tapper, 2006) . The world is unprepared for the real threat of naturally occurring outbreaks or intentional virus release as a deadly bioweapon. For combating emerging viruses, as well as drug-resistant mutants of viruses for which effective treatments exist, continued and increased vigilance will be required, including the development of new broad-spectrum therapies.",

There is a great need for the development of compounds that have therapeutic efficacy in treating diseases caused by highly pathogenic RNA viruses (Bray, 2008) . For the treatment of influenza-type illnesses, M2-channel inhibitor, amantadine and neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir or zanamivir exist as therapeutic drugs. However, with the exception of ribavirin, few approved drugs are available for other RNA virus infections. This is especially true for several types of viral hemorrhagic fever (Gowen and Holbrook, 2008) . Application of ribavirin for the treatment of such severe infections has not become widespread because of concerns regarding adverse effects and lack of specificity and efficacy (Kilgore et al., 1997; McCormick et al., 1986; Monath, 2008) .",

T-705, T-1106 and T-1105 were discovered and synthesized by Toyama Chemical Co., Ltd. Their structures are shown in Fig. 1 . Through the screening of a chemical library of Toyama Chemical Co., Ltd. using a plaque reduction assay for antiviral activity against influenza virus A/PR/8/34, a lead compound, which was afterwards designated as T-1105, was found to be effective. Thereafter, its derivatives were synthesized to evaluate structure-activity studies in terms of in vitro and in vivo antiviral activities as well as pharmacokinetic properties. T-705 and the related compounds were then selected for further investigation as drug candidates. ",

The antiviral activities of T-705 against influenza A (H5N1) virus as well as an oseltamivir-resistant virus were determined in yield reduction assays in MDCK cells (Furuta et al., 2002) . The EC 90 values that were effective against influenza A (H5N1) ranged from 1.3 to 7.7 M, which is similar to effective concentrations against seasonal influenza viruses. Oseltamivir showed an anti-influenza viral activity at low concentrations except in C type and oseltamivir-resistant strains. Ribavirin also showed activity, but its potency was 14 times less effective than T-705, depending on the strain.",

Initial studies in PICV-infected hamsters established an effective daily dose of 30 mg/kg/day if 7-day twice-daily treatment was initiated within 4 h after infection (Table 4 ). When treatment was begun 1-3 days after challenge, a dose of 50 mg/kg/day was effective, suggesting that higher doses were needed to effectively control the infection (Gowen et al., 2007) . Recently, significant protection was achieved by employing a high-dose regimen, in which a loading dose was used to knock down the marked viral burden present when treatment was delayed until day 7 . Twice-daily doses at 320 mg/kg were given on either day 6 or 7, followed by 7 days of twice-daily doses of 100 mg/kg (Fig. 3) . Notably, PICV-infected hamsters normally begin to succumb on day 8 of infection, and peak serum and tissue viral burden is present in most animals by day 7, underscoring the significance of these findings.",

There are insufficient data to clarify the reason why the in vivo antiviral effect of T-1106 did not correspond to its in vitro activity and why there were such differences in antiviral activities between T-1106 and T-705.

It generally takes about 7 days for vaccination to elicit protective antibodies (Doel, 1996) . To compensate for this disadvantage of FMD vaccines, new control methods that exhibit prompt effectiveness must be developed. Therefore, an antiviral agent can be one of several powerful tools to reduce the expansion of FMD out- breaks, thus providing additional means of controlling the spread of the disease.",

T-1105 was administered by feed to four pigs at a dose of 200 mg/kg twice daily for 6 days beginning 1 h prior to FMDV inoculation (Sakamoto et al., 2006) . The animals in the control group showed typical signs of FMD, such as fever, vesicles on their feet and lameness, but no clinical signs of FMD were observed in T-1105-treated pigs throughout the experiment. Viremia was effectively reduced to below the levels of detection and the increase of anti-FMD antibody titers was suppressed after T-1105 treatment, suggesting that the virus replication was effectively inhibited by this compound in the infected pigs.",

It is noteworthy that T-705 inhibits viral replication without influencing synthesis of cellular DNA and RNA (Furuta et al., 2005) . The high error rate of RNA polymerase is considered to be one of the strategies executed by RNA viruses to escape the host immune response, and false recognition of nucleotides by the viral polymerase might occur more frequently, as compared to the host RNA polymerase (Day et al., 2005; Leyssen et al., 2006) .",

For example, the following questions remain to be clarified. Does T-705 suppress enzyme function by binding to enzyme molecules? Does it incorporate into nascent viral RNA during the replication process? Does it suppress the translation of viral proteins? Is it a viral mutagen like ribavirin? In addition, we tried to obtain a T-705-resistant strain through serial passage of influenza A/PR/8/34 (H1N1), but resistant viruses could not be isolated after 30 passages (unpublished data). Although the inability to develop drug resistance is clearly advantageous, it makes analyzing the mechanism of action at the molecular level difficult.",

For example, the antiviral activity of T-705 against influenza A/WSN/33 was higher than that of T-1106 in MDCK cells, but their antiviral potencies were reversed in MDBK cells (unpublished data). Since it is presumed that these compounds are converted to their active ribofuranosyltriphosphate forms by cellular enzymes, antiviral activity would be greatly affected by the uptake of the parent compounds into host cells and/or the conversion rates to active forms. These are important points to consider when we estimate the therapeutic efficacy of these compounds in various viral diseases.

For example, non-clinical pharmacokinetic studies revealed that the plasma levels of T-705 after oral administration rose in a dose-dependent manner with high linearity, and the oral bioavailability in mice was almost 100%, as compared to intravenous administration. In addition, no serious adverse events have been reported in the clinical studies, suggesting that T-705 is well tolerated in humans. These data will help us to consider the possibility of T-705 as a novel antiviral drug against various RNA viral infections. The first indication for T-705 is influenza, but in our development plan hereafter it is necessary also to consider other diseases caused by medically important viruses such as Lassa, Junin, WNV and YFV for T-705 and T-1106. Regarding the development of T-1105, to elucidate its effectiveness as a powerful tool to control FMD in pigs, more large-scale experiments are expected using an infection model of FMDV. In conclusion, the pyrazinecarboxamide derivatives appear to be promising tools to satisfy unmet needs for treating highly pathogenic RNA viral infections.
