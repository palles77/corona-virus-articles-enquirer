Porcine circovirus-associated disease (PCVAD), including porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome, is a worldwide swine disease. To date, little is known concerning the relationship between OTA and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), the primary causative agent of PCVAD. The effects of OTA on PCV2 replication and their mechanisms were investigated in vitro and in vivo. The results in vitro showed that low doses of OTA significantly increased PCV2 DNA copies and the number of infected cells.",

The results in vivo showed that PCV2 replication was significantly increased in serum and tissues of pigs fed 75 \u03bcg/kg OTA compared with the control group and pigs fed 150 \u03bcg/kg OTA. In addition, low doses of OTA significantly depleted reduced glutathione and mRNA expression of NF-E2-related factor 2 and \u03b3-glutamylcysteine synthetase; increased reactive oxygen species, oxidants, and malondialdehyde; and induced p38 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in PK15 cells. Adding N-acetyl-L-cysteine reversed the changes induced by OTA. Knockdown of p38 and ERK1/2 by their respective specific siRNAs or inhibition of p38 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation by their respective inhibitors (SB203580 and U0126) eliminated the increase in PCV2 replication induced by OTA. These data indicate that low doses of OTA promoted PCV2 replication in vitro and in vivo via the oxidative stress-mediated p38/ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathway. This suggests that low doses of OTA are potentially harmful to animals, as they enhance virus replication, and partly explains why the morbidity and severity of PCVAD vary significantly in different pig farms.",

According to the American Association of Swine Veterinarians, PCVAD can be subclinical or can include one or more clinical manifestations, including multisystemic disease with weight loss and high mortality, respiratory disease, porcine dermatologic and nephropathy syndrome, enteric signs including diarrhea, and reproductive disorders on an individual or herd basis [25] [26] [27] . However, not all pigs infected with PCV2 will develop PCVAD, and the severity levels differ in different pig farms. PCVAD development has been linked to animal management, presence of concurrent viral infections, stimulation of the immune system, and nutrition [28, 29] , suggesting that other trigger factors are associated with the disease. Our previous study indicated that oxidative stress enhanced PCV2 replication in vitro [30] , which may partly explain the differences in morbidity and severity of PCVAD in pig farms. However, to date, the reason PCV2 infection is very common but PCVAD occurrence is variable between pig farms remains unresolved.",

To address this question we assessed the effects of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on PCV2 replication, oxidative stress, and p38 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation. As shown in Fig. 9 , we found that NAC could significantly decrease the number of PCV2 DNA copies (Fig. 9A ) and the number of infected cells (Fig. 9B) , compared with the control group. In addition, NAC abrogated the effects of OTA on PCV2 replication. OTA decreased the mRNA expression of Nrf2, \u03b3-GCS(H), and \u03b3-GCS(L) (Fig. 9C ) and GSH levels (Fig. 9D ) and increased ROS (Fig. 9D ) and oxidant levels ( Fig. 9E ) in PCV2-infected PK15 cells. However, NAC reversed the changes induced by OTA. NAC did not abolish the effects of OTA on the expression of p38 and ERK1/2, but on their phosphorylation (Fig. 9F) . These results indicate that the mechanism by which OTA promotes PCV2 replication may be through an oxidative stressmediated p38 and ERK1/2 signaling pathway.",

After 5 h of transfection treatment, the medium was removed, and fresh basal medium and OTA were added for a 48-h culture. As shown in Fig. 12 , a significant decrease in PCV2 DNA copies (Fig. 12A ) and the number of infected PK15 cells (Fig. 12B) treated with the p38 or ERK siRNA without or with OTA was observed compared with the control or OTA group, respectively.

It is also known that PCV2 infection is very common, but the morbidity and severity of PCVAD vary in different pig farms. The present work is the first to investigate the relationship between OTA concentration and PCV2 replication in vitro and in vivo. The in vitro data show that an increase in PCV2 replication is induced by low doses of OTA in PK15 cells. To verify the results in vitro, we used PCV2-positive infected pigs as models and found that a low dose of OTA could increase PCV2 replication in the blood and tissues of pigs, but a relatively high dose could not. The OTA concentrations that promoted PCV2 replication in blood and tissues were consistent with those in PK15 cells. Thus, we investigated the mechanism of OTA promotion of PCV2 replication in PK15 cells as an in vitro model and found that OTA affects PCV2 replication through oxidative stress-mediated p38 and ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathways. The work indicates that OTA may act as an important trigger for PCV2 infection, which could partly explain why the morbidity and severity of PCVAD vary between pig farms. In addition, the results suggest that low doses of OTA may be harmful to animals by enhancing replication of the virus.",

In contrast, at OTA concentrations of 0.01-0.5 \u03bcg/ml, no cytotoxicity was observed, but PCV2 replication was significantly enhanced, particularly at 0.05 \u03bcg/ml. Therefore, the promotion of PCV2 replication induced by low doses of OTA seems specific and unrelated to cell toxicity. However, we found that OTA at 1.0 \u03bcg/ml lowered cell viability and caused no significant increase in PCV2 replication. We speculate that the effects of different OTA concentrations are related to both the association of the extent of PCV2 replication with oxidative stress and the cell's physiological state. It is known that virus replication requires a cell to be in a good physiological state. When a cell's physiological state is not affected by OTA, oxidative stress could promote virus replication, but when the cell's physiological state is lowered by OTA, although OTA could induce oxidative stress, it could not promote PCV2 replication.",

            "text": "In the present experiment in vivo, diets containing 75 and 150 \u03bcg OTA/kg were used to feed pigs for 42 days. The lower level was higher than the recommended dose limits of 50 \u03bcg OTA/kg set by the European Commission [47] and lower than the recommended dose limits of 100 \u03bcg OTA/kg set by China [48] , whereas the higher level was higher than the recommended dose limits set by both the European Commission and China. However, both levels were much lower than those used in many studies that have investigated the effects of OTA on pigs [49, 50] . It has been reported previously that OTA depressed appetite and reduced growth rate, but these effects were usually observed with feed contamination levels of OTA higher than 200 \u03bcg/kg. Previous works have indicated that pigs fed a contaminated diet at 800 \u03bcg OTA/kg presented with a significant reduction in weight gain after 1 year [51] . The diets containing 75 and 150 \u03bcg OTA/kg used in the present study have a relatively low OTA content, consistent with our finding that low doses of OTA were better than higher doses in promoting PCV2 replication in vitro, and were unlikely to affect appetite or body weight. The present in vivo study showed that a wide distribution of OTA was observed in various pig tissues after OTA treatment, with the tissue distribution in the following order: lung4kidney4BLN4liver4ILN4spleen. Interestingly, this tissue distribution of OTA was different from that observed in both pigs [52] and rats treated with 0.2 mg/kg bw, but was similar to the results of the tissue distribution of OTA in rats treated with the lower dose of 0.1 mg/kg bw [40] . The response of tissues to OTA has been linked to a number of factors, such as the length of feeding exposure, the dose, and the type of feed contamination. The ranges of OTA concentrations were 0.27-0.47 \u03bcg/ml in serum and 0.05-0.11 \u03bcg/g in tissues of the 75 \u03bcg/kg OTA treatment group and 0.40-0.69 \u03bcg/ml in serum and 0.08-0.16 \u03bcg/g in tissues of the 150 \u03bcg/kg OTA treatment group, which was consistent with the concentration that produced the promotional effects of OTA on PCV2 replication in the in vitro experiment. Essentially, OTA increased PCV2 DNA copies in tissues such as the kidney, spleen, and lung of pigs treated with 75 \u03bcg/kg OTA and in BLN of pigs treated with 75 and 150 \u03bcg/kg OTA. The same effect was found only on day 42 in the serum of pigs treated with 75 \u03bcg/kg OTA. The PCV2 replication promotion induced by OTA in tissues was greater than that in serum, which may be because OTA concentrations in tissues were much lower than they were in serum. Overall, the results in vivo were largely consistent with the in vitro data indicating that low doses of OTA promote PCV2 replication but high doses of OTA do not. Overall, the results in vitro and in vivo suggest that OTA increases PCV2 replication, which may then trigger PCVAD development. The severity of PCVAD has increased in recent years in China, resulting in significant economic losses in the swine industry. PCV2 is the major swine pathogen associated with PCVAD. Genetic variation among PCV2 isolates has been reported in recent years, which could enhance virulence and pathogenicity of the virus [53, 54] . To assess whether OTA could cause PCV2 mutation, the entire PCV2 gene was cloned and sequenced in different treatments in the present study. The results showed that treatments with 75 or 150 \u03bcg/kg of OTA in the diet resulted in base changes, but did not result in amino acid changes. Thus, OTA treatment did not enhance the virulence of the virus in pigs, although OTA could increase PCV2 replication.",

            "text": "It has previously been reported that OTA treatment increases production of ROS and MDA and leads to depletion of GSH [31, 55] . In addition, oxidative stress was reported to increase virus replication [30, 56] . In the present study, 0.01-0.5 \u03bcg/ml OTA significantly decreased GSH levels and increased ROS, oxidants, and MDA levels in PK15 cells with or without PCV2 infection. However, this effect is not dose-dependent. Cells exposed to higher concentrations of OTA (0.1 and 0.5 \u03bcg/ml) had a smaller fall in GSH than cells exposed to lower concentrations (0.01 and 0.05 \u03bcg/ml), and 0.05 \u03bcg/ml OTA had the maximum fall in GSH. It has also been reported that GSH depletion induced by buthionine sulfoximine showed a non-dose-dependent effect [60] . GSH synthesis is a twostep enzymatic reaction. First, in the rate-limiting step, \u03b3glutamylcysteine (\u03b3-GC), which is regulated by Nrf2 [57] , is formed by the action of glutamate-cysteine ligase. Second, \u03b3-GC is coupled with glycine by the action of GSH synthetase [58, 59] . We determined the mRNA levels of GSH pathway genes such as Nrf2 and \u03b3-GCS (H and L) and found that there were higher mRNA levels of Nrf2 and \u03b3-GCS at 0.1 and 0.5 \u03bcg/ml OTA than at 0.01 and 0.05 \u03bcg/ ml OTA, respectively. We believe that the effects of OTA on ROS, oxidants, and MDA levels may be secondary to the changes in GSH levels in the present study. Such changes in oxidative stress may explain why 0.05 \u03bcg/ml OTA has a maximal promotional effect on PCV2 replication.",

Thus, the antioxidant NAC, a free radical scavenger that is able to elevate GSH levels and decrease ROS levels [61] and inhibit replication of several viruses [62] , was used in the present work. We observed that NAC could prevent Nrf2 and \u03b3-GCS mRNA levels decrease, prevent the GSH depletion, prevent ROS and oxidant production, and prevent PCV2 replication induced by 0.05 \u03bcg/ml OTA. This suggests that NAC could decrease the oxidative stress induced by OTA and thus abrogate the PCV2 replication promotion. These findings are consistent with previous work showing that NAC strongly decreased PCV2 replication in PK15 cells [35] .

            "text": "The present work provides several pieces of evidence that p38 and ERK1/2 are involved in the OTA-mediated promotion of PCV2 replication. First, OTA was found to induce p38 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation in PCV2-infected PK15 cells, consistent with recent observations that OTA can activate p38 and ERK1/2 signaling pathways in human gastric epithelium cells [67] . Second, either the p38 inhibitor SB203580 or the ERK1/2 inhibitor U0126 significantly inhibited PCV2 replication and reversed the PCV2 replication promotion induced by OTA at 0.05 \u03bcg/ml, consistent with previous studies that PCV2 replication in PK15 cells was significantly reduced by either SB202190 or U0126 [65, 66] . Third, the promotion of PCV2 replication induced by OTA was blocked by the p38 siRNA or ERK siRNA. This observation is consistent with an earlier report that p-ERK1/2 and Cap proteins were significantly decreased in PCV2infected PK15 cells transfected with ERK siRNA [38] . Because the present data show that OTA depletes GSH levels, elevates ROS production, and promotes p38 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, we hypothesize that OTA promotes PCV2 replication by altering the p38 and ERK1/2 signaling pathways, inducing oxidative stress. Indeed, we found that supplementation of NAC significantly abrogated the p38 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by OTA at 0.05 \u03bcg/ml. These results indicate that OTA-induced oxidative stress exerts effects on PCV2 replication by activating p38 and ERK1/2 signaling pathways. However, our results do not exclude the possible involvement of other signaling pathways and mechanisms by which OTA promotes PCV2 replication.",

In addition, low doses of OTA increased PCV2 replication by oxidative stress, which, in turn, activated p38 and ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathways in PK15 cells. Thus, our work suggests that OTA may be an important trigger for PCV2 replication and that varying levels of OTA in pig feed may partly explain why the morbidity and severity of PCVAD vary among different pig farms. The observed effects provide a scientific basis for the prevention and control of the prevalence of PCVAD. Moreover, low doses of OTA may still be harmful to animals by enhancing virus replication.",

The results in vivo were largely consistent with the in vitro data indicating that low doses of OTA promote PCV2 replication but relatively high doses of OTA do not. Thus, in subsequent experiments, the mechanisms of OTA promotion of PCV2 replication were studied on PK15 cells. At the end of the experiment, both groups of pigs treated with basal diet plus 75 or 150 \u03bcg/kg OTA had lower final body weights (22.28 70.43 kg, 22.56 70.31 kg), but there were no significant differences compared with control pigs treated with basal diet (23.27 70.36 kg). The virus strains isolated from the tissues of control and OTAtreated pigs were sequenced. As shown in Fig. 5, three strains from three different groups had a genome of 1,767 nt.
