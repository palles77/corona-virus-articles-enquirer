            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a significant emerging infectious disease. Humans infected with the etiological agent , SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) , primarily present with pneumonitis but may also develop hepatic , gastrointestinal, and renal pathology. We inoculated common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) with the objective of developing a small nonhuman primate model of SARS. Two groups of C. jacchus were inoculated intratracheally with cell culture supernatant containing SARS-CoV. In a time course pathogenesis study , animals were evaluated at 2, 4 , and 7 days after infection for morphological changes and evidence of viral replication. All animals developed a multifocal mononuclear cell interstitial pneumonitis , accompanied by multinucleated syncytial cells , edema , and bronchiolitis in most animals. Viral antigen localized primarily to infected alveolar macrophages and type-1 pneumocytes by immunohistochemistry. Viral RNA was detected in all animals from pulmonary tissue extracts obtained at necropsy. Viral RNA was also detected in tracheobronchial lymph node and myocardium , together with inflammatory changes , in some animals. Hepatic inflammation was observed in most animals , predominantly as a multifocal lymphocytic hepatitis accompanied by necrosis of individual hepatocytes. These findings identify the common marmoset as a promising nonhuman primate to study SARS-CoV pathogenesis. (Am J Pathol 2005, 167:455-463) An outbreak of the emerging infectious disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), began in November of 2002 and was eventually contained in July of 2003 by means of an extensive and impressive coordinated worldwide effort to diagnose infected individuals, and to provide care and containment. 1 These efforts involved dedicated clinical caretakers, public health agencies, and research laboratories. By the end of the epidemic there were more than 8000 probable cases of SARS and nearly 800 deaths. 2 Humans with SARS primarily presented with pneumonitis, and mortality was primarily attributed to respiratory failure or related complications. Many studies have documented that other organs were likely involved in significant ways. Initial clinical findings other than pneumonitis in carefully monitored individuals included diarrhea (up to 25% of patients), lymphocytopenia (up to 90% of patients), and abnormal plasma concentrations of liver enzymes (up to 66% of patients). 2 Cardiac failure has been listed as a clinical sign in case reports of unusual presentations. 3, 4 Abnormal urinalyses have been correlated with viral shedding in the urine. 5 The primary functional receptor for SARS-CoV is angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE-2), a metalloproteinase involved in hemodynamic homeostasis. 6 ACE-2 is expressed in a tissue distribution (largely pulmonary and intestinal epithelial cells) that is primarily concordant with histopathology obtained at autopsy of individuals who succumbed to the infection. 7 Human disease is marked primarily by viral shedding from both the respiratory and the gastrointestinal tracts. 5 Viruria, detectable in a significant proportion of infected individuals, suggests that renal tubular epithelial cells expressing ACE-2 are infected. 5, 8 ACE-2 is also expressed at high levels in vascular endothelial cells, a finding that may explain inflammatory changes in other organ systems and vasculitis that is observed in some individuals. 9 Viral RNA has been demonstrated in liver, lymph node, spleen, heart, and skeletal muscle in studies of fatal SARS. 10 Viremia has been detected, albeit inconsistently, 5, 11 and as yet, there has been no report demonstrating infection of vascular endothelial cells.",

Infected animals rarely show clinical signs of disease, and virus concentrations in tissues tend to be relatively low. 14, 15 Other small animals that have proven useful in studies of efficacy of certain interventions include the BALBc mouse, Syrian hamsters, and the ferret. 16 -18 In the murine model, histopathology is minimal despite relatively high viral concentrations in lung tissues, but reliable reductions in viral titers have demonstrated effectiveness of vaccines and neutralizing antibodies. 19 -21 Syrian hamsters develop a consolidative pneumonitis that resolves within 1 week, 16 and ferrets develop a patchy pneumonitis along with hepatitis. 18 These latter two animal models have shown promise in measuring effectiveness of vaccines and therapeutics, and also have been used to evaluate the risk of disease enhancement. 16, 22, 23 Reasoning that a small nonhuman primate model for SARS would be a useful research tool to study pathogenesis, vaccines, and therapeutics, we performed pilot studies on the common marmoset (C. jacchus). We selected this animal for study because of its small size (250 to 400 g), the availability of a large breeding colony, its susceptibility to various human respiratory viruses, and the relative wealth of reagents for immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry, and information regarding its immunology. 24 ",

The mini beadbeater protocol was easily adapted to direct RNA extraction from tissues for even greater sensitivity in detection of viral RNA. Given the culture results of the initial experiment, we focused primarily on viral RNA detection and quantifica-tion in the second experiment. Viral RNA was detected in lung tissue samples from all six animals. Viral RNA concentrations ranged from undetectable (detection thresh- old values ranging from 2500 to 17,000 copies/g of tissue) to more than 70 \u03eb 10 6 copies/g of tissue. Multiple lung samples taken from each animal at necropsy indicated wide variations in viral RNA concentrations in different areas of the lungs (Figure 4) .",

Viral repli-cation was demonstrated in pulmonary tissue through immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR. It should be noted that the pilot experiments undoubtedly underestimated the concentrations of SARS-CoV in tissues and biological specimens.

            "text": "Although pulmonic disease predominated, histological evidence of additional organ system involvement existed for cardiac, lymphoid, and hepatic tissues. Data provided direct evidence that virus was present in lymphoid and cardiac tissues. The presence of inflammation in liver, heart, and bowel suggests that this animal model of SARS shares features of extrapulmonary disease commonly found in humans. 5, 8, 10, 31, 32 In humans, there is generally good concordance between the expression of the primary functional receptor, ACE-2, and SARS-CoV associated pathology or distribution of viral RNA. 7, 32 The presence of inflammation and/or SARS-CoV RNA in a similar tissue distribution in marmosets suggests that ACE-2 expression levels are similar to humans. The importance of L-SIGN, a less efficient, but functional receptor for SARS-CoV, is yet to be defined, but could be studied in this animal model. 33 Hepatic lesions were a conspicuous finding in 11 of 12 animals after inoculation. Elevations of liver enzymes and hepatic lesions have also been described as a clinical entity in human patients infected with the SARS-CoV. 34, 35 Viral RNA has been demonstrated in hepatic tissues of individuals with SARS. 10 Hepatocytes expressing the SARS-CoV N-protein have been demonstrated in fatal cases of SARS. 8 The pattern and early appearance of these lesions in the marmoset suggest that direct viral infection of hepatocytes may play a role. We were unable to demonstrate viral antigen or viral RNA in hepatic tissues using the reagents and techniques available at the time. There is direct evidence that sample inhibition limited our ability to amplify gene products in hepatic tissue RNA extracts. The direct infection of hepatocytes, as yet unproven, remains our leading hypothesis for the hepatitis observed in the SARS-CoV-infected marmosets. This hypothesis will be tested in future studies using different techniques for RNA extraction and gene amplification, and different antibodies for immunohistochemistry in an effort to enhance sensitivity. An alternate hypothesis would be a triggering of a cross-reactive autoimmune response. This is considered less likely given the presence of lesions in 11 of 12 animals and the relative lack of similar inflammatory cell infiltrates in other organs (eg, kidneys). Recently, prominent hepatic lesions were found in a ferret model after vaccination and subsequent SARS-CoV challenge. The greater severity of hepatitis in immunized animals suggested immune enhancement of pathology. 22 Enhanced pathology has been described in other coronavirus infections after repeated exposure, and this has implications in the design of vaccine and therapeutic interventions in SARS. 36 -38 The rapid appearance of a random mononuclear hepatitis in infected marmosets might point toward an innate immune response with infiltrates of NK cells. Such a pattern is observed in mice infected with MCMV with a peak level observed on the second day after infection. 39 However, the expanding pattern of the hepatic lesions through day 7 (the latest time point of these pilot studies) and the presence of cytolytic lymphocytes in aggregates of activated cells expressing HLA-DR would also be consistent with virusspecific recognition by T lymphocytes of infected cells that are scattered in the hepatic parenchyma and lining hepatic veins. The enhancement of SARS-CoV-induced hepatitis in vaccinated ferrets would also be consistent with an earlier and more pronounced accumulation of virus-specific T lymphocytes at sites of virus replication. Additional studies will be required to determine whether pre-existing immunity alters hepatic pathology in marmosets.",

Variability that exists between infected animals may be problematic, but also potentially valuable in defining determinants of disease course. The larger nonhuman primates cannot be tested in sufficiently large numbers to define host characteristics that influence pathogenesis. This small nonhuman primate model will likely be a useful tool to investigate these aspects of pathogenesis. The common marmoset is particularly well suited for defining immunological correlates of disease. 24, 40 In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the common marmoset is susceptible to SARS-CoV infection, and develops disease that shares features with SARS in humans. In the absence of a disease outbreak (as is currently the case for SARS), a nonhuman primate model for pathogenesis and treatment becomes increasingly im-portant. Based on promising preliminary data, we believe that the common marmoset will serve as a useful surrogate system for assessing treatment efficacy. As critical host determinants of pathogenesis are defined in this animal model, their relevance to human disease may be better defined. These types of analyses will enhance our understanding of the disease process, and will allow for efficient testing of vaccines and various treatment modalities in the common marmoset.",
