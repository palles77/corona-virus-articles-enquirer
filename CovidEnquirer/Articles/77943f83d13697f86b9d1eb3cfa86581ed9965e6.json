            "text": "Respect for patient privacy and confidentiality has been affirmed as a professional responsibility of physicians since antiquity. In the famous oath attributed to Hippocrates, ancient Greek physicians pledged to respect confidentiality in these words: ''What I may see or hear in the course of the treatment or even outside of the treatment in regard to the life of men, which on no account one must spread abroad, I will keep to myself, holding such things shameful to be spoken about.'' 1 Privacy and confidentiality are no less significant in Western medicine today, and contemporary medical oaths echo the Hippocratic principle of respect for confidentiality. The World Medical Association's Declaration of Geneva, for example, contains the statement ''I will respect the secrets which are confided in me, even after the patient has died.'' 2 In the United States, a variety of state and federal statutes and common law rules establish legal obligations of physicians to protect patient confidentiality. 3 Potential threats to patient confidentiality from electronic health care transactions were the impetus for US federal regulations recently implemented under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). These regulations require physicians and health care institutions to adopt a variety of new procedures to protect patient information. 4, 5 Privacy and confidentiality also figure prominently in the ''Principles of Ethics for Emergency Physicians,'' part of the Code of Ethics of the American College of Emergency Physicians. Principle 5 states: ''Emergency physicians shall respect patient privacy and disclose confidential information only with consent of the patient or when required by an overriding duty such as the duty to protect others or to obey the law.'' 6 Because respect for privacy and confidentiality is a basic professional responsibility, it is essential that emergency physicians understand how to protect patient interests in the distinctively open setting of the emergency department (ED).",

It is particularly difficult to ensure privacy and confidentiality in the ED because the ED is typically a public, crowded environment in which many people are present, including multiple patients, physicians (attending physicians, consultants, and residents), nurses, emergency medical technicians, students, family, friends, law enforcement officers, and others. Until recently, many EDs recorded patient information on a ''status board'' in plain view of passersby and other patients. 7 Endemic crowding in today's EDs also interferes with protection of privacy and confidentiality. 8, 9 Semiopen wards, congested hallways, and a fishbowl atmosphere provide little or no physical privacy and limited opportunities to communicate personal information confidentially.",

Such sensitive conditions include sexual assault, family violence, sexually transmitted diseases, unwanted pregnancy, suicide attempts, acute psychoses, drug overdoses, and disfiguring trauma, to name but a few. Despite risks to their privacy and confidentiality, however, severely ill or injured patients often have little choice but to accept care in the ED, because they depend on others for transportation and only the ED offers round-the-clock care to all in need. Thus, acutely ill or injured ED patients are highly vulnerable to harmful disclosures and remain at the mercy of their caregivers to protect their confidential information.",

Physical privacy refers to freedom from contact with others or exposure of one's body to others. In contemporary health care, physical privacy is unavoidably limited.

When morally complex situations arise in medicine, physicians typically confront a variety of interests and moral or legal duties that appear to conflict. In response, physicians must engage in careful clinical and moral reasoning. Such reasoning should generally include a clear statement of the problem, collection of relevant information, identification of options for action, comparative evaluation of the options, a decision, action, and assessment of the consequences. In evaluating options for action, physicians must weigh the various reasons (rights, duties, values, interests) for and against different options and choose the option that, all things considered, has the strongest reasons in its favor. Emergency care often requires rapid decisions. Emergency physicians should, therefore, examine potential moral conflicts involving privacy and confidentiality in advance of actual emergency situations and settle on appropriate courses of action for particular circumstances. Using this critical reasoning process, emergency physicians will decide in some situations to protect confidentiality and in others to override it to secure another important value or carry out another important duty.",

Roberts (1881), a Michigan court upheld a couple's interest in physical privacy after a physician allowed an ''unprofessional young, unmarried man'' to enter their home and help deliver their baby. 17 As the right of privacy has evolved in US common law, courts have recognized 4 distinct kinds of invasion of privacy, including ''unreasonable and highly offensive intrusion upon the seclusion of another'' (physical privacy) and ''public disclosure of private facts'' (confidentiality). 18 To succeed in an action for intrusion on a person's ''seclusion,'' the intrusion must be into a private place or matter and must be ''offensive or objectionable to a reasonable person.'' 18 In addition to invasion of privacy, US courts have found physicians liable for unauthorized release of medical information through the concept of a fiduciary duty of confidentiality in the physician-patient relationship. 3 Physicians who reveal a patient's personal information to third parties without appropriate justification may be liable for damages if the patient experiences harm as a result of the disclosure. Breach of confidentiality has also been recognized as a malpractice offense because it violates a professional standard of care. 3 (Other court rulings have established physician duties to disclose medical information in specific circumstances; these exceptions to the legal duty to keep confidentiality will be addressed below.)",

In addition to these more general statutory protections, other statutes create special confidentiality protections for specific conditions. Among the conditions granted such protection are alcohol and drug abuse and HIV-AIDS. 3 Federal statutes also provide protection for health information, including information held by federal agencies, by health care institutions operated by the federal government, and by health care institutions participating in Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal health care programs. 19 ",

Personal health information includes information that relates to a person's physical or mental health, the provision of health care, or the payment for health care. The regulations apply to all health care organizations, including hospitals, physicians' offices, health care plans, employers, public health authorities, life insurers, clearinghouses, billing agencies, information systems, and ''any . person or organization who furnishes, bills or is paid for health care in the normal course of business.'' HIPAA regulations require provision of a written ''notice of privacy practices'' to patients on contact in the ED. This notice must be written in plain language; it must explain who will have access to personal health information and describe patient rights about access, inspection, retrieval, and correction of their health information. The notice must also explain provider duties, grievance procedures, and any anticipated uses or disclosures of patient information.

(4) Caregivers may use and disclose personal health information for 12 ''national priority purposes'' listed in Figure 1 .

''Minimum necessary'' standards do not, however, apply to disclosures to a health care provider for treatment purposes, disclosures to the patient, and disclosures required by law.",

Early in the past century, in cases of infectious disease, a legal duty was ascribed to physicians to warn third parties of dangers of transmission of the disease to them, despite the fact that this disclosure would breach the confidentiality of the patient. [25] [26] [27] [28] A sentinel case, Tarasoff v. the Regents of the University of California, involved the failure of a psychologist and supervising psychiatrist to warn of the danger posed by their patient to a woman whom the patient identified and threatened, who was not the psychiatrist's patient, and who was later murdered by the patient. 29 The holding of this case asserted that the physician has a duty to warn a third party of danger posed by the patient. Other state courts have varied about whether that duty is a duty to warn or a duty to protect and whether the duty owed is to an identified victim or to any ''foreseeable'' victim. The level of risk of harm that engenders the duty to warn has also varied from decision to decision. Nonetheless, the duty to breach confidentiality to warn a potential victim has been established in US common law during the past 30 years.",

A current American Medical Association Code of Ethics opinion opposes mandatory reporting for intimate partner violence on the grounds that the adult victims of domestic violence should retain control over whether and when to report these actions. 38 Similarly, the American College of Emergency Physicians has a policy opposing mandatory reporting of domestic violence to the criminal justice system. 39 Mandatory reporting for conditions such as gunshot wounds may be defended on public health grounds (because society wishes to prevent another injury inflicted by the person who caused the original injury), but are more clearly related to law enforcement goals of capturing and punishing perpetrators of violent crimes.
