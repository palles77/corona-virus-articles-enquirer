Refugee populations are particularly vulnerable to infectious disease outbreaks due to many 12 population and environmental factors. A large measles outbreak, with over 2,500 cases, occurred among 13 the Rohingya population between September and December 2017. Here, we estimate key epidemiological 14 parameters and use a dynamic mathematical model of measles transmission to evaluate the effectiveness 15 of the reactive vaccination campaigns in the refugee camps. We also estimate the potential for subsequent 16 outbreaks under different vaccination coverage scenarios. Our modeling results highlight the success of 17 the vaccination campaigns in rapidly curbing transmission and emphasize the public health importance 18 of maintaining high levels of vaccination in this population, where high birth rates and historically low 19 vaccination coverage rates create suitable conditions for future measles outbreaks.",

Cumulative cases were estimated as the cumulative proportion of the population that moves 117 into the infectious compartment in the SIR framework. Distributions of our estimates for the cumulative number of 118 cases at two years under the different vaccination rate scenarios are presented. To contrast these results with the 119 scenario of the next measles outbreak in the absence of vaccination, the same model used to estimate the size of the 120 2017 outbreak in the absence of vaccination was used with two changes: 1) the total population size was increased to 121 870,534 [1] , and 2) the proportion of the population that was assumed to be susceptible at the start of the outbreak 122 was estimated as su instead of s0 (Table 1) Figure 3 ). Vaccination therefore has the potential to avert between approximately 4,000 and 19,000 cases over two 160 years depending on the coverage rate. Figure 4B shows estimates in terms of boxplots to reflect the uncertainty in 161 our model's results due to parameter uncertainty. . 167 We find that nearly 77,000 cases were averted over the course of one year due to vaccination in the 2017 outbreak.",

The number of reported measles cases reached a peak of 86 incident cases on November 128 18, 2017, followed by a decline in cases (Figure 2A). Current measles transmission appears to be ongoing but limited 129 in the refugee camps, with 323 suspected cases reported from January 1, 2019 to May 4, 2019 [32].130 The daily effective reproductive number ranged from approximately 1.4 (2.5% percentile 1.1 to 97.5% percentile 131 1.7) at the end of the third week of the outbreak to a maximum of 4.3 (2.5% percentile 4.0 to 97.5% percentile 4.8) 132 at the end of the fifth week, or the week ending on October 10, 2017 (Figure 2B). The first measles vaccination 133 campaign conducted in response to the outbreak appears to have been highly successful in curbing the transmission 134 of measles, as the daily effective reproductive number declined shortly after the end of the two-week campaign. The 135 second vaccination campaign, meanwhile, was conducted starting in December, when the daily effective reproductive 136 number was already below 1. By the middle of the 11th week, or mid-November, the effective reproductive number 137 had already dipped below 1. After restricting the maximum estimated basic reproductive number to 20 based on the 138 ranges for R0 commonly reported in the literature [33], the median basic reproductive number is estimated to be 13.the Impact of Vaccination on the 2017 Outbreak 141 If the two vaccination campaigns had not been implemented in response to the 2017 outbreak, our model estimates 142 a median final epidemic size of approximately 79,404 measles cases (standard deviation (sd) of 29,073). This result 143 reflects the high transmissibility of measles, and suggests that after one year from one infectious individual entering 144 the Rohingya population in September 2017, in the absence of interventions, almost all susceptible individuals-or 145 equivalently, approximately 14% of the total population-would have contracted measles. Considering that our model 146 therefore indicates a near 100% attack rate among the susceptible population, the fact that only approximately 2,500 147 cumulative cases occurred from September to the end of December 2017 is a testament to the tremendous success of the 148 vaccination campaigns that were implemented by the WHO, the Bangladesh Ministry of Health, Family and Welfare 149 (MoHFW), and their partners in response to the measles outbreak [9-11].
