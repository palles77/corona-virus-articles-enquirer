For example, one proposed strategy for rapid response to pandemic influenza is to identify the first focus of human-to-human efficient transmission of the H5N1 influenza virus anywhere in the world, then to deploy antivirals to the area within 48 hours. Proponents claim that this strategy may avert pandemic if it is enacted within the recommended time frame; however, there remains great controversy regarding its feasibility given current constraints in comprehensive global disease surveillance. 3 Currently, official notification of international health threats is provided by the World Health Organization (WHO), in partnership with the Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network (GOARN), and supported legally through WHO's promotion of the International Health Regulations. WHO and GOARN utilize a service called the Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN) to scan media articles globally for references to disease outbreaks and epidemics. \u2020 GPHIN is limited, however, by the volume of media material that can be processed in multiple languages. Additional limitations may prevent WHO from detecting and assessing a rapidly spreading epidemic, including the lack of a proper public health infrastructure in the country experiencing an outbreak, the involvement of a previously uncharacterized pathogen, or the WHO Member State's unwillingness to report the event. 1, 4 Unofficial mechanisms also exist for reporting international heath threats, such as ProMED, a not-for-profit organization that relies on volunteers throughout the world who submit information about infectious diseases and surrounding issues. Most of these reports are media articles. In an attempt to display only the most relevant information, all submissions are processed by a group of volunteer moderators with substantial field expertise. This approach is limited by the number of staff available to process the volume of reports submitted throughout the world in multiple languages. 5, 6 ",

For our search, we used MiTAP. Originally developed under the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency's Translingual Information Detection Extraction and Summarization Program (DARPA-TIDES), MiTAP offered an online news service and information retrieval system that captures and categorizes information according to user-defined, searchable newsgroups. 8 -11 Using MiTAP, we searched the above media sources iteratively using multiple keyword combinations. These searches included only articles published in English or translated into English by regional news sources. To extend the range of our data sources, we conducted additional searches with MiTAP using Chinese-, Russian-, and Korean-language local news sources and regional business and financial reports, sometimes with the aid of a bilingual human translator.

McGrath (1991) examined the historical ethnographies of 229 ethnic groups from North and South America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, Russia, and Oceania, and recorded six basic social responses to epidemics: mass evacuation or flight from the site of the epidemic, extraordinary therapeutic or preventive measures, scapegoating of individuals or institutions, acceptance of disease, ostracism of the ill, and conflict. Of these, flight was found to be the most common. McGrath noted that the acute, dramatic appearance of disease, particularly unfamiliar disease, with high rates of morbidity and mortality provoked the strongest social response. She observed that if established indigenous countermeasures failed, innovative countermeasures were undertaken, followed by social disruption that began with flight, then proceeded to acceptance of disease, to rejection of authorities, and ultimately to conflict. This sequence, she argued, depicts a society that has degraded from normal functional status to disintegration. 12 We infer social disruption may be characterized as an emergent property triggered by a biological threat that defies countermeasures, control, and containment.",

It also included descriptions of expected or unexpected propagation patterns, such as the presence of multiple foci when previous experience with a disease dictated a single-point origin for an outbreak or epidemic. Discreet population referred to a high incidence of disease observed in a specific group, such as children or health care workers. As discussed below, the presence of a disease that was multifocal and was directly incapacitating health care workers pointed to a possible compromised medical infrastructure.",

Therefore, we propose Stage P to represent a preparatory posture that reflects anticipation of a biological event.

This kind of knowledge cannot be obtained by relying solely on regional, national, and international media reports.

We hypothesize that this variation is likely due to differences in social tolerance for disruption, the sophistication of public health and medical infrastructures, and the direct effects of the disease in question. We have observed that biological events taking place in countries with limited infrastructure may progress to higher stages more quickly than those occurring in countries with more robust infrastructure. One disease in particular-influenza-like illness-consistently defied countermeasures across multiple countries with a wide range of medical sophistication. This finding is troubling, particularly in light of current concern about pandemic influenza.",

For example, diseases with limited capability for human-to-human transmission should present as Stage 1 events. If a disease that typically exhibits focal transmission characteristics is found to generate higher levels of social disruption, this information may prompt closer scrutiny of the event for unusual epidemiological features and possible implications regarding attribution. If the local indigenous behavior (e.g., typical geotemporal profile of local countermeasures used) is well understood, then sensitivity for an unusual change in behavior may be observed as an indicator for an emerging disease or other unusual phenomenon. This deserves further evaluation.",

However, we recognize that the dynamic progression of a biological event may follow a pattern of upgraded and downgraded staging. Such a pattern might reflect successful countermeasures or particular disease transmission characteristics, among other factors. Furthermore, our observations of media behavior suggest that reporting becomes more vigorous and descriptive as an event evolves and generates maximal impact. However, the media tend to report resolution of an event less vigorously, particularly in closed societies. This trend poses a challenge to the analyst with regards to downgrading the staging of an event. Future investigations will be necessary to address the difficult question of how social disruption is resolved and normalcy is reestablished in a society.",

We anticipate that media reporting of some biological events at any stage may provide only indirect indications and warnings, just a single report, or social disruption parameters not included in our model. Some biological events may not follow the order of social disruption embodied in our model. Conversely, if the cause of an indication and warning, such as rioting, is not verified, an analyst may be falsely alarmed by it and thus may assign a higher stage level than is necessary. We propose that our categories of recurrence, elevation, and diversification, along with proper contextualization of indications and warnings, will allow for more precise categorization of a biological event. Moreover, the staging model proposed here is likely to be revised in the future as more analyses are conducted across time, cultures, and disease entities. We recognize that ongoing operational use of this methodology may yield longitudinal data that could be used in forecasting models.",

The global online community is growing and now stands at nearly 25 billion indexed web pages. 19 ProMED, a current standard in voluntary online, moderated disease outbreak reporting system, has over 40,000 subscribers in 165 countries. 20 We propose it is unlikely the Internet is being fully exploited for disease surveillance. A key challenge in advancing disease surveillance will be to identify methods that can enable the efficient triage of information to detect and track evolving biological events. These methods will require effective coupling to online harvesting engines for Internet exploitation such as we have used in this study. Evaluation of appropriate configurations of harvesting engines that efficiently capture information based on this model will be an important future research requirement.",

While we will need to compare the timeliness of this approach to other methodologies, we recognize there will be an inherent limitation when using parameters for Stage 1 through 4 as the base detection parameters. Investigation of the parameters for Stage P and Stage 0 may offer limited pre-event warning, however this needs more evaluation. Understanding long range trends for a locality may also provide data for a forecasting model, which may aid in early detection as well.",
