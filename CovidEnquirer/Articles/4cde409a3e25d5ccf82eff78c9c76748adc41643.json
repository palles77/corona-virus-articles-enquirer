Methods: Two hundred ninety-nine respiratory samples were prospectively explored using multiplex molecular techniques (FilmArray Respiratory Panel, Clart Pneumovir), immunological techniques (direct fluorescent assay, lateral flow chromatography) and cell cultures. Findings: Molecular techniques permitted the recovery of up to 50% more respiratory pathogens in comparison to non-molecular methods. FilmArray detected at least 30% more pathogens than Clart Pneumovir which could be explained by the differences in their technical designs. The turnaround time under 2 hours for the FilmArray permitted delivery of results when patients were still in the emergency room.",

Cell cultures were the first diagnostic tool to be used in the mid-1950s, and since then, new techniques have been developed to decrease the time to a result (immunofluorescence, lateral flow chromatography) or to boost the sensitivity (molecular techniques) (Levine, 1996; Ginocchio and Harris, 2011) . Many improvements have been made, and techniques combining speed and sensitivity are currently available, such as fully automated 'sample-in, result-out' multiplexed syndromic molecular tools (Bluchan and Ledeboer, 2014) . Aside from being effective in terms of sensitivity and specificity, these latter diagnostic tools are able to recover non-cultivable viruses. As a consequence, questions regarding the usefulness of 'older' diagnostic methods regularly arise (Leland and Ginocchio, 2007; Hodinka and Kaiser, 2013) . Meanwhile, important questions concerning these 'new' expensive rapid molecular techniques remain unanswered, such as their cost-effectiveness in terms of patient's management, or the clinical significance of detecting nucleic acids of micro-organisms that could be non-infectious at the time the sample is collected.",

Regarding influenza B, circulating strains were almost exclusively from the Victoria lineage according to the Belgian Scientific Institute of Public Health (Belgian Public Health Institute, 2019). The enrolment period was chosen in order to be sure to gather positive samples for influenza as it is intended to evaluate, in another article, the impact of the results on antiviral prescription. This choice obviously affects the prevalence of other viruses. Adults and children attending the emergency room (ER) and presenting with upper or lower respiratory symptoms were prospectively included if either intended to be maintained in the hospital or had any of the following conditions known to expose to a higher rate of complications of viral respiratory infections: chronic respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis or asthma, sickle-cell disease, asplenia, neuromuscular diseases, severe neurological affections, hereditary metabolic disorders including diabetes, congenital or acquired immunosuppression, heart defects, chronic nephropathies, chronic liver diseases and pregnancy. Children under 3 months of age with a fever without focus of infection were also included.",

The samples were immediately sent to the microbiology laboratory for testing. Prior to testing, NPA were diluted with 3 mL of viral transport medium composed of veal infusion broth (Difco, Becton Dickinson, Sparks, MD, USA) supplemented with bovine albumin (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA). Lateral flow chromatography (LFC) tests and the FilmArray Respiratory Panel were used to test samples 24/7, whereas direct fluorescent assays (DFA) and cell cultures were performed during working hours (8:00 am to 5:00 pm) from Monday to Saturday. The Clart Pneumovir test was performed once a week. Lab results as well as clinical data from patients' chart were recorded and analyzed.

For children, 80% (119/149) of samples were positive for at least one pathogen. The pathogen detected, ranging from most to least, was rhino/enteroviruses (49), influenza B (32), influenza A (25), coronaviruses (22), adenovirus (18), metapneumovirus (10), RSV (7) and parainfluenza (2). For adults, 63% (94/150) of samples were positive, and the detected viruses were influenza A (32), influenza B (26), rhino/enteroviruses (13), coronavirus (12), adenovirus (8), metapneumovirus (6) and RSV (4). No parainfluenza viruses were detected in the adult patients. All influenza A isolates were A(H1N1)pdm09 with the exception of one A(H3N2) from one adult patient. Influenza B strains were not subtyped. Co-detection was more common in children than in adults (35.3% vs 8.5%; p < 0.001). Table 1 details the sensitivity and specificity observed for the different techniques, depending on the pathogens. Table 2 provides the rate of false negative results, partial agreement (meaning at least one but not all the expected pathogens were detected) and complete agreement (meaning all the expected pathogens were detected) of the non-molecular techniques and molecular techniques compared to the established standard. The FilmArray test produced fewer false negative results and partial results compared to non-molecular techniques and the Clart Pneumovir test (p < 0.001). False negative results with molecular techniques were significantly more frequent in samples with codetections compared to those with only one pathogen: 12% vs 3% for the FilmArray test (p = 0.034) and 76% vs 11% for the Clart Pneumovir test (p < 0.001). Similar result was also observed for cell cultures when limiting the analysis to culturable viruses (100% Vs 37%; p < 0.001). Table 3 reports the mean turnaround time (TAT) of the techniques from the reception of the sample in the laboratory to the introduction of the results into the laboratory information system. The LFC and Fil-mArray techniques have the shortest TAT, while cell cultures and the Clart Pneumovir test have the longest TAT. The TAT for negative cell cultures is about 3 weeks as they are discarded after this delay.",

            "text": "However, the performances of the two evaluated techniques differed; lower sensitivity for the detection of several targets was observed for the Clart Pneumovir test, notably this technique only detects echoviruses among all enteroviruses. For adenoviruses, metapneumoviruses and RSV, the explanation probably relies more on technical considerations. Indeed, false negative results with the FilmArray and the Clart Pneumovir tests were not always for samples with a low viral load, as indicated by the cycle threshold (which correlates with the viral load) of the third molecular technique used to elucidate discrepant results between the first two techniques. As an example, the mean Ct value and standard deviation of negative and positive samples for adenoviruses with Clart Pneumovir were 32.7 (1.6) and 31.8 (2.2) respectively (p = 0.402). The choice of primers and probes used to design tests can determine whether a certain strain of virus will be detected. Although the FilmArray test had a better sensitivity than the Clart Pneumovir test for the detection of adenoviruses, it may lack sensitivity in detecting certain strains, which could impact the management of immunocompromised patients (Song et al., 2016) . A huge advantage of molecular techniques is that they allow the recovery of those pathogens that are difficult to culture, that will not grow in culture or for which no antigen detection tests are available. In the present study, the rate of complete detection of the pathogens present in the samples was far more important with molecular techniques compared to non-molecular ones. This has already been reported. (Weinberg et al., 2004) Viruses with poor detection using non-molecular techniques primarily include adenoviruses, metapneumoviruses and rhino/enteroviruses. There were also positive samples for coronaviruses (Mahony, 2008) which, in our experience, do not commonly grow with routine cell lines, even if coronavirus NL63 was originally described in LLC-MK2 (van der Hoek et al., 2004) .",

The decreased sensitivity of antigen detection and cell cultures when the duration of the cough increases is expected, because viral shedding is more important in the first days of the disease (Aoki and Boivin, 2009 ).

Techniques based on immunofluorescence are slightly more time-consuming. Currently, totally automated techniques with a short hands-on time, such as FilmArray, can be realized in a time frame comparable to that of LFC tests. However, only one can be performed at one time, and the analyzer remains occupied for slightly more than an hour. The number of required instruments is based on the test volume at each facility and the desired TAT. Cell cultures remain the most time-consuming techniques, and results often arrive too late to impact patient management (Ginocchio, 2007) . This was also the case for Clart Pneumovir in our setting, as it was only performed once a week due to the complexity of the corresponding analytical process.",

During this evaluation, molecular techniques were free of charge for patients, but they cost approximately 135 euros per patient. The necessity of molecular tests must be seriously considered before prescription. These tests should probably be reserved for the most severely ill patients, for whom rapid and comprehensive microbiological evaluation is most likely to impact patient management. As a comparison, antigen detection tests cost, including workforce, can range between 5.5 and 14 euros depending on the test and cell cultures cost about 15 euros. However, non-molecular tests are reimbursed by the social welfare in Belgium permitting a broader prescription. The possibilities to implement molecular tests can vary between facilities and countries depending on local policies. Using molecular rather than non-molecular techniques could impact patients' isolation strategies (Richardson et al., 2016) , antibiotic/antiviral use or reduce of the length of stay (Brendish et al., 2017; Rogers et al., 2015) , but cost-benefit analyses are difficult to appraise because of many intertwined elements.",

            "text": "Molecular techniques have considerably increased our capacity to detect respiratory viruses in a timely manner. The main factors limiting a wide utilization of these techniques are cost and the difficulty to absorb the workload in large facilities with numerous samples to analyze per day. Another drawback is that latent viruses or traces of genetic material may be detected. The interpretation of a positive result might be difficult, and it must be carefully correlated to the clinical history of the patient as the presence of a virus in the respiratory tract is a factor exposing to bacterial superinfection (Vareille et al., 2011) . It is possible to quantify the viral load in a respiratory sample, but there are conflicting reports regarding correlations between viral load and outcome (Granados et al., 2017; Wishaupt et al., 2017) . Technical improvements should be made to prevent variation in quantification caused by sample dilution with saline instilled during aspirates or by the variable quantity of sampled material with swabs. These improvements could render comparisons between studies more reliable and permit the establishment of a threshold, above which detected viruses are indeed involved in an ongoing infectious process. In addition, a positive antigen detection test usually correlates with a high viral load in a sample, and a positive cell culture can only be achieved with infective viral particles. Whatever technique is used, fully understanding the benefits and limitations of each is crucial for interpretation. The choice of technique should depend, besides financial considerations, on the necessary sensitivity and speed based on symptoms, comorbidity and risk of a detrimental outcome for each patient. A tertiary care hospital should be able to offer diagnostic tools suitable for each individual case; if testing all patients with molecular techniques is not possible, the use of nonmolecular techniques is preferable over nothing at all.",
