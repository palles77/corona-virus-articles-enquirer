Cases have been reported in 26 countries; however, the majority of cases have occurred in Saudi Arabia (79%) and South Korea (13%) (1) .",

Although the exact mode of transmission from camels is unknown, the presence of high viral loads in the upper respiratory system of infected camels suggests that transmission occurs through close contact (2) . Humanto-human transmission of MERS-CoV has been demonstrated among close household contacts (3). However, sustained community transmission has not been observed. In a cross-sectional serosurveillance study involving 10,009 individuals in Saudi Arabia, positive serology was documented in only 0.15% of individuals sampled (4) . Transmission within health care settings has been a predominant feature of MERS-CoV infection, and has been attributed to breaches of infection prevention and control practices (5) .",

The most severe cases of MERS-CoV infection have been reported in adult patients with underlying comorbidities, including diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease, end-stage kidney disease or immunosuppression (9, 10) . However, severe infection may also occur among younger patients, especially health care workers. The disease spectrum ranges from asymptomatic infection to rapidly progressive multiorgan failure. The most common clinical features in severe cases are fever (71%), cough (68%), dyspnea (66%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (32%) (9) . Laboratory abnormalities commonly associated with severe MERS-CoV infection include leukopenia, lymphocytopenia and thrombocytopenia, in addition to elevated serum levels of creatinine, lactate dehydrogenase and liver enzymes (9) . Initial chest radiographs are abnormal in the majority of symptomatic patients. Findings range from minimal abnormality to extensive bilateral infiltrate consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome patterns (9) . Respiratory samples in suspected patients should be tested using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. Lower respiratory tract specimens have been found to be more sensitive than upper respiratory tract specimens for the detection of MERS-CoV (11) . Rapid progression to hypoxemic respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation usually occurs within the first week and it is notable that it has been associated with acute kidney failure (12) .",

The WHO has issued interim guidance for the management of suspected and confirmed MERS-CoV infection (13) . Early supportive management includes supplemental oxygen to all patients with signs of hypoxemia or respiratory distress, conservative fluid management, early endotracheal intubation in patients with laboured breathing or persistent hypoxemia, and a lung-protective ventilation strategy (13) . Other adjunctive hypoxemic rescue therapies, such as early prone positioning and neuromuscular blockade, may be considered in patients with moderate-to-severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (14) . In addition, systematic corticosteroids should generally be avoided unless there is another indication. High-flow oxygen and noninvasive ventilation should be used with caution because of the potential to generate aerosols (15) . A systematic review to assess the risk for transmission of respiratory pathogens to health care workers through aerosol-generating procedures found that the following procedures were associated with an increased risk for pathogen transmission: endotracheal intubation, noninvasive ventilation, tracheotomy and manual ventilation (15) .",
