To allow optimal translation of viral proteins at the expense of cellular proteins, virus families have evolved a variety of methods to repress the host translation machinery, while allowing effective viral protein synthesis. Many viruses use noncanonical mechanisms that permit translation of their own RNAs under these conditions. Viruses have also developed mechanisms to evade host innate immune responses that would repress translation under conditions of viral infection, in particular PKR activation in response to double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). Importantly, the study of viral translation mechanisms has enormously enhanced our understanding of many aspects of the cellular protein biosynthesis pathway and its components. A number of unusual mechanisms of translation initiation that were first discovered in viruses have since been observed in cellular mRNAs, and it has become apparent that a diverse range of translation mechanisms operates in eukaryotes, allowing subtle regulation of this essential process.",

Alternatively, this process may occur in the cytoplasm, in which case the virus must encode, or bring with it, its own transcriptional system. Viral mRNAs also differ in their structure; some viral mRNAs are capped and polyadenylated, and these viruses often adopt novel ways in which to ensure the viral mRNAs are preferentially translated over cellular mRNAs, either through modification of the host cell translational machinery and/or adoption of novel translational mechanisms.

For initiation to occur the eIF4F complex, comprised of the cap-binding protein eIF4E, the helicase eIF4A, and the bridging protein eIF4G, binds to the mRNA. The 40S ribosomal subunit is recruited via an eIF4G-eIF3-40S interaction together with the ternary complex, which contains eIF2, GTP, and initiator met-tRNAi. The resulting complex is known as the 48S complex. The scanning model of translation initiation predicts that this complex then scans along the mRNA until the start codon is reached. 3 ",

These include upstream open reading frames (uORFs), microRNA (miRNA) target sites, and polyadenylation elements. 7, 8 Transcription of mRNAs from mammalian DNA virus genomes such as herpesviruses and adenoviruses occur in the nucleus and results in the production of capped viral mRNAs.

Many viruses produce proteases that cleave protein components of this complex to inhibit cap-dependent scanning. Thus the cleavage of eIF4G dissociates the ribosome binding ability of the complex from cap recognition. The cleavage of PABP by viral proteases will prevent the interaction of the 5 0 and 3 0 ends of the mRNA and also reduce the stability of the complex. three 4E-BPs in mammals, all of which act by binding to eIF4E and inhibiting its interaction with eIF4G, leading to an inhibition of cap-dependent translation initiation. Hyperphosphorylation of 4E-BP1 releases eIF4E and allows it to interact with eIF4G in the eIF4F complex. This hyperphosphorylation is stimulated by growth factors via the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, and is a target of regulation for a number of viruses.

VIRAL STRATEGIES TO SUBVERT THE MAMMALIAN TRANSLATION MACHINERY cycle, accompanied by major changes in viral gene expression. This switch from latent to lytic infection requires the induction of protein synthesis, and 4E-BP modification appears to play an essential role in this process. 10 The switch from latent to lytic infection in HSV-1-infected sensory neurons is accompanied by induction of 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. Inactivation of 4E-BP1 in HSV-1-infected cells is increased further by proteasome-dependent degradation, and a decrease in the level of this protein accompanies the increase in phosphorylation. 11 The viral ICP0 protein, an important master regulator of lytic reactivation, is required for both these processes. 4E-BP1 phosphorylation during HSV-1 infection is sensitive to the effects of rapamycin, suggesting that virus-induced signaling through mTOR (see chapter by Blenis and Mahoney, this volume) is required for inactivation of this protein. 11 Direct regulation of the mTOR pathway occurs in cells infected with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). The protein product of the LMP-2A gene activates mTOR via PI3 kinase/Akt signaling 12 and it has been suggested that the resulting phosphorylation and inactivation of 4E-BP1 may be required to increase translation in the transformed cells. 10 For other viruses in this family, such as human cytomegalovirus (hCMV), it would appear that additional mechanisms are also required, as rapamycin is not sufficient to abolish the 4E-BP1 phosphorylation induced in the virus infection. 13, 14 Infection of B cells with Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) also stimulates hyperphosphorylation of 4E-BP1, although complete release of eIF4E from 4E-BP1 is not observed in this case. 15 ",

The picornaviruses have uncapped mRNAs that are translated by the cap-independent mechanism of internal ribosome entry. Encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and, to a lesser extent, PV, affect 4E-BP activity by increasing the ability of this protein to bind to and sequester eIF4E in order to silence cap-dependent translation of host mRNAs and permit selective translation of EMCV and PV mRNAs. 19 Upon infection with EMCV, 4E-BP1 becomes dephosphorylated, and this coincides with the shutoff of protein synthesis that occurs. Dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in PVinfected cells lags behind the shutoff of cellular protein synthesis, and it appears that in this situation protein synthesis inhibition is initiated by the cleavage of eIF4G. Further evidence of a role for dephosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in inhibition of protein synthesis during EMCV and PV infections was demonstrated by addition of rapamycin, an inhibitor of 4E-BP phosphorylation, to virus-infected cells. This results in enhanced synthesis of EMCV and PV viral proteins. 20 ",

Adenovirus mRNAs are capped, but they are selectively translated during late viral infection. During this stage, the first protein to be synthesized is the 100 K protein, encoded by the L4 transcription unit, and this is produced in very large amounts. 30 The 100 K protein then binds to the carboxyl-terminus of eIF4G at, or near, the site that is normally occupied by the eIF4E kinase Mnk1. By competing with Mnk1 for binding, the 100 K protein acts as a direct inhibitor of Mnk1 and displaces this protein from eIF4G. 31, 32 The removal of Mnk1 from eIF4G results in the dephosphorylation of eIF4E, which is thought to be associated with the inhibition of cellular capdependent translation, although the precise mechanism by which this occurs is not understood. Late AdV mRNAs are capped but are still translated when cellular protein synthesis is inhibited as they possess a common 5 0 -noncoding region (5 0 -NCR) known as the tripartite leader. The tripartite leader allows the late mRNAs to be selectively translated by an alternate mechanism of initiation known as ribosome shunting. During late infection, the 100 K protein enhances the binding of eIF4G and eIF4A to the tripartite leader complex at the 5 0 end of the adenovirus mRNA. 33 The activity of the 100 K protein is stimulated by tyrosine phosphorylation, 33 and this phosphorylation event is necessary to promote viral translation following shunting and does not affect the binding of this protein to eIF4G.",

Experiments conducted in the presence of inhibitors of viral RNA synthesis indicated that, although eIF4GI is still cleaved under these conditions, host translational shutoff is minimal. 40 It was subsequently shown VIRAL STRATEGIES TO SUBVERT THE MAMMALIAN TRANSLATION MACHINERY that 2A protease also cleaves eIF4GII. Cleavage of both proteins is required for the virus to inhibit host translation. 41 In the case of PV, eIF4GII is cleaved with slower kinetics than eIF4GI, and eIF4GII cleavage is therefore the ratelimiting step for induction of host translational shutoff. 41 FMDV L-protease also cleaves both eIF4GI and II, but with similar kinetics for each protein. 38 The significance of eIF4GII cleavage is not certain, as it is much less abundant than eIF4GI in cells and is no more active in supporting translation initiation. Moreover, the central domain of eIF4G, which lacks the eIF4Ebinding domain, can support translation initiation on capped mRNAs. This eIF4G p100 domain is fourfold less effective than intact eIF4F in mediating translation initiation on capped mRNAs, but is more active than intact eIF4F for initiation on PV RNA. 42 It is likely that, when viral RNA synthesis increases the pool of PV RNA in the cell, the p100 fragment of eIF4G is redirected to PV RNA at the expense of host translation. Other effects of picornavirus infection, such as PABP cleavage, may also be involved in mediating the inhibition of host translation that occurs during picornavirus infection.",

In PV-infected cells PABP is cleaved by the viral 3C protease at different sites to the 2A proteases. 54 Recent work has provided new information on the role of PABP cleavage in picornavirus infections. It is known that PABP also stimulates picornavirus IRES-directed translation through its interaction with poly(A) tails and eIF4G. 55, 56 One question that has been the focus of interest for picornavirologists for many years is the mechanism of switching from translation to replication of the viral RNAs. As these two processes are occurring in opposite directions on the same RNA, it is believed that something must stall translation to allow replication to occur. It has also been shown recently that HAV 3C protease cleaves PABP in vivo and in vitro. 57 The resulting N-terminal cleavage product binds VIRAL STRATEGIES TO SUBVERT THE MAMMALIAN TRANSLATION MACHINERY to the HAV 5 0 -UTR (to the pY1 region upstream of the IRES) and suppresses translation of the HAV mRNA. HAV does not induce host cell shutoff and infection does not result in cleavage of eIF4G. A model has been proposed in which PABP binds to the poly(A) tail on the HAV RNA early in infection and stimulates translation. Once enough viral proteins have accumulated, the 3C protease cleaves PABP and the N-terminal cleavage product binds to the pY1 region of the 5 0 -UTR of HAV RNA, inhibiting translation. The RNA is then cleared of ribosomes to allow replication to occur in the opposite direction. 57 This model is also likely to apply to other picornaviruses, as it has now been shown that PABP cleavage by PV 3C protease also inhibits translation directed by the PV IRES, both on RNAs with and without poly(A) tails. 58 It was also demonstrated that expression of a PABP that is resistant to cleavage by 3C protease within cells resulted in reduced production of viral RNA and reduced virus production. This suggests that PABP cleavage may be important in promoting the switch from translation to replication in picornavirus infections.",

Rotaviruses cause gastroenteritis and infect many animal species; in humans, they are responsible for severe diarrheal disease in infants which is a cause of high mortality in the developing world. These viruses replicate in the cytoplasm of infected cells where capped, nonpolyadenylated viral mRNAs are made. 60 The rotavirus nonstructural protein NSP3 binds to the N-terminal region of eIF4GI, both in vitro and in infected cells and also binds to the 3 0terminal sequence common to all rotavirus mRNAs, similar to PABP binding to cellular mRNAs. 61 Rotavirus-infected cells also undergo inhibition of cellular protein synthesis and this has been attributed to the novel action of the NSP3 protein. The NSP3 protein specifically evicts PABP from the eIF4F complex by competing for binding to eIF4GI. In spite of this similar function, there is no sequence homology between PABP and NSP3. It is therefore believed that NSP3 binding to a consensus sequence in the 3 0 end of rotavirus mRNAs recruits the eIF4F complex to the viral mRNAs via NSP3 binding to eIF4GI, effectively circularizing the viral mRNAs. It has been proposed that NSP3 functions in a similar way to PABP binding to polyadenylated eukaryotic mRNAs. However, more recent data have questioned this model as it has been demonstrated that NSP3 (and its interaction with eIF4GI) is not required for rotavirus mRNA translation. 62 In this study, RNAi-induced silencing of NSP3 in infected cells had no effect on viral protein production (except NSP3) or virus replication, although it did result in a less severe shutoff of host cell protein synthesis. In fact, viral progeny production was enhanced in the NSP3-silenced cells. Similarly, these authors suggested that eIF4GI is also not required for viral protein synthesis, as silencing of this factor also had no effect on virus production. A new model on the role of NSP3 was put forward that proposes that binding of NSP3 to the viral mRNAs either protects them from degradation or prevents binding of the virus polymerase, thereby ensuring they are utilized for translation. 62 The exact role remains to be determined.",

It has been shown recently that a translational enhancer element (TEE) within the 3 0 -UTR of Bunyamwera virus S segment mRNA is able to substitute for a poly(A) tail. 63 A similar element has been shown to exist in Dengue virus mRNA. 64 Translation of the bunyavirus mRNAs requires eIF4GI but does not require PABP, although the exact role of eIF4GI is currently unknown. Furthermore, bunyavirus infection of cells in culture resulted in a redistribution of PABP localization from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, and it was suggested that this may contribute to the inhibition of translation of host (polyadenylated) mRNAs. The viral N protein binds to PABP in the cytoplasm but it is not yet known if this protein is directly involved in the nuclear relocalization.",

A ribosomal scanning process then transports the 40S subunit and associated factors to the next AUG codon further downstream, where translation initiation occurs. Type II IRESs, located in cardio-and aphthovirus mRNAs (e.g., EMCV), are similar in length to type I IRESs, at about 450 nucleotides (nt).

In vitro reconstruction of initiation complexes using purified and recombinant initiation factors and 40S subunits indicated that eIF4G binds directly to the J-K domain of type II IRESs, that this binding is stimulated by eIF4A, and that this induces a conformational change in the region surrounding the initiation codon that is likely to promote 43S complex recruitment. 68 Recently, similar experiments on the type I PV IRES have indicated that an analogous mechanism is used to recruit eIF4G-4A to domain V of the IRES and to induce structural changes at the 3 0 border of the IRES. 69 Other structural features of both classes of IRES are also required for initiation, and therefore eIF4G/4A recruitment alone is not sufficient for IRES activity. In addition to their requirement for components of the canonical translation initiation machinery, many picornavirus IRESs need to recruit noncanonical IRES ITAFs to achieve optimal activity. A number of ITAFs that interact with specific IRESs have been identified, although in some cases the physiological role of these factors is questionable. Well-characterized examples include the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB), which was first shown to interact with the human rhinovirus (HRV), 70 and was subsequently found to be required for efficient PV and EMCV translation in cells. 71 A role for the autoantigen La in stimulation of PV IRES activity has also been demonstrated in vitro and in cell culture. 72 ITAFs are thought to act by modulating the secondary structure of the IRES such that canonical initiation factors are more effectively recruited, and such a role was demonstrated for PTB and ITAF45 binding to the FMDV IRES 73 and more recently in cells. 74 Picornavirus infection is frequently associated with rapid shutoff of host translation, providing a rationale for the use of IRESs to maintain viral translation under these conditions. The enterovirus 2A and FMDV L-proteases, for example, cleave eIF4GI and II such that the N-terminal eIF4E-binding domain is separated from the remainder of the protein. Although picornavirus IRESs show unaffected or even enhanced activity in the presence of 2A protease, some of this stimulation is thought to be independent of inhibition of host translation or expression of the C-terminal fragment of eIF4G. 75 Stimulation of IRES activity can still occur when 2A protease with a mutant active site is expressed, or when eIF4G is resistant to 2A cleavage. 76 The effects of this protease on IRES activity are therefore more complex than a simple competition between full-length and truncated eIF4G mediating host and viral translation, and it is probable that other factors are regulated by the protease and have an effect on picornavirus IRESs.",

The flavi-and pestiviruses are positive-sense RNA viruses with uncapped structured 5 0 -UTRs that direct synthesis of the viral polyprotein. The HCV and pestivirus 5 0 -UTRs are somewhat shorter than those of the picornaviruses, and almost the entire UTR, approximately 330 nt, is required for IRES activity. HCV and related IRESs can bind directly to the 40S subunit (in the absence of any initiation factors) such that the start codon is positioned close to the ribosomal P site. The IRESs then bind directly to eIF3 and require this factor and the ternary eIF2/GTP/Met-tRNAi complex to form correctly positioned 48S* complexes. The IRES can then recruit the 60S subunit and assemble functional 80S ribosomes. 82 These IRESs do not require any components of the eIF4F complex, and it was recently demonstrated that at high magnesium concentrations the HCV IRES is able to initiate translation independently of the eIF2/GTP/Met-tRNAi ternary complex. 83 eIF2-and eIF5-independent HCV IRES activity was mediated by eIF5B in a manner analogous to prokaryotic translation initiation. 84 This ability to function in an eIF2-independent manner displays an intriguing similarity to the dicistrovirus intergenic region (IGR) IRESs and is likely to allow the HCV IRES to function under conditions of cell stress that induce eIF2 phosphorylation.",

This suggests that the HCV IRES may function in a similar manner to these factors to promote initiation. 86 A pathway for recruitment of HCV IRES RNA to the 40S subunit has been determined using directed hydroxyl radical probing, providing a further indication of similar, but distinct, effects of the HCV IRES and eIF1/1A binding to the 40S subunit. 87 The secondary structure of the HCV and pestivirus IRESs has been clearly defined (Fig. 3) . Domain III is necessary for 40S binding and for subsequent eIF3 recruitment, but domain II is not required to recruit these components. However, deletion of domain II results in severely impaired IRES activity, and this region of the IRES was shown to be important for 80S formation. 88 Domain II folds independently of the remainder of the IRES, and is responsible for the conformational changes induced in the 40S subunit by HCV IRES binding. 85 An analysis of the role of this domain in subunit joining indicated that it promotes eIF5-induced GTP hydrolysis and release of eIF2/GDP. 89 Despite its ability to initiate translation by binding directly to the ribosome, there is some evidence for a role for several different ITAFs in HCV IRES activity. Several proteins have been shown to bind to the HCV IRES, but the most convincing evidence is for a role for the autoantigen La. This factor interacts directly with the HCV IRES at a site close to the start codon, and stimulates 40S binding in vitro. Depletion of La in cultured cells led to a loss of IRES activity. 72 ",

The IGR IRES binds to the 40S subunit via the PKII-PKIII domains, and is positioned correctly for elongation by PKI, which occupies the P site of the ribosome.

An IRES that directs translation of all three isoforms of the Gag protein is located in a highly structured region which is downstream of the authentic AUG1 start codon and spans to AUG3. 103 This IRES is therefore required to deliver the preinitiation complex upstream to produce Gag p57 polyprotein from the first AUG codon. 103 H. miRNAs miRNAs have recently emerged as major regulators of gene expression (discussed in detail in the chapter by Sarnow, this volume).

The viral miR-S1 is expressed antisense to the TAg mRNA and acts in an siRNA-like manner to cleave and degrade the TAg transcript. 107 This mechanism appears to function to mediate downregulation of antigen levels late in the viral life cycle and thus allows the virus to evade a cytotoxic T cell response. 107 The location and function of this miRNA appear to be conserved in other polyomaviruses. 106, 115 Regulation of a viral transcript by an antisense viral miRNA has also been observed or predicted for some herpesvirus miRNAs. miR-H2-3p, which is expressed during latent HSV-1 infection, is antisense to the viral ICP0 transcript. Surprisingly, despite its exact complementarity to its target, miR-H2-3p does not significantly affect ICP0 mRNA levels, but reduces the expression of the encoded protein at the level of translation. 114 This regulation is likely to be important for establishment and maintenance of viral latency, as the ICP0 protein is important for productive replication and is thought to be involved in reactivation from latency. 114 A search for imperfect targets for viral miRNAs within viral 3 0 -UTRs yielded a number of attractive candidates, suggesting that viruses also use this mechanism to regulate their own gene expression. This was confirmed experimentally for hCMV miR-UL112-1, which downregulates expression of the major immediate early gene IE1 by binding to its 3 0 -UTR. 116 IE1 protein is important for the switch from latent to lytic infection, as are some of the other predicted viral targets of herpesvirus miRNAs, so viral miRNAs may play a general role in regulation of herpesvirus latency.",

Adenovirus infection results in a global inhibition of host miRNA expression and activity. Expression of VA RNAI led to inhibition of processing of ectopically expressed pre-miR30, and to inhibition of RNAi induced by short hairpin RNA (shRNA) precursors that require Dicer cleavage for activity. This activity was mediated by VA RNAI competition with pre-miRNAs and shRNAs for binding to both exportin-5, required for pre-miRNA export from the nucleus, and to the cytoplasmic processing enzyme Dicer. 128 VA-derived small RNAs also compete with endogenous miRNAs for incorporation into the RISC. 109 VA RNAI is expressed at very high levels in infected cells, so it is possible that its interference with the miRNA and RNAi pathways may be a consequence of this expression and have little functional relevance for the virus. Although some studies have suggested repression of the miRNA pathway by retroviral transcription factors, 129,130 a recent analysis did not identify any such activity. 111 ",

Influenza virus is well known for causing pandemic outbreaks and is a zoonotic disease, infecting pigs, avian species and horses, as well as humans. Influenza A viruses belong to the Orthomyxoviridae family and have a singlestranded, negative-sense RNA genome which is made up of eight segments. In influenza virus-infected cells there is a dramatic inhibition of host cell translation while the viral mRNAs are selectively translated. 139 It is well established that influenza virus mRNAs acquire their 5 0 caps through a process of ''cap snatching'' or ''cap stealing'' during which the virus polymerase complex ''snatches'' the 5 0 10-12 nt from host nuclear mRNAs which then prime the synthesis of viral mRNAs. The viral mRNAs therefore contain host cell sequences at their 5 0 ends, which are followed by conserved viral sequences that are known to bind the viral polymerase. It is believed that polymerase binding to these conserved sequences prevents the snatching of caps from the viral mRNAs 140 and contributes to the selective translation of viral mRNAs during infection; the cellular mRNAs being degraded once decapped. The polymerase itself is a complex of three subunits, PA, PB1, and PB2. The PB1 subunit is involved in binding to the caps on cellular mRNAs that are then VIRAL STRATEGIES TO SUBVERT THE MAMMALIAN TRANSLATION MACHINERY thought to be cleaved by the endonuclease activity of the polymerase. The crystal structure of the PA subunit has recently been solved and the endonuclease active site was shown to reside in the amino-terminal end of the protein. 141, 142 As described above, influenza virus infection results in changes to the eIF4F complex as eIF4E is dephophorylated and eIF4G is hyperphosphoryated. 34 A study to understand the components of the eIF4F complex that are required for translation of viral mRNAs has recently demonstrated that influenza virus translation has no requirement for eIF4E, as viral mRNAs are translated in cells depleted of eIF4E and in cells treated with rapamycin. 143 The authors suggested that the polymerase is able to substitute for eIF4E by binding to the conserved sequences in the 5 0 -UTR of the viral mRNAs and recruiting initiation factors. This seems to be another example of how some capped viral mRNAs display a reduced requirement for eIF4E in a similar manner to the adenoviruses.",

            "text": "There are many examples of important mammalian virus pathogens including retroviruses (e.g., HIV-1) and coronaviruses (SARS) that employ frameshifting during translation. In most of the systems examined to date, frameshifting is required for the expression of viral replicases. In retroviruses, frameshifting is necessary for the synthesis of Gag-Pol and Gag-Pro-Pol polyproteins and the production of reverse transcriptases, whereas for the majority of other viruses it is essential to permit the synthesis of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases. 146 Ribosomal frameshifting is a process that alters the triplet decoding of the mRNA by the elongating ribosome. A specific signal in the mRNA causes the ribosome to change reading frame from the 0 to the \u00c0 1 frame and translation then continues in the new frame. 146 In eukaryotes frameshift signals require two elements, a heptanucleotide ''slippery sequence,'' where the ribosome changes reading frame, and a stimulatory element that is located a few nucleotides downstream in the form of an RNA pseudoknot 147 or a stemloop. 148 A spacer region of 6-8 nt between the slippery sequence and the stimulatory RNA element is also required, and frameshifting efficiency is dependent upon the length of this sequence (Fig. 5; Refs. 147,149) . Several models for how frameshifting occurs have been proposed (reviewed in Refs. 146, 150) and the model that is most consistent with experimental data suggests that ribosomal pausing at the stimulatory RNA element increases the time that the ribosome is held over the slippery sequence and this permits the tRNA to realign in the \u00c0 1 frame. 151, 152 1. CORONAVIRUSES Coronaviruses are a family of animal viruses with a large positive stranded RNA genome. In this family of viruses the replicase gene is composed of two partially overlapping ORFs, 1a and 1b, and the fused polyprotein 1a/1b (pp1ab) is synthesized by programmed \u00c0 1 ribosomal frameshifting. 147, 153 The first characterized frameshift signal described for pp1a/pp1b in coronaviruses was in avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV; Ref. 147); subsequently, very similar mechanisms were shown to achieve this mode of translation elongation in other coronaviruses. It was shown by mutational analysis that the slippery sequence in IBV is UUUAAAC 154 and that the downstream frameshift stimulatory element 6-7 nt away from this sequence is a hairpin (H)-type mRNA pseudoknot ( Ref. 147; Fig. 6 ).",

The RNA pseudoknot interacts with the ribosome in close association with the putative 80S helicase at the entrance to the mRNA channel as well as with the 18S rRNA helix 16, rpS9, rpS2, and the ubiquitous eukaryotic ribosomal regulatory protein RACK1. Eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2) was shown to be trapped in the A site of the ribosome and this would prevent binding of tRNA to this site until the frameshift has been completed. In the presence of the pseudoknot the P site tRNA is distorted and bent toward the A site that contains eEF2. Taken together these data allowed the following three step model for frameshifting to be proposed. 152 (i) The helicase at the entrance of the mRNA tunnel on the elongating ribosome is unable to unwind the pseudoknot structure in the mRNA, pausing the ribosome. (ii) The blockage imposed by the pseudoknot partially inhibits the movement of the tRNA, bound to the mRNA by the codon-anticodon pairing, during translocation. The tRNA is unable to return to the A site due to the presence of eEF2, and the resulting strain on the tRNA causes it to bend in a (\u00fe) sense direction such that it now moves to the roof of the P site. (iii) Due to the strain of these opposing forces the codon-anticodon interactions breaks. The tRNA then relaxes and moves in the (\u00c0) sense 5 0 direction and repairs with the mRNA in the \u00c0 1 position. 152 This elegant model agrees well with earlier data and supports a number of other models that have been proposed. 146, 150, 155 Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans is caused by a novel coronavirus 156 and the frameshift element in this virus is highly related to those described previously although with some interesting differences. In SARS-CoV the site of frameshifting signal that allows the production of pp1ab is also a U_UUA_AAC stretch and this is found 12 bases upstream of the 1a stop codon. The frameshift is very efficient; using reporter-based systems, frameshift frequencies of between 14% and 27% were measured in vitro and in vivo. 157, 158 As with other coronaviruses there is a downstream pseudoknot, and disruption of base pairing in this element substantially reduces the efficiency of frameshifting. 157, 158 However, there are notable differences in this pseudoknot when compared to other coronaviruses. The pseudoknot conforms to the H type structure found in IBV, but there is extensive base pairing in loop 3. 157 Most of loop 3 can be deleted without great effect. However, there appears to be an essential conformation that needs to be maintained to achieve maximum frameshifting efficiency. 146 ",

There is an 11 bp helical stem and a highly ordered hairpin loop, the top of which contains an ACAA tetraloop (Fig. 6) . A less stable stem is also present which is separated from the upper loop. 148, 166 It has been suggested that the lower stem acts as a ''positioning element'' that permits the stem-loop to induce the ribosomal pausing required to perturb ribosome translocation. 166 ",

Although the mechanism of reinitiation is not fully understood, it has been shown that in mammalian systems efficient reinitiation following uORF translation only occurs if the complete eIF4F complex, or eIF4A, 4B, and the central domain of eIF4G participated in the original initiation event. 172 Some viral mRNAs are able to mediate translation reinitiation following translation of a long ORF, and special mechanisms have been developed to promote this event.",

The subgenomic mRNA encoding the structural proteins of FCV is bicistronic with two overlapping cistrons. The first ORF of the RNA encodes the viral major capsid protein (VP1) and the second cistron encodes the minor capsid protein VP2. The two uORFs overlap by 4 nt in FCV (AUGA), one in norovirus (UAAUG) and eight in rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (AUGUCUGA). 173, 174 The expression of the downstream ORF requires a termination-reinitiation event which is different from those identified in mammalian systems studied to date since it is independent of eIF4G or the eIF4F complex. Instead reinitiation requires an interaction of eIF3 and the 40 S ribosomal subunit with a sequence element that is present in the 3 0 -terminal 70 nt of the upstream ORF, denoted the termination upstream ribosomal-binding site (TURBS). 175, 176 Two short sequence motifs present in TURBS are required for reinitiation, the first of which is a pentameric UGGGA sequence that is complementary to the apical loop of helix 26 in the mammalian 18S rRNA. Evidence for a direct interaction between FCV mRNA and 18S rRNA was obtained using a yeast model system where mutations were introduced into both RNAs. 128 Thus when the yeast 18S rRNA was mutated such that it was adapted to the FCV sequence or vice versa there was a dramatic increase in the translation of the downstream frame. 128 This UGGA motif is conserved in caliciviruses. 175 The second motif is not conserved among caliciviruses but is located at an equivalent position in the TURBS of FCV and RHDV, 175 and it is the secondary structure of these sequences, and not the primary sequence, that is important for function. 176 It has been proposed that the binding of posttermination eIF3/40S complexes to TURBS retains them in a position suitable for reinitiation once they have acquired the eIF2/GTP/Met tRNAi ternary complex. 175, 176 In agreement with this hypothesis it has been shown that eIF3 is involved in termination and recycling of ribosomal complexes, thus providing in part an explanation for the interaction of eIF3 with the 40S ribosomal subunit (Ref. 177 and discussed in the chapter by Fraser, this volume).",

All these viruses cause acute respiratory infections in their hosts. The pneumovirinae direct the synthesis of eight mRNA transcripts, encoding nine primary translation products and the M2 transcripts all contain two uORFs, M2-1 and M2-2, which are overlapping. 182 Expression of the RSV M2-2 ORF occurs via an unusual coupled translation event in which termination of translation of the M2-1 ORF is required before translation of M2-2 can be initiated. [183] [184] [185] A number of regions in the RSV M2-1 ORF have been shown to play a role in coupled translation. The most important region is not between the overlapping cistrons, but is located 150 nts upstream in the M2-1 ORF and contains stable structural elements. 184, 185 A similar mechanism is used to initiate the translation of M2-2 transcripts of APV and hMPV, although there are differences in the efficiencies of the process, which appear to be due to lack of stimulatory sequences in the M2-1 ORF. 185 The reinitiation mechanism is likely to be quite different from that found in influenza BM2 and calicivirus subgenomic mRNAs, but may well involve the same principle of capturing some of the posttermination 40S subunits and restraining them in a position suitable for reinitiation.",

These proteins are activated by different external stimuli, generally under conditions of cell stress, and the particular kinase that is activated is dependent upon the stress induced. PKR activation represents one of the major host responses to viral infection. Exposure of cells to interferon stimulates the production of PKR 202 which then is activated in response to the presence of dsRNA in cells. This often occurs as a result of viral infection by RNA viruses, either because the virus has dsRNA elements within its genome, or because viral replication induces the temporary formation of dsRNA intermediates which could originate from bidirectional transcription. The interaction of PKR with dsRNA initiates dimerization, autophosphorylation, and the subsequent activation of this kinase (Fig. 8) . Active PKR dimers then phosphorylate the alpha subunit of eIF2 at serine 51 and this has the net effect of preventing further ternary complex formation (Fig. 3) such that the translation of host and viral RNAs is inhibited. 203 ",

            "text": "In PV-infected cells PKR is activated by the presence of dsRNA, resulting in an increase in the phosphorylation of eIF2 that leads to a decrease in protein synthesis rates. To circumvent this, PV infection also initiates a series of events that lead to the degradation of PKR. 236 The detailed mechanism of this degradation is not fully understood, although it has been suggested that cellular rather than viral proteases are required. 237 Finally, it has been shown recently that the NSs protein of rift valley fever virus (RVFV) induces specific degradation of PKR. 238 Following infection with RVFV there is a dramatic decrease in PKR protein levels with little change in the levels of the mRNA. In the presence of proteasome inhibitors there is a decrease in RVFV growth and an increase in PKR, strongly suggesting that the degradation is mediated via the proteasome pathway. Since other related viruses do not have this activity it was suggested that the extraordinary pathogenicity of RVFV is due to the acquired PKR degradation function of NSs. 238 5. ADDITIONAL MECHANISMS TO OVERCOME PKR ACTIVATION Although many viruses have devised novel ways in which to circumvent the effects of PKR, it is interesting to note that viruses belonging to the Dicistroviridae family which infect insects use a unique mechanism to initiate their translation which is independent of ternary complex. [91] [92] [93] In this case viral protein synthesis is stimulated when eIF2 is phosphorylated. 92 An alternative mechanism is adopted by the alphavirus sindbis virus (SV) where activation of PKR by viral infection causes almost complete phosphorylation of eIF2. However, under these conditions there is still efficient translation of SV 26S mRNA. Downstream of the initiation codon on the subgenomic RNA there is a stable stem-loop, that is able to stall ribosomes on the correct site to initiate translation of SV 26S mRNA. 81 The data suggest that eIF2A delivers the Met-tRNAi to the stalled 40S ribosome, bypassing the requirement for a functional eIF2. 239 ",

            "text": "The herpesvirus human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is a widespread opportunistic pathogen that can cause disease and death of newborn infants or individuals that are immunocompromised. Infection of cells with HCMV results in the production of large amounts of viral glycoproteins and an increase of Ca 2\u00fe release from the ER to the cytosol. This induces cell stress, which benefits the virus, as chaperone induction by the UPR extends the protein folding capacity of the ER. 246, 247 However, virus infection also induces the phosphorylation of PERK and the translational upregulation of the transcription factor ATF4, yet the virus prevents the activation of the ATF4-dependent pathway that would lead to cell apoptosis. 246, 247 This is mediated by viral protein pUL38 which promotes PERK activation and ATF4 production but suppresses the persistent c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) phoshorylation and ER-stress-induced cell death. 244 It has also been shown that the LMP1 protein from EBV works in a similar manner. 240 Again this protein induces the phosphorylation of PERK and this translationally upregulates the production of ATF4. ATF4 then trans-activates the promoter of LMP1 leading to increased transcription and expression of this protein and enhanced proliferation of the infected B cells. 240 In HSV-1 infected cells PERK is inactivated and not affected by the acute ER stress that occurs as a result of the viral infection. 241 This is mediated by the viral glycoprotein (B) (gB) of HSV-1 that specifically associates with the luminal domain of PERK and suppresses its activation. 241 Interestingly, gB appears also to directly regulate viral protein accumulation in a PERK-dependent manner. 241 Similarly the HCV envelope protein E2, an ER-bound protein, has been shown to directly bind to PERK and inhibit its activation. Mammalian cells that stably express E2 are resistant to the effects of ER-stress inducers, and E2 can relieve the translational repression induced by PERK. 243",

Viruses, especially RNA viruses with their high RNA replication error rates, are the best example we have of natural selection (as opposed to directed selection in agricultural and laboratory practice) operating in real time before our very eyes. The most ''successful'' viral strains or species are, by definition, those which are most abundant in the environment, and by this criterion H1N1 swine flu is proving a more successful virus than SARS was, notwithstanding the much higher mortality rate (almost 10%) in SARS infection. Of course, such success may be short lived.

Against these, there is evolutionary pressure on the host to elaborate antiviral defense mechanisms, which in turn puts pressure on the viruses to develop mechanisms of negating or bypassing these host cell defenses. Although this picture is almost certainly oversimplified, there is little doubt that virus evolution is relatively simple as compared with higher eukaryote whole organism evolution.",

            "text": "Viruses have contributed enormously to our understanding of eukaryotic protein synthesis mechanisms, and mRNA structure and function. This is in part due to the fact that, irrespective of whether the viral genome is DNA or RNA, positive or negative strand, double or single stranded, all viruses are dependent on the cellular protein synthesis machinery, whereas they vary in their dependence on other facets of host-cell gene expression. The contribution of virus research to our understanding of mRNA structure and function, and the mechanism of protein biosynthesis is highlighted by the following list of discoveries (in approximate chronological order) all made through exploiting viruses: eubacterial translation initiation sites (RNA bacteriophages), poly(A) tails (vaccinia), 5 0 caps (reovirus), PKR (PV), translation of only the first cistron of polycistronic mRNAs (tobacco mosaic virus), leaky termination (plant RNA viruses), the scanning ribosome mechanism (reovirus), eIF4G (PV), IRESs (picornaviruses), programmed-1 frame-shifting (retroviruses and coronaviruses), ribosome shunting (adenovirus), and reinitiation after translation of a long ORF (pneumoviruses, caliciviruses, influenza B viruses). Moreover, this list has not closed because there are unusual viral RNA translation mechanisms that remain to be fully elucidated, for example, the extraordinary translational stop-restart mechanism promoted by the FMDV 2A peptide. Some of the earlier discoveries in the above list exploited the fact that in the era before recombinant DNA techniques and transcription vectors had been developed, viruses were often the best source of a single mRNA species (e.g., PV, tobacco mosaic virus) or a very limited number of mRNAs (reovirus), with the added advantage of being able to synthesize defined radiolabeled mRNAs in some cases (e.g., reovirus). Viruses also provide excellent tools with which to study cellular protein synthesis or novel viral mechanisms of initiation. For example, the picornavirus proteases that cleave eIF4G are widely used to study capindependent mechanisms of initiation, and a range of viral IRES elements that require different factors for function are routinely used to dissect translational control processes, such as miRNA-mediated regulation of gene expression. However, the more recent discoveries are due to the fact that viruses, particularly positive-strand RNA viruses with small genomes, have evolved to exploit the extremes of behavior (or what might be thought the weaknesses) in the host cell translation machinery (e.g., programmed frameshifting, leaky termination, shunting, reinitiation after a long ORF). Some of these viral ''tricks'' (e.g., IRESs, and perhaps shunting) have evolved to enable efficient viral protein synthesis to proceed despite the virus-induced shutdown of host cell protein synthesis, and, certainly in the case of IRESs, the discovery has proved highly relevant to mRNA translation in the uninfected host cell.",

It is not yet clear whether these events also occur in the translation of some cellular mRNAs. If they do, they certainly concern only a very limited number of cellular mRNAs, and without the clues provided by the viral examples as to the sequence and structure of the required RNA motifs, the task of identifying such cellular mRNAs would be like trying to find the proverbial needle in a field of haystacks. Even if they do not occur in any cellular mRNA, the viral mechanisms are always instructive, because they provide insights into issues such as why does reinitiation after a long ORF not normally occur with the vast majority of cellular mRNAs. Moreover, if the viral mRNA motifs directing leaky termination, frameshifting, or reinitiation after a long ORF, are absent from all essential cellular mRNAs, they provide potential targets for the development of novel antiviral agents targeted against the intracellular phase of the infectious process (although the high mutation rate of RNA viruses may well pose problems with this approach). Thus, while the ''tricks'' are essential for viral multiplication, they are also a potential Achilles heel.",
