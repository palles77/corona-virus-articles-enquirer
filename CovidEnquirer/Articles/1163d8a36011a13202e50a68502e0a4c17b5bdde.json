This rapid and unexpected event had enormous implications for infection preventionists (IP) internationally. Lessons learned from this event should guide future pandemic planning efforts. Methods: Focus groups were conducted at the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc, (APIC) 2009 conference to evaluate IPs' experience with the novel H1N1 influenza pandemic and assess their perceived needs related to novel H1N1 topics and products required for future education and reference materials. Results: Forty IPs (37 from the United States and 3 international) participated in the focus groups. Needed reference materials identified by attendees included infection prevention guidance for nonacute care settings; occupational health polices; and brief, multilanguage patient/family educational materials. Educational topics on which IPs need to be trained include isolation precautions/ personal protective equipment recommendations for novel H1N1 patients, coordination between hospitals and community response agencies, and surge management. The rapidly changing and conflicting recommendations related to patient management made responding to this event challenging. IPs require synthesized infection prevention guidelines developed in a concise, real-time format. Conclusion: IPs must continue to partner with public health and other response agencies to address gaps in pandemic planning.",

            "text": "Infection preventionists' experience during the first months of the 2009 novel H1N1 influenza A pandemic A novel strain of influenza A (H1N1) was identified in late April 2009. Within a single week, the World Health Organization (WHO) raised the pandemic phase from 3 to 5. The WHO pandemic phase 5 indicates that there is sustained human-to-human transmission of a pathogen in at least 2 countries and that a pandemic is likely imminent. 1 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported the first case of laboratory-confirmed novel H1N1 in the United States on April 15, 2009; a second case was reported 2 days later. 2 On April 22, the CDC activated its emergency operations center in response to the novel H1N1 outbreak; 4 days later, on April 26th, the CDC declared a public health emergency. 2 Early cases were identified in Texas and California, but the outbreak soon spread widely across the United States. By May 3, 2009 , the CDC deployed 25% of the Strategic National Stockpile to aid states in responding to this event. On June 11, 2009, the novel H1N1 outbreak was officially declared a pandemic by the WHO. 3 Infection preventionists (IP) were on the frontlines during the early phase of the novel H1N1 outbreak, helping health care agencies develop policies and procedures to respond to this rapidly evolving event. The surge of infected individuals and ''worried well'' taxed hospitals and health care agencies around the world. Prior to being declared a pandemic, the novel H1N1 outbreak grew exponentially in the weeks prior to the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, Inc, (APIC) 2009 Annual Educational Conference and International Meeting. This unexpected outbreak had enormous implications for IPs internationally because infection prevention guidance related to novel H1N1 patient management, such as recommendations on isolation and personal protective equipment (PPE) usage, came out sporadically from various organizations, including the WHO and CDC and health departments across the United States. The IPs who responded to this event in the early months of the outbreak had unique experiences that may provide lessons learned for other IPs and should guide future pandemic planning efforts.",

As one participant noted, ''all the information that came out was basically for schools or acute care.'' Other participants stated that it was difficult to know how to manage novel H1N1 patients in this setting without guidance: One specific occupational health issue that focus group participants felt needs to be addressed is how to manage or prevent ill health care providers coming to work sick. As one participant stated, ''As much as you tell [health care workers] not to come to work sick, they still come.. We cannot allow employees to work sick, even with seasonal flu.'' Money may be one potential reason that employees may work when sick. As one participant explained it, ''Sometimes people will say, \u00d4I can't afford not to work.\u00d5 '' Another focus group participant agreed and added, ''It's hard to keep people off work when they are sick.'' Focus group participants indicated that more administrative support and better human resource policies are needed related to furloughing staff and sick leave practices during pandemics. As one participant explained it,''We need [administrator's] support in saying that, when people are exhibiting symptoms, then they can't work in patient care.'' Another participant agreed and added, ''Of course the hospitals don't want to hear that you're not going to let the staff work.'' One focus group member stated that her human resource department was hesitant to furlough employees due to novel H1N1 because it would cost the hospital money. She was told by human resources, ' compensation] would not cover occupational exposures to [novel H1N1] because it's also out in the community.'' There was also some confusion about and hesitancy to enforce the CDC-recommended 7-day furlough period for staff infected with novel H1N1. As one participant stated,''We had more people who wanted to come back sooner than 7 days.'' Occupational health issues were present in the community, as well. Companies were hesitant to allow employees to return to work without some reassurance from the medical community that the employee was no longer contagious. As one participant explained, ''We had employers calling up the emergency departments and saying, \u00d4I want this person tested, and they need to have a negative before we're going to allow them to come back to work.\u00d5 '' This created a lot of extra and unnecessary work for hospitals and health care agencies.",

Another agreed and added, ''From 8 o'clock in the morning until 4 o'clock, [the recommendations were] totally different.''

Many focus group participants reported that they believe health care workers will be more eager to get vaccinated for influenza this year than in previous years. One participant stated, ''What I'm thinking of are those employees who refuse to ever get the flu shot.. When the H1N1 vaccine comes out, I know they're going to be the first in line.'' This increased compliance with seasonal influenza vaccine is already occurring in areas outside the United States. As one participant explained, ''It's our flu season now in Australia, and what we've found is that those people who usually don't want the flu vaccination are now standing at the door wanting flu vaccine.''",

Other focus group participants described difficulties with the screening process, especially related to the large number of visitors and numerous entrances to facilities. As one participant stated, ''I'm envious of the people who were able to screen visitors. We're not that large-we only have 650 beds-but the visitor traffic [was overwhelming]. We have about 20 entrances to the hospital.'' Another participant agreed and added, ''From our parking deck, [visitors] can get into the hospital at 3 or 4 different levels.'' Solutions recommended by the focus group members to help control and screen visitors included locking the main entrances so people can exit but not enter without being screened and having security professionals or volunteers conduct visitor screening. Phone triage was another strategy emphasized by numerous focus group participants as being an essential component of pandemic planning because it reduces unnecessary traffic in the hospital emergency department for patient screening. Two participants described their experience with phone triage as follows:",

Whenever possible, reference materials need to be translated into multiple languages so that all health care clientele can access this information. Pandemic planning educational and reference materials identified by the focus group participants need to be generated and made available as soon as possible, given the potential resurgence of novel H1N1 or concomitant outbreaks of seasonal influenza and novel H1N1 in fall/winter 2009. The novel H1N1 pandemic illustrates the need for IPs to find new ways of controlling surge and preventing secondary health care-associated transmission during an infectious disease outbreak. Historically, IPs have been concerned primarily about hospitals and acute care settings. The novel H1N1 pandemic demonstrates the need to implement infection prevention strategies in all health care settings, including ambulatory care centers, physician offices, home health, and long-term care. Infection prevention emergency management guidance for these nonacute care settings has been lacking. It is essential that infection prevention recommendations be developed for these settings to help control disease spread and ultimately prevent and control surge in hospitals. One essential component of these recommendations is the identified need for a stronger focus on occupational health. Staff surge capacity is necessary to maintain functionality of health care facilities during pandemics, and healthy staff contributes strongly to sustaining this capacity. Occupational health issues that need to be addressed include having policies and procedures for screening/ triaging staff, furloughing employees, and better sick leave practices to prevent ill health care providers from coming to work sick during pandemics.",

This could lead to secondary transmission in health care facilities and occupational exposures. Health care professionals should be told that outbreaks of emerging infectious diseases, such as novel H1N1, are expected to bring rapidly changing case definitions, surveillance methodologies, and control measures.

Focus group participants also reported that the potentially unnecessary use of N95 respirators caused much confusion for staff and resulted in a shortage of supplies in their facilities, according to those who participated in the focus groups. These focus groups occurred the week before the World Health Organization officially declared the novel H1N1 outbreak a pandemic, yet hospitals were already running out of supplies-even after regional and national stockpiles were deployed. One quarter of all focus group participants' facilities ran out of respiratory protection supplies during the spring of 2009, and almost one quarter needed to implement a reuse policy for respirators to conserve limited resources.

IPs must continue to address gaps in pandemic planning. One way to accomplish this is through the creation and distribution of IP-specific educational tools and reference materials for emergency management. The topics identified by IPs who experienced the first wave of the 2009 novel H1N1 influenza A pandemic should be used as the basis for these new educational initiatives.",
