Using fluorescent reporters for FACS-based sorting, we generated 28 homogenously fluorescent hAEC cultures that differentiate normally after lentiviral transduction. As 29 proof-of-principle, we demonstrate that host gene expression can be modulated post-differentiation 30 via inducible short hairpin (sh)RNA-mediated knockdown. Importantly, functional characterization of 31 these transgenic hAEC cultures with exogenous poly(I:C), as a proxy for virus infection, 32 demonstrates that such modifications do not influence the host innate immune response. Moreover, 33 the propagation kinetics of both human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and human respiratory 34 syncytial virus (RSV) were not affected.

This is further corroborated by the uniform reduction of 531 GFP expression by shGFP1 in our double transgenic hAECs, in which the MFI of GFP fluorescence is 532 reduced by approximately 40%. Due to low inoculation dose (MOI 0.1), we hypothesize that the 533 amount of shRNA targeting the viral GFP mRNA transcript simply is not sufficient to achieve a 534 pronounced reduction of the logarithmic increase of viral replication. Adaptation of the inoculation 535 dosage or even the Polymerase III promoter in the lentiviral vector to achieve a higher cellular 536 concentration of shRNA might reveal a different phenotype. It has been reported that the viral 537 nucleoprotein of HCoV-229E counteracts RNA silencing [44] , which might also be the case for hRSV, 538 rendering our shRNA ineffective against these viruses.

After transduced cells have been expanded in monolayer, they must be sorted by flow 287 cytometry and re-expanded. Only after that, can the cells be seeded on porous inserts and 288 liquid-liquid interface (LLI) established. Once confluent, the apical medium is aspirated, establishing 289 ALI. By incorporating the necessary transduction, expansion and sorting steps, transgenic 290 tracheobronchial cells cannot be seeded in LLI before monolayer passage three. However, since 291 differentiated hAEC cultures cannot be reliably established after monolayer passage two due to 292 cellular senescence and loss of differentiation potential [16] we had to devise a method that would 293 prolong the lifespan of primary human cells in monolayer culture to allow for lentiviral transduction, 294 expansion and eventual cell sorting. 295 Treatment of both bronchial and cervical epithelial cells with a commercially available 296 Rho-associated protein kinase (ROCK) inhibitor, Y-27632, has been shown to induce a basal 297 epithelial cell phenotype, thereby preserving the differentiation capabilities of human epithelial cells in 298 vitro [18]. We therefore assessed the differentiation potential of Y-27632 treated primary human 299 bronchial cells in our ALI conditions. Indeed, when these cells were treated with 10 increased expression of alpha6-integrin and neural growth factor receptor (NGFR), 301 common basal cell markers, compared to non-treated cells in later passage (Figure 2A). The 302 up-regulation of these basal cell markers indicates that the epithelial basal cell phenotype is induced 303 in treated cells, prolonging their life span and differentiation capabilities in vitro. Furthermore, hAEC 304 cultures established with treated cells showed the same cellular composition as non-treated cells up 305 to passage (p) 4, as measured by the expression of tubulin (ciliated cells), Mucin 1 (goblet cells), and 306 NGFR (basal cells) (",

Treatment of primary tracheobronchial cells with 318 Y-27632 results in slightly lower transduction efficacies under the same conditions (5-30% and 319 30-60%, figure 2D, bottom). Interestingly, even when a basal phenotype has been induced in all three 320 donors the donor variability is still present and slightly exaggerated compared to na\u00efve cultures 321 (Figure 2D). These results indicate that the modification of our protocol, namely, treatment of primary 322 human bronchial cells with Y-27632, induces a prolonged basal cell phenotype in our primary human 323 bronchial cells. This will accommodate the additional passages required for cellular expansion 324 post-lentiviral transduction and cell sorting to establish homogenously transgenic hAEC cultures.
