The objective of this paper is to establish a mathematical model for describing the mechanism of viruses diffusion in a facemask during breathing cycles. In this model the mechanisms of the water vapor molecular diffusion, evaporation/ condensation, sorption/desorption of moisture by fibers, Brownian diffusion of the virus, filtration of virus, capillary penetration of the viruses with the liquid water and latent heat generation due to phase change are considered. Meanwhile, the theoretical predictions are compared with experimental data, and good agreement is observed between the two, indicating that the model is satisfactory. Also, the effects of structural and materials properties on virus transfer are investigated.",

[3] investigated bacterial penetration of different bacterial shapes, aerodynamic sizes, and flow rates through a surgical mask and a dust/mist respirator. The authors found that the spherical corn oil particles and spherical bacteria have the same penetration in size range from 0.9 to 1.7 lm, while rod-shaped bacteria penetrate less, depending on the aspect ratio of bacteria. Qian et al. [4] further studied the penetration efficiency of N95 respirators for airborne microbial and inert 0017 particles. Using laboratory tests with NaCl certification aerosols and measurements with particle-size spectrometers, N95 respirators were found to have higher filtration efficiency than DM and DFM respirators and non-certified surgical masks. The authors concluded that N95 respirators provide excellent protection against airborne particles when there is good face seal.",

A N95 mask that can filter out particles down to 0.3 lm can obviously filter out droplets greater in size. However, SARS corona viruses are irregularly shaped and are about 60-120 nm in diameter. Therefore, viruses may be able to penetrate or spread through the mask in the form of liquid diffusion by a capillary effect, particularly since the expired air will most likely wet the mask. The high moisture content and high temperature in the expired air can cause water vapor to condense in the mask due to the temperature difference between the air and the mask. The droplets that are expelled when speaking will accelerate the wetting process. The action of breathing will mechanically reinforce the penetration. ",

This process is a typical physical process of coupled heat and mass transfer in porous materials such as non-woven textile materials. As viruses and bacteria can stay on the surface and in the masks for significantly long time period during wear, it is obviously dangerous and undesirable if they can live comfortably and stay active in the warm and humid microenvironment in the masks. In order to avoid these phenomena, it is necessary to study the transfer mechanisms of the virus or bacteria in the mask and to supervise the design and usage of the mask according to these mechanisms. Heat and mass transfer in porous textiles is a complicated process involving simultaneous coupled multi-field change. There are many references for utilized mathematical model to describe the heat and mass transfer mechanisms in porous media. Ogniewicz and Tien [5] reported an analysis with assumption that heat is transported by conduction and convection, the condensate is in pendular state. Motakef and El-Masri [6] and Shapiro and Motakef [7] extended the analysis to consider mobile condensates. More recently, heat and mass transfer in wet porous media in presence of evaporationcondensation was recently revisited analytically by Bouddour et al. [8] using the homogenization method of asymptotic for periodic structure. The inertia effects and boundary on flow and heat transfer in porous media were investigated by Vafai and Tien [9] . They discovered the Darcy model is not valid at high flow velocity. Amiri and Vafai [10] studied the dispersion effects of forced convection on heat transfer. In these studies, the researchers focused mainly on materials that do not absorb moisture vapor.",

Luo et al. [13] presented a dynamic model of heat and moisture transfer with sorption and condensation in porous clothing assemblies.

The boundary condition is determined by the relative humidity of the air surrounding a fiber at x. It is known that in flow through a porous medium the pressure drop caused by frictional drag is directly proportional to velocity for low speed flow. At higher velocities, inertial effects become appreciable, causing an increase in the form drag. As Vafai and Tien [9] pointed that the pressure drop in the bulk of porous medium is proportional to a linear combination of flow velocity and square of the flow velocity. The square term is caused by the inertial effects offered through the solid matrix, it is a function of Reynolds number and geometry of porous media. In the present case, the gas velocity during normal breathing cycles is small and the pore size of mask N95 and fiber radius are small, so the Reynolds number is small (Re max is about 3). Therefore, the inertial effects can be ignored. Therefore, we can assume the relationship of pressure drop and velocity satisfies the Darcy\u00d5s law:",

[23] . Briefly, an in vivo wear filtration efficiency trial was carried by using human subjects. In the trial, each subject was asked to put on a N95 facemask and started to perform walking exercise. The researcher sprayed the simulated viral solution onto the facemask once at a distance 1 m every 10 min. The simulated viral solution was sprayed on the mask seven times during the walking in total. The average weight of the splash in one stroke of spray was 2 ml. The simulated viral solution was made up with KCl (potassium chloride) water solution, in which the K + concentration is 0.02 g/cm 3 . Seventy minutes later K + content of each layer was obtained. Further, the relative K + content of each layer to K + content of the whole mask was calculated by dividing the K + content of each layer with the sum of K + content of all layers for each mask. All the percentages were used as the basis for analysis of the test results for four layers of N95 masks. The initial and boundary\u00d5s conditions in simulation are listed in Table 1 . The computation parameters are listed in Table 2 . We simulated above progress and the comparisons of the simulation and the experimental results of the N95 mask in the relative K + content in each layer are shown in Fig. 4 .",

We can see the variation progress of the liquid water fraction by the capillary pressure and evaporation. Since the contact angle is large and the effective radius of the capillary is small, the diffusion velocity of the liquid water is slow. The liquid water of outer surface evaporates quickly since the relative humidity of the environment is slow. Liquid water appears on the inner surface due to the condensation from high humidity of air breathed out. Fig. 8 shows the K + content in the liquid water. We can see the K + content on outer surface is the highest at the beginning of the splash, gradually diffuses in wards. Fig. 9 shows the distribution of atmospheric pressure during breathing. The pressure increases quickly in the process of breathing out because the effect of resistance of the mask to air flow and opposite trend can be seen during the process of breathing in. The pressure changes periodically with the breathing cycles. As shown in Fig. 10 , the concentration of water vapor varies periodically with the breathing cycles. When a person breathes out the air, the water vapor concentration increases, and then, the water vapor concentration decreases during the breathing in process. Fig. 11 shows the temperature distribution. The temperature change is controlled by convective heat transfer and the evaporation/condensation of water. The temperature on the inner surface increases gradually, as the body temperature is higher than that of mask. The tem-perature on the outer surface decreases as the liquid water evaporates and heat is adsorbed. Meanwhile, the temperature changes periodically with the breathing cycles. When a person breathes out the air, the water vapor concentration on the surface of the fibers is increased and the relative humidity of air is increase, so that water vapor condenses and releases the latent heat. Also, the air convective heat transfer occurs during breathing cycles. When the person breathes in the air, the opposite occurs. ",
