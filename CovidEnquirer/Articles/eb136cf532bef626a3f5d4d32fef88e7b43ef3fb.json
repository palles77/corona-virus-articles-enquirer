The enzymes involved in the maturation of cell surface and intracellular N-glycans are found in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex where they act upon newly synthesized glycoproteins to generate an array of different structures from a common oligosaccharide precursor (18). The N-glycan processing pathway consists of three stages : (a) the initial synthesis of a dolichol-linked precursor oligosaccharide and the en bloc transfer of the oligosaccharide to newly synthesized polypeptide Asn-X-Ser/Thr sequons on the lumenal face of the ER; (b) the trimming of the high mannose structures by a-glucosidases and a-mannosidases in the ER and Golgi complex; and (c) the elaboration of the branched oligosaccharide chains by Golgi glycosyltransferases . The trimming phase of the pathway is accomplished by a-glucosidases I and II as well as a collection of processing a1,2-mannosidases (29) in the ER and Golgi complex.

The trimming and elongation phases ofthe pathway overlap at the GnT I/Man II steps, with each reaction being obligatory for further processing steps. GnT I is essential for processing to hybrid or complex type structures (34) , while the absence of Man II activity, either by inhibition with the alkaloid, swainsonine (52) , or in the human autosomal genetic disease hereditary erythroblastic multinuclearity associated with positive acidified serum (HEMPAS), characterized by the reduced expression of Man 11 (12) , results in the accumulation of Asn-linked hybrid oligosaccharides in lieu of the standard array of complex type structures . The cleavage of glycoprotein processing in-termediates by Man II also confers resistance to cleavage by endoglycosidase H, a commonly used marker for transit through the Golgi complex (42) . A number of the mammalian Golgi glycosyltransferases havebeen cloned recently (1, 7, 17, 21, 25, 32, 45, 46, 53, 56) allowing a comparison of the polypeptide structures and the ability to examine the regulation of transferase expression in relation to terminal oligosaccharide processing events. Among these enzymes a common domain motifhas been described (37) of a type II transmembrane structure with a small NHz-terminal cytoplasmic tail, a single transmembrane domain, a variable stem region, and a large 000Hterminal catalytic domain . Among the processing hydrolases, only an a-mannosidase presumably responsible for the removal of a single a1,2-mannosyl linkage in the ER has been fully cloned (2) . This enzyme bears no resemblance to the glycosyltransferase domain structure, but it does share extensive homology to the yeast vacuolar a-mannosidase. Both enzymes contain no classical signal sequence or membrane-spanning domain. Characterization of the primary structures and molecular aspects of the early processing steps therefore await the cloning and characterization of the remainder of the processing a-glucosidases and a-mannosidases .",

Release of a 110AD catalytically active soluble form of the enzyme can be accomplished by a mild chymotrypsin digestion of permeabilized or solubilized Golgi membranes (28) . The chymotrypsin-cleaved form ofthe enzyme has been purified and is catalytically indistinguishable from the intact enzyme (30) , while it differs in NH,-terminal sequence and hydrophobic character. NHz-terminal sequence data from the 110-kD soluble form of the enzyme along with internal peptide sequences have allowed us to generate a Man II-specific cDNA probe by mixed oligonucleotide-primed amplification of cDNA (26) . A partial cDNA clone was isolated from an oligo(dT)-primed rat liver cDNA library which spanned -40% of the Man II open reading frame . We present here the isolation of cDNA clones which span the entire open reading frame and much of the 5' and 3'untranslated regions of Man II from a random-and oligo(dT)-primed murine cDNA library. The open reading frame confirms the map of peptide sequence data from the purified rat protein demonstrating that Man II conforms to the domain structure model common among the Golgi glycosyltransferases . Transient expression of a full length murine Man II cDNA clone in COS cells directs the overexpression of enzyme activity and the synthesis of immunoreactive material in a perinuclear membrane array consistent with the localization of the Man II polypeptide in the Golgi complex of the transfected cells.

The 5' untranslated region is G/C rich (68%), a characteristic common to several of the Golgi glycosyltransferases (46, 53) and also a common feature among housekeeping genes (9) . Finally, the NHZ-terminal peptide sequence of the purified intact rat liver enzyme starts at residue 6 of the predicted open reading frame (30) . The purified enzyme is indistinguishable in size from the biosynthetically labeled 3T3 enzyme (27) and the enzyme detected by Western blots from freshly prepared Golgi membrane extracts (27), but the cleavage of five residues would be too small a change to detect on SDS gels during purification . Although the cleavage of the five residue cytoplasmic tail most likely reflects in vitro proteolysis during purification, it could also possibly represent the product of cleavage in vivo .",

Comparison of murine Man II protein sequence with the yeast vacuolar a-mannosidase and the rat ER a-mannosidase. Murine Man II was aligned with the yeast vacuolar a-mannosidase and the rat ER a-mannosidase using the FASTA program (54) . The sequences in the figure show the individual alignments of murine Man II (center sequence) with the yeast vacuolar a-mannosidase (59) (Yeast Man, upper sequence) and the rat ER a-mannosidase (24) (ER Man, lower sequence) . The vertical bar indicates amino acid identities between the two lines of sequence . The double dots indicate conservative amino acid substitutions between the two lines of sequence . The numbering below the aligned sequences refers to the polypeptide numbering of 3T3 Man II in Fig . 2 . When the indicated sequence pairs were subjected to statistical analysis using the Bestfit program from the University of Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (comparison versus randomized sequences with the same amino acid content, gap weight = 3, gap length weight = 0.1) the sequence alignments were found to be 9 .7 and 6.0 SDs above random for the Man II/yeast vacuolar a-mannosidase pair and the Man II/ER a-mannosidase, respectively. biosynthetic product . The doublet likely results from the glycosylation of Asn residue 1,129 and a partial glycosylation at Asn residues 78 or 93, since the purified soluble form of the rat liver enzyme (residues 107-1,150) has been shown to be fully glycosylated at a single site (30) . The apparent molecular weight on SDS gels is slightly less than is predicted for the open reading frame of the cDNA (rv117 kD vs 131 kD for the deglycosylated forms, respectively) . This presumably results from an anomalous gel migration since the in vitro translation product and the product of biosynthetic labeling run at an identical position by SDS-PAGE . Translation in the presence of membranes also resulted in the apparent co-translational translocation of the polypeptide across the lipid bilayer. Trypsin cleavage of the in vitro translation products in the presence of microsomal membranes did not alter the amount or the mobility of the glycosylated form but the smaller in vitro-synthesized products were fully susceptible to digestion . The lack of a mobility shift following trypsin digestion also confirms the orientation in the membrane and the location of the membrane-spanning domain . These results are also consistent with the inability to detect any cytoplasmically oriented polypeptide in protease protection experiments in intact Golgi membranes (27) . Addition of membranes posttranslationally did not result in a significant production of glycosylated product suggesting a requirement for co-translational translocation of the enzyme .",

Comparison of the Man II polypeptide to a translated form of the GenBank database (GenPept, version 64 .3) revealed that a 215 amino acid region of Man II bears a statistically significant similarity to a corresponding region in the rat ER a-mannosidase (2) and the vacuolar ci-mannosidase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae (59) (6 .0 and 9 .7 SDs above random, Fig . 4) . The rat ER a-mannosidase and the yeast vacuolar a-mannosidase share extensive homology across their entire length (2), whereas Man II shares a more limited similarity within a region of the soluble catalytic domain of the enzyme . All three enzymes recognize a-mannoside linkages and cleave the synthetic substrates p-nitrophenyl a-Dmannoside and 4-methylumbelliferyl a-D-mannoside, but differ in their specificity toward natural high mannose oligosaccharides, inhibition by alkaloid inhibitors, antibody crossreactivity, and subcellular-_Iocalization (2, 29, 59, 60) .

Most other tissues resulted in an autoradiographic band of -3-10-fold lesser intensity except skeletal muscle which was undetectable except with prolonged exposure. The ratio of the multiple Man II message species appeared constant across the range of rat tissues despite the >100-fold difference in the level ofexpression between adrenal and muscle tissues. Comparison with the rat ER a-mannosidase (2), reveals that while the Man II transcript is most abundant in adrenal and thymus, the ER enzyme has a highest abundance level in adrenal and testis and minor differences in other tissues except spleen, intestinal epithelia, and muscle tissues which have a slightly reduced level ofmessage. The differences with Man II message expression in the thymus, testis, and muscle suggests that there is a differential tissue expression of the two a-mannosidases at least in these tissues . A low but detectable level of Man II message was also found in rat brain tissues consistent with a report of reduced levels of Man II activity in rat brain and the presence of a novel brain a-mannosidase (51) which is not sensitive to inhibitionby swainsonine and is able to directly cleave high mannose structures to Man3GlcNAc2 without the prior addition of a G1cNAc residue by GnT I. Whether the message levels adequately reflect the levels of the Man II enzyme activity in the brain or inthe other tissues remains to be determined. Although there is a >100-fold difference in Man II autoradiographic intensity on Northern blots between thymus and muscle, it is also not clear if this merely reflects the biosynthetic level and the degree of elaboration of the Golgi complex and the secretory pathway/glycosylation machinery in the respective tissue types .",

The antibodies have also been used recently as a marker for Golgi membrane components in cell trafficking studies (8, 22; and C. Zuber, A. Nakano, K. W. Moremen and J. Roth, manuscript submitted for publication) . Preliminary studies have shown that the antibody raised to the rat enzyme does not cross react with the COS cell enzyme (data not shown) allowing a minimal immunofluorescence background in the host cells. Transfection of COS cells with the pXM construct containing the Man II insert in the sense orientation (MII-pXM) resulted in an anti-Man II immunofluorescence pattern within 24 h ofthe initiation oftransfection. The immunofluorescence was largely restricted to a crescent shaped reticular pattern adjacent to the nucleus, but occasionally this reticular structure would extend well into the cytoplasm (Fig. 7, A and B ). This pattern of immunofluorescence has been previously shown to be characteristic ofthe Golgi complex (22, 31, 44) . Mock transfections, transfections with vector alone, or with the Man II insert in the antisense orientation resulted in no detectable immunofluorescence signal (data not shown) . Similarly, immunofluorescence offixed but not permeabilized cells transfected with MII-pXM resulted in no detectable fluorescence signal . The transfection efficiency ofthe MII-pXM construct, as measured by thepercentage of fluorescence-positive cells, was variable, but ranged from 5-25 R . By 36 h posttransfection the intensity of the peri-nuclear immunofluorescence increased substantially with many cells generating an additional diffuse particulate pattern of fluorescence in the cytoplasm consistent with ER staining (8, 22, 31) (Fig. 7 , C-E) . By 48 h postuansfection immunofluorescence staining adjacent to the nucleus remained intense but the particulate cyto- The human chromosome compliment of each hybrid was compared with the ability to generate the 178-bp human Man II amplification fragment following PCR. Concordant segregationof the amplification fragment was observed only for chromosome 5. All other chromosomes were excluded as the site for the Man II gene by discordancies in at least 15 hybrids . Hybrid clones containing the indicated chromosome in at least 5% of the cells were considered positive for the chromosome in the discordancy analysis . plasmic staining greatly increased . With the high level of Man II synthesis late in the transient expression, detection of early biosynthetic intermediates in the ER or an accumulation of aggregated enzyme in the ER might be expected.",

Amplification with hamster genomic DNA resulted in a faint band at 178 pb that was distinguishable from the human amplification product both in quantity and by the absence ofthe HindIII and EcoRI sites characteristic of the human Man II genomic sequence.

            "text": "Several lines of evidence indicate that the isolated cDNA clone MII-8 encodes the authentic Man II polypeptide. The NH2-terminal sequence of the intact purified enzyme aligns to amino acid position 6 of the translated cDNA at the junction of the cytoplasmic tail and the transmembrane domain. Whether the cleavage of the five amino acids segment represents an in vivo or in vitro event is difficult to determine since it is not possible to distinguish the cleaved from uncleaved forms based on size. The remaining six rat polypeptide sequences can be identified in the translation of the murine cDNA with several conservative amino acid substitutions between the two species . The Man II cDNA clone transcribed and translated in vitro was found to yield a polypeptide identical in size, glycosylation pattern, and topology in microsomal membranes to the rat liver (28) or biosynthetically labeled 3T3 enzyme (27) . Expression of the Man II cDNA in COS cells resulted in a 8-12-fold overexpression of enzyme activity with the same pH optimum, sensitivity to inhibition by swainsonine, and crossreactivity with the anti-rat Man II antibody as the endogenous 3T3 enzyme (27). Finally, the enzyme expressed in COS cells was localized by immunofluorescence to a perinuclear membrane array characteristic of the Golgi complex suggesting an appropriate localization of the transfected cDNA translation product . The open reading frame predicts a type II transmembrane topology with a 5 amino acid cytoplasmic tail, a single transmembrane domain, a \"stem\" region of at least 80 amino acids based on proteolysis studies, and a 1,044 amino acid catalytic domain.

Transmembrane topologies of plasma membrane and ER proteins are quite varied (55) suggesting thatthere is no obvious selective advantage of a single topology for membrane protein function. Many of the Golgi glycosyltransferases (37) , as well as Man II (28) , retain full catalytic activity when released from their membrane anchoring domains by selective proteolysis either in vivo or in vitro suggesting that the cleaved regions exert little, if any, influence on the catalytic activities of these enzymes . The conservation of topological features between the collection of Golgi glycosyltransferases and a processing hydrolase, Man II, might therefore suggest a functional role for the common domain structure beyond a simple attachment ofthe catalytic domain to the membrane surface. One function that has been proposed (37) for the \"stem\" region is to confer flexibility to the catalytic domains ofthe Golgi enzymes in order to allow accessibility to lumenal and membrane associated substrates. Although this hypothesis provides a logical resolution to the problem of substrate accessibility, evidence for this \"hinge\" or \"stem\" has yet to be demonstrated either in vitro or in vivo. A Golgi GDPase from S. cereWsiae (57) which cleaves the soluble substrate GDP in the yeast Golgi lumen has recently been cloned and sequenced (C. Abeijon, K. Yanagisawa, K. W. Moremen, C. B. Hirschberg, and P W Robbins, unpublished results) and was found to contain a similar type II transmembrane structure . Since this enzyme presumably cleaves only soluble substrates it would suggest that the conserved topological features of Golgi enzymes might have a function distinct from providing flexibility to the catalytic domain.",

The tetrapeptide recognition signal, KDEL, on the COOH termini of soluble, lumenal ER proteins results in their recognition and retention in the ER (31) . Recently, a recognition signal for ER type I transmembrane proteins has also been described (16, 33, 36, 47) with the recognition sequence KKXX at the COOH termini of the polypeptide sequences being recognized on the cytoplasmic face of the ER (47) . Deletions in the first of three transmembrane domains of the avian coronavirus El glycoprotein disrupted the cis-Golgi localization of this polypeptide suggesting that a membraneassociated region contains at least a portion of the information of Golgi targeting of this viral glycoprotein (23) . The Golgi cisternae have an additional level of complexity, however, since many of the endogenous Golgi enzymes exhibit distinctive sub-Golgi compartmentation . The mechanistic requirements necessary to yield these subtle differences in Golgi localization may therefore be more complex than the simple linear sequences involved in ER protein retention.",

All three enzymes recognize the small synthetic The Journal of Cell Biology, Volume 115, 1991 substrates, p-nitrophenyl a-D-mannoside and 4-methylumbelliferyl a-D-mannoside, although with different Ks (29) . These results suggest that the region of similarity might reflect a portion of the catalytic domain involved in a-mannoside recognition . The mammalian lysosomal a-mannosidase (5) also cleaves the small synthetic a-mannoside substrates and, like Man II, is inhibited by swainsonine. When the lysosomal enzyme is cloned and the sequence is determined a comparison with the consensus sequence of the other a-mannosidases would be a critical test of the function of the consensus sequence. A match in the proposed substrate recognition region between the three disparate mammalian a-mannosidases would provide strong evidence that this region is involved in the active site of the enzymes .",

The longest class of clones extends 2,543 by in the 3' direction from the end of the open reading frame before terminating in a poly(A) tract. Comparison between the longest aggregate clone sequence and the message size on Northern blots suggests that the predominant transcript likely reads through the region containing the three polyadenylation signals and uses a termination and polyadenylation signal an additional -1.4 kb further downstream. Repetitive element sequences were found in the long 3' untranslated region of both murine Man II and murine 51,4-galactosyltransferase (46) . Although this type of extended 3' untranslated region is common among the glycosyltransferases the functional significance of this extended transcript is not clear.",

As a first step we have presented the cloning and expression of murine Man II cDNA. In addition we have localized the human Man II gene to chromosome 5. Further characterization of full length human Man II cDNA and genomic clones should allow us to determine the molecular basis of the Man II deficiency in HEMPAS disease and the regulatory features of the processing enzymes responsible for these maturation of cellular and secreted N-glycans.",

This clone and several others in the open reading frame region were sequenced yielding the entire Man II open reading frame (3,550 bp) and 86 and 827 by of 5' and 3' untranslated sequence, respectively(Fig. 2).

Despite containing the entire Man II open reading frame and a poly(A) tail, clone MII-8 was N3 kb smaller than the predominant message size on Northern blots .

The 730 by EcoRl fragment on the 3' end ofclone MII-8 was used as a probe to re-screen the 3T3 cDNA library and an additional 16 independent clones were obtained.

The size of the aggregate clone sequence is in close agreement with the -6.1 kb minor message on Northem blots (seeFig . 5, lane 1). The heterogeneity in termination and polyadenylation within the 3' untranslated region suggests that the additional sequence necessary to generate the predominant -7.5-kb message will likely result from an extension of an additional x+1 .4 kb beyond the 3' end of the MII-48 clone sequence .",
