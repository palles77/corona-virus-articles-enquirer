Persistence in the LM-K cells was not accompanied by production of ts mutants or of soluble anti-MHV factors. Infectious center assay demonstrated an approximately 500-fold lower level of infectibility by MHV of the LM-K cells as compared to L-2 cells. On an infected cell basis, production levels of infectious progeny and viral RNA were comparable between the two cell lines. The extent of virusinduced cell-cell fusion, however, was markedly reduced in the LM-K cells. Cell-mixing experiments showed that both infected L-2 and LM-K cells have the capacity of fusing with neighboring uninfected L-2 cells but not with uninfected LM-K cells. This suggests that the decreased level of fusion observed in the LM-K infection is due not to absence of viral fusion protein at the cell surface, but rather to an inherent resistance of the LM-K cell membrane to MHV-induced fusion. It is believed that such fusion resistance in LM-K cells moderates virus dissemination throughout the culture, thereby contributing to a state of virus persistence.",

Murine coronaviruses, exemplified by mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), are now known to contain three major structural proteins (Cheley and Anderson, 1981; Sturman, 1977) , of which the intravirion localizations (Sturman et al, 1980 ) as well as some intracellular activities (Collins et al, 1982; Holmes et aI., 1981) have been documented. In addition, significant advances have been made concerning the steps involved in RNA transcription, including the characterization of genomic and messenger RNA species (Cheley et aL, 1981a, b; Lai et aL, 1981; Leibowitz et al, 1981; Spaan et al, 1981; as well as the assignments of virus-specified structural and nonstructural polypeptides to individual messenger RNAs (Leibowitz et ah, 1982; Rottier et uZ., 1981; . Complementary DNA (cDNA) probes are now available (Cheley et uL, 1981a, b; Leibowitz and Weiss, 1981) which may be used for the detection and analysis of MHV RNA.",

For each timepoint assayed, aliquots were taken from three serial lo-fold dilutions of the RNA extracted from lo6 cells. In this way nonsaturating autoradiographic images of the viral RNA in at least one dilution of each sample could be obtained by the dot-blotting technique. In all cultures examined, background levels of viral RNA, i.e., up to 2 hr p.i., were extremely low (Fig. 2) , attesting to the high specificity of the probe for MHV-RNA. L cells inoculated at an m.o.i. of 10 showed significant viral RNA at 4 hr p.i.; this increased considerably by 6 hr p.i. before dropping off somewhat by (Fig. 2, lanes 2-5) . LM-K cultures inoculated with an m.o.i. of 10 showed a pattern of viral RNA synthesis most closely resembling that seen in L cells inoculated with an m.o.i. of 0.01, i.e., a lOOOfold lesser inoculum than that used for the LM-K cells. This value is in reasonably good agreement with the difference in infectability of the two cell lines as determined by infectious center assay (Table 1) . There would, therefore, appear to be no great difference in the levels of viral RNA synthesis, on an infected-cell basis, between the two cell lines. The similarity in viral RNA levels between LM-K (m.o.i. = 10) and L (m.o.i. = 0.01) cells is most striking during the first 16-20 hr p.i., which approximately represents the time required for one cycle of virus growth (Cheley et al, 1981b) . Densitometric analysis of the dot blots for these two cultures showed, in fact, levels of viral RNA comparable to within 40%, for each of the time points assayed between 6 and 20 hr p.i.",

            "text": "To test for the presence of viral structural proteins, including the protein responsible for cell fusion (Collins et al, 1982) , in MHV-infected L and LM-K cells, immunoprecipitation was performed on extracts prepared from cultures labeled with [35S]methionine at 8 hr p.i. As shown in Fig El (and precursor PEl), E2, and N, were present in both L and LM-K cells, in roughly similar proportions. Thus, the observed lack of fusion in MHV-infected LM-K cells is not likely due to defective synthesis of viral fusion protein. This viral fusion protein has been shown by Collins et al (1982) to be the E2 polypeptide. The addition of indicator L cells to sparse cultures of either infected L or LM-K cells resulted in rapid spread of fusion throughout the indicator cells. However, when LM-K cells were used as indicators, no fusion was observed (Fig. 5) . This experiment shows that there is no lack of viral fusion protein at the LM-K cell surface. We, therefore, conclude that the difference in syncytial formation between infected L and LM-K cultures is due to resistance of uninfected LM-K cells to fusion with infected neighboring cells. This resistance must be due to an inherent property of the LM-K cell membrane. Such a conclusion is also inferred by observations made earlier (Fig.  3) , namely that syncytia in infected LM-K cultures remain narrow and show little radial expansion when compared to infected L cultures. tent infection of MHV: a reduced level of infectability and a resistance to undergoing syncytial formation, when in contact with MHV-infected cell neighbors. It is apparent that MHV persistence in LM-K cells involves a dynamic balance between infected and noninfected cells. Persistence is, therefore, a feature of the entire culture and not of individual cells. The observed reduced levels of cell fusion in MHV-infected LM-K (as contrasted with L) cell cultures would act as a dissemination-limiting factor, thus contributing to the continued survival of remaining uninfected cells. Survival of uninfected cells is also assured as a result of the relatively higher resistance of LM-K cells to MHV infection. Results presented in this study show that MHV, even at an m.o.i. of 10 (determined on L cells) can only infect about 1% of inoculated LM-K cells. Levels of circulating virus (of the order of 10' PFU/ml) would, therefore, be inadequate to ensure infection of a substantial proportion of all LM-K cells in culture (ca. lo6 cells/culture in the present study).",

Although viral protein was not quantitated in the present study, it is apparent that sufficient quantities are produced in LM-K cells to yield normal virus outputs (compared to L cells). In addition, all three MHV structural proteins are present in infected LM-K cells as well as L cells, as demonstrated by immunoprecipitation. It is also apparent that adequate amounts of viral fusion protein are synthesized and expressed on the surface of infected LM-K cells to induce cell fusion with a \"fusion-permissive\" cell line, i.e., the L cell.
