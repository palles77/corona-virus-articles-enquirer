We now know that the enzyme responsible for this effect is cystathionine-\u2424synthase (CBS), a pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme, expressed in various cells of the liver, kidney and the nervous system, where it plays a role in cysteine biosynthesis and degradation [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . CBS is unique among the PLP-dependent enzymes, as it also carries a N-terminal heme prosthetic group coordinated by Cys52 and His65 residues [7, 8] . Although heme is not required for enzymatic activity, its presence can affect its catalytic activity serving as a redox sensor. The C-terminal region of CBS exerts an autoinhibitory function by partially shielding the active site that can be alleviated by S-adenosyl methionine binding [7, 8] .",

Aminooxyacetic acid (AOAA) is commonly referred to as a selective CBS inhibitor, even though it also inhibits another H 2 S-producing enzyme, cystathionine-gamma lyase (CSE) [20] as well as several transaminases [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Previous efforts to identify CBS inhibitors from commercially available libraries yielded compounds with relatively low potency and limited CBS selectivity [26, 27] . For instance, a recent high-throughput tandem-microwell assay identified 1,6-dimethyl-pyrimido [5,4- e]-1,2,4-triazine-5,7(1H,6H)-dione (NSC67078) as a CBS inhibitor, which, however, also inhibited CSE with a potency that was only 3-fold lower [27] . In a further effort to identify CBS inhibitors, we have conducted a screen of a composite library of 8871 drugs and well-annotated pharmacological compounds. The screen identified several CBS inhibitors including benserazide. Additional studies demonstrated that benserazide is an effective inhibitor of colon cancer cell proliferation in vitro and tumor xenograft growth in vivo, suggesting its potential for therapeutic repurposing as an antitumor agent.",

This stand-alone robotic system is comprises of a plate washer (EL406, Biotek, Winooski, VT), a dispenser (MicroFlo, Biotek, Winooski, VT), a pipetting station (Precision, Biotek, Winooski, VT), an incubator (Cytomat 2C, Thermo Electron Corporation, Asheville, NC) and plate reader (Synergy 2, Biotek, Winooski, VT) connected with a robotic arm (Twister II, Caliper Life Sciences Inc, Hopkinton, MA). Test compounds, dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), were added to each well to yield a final concentration of 30 M (5% DMSO) in a total assay volume of 200 l. The assay solution contained Tris HCl (50 mM, pH 8.0), human recombinant full-length CBS (5 g/well), the CBS substrates l-cysteine and homocysteine (each at 2.0 mM final concentration), pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP), (5 M final concentration), and the H 2 S-specific fluorescent probe AzMc [26] (10 M final concentration). The 96 well plates were incubated at 37 \u2022 C, and the increase in the AzMc fluorescence in each well was read at 450 nm (ex = 365 nm) over a two-hour time course. A standard curve was generated using different concentrations of the H 2 S donor NaHS. The CBS inhibitors AOAA (30 M) [20] and NSC67078 (30 M) [27] (1,6-dimethyl-pyrimido[5,4-e]-1,2,4triazine-5,7(1H,6H)-dione; also known as toxoflavin, xanthothricin and PKF118-310) were used as positive controls.

The algorithm combines accurate ligand-receptor scoring, highly efficient combinatorial docking algorithms and core-hopping technology to design focused libraries and identify new scaffolds. Docking was performed using the IFD induced-fit docking protocol as implemented in Small-Molecule Drug Discovery Suite 2016 (Schrodinger Inc., Small-Molecule Drug Discovery Suite, 2016-1) [32] . The IFD algorithm involves the use of Glide and Prime modules for docking and refinement, respectively, and it enables modeling of structural changes in proteins as an effect of ligand binding. This is achieved by implementing an improved sampling approach where specific sidechain or backbone atoms are allowed to rearrange after iterative cycles of docking and protein refinement [33, 34] . In this case, the sidechains of Lys119 and Gln222 were trimmed and Van der Waals atom radii scaling were set to 1 for the protein and 0.8 for the docked ligands. Prior to calculations, the two PLP-benserazide derivatives were prepared in terms of correct protonation states, tautomerism and stereoisomerism using the LigPrep routine (Schrodinger Inc.). The crystal structure of human CBS (pdb id: 1JBQ) was utilized for docking calculations. Protein preparation was performed by the corresponding routine as implemented in Maestro (Schrodinger Inc.).

When a compound was represented in multiple libraries, it was positively identified as a potential hit compound multiple times, indicating the reliability of the screening assay.

Inhibitory effect of the two Table 3 ; full concentration-response curves shown in Fig. 2 . The structures of the six compounds (two reference compounds and four compounds identified by the screen as bona fide CBS inhibitors) are shown in Fig. 3 . The CBS inhibitory effect of hexachlorophene, tannic acid, aurintricarboxylic acid, and benserazide were also confirmed using the methylene blue assay, which detects H 2 S production by a different principle than the AzMC assay (Table 3) . Unexpectedly, the second reference compound CBS inhibitor NSC67078, in addition to inhibiting CBS-induced AzMC fluorescence with an IC 50 of \u223c1 M, also inhibited GYY6137induced AzMC fluorescence with an IC 50 of \u223c6 M (Table 3 , Fig. 2B) indicating that the observed inhibitory effects are due to a combination of direct CBS inhibition as well as H 2 S scavenging and/or interference with the assay used to detect H 2 S. While conducting confirmatory dose-response work with the four compounds identified as CBS inhibitors, we have noted the aqueous instability of benserazide: while freshly made solutions produced the inhibition depicted above, storage of benserazide stock solutions in aqueous media or DMSO diminished its activity. For instance, while freshly dissolved benserazide at 100 M inhibited CBS activity by 66 \u00b1 1%, after preparing stock solutions in PBS or DMSO and storing them at \u221220 \u2022 C for 1 week, its potency decreased to 45 \u00b1 4% or 53 \u00b1 3% inhibition of CBS activity, respectively, at 100 M (n = 3); these data are Table 2 List of potential hit compounds identified by the primary screening, and effect of the same compounds on GYY4137-induced fluorescence responses. Compounds were screened at 30 M (except for compounds indicated by asterisk, where testing was conducted at the indicated concentration) against CBS-induced AzMC fluorescence and re-tested at 30 M (except for compounds indicated by asterisk, where testing was conducted at the indicated concentration) against CBS-and GYY4137-induced AzMC fluorescence.

Cytotoxicity was assessed, in parallel, by the LDH release assay and the MTT assay. AOAA and NSC67078 concentration-dependently inhibited cell proliferation, with IC 50 values of 300 M and 0.3 M, respectively (Figs. 4 and 5) . The effect of NSC67078 was also associated with a suppression of MTT conversion (Fig. 5) . From the four compounds identified by the CBS screen, hexachlorophene (the least potent CBS inhibitor among the four identified hit compounds), did not affect HCT116 proliferation up to 3 M, but fully inhibited cell proliferation at 10 M (Fig. 6) . However, at this concentration, the compound also exerted cytotoxic effects, as indicated by the increase in LDH release (Fig. 6C) . The polyphenol tannic acid concentration-dependently inhibited proliferation, starting with 10 M; complete inhibition was seen at 100 M, without signs of cytotoxicity (Fig. 7) . Aurintricarboxylic acid, although it exhibited in vitro CBS inhibitory potency comparable to AOAA, did not inhibit cell proliferation at 10-100 M, while at 300 M increased cell proliferation (Fig. 8) . Although benserazide was less potent at inhibiting recombinant CBS than AOAA in the cell-free assay, it was more potent than AOAA in the proliferation assay. Benserazide inhibited the proliferation of HCT116 cells with a steep dose-response curve. Concentrations up to 10 M exerted no inhibitory effects, whereas at 30 M, benserazide completely inhibited HCT116 proliferation. and increased LDH release (Fig. 9) .",

As shown in Table 4 , all salts: copper(II) chloride; copper(II) acetate and copper(II) nitrate exhibited a potent inhibitory effect on recombinant CBS with an IC 50 \u223c 0.2 M. A lesser degree of inhibitory effect was also noted on GYY4137-elicited AzMC responses (\u223c15% inhibition at 1 M; IC 50 , \u223c1 M). In fact, the effects of the copper-containing compound ST012942 and the effects of CuCl 2 were overlapping, both on CBSand GYY4137-induced AzMC fluorescence values (Fig. 10) . To further investigate the role of CBS inhibition by copper we performed cell proliferation assay in the HCT116 cells. As shown in Fig. 11 , copper only inhibited HCT116 cells proliferation at the highest concentration tested (1 mM), which also decreased MTT conversion and LDH activity. The paradoxical reduction in LDH activity is most likely the result of the previously reported [37] direct inhibition of the LDH enzyme by copper ions. The major benserazide metabolite 2,3,4trihydroxybenzylhydrazine (THBH, also known as Ro 04-5127) also acted as a CBS inhibitor with potency comparable to benserazide (at 10, 30 and 100 M, it exerted a 31 \u00b1 2%, 51 \u00b1 2% and 82% inhibition of recombinant CBS activity, n = 3) and inhibited HCT116 cell proliferation in vitro at 10-300 M; it reduced MTT conversion at 300 M, but did not exert cytotoxic effects, as evidenced by a lack of significant increase of LDH concentrations in the cell culture medium (Fig. 12) .",

To gain insight to the putative mode of CBS inhibition by benserazide, docking calculations were performed by considering the two distinct PLPbenserazide derivatives that could be potentially formed, with either of them potentially representing the actual inhibitor of the protein (Fig. 13 ). Compound 1 (Fig. 13A, top) is the derivative of the coupling between the free amine of the unmodified benserazide with the formyl functionality of PLP while compound 2 (Fig. 13A, bottom) is the derivative obtained by reaction of the major benserazide metabolite 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzylhydrazine with the respective moiety of PLP. Both molecules are expected to be relatively kinetically stable, as the resulting Schiff bases carry an aromatic ring substitution. Compound 1 and Compound 2 were docked to the PLP-binding site of CBS using an induced-fit docking protocol enabling additional flexibility and enhanced sampling for modeling structural rearrangements of the target upon binding. Docking results showed that although both molecules adopted a highly identical geometry with respect to each other and the crystallographic free PLP cofactor, the PLP-benserazide derivative 1 was systematically bound demonstrating moderately higher docking scores than the corresponding PLP-trihydroxybenzylhydrazine derivative 2 with respective differences of \u223c1 kcal/mol (best pose score: 1, \u22129.91 kcal/mol; 2, \u22128.83 kcal/mol). On this basis, the higher affinity predicted for 1 was attributed to the interaction geometry that permitted formation of additional hydrophobic contacts with the protein environment as well as extensive hydrogen bonding interactions between the trihydroxybenzyl ring and polar residues located at the periphery of the cavity such as His203, Tyr223 and Tyr308 with respect to the corresponding, less-favorable interaction geometry of 2 (Fig. 13B,C) . While an equilibrium between the two different states of benserazide cannot be ruled out in the assay conditions, docking shows that the two molecules demonstrate a high structural convergence in terms of binding orientation.",

Reduction of the concentration of cysteine and homocysteine from 2 mM (our standard assay conditions) to 0.5 mM increased the inhibitory potency of benserazide.

For instance, under standard assay conditions, 100 M benserazide inhibited CBS activity by 66 \u00b1 1%, while under high substrate conditions, the same concentration of benserazide exerted a 10 \u00b1 2% inhibitory effect; n = 3) Benserazide was relatively selective as a CBS inhibitor, because CSE activity was only slightly affected (a 16 \u00b1 6% inhibition at 100 M; Benserazide, at 10 M, exerted an inhibitory effect on the bioenergetics o HCT116 colon cancer cells; it inhibited oxidative phosphorylation/mitochondrial electron transport (Fig. 14A) , without significantly affecting glycolysis (Fig. 14B ). In addition to HCT116 cells, benserazide also inhibited cell lines proliferation in the colon cancer cell line HT29 (Fig. 15 ); this cell line -similar to HCT116 cells -expresses high levels of CBS [11] . At 100 M (but not at lower concentrations) benserazide also exerted cytotoxic effects in HT29 cells (Fig. 15 ). In contrast, benserazide did not inhibit proliferation in another colon cancer cell line LoVo (Fig. 16) ; this cell line has a lower expression of CBS, and it expresses high levels of CSE, another H 2 S-producing enzyme [11] . Finally, benserazide prevented the growth of HT29 subcutaneous xenografts in tumor-bearing nude mice in vivo (Fig. 17) .",

Based on these data we suggest that benserazide should be further explored with respect to its potential suitability for therapeutic repurposing for cancer. Additional data presented in the current report confirm previous findings [38, 39] demonstrating that copper is a direct inhibitor of CBS activity. Finally, we confirmed that the reference compound AOAA is a CBS inhibitor and antiproliferative agent in colon cancer cells, while the second reference compound NSC67078 was found to potently inhibit not only the CBS-induced AzMC fluorescence response, but also the H 2 S donor GYY4137-induced AzMC fluorescence, suggesting that at least part of the inhibition of the CBS-induced signal is unrelated to direct inhibition of the catalytic activity of CBS. Nevertheless, NSC67078 was found to be a potent inhibitor of HCT116 cell proliferation in vitro.",

Hexachlorophene is also known as a glutaminase inhibitor [44] and as an inhibitor of the beta-catenin pathway [45] . It has not been previously identified as a CBS inhibitor or a H 2 S biosynthesis inhibitor, even though it has already been shown to inhibit tumor cell proliferation in vitro; this effect was attributed to its inhibitory effect on the catenin pathway [46] .

Tannic acid is used in certain food industries, and albumin tannate was used in the 60 s and 70 s as an antidiarrheal agent [47] [48] [49] . Thorson and colleagues have previously identified another polyphenol, rutin, as a CBS inhibitor [26] ; to our knowledge this is the first report to identify tannic acid as a CBS inhibitor. Although the polyphenolic nature of tannic acid suggested non-specific (e.g. potential H 2 S scavenging) properties of various polyphenols, tannic acid did not interfere with the AzMc responses induced by the H 2 S donor compound GYY4137. Interestingly, tannins have been reported to inhibit bacterial H 2 S production [50] , an effect that we hypothesize may be related to its inhibitory effect of bacterial H 2 S-producing enzymes. Tannic acid exerted a concentration-dependent inhibitory effect on HCT116 cell proliferation, with an IC 50 of 20 M. Multiple lines of studies have previously identified the anticancer effects of tannins, although the exact mechanism(s) have not been clearly elucidated; they range from direct cytotoxity to inhibition of various putative target enzymes including proteasomes [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] . Based on the current studies, we hypothesize that inhibition of tumor CBS activity may contribute to the anticancer effects of tannins.",

The stimulation of cell proliferation by aurintricarboxylic acid observed in our experiments -similar to previously observed stimulation of cell proliferation of various cell lines by this compound [64] [65] [66] may be related to the ability of the compound to stimulate var- ious proliferative signaling pathways; we hypothesize that these actions are more predominant in HCT116 cells that any antiproliferative effects that would be expected via CBS inhibition. Although its mode of action and its diverse pharmacological effects suggest lack of specificity (and perhaps lack of in vivo utility) surprisingly, aurintricarboxylic acid is tolerated in experimental animals, and, in fact, has been shown to produce therapeutic benefits in a variety of conditions including encephalitis and sepsis [62, 63] .",

Thorson and colleagues have previously reported [26] the CBS inhibitory effect of benserazide, albeit with a lower potency (125 M). We hypothesize that the difference may be related to the aqueous instability (oxidation-prone nature) of this compound -as demonstrated in our current study as well as reported previously [35, 36] . Benserazide produced the expected features of a CBS inhibitor; similar to AOAA (as shown previously in [11, 67] ), benserazide inhibited colon cancer cell proliferation, and suppressed cancer cell bioenergetic responses. Our computer-based modeling studies have identified a predicted mode of its inhibitory action. It should be noted, nevertheless, that the extent to which benserazide suppresses the proliferation of colon cancer cells depended on the cell type studied. A significant suppression of proliferation (and, at the highest concentrations tested, some degree of cytotoxicity, as evidenced by increased LDH release) was noted in HCT116 cells (Fig. 9 ) and HT-29 cells (Fig. 15 ) that express a relatively high concentration of CBS. By comparison, in LoVo cells, which express a lower level of CBS, neither benserazide-induced antiproliferative effects, nor benserazide-induced increases in LDH release were seen (Fig. 16) . These data support the conclusion that benserazide is targeting CBS. However, we are well aware of the fact that there are many other possibilities that may explain the differential effects, including potential differences in cell uptake, or potential differences in the cellular metabolism of benserazide.",

            "text": "Benserazide is one component of a two-component oral anti-Parkinson therapeutic combination (with the other component being L-DOPA) [68, 69] . The original mode of benserazide's mode of action is to inhibit the peripheral DOPA decarboxylase (which, similar to CBS, is a PLP-dependent enzyme) [68, 69] . A detailed review of the published pharmacological and toxicological literature from the 70 s [70, 71] -mainly generated by pharmacologists at Hoffman LaRoche, the original producer of Madopar \u00ae Roche (1 component benserazide + 4 component L-DOPA) -reveals that benserazide has >35% oral bioavailability in rats and \u223c70% oral bioavailability in humans. At 1-4 h after oral administration of a single dose of 50 mg radiolabeled benserazide, human plasma concentrations were established in the range of 0.5-1 g/ml (i.e. 2-4 M). In rats, a single dose of 10 mg radiolabeled benserazide produced plasma levels of 1-10 g/ml (i.e. 4-40 M) [70, 71] . Similar to many examples in the literature, the plasma concentrations of drugs targeting intracellular enzymes (especially when the mode of action is irreversible binding to the enzyme, as is the case for benserazide, which binds to the PLP prosthetic group of its targets) do not necessarily predict tissue levels or the degree of inhibition of its intracellular target. Importantly, in rat studies [70, 71] , benserazide concentrations in the kidney and the liver were 2-3fold higher than plasma concentrations at 1-12 h after single dose administration. In addition to benserazide itself, our data indicate that its major metabolite 2,3,4-trihydroxybenzylhydrazine (THBH) also acts as a CBS inhibitor and colon cancer cell antiproliferative agent (Fig. 12) . Based on the above pharmacokinetic considerations, we predict that tumor tissue concentrations comparable to the antiproliferative concentrations of benserazide (as well as its metabolite) may be achievable in vivo, which may open the potential for therapeutic repurposing of the compound.",

We found no published studies in the literature on the effect of benserazide on H 2 S production or H 2 S levels. Therefore, we focused on secondary biomarkers. Since liver CBS plays a physiological role in plasma homocysteine metabolism [15] , we predicted that CBS target engagement by benserazide in humans may induce hyperhomocysteinemia. Indeed, a recent study shows that benserazide in Parkinson's patients produces a \u223c15% increase in plasma homocysteine levels [72] , which we interpret as the inactivation of CBS by benserazide, followed by the accumulation of its substrate, homocysteine in the circulation. Further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies are needed to determine the feasibility of benserazide as a potentially repurposable agent for the experimental therapy of cancer.",

Although the potency of copper was found to be remarkable -in fact, copper is technically the most potent CBS inhibitor \"compound\" known to date -free copper ions did not exert antiproliferative effects in HCT116 cells, probably due to limited cell uptake, as well as the high ability of cells to sequester and neutralize any free copper ions [73, 74] . Future work is needed to determine whether the ability of copper to inhibit CBS may be useful in the context of therapeutic CBS inhibition.",
