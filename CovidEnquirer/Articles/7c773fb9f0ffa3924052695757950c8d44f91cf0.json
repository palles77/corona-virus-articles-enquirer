            "text": "The family of viruses most often detected in parasitoids is that of the Polydnaviridae, and it is estimated that tens of thousands of species carry these viruses. This is due to the fact that these viruses have been stably integrated in the genome of ancestral species of whole groups. The other families have been less commonly described, partly because they have not been systematically searched for. They infect very few wasp species. Among those infected by DNA viruses, only one species (Diadromus pulchellus) carried an ascovirus , and one an entomopoxvirus (DlEPV in Diaschimimorpha (\ue035Biosteres) longicaudata) (Bigot et al., 1995; Lawrence, 1988) . The RNA viruses are very rare in parasitoids. Both the Coronaviridae and the Rhabdoviridae have only been identified in one species, Psyttalia (\ue035Opius) concolor (Jacas et al., 1997) and Diachasmimorpha longicaudata (Edson et al., 1982; Lawrence, 1988; Lawrence and Akin, 1990; Lawrence and Matos, 2005) respectively. The Picornaviridae have been detected in four species: Microplitis croceipes (Hamm et al., 1992) , Venturia canescens (Reineke and Asgari, 2005 ) Nasonia vitripennis (Oliveira et al., 2010) , and Pteromalus puparum (Zhu et al., 2008) . The Reoviridae are the RNA viruses most commonly reported in parasitoids although only six species have been shown to carry them: Meteoris leviventris (Edson, 1981) , P. concolor (Jacas et al., 1997) , M. croceipes (Hamm et al., 1994) , H. exiguae (Stoltz and Makkay, 2000) , D. pulchellus (Rabouille et al., 1994; Renault et al., 2003) and Phobocambe tempestiva (Graham et al., 2006) .",

They were purified from the venom apparatus of female parasitoids. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) revealed a virion typical of Coronaviruses, pleomorphic in shape, about 100 nm in diameter, in an envelope with club-shaped projections (15 nm) (Fig. 1A) . However, no molecular analysis has been performed to confirm that this virus contains ssRNA or encodes the characteristic genes of the Coronaviridae. At the cellular level, PcCo-likeV was visible as spherical VLPs in the cytoplasmic vesicles of secretory cells ( Fig. 2A) . However, PcCo-like viruses are always associated with a reovirus, and the VLPs observed could therefore have originated either from the reovirus or the corona-like virus. Unfortunately, nothing is known about the localization of the corona-like virus elsewhere in the parasitoid or in its different tephritid hosts. This makes it impossible to know whether this virus infects the parasitoid or the host, or if it is involved in hostparasitoid interactions. The PcCo-like virus is the only Coronavirus reported in insects and it would be informative to investigate its mechanisms of infection and its evolutionary history.",

This cDNA was expressed differently in the two lines. The analysis of a more complete cDNA has made it possible to identify an open reading frame (ORF) of 515 amino acids displaying homology with the RdRp of other picornaviruses. In N. vitripennis, the ESTs showing no homology to the recently sequenced genome of the wasp (The Nasonia working group, 2010) were analyzed, and two sequences of 2789 bp (NvitV-1) and 1523 bp (Nvitv-2), respectively, were identified. The putative ORFs had the eight characteristic domains of the RdRp, and could be used for phylogenetic analysis. Analysis of VcSRV, NvitV-1 and NvitV-2 RdRp has revealed that they are more closely related to the new Iflaviridae family of Picornavirales superfamily than to the other families (Reineke and Asgari, 2005; Oliveira et al., 2010) .",

Moreover, VcSRV is not detected in newly collected colonies, and NvitV-1 is not transmitted to sibling species (N. giraulti and N. longicornis) that have been reared in close proximity for many years (Oliveira et al., 2010) . The Iflaviridae, which include both VcSRV and NvitV-1, seem to correspond to nonpathogenic Picornavirales; however, this will have to be confirmed if any other Iflaviridae are discovered in parasitoids. The Picornaviridae are probably the easiest RNA viruses to detect as they can be identified in the cDNA library due their polyadenylation. The extension of genome-and EST-sequencing in Hymenoptera will almost certainly lead to the discovery of new Picornaviridae. Virions of the Iflaviridae, VcSRV, are detected in the hemocytes, head and terminal abdominal segments of parasitized host caterpillars, Ephestia kuhnellia (Fig. 2D) . However, it is not known whether the presence of VcSRV promotes the development of the parasitoid larvae in the caterpillar (Reineke and Asgari, 2005) . If so, the relationship must be commensal, as it is not deleterious to the parasitoid or to the host. Nothing is known about the presence of virions in the hosts of M. croceipes and N. vitripennis. As the virus is found in parasitized E. kuehniella, the mode of transmission to infect the host and then parasitoid larvae within the host probably resulted from vertical transmission. The same type of transmission probably occurs in NvitV-1 and NvitV-2.",

The rhabdovirus is particularly abundant in these vesicles (Lawrence, 1988) . During parasitism, DlRhV virions are first observed in the hemolymph 24-36 h post-parasitism (hpp), before the parasitoid eggs hatch, which occurs at about 48 hpp. The DlRhV particles are more abundant in the hemolymph than in the epidermal cells until 48-52 hpp. From 80 hpp, the particles accumulate in the epidermis and appear to replicate (Lawrence and Matos, 2005) .",

Accordingly, DlRhV virions have been detected in the poison apparatus of D. longicaudata females. The particles are located in the middle-third of the accessory glands filaments and in a stroma surrounded by vesicles, similar in morphology to that observed in parasitized A. suspensa (Fig. 2F ) (Lawrence and Akin, 1990) . DlRhV particles are not present in the oviduct of D. longicaudata, or in the previtellogenic and chorionated vitellogenic ova. They have been detected in the subchorionic space of oviposited eggs. It can therefore be hypothesized that DlRhVs are deposited at the periphery of the ooplasm during its passage through the oviduct below the junction with the venom apparatus (Lawrence and Matos, 2005) . The micropyles at the extremity of the chorion could be the entry point for DlRhV. DlRhV particles are also found in midgut lumen of parasitoid first-instar larvae.

McRVLP has been detected essentially in midgut epithelial cells and oenocytes (Fig. 2G ) (Stoltz and Makkay, 2000, Hamm et al., 1994) . HeRIV-2 virion morphogenesis has been observed in all tissues except male testes. Moreover, wasp tissue larvae have less RNA than young or older infected adults, indicating that HeRIV-2 replicates in larvae and adults. The transmission of HeRIV-2 to the parasitized lepidopteran host has been explored in three permissive hosts (which allow the wasp to develop) (Trichoplusia ni, Malacosoma disstria, and Manduca sexta) and in two non-permissive hosts (Orygia leucostigma and Lymantria dispar). Female wasps oviposited on the different hosts, and then the HeRIV-2 RNA genome was looked for. It was found in two permissive hosts and in one non-permissive host, so its replication must depend solely on the host cells, not on the development of parasitoid larvae. No replication was observed in any host when the infection was performed per os in first instar larvae, indicating that the transmission in H. exiguae more likely involve stinging (Stoltz and Makkay, 2000) . HeRIV-2 is probably transmitted to the host during oviposition, and then either HeRIV-2 replicates inside the host and the wasp is infected by feeding on the host tissue, or it directly infects the wasp larvae and then replicates in various different tissues. Transmission in the wasp is probably also vertical and associated with parasitism for McRVLP. A female M. croceipes from a noninfected colony was mated with males carrying McRVLP.

It would be very interesting to explore the exact role of OpbuRV in the parasitic success of P. tempestiva in O. brumata.

            "text": "The last type of possible relationship between reoviruses and wasps is commensal and mutualist, and has only been described for the reovirus DpRIV-1 (Rabouille et al., 1994) . DpRIV-1 is the type species for idnoreoviruses (Mertens et al., 2005b) . This reovirus is present in all the natural French populations of D. pulchellus examined up to 1999. In D. pulchellus, DpRIV-1 is mainly detected in gut epithelial cells, gut lumen, malphigian tubules, and to a lesser extent in the venom glands of the females. The viruses are concentrated in large vesicles present in the epithelial cells, which are released into the gut lumen without cell lysis (Fig. 2G) . DpRIV-1 replicates in D. pulchellus because more viruses are detected in older wasps than in newly emerged insects. In contrast, DpRIV-1 has not been detected in the lepidopteran host, A. assectella, showing that it had not replicated in the lepidopteran host. DpRIV-1 resembles a commensal virus of D. pulchellus, as it has no impact on the fitness of the wasp (Rabouille et al., 1994) . However, it seems to play a more subtle role in the host/parasitoid relationship because, even if it does not replicate in the host, it does regulate the replication of the associated ascovirus Dp-AV4 (Bigot et al., 1997) . Ascovirus DpAV-4 is indispensable for successful parasitism by down-regulating host immunity at the level of melanization (Bigot et al., 1997 , Renault et al., 2002 . However, when DpAv-4 was injected alone into the lepidopteran host, infection occurred very rapidly and the host died within 72 h (Bigot et al., 1995) . In contrast, when coinjected with DpRIV-1 during ovipositing, the replication of DpAV-4 was slower, and allowed D. pulchellus larvae to develop (Bigot et al., 1997) . In conclusion, DpRIV-1 is commensal but also indispensable for parasitic success, and can therefore be considered as being indirectly mutualist.",

Most cypoviruses have been detected in Lepidoptera (Mertens et al., 2005a) .

In DpRIV-1, sequencing of the supplemental fragment has revealed that it is composed of a duplication of part of the longest fragment of DpRIV-1 (Bigot et al., 1995) . As diploid individuals are most probably mostly females in wild populations, it might play a role in regulating the replication of DpAV-4 (Renault et al., 2005) .

This could suggest that the presence of polydnaviruses or VLPs may block infections with other viruses. However, some cases of coinfection and coreplication of RNA viruses and polydnaviruses have been described in H. exiguae, M. croceipes, and M. leviventris. The absence of detection of coinfection with polydnaviruses in most cases is perhaps simply due to the fact that the polydnavirus is present in large quantities in parasitoids, and so masks the presence of the other viruses, as in H. exiguae (Stoltz and Makkay, 2000) .",

We could suggest that the RNA viruses are opportunistic viruses, which require preliminary infection with other viruses in order to infect the host. This hypothesis is reinforced by the fact that the association with parasitoids is sporadic. Indeed, most of them are detected in some strains but not in others, for example HeRIV-2 or VcRSV. They resemble conventional viruses, where populations or individuals can be either infected or not infected. With the exception of the reovirus DpRV-2, none is directly implicated in regulating host immunity, or promoting successful parasitism.",

More data on their genome composition would allow the determination of their phylogeny and facilitate the study of their life-cycle. We hope that this part of our work will expand in the coming years as genome sequencing of parasitoids advances, as exemplified by the recent discovery of the sequences of picorna-like viruses in the EST library of N. vitripennis (Oliveira et al., 2010) . The limitation in the number of studies of the RNA viruses in parasitoids is probably also due to the fact that infections with these viruses have little impact on the viability of economically important parasitoids used in pest control.",
