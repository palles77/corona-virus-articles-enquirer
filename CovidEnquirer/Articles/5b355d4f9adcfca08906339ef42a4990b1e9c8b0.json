We have examined the effects of brefeldin A (BFA) on the Golgi-localized synthesis and addition of chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan carbohydrate side chains . BFA caused a dose-dependent inhibition of chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan elongation and sulfation onto the core proteins of the melanoma-associated proteoglycan and the major histocompatibility complex class II-associated invariant chain . In the presence of BFA, the melanoma proteoglycan core protein was retained in the ER but still acquired complex, sialylated, N-linked oligosaccharides, as measured by digestion with endoglycosidase H and neuraminidase. The initiation of glycosaminoglycan syn-xE biosynthesis of glycosaminoglycan (GAG)' carbohydrate side chains involves an extensive series of posttranslational enzymatic reactions that occur dur ing the intracellular transport of core proteins from the ER through the Golgi complex . These reactions use specific initiation, elongation, and sulfation enzymes to modify appropriate core proteins and assemble them into mature proteoglycan molecules . For chondroitin sulfate (CS) GAGS, the carbohydrate-protein linkage region is initiated by a xylosyltransferase that transfers xylose from UDP-xylose to the hydroxyl groups of specific serine residues within a core protein. Initiation is completed by the addition oftwo galactosyl and one glucuronosyl residue through the action of galactosyltransferase I, II, and glucuronosyltransferase I, respectively. Once initiated, the repeating disaccharide backbone ofglucuronosyl and N-acetylgalactosaminyl residues is elongated by specific glucuronosyland N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases . Sulfation of the repeating disaccharides by the 4-and/or 6-sulfotransferases completes the synthesis of mono-or disulfated CS (27) (see Fig . 11 for summary) .",

The ability of cells to use an exogenous acceptor, p-nitro phenyl-\u00df-D-xyloside, to elongate and sulfate core protein-free glycosaminoglycans, was completely inhibited by BFA . The effects of BFA were completely reversible in the absence of new protein synthesis. These experiments indicate that BFA effectively uncouples chondroitin sulfate glycosaminoglycan synthesis by segregating initiation reactions from elongation and sulfation events . Our findings support the proposal that glycosaminoglycan elongation and sulfation reactions are associated with the trans-Golgi network, a BFA-resistant, Golgi subcompartment .",

Early studies using electron microscopy and radioautography showed that the Golgi complex is the major site of GAG chain synthesis (21, 24, 25) . Golgi-enriched preparations isolated from some cell types have also been shown to contain GAG synthesizing activity (32) . More recent studies examining the kinetics of entry ofradiolabeled sugars into GAG chains, as well as the localization of GAG sugar nucleotide and sulfate donor transport systems, have clearly localized GAG synthesis to the Golgi complex (14, 18, 23) . The exact spatial organization of the cascade of enzymatic reactions involved in GAG synthesis is not known, due, in part, to the lack of understanding of the dynamics and spatial differentiation of the Golgi complex .",

BEN dramatically, yet reversibly, alters Golgi morphology and function by disrupting the budding ofnonclathrin-coated transport vesicles responsible for anterograde movement (3, 22) . The result is a block in anterograde protein transport out of the ER (20) and a redistribution ofcis-, medial, and trams-Golgi-resident enzymes back to the ER through a retrograde, microtubuledependent pathway (16, 17) . In contrast, the compartmen-talization processes involved in the formation of the TGN, lysosomes, and endocytic vesicles are resistant to the redistribution induced by BFA (2, 20) .",

In addition, BFA-treated cells fail to elongate and sulfate GAG chains onto the exogenous, artificial GAG acceptor, p-nitrophenyl-\u00df-D-xyloside (ODX) . Initiation of GAG synthesis in the presence of BFA proceeds through to the addition of the xylosyl residue and the galactosyl residues of the carbohydrate-protein linkage region .

To examine if Golgi enzymes are redistributed in BFAtreated melanoma cells, the processing of the MPG core protein N-linked oligosaccharides was monitored by endo H digestion of MPG immunoprecipitates isolated from M21 cells pretreated, pulse labeled, and chased in the presence of BFA . Immediately after the pulse label, the 240-kD form of the MPG is susceptible to endo H digestion in both control and BFA-treated cells. After 15-30 min, and throughout the remainder of the chase period in control cells, the 240-kD precursor is converted to the 250-kD, endo H-resistant form and the high molecular mass CS proteoglycan (Fig . 4 A) (33, 34) . In BFA-treated cells, the 240-kD form gradually acquires endo H resistance during the chase period and be-The Joumal of Cell Biology, Volume 115, 1991 comes completely resistant by 9 h. This acquisition of endo H resistance is accompanied by a slight increase in molecular mass, but complete conversion to the 250-kD or the proteoglycan form is inhibited by BFA (Fig. 4 a) . Neuraminidase digestion of the MPG isolated from cells labeled with [e 5 S]methionine for 1 h and chased for 3 h in the presence of BFA results in a shift in mobility of the core protein, indicating the acquisition of sialic acid residues (Fig . 4 b) . These results are consistent with the recycling, back to the ER, of the Golgi resident enzymes that trim and terminally process the N-linked oligosaccharides of the ERretained MPG core protein . The absence of the proteoglycan form of the MPG suggests that the redistribution of CS GAG enzymes to the ER does not occur or that their redistribution results in a loss of functional activity.",

About 56 % of the released chains are neutral, and two peaks are seen in HPLC analysis (Fig. 6 ) . Spiro \u00df-galactosidase digestion eliminates both peaks and generates a monosaccharide peak, presumably free [3H]galactose, which elutes slightly later than the '\u00b0C-fUcitol standard, as expected (7) . The major peak is probably the linkage region, Xy1H 01-4-Gal 01-3-Gal, and the minor peak is probably Xy1H \u00dfl-4-Gal. Chromatography on QAE-Sephadex showed that 43% of the labeled material carries one to three negative charges, based on comparison with appropriate standards (data not shown) .

In contrast, pretreatment of the cells with BFA results in a dose-dependent inhibition of incorporation of sulfate into \u00dfDX-initiated macromolecules . The observed inhibition is not due to a block in the uptake of \u00dfDX since identical results are obtained in cells that are preloaded before BFA treatment (data not shown) . At 20 ng/nll of BFA, incorporation of [ 3 IS]sulfate is only 59% of control cells, and at higher concentrations (0.2 and 2 pg/ml) the inhibition is virtually complete with incorporation diminishing to 1% of control cells (Fig . 7) . Similar experiments performed with [6-3H] galactose demonstrated the accumulation of [3 H]galactose intermediates linked to \u00dfDX (data not shown) . The dose response range demonstrated here correlates well with that observed in Fig . 1 for inhibition of conversion of the MPG core protein to the proteoglycan form. These results indicate that BFA completely disrupts the ability of cells to use an exogenous, artificial acceptor for the elongation and sulfation of GAG chains .

In M21 cells pretreated with BFA for 30 min, pulse-labeled for 10 min, and then washed and chased in the absence of BFA, conversion of the MPG core protein to the proteoglycan form begins between 1 and 2 h of release from BFA (Fig. 8) . After an overnight release, both the 250-kD and CS proteoglycan forms can be isolated from the BFA-treated cells, as demonstrated by chondroitinase ABC digestion of the immunoprecipitates before SDS-PAGE analysis (in Fig . 8, 24 hour time point) . Interestingly, after recovery from BFA treatment, a higher proportion of the MPG is expressed as the 250-kD rather than the proteoglycan form . This indicates that not all of the core protein that accumulates in the presence of BFA can serve as substrate for chondroitin sulfate synthesis after removal of the drug .

This assembly process requires the precise coordination of temporal and spatial parameters that can influence core protein access to initiation, elongation, and sulfation enzymes . Previous studies have shown that agents which disrupt vesicular transport, or inhibit core protein release from the ER, also inhibit GAG chain addition to the MPG core protein with little or no effect on ODX-dependent GAG synthesis (33, 34) . However, the interpretation of these previous results is restricted by the limited data on the effects of these agents on the structural and functional integrity of the vesicular pathway and associated organelles . The well-defined effects of BFA now make it possible to further delineate the topology of the CS GAG enzymatic machinery. Figure 9 The effects of BFA on ODXinitiated GAG synthesis are reversible . M21 cells were pretreated for 0.5 h with or without BFA (1 Wg/ml) and /3DX (1 rnM) before a 1-h label with [35 S] sulfate . One aliquot of cells (1 .5 h treatment) was then harvested and cell-associated (hatched region) or exocytosed (nonhatched region) 35S-macromolecules were quantitated as described in Figure 6 . A second aliquot ofcells ( The results presented in this study demonstrate that the Golgi-specific changes induced by BFA have a profound effect on CS GAG synthesis . BFA caused a dose-dependent, yet completely reversible inhibition of CS GAG elongation and sulfation onto the MPG and invariant chain core proteins, as well as onto the exogenous, artificial GAG acceptor, ODX . BFA did not affect the initiation of CS GAG synthesis, including addition of the xylosyl residue and the galactosyl residues of the initiation linkage region . The simplest explanation for these findings is that CS GAG chain elongation and sulfation enzymes are resistant or insensitive to the redistribution induced by BFA, while the initiation enzymes are not (Fig. 11 ) . This results in the complete uncoupling of CS GAG chain initiation from the elongation and sulfation events in a manner completely analagous to the BFAinduced uncoupling of glycosphingolipid synthesis (39, 40) .",

Either mechanism would result in the observed inhibition of CS GAG synthesis, regardless of the location of the elongation and sulfation enzymes after the BFA-induced redistribution . However, results from previous studies argue against these possibilities . BFA does not inhibit the in vitro activity of several glycosyltransferases and does not affect the uptake of UDP-sugars (20, 36) . In addition, the sialylation of the MPG core protein in the presence of BFA demonstrates that the Golgi-resident CMP-sialic acid transport system (14, 23) and some sialytransferase can be redistributed to the ER . The recent data demonstrating that BFA causes the disruption of a Golgi-specific structural protein suggests that its mode of action is directed towards the structural integrity of the Golgi rather than the resident enzymes (3, 22) . For these reasons it is more likely that the BFA-induced inhibition of CS GAG synthesis is due to the segregation of initiation and elongation-sulfation enzymes into BFA sensitive and -resistant compartments, respectively (Fig. 11) .",

The localization of CS elongation and sulfation events to the TGN extends the list of TGN-resident enzymes to include the specific glycosyland sulfotransferases involved in these reactions. It has been previously shown that some classes of sialyltransferases and the GA2/GM2/GD2 synthase are localized in a BFA-resistant compartment (2, 31, (38) (39) (40) . Further structural studies on the specific enzymes involved in these reactions will help to determine the mechanism responsible for their specific targeting to the TGN .",

Conversion of the MPG core protein to the proteoglycan form (PG) begins to appear after 1-2 h of release from BFA treatment. Molecular mass standards are in kilodaltons . complex class R-associated invariant chain were examined in the Raji B-lymphoblastoid cell line. The invariant chain consists of a family of 31-41-kD glycoproteins that are associated with the class II \u00ab and (3 subunits . The invariant chain is also converted to a CS proteoglycan form that can only be identified in [\"S]sulfate-labeled cells(10,29) . Treatment of Raji cells with BFA completely blocks the conversion of the invariant chain to a proteoglycan, as judged by the inhibition of [35 S]sulfate incorporation into this form(Fig . 10, right panel). The increase in resistance to endo H digestion of the [35S]methionine-labeled invariant chain forms demonstrates the acquisition of complex N-linked oligosaccharides in the presence of BFA(Fig . 10,left panel) . Therefore, the effects of BFA on GAG chain synthesis are not restricted to melanoma cells and are not a peculiarity of the MPG system .",
