Objectives: The purpose of this study was to identify potential ligands and develop a novel diagnostic test to SARS-CoV using phage display technology. Study design: The SARS-CoV spike 1 (S1) protein containing the receptor binding region (RBD) was used as an immobilized target followed by incubation with a 12-mer phage display random peptide library. After four rounds of biopanning, 10 monoclonal phages with specific binding activity to the S1-RBD protein were obtained and subjected to binding and diagnostic assays. Results: DNA sequencing showed that two phage displayed peptides HHKTWHPPVMHL (phage-H) and SQWHPRSASYPM (phage-S) that were specific ligands to the S1 protein. Moreover, the selected phage-H and phage-S were capable of differentiating SARS-CoV from other coronaviruses in indirect enzymelinked immunosorbent assays. Conclusion: The peptides identified in this study are useful reagents for detection of SARS-CoV.",

[3] [4] [5] The hACE2 protein was identified as a functional receptor for the SARS-CoV and its binding site on the S protein was localized between amino acids 318 and 510. [3] [4] [5] In a phage display peptide library, random peptides are expressed on the surface of a filamentous bacteriophage. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Phage library is a powerful molecular tool, allowing specific screening of optimal ligands of given targets based on an in vitro panning process.

To confirm the specific recognition of the phage-displayed peptides to the S1 protein, we analyzed their interaction with the S1 proteins from several coronaviruses. The data showed that these identified phages recognized SARS-CoV S1 protein exclusively. They did not react with other S1 proteins indicating that the reaction is specific. At the same time, when we used the same phage bearing an unrelated peptide, no positive result was observed, implying that the reaction was mediated by the S1 protein specific peptides. It has been reported that little evolution has been occurring within SARS-CoV S proteins 30 ; however, more SARS-CoV isolates should be analyzed in the future to confirm the specificity of the phage-based ELISA. Interestingly, when we used the SARS-CoV S1 protein as sample in a Western blot, the phage displayed peptides did not recognize this protein, and this result was consistent with that of our ELISA with the use of denaturated SARS-CoV S1 protein (data not shown). These pieces of evidence indicate that denaturation of the target protein may affect the interaction with their ligand peptides. Mutation of these identified peptide sequences will be done to clarify their function in our further study. In this study, we wanted to use the S1-binding peptides to establish an indirect ELISA to detect SARS-CoV. To analyze the specificity of such an ELISA, several viruses including MHV, a virus that is genetically more closely related to SARS-CoV, human coronavirus 229E, porcine coronaviruses TGEV and PEDV, the avian coronavirus IBV Fig. 2 . Binding specificity of phage displayed peptides to SARS-CoV S1 protein. BHK 21 cells were tranfected with pVAX-N1 vector, pVAX-SARS-S1, pVAX-TGEV-S1 and pVAX-PEDV-S1, respectively. At 24 h post-transfection, the fixed cells were incubated with the identified phages and an unrelated phage bearing a control peptide (phage-control) at a titer of 1.5 \u00d7 10 11 pfu followed by incubation with rabbit anti-M13 polyclonal antibody and FITC-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG, respectively. A representative comparison is provided. (For interpretation of the references to color in text, the reader is referred to the web version of the article.) Fig. 3 . Phage-based ELISA differentiating inactivated SARS-CoV from other viruses. Two phages harboring specific peptides recognizing inactivated SARS-CoV were identified from the 10 selected phages. Two identified peptides were sequencing and designed as phage-H and phage-S, which were incubated with various kinds of virus in ELISA plates. *p < 0.01 (highly significant) compared with HCoV 229E, MHV-A549, TGEV, PEDV, IBV and Coating buffer (NaHCO3). and the porcine arterivirus PRRSV, were selected as controls in this study. The specific peptide-bearing phages could be used as diagnostic reagents in indirect ELISA to differentiate the inactivated SARS-CoV specifically from above-mentioned viruses. As the control phage bearing phage complex from the phage library only had a negligible effect, the current result indicated that the phage-based ELISA was mainly mediated by the foreign peptides displayed on the surface of these phages.
