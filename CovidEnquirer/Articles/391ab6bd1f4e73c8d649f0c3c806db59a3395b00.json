            "text": "Urbanization is intensifying worldwide, and affects the epidemiology of infectious diseases. However, the effect of urbanization on natural host-pathogen systems remains poorly understood. Urban ducks occupy an interesting niche in that they directly interact with both humans and wild migratory birds, and either directly or indirectly with food production birds. Here we have collected samples from Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) residing in a pond in central Uppsala, Sweden, from January 2013 to January 2014. This artificial pond is kept ice-free during the winter months, and is a popular location where the ducks are fed, resulting in a resident population of ducks year-round. Nine hundred and seventy seven (977) fecal samples were screened for RNA viruses including: influenza A virus (IAV), avian paramyxovirus 1, avian coronavirus (CoV), and avian astrovirus (AstroV). This intra-annual dataset illustrates that these RNA viruses exhibit similar annual patterns to IAV, suggesting similar ecological factors are at play. Furthermore, in comparison to wild ducks, autumnal prevalence of IAV and CoV are lower in this urban population. We also demonstrate that AstroV might be a larger burden to urban ducks than IAV, and should be better assessed to demonstrate the degree to which wild birds contribute to the epidemiology of these viruses. The presence of economically relevant viruses in urban Mallards highlights the importance of elucidating the ecology of wildlife pathogens in urban environments, which will become increasingly important for managing disease risks to wildlife, food production animals, and humans.",

Within the global growth of cities, urbanization increasingly shapes the emergence and trajectory of infectious disease, both human disease and disease and parasitism in wild animals (Alirol et al., 2011; Neiderud, 2015) . In association with urbanization, factors affecting pathogen (and parasite) transmission in wild animals include an increase in aggregation and resource availability resulting in increased contact rates, decrease in biodiversity, modulation in host immunity and stress levels (Becker and Hall, 2014; Becker et al., 2015; Bradley and Altizer, 2006; Delgado and French, 2012; Patz et al., 2004; Penczykowski et al., 2014) . Furthermore, in cities, increased contact among humans, domestic animals and wild animals may facilitate cross species spillover of (vertebrate) pathogens, with consequences for wildlife conservation, agriculture, and human health (Becker et al., 2015; Bradley and Altizer, 2006; Delgado and French, 2012; Patz et al., 2004) .",

            "text": "Influenza A virus (IAV) is a multi-host virus, wherein spillover between birds, humans and agricultural animals does occur, and dabbling ducks, such as those found in city parks, constitute the main reservoir host for these viruses (Olsen et al., 2006; Webster et al., 1992) . Indeed, highly urbanized areas may contain canals and large city parks with ponds housing a wide variety of wild and semi-domestic birds. RNA viruses such as IAV have a low pathogenicity phenotype in their natural hosts (Olsen et al., 2006) , but have large negative socioeconomic consequences when they spillover into food production animals and humans (Alexander and Brown, 2009; FAO, 2005 FAO, , 2012 . For example, the most recent remerging highly pathogenic IAV H5N8, which was transported globally by waterfowl, resulted in the culling of hundreds of thousands of chickens and turkeys, and is a risk to human health given the reassortment potential (European Food Safety Authority, 2014; Lee et al., 2014; Pasick et al., 2015; Verhagen et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2014) . Dabbling ducks are a host for a number of RNA viruses, including avian coronavirus [CoV] , avian paramyxovirus type 1 [APMV-1], and emerging evidence suggests they may also be hosts for an array of avian astroviruses [AstroV] (e.g. Chu et al., 2012; Ramey et al., 2013; Tolf et al., 2013b; Wille et al., 2015; Wille et al., 2016b) . These viruses do not cause signs of disease in their wildlife hosts, but have closely related forms causing morbidity and mortality in poultry, such as infectious bronchitis (CoV) (e.g. Domanska-Blicharz et al., 2014; Jackwood et al., 2012; Zhuang et al., 2015) , Newcastle disease (APMV-1) (e.g. Alexander, 2011; Jindal et al., 2009; Ramey et al., 2013; Snoeck et al., 2013; Tolf et al., 2013b) , duck hepatitis (AstroV) or avian nephritis (AstroV) (e.g. Chu et al., 2012; Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2011) . These viruses have been assessed, to various degrees, in wild migrating waterfowl. In Sweden, and globally, the ecology of IAV is well described in wild waterfowl, where up to 30% of Mallards (Anas platyrhynchos) are infected during the autumn migration (Latorre-Margalef et al., 2014; Olsen et al., 2006) . Recent studies have been instrumental in starting to describe dynamics and ecology of AMPV-1 and CoV in wild birds; 9-12% of migrating Mallards have CoV infections, compared to a lower prevalence (2%) of AMPV-1 towards the end of the migratory season in Sweden (Tolf et al., 2013b; Wille et al., 2015) . Most APMV-1 is detected during IAV studies where agglutinating agents are detected after culture that are not IAV (e.g. Jindal et al., 2009; Ramey et al., 2013) , so few true prevalence estimates exist. Beyond these viruses, we have a limited understanding of the virodiversity in waterfowl; astroviruses for example have only recently been assessed in wild birds, and the results of a single study suggest that waterfowl may be important in the epidemiology of these viruses (Chu et al., 2012) . Given that waterfowl are hosts for both multi-host viruses and viruses that cause morbidity and mortality in food production birds, combined with the increased contact between waterfowl and humans in urban areas, dynamics of these viruses in urban bird populations should be explored.",

Thus, this intra-annual dataset allows us to add to the natural history of IAV, CoV, AMPV-1, and the rarely assessed AstroV. Furthermore, we aim to elucidate if less frequently studied RNA viruses follow intra-annual cycles similar to that of the intensively studied IAV. In context of IAV, and to a lesser degree CoV and APMV-1, an assessment of virus prevalence and diversity in an urban population will further allow us to assess if dynamics in wild birds are reflected in an urban setting.",

The pond is kept ice-free during the winter months, and is a popular location where the ducks are fed, resulting in a resident population of ducks year-round. This pond has a largely constant population size between 300 and 600 individuals through the autumn and winter, with fewer birds occupying the pond during breeding in the summer months ( Fig. A.1) . The low population count in May is likely the result of unfavorable conditions on the day of the count and sampling. Slightly higher population counts in the winter, when most of the city ponds are frozen, likely represent the congregation of birds from ponds across Uppsala to utilize this ice-free habitat ( Fig. A.1) .",

Positive pools were re-extractioned individually using the Maxwell 16 Instrument and Viral Total Nucleic Acid Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, USA). Following extraction, samples were assayed by real time reverse transcriptase PCR (rRT-PCR) for IAV, CoV, and AMPV-1 using previously published methods. Briefly, IAV was screened using a rRT-PCR assay targeting a short region of the matrix gene (Spackman et al., 2002) and a pan-coronavirus rRT-PCR assay targeting the RNA-dependant RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene (Muradrasoli et al., 2009 ) using the iScript One Step RT-PCR Kit (BioRad, Hercules, USA). A rRT-PCR targeting the matrix (M) gene (Tolf et al., 2013b; Wise et al., 2004) with the One Step RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) was employed to screen for APMV-1. A cycle threshold (Ct) cutoff of 40 was used for all screens. To screen for AstroV, cDNA was synthesized using Superscript III (Invitrogen) and random hexamers (Invitrogen) followed by a nested PCR targeting the RdRp (Chu et al., 2012; Chu et al., 2008) using Taq polymerase (Qiagen).",

However, the difference in prevalence between urban and wild ducks does not appear to be driven by a temporal mismatch in prevalence peaks.

            "text": "Urbanization is intensifying world-wide, directly affecting interactions between humans and wild animals, in particular wild animals utilizing urban environments. In this study we aimed to characterize the dynamics of four avian RNA viruses in wild birds utilizing an urban environment. These viruses, while causing no apparent clinical signs in wild waterfowl, are closely related to or have pathogenic variants, which may cause significant morbidity and mortality in poultry. In wild birds, especially waterfowl, IAV has been intensively assessed, and we found that in an urban environment, annual dynamics of IAV was similar to the global consensus. That is, very low prevalence in the spring and summer, with a higher prevalence in autumn and early winter when birds are migrating (Olsen et al., 2006) . In this study prevalence is lower in urban ducks than wild migrating ducks, here significantly lower than wild ducks utilizing a stop-over site in southern Sweden (Latorre-Margalef et al., 2014; Wille et al., 2015) . There is some evidence that prevalence of IAV might be lower in urban and sentinel populations, but this still needs more expansive assessment. Verhagen et al. (2012) demonstrated that IAV prevalence is inversely correlated with urbanization, and urban Mallard prevalence is only 1.9%, which corroborates our findings. However, the bird species composition and temporal sampling between urban and rural areas were mismatched (Verhagen et al., 2012) . In another study, in eastern Canada, prevalence of largely non-migratory urban ducks in the city of St. John's, Newfoundland, was 7.2%, with higher prevalence only reported when samples sizes were small (Huang et al., 2013a) . One hypothesis for low viral prevalence in urban areas is host population structure and migratory propensity. Concentrated resources presented in urban environments influence host migration and among/between species contact rates (Altizer et al., 2011; Bradley and Altizer, 2006) . Specifically, a larger proportion of urban ducks are non-migratory, although local movements do occur, particularly during breeding. Due to a more sedentary lifestyle, following the initial input of susceptible ducklings after breeding, there is limited immigration, representing input of susceptible individuals across the autumn. In contrast, at a migratory stopover location such as Ottenby, there is continual input of new individuals across the season representing both susceptible and infected birds (Latorre-Margalef et al., 2014) . The continual immigration creates a constant pool of susceptible birds and input of diverse HA subtypes. Emigration allows for the removal of recovered birds from the system, allowing for higher viral prevalence across the autumn migration (Altizer et al., 2011; Avril et al., 2016) . Lack of migration is also a feature of sentinel ducks, and prevalence and viral diversity was low in sentinel ducks being assessed on Lake Constance (Globig et al., 2009; Globig et al., 2012) and adult sentinel ducks in Sweden (Tolf et al., 2013a ). An interesting parallel is IAV dynamics in Africa where IAV seasonality in Fig. 2 . Comparisons of autumnal prevalence for (a) IAV, (b) CoV and (c) APMV-1 between urban ducks (this study) and wild migratory ducks (Wille et al., 2015) . Mean and 95% confidence intervals shown for prevalence, and asterisks indicate a significant difference. \"Total\" here is the combined number of viruses detected/total samples screened for the months of September, October, November and December. muted, and prevalence is very low. The putative driver is different life history strategies of waterfowl, wherein the classical patterns of waterfowl aggregation and migration in temperate regions are less pronounced, with only the subset of Palearctic breeding waterfowl exhibiting long distance migration; Afro-tropical waterfowl are resident or partial migrants likely due to more abundant resources. Furthermore, an increase in IAV prevalence was correlated to the influx of Palearctic migrants (Gaidet et al., 2012; Gaidet et al., 2007) . In terms of population structure, urban ponds in Uppsala are utilized by a single dabbling duck species -Mallards; other dabbling duck and waterfowl species are absent limiting the breadth and size of the host reservoir. Finally, urban Mallards have access to more resources than their wild conspecifics due to supplemental feeding, which in turn may allow these individuals to mount a more efficient antiviral response (Chandra, 1999; Hall et al., 2009) , at both the innate (antiviral genes more highly unregulated) (Barber et al., 2008; Vanderven et al., 2012) and acquired level (length of antibody life) (Magor, 2011) . Unfortunately, there are few studies assessing the antiviral response to IAV, and those that do exist are largely focussed on the response to highly pathogenic IAV (Barber et al., 2008; Huang et al., 2013b; Vanderven et al., 2012) . Interestingly, despite the potential for an improved immune response, some studies suggest that an increase of resource may increase transmission potential and pathogen transmission (Becker and Hall, 2014; Penczykowski et al., 2014) . Despite empirical studies suggesting lower prevalence of IAV in urban systems, however limited, theoretical studies imply that pathogen prevalence should be higher in these conditions (e.g. Hall et al., 2014) . These theoretical studies have been verified by empirical work. For example, in Monarch butterflies (Danaus plexippus) that have lost migratory behaviour there is an increase in infection risk of a protozoan parasite (Satterfield et al., 2015) . The reason for this conflict is unknown, however, one hypothesis is that these studies utilize a chronic disease model, whereas influenza is an acute infectious disease, and dynamics are driven largely by the herd immunity of the population (Latorre-Margalef et al., 2014; van Dijk et al., 2014; Wille et al., 2016a) . There are a number of factors which may be important drivers in dynamics of diseases in urban environments, including the relationship between provisioning, stress, pollution and immune response which affect susceptibility and ability to fight infection, however these are challenging to disentangle (Becker et al., 2015; Bradley and Altizer, 2006; Delgado and French, 2012; Patz et al., 2004) , and these factors in relation to RNA virus dynamics need to be assessed.

            "text": "While IAV has been intensively assessed, we are only starting to explore dynamics of other avian RNA viruses. Indeed, this is the first intraannual dataset exploring dynamics of CoV, APMV-1 and AstroV and, furthermore, the first comparison between wild and urban settings for CoV and APMV-1. It is also the second study assessing AstroV in wild birds (Chu et al., 2012) . Given the economic implications of these viruses, our limited understanding of the dynamics and ecology of these viruses in wild birds is disquieting. Perhaps unsurprising, overall annual trends in prevalence were similar for all viruses, and shared ecological drivers, such as those identified for IAV (van Dijk et al., 2014) , are the most parsimonious explanation for the shared patterns in long term dynamics of these viruses. That is, increased prevalence due to input of immunologically na\u00efve birds into the system after breeding and aggregating of birds for autumn migration, and decreased prevalence in the winter following an increase in herd immunity (Latorre-Margalef et al., 2014; Olsen et al., 2006; van Dijk et al., 2014) . This dataset provides further evidence of the importance of waterfowl, urban or wild, in the epidemiology of CoV and APMV-1. It is only within the last 10 years that CoV have been assessed in wild birds and these viruses have largely been assessed using single time point studies, across a range of species, and using an array of different screening methods (e.g. Chu et al., 2011; Muradrasoli et al., 2010; Wille et al., 2016b) . Given the long history of APMV-1 research (Alexander et al., 2012) , and \"accidental\" isolation of this virus in IAV studies (e.g. Jindal et al., 2009; Ramey et al., 2013) , it is known that these viruses are present in waterfowl, however accurate prevalence estimates are still rare (Tolf et al., 2013b; Wille et al., 2015) . Not all economically relevant avian RNA viruses have been assessed in wild birds, and astroviruses are such an example. Most strikingly, in this population, AstroV might be more pervasive than IAV, which has long been thought to be one of the most important RNA viruses in wild waterfowl. Not only was prevalence of AstroV higher than IAV, viruses were detected over a longer temporal interval. These viruses are particularly interesting due to the importance in poultry including chickens, turkeys and ducks, but the overall lack of assessment in wild birds leads to limited understanding of the epidemiology and ecology beyond food production birds. Furthermore, this study corroborates Chu et al. (2012) in that wild birds appear to contribute to the epidemiology of chicken or turkey \"adapted\" astrovirus strains.",

This relationship between CoV and IAV, illustrated here by similar trends in urbanization could be due to a mutualistic relationship, that is prevalence of CoV in waterfowl has been shown to be higher given infection with IAV in wild migrating Mallards (Wille et al., 2015) . Prevalence for APMV-1 was not significantly different between this urban population and a wild migratory population, however this could be driven by sample size constraintsthat is for a disease with a prevalence of b2% a much larger sample size is required to adequately assess prevalence with confidence (Hoye et al., 2010) . Furthermore, given the scarcity of prevalence studies in wild birds and diversity of methods used, it is not certain if this trend in APMV-1 is due to methodological constraints or whether there are different drivers of APMV-1 ecology. Indeed, there might be an inverse relationship between APMV-1 and IAV prevalence, where APMV-1 prevalence increases when IAV prevalence decreases in wild Mallards (Tolf et al., 2013b; Wille et al., 2015) . Despite the factors associated with urbanization, this overall seasonal trend for these viruses, likely driven by shared ecological factors, remains clear.",

            "text": "This study highlights our limited understanding of RNA virus dynamics in birds in general, and more specifically, viruses in Mallards. Mallards are one of the most common avian species on the planet, which is owed to the fact that they are able to adapt to environments disturbed by human activities, and are a common sight in many cities (Cramp and Simmons, 1977; Drilling et al., 2002) . Mallards and other dabbling ducks are the natural reservoir for IAV, are known to harbour high prevalence of IAV in the wild, and may be implicated in the spread of highly pathogenic IAV (Latorre-Margalef et al., 2014; van Dijk et al., 2015; Verhagen et al., 2015) . Indeed, the H1N1 IAV isolated in this study was more similar to viruses isolated in Asia than Europe suggesting long distance dispersal prior to circulation in this urban duck pond. This study was undertaken in 2014, prior to the influx of highly pathogenic H5N8 which were carried by apparently healthy birds (Verhagen et al., 2015) . Given these urban Mallards harbour \"Asian\" IAV there is certainly concern for zoonotic spillover. Furthermore, it is not a stretch to imagine that Mallards may also be reservoirs and important in the spread and dynamics of other economically relevant RNA viruses such as CoV, APMV-1, and AstroV. Of all pathogens, RNA viruses are the most likely to be zoonotic (Woolhouse and Gowtage-Sequeria, 2005) , and it is in environments where humans are in close proximity to a high density of birds that zoonotic spillover is most likely to occur. For example, live-bird markets are central in the transmission of avian influenza viruses from birds to humans (Wan et al., 2011) . The role of urban ducks, given low virus prevalence, is uncertain, however, to better understand the zoonotic risk a better understanding of the RNA virus diversity and wildlife-pathogen dynamics in urban landscapes is crucial.",
