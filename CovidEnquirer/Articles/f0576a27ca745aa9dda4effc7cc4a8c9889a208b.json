Its origin can be found in the early 20th century when it was introduced to study tissue growth and maturation, virus biology and vaccine development, the role of genes in disease and health, and the use of large-scale hybrid cell lines to generate biopharmaceuticals. The experimental applications of cultured cells are as diverse as the cell types that can be grown in vitro. In a clinical context, however, cell culture is most commonly linked to creating model systems that study basic cell biology, replicate disease mechanisms, or investigate the toxicity of novel drug compounds. One of the advantages of using cell culture for these applications is the feasibility to manipulate genes and molecular pathways. Furthermore, the homogeneity of clonal cell populations or specific cell types and well-defined culture systems removes interfering genetic or environmental variables, and therefore allows for data generation of high reproducibility and consistency that cannot be warranted when studying whole organ systems.",

These potential hazards can endanger the health of laboratory workers when introduced into the body (e.g., via contact of skin and mucous membranes with solids, liquids, or aerosols) and threaten the environment when handled improperly ( Fig. 9.1 ). Before commencing any cell culture work, the reduced or eliminated exposure to potentially hazardous agents therefore needs to be ensured to minimize infection, pathogenicity, allergic reactions, and contact with released toxins. This can be achieved by stringent training of lab personnel and implementation of standard cell culture practices (Table 9 .1), which should be reviewed and revised regularly by laboratory members and the institute's safety committee. Additionally, when working with primary cells isolated directly from human tissue, it is important to screen donors from which cells were derived for disease-causing pathogens. Up-to-date immunizations against infectious diseases such as Hepatitis B are also highly recommended for laboratory staff working with primary cells.",

Indeed, microbiological infections represent the main problem for the maintenance of cells in vitro. Infectious agents such as bacteria are toxic for eukaryotic cells and ultimately lead to cell death. Furthermore, even low levels of contamination can result in abnormal results and lead to wrong scientific interpretations. By adhering to several techniques that ensure asepsis in the cell culture lab, researchers can reduce the frequency and extent of contaminations and diminish loss of cells, resources, and time. This can be achieved by eliminating the entry of microorganisms into the cell culture through contaminated equipment, media, cell culture components, incubators, work surfaces, and defect or opened cell culture vessels.",

The biosafety cabinet should be located in a laboratory space that does not interrupt its airflow through external sources of wind (e.g., drafts from windows or doors). Most biosafety cabinets require a warm-up time after which the work surface should be decontaminated with an antifungal detergent (e.g., 5% Trigene) followed by 70% ethanol. All equipment entering the biosafety cabinet also needs to be sprayed and wiped with 70% ethanol. The number of items used in the biosafety cabinet, however, should be kept at a minimum to Containers for waste (biohazardous) -To correctly dispose of waste avoid any obstruction of airflow. The biosafety cabinet should only be turned off after its daily use has been completed and the ultraviolet lamp may be turned on to sterilize the exposed surface areas over night. Regular maintenance also includes cleaning of the area under the work surface onto which media may spill through the grill. Furthermore, routine servicing through biosafety cabinet engineers can ensure correct airflow and full filter capacity of this important piece of cell culture equipment. It is critical to keep all other surfaces in contact with the cell culture vessels or media components clean. This includes the incubator, centrifuge, microscope, water bath, fridge, and freezer. Stainless steel incubators allow for easy cleaning and protect the surfaces from corrosion of the humid environment. Treatment solutions can be added to water baths to prevent the growth of microbes. On a larger scale, the equipment stored in the cell culture space should be kept free from dust and regular cleaning of cell culture floors is advisable.",

Cell cultures affected by bacterial contamination generally appear turbid in appearance. Furthermore, the high metabolic rates of bacteria can modify the pH of the culture media and thus change the color of phenol red to yellow. While bacteria may be detected as small particles at low microscope magnification, their distinct shapes are generally detected at higher magnification. While bacterial strains such as E. coli can therefore be uncovered quite easily due to their size (~2 \u03bcM) and flagellainduced mobility, other strains such as Mycoplasma are smaller in size (<1 \u03bcM), immobile, and therefore not as easily detectable. As a result, Mycoplasma infections can go unnoticed for a longer time and usually only become apparent through declining quality of the cultured cells. This can manifest as reduced cell proliferation and cell death. In order to monitor cell cultures for potential infections with Mycoplasma, it is advisable to routinely test cultures for their presence using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or immunostaining [2] .

The selected cell lines will also need to align with the available equipments and requirements of their specific hazard group. Cells cultured in the lab can be classified into three different types: primary cells, transformed cells, and self-renewing cells. Primary cells, such as fibroblasts obtained from skin biopsies and hepatocytes isolated from liver explants, are directly isolated from human tissue. Biomedical and translational research oftentimes relies on using these cell types since they are good representatives of their tissue of origin. However, there are stringent biosafety restrictions associated with handling these cell types. Furthermore, primary cells are generally characterized as \"finite\" and therefore rely on a continuous supply of stocks since their proliferation ceases after a limited amount of cell divisions and cell expansion is oftentimes impossible. Transformed cells can be generated either naturally or by genetic manipulation. While the use of such immortalized cell lines leads to a cellular platform that generates fast growth rates and stable conditions for maintenance and cloning, their manipulated genotype may result in karyotypic abnormalities and nonphysiological phenotypes. On the other hand, standardized cell lines derived from human or nonhuman species or (e.g., Chinese hamster ovary (CHO), HeLa, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC)) are oftentimes thoroughly characterized and may therefore be easier to set-up. Self-renewing cells include, for example, embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, neural and intestinal stem cells. These cells carry the capacity to differentiate into a diversity of other cells types, while their self-renewing property allows for long-term maintenance in vitro.

Serum provides cells with growth factors and hormones and acts as a carrier for lipids and enzymes, and the transportation of micronutrients and trace elements. Several labs, however, aim to reduce the supplementation of basal media with animal-derived factors such as serum since it is an undefined component that can highly vary between batches. It is also a costly cell culture product, carries the risk of causing undesired stimulatory or inhibitory effects on cellular growth and function, and may introduce contaminations if not sourced from reliable suppliers. Reduced-serum or serum-free media rely on formulations that reduce or replace serum with more defined components.

As the cells propagate, their growth requires energy supplied in the medium, for example in the form of glucose. When metabolized, its by-products include pyruvic acid, lactic acid, and CO 2 . Since the pH level is dependent on the balance of CO 2 and HCO 3 \u2212 (bicarbonate), the addition of bicarbonate-based buffers to cell culture media can equilibrate the CO 2 concentrations. Other pH buffers can be of organic nature and include 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) (10-25 mM) or 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) (20 mM). Many cell culture media contain pH indicators (e.g., phenol red), which display a color range between acidic (yellow) and alkaline (pink) conditions. Furthermore, fluctuations in atmospheric CO 2 concentrations can also alter the pH level. Cells should therefore be cultured in incubators that also allow for CO 2 tensions to be adjusted to 5-7%. To delay shifts in pH, glucose may be substituted by another carbon source such as galactose or fructose.

When relying on a specific concentration of live cells to start a culture or needing a specific number of live cells for an assay it is important to distinguish between live and dead cells. Cell counting is also helpful when assessing growth rates. Since cells are commonly cultured in the millions, the number of cells are first counted in a small volume and then extrapolated to the full cell volume. To achieve this, all cells are dissociated, pelleted, and evenly resuspended in a suitable medium volume. In a 1:1 dilution with 0.4% trypan Blue, a small volume of the cell suspension is mixed in an Eppendorf tube. Trypan Blue dye permeates only nonviable cells that can therefore be excluded from the subsequent quantification [6] . This occurs by loading 10 \u03bcL of the cell mixture in Trypan Blue onto a hemacytometer (Fig. 9.4) . Using an inverted microscope, phase contrast, and a magnification of at least 10X, all cells located in the four outer squares are counted. Viable cells contain a darker \"halo,\" while nonviable cells stain blue/black. To determine the total number of viable cells, the number of cells found in all four squares is divided by 4 (to determine the average cell number in 1 mm 2 ), multiplied by 10 4 (to obtain the cell number per mL), multiplied by 2 (to account for the dilution factor of Trypan Blue) and multiplied by the initial medium volume of the entire cell suspension. The percentage of viable cells can be determined by dividing the number of unstained cells by the total number of cells, and multiplying the ratio by 100. A healthy cell culture is characterized by 80-95% cell viability. The hemacytometer is prepared by covering both counting chambers with a cover glass. Subsequently, 10 \u03bcL of a 1:1 cell suspension with 0.4 % Trypan Blue is loaded onto the filling notch of one of the counting chambers. Through capillary action, this volume will cover the grid that can be observed in an inverted microscope at magnifications of at least 10X. The average of cells covering squares A-D determines the number of cells per mm 2 . Viable cells in these squares are counted by excluding nonviable cells that appear black due to their absorption of Trypan Blue through their permeable cell membranes.

            "text": "Culturing hIPSCs to study inherited liver diseases: Small pieces of skin biopsies obtained from patients with an inherited liver disease can be cultured in a Petri dish with fibroblast growth medium. Primary fibroblast cultures will emerge from the skin tissue after 2-3 days. Upon reaching ~80% confluency, the outgrown primary fibroblasts can be isolated from the skin tissue using enzymatic digestion with collagenase and subcultured in new vessels. This generates a pure population of fibroblasts, which can be scaled-up and virally transduced to express pluripotent genes (e.g., OCT4, NANOG, TRA-1-60), thereby \"reprogramming\" somatic cells to become hIPSCs [8] . hIPSCs in culture will pack together tightly in flat colonies with sharp edges and are characterized by their high nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio, ability to self-renew, and capacity to form cells of all three germ layers. As such, hIPSCs can be differentiated toward definitive endoderm using Wnt pathway activation and Activin A. Cells at this stage of differentiation will migrate from their colonies into a monolayer, downregulate their pluripotency genes and express markers of their endoderm fate (e.g., SOX17, CXCR4, GSC). Further changes in the media composition and exogenous growth factors added to the definitive endoderm cells will direct them toward foregut endoderm and subsequent specification to hepatic endoderm. The final stage of the hepatic differentiation medium yields hepatocyte-like cells that secrete albumin and other serum proteins, take up low-density lipoprotein (LDL), store glycogen, and metabolize drugs. Importantly, these cells will also display the disease phenotypes observed in the patient from which the skin biopsy was initially obtained. While this process allows researchers to study and rescue disease mechanisms ex vivo [9] , it also sheds light on liver development and the emergence of disease in utero.",

To achieve this goal, the cellular environment in vitro is oftentimes oversimplified and relies, for example, on a single cell type cultured in a monolayer. However, data generated from such a cellular system does not truly phenocopy the intricate cellular interactions between different cell types and extracellular matrices of an in vivo environment. To address this drawback, there is currently significant research into the design of cell cocultures that allow paracrine signaling between cells that cohabitate space in vivo, as well as bioartifical matrices that facilitate cellular growth in their native 3D orientation. The goal is the design of cellular systems that mimic the complexity of the multicellular in vivo niche, yet also allow standardization for cell culture assays.",

To delay senescence, viral transfection of primary cells can sequester tumor-suppressor proteins, thereby extending the number of possible passages and allowing the emergence of immortal cell lines. Although this facilitates their culture ex vivo, this technique also introduces the expression of carcinogenic genes. In addition, immortalized cell lines can acquire mutations during subculturing that can further interfere with the cellular phenotype and create a nonphysiological cell culture system. ",

The dissociated cells are collected in a sterile Falcon tube and the culture vessel should also be washed with a medium containing an inhibitor for the enzymatic digestion and dissociation of cells. Collected cells can then be concentrated and counted according to protocols 4.3 and 4.4 and seeded in new culture vessels at the desired concentrations. Lower cell concentrations (~10 4 cells/mL) are suitable for cell lines with fast proliferation rates, while higher cell concentrations (~10 5 cells/mL) are more adapted for cells with slower growth rates.",

In high (stock) concentrations, DMSO is toxic to personnel and cultured cells and therefore cannot be added to cells without prior dilution. This toxicity also affects cells in freezing medium containing 10% DMSO when left for several hours at room temperature, highlighting the need to transfer cells to \u221280\u00b0C for storage within 30 minutes. In general, chemically protective gloves should be worn to safeguard personnel from the hazards of DMSO and its solutes to easily penetrate membranes, including the skin.",
