The newly synthesized curcumin glucuronide compounds 2 and 3 along with curcumin 1 were tested and their anti-proliferative effects against KBM-5, Jurkat cell, U266, and A549 cell lines were reported. Biological data revealed that as much as 1 lM curcumin 1 exhibited anticancer activity and almost 100% cell kill was noted at 10 lM on two out of four cell lines; while curcumin mono-glucuronide 2 as well as di-glucuronide 3 displayed no suppression of cell proliferation. A series of new 1,3,4-oxadiazole derivatives (6a-6x) containing pyridine and acylhydrazone moieties were synthesized and developed as potential telomerase inhibitors. The bioassay tests demonstrated that compounds 6n, 6o, 6q, 6s and 6t exhibited significant broad-spectrum anticancer activity with IC 50 range from 0.76 to 9.59 lM against the four cancer cell lines (HEPG2, MCF7, SW1116 and BGC823). Moreover, all the title compounds were assayed for telomerase inhibition using the TRAP-PCR-ELISA assay. Compound 6s showed the highest anticancer activity with IC 50 of 0.76-1.54 lM against the tested cancer cell lines and exhibited the most potent telomerase inhibitory activity with IC 50 of 1.18 \u00b1 0.14 lM. Three dammarane triterpenes (1-3) including two new compounds (1) and (2) were isolated from a methanol extract of Panax ginseng leaves. Compounds 1-3 significantly increased interleukin-12 expression in LPS-activated mouse peritoneal macrophage. Furthermore, compound 1 strongly increased the Th1 response-mediated cytokine IL-2 and decreased Th2 response-mediated cytokines IL-4 and IL-6 expression. Fang Zheng*, Max Zhan, Xiaoqin Huang, Mohamed Diwan M. Abdul Hameed, Chang-Guo Zhan* Butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) has been an important protein used for development of anti-cocaine medication. It is also an established drug target to develop new treatment for Alzheimer's disease (AD). In the present study several mathematical models were generated using molecular docking, multi-linear regression and artificial neural network approaches, which provide tools for rationalizing identification of potential BChE inhibitors or selection of compounds for synthesis in the discovery of novel effective inhibitors of BChE in the future. We herein report the synthesis and evaluation of eighteen spiroisoxazoline oxindoles derivatives as p53-MDM2 interaction inhibitors. Seven compounds showed an antiproliferative profile superior to the p53-MDM2 interaction inhibitor nutlin-3, and induced cell death by apoptosis. Moreover, proofof-concept was demonstrated by inhibition of the interaction between p53 and MDM2 in a live-cell bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay.",
