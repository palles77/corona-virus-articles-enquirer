            "text": "This paper addresses the need for conceptual and analytic clarity on nutrition governance, an essential underpinning of more effective approaches for undernutrition, the 'single greatest constraint to global development' and obesity, which already accounts for 4% of the world's disease burden and is growing rapidly. The governance of nutrition, which is essential to designing and implementing policies to realise the right to food, is among the most important and most defining duties of society. But research and action on nutrition governance are hampered by the absence of conceptual rigour, even as the continuing very high burden of undernutrition and the rapid rise in obesity highlight the need for such structures. The breadth of nutrition itself suggests that governance is both needed and sure to be complicated. This analysis explores the reasons attention has come to governance in development policy making, and why it has focused on nutrition governance in particular. It then assesses how the concept of nutrition governance has been used, finding that it has become increasingly prominent in scholarship on poor nutritional outcomes, but remains weakly specified and is invoked by different authors to mean different things. Undernutrition analysts have stressed coordination problems and structural issues related to the general functioning of government. Those studying obesity have emphasised international trade policies, regulatory issues and corporate behaviour. This paper argues that the lack of a clear, operational definition of governance is a serious obstacle to conceptualising and solving major problems in nutrition. To address this need, it develops a unified definition of nutrition governance consisting of three principles: accountability, participation and responsiveness. These are justified with reference to the social contract that defines modern nations and identifies citizens as the ultimate source of national power and legitimacy. A unified framework is then employed to explore solutions to nutrition governance problems.",

The range of actors includes everything from individuals to the multinational food industry. The spectrum of influences is just as wide, including everything from personal preferences to national policies and global trade regimes, each of which has different sources of authority and legitimacy. In many scenarios, the lines of accountability are not obvious and even the relevant constituencies can be challenging to identify. Despite the profound influence of governance on nutrition, Sunguya et al have found that only 40% of low-income and middle-income country (LMIC) governments even have policies in this area. And although logic suggests that having a policy would be helpful, their analysis found no association with better nutrition outcomes. 8 In many places, rapid urbanisation is exacerbating weak governance problems, 9 and unregistered informal settlements expose the dysfunction of traditional welfare state approaches when citizens become invisible to the bureaucracy. 10 11 Where citizens do participate in the policy process, they may be ambivalent about issues experts view as urgent, 12 or their opinions may be influenced by food industry marketing or sponsored research. 13 14 How would one analyse or manage these complex issues?",

            "text": "governance and the development policy agenda Before the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, most aid was conditional on geopolitical alignment rather than on how states treated their own citizens. But after the Cold War, economic and political rights issues were no longer enmeshed in the larger US-Soviet ideological struggle. Freed from this constraint, western donors began to project their own political convictions via democratisation and governance projects. The growth of the rights movement and several international agreements on rights in the early 1990s testifies further to the power of this shift. 20 When the concern for state alignment evaporated, it helped bring attention to the role of governance in translating development aid into poverty reduction. This was an important factor in the introduction and subsequent popularity of the Sector Wide Approaches (SWAps) and other general budget support mechanisms that blossomed in the 1990s. 21 After mixed results from the 1980s' Washington Consensus aid approach, it was also clear that the market alone would not solve all problems; the rise of governance was a partial retreat from that position, 22 as was the embrace of public-private partnerships. 23 Weaknesses in governance at various levels from the national to the global drew attention as constraints to health systems. 24 The proliferation of actors in global health also spurred calls for better governance because of the need for coordination and accountability. 25 Targeted aid and democratisation projects became even more closely linked after the 9/11 attacks brought emphasis in US policymaking to the problems of failed states and poor populations. After 9/11, US assistance was directed to poor people in failed states in hopes of preventing scarcity-induced radicalizsation. The emphasis on safety nets and social protection could be read as a move by donors to enhance democratic participation by the poor. 26 However, these actions also fit neatly in the long legacy of aid programmes targeting health issues primarily because of their impact on trade and markets. 27 In the last 10 years, governance has become a well-established subfield in global health, in part because many problems related to governance have become more obvious. Governance was a natural follow-on focus after the decentralisation policies widely promoted in the 1990s, particularly because many of the formal policies and institutions designed to promote local engagement had not actually democratised decision making. 28 But the growing attention to governance also reflects rapid globalisation. The rising threat of disease and the growth of interstate commerce both increase the need for shared decision making between diverse groups and entities. 29 30 Globalisation has also highlighted the need for governance over both health and trade, which since World War II have been institutionalised distinctly. 31 Large-scale disease outbreaks, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 and Ebola in West Africa in 2014 have made visible the importance of functioning governance mechanisms in health. [32] [33] [34] Trade-related non-communicable diseases linked to tobacco, processed foods and other goods have exposed shortcomings in existing structures. 35 International actors have recognised governance in many of their projects and analyses. Beginning in 1996, the World Bank began collecting governance indicators every other year; since 2002, it has collected these data annually from 212 countries and territories. 36 World Bank projects classified as 'Public Sector Governance' have become far more numerous over the years. In the 1980s, there were 304 such projects. In the 1990s, there 20 The multiplication of new NGOs, UN entities, corporations and others engaged in nutrition has continued and represents a growing challenge for coordination. 25 39 Additionally, the complexity of nutrition and its engagement with a great many sectors-agriculture, education, trade, health and others-present many coordination challenges. Second, food and nutrition interventions could be targeted at the community level and could give voice to poor citizens by promoting their participation. Hence, they were seen as natural vehicles to advance donors' general priorities in economic and political rights, and in attempting to prevent scarcity-induced radicalisation in failed states. More broadly, donors attempted to enhance democratic participation by the poor, but questions of how donor-driven governance models were supposed to interact with existing governance structures largely went unaddressed. 26 Third, the advance of globalisation highlighted the need for supranational regulation and strengthened governance at all levels. In 1999, Lang argued that globalisation was undermining traditional governance of food because national authority was not capable to regulating multinational businesses or countering their marketing. 40 The global growth of fast food and advertising largely bypassed health authorities because it was regulated internationally only as a trade issue with little reference to health consequences. 41 Others have advanced similar points on the importance of 'food governance', 42 for food and nutrition, perhaps similar to the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control, and coordinated action by the World Bank, WHO and the UN. 35 43 44 Fourth, real food prices rose quickly in the 2000s, peaking in 2008 and 2011, driven by depreciation in the dollar, diversion of some crops to biofuel use, oil price appreciation, export restrictions, demand surges, droughts and other factors. 45 46 Between 2000 and 2011, food prices increased 183% in real terms. 47 The disastrous humanitarian consequences of this increase, including conflict and instability, 48 generated political motivation for discussing food security, agriculture and trade policy and other aspects of global nutrition, particularly with respect to undernutrition. [49] [50] [51] Fifth, multilateral organisations and academics have been active. Governance was identified as one of the principal weaknesses in global nutrition by WHO's Commission on Social Determinants of Health in 2008 52 ; a Lancet commission cited governance problems as a central obstacle to effective international intervention against undernutrition. 53 Also in 2008 (formalised 2011), the Food and Agriculture Organization, Unicef and World Food Programme (WFP) agreed to launch Renewed Efforts Against Child Hunger and undernutrition (REACH) to strengthen UN actions to fight hunger and malnutrition by coordinating actions within recipient countries. In 2009-2010, WHO and many partners launched the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) movement to spur progress against undernutrition. 54 In 2010, WHO's Nutrition Landscape Information System launched with a series of governance indicators, 55 which has made it easier to quantify and demonstrate the large impact of governance on nutrition. 8 Since 2011, REACH has focused on strengthening nutrition management and governance, and supporting multisectoral nutrition actions, such as nutrition-sensitive programming. 39 56 These multilateral efforts have all brought attention to governance, although some have attracted criticism for expanding the influence of the private sector in public health policy. 57 58 This historical analysis reveals why nutrition governance is so crucial. First, it is essential to realise the right to food. Second, it is a tractable place to advance development through encouraging participation and democratisation, and as such is a powerful lever to realise many rights. Third, it is needed to coordinate between the many sectors important to nutrition, and among the many agencies and entities operating domestically and internationally. Fourth, it is required to address the affects of trade on health, particularly in the globalised food industry.",

            "text": "The need for governance A review of the literature identified in this search finds that most authors use 'governance' in explanation of their primary findings, but usually do not focus on governance itself. In this usage, one theme could be called 'the need for governance', which investigates problems and BMJ Global Health explains them with reference to weak or missing governance. At the global level, this literature includes calls for better governance as global and national policy environments become more complex 59 and the globalisation of the food industry overwhelms existing governance structures. 60 Governance problems are central to the maldistribution underlying local or regional food insecurity even though global production is adequate. 61 Quality of governance was identified as an important determinant of progress towards the Millennium Development Goals and successful primary healthcare implementation, 62 and as a fundamental component of high performing states: '\u2026the most effective, relevant national policies will emerge from a system of governance that firmly connects the needs of the poor to a politically responsive local government that has the technical and institutional capacity to act'. 3 A high-profile Lancet article focusing mainly on the global level identified accountability and participation as leading problems: 'The international community needs to identify and establish a new global governance structure that can provide greater accountability and participation for civil society and the private sector'. 53 The WHO Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes has provisions for punishing violators, but governance problems have rendered the code largely unenforced and ineffective. [63] [64] [65] Donors have attempted to promote accountability and participation mechanisms, but many interventions do not translate into benefits for those not already enfranchised, such as women, 66 and many efforts have been assailed by activists for advancing private sector influence in public health processes. 58 67 68 The importance of nutrition governance is demonstrated by experiences and analyses in many national and local contexts, as well. Some of the largest are collective action problems. 69 In India, which has among the highest burdens related to suboptimal nutrition, governance problems have been deemed more significant than scientific or technical obstacles, 70 and is needed to translate economic growth into progress against undernutrition. 71 Looking at urban areas of the same country, Bhojani et al characterised the main governance problems as weak regulation of quality in the private sector; poor coordination across care providers in the public and private sectors and between clinics, health centres and hospitals; rampant bribery and the absence of systems to respond to formal grievances or provide accountability to citizens. 72 In a policy analysis of maternal and child health in Pakistan, Siddiqi et al argued that good governance is needed to translate policies into results. 73 In a discussion of food security and fisheries, weaknesses in governance were revealed in overfishing, depletion of stocks, minimal enforcement, low oversight and inadequate coordination of policies and actions between national and global authorities. 74 Understanding governance structures is also extremely important for designing strategies to advance food policy on political agendas. 75 The politics of food policy hinges both on government leadership and activism by civil society organisations. 76 Others used 'governance' as an organising category to identify coordination problems, which arise from nutrition's intersectoral nature, as reported in India and Brazil, to name two examples. 77 78 Coordination problems can arise at the intersection of public and private sectors-the Bangladesh Government attempted to advance governance in its policies, but the exercise's impact was attributed to NGO partners. 79 Some analysts have assessed the effect of governance through comparative and synthetic investigations. In a comparison of fragile states, those with higher quality of governance were more likely to join SUN, while the 'prevalence of malnutrition, health system functioning and level of citizen empowerment had little or no impact' on the decision to join. 80 A synthetic review of 58 controlled evaluations argued that 'nutrition is now recognised to be a governance issue', and that better governance was associated with lower prevalence of child undernutrition. 81 A comparison of water quality in Brazil, Ecuador and Malawi found '\u2026that access to safe water could be improved if certain water governance challenges were addressed: coordination and data sharing between minis-tries\u2026; monitoring and enforcement of water quality laws; and sufficient technical capacity to improve administrative and technical management of water services\u2026'\" 82 'Governance' has also been used as a general category for describing specific interventions, many of them successful. Extensive community engagement helped address governance problems in Vietnam. 83 Collaboration and coordination problems were resolved with shared governance structures in Colombia. 84 In both Australia and the UK, the clarity and transparency of governance arrangements was important to facilitating cooperation and coordination in obesity reduction efforts. 85 86 In the Philippines, long-term capacity building in both the public and private sectors has facilitated governance by collecting and analysing data to generate evidence for improving policymaking. 87 Systematic data analysis in Haiti has helped to elucidate many factors that promoted good nutrition governance, including 'effective evidence-based advocacy, partnerships and design, implementation and scale-up of nutrition-specific and sensitive interventions'. 88 Another area of scholarship using governance has focused on citizen attitudes and perceptions to explore why technically sound policies are challenging to adopt and implement. Reasons include popular ambivalence towards experts' opinion, 12 or the shaping of debate by food industry marketing or sponsored research. 13 14 Contested views of the role of the state versus the private sector were central to the growing obesity epidemic in Australia, where many people did not want the state to counter fast food advertising. 89 Also, politicians were the least trusted group for information on food, according to a telephone survey by the same researchers (farmers were the most trusted). 90 This contest for influence is very difficult for public health advocates. Denmark introduced a saturated fat tax in 2011, supported with BMJ Global Health public health arguments, but it was opposed by the food industry and related actors. Although the tax began to change the national diet as public health advocates had hoped, the tax had no organised supporters and the food industry successfully lobbied for its abolishment the following year. 91 Calls for improved governance were not always matched by clarity about exactly what is needed, suggesting that governance can be challenging to specify and is not always discussed in meaningful detail. Given the complexity and vagueness of both 'nutrition' and 'governance', this finding is hardly surprising. Others have reached this same conclusion. A systematic review of health system barriers to antiretroviral therapy provision found that many authors cited governance problems, but the collective evidence was weak because individual cases included too little context to convey what this meant in detail. 92 In a systematic review of the impact of health systems and policies on behaviour change to promote child survival in LMICs, Velez et al concluded, 'The evidence directly addressing how to improve the financing and governance of health systems was weak or not available'. 93 Another broad review focused on agriculture research, finding that despite vast influence of governance on the agriculture-nutrition impact, only six studies, just 4% of the sample, actually focused on governance. 94 Addressing nutrition governance directly A far smaller portion of the literature reviewed in this study focused directly on nutrition governance, typically regarding undernutrition. In historical perspective, undernutrition, hunger and food insecurity are all wellknown problems that surely predate the written record, whereas obesity has become a public health concern only very recently. In this light, it may not be surprising that a majority of the papers on nutrition governance concerned undernutrition and concentrated on the governance issues related to that problem. The major institutional actors mentioned in the literature review focus the preponderance of activities on undernutrition, including Unicef, SCN, WFP and WHO, and major initiatives such as SUN and REACH, although both Unicef and WHO have smaller portfolios targeting obesity.",

            "text": "Other authors invoked governance to discuss or analyse a limited subset of concepts. For instance, the highly influential Lancet paper by Morris et al focused on governance barriers to international action against undernutrition that could be categorised as coordination, accountability and distributional. 53 These categories are intuitive because they are at the root of food insecurity, and have long been important in undernutrition scholarship and programming. Coordination problems are common because undernutrition often relates to complicated circumstances in which many actors operate without clear lines of authority, responsibility or accountability. Conflict, natural disaster and multiple failures of markets and/or states are all common settings for undernutrition. The UN System Standing Committee on Nutrition (SCN) was founded in 1977 (as SubCommittee on Nutrition) with the express purpose of coordinating UN actions against nutrition problems. 96 A major stated reason for launching SUN in 2010 was to harmonise views, policies and actions across a broader set of stakeholders including countries and donors. 97 98 The proliferation of global health actors has exacerbated this problem further. 99 Accountability problems are commonly referenced because many analysts view governments as guarantors of food security, and insecurity thus represents a government failure, which might be rectified or reduced if governments were more accountable to their citizens. The intersectoral nature of food security also means that many parts of a government may be responsible, but hard to hold accountable. 70 100 Increasing the participation and voice of at-risk groups is a common recommendation. 81 One important pathway is that greater participation and better governance are associated with improved access to safe water, although there are likely many more, as well. 100 101 Adequacy of global food production and its persistent scarcity in particular settings points to distribution, or allocation issues. 100 The same dynamic plays out within countries, where poor distribution systems leave some areas vulnerable even as food is sufficient when measured at the national level. 102 Distributional issues are not strictly limited to food-the distribution of rights and entitlements are also core governance issues with large implications for nutrition. 73 103 104 Among the most prominent nutrition governance frameworks identified in this review was developed at the Institute for Development Studies by Mej\u00eda Acosta and Fanzo, and Haddad et al. 105 106 The framework highlights cooperation and coordination-both prominent themes in undernutrition as explained above-and also adds sustainable funding and monitoring and advocacy. The explicit inclusion of funding recognises the central requirement of adequate resources, which the authors characterise as the 'cement' that holds cooperation and coordination together. 105 The monitoring and advocacy category acknowledges the need for governments to collect relevant information and produce analyses to BMJ Global Health understand where there are problems, design and implement solutions and track progress. Advocacy represents the critical role of civil society in detecting problems, raising awareness and facilitating solutions, whether by direct delivery or influencing the government.",

Representation, participation, voice, accountability and regulation all are rooted in national structures and are easy to circumvent for MNCs. Where accountability is discussed, it emphasises corporate accountability 108 and tends to focus on global level regulatory issues concerning trade and health. 42 Addressing the Australian context, Sacks et al developed a matrix of sectors and governance levels for thinking about some of these issues, which they used to identify policy options. 109 The sectors ranged from primary production and food processing to distributions, marketing, retail and catering/food service. Governance levels include local, state, national and international. Although the authors do not use the term, this can be considered a nutrition governance framework. Sacks et al identify policy issues and the level of government where they may be addressed. For example, in food processing, safety standards are usually a state government responsibility and product composition standards are usually decided at the national level.",

A main limitation is that the frameworks explain only the part of nutrition governance on which they are focused, but do not illuminate the larger landscape. Additionally, the lack of a philosophical basis means that they have difficulty explaining their priorities or defending their boundaries, should the need arise. For instance, the frameworks by Morris et al and Mej\u00eda Acosta and Fanzo do not include participation or transparency among their central elements. This choice may reflect that the dominant historical problem in undernutrition is inadequate food, and in this perspective the most basic citizen view can be presumed-the demand for more food. It may also reflect a strong focus on the multilateral architecture of aid, which tends to neglect crucial factors such as domestic political commitment. A full-text search of the Sacks et al framework article does not find a single mention of either 'cooperation' or 'coordination'.

At one time, undernutrition was the only nutrition problem, and when obesity first emerged as a public health problem it was confined to relatively distinct geographies. This is no longer the case.

This conceptualisation emphasises the structural or formalised elements of the process, which is reflected in common usage of 'governance' in connection with a normative judgement, as in good or strong governance, or bad or weak governance.

Accountability recognises citizens as the source of state power. Participation comes from the recognition that state legitimacy is conditioned on the consent of those governed. Responsiveness refers to the timeliness of the link between what people want, as expressed by participation, and the accountability that may be exercised when needed services are not forthcoming. With particular reference to nutrition, timeliness can be of vital importance, and thus responsiveness is elevated to primary status along with accountability and participation, even though it could be argued that these latter two principles should already reflect responsiveness. Evaluating governance means that each principle should be measured with reference to the authority and legitimacy granted by citizens and their judgements of performance. Stated concisely:",

Aligning services with wants thus addresses the problem, meaning that people who need food then get food. Obesity problems are different-people get too much of what they want, or want unhealthful things (these are also causes of undernutrition-overweight). Because of this, obesity can-and does-occur where governance structures function well. In such cases, a principal challenge lies in the contest for perception and opinion on food and related policies. The formal structural governance problems are subtle because they concern broad political economy issues that are hard to analyse and remain unknown to many people. These include tax policy, agricultural policies, inadequate government authority and regulatory capture and ineffectiveness.

Under the assumption that people do not want to be undernourished, then the problem can be crudely characterised as unmet demand-citizens are not getting a service entitlement they need and want. Some of these issues may also underlie obesity problems, but those scenarios are additionally characterised by more insidious dynamics. Accountability and participation can be strong, but may be corrupted by marketing and other influences on citizen perception. The demands expressed by citizens may be accurately-and harmfully-expressed in unhealthy foods, habits and environments.

The clarification of the three basic governance principles of accountability, participation and responsiveness provides categories for assessing government performance and aid programmes alike.

Undernutrition tends to affect the most vulnerable and is prioritised in the Sustainable Development Goals for that reason. With particular reference to obesity, many of the governance problems identified by this paper have international dimensions that constrain national policy solutions. Globalisation is increasing the importance of this dynamic and points to an urgent need for supranational regulation of the food industry and concerted efforts to contest the perceptions it advances through marketing.
