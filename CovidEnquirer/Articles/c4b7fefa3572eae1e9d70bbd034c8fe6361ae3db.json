However, numerous systemic illnesses and diseases of other organs can produce signs and symptoms that are indistinguishable from primary liver diseases. The hepatic manifestations in these disorders may range from mild enzyme abnormalities to significant liver injury and liver failure. In this chapter, we will review liver involvement in selected systemic disorders such as heart disease, pulmonary disease, amyloidosis, connective tissue disorders, Reye's syndrome, jejunoileal bypass, and hematological disorders. Other systemic disorders with hepatic involvement, such as sarcoidosis, cystic fibrosis, and sepsis, are covered elsewhere in this textbook.",

            "text": "Liver involvement occurs in patients with both acute and chronic heart disease and its spectrum ranges from asymptomatic increases in liver biochemistries to fulminant liver failure. The liver receives a significant portion of the cardiac output and therefore any condition that decreases cardiac output will lead to a fall in hepatic perfusion. The liver is able to compensate for changes in hepatic blood flow via vasoactive mechanisms and by increasing oxygen extraction during periods of hepatic hypoperfusion. 1 However, when critical levels of left or right heart failure are reached, hepatic injury may occur. In right-sided heart failure, it has been suggested that this damage is caused by elevation in right atrial pressure, leading to elevation in hepatic venous pressure that causes distention of hepatic sinusoids and liver cell hypoxia. In left-sided heart failure, decreased cardiac output results in diminished hepatic perfusion, which leads to hepatic hypoxia. In general terms, liver involvement in right heart failure is referred to as congestive hepatopathy, whereas liver injury resulting from left heart failure is known as ischemic hepatitis. However, these two phenomena often coexist and may be indistin-guishable in clinical practice. The final common pathway for liver damage appears to be centrilobular (zone III) hepatocellular necrosis. This portion of the liver lobule is the most vulnerable to hypoxic injury due to the organization of the liver acinus. Highly oxygenated blood enters the hepatic lobule via branches of the hepatic artery and portal vein in the periportal region. As it passes through the hepatic sinusoids toward the terminal hepatic venule, oxygen is extracted and hepatocytes in the centrilobular area are perfused by blood that is the least well oxygenated. 1",

Right heart failure can be isolated (due to cor pulmonale or primary pulmonary hypertension) or, more likely, a consequence of left ventricular failure. In a large study of 175 patients with both acute and chronic right heart failure, 2 hepatomegaly was present by physical examination in over 90% and splenomegaly in 20% of these patients. 2 Other findings of right heart failure, such as peripheral edema, pleural effusion, and ascites, were also frequently present (Table 56-1) . Ascites is more prominent in patients with chronic right heart failure than in acute right heart failure. 2 Characteristic changes in histology are seen in the liver of patients with congestive heart failure. On gross inspection, the congested liver appears enlarged and purple with blunt edges. 3 The classically described \"nutmeg\" appearance is caused by alternative areas of pale, more normal-appearing parenchyma contrasting with congested, hemorrhagic areas that correspond to the centrilobular regions of the liver (Figure 56-1) . Microscopically, central veins and sinusoids in the centrilobular region become dilated and engorged with erythrocytes. Inflammation is noticeably absent (Figure 56 -2). Adjacent hepatocytes may become compressed and atrophied. With long-standing hepatic congestion, fibrosis and cirrhosis may develop (cardiac cirrhosis) (Figure 56-3) .",

Cummings heart failure, hyperbilirubinema occurs in over 20% of patients. 2 The elevation is generally mild, less than 3 mg/dl, and composed predominantly of unconjugated bilirubin. Serum aminotransferase levels are usually normal or minimally elevated in compensated, chronic congestive heart failure, but may become elevated during exacerbations of heart failure. Prothrombin time is prolonged in the majority of patients with hepatic congestion from right heart failure. Patients anticoagulated with warfarin sodium (warfarin) for dilated cardiomyopathy may have decreased warfarin requirements during exacerbations of congestive heart failure and this effect, if not appreciated, could result in dangerously prolonged prothrombin times. Hepatic biochemical abnormalities generally improve with improvement in cardiac function. Several signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure (e.g., ascites, pedal edema, mild hyperbilirubinemia) are also seen in patients with decompensated hepatic cirrhosis and distinguishing these two entities may be difficult. In some patients, it is particularly difficult to distinguish cardiac ascites from cirrhotic ascites clinically. In such cases, characterization of ascitic fluid or measurement of hepatic venous pressure gradient may be of assistance. In a prospective study of 13 patients with cardiac ascites, the serum ascites albumin concentration gradient was 1.1 g/dl and the total protein was 2.5 g/dl. 3 Additionally, cardiac ascites had significantly more ascitic fluid red cell counts and higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase. 3",

Transiently decreased cardiac output seen in patients with arrhythmia or valvular heart disease may also result in hepatic injury even in the absence of bona fide hypotension (? relative hypotension). 9 Episodes of hypotension resulting in ischemic hepatitis may be very brief and sometimes there may not be any documented episodes of hypotension. Although diminished hepatic perfusion from systemic hypotension (either absolute or relative) is essential, a recent study suggested that systemic hypotension or shock alone is insufficient to cause ischemic hepatitis. 10 In this study, 31 patients with ischemic hepatitis were compared to a control group consisting of 31 previously healthy subjects with major non-hepatic trauma and marked hypotension (mean systolic pressure of 54 \u00b1 22 mmHg lasting for a mean of 19 \u00b1 14 minutes). All 31 patients with ischemic hepatitis had organic heart disease and more than 90% had demonstrable right heart failure. None of the subjects in the control group developed ischemic hepatitis despite profound hypotension. These findings suggest that right heart failure with passive hepatic congestion renders the liver susceptible to ischemic liver injury during transient systemic hypotension. 10 Henrion et al. recently published a paper that described clinical and hemodynamic features of 142 episodes of ischemic hepatitis. When ischemic hepatitis occurred in patients with congestive heart failure or acute heart failure, the hepatic hypoxia resulted primarily from the decreased hepatic blood flow and venous congestion. However, when ischemic hepatitis occurred in patients with toxic or septic shock, oxygen delivery to liver was decreased but oxygen needs were increased, leading to hepatic hypoxia. 11 Non-cardiogenic causes of ischemic hepatitis include hypovolemic shock from hemorrhage or dehydration, heat stroke, and septic shock. [12] [13] [14] Rare episodes of ischemic hepatitis have been reported in patients who ingest vasoactive medication (ergotamine overdose) and after protracted seizures in children. 15, 16 ",

Less marked elevation (<500 U/l) have also been reported in biopsyproven ischemic hepatitis. Serum LDH activity is also markedly elevated in patients with ischemic hepatitis. When fractionated, serum LDH activity is mostly of hepatic origin. 17 The level of LDH may rise to 30 times the upper limits of normal and parallels the pattern of aminotransferase activity, with a brisk rise and rapid resolution. Of note, the serum LDH is usually only slightly elevated in patients with acute viral hepatitis. Marked elevations of alkaline phosphatase or serum bilirubin are unusual in ischemic hepatitis and cholestasis has not been demonstrated on liver biopsies of those patients. Mild elevations of serum bilirubin may be seen, but this rarely exceeds four times the upper limit of normal. 17 In one series of patients with ischemic hepatitis, additional biochemical features were noted that might be helpful in diagnosis. 7 All patients in this series had transient abnormalities of serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen. These changes were sometimes marked, consistent with acute renal failure, but resolved over 7-10 days. The authors speculated that the same hypotensive insult to the liver had similar adverse effects on the kidney. Both hyper- glycemia and hypoglycemia can be seen. 5, 17, 18 In one series, two-thirds of patients with ischemic hepatitis had new-onset hyperglycemia that occurred within 48 hours of their illness. 18 In another report, hypoglycemia was seen in 33% of the patients with ischemic hepatitis. 5 Histologic studies of ischemic hepatitis are limited. Patients in whom a diagnosis of ischemic hepatitis is being considered are usually critically ill, often with multiorgan failure, making a liver biopsy impractical. Nevertheless, the hallmark of ischemic hepatitis is centrilobular necrosis in the absence of an inflammatory infiltrate. 19 Gibson and Dudley studied 17 patients with these characteristic histologic findings and concluded that a diagnosis of ischemic hepatitis could be made without a liver biopsy in the appropriate clinical setting (patients who had a potential cause for a fall in cardiac output) and a rapid rise in levels of serum aminotransferases and LDH. 17",

The clearance of certain medications (e.g., lidocaine, calcium-channel blockers) is dependent on hepatic blood flow and their clearance can be greatly diminished in this setting. Indeed, an association has been reported between the use of calcium-channel blockers and antiarrhythmic agents in patients with ischemic hepatitis and increased mortality, although it was not clear from that study if the worse prognosis was merely related to the presence of more severe cardiac disease. 22 Opiates and analgesics that are often prescribed for these critically ill patients also have the potential to accumulate and cause neurologic and respiratory depression. It has been suggested that the risk of acetaminophen toxicity is increased in patients with underlying cardiomyopathy, even at low doses in the absence of alcohol ingestion. 23 The prognosis of ischemic hepatitis is largely dependent upon the prognosis of the underlying illness. Short-term mortality has been reported to be as high as 50% in patients with ischemic hepatitis. One-month and 1-year survival rates for patients with ischemic hepatitis in the series by Henrion et al. were 47% and 28%, respectively. 11 However, despite the massive hepatic necrosis that may occur, deaths due to hepatic failure are extremely rare; the cause of death is usually a result of poor cardiac reserve. 4 The aminotransferase levels do not seem to have any prognostic significance. When stratified according to peak AST activity, the survival for patients with AST levels lower than 2000 IU/l was 43%, compared to 41% for patients with a peak AST activity above this value. The pattern of AST activity, however, does seem to have some prognostic value. In patients with ischemic hepatitis who died, the level of serum AST did not drop appreciably from peak values while in those who survived, AST levels rapidly returned towards normal, suggesting improving cardiac function. 4",

It has been noted that ascites is more prominent than pedal edema. 28 Histological features are usually non-specific: diffuse centrilobular congestion, necrosis, and fibrosis are the most common, but there may be mild abnormalities such as patchy fibrosis without congestion. Occasionally, there can be prominent sinusoidal dilation and hemorrhagic necrosis with hepatic vein thrombosis, leading to a misdiagnosis of Budd-Chiari syndrome. 29, 30 Tuberculosis remains an important cause of constrictive pericarditis, but other etiologies, such as cardiac surgery, connective tissue disorders, subclinical viral pericarditis, and malignancy, are becoming increasingly frequent. Pericardial calcification on chest radiography and low voltage on electrocardiography, when present, are very suggestive of constrictive pericarditis.

[32] [33] [34] [35] A recent study investigated the details of hemodynamic and oxygen transportation abnormalities in 19 consecutive episodes of hypoxic hepatitis caused by acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory failure without left heart failure. 11 These patients had marked arterial hypoxemia (mean PaO 2 34 mmHg and PaCO 2 64 mmHg) with elevated central venous pressure but an elevated cardiac index and low systemic vascular resistance. Oxygen delivery was significantly decreased in these patients, despite reasonable hepatic blood flow, as measured by the low-dose galactose clearance test. 11 The authors suggested that hypoxic hepatitis induced by acute exacerbation of chronic respiratory failure is due to severe arterial hypoxemia in the background of elevated central venous pressure and passive hepatic congestion. 11, 33 Most patients with hypoxic hepatitis caused by respiratory diseases have accompanying cardiac dysfunction; however, there are reports of severe obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) leading to hypoxic hepatitis in the absence of any cardiac dysfunction. 33 A recent study suggests that chronic intermittent hypoxemia may cause chronic low-grade hepatic injury in patients with OSA. 36 Chin et al. investigated the relationship between liver enzyme abnormalities and intermittent hypoxemia in 40 obese men with OSA. In this study, the prevalence of unexplained elevations in transaminases in obese patients with OSA was 35%. More interestingly, the authors systematically evaluated the effect of treatment with nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) on the levels of aminotransferases, insulin, and glucose in 40 obese subjects with OSA. There was a significant decrease in the levels of transaminases after overnight, 1 month, and 6 months of nasal CPAP treatment, with no significant changes in the degree of insulin resistance (Table 56-3) .",

[37] [38] [39] [40] [41] The hepatic effects of jejunoileal bypass include fatty infiltration, cirrhosis, and progressive liver failure. This procedure is rarely, if ever, performed today, so new diagnoses of liver disease related to jejunoileal bypass are unusual. However, patients who have had surgery decades ago may present with end-stage liver disease, on occasion being referred to centers for consideration of liver transplantation. Rarely, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis has been reported following gastric partitioning surgery. 42",

The bypass procedure results in malabsorption of a number of nutrients, which accounts for some of its weight-loss effects and many of the associated complications. Early researchers noted the similarities of fatty infiltration seen in patients with protein malnutrition and in patients after jejunoileal bypass. 43 Serum levels of essential amino acids were decreased when measured during the period of rapid weight loss and there was a concurrent increase in fatty infiltration of the liver. In a control group of patients who had stable weights after jejunoileal bypass, serum amino acid levels were higher and there was less hepatic steatosis. Nutritional supplements were reported to decrease the extent of hepatic injury in some patients, although others experienced continued deterioration.",

In untreated patients, hepatic lipid content as measured by morphologic assessment was elevated and remained abnormal over a 12-month period in most patients. In patients treated with metronidazole, hepatic fat content that was initially elevated following the bypass surgery decreased once the drug was started. In another group, in whom metronidazole was administered intermittently, levels of hepatic fat increased and then decreased in concert with antibiotic therapy. Moreover, in this study there was no correlation between hepatic steatosis and protein malnutrition. The mechanism of hepatic injury, although perhaps related to bacterial overgrowth, remains unknown. ",

Requarth and co-workers 53 reported the long-term morbidity following jejunoileal bypass in 453 patients. During the follow-up, 24 patients developed acute liver failure (7%) and the actuarial 15-year probability of cirrhosis was 8.1%. In the early stages of hepatic injury associated with jejunoileal bypass, liver enzyme abnormalities do not correlate with histologic findings and are therefore of limited value in identifying patients at risk for liver failure. 51, 52, 54 Mild elevations of serum aminotransferases and alkaline phosphatase levels may occur, but many patients with significant histologic changes have no biochemical abnormalities. Serial liver biopsies may be helpful in following the progression of liver disease. Once overt liver failure develops, elevation of serum bilirubin, a further fall in serum albumin, and prolongation of prothrombin time will be evident. In these patients, a trial of parenteral vitamin K administration is worthwhile to exclude malabsorption as a contributing cause to the coagulopathy.",

None of these patients died as a result of liver failure. Onethird of these patients had abnormalities of at least two different liver enzymes. The most common finding was hepatic congestion, although the authors felt that this lesion was most likely a result of the terminal event. As in the previous study, hepatic steatosis was very common and was found in 73% of patients. Twelve percent of patients had chronic hepatitis. Of interest, 21% of patients had histological evidence of arteritis, a finding previously considered rare in patients with SLE. Hepatic infarction occurred in 1 patient. Nodular regenerative hyperplasia, a lesion characterized by diffuse nodularity in the absence of associated fibrosis, was seen in 3 patients.",

It is characterized by fever, cytopenia, liver dysfunction, and lymphadenopathy. This complication developed in nearly 10% of the patients with SLE seen at Yokohama City University Hospital over a 10-year period. 64 The interpretation of any studies of liver disease in patients with SLE is complicated by comorbid conditions and the potential for drug toxicities that may mimic chronic liver disease. All of the above-mentioned studies were performed prior to the availability of hepatitis C testing. Thus, hepatitis C virus (HCV) cannot be excluded as a cause for some of the liver enzyme elevations or the abnormal hepatic histology. This is particularly important since substantial number of patients with SLE received blood transfusions prior to 1991. In addition, most patients in these studies received varying doses of prednisone and this could explain the frequent finding of hepatic steatosis in these patients.",

PBC is common in both primary and secondary forms of Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. In a study of 300 patients with primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, 7% of the patients had elevated antimitochondrial antibody titers. 84 Of these, 60% had elevations of alkaline phosphatase. Liver biopsies revealed changes of early PBC, even in many patients with normal liver enzymes. 84 Over the last decade, there have been numerous investigations exploring the relationship between HCV and Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. In 1992, Haddad and colleagues 85 postulated a causal relationship between Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome and HCV. The reported prevalence of HCV in patients with Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome depends on the methods of detection, population studied, and the criteria for diagnosing primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. In European patients, the prevalence ranges between 14 and 19% by third-generation enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and 5-19% by the second-generation immunoblot (RIBA-2) method, whereas HCV prevalence by RIBA-2 was only 0-1% in American patients. 86 HCV prevalence is much lower when the polymerase chain reaction method is used to detect HCV or when more objective criteria are applied to define primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. 87 Based on the current evidence, HCV seems to be a rare cause of primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome except in patients with liver involvement or cryoglobulinemia. 86 Furthermore, HCV is a sialotropic virus and morphological evidence of sialadenitis is found in a significant proportion of patients with chronic HCV infection. [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] In HCV-related sialadenitis, the lymphocytic infiltrate is predominantly pericapillary (unlike periductal, in primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome) and clinical symptoms of dryness are infrequent.",

Since then, the association between these two autoimmune disorders has been well established. The close immunologic association between PBC and scleroderma is supported by the finding of positive antimitochondrial antibodies in more than one-quarter of patients with scleroderma and anticentromere antibody in one-quarter of patients with PBC. In a recent study of 40 patients with systemic and localized scleroderma, liver biopsy-confirmed PBC was seen in 5 patients (12.5%). 92 Sometimes, patients with PBC develop symptomatology consistent with scleroderma. In a review of 558 patients with PBC, 4% were found to have symptoms of CREST syndrome. 93 Clinical manifestations of CREST often antedated the development of PBC by as much as 28 years.",

The declining incidence of Reye's syndrome in the USA and UK is temporally associated with public health warnings about the risk of Reye's syndrome after the use of aspirin in children with varicella and influenza-like illnesses. 96, 98 In countries where aspirin is inadvertently used in children with viral illnesses, Reye's syndrome continues to be a significant problem. 103 Erroneous diagnosis of Reye's syndrome was not uncommon when presumptive criteria were used to establish the diagnosis. Several inherited metabolic disorders present with signs and symptoms that are indistinguishable from Reye's syndrome (see below). When the charts of 49 patients originally diagnosed with Reye's syndrome were blindly reviewed, only one case was felt to be truly due to Reye's syndrome. 104 In UK, 12.7% patients that were originally reported with Reye's syndrome between 1981 and 1998 were subsequently diagnosed with an inherited metabolic disorder. 98 Because Reye's syndrome is now very rare, it has been suggested that any infant or children suspected of having this disorder should undergo investigation to exclude the presence of inborn metabolic disorders that can mimic Reye's syndrome. 96 ",

Ultrastructural study has shown that mitochondria within the hepatocytes of children with Reye's syndrome are swollen and irregularly shaped with expansion of the matrix space. 106 These changes also regress in parallel with clinical improvement. An excellent review of metabolic abnormalities seen in Reye's syndrome and other inherited disorders was published in 1994. 107 Hyperammonemia may result from a decrease in the activity of enzymes involved in the urea cycle, carbamyl phosphate synthetase and ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), due to damage to hepatic mitochondria. Both of these enzymes are normally found predominantly within the mitochondria; however, in patients with Reye's syndrome, OTC activity is shifted to the cytosol, presumably due to damage to the mitochondrial membrane. 108 The decreased levels of enzyme activity are transient and correlate with the clinical status of the patient. 109 Increase in nitrogen load due to muscle breakdown has also been reported in patients with Reye's syndrome and contributes to the profound hyperammonemia present in this disorder. 107 The metabolism of fatty acids is also impaired in patients with Reye's syndrome. Numerous intermediate metabolites are abnormally elevated in the liver, plasma, or urine of these patients and high levels of these compounds are believed to inhibit further mitochondrial enzymes involved in ureagenesis, gluconeogenesis, and fatty acid oxidation. 107 Salicylates may inhibit mitochondrial enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation, which may explain the association between these drugs and the development of Reye's syndrome. 107 Furthermore, in mice, infection with influenza virus potentiated the inhibitory effects of salicylates on mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation. 110 Some of the deleterious effects of salicylates on mitochondrial structure and function may be cytokine-mediated; pretreatment with a-interferon ameliorated salicylate-induced damage to isolated rat liver mitochondria. 111 ",

Several inborn metabolic disorders often present with signs and symptoms that are indistinguishable from Reye's syndrome. [115] [116] [117] The most common metabolic disorder mimicking Reye's syndrome is medium-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency. 117 The majority of these inherited disorders are specific enzymatic defects that usually become evident before the age of 3 years. These disorders are characterized by recurrent episodes, the presence of similar disorder in the siblings, frequent hypoglycemia, cardiac enlargement, and muscle weakness. The most consistent distinguishing features of Reye's syndrome on electron microscopy are ultrastructural changes in liver tissue, specifically the proliferation of smooth endoplasmic reticulum and peroxisomes, and the presence of enlarged and pleomorphic mitochondria with loss of dense granules. [116] [117] [118] In enzymatic defects with Reye's manifestations, in contrast, the mitochondria are normal in size and appearance.",

High-concentration glucose solutions are required to maintain adequate serum glucose levels. With neurologic deterioration, consideration should be given to intracranial pressure monitoring in order to guide the effects of various interventions, such as hyperventilation and mannitol infusions, that may be used to decrease intracranial pressure. In the report from the CDC that described the outcomes of 1207 cases of Reye's syndrome reported to NRSSS, the overall case fatality rate was 31.3%. 96 The level of consciousness at the time of admission was a strong predictor of death; the mortality rate increased from 17.8% in stage 0 (alert and wakeful) to 89.6% in stage 5 patients (unarousable, areflexia, and fixed pupils) (Table 56-6).

In a recent study that reviewed the records of 365 patients with renal cell carcinoma, 21% had paraneoplastic elevation of alkaline phosphatase. Hepatic and bone metastases were excluded by computed tomography scans and bone scans. 123 Recent evidence suggests that interleukin-6 (IL-6) is responsible for causing various paraneoplastic syndromes seen in renal cell carcinoma.

Hepatomegaly was present in twothirds of patients. Elevation of alkaline phosphatase was the most common biochemical abnormality, occurring in 90% of reported cases, while abnormalities of serum aminotransferases and serum bilirubin were much less common.

Steatosis, mild focal hepatocyte necrosis, portal lymphocytic infiltration, and Kupffer cell hyperplasia have all been reported. 120, 129, 130 The importance of recognizing this syndrome lies in the decision concerning resection of the tumor and differentiating these benign liver enzyme abnormalities from metastatic disease.

While most individuals cleave amyloid A into small peptides, some patients can only cleave it into larger sizes consistent with the amyloid subunit. Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autosomal recessive disorder associated with recurrent episodes of fever, arthritis, serositis, and skin rash. It is predominantly seen in non-Ashkenazi Jewish, and Turkish people. These patients develop renal disease and ultimately renal failure, which can be prevented with colchicine administration. Recently a genetic defect has been located on the short arm of chromosome 16 in patients with FMF. 136, 137 The defect occurs in a gene coding for a protein known as pyrin/marenostrin. It is unclear how this gene product interacts with the serum A protein to produce amyloidosis.",

The protein is a tetramer of identical subunits that is encoded by a single gene on chromosome 18. At least 78 different amino acid substitutions occurring at 51 different sites in the transthyretin gene have been reported. 138 Most of these mutations are amyloidogenic.

If that is negative, rectal or skin biopsies are obtained, and finally biopsies of affected organs as needed. Amyloid deposition in the liver occurs in three basic patterns. The most common pattern is protein deposition in the spaces of Disse (Figure 56-9 ). As the material accumulates, it encroaches on the hepatocytes, causing extensive atrophy. Amyloid increases the mass of the liver, producing hepatomegaly, but only rarely compromises sinusoidal blood flow, leading to portal hypertension. Another pattern is deposition of amyloid only in the walls of hepatic arterioles and the third pattern is globular clusters of amyloid, again in the space of Disse. The latter pattern appears to be most uncommon. The Congo red stain is the mainstay of diagnosis. 138, 151 While commonly used as a diagnostic test, the Congo red stain can be difficult to perform correctly. The characteristic staining is highly dependent on the pH, salt concentration, and thickness of the material stained. Any variation in the above parameters can greatly affect the quality of staining. The Congo red staining is relatively specific for amyloid when properly performed; however, under some conditions, one can also see staining of fibrin, elastin, and collagen. However, these are usually not birefringent under polarized light. The staining properties with Congo red are related to the betapleated sheet arrangement of the proteins. Generally, all types of amyloid stain with the Congo red dye. However, in some patients with AL amyloid, it may be very difficult to obtain a satisfactory staining reaction. In these cases, it may be useful to attempt other stains, such as Thioflavin T and S, crystal violet, and methyl violet. Electron microscopy has been a gold standard for detection of amyloidosis. Ultrastructural examination shows non-branching fibrillar structures of indefinite length with a width of approximately 9.5 nm.",

These abnormalities may be present during the asymptomatic phase of sickle-cell disease as well as during the episodes of sickle crisis. The incidence of hepatic involvement is very difficult to estimate due to the confounding effects of chronic hemolysis that may elevate serum bilirubin and aminotransferase activity. Of 100 consecutive patients seen as outpatients or inpatients at a university hospital, 24% had one or more chronic abnormalities of liver tests. 167 The vast majority of the abnormalities were due to concurrent illnesses ranging from chronic viral hepatitis to congestive heart failure. 155 Similarly, in another series, serum alkaline phosphatase was abnormal in 64% of patients with sickle-cell disease, although it appears that the alkaline phosphatase was mostly of bone origin. 168 Thus, the true incidence of hepatic involvement is greatly dependent upon the criteria used to define liver disease in this population.",

This constellation of findings is also suggestive of acute cholecystitis or cholangitis and differentiating these entities may be difficult. It has been estimated that 7-10% of hospitalizations for sickle-cell anemia were complicated by hepatic crises. 169, 170 The most marked serum biochemical abnormality during hepatic crisis is elevation in serum bilirubin. Total bilirubin is usually less than 15 mg/dl, although extreme levels of hyperbilirubinemia, greater than 50 mg/dl, may occur. This marked hyperbilirubinemia may not necessarily be associated with a worse prognosis. [171] [172] [173] A large component of this bilirubin is the direct fraction, which may be as much as 50% of the total bilirubin in many cases. Serum aminotransferases are abnormal, with levels usually less than 10 times the upper limits of normal. Elevation of serum LDH activity, disproportionate to the increase of serum aminotransferases, is also common and reflects the ongoing hemolysis associated with sickle crisis. 168 Evidence of extrahepatic sickle crisis, such as joint and flank pain, is usually, but not invariably, present. With general supportive care, clinical improvement is seen within several days, although hyperbilirubinemia may persist for several weeks. Deaths related to fulminant hepatic failure in the absence of other identifiable etiologies have been reported. 168 Recent data suggest that acute hepatopathy due to sickle-cell anemia should be considered a contraindication to percutaneous liver biopsy. 174 Out of 14 patients with sickle-cell disease who had percutaneous liver biopsy, 5 (36%) had serious hemorrhage and 4 of them died due to bleeding complications. All of those who had bleeding complications had acute sickling crisis at the time of their liver biopsy.",

A diagnosis of hepatic involvement in Hodgkin's disease requires the finding of the Reed-Sternberg cell ( Figure 56-11) . Non-specific inflammatory infiltrates are seen in 50% of liver biopsies in patients with Hodgkin's disease and, alone, do not constitute grounds for diagnosing hepatic involvement. Noncaseating epithelioid granulomas may be seen in 25% of patients with Hodgkin's disease. 188, 189 Granulomas may be seen in the portal tract and the hepatic lobules and do not necessarily indicate hepatic involvement by Hodgkin's disease. Elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase levels is the most frequently abnormal liver test found in patients with Hodgkin's disease. In a review of 111 inpatients with Hodgkin's disease, 41% had abnormal serum alkaline phosphatase levels. 190 Patients with more advanced stages of Hodgkin's disease were more likely to have elevations of this enzyme; 14% of patients with stage I or II disease and 65% and 81% of patients with stage III or stage IV disease, respectively, had abnormal serum alkaline phosphatase levels. The elevations were generally mild -1.5-2 times the upper limits of normal -although more marked increases were noted in patients with stage IV disease. The liver was felt to be the source of the alkaline phosphatase in the majority of patients, although several patients, adolescents with potential for bone growth, had elevation in the bone fraction. 190 Abnormalities in alkaline phosphatase were seen in several patients in the absence of hepatic involvement, more commonly in patients with fever as a systemic manifestation of Hodgkin's disease. Thus, in some patients abnormal serum alkaline phosphatase could represent the equivalent of an acute-phase response.",

Epithelioid granulomas may also be seen in the liver of these patients. Immunophenotyping using monoclonal antibodies may be performed on snap-frozen liver biopsy tissues in order to characterize the infiltrates. 202 Rarely, primary hepatic lymphoma in the absence of systemic lymphoma has been reported. 203, 204 The clinical manifestations of hepatic infiltration with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are similar to that seen with Hodgkin's disease. Patients may remain asymptomatic despite extensive hepatic infiltration. Mild to moderate elevations in serum alkaline phosphatase and moderate to marked elevations of LDH activities may be present. In contrast to Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphomas are more likely to produce jaundice as a result of extrahepatic obstruction, usually at the porta hepatis, rather than by direct hepatic infiltration. 187 Reactivation of chronic hepatitis B in patients receiving cytotoxic therapy is well documented. 205, 206 Recent data suggest that lamivudine can prevent such reactivation of hepatitis B in patients receiving chemotherapy. 207 While some reports have suggested that HCV may have a role in the development of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, 208, 209 other reports have failed to confirm such an association. 210, 211 Patients with lymphoma with severe liver dysfunction (due to either lymphoma involvement or coexisting liver problem) pose a significant therapeutic problem due to their inability to tolerate conventional chemotherapeutic agents.

The patients generally present with hepatomegaly or ascites. 213 It is important to distinguish myeloma liver involvement with myeloma from autoimmune hepatitis. In myeloma, the plasma cell infiltrate predominantly involves the sinusoids, with relative sparing of the portal tracts. This is distinct from autoimmune hepatitis, where the infiltrate is predominantly in the portal area. Another pattern of liver injury in myeloma patients is nodular regenerative hyperplasia. 214 Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia is a neoplastic disorder of Blymphocytes and plasma cells that has been alluded to previously. 215 The neoplastic cells secrete immunoglobulin heavy chain, which has rarely been associated with the development of amyloidosis. The lymphoplasmacytic tumor can directly involve the liver. Clinical liver disease in these patients is often mild, with minimal elevation of transaminases and alkaline phosphatase. Their symptoms are usually referred to the extrahepatic problems associated with the disease. Histologically, the infiltrate shows expanded portal tracts with lymphocytes and plasma cells, and larger atypical cells with occasional mitotic figures.",

However, the disease can become systemic and involve the liver, especially in adult patients. 216 When seen in adults, it often presents with fever, hepatosplenomegaly, steatorrhea or diarrhea, and weight loss. The liver chemistries are usually minimally abnormal; radiologic studies are often not contributory. A liver biopsy demonstrates the characteristic lesions that are similar to those seen in other organs, including spleen and lymph nodes. This lesion is characterized by irregular areas of fibrosis containing numerous eosinophils and a background of lymphocytes and other mononuclear cells (Figure 56-13) . 217 These mononuclear cells are mast cells that may be recognized by a number of methods. Because the cells are often degranulated, toluidine blue staining may not be helpful. Chloroacetate esterase staining, however, is usually diagnostic; the cells also exhibit c-kit (CD-117). These fibrotic clusters may be located either in the portal tracts or in the parenchyma. When the lesions abut the central veins, they may be responsible for the rare cases of portal hypertension associated with the disease. 218,219",

Studies have confirmed that a novel corona virus called SARS corona virus (SCoV) is the etiologic agent. Liver test abnormalities are seen in up to 50-60% of patients who were hospitalized with SARS, and the most common liver test abnormality is mild elevation in serum transaminases. [220] [221] [222] [223] Transaminase levels peak during the second week of illness and their levels improve with successful recovery. 223 This phenomenon of mildly elevated transaminases is likely a nonspecific response to severe systemic illness with hypoxemia and possibly related to multiple medications. Occasionally, transaminase levels may be significantly elevated with peak ALT values ranging between 500 and 1000 IU/l. 224 Chau and colleagues described the liver histology in 3 patients with SARS who had markedly elevated transaminases with no evidence of organ failure. 224 All three biopsies had hepatocyte apoptosis and in 2 patients there were marked accumulation of cells in mitosis (Figure 56-14) . Liver biopsies also exhibited balloon degeneration of the hepatocytes and mild to moderate lymphocytic infiltration. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was positive for SCoV in liver tissue from all 3 patients, suggesting that this pattern of liver injury may indeed represent a form of SARS-associated viral hepatitis. 225 ",
