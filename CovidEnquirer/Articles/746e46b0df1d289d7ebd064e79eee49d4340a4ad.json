The results showed that the HRV-C genome had diverged from that of HRV-A and -B. Despite its late identification, increasing evidence suggests that HRV-C causes more severe pathogenic infections than HRV-A or -B; however, a large amount of epidemiological data is required to confirm this association in different clinical settings. Consequently, a simple and rapid method for identifying HRV-C is required to expedite such epidemiological studies. Here, two degenerate primer sets (HEV and HRVC) were designed based on bioinformatic analyses. The HEV set targeting the fifth IRES domain sequence within the 5 -UTR, which is highly conserved among enteroviruses, was designed to detect all enteroviruses, whereas the HRVC set, which targeted the VP2 coding region, was designed to detect HRV-C alone. Both primer sets were tested against a panel of standard enteroviruses and clinical lavage samples. HEV detected all enteroviruses tested whereas HRVC was specific for HRV-C. Although the primer design strategy was confirmed with a limited number of samples, extensive tests are required to be applied in clinical settings.",

Along with advances in automatic nucleotide sequencing technology, RT-PCR speeds up the identification of unculturable viruses. Consequently, molecular typing has become an essential tool for viral taxonomical studies. Since the introduction of molecular typing, increasing evidence suggests that some unculturable rhinoviruses have genomic sequences that are divergent from those of HRV-A or HRV-B. Recently, HRV-C was identified based on molecular typing studies (Ledford et al., 2004; Lau et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2007; McIntyre et al., 2013a Viruses had since revised the classification of HRV based on molecular typing results (Adams et al., 2013) . Currently, 51 subtypes of HRV-C have been classified based on their genomic sequences.",

The HEV genome contains a single open reading frame (ORF) that encodes a polyprotein. Host and viral proteases cleave the polyprotein into four capsid structural proteins (VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4) and seven non-structural proteins (2A, 2B, 2C, 3A, 3B, 3C, and 3D). The ORF is sandwiched between the 5 and 3 untranslated regions (UTR), which are critical for translation and replication of the viral genome. HEV evolution is driven by the selection of quasispecies under certain environmental pressures. Quasispecies represent a pool of genetically diverse progeny that originate from mutations driven by two factors: rapid virus replication and an error-prone viral RNA polymerase. Although the error-prone viral RNA polymerase generates multiple random mutations, not all viral sub-genomic regions are affected equally. The ORF can tolerate silent or non-critical amino acid mutations; however, the UTRs are greatly affected by mutations because a single nucleotide change can destroy the tertiary structure and function of the RNA. As a consequence, capsid structural proteins are highly variable, the non-structural viral proteins are less variable, and the UTRs are the least variable.",

The need for a simple method of identifying HRV-C Despite delayed identification due to culture difficulties, studies suggest that HRV-C may cause more severe respiratory diseases than HRV-A or -B (McErlean et al., 2007; Miller et al., 2009; Bizzintino et al., 2011; Denlinger et al., 2011) . HRV-C also shows seasonal patterns that are different from those of HRV-A or HRV-B, suggesting a different pathophysiology (Savolainen-Kopra et al., 2009; Kaida et al., 2011; Miller et al., 2011) . However, this association is inconclusive because there is insufficient epidemiological data. Also, a previous report suggests that the identification of HRV-C in patients affected by lower respiratory illnesses during the winter months would require a change of treatment modality (Linder et al., 2013) . Therefore, a simple, efficient, and rapid method of identifying HRV-C is required to identify HRV-C in various clinical settings; such a method would complement the rather laborious and time consuming method of molecular typing. Therefore, the aim of this study was to design degenerate primer sets that enable the specific identification of HRV-C by RT-PCR.",

To amplify HRV-C specifically, the primers must target conserved species-specific sequences. The conservation of HRV-C-specific sequences must satisfy certain conditions. They must be conserved within HRV-C but show different levels of conservation in HRV-A or -B (sequences showing either no conservation or complete conservation among all three species will be non-specific). In addition, targeting conserved sequences in HRV-C alone will not guarantee specificity because other species may harbor the same sequences by chance. All rhinovirus subtype sequences were downloaded from the NCBI Genbank database (Supplementary Table) . Next, multiple sequence alignments (MSA) were performed for each species using Clustal Omega (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/) to identify conserved amino acids within the VP4/VP2 region. The amino acid sequences of HRV-A, -B, -and -C were aligned and sequence logos generated using Weblogo 3 (http://weblogo.threeplusone.com). The amino terminal (N-term) region of VP2 was selected for a HRV-C-specific identification (Fig. 1a) based on the following observations: amino acid (aa) nine was Y, Y, and F/Y; aa 13 was I, V, and L; aa 14 was I, Q/E, and K; aa 13 was I, V, and L; aa 18 was R, L, and I; aa 25 was S, T, and T; aa 27 was D, E, and D; aa 31 was A, A, and T; aa 32 was V, Y, and Y; aa 34 was G/A, A/C, and A; aa 36 was G, A, and G; and aa 37 was V, E, and E in HRV-A, HRV-B, and HRV-C, respectively. The position of the selected region within the HRV capsid complex was then checked. The capsid structure of HRV14 (PID: 4HRV) was displayed in PyMol (ver. 1.3; http://www.pymol.org/). The target amino acids formed a secondary structure comprising extended beta-sheet and loop regions, and were located on the inner side of VP2 in close contact with VP3 (Fig. 1b) .",

The corresponding coding sequences within HRV-A, -B, -and -C were then aligned and conservation logos generated to design the HRVC primers. The MSA results were compared and the following nucleotides selected as specific targets for the HRVC sense primer: the first and second codons for the 10th Ser, the third codon for the 12th Arg, the first codon for the 13th Leu, and the first and second codons for the 14th Lys. The following nucleotides were selected for the antisense primer: the second codon for the 34th Ala, the second codon for the 37th Glu, and the second codon for the 41st Tyr. Importantly, the \"AA\" at the 3 end of the sense primer and the \"GC\" at the 3 end of the antisense primer are critical for HRV-C-specific amplification (Fig. 3b) . The HEV set was designed to supplement the HRVC set and targeted nucleotides 469-585 within the 5 -UTR.

However, the Ct values for HRVC were about 10 cycles higher than those for HEV at the same concentrations, reflecting the higher degeneracy of the HRVC set. The primer concentration in a conventional PCR reaction has little effect on the reaction; however, the primer concentration is critical when using a highly degenerate primer. Therefore, the HRV-C51 standard was amplified at primer concentrations ranging from 20 to 500 pmoles. The Ct values for the HEV set were similar at different concentrations. However, the Ct values for the HRVC set decreased as the primer concentration increased (Fig. 4b ).

Therefore, the HEV primer set was designed to target the fifth IRES domain within the 5 -UTR and detected all enteroviruses tested. This region is frequently selected for the PCR detection of enteroviruses (McLeish et al., 2012) . Mutations have much less effect on the capsid-encoding sequences because mutations can be either silent or occur in the non-structurally critical loop regions of the capsid proteins. Thus, the HRVC primer set was designed to target the N-terminus of the VP2 protein and specifically amplified HRV-C (Fig. 3a) . The HEV primer set is supplementary to the HRVC set and is more sensitive due to its low degeneracy. Four possible combinations of results can be obtained when both primer sets are used together to test clinical samples: HEV-positive/HRVC-positive, HEV-positive/HRVC-negative, HEV-negative/HRVC-positive, and HEV-negative/HRVC-negative. The first combination provides strong evidence of HRV-C infection (see Table 1 : L6 and L8). HEV-negative/HRVC-positive indicates a false-positive result and HEV-positive/HRVC-negative indicates an infection by other enteroviruses such as HRV-A or HRV-B (see Table 1 : L1-5, L7, and L9-10). The last combination indicates no HEV infection.",

            "text": "Several factors were considered when designing the degenerate primers: 3 -end specificity, melting temperature, minimum degeneracy, and short amplicon size. The specificity of the primer is dependent on the 3 -end sequence, and the final specificity of the PCR is determined by the combined specificity of two primers. The primer must also have a suitable melting temperature. High degeneracy reduces the sensitivity of the PCR. A short amplicon reduces the chance of non-specific binding of degenerate primers during the annealing step. Specificity and degeneracy are the most critical factors. The reverse-codon method is conventionally used for degenerate primer design; however, we found that this strategy led to an unnecessary increase in degeneracy. For example, the first and second codons for the 10th Ser were T and C in HRV-A and HRV-C, but A and G in HRV-B (Fig. 3b) . Therefore, our MSA-based design strategy is preferable to the reverse-codon-based method because it avoids unnecessary degeneracy. The HRVC primer set (designed using the MSA approach) had 1.5 \u00d7 10 6 -fold degeneracy (288 of sense and 5184 for antisense primers); however, the set would have 2.7 \u00d7 10 9 -fold degeneracy (82,944 for sense and 32,768 for antisense primers) if designed using the reverse-codon method.",

However the low sensitivity can be overcome partially by increasing the concentration of the degenerate primer. Theoretically, if the degeneracy increases by 10-fold, the matching primer concentration decreases by 10-fold. However, this inverse correlation is not linear because primer binding can tolerate some mismatches. There is no accepted method of calculating the acceptable degree of mismatch at the desired melting temperature. Therefore, experimental \"tuning\" of the concentration is required before using degenerate PCR primers in a specific clinical setting.",

In addition, the average melting temperature of the probe might be about 10 \u2022 C higher than that of the primers. Thus, probe-based methods are not currently applicable to the detection of specific virus subgroups by degenerative primers. The disadvantage of SYBR green II-based methods is the false-positive signal generated by primer dimer formation or non-specific reaction. This \"noise\" signal can be minimized by reading the fluorescent signal at a temperature higher than the melting temperature of the non-specific amplicon. In our case, the signal was read at 80 \u2022 C because the melting temperature of the specific target amplicon was about 80 \u2022 C.",
