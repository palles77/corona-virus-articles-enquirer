The venoms of many different species are rich sources of biologically active components and various therapeutic agents have been characterized including antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Due to their potent activity, low resistance rates and unique mode of action, AMPs have recently received much attention. This review focuses on AMPs from the venoms of scorpions and examines all classes of AMPs found to date. It gives details of their biological activities with reference to peptide structure. The review examines the mechanism of action of AMPs and with this information, suggests possible mechanisms of action of less well characterised peptides. Finally, the review examines current and future trends of scorpion AMP research, by discussing recent successes obtained through proteomic and transcriptomic approaches.",

            "text": "Over the last few decades an increasing number of pathogenic microorganisms have developed resistance to conventional antibiotics. This poses problems in the clinical management of infections, especially in immunocompromised individuals but also increasingly, at the community level. During the same period, more worryingly, the development of new antibiotics has decreased. Selective pressures caused by the overuse of conventional antibiotics in the healthcare setting, as well as unprecedented increases both in global transport systems and migration has led to a situation of previously isolated forms of resistance being widespread. The ability of mobile genetic elements of bacterial plasmids to spread through a population is increasing the rate of resistance (Kumarasamy et al., 2010) . While the media portrayal of an imminent crisis of untreatable infections is misguided, the position in reality is rather more complex. Although treatment options for some pathogens have undoubtedly decreased, for others the position has actually reversed (Livermore et al., 2009) . A major problem in modern antibiotic drug development is designing agents that are not easily susceptible to resistance and therefore a new approach to drug development is required (Jenssen et al., 2006) .",

The report highlighted that no novel classes of antimicrobial agents has been developed since the 1980's and with no compounds in clinical trials, the threat of untreatable infection in the near future is feasible.",

            "text": "Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) represent an ancient defence mechanism that transverses the evolutionary spectrum and remains an effective strategy against invading pathogens. Because of their selectivity for prokaryotic membranes and their membrane-disruptive mechanisms for which microbes have little natural resistance, the spotlight in recent years has turned towards the development of novel antibiotics from these peptides (Zasloff, 2002) . Previous attempts to develop AMPs into the clinical setting have proven frustrating, with a number of peptides being rejected during the latter stages of clinical trials (Gordon et al., 2005) . However a recent commentary (Fox, 2013) examined these failures and provided optimism for future AMP development; in this light, a number of these previous attempts are discussed below. For example, pexiganan (Lamb and Wiseman, 1998), a 22 residue peptide developed for the treatment of foot ulcers was stopped because of manufacturing difficulties and changes in the clinical trial design, leading to a non-approval letter been issued (1999) due to deficiencies with US Chemistry Manufacturing & Controls. The United States Federal Drug Administration (FDA) also indicated that pexiganan was no more effective in treating foot ulcers than conventional antibiotics. Similarly plectasin (NZ2114) (Mygind et al., 2005) developed by Novozymes for the treatment of Gram positive infections and licenced (2008) to Sanofi-Aventis was abandoned because of commercial rather than scientific reasons. In another example, omiganan (Sader et al., 2004) , which had good efficacy in inhibiting catheter associated infections, was rejected on the grounds of cost when it was demonstrated to show no clinical statistical difference when compared to the widely used povidone iodine.",

However recent acceptance of the lipopeptide, Daptomycin (2003) and the vancomycin derived Telavancin (2007) , which have relatively low therapeutic indices compared with conventional b-lactams, would suggest a possible change in regulation.

Scorpion venom AMPs are positively charged amphipathic peptides and can be conveniently divided into three structural categories: (1) cysteine containing peptides with disulfide bridges; (2) peptides with an amphipathic a-helix but lacking cysteine residues and (3) peptides rich in certain amino acids such as proline and glycine. This review aims to provide an examination of AMPs from scorpion venom (Table 1; Fig. 1 ), with discussions on structure, biological activity and proposed mechanisms of action, together with a final discussion of recent and future strategies for mining new bioactive molecules.",

            "text": "Studies on two antimicrobial peptides isolated from Pandinus imperator have shed further light on the contribution of the two a-helical regions discussed above, to biological function. Pandinin 1 (Pin1) has two a-helical regions between residues 3e18 and 20e39, separated by a random coil region containing a Pro-19 kink. In contrast, NMR analysis of pandinin 2 (Pin2) in a 60% TFE solvent containing DPC micelles, showed that this second peptide had a singular helical structure between residues 2e18 with no significant kink at the equivalent proline residue (Pro-14) (Nomura et al., 2005) . The structural differences found between these two peptides are significant. While the antimicrobial activity of Pin 1and Pin 2 against a range of Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms was broadly similar, it is the haemolytic studies on eukaryotic membranes that are of most interest. Pin2 lysed 51% of sheep erythrocytes at 22 mM whilst Pin1 only lysed 1.4% at the same concentration . The authors suggest that the ability of Pin 2 to lyse both eukaryotic and prokaryotic membranes may be related more to the venom toxicity, in a similar manner to the bee venom peptide melittin, than a specific antimicrobial action. In contrast, the activity of Pin1 is more in keeping with magainin1, the prototype AMP isolated from the skin of the South American toad, Xenopus. A flexible hinge region is also important in successful AMP design. Replacing (structurally rigid) Pro-14 in Pin2 with a (flexible) GVG tripeptide reduces the haemolytic activity of Pin2 without altering its antimicrobial activity . This substitution creates a more flexible region while retaining the essential amphipathic nature of Pin 2 which is more in tune with the dual helical structure of Corzo, Nakajima and colleagues have subsequently demonstrated that the haemolytic activity of Pin1, Pin2 and other cationic amphipathic peptides (e.g. IsCt1, see Section 3.3) depends on the animal species studied (guinea pig > pig > sheep) and this is turn is related to the phosphatidylcholine:sphingomyelin ratio in the different erythrocyte membranes (Belokoneva et al., 2003) .",

            "text": "With such contrasting effects on prokaryotic and eukaryotic membranes, a comparison of the mechanisms of action of these two peptides is of particular interest and it is instructive to consider these mechanisms in greater detail. On examination of the effects of Pin2 on phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipid vesicles using a calcian dye release assay, it was seen that the dose response curve for dye efflux was sigmoidal, suggesting peptide oligomerisation during the time course of the experiment. The effects of Pin2 were seen at very low peptide: phospholipid concentrations (Belokoneva et al., 2004) . When phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), known to promote negative membrane curvature (Matsuzaki et al., 1998) , was incorporated into the PC vesicles, no change in Pin2 activity was observed, supporting the hypothesis of a barrel-stave mechanism of pore formation (see Fig. 2 for a background explanation to current hypotheses for the mechanism of action of AMPs). Dextranloaded liposome assays also showed great variability in the size (1.8e5 nm) of the membrane pores generated by Pin2, dependent on peptide: phospholipid ratios (Belokoneva et al., 2004) . Based on NMR studies of Pin2, Nomura and colleagues (Nomura et al., 2005) proposed a pore forming mechanism of action, as a consequence of Pin2 inducing clustering of hydrophobic residues which allows further incursion into the membrane hydrophobic core and interaction with the inner membrane. This process can be conveniently visualized in a step-wise fashion as shown in Fig. 3 . Pin2 inserts into the membrane at a 45 angle however is seen to be only at a 25 angle around the Leu 12 residue. This causes a slight kink in the peptide when in the membrane, and is a phenomena seen in other pore forming AMPs, thus thought to be essential for activity. After insertion, oligomerisation occurs between the Pin2 monomers and then pore oligomerisation is seen leading to membrane being trapped between these pores to be 'pinched off'. Thus Pin2 induces a 2 fold attack on the target with loss of intracellular constituents through the pore lumen and loss of membrane through pore association.",

CD spectral analysis of synthetic meucin-24 (2.8 kDa, 24 amino acids) showed a disordered conformation in water; however a-helical formation increased in 50% TFE and NMR spectra revealed an a-helical structure between residues 4e20 and random coil regions at the N-and C-terminals (Gao et al., 2010) .

The mechanism of action of AMP's is postulated to occur in a number of stages (Zasloff, 2002) : (1) Electrostatic interaction onto the membrane surface; (2) a peptide threshold concentration is reached before membrane disruption can occur after which a number of models have been proposed. In the Carpet model (Pouny and Shai, 1992) , peptides remain parallel to the bilayer causing a detergent like effect. In the Barrel stave pore model peptides insert perpendicularly into the bilayer and self-association occurs forming a pore containing peptideepeptide interactions (Baumann and Mueller, 1974) . The more recent Toroidal model (Ludtke et al., 1996) indicates a pore forming mechanism in which the pore lumen is lined with both peptides and phospholipid in a less rigid association. Fig. 4 . Interaction of Pandinin 1 interaction with phospholipid head groups. Pin1 sits between the head groups (A) within the interface between the head groups and HC core (B). Interactions between pin1 1e18 (green) and the head groups causes negative membrane curvature (A) as pin1 1e18 is at a 30 tilt with respect to pin1 20e44 (red) due to the presence of a proline at position 19. Membrane disruption accrues when pin1 1e18 rotates around the average helical axis, which is parallel to the lipid long axis (C) causing membrane disruption and dispersion of the lipid into the cubic phase (D). (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) meucin-24 can be considered amphipathic, the hydrophobic face of the molecule contains only six residues; this reduction in hydrophobicity has been postulated to be responsible for the lack of antibacterial activity (Gao et al., 2010) . The charged residues in this amphipathic molecule are unusually, predominantly anionic and therefore not thought to interact with negatively charged membrane phospholipids. The authors provide an excellent structural comparison to the classical AMP, magainin 2, which has a larger hydrophobic face and a predominantly cationic hydrophilic domain (Fig. 5) .",

CD spectra and helical wheel predictions of both peptides revealed an a-helical organisation in membrane-mimicking environments (40 and 70% TFE) which adopted a classical amphipathic structure. A sequence comparison (Fig. 6 ) between the two peptides shows differences at Phe-2 (Leu), Ala-4 (Lys) and Asn-7 (Gln) (IsCT2 residues in brackets). Helical wheel analysis demonstrates that these differences cause changes within the hydrophilic face of IsCT2, although there is no overall change in charge; this suggests that both overall ionic charge and amphipathic nature, as distinct from specific amino acid residues, are critical for AMP function. Mutation studies on IsCT (Lee et al., 2004) showed the importance of the hydrophobic residue at position 6. Substitution of Trp6 for Ala6 resulted in a remarkable decrease in both antimicrobial and haemolytic activities. Dai and colleagues (Dai et al., 2002) also identified two other peptides in the crude venom, analogous to IsCT and IsCT2 (IsCTf and IsCT2f, respectively). These latter two peptides are thought to be proteolytic products of the parent molecules devoid of the two penultimate amino acids (Leu and Phe-NH 2 ). IsCTf and IsCT2f have no antimicrobial activity and have no a-helical structure as evidenced by CD spectral analysis, implicating these two C-terminal residues as critical for function.",

BmKb1 has a 52 amino acid pre-pro sequence containing a 22 amino acid signal sequence, which after post translational modification gives an 18 amino acid mature peptide. In comparison, BmKn2 has a 47 amino acid pre-pro sequence containing a 23 amino acid signal sequence, finally resulting in a 13 amino acid mature peptide. Secondary structure predictions suggest that both BmKb1 and BmKn2 have ahelical regions (amino acids 2e16 and 2e11 respectively) flanked by two random coils; helical wheel projections demonstrate their amphipathic natures. The shorter and more highly charged BmKn2 is considerably more active than BmKb1 (MICs for Gram-positive organisms were typically 0.4e6 mM for BmKn2 as compared with 9e45 mM for BmKb1; MICs for Gram-negative organisms were typically 1e15 mM for BmKn2, as compared with 10e50 mM for BmKb1). The activity of BmKn2 against 18 strains of multidrug resistant N.gonorrhoeae has recently been analysed via an MTT assay with these strains having an MIC 50 value of between 6.9 and 27.6 mM (Arpornsuwan et al., In Press).

The Asian scorpion, Scorpiops tibetanus is one such example and Cao, Li and colleagues (Yuan et al., 2010) have cloned a new antimicrobial peptide gene (StCT1) from S. tibetanus by screening a venom gland cDNA library with IsCT primers. The precursor of StCT1 is characterized by a signal peptide (24 amino acids) followed by a putative mature peptide of 14 residues and finally, an unusual 37amino acid acidic propeptide at the C-terminus, suggesting that the mature peptide is C-terminally amidated. A synthetic amidated peptide corresponding to the putative mature peptide of StCT1 showed preferential activity towards S. aureus with weak activity towards Gramnegative organisms, in a similar manner to mucroporin and imcroporin. MIC values against methicillin-resistant S. aureus strains ranged between 85 and 135 mM whilst penicillin-resistant strains were more sensitive (MIC 34 mM). It is interesting to note that although the amidated StC1 peptide has approx 40% homology with IsCT, the latter peptide (in contrast to StC1) has activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms.Using the same approach, a StCT2 gene has also been cloned . A synthetic, amidated 14 amino acid StCT2 peptide, corresponding to the predicted mature peptide, also showed potent activity against S. aureus and methicillin resistant S. aureus (MICs values 3e13 mM). Both StCT1 and StC2 peptides belong to the NDBP -5 family (see Table 1 ).",

Whole cell patch clamp experiments identified a sharp decrease in ion currents followed by a rapid, partial recovery, when rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells were exposed to either peptide. These electrophysiological experiments were supported by morphological studies, when the surface of DRG cells was transformed from a smooth to a rough state after incubation with peptides. Evidence for the peptides causing membrane permeabilization in microbial cells (bacteria, yeast and fungi) was obtained with the fluorescent DNAbinding dye, propidium iodide. Taken together, these studies suggest that meucins cause permanent cell damage. Gao et al. (2009) have then gone on to try and rationalize their biological data in terms of structural differences between meucin-13 and meucin-18. Both peptides belong to group 5 (Table 1) . Meucin-13 has an amidated Cterminal in contrast to meucin-18 which does not. Extensive structural studies have been carried out on both peptides using CD spectroscopy and NMR spectrometry. The CD spectrum of meucin-13 in 50% TFE characterized the peptide as being primarily a-helical. This was confirmed by NMR, which identified an a-helical structure between residues 5e13 with an unordered N-terminus. Meucin-18 showed similar results to meucin-13, although NMR revealed a more ordered N-terminal structure (Fig. 7) . This is thought to be due to the presence of alanine at position 6 (meucin-13) instead of phenylalanine (meucin-18). A structurally ordered N-terminus is postulated to be important for biological activity. Gao and colleagues have also suggested that differences in biological potency might be related to differences in the hydrophilic/ hydrophobic balance between the two meucins due to the more balanced amphipathicity of meucin-18. The C-terminal extension of meucin-18 with a free (charged) carboxy terminus means that overall, meucin-13 is more hydrophobic. This relative increase in hydrophobicity may reduce the biological activity of the latter due to its increased self-association in aqueous solution (see Jiang et al., 2008 for a useful summary of this proposal). Gao and colleagues also noted that meucin-18 has a positivelycharged region (adjacent Lys-6 and Lys-11 residues) that could prove crucial for increased interaction with negatively-charged prokaryotic membranes.",

Ctriporin is a 19 amino acid peptide (net charge: \u00fe2) with, like many other previously described peptides, an amidated C-terminus that is produced by the post translational cleavage of a 34-residue acidic propeptide. Secondary structure analysis and CD spectra of the peptide in 30 and 70% TFE revealed an amphipathic a-helical structure. However, the ambiguity still remains as to whether the peptide is completely a-helical or contains a random coil region, due to the presence of Gly-4, Gly-7 and Pro-8, residues known to disrupt a-helical structures. MIC values (Gram-positive organisms) ranged from 3 to 5 mM whereas Gram-negative organisms had MICs >49 mM). All clinical isolates of MRSA strains gave MIC values of 5 mM (c.f. vancomycin 3e6 mM). Similarly the penicillin-resistant strain of S. epidermidis had an MIC of 5 mM, analogous to vancomycin.

All three were predicted to be mature peptides of 13e14 amino acid residues with precursor peptides indicating the nowcharacteristic C-terminal post-translational processing, resulting in C-terminal amidation. Peptides were cationic and secondary structure prediction suggested that pantinins are a-helical, amphipathic structures. Amino acid sequence homology revealed that these peptides belong to the ever-growing 5th family of NDBPs. Pantinins are relatively potent against Gram-positive bacteria (MICs 4e48 mM), including vancomycin-and methicillin-resistant bacteria but are much weaker against Gram-negative bacteria (MICs 36e >87 mM). In addition to their antimicrobial activities, the three peptides showed haemolytic activity on human RBCs in a dose-dependent manner.",

This idea (Zhu and Tytgat, 2004) is supported by the alignment (Fig. 8 ) of cecropin A with the N-terminal regions of 3 other scorpine family peptides (heteroscorpine, panscorpine and opistoscorpine-1). These regions also align well with the two helices of cecropin A determined by NMR (Holak et al., 1988) . Mechanistic studies of cysteine constrained peptides such as the scorpines are limited, compared with that of their non-cysteine containing counterparts.

Since the long chain peptides identified in Fig. 9 also have two distinct alpha helices, then it is a likely proposition that these other peptides also promote a cubic phase in lipid bilayers. Taken together, these alignments may provide us with an insight sight into a general mechanism of action of this class of AMP; however studies comparable to that of Pin 1 clearly need to be undertaken before any firm conclusions can be made. Although these long peptides undoubtedly cause membrane disruption, it is very unlikely that they do so by forming pores, simply on the basis of their size.

However it is well documented that C-terminal amidation increases the biological activity of these short chain cationic peptides and it has been proposed that this is a consequence of an increase in net positive charge (Strandberg et al., 2007) . If the helical wheel structures of these peptides are examined (Fig. 10) , it can be clearly seen that amidation of the negatively charged C-terminal carboxy group lies within the hydrophobic section of the peptide, thus changing the charge distribution of the peptide. However, the slightly longer peptides (e.g imcroporin, mucroporin, ctriporin and BmKb1) have C-terminal amidated residues that lie within the hydrophilic face of the peptide thus changes in charge distribution are less pronounced (Fig. 11 ). This 'rebalancing' of charge between the amphipathic facets of the peptide clearly has implications for biological activity and it poses an interesting question as to what the precise role of this amidation site has on scorpion AMP mechanism of action.",

A LIPS motif found within Pin 2 (Leu-12 to Ser-15), thought important for biological activity, is also found in all four peptides with the exception of a Ser/Ala replacement in Ctriporin (Fig. 12C) . Finally, another interesting separate alignment of Pin 2 and meucin-18 revealed the same motif as part of a conserved K(L/I)IPSLF sequence (Fig. 12 D) .

These techniques have also been extensively used to analyse the venoms of various scorpions (Abdel-Rahman et al., 2014) . Recent studies have highlighted the abundance of AMP-like molecules within the transcriptomes of numerous scorpion venoms. 25% of all expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from transcripts of the venom gland of Tityus Stigmurus, were related to AMPs (Almeida et al., 2012) . Similar results were obtained from an analysis of the venom gland glands of the Egyptian scorpion Scorpio maurus palmatus (Abdel-Rahman et al., 2013) and the Chinese scorpion, Lychas mucronatus (Ruiming et al., 2010) . In this latter study, scorpions were collected from two different and geographically-isolated areas (Yunnan province and Hainan Island) and the data revealed that the relative abundance of ESTs corresponding to AMPs from scorpions collected on Hainan Island (24% total EST population) were double that of scorpions found in Yunnan. This phenomenon has been highlighted previously in mass spectrometry studies where geographical distribution, climate, age and sex have all been integral to the determination of venom components of a number of different scorpion species (e.g. Newton et al., 2007; Abdel-Rahman et al., 2009; Ma et al., 2009) .",

Although no studies have been directed toward decreasing the immunogenicity of AMPs in particular, various general strategies have been examined and could provide useful areas for further AMP research. For example PEGaylation is an approved nontoxic and non-immunogenic procedure by interfering with antibody and/or HLA epitope binding (Jevsevar et al., 2010) . Similarly peptide glycosylation also results in decreased immunogenicity through a similar mechanism (von Delwig et al., 2006) . PEGaylation has also been shown to increase the stability of AMPs in the presence of proteases (Falciani et al., 2014) as well as decrease toxicity and increase biocompatibility (Morris et al., 2012) . Conjugation of peptides to IgG has also been carried out to successfully evade the adult immune system (Zambidas and Scott 1996) and is a strategy employed within clinical practise for the delivery of anti-inflammatory drugs. Finally modification of a peptide sequence to delete potential T-cell epitopes have also been examined (De Groot 2007) . Therefore while a number of different strategies are available to improve stability and reduce immunogenicity, it is important to emphasize that the central goal of any strategy should be to maintain beneficial biological activity.",

The increased use of proteomic and transcriptomic approaches has already begun to prove fruitful, with a massive acceleration of peptides discovered by these approaches in the last few years. A rhetorical and thought-provoking question was asked during the 1st Oxford world symposium on venoms (September 2012) e what approach is to be taken within future years regarding venom compound research? Are we gatherers or hunters? (Calvete, 2012) .",

            "text": "The use of venom transcripts, mass spectrometry and bioinformatics tools leads to the question whether this combined approach is now regarded as paradigm of choice for identifying low abundance, and (perhaps?) more potent, antimicrobial peptides? In terms of both speed and scope of peptide identification through MS/MS techniques and the establishment of dedicated databases of fragmentation patterns, to the prediction of biological activity via bioinformatics, it is certainly an approach to be given serious consideration. However when one considers the many hundreds (over a thousand?) of antimicrobial peptides characterised in the last twenty years, the lack of any really new therapeutic anti-microbial agents is singularly depressing. We must therefore recognize that the approach of the \"gatherers\", presently in vogue, has one crucial intellectual limitation-you only get what you are looking for and is in essence a recipe for identifying more of the same. The alternative approach of the \"hunter\" may be more time consuming but one can argue that an investment in functional assays is the only way to identify truly novel compounds. One particular striking example of this is the identification of the bactridines (Diaz et al., 2009 ) whose proposed mechanism of action is far removed from membrane active AMPs, indeed would not be considered a conventional target in other streams of antibiotic development. Such serendipitous breakthroughs should be a lesson to us all.",

Techniques such as NMR (Nomura et al., 2004 (Nomura et al., , 2005 , atomic force microscopy (AFM) (Garcia-Sa ez, 2007; Fernandez et al., 2012; Lam et al., 2012) , secondary ionisation mass spectrometry (SIMS) (Rakowska et al., 2013 ) and X-ray photoemission electron microscopy (Won et al., 2011) can enable us to re-examine and refine our present interpretations of models of peptide interaction with microbial membranes (Bobone et al., 2012; Marks et al., 2011) . Such experimental methods, taken together with molecular techniques to determine potential intracellular targets (e.g. Brogden, 2005) and not forgetting that AMPs also have antiviral activities (e.g. Zhao et al., 2012) , are crucial if our ultimate goal of using antimicrobial peptides as next generation therapeutics is to be realised.",

Hge027, Hge028, Ocy1 and Ocy2 all have homology to IsCT peptides, whereas Hge029 and Smp43 have homology to Pin-1 and Ocy3 as well as Smp24 have homology to pandinin-2. Pcav30 and Pcav7 are similar to Pin-2, IsCT and BmKn2. A large number of other putative NDBPs have been identified in Heterometrus petersii (HSP013C, with homology to opistoporins, HSP028C and HSP049C with homology to Pin-2, as well as six peptides homologous to IsCT",
