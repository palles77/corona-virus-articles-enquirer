Consequently, the mechanisms and factors involved in their replication have been difficult to study. In an attempt to analyze the cis-and trans-acting factors that could have a role in NV replication, the 3 0 -untranslated region of the genome was studied. Use of Zuker's mfold-2 software predicted that NV 3 0 UTR contains a stem-loop structure of 47 nts. Proteins from HeLa cell extracts, such as La and PTB, form stable complexes with this region. The addition of a poly(A) tail (24 nts) to the 3 0 UTR permits the specific binding of the poly(A) binding protein (PABP) present in HeLa cell extracts, as well as the recombinant PABP. Since La, PTB, and PABP are important trans-acting factors required for viral translation and replication, these RNA-protein interactions may play a role in NV replication or translation.",

Noroviruses are difficult to study because they cannot be cultivated in cell culture; however, molecular techniques have been useful to examine the genome organization and function of the viral proteins. NV has a single stranded positive-polarity RNA genome that contains three open reading frames (ORF), a short 3 0 untranslated region (UTR) of 66 nts, and a poly(A) tail [4] . The presence of a 5 0 UTR has not been established. Sequence analysis of ORF 1 shows the characteristic motifs of the 2C helicase, 3C cystein protease, and 3D RNA polymerase present in the picornavirus genome [4, 5] .

Two main complexes, with similar migration patterns to the ones observed with the 3 0 UTR, were detected (Fig. 3A, lanes 3 and 2, respectively) . The complexes formed with both RNAs could be different since the poly(A) tail is a target for the binding of cellular proteins; however, RNP complexes were treated with RNAses, thus neither the poly(A) tail nor the complex formed with it, which were not labeled with [a-32 P]UTP, can be detected by autoradiography. To visualize the complexes formed with the poly(A) tail, [a-32 P]ATP was used to label both 3 0 RNAs. Under these conditions, we could detect differences in the complex (lane 1) or with 5, 10, 15, and 20 lg of S10 extract from HeLa cells (lanes 2-5, respectively). (B) [a-32 P]UTP labeled 3 0 UTR was incubated without (lane 1) or with 5, 10, 15, and 20 lg of HeLa S10 extract (lanes 2-5, respectively) followed by RNase treatment.

(D) [a-32 P]UTP labeled 3 0 UTR RNA was incubated without (lane 1) or with 20 lg of S10 extract from HeLa cells (2) (3) (4) (5) in the absence (lane 2) or presence of 10-and 20-fold molar excess of homologous (lanes 3 and 4, respectively) or 20-fold molar excess of non-related heterologous competitor (lane 5). Complex formation was assayed by electrophoresis on native polyacrylamide gels and detected by autoradiography. Mobility of complexes I and II is indicated. formation with both RNAs. The 3 0 UTR and the 3 0 UTR(A) were able to form five complexes (Fig. 3B , lanes 3 and 2, respectively); complexes I, III, and V formed with the 3 0 UTR(A) had a similar migration pattern to complexes II, III, and V formed with the 3 0 UTR, respectively (Fig. 3B, lanes 2 and 3, respectively) . However, complex II formed with the 3 0 UTR(A), which together with complex V are the most prominent complexes formed with this RNA, did not correspond to any complex formed with the 3 0 UTR. Complexes III and IV were not consistently discernible in subsequent experiments. Complexes formed with the 3 0 UTR were overexposed with respect to those formed with the 3 0 UTR(A). These results suggest that the poly(A) tail may influence the formation of the RNAprotein complexes either because it changes the size and conformation of the RNA and/or because it interacts with some other proteins present in the S10 HeLa cell extract.",

The absence of complex II in the presence of the anti-PABP antibodies demonstrated that PABP was present in complex II. To corroborate that PABP was able to bind to the 3 0 UTR(A) tail, a mobility shift assay with rPABP was performed (Fig. 4C) . Two complexes with different migrations were observed when rPABP bound to the [a-32 P]ATP labeled 3 0 UTR(A) (Fig. 4C, lane 3) , but none of them were formed with [a-32 P]ATP labeled 3 0 UTR (Fig. 4C, lane 2) , indicating that the rPABP was able to specifically bind to the poly(A) tail. It has been reported that PABP can bind to the PV 3 0 UTR with a poly(A) tail containing a minimum of eight nts and that its affinity increases as the poly(A) tail lengthens [12] . The poly(A) tail present in the 3 0 UTR(A) is 24 nt long, therefore more than one PABP molecule can bind to this sequence. The two complexes observed after the RNAse could contain different defined amounts of rPABP. The expression and purification of the rPABP is described by Herold and Andino [12] .",

Ten proteins from HeLa cell extract, with apparent molecular masses of 110, 97, 85, 75, 68, 60, 52, 50, 39, and 33 kDa, bound to both RNAs (Fig. 5A, lanes 2 and 3, respectively) . All the bands observed in this assay were disrupted after proteinase K treatment (data not shown). It was not possible to detect any differences in the proteins crosslinked to both RNAs; however, a higher amount of radioactivity was observed in the 68 kDa protein crosslinked to the 3 0 UTR(A) (7%), compared to the same band crosslinked to the 3 0 UTR RNA. The increased amount of radioactivity in the 68-kDa band, could correspond to the PABP that binds to the poly(A) tail. To examine this possibility, a 50-fold molar excess of the homologous and the heterologous RNAs was used. A strong competition of all the proteins was observed with both RNAs (Fig. 5B, lanes 4 and 3,  respectively) ; however, the 68-kDa protein competed only with the homologous unlabeled RNA (Fig. 5B, lane  4) . These results suggest that the presence of the poly(A) tail was responsible for the competition of an extra band of 68-kDa, which co-migrates with the 68 kDa band bound to the [a-32 P] ATP labeled 3 0 UTR(A) RNA. The molecular mass of this protein co-relates with the PABP molecular mass. No competition was observed when the non-related heterologous RNA was used (Fig. 5B, lane 5) .",

The identification of these cis-and trans-elements, considered molecules that have essential roles in translation and replication of other positive-sense RNA viruses, can help understand the specific mechanisms that take place in NV replication.",
