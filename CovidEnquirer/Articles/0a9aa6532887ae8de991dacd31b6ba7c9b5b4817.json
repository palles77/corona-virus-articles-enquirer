This paper examines China's FOI Regulations and argues that China has adopted a push model of FOI legislation that emphasizes proactive disclosure of government information. This differs from a pull model that stresses citizen-initiated access or reactive disclosure. The push model of FOI legislation, which has reduced the importance of access requests in China, grew out of its local causes. However, the degree of push or proactive disclosure under China's current FOI Regulations is undermined by several factors, including a limited access mechanism, broad and vague exemptions, and the omission of the maximum disclosure principle. This paper has five sections. Section one compares a pull model with a push model of FOI legislation. Section two explores a unique proactive disclosure system. Section three examines a limited access mechanism that constrains the proactive disclosure degree under the FOI Regulations. Section four explores broad and vague exemptions that further limit the push degree under the Regulations. The final section examines the omission of the maximum disclosure principle, which further undermines the proactive disclosure degree under the FOI Regulations.",

Information flow, with the assistance of information technology, has become easier and more frequent. FOI academics, such as Snell (2008, November 4) , call for a shift from \"version 1.0\" FOI focusing on reactive disclosure to \"version 2.0\" emphasizing proactive disclosure. Government agencies have also become more receptive to information sharing in order to adapt to an improved information environment. The US revised its FOI legislation in 1996 to accommodate to the information age, changing its strong pull version to include more proactive disclosure requirements (Tankersley, 1998; Gellman, 2004) . The Obama administration has taken significant measures, such as releasing FOI Act Memorandum and Transparent and Open Government Memorandum, in order to improve the role of proactive disclosure in implementing FOI legislation. The UK FOI law provides for a publication scheme, which requires government agencies to provide information to the public routinely and proactively. In Mexico, government agencies are required to publish an extensive amount of information on their Web sites. More importantly, Australia is taking the lead in promoting a push model to become policy, especially at the sub-national level. ",

Democratic election, decision making, management, and supervision have been recognized as four major means of developing China's socialist democracy since 1997. The four democratic means, the last three in particular, laid the foundation for extension of OGA to all levels of government. The political report of the 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 1997 first recognized the need for the exercise of democratic decision making, management, and supervision to be assisted by openness (Jiang, 1997) .",

This has prompted the Chinese government to become more transparent and proactive in dealing with crises. Furthermore, rising threats to society by rumors in the improved information environment have forced the Chinese government to abandon its old information management approach (Li, 2008) .

These unique features have required that less emphasis be placed on access requests in order to allow government agencies to exercise their core functions.

The Law on the Protection of State Secrets 1988 has not yet been revised, and the scope of state secrets remains unchanged. The longstanding culture of secrecy, although beginning to change, has impeded efforts to narrow the scope of state secrets. The definition of privacy is not \"yet addressed comprehensively in Chinese law\" (Horsley, 2007; Zheng, 2007) , which in turn may negatively affect the operation of the FOI Regulations. Although trade secrets are defined in Article 10 of the Anti-trust Law 1993, it is uncertain whether or not this definition will be widened to include information in government procurements and other contracts to which the government is a party.",

This theory was written into the Party Constitution of the Communist Party of China and the preface of the Constitution in 1999. It appears that \"secrecy still enjoys priority during the process of information disclosure\" (Chen, 2008) . Thus, a special principle is found under Article 8 of the FOI Regulations, which prohibits government agencies from disclosing government information that may prejudice state security, public security, economic security, or social stability. Article 8 is also considered by law reformers as a basic principle for guiding government agencies to disclose information (Yang, 2007) .

Furthermore, the proactive disclosure requirements under the FOI Regulations provide a clear obligation and minimum standard for government agencies to follow, and thus improve the likelihood of government compliance. However, the degree of proactive disclosure under China's FOI legislation has been constrained by a limited access mechanism, broad and poorly defined exemptions, and the omission of the maximum disclosure principle.
