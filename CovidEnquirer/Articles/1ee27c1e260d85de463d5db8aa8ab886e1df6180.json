In contrast, during the baseline period (January 1, 2014 through February 28, 2014), there was no difference between UpToDate MERS searches in Jeddah compared with those in the composite of the control cities (P = .936). Likewise, during the outbreak period in 2014, UpToDate MERS searches in Riyadh showed a correlation to the reported MERS cases; the correlation coefficient was 0.651 (P < .00001) (Figure 2A ). UpToDate MERS searches in Riyadh during the outbreak period were significantly higher than those in the composite of the 4 control cities (P < .0001) ( Figure 2B ). In contrast, during the baseline period (January 1, 2014 through February 28, 2014), there was no difference between UpToDate MERS searches in Riyadh compared with the composite of the 4 control cities (P = .904). During the outbreak in 2015 in Riyadh, UpToDate MERS searches in Riyadh also showed a correlation to the reported MERS cases (Figure 3) ; the correlation coefficient was 0.860 (P < .0001).",
