The addition excess amino acids during viral infection reduced BKPyV infection. Perturbing autophagy levels using inhibitors, 3-MA, bafilomycin A1, and spautin-1, also reduced infection, while rapamycin treatment of host cells increased infection. siRNA knockdown of autophagy genes, ATG7 and Beclin-1, corresponded to a decrease in BKPyV infection. BKPyV infection not only correlated with autophagosome formation, but also virus particles localized to autophagy-specific compartments early in infection. These data support a novel role for autophagy in the promotion of BKPyV infection.",

Early in autophagy a fold of membrane, known as the isolation membrane, curves around cytoplasmic cargo destined for degradation. The ends of the isolation membrane join together to form a double membranous vesicle. This new structure, known as an autophagosome, fuses with the lysosome forming the autolysosome, which is rich in hydrolases that act to enzymatically catabolize the vesicular contents (Juhasz and Neufeld, 2006) . By isolating and then directing organelles and large biomolecules toward the lysosome, autophagy enables the cell to break down and redistribute molecules to pathways that are more critical for cell survival.",

In humans BKPyV is the causative agent of polyomavirus associated nephropathy, a viral complication that affects approximately 5-10% of kidney transplant recipients (Drachenberg et al., 2007; Schaub et al., 2010) . As BKPyV is an intracellular pathogen, its life cycle is intimately connected with its host cell. Previous studies have shown the BKPyV requires vesicular acidification during the infectious process, but the virus does not seem to use the canonical endosome-lysosome pathway (Eash and Atwood, 2005; Eash et al., 2004; Jiang et al., 2009) . In this study, we explored the importance of autophagy in BKPyV infection. ",

Sodium hydroxide was added to amino acidsupplemented media so that media had identical pH levels. Increasing the concentration of amino acids led to a decrease in BKPyV infection in host cells indicating that higher levels of amino acids hinder BKPyV infectivity. Addition of amino acids did not lead to a change in Vero cell death or proliferation (Fig. 1B) . One hypothesis is that cells treated with amino acids have lower autophagy levels, as nutrient deprivation is a major activator of cellular autophagy. To evaluate the level of autophagy in amino acid supplemented cells, a plasmid encoding microtubuleassociated protein light chain 3 fused to green fluorescent protein (LC3-GFP) was transfected into cells. LC3 is distributed in a diffuse pattern throughout the cytoplasm in the presence of low levels of autophagy (LC3-I), and acquires a distinct punctate distribution during autophagy (LC3-II) (Mizushima, 2004; Kabeya et al., 2000) . LC3-GFP transfected cells were treated with 100 nM rapamycin, a drug known to activate autophagy, in media with different concentrations of amino acids. 24 h later the number of LC3-GFP \u00fe punctae per cell was scored for 80 cells. Addition of amino acids led to a decrease in the number of LC3-GFP \u00fepunctae per cell suggesting that amino acid supplementation suppressed autophagy (Fig. 1C) .",

            "text": "To determine whether autophagy is important in BKPyV infection, host cells were treated with pharmacological agents that affect autophagy levels, infected with BKPyV, and stained for VP1 72 h post infection. Rapamycin is a drug that inactivates the protein mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a kinase that promotes cell growth and protein synthesis. Rapamycin also elevates autophagy levels Noda and Ohsumi, 1998) . Vero cells treated with 100 nM rapamycin showed elevated BKPyV infection levels compared to DMSO-treated cells indicating that inhibition of mTOR elevates infection ( Fig. 2A and F ). 3-MA is an inhibitor of autophagy that blocks phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activation, an event that is necessary for membrane trafficking during autophagy (Blommaart et al., 1997; Petiot et al., 2000) . Cells treated with 3-MA showed a dose-dependent decrease in infection ( Fig. 2B and F) suggesting that autophagy promotes BKPyV infection. Rapamycin was able to restore infection to 3-MA-treated Vero cells (Fig. 2C ). Another autophagy inhibitor, spautin-1, degrades class III PI3K by inhibiting the activity of the ubiquitin specific peptidases, USP10 and USP13 (Mateo et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2011) . Spautin-1 also reduced BKPyV infection in a dose-dependent manner ( Fig. 2D and F). Vero cells treated with bafilomycin A1, a vacuolar H \u00fe ATPase inhibitor that blocks lysosomal acidification that is necessary for both autophagic degradation and endosome maturation, were also less susceptible to BKPyV infection suggesting that vesicular acidification is important for BKPyV infection ( Fig. 2E and F) (Tanigaki et al., 2003) . Taken together these data suggest that autophagy may be important in BKPyV infection. A trypan blue exclusion assay verified that the pharmacological agents used in this study no statistically significant difference in cytotoxicity compared to no drug control (Supplemental Fig. 1 ). BKPyV-infected HeLa cells, which are permissive to BKPyV and have similar infection kinetics to Vero cells, showed nearly identical infection levels after drug treatments (Supplemental Fig. 2 ). When VP1 staining was compared in untreated cells infected with BKPyV for 3 h versus 72 h, VP1 nuclear staining was only observed in the 72 h condition with BKPyV in EMEM media with 5% fetal bovine serum with and without additional essential amino acids. EMEM without additional supplementation is labeled 0 \u00c2 . After infection, the cells were replaced with EMEM media with 5% fetal bovine serum with or without the addition of amino acids and left for duration of infection. Cells were fixed at 72 h post infection using paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with Triton X-100. Infection was determined by using an antibody (PAB597) specific to the viral protein VP1 and then scoring the number of VP1\u00fe cells using indirect immunofluorescence. (B) Cell death was evaluated 24 h following amino acid supplementation by scoring the number of cells excluding trypan blue and graphing the percentage of cells that excluded the trypan blue dye. To measure cell proliferation a MTS assay was used. Vero cells in 96 well plate were incubated with amino acids for 24 h after which 20 \u03bcl of CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solution Reagent -MTS (Promega) reagent was added directly to cells and media for 2 h, and absorbance was measure at 450 nm. The absorbance of 0 \u00c2 was used as a control for cell viability. (C) Vero cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing LC3-GFP and incubated for 24 h. Cells were treated with different concentrations of amino acid for 24 h in the presence of 100 nM rapamycin. LC3-GFP distribution was observed using immunofluorescence. The average number of LC3-GFP \u00fe punctae per cell for 80 cells was scored. Each graph represents the average of three or more experiments. Error bars on bar graphs represent the SEM. nn p-value o 0.02. with a plasmid expressing LC3-GFP and incubated for 24 h. Cells were treated with media alone (no drug), serum free media for 3 h, 100 nM rapamycin for 24 h, 5 uM spautin-1 for 24 h, 5 mM 3-MA for 3 h, DMSO for 24 h and fixed then with paraformaldehyde. LC3-GFP distribution was observed using immunofluorescence. A representative image of an LC3-GFP \u00fe expressing cell after treatment shows the change in LC3 localization (magnification 1000 \u00c2). The number in the top right corner is the average number of punctae scored for 80 cells. (H) The average number of LC3-GFP \u00fe punctae per cell for 80 cells was scored. The treatments were as follows: 100 nM rapamycin, DMSO, and 5 uM spautin-1 for 24 h, and serum free media and 5 mM 3-MA for 3 h. Graphs represent data from three or more experiments.

BKPyV was significantly inhibited by the addition of 3-MA, spautin-1 and bafilomycin A1 during the first 8 h of infection suggesting that autophagy is important early in the BKPyV infectious process (Fig. 3) .

Interestingly, LC3 siRNA treatment did not decrease BKPyV infection (Fig. 4B) , suggesting that greater knockdown of the autophagic LC3-II form is required to effectively inhibit BKPyV (Fig. 4A ).

Of the 60 cells that were analyzed, 27% (n \u00bc16) of cells showed viral particles had penetrated the cell membrane and entered the host cell. Analysis of the infected cells revealed that 38% of these cells (6/16 cells) showed strong colocalization of BKPyV and LC3-GFP \u00fe in small or large autophagosomes. This differed from the 0% of cells (0/16 cells) that showed BKPyV colocalized with the diffusely expressed, nonautophagic LC3-GFP \u00fe. Our data suggest that BKPyV is more likely to colocalize with LC3-GFP \u00fe when it is found in an autophagosome. This colocalization of BKPyV with the LC3-GFP \u00fe autophagosomes was observed at 3 h post infection, indicating that the virus associates with an autophagic vesicle at a time point consistent with endocytic trafficking (Fig. 5A-D) .",

After establishing that BKPyV localized to LC3-GFP autophagosome ( Fig. 5A and B) , we next examined if the cellular location of BKPyV correlated with autophagosome formation. LC3-GFP expressing Vero cells were challenged with BKPyV-633 and then location of BKPyV-633 and type of LC3-GFP pattern recorded. In Vero cells that showed no internalized BKPyV-633, LC3-GFP was found to be primarily diffuse or in small punctae (Fig. 5E, left) . In cells infected with BKPyV, as determined by the presence of intracellular BKPyV-633, LC3-GFP localization changed and it localized to small punctae and larger autophagosomes (Fig. 5E , middle and right). Cells that showed colocalization of BKV-AF633 and LC3-GFP were scored for the pattern of LC3-GFP distribution.

Autophagy may have evolved as an antimicrobial defense process because its degradative function within the cell eliminates some invading microbes. For example, autophagy is believed to control and degrade both Sindbis virus and herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) (Liang et al., 1998; Talloczy et al., 2006) . HSV-1 is equipped with a viral protein called ICP34.5, which inactivates autophagy. HSV-1 mutants missing ICP34.5 show greater autophagic degradation and an attenuated neurovirulence phenotype in mice (Talloczy et al., 2006; Orvedahl et al., 2007) . Autophagy has also been shown to stimulate the innate immune system and link it to the adaptive immune system. Autophagy can promote antigen processing and presentation on major histocompatibility (MHC) molecules (Dengjel et al., 2005) . Autophagosomes have been reported to help transport microbial cargo towards the lysosome where toll like receptor (TLR) engagement leads to Type I interferon production and other innate immune responses (Lee et al., 2007) . Moreover, surface TLR engagement and signaling can activate autophagy (Xu et al., 2007) . Mutations and deletions in autophagy genes are also associated with intestinal inflammation, disrupted Paneth cell secretion, and altered gut microflora (Virgin and Levine, 2009) .",

Autophagy orchestrates the trafficking of vesicles to new locations within the cell thereby providing new membranous structures for viral replication to occur. Autophagy proteins have also been shown to aid in the translation of Hepatitis C virus proteins as well as viral replication (Sir et al., 2012; Dreux et al., 2009) . Some DNA viruses also utilize autophagy. For example, adenovirus and the E7 protein of human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) induce autophagy, which researchers hypothesize stimulates host cell death resulting in greater release of viral progeny (Zhou and Munger, 2009; Rodriguez-Rocha et al., 2011) .",

            "text": "Recently, autophagy has been demonstrated to occur in human JC polyomavirus infected cells. JC polyomavirus T-antigen (T-Ag) was found to suppress expression of a host autophagy gene called Bag3. Overexpression of Bag3 in host cells, results in elevated autophagy levels and decreases JC infection. These data suggest that autophagy acts as an anti-viral process in JC polyomavirus infection (Sariyer et al., 2012) . In contrast, elevation of host autophagy occurs when cells were made to express small t-antigen of simian virus 40 (SV40), a polyomavirus family member related to BKPyV (Kumar and Rangarajan, 2009 ). The small t antigen seems to help the cells to survive and respond to low nutrient conditions by stimulating host AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). When AMPK is activated it inactivates mTOR and thus increases the amount of autophagy occurring within the cell. These steps are thought to block premature host cell death during the viral life cycle, a state that would maximize viral production (Kumar and Rangarajan, 2009 ). Whether polyomavirus large and small t-antigen have opposing roles in controlling autophagy or if autophagy influences individual polyomaviruses members differently has yet to be determined.",

Pharmacological Cells were then infected with BKPyV-AF633 at 37 1C for 3 h, fixed and mounted onto slides using DAPI mounting media. Cells were analyzed for appearance of LC3-positive autophagosomes (green) and infection of labeled BKPyV (red) use a Zeiss 710 confocal microscope and Zen imaging software. Images analyzed using ImageJ image analysis software.

(E) LC3-GFP transfected cells were scored for the pattern of LC3-GFP distribution (n\u00bc 60, left). BKPyV-633 infected/LC3-GFP transfected cells were scored for LC3-GFP distribution (n\u00bc60, middle). BKPyV-633 infected that showed colocalization with LC3-GFO were scored for pattern of LC3-GFP distribution (n\u00bc 60, right). autophagy inhibitors, high amino acid concentrations, and knockdown of autophagy genes reduced BKPyV infection, while rapamycin treatment led to an increase in BKPyV infection. BKPyV is sensitive to autophagy inhibitors during the first 8 h of infection, a time period consistent with viral entry and intracellular trafficking (Eash and Atwood, 2005; Eash et al., 2004; Jiang et al., 2009 ). Interestingly we did note that addition of autophagy inhibitors from 24 to 48 h post infection increases BKPyV infection of Vero cells (Fig. 3) . We also observed a similar increase in infection levels when autophagy inhibitors were added 16-24 h following infection (data not shown). From 16 to 48 h post infection, T-Ag transcription and protein production, viral replication, and V-Ag protein production occur in this sequential order (Jiang et al., 2009) . Therefore it is possible that at this time frame, autophagy acts has an antiviral mechanism by degrading newly translated viral proteins. Addition of autophagy inhibitors midway through the viral lifecycle may allow more viral protein synthesis and virion assembly to occur. Eukaryotic cells respond to stressful stimuli using autophagy and the unfolded protein response. Recent evidence suggests that Rab1 protein may have important roles in both pathways (Chua and Tang, 2013) . Therefore pharmacologically blocking autophagy between 16 h and 48 h post viral challenge may elevate BKPyV infection by reducing the unfolded protein response allowing translation to proceed despite ER-stress.",

            "text": "Some of the early steps in the BKPyV life cycle have been elucidated in recent years. BKPyV attaches to its host cell by binding to a disialic acid-containing b-series ganglioside receptor (GD3, GD2,GD1b, GT1b) (Neu et al., 2013; Low et al., 2006) . Upon caveolae-mediated endocytosis, BKPyV enters the cell and requires some acidification event in the first few hours following infection (Eash et al., 2004; Jiang et al., 2009) . Dynamic microtubules are thought to help shuttle viral particles to the ER where virus localizes at 8-12 h following adsorption (Jiang et al., 2009) . Within the ER, capsid disassembly occurs. BKPyV also utilizes the proteasome and ER-associated degradation pathway (ERAD) to help BKPyV exit from the ER and for viral DNA accumulate in the cytoplasm (Jiang et al., 2009; Bennett et al., 2013) . Nuclear transport of viral DNA then occurs. This is the first report indicating that autophagy plays a role in BKPyV infection of host cells. Our study indicates that BKPyV localizes to the autophagosome 3 h post infection and that autophagy aids in productive BKPyV invasion of host cells. While the exact reason for this BKPyV-autophagosome interaction has yet to be elucidated, there are many possible explanations. First, an autophagosome may facilitate trafficking the virus towards the ER for viral disassembly. Autophagosomes use microtubules to shuttle themselves towards the lysosome to and group together with other autophagosomes in perinuclear regions (Jahreiss et al., 2008; Mackeh et al., 2013; Bouzas-Rodriguez et al., 2012) . Drug studies show that microtubule assemble and disassembly is necessary for BKPyV infection (Eash and Atwood, 2005; Jiang et al., 2009) . Therefore BKPyV may utilize the coordinated interaction between the autophagosome and microtubules to be shuttle closer to the ER. BKPyV does not seem to use the canonical early to late endosomal pathway to reach the ER, so this alternative trafficking strategy is a possibility ( (Eash and Atwood, 2005; Eash et al., 2004; Jiang et al., 2009 ) personal communication with Mengxi Jiang and Michael J. Imperiale).",
