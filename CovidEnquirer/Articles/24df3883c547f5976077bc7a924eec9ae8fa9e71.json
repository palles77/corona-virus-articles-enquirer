            "text": "Uniquely among RNA viruses, replication of the $30-kb SARS-coronavirus genome is believed to involve two RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activities. The first is primer-dependent and associated with the 106-kDa non-structural protein 12 (nsp12), whereas the second is catalysed by the 22-kDa nsp8. This latter enzyme is capable of de novo initiation and has been proposed to operate as a primase. Interestingly, this protein has only been crystallized together with the 10-kDa nsp7, forming a hexadecameric, dsRNA-encircling ring structure [i.e. nsp(7+8), consisting of 8 copies of both nsps]. To better understand the implications of these structural characteristics for nsp8-driven RNA synthesis, we studied the prerequisites for the formation of the nsp(7+8) complex and its polymerase activity. We found that in particular the exposure of nsp8's natural N-terminal residue was paramount for both the protein's ability to associate with nsp7 and for boosting its RdRp activity. Moreover, this 'improved' recombinant nsp8 was capable of extending primed RNA templates, a property that had gone unnoticed thus far. The latter activity is, however, $20-fold weaker than that of the primer-dependent nsp12-RdRp at equal monomer concentrations. Finally, site-directed mutagenesis of conserved D/ExD/E motifs was employed to identify residues crucial for nsp(7+8) RdRp activity.",

Both CoV RdRps belong to the set of 16 non-structural proteins (nsps) that are produced through proteolytic processing of the pp1a and pp1ab replicase precursor polyproteins, which both derive from translation of the genomic RNA (7, 8) . For the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which emerged in 2003 and caused worldwide concern due to the $10% mortality rate associated with infection of humans (6, 9) , the two replicase subunits with RdRp activity have been studied in some detail. The first is the 106-kDa nsp12, which contains the canonical viral RdRp motifs in its C-terminal part and employs a primerdependent initiation mechanism (10, 11) . The second polymerase, the 22-kDa nsp8, is unique for CoVs and was reported to be only capable of de novo RNA synthesis with a low fidelity on ssRNA templates (12) . Together, these observations inspired a hypothesis in which nsp8 would serve as an RNA primase, i.e. would synthesise short oligonucleotide primers for subsequent extension by the nsp12 'main RdRp' (12) .",

In a similar fashion, it is presently unknown whether the postulated double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding channel of this complex plays a role in the RdRp activity of nsp8 and whether this activity is influenced by nsp7, particularly given the observed low fidelity and low processivity of nsp8 (12) .",

This technical refinement was found to greatly improve nsp8's ability to associate with nsp7. Moreover, and in contrast to previous observations (12) , exposure of the natural N-terminus proved crucial for the enzymatic activity of the complex on partially double-stranded RNA templates, demonstrating that nsp(7+8) is capable of primerdependent RdRp activity as well. Site-directed mutagenesis of nsp8 in the context of the nsp(7+8) complex identified a conserved D/ExD/E motif that is important for catalysis in vitro, possibly providing a first indication of the location of the presently unknown nsp8 active site.

The primers used were SAV704 and SAV429 (Supplementary Table S1 ). For nsp8 expression, the sequence encoding pp1a residues 3920 to 4117 was amplified by RT-PCR using SAV428 and SAV429 as primers (Supplementary Table S1 ). Both PCR products were digested with SacII and BamHI, and ligated into expression vector pASK3-Ub-CHis 6 (10). This vector was originally derived from the pET26-Ub-CHis 6 vector (14) , but drives expression of N-terminally ubiquitintagged and C-terminally His 6 -tagged fusion proteins via a tetracyclin-inducible promoter, to rule out the potential T7 polymerase contaminations that are known to cause false positive results when using T7 promoter-driven systems for recombinant RdRp expression. All described nsp8 mutants were engineered via site-directed mutagenesis according to the QuikChange protocol (Stratagene) using the primers listed in Supplementary Table S2. For nsp7-8 or nsp8 expression, Escherichia coli C2523 cells (New England Biolabs) were transformed with the plasmids pASK3-Ub-nsp7-8-CHis 6 or pASK3-Ub-nsp8-CHis 6 together with the Ubp1 protease expression plasmid pCG1 (14) . Routinely, 50 ml of Luria Broth, containing ampicillin (50 mg/ml) and chloramphenicol (34 mg/ml), was inoculated 1:1000 with o/n precultures, and cells were grown to OD 600 >0.8 at 37 C. Subsequently, the cells were slowly cooled to 20 C, followed by induction with anhydrotetracycline (Fluka) at a final concentration of 200 ng/ml for 16 h. Expression at 20 C was, however, only crucial for the preparation of certain nsp8 mutants and similar yields of active wild-type protein could be obtained by expression at 37 C for 3-4 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and stored at 20 C until protein purification was started.",

Based on the large diameter, positive charge of the hexadecamer's channel and in silico docking, it was proposed to be able to encircle dsRNA ( Figure 1B) . However, the functional significance of the compound interactions between nsp7 and nsp8 is poorly understood, as are the polymerase activities associated with monomeric nsp8 or nsp8-containing multimers. So far, strategies for the purification of recombinant nsp8 have involved the use of affinity tags [e.g. His 6 or glutathione-S-transferase (GST) (12, 13) ] that were fused to one terminus to facilitate protein recovery. Inadvertently though, such tags or other exogenous sequences may significantly impede the correct folding of enzymes and thus alter their stability or activity, as exemplified by studies of the poliovirus (3D pol ) and SARS-CoV (nsp12) RdRp subunits (10, 14, 18) . To circumvent this issue, we developed a protocol in which SARS-CoV nsp8 was expressed as a ubiquitin (ub) fusion protein carrying a C-terminal His 6 -tag (ub-nsp8-His), which was subsequently processed at both termini in two steps. The first step was co-translational and involved the release of the N-terminal ub fusion partner by the co-expressed ubiquitin carboxyl-terminal hydrolase 1 (Upb1, Figure 2A ) (10, 14) . The second proteolytic step, catalysed by a recombinant form of the SARS-CoV nsp5 main protease (15) , removed the C-terminal His 6 -tag and was performed either in solution (Figure 2A and B) or when nsp8-His was immobilised to Talon beads. This procedure yielded SARS-CoV nsp8 with its exact natural Nand C-terminus (replicase residues Ala-3920 and Gln-4117, respectively; Figure 2A ), the product that is normally liberated by the nsp5-driven autoprocessing of the SARS-CoV replicase polyproteins (19) .",

The structural support of the nsp8 , followed by purification and cleavage by recombinant SARS-CoV nsp5 main protease to remove the C-terminal His 6 -tag and its upstream GSSG linker. (B) Eighteen percent SDS-PAGE analysis of nsp5-treated, purified nsp8-His demonstrates near-complete release of the C-terminal His 6 -tag within 60 min. The maltose binding protein (MBP) was added to the reaction to serve as an independent loading control. Asterisks indicate non-specific bands. (C) In addition to the tag-less nps8 and nsp8-His, we also produced the N-terminally His 6 -tagged nsp8 (His-nsp8) used by Imbert et al. (12) . (D) Comparative gel filtration analysis of nsp8 (22 kDa as a monomer) versus His-nsp8 and (E) nsp8 versus nsp8-His. In all three cases, nsp8 formed multimers in solution, but the apparent molecular mass of complexes formed by both nsp8 and nsp8-His was $2-fold higher than for complexes formed by His-nsp8. (F) Comparative analysis of nsp8, nsp(7+8), His-nsp8 and nsp7+nsp8-His. Only nsp(7+8) showed a molecular weight shift to the $225-kDa size range with a standard deviation of 15-kDa (n = 3). This size is indicative of hexadecamer formation, whereas the analysis of nsp7+nsp8-His showed dominant peaks of nsp8-His and nsp7 (which is $10 kDa as a monomer). octamer by eight copies of nsp7 thus appears to be redundant, in line with the critical role for the nsp8 N-terminal domain described above. We surmised therefore that the additional complexity must have evolved to improve nsp8's function and set out to compare the RNA binding capabilities of the purified nsp8 octamer and nsp(7+8) hexadecamer.",

A comprehensive analysis of the influence of nsp7 on nsp8-dependent RNA binding required an nsp8 mutant that was incapable of RNA binding. To this end, we engineered an alanine substitution of the conserved residue K58, which resides in nsp8's proposed dsRNA-binding channel [residues 55-78 (13)]. As is evident from the electromobility shift assay in Figure 3B , this mutation was sufficient to significantly disrupt RNA binding. As a control, we also performed an aspartate-to-alanine substitution at position 52, which is partially conserved, yet not expected to participate in RNA backbone binding due to its negative charge and position just outside the proposed RNA binding channel. Indeed, the D52A mutation only induced a migratory shift of the dominant RNP signal towards the anode, likely as a result of the lost negative charge ( Figure 3C ).",

No RNA binding was observed in the absence of nsp8, but upon nsp(7+8) complex formation the amount of bound dsRNA rapidly increased ( Figure 3D ). Indicative of successful complex formation, we also observed a shift in the molecular weight of the major RNP complex formed ( Figure 3D ). Western blot analysis confirmed that both nsp7 and nsp8 were present at this position in the gel (not shown), but due to the generally unpredictable migration behaviour of proteins and RNPs in native PAGE, it was not possible to assess whether this band indeed corresponded to the nsp(7+8) hexadecamer.

We first tested the concentration required to saturate all nsp(7+8) complexes in the reaction by titrating 0-100 mM into the reaction (Supplementary Figure S2A) and observed that the incorporation levels were stable above 1 mM (Supplementary Figure S2B) , suggesting that these reactions represent single initiation-extension events. We next assessed whether the activity of nsp8 or nsp(7+8) was distributive or processive by quantifying the incorporated signal in full-length or longer products in the presence of 1 mM heparin ( Figure 4C ). As shown in Figure 4D , 66 \u00b1 4% (mean \u00b1 standard deviation) of the nsp8 products were full length compared to 61 \u00b1 2% of the nsp(7+8) products, suggesting that both the enzymes complexes are mostly processive and that nsp7 does not confer additional processivity to nsp8. Interestingly, both nsp8 and nsp(7+8) are able to extend the RNA primers beyond template length in the presence of heparin ( Figure 4D and Supplementary Figure S2B ), suggesting that these extensions result from terminal transferase activity and not from template switching, as was previously observed for poliovirus 3D pol (20) .",

We first tested RNA-binding mutant K58A (Figure 2 ) at varying concentrations and observed a $95% loss of nucleotide incorporation activity compared to the wild-type protein ( Figure 5 ). Other likely candidates for a direct role in RdRp catalysis generally are Mg 2+ -coordinating aspartate residues and lysine or histidine residues that can function as general acid (3). In canonical RNA polymerases, the aspartates commonly reside in motifs A and C (3, 21) , while in DNA-dependent RNA primases they are usually found in a central D/ExD/E motif (22) . Given the absence of classical RdRp A and C motifs in the nsp8 sequence (12), we screened an alignment of CoV nsp8 sequences for conserved D/ExD/E motifs. Interestingly, we found such a motif in both the N-terminal and the C-terminal domain ( Figure 5A ). Subsequent alanine substitution of the N-terminal D/ ExD/E motif, composed of D50 and D52 in SARS-CoV, greatly affected primer extension activity on the CU 10 template as shown in Figure 5C . Mutation of the downstream domain (residues D161 and D163 in SARS-CoV), however, had a much smaller effect on polymerase activity, suggesting that this C-terminal D/ExD/E motif is not critical for catalysis. Controls included mutant K58A and a mutant carrying a lysine-to-alanine substitution of the non-conserved residue 127. In line with the observation of the U 20 template and its conservation in CoVs, the loss of a lysine at position 58 resulted in a near complete loss of RdRp activity, whereas mutation of K127 positively influenced RNA synthesis ( Figure 5) .

To investigate whether this difference could be attributed to complex formation with nsp7 or the removal of the affinity tag, we performed the primer extension assay with three different recombinant nsp8 versions of which the gel filtration analysis is documented in Figure 2 . Interestingly, for all three variants primer-extension activity was observed ( Figure 7A ), but the activity was most pronounced for nsp8-His and the untagged nsp8 ( Figure 7A ). To estimate the effect of nsp7 on the nsp8-driven primer extension activity, we performed a direct comparison of the two enzyme complexes and found that the activity of nsp8 alone was >2-fold lower than when nsp7 and nsp8 were present at equal molarity in the reaction (Figures 4D and 7B) . A similar comparison was performed for the de novo activity of nsp8, using the assay published by Imbert et al. (12) and taking the first dinucleotide (pppGpA) product as readout. Interestingly, both nsp8 and nsp(7+8) synthesized equal amounts of the pppGpA dinucleotide ( Figure 7C) , suggesting that the effect of nsp8 is limited to the primer-extension activity of nsp8. In addition, we observed that the de novo initiation activity of nsp8 was $2-fold higher than that of His-nsp8 ( Figure 7D ).",

To verify this hypothesis, we expressed nsp7-8-His and tested this protein for RdRp activity. Interestingly, this fusion protein, a potential intermediate of CoV replicase polyprotein processing and a multimer in solution ( Figure 7E ), showed primer extension activities that were comparable to or higher than the activity of nsp(7+8-His) ( Figure 7F ). The de novo initiation activity of nsp7-8-His was, however, $2-fold lower than the activity of nsp8 and nsp(7+8) ( Figure 7D ).

Remarkably though, the mechanism and enzymes required to catalyse RNA synthesis in the CoV RTC remain very poorly understood. Moreover, uniquely among RNA viruses which generally employ a single RNA polymerase to drive their RNA synthesis (1, 2) , the polymerase activity assays and nsp8 mutagenesis documented in this and other studies suggest that, in addition to the presumed nsp12 'main RdRp', other polymerase activities could play a critical role in the synthesis of SARS-CoV RNAs (10, 12, 37, 38) .",

The nsp(7+8) complex, at a 1 mM concentration of nsp7 and nsp8 monomers, incorporates $1 mM NMP. Per monomer, the activity difference is therefore 20-fold, but if we assume that most nsp7 and nsp8 monomers assemble into hexadecamers and that each hexadecamer contributes only one functional active site per incorporation event, the difference would be much smaller and only $2.5-fold.

Firstly, we note that in the published nsp(7+8) crystal structure four of the eight N-terminal D/ExD/E motifs in the complex reside at the border of partially unresolved N-terminal nsp8 domains, where the coordinates of up to 49 nsp8 residues and 5 exogenous amino acids derived from the removed GST fusion partner were not determined. In light of our own finding that unnatural N-terminal extensions severely impair nsp8's RdRp activity ( Figure 5 ), this suggests that the published crystal structure may not represent an active conformation of the nsp(7+8) polymerase. Secondly, we observe that residues D50 and D52, which are both crucial for nsp(7+8) activity, are residing in an a-helix in the nsp(7+8) structure (Supplementary Figure  S5) , whereas in canonical primases and polymerases, the catalytic centre is preferentially located on b-strands or turns (12, 22) . Thirdly, we note that Mg 2+ was lacking from the published nsp(7+8) crystal structure (13) , even though it is required for nsp(7+8) activity. Fourthly and last, we observe that a 1:1 ratio of nsp7:nsp8 is sufficient to capture all nsp8 in a higher molecular weight complex ( Figure 2F ) whereas previously a 2:1 ratio was required (13) , potentially due to the additional N-terminal residues that altered the dynamics of complex formation.",

            "text": "In summary, our results provide important novel insights into the functionality of the SARS-CoV hexadecameric nsp(7+8) complex and demonstrate its activity as an RNA polymerase. In addition, our experiments and controls revealed and address a number of disparities between previous claims and hypotheses (12) , and our own observations. The 'primase hypothesis' previously formulated by Imbert and co-workers (12) remains an intriguing model to explain the initiation of SARS-CoV RNA synthesis and is a topic that will be addressed in detail elsewhere. Nevertheless, based on the primer extension activity of nsp(7+8) on non-structured RNA templates, we can no longer exclude the possibility that nsp(7+8) may synthesise substantially longer products than mere oligonucleotide primers in vivo, possibly stimulated by the presence of additional viral protein factors that could e.g. provide RNA-unwinding activity. Consequently, it is now a distinct possibility that CoV RNA synthesis involves structurally different and functionally separable RNA synthesising complexes [e.g. containing nsp12 or nsp(7+8)], each possessing their own dedicated RdRp characteristics and function in viral plus or minus strand RNA synthesis. It will therefore be crucial to study whether these different polymerase activities are part of the same enzyme complex and, if so, whether they can influence each other's activity or are subject to additional control mechanisms.",

Clearly, mutation of K58 to alanine significantly reduced the binding affinity of nsp8, whereas mutation of D52 to alanine did not. We also noted that the change in charge due to the mutation (up to8-fold in the octamer) resulted in an upward shift of the dominant RNP band, relative to the dominant RNP in panel 3 A (labelled with black 1). (D) Five prime 32 P-labelled duplex RNA was incubated with a fixed concentration of nsp7 (5 mM) and increasing concentrations of wild-type nsp8 (0-5 mM). Note the migration shift of the dominant ribonucleotide-protein (RNP) complex in the presence of nsp7 (compare RNPs labelled with black 1 and grey 2). (E) Addition of an equimolar amount of nsp7 to the nsp8 mutants D52A and K58A stimulated binding of dsRNA. For reference, the 2:1 and 1:1 ratios of wild-type nsp8 and nsp7 are shown in the left panel. Asterisks indicate non-specific bands.
