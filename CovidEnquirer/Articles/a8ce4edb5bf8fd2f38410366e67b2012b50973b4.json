Methods: A questionnaire was sent to family medicine tutors affiliated with either the Chinese University of Hong Kong or the University of Toronto in 2003. The survey questions covered training for SARS, the use of screening tools, an anxiety scale, clinical practices, and demographic data. Results: 137 (74.8%) and 51 (34%) doctors from Hong Kong and Toronto replied to the questionnaire, respectively. Most (80-84.6%) had no training in infectious disease control and were not confident in dealing with SARS (68.1-73.5%). In Hong Kong, the screening tools provided by international agencies did not meet the local needs. In Toronto, lack of a centralized hospital admission policy and fully public laboratory probably resulted in appointment cancellation and dissatisfaction. There may be a need for deployment of personnel between institutions but loss of income was not a major concern. Conclusions: Sharing the ''lessons learned'' in different regions during a SARS outbreak will help prepare for the next epidemic.",

            "text": "The SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) epidemic created international anxiety because of its novelty, ease of transmission, and speed of its spread by way of airline travel. [1] [2] [3] [4] Both Canada and Hong Kong set up separate committees to carry out inquiries into the handling of this epidemic and published their reports at the end of 2003. 5, 6 There were many similarities in the management of SARS and its impact in these two locations. Neither had faced an epidemic that took such a direct toll on health care workers. No satisfactory laboratory tests were initially available to confirm diagnoses in suspected cases. Surveillance and warning systems were inadequate in preventing the outbreak of this emerging infectious disease, and many weaknesses of the clinical systems were exposed. However, very little was mentioned in the reports regarding the difficulties with which the frontline doctors in the community were confronted. One exception was the suggestion of developing integrated protocols for disease outbreak management at a population level, which would link both institutional and noninstitutional clinicians with intersectoral staff compensation. 7 During the SARS epidemic, family physicians in both locations were very much left to their own devices for screening, diagnosing, and managing anxious patients and families of suspected or confirmed disease. 8 In Hong Kong, seven family physicians and one community dentist contracted SARS, resulting in two subsequent deaths and the infection of at least one family member of one of the doctors. 9 In greater Toronto, three hospitals were closed. Although no casualties were noted from community health care personnel in Canada, many health care workers were quarantined, resulting in severe staff shortages and cancellations of all hospital-based outpatient clinics. The purpose of this study was to identify problems that family physicians had encountered during the outbreak, factors that had affected their readiness in managing SARS, and the degree of their satisfaction with their respective government's performance using cross-sectional surveys. The spontaneous communication and information exchange triggered by SARS have led to a series of international discussions that are likely to set a new standard for disease response and control.",

Based on the Theory of Reasoned Action, Ajzen 14 incorporated this type of conceptual framework with the idea that people's behavior is a consequence of their perceived control in terms of their knowledge base (what, how, and where information is obtained), their attitudes (confidence in diagnosing SARS and the types of training perceived as most appropriate), and their satisfaction (measured for future reference).

The data was entered, cleaned, and analyzed using SPSS (version 13).

For example, the Princess Margaret Hospital (a hospital with a specialty of infectious diseases even before SARS epidemic) was designed to receive all SARS cases at the beginning of the large community outbreak in the Amoy Gardens housing complex, which affected more than 300 residents. Toronto went in the opposite direction, allowing SARS cases to enter a large number of Toronto hospitals during the first wave of the outbreak, while decreeing that all nonurgent hospital activities should be suspended. This resulted in a massive backlog of deferred elective surgery and ambulatory services with immeasurable longterm damages. Laboratory services were also under strain: in Toronto, private corporations, nonprofit hospitals, and health regions operate medical laboratories. SARS testing was transferred to local hospitals because the public health reference laboratories were overwhelmed. The lack of a common data system and absence of prior agreements on data sharing undermined the laboratories' full capacities, which resulted in long delays in obtaining results. 9 Hong Kong, in contrast, had a large private laboratory capacity with linked data resources, but the lack of good laboratory protocol resulted in additional requests for laboratory tests, which were expensive and/or harmful for some patients. It is believed that having to continue the clinical service under these working conditions might have contributed to the dissatisfaction of the government's handling of the epidemic in Toronto.",

Loss of income and the specific applications of the screening tools were not important factors considered by family physicians when confronted with this disease outbreak, and were not sources of dissatisfaction toward the physicians' respective governments.",

Relevant and practical training in infection control can be made available to family physicians in the form of continuous medical education. An active and collaborative laboratory surveillance system would integrate frontline laboratories into the public health system to assist detection and control of infectious diseases in the future. Our study also reinforces the recommendations from expert committees in both regions that there is a need for instituting a mechanism for deployment of personnel between institutions. In contrast to these reports, family physicians did not associate loss of income with either readiness to deal with SARS or degree of satisfaction with the governments' handling of the outbreak, suggesting that doctors from both locations were ready to take up the professional and social responsibilities involved to deal with public health emergencies.",
