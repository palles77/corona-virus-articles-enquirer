The findings reported here indicate that MBP-reactive Lewis rat lymphoblasts are cytotoxic in vitro to syngeneic oligodendrocytes. However, several questions about the mechanisms involved and in vivo relevance to the pathogenesis of EAE remain to be answered. The cytotoxic effects of several reported T cell clones is restricted to target cells expressing the same major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens (Moretta et al., 1981; Krensky et al., 1982; Strassman et ai., 1984; Sun et al., 1986) . Although the cytotoxic reaction reported here appears MHC restricted, the oligodendrocytes used in this study expressed neither MHC I nor MHC II at the time they were exposed to the cytotoxic lymphoblasts (preliminary observations).",

However, such expression is usually required on the target cell itself. Furthermore, we saw no cytotoxic effect by MBP-reactive lymphoblasts in the presence of APC but no MBP. Therefore, it is more likely APC may present MBP for in vitro stimulation of the lymphoblasts. However, the cytotoxic reaction cannot be due simply to any stimulated lymphoblasts or its secreted products (e.g., lymphokines, shed MHC antigen (Hale et al, 1981; Emeesen, 1987) ) because TT-stimulated Lewis lymphoblasts were not cytotoxic.",

The usual transient nature of clinical manifestations of acute MBP-induced EAE in the Lewis rat suggests that dysfunction rather than frank destruction of oligodendrocytes and/or myelin may be the predominant in vivo event, possibly because of a lower effector/target cell ratio than present in vitro as described here.",
