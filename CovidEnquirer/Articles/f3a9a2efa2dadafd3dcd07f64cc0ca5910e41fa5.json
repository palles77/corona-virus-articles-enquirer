To facilitate rapid identification of H-PRRSV, a fluorogenic-probe hydrolysis (TaqMan)-reverse transcriptase PCR for H-PRRSV has been developed. Primers and probe specificity were evaluated with RNA extracted from 5 strains of H-PRRSV and 24 strains of other viruses, the results showed 100% specificity for the selected panel. The assay met the sensitivity of 1 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID 50 ) per ml of samples from infected pigs. Analysis with 10 5 -1 TCID 50 /ml H-PRRSV samples demonstrated high reproducibility with a coefficient of variation (CV) of 0.5-2.5%. More than two hundred samples from lung, spleen, blood serum specimens obtained from 22 outbreaks of suspected H-PRRS from March to June in 2007 were verified using this assay. The results showed that 68.5% (146 out of 213) of these samples were positive which is 100% consistent with that of the sequencing method. The assay can be performed in less than 3 h and thus provide a rapid method for the diagnosis of H-PRRSV as well as for elucidation of the epidemiology of H-PRRSV infections.",

Because of its economic significance, a great deal of resource has been invested in developing effective prevention and control strategies. But protocols providing consistent success have been elusive due to the high rate of genetic change and antigenic variability (Christopher-Hennings et al., 1995; Kapur et al., 1996; Halbur et al., 1996; Meng, 2000) . A diagnosis of PRRSV infection is based mainly on typical clinical signs, seroconversion, characteristic light microscopic lesions and the demonstration of PRRSV by virus isolation, fluorescent antibody (FA) examination, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, or PCR (Rossow et al., 1996; Rossow, 1998) .",

All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.jviromet.2008.01.009 caused by highly virulent Chinese-type PRRSV (H-PRRSV) strains. From January to July 2007, 39455 morbid pigs died among 143,221 infected pigs according to the administrative files. Rapid spread of the viruses and their persistence in some environments have made the control of outbreaks difficult and, at times, even impossible. A rapid, sensitive, specific diagnostic method would be extremely useful for the diagnosis and control of the highly virulent PRRSV in China. The present highly virulent PRRSV of Chinese-type isolate which lead to widespread epidemic in China has 87 bps deleted in the fixed region of its Nsp2 gene as compared to normal strains (Tian et al., 2007) . The current immunoassay is not capable of differentiating this mutant strain from the others, furthermore, the traditional RT-PCR method relies upon electrophoresis of the nucleic acids in the presence of ethidium bromide and visual or densitometric analysis of the resulting bands after irradiation by ultraviolet light (Kidd et al., 2000) . Real-time RT-PCR use specific fluorescence-labeled probes or primers to monitor the accumulating amplicon in real time, real time and automatic testing saves time. Real-time RT-PCR is valuable for detecting various pathogens around the globe, built on the data generated by conventional RT-PCR (Matthews and Kricka, 1990; Lomeli et al., 1989; Bustin, 2000) .",

The nucleotide sequence characteristics of H-PRRSV is that it has 87 bps deleted in the fixed region of Nsp2 gene by comparison to that of normal PRRSV, Thus, it provides an ideal site for designing a probe for real-time RT-PCR assay for H-PRRSV. In this paper, the TaqMan probe is oligonucleotides designed to bind to complementary target sequences presented within the Nsp2 gene of highly virulent Chinese-type PRRSV. No probe binding to the Nsp2 gene sequence of normal PRRSV due to the addition of 87 bps in this region by comparison to that of H-PRRSV. There are no other reports of real-time RT-PCR techniques to differentiate H-PRRSV strains from other strains of PRRSV due to the similarity of the target sequence between H-PRRSV and normal PRRSV, the method developed could specifically detect the highly virulent Chinese-type PRRS virus that has 87 bps deleted in the fixed region of Nsp2 gene.",

The other reason may be attributed to the different extraction protocol between serum and tissues. Finally we can conclude that the lower Ct value and higher positive ratio clearly indicated that compared with tissue from lung and spleen, serum has a higher predicative value of detecting H-PRRSV infection during surveillance screening. In the comparison of the realtime RT-PCR and virus isolation for H-PRRSV, 5 strains of the H-PRRSV were positive by real-time RT-PCR but negative by virus isolation, it may due to that VI has a lower sensitivity or the infection of H-PRRSV is in its window period.

The high specificity and sensitivity of the method demonstrated the practicality of real-time RT-PCR for the detection of H-PRRSV. The present identification assay for H-PRRSV by virus isolation was tedious because of the cell culture and sequencing. While, the assay described in this paper, a fluorogenic-probe hydrolysis (TaqMan)-real-time RT-PCR for rapid detection of H-PRRSV is developed with high specificity, sensitivity and reproducibility. The simplicity and accuracy of the assay make it a powerful tool for the detection and control of highly virulent Chinese-type PRRSV.",
