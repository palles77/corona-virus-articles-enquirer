In developed countries of the world, herpes simplex virus is considered to be the single most important cause of fatal encephalitis (Longson, 1973) . These cases are usually associated with type 1 herpes simplex (HSVI) infection (Nahmias and Roizman, 1973) , although type 2 herpes simplex virus (HSVJ has been isolated from patients with herpetic leptomeningitis (Craig and Nahmias, 1973) . In addition, about 50% of reported cases of neonatal herpes infection have had a concomitant encephalitis (Nahmias and Roizman, 1973) . In one survey, approximately 70% of these clinical cases of neonatal herpes were attributed to HSV2 and 30% were attributed to HSVi infection (Nahmias and Visintine, 1976) . A variety of animal models have been used to study the pathogenesis of herpetic encephalitis (Nahmias and Roizman, 1973; Stevens, 1976) .

Rats were inoculated with one of the following strains of HSV: the Mayo strain (obtained from the Laboratory Center for Disease Control, Ottawa, Ontario) or the EX 1966 strain (isolated from a case of herpetic keratitis by L. A. Hatch) of HSVi, and the MS or 075/72 (Percy and Hatch, 1975) strain of HSV*. Animals were inoculated subcutaneously in the interscapular region at 5 days of age. Each animal received approximately 25-50 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCIDS,J of virus, then were observed for a period of 2 weeks postinfection (pi). Clinically affected animals which died or were killed in extremis by chloroform inhalation were necropsied and tissues were routinely collected for light microscopy, fixed in Bouin's fluid, embedded in paraffin, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. In selected animals, brain tissue and eyes were collected, using aseptic technique, for viral isolation and titration studies. Tissues were also collected and fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde and processed for scanning (Cohen, 1974) or transmission (Percy et al., 1980) electron microscopy. Only those litters with clinically affected animals, and with confirmed positive HSV isolations from one or more animals were included in the study. The animals reported in this communication were HSV-inoculated, nontreated control littermates of animals utilized in an antiviral treatment study. Viral culture, isolation, titration, and identification procedures have been previously described (Percy and Hatch, 1975; Nahmias et al., 1971) .",

Hypertrophy of endothelial cells lining vessels in affected areas, and margination of leukocytes within vessels were frequently observed. Eosinophihc to amphophilic, homogeneous to finely granular intranuclear inclusions were observed within astroglial cells and neurons in these areas.

The failure to produce obvious herpetic vesicles following the subcutaneous inoculation of HSVl or HSVz was an unexpected finding. Cutaneous lesions were frequently observed in suckling rats inoculated intraperitoneally with HSVz (Percy and Hatch, 1975) . Oh and Minasi inoculated newborn rabbits subcutaneously with either HSVl or HSV2 and reported that severe skin lesions occurred only in the HSV*-inoculated animals. Similarly, visceral, CNS, and ocular lesions were more common with HSVz than with HSVi-infected animals (Oh and Minasi, 1980) . On the other hand, in our study, extensive lesions were observed in the CNS in both HSV1-and HSV2infected suckling rats, and lesions in the eye and viscera were sparse to absent. These variations may be a reflection of the strains of HSV utilized in the study, although the age at inoculation, and species variations between the rat and rabbit are among the other factors to be considered.",

These polycaryocytes were localized in the internal granular layer, and appeared to be comprised of neurons from this region. In the case illustrated in Fig. 1 , the presence of virus was confiied by the isolation of HSVi from the contralateral half of the sagitally sectioned brain. Multinucleated cells have been observed in other acute viral encephalitides. In hamsters inoculated intracerebrally with measles virus, polycaryocytes were observed in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex and were interpreted to be due to fusion of adjacent neurons (Baringer and Griffith, 1970) . In another study, syncytial cells were observed in the CNS of-mice inoculated intracerebrally with mouse hepatitis virus, a coronavirus (Lucas et al., 1977) . Depending on their location and appearance, multinucleated cells were interpreted to consist of astroglial cells, ependymal cells or inflammatory cells (Lucas et al., 1977) . On the other hand, the polycaryocytes seen in our study appeared to be confined to the cerebellar cortex, and were induced by a route other than intracerebral inoculation. It is known that a variety of enveloped viruses may induce syncytial giant cell formation by the alteration of cytoplasmic membranes and the fusion of virus-infected cells (Roizman, 1962) . It has been suggested that the induction of polycaryocyte formation by measles virus may enhance viral spread within the CNS (Baringer and Griffith, 1970) .",
