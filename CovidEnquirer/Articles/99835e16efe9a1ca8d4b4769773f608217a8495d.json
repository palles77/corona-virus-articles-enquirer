This crisis, an epidemic outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), dramatically impacted the delivery of health care in Canada. Despite the passage of time since the last diagnosed case of SARS in April 2004, researchers have warned the global community to be prepared for future outbreaks of SARS or other infectious diseases. Methods: Qualitative interviews were conducted with 23 participants representing key stakeholder groups: (a) pediatric patients with probable or suspected SARS, (b) their parents, and (c) health care professionals providing direct care to SARS patients. Results: Participants conveyed key areas in which health policy and practice were affected. These included the development of communication strategies for responding to SARS; easing vulnerability among all stakeholders; and the rapid development of practice guidelines. Conclusion: Given the continuing threat of current and future airborne viruses with potential for epidemic spread and devastating outcomes, preparedness strategies are certainly needed. Effective strategies in pediatrics include practices that provide family centered care while minimizing disease transmission. Toward this end, lessons learned from previous outbreaks merit consideration and may inform future epidemics.",

As new struggles emerged on a daily basis, responses and implementation were immediately necessitated. Policy considerations that affected day-to-day patient care comprised infection control and patient care protocols as well as integrated change and in some cases a sense of systematic chaos. Virus spread was ultimately contained in hospitals through restricted entry as well as limited movement within and between health care facilities. Screening processes elicited information about individual exposures, symptoms, and epidemiologic links to SARS [5] , and hospital entry was restricted on the basis of this reported information. Visitors to hospitals were largely eliminated except for immediate family members of critically ill, dying, birthing or pediatric patients [5] . Even in these critical situations, pediatric patients were limited to only one parent visitor at a time, although in some cases, children had no visitors.",

When treating patients with suspected or probable SARS, double isolation gowns, hair caps, masks, face shields, and gloves were required [5] . Negative pressure isolation rooms with antechambers were used for patients thought to have SARS, and staff were required to remain outside negative pressure isolation rooms as much as possible [10] . Clearly, SARS resulted in substantial changes to health care practice and frequent shifts in infection control requirements, with health care providers reporting substantial frustration and anxiety [6] .",

As the pediatric crisis of SARS in Canada was relatively localized, we attempted to include all eligible pediatric SARS patients and their parents, as well as the respective health care provider. All participants were interviewed 2 months after hospitalization to provide time for experiential reflection and patient recovery. Interview questions invited participants to systematically document and identify their experiences; perceived policy and practice implications of SARS; and lessons learned in the event of a future outbreak. Patient participants were recruited from a database of all children in Toronto admitted to hospital for suspected or probable SARS (a classification clinically determined by fever and/or radiographic evidence of chest pathology). While children under 6 years of age were also admitted with probable or suspected SARS, they were not interviewed due to their young age; however, parents of these young patients (n = 5 parents of young children) were included in the sample of interviewed parents. Sampled children and parents represented a range of cultural backgrounds, and all children ultimately recovered from SARS. Health outcomes for parent participants ranged from full recovery to death.",

However, explanations directed to children could have occurred much earlier which, participants suggest, would have fostered adherence. This finding is consistent with earlier SARS literature which suggests that greater explanation of reasons for protocols such as quarantine, is linked to increased compliance [21, 22] , and highlights the significance of ensuring that children, as major stakeholders, receive the information they need in developmentally appropriate ways. These findings suggest that the flow of information in pediatric settings presents unique challenges for health care providers, particularly in ensuring that information is as comprehensible as possible, yet also as simple and clear as possible even for the very young child.",

This required attempts to balance risk management and quality of life through continual justifications of the system to accommodate changing information. While stakeholders understood the need for policy shifts, they lacked an understanding that chaos was, under the presenting risks and uncertainty, a reasonable \"norm\" [28] and they did not appear to have accessible means to 'streamline' or control the presenting volatility. As an example, information was transmitted through various means and sources. Systematizing the flow of information, a means of adding predictability and order, may have increased health care staff's ability to rapidly assimilate, apply new learning and routinize constantly shifting data. Moreover, increasing stakeholders' collective knowledge about means of managing this new state of disequilibrium may have 'normalized' or provided tools for handling chaos during this time of abnormality [28] .",

Based on widespread vulnerability, fear and social stigma, stakeholders, including patients, family members and health care providers, emerged as populations at emotional and physical risk. The development of patient, family and workplace risk assessment processes and psychosocial assistance are critical. In the SARS crisis experience, tangible appreciation and recognition for frontline health care providers appeared to be desirable and needed. Finding ways to meaningfully recognize the fortitude and contribution of direct practitioners may go a long way in encouraging and sustaining these key stakeholders.",

Examining the occurrence of the recent SARS outbreaks provides experience for future crisis contingency planning. Planning strategies include rapid virus containment, seamless and coordinated communication, humane and accessible care, effective leadership, and the timely development (or adaptation) of practice guidelines. Toward this end, strategies include the creation of preparedness guidelines, competency and capacity-building, and the development of a quorum of skilled and deployable health care professionals and epidemiologists. Given the continuing threat of current and future airborne viruses with potential for epidemic spread and devastating outcomes, preparedness strategies are integral to responsible health care planning. The SARS crisis provides us with tangible lessons and a template from which innovation can incorporate practical, ethical and multisectoral elements in devising a pandemic plan.",
