At the time the telephone survey was conducted, on October 14, 2005, the media announced the introduction of AI in Europe. We therefore ensured that at least 90 interviews were conducted in each country after October 18, 2005. The questionnaire focused on risk perception of AI and other infectious diseases, precautionary behavior, and use of information sources; it was based on our earlier study of risk perception of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (9) . Respondents first received a brief explanation of AI.",

Multivariate analysis showed that country, sex, and age group remained inde-pendent significant factors and showed a significant interaction between country and sex and between country and age group (Figure) . In all countries, except Singapore, risk perception was higher among women than men, but this difference was smaller in Asian than in European countries.

Takeuchi's interviews on food safety practices of consumers in Thailand found high levels of knowledge of AI but lower levels of risk perception and behavior change (11) . If we compare our results with those from several studies on perception of risk for SARS, we find that perception of risk for SARS in some of the Asian countries was relatively low compared with that in the United States (12) .
