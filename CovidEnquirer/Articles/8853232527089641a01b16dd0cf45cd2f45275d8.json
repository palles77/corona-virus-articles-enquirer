Recombinant S protein was synthesized as an endo-P-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Endo H)-sensitive glycoprotein with high mannose simple oligosaccharides (gpl90) that underwent post-translational modification to an Endo H-resistant glycoprotein with complex oligosaccharides (gp210). lmmunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that the majority of recombinant S protein was retained at the Golgi but some S protein was expressed on the plasma membrane. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against native S protein reacted with this recombinant S protein; also, mice infected with the recombinant vaccinia virus (rVV) expressing the S protein induced TGEV neutralizing antibodies. A truncated S protein (SA) was also expressed in rVV-infected cells by introducing a deletion into the S protein cDNA that removed 292 amino acids from the C-terminus. The SA protein (gpl70) was shown to be antigenically similar to TGEV S protein by immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation tests but was retained in the endoplasmic reticulum and not expressed on the cell surface.",

The virus causes gastroenteritis in neonatal pigs, resulting in a high mortality and morbidity. TGEVvirions are composed of three structural proteins; a basic phosphorylated nucleoprotein (N) M, 47,000 was shown to associate with the viral genomic RNA to form the nucleocapsid and interact with a glycosylated membrane protein (M) observed as a series of polypeptides n/r, 28-31,000, and the peplomer or spike (S), a surface h/l, 200,000 glycoprotein (Garwes and Pocock, 1975) . The TGEV S protein has been shown to elicit a neutralizing antibody response (Laude et a/., 1986; Jimenez et al., 1986; Gatwes et a/., 1987) capable of conferring some protection to suckling pigs (Garwes eta/., 1978/79) . By analogy to the S protein of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), the TGEV S protein may possess the cell receptor binding components (Collins et a/., 1982) and virulence determinants of the virus (Fleming et al., 1986) .

The FS772/70 strain S protein has a 1449-amino acid precursor polypeptide with 33 potential N-linked glycosylation sites and 97% sequence homology at the nucleotide and the amino acid level with the Purdue strain. From the deduced amino acid sequence the coronavirus S protein was shown to contain characteristic features: a 16-amino acid cleavable secretory signal; a heptad repeat sequence that forms a-helical structures which may interact with other subunits to form a coiled-coil oligomeric structure ; a hydrophobic sequence near the C-terminus that is probably responsible for anchoring the S protein to the virion envelope.

The SA gene, contained in pGSPA-38, was 3474 bp long, capable of encoding a 1157-amino acid polypeptide, corresponding to a deletion of 292 residues from the complete S protein and also included eight amino acid residues derived from the pUCl2 polylinker and pGS20 sequences.

TGEV S protein was immunoprecipitated from cell lysates or tissue culture fluids using porcine TGEV hyperimmune antiserum. This resulted in S polypeptides of AJ 190,000 (gpl90) and AJ 210,000 (gp210) being immunoprecipitated from vTS-1 -infected cell lysates in the absence of tunicamycin (Fig. 3 , lane 2) while in the presence of tunicamycin, a AA, 160,000 (~160) precursor S polypeptide was synthesized (Fig. 3, lane 3) . Cells infected with vTSA-1 expressed a M, 170,000 glycosylated polypeptide (gpl70) only (Fig. 3, lane 4) that was expressed as a AA, 130,000 (~130) precursor protein (Fig. 3, lane 5) in the presence of tunicamycin. It was noted that the levels of S protein expressed were appreciably less in the presence of tunicamycin (Fig. 3) . Comparison of the nonspecifically precipitated proteins in the presence or absence of tunicamycin (Fig. 3) indicated that the reduction in S protein synthesis was not due to inhibition of viral replication in the presence of tunicamycin. These observations suggested therefore that either glycosylation was required for efficient synthesis of the S protein or the majority of the anti-S antibodies were directed against the glycosylated form of the protein resulting in less efficient immunoprecipitation of the nonglycosylated form. Although gp210 was immunoprecipitated from the vTS-1 -infected cell culture medium in the absence of tunicamycin (Fig. 4 , lane 3) no detectable extracellular SA protein (gpl70) was recovered from medium of vTSA-l-infected cells (Fig. 4, lane 6) suggesting that the membrane anchor is required for export out of cells. The lack of detectable ~160 or ~130 in the culture medium of vTS-l-and vTSA-l-infected cells, respectively (Fig. 4 lanes 4 and  7) , could result from the levels being too low to be detected by the antibodies due to reduction in synthesis or the lack of glycosylation of the S protein in the presence of tunicamycin.",

After a I-hr pulse, the TGEV S protein consisted of a major gp190 component and a minor gp210 component (Fig. 5A) . After a 1-hr chase, gpl90 and gp210 were present in approximately equal proportions but after a 2-hr chase, gp210 was the dominant S protein component and the majority was Endo H resistant. TGEV S protein steadily became Endo H resistant with time such that after a 4-hr chase virtually all S protein had been modified in the Golgi. S protein was also detected in the tissue culture medium of TGEV-infected cells after a 1 -hr chase and accumulated steadily with time. Digestion of gp210 from extracellular or intracellular sources with Endo H reduced the size of the S protein to M, 205,000 . This observation has also been made for the FIPV S protein from FIPV-infected feline cells (Vennema eta/., 1990) and suggested that coronavirus S proteins still have high mannose or hybrid oligosaccharide structures following Golgi processing. The recombinant S protein was completely Endo H sensitive after a 1-hr pulse and after chasing became partially Endo H resistant with approximately half of the protein observed as unresolved components of high molecular weight (Fig. 5B ). Extracellular S protein was not detected in the culture medium after chasing for 4 hr because S protein transport from the RER through the Golgi stack and out of the cell was significantly disrupted in the absence of coronaviral morphogenesis. Infection of LLC-PKl cells with vTS-1 produced a discrete Mr 2 10,000 Endo H-resistant form of S protein (data not shown). This was in contrast to the partial Endo H-resistant forms observed in vTS-1 -infected HTK-cells, implying that the TGEV S protein may be post-translationally modified to a different extent depending on the origin of the cell line. The SA protein remained completely Endo H sensitive, even after a 4-hr chase, demonstrating that the truncated S protein was glycosylated with high mannose oligosaccharides only and was not subject to Golgi-specific modifications (Fig. 5B ).",

This gene construct expressed an Endo H sensitive M, 180,000 polypeptide that was not transported to the cell surface in rVV-infected cells (Hu et al., 1985) . Sequence analysis of the TGEV Purdue-l 15 (Jacobs et al., 1987; Rasschaet-t et al., 1987) and FS772/70 strains demonstrated that the Xbal site was 3776 bp from the S protein initiation codon and within an ORF of 4350 bp, implying that the S gene product expressed by Hu et a/.

The rVV vTS-1 produced two S protein species in human cells with different oligosaccharide composition, assigned gpl90 and gp2 10, while the SA protein was expressed in human cells as a single glycoprotein species designated gp170. The gp210 was partially resistant to Endo H, suggesting that gpl90 was modified to gp210 by the addition of complex oligosaccharides at the Golgi.

Both of these observations were made for the FIPV (79-l 146) S protein expressed in a bovine papilloma virus transformed mouse cell line (de Groot et a/., 1989) . However, the TGEV S gene expressed by a rVV in porcine LLC-PKl cells produced an Endo H-resistant gp210 product with no partially resistant Endo H intermediates. A similar observation was also made for the FIPV S gene expressed by a rW in feline cells (Vennema et al., 1990) , suggesting that expression of coronavirus S proteins in a cell line compatible with their origin may have profound effects upon the extent of post-translational processing of these proteins.",

Retardation of coronavirus S protein intracellular transport has also been observed for the FIPV and MHV S proteins expressed by rVVs (Vennema et al., 1990) . In this study, retardation between the RER and the Golgi in the absence of virus budding was interpreted as a transient accumulation of the S protein at or near the site of virus budding and suggested that the S protein may have a role in defining the site of virus budding, a func-tion previously ascribed to the M proteins of coronaviruses (Booze et al., 1985) . lmmunofluorescence studies with vTS-infected cells demonstrated that recombinant S protein accumulated in a polar perinuclear compartment of the cell, a similar observation was seen for the cellular localization of rVV expressed TGEV M protein (Pulford and Britton, 1990 ) and at the cell surface. The presence of TGEV gp210 in the culture medium of vTS-infected cells suggested that gp210 may be released from the cell.",

            "text": "Proteins can be transported from the RER to the Golgi by interacting with carrier proteins or following membrane incorporation, by the flow of membrane from the ER to the cell surface. This membrane flow may be responsible for the cell surface presence of coronavirus S proteins. The SA protein was not processed in the Golgi apparatus, nor found on the cell surface nor found to be exported into the extracellular medium, indicating that the C-terminal membrane anchor domain of TGEV S protein may be required for all of these functions. Puddington eta/. (1986) used a mutant VSV G protein to establish that the cytoplasmic tail of the G protein was essential for its transport through the Golgi stack. In addition, Bray eta/. (1989) used rWs to demonstrate that a Dengue virus envelope protein truncated at the C-terminus, unlike the wild-type protein, was not secreted into the extracellular medium. However, Sveda et a/. (1982) found that C-terminal sequences of the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) were essential for cell surface expression and that mutants with a disrupted anchor domain were secreted, suggesting that influenza virus HA, unlike TGEV, VSV, and Dengue virus envelope proteins, underwent a different protein maturation pathway. Evidence suggests that unless a membrane glycoprotein folds into a native or near-native conformation it will not be exported from the RER (Lodish, 1988) . However, the general conformation and antigenicity of the SA protein appeared to be retained as it reacted with both polyclonal and monoclonal TGEV S antisera in contrast to denatured S protein or S protein expressed in E. co/i cells (Correa et a/., 1990; Delmas et a/., 1990; Pulford, unpublished observations) . The results presented in this paper suggest that the SA protein was retained in the RER possibly due to the removal of essential C-terminal transport signals.",
