Data is presented in accordance with geographic distribution, time and risk classifi cation of the etiologic agents found, according to Ministry of Health regulations. The importance of this epidemiologic surveillance system is presented, debating the main topics required for quality improvement and information analysis. It is concluded, from the analysis of epidemiologic events and their relation to risk management, that the compulsory notifi cation system in Brazil is incomplete, irregular, delayed and, in a large percentage of cases, notifi cation cannot be completed and the agent may not be identifi ed. Quality of data varies from one region to another and from county to county within the same region. There is a high proportion of cases in which the etiologic agent is unknown and, in such cases, a high lethality is expected, establishing a high risk exposure condition for those health professionals involved in health surveillance. From these data, the study points out the need to improve the surveillance system and strengthens the idea of building maximum containment laboratories.",

It was necessary to know the real conditions of the country's institutions when it comes to quality in Biosafety. To this end, a Biosafety Offi ce (NUBio) of Oswaldo Cruz Foundation (FIOCRUZ), which had already been carrying out a survey on the risks, was contacted, and in 1996, a Scientifi c and Technological Capacity Building Program in the Biosafety Field was implemented.",

The main results of this survey were identifi ed as awareness of the issue of some 900 health workers who participate in courses and creating biosafety internal committees in the institutions involved. 12 In the year 2000, the Brazilian Public Health Laboratories Coordination (CGLAB), today part of the Health Surveillance Secretariat (SVS), has, in cooperation with the Centers for Disease Control/EUA and Nubio/FIOCRUZ, set up a capacity building program aimed at training multiplier subjects in biosafety. According to this group's view, biosafety issues go far beyond genetic manipulation and its ethical issues, limited to a small sample of highly specialized laboratories or facilities. Funding of laboratories belonging to the National Public Health Network was set up as a priority. This net is composed of LACEN, linked to the State's Secretariat of Health (SES) and by reference institutions linked to the MS, such as FIOCRUZ and Pasteur Institute (SP). These labs are responsible for most of disease diagnosis under surveillance and, therefore, use techniques for handling infectious agents that may be considered routinely risky.",

These cases are reported to the sanitary authorities independently of being found in the National List of Compulsory Notifi cation Illnesses and Diseases.

This group comprises Hantaviruses, prions (registered as prionic diseases and CJD), the cases of wild-type Yellow Fever and Botulism. Health professionals handling materials suspected of containing agents of this risk group should be mandatorily protected as to the risk of airborne transmission. They have to use, among personal protection equipment, respiratory protection masks with greater fi ltering effectiveness (N95-fi ltering effectiveness of 95% of the particles up to 0.3 \u00b5).

These events should be worked on within maximum containment conditions, as they are pathogens which do not bear information on their forms of transmission, thereby increasing the risk.

The one pertaining to the natural history of the disease, which covers the knowledge of disease evolution in the individual, stands out. Normally, one ascertains a period of anatomical or functional changes which highlight the subclinical or unapparent phase, which culminates with the beginning of the symptoms (incubation period). However, although diseases are unapparent during the incubation period, a number of pathological changes can be detected during this phase by means of laboratory methods, although most of the time diagnosis may only come up through symptoms. This fact is exacerbated by the instance that a considerable portion of the cases remains below the clinical horizon and, therefore, are not identified by their symptoms. Waldman 17 points out still that \"the higher the proportion of unapparent cases, the greater will be the difficulties to learn the infections processes, and to identify the main responsible agents for disease transmission within the community, as known cases represent only the tip of the iceberg\". This shows that the possibility of a disease whose etiological agent is unknown and with a long period of incubation, transmitted by airborne agents is quite high. Thus, there is need for immediate implementation of control and prophylaxis methods in the region affected, such as isolating cases during the transmissibility period (when known); measures aiming at preventing or mitigating the disease, its complications and consequences; quarantine or isolation of the healthy population (human or animal) follow-up of the reported cases following the date of the last contact with an infected person. Compliance with the Biosafety principles is of paramount importance at all stages of epidemiological investigation, in the sense of preventing the spreading of pathogens; the capture, handling and safe transport of biological samples; assistance to the population affected and protection to the professional himself, so that the latter does not become a spreading source of the pathogenic agent.
