Chest auscultation disclosed inspiratory crackles over the right lower zone. Results of a complete blood count showed a total leukocyte count of 6.19 \u00c2 10 3 cells/mm 3 , hemoglobin of 15.2 g/dL, and a platelet count of 175 \u00c2 10 3 platelets/mL. The patient's neutrophil count was normal at 5.01 \u00c2 10 3 cells/mm 3 , but mild lymphopenia (0.91 \u00c2 10 3 cells/mm 3 ) was noted. Liver function was mildly deranged, as demonstrated by elevations in serum alanine aminotransferase (60 U/L) and aspartate aminotransferase (62 U/L). Serum bilirubin was normal at 0.76 mg/dL (13 mmol/L), as was alkaline phosphatase at 73 U/L. The patient's erythrocyte sedimentation rate (20 mm/h) and serum C-reactive protein level (3.8 mg/dL) were mildly elevated. A chest radiograph showed right middle zone haziness ( Figure 2 ). Contrast-enhanced computed tomography of the thorax displayed ground-glass changes in the lower lobe of the right lung ( Figure 2) .",

Other considerations were the development of a characteristic roseola-like macular skin rash after 2 days of fever, the lack of evidence of other bacterial or viral causes of pneumonia, and the detection of human herpesvirus 6B DNA in a nasopharyngeal aspirate during the symptomatic phase.

Furthermore, the absence of detectable human herpesvirus 6B DNA in his serum reflected the transient viremic phase typical of primary acute infection. 3 Endogenous reactivation, on the other hand, is characterized by persistent viremia, because latent human herpesvirus 6B is predominantly incorporated within circulating CD4 \u00fe lymphocytes. Finally, the positive nasopharyngeal aspirate and the negative serum specimen definitively excluded chromosomally integrated human herpesvirus 6B, an inherited condition that is generally associated with very high viral loads in the circulation. 4 Polymerase chain reaction's utility in analyzing nasopharyngeal aspirates of patients with suspected human herpesvirus 6B pneumonia is underscored by our experience. Asymptomatic shedding of the virus in saliva, a welldocumented occurrence, limits the value of polymerase chain reaction testing of expectorated sputum specimens and even bronchoscopic lavage samples, which might contain oral secretions. 5 Although shedding of human herpesvirus 6 in nasopharyngeal aspirate has not been rigorously studied in healthy individuals, we simultaneously performed polymerase chain reaction testing on 100 nasopharyngeal aspirate specimens from adults, and all were negative for human herpesvirus 6 DNA (data not shown), suggesting that asymptomatic shedding is not a common phenomenon.",

The relatively toxic antivirals, ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir, have been used to treat human herpesvirus 6 disease or reactivation. However, drug toxicity and reduced drug susceptibility are a problem and pose management difficulties, especially in immunocompromised patients. The antimalarial agent artesunate was reported to have in vitro efficacy against human herpesvirus 6 and the closely related cytomegalovirus, and it was successfully used to treat a patient with human herpesvirus 6B myocarditis. 12, 13 When constructing a differential diagnosis, physicians should be aware that human herpesvirus 6B is a potential culprit in atypical pneumonia in adults. The virus may be overlooked in populations with low seroprevalence.",
