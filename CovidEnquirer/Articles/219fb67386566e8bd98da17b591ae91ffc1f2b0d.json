(A) Representative polysome profile obtained after sucrose density centrifugation of RNA9 protein complexes extracted from a LCL treated with cycloheximide. The types of RNA9ribosome complexes that were separated by the gradient are depicted below the profile. The RNA species present in the different fractions were purified and loaded onto an agarose gel to visualize the 18S and 28S rRNAs. Fractions 1 and 2 contain free RNA devoid of ribosomes, fraction 3 corresponds to the 40S ribosomal subunit associated with RNA as demonstrated by the presence of 18S rRNA in the absence of 28S RNA, fraction 4 mainly contains 60S ribosomal subunit with a predominance of 28S rRNAs, fractions 5 to 7 contain RNA associated to a single 80S ribosome as shown by the presence of both 18S and 28S rRNAs, whereas fractions 8 to 12 contain RNA bound to an increasing number of polysomes that migrate more and more quickly in the sucrose gradient. (B) Lytic replication levels in the samples used for library generation. Immunofluorescence stainings for the lytic cycle proteins revealed the percentage of cells expressing BZLF1 and gp350 in LCLs infected with M81 or B9598 that is given in the graph of bars. Below we show a representative western blot with a BZLF19specific antibody using extracts of LCLs infected with either one of the two strains. Quality control data of the sequencing experiments. (A) For each cellular gene, the reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (RPKM) obtained by total RNA sequencing of the M81Binfected LCL generated from sample 1 are plotted against the RPKM values obtained from total RNA sequencing of M81B infected LCLs from sample 2. We indicated the Pearson's correlation coefficient between the two data sets. (B) Same as in (A) but with RPKM values obtained from total RNA sequencing of B95B8Binfected LCLs. (C) For each cellular gene, the number of ribosomeBprotected fragments sequenced from the LCLs generated with sample 1 by infection with M81 and treatment with harringtonine for 2 min was plotted against its counterpart generated with sample 2 and the resulting Pearson correlation coefficient is given.

A large number of reads mapped to the EBER1 and EBER2 genes. The EBER RNAs form a complex with multiple proteins that presumably protected them from nuclease digestion. The remaining sequences mapped to the different parts of the viral gene loci. These include 5'leader, AUG initiation site and open reading frame (here referred to as coding DNA sequence (CDS)), introns, 3' untranslated regions (3'UTR), as well as DNA located between viral genes (intergenic) and genes that encode ncRNA.

(A) Read distribution on latent genes in libraries generated with the cycloheximide7treated LCLs. The reads are classified according to their localization within the mRNA transcripts: coding DNA sequence (CDS), annotated start codon (AUG), 5' leader of the mRNA transcript (5'leader).LMP2A and LMP2B are pooled together and given as LMP2. EBNA7LP was omitted due to the repetitive nature of its exons that precludes accurate mapping. The reads that map to the U exon are shared by the members of the EBNA3 family genes and by EBNA1 and cannot be distinguished. Therefore, we ascribed one fourth of the total reads to each gene. Similarly, we divided the reads that mapped to the Y2 exon between the latent genes that carry it.(B) Ratios of reads mapping to the 5'leader vs the AUG and the open reading frame (combined) of the latent genes (out:in ratio). (C) Ribosomes are captured in the 5'leader. Ratios of reads covering the 5'leader of the latent genes to the reads covering their start codons. EBNA3A did not have any AUG coverage in any of the three libraries generated for LCLs treated with harringtonine. Thus, the 5'leader:AUG ratio is meaningless. EBNA1, 3B and 3C show a large excess of reads that map to their 5'leader. Influence of the 5'leader on the translation of lytic genes. Ratios of reads mapping to the 5'leader of the respective genes to reads mapping to the start codon and within the open reading frame (plotted as out:in ratios) in the library generated with LCLs transformed with M81 and treated with cycloheximide. The gene list is sorted according to the presence or absence of ribosome footprints in the 5'leaders and the presence of uORFs. *The 5'leader of these genes overlaps with the CDS of other genes and as a consequence mapping of the reads in cells treated with cycloheximide can be ambiguous. Therefore, no ratio calculations could be performed for these genes. Efficacy of ribosome trapping in the 5'leader of lytic transcripts. (A) The figure shows the distribution of ribosome footprints within lytic genes in M81:transformed LCLs treated with harringtonine.
