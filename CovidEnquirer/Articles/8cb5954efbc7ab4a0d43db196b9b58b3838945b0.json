            "text": "Viroporins are small virus-encoded proteins that are able to permeabilize membranes for ions and small molecules. 1, 2 This family of proteins includes M2, 3 Vpu, 4 the E-protein channels of coronaviruses, 5 and the p7 ion channel of hepatitis C virus (HCV). 6 Viroporins commonly are small transmembrane (TM) proteins that contain several identical self-oligomerizing subunits forming functional ion channels. However, sequence similarity among the viroporin family is low, and the functional channels differ in subunit size, stoichiometry, and topology. 7 Viroporins are crucial for viral pathogenicity, owing to their involvement in several steps of the viral life cycle, but their main activities are in cell entry, virion assembly, and release from infected cells. 8 M2 protein of influenza virus equilibrates the pH across the viral membrane during cell entry, facilitating RNA release, 9, 10 and across the trans-Golgi membrane of infected cells during viral maturation. 11 The p7 protein of HCV is believed to act as an intracellular pH shunt, contributing to the deacidification of endosomes and virion-loaded particles and assisting in assembly and release of virions, 12 as well as promoting inflammatory signaling. 13 Owing to their role in the viral life cycle and their structural differences from human channels, these viral proteins are considered ideal antiviral drug targets. 8 Several compounds that block viroporin ion-channel activity have been identified. Two adamantane based compounds, amantadine and rimantadine, were the first US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs for treatment of influenza infections. 14 These compounds inhibit the M2 protein by blocking its proton conductance. 15, 16 It has also been found that these adamantane-based compounds can block HCV p7 ion-channel activity [17] [18] [19] and abolish p7-mediated inflammatory signaling in liver macrophages. 13 Structure determination of viroporins under physiological conditions has been difficult, due to the hydrophobic and dynamic nature of these proteins. The few available viroporin structures revealed unexpected architecture that helped in understanding the operation of these channels. 8 In addition, the binding mode of several ion-channel blockers was revealed, which provided guidance for designing other inhibitors. 8 Several structures of M2 protein in complex with adamantanes have been solved. These structures showed M2 as a tetramer and suggested two possible binding models for adamantanes: the pore-binding model and the exterior interface-binding model. 20, 21 In the pore-binding model, one adamantane molecule physically blocks the ion channel, breaking the continuous water wires in the channel that are critical for proton conductance. 21 For the exterior interface-binding model, four adamantane molecules bind allosterically at an external, lipidfacing pocket between adjacent monomers, thus inducing conformational changes in the TM helices that favor the closed state of the channel. 20 It was later confirmed that the pore-binding model is the pharmacologically relevant model that accounts for the antiviral activity of amantadine and rimantadine. 22, 23 Unfortunately, naturally occurring drug-resistant mutations have gradually decreased these adamantanes' inhibition ability. S31N is the predominant amantadine-resistant M2 form that represents a huge challenge to drug discovery.",

It was postulated that two camphor moieties bind to two adjacent sites of neighboring chains of M2. 28 However, these compounds were not tested on M2 protein, so the exact mechanism of inhibition of these compounds is unknown. It is noted that cage-shape molecules might inhibit influenza viruses through M2-independent mechanisms. 22 To further elucidate the M2 drug-binding mechanism and rule out the possibility of the exterior interface-binding model, we hereby report the design and characterization of dimeric amantadines and rimantadines. If the exterior interface-binding model is correct, the dimeric amantadines and rimantadines should have comparable or better channel-blockage activity than the monomeric amantadine and rimantadine. If the pore-binding model is correct, the dimeric amantadines and rimantadines should not be able to fit in the channel and have no channel inhibition. In contrast, the structure of p7 protein suggests the presence of several identical adamantane-binding pockets where six adamantane molecules are required to inhibit one p7 protein molecule. Accordingly, combination of two adamantane moieties in one molecule might lead to supra-additive increase in potency compared to the corresponding monovalent ligands. To test this hypothesis, we synthesized symmetric dimeric adamantane analogs of various alkyl-spacer lengths to find the optimum distance that allows simultaneous binding of the two adamantane rings. Here, we describe the design and synthesis of symmetric dimeric adamantane derivatives of various alkyl-spacer lengths and the determination of their inhibitory activity on two viroporins: M2 channels of influenza virus and the p7 protein of HCV.",

For measurement of whole-cell p7 currents, cells were perfused continuously with recording buffer during 1-minute recording intervals. Inhibitors were diluted from stock solutions (10 mM) into pH 5.5 buffer. Inhibition measurements were started with baseline recordings of extracellular buffer pH 7.5 (4-5 seconds), followed by pH 5.5 (to induce channel opening). Then, inhibitors (at pH 5.5) were applied, followed by final control applications. Sometimes, control solution (pH 5.5 without inhibitor) was perfused between inhibitor applications. Typical current amplitudes were 100-400 pA. Dose-response curves were constructed from four to five cells per GT and inhibitor and IC 50 values determined using a nonlinear fit to the equation I obs = I max /[1 + ([I]/IC 50 )], where I obs is the observed current at any given concentration of inhibitor, I max the maximum current amplitude observed in the absence of inhibitor, and [I] the concentration of inhibitor. IC 50 for the inhibition of p7 channels was determined from the concentration-dependent inhibition of p7-mediated TM currents.

When amantadine binds to the channel, it breaks the continuous water wires in the channel, which are critical for proton conductance. The positively charged ammonium group appears to mimic the conducting hydronium ion, forming hydrogen bonds with the backbone carbonyls of Gly34 that are mediated by the upper layer of water molecules. Importantly, amantadine binds to the M2-WT channel with its positively charged ammonium facing the C-termini of the channel, suggesting bulky substitutions on the amine group will not be tolerated. Our dimeric compounds (2a-e, 4a-e), with a secondary hydrophobic adamantane cage introduced in their structure, will not be expected to fit in the M2-WT channel. Indeed, as shown in Figure 3 , none of the dimeric compounds had improved channel blockage against M2-WT when compared with amantadine. Our results are also in agreement with previous structure-activity relationship studies where introduction of bulky substituents on the adamantane cage drastically decreased the compounds' M2 inhibitory activity. 32 The small diameter of M2 protein pores limits the size of ligands that can fit into the pores. As a result, the second hydrophobic adamantane moiety introduced in our dimeric compounds cannot be accommodated inside the M2 pore lumen, which explains the low inhibitory activity of our dimeric compounds relative to the monomeric amantadine and ligand 5a.",

All dimeric compounds showed relatively similar potency in the tested GTs, suggesting that all these compounds have a similar binding mode. Despite the increasing amount of structural data on p7, there is no consensus on which conformation exists during a natural infection. Because of the structural impact, the proposed binding mode of our compounds may differ depending on the 3-D model. Accordingly, we considered the two available NMR structures for p7 protein to develop hypotheses upon the binding mode of our second adamantane moiety. Two homology models for one of the GTs under study (GT2a, strain J6) were previously constructed 37 using the NMR structure of HCV p7 GT5a (PDB 2M6X) 26 as a template for model 1, and the NMR/MD structure of the monomeric form of GT1b as a template for model 2. 38 Although the exact binding mode of amantadinerimantadine is not clearly understood yet, it is generally agreed that they bind in a membrane-facing pocket centered on residue number 20.

The second adamantane moiety in compound 2a having the shortest spacer, cannot span this distance and thus cannot bind in the neighboring adamantane-binding site located in the adjacent monomer. This was also supported by preliminary docking studies, where the first adamantane ring in the dimeric compound 2a showed a similar binding mode as amantadine, while the second adamantane appeared protruding to another cavity ( Figure 5A and B) which may suggest the presence of a secondary adamantane-binding site. Future site-directed mutagenesis would be needed to confirm unambiguously the binding mode suggested by our docking studies. The inhibitory activity of adamantanes varied between the different GTs under study. GT-dependent sensitivity of p7 to multiple inhibitors was previously reported where amantadine could not inhibit p7 ion-channel activity in GTs 2a and 3a, 17, 19 similarly to what we also observed here. On the other hand, an extra ethyl group inserted between the adamantane ring and the amino group present in rimantadine led to at least 100-fold increase in potency compared to amantadine, indicating a better fit in the adamantane pocket. This could suggest that the size of the adamantane pocket in GTs 2a and 3a might be bigger than that of other GTs, and so amantadine could not induce the conformational changes necessary for favoring the closed state of p7 protein. Previous NMR and MD simulation experiments of p7 protein reported the presence of a proline residue at position 49 that forms a kink in the carboxy-terminal end of TMD2, tilting it toward TMD1 of the adjacent monomer and forming the proposed adamantane primary binding pocket. 39, 40 Examination of the p7 protein sequence showed both GTs 2a and 3a lacked this proline ( Figure 5C ). A proline residue in a TM helix typically changes the orientation of the helix, causing a kink or even breaking the helix. This common behavior results from its inability to act as a hydrogen-bond donor (tertiary amide) and steric interferences of its cyclic side chain with residues in the preceding helical turn. The lack of proline in GTs 2a and 3a could affect the kink angle of TMD2, causing possible changes in the size of the adamantane-binding pocket, which could explain the low inhibitory activity of amantadine. Our dimeric compounds; being more bulky; could overcome amantadine's resistance in GTs 2a and 3a, showing an even higher potency than that of rimantadine.",

The antiviral activity of these compounds was studied against two viroporins: M2 and p7. Upon testing on M2 protein, the extra adamantane moiety caused a decrease in potency relative to the reference monomeric compounds amantadine and rimantadine, implying that these dimers could not be accommodated by either M2-WT or M2-S31N proton channels. These findings, although disappointing, are consistent with previously proposed ligand-binding mechanisms: ligand binds to the M2-WT with its positively charged ammonium facing the C-terminal His 37 , while M2-S31N inhibitors need to have the adamantane-NH 2 + -CH 2 -aryl pharmacophore and bind to the M2-S31N channel with their aryl group facing the N-terminal Val27. On the other hand, these dimers could have been lodged in the structure of p7 protein and were able to address the differences in adamantanes' sensitivity among the various GTs of HCV. The dimeric analogs were equipotent to the monomeric reference ligands when tested on HCV GTs 1a, 1b, and 4a, while being 700-fold and 150-fold more potent than amantadine for GTs 2a and 3a, respectively. A positively charged amino group appears important for binding of amantadine to p7 channels of GT 2a, while being less important for binding to p7 of other GTs. These results will help in better understanding of the binding mode of adamantanes to the p7 protein. In summary, symmetric dimeric adamantane compounds appear to be promising p7 inhibitors across all GTs of HCV, where they may constitute a class of promising direct-acting antiviral drugs.",
