            "text": "THE pathogenic action of most mouse leukaemia viruses is difficult to study on account of the long and variable time before the appearance of leukaemia. Useful information on the multiplication and pathogenesis of these viruses might be obtained if a virus could be found which modifies their pathogenicity or, alternatively, which has its own pathogenicity modified. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV1) seemed a suitable choice for such an investigation: its pathogenic action is stable and predictable; it produces mild hepatitis in normal weanling mice and fatal hepatitis in weanling mice recently infected with Eperythrozoon coccoides (Niven, Gledhill, Dick and Andrews, 1952) ; and, it bears a general resemblance to many leukaemia viruses, e.g. in size, thermolability, host specificity (cf. Gledhill, Dick and Niven, 1955, and Moloney, 1960b) . Experiments described here were undertaken to study dual infections of mice with MHV1 and Friend or Molonev leukaemia agents (Friend, 1957; Moloney, 1960a) . It was found that, while prior inoculation of MHV1 reduced the pathogenicity of Friend leukaemia agent, fatal hepatitis resulted if the hepatitis virus was inoculated several days after the Friend agent. The latter phenomenon closely resembled the enhancement of MHV1 by E. coccoides. The Moloney leukaemia agent also enhanced MHV1 provided the inoculation preceded that of MHV1 by at least 20 days but the enhancement was somewhat less marked. The enhancement may provide a useful method for titration of Moloney agent.",

In mice inoculated with an agent able to potentiate MHV 1, mice which scored 3, 4 or 5 were regarded as infected with the potentiating agent. Thus, when E. coccoides was used to potentiate MHV1 in Albanv mice, more than half were dead by the 6th day after the vTirus inoculation and the remainder scored 3 and 4. The method adopted for the indirect titration of agents which potentiate MHr 1 was intraperitoneal inoculation of decimal dilutions of the agent in SS broth into groups of mice in the usual doses. This was followed by the intraperitoneal inoculation of MHV71 in the usual dose. The age of mice used for inoculation of the potentiating agent was selected so that the potentiation would be maximal when they reached 20-28 days, the age at which MHV1 was inoculated. Weanling mice satisfied this condition for Friend agent and baby mice for Moloney agent. A group inoculated with MHVl without any potentiating agent was also included. As indicated above, any mice which scored more than 2 were regarded as infected with the potentiating agent and the ID50 was calculated from the proportion infected at each dilution bv the method of Reed and Muench (1938) .",

The mice were killed 14 days after inoculation of the Friend agent and spleen of each was weighed. The experiment was repeated with weanling mice of the Albany strain and the results of both *experiments are shown in Table I . The most remarkable and unexpected observation was the high mortality from hepatitis in the Albany mice inoculated with MHV1 six days after Friend agent. Although only one Swiss mouse of the corresponding group died, the degree of hepatitis manifested at autopsy was greater than that produced by MHV1 in normal Swiss mice. As will be seen, the mean spleen weights of both strains of mice inoculated with MHV1 7 and 4 days before and 6 days after Friend agent are below those of the groups which received Friend agent only and, except for the Albany group which received MHV1 7 days before Friend agent, the differences are in fact significant at the 0-02 level of -probability. In contrast, the mean spleen weights of mice inoculated with MHV1 *one day before and 2 davs after Friend agent are not below those of the groups given only Friend agent. In another experiment in which groups of 10 Albany mice were inoculated with MHV1 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 days after the Friend agent, the mortalities from acute hepatitis were 5, 5, 10, 10 and 10. The mean spleen weights of the 5 survivors in the groups which received MHV 1 4 and 5 days after Friend agent (0.74 and 0-88 g.) were not less than that for the group which received only Friend agent (0 74 g.). Other experiments have confirmed that when MHV1 is given between 7 and 4 days before Friend agent, the splenic enlargement due to the latter is reduced; but the splenic enlargement is not lessened by MHV 1 given in the period from one day before to 5 days after the Friend agent. When MHV'l is given six days after the Friend agent splenic enlargement is apparently reduced but the evidence for this is based only on the results depicted in Table I .",

This view is supported by the fact that even dilute preparations containing Friend and Moloney agents enhance MHV1 and by the observation that Moloney agent must be inoculated as long as 20 or more days before MHV1 to increase its. pathogenicity. Furthermore, the fact that-for enhancement of MHV1 the times. of pre-inoculation of preparations containing Friend agent and Moloney agent are considerably different suggests that different infectious agents are operative in each case and this indirectly supports the contention that Friend agent and Moloney agent themselves are responsible for the enhancement. Nevertheless. the possibility that the enhancement is due to other factors present in the preparations cannot be excluded until purified preparations of Friend and Moloney agents are available.",

If this is also true for the enhancement of MHV1 by Friend and Molonev agents, it would imply that Friend agent attains a high titre in 4-7 days and Moloney agent in abouit 3 weeks. The point of interest, especially in the case of the Moloney agent, is that the virus would be present in high titre long before signs of leukaemia appear. For example, it might be that a certain cell-virus relationship of infrequent occurrence is required to produce the initial leukaemic cell. Indeed, if such were the case, most well adapted viruses which multiply over long periods of time with little or no direct pathogenic action might be potential agents of tumour production.",

The smaller amount of splenic enlargement which probably occurs when MHV1 is inoculated 6 days after Friend agent is more difficult to explain: it might be due to the capacity of MHV1 to parasitise and inhibit the division of tumour cells. Experiments to determine whether MHVI interferes with Moloney agent in the same way as with Friend agent have not been undertaken. Unless the interference were much stronger than that of MHV1 towards Friend agent, it would be very difficult to detect since the onset of leuikaemia occuirs at times scattered over several months. SUNIMARY WAhen Friend leukaemia agent was inoculated intraperitoneally into weanling mice from 4 to at least 8 days before intraperitoneal inoculation of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV1), the pathogenicity of the latter virus was much increased.",

The latter suspension titrated by the direct method gave an ID50 of 10-4.9 g. and took 157 days compared with 26 days for the indirect titration.
