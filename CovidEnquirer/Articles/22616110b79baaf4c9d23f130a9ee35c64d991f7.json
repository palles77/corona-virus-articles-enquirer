The aim of the study was to analyse the effect of Lactobacillus casei Shirota (LcS) on the faecal flora of IBS patients. Methods: In a randomised, placebo controlled, double blind study, IBS patients fulfilling the Rome criteria II were included. Patients took 2 bottles daily for 8 weeks, containing either LcS or placebo. Faecal samples were collected before intervention (week \u22122/0,S1), at the end of intervention (week 6/8,S2) and during follow-up (week 14/16,S3). Microbial populations (Bacteroides, anaerobes, bifidobacteria, coliforms, clostridia, and lactobacilli) were enumerated using quantitative plating. Total bacterial counts were performed using FISH. Bacterial DNA was analysed by quantitative Real-Time PCR for the detection of Atopobium spp., Bacteroides-Prevotella-Porphyromonas group, Clostridium coccoides-Eubacterium rectale group, Clostridium leptum subgroup, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, Desulfovibrio desulfuricans group, and Bifidobacterium spp. Statistical analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney U tests or Paired Wilcoxon tests. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: No significant differences in total bacterial counts were seen between the treatment and placebo group. Using quantitative plating, no significant differences were seen for the different bacterial groups between both groups. Significantly lower bacterial counts were seen in both groups for clostridia for S2 compared to S1 and S3. In the placebo group, significantly higher amounts of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli were detected for S2 compared to S1. Using qRT-PCR, significantly lower counts for D. desulfuricans group were seen in the placebo group compared to the treatment group. In the treatment group significant differences were seen only for S2 compared to S3, whereas in the placebo group, no significant differences were detected for the different bacterial groups at the different sampling points. Analysis at the IBS subtype level revealed differences in microbiota between the different subtypes. Conclusions: Although significant changes in the microbiota were seen during intake of LcS in the treatment group, differences in microbial populations between both groups were not significant. Interestingly, specific findings are likely to be associated with a specific IBS subtype rather than with IBS in general.",

Seventeen patients had a diffuse distribution of the opacities, in 61% it was bilateral, and lower and middle zones were those most frequently affected. No pleural effusions or pathological mediastinal lymph nodes were seen in this initial radiography. Patients with abnormal chest X-ray were more frequently men, smokers, had dyspnoea, pleuritic pain and diarrhoea. Conclusions: Although more of patients with influenza virus A infection showed normal chest X-ray, those with abnormal chest radiographies, characteristically showed areas of consolidation with or without ground glass affectation, bilateral and diffuse distribution, and predilection for lower and middle zones.

Systemic antibiotic therapy is the principle course of treatment in necrotizing soft tissue infection. Clinical trials have also shown Hyperbaric Oxygen (HBO) therapy to be effective in streptococcal myositis patients. Ozone (O3), known as a cytotoxic gas, has recently been shown to support immune system by activating oxidative mechanisms and increasing pro-inflammatory cytokines. In this study, we compared the effectiveness of antibiotherapy, HBO and O3 application on bacterial growth and wound recovery in a murine model of streptococcal myositis. Forty-five male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided in five groups. Myositis was caused by inoculation of 0.15 ml 0.5 McFarland streptococcus pyogenes to thigh region in the four groups other than the Sham group. Normal saline was given to the rats in one of the four groups as a control, whereas other three groups were treated by penicillin G (98 mg/kg in 0.25 ml intraperitoneally 2X1), HBO (100% oxygen, 2,5 Atm. 90 min. 2X1) and ozone (1 mg/kg 1X1 intraperitoneally). At the seventh day, histological and bacterial investigations were done on soft tissue specimens taken from thigh region. There was significant difference in response to therapy in all of the three groups compared to control group (p < 0.05). Antibiotic and ozone groups were also more successful than HBO (p < 0.05). Ozone group yielded better results than that of antibiotic group (p < 0.05). Our results conclude that Ozone therapy should be used in addition to antibiotic treatment in serious infections such as myositis.",

Objectives: The mutator frequency of 233 consecutive non-redundant Enterococcus faecalis isolates collected in a 2001 extra-hospital survey was investigated. Methods and Results: To detect mutators, a first approach was based on an agar diffusion method using a fosfomycin disk, and the identification of hypermutable strains was achevied by counting the \"squatter\" colonies growing in the inhibition zone after 24 h of incubation. Four strains (Ef1468, Ef1473, Ef1497 and Ef1591) with more than 50 Colony Forming Units within the fosfomycin inhibition area were considered as mutators. Their mutation frequency was evaluated on agar medium with or without rifampicin. The rates were comprised between 2.2\u00d710 \u22125 to 7.3\u00d710 \u22126 (SD, 2.4\u00d710 \u22125 to 7.3\u00d710 \u22126 ), i.e. at least 100-fold higher than five other tested strains taken at random in the collection, including the E. faecalis strain ATCC 29212 (frequency, <10 \u22129 ). The mutators were isolated from urine (Ef1468, Ef1473 and Ef1497) or sperm fluid (Ef1591). The analysis of mutSL was investigated for Ef1497 by PCR amplification and sequencing experiments. Five (A321T, A323S, A397E, K415N, I800S) and three (A437V, A440E, A495T) amino acid (aa) substitutions in MutS (858 aa) and MutL (710 aa) respectively, were identified in comparison to the reference sequence (GenBank accession no. AE016830). In addition, a nonsense mutation of the arginine at position 341 led to the inactivation of MutS; this mutation was associated with the hypermutability of Ef1497. Conclusions: The mutator frequency in a clinical population of E. faecalis was 1.7%. In a previous study, we have shown that linezolid mutants emerged more readily from Ef1497 than from E. faecalis ATCC 29212 (Ba et al., 2010 , Antimicrob. Agent Chemother., 54:1443 . Hypermutation capability of strains should be detected by the simple agar diffusion method using a fosfomycin disk, prior to a prolonged antibiotic monotherapy treatment. Our study gives the first evidence of an association of a MMR gene inactivation with a mutator phenotype in a clinical E. faecalis strain.",

Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) play an important role as a causative agent of children diarrhea. Integrons are DNA elements known to carry genetic cassettes responsible for antibiotic resistance. The objective of this study was to investigate the presence and resistance gene cassette content of class 1 integron among Enteropathogenic E. coli isolated from patients referred to Tehran hospitals. Methods: In this study, 300 stool samples were collected and Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli was detected using biochemical and serological methods and confirmed by PCR amplification of eae, stx1 and stx2 genes. Isolates with eae+/stx1\u2212/stx2\u2212 genotype were defined as EPEC and subjected to further analysis. Class 1 integron was investigated with primers specific for the conserved integrase gene (int). The variable resistance gene cassettes were amplified and sequenced. Results: During the study period 28 cases of Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli strains was detected and serotype O86 and O127 were appeared as dominant serotypes. Twenty two strains (79%) appeared to harbor class 1 integron among which the variable region was defined to be dfrA7, aadA1, dfrA1/aadA1, dfrA12/aadA2 which related to amplicons of approximately 750, 1000, 1700 and 2000 bp in sizes, respectively.",

Methods: Colistin resistant K. pneumoniae strains isolated in clinical and surveillance specimens of 10 patients, who were on colistin treatment, as well as sensitive strains isolated from the same patients before colistin use, were included in the study. Exact MICs for colistin were determined by the E-test strip. Sensitive and resistant isolates were epidemiologically studied by repetitive extragenic palindromic (REP)-PCR methodology. The basR and basS genes from the respective resistant and susceptible isolates were amplified by PCR and sequenced.

These mutations were not found in the susceptible strain. As b-lactams bind to the penicillin-binding motif KTG in the transpeptidase region, that is located in 582 position, alterations in or around the motif possibly confer resistance due to reduced affinity to b-lactams.

Rossi, S. Bergagna, A. Dondo, E. Debbia (Genoa, Turin, IT) Objectives: The emergence of antibiotic-resistant epidemic clones among animals should be monitored since clonal relatedness among certain O serogroup strains (i.e. E. coli O78) capable of causing disease in different hosts, humans included, has been shown and, although different molecules are employed, cross-resistance exists among fluoroquinolones used in human and veterinary medicine. An increased incidence of enrofloxacin-resistant E. coli associated with septic diarrhoea in calves was recently observed in northern Italy (from 14.3% in 2002 to >30% in 2007) . The aim of this study was to investigate this phenomenon. Methods: A total of 47 consecutive E. coli isolates exhibiting reduced susceptibility to enrofloxacin (intermediately resistant or resistant) causing septic diarrhoea in calves from 45 large-scale farms during 2006-2007, were studied. Phylogenetic group, antibiotic susceptibility and O serogroup were determined with RAPD and PFGE typing providing additional discrimination. Results: The majority (97.8%) of microorganisms (46/47) carried resistance to two or more additional drugs with the pattern: fluoroquinolone -ampicillin -co-trimoxazole -tetracycline -gentamicinthiamphenicol being the most represented (24/47; 51.0%). Plasmidmediated extended-spectrum and AmpC b-lactamases including plasmidmediated fluoroquinolone resistance genetic determinants were not detected. Third generation cephalosporins emerged as the most active antimicrobial agents tested (97.9% of susceptible strains). Conclusion: Overall, 37 different RAPD profiles and 18 different O serogroups could be distinguished among the typable strains indicating a substantial heterogeneity and suggesting the occurence of several independent selection events. However, approximately one fourth (11/47) of the strains belonged to serogroup O78 and PFGE revealed that the majority (7/11) of these were clonally related, indicating the selection of a O78 clonal group.",

Rodighiero *, E. De Vecchi, R. Mattina, T. Celeste, M. Toscano, L. Drago (Milan, IT) Objectives: Spreading of antibiotic resistance is of concern due to the increasing rate of isolation of multiresistant pathogens. Since commensal bacteria can transfer determinants of resistance to pathogens, studies on resistance should include lactic acid bacteria, especially those intended for use as probiotics. We performed this study aiming to evaluate the capability of some antibiotics to select for resistance in lactobacilli. Methods: Strains of Lactobacillus acidophilus (n = 13), Lactobacillus plantarum (n = 9), Lactobacillus crispatus (n = 6) and Lactobacillus casei (n = 12) isolated from human feces were included. Amoxicillin/clavulanate, erythromycin and tetracycline were tested. Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MICs) were measured with the microdilution broth method. Susceptibility was determined according to breakpoints established by EFSA. The frequency of spontaneous mutations was calculated as the number of colonies grown on antibiotic-containing agar plates per inoculum. Selection of resistance was performed at 4\u00d7 and 8\u00d7 MIC and peak serum concentration (Cmax). Susceptible isolates were serially subcultured onto agar plates containing a linear gradient of each antibiotic. Bacteria were exposed to ten consecutive passages on antibiotic-gradient plates, then to ten passages on antibiotic-free plates. Acquisition of resistance was defined as >4-fold increase in MIC. Stable mutants with reduced susceptibility to erythromycin were analysed by PCR to detect the presence of erm and mef genes. Results: Resistance to macrolides was observed in 16 strains (8 of them harboured the ermB gene) and to tetracycline in 11 strains; all strains were susceptible to amoxicillin/clavulanate. Frequencies of mutation of susceptible strains (n = 26) were lower at 8\u00d7 than at 4\u00d7 MIC. Tetracycline showed the highest frequencies of mutations. After multi-step selection an increase in MICs was generally observed. Such change was stable only in some strains. All tested antibiotics could select stable resistance in all species. Molecular characterization of resistant mutants did not lead to detection of erm nor mef genes. Conclusions: Our results suggest that a decrease in susceptibility following exposure to antibiotics might occur in some lactobacilli. So, evaluation of the ability to acquire resistance to common antibiotics should be performed in parallel with investigations on the presence of resistance determinants in strains intended for human and animal use.",

Omura (Tokyo, Kanagawa, JP) Background: Patients who suffer from MRSA infection are often coinfected with Gram-negative bacteria, and they are likely to be treated with a combination of vancomycin (VAN) and b-lactam antibiotics. However, this combination therapy causes the emergence of VAN-resistant MRSA, designated as b-lactam antibiotic-induced VAN-resistant MRSA (BIVR), which traps a large amount of VAN and lower free drug concentration in the mi-lieu. b-Lactam antibiotics inhibit peptidoglycan synthesis and promote the expression of autolysin resulting in the release of large amounts of peptidoglycan fragments into the extracellular milieu. We hypothesized that peptidoglycan fragments generated by the action of b-lactam antibiotics and autolysins were incorporated into the cytoplasm for recycling and promote synthesis of nascent lipid-II, an analogy to the case in Escherichia coli. Thus, we searched active compound(s), which mimics the role of b-lactam antibiotics in the induction of the BIVR phenomenon. Method: The BIVR strain K744 was used for the indicator cells in the BIVR assay. The compounds tested for the induction of BIVR phenomenon were either prepared from peptidoglycan fragments or the synthetics. The compounds to be tested were impregnated on a paper disc with a diameter of 8 mm, and that was placed on the VAN agar plate streaked with the K744 cells. The plates were incubated overnight. If the test compound was active, the indicator BIVR cells grow around a paper disc forming a hollow, of which diameter was measured. The non-BIVR cell show no growth zone due to the presence of VAN. Results: The purified muropeptide, GlcNAc-MurNAc-L-Ala-D-isoGln-L-Lys-(Gly4)-D-Ala-Gly2 and GlcNAc-1, 6-N, O-diacetyl-MurN-L-Ala-D-isoGln-L-Lys-(Gly4)-D-Ala-Gly2 at 75 mg per disc yielded 17.5 and 11.5 mm, respectively, of the K744 growth zone. The Gly4 peptide was not essential for the activity. The BIVR inducing activity was undetectable by GlcNAc-MurNAc-L-Ala-D-isoGln, MurNAc-L-Ala-D-isoGlu-L-Lys and L-Ala-D-isoGlu-L-Lys.",

Within this diverse group, VIM-producing Enterobacter cloacae is increasingly reported in countries such as Greece and Spain. In this report, we evaluate the evidence for transmission of carbapenem-resistant E. cloacae in a cardiothoracic intensive care unit (CT-ICU). Methods: Clinical, infection control and microbiological data were collated. Clinical specimens were cultured by rountine methods. Patients (rectal swab) and the environment were screened for CRE. Isolates were identified by Vitek 2 and susceptibility testing was performed by CLSI disc diffusion. Evaluation for carbapenemase was conducted using the modified Hodge test (MHT), metallo-b-lactamase (MBL) Etest and synergy testing. PCR detection of carbapenemase genes and analysis of Xba1-restricted PFGE banding patterns were also performed. Results: Carbapenem-resistant E. cloacae were cultured from sternal wounds of 2 patients within a 6-day period. Both patients had received broad-spectrum antibiotics but neither had a history of recent travel. Their respective stays in the CT-ICU had overlapped for 11 days. Both were treated with appropriate antibiotics while aggressive infection control measures were instituted. CRE was not isolated from other patients, the hospital environment or medical equipment at that time. The isolates were resistant to b-lactams (including carbapenems), gentamicin and tobramycin, but susceptible to ciprofloxacin, amikacin and colistin. Phenotypic carbapenemase screening methods yielded positive but often inconsistent and subtle results. PCR confirmed the presence of blaVIM in both isolates, while PFGE demonstrated indistinguishable banding patterns.",

To highlight problems with detection and difficulties with treatment of multi drug resistant Gram negative organisms. Methods: Following hospitalisation for an MI in Egypt, requiring ITU care in The Nile Hospital, the patient was repatriated via air-ambulance to Wythenshawe Hospital for cardiac rehabilitation and subsequently developed an acute abdomen secondary to cholycystitis. Laporotomy and cholecystectomy were carried out and cultures from blood and drain fluid isolated a resistant E. coli. Routine in-house antibiotic susceptibility testing of the isolates was undertaken by VITEK. Resistance was confirmed by the Reference Laboratory who carried out MICs to cephalosporins, carbapenems, aminoglycosides, tigecycline and other agents by agar dilution. Potential carbapenemase activity was examined by a plate assay (Clover Leaf test), followed by enzyme identification by PCR. Results: A pure growth of E. coli with reduced carbapenem susceptibility was isolated. MICs of carbapenems were ertapenem = 8, meropenem = 1 and imipenem = 2. The isolate was clover leaf positive for carbapenemase activity and PCR identified an OXA48. The isolate was pan-b-lactam-resistant due to a CTX-M, seen by the MIC of Cefotaxime potentiated from >256 to 1, whilst ceftazidime fell from 32 to 1. The isolate was sensitive to tigecycline, which the patient received for 10 days resulting in full recovery. A detailed travel history revealed visits to Tunisia, Spain and Portugal but no travel to Greece or Turkey, during the past 5 yrs. Conclusion: OXA48 has not previously been identified in an E. coli in the UK. Detection of this carbapenemase is problematic as resistance to ertapenem may be the only indicator, yet the MIC of ertapenem can be readily raised by impermeability alone, making its use as a single maker uncertain. Dissemination of OXA48 has to date, been geographically and species restricted and not previously associated with E. coli or with travel to Egypt. Tigecycline concentrates well in the gall bladder and should be considered for sensitivity testing in these circumstances; however concerns remain around the achievement of adequate serum levels of the agent in patients with severe sepsis with a single confirmed pathogen.",

The presence of 9 antibiotic resistance genes (msrA, msrB, mphC, ermA, ermB, ermC, ermF, ant-4 , mupA) and 11 virulence factor genes (lukF/lukS-PV, lukE-lukD, lukM, tst-1, eta, etb, hlA, hlB, hlD, hlG, hlgv) were studied by PCR. Results: S. aureus was recovered in 14 of 96 studied samples (14,6%), all of them being methicillin-susceptible (MSSA). A very high diversity of spa-types was detected among our isolates (t084, t002, t209, t012, t021, t216, t136, t3495, t571) , types t084 and t002 being detected in two samples, each one. MLST was performed for isolates with spa-types t571 and t3495, and sequence types ST398 and ST133, respectively, were identified. Isolates were susceptible to most of antibiotic tested with some exceptions: erythromycin-clindamycin (3 isolates, with ermC with/without ermA+mphC), tobramycin and mupirocin (1 isolate with ant(4 ) + mupA genes). All 14 MSSA were negative for lukF/lukS-PV genes encoding Panton-Valentine leucocidin. The lukDE gene was identified in 5 isolates. Interestingly, strain ST133 harboured the lukDE + lukM genes. Five isolates were tst-1 positives (35% of all MSSA).",

Methods: A retrospective study was carried out at King Fahad National Guard Hospital (KFNGH) between 2008 and 2010. Organisms were identified and tested by the automated identification and susceptibility system (MicroScan Walk away 96, Siemens \u00ae ) and the Antibiotic susceptibility testing were confirmed by the Etest (AB Biodisk, Sweden). The procedural details interpretations were as recommended by the Clinical laboratory standards Institute (CLSI). Results: Between 2008-2010, a total of 2552 isolates of Acinetobacter baumannii (A. baumannii) were available for analysis. The organism showed high rates of resistance to Pip-Tazo (81% of isolates), Imipenem (66%), Meropenem (83%), Gentamicin (68%), amikacin (65%), ceftazidime (82%), cefepime (70%), ciprofloxacin (80%) and colistin 19%. Multidrug resistance was observed in (65\u221275%) of Acinetobacter species isolates. Conclusion: Antimicrobial resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii is a major emerging problem particularly in the intensive care unit, Strict infection control measures, judicious prescribing of antibiotics, antibiotic stewardship programs and antibiotic cycling should be adopted to control infections due to these bacteria in patients admitted to intensive care Continuous monitoring of antimicrobial susceptibility and strict adherence to infection prevention guidelines are essential to eliminate major outbreaks in the future.",

Longitudinal analysis showed no increase in tigecycline resistance over the 10-years study period and was not influenced by the presence of CTX-M-and TEM-type enzymes. However for the first time in Portugal it was identified a KPC-3 E. coli resistant to tigecycline and nine K. pneumoniae isolates producing KPC-3 showed reduced activity (33%). MDR and ESBLproducing E. coli had tigecycline MIC 90 3 mg/l and K. pneumoniae isolates had tigecycline MIC 90 2 mg/l. The analysis of tigecycline MICs showed a poor correlation with values obtained and disk zone diameters, 38% of the MIC results are concordant. The discordant data occur mostly in the intermediate/susceptible zones. Conclusion: Tigecycline showed good activity against MDR and ESBL isolates. However, the high frequency of isolates in intermediate category found and the discordant correlation between MICs and inhibition zone diameters, suggest that further selective pressure will lead to an overall reduced susceptibility to tigecycline in Enterobacteria. For instances, the tigecycline resistance found in KPC-3 isolates collected in 2010 may indicate an indiscriminate use of tigecycline. These results indicate that the use of tigecycline in hospital setting should be carefully controlled to avoid the emergence of resistance.",

TLV is approved in the United States (US) and Canada for the treatment of adults with complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI). This drug is also under review for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections in EU and nosocomial pneumonia in the US and EU. Methods: 3 868 S. aureus (SA) and 1 003 coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) were collected from 33 sites in 12 countries, including Turkey and Israel. Isolates were submitted to a central laboratory and identification performed by standard algorithms and Vitek 2. Strains were S tested by CLSI methods (M07-A8, 2009). EUCAST criteria (2010) were applied, when available. Results: SA were from SSSI (41.0%), bacteremia (35.3%), and respiratory tract infections (13.0%), while the majority (68.2%) of CoNS were from bacteremia. TLV (MIC 50/ 90 , 0.12/0.25 mg/L) was 2-fold more potent than daptomycin (DA; MIC 50/ 90 , 0.25/0.5 mg/L) and 4-to 8-fold more active than VA (MIC 50/ 90 , 1/1 mg/L) and linezolid (LZ; MIC 50/ 90 , 1/2 mg/L) against all SA. Similar results were noted for CoNS. 1.6 and 1.0% of SA had higher VA (>1 mg/L; all 2 mg/L) and TE MICs ( activity was observed against CoNS, regardless of country of origin or glycopeptide S. Conclusions: TLV exhibited higher potency (at least 2-fold) than direct comparators (VA, DA and LZ) . SA with decreased S to glycopeptides showed higher TLV MICs, although all strains were inhibited ( 0.5 mg/L) at concentrations below the FDA breakpoint for SA ( 1 mg/L).

The aim of this study is to evaluate the antibiotic resistance of E. coli strains isolated in community-acquired UTIs, and to see the prevalence of extended-spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) producing strains in the community. Methods: 2598 E. coli isolates were collected from outpatients with clinical evidence of community-acquired UTIs during the period January to November 2010 in a hospital in Madrid, Spain. Urine samples were cultured in CLED agar and incubated at 37\u00baC for 48 hours. UTIs were defined as the culture of a single organism from a midstream urine specimen at 105 colony forming units per milliliter. Identification and antibiotic susceptibility tests were made by the routinely used automated system MicroScan (Siemens). Additionally, susceptibility tests were performed by disk diffusion method according to standard procedures. For the study, reduced susceptibility to 8 antibiotics commonly used in UTIs (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, cefuroxime, norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, fosfomycin and nitrofurantoin) was evaluated. In addition, extended-spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) production was examined; a ratio of 8 or greater for the ceftazidime to ceftazidime-clavulanic acid minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and the cefotaxime to cefotaxime-clavulanic acid MICs was considered ESBL-positive.",

Our study showed presence of high level antimicrobial non-susceptibility among environmental isolates in a natural park. The effect of environmental resistant strains on public health should be evaluated. Objectives: Antimicrobial agents are widely used in animal husbandry for treating infectious diseases and ensuring animal welfare and good quality food production. It is well known that antimicrobial usage can select for resistant forms of bacteria and resistant strains can be exchanged between humans, animals and other ecosystems. To the aim of monitoring resistance against selected antimicrobial agents commonly used in sheep producing milk, a survey was carried out on S. aureus strains isolated from milk of animals with mastitis problems in seven years from 87 farms. Methods: 172 strains of Staphylococcus aureus were isolated and collected from milk during 2002-2008 in sicilian livestocks with big problems of ovine mastitis. The isolates in fact were used to prepare autogenous vaccine at the IZS of Sicily. They were tested for antimicrobial susceptibility by disk diffusion test (DDT) against the following agents: ampicillin (AMP 30mcg), amoxicillin+clavulanate (AMC 30mcg), enrofloxacin (ENR 5mcg), eritromycin (ER 15mcg), penicillin (P 10UI), tetracycline (TE 30mcg), vancomycin (VA 30mcg), oxacillin (OX 1mcg), oxytetracycline (OT 30mcg) according to CLSI guidelines. Results: As shown in the table 1, the number of clones resistant to AMP, AMC, P and Te, OT, the antimicrobials commonly used in animal husbandry, increased during 2002 to 2008. The resistance to ER was also found (19\u221220%). A low level of OX resistance was detected, with a decrease from 2002-2005 to 2006-2008 . A double increase in tetracycline resistence is shown and an substantial increase in OT was also observed. The presence of mecA gene was investigated by PCR and resulted in a 10% of positive clones with similar percentages in the 2 considered periods. None of them showed resistance to VA and ENR. Conclusion: The finding of a general increasing trend in antibiotic resistance against the selected drugs implies that the selective pressure has acted in the ecosystem favouring the espansion of resistant clones; for this reason is important the monitoring of drug resistance in food animals and a prudent usage of antibiotics in the veterinary field, to avoid major risk for increase drug resistance in the human population.",

This study describes the trends in BSI pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibility over 9 years at an Australian adult tertiary referral hospital. Methods: Positive blood cultures from 1st January 2001 till 31st December 2009 were reviewed. Duplicate isolates (within 14 days of the primary culture) and patients <20 years of age were excluded. Patients in haematology (including bone marrow transplantation), respiratory (including lung transplant and cystic fibrosis), oncology and burns units were also excluded as they represented heterogeneous populations. Coagulase negative Staphylococci (CNS) were excluded as it was not possible to retrospectively differentiate between true infections and contamination. Results: We found an overall decline in blood culture positivity rate from 9.48 to 4.80 per 1000 admissions. Similarly, the proportion of positive cultures also decreased from 2.6% to 1.5%. Overall, Grampositive pathogens were isolated in 48.9% of patients (S. aureus 24.0%, Enterococcus spp. 7.1%, S. viridans 3.6%) compared to Gram-negative pathogens in 45.5% of patients (E. coli 20.3%, Klebsiella spp. 6.9%, Pseudomonas spp. 3.8%). There was a trend to an increasing proportion of Gram-negative pathogens during these 9 years. However, age specific proportions of Gram-positives and Gram-negatives remained similar, suggesting this relates to overall aging of the hospital population. The proportion of S. aureus isolates that were methicillin-resistant (MRSA) declined from 54.0% to 27.5%. In Gram-negatives, susceptibility to gentamicin and third generation cephalosporins by Enterobacteriaceae remained stable. Ceftazidime resistance also remained stable, suggesting no increase in extended spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) producing organisms. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated important trends in epidemiology of BSI pathogens over time and their impact on choices of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, particularly for the elderly hospital inpatient population. b-lactams, gentamicin and quinolones all remain effective antibiotics for our patient population.",

The model was tested for six main groups of antimicrobials consumed in Europe: penicillins (PEN), b-lactams (BET), tetracyclines (TET), macrolides (MAC), quinolone/fluoroquinolones (Q/F) and sulfonamides/trimethoprim (S/T). The model simulates the release of antimicrobials into the environment by integrating the effects of antimicrobial use, metabolism, degradation, and dilution. Each input variable was unified and assigned a probability density to represent inherent uncertainty and variability in the parameter. The Monte Carlo simulation model resulted in probability distributions of PECs for each antimicrobial group. Using regression analysis, resulting PECs were ranked in relation to resistance potential, chronic and acute toxicity and hazard quotient (HQ) . Results: The model simulated the mean PEC of PEN, BET, TET, MAC, Q/F and S/T (Table 1) . Degradation was the main input influencing PEN PEC, usage was foremost for BET and S/T, while metabolism was the most critical input for TET, MAC and Q/F PECs. Q/F expressed the highest rate of resistance formation potential (57%). BET expressed a moderate HQ (2.02) with all remaining antimicrobials expressing a low HQ.

Has\u00e7elik (Ankara, TR) Objectives: Penicillin resistance concomitant with erythromycin resistance is a risk factor in the mortality of patients with S. mitis and S. oralis bacteremia. The aim of the study was to determine penicillin and macrolide resistance mechanisms in invasive S. mitis and S. oralis bacteremia strains isolated from patients that have haematological malignancies. Methods: S. mitis (n:23) and S. oralis (n:17) isolates from blood cultures of patients (n:40) with haematological malignancies were included in the study. Isolates were identified with BD Phoenix system. Penicillin and erythromycin susceptibilities were performed with E-test. Vancomycin, clindamycin, cefotaxime, levofloxacin and linezolid susceptibilities were determined by broth microdilution. Penicillin and erythromycin resistance genes, pbp1a, pbp2b, pbp2x, ermB and mefA/E were amplified using PCR method. BamHI restriction enzyme was used for discrimination of mefA and mefE. Results: Patient age range was 42\u221284. Twenty of fourty patients were women. Thirty of the patients have diagnosed as myelogeneous (n:22) and lymphoblastic leukaemia (n:8). Fifteen of the patients have died due to solid cancers. Fourteen (35%) and eighteen (45%) strains were resistant to penicillin (MIC 4 mg/L) and erythromycin (MIC 4 mg/L), respectively. Rate of resistance to clindamycin and cefotaxime were 32.5% and 22.5%. All the isolates were susceptible to vancomycin, levofloxacin and linezolid. Five of penicillin resistant isolates carried pbp2b and three carried pbp2x genes. Among erythromycin resistant and intermediate (n:23) isolates,16 exhibited ermB and 7 mefE genotypes. Conclusion: Erythromycin resistance is highly due to ermB and followed by mefE genes and penicillin susceptibility can partially be explained by the presence of pbp2b and pbp2x genes among our isolates. It is important to be aware of high level resistance of penicillin and erythromycin in S. mitis and S. oralis in patients with haematological malignancies as an emerging threat since susceptible empirical antibiotics may not reduce overall mortality.",

Antimicrobial susceptibility testing by broth microdilution methods was based on Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines that were updated annually as revised documents were published. Results and Discussions: 1. UTI; The 'Susceptible' rate for levofloxacin has particularly increased over time (from 41.8% in 1994 to 74.2% in 2010) . Although the cause of this increase is obscure, recent request for strict observance of the dosing period is probably implicated because drug use reviews do not show any decrease of the amount of levofloxacin used nationwide in the field of urology. Amikacin and ceftazidime also showed a gradual increase of the 'Susceptible' rate. The susceptibility for imipenem remained unchanged. The rate of 4 drugs resistant isolate to levofloxacin, ceftazidime, amikacin and imipenem was about 1% until 1998, however increased to 4.6% abruptly in 2000 and then shifted at the level of approximately 4%. 2. RTI; The 'Susceptible' rate to levofloxacin, amikacin, ceftazidime and imipenem has been maintained constantly at a level of approximately 80%, 97%, 88% and 70%, respectively. The rate of 4 drugs resistant isolate to levofloxacin, ceftazidime, amikacin and imipenem was in a moderate increase in comparison with that in UTI. 3. Metallo-b-lactamase; The rate of metallo-b-lactamase producing isolates from UTI and RTI was 8.0% in 2002 , 7.2% in 2004 and 5.6% in 2007 , and 1. 5% in 2002 5% in 1.0% in 2004 5% in and 2.2% in 2007 , respectively.",

Farajnia (Hamadan, Zanjan, Tabriz, IR) Objectives: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a leading cause of nosocomial infections worldwide. The infections can be particularly severe in patients with impaired immune systems. The infections of this agent are frequently difficult to treat because of both the natural resistance of the species and its ability to acquire further resistance mechanisms to multiple groups of antimicrobial agents. Resistance of P. aeruginosa strains to the broad-spectrum cephalosporins may be mediated by the extended-spectrum b-lactamases (ESBLs). The aim of this study was to determination of P. aeruginosa antibacterial resistance patterns and the prevalence of ESBLs producing strains as PER-1 and VEB genes. Methods: In our study, a total of 106 clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa were studied. The isolates were collected from two university hospitals in Hamadan, Iran, during 7 month (2009), to assess the current levels of antimicrobial susceptibility. The susceptibility of the investigate P. aeruginosa isolates to 12 antimicrobial agents was determine by the disc diffusion method on Mueller Hinton agar plates and was interpreted according to the Clinical an Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) recommendation. ESBLs producing strains have detected by combined disk test and the presence of PER-1 and VEB genes by PCR. Results: The antibiotic resistance rates against the broad-spectrum cephalosporins and monobactames were: cefepime 97%, cefotaxime 92.5% ceftazidime 51%, and aztreonam 27%. Ciprofloxacin (91.5%), imipenem (84.9) and meropenem (82.07) were the most effective antipseudomonal agents. The results revealed that 94 (88.7%) of the isolates were multidrug resistant and 60 (58.25%) of the isolates were ESBL positive. Sixteen (26.6%), 9 (15%) and 3 (5%) strains among 60 ESBLproducing strains amplified blaPER-1, blaVEB and blaPER-1/blaVEB respectively. Conclusion: This study highlights needs to establish antimicrobial resistance surveillance networks for P. aeruginosa to determine the appropriate empirical treatment regimen. Bacterial strains resistant to most classes of antibiotics will continue to emerge unless inappropriate uses of drugs are decreasing a continuous education of infection control practices maintained. The high prevalence of multidrug resistance and production of ESBLS in P. aeruginosa isolates in patient confirm that Protocols considering these issues should be considered in hospitals.",

Methods: Invasive SP clinical isolates were collected from children and adults admitted to Ihsan Dogramaci Children's Hospital and Adult Hospital of Hacettepe University. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of all isolates were performed for six antimicrobial agents; penicillin (PEN), ceftriaxone (CRO), levofloxacin (LEV), erythromycin (EM), clindamycin (CD) and vancomycin (VAN) by broth microdilution method according to \"Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute, CLSI\". Serotypes were determined by Quellung reaction with specific antisera for SP. Isolates with MIC 0.125 mg/ml were examined for the PBP genes pbp2b, pbp2x ve pbp1a by PCR. Resistance genotypes of EM resistant isolates (MIC 0.5mg/ml) were determined by a multiplex erm(B)/mef PCR method for SP. RFLP analysis was done to differentiate mefA/E genes. Results: Of the 182 nonduplicated pneumococcal isolates, 59 were obtained from children and 123 from adults. Of these, 32 were cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 150 were blood isolates. In 16 of CSF isolates (50.0%), MICs for PEN were 2 mg/ml. EM resistance (MIC 0.5mg/ml) was found in 23 (12.6%) isolates, of these 11 were resistant to both EM and CD. In EM resistant isolates, 10 (43.5%) had ermB gene, two (8.7%) had mef E gene. In 55 isolates with PEN MIC 0.125 mg/ml, 27 (49.1%) had pbp2x, pbp2x and pbp1a together, four (7.3%) pbp2x and pbp2b, three (5.5%) pbp2b, one pbp2x and pbp2b, one pbp2B and pbp1a and one pbp1a. In all isolates, resistance for LEV was 1% and 0 for CRO and VAN. In the paediatric age group, 17 different serotypes and in the adult group, 23 different serotypes were observed. The most frequent serogroups in both age groups were 6, 3, 23, 9 and 5. Conclusions: Although there was no resistance for PEN among the blood isolates, PEN resistance was high among the CSF isolates. The major serotype associated with PEN resistance in CSF isolates was serotype 23F. Analysis of PBP genes showed predominancy in pbp2B. The predominant mechanism of macrolide resistance is associated with the erm(B) gene with strains showing co-resistance to clindamycin in the majority of cases.",

Fluoroquinolones are potential drugs for treatment. However, there is evidence of increasing resistance to these antimicrobial agents. This resistance may occur due to mutations in a quinolone resistancedetermining region (QRDR) of the gyrA gene. Therefore the goal of this study was to look for the mutations associated with quinolone resistance in Arcobacter isolates. Methods: Forty-four A. butzleri isolates and the reference strain A. butzleri DSM 8739 were used in this study. Arcobacter susceptibility to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin was determined by disc diffusion tests (BD, USA) and E-test \u00ae strips (AB BIODISK, Sweden). As there is not any recommendation about antibiotic resistance of arcobacters, the disc diffusion breakpoints and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) values were determined as recommended by the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI \u00ae ) for campylobacters. All the isolates were subsequently analysed in order to determine the presence of mutations in the QRDR of gyrA gene. For that purpose, a 344-bp fragment of gyrA gene of Arcobacter spp. was amplified using F-QRDR (5 -TGG ATT AAA GCC AGT TCA TAG AAG-3 ) and R2-QRDR (5 -TCA TMG WAT CAT CAT AAT TTG GWA C-3 ) primers. Finally, PCR products were purified and sequenced on both strands by Sistemas Gen\u00f3micos S. L. (Valencia, Spain) . Results: Among the 44 isolates tested, 31 were sensitive and the remaining 13 were considered to be resistant to both antibiotics. A disc diffusion zone of 6 mm and a MIC value 4 mg/mL indicates resistance. The MIC values with respect to ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin ranged from 0.064 to 0.38 mg/mL and 0.094 to 0.5 mg/mL, respectively for the sensitive isolates. The 13 resistant isolates presented MICs ranging from 8 to 32 mg/mL for both antibiotics. The sequencing of the 344-bp PCR product revealed a mutation in position 254 of the gyrA gene in the 13 resistant Arcobacter isolates. This C-254 to T mutation could be the cause of quinolones resistance as this change was absent in all the susceptible isolates.",

Zahraei, R.A. Khavari-Nejad, S.M. Sadat, A. Moshiri, A. Rahimi (Tehran, IR) Objective: High levels of multidrug resistance are normally associated with mobile genetic elements that encode specific resistance genes. Among these genetic elements are the integrons, which are structures that can integrate and express resistance genes. Integrons play an important role in the capture and expression of exogenous genetic material. Methods: Eighty five epidemiologically unrelated clinical isolates of Salmonella.spp were collected from different provinces of Iran through 2008-2009. All isolates were serotyped comprising four serovars (A, B, C, D) and tested for the antimicrobial susceptibility for several antibiotic. All isolates were screened for the presence of class 1 integron using primers specific for intI1 gene. The gene cassettes inserted in the variable region of class 1 integrons were amplified using 5 -CS and 3 -CS primer pairs. The PCR products were extracted from agarose gel and purified with the High Pure PCR Product Purification Kit. According to the size of IVR amplified, one representative band of each group were sequenced and compared with the GenBank sequences using online BLAST software ww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST. Following this analysis, sequences were submitted to the EMBL/GenBank database. Results: Forty isolates (47.05%) which were resistant to at least 4 antimicrobial agents considered as MDR Salmonella serovars. Of the 85 isolates, 58.82% (50 isolates) presented class 1 integrons. 68% (34 cases) of these isolates were multidrug resistance. PCR assays and DNA sequencing of internal variable regions (IVRs) of class 1 integron characterized four gene cassette arrays including dhfr7 (0.8 kb), aadA1 (1kp), blaP1 (1.2 kb),dhfr7-aadA1 (1.6 kb) with eight IVR distribution patterns in MDR isolates. The nucleotide sequences of aadA1 gene, the dhfr7 gene, the blaP1 gene, the dhfr1-aadA1 gene cassette and the aadA1 gene in the class 1 integrons have been deposited in the NCBI GenBank sequence databases under the accession numbers HQ132374,HQ132376,HQ132377,HQ132378, HQ132375 respectively. Conclusion: High frequency of MDR Salmonella serovars demonstrates that antimicrobial selection pressure is widespread in our clinical settings. Detection of class 1 integron carrying gene cassettes which confer resistance to different classes of antibiotics such as aminoglycosides,b-lactams and trimethoprim confirms that integronmediated antimicrobial gene cassettes are common in MDR Salmonella serovars isolated in Iran. With regard to biofilm production of isolates studied, all isolates were positive in different degree of production, except of two isolates.",

Penicillin remains the first line therapy for GAS infections, but in the case of allergy, macrolides are used instead. However, resistance to these antibiotics among GAS population is in rise in many European countries. The distribution of resistance pheno/ genotypes as well as the prevalence of different emm types among macrolide resistant strains varies considerably in different regions and with time. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate phenotypes, genotypes and emm type distribution among macrolide resistant GAS isolates from pharyngitis patients in Serbia. Methods: Fifty one GAS isolates exhibiting macrolide resistance were collected from various regions from Serbia in the period 2008-2009. Phenotypes of erythromycin resistance (M, iMLS and cMLS phenotype) were evaluated by triple disk diffusion test with erythromycin, clindamycin and spiramycin, as previously described. The corresponding resistance genes: mefA, ermA, and ermB were detected using PCR amplification. The emm genotypes were determined by PCR with \"all M\" primers following a previously published protocol by Podbielski and co-workers. Results: Out of 51 GAS isolates, the majority (71%) harbored mef A, 25% had ermA, while, ermB was rarely encountered (4%). All strains with M phenotype had mef A gene. Out of 13 iMLS isolates, all were ermA positive, and one harbored additionally mefA gene. ErmB was present in 2 out of 3 strains with cMLS phenotype. Emm genotyping revealed the presence of 5 different emm types: emm 75 (47%), emm 77 (25%), emm 12 (24%), emm 28 (2%) and emm118 (2%). The relation of emm types and particular resistance mechanisms could be observed: all emm 75 type isolates were mefA positive and all emm 77 isolates were ermA positive. Emm 12 was encountered among isolates harboring mefA as well as in one ermA positive strain and one cMLS strain that harbored none of the tested genes. Erm B positive strains were of emm 28 and emm 118 types. Conclusion: Our data show the predominance of efflux mediated resistance (mefA) and homogenous emm type distribution among macrolide resistant GAS in Serbia. Genotypes associated with resistance were mainly emm 75 and emm 77.",

The aim of this study is to assess the prevalence of PVL toxin co-carriage both in wound and nasal samples. Methods: Susceptibility of C. striatum strains to erythromycin and clindamycin was analyzed by Etest (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden). For spiramycin the disk diffusion method was used. The type of resistance of the C. striatum strains was elucidated by the double disc diffusion test. The gene(s) associated with resistance were isolated by PCR with primers specific for ermX and mef genes. The region surrounding the resistance gene(s) in two representative C. striatum isolates was cloned by inverse PCR using primers designed from the sequence of their ermX alleles. The transferability of the resistance gene(s) from two C. striatum strains to E. coli was assayed by electroporation and conjugation. Results: We analyzed a collection of 74 C. striatum from clinical specimens responsible for cases of wound infections, skin ulcers and pneumonia. 64 C. striatum were resistant to erythromycin, 64 to clindamycin and 62 to spiramycin; 62 were resistant to both erythromycin and clindamycin; 60 isolates were resistant to the three compounds. The gene ermX was detected in 62 of the 64 C. striatum resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin. This gene was also found in one isolate sensitive to the three compounds. Preliminary results indicate that in our C. striatum isolates the gene ermX is chromosomic and does not take part of transposon Tn5432. Conclusion: Our study revealed a high incidence of resistance to two macrolides and clindamycin in C. striatum clinical strains isolated at hospital Marqu\u00e9s de Valdecilla, Santander, Spain.

Gal\u00e1n (Madrid, Santander, ES) Objectives: Unlike TEM and SHV, b-lactam plus b-lactamase inhibitor (BBLIs) resistant variants among CTX-M enzymes have not hitherto been described in the clinical setting. These variants may exist but their phenotypic patterns could be confused with those of IRT or IR-SHV. The objectives of this work were: i) to test if an automatic susceptibility testing system (Wider) and blind expert analysis might identify different CTX-Ms harbouring different laboratory-introduced mutations conferring increased MICs to BBLIs; ii) to compare the efficiency to detect IR-CTX-M enzymes when using CLSI or EUCAST breakpoints. Methods: 14 constructions of hybrid plasmids containing 3 wildtype CTX-M genes and 11 CTX-M laboratory-obtained coding for enzymes resistant to inhibitors were transformed into 4 isogenic E. coli laboratory strains with porin membrane alterations: MKW505 (wild-type), KAEC5 (ompC::Kn), MH621 (ompF::lacZ) and KAECF5 (ompF::lacZ; ompC::Kn). Wild-type CTX-Ms were CTX-M-1, CTX-M-2 and CTX-M-14 and mutated CTX-M belonged to these CTX-Ms but carrying changes (S130G, S237G and K234R) that we previously described conferring increased BBLI MICs. Results: All wild-type CTX-Ms into the four genetic backgrounds were correctly detected by Wider and expert personnel. Those six mutated CTX-Ms carrying S130G were classified by Wider as IRT (with and without overexpression of TEM) or ESBL (2 cases) while expert personnel as IRT (2), overexpression of TEM (1), overexpression of SHV (1) and ESBL (2). Those three mutated CTX-Ms-K234R and two CTX-Ms-S237G mutants were classified as ESBL with Wider and expert personnel. Using current breakpoints, reference CTX-Ms were always identified as ESBL, except KAECF5-CTX-M-1 which was classified as IR phenotype with EUCAST breakpoints. All variants were coincidently identified as IRT in CTX-Ms-S130G and as ESBL in CTX-Ms-K234R and CTX-Ms-S237G when using both CLSI and EUCAST breakpoints. Interestingly, CTX-M-14-K234R and CTX-M-35-S130G were classified as IR-ESBL when using EUCAST but not with CLSI breakpoints. Conclusions: Not a single IR-CTX-M phenotype was detectable either by the automatic system or the blind expert analysis, suggesting that these IR-CTX-M variants could be overlooked in the clinical microbiology setting. When using current breakpoints, EUCAST detected more IR-CTX-M-ESBL phenotypes than CLSI. This result suggests that EUCAST must be considered as reference to detect these IR-CTX-M mutants in the future. -29) . Five of these isolates exhibited a high level resistance to the 3 carbapenems tested (MICs 128 mg/L) whereas 2 strains (producing either IMP-2 or IMP-29) turned out to be moderately resistant to imipenem (MIC of 32 mg/L). No class A or D carbapenemases were found in the collection. Among the 98 remaining strains (93.3%), the decreased susceptibility to imipenem (MIC from 6 to 64 mg/L) was attributed to alteration or loss of porin OprD. In these impermeability mutants, the activity of meropenem and doripenem was generally better than that of imipenem (MICs from 2 to 16 times lower). Conclusion: Seven % of the imipenem non-susceptible P. aeruginosa isolated in French ICUs produce a MBL. This prevalence is lower than in some other European countries. Nevertheless, the epidemic potential of these broad-spectrum b-lactamases should incite ICUs and microbiology laboratories to strengthen surveillance measures to prevent their spread.",

Hascelik (Ankara, TR) Objectives: Detection of plasmid mediated AmpC b-lactamase producing organisms is important to ensure effective therapeutic intervention and optimal infection control. However, detection of these enzymes is a challenge for laboratories since there is no reliable method for the routine detection of plasmid mediated AmpC enzymes. R2357 Are ready-to-eat salads an important vehicle of pathogenic and commensal bacteria resistant to antibiotics? J. Campos, L. Peixe, J. Mour\u00e3o, J. Pires, A. Silva, C. Costa, H. Nunes, N. Pestana, C. Novais, P. Antunes* (Porto, PT) Objectives: The increase demand for fresh fruits and vegetables is causing an expansion of the market share for minimally processed vegetables along with recognized food safety problems. We analyzed the microbiological quality of Portuguese ready-to-eat salads (RTS) and their role in the spread of bacteria carrying antibiotic resistance (ABR) genes. Methods: RTS (n = 50; 7 brands; split or mixed leaves, carrot, cornmeal) were collected in 5 of the main supermarkets (2010). The evaluation of microbiological load and quality followed the international standard methods for counting aerobic mesophilic, coliforms, Enterococcus sp and detection of Salmonella sp or Listeria monocytogenes. Samples were also plated in different culture media with/without AB before and after a pre-enrichment step. ABR was studied by agar diffusion method (CLSI) and ESBL expression by double disk synergy test (DDST). Species were identified by PCR (Gram positive), API ID32GN or 16rRNA (Gram negative). ABR genes, integron types and E. coli phylogenetic groups were searched by PCR and clonality by MLST in specific isolates. Results: A high number of RTS presented poor microbiological quality (86% for aerobic mesophilic, 74%-coliforms, 4%-E. coli), but no pathogens. Different ABR phenotypes and genotypes were seen to both Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria. E. coli detected in 13 samples (n = 26; phylogenetic groups A-7, B1\u221210, B2\u22121, D-8) presented resistance (%) to tetracycline (73; tetA and/or tetB), streptomycin (50; aadA), sulfametoxazole (46; sul1 and/or sul2), trimethoprim (46; dfrA1 or dfrA12), ampicillin (46; blaTEM), nalidixic acid (27), ciprofloxacin (8) or chloramphenicol (4) . Two integron types (dfrA1 + aadA, dfrA12 + aadA) were detected in 11 isolates. Multidrug resistant E. coli (n = 2; D) belonged to the widespread ST69; the fumC alleles of other E. coli were highly diverse and identified as 8, 48, 65 and 100. DDST gave a positive test for 2 Raoultella sp (2 samples) carrying an ESBL identified as SHV2. Among enterococci (n = 108) ABR (%) was seen for tetracyclines (6; tetM and/or tetL), erythromycin (3; ermB), nitrofurantoin (1) or ciprofloxacin (1). Conclusions: The present study positions RTS within the spectrum of ecological niches that may be reservoirs/vehicles for ABR bacteria/ genes with clinical interest (e.g. E. coli-B2 or ST69; ESBL) being these findings worthy of attention as their spread to humans by ingestion cannot be dismissed. Plasmid characterization included determination of size and content (S1-PFGE), and identification of relaxases (rel), rep initiation proteins (rep) and toxin-antitoxin systems (TA) by PCR, sequencing and hybridization. Results: Efc strains studied were classified in 47 PFGE-types and 38 STs which clustered into CC9 (n = 11, 16%), CC2 (n = 10, 15%), CC16 (n = 9, 13%), CC25 (n = 5, 7%) and CC21 (n = 4, 6%). They were highly resistant to erythromycin (72%), tetracycline (59%), streptomycin (47%), gentamicin (37%), ciprofloxacin (35%) and chloramphenicol (18%). All were susceptible to glycopeptides. Plasmid content of Efc isolates was variable (1\u22123/cell; 20-100 kb), those ranging from 40 to 60 kb being predominant. They belong to different plasmid families: i) RCR/thetha (15% reppS86/pAMa1; 21% relpS86/pAMa1); ii) repA_N (62% reppAD1, 10% reppAM373, 62% relpAD1, 32% relpCF10, 10% par) iii) Inc18 (18% repInc18, 22% reppRE25, 19% relpRE25, <5% relpEF1). Modules from small theta replicating plasmids (pCIZ2, pEF418 and pEF1071) were rarely found (<5%). Similar rep and rel content was observed among isolates for each CC. Mosaic plasmids containing rep and/or rel from different families were identified. Conclusions: Most Efc isolates harboured mosaic plasmids associated with the repA_N family. The influence of particular plasmids or plasmid modules in the success of major Efc lineages and in the distribution of antibiotic resistance genes among different clonal lineages of the same or different enterococcal species remains to be established.",

Budak (Krakow, PL) Objectives: The aim of the study was to determine anti-H. pylori activity of a series of 14 xanthone derivatives. They were substituted in different position in xanthone structure i.e. 2, 3, 4 and 6, 2 and 6 or 2 and 7. They possessed among other piperazine, pyridine, aminoalkanol, allyl, methylamine, ethylamine, alkoxy, fenoxy or carbamyl moiety, some of them had also chlorine atom(s) in their structure. Methods: Disc diffusion procedure (Kirby-Bauer method) was used for primary screening of susceptibility H. pylori clinical strain isolated from a patient and ATCC 43504 H. pylori strain to the xanthone derivatives (in concentration 10 mg/ml). In addition compounds giving an inhibition zone ranged from 11mm to 45 mm in diameter were chosen to quantitative assay to establish the lowest concentration that inhibits growth of the H. pylori strain (MIC). Bacterial suspension of H. pylori was adjusted to yeld approximately 1.0\u00d710 8 CFU/ml and plated on Mueller Hinton agar with 5% horse blood and NAD plates (Oxoid). A stock solution (10 mg/ml) of each substance was appropriately diluted in DMSO to obtain the required concentrations of 1mg/ml, 200 mgml, 100 mgml and 50 mgml. Filter paper discs were placed on the inoculated agar surfaces and impregnated with 10 ul of each sample solution. Antibacterial activity was expressed as the mean of inhibition diameters (mm) produced by the substances. The lowest concentration required for growth inhibition of H. pylori strain was regarded as MIC.",

Methods: 93 S. aureus isolates from 913 food samples were investigated for the detection of methicillin resistance using mecA specific PCR, oxacillin agar screen and disk diffusion, penicillin binding protein 2 (PBP2) latex agglutination, b-lactamase production and MIC tests. The MRSA strains were characterized by the antimicrobial susceptibility, production of type A-D staphylococcal enterotoxins (SEs) and toxic shock syndrome toxin1 (TSST1), as well as biotyping and molecular typing based on the x-region of the protein A (spa) and the coagulase (coa) genes. Results: Out of the 93 S. aureus isolates, eight were mecA positive while phenotypic tests showed a discrepancy in comparison with each other. The majority of MRSA isolates were PBP producers and Multi-resistant. All TSST1 producing MRSA were SE producers. Out of the 12 MRSA isolates, eight were belonged to human biotype; three belonged to NHS and one to bovine biotype.

Differently from other countries, we did not find strains belonging to the common CC80/agrIII clone. A new lineage was found (ST1209/agrIII) which also was TSST-1 positive. Further studies should be done to evaluate the circulation and the characteristics of PVL-positive MSSA since it can cause serious infections similarly to its counterpart, PVL-positive MRSA. .7% proved to be GBS positive. 9.5% of the newborns were colonised (ears or throat), and only 0.4% had GBS in the blood. The hypervirulent ST17 clone was detected in 46.2% of GBS+ women and 35.6% of GBS+ newborns. Generally, serotype III was most prevalent (56%), type I was isolated in 18% (mostly from the ears of newborns) and type II in only 7%. The vast majority of the ST17 strains (36/58) were also of type III. The ST17 strains belonged to 4 clearly distinguishable PFGE clones, but were generally closely related to one another. Conclusions: Serotype III was shown to be the most prevalent in neonatal colonisation or asymptomatic carriers also in Hungary. The ST17 clone of GBS identified by multi locus sequence typing (MLST) is recognised as a hypervirulent international clone associated mainly with invasive neonatal infections. ST17 comprised 46.2% of asymptomatic carriers among the pregnant women, and could be transmitted to the newborns at high rates, with a potential of causing severe neonatal infections. These results emphasize the necessity of a regular screening during pregnancy also in Hungary.",

In this study we surveyed the nasal carriage of students of a medical university, who already attend hospital wards, so they can be a potential source of infection. This is the first study of this kind in Hungary. Methods: Eighty-eight S. aureus isolates were collected from the nasal passages of the students attending Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary. The species identity was confirmed by colony morphology, catalase test, Pastorex test (Bio-Rad) and nucA PCR. MRSA strains were screened by mecA PCR. The antibiotic sensitivity was determined by E-test, applying the EUCAST breakpoints. The genetic relatedness of 56 strains was examined by PFGE. Results: Altogether 300 3rd-year students (205 Hungarian and 95 non-Hungarian) were sampled on a voluntary base. The overall S. aureus carriage rate was 29.3%, little higher among the Hungarians (31.7%) than in the non-Hungarian group (24.2%). On one occasion carriage of two unrelated strains was detected. Out of the 88 strains, only 2 carried the mecA gene, but these had oxacillin MICs of only 0.75 and 2 mg/L, respectively. The strains were fully sensitive to gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and vancomycin. There were 9 isolates with high-level (MIC 256 mg/L), and 3 with low-level (MIC = 12\u221232 mg/L) erythromycin resistance. Only 1 isolate was resistant to clindamycin.

The one with the higher MIC (the EUCAST breakpoint is >2 mg/L) was highly resistant also to erythromycin, but the other strain was fully sensitive to all tested drugs. The other isolates were generally very sensitive, which is characteristic in the case of carried pathogens. The strains proved to be genetically more diverse than the usual MRSA populations, with only a few smaller clones, indicating the presence of several independent strains. This, and the dissimilarity of isolates within the same groups, indicate that there is no extensive exchange between the students flora.

Half of them came from small children (<4,5 y), and half from adults (41\u221284 y).

Popov, A. Gintsburg (Moscow, RU) Objectives: Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are now recognized as the aethiological agents of an important range of infections in humans. Most countries have reported an increase in CoNS infections in hospitalized patients that are resistant to methicillin and other antibiotics. Despite of it information of population structure and global epidemiology of Staphylococcus epidermidis and some other CoNS is scare. The goal of investigation was to analyze collection of CoNS from diverse clinical origins using molecular genotyping. Methods: CoNS isolates were recovered from the blood (36), umbilical wound (10), conjunctivitis (33), urine (1), pulmonary tissue (2) in 2009-2010. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by standard methods. Species identification was carried out by amplification and sequencing of tuf gene. S. epidermidis isolates were analyzed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) by protocol, as described by Thomas J.C. et al. (2007) . MLST of Staphylococcus haemolyticus isolates was performed using original primers sets. Structural components of staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec (SCCmec) were tested by PCR additionally. Results: Identification of CoNS at the species level indicated that S. epidermidis was the most common species with 46 isolates, followed by S. haemolyticus (18), Staphylococcus hominis (10), Staphylococcus warneri (7), Staphylococcus pasteuri (1). 69 (84.2%) isolates were methicillin-resistant. Among S. epidermidis isolates 24 ST were discovered, including 5 new. New alleles for 5 analysing genes were discovered two. ST59 was predominated (41.3%. isolates). S. epidermidis isolates carried SCCmec IV, composite variant SCCmec (mecB+, ccr1,+ccr2) or unusual patterns with two mec gene complexes (class A and class B). Among S. haemolyticus isolates 9 St were recovered. Isolates carried modified SCCmec type IV (ccr2+, comlex mec class B 1kbp), or elements SCCmecV (ccr5+). SCCmec in 42.7% isolates were not typable. The predominant SCCmec type found among S. hominis isolates was a new type with ccr1 and class mec typeA. Conclusion: Only 4 species (S. epidermidis, S haemolyticus, S. hominis, S. warneri were prevalent (98.8%) among tested collection of coagulasenegative staphylococci. High level of genetic diversity of S. epidermidis and S. haemolyticus isolates were discovered. Isolates S. epidermidis ST59 were epidemic in neonatal center and aethiological agent of different forms of infectious process. CoNS may serve as reservoir of new types SCCmec. in intensive care units, and 10 (12%) in surgical wards. According to Friedman's criteria, acquisition was classified as nosocomial in 47 (57%), healthcare-associated in 28 (35%), and community in 7 (9%). The Charlson index was 2 in 65%, and 42% had a Pitt score >2. The most frequent source was an intravascular catheter infection (43%). BSI was considered as complicated in 26 patients (33%); 36 patients (44%) met 1 criteria for therapeutic failure; BSI-related mortality was 31% (25 patients). All 100 isolates were studied. There were 14 different antibiotic resistance patterns, with combined resistance to ciprofloxacin, tobramycin and erythromycin being the most prevalent (29%). By broth microdilution, MIC of vancomycin was <1 and 2 mg/ml for 84% and 6% of the isolates, respectively; by E-test, it was 1, 1.5 and 2 mg/ml in 56%, 39% and 5%, respectively. Regarding daptomycin, only 2% of the isolates showed a MIC >1 mg/ml by microdilution although all the isolates showed a MIC 0.5 mg/ml by E-test. Eighty percent of the isolates were grouped into 5 clusters by PFGE (groups A to E) with the following characteristics: A (9 isolates), spa t008, agrI, and SSCmecIV; B (9 isolates), spa t148 and t3092, agrI y SCCmecIV; clusters C, D and E (61 isolates), predominantly spa t067 and t002, agrII, and SSCmecIV. Acquisition, predisposing features, source of BSI, complicated BSI or mortality were similar among the 5 clusters. Conclusion: Isolates of MRSA causing BSI in our area are grouped into 5 clusters, in which SSCmecIV, agrII and spa t067 predominated. We were unable to find significant epidemiological or clinical differences or trends among the clusters. Objectives: Community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) has become a worldwide phenomenon. In this study, we investigated the molecular epidemiology and the antibiotic resistance mechanisms of CA-MRSA selected from clinical specimens according to the CDC criteria. Methods: 34 non-duplicated outpatient isolates were classified as CA-MRSA (July 2009 to July 2010) in our institution. Identification and susceptibility testing was carried out by WIDER \u00ae system and disk diffusion method. All isolates were genotyped by PFGE/SmaI and spa, SCCmec and agr typing. The presence of genes encoding PVL and resistance genes: methicillin (mecA), erythromycin (ER) and clindamycin (CC) (ermA, ermB, ermC and msrA), gentamicin (GM), kanamycin, amikacin and tobramycin (TO) (aac(6 )-Ie-aph(2\")-Ia, ant(4 )-Ia and aph (3 ) The msrA gene was found in isolates with macrolide-streptogramine (MS) resistance phenotype and ermC, ermA or msrA+ermC genes in those with MLSBc or MLSBi resistance phenotypes. Aminoglycoside resistance genes detected were ant(4 )-Ia (61.8%), aac(6 )-Ie-aph(2\")-Ia (2.9%), aph(3 )-III (2.9%) and aac(6 )-Ie-aph(2\")-Ia+aph(3 )-III (5.9%). Five (14.7%) strains were PVL positive. SCCmec type IVc was detected in 27 strains (79.4%), type V in 3 (8.8%) and 4 strains were type I, II, IVa and non-typeable, respectively. The agr type II was identified in 28 strains (82.3%), agr type I in 3 (12%), agr type III in 2 (5.8%) and one strain was non-typeable. The spa-type t067 was the predominant (64.7%) followed by t002 (8.8%). spa type t067 and t002, normally grouped in clonal-complex CC067 and CC5 (sequence-types ST125 and ST228), are responsible for more than half of nosocomial MRSA infections in Spain. Single strains were typed as t008, t019, t024, t116, t127, t314, t548, t1084 and t2220. Conclusion: Five of 34 selected CA-MRSA carried PVL gene and corresponded to spa types classically community-associated: t024 (ST8-USA300), t019 (ST30), t008 (ST8-USA300), t314 (ST121) and t127 (ST1-USA400). The remaining 29 CA-MRSA corresponded to spa types more associated to the hospital environment what suggests the interchange of genetic lineages of MRSA among community and hospital niches. Although Staphylococcus sciuri is only occasionally isolated from humans, less is known about the carriage of this bacterium in humans, especially methicillin-resistant S. sciuri. The aim of the present study was to provide the analysis of carriage of methicillin-resistant S. sciuri in hospitalized patients and healthcare workers (HCWs). Nasal swab were taken from 195 hospitalized and 105 HCWs at the Clinical Center of Serbia in Belgrade. Oxidase positive colonies of staphylococci were further identified as S. sciuri by BD Phoenix Automated Microbiology System. Methicillin resistance was confirmed by PCR for mecA gene. Susceptibility to antibiotics was performed by disk diffusion method in accordance to the CLSI recommendations. Determination of SCCmec types was done by previously described protocol for mec class and ccr type (Kondo et al., 2007) . PFGE was performed as described previously (Bannerman et al., 1995) . Among 195 hospitalized patients and 105 HCWs, 12 (6.1%) and 4 (3.8%) respectively were colonized with methicillin-resistant S. sciuri. All 16 isolates (100%) were resistant or intermediate resistant to two or more antibiotics beside b-lactam antibiotics, i.e. they were multidrug resistant. All tested strains were susceptible to trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, vancomycin, linezolid, and pristinamycin, while 15 (93.8%) were resistant to gentamicin, 15 (93.8%) to kanamycin, 15 (93.8%) to tobramycin, 1 (6.2%) to erythromycin, 1 (6.2%) to clindamycin and the remaining 15 (93.8%) were intermediate resistant to clindamycin, 2 (12.5%) to ciprofloxacin, 1 (6.2%) was resistant to rifampin and 1 (6.2%) was intermediate resistant to rifampin, 1 (6.2%) to tetracycline, 4 (25%) to chloramphenicol, 1 (6.2%) to mupirocin, and 12 (75%) were intermediate resistant to fusidic acid. PFGE analysis revealed 11 pulsotypes within the population of methicillin resistant S. sciuri strains. Isolation of methicillin-resistant S. sciuri of the same PFGE cluster B, and E, from different individuals in different hospitals and different wards indicate successfuly spread of this bacterium. All isolated strains had mec type A and ccr type 3. Carriage of methicillin-resistant S. sciuri among hospitalized patients and HCWs was determined to be surprisingly high, 5%,. Carriage was higher in hospitalized patients, 6.1%, than in HCWs, 3.8%. Isolated methicillin-resistant S. sciuri strains has different genotypic and phenotipyc characteristics. to three drugs and 13 (21.3%) strains were resistant to more than four drugs. All strains of CNS resistant to more than four drugs were positive to gene mec A, and two samples carrying the gene were sensitive to the oxacillin disc diffusion method, revealing heteroresistance.",

There were great similarities between strains of Staphylococcus found and the sensitivity of the drugs tested, when comparing samples found in the same basic health unit, which may indicate the presence of a possible clone of Staphylococcus in several patients. The results also call attention to the high rate of multidrug resistance found in strains isolated these patients with predominance of SCCmec type III which complicates the treatment these infections. The incidence of an orthopedic implantrelated infection is 1.5% to 2.5% for primary knee or hip replacements and 3.2% to 5.6% for revision surgeries. The essential role in development paraprosthetic joint infections (PJI) belongs to Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). This bacteria has entered the spotlight as a globally pervasive drug-resistant pathogen. When dealing with prosthetic joint infections (PJI) there is often a need to start empirical antibiotic therapy. The constant monitoring of resistance chosen pathogen allows in good time to correct the schemes an antibiotic therapy that brings about increasing of its efficiency. The present prospective study was performed to evaluate the frequency of detection S. aureus as etiology factor of PJI and conduct the test of its antibiotic resistance. Methods. We examined the records of 938 isolates is chosen from tissue and fluid samples from 618 patients with PJI from 2007 to 2009. Antibiotic sensitivity S. aureus was tested by agar dilution method. Resalt. S. aureus was the most common pathogen in PJI during these years. The frequency of S. aureus was 42.0%, 38. 8% and 38.1% accordingly for 2007, 2008 and 2009 year. The prevalence of methicillinresistant S. aureus (MRSA) almost did not changed (32.8%, 30.3% and 30.4% for each specified year accordingly). Figure 1 summarizes results of dynamic analysis antibiotic resistance S. aureus in PJI. None of these strains was vancomycin and linezolid resistant. More than 90% isolates were sensitive to fuzidic acid, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, rifampicin and fosfomycin. Resistance rates of S. aureus to the antibacterial agents, respectively, were as follows: less than 20% isolates were resistant to erythromycin, lincomycin, more than 20% to ciprofloxacin, gentamycin, amoxicillin/ clavulanate, The highest resistance rate of S. aureus was detected to to penicillin-G (more than 80% Oncology Unit with some stem cell but no solid organ transplantation. Observing a number of significant infections with Enterobacteriaceae sensitive only to amikacin and carbapenems, we prospectively examined first isolates from 24 patients collected over 8 months in 2009. We were concerned about the risk of cross infection and the frequency of such isolates and whether empirical therapy of febrile patients should be with a carbapenem rather than the more conventional piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime or ciprofloxacin with or without gentamicin.",

PCR was then used to detect the presence of CTX-M groups, and Escherichia coli isolates underwent PCR for phylogrouping. Results: Samples from outpatients, inpatients, and ICU grew 11 Escherichia coli, 9 Klebsiella spp. and 4 Enterobacter cloacae isolates. 33% of the isolates were from urine, 33% from wounds and sputa, 21% from ICU screening swabs and 13% from blood cultures. 11/24 isolates (3 E. coli, 5 Klebsiella spp, 3 E. cloacae) were from patients with contact with ICU. The patients from whom the 24 strains were isolated originated from the Middle East (13), UK (9) and Nigeria (2). The average interval from admission to detecting the first significant isolate was between 0 and 85 (mean 13, median 2 days). PCR showed that 20 of the 24 isolates belonged to CTX-M group 1, potentially CTX-M-15s by inference of the MICs. Care in ICU was a significant risk factor for the finding of CTX-M ESBL producing pathogens (p < 0.05). Phylogrouping of the 11 E. coli strains revealed 2 group A, 6 group B1, 3 pathogenic group D, and no pathogenic B2 strains. Conclusions: MICs, PCR and phylogrouping of the 24 isolates suggest that despite the profile of sensitivity being consistently to only amikacin and carbapenem, that this profile was created by expression of heterogeneous resistance mechanisms, which would preclude concerns about cross infection. Further work to characterise the CTX-M group 1 ESBL cluster and molecular environment of these genes could clarify the resistance mechanisms and origins of these strains. A. Doudoulakakis, A.

Lebessi* (Athens, GR) Objectives: Enterobacter cloacae has emerged as an important nosocomial pathogen in neonatal units. The aim of this study was to investigate a massive colonization of neonates with ESBL producing E. cloacae in a 30-bed, university-affiliated, level II-IV Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at a large pediatric hospital in Athens. Methods: Routine surveillance cultures for the detection of multidrug resistant bacteria at the throat and rectum of the neonates at admission and weekly until discharge is a standard practice in our NICU. Environmental samples are collected during suspected outbreaks. Clinical and environmental samples are processed according to classic microbiologic methods and the susceptibility to antimicrobials are tested according to the CLSI guidelines. ESBLs are detected by phenotypic methods. Molecular typing of isolates is determined by PFGE after digestion of genomic DNA with XbaI. Results: On August 2010 seven neonates were found colonized with ESBL producing E. cloacae as opposed to only 5 neonates found colonized during their NICU stay (NICU-acquired cases), and one neonate colonized upon admission (referred case) during the last 12 months. A nosocomial outbreak due to ESBL(+) E. cloacae was then highly suspected, and a one-day survey was performed on 2/9/2010. Twenty out of 26 neonates were found colonized with ESBL(+) E. cloacae reported. Environmental samples were all found negative.",

            "text": "Three neonates developed bacteremia due to ESBL(+) E. cloacae during the study period, but only one, suffering from serious underlying conditions died. PFGE analysis of 10 epidemic strains plus 4 epidemiologically unrelated E. cloacae isolates proven >85% similarity among the epidemic strains, a fact consistent with nosocomial spread. Strict infection control measures, such as hand hygiene, patient cohorting and shuting down the NICU for new admissions, were established. Continuous surveillance over the next weeks showed a steady decline in the number of colonized neonates, and on 16/11/2010 only 2 out of 18 hospitalized were found colonized. Conclusion: Continuous surveillance was an important tool in early identifying the outbreak, whereas the implementation of proper infection control measures resulted in containment of the outbreak in a short period of time. Objectives: The occurrence of carbapenemase producing Gram-negative bacteria is of high clinical interest as they can hydrolyze most b-lactam agents including carbapenems recognised as antibiotics of choice in ESBL or acquired AmpC producers usually resistant to other antibiotics. The resistance to carbapenems, generally very rare in Klebsiella pneumoniae strains in the Czech Republic, is predominantly caused by an alteration of the cell wall, together with a production of extendedspectrum and/or AmpC b-lactamases. At the end of 2009, the first putative KPC-producing isolates of K. pneumoniae was submitted for confirmation to the National Reference Laboratory for Antibiotics of the National Institute of Public Health in Prague. The isolates were obtained from one patient. Methods: MICs of 24 antibiotics were determined according to EUCAST recommendation. b-lactamases were identified by isoelectric focusing followed by PCR and sequencing of b-lactamase genes. The gene environment of blaKPC-2 was determined by PCR mapping and sequencing of the amplicons. Isolates were compared by PFGE after the restriction with XbaI endonuclease and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Results: The isolates of K. pneumoniae (ST258) were obtained from a wound swab, decubitus and urine from patient formerly hospitalized in a Greek hospital. The carbapenemase was identified as a KPC-2 with a gene located on Tn4401a traspozon variant. The resistance to colistin developed after 20-days long therapy with this drug, but after this single isolation, the KPC-2 producing strain disappeared. Objectives: A marked increase in the prevalence of the serotype 4,5,12:i-, a monophasic variant of S.Typhimurium, has been noted worldwide in recent years. Our goal was to assess clonal relationships and to characterize antibiotic and/or biocide resistance in Portuguese isolates from different sources. Methods: We studied 132 isolates (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) from humans (n = 115), food (n = 9), environment (n = 4) and piggeries (n = 4). The serotype was confirmed by PCR (fljA, fljB, hin and fljA-fljB). Antibiotic susceptibility to 10 antibiotics was tested by disk diffusion method (CLSI). Characterization of antibiotic and biocide resistance genes and class 1 integrons were done by PCR, RFLP and sequencing. Clonality was established by MLST in representative isolates. Results: All but 2 isolates (99%) were resistant to antibiotics of which 94% were multidrug-resistant (MDR, 2\u22128 antibiotics). They expressed resistance to sulfametoxazole (Su, 92%; sul1, sul2 and/or sul3), tetracycline (T, 91%; tetA and/or tetB), streptomycin (S, 88%; aadA and/or strA-strB), ampicillin (A, 67%; blaTEM), chloramphenicol (C, 45%; cmlA1 and/or floR), trimethoprim (Tr, 35%; dfrA12), gentamicin (G, 27%; aac(3)-IV), nalidixic acid (4%) or kanamicin (3%). Three major groups of isolates mostly associated with 3 genotypes could be identified: (i) ASSuT type (n = 48; blaTEM, strA-strB, sul2 and tetB), also carrying the pcoD copper efflux gene and assigned to the ST34 (SLV of ST19); (ii) MDR (3\u22128 antibiotics) type (n = 45), being more frequent the phenotype ACGSSuTTr (n = 27; blaTEM, cmlA1, aac(3)-IV, aadA, sul1-sul2-sul3, tetA and dfrA12;) carrying an unusual class 1 integron with estX-psp-aadA2-cmlA1-aadA1 associated to qacH, IS440 and sul3, and in addition a class 1 integron of 2000 bp (dfrA12-orfX-aadA2) or an empty one with qacEdelta1 and sul1 in the 3 CS, and belonging to the worldwide spread ST19 and DT104/U302 phagetype. (iii) CSSuTTr type (n = 15; cmlA1, aadA, sul3, tetB and dfrA12), carrying a class 1 integron with the dfrA12-orfF-aadA2-cmlA1-aadA1 gene cassettes associated to an unusual 3 sequence region with qacH, IS440 and sul3 and belonging to ST19. Conclusions: This is the first study characterising the S. enterica serotype 4,5,12:i-in isolates from Portugal. The spread of three MDR genotypes belonging to worldwide spread clonal lineages in association with biocide resistance determinants (pcoD, qacEdelta1 and/or qacH) might account for the recent emergence and success of this serotype. Metallo-b-lactamase (MBL)-producing strains are emerging worldwide, with VIM-2 exhibiting particular relevance in Europe. Dispersion of integrons carrying blaVIM-2, clonal spreading and the association of MBL genes with transposons may contribute to the observed dissemination rates. Our aim was to analyze the population structure of blaVIM-2-carrying P. aeruginosa clinical isolates. Methods: From our collection of carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa isolates (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) , derived from five hospitals in North and Centre of Portugal, all blaVIM-2-producing P. aeruginosa isolates were characterized (n = 12). Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by the agar diffusion method and E-test (CLSI). Class 1 integrons were characterized by PCR and sequencing. Clonal relatedness was studied by PFGE (XbaI and SpeI) and MLST (http://pubmlst.org/paeruginosa). Results: All P. aeruginosa isolates showed a multidrug-resistant phenotype including resistance to imipenem (MIC >32 mg/L), aminoglycosides and ciprofloxacin. They carried blaVIM-2 as a gene cassette inserted in 5 different class 1 integrons: In56, In58, In100, In102 (ORF11, aacA4, aacC1, blaVIM-2) and In103 (aacA7, blaVIM-2, aacA4). In58 was the most frequent, found in 8 isolates. blaVIM-2 gene was found to be chromosomal and/or plasmid located. All isolates were clonally unrelated corresponding to 12 PFGE types. On the other hand, 8 different sequence types (STs) were found: ST111 (n = 2), ST175 (n = 1), ST179 (n = 3), ST235 (n = 1), ST253 (n = 2), ST260 (n = 1), ST282 (n = 1), and ST815 (n = 1). No close relationships (single or double locus variants) were observed among these STs. Most blaVIM-2 producing strains were assigned to widespread STs as ST111, ST179 or ST235, which is the founder of the international Clonal Complex 11 containing MBL isolates.",

F. tularensis has been detected in more than 200 animal species, with rabbits, hares, small rodents (e.g. voles, field mice) and semi-aquatic animals etc. Tularemia is a re-emerging disease in our country recently. In here, we evaluated the clinico-epidemiological characteristics of our patients with tularemia. Method: Prospective review of clinical records of patients diagnosed with tularemia admitted to our hospital in Ankara, from January to December 2010. Case definition: Patient with suggestive clinical course and epidemiology (coming from the epizootic area) and positive serology (antibodies to Francisella tularensis >1/160). Results: 22 patients (13males, 9 females) with a mean age of 41 years were included to the study. Nine patients were living in endemic areas of turkey and thirteen patients had travelled to the endemic areas. Among 21 cases, contaminated food or water were the most commonly noted exposures (ten patients were consumed spring water), and one had tick bite exposures Thirteen patient reported being exposed to a rat which lived around patients houses. The clinical symptoms period of patients ranged from 10 to 45 days. The final diagnosis of 20 patients was glandular tularemia, whereas two of them were oculoglandular tularemia. 4 had suppurated lymph nodes. Fourteen of the 22 patients were hospitalized (median duration: 4 days [range: 1\u221227 days]). History of antibiotic use was available for all patients. 18 of patients had been treated with a b-lactam or b-lactam/b-lactamase inhibitors antibiotics those are considered ineffective against tularemia.",

Within the ESBL-producing Enterobacteria we found 996 (90.3%) Escherichia coli, 90 (8.1%) Klebsiella spp. and 12 (1.0%) Proteus spp. Multidrug-resistant isolates increased from 3 in 2000 to 274 in 2009 in both inpatients and the community. Of the 1,240 total patients, 1,188 (95.8%) were adults and 52 (4.2%) were children; 62.4% were women. The antimicrobial resistance rates of ESBL-producing enterobacteria were: nalidixic acid 77.6%, ciprofloxacin 64.8%, cotrimoxazole 60.0%, gentamicin 22.0%, nitrofurantoin 7.8%, fosfomycin 4.2% and amocillinclavulanate 27.6%. No carbapenem resistant strains were found. Conclusions: We observed an increase in the incidence of UTIs through multiresistant pathogens during the study period, both in inpatients and in patients with infections acquired in the community. Among inpatients, the highest incidence corresponded to the Internal Medicine and Geriatric Departments. ESBL-producing Enterobacteria were the most frequently isolated multiresistant organisms. Carbapenems and aminoglycosides could be the best choice for empiric treatement in hospitalized patients. Quinolones and cotrimoxazole should not be recommended due to the high resistance rates observed. R2408 High-throughput DNA sequencing of resistance plasmids: a powerful approach to identify resistance and virulence features L. Villa*, C. Carta, A. Garc\u00eda-Fern\u00e1ndez, D. Fortini, A. Carattoli (Rome, IT) Introduction: High-throughput DNA sequencing of resistance plasmids allows a very quick determination of plasmid content. By this novel approach it is possible to identify the major characteristics of resistance and virulence and to trace the evolution of specific plasmid families, recognizing their basis for virulence, host range, transferability and stability. We sequenced plasmids identified in Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) of nosocomial origin that were i) untypable by PCR-Based Replicon Typing (PBRT); ii) relevant being characteristic of epidemic clones. Materials and Methods: A procedure was devised to simultaneously pyrosequence multiple plasmids by the 454 GS-FLX Titanium, using MID-TAG barcoded primers in large volume emPCR (Roche, Italy). Mobile DNA elements associated with resistance genes, regions implicated in replication and plasmid host ranges, maintenance (toxinantitoxin, plasmid partitioning and exclusion properties) and transfer were annotated.",

Common virulence profiles were established for each UPEC clone rather than for UTIcausing isolates.

False positives obtained for carbapenemase production phenotypic assays were confirmed spectrophotometrically.

Plasmid content and blaCTX-M-15 location were assessed by S1-PFGE. Presence of class 1 integrons, sul (sul1, sul2 and sul3) and qnr (qnrA, qnrB, qnrS) genes was searched as described. Porins (ompK35, ompK36, ompC, ompF, omp35 and omp36) were investigated by PCR and sequencing, and SDS-PAGE. Results: Seven ERT-non-S clones (3 KP, 1 EC, 1 Eas, 1 Eae and 1 Ecl, MIC 4\u2212>32 mgml), mostly producing ESBL/AmpC were detected.

In addition the investigated strains were positive for blaCTX-M-15 and all but one to blaSHV-12 ESBLs. 36 additional isolates showing the same phenotypic pattern were presumed to be related to the epidemic cluster. Conclusion: Before November 2009 at the San Gerardo Hospital no KPC-KP strains has been isolated. During the studied period, 22 clonally related KPC-KP were obtained. Isolates belonged to ST 258 as the first described Italian KPC-KP. This clone is the major responsible of worldwide spreading of these resistance determinants. Molecular analysis demonstrated the presence in all isolates of blaKPC-2, and blaCTX-M-15 and in all but one of blaSHV-12 b-lactamase. The only KPC-KP isolate not clonally related to the outbreak clone, was positive for blaSHV-1 determinant and was obtained from a patient transferred from another Hospital.

Bacterial isolates were identified by Vitek 2 (bioM\u00e9rieux). MICs were determined by E-testing (AB Biodisk). Phenotypic testing was performed using the modified Hodge test, the combined EDTA disk test and boronic acid potentiation disk tests. PCR was used to screen for carbapenemase genes (blaVIM, blaIPM and blaKPC) as well as for ESBL (blaCTX-M, blaTEM, blaSHV) and plasmid-mediated AmpC genes. DNA sequencing was used to identify the MBL type gene. Results: During the study, five premature neonates had bloodstream infection due to carbapenem-non-susceptible E. cloacae. The isolates exhibited variable carbapenem MICs ranging for imipenem from 1\u22124 mg/ml, meropenem 1\u2212 16 mg/ml and ertapenem 0.5\u2212 8 mg/ml. All isolates remained sensitive to tigecycline and colistin, while two were resistant to gentamicin. Phenotypic tests were indicative of MBL production. PCR was used for the verification and identification of the carbapenemase; it confirmed the presence solely of the blaVIM gene in all isolates. DNA sequencing and BLAST search identifying blaVIM-1 gene. Of the 5 neonates, 4 were female and one male, their mean age of gestation was 27.6\u00b12.5 w and their mean weight was 0.974\u00b10.218 kg. Three of the 5 neonates had been exposed to carbapenems during their hospitalization prior to the reported bloodstream infection. Clinical records of these premature neonates were analyzed and the attributable mortality rate was 40%.",

Moreover, multiple hybridisation bands were observed when hybridising the Xba1-PFGE with bla(DHA-1) in all transconjugants. Conclusions: Acquired AmpC b-lactamases has recently been described mobilised by integrative conjugative elements (ICEs). These elements are capable to transfer themselves from chromosome to chromosome via conjugation. As bla(DHA-1) was present on the chromosome of the donor and was transferred to the chromosome of all 25 transconjugants, we hypothesize that an ICE could be involved in the mobilisation the bla(DHA-1) genes in these E. coli isolates. Multi Locus Sequence Typing (MLST) is a method to discriminate microbial isolates through the partial sequencing of selected housekeeping genes. The BioNumerics \u00ae software is widely used for the storage and analysis of MLST sequences.

When a set of distances is given between n samples, a minimum spanning tree connects all samples in such a way that the summed distance of all branches of the tree is minimal. With the principle of maximum parsimony (MP), MST shares the idea that evolution should be explained with as few events as possible. In contrast to MP, a \"classical\" MST does not allow the creation of hypothetical nodes, relying on all states present in the sampled dataset to explain the relationships and evolution. Therefore, MST is only applicable in studies focusing on a very short evolutionary time frame (micro-evolution) and for complete datasets. The MST algorithm presented here allows the creation of hypothetical nodes when the total distance of the tree is reduced by a user-defined number of events. In the context of MLST, hypothetical nodes are usually missing allelic types for which a number of single locus variants (SLVs) are present in the dataset. Introducing hypothetical allelic types has proven to produce more reliable models in non-complete sampled datasets. Additionally, to select the MST that has the most probable evolutionary interpretation among multiple equivalent solutions (degenerate trees), BioNumerics \u00ae has editable priority rules for tie handling adopted from the BURST program (http://www.mlst.net).",

Species identification was performed by Vitek 2 System and by MALDI-TOF. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of isolated bacteria were assayed using Vitek 2 System and Etest. DNA array was used for detection of KPC and, TEM, SHV and CTX-M extended spectrum b-lactamase. The detection of blaVIM-1 gene was done by PCR and sequencing. Results: All Klebsiella spp isolates except one K. oxytoca had the blaVIM-1 gene and all K. pneumoniae had, also, blaSHV gene associated to ESBL production.

Objective: Cefotaxime is a widely used antibiotic in the treatment of neonatal infection. Dosing of b-lactam antibiotics by continuous infusion has been suggested to improve treatment outcome, as compared to intermittent infusion. However, continuous infusion is critical in neonates because of fluid and salt restriction. Glucose 10% is often used as a nutrient supply in neonates and could at the same time serve as a good solvent for cefotaxime. Yet, stability data of cefotaxime in glucose 10% are lacking, restraining pediatricians from continuous infusion of cefotaxime. We investigated the stability of cefotaxime in glucose 10%.",

Cefotaxime levels were measured every sixty minutes for eight hours and after 24 hours using a validated High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) method. All measurements were performed in duplicate. Values estimated for each sample at subsequent time points were calculated as percentages of the initial concentration. Recovery below 90 percent of the initial concentration was defined as significant loss, using worldwide standards. Results: The relative concentration time curve is shown in figure 1. After 24 hours, the cefotaxime concentration declined to 98.1% (SEM 1.65), indicating that cefotaxime is stable for at least 24 hours in glucose 10%. Conclusion: Even after 24 hours, cefotaxime does not decrease to the 90% limit of stability in a concentration of 80 mg/ml when dissolved in glucose 10%. Glucose 10% is a good solvent for cefotaxime allowing continuous infusion with changes of infusion bags only once a day. This facilitates optimal treatment, allows glucose supplementation and reduces nursing staff workload.

Methods: A retrospective study of 20 intensive care patients with a pneumonia associated with MDR P. aeruginosa receiving colistin sulphomethate sodium (Colistineb \u00ae ) between 2007 and 2009 was performed. A strain was considered multidrug-resistant if it was resistant to at least 6 of the following antibiotics: piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftazidime, cefepime, meropenem, aztreonam, ciprofloxacin, and amikacin. The administration mode, predicted mortality based on the SAPS3 score, SOFA score at onset of the colistin treatment, clinical and microbiological response, and mortality during the episode of the infection were analysed. The non parametric Kruskal-Wallis and Fisher's Exact test were used for statistical analysis of respectively the predicted mortality/SOFA score and mortality rate. Results: Six patients received colistin by inhalation only, 5 were treated only parenterally, and 9 by a combination of both administration modes. All patients received concomitant b\u00e8talactam therapy. The mean predicted mortalities were respectively 72%, 68%, and 69% (p = 0.91). SOFA scores at the onset of the treatment were also comparable (p = 0.87). Clinical response was favourable in all patients receiving colistin by inhalation (6/6) and in 40% (2/5) of the patients receiving colistin parenterally (p = 0.06). In the patients with colistin administered both via inhalation and parenterally, clinical response was favourable in 78% of the patients (7/9) (p = 0.27 as compared to the treatment group receiving colistin only parenterally). When all patients with inhalation therapy were compared to the group without inhalation therapy, a favorable clinical response was present in respectively 87% and 40% (p = 0.06). In none of the patients, the Pseudomonas spp. was eradicated from the follow-up cultures. All patients in the parenterally treated group died. None of the patients receiving colistin by inhalation, and 3 of 9 patients of the combination group eventually died (p = 0.002 and p = 0.03 respectively as compared to the group receiving colistin only parenterally). Conclusion: Aerosolized colistin could be beneficial as adjunctive treatment for the management of pneumonia associated with MDR P. aeruginosa. Objectives: Inappropriate use of antimicrobial drugs is associated with increased hospital expenditure, emergence of resistant bacteria and unnecessary side-effects. Concerning this, antibiotic stewardship is among the main concerns of the hospital infection control programmes. A \"surgical antibiotic prophylaxis guide\" was established in our hospital in 2008.

Methods: A retrospective non-interventional review of patients (pts) receiving DAP in 8 UK institutions participating in the European Cubicin \u00ae Outcomes Registry and Experience (EU-CORESM) during the first 2.5 years of the registry. Efficacy was evaluated by the investigator at the end of DAP therapy as cured, improved, failure and non-evaluable. Data were collected on demographics, antibiotic usage, microbiological and clinical outcomes and adverse events from pts treated between January 2006 and August 2009. Patients (pts) were categorised by severity (complicated and uncomplicated) and the anatomical site of the primary infection. All pts included in the registry had received at least one dose of DAP. Results: 51 pts with a mean age of 61 yrs were treated. The majority of pts had significant underlying disease (86%). 55% had left-sided IE. Both sides were involved in 16%, 14% had right-sided and 14% foreign body involvement. Prior antibiotics had been received by 84% pts, with the reason for discontinuation of therapy being loss of susceptibility/ resistance in 46% pts. Cultures were obtained for the primary infection in 94% pts. Staphylococcus aureus was the most frequently isolated organism (31%), followed by and coagulase-negative staphylococci (14%) and Streptococcus spp (8%) Heart valves were replaced in 22% pts, but there was no surgical intervention in the majority of pts (72%). Mean duration of therapy was 21 days and 63% of pts received concomitant antibiotics. DAP 6 mg/kg 24h was the most frequently used dose. Clinical outcomes were success, defined as 'cure plus improved' (73%), failure (4%) and non-evaluable (23%). Adverse events were reported regardless of study drug relationship and were experienced by 29% of pts. The mean time to clinical improvement was 6 days. Therapy was stopped because of an adverse event in 12% pts. Conclusions: Despite the number of prior antibiotic failures and multiple comorbidites in these pts the overall clinical success rate in this UK population was 73%. There is emerging evidence that DAP is being used to treat infections caused by other Gram-positive species that are of increasing importance in IE, particularly where treatment options may be limited. The data from the current series adds to the body of evidence for the efficacy of DAP in left-sided IE. Subjective clinical improvement after NA was described by 12 patients (70.5%) and microbiological eradication of PA was confirmed in 7 patients (41.2%), though there was 1 relapse.

Surveillance of outpatient antibiotic use might contribute to the efforts made for preventing the spread of Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) within regional networks. In the EURSAFETY HEALTH-NET, this issue has been addressed by offering training sessions on MRSA and antibiotic awareness to general practitioners in cooperation with the Association of Statutory Health Insurance Physicians Westphalia-Lippe (KVWL) which represents the German part of the EUREGIO and other regions in North Rhine-Westphalia. Furthermore, in 2006, a possibility for reimbursement of MRSA eradication therapy in outpatients has been created. We present data comparing the use of selected antibiotics in outpatient care of medical doctors in the EUREGIO to those in other KVWL regions. Regional data for outpatient prescription of antibiotics (based on Defined Daily Doses (DDD)) were collected by the KVWL and analyzed for the years 2002 to 2009. In order to compare the prescription of different antibiotics like fluoroquinolones or mupirocin in the EUREGIO to the whole KVWL region, we used the Cochrane Armitage Trend Test. Altogether, a total of 12.2 DDD/day per 1,000 inhabitants (DID) were prescribed in 2002, followed by 12.9 DID, 12.9 DID, 14. 4 DID, 13.8 DID, 14.4 DID, 14.7 DID and 14.8 DID from 2003 to 2009 , respectively. From 2002 to 2009 the percentage of prescriptions of all antibiotics and of fluorochinolones decreased significantly in EUREGIO relating to the whole KVWL region. In contrast, the number of mupirocin prescriptions increased significantly more in EUREGIO than in KVWL region. As desirable, the medical doctors in the EUREGIO region tends to more prudent antibiotic use. The increasing number of mupirocin prescription among outpatients reflects the growing demand and, facilitated by new refunding possibilities, the increasing implementation of MRSA eradication therapy in outpatient care. Regional trends which may reflect effects of interventions can be observed in routine data. Objectives: Chronic brucellosis (CB) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) are characterized by a collection of non-specific symptoms and long-lasting fatigue. Of note, there are no objective clinical and diagnostic findings in both CB and CFS. A low-molecular-mass (37 kDa) isoform of RNAse L has been described in peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) extracts and the ratio of two isoforms of RNAse L (37 kDa/83 kDa) has been proposed as a potential biochemical marker of CFS (Tiev et al., 2003) . To our knowledge, the RNase L has never been analyzed in CB patients. The aim of this study was to determine the ratio of the 37kDa/83KDa isoforms in CB patients and compare the results with healthy wellmatched volunteers.",

Immunoprophylaxy and immunotherapy may be considered as desirable ways for control and treatment of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections. Flagellin is a main virulence factor. There is high homology and cross reaction among flagellin of Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. N-terminal domain of flagellin plays an important role in attachment to TLR5. It also may play an important role in the induction of protective immune responses. This study was aimed to produce rN-terminal flagellin(1\u2212161). In future, its immunological effect would be evaluated on animal and compared with native flagellin. Materials and Methods: The coding sequence of flagellin N-terminal of Pseudomonas aeruginosa 8821M was isolated by PCR and cloned into pET28a vector. E. coli BL21 (DE3) strain was used as an expression host. The recombinant protein was purified by Ni-Sepharose resin. The Objectives: Chlamydophila pneumoniae and Mycoplasma pneumoniae are important and common causes of community-acquired pneumoniae. The highest incidence of C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae infections is among schoolchildren 5 to 14 years old. Symptoms may be mild, nonproductive persistent cough, malaise, and fever, but more severe illness occurs when the lower respiratory tracts is affected, given rise to acute bronchitis and pneumoniae. The agents causing respiratory infections are difficult to distinguish clinically, since many bacterial and viral infection share clinical features, including symptoms. It is therefore important to find a sensitive and effective way to identify these agents and propose the appropriate antibiotic therapy. Currently culture and serological confirmation of the diagnosis of C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae are difficult and time-consuming. Real time PCR, sensitive specific and rapid technology, is an effective alternative. We propose a new real-time PCR based diagnsotic tool for C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae diagnosis. Methods: Nucleic acids were extracted from nasopharyngeal specimens by using easyMag (bioM\u00e9rieux) or MagNA Pure Compact (Roche) extraction systems. Purified nucleic acids were added to the ready-touse Chla/Myco pneumo r-gene\u2122 amplification premix. C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae were distinguished in a duplex single reaction tube. Amplification was performed on ABI7500 Fast, Bio-Rad CFX96 or Roche LC480 platforms. Results: On QCMD European Proficiency Panel 2010, the 12 positive/negative samples were correctly identified with Chla/Myco pneumo r-gene\u2122. All positives were detected, including weak positives (0,049IFU/100 mL for C. pneumoniae and 50CCU/100 mL for M. pneumoniae). Analytical Sensitivity study on C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae samples was performed in respiratory specimens. Specificity study showed no cross reaction with other respiratory bacteria or viruses.",

The rapid detection of pathogens in blood is critical for a favourable outcome of patients with suspected sepsis. Although blood culture (BC) is considered the criterion standard for diagnosis of bloodstream infection, it take three or more days for final pathogen identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. In this observational study, the clinical impact of a commercially available multiplex PCR system in ICU patients with suspected sepsis was been analysed. Methods: Blood samples from patients with presumed sepsis were cultured with the Bactec 9240 system (Becton Dickinson, Heidelberg, Germany) and blood in EDTA from the same patients subjected to analysis with the LightCycler SeptiFast M(grade) Test (LC-SF; Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) at two tertiary care centres. LC-SF test is a multiplex, real-time PCR system allowing detection of 16 pathogens at the species level and four groups of pathogens at the genus level (Gram-positive, Gram-negative and fungal microorganisms). For samples with PCR-detected pathogens, the actual impact on clinical management was determined by chart review. Furthermore a comparison between the time to a positive blood culture result and the LC-SF result was made. Results: From 33 patients, 24 (73%) yielded concordant negative and 7 (21%) concordant positive results. In one patient two more pathogens were detected with molecular method (E. coli in blood cultures vs E. coli/S. maltophilia/C. albicans in LC-SF assay) and one patient was LC-SF positive only (negative blood cultures vs P. aeruginosa in LC-SF assay). LC-SF results were obtained in 7\u221215 h, in contrast to the 24\u221272 h required for blood culture. According to the LC-SF results, initial therapy was inadequate in five patients, and antibiotic treatment was changed.",

Objectives: Implementation of rapid molecular diagnostics in bloodstream infections could significantly improve speed of diagnosis, and thereby outcome. Current molecular tests directly on whole blood samples have suboptimal sensitivity, due to the use of small volumes. Larger volumes show an inhibitory effect of human DNA. The Sepsitest\u2122-assay (Molzym, Germany) incorporates a pre-test enrichment method, which selectively eliminates human cells.

Background and Objectives: Respiratory Infections cause significant morbidity and mortality in both developed and developing countries. Influenza A and B (Flu A&B), RNA viruses of the family Orthomyxoviridae, spreads in regular epidemics resulting in the deaths of more than 250,000 people worldwide annually. Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a negative single-stranded RNA virus of the family Paramyxoviridae. RSV is the major cause of lower respiratory tract infection and hospital visits during infancy and childhood. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) is a negative single-stranded RNA virus of the family Paramyxoviridae, and may be the second most common cause (after RSV) of lower respiratory infection in young children. Utilizing proprietary chemistries and processes, we have developed novel, room temperature stable reagents for use in our AmpliVue Taqman \u00ae -based, multiplexed, rt-PCR assays for the detection of Flu A&B or hMPV/RSV. As an added benefit, the AmpliVue\u2122 assays provide a simplified workflow, significantly reducing the number of end-user manipulations required to perform testing. These attributes allow for more widespread and reliable use of molecular diagnostics in the detection of respiratory viruses. In this report, we describe the initial studies performed with these reagents on both the Applied Biosystems \u00ae 7500 FastDx and the Cepheid \u00ae SmartCycler. Methods and Results: Testing was performed on cultured isolates or clinical specimens to establish initial performance of the assays. RNA was extracted on either a NucliSENS \u00ae easyMag \u00ae or Roche MagNA Pure Compact and 5 ul of each sample was added to reconstituted master mix. Each cultured influenza A and B isolate was detected; 19/19 and 14/14, respectively. Clinical specimens analyzed for the presence of either RSV A, RSV B or hMPV were able to detect 10/10 RSV A, 13/13 RSV B, and 26/26 hMPV. Specificity was 100% for all samples evaluated. Initial analytical sensitivity tests for the various viruses indicated detection limits less than 50 TCID50/ml and/or 10vp/mL for each target. Testing with isolates of other common viruses and bacteria confirmed that these reagents are not cross reactive with other common respiratory pathogens.",

            "text": "The confirmation of CMV infection by the two methods was obtained in 14 patients. One hundred four patients were positive for CMV-IgM and negative for CMV-DNA. Antibodies for HSV, VZV or EBV were also detected in some of them. By performing PCR, 20 extra cases of active infection were diagnosed, for which no antibodies could be detected. This translates to a 15% rise in the number of diagnoses of active CMV infection as compared with serological approach. The CMV-DNA positive patients were 6 children and 28 adults. The major underlying disease was haematological malignancies (14/34). Pneumonitis was the most common clinical presentation (20/34). Overall, the median viral load was 2255 copies/ml (472-58700), while in them with CMV mononucleosis was 583 copies/ml (472-874). The overall mortality rate was 12% and major cause was respiratory failure. Eighteen of the 34 PCR positive patients received ganciclovir. Treatment led to a marked decrease in CMV DNA copy number. The median time interval necessary to obtain a negative result after implementation of treatment by PCR was 27 days. Conclusion: Quantative PCR CMV assay is rapid, and linear for quantifying CMV viral load, and it seems to be useful in the diagnosis and management of affected patients for predicting disease and monitoring response to antiviral therapy and can serve as surrogate markers for antiviral resistance and clinical relapse in these patients. Compared with traditional serologic assays that detect antibodies to CMV, Q-PCR offers a significant advance through the direct detection of viral DNA, which is independent of a functioning humoral immune system. Amplified DNA Assays were designed to be compatible with transport via the Swab Diluent for the BD ProbeTec CT/GC Q x Amplified DNA Assays (Q x Swab Diluent) and BD UVT or Copan UTM-RT collection devices. This study focused on evaluating performance of the HSV assays using simulated specimen comprising 0.5mL BD UVT medium added to a pre-filled Q x Swab Diluent Tube.

Background: HCV genotyping is used to predict the response to antiviral therapy and also to optimize the duration of treatment. The 5-untranslated region (5-UTR) is the region of choice for routine genotyping of HCV. However, due to its high level of conservation, the 5-UTR is limited in its ability to discriminate genotype 6 from genotype 1 and subtypes within genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. The newly developed Versant HCV genotype assay (LiPA) 2.0 (Versant 2.0) uses sequence information from both the 5-UTR and the core region, allowing distinction between HCV genotype 1 and 6 and between subtypes a and b of genotype 1. Previously, Versant HCV genotype assay (LiPA) 1.0 (Versant 1.0) only used sequence information of 5-UTR. In this study, the results of both genotyping assays were evaluated. Methods: A total of 556 HCV-positive samples (EDTA plasma) were genotyped using the Versant 2.0 according to the manufacturer's instructions. For the comparison study, Versant 1.0 was used. HCV RNA was extracted by using the NucliSENS \u00ae easyMAG\u2122 (BioM\u00e8rieux). In each extraction run, positive and negative controls were included. Only interpretable results by both assays were included in the study. Only differences found at the genotype 1 and subtypes 1a and 1b level were taken into account. The Versant 2.0 was considered the reference method. Results: Table 1 gives an overview of the results of the comparison study after testing by both assays. The correlation rate of both tests was 85.8% (477/556). Results from 79 specimens (16.2%) were discordant between the two assays, being the genotype 1a the most difficult to discriminate by the Versant 1.0 (40 samples). Discussion: Versant 2.0 showed an improvement in identifying the correct subtype of genotype 1. This improvement can be attributed to the additional information available from the core region of the HCV genome. As the clinical management of patients infected by genotype 1a and 1b is equal, disagreements among both tests may present epidemiological consequences but at least Versant 1.0 errors do not affect treatment dosage and duration.

Since HPV is one of the major pathogen sexually transmitted worldwide, it will be important to extend the surveillance also to the adolescent males, who could be the next target of the immunization strategy. This study aimed at evaluating the HPV infection prevalence in adolescents both females and males. On purpose, a molecular assay based on urine samples, easy to collect and acceptable for this young individuals, was applied for the detection and genotyping of HPV-DNA. Materials and Methods: 545 urine samples were collected from adolescents (14\u221217 years) attending community clinics, youth centres of the local sanitary units or day clinics in Northern Italy in the period spanning from September 2009 to July 2010. Analysed subjects were 233 females (mean age 15.3 years) and 312 males (mean age 15.4 years). Samples were centrifuged at 3500xg for 20 to obtain the cell pellet. DNA extraction was carried out using a commercial kit (NucliSENS \u00ae miniMAG \u00ae , BioM\u00e9rieux, France) and the amplification of a L1 gene fragment (450bp) was performed by degenerated primers. Genotyping was performed by restriction fragment length polymorphism technique using 3 restriction enzymes (RsaI, HaeIII, DdeI, Recombinant Enzyme, BioLabs Inc, New England). Results: HPV-DNA was detected in 2% (11/545) of analysed samples. In particular, in 3.9% (9/233) and in 0.6% (2/312) of samples collected from female and male adolescents, respectively. Both high and lowrisk genotypes were identified: high-risk HPV-16 (11.1%) and HPV-66 (11.1%), low-risk HPV-70 (33.3%), HPV-6 (22.2%), HPV-11 (22.2%) and HPV-87 (11.1%). Among female adolescents, 8 infections were due to a single genotype and 1 was sustained by HPV-16/HPV-70 coinfection. The two infections found in male subjects were sustained by HPV-70. Conclusions: These data show that HPV infection is present in 14\u221217 years old subjects, more frequently in females than in males. These infections were supported both by high-and/or low-risk genotypes and, among these, 45% (5/11) could now be preventable by the available vaccines that include one or two types found (HPV-6 and HPV-16). Molecular testing on urine sample seems to be a good alternative to those conducted on cervical swab, especially for very young women. Finally, this method seems to be applicable also to the male population. The aim of this study was the evaluation of the often underestimated potential role of herpes viruses in the onset or inauspicious evolution of respiratory pathologies in critical patients. We analyzed 158 bronchoalveolar washes from patients hospitalized with severe acute respiratory pathologies at the intensive care units of some hospitals in Catania, Sicily, Italy.",

Therefore, the introduction of tests for the detection of the above mentioned viruses in diagnostic protocols would favor early diagnosis and correct therapy that could reduce the rate of mortality in critical long-term patients affected by respiratory pathologies who need assisted ventilation. Objectives: Acute children respiratory infections (ACRI) are a common reason for consulting general practitioners. In most cases the aetiology is unknown, yet most result in an antibiotic prescription. The objective was to study the epidemiology of respiratory virus infections and in particular to determine the virus-specific positivity rates and seasonality in pediatric age for respiratory virus infections over a 15 month period in Pordenone (ITALY), using a multiplex real-time PCR assay to detect multiple viruses in the same reaction. Methods: A total of 195 nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from symptomatic pediatric inpatients (average 3 years) between November 2008 and January 2010. Each specimen was split into two aliquots, one aliquot was processed by using multiplex real-time PCR test and the second was tested for adenovirus using a nested PCR. Total nucleic acid was extracted using the BioMerieux easyMAG. Multiplex real-time PCR test was performed using Dia-ResRNAVir-050 (DIAGENODE) for detection of Influenza A virus (IA) and Influenza B virus (IB), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Metapneumovirus (MPV), Rhinovirus (RVs) and Parainfluenza virus (PIV) 1, 2, 3 and 4. Adenovirus was detected by nested PCR (NANOGEN). Results: Of the 195 specimens tested, 158 (81.02%) were positive for at least one respiratory virus including: 64 (32,8%) RSV (A or B), 34 (21,4%) Rhinovirus, 23 (11,8%) Flu A or B, 15 (7.8%) Parainfluenza (1\u22124), 11 (5,6%) Adenovirus and 11/185 (5,9%) Metapneumovirus. Most pediatric patients (86,6%) was pre-school age. All patients RSV and MPV (38,5%) positive were less than 4 years of age. We have seen a dual respiratory virus infection in 11/195 (5,6%) patients and only one triple virus infection. In terms of seasonal distribution, RVs were distributed across the majority of months. RSV peaks were between December 2008 and March 2009. IA infections were distributed from January and February 2009, with another \"atypical\" peak between October and December 2009, including Influenza A/H1N1v. IB showed a peach activity in March and April. PIVs peaked in November 2008 and October 2009. MPV peaked between the end of winter and spring months. Adenovirus infections were distributed in winter and spring months. Conclusion: The molecular assay has increased our understanding of the epidemiology of respiratory viral infections and should assist us in the diagnosing the etiology of respiratory tract infections in individual and in outbreak situation. (3,3%) and the remaining 37 were negative (40.7%). All the samples were negative for H3N2 and influenza B. Overall, 54 out of 91 samples (59,3%) were positive for any of the viruses tested. In addition, two different patients were coinfected by A flu -rhinovirus and enterovirusrhinovirus. These coinfections represented 3,7% of the overall positive samples. The average age and range of the infected patients were as follows: for H1N1, 33 years (SD\u00b120.1) and 0\u221276 years, respectively; for rhinovirus, 28 years (SD\u00b123.7) and 0\u221269 years respectively; and for enterovirus, 25.7 years (SD\u00b122.4) and 0\u221242 years, respectively. Conclusions: Our results showed the involvement of other respiratory viruses in patients with influenza-like illness. Thus, a notable proportion of rhinovirus infection was found in a collection of patients diagnosed with influenza during the peak incidence of H1N1 pandemic. These data would suggest a potential indication for rhinovirus detection in acute respiratory diseases. Regarding age and gender distribution of the infected patients, no significant differences were found for all the viruses tested. Results: Eight (n = 8) of the women were excluded from the study because of the incomplete data and a total of 152 women were used for the final analysis. Forty-five patients (29.6%) were found to be infected with a genital HPV. As expected, viral prevalence was higher among women younger than 30 years of age (15.8%) in comparison to those aged 30 or older (13.8%). The rate of o HPV types were as follows: 16 (37.8%), 18 (8.9%) i other (53.3%). Coinfection with multiple HPV types had one woman. The largest number of positive samples was from Herzegovina-Neretva Canton. Conclusion: Our results indicated that HPV infections represent a significant public health concern in Herzegovina. Detailed knowledge of HPV type circulating patterns in specific local geographical areas is essential for appropriate implementation of screening, prevention, and surveillance campaigns.",

Therefore, this method was used to analyze all clinical samples available. The molecular species identification showed 100% concordance to the conventional culture. However, the molecular method could identify one sample with mixed infection caused by C. albicans and C. glabrata, while the conventional culture identified just C. albicans. Moreover, 3 samples identified as C. parapsilosis by the classical method were molecularly identified as C. orthopsilosis, a species belonging to the C. parapsilosis complex. Conclusions: Organic DNA extraction, PCR assay and sequencing could efficiently identify mixed infections, as well as Candida species that only can be molecularly identified. This test can be easily implemented in routine laboratories providing earlier and low cost species identification when compared to the traditional methods. The organic DNA extraction was 4-fold less expensive than protocols using commercial kits. Objectives: Clostridium difficile infections represent significant burden for health care system with small and large outbreaks constantly being present in hospital environment. Some of the PCR ribotypes were lately associated with outbreaks and with increased mortality and morbidity: 027, 078, 017 and 053. It is therefore important to recognize these ribotypes as rapid as possible. Standard typing method in Europe is culturing of C. difficile from faecal sample and subsequent PCR ribotyping. Here we describe for the first time the modification of PCR ribotyping that can be used for direct detection in stool samples and its use during emergence of PCR ribotype 027 in a single hospital. Methods: For direct PCR ribotyping from stool sample we have modified existing primers described by Bidet et al. (1999) to increase specificity for C. difficile. A total of 50 C. difficile culture positive and 43 negative stool samples from the routine laboratory were then used for validation of the method. DNA was isolated from faecal sample and PCR ribotyping was performed with Bidet and with new primers. Additionally, five stool samples from general hospital, which were detected as \"C. difficile positive, presumptive 027/NAP1\" by Cepheid Xpert C. difficile assay were submitted to the reference laboratory for ribotype 027 confirmations. Results: Direct PCR ribtyping from stool samples was possible in 37 out of 50 C. difficile positive samples using new primers. Other 13 samples were negative (n = 9) or the banding pattern was too weak to be analyzed (n = 4). In 36 out of 37 cases PCR ribotype determined directly from the stool was identical as PCR ribotype of the strain isolated from the same stool sample (sensitivity 0.72\u221236 out of 50 positive samples). All, but one C. difficile culture negative samples were negative on direct PCR ribotyping with modified primers. In contrast, 30 out of 43 C. difficile negative samples reacted with Bidet primers. All five Cepheid Xpert \"C. difficile positive presumptive 027/NAP1\" samples were confirmed as ribotype 027 by direct ribotyping as well as conventional ribotyping of the cultured isolate.",

Objectives: Legionellosis occurs through inhalation of contaminated aerosols expelled by wet cooling systems or hot water distribution systems of healthcare facilities. Despite the prolonged incubation period, culture remains the standard diagnostic method. Alternative methods like antigen detection and molecular techniques are expensive, often unavailable and give no information regarding Legionella pneumophila viability, which can be of minor importance in clinical specimens but of major impact in water samples and therefore in public health security. Considering its high mortality rate and the need of specific treatment, the development of a rapid, sensitive and specific method for L. pneumophila detection is crucial. Also, distinction between viable and non-viable cells in water is warranted. Therefore, we propose a flow cytometry protocol for L. pneumophila detection in clinical and water samples and viability evaluation in the latter. Methods: L. pneumophila, ATCC33155, was used for protocol optimization. Fifty respiratory samples and twenty water samples previously analysed by immunofluorescence were screened by flow cytometry. All samples were stained with a specific antibody MONOFLUO\u2122 Anti-L. pneumophila (BioRad, California) (green-530nm), which reacts with an external membrane protein found in all known L. pneumophila serogroups, and with Propidium iodide (red-FL3) to evaluate bacteria viability in positive water samples, where the analysis was made before and after killing bacteria by heat. Flow cytometry analysis was performed on FACSCalibur Cytometer (BD Biosciences, Sydney). Specificity was studied by mixing L. pneumophila with suspensions of E. coli, S. aureus and C. albicans type ATCC strains, according to the same protocol. Results: L. pneumophila cells displayed an intense green fluorescence, indicating bacteria recognition by specific antibody. Dead cells showed high intensity of fluorescence in both channels, FL1 and FL3. A 100% correlation was achieved between immunofluorescence and flow cytometry assay, in both clinical and water samples. Viability assessment was successful. Conclusion: Flow cytometry proved to be a sensitive and a specific method to detect L. pneumophila and simultaneously to assess its viability. Furthermore, while it has been used in the detection of Legionella in environmental specimens and experimental systems, this is the first time that this technique is applied to detect L. pneumophila in clinical specimens.

Quality improvement is a process by which the components of smear microscopy diagnostic services are analyzed with the aim of looking for ways to permanently remove obstacles to success.

All tests were reasonably specific (92-100%), however the sensitivity showed more variation. IFA was the most sensitive test for both phase 1 and 2, with a sensitivity of 100% if IgG and IgM responses were combined. For phase 2 antibodies the CFA performed well (100%) but the sensitivity for phase 1 was only 61%. The phase 1 IgG ELISA was more sensitive (67%) than phase 1 CFA, while phase 2 IgG and IgM ELISAs were less sensitive than CFA (using the manufacturer's instructions). Discussion: The higher sensitivity of the IFA was supported in the serial dilution, however these observations were based on a limited number of samples and should be refined using a larger set of sera. The IFA appears the method of choice if high sensitivity is required (e.g. early phase of illness). ELISAs can be an alternative or for screening of large sample numbers.",

Neither strain produced pigment in M9 glucose medium. When gluconic acid is added in excess, it increases the pigment in strain A. The brown pigment produced by strain A did not have any inhibitory effect against S. aureus NCTC6571, Ps. aeruginosa NCTC10662, A. baumannii ATCC19606 and E. coli NCTC10418. The glucose dehydrogenase enables both the strains to form 6-phosphogluonate which is free to enter the Entner-Doudouroff pathway hence there is no pigment production seen in both the strains when M9 glucose broth is used.

Virgincar (Reading, UK) Objectives: Prompt empirical antimicrobial treatment, after blood culture is recommended for optimal management of sepsis. Rapid pathogen identification (ID) and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) results permit early streamlining of the empirical antimicrobial treatment to the pathogen-directed treatment with potential healthcare benefits. We compared, using the Vitek 2 automated system, ID and AST of Gram-negative bacilli (GNBs) from positive blood culture by 'direct' inoculation from blood culture broths with the 'indirect' inoculation from pure subcultures to improve the turnaround time of microbiological analysis. Methods: Between May-October 2010, 97 consecutive GNBs from 64 monomicrobial positive blood cultures (33 sets in 2/2 and 31 sets in 1/2 bottles) were included in the study. Vitek 2 GN ID and AST N142 (Enterobacteriaceae) cards were 'directly' inoculated with bacterial suspensions, prepared by differential centrifugation of the positive blood culture broth at 160Xg 5min, to separate blood cells and 650Xg 10min to pellet bacteria. Vitek 2 GNID, AST N142 and N 143 (Non-Enterobacteriaceae) were also 'indirectly' inoculated from overnight subcultures, following manufacturer's instructions. The 'indirect' method results were considered the 'gold standard'. API ID system was used if the GNB was not identified by the Vitek 2. Discrepant AST results were interpreted as: a 'very major error' if the result of the direct method was susceptible (\"S\") and that of the 'Indirect' method was resistant (\"R\"); a major error was the opposite. All other discrepancies were considered minor errors. Objectives: Seasonal variation in rates of infection with certain microorganisms has already been described with a higher incidence rate during the warmest months than the remainder of the year. The aim of the study was to detect seasonal variation, if any, in the recovery rate of different pathogens from the positive blood cultures obtained from patients of our hospital. Methods: All the bloodstream infections reported during the last five years were included in the study. After incubation in a continuously monitoring blood culture system (BACTEC 9050, Becton Dickinson, USA), positive blood-cultures were inoculated onto appropriate plates for standard aerobic and anaerobic cultures and incubated at 37 0 C for 24h and 48h, respectively. A Gram-stained smear was examined under microscope to obtain valuable information about the types of microorganisms present. The isolated pathogens were identified using the automated system VITEK 2 (BioMerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). Spot IF, bioMerieux) for the detection of IgM and IgG antibodies. All serum samples were tested in a 1/40 initial dilution. Intense fluorescence of the Rickettsiae situated in or outside the cells was considered positive reaction. End-point titers were obtained by serial dilution on positive specimens. Sera showing a typical pattern of fluorescence at titers of 1:80 for IgG and/or for IgM antibodies were considered positive. In 64 patients a second serum sample was tested for seroconversion or a fourfold titre increase. Results: Of the total 903 patients, IgM and IgG antibodies to rickettsiae were found in 250 patients. Antibodies to R. conorii were detected in 210 patients (84%), 115 males (54.8%) and 95 females (45.2%). In addition antibodies to R. mooseri were found in 40 patients (16%), 26 males (65%) and 14 females (35%). Difference in prevalence of antibodies to rickettsiae between age groups in men was not significant. However, the highest prevalence of antibodies to rickettsiae was observed in women aged >40 years old. Rickettsial infections are significantly seasonal, with most cases appearing during summer months. Patients from the prefectures of Kavala and Xanthi demonstrated a high prevalence of antibodies to rickettsiae. Conclusions: Data show a wide distribution of R. conorii in Northern Greece and indicate the low frequency of R. mooseri. Men are affected more often than women. Increased incidence of disease occurs during the summer months, especially in Eastern Macedonia and Thrace. Background: Antigen p24 is detected in blood serum at early stages of HIV-infection as a result of virus replication and at later stages of infection, when anti-p24 concentration decreases, and the antigen becomes detectable again. When antibodies to HIV are revealed, antigen p24 is often no longer detectable as a result of formation of a complex between the antigen and antibodies in blood. All existing commercial kits detect only the free p24 antigen, and their sensitivity level unable to determine low concentrations of p24 antigen that is required for early diagnosis of HIV infection. The purpose of the work is the study of diagnostic efficiency of detection of free and bound HIV-1 p24 antigen by the modified kit \"DS-EIA-HIV-Ag-screen\". An increase the sensitivity at antigen HIV-1 p24 detection is achieved by dissociate the immune complex and detecting total antigen p24 HIV-1 in patients' samples. Materials: Method for the dissociation of immune complex and preserving the free HIV p24 antigen was developed. The samples were treated with glycine hydrochloride to dissociate the immune complexes, followed by neutralization with TRIS-hydrochloric acid. Reagents for immune dissociation designed for use with the kit of the \"DS-EIA-HIV-Ag-screen\".",

Results: A total of 170 strains were tested on the Ultraflex III: 94 strains (55%) were identified with a score above 2.00, 37 strains (22%) were identified with a score between 1.70 and 1.99 and for 39 strains (23%) a score below 1.70 was obtained. Finally, an identification was obtained for 77% of the bacterial isolates, avoiding sequencing.

Although infections with C. jejuni are recognized mainly by culture, serodiagnosis is often useful tool in diagnosis of neurological complications and reactive arthritis occurred after intestinal campylobacteriosis. Many various bacterial antigens have been used for the detection of C. jejuni specific antibodies. In this study we evaluated ELISA with four different antigen preparations for serological diagnosis of C. jejuni infections in patients with GBS. Methods: Sera were obtained from six pediatric patients (age range 4\u221216 years old; two males and four females) which met the established clinical criteria for GBS. A few weeks before the development of neurological symptoms all the six patients had a diarrhea episodes. Paired serum specimens were obtained from 2 patients. For control of specificity and sensitivity of different ELISA we used sera from culture-positive C. jejuni patients and from blood donors. The serological tests for C. jejuni were performed using one commercial ELISA (Mikrogen) and three home-made ELISA tests, with whole-cell antigen (Virion/Serion), LPS antigen and whole-cell antigen prepared according to method described by Strid and colleagues. Results: The cut-off limit of serum antibodies in home-made ELISA was set at mean antibody titre determined in the sera of 100 blood donors exceeded by three standard deviations. IgG antibodies, in diagnostically significant level, were presented in 4 patients by all four ELISA tests. We observed significant decrease of IgG antibodies titre in serum samples obtained from two patients in chronic phase of disease. ELISA with LPS antigen and ELISA with whole-cell antigen (Virion/Serion) diagnosed the IgM antibodies in four patients. On the other hand the presence of IgA was diagnosed only in serum samples obtained in the acute phase from two patients by commercial ELISA and ELISA with LPS antigen.",

Therefore, development of a worldwide available, standardized ELISA assay which can be used in serological diagnosis of C. jejuni infections, and its complications such as GBS, is needed. Introduction: Traditionally, clinical samples are manually inoculated and spread onto agar plates by lab technicians using plastic or platinum loops. The most common streaking pattern is the four-quadrant pattern. The aim of this procedure is to isolate discrete colonies for further identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing. KIESTRA Lab Automation (Drachten, The Netherlands) has developed an instrument where the spreading of the samples is performed by beads in an electromagnetic field. The aim of this study was: -to compare the number of discrete colonies obtained by manual spreading with automatic spreading performed by InoqulA \u00ae -to study the variation and reproducibility of discrete colonies created by InoqulA \u00ae Methods: Bacteria from two different species were selected, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 29212 and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922. Inoculums of each species were prepared by suspending the bacteria in Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) to a density of McFarland 0.5 using VITEK \u00ae 2 Densicheck (bioM\u00e9rieux). The suspension of E. faecalis was used undiluted and the suspension of E. coli was diluted 1/10. The final inoculum spread on each plate were 108 and 107 respectively. Agar plates used was a cromogenic agar called UriSelect 4 (BioRad). Five skilled lab technicians were asked to participate in the study and each lab technician inoculated two plates of each bacterial suspension. The same suspensions were used to inoculate the plates with the InoqulA \u00ae . All plates were inoculated with 10 mL using a pipette. For the manual spreading, plastic loops and the four-quadrant pattern, was used. The plates were incubated in ambient air at 35\u00baC for 16 hours before discrete colonies were counted. Results: InoqulA \u00ae produced three times as many discrete colonies of E. coli and five times as many discrete colonies of E. faecalis than the manual method (Table 1) . For both E. faecalis ( fig. 1 ) and E. coli ( fig. 2 ) the amount of discrete colonies isolated by manual spreading varied between different lab technicians. There was also a noticeable variation in number of discrete colonies produced by InoqulA \u00ae . Conclusions: -InoqulA \u00ae produced a greater amount of isolated bacterial colonies than manual streaking. -The number of isolated colonies obtained by manual spreading varies between different lab technicians. -Reproducibility and evaluation of different InoqulA \u00ae streaking pattern needs to be further studied.",

Results: 13 newborns (42%) were with HIE and 18 (58%) with IVH. Patients with IVH was with pre-natal pneumonia in 10 (77%) cases and in 9 (69%) necrotizing coloenteritis. Whereas at patients with HIE an aspiration pneumonia is prevailed (11. 61%). Necrotizing coloenteritis is diagnosed in 4 (22%) cases. PCT level was1.54 ng/ml after hospitalization ( The level of S100B is directly correlate with PCT level (r = 0.51). Subsequent assay was made by 18 patients. PCT was 0.39 (0.192\u22121.1) ng/ml. In 9 cases PCT have normalized after initially levels more than 2 ng/ml level. In other cases decreased of PCT level before treatment was more than 50%. While S100B remained the same 0.347 (0.192-0.438 Every inoculation was performed in triple on blood agar plates and the experiment was repeated four times. For the implementation of the WASP in the routine microbiology laboratory, results of the inoculation of fifty urine samples and fifty MRSA-screening samples by the WASP were compared with results of manual inoculation. For urine samples, 1 mL was planted on blood agar and McConkey agar plates in a four quadrants streaking pattern. Ten mL of the MRSA screening samples (eSwab) was planted on a chromogenic agar and inoculated in TSB salt enrichment medium. After overnight incubation, enrichment broths were planted onto chromogenic agar plates both by WASP and manually.",

Objectives: Anaerobic bacteria remain an important group of human pathogens. Most of them are fastidious microorganisms, and their identification by conventional, biochemical methods is frequently tedious and inaccurate. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry is a fast and reliable technology for microorganism identification, which has been shown useful for microorganisms identification both from culture and from some samples. We have compared the correlation between biochemical identification and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (ME) for anaerobic bacteria identification. Sepsis is caused by a variety of different groups of infectious etiologies. Early and adequate antimicrobial therapies correlate with positive clinical outcomes. In recent years matrix-assisted laser desorption-ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry fingerprinting has become a powerful tool in the microbiological diagnostic. The direct identification of microorganisms from a positive blood culture can shorten the diagnostic significantly enabling an earlier specific therapy. Aim of the study was to compare two different methods of sample preparation for the MALDI-TOF directly from a positive blood culture versus the conventional culture, the current gold standard.",

In the second part of the study MALDI Sepsityper Kit from Bruker Daltonic has been used for the preparation of the bacterial extracts out from 132 positive blood cultures. 75% of Gram-negative bacteria and 60% of Gram-positive bacteria were correctly identified using the separator tubes compared to the cultures on species level. Using the MALDI Sepsityper Kit from Bruker Daltonic 95% of Gram-negative bacteria and 68% of Gram-positive bacteria were correctly identified. The overall identification Biotyper score in both studies was significantly higher for the Gram-negative (Septityper 2,2 and BD 2,0) compared to the Gram-positive bacteria (Septityper 1,8 and BD 1,7). An alteration of the algorithm for the interpretation of the Biotyper score for Gram-positive bacteria increases the rate of identification of the germ about 12\u221218%. The hands-on time is higher for the method using the tubes with separator gels. Thus, both protocols are suitable methods for the analysis of blood stream infection with better results observed with Brukers Daltonic Sepsityper Kit. Objectives: Natriuretic peptides compose a family of peptides that present diuretic and vasoconstrictive properties and are associated with left heart ventricle functions. Especially, the amino ending end of brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) is secreted by heart ventricles due to their dilatation in heart failure. High levels of NT-proBNP are also observed during bacterial infection and sepsis. Procalcitonin (PCT) is a calcitonin propeptide, which levels increase in serious bacterial infection Results: Increased levels of NT-proBNP and CRP were observed in all episodes while increased PCT values were found only in 16 (53%) episodes. The highest levels were observed for NT-proBNP in respiratory truck infections and bacteremias, for PCT in respiratory infections and bacteremias and for CRP in bacteremias and venous catheter infections. Statistically, significant correlation was observed between NT-proBNP and CRP (p < 0.01), while no correlation was observed between NT-proBNP and PCT or between CRP and PCT. No significant correlation was observed between the isolated bacteria and NT-proBNP, PCT or CRP.",

This new Access HIV combo is fully suited for the screening of HIV, in hospitals or private laboratories. with IB indeterminate and negative results were additionally tested in high sensitive EIA for p24 antigen detection. The majority of these samples (57%) were also evaluated for viral load. Cost-effectiveness of analysis included the calculation of the cost of identifying one case of HIV infection. The reliability of differences was determined by Mann-Whitney's criterion. Results: Out of 4271 analyzed sera with IB indeterminate and negative results, antigen p24 was detected in 4,5% and 2,5% respectively. In p24 positive samples, viral load was detected in 98%. More than in 25% of cases, the viral load exceeds the sensitivity level of the used assay (>750000 copies/ml).

Objectives: The EUCAST disk diffusion antimicrobial susceptibility testing method for fastidious organisms is based on the Mueller-Hinton fastidious agar (MH-F). In a pilot study, most anaerobic bacteria did not grow well enough on MH-F to permit antimicrobial susceptibility testing. We decided to investigate whether or not the Brucella Blood Agar supplemented with hemin and vitamin K (BBA), recommended for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of anaerobic bacteria with gradient strips, might also be suited for disk diffusion. Methods: Bacteroides fragilis ATCC 25285 and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron ATCC 29741 were tested with E-test gradient strip (piperacillin/tazobactam, meropenem, metronidazole and clindamycin) on BBA according to the manufacturer's instructions. The corresponding disk (EUCAST disk strength) was included on each plate. Twelve plates were incubated at 37\u00baC in an anaerobe environment (10% CO 2 , 10% H and 80% N 2 ) for 24 hours with each antimicrobial agent on two different days for intra and inter day variability. E-test results were compared with the acceptable ranges for the two strains (reference agar dilution testing, CLSI guideline M11-A7). Twelve plates with disks only were also incubated at 35\u00baC.",

Conclusion: Only a small intra and inter day variability was observed with disk diffusion on BBA with the tested antimicrobial agents. Whether this small variability can be reproduced with clinical isolates and whether resistant isolates can be separated from wild type zone diameter distributions of the Bacteroides fragilis group remains to be investigated.

Bacterial cells were incubated in filtered Muller-Hinton broth until exponential phase and then exposed to 1, 2 and 4 micrograms per milliliter of ciprofloxacin (S-Aldrich) for 0.5, 1 and 2 hours. Several fluorescent dyes were tested in order to obtain the best approach to the subject: Propidium Iodide (S-Aldrich) (FL3-650 nm) a nucleic acid staining, which only penetrates on cells with severe lesion of the membrane i.e. dead cells; Bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid) trimethine oxonol (DiBAC4 (3)) (S-Aldrich) (FL1-530 nm), a lipophilic anion able to diffuse across depolarized membranes; and SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes) (FL1-530 nm) fluorescent dye that binds to double stranded DNA. Flow cytometric analysis was performed after staining with those probes in the dark for 30 minutes. Conventional colony-forming units (CFU) assay was performed from the suspensions analyzed by Flow Cytometry. Results: Propidium Iodide and DiBAC4 (3) were not able to discriminate Susceptible and Resistant strains after the tested incubation time. SYBR Green I was able to clearly discriminate between susceptible strains, presenting a decrease in fluorescence intensity in a drug concentration and time dependent manner only on susceptible strains when compared to the viable non-treated bacterial cells even after 0.5 hour treatment. Correlation between conventional CFU assay and Flow Cytometry was successfully achieved. Conclusion: One hour versus 24\u221248 hours was enough to characterize the susceptibility to ciprofloxacin staining with SYBR Green I. Flow cytometry proved to be an excellent and accurate method representing an alternative approach to evaluate the susceptibility of bacteria to ciprofloxacin.",

Here, we assessed the performance of one such system \u2212 the MicroScan WalkAway system (Siemens) and panel NM36 as a screening tool for the detection of ESBL production by a range of enterobacteriaceae. Objective: EUCAST aims to set European breakpoints for antimicrobial resistance and to streamline methods of antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) to increase the comparability of results from different laboratories. In our laboratory AST was performed by micro-broth dilution on Phoenix\u2122 and disk diffusion (DD) according to CLSI guidelines. At the moment BD Diagnostics discontinued production of certain non-EUCAST panels, we decided to implement EUCAST-guidelines and breakpoints for DD and automatic testing at the same time. This study describes the draw-backs encountered during the implementation of these guidelines in a routine microbiology laboratory. Besides, breakpoints for several antibiotics tested in our lab are lacking in EUCAST-guidelines e.g. temocillin for Enterobacteriaceae, ceftazidime for Acinetobacter and erythromycin for Enterococci. Practical issues encountered included the unavailability of some of the required disks and plates from some companies at the moment of implementation. Also, Phoenix EUCAST-panels do not all fit completely into EUCAST-strategy as some antibiotic ranges do not include the new breakpoints recommended e.g. erythromycin for enterococci and rifampicin for staphylococci. Due to these issues, a complete quality control testing on 20 consecutive days had to be performed using ATCC strains 25922, 27853, 29213, 29212, 49619 and NCTC strain 8468.

Methods: Prospective study of CPBP2a: 333 consecutive staphylococcal strains were tested from primary plates. Evaluation and prospective study of BNSA and BNPBP2a: Evaluation: 17 strains representative of MRSA clones circulating through the world were inoculated into artificial blood cultures (BacT/Alert FA and FN with 10 ml fresh human blood, 100 CFU/vial) and incubated in the BacT/Alert automat. Prospective study: 58 clinical blood culture bottles positive for Gram-positive cocci were included. All immunochromatographic results were compared with phenotypic results (Vitek or Phoenix \u00ae ). Any discrepant result was checked by PCR. Results: Test CPBP2a: 329 tests were interpretable. For SA (MSSA, n = 216; MRSA, n = 30), Se, Sp, PPV and NPV were 90%, 100%, 100% and 98.6%, respectively. For coagulase negative staphylococci (CNS) (MSCNS, n = 23; MRCNS, n = 60), Se, Sp, PPV NPV were 70%, 100%, 100%, 56%. No false positive was observed for SA and for CNS. For MRSA and MRCNS isolates not detected on primary culture, the test was positive for all MRSA and for 14 of 18 MRCNS after subculture. Two out of the 4 remaining MRCNS were detected after induction (around cefoxitin disc) and 2 could not be retested. Tests BNSA and BNPBP2a: Evaluation: for BNSA, 1 out of the 34 blood culture bottles (17 pairs aero/ana) remained negative. For BNPBP2a, all strains were positive for PBP2a. Prospective study: for BNSA, Se, Sp, PPV and NPV were 100%, 93.1%, 87.8%, 100%, respectively. All SA were accurately detected while 4 CNS yielded false positive results. For BNPBP2a, Se, Sp, PPV and NPV were 100% for SA (MSSA, n = 27; MRSA, n = 2) while for CNS Se, Sp, PPV NPV were 75%, 90%, 93.8%, 64.3%, respectively. Conclusion: For SA, CPBP2a presents relevant PPV and NPV, enabling early consideration of the MR directly on primary culture. For CNS, the test has an acceptable PPV but a low NPV and improvement would probably require an optimization of the protocol.",

Objectivity required accepting the fact that infectious diseases and responsibility of them challenge the health system to increase the immunization coverage up to 95%. Material and Methods: During February and July, incl. 2121 cases of measles were registered and 1969 of them were hospitalized in the University Clinic of Infectious Diseases, town of Plovdiv. Laboratory tests were conducted on the standard methodology; virus and serological parameters were investigated in Regional Public Health Institute. The data were statistically processed with SPSS 14 analysis system, using parametric methods in Gaussian distribution and nonparametric when needed. As a significant difference interval was accepted p < 0.05, guaranteeing 95% confidence. Results and Discussion: The highest incidence of measles was repotted during April and May, 34.3% of hospitalized patients. Mainly mediumheavy forms of disease were observed. 65% of treated were children between 1 to 18 years. Measles complicated with pneumonia was found in 504 patients \u2212 25.6%. Pronounced respiratory failure and need of oxygen therapy had 59 fellows. Antibiotics received all complicated cases. X-Ray control was achieved in 74.3% of lung-affected. We observed complications of the nervous system in 7 patients, aged 8 months to 52 years. Measles, complicated with meningitis \u2212 two cases, viral encephalitis \u2212 4 and one 8 years old boy with meningomyelitis. Conclusion: Outbreak of measles in Plovdiv and the region in 2010 once again put reasonable challenges of organizational, financial, legal and social-legal aspect to epidemiologists and infectious diseases in particular and the healthcare system in the country as a whole.

The index isolate was from a 46 year old, previously healthy male, who had a fecal specimen taken under intensive care for haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) on April 13 in Graz. The second isolate was from a 46 year old Tyrolean patient (specimen received on April 28); this patient suffered from discharge of slime and bowel irregularities, following watery diarrhea. The patient attended a book fair in Graz 5 days before onset of illness in Innsbruck. He and two working colleagues consumed appetizers (bred with various handmade spreads) at some of the exhibition booths. The two colleagues fell ill with diarrhea (one in Innsbruck, one in Munich, Germany) but had not stool specimens tested. Another stool isolate (June 10) was from a 66 year old male treated for HUS in Vienna. A fourth isolate was from this latter patient's wife (age 63), who developed bloody diarrhea three days after her husbands discharge from hospital. A fifth stool isolate was from a 92 year old patient with diarrhea from Graz (specimen received May 12). All five isolates were sorbitol-fermenting, positive for stx1, stx2 and hlyA, but negative for eae. Analyses by PFGE using XbaI as restriction enzyme yielded patterns indistinguishable from each other, but clearly different from five other STEC O174:H2 provided by the German National Consulting Laboratory on HUS and 48 disease associated Austrian STEC isolates from 2010. Conclusion: Our report emphasizes that stool samples from patients with HUS must be tested by other techniques than sole use of Sorbitol-MacConkey media. Direct person-to-person transmission underlines the importance of instructing family members about the need for post-defecatory handwashing. For five of the six remaining patients, consumption of an unidentified contaminated handmade spread produced and distributed in the Graz area is the likely source of infection. The adherence ability, siderophores, amylase and caseinase were better expressed at 37\u00baC. At 0% NaCl only amylase and siderophores, at 2% and 3% NaCl the amylase was better expressed and at 6% NaCl, siderophores and caseinase showed the best expression, thereafter, the VF expression gradually decreasing till 10% NaCl. The adherence to HeLa cells was decreased by higher salinities. The tested strains proved high resistance to a broad range of pH from 5 to 9.6. The amylase and caseinase were better expressed at pH 9.6 and siderophores at pH 7. The higher glucose concentrations (3%) inhibited the expression of amylase and caseinase. The incubation conditions exhibited no influence on the VF expression. The molecular detection of VF genes evidenced the Ecp/dA in 82% and EchelD in 85% of the tested strains. The densitometric analysis of the electrophoretic bands obtained in multiplex PCR showed different intensities, suggesting that, in a number of cases, the lipase or DN-ase genes could be lost in a great percent in the bacterial population. Conclusion: Our results proved the high adaptation ability of aquatic enterobacterial strains to different stress conditions and the expression of virulence determinants even in limiting environmental conditions, demonstrating the role of these parameters in the preservation of the virulence gene pool in water.",

In most laboratories however, onesample testing is performed for reasons of cost efficiency. To further improve one-sample testing, we assessed the laboratory performance of three different testing approaches to find the most sensitive onesample test procedure: SVS versus FCU versus a combined specimen of FCU/SVS. Methods: All women visiting a STD clinic above the age of 16 were asked to participate in the study. Each client was asked to take a FCU and a SVS with a dual swab. The FCU, SVS and FCU/SVS combination were tested for CT by Strand Displacement Amplification assay (SDA) of Becton Dickinson (ProbeTec ET system, Maryland, USA) or Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) by Roche Diagnostics Inc. (Cobas Amplicor system, California, USA). Clients with at least one out of three sample types (SVS, FCU, SVS/FCU combination) tested positive for CT by NAAT, were regarded as CT positive (comparison standard). Results: In total 791 females were included and CT prevalence was 12% (96/791). The CT detection rate for SVS, FCU and SVS/FCU combination were 94%, 90% and 94%, respectively, if results of NAAT by SDA and by PCR were analyzed together. The detection rate was not significantly different between any of the sample types, when tested solely. Discordance in NAAT results within the different sample types was found in 16 out of 96 CT positive results. Conclusion: Our results show that the detection rate of SVS/FCU combination is equal to that of FCU or SVS alone. SVS is an acceptable and feasible specimen for females. Moreover, SVS is the most costeffective sample type for a STD clinic population We can therefore conclude that SVS is the specimen of choice to detect CT in females. Results: Ten patients (8 men, 2 women) were included with matched controls. The mean age was 49.8 (24\u221277) years. IE (9/10) was the most common distant site infection, one patient developed spondylitis. All patients had some predisposing condition for distant site infection: mitral valve insufficiency (5/10), bicuspid aortic valve (3/10), atrioventricular septal defect (1/10) and discus protrusion (1/10). Five patients had had a preceding dental procedure, which in most cases was removal of dental plaque and calculus (4/10). None of the patients received antibiotic prophylaxis preoperatively. All ten patients had active oral infection foci, most often untreated periodontitis (5/10), likely to cause spontaneous bacteraemia. Patients reported more childhood infections than the controls (p = 0.01). WBC counts (10(3)/mL) on admission were median 8.0 (4.5-10.6) and at maximum 9.9 (5.5-33.6). LOS was 27 days in median (9\u221275). Conclusion: Patients with predisposing medical conditions seem to be more susceptible for distant site infections caused by S. mutans. The major predisposing factor in our study material was cardiac structural abnormality. All these patients subsequently developed IE as a distant site infection. The results highlight the importance of oral health in patients with cardiac abnormalities and support the use of antibiotic prophylaxis during dental care of oral infection foci in these patients, especially if colonised with S. mutans. Background: Antibiotic resistance is a term that is frequently used by clinicians in their discussions with patients. However, patients and clinicians may not share the same assumptions about the meaning of this term. Objective: We aimed to explore patients' interpretations of the term 'antibiotic resistance' and to consider the implications for strategies to reduce the overuse of antibiotics. Design: Qualitative interview study. Participants: 121 adult patients from nine European cities who had recently consulted a primary care clinician with symptoms of Lower Respiratory Tract Infection (LRTI).

Material and Methods: Hospital records, between 2003 and 2009, of about 430 patients with brucellosis were followed and retrospectively reviewed in our clinic. Results: Out of 430 patients, 19 (4.4%) had neurobrucellosis. These patients were classified into four groups: Meningitis group (n = 14; 13 cases of subacute-chronic meningitis and one case of acute meningitis), Encephalomyelitis group (n = 3; one case of meningoencephalomyelitis, one case of cerebellar abscess, and one case of transverse myelitis), Polyradicular group (n = 1; one case of Miller Fisher Syndrome), and others (n = 1; one case of intradural abscess). Ten patients (52.6%) were female, and nine patients (47.4%) were male and the mean age of the patients was 48.8 years. About 47.4% of the patients had fever, 26% of the patients had neck stiffness, and 5% of the patients were in an unconscious state. Out of 19 patients, 18 underwent lumbar puncture (LP). According to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analyses, the mean leukocyte count was 113/mm3, the mean glucose level was 45 mg/dl, and the mean protein level was 123 mg/dl. Standard tube agglutination test showed brucellosis in all patients who underwent LP. Microorganisms were detected in four patient's blood culture and one patient's CSF culture. There were cranial nerve involvements in five cases. The most frequent was the sixth cranial nerve involvement. Out of 19 patients, 3 recovered with sequels (paraparesis, hearing loss, dementia, and sphincter dysfunction) and 16 patients recovered completely. Conclusion: Although neurobrucellosis is most frequently accompanied by subacute-chronic meningitis, it may have many different clinical pictures. The classical triad of meningitis (fever, neck stiffness, and unconscious state) is rarely seen in brucellosis-related meningitis. Brucellosis should be kept in mind in patients with unexplained neurological findings in regions where brucellosis is endemic. In addition, a classification of brucellosis, which reflects locations of nervous system involvement, clinical picture, and pathogenesis, is needed.",

This study was carried out in order to evaluate colonization of the oral cavity with Candida species and oral candidiasis in the institutionalized and non-institutionalized elderly. Methods: A total of 341 elderly were included, 280 institutionalized elderly in nursing home (134 males, 146 females, mean age 72.68\u00b18.43) and 61 non-institutionalized elderly (23 males, 38 females, mean age 70.39\u00b16.16). Specimens were isolated from oral cavity with sterile swabs (Copan, Zagreb, Croatia) from the surface of oral mucosa and were inoculated on a isolation medium, Sabouraud's dextrose agar. Cultures were incubated at 37\u00baC for 48 hours. In cases of no growth, the plates were considered negative and discarded. The count of colony-forming units was recorded. Oral cavity is considered colonized with Candida spp. in the case of positive microbiological analysis and normal oral mucosal appearance. The diagnosis of oral candidiasis was established by taking account of the clinical appearance (pseudomembranous candidiasis, erythematous candidiasis, denture-related stomatitis or candida-associated lesions) and positive microbiological analysis.

Methods: Over a period of 12 months (November 2008-October 2009) a total number of 180 water samples were examined for the presence of Y. enterocolitica. The water samples were collected from the area of Epirus (Northwestern Greece) and included: 60 samples of drinking water, 60 samples of lake water and 60 samples of marine water. The drinking water samples were tap-water collected from houses from three different municipalities of the area, the lake water samples were collected from two lakes (Pamvotis and Voulkaria) representing two different ecosystems (polluted/urban and rural/unpolluted) both used for recreational activities and the marine water samples were collected from five different point sources of Ionian Sea, including areas of recreational activities. The APHA/AWWA, Standard Methods for the examination of water and waste water were employed for the detection of Y. enterocolitica and other bacterial indicators (total microbial flora, coliforms, fecal coliforms, enterococci). Results: Y. enterocolitica was isolated from two samples of marine water and two samples of lake water. The positive samples were isolated from the most polluted aquatic environments (the urban lake and the Amvrakikos Golf). The isolation of Y. enterocolitica coincided with increased numbers of total coliforms ( 2500 cfu/ml) and enterococci ( 2000 cfu/ml). No Y. enterocolitica strains were isolated from the drinking water samples. Conclusion: The findings of the present survey underline the presence of Y. enterocolitica in marine and lake water as an indicator of microbiological pollution and a potential threat for public health if the contaminated aquatic environment is used for recreational activities. Also, the absence of Y. enterocolitica in the drinking water samples of the examined area proves the efficacy of the chlorination practices.",

Campylobacter infection is generally foodborne disease. Objectives: The aim of this report is the study of Campylobacter cases recorded during the decade 2001-2010, as well as the susceptibility of Campylobacter isolates to antibiotics. Also the frequency of the disease according to age, sex and season was estimated. Methods: A total of 898 Campylobacter strains were isolated from patients with acute gastroenteritis hospitalized in the Infectious Diseases Hospital of Thessaloniki. The selective Skirrow medium was used. Skirrow medium is blood agar infused with antibiotics: vancomycin, polymixin-B and trimethoprim. The incubation was under microaerophilic conditions at 37\u00baC and 42\u00baC. Following isolation on selective media, identification was carried out using the biochemical profile of each Campylobacter strain. Furthermore, Campylobacter strains were tested for susceptibility to antibiotics (ampicillin, gentamicin, tobramycin, cephalothin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, cotrimoxazole, erythromycin) using the Kirby-Bauer method. Results: Of the 898 strains, 846 (94.2%) were C. jejuni and 52 (5,8%) C. coli. From the total strains, 521 (58%) were isolated from males and 377 (42%) from females. Furthermore, 704 strains (78,4%) were isolated from children (47.4% under the age of 2 years) and 194 (21.6%) from adults. In addition, leucocytes were found in 34.4% of the stool specimens. The peak of Campylobacter infection in the study was in the spring months (31.4%) and in the summer months (28. 5% ). An increase in fluoroquinolones and co-trimoxazole resistance (nalidixic acid 23.9%, ciprofloxacin 12% and cotrimoxazole 47.7% respectively) among Campylobacter isolates has been observed. Erythromycin (macrolides) is considered the drug of choice with low resistance. Conclusions: Campylobacter is a major cause of bacterial enteritis, following Salmonella in Northern Greece. Most frequently isolated was C. jejuni. Age specific infection rate was highest in children less than two years old. Campylobacteriosis occurs much more frequently in the spring and summer months. Erythromycin is still an effective antibiotic for the therapy of Campylobacter infection.",

This study was done to determine whether C. pneumoniae seropositivity is associated with increase in intima media thickness (IMT) of the carotid artery, hs-C reactive protein (CRP) and oxidant stress in subjects with hypercholesterolaemia. Methods: Fifty-two hypercholesterolaemic subjects were recruited during health screening programmes organized by our institution. Subject inclusion criteria include baseline LDL-c of 3.4 mmol/l. Subjects with diabetes, hypertension, severe obesity, smoking, primary hypercholesterolemia and presence of acute inflammation (C-reactive protein 10 units) were excluded. IgG and IgA to C. pneumoniae were measured by microimmunofluoresence test. IgG titre 64 and IgA 16 were considered to be seropositive. IMT of the far wall of carotid artery was measured by B-mode ultrasound. hs-CRP was measured by immunoturbidimetric method using an automated analyser. Isoprostanes (an oxidative stress marker) was quantified by liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. Results: Seropositivity for C. pneumoniae was detected in 40.4% of the hypercholesterolaemic subjects. There was no significant difference in the IMT in the hypercholesterolaemic subjects who were C. pneumoniae seropositive compared to the C. pneumoniae seronegative subjects (Mean IMT\u00b1SD mm: 0.6\u00b10.7mm vs. 0.6\u00b10.6 mm, p > 0.05). hs-CRP did not show a statistically significant difference between C. pneumoniae seropositives and seronegatives individuals (Mean hs-CRP + SD mg/dl; 1.56\u00b10.29 vs 1.85\u00b10.35; p > 0.05). By contrast, a significant difference was observed when comparing isoprostane, a marker for oxidative stress by serostatus to C. pneumoniae (Mean + SD pg/ml; 46.2\u00b130.6 vs 37.7\u00b120.4; p < 0.05). Conclusion: Our data demonstrates that seropositivity to C. pneumoniae increases the oxidative stress but it is not associated with increase in carotid IMT or in hs-CRP in subjects with hypercholesterolaemia in the absence of other conventional cardiovascular risk factors.",

Classical differentiation of suspected isolates is done by biochemical tests, which are time consuming and may often give unclear results. Recently, matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry (MS) was shown to allow identification of isolated microorganisms within 15 minutes and is therefore a fast alternative for species differentiation. Methods: We used matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization timeof-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) in comparison with classical microbiological (API Coryne) and molecular methods (rpoB sequencing) on 116 Corynebacterium strains. Results: All 90 potentially toxigenic Corynebacterium spp. strains collected by the German National Consiliary Laboratory on Diphtheria in a period of more than ten years were correctly identified by MALDI-TOF MS. In 103/116 strains (88.8%) biochemical identification by API Coryne yielded identical results as rpoB gene sequencing. Twelve strains showing unreliable or ambiguous API results were concordantly identified by rpoB sequencing and MALDI-TOF MS except for one isolate of C. tuberculostearicum. In conclusion, 99.1% of the tested Corynebacteria were correctly identified by MALDI-TOF MS when compared to rpoB gene sequencing. Moreover, both the positive and negative predictive values for identification of potentially toxigenic Corynebacterium species were 100% with MALDI-TOF, respectively. Conclusion: In conclusion, species identification of potentially toxigenic Corynebacterium spp. can be accomplished by MALDI-TOF MS within 15 min. when applied to suspicious colonies. In this scenario, MALDI-TOF MS technology might be used as a rapid screening method helping to decide whether suspicious colonies should be analyzed for the presence of tox by real time PCR. We propose an algorithm for fast and reliable diagnosis of diphtheria incorporating MALDI-TOF MS, real-time tox PCR and Elek testing.",

Portugal's legal therapeutic abortion, before 10 weeks of gestation, was approved in 2007. We report a case of a young patient who underwent a medical induced abortion and died of a C. sordellii toxic shock syndrome. Case summary: A 16-year-old women who underwent a medically induced abortion by means of 200 mg of oral mifepristone followed by 800 mg of vaginal misoprostol, presented to the maternity hospital's emergency five days after receiving mifepristone, complaining of lipothimia in the night before and abdominal cramping. On admission, she was conscient, afebrile and hypotense (76/35mmHg). A few hours later she developed a rapid onset-sepsis with marked leukocitosis (83,400 white-cells/mL with 88% of neutrophils), hemoconcentration (hematocrit of 63.4%; hemoglobin of 21.2) and severe metabolic acidosis. The patient underwent a hysterectomy and uterus biopsy cultures and anatomopathological analysis were requested. Patient was transferred to intensive care unit and died 18h after presenting to emergency. At the microbiology laboratory a direct examination by Gram-stain smear of the uterine biopsy showed large, Gram positive rods. The biopsy was inoculated in appropriated agar plates mediums and incubated aerobically and anaerobically. 48 h later only the anaerobic culture was positive and colonies were smeared by Gram stain (showing Gram positive rods) and a C. sordellii was identified by the semi-automated system, Vitek 2 (bioMerieux \u00ae ) with an ANC card (Anaerobes and Corynebacterium card). Discussion: This was a fatal case of pos-abortion C. sordellii sepsis. The distinctive clinical features developed are the same reported in other studies. Gram staining of a uterine biopsy is a good and rapid mean of having a presumptive result and help to diagnose. C. sordellii was identified through uterine biopsy cultures with a semi-automated system which is different from other studies that used anti-clostridium species immunochemical assay and PCR assays performed on formalin fixed uterine tissue pos-autopsy. Conclusion: To improve diagnosis Gram staining and cultures of an endometrial biopsy specimen are a good approach to an earlier recognition of the disease's etiology.",

Micro-agglutination test was positive in four patients (80%) with titres of 1/640 in three patients (60%) and 1/160 in one patient (20%). The patients were treated with a streptomycin and doxycycline or a ciprofloxacin and doxycycline combination for a 2 weeks period due to a delay in initiation of treatment. One patient was received a second coures of antibiotics because of insufficient response to first therapy and continuing suppurative lymphadenitis. No severe complication was observed. Conclusion: Tularemia should be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of patients with fever, pharyngitis or tonsillitis and cervical lymphadenopathy, especially unresponsive to b-lactam antibiotics in the endemic regions and early treatment with proper antibiotics should be started.",

The organism is commonly found in the blood of cats and other felids. Classic presentation is tender and swollen regional lymph nodes with or without a papule at the site of initial infection. In immunocompromised patients, however, more severe forms of presentation can occur. Diagnosis is usually possible by serology and or histopathology. Case summary: An 14-year-old Kuwaiti girl, previously healthy, was admitted with fever, abdominal pain, nausea and generalized weakness. She had arrived from a trip to Egypt five days earlier. There was no history of diarrhea, vomiting, urinary symptoms or rash. On Examination the patient looked ill & had an oral temperature of 40 \u00baC with abdominal tenderness and guarding. Initial blood investigations showed a WBC of 14.1\u00d710 9 , ESR 44 mm/h, C-Reactive Protein (CRP) 150 mg/l, urea 3.2 mmol/l and creatinine 39 umol/l. Urinalysis showed presence of RBC & WBC but the culture was negative. A diagnosis of appendicitis was made and appendicectomy was performed. The patient, however, continued to run high grade fever (>40\u00baC). Therapy with piperacillintazobactam (TAZ) and metronidazole was initiated but no clinical response was observed. CT of the abdomen showed mesenteric and para-aortic lymphadenopathy and multiple splenic lesions. A suspicion of enteric fever prompted changing TAZ to ceftriaxone. Blood culture, brucella agglutination, T spot test, & Widal test were all negative. several antibiotic courses including anti-TB & anti-fungal were tried but none helped to improve her condition. Finally, splenectomy and lymph node biopsy was done and the pathology report concluded multiple splenic granulomas with a picture suggestive of CSD. Serology, however, proved negative (IFA titre: IgG: <1:64; IgM: <1:20). History of contact with cats in Egypt was elicited from the patient after pathology report was available. There was a dramatic improvement in her condition following splenectomy.",

Investigation revealed evidence of cardiac lead vegetations on a transesophageal echocardiogram. Preoperative blood cultures and intraoperative cultures taken during laser lead extraction became positive for Brucella suis (with MICs of 0.25 mg/L to each of ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, and rifampin). Upon further questioning, the patient a subacute history of constitutional symptoms, and reported hunting, skinning, and butchering Canadian caribou (Rangifer tarandus). The patient's brother, a hunting partner, had been treated for B. suis infection 2 years previously. Our patient was treated with laser lead extraction and combination oral antimicrobial therapy with doxycycline and rifampin for 3 months. Follow up blood cultures were negative. Discussion: Brucella suis type 4 is a known pathogen of Canadian caribou herds. It is hypothesised that cutaneous exposures when while skinning and butchering or ingestion of undercooked meat resulted in zoonotic transmission of the organism to our patient causing bacteraemia and secondary seeding of his pacemaker wires. From our literature search, this is the first reported case of pacemaker endocarditis due to B. suis. It is important that clinicians be aware of the possible zoonotic transmission of B. suis to patients exposed to caribou in the Canadian north and the risk of secondary infection of underlying foreign bodies (such as PPMs). Clinicians are also reminded to alert microbiology labs if Brucella is a suspect pathogen, to allow appropriate biosafety precautions.",

We present the first known menigococcal meningitis case caused by N. meningitidis serogroup X since the start of the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine administration to recruits. Serogroup X has emerged as a cause of meningococcal disease in a susceptible population because of suppression of other serogroups not included in the quadrivalent vaccine.

Case study: A 29-year-old IVDU male was transferred from emergency unit of neighbouring hospital to intensive care of this hospital on February 4, with signs of severe sepsis and seizures. CT head revealed small parietal bleed; lumbar puncture was non-conclusive and CTPA was negative for pulmonary embolism, but showed extensive non occlusive thrombus in superior vena cava. Systolic murmur prompted trans-esophageal echo revealing mitral regurgitation with vegetation. Following isolation of meticillin-sensitive SA grown from two sets of blood culture, the patients was treated with Flucloxacillin IV 1g q6h for 4-weeks. After 3 weeks of satisfactory response, the patient started getting intermittent pyrexia, elevation of CRP and WCC; mild renal and hepatic impairment.

Patients with abnormal CT findings had greater risk of intubation, ventilation, ICU admission and death than those with normal CT, but some patients with similar CT findings had various outcomes from improvement and discharge to death. Conclusion: Chest CT findings may be significant in prediction of clinical outcome and management of the disease (e.g., initiation of antibiotics) in patients with influenza infection but CT findings alone does not exactly predict the outcome and other risk factors should be considered. Objectives: G glutamyl transferase (GGT) is an enzyme that is present in the cell membranes of many tissues. High GGT level is used as a prognostic factor for alcoholic liver disease, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular diseases, liver cancer and liver metastasis of different cancers. Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever has been emerging in Turkey for the last 8 years. Elevation of alanine amino transferase (ALT) and aspartate amino trasnsferase (AST) levels are used both severity criteria and prognostic factor for fatality in the management of CCHF. However, we observed an association between GGT levels and the course of the disease. In this study we aimed to figure out the relation between serum GGT levels and CCHF and its effect on survival, if there is any. Methods: Patients with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of CCHF were included in to the study. Serum ALA, AST, gama glutamyl trasnferase (GGT) were retrospectively investigated from the records. Two parameters were used for evaluation of relation between CCHF and GGT; serum GGT levels and serum AST-GGT ratio. Because of AST elevation is a prominent feature of CCHF than ALT elevation, AST/GGT ratio was chosen as a marker. Results: Totally 126 patients were included. Of total, 71 (56.3%) were female. The mean age was 50.2 years (15\u221283 years). The mean hospital stay of the patients was 7.5 days (1\u221228 days). Remarkable laboratory findings were as follows (mean, min-max); WBC: 2472/mm3 (500-8900). Platelets: 59000/mm3 (7000-361000), AST: 291U/L (17-3060), ALT:133U/L (9-879) and GGT: 91 U/L (6-759). Comparing the serum levels of GGT between fatal and non fatal cases, mean GGT levels were statistically significantly higher in fatal cases on the 2nd and 3rd days of admission. Serum AST levels were also found higher in those days in the fatal group. The mean GGT level continued to increase during the course of the disease (Figure 1 ). When AST/GGT ratio was investigated, the ratio was >1 in the first 7 days of admission but <1 after the 7th day. Higher serum GGT level was the most prominent laboratory finding in all non fatal cases (Figure 2) . A positive correlation was detected between higher AST/GGT ratio and mortality.",

Interleukin (IL)-12 is a pivotal cytokine that strongly stimulates Th1-associated cellular immunity, and activates humoral immunity to both T-dependent and T-independent antigens. IL-12 has an immunoregulatory functions which may play a role in promoting endogenous protective responses during infections and/or contribute to pathology resulting from unregulated cytokine expression. Pathogen induction of IL-12 elicits interferon-g production by natural killer cells, which contribute to early defense during certain bacterial, parasitic, and viral infections. ",

We measured BNP, PCT and CRP in blood samples, taken the first 2 (two) days of hospitalization. The outcome was determined as survivors and nonsurvivors. Results: We had 66 female and 48 male patients. Among those patients, 68 were survivors (59,6%) and 46 (40,4%) non-survivors. There was a significant increase of BNP levels in non-survivors patients (1027) vs. BNP levels in survivors patients (432, 55) . Also the PCT mean levels were higher in the non-survivors's group (20,65) vs. the survivors's group (3, 6) . Finally, the mean levels of CRP in survivors was 167,21 and in the non-survivors was 166,4. Conclusions: In our study BNP and PCT levels measured soon after admission were increased significantly in sepsis and they seem to be a valuable prognostic marker in the outcome of these patients.

Dokuzoguz (Ankara, TR) Introduction: H1N1 influenza pandemic caused higher morbidity and mortality among pregnant women than in the general population underscores the medical community's urgent need for data regarding the safe and effective use of medications during pregnancy. Although the benefits of treatment appears to outweigh the theoretical risks of antiviral use there is few data about the newborns who borned from mothers who took medications for H1N1 during their pregnancy. In this study we aimed to investigate the clinical characteristics of H1N1 influenza in pregnant women and follow up the health status of newborns of these mothers after delivery. Methods: Twenty pregnant women with clinical symptoms and diagnosis of influenza A (H1N1) were included in this study from October 2009 to January 2010. All the study population were followed up until delivery and newborns were evaluated for any complication associated with infection or medication. Results: Twenty of 276 hospitalized patients with pandemic H1N1 influenza were pregnant (7.2%). The mean age was 24\u00b13 (17\u221230years). Thirteen (65%) pregnant women were in 2nd trimestre, 5 (25%) were in 3rd trimestre and 2 (10%) were in 1st trimestre when they admitted to hospital. Although 80% of patients had pathologic respiratory auscultation findings, only 4 pregnant patients accepted chest X-ray test and all of them had bilateral patchy alveolar opacities. Two of them required mechanical ventilation. One of the mechanically ventilated pregnant woman died at the second day of hospitalization. Six of the patients didn't accept to get antiviral medication. Only one pregnant women who got antiviral medication (oseltamivir) had premature birth at 36th week. All other deliveries were in term and no complications were detected in newborns up to 4th week of their life. Conclusion: Although early evidence suggests that pregnant women may be at higher risk for severe complications (including stillbirth) from novel H1N1, the benefits of treatment appears to outweigh the theoretical risks of antiviral use. Early anti-viral therapy, may bring clinical benefits to pregnant patients. ",

On the farm, there are present many species of birds (local and exotic) and mammals (goats, cattle, pigs, donkeys, horses) none of which showed any of the above mentioned symptoms. Methods: From one moribund female which was euthanised samples were collected for laboratory analysis. Skin lesions were processed for electron microscopy techniques. Two mammal cell lines (Vero and BHK21) were used for virus isolation attempts. Total viral DNA was extracted from both homogenized crusts and Vero cells supernatant. Real-time PCR, targeting the crmB gene, sequencing and phylogenetic analysis were performed to identify the virus. Other viral and bacterial diseases were considered as differential diagnosis. Results: Transmission electron microscopy revealed brick particles typical of orthopoxviruses. CPXV-antibodies were detected from llama and human sera (farmers). A Real-Time PCR gave positive results for both crust and cells supernatant. Phylogenetic analysis of two poxvirus genes (HA and crmB) confirmed a Cowpoxvirus infection, homologous to the CPXV-GuWi strain isolated in Germany in 2007.",

We also searched for associations between observed compliance and various factors. Methods: The study was conducted in \"Evaggelismos\" Hospital, a 950-bed, tertiary care general hospital in Athens, Greece, between March and June 2010. Compliance data collection was based on direct and overt HCW observation during patient care, while anonymous, self-administered questionnaires were used to collect information on knowledge and perceptions. We used the data collection forms and questionnaires provided by WHO. Results: During 41 observation sessions with average duration of 18.6 min, we recorded 587 hand hygiene opportunities. Total average compliance was 13.6%. Compliance was significantly higher among physicians than among nurses [21.6% vs. 9.5% (p < 0.001)]. Professional category (doctor vs. nurse), type of indication (before contact vs. after contact), day of observation (after \"on take\" day vs. other days) and activity index were found to correlate strongly with compliance. 142/228 knowledge questionnaires were completed. The average number of correct answers to the 25 knowledge questions was 12.38 (SD = 3.40) and differed significantly among age groups, professional categories, departments and wards. Only 4.2% of HCWs answered correctly to more than 19 (75%) questions. 139/228 perception questionnaires were completed. Behavioral beliefs in favor of hand hygiene seemed to be strong and produced a positive attitude toward the behavior. Normative beliefs were also relatively favorable with respect to hand hygiene. As for control beliefs, most HCWs felt that a big effort is required to perform good hand hygiene. According to HCWs' views, the most effective action to improve hand hygiene in the hospital is to make alcohol-based handrub always available at each point of care. Patient empowerment is regarded as the least effective measure. Conclusions: Compliance rates in \"Evaggelismos\" Hospital are very low compared to those of other studies carried out in Greece or in other countries. Doctors' and nurses' level of knowledge is not satisfactory, while low perceived behavioral control seems to exert strong influence on HCWs' behavior. Action needs to be taken, involving a combination of system change, education and motivation.",

Yang, S.Y. Zhao, Z.Q. Che, C. Zhu, W.J. Zhou, M. Zhong, F. Jing, E.Z. Chen (Shanghai, CN) Objective: To investigate the effect of oral hygiene with chlorhexidine influences bacterial epidemiology or incidence of nosocomial pneumonia in intensive care unit. Methods: Patients admitted and stayed for more than 48h to our 18bed polyvalent ICU of a Chinese tertiary care teaching hospital were enrolled in our study. From May 2008 to April 2009, during preintervention period, protocol of oral hygiene consisted of metronidazole in the morning and boiled water in the evening and has been changed to 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate twice daily since May 2009. Bacterial epidemiology of nosocomial pneumonia (NP) and ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) was studied. Statistical analysis was performed by SAS 8.0. Results: Five hundred and forty-two patients admitted in our ICU from May 2008 to April 2010, of which four hundred and eighty-seven patients were screened, 234 patients, 103 episodes of NP, of which 44 VAP (21/33 for patients intubated) for 1070 device-day, occurred during the pre-intervention period; while 253 patients, 93 NP, of which 42 VAP (28/43 for patients intubated) for 1205 device-day during the intervention period. There was no significant difference between the intubated patients for sex (60.6% vs. 78.7%, p = 0.078), age (62.6\u00b121.3 vs. 62.2\u00b117.7, p = 0.968), median ICU stay (37d vs. 29d, p = 0.259) and ventilator-day (1070d vs. 1205d, p = 0.496). Overall rate of catheter related pneumonia (VAP) and rate of NP was 37.8 (episodes per 1000 ventilator-day) and 20.0 (episode per 1000 patient-day), 41.1 and 34.9; 24.3 and 16.7 for preintervention and intervention period, respectively. Among 143 bacteria isolated for the first year, 32 (22.4%) were G+, of which were18 MRSA, 111 (77.6%) were G-, of which 63.1% were non-fermentive bacteria. During the intervention period, among 113 bacteria, 28 (24.8%) were G+ of which were 19 MRSA, 85 (75.2%) were G-, of which 72.9% were non-fermentive bacteria. For MRSA and non fermentive bacteria distribution, there was no significant difference between 2 studied periods for VAP. Conclusions: Oral hygiene with 0.2% chlorhexidine twice daily changed little bacterial distribution of NP in ICU compared with pre-intervention period. However, the slightly decreased 15% (41.1 to 34.9) incidence of VAP by episodes per 1000 catheter-day and 31% (24.3 to 16.7) incidence of NP by 1000 patient-day were observed during the intervention period suggests a possible benefit of oral hygiene for ventilated patients in ICU. (1987.9-1990 .2), period B (1990.3-1997.8), period C (1997.9-1999.2), period D (1999.3-2004.10), and period E (2004.11-2010\u22128) , and compared the periods. In period B, Cefazolin and cefotiam were administered as prophylaxis. The dosing continued for 4 days, including the day of surgery. Moreover, nonscreening pre-emptive isolation and cohorting (NSPEI&C) were applied to the patients undergoing endotracheal intubation or tracheotomy who were admitted to single rooms (isolation) and multiple patients with similar conditions in one room (cohorting), regardless of whether or not MRSA was isolated. Since August 1997, however, the idea of evidencebased medicine (EBM) has spread over Japan so that we had no other choice than stopping NSPEI&C because NSPEI&C had no confirmed evidence. Since then, MRSA become isolated from postoperative patients even more often. Then, NSPEI&C was strictly instituted again, and the dosing period of prophylactic antibiotics for postoperative infection being shortened or extended, the isolation rate of MRSA after digestive surgeries could be significantly reduced. We report herein the method to prevent the isolation of MRSA for two decades. However, NSPEI&C was stopped in period C, but was implemented again, and prophylactic antibiotics were administered only on the day of surgery in period D. In period E, prophylactic antibiotics were administered for 3 days. Objectives: Infections of prostheses and surrounding tissue are one of the most serious complications in orthopedic surgery. Most, these infections caused by staphylococci, especially Staphylococcus aureus. Nowadays S. aureus often has a complete resistance against b-lactams (methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA)), mostly connected with a resistance against other antibiotics, e.g. lincosamides, quinolones. Exchange of the implant and temporary implantation of antibioticcontaining spacers is the mode of choice in treatment of these biofilmassociated infections. Our in vitro-study was aimed to determine the antimicrobial activity of antibiotic-containing specimens over a time period of up to three months. Methods: Specimens were prepared from commercially available bone cements (without antibiotics, with 12.5 mg gentamicin/g, with 25 mg gentamicin and 25 mg clindamycin/g cement). Additionally the cement containing 12.5 mg gentamycin was supplemented with 25 mg and 100 mg/g vancomycin. Specimens were placed in nutrient broth with five test strains (2 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus (MSSA), 2 MRSA, 1 S. epidermidis). If bacterial growth was visible in the broth specimens were removed and bacteria attached to the surface of the specimens were counted. Further, specimens were soaked into nutrient broth and phosphate buffered saline; eluates were taken for determination of antimicrobial activity by means of agar diffusion test. Results: Cements containing gentamicin and clindamycin showed a higher antimicrobial activity against MSSA and S. epidermidis in comparison to cement containing only gentamicin. All specimens were infected 15 d after starting the experiments. Specimens with gentamicin and clindamycin inhibited biofilm formation and acted antimicrobial against MSSA strains and S. epidermidis strain up to 84 days. Cements with gentamicin also combined with clindamycin did not have any effect on MRSA strains. Only supplementation of vancomycin was able to inhibit growth of MRSA strains; concentration of 100 mg was more active up to 25 days.",

Ataie (Isfahan, IR) Objectives: Nosocomial infections are those which are created during hospitalization or as its result. The health care workers' hands are the main route of microorganism transmission. Hand washing is the most important measure to prevent spread of this infection. Compliance of hand hygiene (HH) among healthcare workers is generally low (less than 50%). This study aimed to determine the acceptance level of hand hygiene in Isfahan hospitals, 2010 to design interventions to increase awareness, motivation and performance among Healthcare workers. Methods: This cross sectional study was conducted in three large hospitals in Isfahan (a public training medical center, a public medical center, and a private medical center) and a total of seven trained observers for different working shifts at three hospitals were selected. 7 working days during two different weeks and every day, eight 20-minute sessions was considered. During these sessions, observers monitored healthcare workers during their routine activities through a check list. Five indications (before touching a patient, before a procedure, after a procedure or body fluid exposure risk, after touching a patient, after touching a patient surroundings) were observed based on the World Health Organization guideline. Four different professional groups (physician, nursing, student, others) were considered for this study. HH compliance was calculated as \"(number of positive hand hygiene actions/number of total hand hygiene indications) \u00d7 100\" based on each indication and professional group. Results: From the total 3097 observed indications, in general, the HH compliance rate was 5.6% and statistically significant between three different hospitals (7.4%, 4.1%, and 1.4% respectively). The most rates were observed among the nursing group (7.3%), and then the student group (6.5%), (p-value less than 0.001). Among the various indications, the highest rate of compliance was observed after a procedure or body fluid exposure risk (9.4%), (p-value less than 0.001). Conclusion: In this study, the hand hygiene compliance rate in hospitals studied was low and needs to plan for improve. Phadebact monoclonal antibody typing (Boule Diagnostic AB, Hudding, Sweden) was performed on these isolates. Penicillinase production was performed using nitrocephin method. Results: All 36 isolates were WII/WIII (IB serovars), yielded 100% invitro susceptibility to ceftriaxone (MIC 0.5mg/l) and spectinomycin (MIC 128mg/l). Three isolates (8.3%) were resistance to penicillin (MIC 2mg/l) and were penicillinase producing strains. Twenty eight isolates (77.8%) yielded reduced susceptibility to penicillin (MIC 0.12\u22121mg/l). Thirty one isolates (86%) were resistance to penicillin or yielded reduced susceptibility to penicillin. Five isolates (13.9%) were resistant to ciprofloxacin (QRNG) (MIC 1mg/l) of these five isolates three yielded penicillin reduced susceptibility pattern while two were resistant to penicillin. Six (16.7%) were resistant to tetracycline (MIC 2mg/l) (TRNG). All the ciprofloxacin resistant isolates were from male subjects. Seven distinct antimicrobial susceptibility patterns were observed. A 0.74% isolation rate was obtained in this study population. Conclusion: Ciprofloxacin and penicillin resistance is increasing. Cephalosporin resistance was not observed but, local continuous antimicrobial surveillance is paramount and should be ongoing. There was no distinct link between the phadebact monoclonal typing of these isolates and their antimicrobial susceptibility pattern.",

Accordingly, the implants in glass tubes (diameter 0.4 cm) were placed in shaking incubator at 35 \u00baC/80 rpm. Implants were rinsed with distilled water in aseptic conditions once a week. Results: The bacterial growth was statistically higher in broth containing titanium external fixators compared to broth media containing silver ioncoated and hydroxyapatite-coated external fixators at 24 hours (p = 0.036 and p = 0.009, respectively). The release of bacteria from silver ioncoated fixators was statistically less compared to hydroxyapatite-and titanium-coated fixators (p = 0.039 and p = 0.002, respectively). MIC levels for 5% silver ion powder was 8 mg/mL for CNS. No free silver ions were detected in broth media using this method which has a detection threshold as low as 0.02 ppm.

Methods: We recruited 173 laboratory personnel and performed QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube test (QFT-G) and tuberculin skin test (TST). Agreement between QFT-G and TST was analyzed, and risk factors for the positivity of each test were assessed. Results: QFT-G was positive in 21.4% of the enrolled laboratory personnel, and TST was positive in 33.3% with a cut-off of 10 mm. The agreement between the two tests was fair (kappa = 0.234; 95% confidence interval = 0.054-0.414). Age and duration of health care profession were significantly associated with positive QFT-G and TST results by univariate analyses. With multivariate logistic regression analyses, household contact to TB patients (P = 0.013), the laboratory sections of microbiology (P = 0.045) and chemistry/immunology (P = 0.014) were significantly associated with positive QFT-G results. Conclusions: Our data shows the high prevalence of LTBI in the laboratory personnel, and emphasizes the importance of LTBI screening for the health care workers. QFT-G seems to be superior to TST for the LTBI screening. T. Panayea, G. Petrikkos, A. Armaganidis, H. Giamarellou (Chaidari, Athens, GR) Objectives: Copper has been shown to have antimicrobial properties and when used on hospital surfaces it minimized environmental contamination by pathogenic bacteria. We investigated the effects of two copper alloys on the survival of VIM and/or KPC-producing multi-drug resistant (MDR) Enterobacteriaceae. Methods: MDR clinical isolates were screened for the production of VIM or KPC carbapenemase using the EDTA-imipenem or the boronic acid-meropenem synergy test, respectively. The genes were confirmed by PCR with specific primers. To assess the antimicrobial properties of copper, coupons (1 cm \u00d7 1 cm) of copper alloys (A and B containing Cu99% and Cu63%Zn37%, respectively) were sterilized, inoculated with 20 ml of bacterial suspension (10 8 cfu/ml) and incubated at room temperature for 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 and 24 hours. Then coupons were placed in sterile neutralizing broth (Difco) and vortexed. The broth was serially diluted and quantitatively cultured for recovery of viable bacteria. The lower limit of detection was 2.6 log10 cfu/ml. Stainless steel (C) and polyvinylchloride (D) coupons were used as controls. Mean viable counts (log10 cfu/ml) after incubation at each time interval with each coupon were compared for statistical analysis. Reduction of viable counts by 3 log10 from starting inoculum was characterized as bactericidal activity. Results: Thirteen isolates including K. pneumoniae (7), E. coli (4) and Enterobacter spp. (2) producing either VIM (2), KPC (10) or both (1) were tested. At 3 and 5 hours, mean viable bacterial counts on coupon A decreased by 1.2 and 3.4 log10, respectively while the reduction produced by coupon B at 5 and 6 hours was 2.1 and 3.2 log10, respectively. Controls C and D reduced bacterial counts by 2.1 log10 at 6 and by 2.3 log10 at 24 hours, respectively. A bactericidal effect was detected by coupons A and B at 5 and 6 hours, respectively. Viable bacteria could not be recovered from 10/13 tested strains incubated on coupon A after 5 hours and from 8/13 strains after 6 hours of incubation on coupon B.",

Six months after the education, all staffs of the departments which decreased their infection rates were promised to be awarded with 10% pay raise. Results: During the study period 462 CVCs and 1258 UCs were inserted to 1075 patients and catheter days were 4313 and 6918, respectively. Most observed indications of CVC are peripheral intravenous access problem (41%) and haemodialysis (29%). Insertion sites were 41% jugular and 41% subclavian. 20% of CVCs were inserted in emergency conditions. Mean lenght of catheterisation was 11 days. Compliance to maximum barrier precautions was 41%, but this rate was correlated with doctors' education years. Most common displacement reasons for CVC were exitus (50%) and discontinuity of indication (32%). Compliance to prevention bundle was 13%. Mean lenght of catheterisation was 13.25 days. There was a relationship between the clinic which inserted the catheter and compliance to maximum barrier precautions for CVCs and UCs.

We present findings from 1st 6-months of an innovative pilot project \"multidisciplinary CDI performance management meetings [MCPM]\" aimed to spearhead the trust CDI programme in future. The aims of MCPM include team working, problem solving, real time \"shop-floor\" troubleshooting, raising profile and awareness in a friendly interactive session. The results have been used to inform a regularly monitored strategic action plan. In 2008 we recorded one P. aeruginosa PAN-R strain, sensible only to colistin. In May-September 2008, an unexpected high incidence of VRE was reported. AFLP analysis of these VRE strains documented a genetic relationship between two different groups of isolates: 2 isolates show similar AFLP patterns but different from those of the other 4 genetically related isolates. These data suggest a possible person to person transmission. After corrective measures no other case of VRE was documented. No Gram-negative outbreak was recorded in the same period.",

O'Connor (Stevenage, UK) Background: Detection of C difficile or its toxins has been observed to be problematic. False negative results have meant that patients were tested repeatedly when symptomatic. Among the reasons for poor negative predictive value are the labile nature of the toxins and the limitations of available technologies. Newer and more sensitive technologies were introduced such as PCR. These technologies have reduced the rates of false negatives and eliminated the need for multiple samples. In recent years, and through a combination of infection control measures, CDAD rates were reduced dramatically. However, these successes brought to the front the significance of high false positive rates especially with the ultra-sensitive new technologies. It is wellestablished that toxin-producing C. difficile can colonise young children and older patients with history of repeated and prolonged hospitalisation. There is a need for a new approach to determine the clinical value of a positive result. Objectives: This study was designed to assess the concordance between different toxin assays and clinical presentation in Antigen positive/Toxin negative patients. Methods: Twenty six Antigen positive/toxin negative stool samples (Techlab EIA for both GDH Ag and toxin) were included in the study. Patients with multiple samples were identified. Samples were then tested using VIDAS EIA, culture and ribotyping, CEPHEID GeneXPert PCR and cytotoxicity assay. Clinical presentation and follow up data were then analysed to assess clinical significance of each result. Results: Patients who had alternative explanations for their transient diarrhoea (e.g. laxatives), were found to be toxin-negative by EIA. However, 86% of these samples were positive by PCR and all produced cytotoxic effects following culture. Isolates were from a number of ribotypes (001, 002, 015 and 054). Conclusions: These results suggest that combined clinical/laboratory interpretation is of more value at the current epidemiological setting. Highly sensitive technologies, such as PCR, may detect the presence of toxin genes in cases of colonisation or subclinical presence of C. difficile. Our data suggest that samples found to be Antigen positive but toxin negative by EIA, in the presence of alternative clinical causes for diarrhoea, should be treated as colonisation. However, these patients should be monitored closely and should be isolated, while having diarrhoea, to limit environmental contamination.",

Paramythiotou, D. Plachouras, V. Spyropoulos, H. Giamarellou, A. Papadopoulos, K. Kanellakopoulou (Athens, GR) Objectives: Chronic foot osteomyelitis (CFO) is a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge for appropriate regimen and length of antimicrobial therapy. Most CFO occurred on the ground of diabetic foot (DF). This study aims to evaluate factors influencing successful outcome in patients (pts) with CFO with or without DF. Patients and Methods: Pts with CFO were retrieved from a data-base of 700 pts with bone and joint infections followed in our reference clinic from 1999 to 2009. Demographics, DF, foot vascular and neurologic complications, charcot joint and gangrene were assessed following standard definitions. Diagnosis of CFO was based upon clinical, imaging and laboratory/microbiological evaluation. A completely restoration of all the above parameters was considered as cure. Chi-square and Mann Whitney tests were applied for categorical and continuous variables respectively. A logistic regression analysis of factors predictive of outcome was performed. Results: DFO pts (n = 137), were male (59%) with median age + IQR(25\u221275) = 60 (52\u221270) and comorbidities (n = 76) including diabetes mellitus-DM (n = 64, insulin dependent, n = 60), rheumatic arthritis (n = 3), non DM vascular disease (n = 6), vascular (n = 44), neurological (n = 27) DM complications, charcot joint (n = 22) and gangrene (n = 24) with amputations (n = 25) and orthopedic device (n = 2). HbA1C was above 7 in32 pts. Median IQR(25\u221275) time from infection onset to treatment was 5 (2\u221212) months. Sinus tract and ulcer but no fever were found in 71 and 49 pts respectively. Microbiological documentation of DFO was based on intra-operative cultures (n = 83), prone to the bone or aspiration samples (n = 21). Gram positive bacteria (86%) included MRSA (32.5%), MRSE (17%) while Gram negative bacteria accounted for 49%. Among 84 polymicrobial cases, 16.6% were S. aureus plus P. aeruginosa. ESR/CRP baseline were abnormal in 90% of pts. Combined antimicrobial therapy was given to 117/137 pts including fluoroquinolones (n = 92,67%). Only 16 fully reversible adverse events were noted. Median IQR (25\u221275) treatment duration was 6 (6\u22128) months. However, 34% were treated for up to 3 months, 42% up to 6 months and 24% more than 6 months. Median follow up was 12 months. Cure Analysis demonstrated that only HbA1C more than 7 was independently related to adverse outcome (p = 0.0001). Conclusions: Only normal HBA1c and n were predictive of the pts' outcome. Strict glycemic control is mandatory in the management of pts with DFO.",

Improved chromogenic media can detect MRSA within 18\u221224 hours. The purpuse of this study was to evaluate the abillity of two chromogenic media Oxoid Brilliance\u2122MRSA II Agar (Oxoid, Ltd, Basingstoke, UK) and ChromID\u2122MRSA (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy-l'Etoile, France), for detection of MRSA from surveillance specimens. Methods: Brilliance and ChromID were tested using six strains of MRSA (ATCC 43300), hVISA (ATCC 700698) and hGISA (ATCC 700699), two strains of MSSA (ATCC 29213) and a strain of E. faecalis and E. coli. The rest were strains isolated from patients (laboratory strain collection). One to two colonies of the test strain from the third subcultivation were inoculated on Brilliance and ChromID. 55 patient samples were processed. Skin, nose or throat swabs were sent in an Amies transport medium. Each sample was inoculated into Todd-Hewitt enrichment broth (THBS), blood agar (BA), Brilliance and ChromID. The first 28 samples were inoculated in the following order: 1. THBS 2. BA, 3. Brilliance, 4. ChromID. The next 27 samples were inoculated in a different order: 1. THBS 2. BA, 3. ChromID, 4. Brilliance. The plates were inspected after 18\u221221h of incubation at 35\u00baC. The plates were inspected after 18\u221221h of incubation at 35\u00baC. All denim-blue colonies on Brilliance and green colonies on ChromID were processed according to CLSI guidelines. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for all DNAse and coagulase positive strains with positive result of methicillin-resistance screening (MRSA strains) according to CLSI guidelines. Denim-blue and green colonies that were DNAse and coagulase negative (regardless of the result of methicillin-resistance screening) were considered false positive (CNS); DNAse and coagulase positive and oxascreen negative colonies were considered false positive (MSSA). Results: All MRSA strains produced denim-blue or green colonies following 18\u221224 hours of incubation (Table 1) . One discrepant result was obtained from a patient sample, the colonies denim-blue were on Brilliance, and yellow on ChromID. MRSA was confirmed in both cases. Strains of MSSA, E. faecalis and E. coli failed to grow on both chromogenic media. Conclusion: Both agars are fast, easy to use and reliable. They require no additional costs and are accessible to every microbiological laboratory in comparison with rapid PCR methods.",

The aim of our study was to determine the pattern of cytokine synthesis in the ascitic fluid (AF) of cirrhotic patients, with or without SBP. Patients and Methods: We prospectively studied 13 cirrhotic patients with ascitis, who were admitted at the University Hospital of Patras from May 2006 to December 2007. Patients were separated into two groups: (a) group 1: patients with SBP (b) group 2: patients without SBP. Cirrhosis was diagnosed on the basis of typical clinical, laboratory, ultrasonographic findings and/or liver biopsy. Upon admission a paracentesis of ascetic fluid was performed. Ascitic levels of IL-1b, IL-1ra, IL-6, IL-10, TNFa, sTNFRI and sTNFRII were measured by using an ELISA method. Data are presented as mean\u00b1standard deviation and were compared using t test. A P value <0.05 was considered significant. Results: Characteristics of patients with SBP VS those without SBP are: age 69\u00b112 vs 62\u00b115, male/female ratio 5/2 vs 5/1, ethanol use 5 vs 4, viral hepatitis 1 vs 2, cryptogenic 1 vs noone. The ascitic concentrations of individual cytokines in group 1 vs group 2 are the following: IL-10: 160\u00b1142 vs 80\u00b174, IL-6: 2413\u00b13183 vs 2257\u00b12478, TGF-a: 11\u00b120 vs 0.5\u00b11, sTNFRI: 8191\u00b13077 vs 5618\u00b12384, sTNFRII: 5259\u00b12354 vs 2883\u00b1932, IL1-ra: 946\u00b1703 vs 131\u00b184, TGF-1b: 279\u00b1681 vs 378\u00b1671. Multivariate analysis showed significant (P < 0,05) differences in the levels of sTNFRII and IL-1ra between the two groups. Ascitic levels of IL-10, IL-6, IL-1ra, TNF-a, STNFRII and STNFRI were higher, while TGF-b1 levels were lower in the ascitic fluid of patients with SBP (differences not significant).

More recently, ESBLs are also spreading in the community worldwide. Carriers of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae remain colonized for prolonged periods, possibly representing an important source of spread. Knowledge on the body sites most commonly colonized with these pathogens is therefore of great importance in order to develop appropriate screening schemes. The aim of this study therefore, was to determine the frequency of colonization for each body site. Conclusions: Urine and the rectum are the sites most commonly colonized with ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae (61.5%) followed by the inguinal fold. These three sites should therefore be considered when screening for ESBL carriage is performed. Throat swabs and wound samples were positive in less than 5% of all specimens, suggesting that these sites are not useful for screening, however should be considered in the individual patient if a decolonization regimen is performed.

The risk factors including hospitalisation (OR:3,1; 1,19\u22128,1; p:0,018), co-morbidity (OR:2,1; 1,12\u22127,3, p:0,024), were found higher in ESBL (+) group compared to ESBL(\u2212) group. Hospitalisation at last three months was found as a risk factor for resistance to any 3rd generation cephalosporins (OR:2,4; 0,9\u22126,3; p:0,04). There was a correlation between ESBL (+) production and resistant to many antibiotics that are generally used for ampiric treatment (p < 0,05, Pearson correlation r: 0,78), except for piperacillintazobactam (p > 0,05). ESBL production was significantly higher in K. pneumoniae (p: 0,0005), E. cloacae (p:0,001), E. sakazakii (p:0,001) and A. baumannii (p:0,005) strains more than other Gram negative strains revealed in Table- 1. Hospitalisation was single significant risk factor for patients with MRSA (OR:1,8, 0,7\u22121,2, p:0,005; Table-1) . Vancomycin resistant Enterococcus was not isolated. Discussion: Hospitalisation and co-morbidity causing to colonisation and impairment on immunity are the most important risk factors for ESBL producing microorganisms related infections as our study revealed. Although antibiotic usage including 2nd, 3rd generation cephalosporins and quinolones was cited as a risk factor for ESBL related infections, it was not found significant statistically in our study. Piperacillin-tazobactam could be thought as an option to treat the resistant Gram negative infections associated with K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae, E. sakazakii and A. baumannii whose ESBL rates are frequently higher in our local settings but carbapenems, should be opted for serious patients with co-morbidites. Consequently, immunity and infection control programs are important factors against increasing antibiotic resistance rates. Objective: Infections in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) are associated with prolonged hospitalisation and adverse outcomes. The acknowledgement of the pre-disposing risk factors may help decrease the morbidity and mortality. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to determine the incidence, bacteriology and risk factors for development of infection after TBI.",

Fifty three of the admissions (6.3%) were complicated with at least one SSI, superficial or deep. The most common SSI was wound infection (2.2% of the cohort). The patients who underwent neurosurgery had a lower Glasgow Coma scale (GCS) on admission, they were more prone to be admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and bear drains.

            "text": "Introduction and Aim: Hydatid cyst is an infection of Echinococci and still represents a serious problem in endemic regions, especially in the Middle East, Mediterranean countries and Australia. Rupture of a hydatid cyst commonly gives rise to allergic phenomena, including anaphylactic shock. Rupture of cyst can occur spontaneously or during surgery as well as due to trauma. We describe a patient who after trauma presented to the emergency department with scant physical signs. Case report: A 17-year-old girl was admitted to our emergency department after falling down of motorcycle, 15 to 20 minutes previously. She was only complained of pain of her head and she had two minor traumas on her face. On presentation, her Glasgow Coma Scale was 15, blood pressure 120/80 mmHg, pulse rate 110 beats per minute, temperature was 36.8\u00baC and her physical examination was normal except for mild abdominal tenderness. There was no evidence of any other injury and the secondary survey was otherwise normal. White blood cell count was 16,400/mm 3 , eosinophilia was absent and the other laboratory tests were within normal limits. She underwent head and neck computed tomography without sciagraphic fluid and during examination general urticaria developed and it was progressive. The examination stopped and fluid resuscitation, methyloprednisolone and diphenylhydramine were administered intravenously. Once her condition had stabilized she underwent abdomen computed tomography to determine the cause of the abdomen pain. There was no free fluid which usually excludes intraperitoneal bleeding. There was one ruptured cyst on the right lobe of the liver and another cyst measuring 104 mm with thin wall on the left lobe of the liver. The patient turned to have a rupture of a hydatid cyst and she was immediately taken to the operation room by the general surgeons. Drainage and capitonage of the cysts were performed. The patient was treated with albendazole for three months and at six months' follow-up she remained well without any complications. Conclusion: Rupture of hydatid cyst is rare and can occur spontaneously following serious injuries or even minor trauma. Anaphylaxis is the most frequent cause of death in cases of hydatid cyst rupture. Echinococcus liver cysts should be suspected in cases of anaphylaxis of uncertain etiology. Acute vascular collapse, generalized cutaneous erythema, urticaria and edema are suggestive of anaphylaxis from hydatidosis, especially in endemic areas. A. Rodriguez Guardado*, G. Martin, L. Casado, F. Perez, M. Rodriguez, V. Carcaba, J. Carton (Oviedo, ES) Introduction: Travelers visiting friends or relatives (VFRs) typically demonstrate travel and behavioural patterns which render them at high risk for acquisition of preventable infection. Pre-travel services are rarely sought by VFRs, whereas misconceptions that they possess life-long immunity against malaria make them less likely to receive or adhere to antimalarial chemoprophylaxis recommendations. Objective: We analyzed the adherence of this group against these measures of prophylaxis and health problems resulting from the travel. Methods: All VFRs travellers attended in a tropical medicine referral unit between 2007-2010 were interviewed with a questionnaire investigating use of malaria prophylaxis, vaccination, and knowledge of dietary and hygiene measures before and during the travel. VFR was defined as all immigrants permanently established in Spain who temporarily travelling to their place of origin.",

They travelled to Senegal (33%) Equatorial Guinea (25%), Ecuador (18%), Bolivia (8%), Venezuela (5%), Brazil, Cameroon and Colombia (3% each) and Ethiopia (2%). Only 23% patients received health's advice before travel, 72% of travellers didn't received any vaccine and 78% did not carry out antimalaria chemoprophylaxis. Only 25% used safe water. No one use repellents. Twenty-eight patients (46%) were to be illness to return home. Twenty-six patients had diarrhea during the trip and 20% fever, being the most frequent reasons for consultation. In 32% of cases the diarrhea was due to parasitic infections. Eight patients had malaria, in 6 cases due to P. falciparum and two to P. vivax. Conclusions: VFRs are a group of high risk for imported disease due to poor adherence to vaccination and prophylaxis measures. At present, immigrants visiting friends and relatives (VFRs) constitute the most significant group of travellers for malaria importation in developed countries, with sub-Saharan Africa destinations carrying the highest risk. There is an urgent need to increase health's travel advice in this group of travellers. Statistical data analysis used descriptive and and analytic methods \u2212 Mann-Whitney U test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. The value of p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: Within 5 years 44 patients were treated with trihinellosis. Around 2/3 (68.18%) of them were men, average age being 41.18\u00b114.51, mostly from urban region (65.9%). Source of infection was known in 95% of the cases, out of which in 90% the cause was found to be with domestic animals.

There were no lethal outcomes, the disease have ended well with 39 patients, while 5 patients (11.36%) had a disease complications-two of them hepatitis, one neurotrichinellosis with neurological consequences, while two patients had myocarditis (one of them developed deep venous thrombosis). Comparing groups of patients with or without complications, the statistically significant difference was shown in time between the intake of food and the appearance of symptoms (p = 0,461). Duration of the disease before the diagnostic and treatment had no effect on the frequency of complications (p = 0,643), while there was statistically significant correlation between the duration of the sickness before the diagnosis was made and duration of the hospitalisation (p < 0.05). Conclusion: Although trihinellosis is a rare disease, it still represents a significant medical problem which we need to be reminded about.",

The present study aimed at analyzing the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of scabies in hospitalized patients with infectious diseases. Methods: Data were retrospectively collected from the medical charts of 62 patients found with scabies lesions at Clinic of Infectious Diseases, Timisoara during 2009. The positive diagnosis was established based on the epidemiological aspects (recent travels, family or collective outbreaks, sex with multiple partners), physical examination (lesions such as papules, pustules, burrows, nodules, and occasionally urticarial papules and plaques with patognomonic distribution: interdigital web spaces of the hands, perimalleolar and periumbilical region, ribs, horizontal gluteal crease, radiocarpal joint) and intense generalized skin itching at night. The diagnosis was confirmed either by microscopic identification of mites in skin scrapings or by dermoscopy. Patients followed treatment with precipitated sulfur apply topically to entire trunk and extremities every 24 hours for 3 days. Disinfection was carried out at all linen and personal items. Results: Of the study group, 40 (64.5%) patients were rural inhabitants and 22 (35.5%, p = 0.002) lived in urban areas. Six familial outbreaks occured in rural regions. Scabies was mainly associated with respiratory diseases (22.6%), liver diaseases (19.4%), intestinal diseases (12.9%), psychiatric disorders (16.1%), urinary infections (9.7%). Scabies lesions had the following patterns: edematous and urticariform papules (26 cases), papulo-vesicular lesions (22 cases), escoriations due to scratching (48 cases), and scratching related superinfected lesions with streptococcal or staphylococcal bacteria (35 cases). Common form of scabies was evidenced in 24 patients (38.7%) whereas 38 cases (61.3%) had atypical course of the disease (p = 0.02).

Methods: Isolates that were positive for Cryptosporidium oocysts by auramine staining were typed by PCR. The resulting molcular speciation was then analysed with clinical data (age, travel history, contact with animals, sporadic or part of an outbreak). Results: In this study 27 isolates were typed, 13 C. parum, 12 C. hominis, 1 C. meleagridis and 1 C. felis. There were some trends. Two isolates from Egypt and 1 from Greece were identified as C. hominis, while isolates from Pakistan and St Lucia were identified as C. parvum. This may represent epidemiological differences between the various travel desinations. One patient has both C. parvum and Shigella sonnei isolated, this would be strongly suggestive of a contaminated water source of infection. A second patient had both C. felis and Campylobacter sp isolated. This patient had recently acquired a kitten. It is possible that both pathogens contributed to the diarrhoea, or that the Campylobacter was the cause of the diarrhoea while the presence C. felis oocysts (a primary pathogen of feline hosts) may represent oocysts passing through the patient's gut rather than tissue invasion. Conclusions: Identification of cryptosporidial isolates either by genotype or as one of the cryptic species allows better understanding of potential source. Further studies are needed to confirm the trends seen in this study. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to compare the Neo-Sensitabs method with the CLSI reference broth microdilution (document M27-A3, S3) method for testing the susceptibility of 98 Candida spp. isolates to five antifungal agents (amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, and voriconazole). Methods: In this study, the broth microdilution method was performed according to the CLSI recommendations. The Neo-Sensitabs method was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (Neo-Sensitabs; A/S Rosco Diagnostica, Taastrup, Denmark). C. parapsilosis ATCC 22019 was used as quality control strain. Results: A total of 98 isolates of Candida spp.[C. albicans (n = 56), C. tropicalis (n = 22), C. parapsilosis (n = 6), C. glabrata (n = 4), C. dubliniensis (n = 3), C. krusei (n = 3), C. famata (n = 2), C. lusitaniae (n = 1), C. pelliculosa (n = 1)] were evaluated by both of the methods. MIC ranges were found as 0.03\u22128.0 mg/ml, 0.05\u221264 mg/ml, 0.03\u22120.5 mg/ml, 0.03\u22121.0 mg/ml, and 0.03-0.12 mg/ml for amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, and voriconazole for the microdilution method respectively. All isolates were susceptible to voriconazole by both of the methods. Ninety one (93%) of all isolates were determined as susceptible, two (2%) (C. albicans) were found susceptible dose dependent (SDD), and five (5%) [C. krusei (n = 3), C. glabrata (n = 1), C. albicans (n = 1)] were found resistant to fluconazole by both of the methods. Ninety two (94%) of all isolates were determined as susceptible, six (6%) [C. krusei (n = 3), C. albicans (n = 3)] were found SDD to itraconazole by both of the methods. There was 100% agreement between two of the methods for these three antifungal agents in this study. Two (2%; C. albicans, C. glabrata) and eight [8%; C. albicans(n = 3), C. krusei(n = 3), C. glabrata, C. tropicalis] isolates were determined as resistant to amphotericin B and ketoconazole by both of the methods respectively. One (C. albicans) and three [C. albicans (n = 2), C. glabrata] isolates were intermediate to amphotericin B and ketoconazole by Neo-Sensitabs method, but the same strains were susceptible to these antifungals by standard method. In this situation minor errors were calculated 0.01% for amphotericin B, and 0.03% for ketoconazole by Neo-Sensitabs method.",

Menichetti (Pisa, IT) Objectives: To study the activity of antifungal agents against Candida spp strains isolated from invasive candidiasis and to assess the fungicidal activity of amphotericin B, caspofungin and anidulafungin. Fungicidal activity of azoles was not studied because they are considered fungistatic. Methods: All the strains of Candida spp isolated from invasive candidiasis in Pisa Hospital in the 2009-2010 period were studied. MICs of all strains were performed with the Sensititre method under manufacturer instructions. All the wells without growth of yeast were sub-cultured in order to measure the fungicidal activity of amphotericin B, caspofungin and anidulafungin. Minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC) of these drugs was defined by a 99,9% reduction of the inoculum. Results: Thirty-three Candida spp isolates were included in this study. Thirty strains were isolated from blood, 1 from liver abscess, 1 from vertebral osteomyelitis, 1 from peritonitis. Among these strains, C. albicans were 17 strains and Candida non-albicans 16 strains (7 C. parapsilosis, 4 C. glabrata, 3 C. tropicalis and 2 C. krusei). MIC 50 and MIC 90 for all strains are shown in table 1. All antifungal agents, except amphotericin B have an increase of MIC 90 for Candida nonalbicans strains, with an increase of several dilutions with respect to those of C. albicans strains. MFC50 and MFC90 are shown in table 1. MFC50 and MFC90 of amphotericin B were 2 mg/L and between 4 and 8 mg/L, instead values for echinocandins were superior especially for Candida non-albicans. Conclusion: Candida non-albicans strains have elevated MICs for all antifungal agents. Amphotericin B fungicidal activity is superior to that of echinocandins, especially among Candida non-albicans strains. If this activity might be used in the clinical ground has to be studied. H. Bernhardt*, M. Knoke, G. Schwesinger, J. Bufler, J. Bernhardt (Greifswald, Berlin, Rostock, DE) Objectives: We investigated the antifungal effect of anidulafungin (AND) or voriconazole (VRC) on biofilms and MIC values of different Candida species in a small tube system of continuous flow culture. Methods: We carried out 21 experiments with 23 strains. Strains of C. albicans (Ca), C. glabrata (Cgl), C. tropicalis (Ct), C. krusei (Ck), C. parapsilosis (Cp), C. orthopsilosis (Co), C. metapsilosis (Cm), C. lusitaniae (Cl) and C. guilliermondii (Cgui) from blood culture isolates were grown in small tubes (V = 0.48 ml). Peptone-yeast extract (0.5%/0.2%) + 50 mM glucose\u00b1AND (8 mg/l) or VRC (16 mg/l) was supplied at very low flow rates (1.3 ml/h). The flow in the tube was 63-times within 24 h. Biomass production, glucose concentration as metabolic activity, pH and planktonic CFUs were measured. MIC testing was performed by Etest \u00ae on RPMI. Morphology of adherent fungal cells was assessed microscopically after staining with lactophenol cotton blue. Results: In the tube system the development of biofilm varied from species and strains and took place after 2 or 3 days. After continuous input of AND the production stopped in case of sensible species like Ca or Ct, but the metabolic activity measured by glucose concentration did seldom reach the beginning concentration. This could partly be shown after continuous input of VRC. Different strains of Cp showed different results against AND, but there was no increase of resistance in these long term trials up to 10 days. Biofilm of strains with a low susceptibility against AND like some Cp strains or candidaemia strains of Cl or Cgui stopped growth after input of VRC as also metabolic activity did so. Conclusion: The small tube system is a model to get some information from biofilms of different Candida strains under conditions of long term cultivation with supply of low nutrition more similar to real conditions than batch culture. -3 protocol) . Results: During the study period a total of 142 episodes of candidemia occurred in 129 patients, accounting for a global incidence of 12.1 episodes/10,000 in-patients. Median age of the patients was 56 years and 58% of them were males. The most common species isolated was C. albicans (79 episodes, 55.6%), followed by C. parapsilosis (26 episodes, 18.3%), C. glabrata (18 episodes,12.7%), C. tropicalis (10 episodes, 7.0%), C. guilliermondii (4 episodes, 2.8%), C. krusei (3 episodes, 2.1%), C. dubliniensis and C. norvegensis (1 episode, 0.8%). During the study period the incidence of candidemia increased from 7.1 to 18.5 episodes/10,000 in-patients (p < 0,01). C. glabrata and C. krusei fungemia occurred more frequently in patients admitted to intensive care units (p = 0.04). All the isolates resulted susceptible to voriconazole, posaonazole, amphotericin B and to the three echinocandins The susceptibility rate of fluconazole and itraconazole was 99.3 and 72.5%, respectively. The antifungal agents tested had the following MICs90: fluconazole 8 mg/dl, itraconazole 2 mg/dl, mg/dl voriconazole 0.125, mg/dl posaconazole 0.5, amphotericin B 1 mg/dl, caspofungin 0.5 mg/dl, anidulafungin 2 mg/dl, and micafungin 2 mg/dl. Conclusions: Candidemia is still a frequent complication among hospitalized patients. We observed a progressive increase during the study period; this trend could be due to the increase of immunocompromised patients admitted to our institution, in particular hematological patients, solid organ transplant recipients and surgical patients admitted to intensive care units. Nevertheless, C. albicans remained the prevalent species and the resistance rates to antifungal agents were very low.",

All adult patients with ICU-acquired BSI due to Candida, excluding patients with neutropenia, malignancy or AIDS, between 2007-2009 were included. Potential factors occurring up to 30 days before candidemia, including demographic characteristics, comorbidities, exposure to antibiotics and antifungals, ICU-related factors (i.e TPN, invasive procedures) and outcome were determined. Antifungal susceptibility testing was performed using broth microdilution assay method described by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute. Results: Clinical characteristics of the patients were presented in the Table. Seventy-six cases (59,4%) of candidemia were due to C. albicans and 52 (40,6%) to NAC spp. Distribution of the first three NAC spp. was C. tropicalis (22/52, 42,3%), C. glabrata (12/52, 23,1%) and C. parapsilosis (9/52, 17,3%). Multivariate logistic regression analysis of the factors showed that presence of glucocorticosteroid treatment and a central venous catheter were variables independently associated with BSI due to NAC, compared with BSI due to C. albicans (P:0,001, OR: 7,18, 95% CI: 2,22\u221223,22; and P0,001, OR: 20,13, 95% CI: 3,64-111,18, respectively). A total of 65 patients died within 30 days of the diagnosis of candidemia. The mortality rate was higher in those with NAC than C. albicans BSI (61,5% vs 43.4%) and candidemia due to NAC spp. was independently associated with death (P: 0.04). Except for one C. lusitaniae strain, which was resistant to amphotericin B and four C. glabrata strains, which were fluconazole susceptible dose dependent, all Candida species were susceptible to fluconazole, caspofungin, voriconazole and amphotericin B. Conclusion: Presence of a central venous catheter and glucocorticosteroid treatment were significantly associated with BSI due to NAC. BSI due to NAC was significantly associated with death, compared with BSI due to C. albicans. The in-vitro activity of fluconazole is encouraging, and this agent, an efficacious, inexpensive and safe drug, can continue to play an important role in the management of invasive candidiasis.",

However, it may be indicator of urinary tract infection (UTI) or invasive infection. The study aimed to determine the significance of candiduria in neoplastic pts. Patients and Methods: Adult pts with neoplasia and positive urine cultures for Candida, admitted to the Oncology or Haematology department of the University Hospital of Heraklion, Greece from 2005 to 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. Results: Seventy one pts with candiduria were identified. Of them 48 (68%) were males. The median age was 71 (range 40\u221288). The underlying disease was solid tumor in 51 (72%) and hematologic malignancy in 20 (28%). The most frequent risk factor was use of urinary catheter or nephrostomy (69%), followed by antimicrobial treatment (60%), corticosteroids (42%), anatomic malformations of the urinary tract (29%), neutropenia (24%) and diabetes mellitus (21%). Fever was present on admission in 59 (83%). Nineteen pts (27%) had dysuria. Flank pain and vomiting were prominent clinical features in 7 (10%) and 5 (7%) pts respectively. UTI by established criteria was present in 51 (72%). Among the 71 positive urine cultures, C. albicans was isolated in 44 (62%), and non-albicans in 27 (38%) [C. tropicalis 9 out of 27 (33%), C. parapsilosis 7 (26%) C. glabrata 6 (22%), C. famata 3 (11%), C. guilliermondii 1 (4%) and C. lusitaniae 1 (4%)]. Blood cultures were obtained from 59 (83%) and were positive in 15 (21%). However, only 4 pts (6%) had Candida in their blood. Death occurred in 26 (37%) pts with candiduria. Factors associated with death included disease progression in 7 (27%) and sepsis syndrome in 19 (73%). Candida spp. has been present in the blood of 2 pts who died.

This study was conducted to investigate the aetiological agents and the clinical variants of dermatophytoses, in Western Greece during a 8-year period (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) (2010) . Methods: A total of 3210 samples (skin scales, nail and hair fragments) obtained from 2616 patients with suspected dermatomycoses referred to the laboratory of Clinical Microbiology at the University Hospital of Ioannina, Greece. The causative agents were identified by direct microscopy and culture. Results: Dermatophytes were isolated from 524 patients (20.03%), mainly adults. The most common type of infection was onychomycosis (34.6%) followed by tinea pedis (28.5%), tinea corporis (18.5%), tinea cruris (8.5%), tinea capitis (4.6%), tinea manum (4.0%) and tinea facei (1.3%). In forty seven patients the same dermatophyte was isolated from two different sites of infection. The frequency for all types of tineas was higher in males than in females, while males exceeded females in cases of tinea corporis and tinea facei. Trichophyton rubrum was the most prevalent dermatophyte species isolated from 51.5% of the 607 positive samples, followed by T. mentagrophytes (20.3%), Microsporum canis (8.2%), Epidermophyton floccosum (5.4%), T. violaceum (3.0%), Trichophyton spp (1.8%) and M. gypseum (1.7%). Other species as T. tonsurans, T. verrucosum and T. schoenleinii were occasionally isolated. Conclusion: In our region, Trichophyton rubrum is the most common aetiological agent in all types of dermatophytoses except of tinea capitis and tinea facei. The epidemiological data collected would serve as reference for future research while many factors that contribute to the change of prevalence of dermatophytoses alter to the pass of time. Background: Voriconazole (VRZ) remains the first line therapy for invasive aspergillosis. Because some Aspergillus species are resistant to azoles and because the prognosis or aspergillosis remains poor; antifungal combinations could be of interest. We tested here the in vitro combination of Anidulafungin (ANI) and VRZ against azole susceptible or resistant Aspergillus spp by two different methods. Methods: Thirty clinical isolates of Aspergillus spp from five various Aspergillus species identified by b-tubulin sequencing were tested. The ANI-VRZ combination was evaluated using checkerboard (CK) based on the CLSI broth microdilution method M38-A3 and using an agar diffusion technique (Etest). For CK, final inoculums were 10 4 /mL. After 48h at 35\u00baC, both MIC and MEC were recorded visually. The fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICI) was interpreted as synergic if FICI 0.5, no interaction if 0.5 < FICI < 4 and antagonistic if FICI 4. Tests were run in duplicates. For Etest, MIC of VRZ and ANI were determined alone as well as in combination after 48h at 35\u00baC. In combination, ANI strip was placed on agar for 1h, removed and then VRZ strip was applied over demarcation left from previous strip. Synergy and antagonism were defined respectively as a decrease or an increase of 3 dilutions of the resultant MIC. Results: Using CK method, there was no interaction between VRZ and ANI with MEC as endpoint (table) except for 1 A. nidulans isolate for which an antagonism was shown. Using Etest, no interaction was observed in 27 isolates. According to the endpoint used, an antagonism or a synergism was observed for 2 and 1 A. calidoustus isolates, respectively. Conclusions: Overall no in vitro interaction was shown between VRZ and ANI against most of the azole susceptible or resistant Aspergillus isolates by using different techniques. Confirmation of these results in vivo is warranted.",

Results: Species distribution varied by age, prior antifungal treatment (more isolates with intrinsic reduced fluconazole susceptibility P = 0.007) and clinical specialty (61% C. glabrata and C. krusei at haematology wards versus 29%, P = 0.002). Colonisation samples were not predictive for the invasive species in 11/100 cases with species identification. Blood culture positivity varied by system, species and procedure. Thus, cultures drawn via arterial lines or with C. glabrata needed longer incubation and cases with concomitant bacteraemia were less common using BacT/ALERT compared to the BACTEC system (9% (11/124) versus 28% (53/192); P < 0.0001). 56% of the patients had undergone surgery, 51% were ICU patients and 33% had malignant disease. Mortality varied by age (increasing by age, P = 0.009), species (numerically highest for C. krusei 36%, lowest for C. parapsilosis 25% and other Candida species 14%), severity of underlying disease (47% in ICU patients versus 24%; P = 0.0001), and choice but not timing of initial therapy (12% versus 48% in patients with C. glabrata receiving caspofungin versus fluconazole, P = 0.023). Initial antifungal choice was deemed suboptimal upon species identification in 15% of the cases, which would have been 6.5% had current guidelines been followed. Conclusion: A high proportion of Danish fungaemia patients were severely ill and received sub-optimal initial antifungal treatment.",

Methods: It is a retrospective observational case series involving patients of culture proven fungal keratitis from April 2008 to March 2010 attending to the cornea clinic of a tertiary care eye hospital in eastern India. Among the 144 fungal keratitis cases 66 (45.83%) cases were identified for analysis. The ulcer size, organism, treatment modalities and MIC value were analyzed. Voriconazole was used either topically (2%), or in AC wash (50 mg/0.1 ml),) and Intrastomally (50 mg/0.1 ml). Results: Among 66 cases, 39 showed healing with corneal scar formation while 27 underwent therapeutic keratoplasty. 25 cases (64.10%) required topical use, 9 cases (23.07%) required intracameral use and 5 (12.82%) cases required intrastomal administration. Among filamentous fungi Aspergillus sp responded well (25/66;37.87%) followed by Fusarium sp (5/66;7.57%),unidentified sp (3/66;4.54%), and equal no of Penicillium sp, Scedosporium sp, and Cladosporium sp (2/66;3.03%). Among the cases undergoing therapeutic keratoplasty Candida keratitis was maximum with 11 cases followed by 7 cases of Fusarium sp, 5 cases of Aspergillus sp and 2 case each of Alternaria sp and Penicillium sp. In relation with ulcer size response to voriconazole therapy obtained in (20/39;51.28%) where ulcer size is <6 mm and remaining (19/39;48.71%) cases where ulcer size is >6 mm. The minimal inhibitory concentration of voriconazole was 0.125 mg/ml against Aspergillus sp and 0.5 mg/ml against Fusarium sp. Candida sp showed resistance activity upto 2% of voriconazole. Conclusion: Voriconazole has promising activity against filamentous fungi and may prove useful in the management of fungal keratitis but it shows no response in Candida keratitis from our centre.",

One week later, he complained of occipital headache, followed by a focal seizure starting at right hand, and then he developed secondarily generalized tonic-conic seizures. Computed tomography scan of the brain was performed. A 5x6 cm hypodensity lesion was noted over the left frontoparietal region. Intravenous ceftriaxone 4 gm/day and metronidazole 1,500 mg/day were prescribed. One week later, fever was still persisted and right-sided weakness was worsened. Personal and past medical history: This patient was diagnosed with b-thalassemia haemoglobin E disease. The pertinent physical findings were high grade fever, significant left carotid bruit, right facial palsy and spastic right hemiparesis. MRI brain showed a large rim-enhancing brain lesion over the left hemisphere. MRA showed multiple aneurysms at left common and internal carotid arteries. His serum was tested for antibody against pythiosis using 3 different techniques, which were ELISA, immunodiffusion and Western blot. The results of all the tests were positive. We also prescribed itraconazole, terbinafine and P. insidiosum antigen immunotherapy, but the patient eventually died from brain herniation. Autopsy revealed gross pus at left frontal area. The left common and internal carotid arteries also found 2 cm in diameter of aneurysm. Pus Wright's stains showed hyphae with infrequently septate and branching. Tissue culture from his brain was confirmed the diagnosis of pythiosis by isolation the organism and proof by Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with specific primers in the COX II region. Discussion: We couldn't eradicate infected brain tissue as well as infected carotid arteries because of the area of brain and carotid artery involvements were harmful to resection. Cerebral pythiosis should be the differential diagnoses of brain abscess in thalassemic patients. Early recognition and prompt surgical treatment should be considered to reduce mortality or morbidity.",

His immmunity was further impaired by a previously unrecognised hematological malignancy, hairy cell leukemia. The degree of dissemination was so severe that the organism, S. schenckii, was isolated from blood cultures while using standard automated culture techniques. His infection was initially refractory to antifungal therapy with traditional amphotericin B, in part due to drug toxicity. Treatment with liposomal amphotericin B and oral posaconazole, along with treatment of his underlying leukemia, resulted in dramatic clinical improvement with no residual evidence of infection. The immunological defects associated with this malignancy, as well as the management of refractory sporotrichosis are reviewed. All of them were grown in Sabouraud dextrose agar (SDA) for 24 and 48 hours at 30\u00baC. We looked for macroscopic morphology in SDA and microscopic morphology in Corn Meal agar. We differenced saccharomyces cerevisiae from other yeast by chromogenic medium (CHROMagar\u2122 Candida) and by test of assimilation of sugars (auxacolor\u2122, BIO-RAD). Risk factors in this study: previous use of antibiotic/antifungal, probiotics based in S. cerevisiae, hospitalization and immunosuppression. We followed clinical and microbiological criterias to prove if we were in an infection or colonization. Results: Risks factor weren't brake down into their different headings due to the difficulty of ensuring that patients received Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Ultralevura \u00ae ). Only we found that only patients admitted with chronic diarrhea and elderly in hospital received probiotic. In community was impossible to know.

Conclusion: Contrary to popular perception of low incidence of fungal keratitis in this region, high incidence has been found in this study. It can be attributed to increasing trend towards farming activity in this region which predisposes the people to vegetative injury. Seasonal variations throughout the year in this region leads to altered tear film which again could be a major predisposing factor. Increasing use of the contact lenses also predisposes the users to contact lens related infection. Diabetes mellitus was found in some patients which can be a predisposing factor.",

Collomp (Nice, FR) Candidaemia are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitals, especially among severe patients. Over the past decade, the epidemiology and antifungal therapies have evolved. Our university hospital is committed since 2005 in a multidisciplinary approach to help diagnosis and treatment of invasive fungal infections (IFI) initially focused on costly treatments. Our objectif was to study trends in epidemiology, susceptibility, and antifungal use in our hospital. Methods: All patients with a blood culture yielding yeast between January 2007 and December 2009 were included. Patient data, epidemiology, susceptibility, treatments and interventions of our antifungal team were collected from computerized patient records, the Mycology Laboratory and the Pharmacy. Results: 74 patients were included. During this period a diversification of yeast species was observed, with a significant reduction of Candida albicans (25% in 2009 vs 52% in 2007) . The rate of resistance to fluconazole has not exceeded 6% among strains of Candida and the first strain of Candida parapsilosis resistant to caspofungin was isolated in 2009. First line antifungal treatments have been established according to local recommendations (96%). The antifungal team has intervened for nearly 80% of patients in 2009, to continue the initial antifungal treatment or to propose a de-escalation therapy (20%). In 2009, 45% of patients (11/24) died, underlyng the severity of those IFI. Conclusion: This work has underlined our local specificity both in terms of epidemiology (most important decrease in Candida albicans compared the litterature), and in terms of multidisciplinary management of IFI. Among the proposals from this study include the systematic monitoring of Candidaemia during our antifungal team meetings wathever the drug and the search for a possible nosocomial cause of these severe infections.",

Our aim was to review the cases of histoplasmosis diagnosed in our hospital. Methods: Review the diagnostic methods employed and clinical characteristics of cases of histoplasmosis diagnosed during the last six years. Case reports: We diagnosed 4 cases, three of whom were HIV positive (male, 28\u221243 years) and one patient (female 50 years) treated with immunosuppressive drugs. All of them were from South America. The spectrum of disease in HIV positive patients was one liver disease, one pulmonary and one gastrointestinal. Two had a good outcome but the other, in spite of treatment with amphotericin B, had a rapidly progress to a multiorganic failure and died. The female had a liver histoplasmosis and she also had a good clinical response. The treatment in all cases was amphotericin B 5 mg/kg/day (two weeks) followed by itraconazole 200 mg/12h. The laboratory diagnosis was carried out by histological (PAS and PAS-Diastase Stain) and microbiological study (culture and PCR directly): in three cases, we isolated H. capsulatum var. capsulatum and in the other, the microbiological diagnosis was thanks a direct PCR in the tissue. Conclusion: Most infected people by histoplasmosis remain asymptomatic, but they can develop serious clinical forms depending on the level of exposure and the patient's immune status. Usually, severe forms are seen in HIV positive patients, but as has occurred in our series of cases it's also possible in patients with immunosuppressive therapy. In our country, histoplasmosis is an imported infection and because of this it is necessary to have a high index of suspicion and perform a detailed history to get a diagnosis. It is an infection to be considered in the differential diagnosis in immunosuppressed patients, both HIV positive and immunosuppressive therapy, which originate from endemic areas or who have a history of stay in them.",

Plahouras, T. Panagea, L. Zerva, G. Petrikkos, A. Armaganidis (Athens, GR) Objectives: Candidemia is frequently encountered in the nosocomial setting, particularly in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) causing considerable morbidity and mortality. The increasing incidence of non-albicans Candida species could also be important. The aim of the present study was to record the epidemiology, risk factors, mortality, strains susceptibility to antifungal drugs. This is a clinical and microbiological retrospective study of all fungemia episodes registered in two medicalsurgical ICUs between 1/1/2005 and 31/12/2009. The records of the research laboratory of the 4th department of Internal Medicine, the microbiology department of Attikon university hospital and the microbiology department of Thriassion Hospital were used in order to identify patients. Medical records were then retrieved. Special forms were completed for each patient including demographic information, concomitant conditions, Apache II and Sofa severity scores the day of ICU admission, the risk factors within the preceding 10 days, data of colonization and candidemia related information. Results: Attikon hospital is a 640-bed teaching tertiary care hospital with a 25-bed medical and surgical ICU and Thriassion hospital is a 433-bed tertiary care hospital with an ICU with 8 beds. During the study period a total of 1663 pts were hospitalized in both ICUs. Among them 67 patients developed fungemia. Median patients' age was 56 years. Median ICU length of stay was 37 days. Medical cause of admission was present in 31 cases. Species isolated were C. albicans (38.8%), C. parapsilosis, C. tropicalis (8,9%), C.spp, C. glabrata, and non-albicans spp. Median time elapsed between ICU admission and candidemia was 19 days. Mean Apache II score was 19 on the day of admission and overall mortality was 50.7%. Attributable mortality was 55,9%. Ostrosky prediction rule was positive in 41 patients. Urine or lung colonization was present in 20.5%,and multiple site colonization in 29%. Fifteen pts were submitted to an intraabdominal operation. Fifteen pts received TPN prior to candidemia episode. Caspofungin was the most commonly introduced treatment. Conclusions: Compared to other blood infections fungemias are not common among our patients but they are often lethal. A high Apache II score at admission, multiple site colonization in combination with abdominal surgery should raise a high suspicion index and a prophylactic therapy should start. Non-albicans species are on the rise. In 2009 the most isolations were in May (8.53%) and August (5.00%) and in 2010 were in July (5.44%) and in October (8.23%) as cause of onychomycosis. No dermatophytes were isolated more than these. Conclusions: Confirmation of the diagnosis should be considered as essential. A bad treatment predispose to advanced invasion with dermatophytes and/or other molds. We should assay sensibility to antifungals in our area. ",

Conventional methods of classification based on morphological, biochemical and physiological features have proven ineffective in accurately identifying such species. Candida haemulonii has been reported among uncommon yeasts with decreased susceptibility to antifungal agents causing human disease. We have reviewed the identification and antifungal susceptibility results of a collection of clinical isolates of C. haemulonii. Methods: A total of 10 isolates, received in our institution over 10-year period (2001-2010) , were evaluated. One of them was isolated from blood and the other nine strains were recovered from superficial sites. They were identified by morphology and biochemical tests. In addition, molecular identification was done by sequencing of ribosomal DNA (ITS domain). Susceptibility testing followed the recommendations proposed by the EUCAST. Results: A total of 90% (9/10) isolates were not discriminated by phenotyping and strains were classified as unidentifiable according to their biochemical profile. One strain (10%) was misidentified as Candida sake. Objectives: Candida spp. is the fourth most common pathogen causing nosocomial blood stream infections and invasive infections in immunocompromised and seriously ill patients. Methods: Two retrospective data sets each with 100 patients from the time periods 1985-1990 (period 1) and 2001-2005 (period 2) respectively were evaluated. All patients whose data were included into this study have been diagnosed with candidemia at the University Hospital of Vienna, a 2200-bed referral centre. The aim of the study was to identify changes in the epidemiology, the clinical manifestation and the outcome in these two groups. The demographic dissemination in terms of age, gender etc. was analysed as well as differences in underlying diseases in both periods. The duration of hospitalisation and time until Candida albicans isolation from blood culture were determined. The progress of candidemia, the success of therapy and the mortality rate in these two periods were evaluated. Results: During period 1 significantly more patients with proven candidemia were found at Intensive Care Units, in period 2 significantly more at medical wards. The main hospitalisation duration until isolation of candida was 23 days in period 1 and 27,9 days in period 2.",

Methods: From January to February 2010, all Candida spp. isolated from patients hospitalized in medical and surgical ICU, adults and paediatrics HU and RTU from 8 French university hospitals were collected. C. albicans was identified using chromogenic agar media, and screened with BichroDubli \u00ae (Sofibel) to identify C. dubliniensis. C. krusei and C. glabrata were identified with KruseiColor \u00ae (Sofibel) and Glabrata RTT \u00ae (Sofibel), respectively. All other Candida spp. were identified using ID32C \u00ae (BioM\u00e9rieux). Unequivocal identification using rDNA sequencing was done for all C. glabrata, C. parapsilosis, C. kefyr, C. inconspicua/norvegensis, and those with ID32C identification score <95%. In vitro antifungal susceptibility was determined by E-test \u00ae (BioM\u00e9rieux). First isolate of each Candida sp. from each different body site was tested in each patient. were C. glabrata. Isolates with non-susceptibility to caspofungin were C. guilliermondii (n = 2) and C. parapsilosis (n = 1). Conclusion: This epidemiological study conducted on a short period of time allowed us to point out differences in Candida spp. isolated from different clinical units and body sites.

C. dubliniensis is not routinely identified in most of clinical laboratories in the Czech Republic. The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of C. dubliniensis in human clinical material, especially in stool samples. Three common phenotypic methods were used for discriminating C. dubliniensis from C. albicans (the color of colonies on CHROMagar Candida, the inability to grow at 42 \u00baC and the colony morphology on Staib medium). The identification of C. dubliniensis was verified by polymerase chain reaction with the species-specific primer pair and universal primer pair. The experiments took place from December 2007 to December 2010. We have collected almost 500 samples from the gastrointestinal tract and about 1500 isolates from the airways and oropharynx, all of which were originally identified in the laboratories as C. albicans. Two to three % of these isolates were identified as C. dubliniensis. The incidence in the oropharynx and airways (3%) was significantly higher than in the stool samples (2%). The significance of the finding lies primarily in the fact that only a small number of publications deals with this particular clinical specimen and that not many publications about the incidence of C. dubliniensis in any other clinical materials have been published in Czech republic.

We also compare the performance of POS prophylaxis with an historical, well matched, control group of AML pts who received prophylaxis with Fluconazole (FLUCO) or Itraconazole (ITRA). Patients and Results: Fifty-five unselected and consecutive AML pts received POS prophylaxis (600 mg daily) between Jan 2009 and Oct 2010. Median age of this population was 47 yrs (range 18\u221269). All cases were given chemotherapy with anthracyclines and cytarabine. The POS was started when neutrophil (PMN) count was less than 1000 mL and was stopped at PMN recovery. The median duration of severe neutropenia (PMN lower than 500 mL) was 15 days (range 7\u221241); 10/55 (18%) of cases had an oral mucositis grade II-III CTC (common toxicity criteria) and 73% (40/55) of these pts received a proton pump inhibitor. An active diagnostic work up was made in all cases with Galactomannan assay, standard chest X-ray and thoracic CT scan in case of fever (FUO) lasting over 48 hours.

Nguyen (Pittsburgh, US) Background: The diagnosis of invasive asperigllosis (IA) is limited by poor sensitivity and specificity of microbiologic cultures, and the inability of conventional histopathologic tests to distinguish IA from invasive fungal infections (IFI) caused by non-Aspergillus moulds. Aspergillus-specific immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH) could facilitate direct diagnosis of IA within tissue. Methods: IHC and ISH were performed on deparaffinized, formalinfixed sections from previously diagnosed cases of proven IFI, and slides interpreted by pathologist blinded to diagnosis. IHC: Primary Aspergillus antibody (Abcam, MA) and secondary anti-rabbit antibody were detected with Avidin Biotin Complex and visualized using liquid DAB. ISH: Commercially synthesized Locked Nucleic Acid probe for Aspergillus was detected using antiflourescein AP. Poly T stained tissue section was used to determine the area of tissue to be studied. Results: 8 tissue sections were available from patients with IA (A. fumigatus = 5; A. niger = 1; non-speciated = 2, and 12 sections were available from patients with IFI due to other fungi (Zygomyces = 6; Candida = 5; Dactylaria gallopava = 1). IA samples were obtained from 6 tissue biopsies (3 lungs, 2 upper airways, 1 vocal cord), and 2 autopsy samples. 2 serial sections from one patient with IA due to A. fumigatus were excluded from the study because positive control stains were negative. The sensitivity of IHC and ISH for IA was 83% (5/6) and 100% (6/6), respectively. IHC was falsely negative in 1 pt with IA due to A. fumigatus. The specificity of IHC and ISH was 100% (12/12), as the tests were each negative in all sections associated with IFI due to non-Aspergillus fungi. IHC was associated with significant levels of non-specific background staining in 33% of the sections that could be analyzed, compared to 0% for ISH. Conclusion: Data from this pilot study suggest that Aspergillus-specific IHC and ISH will facilitate diagnosis of IA and exclude IFI due to non-Aspergillus fungi. ISH was superior to IHC by limiting false negative results and non-specific background staining. We are currently assessing IHC and ISH prospectively on non-fixed tissues. Objectives: Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is increasing in frequency and associated with mortality exceeding 70% in some series. We conducted this study to find out the approximate incidence of IPA in patients hospitalized with acute exacerbation of COPD (AECOPD), its true mortality and to identify potential factors associated with mortality.",

Charts were retrospectively reviewed and patients were classified into probable IPA and colonization. Results: We identified 68 patients admitted in the last 3 years with AECOPD and aspergillus isolation. Thirty-seven (54%) had COPD stage III-IV. Forty-six (68%) were male and median age was 69 (55\u221290). Fifty-five patients (81%) had increased dyspnoea and 52 (76%) had radiological alterations, mostly new infiltrates in chest x-ray. Thirty-nine (57%) received >700 mg of steroids during admittance and 16 (24%) had received >20 mg/day during the past 3 months. Twenty patients (28%) had more than one aspergillus isolation. Twenty four patients (35%) received voriconazole for a median of 19 days (1\u221250 days). Crude mortality was 21% (14/68). Patients with COPD stage III-IV were older (71 vs 63 years, p = 0,02) and had higher mortality, 13/37 (35%) vs 3/32 (9%) (p = 0, 01, OR: 3, 9 CI95: 1, (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . Similarly, patients with COPD stage III-IV received more frequently high dose steroids 28/37 (76%) vs 11/32 (34%), p < 0,001, and had more frequently increased dyspnoea during admittance, 36/37 (97%) vs 20/32 (62%), p < 0,001. Neither daily dose of steroids nor voiconazole therapy were associated with increased mortality. In multivariate analysis, only increase dyspnoea was significantly associated with mortality. Conclusion: COPD patients stage III-IV had increased mortality because of IPA although it is lower than described by other authors. Neither previous nor high steroid doses during admittance were associated with mortality.",

We performed a bivariate meta-analysis of sensitivity and specificity and constructed a hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristics (HSROC) curve. Results: Twelve studies were included in the meta-analysis. BDG data were provided for 334 PCP cases and 1663 controls. The pooled (95% confidence interval) sensitivity and specificity of BDG were 94.7% (90.2-97.2%) and 86.6% (81.5-90.5%), respectively.

The patients underwent chemotherapy or allogeneic stem cell transplantation for haematological malignancies and received itraconazole suspension prophylaxis. The study is ongoing. Methods: 48 neutropenic febrile episodes, 25 of which were refractory at 4 days to broad spectrum antibiotics initiated on day one, were studied. All patients had serum galactomannan assays (EIA) twice a week and trough itraconazole levels measured on day one of fever. If they were still febrile after 4 days, HRCT scan chest was performed. Antifungal treatment was required to be given only when well defined clinical, microbiological and radiological criteria were present. Invasive Fungal Disease ( Conclusions: The incidence of probable or proven IFD was 2%. Three patients with possible IFD died (all had received iv antifungal therapy). 20% of the patients overall had subtherapeutic itraconazole levels.

Vori (300-600 mg/day) or posa (800 mg/day) (adjusted by TDM) was given for at least 6 months if tolerated. Clinical, radiological and immunological evaluation was used to assess response. We defined response as improvement in symptoms and either fungal serology or radiological abnormalities. The rates of clinical response or failure and their adverse effects (AEs) after 3, 6, and 12 mos of treatment were analyzed. Co-existing diagnoses, Aspergillus antibody titre, vori and posa levels and lung function were used as covariates. Results: There were 27 patients, ABPA (n = 22) or SAFS (n = 5), 11 males, median age = 59 yrs. All patients had failed itra (n = 11) or developed AEs (n = 12), had low serum concs (n = 2) or itra resistance (n = 2). There were 34 courses of therapy analysed, 25 with vori and 9 with posa; only 2 posa courses were not preceded by vori (resistance). Clinical response to voriconazole was observed in 17/25 (68%) at 3 mos, 15/20 (75%) at 6 mos and 12/16 (75%) at 12 mos, compared to 7/9 (78%) at 3, 6 and 12 mos for posa. 6/25 (24%) vori pts had AEs requiring discontinuation before 6 mos compared to 0/9 posa patients. Vori AEs included GI upset (7), skin photosensitivity (11), blistering (4), visual light flashes (10), insomnia (2), visual hallucinations (2), depression (1), adrenal suppression (2), peripheral neuropathy (4), eye irritation (2), vivid dreams (1), dizziness (1) and headache (1) but most of them were transient and mild. Posa AEs included insomnia (2), GI upset and mild liver impairment. Among those who discontinued, 4 relapsed (one at 3 mo, 3 at 12 months).

Methods: The VERSANT HIV-1 RNA 1.0 Assay kit (kPCR, Siemens) is a procedure of kinetic polymerase chain reaction (kPCR) with reverse transcription (RT) for the direct quantification of HIV-1 RNA, with a range of detectability between 37 and 11.000.000 copies/mL. Below 37 copies, the system can still see some signal (SS) or no signal at all (NS), suggesting that the virus concentration in the sample in this case is extremely low.

All other sera from long-standing HIV infection had a high AI (average: 1.01+0.08), with no differences between B and non-B genotypes. Conclusions: These results may have relevant implication in understanding the complex mechanism of maturation of the immune response to HIV. We will expand our study to other patients with recent HIV-1 infection and to treated patients in order to confirm this preliminary data. 23.3% of controls were on chronic steroid therapy for various reasons, mainly COPD. Two of the controls were obese. Conclusions: Although the HIV associated immunosuppression may initially predict a more severe clinical course of influenza, our results suggest that evolution does not differ from not HIV-infected people. We found a higher frequency of smoking among HIV patients, with an odds ratio of 2.4. It is striking also the high occurrence of COPD in both groups, without differences between them.

Laboratory tests showed pancytopenia, elevated C-reactive protein and acute renal failure. Vast examinations for bacteria, mycobacteria, helminths, protozoas remained all negative. Upper and lower endoscopic bowel examination with tissue biopsies showed no evidence of disease. Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)positron emission tomography scan revealed a pathological FDG-uptake in lymphatic tissue. Immunohistochemical examination was positive for human herpes virus type 8 (HHV-8) latency-associated nuclear antigen ( Figure) , which allowed the diagnosis of multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD). A treatment with rituximab, etoposide and valganciclovir for six cycles was started. Ten months later, the patient was free from new febrile episodes, was working full-time and CT scan revealed a decreased size and number of lymph nodes. MCD is a HHV-8 associated lymphoproliferative disease and should be considered as a possible cause of episodic fever. Disease presentation varies widely and the optimal treatment-regime is not yet established. Improvement of the immune system and treatment of the underlying disease is crucial. Antiviral agents have been successfully investigated. A promising approach for treatment in selected cases is rituximab. Antineoplastic agents such as etoposide or vinblastine are highly active in preventing the evolution of MCD towards lymphoma. Because of the unspecific findings, MCD can be difficult to diagnose in the setting of episodic fever and malaise.",

Objectives: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is more frequent and severe in HIV-infected patients than in the general population. We assessed the impact of a 3.5-year nurse intervention to improve immunity against HBV in patients from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS). The intervention was conducted in one center (intervention center) and 6 other centers were used as a comparator (control centers). Methods: SHCS participants who were seronegative for HbsAg and anti-HBc in January 2007 were included in the study groups and followed up until June 2010. Non immune patients (anti-HBs <10 IU/L) and patients with unknown immunity were eligible for nurse intervention, consisting of (1) documenting HBV serostatus in patients with previously missing information, (2) providing vaccination (3 doses with a minimal interval of 1 and 6 months) to non-immune patients, (3) measuring vaccination effectiveness 1 month after the 3rd dose and (4) providing a second course of vaccination to non-responders. Results: A total of 238 and 2712 patients seronegative for HbsAg and anti-HBc were included in the intervention and control centers, respectively ( Figure 1 ). Between 2007 and 2010, the number of patients with absent immunity decreased from 124 (52%) to 56 (24%) in the intervention center, and from 1658 (61%) to 1505 (55%) in the control centers (P < 0.001). The number of patients with undocumented immunity decreased from 76 (32%) to 0 (0%) in the intervention center, and from 174 (6%) to 131 (5%) in the control centers (P < 0.001).",

Sixty six patients (65%) had HBsAg checked but only one was positive. Fifty nine (58%) patients had a viral load measured and 31 (30%) had the virus genotype checked. The AST was measured in 75 (74%) patients. 99 patients were HBsAg positive. These tests were requested by above specialist teams in 43 (43%) patients. HIV serology was checked in 63 (64%) patients and this was positive in 6 (10%). 52 (53%) had HCV antibody checked. 49 (49%) patients had a HBV viral load checked and AST was measured in 77 (78%) patients. One patient was positive for HBV, HCV and HIV. Conclusions: HIV testing in hepatitis B and C patients is far from universal, however the same applies to testing for a second blood borne hepatitis virus in these patients. The laboratory currently recommends referral to gastroenterology services in cases of positive viral hepatitis B & C markers on the reports. This should be extended to include considering testing for other blood borne viruses including HIV. The results suggest that a substantial number of requests did not come from the specialist teams in the hospital suggesting they may not have been involved with all patients. Further investigation is warranted to establish the targets for further education.",

Therefore the gp120-CD4 interaction is critical for virus-cell fusion. The gp120 region that binds CD4 is the target of the broadly neutralizing antibody B12. The B12 antibody targets gp120 and recognizes a highly conserved epitope overlapping the CD4-binding region of gp120. This antibody is one of the four known human monoclonal antibodies identified that can efficiently neutralize a broad array of primary isolates of HIV-1 in vitro and can protect against viral challenge in vivo. The goal of this project is to evaluate the potential of CD4 targeting and virus-cell fusion inhibition of HIV-1 by a single domain antibody grafted with the gp120 highly conserved epitope recognized by the B12 antibody. This will be done using the 23 amino acids loop of gp120, grafted at the CDR1 of a highly stable rabbit single domain VL antibody, and designated VL-B12. The potential of this VL-B12 construct has been tested for CD4 binding by ELISA assay against soluble CD4 and by FACS analysis using HeLa, HeLa-P4, 293T and Jurkat cell lines. VL-B12 is highly specific and exhibits a high binding to CD4 in the conditions tested. Preliminary inhibition assays performed in Jurkat cells, a Human T lymphocyte cell line, in the presence of the VL-B12 construct show no apparent HIV-1NL4\u22123 inhibition, indicating that VL-B12-CD4 binding alone is not sufficient to block virus-cell fusion and that a steric effect due to the presence of a larger molecule may be necessary for HIV-1 fusion inhibition. The VL-B12 is being tested in Cell-to-cell inhibition assays and standard Jurkat cell line inhibition assays in interaction with different molecules to further evaluate its HIV-1 inhibition potential.",

To fill these gaps, the CCH Fever project proposes to create a multidisciplinary collaborative research environment by bringing together selected competitive advantages such as: operative capacity with appropriate high security research facilities, reference centers and clinical samples from endemic areas and an international network of e xperienced researchers. This multidisciplinary research consortium will facilitate the progress in several key research areas of the field. This program will mainly focus on (i) developing sensitive and biosafe stateof-art diagnostic tools for CCHFV, (ii) gathering the forces and resources in Europe to build a Biobank of clinical samples, (iii) building a comprehensive database consisting in clinical, laboratory and surveillance data, (iv) taking advantage of unique and state-of-art tools to progress towards vaccine candidates and specific antivirals against this bio-treat and (v) disseminating the appropriate knowledge to the health care workers in endemic regions and contributing to capacity building. These achievements will provide tools for local and European public health authorities to prevent or counter future outbreaks and monitor the spread of the disease thanks to the established novel and unique tools and resources. All patients were examined by gynecologist. There was drawn the biopsy material from cervical canal of uterus, the blood serum in each patient. At the time of relapse a PCR method and a fluorescence immunoassay were used for detection of HSV2 in biopsy material and immunoglobulin G to HSV2 in serum respectively. Also urinalysis and urine culture were done. All patients were treated by acyclovir. Results: All patients had a history of more than 4\u22128 episodes of LUTI per year. The most common complaints were frequent and painful urination, itch and burning. There was observed the relationship of LUTI relapses with menstrual cycle in each woman. The gynecological examination was displayed no abnormal changes in each patient. In the urinalysis there was revealed the increased amount of epitheliocytes only. All urine cultures were negative. All biopsy materials from cervical canal of uterus were negative for HSV2, but about 75% (45/60) patients with LUTI symptoms were found high level of immunoglobulin G to HSV2 (1:1600\u22121:3200) in blood serum.

The fluorescence immunoassay may be used in case of receiving negative PCR results. Results: In our study, 27 patients were enrolled due to M. marinum infections. Among thirty isolates, three were repetitively isolated from two patients. According to the criteria of clinical outcomes mentioned in methods, 18 patient's outcomes were successful, eight were failed, and one was lost to follow-up. Statistically, 8 failed and 1 lost to followup were pooled into \"not successful\" group. In \"successful\" group, the mean (\u00b1SD) age is 50.1 (\u00b121.6). In \"not successful\" group, the mean (\u00b1SD) age is 45.8 (\u00b119.3). Twelve patients had either fish tank contact or fishing hobby. Two had shrimp contact, and one played in a swimming pool. One received intra-articular steroid injection. Three patients got minor or superficial trauma on their extremities. Eight had no documents about their contact history. In successful group, 9 patients had ever received surgical debridement; in not-successful group, 1 patient had received surgical debridement (2sided Fisher's exact p = 0.0912). Conclusion: In Taiwan, this is the first study to unravel the relationship between clinical outcome and susceptibility testing of bacterial strain. Optimal anti-mycobacterial regimens have not well been established, all drugs had been reported as successful agents or failed agents. In our study, we cannot identify the risk factors of treatment failure, but the duration of prescribing clarithromycin, rifampicin, ethambutol, and doxycycline were different between \"successful\" group and \"notsuccessful\" group. Pulmonary NTM infection appears not to be a uniform disease. The clinical and radiological presentation varies, but seems independent of mycobacteria species involved. None of our patients progressed or deteriorated due to NTM-infection, four patients are cured. In our opinion this result was achieved because of thorough interdisciplinary discussions in the ID-board considering the clinical presentations, co-morbidities and expected drug-toxicities which led finally to a favourable outcome of our patients. Comparison between test in vivo (TST) and in-vitro (IGRA PPD) demostrated that IGRA performes better than TST when CD4 cells are below 500 cells/ml; TST is not useful in detecting immunological response to tubercular infection in case of immunodeficiency.

Schmit (Amiens, Rennes, Tourcoing, Caen, Lille, Rouen, FR) Introduction: Lymph node tuberculosis (LNTB) is the most frequent extrapumonary tuberculosis (TB), but some authors reported huge differences between duration of treatment instead of WHO 2003 recommendations for 6 to 9 months of antiTB therapy. We conducted a retrospective multiple centre study in the aim to describe the clinical factors for prolongation of antiTB drugs. Material and Method: We included retrospectively all patients who presented with at least LNTB during 1998-2010 periods from seven hospitals in North of France. TB was diagnosed either by culture or histology or clinical suspicion improving with antitubercular drugs. Five universities hospitals participated. We excluded from treatment duration analysis patients with bone and neurological involvement. Results: 148 patients were included, 57 of them were men (38.5%), and 58 (41.1%) were Africa born. Median age was 43.2 years (extremes 13.2-91.3). There were 21 (16.2%) HIV infected patients, 13 of them (54.2%) were diagnosed HIV positive at the same time at the TB diagnosis. Mean CD4 cell was 193.7/mm3\u00b1151. Forty two patients (28.8%) had another TB localisation (of whom 4 had bone or neurological involvement), 91 (61.9%) had superficial lymph nodes, 73 (49.6%) had cervical localisation only. Four (2.7%) patients died, 13 (8.8%) were lost of follow up. Duration treatment analysis was undertaken on 126 patients: median duration was 9 months (extremes 2\u221230). Treatment was significantly longer in HIV positive patients (p < 0.01), in patients with other TB localisation than lymph node (p < 0.01), in patients with loss of weight (p = 0.02), and if patient had presented new lymph node during treatment (p = 0.023). The treatment was significantly shorter when no complication occurred, and the main cause for treatment prolongation was non favourable evolution. Seven patients presented relapse, 2 have been treated for 9 months, 2 for 6 months, 2 for 4 months, one for 30 months before relapse. Conclusion: LNTB is treated much longer than WHO recommendations. Only 58% of treatment length is in accordance with 2003 recommendations, and 23% with 2009 recommendations which suggest that 6 months are sufficient for all extrapulmonary TB except for bone and neurological TB. Factors associated with treatment duration are HIV infection, loss of weight and other tuberculosis localisation.",

Methods: A total of 200 patients with T2D (100 with MA and 100 without MA) were recruited in the study. Patients with overt diabetic nephropathy or nephropathy from other causes, with symptoms of urinary track infection or use of antimicrobial drugs in the last 14 days were excluded by the study. Microalbuminuria was diagnosed measuring the albumin excretion rate (AER) by radioimmunoassay (RIA) method (Pharmacia, Pharmacia and Upjon Diagnostics AB, Uppsala, Sweden). Midstream clean voiding urinary specimens were collected for urinalysis, examined by Gram stain and cultured on blood and MacConkey agar for detection of uropathogens. Any isolated pathogen (after 24\u221248hours incubation) was identified using BBL\u2122 Enterotube\u2122 II (BD Diagnostic Systems, Germany), Api System and Vitek 2 Compact (Biomerieux, France). Results: The prevalence of ASB was increased in diabetic patients with MA compared to diabetic patients without MA (21% versus 8%, P < 0.001, respectively). Escherichia coli was the most prevalent pathogen isolated in diabetic patients with and without MA (12% versus 3.0%, P = 0.01, respectively) followed by Proteus mirabilis (6% versus 5%, P = 0.75, respectively) and Klebsiella spp (5% versus 1%, P = 0.09, respectively). Conclusion: ASB was more prevalent among T2D patients with MA and the main causative agent was E. coli. Screening for ASB is warranted in diabetic patients especially if pyuria is detected in urine analysis since ASB has been found to be a risk factor for developing symptomatic urinary tract infection. Results: Kp strains revealed various susceptibility to imipenem and meropenem. All strains were resistant to ertapenem, but most of them were susceptible to gentamicin, tetracycline, tigecycline and colistin. All strains were KPC-2 producers and belonged to the same clone. Patients' mean age was 70 years (range 25\u221281). Clinical diagnosis were: nine acute leukemia, one chronic lemphogenic leukemia, one aplastic anemia and one non Hodgkin lymphoma. The duration of patients' hospitalization was 0\u221224 days, before the isolation of Kp strains. In three patients, a simultaneous isolation of KPC strains from urine cultures was observed. Two patients with bacteremia were found to be colonized in the intestine with with KPC strains, while four patients developed first the bacteremia and intestine colonization followed. Neutropenia was observed in eight patients, with an absolute number of neutrophils 0-400/ml. Before the isolation of the KPC strains, all patients were treated with a combination of a b-lactam antibiotic and an aminoglycoside, while after the isolation the treatment changed to colistin, tigecycline and/or gentamycin. The response was poor and ten patients out of twelve (83%) died because of the KPC infection. Conclusions: Bacteremia from KPC-2 producers Kp, in hematological patients, has high mortality and consists a serious medical-nursery problem, in addition with the already existing high bacteria resistance. T. Damci (Istanbul, TR) Objectives: To identify risk factors contributing treatment responses and prognoses in severe diabetic foot infections. Material and Method: Between April 2008 and October 2010, a prospective study was conducted by Diabetic Foot Study Group on severe diabetic foot infections. Results: A total of 62 patients were included in this study, the mean age was 64.09 (range 37 to 87) years and forty three (69.4%) patients were male. Eighty patients were diabetic for more than ten years. 56.5% of the patient had previous hospital stay and 83.9% had previous antibiotic use within the last three months. The duration of wound infections were more than four weeks in 84% of the patients and 56.5% of them had purulent discharge. Leucocytosis was found in 26 (46.8%) patients and 41 (66.1%) patients had elevated CRP levels more than five fold. 14.5% of patients were classified as Wagner stage 4 and 8% were Wagner stage 5. Thirty three (53.2%) of the patients were presented with osteomyelitis. Etiology was identified in 41 (66.1%) patients. Gram negative bacilli were isolated in 19 (46.3%), Gram positive cocci were isolated in 10 (24.4%) and 12 (29.2%) grew mixed bacteria. Ten of 41 microorganisms isolated were ESBL producing Gram negative bacilli, three were MRSA, nine were MRSE, seven were multidrug resistant (MDR) P. aeruginosa and three were MDR A. baumannii. The mean duration of hospitalization was 38.4 days; 37 (59.7%) patients underwent debridement and amputation was performed in 30 (48.4%) patients. Major amputation was req\u00fcired in 9% of cases. Conclusion: Complete clinical improvement was observed in 26 (41.9%) patients. Duration of diabetes over ten years (p = 0.017), higher fever ( 38.5\u00baC) (p = 0.004), existance of purulent discharge (p = 0.020), higher Wagner stage of the wound (p = 0.000), elevated CRP levels (>5 fold) (p = 0.01), infection with MDR bacteria (p = 0.066), requirement of amputation (p = 0.000) and prolonged hospital stay (p = 0.01) were negative predictors of treatment success and prognosis. Methods: 103 CMV seropositive patients over the age of 18 \u2212 and whose donors were also seropositive \u2212 who had undergone renal transplantation between January 2007 and June 2010 were included in the study. The data on these patients were recorded retrospectively using follow-up forms. The form included the following information: age, gender, primary disease, cold ischemia time, type of transplantation, immunosuppressive treatment scheme, duration of valganciclovir use, adverse effects, CMV antigenemia level and whether CMV infection/ disease developed after transplantation or not. In the prophylaxis group VGC (n = 29) was administered 450mg/day. For the other group (n = 26) VGC was not administered only short time IV gansiklovir was administered. If the patient received antithymocyte globulin (ATG) treatment, IV ganciclovir was administered only during the treatment. The patients were followed using CMV antigenemia tests (1\u22123 times/ month). All patients were followed for 6\u221230 months after transplantation. The data were evaluated using chi-square test and t test for independent groups on SPSS 15 software.",

            "text": "Conclusion: HMPV infection is associated with significant morbidity and poor outcomes. Lymphopenia is a risk factor for infection with HMPV in adult patients receiving treatment for hematological malignancy. Co-infection with MRSA occurs. Neutrophil recovery and hypogammaglobulinaemia may contribute to severity of infection. Ribavirin was well tolerated. Late treatment with intravenous ribavirin for seven days did not eradicate viral shedding in one patient, and may have contributed to clinical and virological cure in the other. HMPV may be detected in respiratory secretions for greater than 6 weeks in adult patients with haemopoeitic malignancy, with implications for infection control measures. was an independent risk factor for PBSI, while prior blood transfusion was revealed as protective factor (OR 3, 9; 95% CI, 5) . Empirical inappropriate antimicrobial treatment has been given to 20 patients (59%) with PBSIs, and 7 (21%) with MBSIs (p = 0.003). The infectionrelated mortality was 29% in patients with PBSI and 12% in those with MBSI (p = 0.072). No differences in duration of hospitalization or overall mortality were observed. Conclusion: PBSIs represent a significant percentage of BSIs among patients with malignancy. Although inappropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment has been given in higher percentage of patients with PBSI than those with MBSIs, no differences in duration of hospitalization or overall mortality have been observed. Recognition of the risk factors for PBSIs and knowledge of their microbiology are important for the selection of appropriate empirical antimicrobial treatment that may result in improved outcome. Results: Sixty-one UTI episodes were diagnosed in 51 patients. Sixtynine percent of the patients were female. The range of the ages were 18\u221260 years. More than one UTI episodes were seen in 8 patients. The three leading uropathogens were E. coli, Klebsiella spp and enterococci. E. coli was detected in 41 (67%) episodes, Klebsiella spp. was detected in 11 (18%) episodes and enterococci was detected in 5 (8%) episodes. Twenty-one of the E. coli isolates (51%) were ESBL positive. The antimicrobial resistance rates of ESBL negative and ESBL positive E. coli isolates were shown in the Table. The risk factors determined are hospitalization at the time of diagnosis or hospitalization within 1 month, recent (within 1 month) antibiotic use, urinary catheterization. Conclusion: Risk factors for urinary tract infections caused by ESBL producing bacteria among renal transplant recipients are similar with the other patient groups but nearly half of the uropathogen E. coli strains are ESBL positive in renal transplant recipients. This high percentage of resistant pathogens causes difficulties in the management of these patients. Multidrug resistant bacteria are increasingly isolated from transplant recipients and cause high morbidity, mortality. The aim of this study is to determine the disribution and etiologic agents of bacterial infections seen in the early period after liver transplantation.",

Microbiologically documented bacterial infections seen during the first month after liver transplantation were included in this study. A total of ninety liver transplantations were performed during the study period. Twenty eight bacterial infection episodes were diagnosed in 20 patients within 30 days after transplantation operation. Twelve (13%) of the infections were intraabdominal (9 Gram negative and 3 Gram positive), 8 (9%) were catheter-related (4 Gram negative, 4 Gram positive), 6 (6%) urinary tract infection (5 Gram negative, 1 Gram positive), 2 ventilator associated pneumonia (1 Gram negative, 1 Gram positive). A total of 19 episodes were caused by Gram negative bacteria and the remaining 9 were caused by Gram positive bacteria. Strains susceptible only to colistin and tigecycline were defined as extensively drug resistant (XDR). Seven of the isolated Gram negative strains were Klebsiella pneumoniae (2 ESBL positive, 2 XDR strains), 6 were Escherichia coli (4 ESBL positive strains), 4 Acinetobacter baumannii (3 XDR strains) , 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The distribution of the Gram positive pathogens were 4 Enterococcus faecium (2 were vancomycin resistant), 3 methicillin resistant coagulase negative staphylococci, 1 methicillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus and 1 methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus. A total of 20 bacteremia episodes were detected of which 12 (60%) were secondary and 8 (40%) were primary. The incidence of colonization and infection with multi-drug resistant bacteria particularly Gram negative strains has been increasing throughout the world. Data regarding the transplantation patients are limited but common usage of extended spectrum antibiotics among these patients both during the preoperative and postoperative phases undoubtedly predispose to difficult-to treat infections. The infection rates seen in the early postoperative period obtained in this study are comparable with the previous ones but the high percentages of multidrug resistant strain is the alarming issue.",

The objective of this study was to determine the microbial etiology, correlation between leucocyte (wbc) count and culture results as well as the concordance between culture and the Gram stain of PD related cases of peritonitis in both children and adults. We reviewed the records of all patients whose peritoneal dialysate (n = 1285) was sent to the lab for microbiology of the Antwerp University Hospital between January 2005 and August 2009. Microbial etiology, wbc count, Gram stain and antibiotic treatment were analyzed per episode. 142 adults and 22 children were included. From each episode, microbial etiology was based on culture results of the first sample. Gram stain was performed when the leucocyte count exceeded 200 per mm3.

            "text": "Objectives: A small number of global pneumococcal clones defined by the Pneumococcal Molecular Epidemiology Network (PMEN) dominate the population of antibiotic-resistant pneumococci. It remains unclear why PMEN clones spread so successfully despite the scientific paradigm that a loss in biological fitness is the price for acquisition of resistance. The aim of this study was to detect PMEN clone related clinical isolates from adult patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) collected by the German CAPNETZ surveillance study during [2002] [2003] [2004] [2005] [2006] and to compare them to unrelated clones in terms of antibioticresistance, biological fitness and clinical parameters. Methods: Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) data were used to define relatedness between PMEN clones and clinical pneumococcal isolates. Relatedness was defined by the sharing of alleles at 5 of 7 loci. Fitness was determined by the measurement of growth curves. The bacterial growth was measured by a microplate reader at optical density of 600 nm at intervals of five minutes over a period of 16 hours. To compare bacterial growth we analysed the maximum slope of each curve and the experiment was repeated nine times. Statistical analysis were performed by the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test for categorial variables and the t-test or analysis of variances (ANOVA) for continuous variables. Results: We analysed 154 pneumococcal isolates and 46 (30%) isolates showed a close relationship to the global PMEN clones. These isolates were equal or exceeded the fitness of isolates without relationship to PMEN clones (1.48\u00b10.73 vs. 1.18\u00b10.54; P = 0.015) and constituted 80% of antibiotic-resistant isolates. The survey of clinical parameters showed no prominent significant difference between both groups. Conclusion: The success of international PMEN clones is based on the combination of resistance and fitness and may result in the endurance of these strains despite a reduction of antibiotic usage. New vaccines can interrupt the transmission of resistant strains, but continued attention to the replacement of nonvaccine serotypes and development of vaccines with a broader coverage will be necessary.

We retrieved and reviewed medical records and estimated the positive predictive value (PPV) of the empyema diagnosis. Definite empyema was defined by frank pus aspirated from the pleural space, a positive Gram stain/subculture for pathogenic micro-organisms in the pleural fluid, and/or an autopsy diagnosis of empyema. Patients with clinical symptoms suggestive of empyema in association with compatible radiographic features (e.g. pleural thickening, loculated and/or septated pleural effusions) who did not meet the criteria for definite empyema were classified as having probable empyema. Results: We could retrieve the medical records of 224/225 sampled patients with empyema (99.6%). Of those, we classified 182 (81.3%) as being definite empyema cases. Another 21 patients were classified as probable empyema cases. In 21 patients whose empyema diagnosis was rejected, eight had pneumonia, one had a pulmonary abscess, one pulmonary tuberculosis, one had sarcoidosis, two had emphysema. The overall PPV of the empyema diagnosis was 90.1% (95% CI 86.0-94.1). The PPV was 81.3% (95% CI 81.3-86.1) when including definite cases only. PPVs of empyema diagnosed in 1995-1999, 2000-2004, and 2005-2009 were 90.7% (95% CI 81.7-96.2), 94.6% (95% CI 86.7-98.5), and 86.7% (95% CI 76.8-93.4), respectively, indicating that no major changes in coding validity occurred over the 15-year study period. The PPV decreased slightly from 95.7% in patients aged 15\u221239 years to 87.5% in patients aged 80 years and over but was uniformly high regardless of study period, hospital or department type, or cause of empyema.",

Registry-based discharge codes may be a suitable source of data on pleural empyema for epidemiological research. Introduction: Nocardia is a rare pathogen causing predominantly pulmonary and/or skin and soft tissue infections. Since immunosuppression is one main predisposing factor, nociardial infections may increase because of the rising number of patients on immunosuppressive therapy (e.g. solid organ or bone marrow transplantation). Data on futher risk factors, clinical course and treatment of nocardial infections are limited to case reports and small case series. We aim to establish a register for nocardia infections in Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands. Methods: Retrospective analysis of all microbiologically proven pulmonary Nocardia spp. infections in 4 hospitals in Germany and the Netherlands between 1999 and 2009, defined as detection of Nocardia spp. in respiratory samples + radiolagical changes and signs and symptoms of pulmonary infection. Results: Twenty-one cases of pulmonary nocardiosis could be identified (18 male, 3 female; mean age 54.7\u00b118.1 years). In addition to pulmonary involvement, disseminated disease was detected in 3 patients (all with cerebral abscess formation). Eleven of 21 patients had pulmonary comorbidities (n = 4 COPD; n = 3 bronchiektasis, n = 2 cystic fibrosis, n = 1 asthma, n = 1 post-TB). Twelve of 18 patients had identifiable causes of immunosuppression (hematological dieseases, malignancies, drug induced immunosuppression, diabetes mellitus). All patients tested (16/21) were HIV negative. Time from sampling to availability of microbiological results was 9.1 days. All cases were proven by culture and in 15 patients additional PCR-sequencing was performed (N. farcinica n = 4; N. abscessus n = 3; N. asteroides n = 3; N. nova, N. carnea, N. cyriacigeorgica, N. otitidiscaviarum and N. paucivorans each n = 1) The pathogen was isolated from BAL (n = 9), sputum (n = 7), biopsy (n = 3), tracheobronchial aspirate (n = 1), and abscess aspirate (n = 1). Most patients received cotrimoxazol treatment (15/21), mean duration of treatment was 12.2 weeks. One patient died. Conclusion: Pulmonary nocardiosis remains a rare disease. Although immunosuppression (e.g. drug induced immunosuppression or malignancies) is its major risk factor, it can also occur in patients without obviously impaired immunocompetence. These patients most frequently suffer from chronic pulmonary diseases such as COPD. The delayed in vitro growth of Nocardia spp. may lead to misdiagnosis or underestimation of nocardiosis in patients without typical risk factors.",

A blood culture service started in April 2007 to ensure active antibiotic within 2 days of blood culture collection. A prospective bacteraemia study from February to June 2009 noted mortality at discharge decreased to 9%. Death occurred in 2% before positive blood culture was notified. We aim to study patients with early death for clinical predictors. Methods: Patients who died before (early death) and after (late death) positive blood culture was notified were compared, so was early death with survivors. Univariate and multivariate analysis were performed for independent predictors of early death. Results: Of 452 patients with 467 cases of bacteraemia, 42 patients died, and 9 were early death. Male comprised 60%, median age was 78 years and Charlson's score 5.

Data on clinical symptoms, laboratory values, imaging studies, medications and outcome were collected and compared between children and adults. During the study period vaccination against pneumococcal diseases was recommended only to specific risk groups (patients with immune deficiencies and people older than 65 years). Results: There were 56 paediatric (<18 years) and 229 adult cases. One hundred and seven of the patients (26% of adults and 84% of children) were previously healthy.

In order to quantify the costs of the treatment we consider the average weekly costs of antimicrobial therapy. Results: 50 PJIs were included in the analysis. Only in 27 (54%) we obtained the isolation of the microrganism ( in 61% of cases. Furthermore, we evaluated the importance of the choice of the therapeutical option: with prosthetic removal and consequent substitution we cured 89% vs 69% of patients who underwent debridement and retention and 64% of patients treated only with longterm suppressive antimicrobial treatment. The mean weekly cost of PJIs in our analysis was 278\u20ac but when the microrganism involved were MRSA/MRSE was increased to 404\u20ac. Conclusion: In our analysis. there is a significant proportion of PJIs where the pathogen remains unidentified. As previously described, the two stages substitution of the prosthesis resulted to be the most successful option. Taken as a whole, our data suggest the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to the management of prosthetic joint infections at all stages, allowing a timely identification of the microorganism whenever is possible and a medical and surgical approach that allows more favourable outcome. MRSA/MRSE continue to be a serious challenge in patients with prosthetic infections, being associated to have a worse outcome and greater costs when compared to infections caused by other microorganisms.",

Methods: We reviewed medical and laboratory records of the consecutive 116 hospitalized adult patients with sepsis from May 2007 to June 2010 in one tertiary university hospital. DNI was measured by blood cell analyzer (ADVIA 120, Siemens, Inc.). Results: Of a total 116 patients with sepsis, mean age was 69.3\u00b112.0 years and mean DNI value was 5.5\u00b17.4% (range 0-34.6%) and mean APACHE II score was 17.8\u00b16.9 (range 6\u221242).

The mean length of hospitalization was 10.5\u00b10.34 days (range 1\u221238 days). 686 and 183 children had the history of the acute upper respiratory tract infection and bronchitis, respectively. 68 patients experienced one or more CAP episodes in their past history. Influenza was registered in the anamnesis of 53 patients. 60% of studied patients attended pre-school and school organizations. The analysis of the repeated cases of pneumonia among studied patients hasn't revealed the statistically significant interrelation between the severity of the disease and the presence of the pneumonia episode in the patient's history (odds ratio: 1.3; 95% confidence interval 0.6\u22122.8, p = 0.695). CAP cases were registered round the year. The morbidity increased in September then slightly decreased in December. Another increase was recorded in January. The maximum levels were noted in November (101 cases) and in April (100 cases). Conclusion: Children's CAP is the significant problem for Belarusian Health System. The main group associated with CAP was children aged from 1 to 3 years old. In the future, immunization with the use of licensed pneumococcal and influenza vaccines may reduce the frequency of pneumonia. year old man, father of the first patient, IgG= 140IU/ml, IgM= 1.08IU/ml. They hosted stray cats at their garden and had close and long-term contact with them. 40 year old woman, IgG= 300IU/ml, IgM= 6.60IU/ml, infection is attributed to eating raw meat. Conclusions: 20.31% of women tested proved to be seropositive, a percentage which comes in total compliance with other studies conducted in Northern Greece (20% among women of reproductive age). Comparing our results to previous studies we can clearly observe a decrease in seropositivity rates during the last decades (1984: 35.6%, 1994: 25.6%) . 79.69% of women tested had no previous contact with T. gondii, and therfore are susceptible. Possible sources of infection for susceptible individuals, taking into account people's habits in Drama Province: Eating habits: low consumption of undercooked meat, high consumption of lamp, goat, sheep, smoked pork sausages, and salads consisting of raw and wild vegetables and fruits (well documented sources of T. gondii) Great number of stray cats unknown responses, was the primary efficacy endpoint. Microbiologic response was defined as eradication or presumed eradication. Secondary endpoints were global response at end of IV therapy (EOIVT) and 2 and 6 weeks after EOT, time to negative blood culture, survival at day 90 and adverse events (AEs). Results: 216 pts received study drug and 170 were included in the MITT population. Most had candidemia (71%) and C albicans only was the most common causative pathogen (56%). Common C/IC risk factors included broad-spectrum antibiotics (90% of pts), central venous catheter (87%), prior surgery (67%), and total parenteral nutrition (58%). Most tested baseline isolates (153/167) were fully susceptible to all of ANI/FLU/VOR, with the exception of: 2/96 C albicans to both FLU and VOR; 4/27C glabrata to FLU; 1/21 C parapsilosis to ANI and 5/21 to FLU; and 2/2 C krusei to FLU. Overall MIC 90 for ANI, FLU and VOR was 0.5 mgmL, 8 mgmL and 0.5 mgmL, respectively. Microbiologic and global response at different time points, across the selected subpopulations/baseline pathogens and by infection site are shown in the table. Mean time to first negative blood culture was 4 days and 90-day survival was 54%. 33/216 (15%) of patients had treatmentrelated AEs, which led to study discontinuation in 5 pts. Infusion-related AEs occurred in 6 pts.",

The lowest incidence of side-effects to standard therapy has been observed when probiotics were combined with antibiotics. Because of the low eradication rates and lack of treatment regimens alternative approaches for H. pylori have been explored to assess the efficacy and safety of synbiotic compared with prebiotic for H. pylori eradication in duodenal ulcer (DU) patients. Methods: Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial lasting 8 weeks. Each of pills contained either specific synbiotic (E. faecium L-3 10 6\u22127 CFU/g, pectin and soy protein hydrolyzate, Laminaria saccharina) or prebiotic (pectin and soy protein hydrolyzate, Laminaria saccharina) or placebo. Pills were manufactured to conduct the trial. 81 H. pylori-positive patients in remission of DU were randomly assigned to three groups: Group A received synbiotic, group B received prebiotic, group C received placebo. All patients took three pills three times daily. Gastroscopy was performed before and 6 weeks after the end of treatment for DU activity evaluation.

Synbiotic showed a higher eradication rate than prebiotic (p = 0.0156) or placebo (p = 0.0317). Clinical or endoscopic relapses of DU or chronic gastritis were observed in 14 patients in group A, 6 patients in group B and 8 patients in group C.

Limper (Barquisimeto, VE; Amsterdam, NL) Background: Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) during pregnancy pose a major risk to the fetus due to vertical transmission. Congenital disease still represents a significant public health problem worldwide, particularly in developing countries. Methods and Materials: A retrospective investigation was performed comprising all pregnant women with HIV and/or syphilis infections admitted at the central hospital cof two Western Cities of Venezuela, during January 2007-September 2010; pregnant women without STDs served as control group. Epidemiological characteristics were reported, anthropometrical variables in newborns were considered. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed on SPSS v.17 \u00ae . Results: 76 pregnant HIV patients and 77 patients with syphilis infection were identified, three of them being coinfected. 87 pregnant women without STD served as controls. Mean age of infected mothers (HIV/syphilis) was 26 years (range 14\u221242 yrs) with a mean of 3 pregnancies (range 1\u221212). In the control group, pregnancies of 38\u00b11 weeks were observed; newborns had a mean birth weight of 3,220\u00b1524 and a mean height of 51\u00b13cm. In HIV infected patients, mean gestation was 36 weeks (range 26\u221241 weeks). Mean birth weight of newborns was 2,829\u00b1686 g (range 510\u22123,900 g); 22,6% were low birth weight newborns; mean birth height was 49\u00b14 cm (range 30\u221256). In syphilis infected patients, mean gestation was 37 weeks (range 22\u221241 weeks). Mean birth weight of newborns was 3,159\u00b1649 g (range 700\u22124,240 g); 11,5% were low birth weight newborns, mean birth height was 51\u00b14 cm (range 33\u221259 cm). Maternal VDRL titers were strongly associated with birth weight; higher mother VDRL titers correlated with lower birth weight. Cephalic, thoracic and abdominal circumference did not show considerable differences between groups. Conclusion: STDs cause considerable morbidity in women during the gestational period. Congenital and perinatal infection of the newborn, miscarriage and low birth weight have been described. In this study, both HIV and syphilis infections resulted in lower birth weight, particularly in newborns from HIV infected patients. Treatment of the etiologic agent is considered effective for prevention of vertical transmission and is recommended for STDs.",

Methods: During two years period (2007) (2008) IgM and IgG antibodies against Parvo B19 virus were detected in 287 blood samples from hospitalized children, aged 2 months till 15 years, with fever and suspicion of parvoviral infection. Antibody titre was detected with immunoassay and reconfirmed with indirect immunofluorescence (Bios, Germany). Results: From 287 clinical samples from equal number of patients, ParvoB19 acute infection was diagnosed in 94 patients (32,7%). IgG antibodies were detected in 27.2% of children. A slight difference was observed in the incidence of antibody detection between sexes. The incidence of IgG antibody detection in children aged less than 4 years (27,3%) was inferior in comparison with incidence in children aged above 10 years (34,7%). Increased incidence of infection was observed during winter and spring months. Conclusions: Early and accurate diagnosis of Parvo B19 infection based on IgM antibody detection or an increase of IgG antibody titre is crucial in hospitalized children with infectious rash and leukopenia or chronic haemolytic anaemia.",

Voyatzi (Athens, GR) Toxoplasmosis is a worldwide public health disease, nowdays. Incidence varies among different countries, depending on living standards, dietary habits and socioeconomic status of population. Objectives: To determine the incidence of toxoplasmosis in children with cervical or generalized lymphadenopathy, by detection of IgM and IgG antibodies, during five years (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) . Methods: Determination of IgM and IgG antibody titre against Toxoplasma gondii was performed with immunoassay in 1254 sera from children with lymphadenopathy, aged 1 till 14 years, who were hospitalized or admitted at the emergency department. In every child two blood samples were drawn with a distance period of 15 days and examined for TORCH virulent agents. Reconfirmation of acute infection was performed by indirect immunofluorescence as well as by observation of fourth time rise of IgG antibody titre. Results: From 1254 children examined 85 (6.8%) were positive for IgG and 25 (1.9%) for IgM antibodies against Toxoplasma gondii 19 (1.5%) children were positive for both IgG and IgM antibodies. Rise of seropositivity was observed according the increase of age. Higher incidence of infection was observed in the age group between 8 and 14yrs. There was no difference observed in the incidence of antibody detection between sexes. Conclusions: Toxoplasma gondii is an important cause of lymphadenopathy during childhood in Greece, with low incidence, probably due to the habit of eating well-cooked meat and the good socioeconomic status of the study population. Objectives: Isolation of Candida spp. in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in preterm neonates is rare. We describe the clinical characteristics and diagnosis of two cases of hospitalized premature neonates in whose Candida albicans isolated from CSF. Methods: The first case was about a set of female dizygotic twins, who were born at 32 w gestation. Twin a died within few hours, while twin b was transferred to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Their mother was treated for cervical incompetence and vaginal candidiasis during the 2nd trimester of her pregnancy. Neonate b was started on empiric antibiotic therapy, because of elevated CRP, and low CSF glucose level. Blood and CSF cultures were negative. On day 8, the neonate looked slightly unwell and lumbar puncture (LP) was repeated. The second case was about a male neonate, who was born at 28 w gestation. The neonate presented respiratory distress syndrome and neonatal jaundice, and transferred to NICU. Empiric antibiotic therapy was started, although",

Ueda*, N. Kohda, S. Kohno (Otsu, Nagasaki, JP) Objectives: The fatalities caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae) infection are high in the young children and the elderly. Host-defense mechanisms against these pathogenic infections involve both innate and acquired immune systems. In particular secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) and innate immunities in the airway mucosa play a principal role in preventing these infections. Lactobacillus pentosus ONRICb0240 (b240) has been screened as the excellent IgAinducing bacterium in vitro. The present study aimed to investigate whether nonviable b240 can prevent S. pneumoniae infection in mice. Methods: CBA/J mice were administered with b240 for 3 weeks prior to lethal S. pneumoniae infection. The survival and body weight of the mice were monitored daily for 2 weeks after infection. Then, isolated lungs were evaluated the severity of pneumonia. The number of S. pneumoniae, concentration of inflammatory cytokines, and expression of toll-like receptor 2 in lung homogenate on 2days after infection were determined.",

Rivera-Olivero*, B. del Nogal, M.C. Sisco, M. Fuentes, R. Cortez, D. Bogaert, P.W. Hermans, J.H. de Waard (Caracas, VE; Utrecht, Nijmegen, NL) Objectives: To evaluate immunogenicity of the pneumococcal 7-valent conjugate vaccine (PCV7) and the impact on pneumococcal carriage in infants with sickle cell disease (SCD) or HIV infection. Methods: Children with SCD (n = 25) and HIV (n = 12) listed at the Children Hospital in Caracas, Venezuela were enrolled in this study and vaccinated according to their age with the 7-valent conjugate vaccine followed by a booster dose of a 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PS-23). Blood samples and nasopharyngeal swabs for the determination of antibody concentrations for vaccine serotypes and for the isolation of S. pneumoniae respectively were obtained immediately before and 1 month after the PS-23 booster. Results: Of the 37 infants enrolled in this study, pneumococcal carriage prior the first immunization was found in 32% (n = 12) of the children with 67% (n = 8) carrying non-vaccine serotypes. After boosting 100% of the subjects had antibody titers >0.35 mg/mL for all the 7 vaccine serotypes, ranging from 0.42 mg/mL (serotype 6B) to 62.21 mg/mL (serotype 14). One month after completion of the vaccination scheme pneumococcal carriage was found in 27% (n = 10) of the children with 80% (n = 8) carrying non vaccine serotypes. Conclusions: High antibody titers for the serotypes of the 7-valent conjugate vaccine were obtained with this vaccination scheme in our children. However, no significant effect on carriage rate in general or carriage rates for vaccine serotypes was observed.",

In group 2 at the first sampling levels of the cytokines were as follows: IL-1b 0.28\u00b10.16 pg/ml, TNF-a 0.54\u00b10.09 pg/ml, IFN-g 2.37\u00b11.38 pg/ml, and only the level of IFN-g was significantly higher (p < 0.0001) than mean level in group 1. In turn, on the second sampling mean level of IFN-g was significantly higher (p = 0.0152) than the level noted upon the first sampling and amounted to 4.41\u00b12.6 pg/ml. Serum levels of IL-1b and TNF-a increased in 10 patients (2.77\u00b12.45 pg/ml, p = 0.0005 and 1.67\u00b10.69 pg/ml, p < 0.0001, respectively) and remained unaltered in the 6 remaining patients. At the same time in 10 patients presence of S. aureus could not be detected in throat smears obtained at the time of the second sampling. Conclusion: The effective immune response against S. aureus seems to depend on levels of circulating cytokines IL-1b and TNF-a, the production of which may be stimulated by S. aureus autovaccine. Background: Some evidence has shown a relationship between human cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection and pregnancy loss. However, whether recurrent or latent CMV infection or altered immune response to CMV may relate to recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is unclear and few data are available in this regard. We evaluated CMV infection and humoral immunological response to CMV in women with RPL and compared it to women without any history of abortion.",

Inclusion criteria were at least 3 recurrent spontaneous abortions, and no history of any diagnosed underlying diseases as etiology of RP L. Blood samples were obtained from patients and controls to evaluate CMV IgG and IgM antibodies and IgG avidity index by the Enzyme Linked Immunosorbant Assay Method (ELISA). Data were analyzed with SPSS version 16.0, using Student's t-test, chi-squared test, and multivariate analyses. Results: One case (2.3%) of positive IgM in each group of RPL's and controls was detected. Also, there were 39 (90.6%) and 30 (69.8%) cases of positive IgG in RPL's and controls, P < 0.05. Patients and controls were similar regarding serum IgM titer (P > 0.05). But, IgG titer was significantly higher in RPL group, P < 0.05. No differences were found between the two groups in IgG avidity index (P > 0.05). In multivariate analyses, only IgG positivity was related to RPL (P < 0.05) and avidity was not related to RPL (P = 0.277). Also, IgG positivity (P = 0.159), IgM positivity (P = 0.856), or avidity index (P = 0.440) were not related to the number of abortions in RPL patients. Conclusions: Previous exposure to CMV detected by a positive IgG antibody is significantly related to RPL in the present study. However, we found no relationship between IgG avidity index and RPL. Whether Latent CMV infection starting an indirect process of autoimmune etiology in RPL's or women with RPL had recurrent or reactivation of CMV infection but avidity index is not the best index to detect it, mostly because of altered immune function to CMV in RPL patients need further investigations.",

In addition, comparison of cytokine profile between b240 and low IgA inducible LAB was examined. Next, we administrated heat-killed b240 to the mice for 3 weeks and investigated the intestinal IgA enhancement. Moreover, we attempted an ex vivo study to assess the reactivity of murine Peyer's patch cells against b240. Results: We found out b240 to be exhibiting excellent IgA producing activities in 150 strains of LAB. Interestingly, plant derived LAB including b240 tended to show higher activity than dairy LAB. After 3weeks of b240 administration, intestinal IgA significantly increased with first vaccination at 2, 8 and 16 weeks of age, respectively. Vaccine induced immune response, mainly the Th1 type cytokine secretion, was evaluated in different age groups following booster doses at equal time intervals. Preliminary results show higher antigen specific IFN-g levels in response to heat shock protein and ESAT-6 family member protein antigens. It was observed that there was no effect of age on the IFN-g producing capacity of the animals in the different age groups after stimulation of whole blood with SEB. However, animals in the older age group responded well to the MAP multi-antigens and might need only one booster compared to the younger animals. Findings from this work could be interesting to determine the appropriate age of vaccination so as to generate the memory T cell pool and for MAP vaccine challenge experiments. Smallpox, caused by Variola virus, is considered as a dreadful scourge for human. Smallpox vaccination, using strains of Vaccinia virus (VACV) has leaded to it eradication in 1980. However, adverse reaction could result, so it was abandoned. Current bioterrorism attack threat are feared the disease re-emergence, then new smallpox vaccines more safe but less effective in animals have been developed. Attenuation of our candidates have been measured in Swiss Nude or SCID mice. Mice have been vaccinated with 10 5 pfu of each viruses by tail scarification. Signs of disease and mortality were followed over an 8 week period. Protection of BALB/c mice against a lethal challenge have been performed, 28 days after vaccination, with 2.10 6 DICT50 of cowpoxvirus by intranasal route (i.n). VACV neutralizing antibodies (Abs) in serum samples were titrated by plaque assay. Serum samples were first incubated at 56\u00baC for 30 minutes then submitted to serial 2-fold dilutions. The samples were mixed with an equal volume of VACV containing 35 PFU in 0.1ml for one hour at 37\u00baC and added to Vero cell monolayers. Two days later virus plaques were counted. To measure T lymphocyte responses the percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes expressing intracellular IFN-g was measured by flow cytometry. Mature bone marrow dendritic cells from uninfected BALB/c mice were infected with VACV then incubated with spleen cell suspensions from infected animals for six hours. Brefeldin A (5 mg/ml) was added for the last four hours to block cytokine secretion. Cells were stained with FITCcoupled anti-CD8b2 and APC-coupled anti-CD4 monoclonalAbs, fixed and permeabilised. IFN-g was stained with a PE-coupled anti-IFN-g mAb and cells were fixed in 2% formaldehyde. These vaccine candidates have been shown as protective as the traditional vaccine (1G) against an i.n cowpox challenge in mice, and they have been closely as safe as MVA strain in NUDE mice. The neutralizing antibodies titration showed that every deleted viruses induced a humoral response as strong as 1G. Finally intracellular cytokine staining showed a similar specific CD4+ response to that of 1G and a slightly lower specific CD8+ response than that of 1G. Our results show that several deleted vaccines could advantageously complete the range of the third generation vaccines already developed. The utilisation of one of these candidates as a viral vector for a vaccine against Ebola virus is under investigation in our laboratory.",

            "text": "The differences between adherence to seasonal and pandemic influenza vaccination after the implementation of a vaccination program between health-care workers were assessed and compared by age, gender, professional category and workplace. Two different prognostic models for predicting adherence to seasonal and pandemic influenza were developed. In statistical analysis, univariate logistic regression was performed to identify risk factors associated with adherence to vaccinations. Multiple regression analysis backwards, stepwise variable selection was used to identify independent risk factors for adherence. The internal validation of the predictive models was evaluated by measures of calibration and discrimination power. Results: 7.6% of professionals were vaccinated against pandemic influenza, and 33.7% against seasonal influenza. Statistically significant differences were observed for both vaccines when comparing vaccinated to unvaccinated professionals as for age, professional category and workplace, while sex differences were only related to pandemic influenza. The predictive model of adherence to pandemic H1N1 vaccine, which showed a good discriminatory power (Area under ROC curve: 0.843), included the variables age, professional category, workplace and previous vaccination against seasonal influenza as independent predicting factors. On the contrary, the predictive model of adherence to seasonal vaccine, which showed a poor discriminatory power (Area under ROC curve: 0.567), included the variables age, gender and workplace. Both models showed a good calibration (table 1) . Conclusions: Adherence to pandemic H1N1 and seasonal influenza vaccination program was very low, which suggests the need to implement new strategies into vaccination programs aimed at healthcare professionals. A good model for predicting adherence to pandemic vaccine was developed when compared with the poor discriminating power of the predictive model for seasonal influenza vaccination.",

These synthesized estimates may therefore serve as a baseline measure against which to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of new strategies for preventing pneumococcal infection. Resistance of BPZE1-challenged MDDC to apoptosis was assessed by AnnexinV/Propidium Iodide staining. Chemokine-driven chemotaxis was also evaluated. Co-culture experiments with T lymphocytes were performed to assess antigen-presenting activity, T-helper cell polarizing ability and induction of functional suppressor T cells. Results: BPZE1 is able to induce phenotypic maturation of human MDDC which are resistant to apoptosis. BPZE1-primed MDDC produce a broad spectrum of proinflammatory and regulatory cytokines, and very efficiently migrate in vitro in response to the lymphatic chemokine CCL21, due to the inactivation of the pertussis toxin enzymatic activity. BPZE1-primed MDDC acquire antigen-presenting capacity, drive a mixed Th1/Th17 polarization, and induce functional suppressor T cells. Suppressing activity requires cell contact rather than the production of soluble factors. Conclusion: Our findings support the potential of BPZE1 as a novel live attenuated pertussis vaccine strongly activating the maturation of DC with full-blown activity. BPZE1-challenged DC acquire the capacity to survive death signals and migrate from the site of infection to the lymph nodes. BPZE1-committed DC have the ability to orchestrate a broad spectrum of Th1/Th17 responses, protective in experimental B. pertussis infection, and regulatory T cell responses, likely balancing each other to restore local homeostasis. Background: Patients receiving cytotoxic therapy for solid tumors are at increased risk of severe influenza, Data on flu vaccine immunogenicity are needed in those patients to improve the vaccine coverage. Methods: In a multicentric prospective study, 25 patients with breast (n = 13) or prostate (n = 12) cancer received one dose of a trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine the same day that the IV administration of docetaxel. Serum hemagglutination-inhibition (HI) antibody response was assessed 21 days after vaccination.",

When needed, the group contacted the physician in charge in order to improve the treatment. Antibiotic utilization was measured in defined daily doses (DDD)/100 bed days. Multiresistant bacteria comprising multidrug resistant P. aeruginosa, methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, extended spectrum b-lactamase and AmpC b-lactamase producing Klebsiella and E. coli strains were selected from all the cultures of P. aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, E. coli and Klebsiella spp. Results: Total antimicrobial consumption in 2008 was 74.5 DDD/100 bed days in front of 86.75 DDD/100 bed days in 2010. After implementation of the program, use of restricted antibiotics decreased from 10.11 DDD/100 bed days in 2008 to 9.26 DDD/100 bed days in 2010. Seventy three interventions were performed related to: antibiogram susceptibility (34), treatment duration (18), incorrect diagnosis (16) and wrong dose (5). Meropenem and piperacillin-tazobactam were the most overused antibiotics. Multiresistant bacteria increased from 5.76% in 2008 to 7.45% in 2010.

Halilova, M.V. Edelstein,  I. Alexandrova, A.M. Egorov (Moscow, Smolensk, RU)    Objectives: The production of b-lactamases is the predominant cause of resistance to b-lactam antibiotics in Gram-negative bacteria. To date, more than 700 b-lactamases have been described. Among them extended-spectrum b-lactamases (ESBLs) are the most widespread and clinically significant enzymes which are active against practically all penicillins and cephalosporins. During last years the clinical value of carbapenemases of molecular classes A, B and D increased noticeably. So far as many clinical isolates produce more than one b-lactamase and due to the high diversity of these enzymes their determination at the molecular level ensures adequate information for the identification of antimicrobial resistance. In the present research we have developed the technology of oligonucleotide microarray with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-based detection for the identification of genes encoding ESBLs and carbapenemases of A, B and D classes. Methods: Specific oligonucleotide probes were designed to determine b-lactamase type and important mutations responsible for the broadening of substrate specificity or resistance to inhibitors. The method of DNA microarray consisted of several steps involving DNA extraction, amplification and labeling of target DNA with biotin by two multiplex PCRs and the subsequent hybridization of a PCR product with specific oligonucleotide probes immobilized on porous membrane support. After hybridization biotin in DNA duplexes was developed with the streptavidin-HRP conjugate followed by colorimetric detection of the enzyme. Results: Careful optimization of oligonucleotide probes and hybridisation conditions ensured specific identification of all control isolates producing ESBLs and carbapenemases in a single array. The method developed has been applied successfully for the detection of ESBL and carbapenemase genes in a series of clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas spp. and Acinetobacter spp. Conclusion: DNA microarray technique offers the identification of a pathogen antibiotic resistance at the molecular level and is proposed as a useful tool for epidemiological investigation of ESBL-and carbapenemase-producing microorganisms.

In this cross sectional study is evaluated antiretroviral (ARV) cost according to treatment line in senior (sHIV) compared to junior (jHIV) HIV infected pts. Methods: ARV regimens in sHIV infected patients older than 50 years are compared to those used in jHIV patients followed up in the II Div Inf Dis, L Sacco Hospital, Milan \u2212 Italy. Clinical, immunovirological and current treatment data were collected on divisional data base on 30 November 2010. Cost of antiretroviral treatments are based on the prices reserved to L Sacco Hospital and are presented as mean cost/patient/day (CPD). Results: Among 1251 HAART treated pts (404 sHIV and 847 jHIV), 534 (42.68%) were on their first or second line treatment, and 712 pts had experienced 3 antiretroviral regimens. Viral load suppression <50 cp/ml was achieved in 908 (85.66%) out of 1060 available viral load assessed within 1 month from the enrollment with no difference between sHIV and jHIV (88.3% and 84.4% respectively; p = 0.092); no difference in rate of suppression by treatment line (c 2 p 0.74) was assessed. The two groups were comparable for class of antiretrovirals to be included in the treatment regimen (c 2 p 0.4) even if a NNRTI based regimen in sHIV and a PI based regimen in jHIV was preferred. Increasing proportion of rescue molecules (which include enfuvirtide, maraviroc, raltegravir and darunavir) are included in therapeutic regimen in multi-experienced patients associated to a proportional reduction in NNRTI containing regimens. Both in sHIV and jHIV patients the mean CPD of each treatment line progressively increases from \u20ac22.02 and 23.71 in first line treatment to \u20ac4083 and 38.85 CPD in patients with >10 treatment lines previously experienced respectively. When CPD were compared in sHIV and jHIV pts according to treatment lines a significantly lower cost was observed in sHIV in the first-second line treatment while comparable costs are registered in multi experienced patients (figure).",

Risk factors for CTX-M E. coli on cattle farms were also investigated. Methods: Pat samples from cattle on selected farms were screened for CTX-M E. coli using Chromagar CTX and sequence typed(Randall  et al., 2008). A contemporaneous, year long passive surveillance study was used to assess the geographical dissemination of CTX-M E. coli by the analysis of cattle and sheep diagnostic faecal samples (n = 113) submitted to local VLA regional laboratories in Wales. A network analysis approach was used to investigate the dissemination of the CTX-M-14 E. coli from the outbreak farm using the cattle tracing system. While the CTX-M gene was present in the study area there was no evidence for linkage of the CTX-M-14 to the outbreak farm. A similar plasmid to that from the outbreak farm (pCT) was found in CTX-M-14 E. coli isolates from humans. The role of 3rd/4th generation cephalosporins in the selection of CTX-M E. coli on cattle farms is being further investigated. Algeria.

Using broth dilution test, there were no E. faecalis isolate resistant to amoxicillin, while 10 (16.9%) isolates were resistant to imipenem and 55 (93.2%) to piperacillin. In conclusion, we demonstrated that the in vitro results obtained for ampicillin by broth dilution test might accurately predict the in vitro susceptibility of amoxicillin. Differently, the results obtained for ampicillin using either disk diffusion or broth dilution tests were not concordant with that for piperacillin and imipenem.

Ferreira*, A. Paradela, R. Diaz, S. Rocha, E. Ramalheira (Aveiro, PT) Objectives: Daptomycin belongs to a new class of antibiotics and is approved for use in the treatment of complicated skin and soft-tissue infections (SSTI) caused by Gram-positive bacteria. Staphylococcus aureus is the most common Gram-positive microorganism isolated from patients with these infections. The aim of this work was to evaluate the activity of daptomycin in Staphylococcus aureus isolates with a vancomycin MIC of 1 mgmL. Methods: During a two months period, thirty S. aureus with a vancomycin MIC of 1 mgmL were collected in the Hospital Infante D. Pedro EPE and included in this study. The strains were collected from SSTI, bloodstream and urinary tract infections. Conclusions: Daptomycin is not yet in use in the Portuguese hospitals, however and despite breakpoints for resistant phenotype are not established, this work shows that daptomycin can be an alternative to vancomycin, as therapeutic option for the treatment of S. aureus infections. Moreover, the decreased susceptibility to vancomycin exhibited by the metacillin sensitive isolates requires surveillance. In this study we evaluate the in-vitro activity of TIG against Multidrug resistant Acinetobacter spp. Methods: A total of 506 carbapenem resistant isolates of Acinetobacter spp isolated in our centre were studied Isolates were recovered from blood cultures, body fluids, catheters tips, pus, bronchial secretions and urine samples in a two year period, from January 2009 till November 2010. The identification and susceptibility testing was performed via the MicroScan Walkaway (Siemens). The TIG and Colistin susceptibility testing performed using Etest strips (AB Biodisc, Sweden) according to CLSI guidelines. The EUCAST Enterobacteriaceae breakpoints were used to interpret Tigecycline and colistin MIC results for A. baumannii.Results: Of the 506 isolates, 420 isolates exhibit an MIC less the 4mg/L Tigecycline maintains potent in vitro activity against highly resistant Acinetobacter spp. As for A. baumannii, there is a decreased susceptibility but it may be an alternative treatment option when other agents are excluded due to multidrug resistance. Due to the possibility of gaining resistance, it is essential for a hospital to remain aware of the susceptibility patterns of this new agent. Incubation conditions have an effect on the MIC and disk diffusion results for Streptococcus pneumoniae serogroups 19A. We can expect that incubation conditions are also of influence for Streptococcus pneumoniae serogroups other than 19A. Further investigation is needed.Objectives: Since 1961 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has spread worldwide and has become a leading cause of nosocomial infections. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the in vitro susceptibility of recent MRSA-isolates against the fifth generation cephalosporin ceftobiprole compared to the standard anti-MRSA agents vancomycin and fosfomycin. Methods: We tested 103 recent clinical MRSA strains, isolated from the blood of septic patients hospitalized to the General Hospital of Vienna. A single isolate per patient was accepted. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of ceftobiprole, vancomycin and fosfomycin were determined using broth microdilution method according to the guidelines of the Clinical Laboratory Standard Institutes (CLSI). Results: The MIC 50 and MIC 90 values for MRSA were 2 mg/ml and 4 mg/ml for ceftobiprole, 1 mg/ml and 2 mg/ml for vancomycin, 4 mg/ml and 16 mg/ml for fosfomycin, respectively. According to the breakpoints established by CLSI and EUCAST, a single isolate was resistant to ceftobiprole, another isolate was resistant to vancomycin, whereas seven isolates showed in vitro resistance to fosfomycin. Conclusions: Ceftobiprole and vancomycin demonstrated potent in vitro activity against MRSA blood-stream isolates with 99% susceptibility compared to less activity of fosfomycin with a MRSA resistance rate of 6.9%.Conclusions:Thus b-lactams (amoxicillin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, ceftibuten, ceftriaxone), azithromycin, clarithromycin, respiratory fluoroquinolones retain their high in vitro activity against haemophili, thus continue to serve as the first line of choice for treatment of infections caused by H. influenzae in Russia.Objectives:Tigecycline is a newly introduced glycylcycline with a broad spectrum activity against both Gram (+) and Gram (\u2212) bacteria and anaerobes as well, that gained approval initially for treatment of complicated skin, soft tissue and intra-abdominal infections and latest for community acquired pneumonia. The objective of the present study was to investigate the in vitro activity of tigecycline against a range of resistant clinical isolates included MRSA, VRE and K. pneumoniae. Methods: A total of 250 different clinical isolates were tested. in a general hospital the last two years. Species identification and initially susceptibility testing of the isolates was performed using the Wider system (Soria), while phenotypic detection of the production of extended spectrum b-lactamases ESBL, ampC-b-lactamases, metallob-lactamases MBL and carbapenemases KPC, was performed by the double disk synergy test, the combined disk test, the two-sided E-test and the modified Hodge Test on M. H. agar. 35%) of these isolates had the MIC at the same point as MIC 90 . Although the imipenem susceptible and the meropenem susceptible groups revealed the similar MIC 90 at 4 mgml, the meropenem susceptible group tended to have lower doripenem MIC 50 (2 mgml). This occurred in both imipenem susceptible and intermediate groups.The MICs of all isolates from double intermediate and the imipenem susceptible groups were at 4 mgml. Conclusion: The above data of doripenem has showed that this new carbapenem could be an alternative choice for the treatment of imipenem/meropenem non-susceptible P. aeruginosa infectiom.Introduction: Acinetobacter baumannii has now got itself established as a very common and difficult to treat nosocomial pathogen. Its ability to develop resistance against the major groups of antibiotics limits therapeutic options. Very few antibiotics can be reliably used against this resistant organism. Objective: We have conducted this study to find out the efficacy of tigecycline, minocycline and colistin against MDR A. baumannii Materials and Method: The study was carried out at the Department of Microbiology, Army Medical College/National University of Sciences and Technology, looking after an 1100 bedded tertiary care hospital. Result: A total of 100 MDR A. baumannii were tested. Colistin found out to be the most effective among the three antibiotics tested. All the isolates were susceptible to colistin. Minocycline was better in activity than tigecycline against MDR A. baumannii. 94% isolates were susceptible to minocycline and 80% were susceptible to tigecyclien. Conclusion: Colistin and minocycline, cost effective antibiotics, can be reliably suggested against infections caused by MDR A. baumannii. Emerging resistance against Tigecycline and its high cost hinders its use as first choice.",

Our results indicate that single clone of E. faecalis PVL is a cytotoxin that causes leukocyte destruction and tissue necrosis. In our hospital, a 12% of MRSA isolates in clinical sample were PVL producers and a high percentage was related with community infections associated to tissue and soft skin infections as in others studies but also a low percentage was related with hospital infections.

Sanchez-Solis (Murcia, ES)    Objectives: Bronchiolitis is the most common respiratory disease in children under 2 years-old and a major cause of hospitalization in young children, especially during the winter. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the leading cause of bronchiolitis. During the epidemic period, over 90% of diagnosed cases are caused by this virus. However, the incorporation of new molecular techniques such as RT-PCR in the last decade has enabled the detection of other additional viral agents. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence and etiology of respiratory viruses, as well as ascertain the involvement of mixed viral respiratory infections in children hospitalized during the winter of 2008-2009 in south-east of Spain.Methods: It was a prospective study during the bronchiolitis season (December-April). Children below 18 months-old admitted to the hospital for a first bronchiolitis episode were included. The study excluded all infants with previous episodes of bronchiolitis as well as those bronchiolitis cataloged as acquired in the hospital. Nasopharyngeal aspirate were collected. It was performed a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (CLART \u00ae PneumoVir, Genomica) for the detection of 16 respiratory viruses including RSV A and B; influenza virus (Flu) A, B, and C; coronavirus (229E), adenovirus (ADV), rhinovirus (RV), parainfluenza (PI) 1\u22124; metapneumovirus (hMPV)A and B; bocavirus (hBoV) and enterovirus (echovirus). Results: 235 children were included. The mean age was 3.4 months (mean\u00b1SD months, 3.4\u00b13.3 months), range 8 days-17 months of which 78.7% were under 5 months-old. A total of 287 viruses were detected in NA from 204 infants (86.8%). Respiratory syncytial virus was the virus detected more frequently (56.4%) followed by rhinovirus. Co-infections were found in the 36% of children. The most common associations were respiratory syncytial virus A with rhinovirus (Figure1). Conclusions: This study showed that respiratory viruses were detected in most of the children below 18 months-old hospitalized with bronchiolitis and that 36% of them showed a mixed infection. 3/4 of the children had infection by RSV, whereas the frequency of infection with other respiratory viruses was low and mainly associated to mixed infections.R2447 Epidemiology of viral infections in acute respiratoryillnesses in children M.L.

Methods: Ninety-seven plasma samples from HIV patients and 37 plasma samples from HCV patients whose viraemia counts were obtained with Roche Cobas \u00ae Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor \u00ae Test v1.5 and Cobas \u00ae Amplicor HCV Monitor \u00ae Test, respectively, were tested with the new Roche Cobas \u00ae TaqMan \u00ae HIV and Cobas \u00ae TaqMan \u00ae HCV Tests. Five hundred microlitres of each of the 134 samples were extracted with the specific B protocol on the NucliSENS \u00ae easyMag\u2122 (bioM\u00e9rieux) instrument. The results obtained with the two different platforms were then compared. Results: Fifty-three out of the 97 HIV plasmas yielded viraemia counts lying within the linearity limits of both methods. The linear regression analysis for these samples generated a R2 (square of correlation coefficient) of 0.95 comparable with the R2 (0.94) given by Roche for Cobas \u00ae Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor \u00ae and Cobas \u00ae TaqMan \u00ae HIV with High pure extraction. Regarding the HCV test all 37 samples yielded results within linearity limits with both methods and the R2 was 0.97. Regarding HIV tests we could observe that the two tests were poorly correlated for the detection of viraemia counts below the lower limit of quantification (kappa correlation coefficient: 0.39). Conclusions: From these results we conclude that an extraction of plasma samples with the NucliSENS \u00ae easyMag\u2122 instrument can be used with both the Cobas \u00ae TaqMan \u00ae HIV and Cobas \u00ae TaqMan \u00ae HCV platforms instead of the High Pure manual extraction, avoiding cumbersome work and long manual hands-on time without significant changes in final results.Objectives: Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a group of small DNA viruses that cause warts and certain cancers and precancers of the skin lining the lower genital tract and mouth. The genital HPV types can be divided into two broad groups (low-risk and high-risk HPVs) depending upon their association (or lack of association) with cancers of the lower genital tract. Genital HPV is very common. It is the most common viral sexually transmitted infection (STI) and is likely to be the most common STI overall. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of HPV DNA, to determine HPV types distribution among women in 3 Cantons in Herzegovina and prevalence of hr HPV infection in different age groups of women (women over 30 years and under 30 years). Methods: A total of one hundred sixty (n = 160) women were retrospectively evaluated between March 2009 and December 2010. Abbott RealTime polymerase chain reaction was used to detect the presence of HPV types in cervicovaginal samples obtained from patients during gynecologic examination.

The new strains are common in endemic areas and demonstrate higher pathogenic properties. The purposes of this study included revealing and molecular-epidemiological characteristic of atypical V. cholerae strains isolated in Siberian and Far Eastern regions of Russia. Methods: Sample set included a toxigenic V. cholerae strains (n = 32) from patients and environmental samples, isolated during outbreaks and sporadic cases of cholera in 1970s and 1990s. Twenty nine strains belonged to ET biotype, including 19 and 8 strains isolated in Siberia and at the Far East during 1990s and 1970s, respectively. Two ET strains from European part of Russia and three CL strains were used as external group for comparison. V. cholerae eltor M-878 and V. cholerae cholerae 569B were used as a control. Biovar-specific identification of tcpA, rstC, rstR, hlyA, rtxA, rtxC genes and TLC-element were carried out by PCR as described previously. Allele-specific PCR (AS-PCR) for detection of ctxB genomovars was fulfilled according toMorita et al. (2008). Standard sequencing procedure of ctxB gene was performed for confirmation of AS-PCR results and for detection of numbers of ToxR-binding repeats in the zot-ctxA intergenic region. Results: Among total ET strains isolated during 1970s CT ET biotype gene (ctxB3) was revealed. ET strains isolated in 1990s harbored CT CL biotype gene (ctxB1). At the same time all these strains had ET biotype-specific genetic determinants. Among nearly all ET strains we observed four ToxR-binding repeats in the zot-ctxA intergenic region. ctxB1 strains demonstrated heterogeneous TCL and rstR pattern: part of TCL+ strains harbored rstREL, part of TCL+ and all TLC\u2212 strains had both rstREl and rstRCL.Conclusion: Three genotypes of atypical ET strains imported from different regions were revealed (ctxB1TLC+rstRET+rstRCL\u2212; ctxB1TLC+rstREL+rstRCL+ and ctxB1TLC\u2212rstREL+rstRCl+). Analysis atypical ET genotypes allowed to conclude a consecutive acquisition of genetic determinants from CL biotype and formation of more pathogenic clones.Objective: Diarrheal diseases can be caused by viruses that belong to different species, but rotaviruses are most often the cases of severe diarrhea with fatal consequences. The aim of the present study was the investigation of rotavirus circulation among children under 5 years old, hospitalized with severe diarrhea in different regions of Ukraine and rotavirus genotype identification. Methods: Stool specimens were selected from 600 young children under 5 year old, hospitalized in 6 Ukrainian regions: South, North, West, East, Center and Kyiv from 2006 to 2009. The detection of rotaviruses group A was performed by chromatographic immunoassay (CITO TEST ROTA, CerTest Biotec. S.L., Spain). All specimens positive for rotaviruses were confirmed and identified by RT-PCR (AmpliSens \u00ae Rotavirus-290, InterLabService, Russia). Results: It was shown that proportion of severe diarrhea, caused by rotaviruses in 5 regions of Ukraine in the period of study was: in the East \u2212 10% in the South \u2212 44,5% in the North \u2212 24,8% in the West \u2212 45,4%, in the Center \u2212 21,1%. The winter-spring seasonality was confirmed, and it was found that in the age group of children under 3 years the average frequency of rotavirus identification was the highest and amounted to 70,1\u00b14,0%. As a result among 210 positive samples it was detected G-genotype in 182 cases (86,7%) and P-genotype in 176 cases (83,8%). P-genotype and G-genotype were not identified in 3,3% and 4,3% of samples, respectively.In 5,7% of samples both genotypes were not identified. It was shown that during each epidemic season from 2006 to 2009 in Ukraine G1P[8] was the dominant genotype, which varied from 30% to 80% of all positive samples. The second most distributed genotype was G4P[8] (40%), third \u2212 genotype G3P[8] (25%), and the fourth \u2212 G2P[8] (11%). During the epidemic period 2006-2009 in Kiev, for the first time genotype G9P[8] was identified in 5% of cases. Thereafter it was found seldom during 2007, then appeared in rare cases. In some clinical samples multiple genotypes were identified: G1P[8] + G3; G1P[8] + G2; G3P[8] + G4. Genetic variant G2P[4] was the cause of rare cases of diarrhea during the studied period. Conclusions: For the first time the features of rotavirus group A circulation in Ukraine among children under 5 years old were shown. The obtained data of the major rotavirus genotypes has a great importance in deciding the implementation of specific prevention of rotavirus diarrhea in Ukraine.R2456 Cost-effectiveness of PCR versus culture for MRSA in hospitals: evaluation of the published evidence O.

The obtained PFGE profiles were analyzed using GelCompar software. The UPGMA algorithm was used as the clustering method, with 2% band tolerance and 1.5% optimization settings with the Dice coefficient. PFGE profiles obtained for clinical isolates and vaccine strains were compared to B. pertussis PFGE reference strains. Results: Among 111 strains isolated in the period from 1995-2005, 59 PFGE-XbaI and 64 PFGE-AflII profiles were identified. In the period 1960-1977, 18 PFGE-XbaI and 24 PFGE-AflII profiles were found among 29 strains. B. pertussis strains from 1960-1977 typed with PFGE-XbaI, were classified into 2 clusters: A and B, and 2 groups: III and IV. The same set of strains typed with PFGE-AflII, were found in 3 clusters: Afl-A, Afl-B and Afl-III. B. pertussis strains isolated within 1995-2005, typed with PFGE-XbaI, were found in the groups III, IV and V and in clusters A and C. All currently used vaccine strains were found in the group III. In the period from 1995-2005, compared with the period from 1960-1977, frequency of strains belonging to groups III and IV and cluster A increased, new group V and new cluster C have been found and cluster B has disappeared. According to PFGE-AflII results, new clusters: Afl-C, Afl-D, Afl-E and Afl-IV have been recognized and cluster Afl-B has disappeared. In the period 1995-2005 genetic similarity has not changed significantly.Conclusions:The study showed that genetic similarities of B. pertussis strains coming from1995-2005 and 1960-1977  do not differ significantly and represent level 80.5-81.8% for PFGE-XbaI and 77\u221279% for PFGE-AflII.

Demirpek, Z. Erdem, O. Yildiz, B. Bozdogan* (Aydin, TR) Introduction: Recurrent infections are not low among urinary tract infections (UTI). One of the most important complications for patient with spinal cord injury is urinary tract infections. Recurrence rate of UTI among these patients are very high. One of the main questions is if these recurrent infections are due to the same clone or different clones. The aim of this study was to evaluate clonality of infectious agents isolated from urinary samples of patients with spinal cord injury. Materials and Methods: A total of 68 E. coli isolates from 23 patients were included to present study retrospectively. Of 23 patients 13 were women (56,5%) and 10 men (43,5%). All patients had at least 3 samples. The antimicrobial susceptibilities of recurrent infection agents were tested by disk diffusion method. Clonality was tested by PFGE. Total DNA was restricted with XbaI and DNA fragments were separated using CHER DR III. Results: Among 23 patients 21 were infected with the same clone at least twice. Among these patients 50% were women and 50% were men. Of 68 E. coli isolates from 23 patients, were 9 days minimum and 200 days maximum. Of 22 clones 12 were ESBL positive. A total of 31 isolates were among 12 ESBL clones. Clones isolated from women were relatively lower (56,5%) than from men (43,5%). Discussion: The present study showed high rates of clonal urinary tract infections among patients with spinal cord injury. Further studies are needed to evaluate risk factors for recurrent urinary tract infections among patients with spinal cord injury.

In contrast, an increase in the isolation of enterococci and Candida species during the warm months of the year was noted. Specifically, 52.2% of enterococci and 60.8% of Candida species were isolated during June-September or 68.5% and 70.3%, respectively, during May-September. The same was true for Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. For these microorganisms, the 75.0%, 52.2% and 45.3%, respectively, of the isolates were recovered during June-September or 76.6%, 56.7% and 57.2%, respectively, during May-September.Conclusions:Our data suggest a seasonal variation with an increase of the bloodstream infections caused by enterococci, some Gram-negative rods and Candida species during the warm months of the year.R2467 Evaluation of Copan SL-solution for pre-treatment of lower respiratory samples for bacterial culture inoculation on the automated Walk away specimen processor (WASP)A. Bielli*,A. Berlingeri, E. Mirone, M.P. Landini (Bologna, IT)    Objectives: Respiratory specimens (RS) contains a lot of mucus that must be dissolved before plating. Copan has introduced to the market the SL-Solution (SL), a ready to use tubes with 1.0 ml of mucus dissolving solution. The objectives of our study were to compare: 1) the performance of SL versus Sputasol (SP) (Oxoid) for pre-treatment of RS; 2) manual plating versus automated plating before implementing RS inoculation on the Walk away specimen processor (WASP). AFN were tested in duplicate, one sample was prepared using a 1:1 (vol/vol) ratio (RS/SP), vortexed and incubated for 30 minutes at 35\u00baC, the other sample was prepared by transferring 1 ml of specimen to a tube of SL to obtain a 1:1 ratio (RS/SL). The other 127 samples were tested in duplicate: un-treated and SL treated. Ten microliters of RS treated or untreated samples were manually plated, samples in SL tubes were loaded on the WASP and processed following the WASP protocol (Vortex at 2500 RPM for 30 seconds and plated with 10 ul loop). All samples were incubated as per laboratory SOPs at 24 and 48 hours for semi-quantitative bacteria growth.Results: Among the 166 samples processed, 100 were positive (30 ESP and AFN, 70 ABR and BRL) and 66 had no significant growth; no qualitative differences were noted between manual and automated streaking on the WASP. In the 30 ESP and AFN positive, pre-treated with SP and SL, there was 100% agreement for bacteria and fungi strains isolation and 93% agreement (28/30) when analyzing the bacterial load, 77% agreement (23/30) for the fungi. Manual plating of untreated ABR and BRL vs. SL pre-treated (diluted 1:2) had 100% agreement for isolated bacteria and fungi and 91% agreement (64/70) for bacterial load, 89% agreement (62/70) for the fungi. A 99% agreement (76/77) was noted in the semi quantitative evaluation of bacteria (manually vs. Wasp-plated). The loads differences of 1 log in SL that were noted mainly with Candida, may due to the 1:2 SL dilution factor uneven sampling and inconsistency evaluation for seeding in quadrants.Conclusions:Copan SL-Solution demonstrated an excellent performance and results agreement compared to the Sputasol with both manual and WASP plating. It's easy to use, doesn't require a pre incubation step and samples in SL tube can be loaded directly on the WASP.R2468 Quantitative comparison of new liquid-based transport swabs for aerobic and anaerobic organism recoveryH. Gough*, C. Yates, F.M. Awadel-Kariem (Stevenage, UK)Background: The development and introduction of automation to inoculate and streak samples in Microbiology laboratories, will lead to a move from gel based transport swabs to liquid based transport systems.Objectives: To compare and evaluate the survival of fastidious organisms in two liquid based transport swabs (Copan Eswab \u00ae and Medical Wire S \u00ae swabs) against two gel based systems (Copan M40 and Medical Wire Transwab \u00ae ). The Eswab \u00ae has a flocked swab in 1mL of modified liquid Amies, and is designed to elute the entire sample into the medium. The S \u00ae swab is foam tipped in 1mL of liquid Amies. Method: The study was based on CLSI procedure M40-A using the quantitative elution method for the liquid based swabs and the roll plate method for the gel swabs, to evaluate performance. Suspensions of Neisseria gonorrhoeae ATCC 43069, Haemophilus influenzae ATCC 10211, Streptococcus pneumoniae ATCC 6305, Streptococcus pyogenes ATCC 6305, Fusobacterium nucleatum ATCC 25586, Prevotella melaninogenica ATCC 25845 and Peptostreptococcus anaerobius ATCC 27337 were prepared by diluting 0.5 McFarlane solutions, made from fresh cultures. The swabs, in triplicate, were inoculated by immersion in 100 mL of the suspensions for 10 seconds. Recovery was measured by quantitative plate counts after 0, 24, and 48 hours storage at room temperature. Results: After 24 hours P. anaerobius, S. pneumoniae and S. pyogenes were recovered from all swabs. F. nucleatum, P. melaninogenica and N. gonorrhoeae were recovered from the Eswabs \u00ae and Copan gel swabs only. H. influenzae was recovered from both the Eswab \u00ae and the S \u00ae swabs. At 48 hours only S. pyogenes was recovered from all swabs. P. anaerobius, F. nucleatum, P. melaninogenica and H. influenzae were recovered from the Eswabs but not the S swabs. N. gonorrhoeae was not recovered from any swabs after 48 hours. The highest number of organisms recovered was consistently achieved with the Eswab \u00ae . Conclusions: The best results were obtained by the Eswab \u00ae ; which showed superior recovery of all the organisms, compared to the others tested. It would be an acceptable transport system for these fastidious organisms. It is also suitable for use with automated inoculation systems. Background: Rickettsiae are a group of bacteria that cause disease in both animals and humans. The cause of Mediterranean spotted fever is Rickettsia conorii, transmitted to humans by the dog tick Rhipicephalus sanguineus. Rickettsia mooseri is the cause of mourine or endemic typhus and is transmitted to humans by the rat flea Xenopsylla cheopis. Purpose: The aim of the study was to determine the prevalence of rickettsial infection among patients with clinically suspected rickettsiosis. Also the distribution among several demographic variables, including sex, age, and season during the period 2000-2010 was evaluated. Methods: Serum samples were collected from 903 patients (537 males, 366 females aged 10 months to 85 years old) and tested by indirect immunofluorescence assay (Rickettsia conorii Spot IF, Rickettsia mooseri",

Methods: 273 serum samples were collected from patients with different antibody status according to Biotrin EIA: 112 IgG positive-IgM negative samples, 51 IgM positive samples and 110 IgG negative samples. Potential cross-reactions were evaluated using 45 serum samples from patients with other infectious diseases (n = 30) or immunological pathologies (n = 15). LIAISON \u00ae results were compared with those obtained with the Biotrin Parvovirus B19 EIA. Discordant results between LIAISON \u00ae and EIA were confirmed by Biotrin Parvovirus B19 Immunofluorescent Assay (IFA). Results: Of the IgG positive-IgM negative group we found one sample was IgM positive by LIAISON \u00ae , negative by IFA. Of the IgM positive group, two sera were negative by LIAISON \u00ae . One was confirmed negative and one was weakly positive by IFA. Of the IgG negative group no discrepancies were found between the two tests. Of the potentially cross-reactive IgM samples, 2 were positive with LIAISON \u00ae , one of them was negative with EIA but both were positive with IFA. One showed doubtful results with the three methods. All those three false positive samples came from patients with acute CMV infection. Coefficients of variation for interassay variability for IgG and IgM antibodies were 4.5% and 4%, respectively. Conclusions: The agreement between LIAISON \u00ae and Biotrin EIA was 100% for IgG. Concerning IgM we observed 3 discrepancies, of which 1 was confirmed by IFA. We can conclude that the fully automated LIAISON \u00ae Biotrin Parvovirus B19 CLIA kits showed a good agreement with Biotrin EIA for detection of IgG and IgM antibodies.R2471 Increase of efficiency of antigen p24 HIV-1 detectionI.

Bandehpour (Tehran, IR)    Objectives: Echinococcosis or hydatid disease is a zoonotic infection caused by larval (metacestode) stages of cestodes belonging to the Echinococcus, family Taeniidae. Echinococcus granulosus causes human cystic echinococcosis which is an important public health problem in many regions of the world. There are some problems in primary diagnosis such as cross-reaction with sera from patients with other parasitic disease in serological tests. The use of an appropriate source of antigenic material is a very important and crucial point in the improvement of the serodiagnostic features such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method. Methods: We expressed and purified recombinant AgB of Echinococcus granulosus and used as antigen in ELISA method. Serum samples were given from 36 cystic hydatid disease patients that have been confirmed by surgical operation as well as 36 healthy individuals sera were tested by ELISA method using recombinant AgB and compared with commercial kit (Euroimmun) for specificity and sensitivities value. The sensitivity of 91.66% and specificity of 90.16% were determined by homemade kit. Results: In this study, recombinant EgAgB (24 kDa) was expressed and purified. The purified protein was coated onto ELISA microplates and tested in an anti-IgG ELISA with sera from patients with or without CHD and healthy individuals.sensitivity and specificity of ELISA test in 36 positive samples and 51sero negative samples were estimated respectively in order as 91.66% and 90.16%. Conclusion: Overally we came to this conclusion that our results have confirmed the previous studies regarding the detection value of the recombinant antigen. Although our findings are in common with other previous studies in case of high Specificity and sensitivity of this antigen for hydatidosis diagnosis with ELISA test as well. Therefore, the purified recombinant AgB in this study is one of the desirable Ag for the fast and accurate diagnosis of hydatidosis. Therefore, performing this method on more samples and doing more wide researches make it possible to reach more valuable and conclusive results.",

Methods: During one year (2008) data of cap defined criteria were recorded from every adult patient of who the test was requested. Fever was defined as the temperature was above 38.1\u00baC. Not only the emergence of a new infiltrate on chest radiography but it was made prior to the request of the test was recorded. Clinical symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection recorded were: malaise, cough, dyspnea and chest pain. Data was recorded and entered into a computer database. Results: During the period of study 1085 test were requested from the emergency unit to the Laboratory. Only for 227 (20.92%) of the patients a temperature above 38.1\u00baC was detected, 291 (28.82%) had respiratory symptoms and for 392 (36.1%) patients the chest x-ray was made prior to the test although only in 153 (14.1%) of them a new infiltrate could be demonstrated. The number of positive test was 129 (11.86%) and for 398 (36.68%) of the patients who the test was requested it did not meet any of the criteria. Conclusions: The rapid urinary antigen test for diagnosis of pneumococcal community-acquired pneumonia has been widely validated in adults. However in our Hospital it is being using in many patients who don't meet the request criteria given by the Hospital. Probably it is due to several factors; The test can be demanded from the laboratory request form along other urine test in a very easy way and that an important number of physicians working at the emergency unit are in their training period from many different medical and surgical specialities and probably they do not know exactly what are the criteria for application the test given by the Hospital. It would be interesting to know the number of patients diagnosed of cap with a positive test for who the empirical treatment for cap was adjusted after receiving the result of the test, although it was not included in the aim of this work.R2480 Diagnostic vaule of procalcitonin for infection or noninfection in patients with systemic inflammatory response syndromeH.X.

The language of the researches wasn't limited. Inclusion criteria were established based on validity criteria for diagnostic research. Subsequently, the characteristics of the included articles including study background, design information and diagnostic parameters were extracted. Statistical analysis was performed by employing Meta-DiSc 1.4 and SPSS 12. 0 software. To check for publication bias, a funnel plot, using Egger's linear regression method, was constructed. Heterogeneity of the included articles was tested for selecting proper effect model (fixed effects or random effects model) to calculate pooled weighted, sensitivity, specificity and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve was made and the area under the curve (AUC) and Q* index was calculated. Finally, sensitivity analysis and comparison of sensitivity among different groups were performed. Results: 20 articles (6 English articles, 11 Chinese articles and 1other language articles) were included finally, with 1258 total patients. No significant heterogeneity and no publication bias was observed The sensitivity and specificity of PCT for the differentiation of infectious versus non-infectious systemic inflammatory response syndrome were 0.76 (95% CI = 0.73-0.79) and 0.8 (95% CI = 0.77-0.83) respectively.Introduction: Appropriate conservation of specimens is one of the most critical steps in the microbiological study of infectious diseases.Objective.

Extra-genitourinary infections caused by this species are described in the literature. However, it is still a rare pathogen cultured from cerebrospinal fluid. H1N1 influenza pneumonia can mimic cardiac diseases especially pulmonary edema and pulmonary emboli. High level of suspicion is required in outbreak periods. DNA of Borrelia afzelii has been found in aortic valves from two patients. Mixed infection has been found in two patients. DNA characteristic for Bartonella spp. were detected in valves and DNA of C. burnetii in myocardium. DNA of Rickettsia spp. was not found. mechanics and electricians. According to information on possible exposure in the group of family members and all those occasionally spending time on the farms an attack rate of 11.0% was determined. Clinical symptoms presented 26 persons. There was no correlation between level of serum antibodies and positive results in PCR.Conclusions:In Poland infected cattle is the main source of infections for humans.

Gr\u00fcnewald (Leipzig, DE)    Objective: HIV-infected individuals are prone to several metabolic disturbances and are at higher risk for premature arteriosclerosis compared to HIV-negative persons. Homocysteine is an intermediate product of methionine metabolism; hyperhomocysteinemia may indicate functional deficiency of either folate, vitamin B12 and vitamin B6. Additionally, large population-based series have documented hyperhomocysteinemia as an independent risk factor for atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular incidents. Little is known about the role of hyperhomocysteinemia in individuals with HIV infection. Goal of this study was to describe the extent of hyperhomocysteinemia in HIV-infected patients with or without antiretroviral treatment. Patients and Methods: In 139 HIV-infected individuals from a single outpatient clinic homocysteine was determined. Results were correlated with clinical, laboratory, immunological and virological parameters. In 22 of those (15,8%) assays for folate, vitamin B12 and vitamin B6 were done and compared to the results of homocysteine serum levels. Results: In 98 (70.5%) patients homocysteine was elevated (median serum levels 13.8 mmol/l, range 7.6-27.2). Individuals with HIV-1 viral load below detection limit (20 copies/ml) had no difference in homocysteine levels compared to those with detectable viral loads (median homocysteine 13.95 vs 13.6, p > 0.9). There was a trend towards an inverse correlation of homocysteine with the extent of immunodeficiency (p = 0.148) with the highest homocysteine values in those with CD4+ T lymphocyte counts below 0.2/nl. Also, no difference was found in patients on antretrovirals vs. na\u00efve patients. In neither examined case (n = 22) an association of homocysteine levels with cobalamine, pyridoxine or folate deficiency was found. Conclusions: Hyperhomocysteinemia is a common feature in HIVinfected individuals. Elevations are not significantly correlated to either immunological or virological parameters although there was a trend towards higher levels in severely immunocompromised patients neither are there inverse correlations with folate, cobalamine or pyridoxine plasma concentrations. If this reflects the significance of homocysteine as an independent biomarker for premature arteriosclerosis remains to be determined.R2664 Late diagnosis of HIV infection in Iasi County, Romania \u2212 frequency, associated factors, therapeutical optionsA. Vata*, C. Manciuc, C. Nicolau, L. Prisacariu, L. Vata, C. Dorobat (Iasi, RO)Late diagnosis of HIV infection has unfavorable repercussions on both the patients themselves \u2212 due to higher morbidity and mortality rates \u2212 and the society as a whole, given the higher infection transmission risks and increased therapy and recovery costs. Material and Method: Retrospective study of na\u00efve patients that have entered the records of the Regional HIV/AIDS Center of Iasi over the last 10 years(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004)(2005)(2006)(2007)(2008)(2009)(2010), based on the initial clinical, paraclinical and therapeutic data found in the follow-up charts of these patients. Late diagnosis was established when the patient presented for care with a CD4 count below 350 cells/mL or having an AIDS-defining event.Results: 73.4% of the 192 patients included in the study were considered late presenters (58.5% with advanced HIV infection), according to the latest consensus definition. The average age of late presenters was 23.7 years, 53.9% of them being born between 1998 and 1991; M/F ratio \u2212 1.3, U/R ratio \u2212 1.14, average CD4 number \u2212 130.8/mm3. The factors usually associated with late diagnosis in literature (patients over 30 years of age, males, co-infection with hepatitis viruses) had no statistical significance in our study group. Mortality rates were considerably higher in late presenters (31.9 vs. 7.8%, p = 0.002) and were correlated with a low number of CD4 (p < 0.001), younger age (p = 0.004); 57.8% of the deaths occurred within 6 months from diagnosis. ARV therapy was started by combining 2 INRT and IP in 52.7% of the patients, 2 INRT and one INNRT in 32.1% of them. Conclusion: Late diagnosis rates were higher in Iasi County than in literature, while the risk factors detected by other authors had no statistical significance, possibly due to the regional epidemiological specificity.

Kordossis (Athens, GR)    Objective: Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease is an increasing menace for patients with HIV infection. Aortic distensibility (AD) is an elasticity index of the aorta, and reflects aortic stiffness. Reduced AD is considered as an early marker of atherosclerosis. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that AD is lower in HIV-infected patients compared to healthy controls. Methods: One hundred and five HIV-infected patients (86 males, mean age 41\u00b10.92 years), including 60 patients with AIDS, and 124 age and sex matched HIV-uninfected controls (104 males, mean age 39.2\u00b11.03 years) were evaluated by high-resolution ultrasonography to determine AD. Measurement of carotid intima media thickness (c-IMT) was also performed. For all patients and controls clinical and laboratory factors associated with atherosclerosis were recorded. For HIV-infected patients, clinical and laboratory parameters such as the CD4(+) cell count, HIV viral load, disease stage and exposure to HAART were recorded, as well. Results: HIV infected patients had significantly reduced AD in comparison with the control subjects: 2.2\u00b10.01 vs 2.62\u00b10.01 10 \u22126 cm 2 dyn \u22121 , respectively (p < 0.001). No statistically significant difference was found in c-IMT between the two groups. In univariate analysis obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, hypercholesterolemia, systolic and diastolic hypertension, smoking, family history of cardiovascular disease and HIV infection were predictors for AD. In multiadjusted analysis, though, the most influential predictor of decreased distensibility was HIV infection (b \u22120.43, p < 0.001). Moreover, in multiadjusted analysis among HIVinfected patients, only increasing age was significant contributing factor for decreased AD. Conclusion: This study underscores the significant role of HIVinfection in the pathogenesis of early atherosclerosis, as depicted from decreased AD. Among HIV-infected patients, increasing age is a further contributing parameter to decreased AD.R2667 Drug resistance mutations in HIV-1 CRF06_cpx viruses from anti-retroviral-treated patients in EstoniaM. Pauskar*, K. Huik, R. Avi, T. Karki, T. Krispin, S. Semjonova, J. Smidt, L. Novikova,\u00dc. Valvar, K. Ainsalu, I. Lutsar (Tartu, J\u00f5hvi, Narva, EE) Introduction: Development of drug resistance mutations (DRMs) is one of the greatest challenges of the successful HIV-1 ARV therapy. There are some studies but not all suggesting that character of DRMs might be HIV-1 subtype specific. The Estonian concentrated HIV epidemic is predominantly caused by the CRF06_cpx and CRF06/A viruses that are rich of naturally occurring polymorphisms in the protease (PR) region. Objectives: We aimed to evaluate the distribution of DRMs in HIV-1 CRF06_cpx in treatment experienced patients who have failed ARV therapy and to compare it with subtype B viruses. Methods: We included 97 patients sent to HIV drug resistance testing due to failure of ARV therapy between January 2008 and November 2010. Genomic viral DNA was sequenced in PR and reverse transcriptase (RT) region and DRMs were detected using Stanford University HIV-1 Drug Resistance Database. The data on ARV consumption in 2007 were collected by the State Agency of Medicines. Results: A total of 29%, 57% and 14% of patients, respectively were treated with regimens containing 1 PI + 2 NRTI, 1 NNRTI + 2 NRTI or both. Most patients (78/97) had failed first HAART regimen. Median viral load was 50,586 (QR 9,514; 261,418) and median CD4+ count 170 (QR 94; 260) cells/mm3. The most frequently used ARV agents were 3TC (0.57 DDD) followed by ddI (0.31 DDD), AZT (0.22 DDD), EFV (DDD 0.20) and LPVr (0.15 DDD). Altogether 83 viruses were successfully sequenced; majority (79%) belonging to the HIV-1 CRF06_cpx. There were 29 wild type viruses, 31 possessing resistance against two and 5 against three ARV classes. At least one primary DRM was detected in 54 cases (65%) including 42/54 of NRTI, 47/54 of NNRTI and 7/54 of PI resistance. In NRTI treated population the most common primary DRMs were M184I/V (36/42) and L74I/V (14/42), followed by K70E/R/Q and K219E (both 4/42) and T215Y/F (3/42). In NNRTI treated population the DRMs were as follows: K103N (38/47), V179E (19/47), V108I (6/47), K101E/N and G190A/S (both 5/47), others were seen in low frequency. In PI treated population the following primary DRMs were represented in decreasing order \u2212 L90M (3/7), M46I, I54V, V82S/A (all three 2/7), I47V and F53L in single case only. Conclusions: The distribution of DRMs HIV-1 CRF06_cpx viruses corresponds to the pattern seen in subtype B viruses with similar ARV treatment regimen in previous studies suggesting that resistance development rather depends on the ARV agent and not on the viral subtype. R2668 HIV testing in patients with hepatitis B and C infection in the United Kingdom M. Pavlides, R. Madhotra, M.M. Raza* (Milton Keynes, UK) Objectives: Universal HIV testing is recommended for those diagnosed with hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus (HBV and HCV) infection under the UK National Guidelines for HIV testing 2008. Offering and uptake of such testing should be reviewed annually by the Hepatology/Gastroenterology/Infectious Diseases (ID) team. The audit was done to ascertain the practice of universal HIV testing in this setting and to identify measures to improve things if necessary. Methods: This audit was done in a UK district general hospital and included all patients who tested positive for Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and/or hepatitis C antibody or PCR between Oct 2008 and September 2009. The pathology IT system was used to establish whether these patients had an HIV test. In addition we looked at testing for a second hepatitis virus (HBV/HCV) as well as other parameters in relation to their hepatitis infection (viral load, AST, genotype). Results: We identified 102 patients who tested positive for hepatitis C (98 antibody positive, 4 PCR positive). The tests were requested by specialist teams (gastroenterology/genitourinary medicine/ID) in 39 (38%) patients. 51 patients (50%) had HIV serology checked of whom 6",

Chang  (Hsin-Chu, Taipei, TW)    Objective: Incidence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been increasing in HIV-infected patients in several western countries, where clustering of HCV infection was recently detected among men who have sex with men (MSM). The objective of this study was to investigate the incidence of and associated factor with recent HCV infection in HIVinfected patients in Taiwan. Methods: From June 1994 to November 2010, HIV-positive MSM or heterosexuals with negative anti-HCV antibody at baseline and tests for anti-HCV at least twice within one year were included in the present study. Serial CD4, plasma HIV RNA load (PVL), and Venereal Disease Research laboratory (VDRL) titers were obtained at baseline and within 6 months of the last anti-HCV test. Recent syphilis was defined as new seroconversion or a 4-fold increase in VDRL titers within 6 months of the last anti-HCV test. The HCV NS5B fragment was amplified with the use of PCR and sequenced and the phylogenetic trees were constructed. Results: During the 16-year study period, 854 patients (39.8% [854/2143]), 699 MSM and 155 heterosexuals, were enrolled. After follow-up for 4223 person-years [PY], 22 patients (2.6%) had HCV seroconversion during follow-up, with an incidence rate of 5.210 per 1000 PY. All cases occurred during the last 5-year study period. The median duration from the last negative to the first positive anti-HCV was 183 days (range, 14-350 days). 4 HCV strains clustered in the phylogenetic analysis, and no genotype 4 or genetic relatedness with the reported strains in the western countries was observed. Compared with the patients without HCV seroconversion, patients with seroconversion were more likely to have syphilis at baseline (54.5% vs. 20.8%) and recent syphilis (40.0% [4/10] vs. 9.0% [57/631]) within 6 months of the last anti-HCV test (both P < 0.05), while no differences were observed between the two groups regarding age, CD4 count, or PVL. Syphilis at baseline (odds ratio [OR] 4.660; 95% CI, 1.917-11.330, P = 0.001) and older age (OR 1.043; 95% CI, 1.001-1.086, P = 0.001) were independent factors associated with HCV seroconversion after adjustment for HIV transmission routes. With age, HIV transmission route, and recent syphilis included in the model, only recent syphilis (OR 6.236; 95% CI 1.679-23.165, P = 0.006) was independently associated with HCV seroconversion. Conclusion: Recent HCV infection was increasing in HIV-infected MSM in Taiwan, which was associated with acquisition of syphilis.J.H. Cho, Y.H. Park*, J.H. Lee (Seoul, KR)The auxiliary police of Korea are a group of early 20s healthy men, who are conscripted police as an alternative military service. They live in a same space like military barrack, but have frequent contact with general population. So in case of contagious disease, rapid and easy spread, and need of isolation care can be predicted. During 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic, patients with influenza like illness (ILI) among them should be admitted and isolated for adequate infection control and treatment. We investigated the viral shedding duration and predictive factors of 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection in the young adults with these data. From 3rd November 2009 to 2nd February 2010 (prior to vaccination), we performed daily real time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test (Bioneer, AccuPower \u00ae New Inf.A Real-time PCR kit, Korea) to the all enrolled influenza patients till confirming negative result and checked the symptoms, physical findings and vital signs.Nasopharyngeal-swab samples for rRT-PCR were collected by a same doctor. During the study period, there are 62 patients were confirmed 2009 influenza A (H1N1) by rRT-PCR out of 104 ILI, and negative conversions in the serial tests were confirmed in 45 patients. These 45 patients were finally analyzed. The data were analyzed nonparametrically with Mann-Whitney U test by Windows SPSS 13. The median age of enrolled patients was 21 years old (19\u221222). The median duration of fever (interval from the onset of fever (body temperature 37.5\u00baC) to the time at which temperature <37.5\u00baC was attained and maintained for >24 hours) was 42 hours (9-132). Short febrile group included patients with shorter duration of fever than 24.5 hours (1st quartile of distribution). Adequate antiviral treatment was defined as administering antiviral agents within 48 hours after the onset of symptoms. Symptoms included fever (presented in 100% of patients), cough (95.6%), sputum (73.3%), sore throat (68.9%), rhinorrhea (73.3%) and gastrointestinal symptoms (26.7%). Viral shedding duration was defined as the time interval between the onset of symptoms and the last day of positive result of serial rRT-PCR test.R2672 CrimeanCongo haemorrhagic fever: modern approaches to diagnostics, epidemiology, prevention, therapy and preparedness G.

Materials and Methods: A retrospective study conductedduring 4 years  (2006-2009)  concerning all TB cases in the region of Sousse diagnosed according to bacteriological or histo-pathological and/or clinical criteria.Results:The total of TB cases is 494. The incidences noted for the period study were respectively 20.7, 20.6, 24.7 and 22.4. The mean age was 39.7 years, the sex ratio was 1.4. Close contact with patient was found in 29.7%. Twenty patients were prisoners. The mean delay for TB diagnosis was 45 days. Symptoms were predominated by cough and fever in pulmonary TB. HIV infection was noted in only 2 patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis. TB was 233 times pulmonary and 261 times extra pulmonary (31% lymph nodes). Bacteriology confirmed the diagnosis in 207 cases; microscopy was positive in 67.6% of pulmonary TB cases and 15.9% of extra pulmonary TB cases. Multidrug resistance (MDR) was observed for 8 strains/patients. Mortality attributed directly to TB was 0.2%. Conclusion: TB remains endemic in our region. TB location is primarily lung and lymph nodes. TB is not related to HIV infection. MDR and mortality attributed to TB are rare in our region.

Methods: We selected 61 children aged <16 years, with a history of close contact with culture-confirmed TB patients. Clinical, radiological and microbiological data (smear microscopy and culture of sputa or gastric aspirates) were collected prospectively, previous a signed informed consent. We calculated the number of children diagnosed with TB according to the Fourie, Keith-Edwards, Migliori and SATVI (The South African Trial Vaccine Initiative) diagnostic scoring systems. Differences between case frequencies were calculated using the McNemar test with Yates correction. The simple percent agreement and the concordance (Cohen's Kappa coefficient) for the binary results (TB/Not TB) were calculated. Strength of agreement was classified using Landis and Koch categories. Results: Childhood TB case frequency varied from 19.67% using the Fourie scoring system to 85.25% using the SATVI scoring system. Significant difference in case frequency (P < 0.05) occurred in 8 of 10 pair-wise comparisons between diagnostic scoring systems. The simple percent agreement varied from 6.93% to 78.68% (median: 68.81%). Cohen's kappa ranged from 0.15 to 0.48 (median: 0.34). There was a high variability in the case frequency between the different scoring systems. The strongest concordance (moderate) found was between Keith-Edwards and SATVI scoring systems (Kappa: 0.48); with a concordance median value in the fair agreement category (Kappa: 0.2\u22120.4).Conclusion:Although this study doesn't support the systematic use of the investigated diagnostic scoring systems for the diagnosis of childhood TB in Warao children, the criteria that showed high frequency and moderate concordance (SATVI and Keith-Edwards) could be used as important tools in the screening of childhood contacts of TB patients.R2677 Tuberculosis revisited: a 10-year experience from a tertiary hospital outpatient infectious diseases clinicA.

Fever was present in 36.5%, appetite and/or weight loss in 14.1%, cough in 16.5%, bone-joint pain in 23.4% and neurological signs in 11.8% (the last two directly related to the site of infection). Plain chest radiography (PR) was positive in 36.5% and CT scan in 46% of pts adding significant diagnostic clues. Direct sputum examination (DE) was positive in 36.5%; in 55% of them plain radiograph was insignificant. Cultures were positive in 50pts (58.8%); in 50% of them DE was negative. PCR was positive in 27/28 cases, contributing to the diagnosis of 17 additional cases; the same was true for 11 biopsies. Among 48 sensitivity tests 89.6% revealed fully sensitive MTB, whereas only two were multidrug-resistant. Median duration of treatment was 9 months (mo) [range 2\u221224]; for pulmonary TB 6mo. Drug toxicity experienced 21/85 pts (24.7%), mostly as liver toxicity attributed to rifampin. Successful treatment was confirmed in 73/78 (93.6%); 7 pts (8.2%) were lost to follow-up. Among 4 pts who failed treatment, 3 died (mortality 3.8%). Conclusions: Traditional diagnostic methods (DE, cultures, PR) retain a singificant diagnostic value, which can be significantly augmented by the addition of newer diagnostic techniques as CT and PCR. Molecular methods added importantly in the diagnosis of extrapulmonary TB. Particularities of the population served by our reference center could probably explain the epidemiological features observed regarding risk factors and clinical picture. R2678 Highly individualised treatment for XDR-/MDRtuberculosis: case series from a single centre T. Gr\u00fcnewald*, S. H\u00f6hne, I. Raila, S. Weigold, T. Marcello, K. Schreiter, N. Schultheis, R. Schr\u00f6der, M. Lindner, B.R. Ruf (Leipzig, Zwickau, DE) Objective: Treatment options for patients with extensively resistant (XDR) or multi-drug resistant (MDR) tuberculosis (TB) are highly limited. Individualized treatment using WHO group II, IV or V tuberculostatic substances may improve outcomes. Goal: To determine the clinical and microbiological outcomes of patients with confirmed MDR-or XDR-TB. Patients and Methods: Retrospective analysis of all MDR-and XDR-TB cases in a single tertiary referral centre. Outcomes were correlated with underlying conditions, treatment schedules, duration of treatment and microbiological treatment response. Results: From 2006 to 2009 eleven patients with either XDR (n = 5) orMDR-TB (n = 6) were recorded. Pulmonary manifestations were present in 10/11, one patient had only extrapulmonary tuberculosis (pleural, mammary and lymph node involvement). Disseminated disease involving lung, liver, spleen, lymph nodes or central nervous system was found in three patients. Eight out of eleven patients were from Eastern Europe (Russia, Ukraine, Georgia) two from Asia (Iran, Afghanistan), and one from Africa (Cameroon). Underlying condition were found in four (HIV infection, n = 1; HCV infection, n = 2, HIV/HCV co-infection, n = 1). Nearly all (10/11) had at least one incomplete tuberculostatic pretreatment (duration 3 months to five years, in all cases non-compliance was documented). Isolated strains were resistant to a median of five antituberculous drugs (range 3\u22128). Treatment regimens provided by DOT in every patient included mainly WHO group IV and V drugs with at least three drugs selected by susceptibility testing (median 3, range 3\u22125). Two patients underwent surgery (lung surgery, n = 1; pleurectomy, n = 1). Microbiological, radiological and clinical cure was documented in 10/11 (72.7%). One patient died after upper lobe resection because of pulmonary thromboembolism. Conclusions: Prognosis in patients having at least three effective substances left is favourable. Complete cure can be achieved by implementing DOT strategies for the long-term therapy. Drug compliance history is crucial for estimating prognosis and directs the management of patients especially with XDR-TB.R2679 Rapid detection ofMycobacterium tuberculosis complex in spinal aspirate from cases of Pott's spine at tertiary care hospital, North India M. Kumar*, V. Nag, R. Kumar, S. Babu, A. Maurya, U. Singh,T. Dhole  (Lucknow, IN)    Objectives: Tuberculosis of spine causing paraplegia is common and increasing its prevalence in developing country like India. Spinal tuberculosis (Pott's disease) covers 50% of the cases of skeletal tuberculosis. 15% of the cases extra pulmonary tuberculosis and 2% of all cases of tuberculosis. It has poor prognosis due to late diagnosis. Therefore, rapid diagnosis is essential to decrease the morbidity and mortality of this disease. Conventional methods are time consuming and of low sensitivity. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based diagnosis provide fast diagnostic tool and hope for early diagnosis of this disease. The aim of the study was to compare assess the applicability of rapid methods i.e. PCR, BACTEC culture and Microscopy for detection of mycobacterium tuberculosis complex (MTBC) in spinal specimens from cases of suspected Pott's spine admitted at tertiary care hospital in North India. Method: Sixty two non-repeated clinical samples of suspected cases of Pott's disease were included. All the samples were processed for Ziehl-Neelsen staining for acid fast bacilli (AFB) and BACTEC culture for M. tuberculosis. All the samples were also processed for PCR amplification with primers targeting 123 bp fragment of insertionelement IS6110 of M. tuberculosis complex. The Sensitivity, specificity and positive-negative predictive value were assessed for ZN stain and PCR. Kappa coefficient calculated for agreement culture between ZN stain and PCR. Result: Out of 62 suspected Pott's cases 32 (51.6%) cases were male and 28 (49.4%) cases were female. ZN staining detected AFB in 19 (30.6%); BACTEC culture was positive for MTBC in 27 (43.5%) and PCR detected MTBC in 33 (53.2%) cases. BACTEC culture was considered as the gold standard. The Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value (PPV&NPV) were 96%, 80%, 79%, 97% correspondingly. The sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV of ZN staining were 52%, 91%, 82% and 71% respectively. Kappa agreement between Culture with ZN (kappa 0.51), Culture with PCR kappa agreement (kappa 0.75) respectively. Conclusion: PCR disclosed good agreement with culture, hence PCR can be used for early diagnosis of tuberculosis in spinal samples (Pott's disease) that can help to initiate timely anti-tubercular treatment and prevent progression to irreversible changes. R2680 Pulmonary infections with non-tuberculous Mycobacteria: management under guidance of Infectious Diseases Board B. Gr\u00fcner*, G. H\u00e4rter, P. Kern (Ulm, DE) Objective: In recent years pulmonary infections with nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) appear to be increasing worldwide in HIV negative patients, although accurate data are lacking. Aim of the study was to evaluate clinical and treatment aspects in patients with pulmonary NTMinfections. Methods: In our center we included all patients with pulmonary NTMinfection without concomitant HIV-infection in the period from 2007 to 2010. All patients fulfilling the ATS (American Thoracic Society) criteria for NTM pulmonary infection were evaluated, and structured treatment recommendation was discussed in the interdisciplinary infectious diseases board (ID-Board). Results: Seven patients were diagnosed with pulmonary NTM-infection meeting the criterias given by the ATS. Five were female, two male; mean age was 55, 7 years of age (range 31\u221277 years). Microbiological specimens included Mycobacterium kansasii (3), M. xenopi (2), M. avium complex (MAC) (2). Radiological findings included disseminated small nodules (M. xenopi, MAC), infiltrates/nodules (M. kansasii, M. xenopi) and one cavitary lesion (MAC). Three women had malignancies: one received chemotherapy, another the monoclonal antibody Alemtuzumab, both had a complete course of antimycobacterial therapy for 12 or 24 month, respectively; the third with MAC had a stable clinical course, even if treatment has been stopped after 3 months due to side effects. From two patients with chronic pulmonary disease, one with M. kansasii is cured after 22 months of therapy, the other one with MAC-associated cavitary lesion is clinically stable while still under treatment (for 6 months). In two patients (M. kansasii, M. xenopi) we could not identify underlying risk factors. Conclusion:",

Amyl (Dasma, KW)Introduction: Knowledge of the prevelance of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection is crusial for effective TB control. In contacts of smear-positive pulmonary TB cases, tracing is usually done by tuberculin skin test (TST), chest radiography and clinical signs and symptoms of which are either nonspecific or difficult to interpret. Objectives: This prospective survey was done to compare the new interferon gama-release assay, T.Spot TB, (Oxford Immunotech, UK) with the conventional tests and to evaluate its value in the decision on administration of isoniazid (INH) chemoprophylaxis. Methods: All contacts of smear-positive pulmonary TB cases from November, 2008 till July, 2010 were included in the survy. They were screened by TST, T.Spot TB and chest radiography. Their nationality, BCG status together with the administration of INH prophylaxis were recorded. Results: Out of 743 contacts, 381 (51%) were Kuwaiti nationals and 691 (93%) were BCG-vaccinated. TST was above the cut off value (10mm) in 704 (95%) of the total. Only 55 (7%) of those contacts had abnormal chest X-ray findings. In BCG-vaccinated contacts, 660 (89%) showed TST above 10mm while only 355 (48%) of them had reactive T.Spot TB. Forty-four percent of the contacts with TST above 10mm had non-reactive T.Spot TB. Furthermore, out of 68 contacts with TST above 20mm, 26 still had non-reactive T.Spot TB. In contacts with reactive T.Spot TB, 347 (89%) had normal chest X-ray while only 42 (11%) had abnormal chest X-ray findings. Out of the 704 contacts with TST above 10mm, 363 contacts with reactive T.Spot TB correctly received INH prophylaxis, while 194 contacts with non-reactive T.Spot TB correctly did not receive INH prophylaxis. Follow up of those 194 contacts is being carried out for any possible active disease development. Till date non developed active disease. Conclusion: T.Spot TB, a type of interferon gama-release assay, shows promising results in the diagnosis of latent TB infection.R2682 Performance evaluation of an in-house interferon-g release assay in detecting tubercular infection in HIV patients L. Alagna, P. Scarpellini*, C. Fortis (Milan, IT) Objectives: To evaluate the performance of interferon-g release assays (IGRA) in relation to CD4 count in a group of patients with HIV infection with a risk of tubercular infection. Methods: 132 patients (pts) [M = 100, F = 32] with HIV infection, have been tested with IGRA: 113 pts because suspected of active tuberculosis, 19 pts for screening. 91 pts were also tested with tuberculin skin test (TST). The home-made IGRA detects the number of specific interferon-g producing T cells by means of an enzyme-linked immunospot assay, using a restricted pool of synthetic highly immunogenic peptides derived from ESAT-6 and CFP-10 proteins (IGRA ESAT6-CFP10). The interferon g response to purified protein derivative (PPD) was also measured (IGRA PPD). IGRAs were considered positive for values greater than 20 spot forming cells per million lymphocytes (SFCML). CD4 cells count, collected within 3 months of IGRA, was performed and classified using four classes: CD4 <50 cells/ml, between 50 and 200 cells/ml, between 200 and 500 cells/ml and >500 cells/ml. Chi-square, Kruskal-Wallis, Mc Nemar test and k statistics were calculated. Results: The four classes considered do not differ for gender and place of birth distributions and for the median age (respectively chi square: p = 0.7852, p = 0.5958; Kruskal Wallis test: p = 0.4638). Among different CD4 cell count classes, no differences in the distribution of the IGRA ESAT6-CFP10 qualitative results and in the means of quantitative measures were found (chi square: p = 0.4412; Kruskal Wallis test: p = 0.4458). Considering the results of the TST and the IGRA PPD, no differences in distribution were found among the CD4 classes (chi square: p = 0.2221 and p = 0.823). Fair agreement was found between TST and IGRA PPD in the whole sample (k = 0.378, McNemar p 0.0001). In particular poor agreement was found in classes of CD4 <50 cells/ml (k = 0.111, McNemar p = 0.0133), fair agreement between 50-200 cells/ml (k = 0.364, Mc-Nemar p = 0.364), fair agreement between 200-500 cells/ml (k = 0.371, McNemar p = 0.0233) and good agreement in pts with CD4 >500 cells/ml (k = 0.831, McNemar p = 1). Conclusions: Our results show that IGRAs performance are not influenced by a different CD4 cells count levels.",

Methods: Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining was performed in 2796/2949 various samples. Inoculation of 2438 samples onto L\u00f6wenstein-Jensen slants(LJ, bioM\u00e9rieux)  and 2189 into Bactec/9000MB culture vials (Becton Dickinson) was also carried out. Among 1858 samples, realtime PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex was applied (MTB, COBAS TaqMan MTB, Roche). Isolates were identified at species level by PCR and hybridization (GenoType MycobacteriumCM, Hain). Susceptibility testing was performed by phenotypic and genotypic methods (MGIT, Becton Dickinson and GenoType MTBDRplus, Hain, respectively). Results: ZN-positive were found 30 samples (1%). Twelve out of 24 tested (50%) were MTB-positive by RT-PCR. Nine out of 30 were LJpositive (30%), whereas 13/25 (52%) were Bactec-positive. RT-PCR was performed in 1819/2766 ZN-negative samples. Forty-five (2.5%) were MTB-positive and 26/2368 (1.1%) LJ-positive. Among Bactec vials, 27/2049 (1.3%) were positive. Forty-seven patients had positive culture by either method: 41 M. tuberculosis, three M. kansasii, and one of each M. avium, M. simiae, M. fortuitum. Susceptibility testing of 31 MTB showed that all were rifampicin-susceptible, while 28 were sensitive to isoniazid, 26 to ethambutol and 20 to streptomycin. The molecular method of 39 MTB showed 18 isoniazid-susceptible and one resistant, while 17 more carried one mutation (14/17 phenotypically susceptible). Furthermore, 14 were rifampicin-susceptible and 4 resistant, while 18 carried one mutation (16/18 phenotypically susceptible). Conclusions: Sensitivity of Bactec system is higher in ZN-positive samples (100%) compared to LJ medium (66.7%). Among ZN-negative samples the sensitivity of Bactec system and LJ medium is the same (62.9%). RT-PCR shows high sensitivity (100%) in ZN-positive and lower (68.4%) in ZN-negative samples. It is important to apply a molecular method for susceptibility testing, in order to discover mutated subpopulation, avoiding the predominance of completely resistant strains.R2684 Evaluation of the genotype microbacterium CM-Hain assay for identification of non-tuberculous Mycobacteria Species from clinical specimensM. Drago*, M.C. Sironi, C. Lacchini, D. Fanti, E. Mazzola, G. Gesu (Milan, IT)Although Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex is by far the most important mycobacterial species from a public health perspective, several non tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) species are associated with pulmonary disease. NTM are ubiquitous in environmental reservoirs and sometimes clinically insignificant colonization or contamination can be difficult to distinguish from true disease. Detection of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in stained smears is the first bacteriologic evidence of the presence of mycobacteria in a clinical specimen, but acid-fast bacteria seen on smear may represent either M. tuberculosis or NTM. A positive nucleic amplification technique (NAT) on an AFB-positive specimen is usually taken as evidence of infection with M. tuberculosis complex, while a negative NAT in such specimens means NTM infection. Unfortunately, NTM species identification still requires growth in culture media which often requires a prolonged incubation. We decided to test smear-positive, PCR negative respiratory specimens with a molecular assay based on the DNA strip technology (Genotype Mycobacterium CM-Hain \u00ae ) (GMCM) aimed to identify several NTM to a species level. After decontamination and concentration according to standard procedures, 23 AFB-positive respiratory samples which tested negative with a commercial PCR test (Xpert MTB_RIF, Cepheid \u00ae ) were submitted to GMCM-testing. The results obtained were compared with culture results after 56 days.Fifteen NTM (3 M. intracellulare, 4 M. avium, 4 M. kansasii, 3 M. xenopi, 1 M. chelonae) were detected by GMCM by this procedure. Four specimens were reported to contain M. abscessus by GMCM but no growth was detected by culture. Three specimens grew NTM (1 each of M. abscessus, M. intracellulare and M. avium) but were negative by GMCM. One AFB-positive specimen was negative by both GMCM and culture. For the 15 concordant specimens the mean time to positivity in culture was 11.5 days (range 5.0 to 26.0). Direct identification of NMT from AFB-positive specimens may be useful to reduce time to diagnosis.R2685 Extrapulmonary tuberculosis in fever of unknown originG. Stevanovic*, M.Pelemis, M.

Nikolic (Belgrade, RS)    Objectives: The aims of this study were to determine prevalence of extrapulmonary tuberculosis in patient with fever of unknown origin (FOU) who was HIV negative, to show prevalence of, and types of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and to determine trends of prevalence among patients with FOU. Methods and Results: During period 1995-2010, 2642 with FUO were evaluated and treated in the Clinic for infectious and tropical diseases, Belgrade. Extrapulmonary TB were diagnosed in 128 (4,8%) patients. Genitourinary TB in 67 patients (renal \u2212 57, orhiepididymitis \u2212 3, salpingo-oophoritis \u2212 7); TB lymphadenitis in 11, meningitis in 15, TB pericarditis in 8, spondylodiscitis in 6, liver TB in 4, in 2 patients cerebral tuberculoma and in one patient small intestine TB. In 14 patients we did not confirm tuberculosis and after pulmonary TB was excluded, they were treated empirically with antituberculous drags, and had a good response. As a diagnostic methods we used: PPD skin test, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), sputum and urine cultivation, computed tomography, echocardiography, intravenous pyelography, patohistological examination of lymph nodes, intestine and liver, and gynecological laparoscopy. For urine and CSF specimens PCR test was used after year 2001. The sensitivity of conformation test were: CSF culture 100% (PCR 100%), urine culture 45% (PCR 68%), for histopathology lymph nodes 78%, small intestine 100% (single patient) and liver 85%. Cerebral tuberculomas was confirmed by magnetic resonance spectroscopy and reduction of lesion dimensions during antituberculous therapy. As a diagnostic criteria, clinical course of the illness, radiological examination, laparoscopy and other endoscope examinations and response to empiric therapy, were also used. Incidence of extrapulmonary TB was in slight increasing after year 2001. Isoniazid, rifampin, pyrazinamide, ethambutol and streptomycin were used for treatment. Multi drug resistant TB were confirmed in 4 patients and in 7 patients (drug sensitive TB) had relapses of the illness after treatment. Conclusions: Extrapulmonary TB is increasing cause factor in patients with FOU and should be always considered during evaluations of this patients.R2686 CD4+ T-lymphopenia inHIV-negative tuberculous patients at the King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia A.

Cornely (Cologne, DE)    Introduction: Prior reports have suggested a possible association between invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) and influenza infection in otherwise healthy patients. In patients receiving anti-neoplastic chemotherapy, however, the impact of influenza on the incidence of IPA remains unknown. Methods: We used data from the Cologne Cohort of Neutropenic Patients to analyse the impact of the influenza A (H1N1) 2009 pandemic on the incidence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis among cancer patients. We then compared our findings to historical data. Results: During the pandemic we diagnosed influenza A (H1N1) by PCR in five patients with malignancies and febrile neutropenia refractory to antibiotic therapy. Probable invasive pulmonary aspergillosis was diagnosed in three of these patients on grounds of typical CT morphology and microbiologic results. During the pandemic, three of five patients receiving AML induction chemotherapy developed aspergillosis although receiving posaconazole prophylaxis. In the three years before the influenza pandemic, only 2/77 patients of this group developed IPA (RR 23.1; 95% CI: 4.93-108.16). Discussion: Our findings indicate that infection with influenza A (H1N1) may increase the risk for invasive aspergillosis in neutropenic patients. During pandemic and seasonal influenza, persistently febrile neutropenic Infection in the immunocompromised host and transplant recipients S811 patients should continue to receive standard diagnostic work-up, even if diagnosis of influenza has been made. Pulmonary aspergillosis is an important additional differential diagnosis in neutropenic influenza patients with pneumonia.R2693 Common pathogens isolated from diabetic foot infections in a university hospital, HungaryE. Urb\u00e1n*, G. Terhes, E. Nagy on behalf of ESGARAB Objectives: Foot infections are the most common problems in persons with diabetes. These individuals are predisposed to foot infections because of a compromised vascular supply secondary to diabetes. Local trauma and/or pressure (often in association with lack of sensation because of neuropathy), in addition to microvascular disease, may result in various diabetic foot infections. Infectious agents are associated with the worst outcomes, which may ultimately lead to amputation of the infected foot, unless prompt treatment strategies are ensued. The present study sought to reveal bacterial etiology of diabetic foot ulcers in diabetic patients of our region. Methods: A retrospective review of clinical and microbiological data of 139 diabetic patients suffered from moderate-to-severe diabetic foot infections (DFIs), including out-and inpatients in the special wards of our University was carried out over a 5-year period. After debridement, investigators collected wound specimens, mostly by curettage or biopsy, and sent them to the Hungarian Anaerobic Reference Laboratory for aerobic and anaerobic culture.Results: All of the samples were culture positive, only anaerobic bacteria were present in 34 samples (24.5%). Among the cultures, 97% were polymicrobial, 2 grew only one microorganism: C. perfringens and C. septicum in pure culture, 43.7% had both aerobes and anaerobes. A total of 832 bacterial strains were isolated, resulting in an average of 5.98 organisms (range 1 to 21) per lesion: 619 anaerobic-, and 209 aerobic-or facultative bacteria and 4 yeasts were isolated. The predominant aerobic organisms were oxacillin-susceptible S. aureus (31.7%), b-haemolytic (mostly group B) Streptococcus species (12.2%), Enterococcus species (16.7%), members of the family Enterobacteriaceae: E. coli, Proteus, Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Serratia, Citrobacter (52.3%), and P. aeruginosa (15.8%). The predominant anaerobes were Gram-positive cocci: 103 isolates, Prevotella species: 198 isolates, Clostridium species: 50 isolates, and the members of the Bacteroides fragilis group: 41 isolates. Conclusion: Clinical grading and bacteriological study of 139 patients with diabetic foot lesions revealed polymicrobial aetiology.Our findings showed that the density of growth of anaerobes and the number of the isolated anaerobic species were significantly higher than that in previous studies, due to good anaerobe laboratory practice and the adequate sampling.R2694 Clinical and laboratory investigation of KPC-2Klebsiella pneumoniae bacteraemia in patients of a haematology ward M.

However, there are only a few reports specifically addressing PBSIs. The aim of the present study was to compare epidemiological features and mortality attributable to PBSIs with those attributable to monomicrobial bloodstream infections (MBSIs) in patients with malignancy. Methods: A retrospective matched case-control study, with 1:1 ratio was performed. All patients with malignancy, hospitalized with bloodstream infection in the departments of Haematology and Medical Oncology, from 2005 to 2010, were reviewed. Each patient with PBSI was matched to another with MBSI by age, sex and type of malignancy. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Results: A total of 114 episodes of BSI among 110 patients were identified. Of those, 34 patients (31%) had a PBSI. Gram-negative organisms were predominant in 85% of the episodes, while Grampositive in 53% of the PBSIs. Grade 4 neutropenia was present in 6 patients with PBSI and 5 with MBSI.

Fang (Taipei, TW) Objective: The annual case number of persons who are newly diagnosed with HIV infection continues to increase in Taiwan after successful control of HIV outbreak among injecting drug users that took place between 2003 and 2007 . Whether the increasing case number is related to increased awareness and HIV testing activities or increasing incidence in high-risk populations, such as men who have sex with men (MSM), remains to be investigated. In this study, we aimed to compare 3 methods to estimate the incidence rate of HIV infection among persons seeking voluntary, anonymous counseling and testing services (VCT) at a university hospital. Methods: Between 1 May, 2006 and 30 September, 2010, 9410 persons were tested anonymously for HIV antibodies at the National Taiwan University Hospital. Demographics and behavioral data were obtained at the time of the counseling. Three methods were used to estimate HIV incidence: first, based on self-reported dates of prior tests; second, based on linking prior records with an unique testing code; and third, based on the Serologic Testing Algorithm for Recent HIV Seroconversion (STARHS). Results: During the 4-year study period, 311 individuals (3.50%) were diagnosed as HIV-positive. Comparable overall seroconversion rate was found by the three methods, 5.19, 4.64, and 3.88 per 100 person-years [PY] , respectively. The incidence rate of HIV infection in MSM by the three methods was 7.44, 6.91, and 6.22 per 100 PY, respectively, which was significantly higher than that in heterosexuals (0.70, 0, and 0.89 per 100 PY, respectively). Greatest variability was observed among the 3 methods in the estimation of the HIV incidence rate in non-MSM injecting drug users (31.58, 0, and 25.95 per 100 PY, respectively). An increasing trend of overall HIV incidence rate was observed from 2007 (3.99, 4.11, and 2.34 per 100 PY) to 2009 (7.60, 5.51, and 3.79 per 100 PY) by the three respective methods.",

Disease progression was defined as fall in CD4 count below 350/microliter and/or initiation of antiretroviral therapy. Results: Comparison revealed analogous findings for the frequency of tick bite, incubation, duration of EM prior to diagnosis and its largest diameter, proportion of patients with multiple EM, seropositivity, as well as for Borrelia skin and blood culture results. Systemic symptoms were more common in patients with RD (51% versus 25%, p = 0.0014); the most prominent difference was found for headache (36% versus 8%, p < 0.0001). In 2/59 (3.4%) patients with RD but in none of the control group (p = 0.1098) objective extracutaneous manifestations of Lyme borreliosis (monoarthritis, meningoradiculitis) were found at presentation. Duration of EM after the beginning of antibiotic treatment was comparable. Four (6.8%) patients with RD, and one (0.8%) in the control group (p = 0.0429) were re-treated within 3 months due to pronounced subjective symptoms (two patients) or persistence of EM (two patients with and one patient without underlying RD). Nonetheless, the clinical course was smooth and comparable in both groups. Conclusions: Higher proportion of systemic symptoms and a tendency for more common presence of objective extracutaneous manifestations of Lyme borreliosis before antibiotic treatment as well as more often need for re-treatment indicate that early Lyme borreliosis has a more severe course in patients with RD than in immunocompetent persons. However, the outcome one year after treatment with antibiotics as used for immunocompetent individuals is excellent.",

Hu (Chengdu, Wuhan, Beijing, Kunming, Guilin, Luzhou, Chongqing, Changsha, CN) Objective: This study aimed to compare the efficacy and safety of injectable biapenem and meropenem in the treatment of bacterial lower respiratory and urinary tract infections. Method: A randomized, single-blind, controlled clinical trial was performed in 9 medical centers from January 2009 to March 2010 in mainland of China. In this phase 2 study, patients were randomly (1:1) assigned to receive IV biapenem or meropenem for 2 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoints were clinical response at the test-of-cure visit (7 days after therapy) for the intent-to-treat (ITT). Differences in clinical efficacy, bacteriology and safety between the two groups were subjected to statistical analysis, including ITT analysis. Results: A total of 272 cases received 1 dose of study drug were enrolled and comprised the ITT population. with 241 per-protocol set (PPS) cases (121 biapenem, 120 meropenem). A total of 272 cases (136 biapenem, 136 meropenem) were included in the safety set (SS) analysis.Overall efficacy rates of biapenem and meropenme were 94.70% and 93.94%, respectively. Overall bacterial eradication rates of the two groups were 96.39% and 93.83%, respectively. Among the biapenem group, 16 patients (11.76%) had probable drug-related adverse events. Among the meropenem group, 21 patients (15.44%) had probable drugrelated adverse events. The major ones were gastro-intestinal symptoms and rash, the elevations of AST or/and ALT and decrease of white blood cells. All differences between the two groups were insignificant. From the above-mentioned results of clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy, and safety, injectable biapenem was confirmed to be useful in the treatment of moderate, severe and/or refractory infections in lower respiratory and urinary tract infections caused by b-lactamase-producing (including ESBL) bacterial isolates.R2722 Microbiological analysis of a prospective, randomised, double-blind trial comparing moxifloxacin and clindamycin in the treatment of infiltrates and abscesses I.

Cachovan (Geesthacht, Hamburg, Rotenburg, Berlin, DE) Objectives: Aim of the study was the analysis of oral pathogens in odontogenic abscesses and gingival infiltrates and their susceptibility to moxifloxacin (MXF), levofloxacin (LVX), penicillin (PEN), amoxicillin/ clavulanic acid (AMX/CLA), doxycycline (DOX), and clindamycin (CLI). Patients and Methods: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, multicenter, phase II trial compared the efficacy and tolerability of MXF and CLI in the treatment of odontogenic abscesses and inflammatory infiltrates. The analysis of microbial parameters presented here were part of the secondary endpoints. 71 patients with either infiltrates or abscesses were enrolled into this study. Clinical results: MXF was significantly more effective at mean pain reducing in patients with inflammatory infiltrates on day 2\u22123, compared to CLI (61.0% vs. 23.4%, p = 0.006). Global efficacy assessment at days 2\u22123 and 5\u22127 showed faster clinical responses with moxifloxacin in both abscess and infiltrate patients. Microbiological results: 205 bacteria were isolated from 71 patients (viridans streptococci 77x, Prevotella spp. 56x, Neisseria spp. 19x, Streptococcus (S.) anginosus group and hemolytic streptococci 17x, other anaerobes 15x, and other bacteria 21x). 98% of pathogens were susceptible to MXF followed by AMX/CLA (96%), LVX (85%), PEN (67%), CLI (60%), and DOX (50%). S. anginosus group and hemolytic streptococci were detected significantly more frequent (p = 0.04) in patients with abscesses (12/95) compared to patients with infiltrates (5/110). Only eight patients with odontogenic infections did not recover following surgical intervention and primary antibiotic therapy. Bacteria isolated from patients with therapy failure and resistant against the antibiotic given are analysed. From the abscess group a wide range of bacteria were isolated including various kind of streptococci, E. faecalis, Neisseria spp., and anaerobes. In contrast, from the infiltrate group viridans streptococci (3x) and Neisseria spp. (3x) were isolated only. Conclusions: In this study MXF showed a promising in vitro and in vivo activity against odontogenic bacteria compared to CLI that justify its use for treatment of odontogenic abscesses and infiltrates. Our analyses clearly indicate that S. anginosus group and hemolytic streptococci are associated with odontogenic abscesses and that viridans streptococci and Neisseria spp. are involved in the pathogenesis of odontogenic infiltrates.",

            "text": "Objective: Tigecycline (TGC) has demonstrated clinical efficacy and safety in both complicated intra-abdominal infection (cIAI) and complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI). Because cSSSI due to prior surgery is common, TGC is a potential option for surgeons and infectious diseases physicians who treat these infections. A pooled analysis of phase 3\u22124 clinical trial subjects with cSSSI due to a surgical infection was conducted. Objective: We investigated the impact of linezolid (LZD) or vancomycin (VAN) administration on the fecal flora of subjects enrolled in a doubleblind randomized controlled clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of LZD and VAN for the treatment of nosocomial pneumonia (NP) caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). All patients received concomitant antibiotics with coverage for Gram negative bacilli (GNB). Methods: Rectal swabs were obtained at baseline, at Day 6 (\u00b1 2 days) and at End of Treatment (EOT). Quantitative cultures and susceptibility testing of aerobic GNB were performed to detect the emergence of resistance of Enterobacteriaceae to ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefepime, or piperacillin/tazobactam and for R of non-nonfermentative GNB (NFs) to imipenem, aztreonam or ciprofloxacin. Changes in log10 number colony forming units (cfu) for Day 6 and EOT were compared to baseline. Results: 130 swabs were received from 69 subjects. Baseline, Day 6, and EOT samples were available for 25 subjects, 9 in the LZD and 16 in the VAN treatment arm. From baseline to Day 6, the median log cfu/g of Enterobacteriaceae decreased from 10 6 to <10 2 cfu/g in LZD-treated subjects. In VAN-treated subjects, a 2 log reduction occurred between baseline and Day 6. At baseline, the proportion of aerobic GNB resistant to at least 1 of the specified antibiotics for each organism group was 18% and 14% in the LZD and VAN treatment groups, respectively. At Day 6 and EOT, the proportion of resistant GNB increased to 50% and 41% in the LZD group compared to 17% and 22% in the VAN group. In the LZD arm, the average number days of GN therapy (DOT) per subject during the pre-study period was 5.8 compared to 3.5 for subjects in the VAN arm. The average number of DOT per subject for concomitant antibiotics during the study period was 5 and 5.2 for LZD and VAN treatment arms, respectively. Conclusion: In this small study, the emergence of resistance among GNB and changes in cfu/g during therapy was greater in the LZD arm compared to VAN. The administration of GN active agents prior to the study period, which was more common in LZD subjects, was likely to have contributed to the noted changes in fecal flora. Objectives: The prevalence of adult obesity exceeds 30% and 20% in adults in the USA and several European countries, respectively. Patient body weight may need to be taken into consideration for the optimization of drug therapy. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of body weight on outcomes by treatment regimen for nosocomial pneumonia (NP) due to culture proven methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Methods: Data from a prospective, double-blind, randomized clinical trial were analyzed to examine body weight-related differences in the efficacy and safety of linezolid (LZD) 600 mg IV Q12h and vancomycin (VAN) 15 mg/kg IV Q12h (adjusted for renal function) for up to 14 days. We stratified the study population into 4 weight quartiles (Q1-Q4) (Figure) . Clinical success was evaluated by weight quartiles and treatment group at end of study (EOS = 7\u221230 days after last treatment dose). We also analyzed rates of adverse events (AEs) by weight quartiles and treatment. Results: There were 447 patients treated with at least one dose of study drug for MRSA NP (224 treated with LZD and 223 with VAN). The treatment duration for all quartiles by treatment was approximately 10 days. The average maximum VAN trough was lowest in Q1 (16.2 mgml), compared to Q2 (18.3 mgml), Q3 (18.4 mgml) and Q4 (18.9 mgml). The number of patients with AEs were similar regardless of treatment regimen and were numerically higher in Q1 (92%) and Q2 (92%) compared to Q3 (88%) and Q4 (85%). The rates of anemia were highest in Q1 (16%; LNZ = 14% vs. VAN = 17%) compared to Q2 (6%; LNZ = 6% vs. VAN = 5%), Q3 (11%; LNZ = 12% vs. VAN = 9%) and Q4 (9%; LNZ = 7% vs. VAN = 11%). There were no differences in the rates of thrombocytopenia among the quartiles; Q1 (6%; LNZ = 5% vs. VAN = 7%), Q2 (4%; LNZ = 4% vs. VAN = 4%), Q3 (1%; LNZ = 0% vs. VAN = 2%), Q4 (0).",

Objectives: Iron deficiency, defined as decreased total body iron content, is among the most common nutritional deficiencies in the world. IDA is a condition with important health consequences regarding reproduction, immunity, work performance, and possibly cognitive development, Emerging evidence seems to place H. pylori infection next to helminthiasis as a communicable cause of anemia. We investigated whether there was any correlation between H. pylori infection and iron deficiency and IDA in children in Iran. Methods: In a case-control survey, 64 patients with IDA between 3 and 8 years (median 4.5 years) were enrolled in the study and 70 matched children as control group. Serum hemoglobin, total iron-binding capacity, ferritin, erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume (MCV), fecal occult blood testing, and stool for ova and immunoglobulin G antibody to H. pylori mechanical ventilation and phototherapy were used. On day 8, the neonate had bradycardia and episodes of apnea with increased leycocytes and CRP. Blood culture and CSF examination were performed. Results: In first case, CSF glucose remained very low, protein level was high with 478 cells/mm3, and lymphocyte predominance, indicating chronic meningitis. Blood and urine cultures were sterile. On day 40, LP showed similar findings with the above results, but this time CSF culture was positive for Candida albicans, which was sensitive in all antifungal agents, according to RPMI method. Antifungal therapy was given for four weeks. At the end of therapy LP were normal. The neonate remained clinically well throughout therapy. In second case, the first LP and CSF culture were negative. On day 35, LP repeated cause the neonate was still unwell. CSF glucose was normal, protein level was high and leycocytes was 30/mm3 (47% PMNs). Blood and CSF culture were positive for Candida albicans, which were resistant in fluconazole. Appropriate antifungal therapy was given and the neonate recovered. Conclusion: Candida albicans isolates in CSF are very uncommon, especially in premature neonates. As in described cases, the low fungal load has been previously associated with false-negative results during the first days of Candida albicans infections. The clinical and microbiological findings should help in diagnosis and in antifungal treatment selection.",

To assess the prevalence and the distribution of S. epidermidis (S.e) and S. lugdunensis (S.l) in severe diseases such as bloodstream infections (BSI) or skin and soft tissue infections, in a pediatric hospital. 2. To investigate S.e and S.l antimicrobial resistance patterns. Material and Methods: A total of 268 coagulase negative Staphylococci (CoNS) isolated from 356 positive blood and 805 wound cultures from hospitalized children, median age 5 years during a four year period (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) were tested. Identification at the species level and susceptibility profiles was performed by using the Vitek II system and E-test. All CoNS strains were investigated for the presence of biofilm formation (slime test tube adherence). Results: Out of 19,2% (69/356) bloodstream related CoNS, the species distribution was: S.e (39.13%), S. hominis (20.29%), S. haemolyticus (17.40%), S. warneri (17.39%) and finally S. capitis and S. auricularis were found in 2.90% each one. The predominant species in 25% CoNSwound associated isolates was S.e (61%), followed by S. warneri 7,53%, S. hominis 7.22%, S. capitis 6,8%, S. l 6.2% and the remaining 10.89% CoNS strains included a variety of species. The observed prevalence of methicillin resistance (MR) among S.e strains in BSI was 68% versus 28% in wound infections (WI). A significant proportion of MR was found among S. hominis (60%) and S. warneri (50%) in BSI. Notable rate of resistance (5% and 16%) was detected to teicoplanin ( 32mg/l) in S.e and S. hominis sepsis related strains isolates respectively. MR CoNS also showed multidrug resistance to antibiotics: erythromycin 65%, clindamycin 60%, tobramycin 20%, fucidic acid 35%, tetracycline 20% and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim 15%. In contradiction, all S.l as well as S. haemolyticus, S. capitis and S. intermedius wound-associated isolates were found methicillin susceptible. Biofilm formation in 25 S.e orthopedic wound-strains was also associated with multidrug resistance. Conclusions: 1. S.e was the leading cause of BSI and WI and was related with multiple resistance patterns and indwelling medical devices. 2. S. l, a virulent pathogen agent, was associated with severe WI. 3. Our results strongly suggest the need for the establishment of control program measures in order to prevent and reduce the level of resistance of S.e to methicillin. A recent concern is the upwards shift in glycopeptides MIC for S.e strains.",

Method: Eighty (80) Patients with compatible symptoms and signs and positive blood culture for Brucellosis and forty-three normal controls were prospectively studied at the King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Determination of phagocytic function were done by chemiluminesence assay of the oxidative burst, opsonized yeast uptake and turbidimetric measurement of antibody dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) for whole blood, polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs)and isolated monocytes. Patients with brucellosis were divided into three categories namely: non-complicated, complicated and post treated patients. Results: Luminol-enhanced chemiluminesence assay of the oxidative burst for PMNs was significantly increase in all patients infected with Brucella melitensis as compared to the control group with time to peak in minutes of non-complicated versus control of 5.82\u00b10.03 vs 6.88 \u00b10.27 (p < 0.05). Specifically, the PMNs of patients in the noncomplicated group were more active than those with complication. It has been suggested that PMNs depression may contribute to the chronicity of Brucella in some individuals. The pattern of whole blood chemiluminesence was found to closely parallel that of the PMNs. The monocyte response of infected patients, however did not always show a significant increase in their function as the time to peak in minutes for control, non-complicated, complicated and post treatment were as follows: 9\u00b10.34, 8\u00b10.45, 7\u00b10.50 and 8\u00b10.50 respectively. The oxidative burst of monocytes of patients was significantly reduced perhaps due to long term survival of Brucella within the monocyte. The result demonstrated recovery of activity after treatment indicating temporary and infection-related process. Yeast uptake was significantly reduced in all groups of patients. Measurement of ADCC showed a significant decreased in cellular cytotoxicity as measured by a decrease in target cell elimination for all patients; non-complicated vs control 47.18\u00b13.9 vs 55.77\u00b12.55 (p < 0.01); complicated vs control 45.32\u00b13.6 vs 55.77\u00b12.55 (p < 0.05) and post treatment vs control 40.95\u00b12.5 vs 55.77\u00b12.55 (p < 0.05) compared to the control. Conclusion: The PMNs and monocyte oxidation burst reaction is dependent on the patients' status. Target cell elimination and yeast uptake however was significantly reduced and did not depend on the patients' status.R2749 Oral intake of heat-killed Lactobacillus pentosus strain b240 accelerates salivary immunoglobulin a secretion in the elderly: a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial Y. Kotani*, S. Shinkai, H. Okamatsu, M. Toba, K. Ogawa, H. Yoshida, T. Fukaya, Y. Fujiwara, K. Kakumoto, N. Kohda (Otsu, Tokyo, Tokushima, JP) Objectives: Secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) in saliva has been widely used as an indicator of mucosal immunity. A lack of non-specific secretory IgA at the mucosal surfaces can lead to an increased risk of infection. Salivary IgA (SIgA) secretion decreases with age, and may lead to an increased risk of respiratory infections because the salivary glands are the most important source of secretory IgA in the upper respiratory tract. The objective of this study was to demonstrate the acceleration of SIgA secretion by oral intake of Lactobacillus pentosus ONRICb0240 (b240) in the elderly. Methods: A total of 80 healthy elderly individuals were randomly allocated to either an intervention or control group. The elderly individuals in the intervention group were given a water beverage containing heat-killed b240 (4\u00d710 9 cells), while those in the control group were given only a water beverage; both groups received their respective beverages once daily for 12 weeks. Saliva was collected before initiation of the study and every 2 weeks thereafter. Saliva flow rate and SIgA concentration were determined, and the SIgA secretion rate was calculated.Results: Changes in SIgA secretion rate over the intervention period were significantly greater in the intervention group than the control group and the mean SIgA secretion rate in the intervention group steadily increased until week 4 (exhibiting a 20% elevation relative to that at week 0), and then remained stable until week 12. Conclusion: Oral intake of Lactobacillus pentosus ONRICb0240 for 12 weeks significantly accelerated SIgA secretion, thereby indicating its potential in the improvement of mucosal immunity and resistance against respiratory tract infections in the elderly.R2750 Cytokine response in patients treated with S. aureus autovaccine A. Szkaradkiewicz*, S. Giedrys-Kalemba, T. Tulecka, T.M. Karpinski, A. Zeidler (Poznan, Szczecin, PL) Objectives: Chronic infection with S. aureus creates a serious therapeutic and epidemiological problem. In treatment of chronic staphylococcal infections autovaccines are used, prepared from killed S. aureus strains, isolated from the patient. The study aimed at evaluation of serum levels of IL-1b, TNF-a and IFN-g in patients with chronic S. aureus infections, treated with autovaccine. Methods: The studies were conducted on two groups of patients. Group l consisted of 20 healthy individuals of 18 to 38 years of age, asymptomatic carriers, in whom nasal smears disclosed presence of S. aureus. Group 2 included 16 patients, 17 to 39 years of age, with chronic upper respiratory tract infections induced by S. aureus. Strains of S. aureus were isolated from throat smears and identified using ID 32 STAPH tests (bioMerieux). In all patients of group 2 treatment with autovaccine (containing 1.5\u00d710 8 killed bacteria/ml) was applied, prepared from S. aureus strains isolated from the patients. Serum IL-1b and TNF-a cytokine levels were estimated using high sensitivity ELISA tests (R&D), while levels of IFN-g were quantitated using high sensitivity ELISA test (eBioscience). Estimations of serum cytokine levels were conducted twice: before application of the autovaccine and 24\u221272 hours following a series of 20 subcutaneous injections (thrice a week) of the autovaccine.comparing that of saline treated mice and the IgA production of murine Peyer's patch cells against stimulation of b240 was facilitated. Conclusion: Lactobacillus pentosus ONRICb0240 would be an useful LAB strain for promoting IgA production. Efficacy of b240 ingestion to the other mucosal immune system is expected. In this study, gene polymorphisms in saCOL2291 and saCOL2581 were evaluated. Genomic DNA was extracted from thirty clinical S. aureus isolates and the genes were PCR-amplified. The amplicons were sequenced, aligned with Puls4 software and compared with saCOL2291 and saCOL2581. Results: Nucleotide polymorphisms were detected that resulted in amino acid sequence changes, but these polymorphisms were located in the N-terminal domains while the C-terminal domains of these genes were conserved. Conclusion: Despite the identification of polymorphisms in these genes, both encode candidate proteins for potential use in a universal staphylococcal vaccine. This is the first study for assessing variation in the saCOL2291 and saCOL2581 genes.",

Rotavirus is non-enveloped virus with genome, represented by 11 segments of RNA, which makes these viruses extremely volatile, especially due to reassortment of genes during co-infection. Detection of specific sequences of genes, encoding protective proteins VP4 and VP7 of outer capsid of rotaviruses (G/P-genotyping), using PCR, has become the modern tool in the study of rotaviruses. Nowadays it is particularly relevant in the context of the implementation of vaccination programs aginst rotavirus infection in children. , as a tool of specific prevention, will be most effective in the territory of Ukraine.",

Jungersen (Copenhagen, DK) Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP), the agent of Johne's disease, causes systemic infection and chronic intestinal inflammation in many animal species. Neonates are more susceptible to the infection due to high degree of exposure from their dams and possibly less developed immune system. The only vaccines available against MAP comprised attenuated or killed organisms. However, none of these vaccines are able to completely prevent infection or shedding of bacteria. Considering the fact that MAP infection occurs at a young age and the animal remains in the subclinical phase for 2\u22123 years, an effective vaccine should not only elicit strong immune response in young animals, but also a quality of the T-cell response that correlates with long term protection. Here we report the effect of age at immunization and quality of immune response following immunization of calves with recombinant MAP proteins formulated with DDA/TDB (CAF01) adjuvant. Vaccine comprised of one heat shock protein, two ESAT-6 family members and two secreted mycobacterial components fused with CAF01 adjuvant.

Moreover, mice immunized with rBCG:GCE generated the strongest antigen specific antibody responses compared to other groups. Objective: Pneumococcal infection is a potentially life-threatening condition, which can also cause lifelong sequelae such as neurologic deficits. Since 2003, vaccination with a pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine has been recommended in the UK for those aged 65 years and over, in addition to those in a clinically at-risk group over two years of age (in place since 1992). A pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was introduced into the childhood vaccination scheme in 2006. Although many studies have estimated invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) incidence among various population subgroups, including adults, a synthesis of estimates has not been performed. The objective here was to estimate age-specific incidence and case fatality rates of IPD among adults in the UK. Methods: A systematic review was conducted in MEDLINE and EMBASE in August 2010. Two independent reviewers extracted data from articles describing adult pneumococcal disease incidence and mortality in the UK, published from the year 2000 to present. Data were synthesized according to clinically relevant age categories for adult pneumococcal infection and stratified according to type of pneumococcal disease (IPD overall, or its subgroups of bacteraemia/septicaemia or meningitis). These data were supplemented with hand-searching of reference lists. Results: The search strategy identified 2,444 abstracts for screening; 20 satisfied the inclusion criteria, and presented estimates from 1980 to 2005. Age-specific estimates of the incidence of IPD and its subgroups are provided in the table. Overall, incidence of IPD and its subgroups increased with age. For IPD, incidence rates ranged from 2.7 to 10 cases per 100,000 among those <65, to 18.8 to 70 cases per 100,000 among those >65 years of age. Overall case fatality due to IPD and its subgroups also generally increased with age. Four studies reported overall IPD case Objective: The development of an efficacious vaccine for brucellosis has been a challenge for scientists for many years. Our previous studies demonstrated that LPS+OMV conjugates was elicited high level of anti-LPS IgG titers. In this study, the efficiency of LPS-OMV conjugates to promote IFN-g and IL-4 evaluated to determine the pattern of T-helper population activation. Method: B. abortus LPS was extracted and used for their conjugation to N. meningitidis serogroup B outer membrane vesicle as carrier protein as discribed previously. Groups of ten BABL/c mice were injected subcutaneously with 10 mg of LPS alone, combine and conjugated on 0, 14 and 28 days. Sera were taken before and 14 days after each injection. Levels of IFN-g, IL-4 and IL-10 in the sera of immunized animals assayed by ELISA. Results: Immunization with B. abortus LPS significantly induced high level of IFN-g in comparison to the other groups immunized with LPS-OMV conjugate and LPS+adjuvant (P < 0.05. In contrast, lower levels of IL-4 and IL-10 were elicited by LPS in all of the immunized animal models. Although Immunization with B. abortus LPS-N. meningitidis serogroup B OMV conjugate demonstrated significant increase of IL-4 and IL-10 in comparison with the immunization with B. abortus LPS (P < 0.05, the titer of IFN-g is still significantly higher than IL-4 and IL-10 in the sera of this group's animal models (P < 0.05). Conclusion: The raise of IFN-g production following the immunization with all of the compounds (LPS, LPS-OMV conjugate and LPS+adjuvant) indicates the induction of Th1-type response that would be correlated to the clearance of the organism due to the proliferative response of Polymorphonuclear cells. Low levels of IL-4 and IL-10 following the immunization with all compounds would be a sign of Th1 responses dominancy or inhibition of Th2-type response proliferation and activity. Since Th1-type response would be indicated the efficiency of this brucellosis conjugate vaccine, Th2 responses basically have no role in the immune responses against brucellosis and may lead to the S834 21st ECCMID/27th ICC, Abstracts accepted for publication only persistence of intracellular infection. These results indicate that the conjugated LPS obtained by us, can be used as a brucellosis vaccine after further investigation.Internet and electronic resources R2767 Improving empirical antibiotic therapy in orthopaedicrelated infections using ViResiST, a computerised decision support system J.M.
