            "text": "Using immunohistochemical techniques, we examined major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen expression on astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and macrophages-microglia derived from surgically resected tissue from young adults and maintained in dissociated cell cultures supplemented with either fetal calf or human AB serum. The majority of these cells in culture expressed class I MHC antigens. MHC class II expression was observed on only a restricted proportion of astrocytes either under basal or induction conditions (,/-interferon, activated lymphocyte supernatants), on the majority of macrophagesmicroglia under inducing conditions, and not on oligodendrocytes. MHC class II expression on astrocytes in culture did not correlate with the extent of in situ gliosis or with in vitro cell morphology. MHC antigen expression was not detected in situ immunohistochemically. These data extend observations on the dissociation of in vivo and in vitro expression of MHC antigens on glial cells. The apparent greater expression of MHC class II antigens on macrophages-microgha compared to astrocytes raises the issue of the relative roles of each of these cell types in promoting immune reactivity under pathologic conditions. mechanisms contribute to lesion formation in some chronic demyelinating diseases of the CNS induced by viral infection in animals, and are postulated to participate in the pathogenesis of the human chronic demyelinating disease, multiple sclerosis (MS). The above pathologic conditions are characterized by accumulation of lymphocytes, macrophages-microglia, and reactive astrocytes in the region of demyelination. The contribution of each of the cell types present in the region of these lesions to promoting ongoing immune reactivg~y remains under active study.",

            "text": "The central nervous system (CNS), although often referred to as an immunologically privileged site, can be the target of immune-mediated tissue injury. Systemic immune sensitization with myelin antigens in humans can result in the uniphasic disorder, acute disseminated encephalomyelitis; in animals, one can induce either an acute or chronic relapsing form of experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE). Cellular immune-mediated specific cell-mediated immune effector responses within the CNS, relates to the capacity of these ce~s to express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens. MHC antigen expression, either class I or If, is usually undetectable within the CNS under non-pathologic conditions, using in situ immanohistochemical techniques. De Tribolet et al. (1984) did observe MHC class II-positive cells, some of which were tentatively identified as astrocytes, in apparently normal brain tissue. Lampson and Hickey (1986) , in an in situ study of adult human brain tissue which surrounded tumor infiltrates, did not detect either class I or class II MHC antigen-positive astrocytes even among those histologically considered reactive. In active MS lesions, class I, and possibly class II, MHC an0.gens are reported to be present on astrocytes as well as on endothelial cells and macrophages present within the active lesions (Trangott et al., 1985; Hanser et al., 1986; Hofman et al., 1986) . In EAE, several groups have detected class I but not class II MHC antigens on astrocytes in situ (Lassman et al., 1986; Sakai et al., 1986) , whereas endothelial cells and macrophages expressed both classes. In the Theiler' murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) model, both MHC antigen classes are detected on astrocytes, endothelial cells and macrophages, and seemingly also on a small proportion of oligodendrocytes (OC~s) (Rodriguez et al., 1987) . MHC antigen expression by astrocytes, OGCs and macrophages-microgfia has been studied in vitro, largely using fetal or newborn neural tissue (Wont et al., 1985; Fontana et al., 1987) . Under basal culture conditions, expression of class I MHC antigens on fetal murine astrocytes is undetectable or low by immunohistochemical criteria, although recognition of these cells by class l-restricted cytotoxic T cells may be a more sensitive means of assay (Skias et al., 1987) ; class II MHC antigen expression is usually non-detectable. Gamma-interferon, a potent inducer of MHC antigens on non-neural cells, and stimulated lymphocyte supematants, markedly augment both class I (H-2) and II MHC expression on these cells. Massa et al. (1987) found a hyperinducibility of class II MHC antigens on astrocytes but not peritoneal m_acrophages of newborn rats from strains susceptible to EAE. Human fetal astro-cytes maintained in culture are variably reported to spontaneously express DR antigens but can be induced to express them with y-interferon (Pulver et al., 1987) . Fetal routine oli8odendrocytes do not express immunohistochemically detectable MHC antigens under basal conditions; class I, but not class II, MHC expression can be indueezl with y-interferon, activated lymphocyte supernatants, and by viral infection (Wong et al., 1984; Suzumura et al., 1986; Takiguchi and Frelinger, 1986) . Takiguchi and Frelinger (1986) demonstrated that, unlike astrocytes, OGCs cannot present exogenous antigen to T-cell hybrids, a capacity dependent on class II MHC antigen expression. Macrophages-microgiia isolated from newborn mouse brain express class I MHC antigens under basal culture conditions, and both class I and II MHC antigens after exposure to y-interferon (Frei et al., 1987; Suzumura et al., 1987) .",

Kim et al. (1985) , using autopsy material of individuals of widely variable age (27-93 years), found that in tissue cultures which utilized minimum essential medium (MEM) and 5~ fetal calf serum (FCS), 9-24~ of gfial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)positive cells expressed DR (MHC class II) antigens; 0-16% of GalC-positive cells also expressed these antigens with cultures from 50% of donors being negative. All fibronectin-positive cells (fibroblasts) were HLA DR-negative. Lisak et al. (1983) did not detect DR antigens on human or rat OC~s. Hirayama et al. (1986) , using autopsy material from apparently a single donor, found in cultures containing FCS that neither astrocytes nor OGCs expressed class II MHC antigens whereas 7~ of OC~s, but none of the GFAPpositive cells expressed class I MHC antigens. Following addition of y-interferon (1-20 /~l per ml for 28-44 h), 80-98% of astrocytes and OGCs expressed class I MHC antigens; > 50% of astrocytes but none of the O(3Cs expressed MHC class II antigens. Induction was blocked by actinomycin-D and cycloheximide, indicating that synthesis of new mRNA and protein was needed for MHC antigen induction. Barna et al. (1987) reported in a culture of GFAP + cells established from surgically derived human tissue that DR expression could be observed on 33~ of cells after addition of ~,-interferon or lymphokine-containing medium, although not on untreated cells. These data do suggest that MHC expression variably occurs on ghal cells, but that conditions determining expression or non-expression require further defmition.",

The level of MHC class II antigen expression was qualitatively greater on macrophages-microglia than on astrocytes under bas21 and \"~,-interferon \"nduction conditions (Fig. 8) .",

As well demonstrated by Hickey and Kumura (1988) , the brain macrophages are blood-derived cells. As mentioned, the macrophage population in our material appeared to be the one most clearly expressing MHC class II antigens under 'basal' conditions, and being the most responsive to '/-interferon. Belier et al. (1984) have shown accessory cell capacity to be proportional to the amount of Ia antigen induced on the cell surface. These observations are of potential importance when considering the contribution of different cell types within the CNS to ongoing immune reactivity. In clinical (MS) or experimental (EAE) disorders in which MHC expressing astrocytes are present and postulated to be antigen-presenting cells, macrophages are a prominent cell type present at the lesion sites. MHC class II expression per se, however, may not indicate total immune competence of a cell. Umetsu et al. (1986) demonstrated that fibroblasts induced by v-interferon to express class lI MHC antigens were able to present antigen and to stimulate allogeneic T cell clones, but not resting T cells; these data suggest that certain class II MHC expressing cells may not serve as primary antigen-presenting cells in vivo but may be able to perpetuate ongoing immune reactivity.",
