However, as a developing country with the largest population, this rapid economic growth primarily based on excessive consumption and waste of resources. Thus, China has been facing particularly severe ecological and environmental problems in speeding up industrialization and urbanization. The impact of the health risk factors is complex and difficult to accurately predict. Therefore, it is critical to investigate potential threats in the context of the human-animal-environment interface to protect human and animal health. The ''One Health'' concept recognizes that human health is connected to animal and environmental health. This review primarily discusses specific health problems in China, particularly zoonoses, and explains the origin and development of the One Health approach, as well as the importance of a holistic approach in China.",

In the previous three decades, the contradictions among the environment, resources and economic growth have become increasingly prominent. The natural ecology has deteriorated,which not only restricts the long-term economic development but also impacts human interests and even threatens the survival of mankind. The balance between economic development and ecological conservation in China has become a critical issue in recent decades (1) . Visible effects, such as emerging infectious diseases, SARS and MERS, indicate the necessity for close collaborations which is the advocacy by One Health include the national and local government, nongovernment agency, academia, research institute, interdisciplinary science community, the private sector, civil society and other stakeholder. One Health is a interdisciplinary approach suited to address health issues at the human-animal-environment interface (2) . One Health and Ecohealth (Ecosystem health), another holistic approach, despite the different origins, they appear to have increasing alignment regarding the aspects of vision and goals in recent years. However, compared with Ecohealth, One Health focuses more on network building, that's why we only focus on One Health here.",

These activities cause changes that threaten the capacity and resilience of ecosystems. Currently, forest coverage is only 21.6% in China, whereas the global average is 31.0%, which indicates that the per capita forest area in China is only approximately one-quarter of the world average. The forest volume in China is 89 m 3 per hectare, whereas it is 300 m 3 per hectare in the developed countries in Europe. The forest area in China is only one-seventh of the world's average level (6) . With accelerated urbanization and industrialization, the ecological restoration space has further been reduced.",

China's meat consumption continues to increase, whereas the corresponding data for the United States is showing a decline.

Wildlife resources are very abundant in China where more than 5,300 types of vertebrates live (44) . These wildlife species differ in their habits and also exist in diverse living environments, and the pathogens they carry are complex, which in turn forms a substantial natural pathogen reservoir. Generally, infected wild animals may not exhibit symptoms; however, they can transmit the pathogens to humans via specific mechanisms. Living environments, such as high-density breeding, make contact between captive wild animals and humans easier, which in turn increases the chance of cross-infection. For example, the avian influenza virus H7N9 has emerged with the capacity of cross-species infection; humans would get infected via exposure to the asymptomatic avian influenza virus and then exhibit a high fatality rate (45) . Thus, the frequent trade of wildlife and its products has also increased the risk of infection, which clearly threatens public health.",

Overall, China has become one of the countries worldwide with a major issue of bacterial resistance. The most serious consequence of drug abuse is the emergence of superbugs.

Second, professor LU chose rural areas in Henan Province as the research field and conducted a baseline rabies investigation. Based on the baseline, a specific community intervention model of One Health was formulated to analyze the residents exposed to rabies. The findings indicated that with the implementation of the One Health community intervention model, the rabies incidence in the residents decreased by 7.59% compared with the previous incidence, and community dog vaccination increased from 13.9 to 82.5%. Third, a study of dengue fever conducted by the Zhongshan CDC and veterinary departments together with the team of professor LU determined that a negative dengue infection is a potential factor in dengue fever outbreak. These findings indicated that One Health plays a vital role in disease prevention and control. This collaboration was beneficial, as it resulted in reduced risks, financial savings, reduced time to detect disease outbreaks, as well as improved plant health services.",

Subsequently, cost\u00c1benefit analysis showed that the schistosomiasis control program generated a societal benefit of $6.20 per $1 invested.
