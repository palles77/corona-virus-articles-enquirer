All chickens used in these studies originated from White Leghorn and Ancona linages. IBV Gray strain infection of MHC homozygous B12 and B19 haplotype chicks resulted in severe respiratory disease compared to chicks with B2/B2 and B5/B5 haplotypes. Demonstrating a dominant B2 phenotype, B2/B12 birds were also more resistant to IBV. Respiratory clinical illness in B8/B8 chicks was severe early after infection, while illness resolved similar to the B5 and B2 homozygous birds. Following M41 strain infection, birds with B2/B2 and B8/B8 haplotypes were again more resistant to clinical illness than B19/B19 birds. Real time RT-PCR indicated that infection was cleared more efficiently in trachea, lungs and kidneys of B2/B2 and B8/B8 birds compared with B19/B19 birds. Furthermore, M41 infected B2/B2 and B8/B8 chicks performed better in terms of body weight gain than B19/B19 chicks. These studies suggest that genetics of B defined haplotypes might be exploited to produce chicks resistant to respiratory pathogens or with more effective immune responses.",

The respiratory avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), has consis-tently been a major agricultural problem in chickens for many years (Cavanagh, 2007; Collisson et al., 1992) . IBV was the first coronavirus described (Schalk and Hawn, 1931) and the first for which the entire genome was sequenced (Binns et al., 1985; Boursnell et al., 1987; Collisson et al., 1992) . As a non-zoonotic virus, IBV is ideal for characterizing avian host responses to respiratory viruses. Furthermore, it provides a model for the highly contagious severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans, which resembles IBV in transmission, pathogenesis and genome structure (Jackwood, 2006) .",

            "text": "In chickens, IBV causes a highly contagious acute respiratory disease especially in commercial flocks and is transmitted by aerosol and fecal contamination. While respiratory signs of illness are coughing, sneezing, nasal discharge, gasping and tracheal rales, IBV successfully replicates in various tissues including respiratory, intestinal and reproductive tracts, as well as kidneys and infections have been linked to nephrogenic, enteric and reproductive diseases (Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003; Lucio and Fabricant, 1990; Raj and Jones, 1997) . Chickens of all ages can be infected, but morbidity and mortality are generally more severe in very young chicks. Economic losses are mainly attributed to decreased weight gain, feed efficiency, egg production and quality, mortality and condemnation (Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003) . IBV infection induces humoral and cellular immune responses in chickens, which result in viral clearance and protection against challenge infection (Cavanagh, 2007; Collisson et al., 2000; Ignjatovic and Galli, 1994; Pei et al., 2001; Raj and Jones, 1997; Seo et al., 2000) . The first IBV vaccine strains, which have undergone many in vivo and in vitro passages, were derived from the classical IBV Massachusetts 41 (M41) and the closely related Beaudette strains (Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003; Hodgson et al., 2004) . M41, a prototype strain of IBV, was first isolated in 1941 by Van Roekel at the University of Massachusetts (Fabricant, 1998; Jungherr et al., 1956) . During the following decades, numerous serologically and genetically distinct strains were identified throughout the world. Molecular studies suggest that continuing evolution of the viral spike protein, the target protein of neutralization, can result in vaccine breaks and IBV outbreaks (Bochkov et al., 2006; Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003; Ignjatovic and Sapats, 2000; Ignjatovic and Galli, 1994) . Variations are a result of the common occurrences of point mutations and recombination events (Cavanagh et al., 2005; Jackwood et al., 2012; Wang et al., 1994 Wang et al., , 1993 .",

Successful selection and breeding of chickens for disease resistance is a rational approach to reducing disease-related losses.

A retrospective study implicated the MHC B region in resistance to IBV where the vaccinated chicks with B13 and B21 haplotypes experienced higher mortalities than those with the B15 haplotype .

Two chicken stocks of diverse origins (White Leghorn and Wisconsin inbred line 3 Ancona breeds) have been selected for crosses to yield full and half-sib families (Briles, 2004) . All matings were designed to utilize parents from multiple families of the desired B haplotype with minimal inbreeding, where full and half sib matings were avoided. All NIU eggs were obtained from birds, whose MHC B haplotypes had been identified and were distinguishable by serology and microsatellite typing. All the homozygous B haplotype eggs were collected from several matings, in which all parents were homozygous for the 19, 12, 2, 5 or 8 B type allele (Briles and Briles, 1982; Fulton et al., 2006) . The heterozygous B2/B12 chicks were obtained from several matings of B2/B2 dams and B12/B12 sires.

In the current studies, birds with the homozygous B2, B5 and B8 haplotypes were identified as having only mild clinical disease to IBV while those with the homozygous B12 and B19 haplotypes presented with severe clinical disease. Interestingly, birds heterozygous for the less susceptible B2 and the more susceptible B12 haplotypes were at least as resistant as B2/B2 birds, suggesting a dominance of the resistant B2 phenotype. Similarly, Joiner et al. (2007) reported that the severity and duration of illness following Ark (Arkansas) IBV strain challenge was not significantly different in IBV-vaccinated B2/B15 and B2/ B21 birds, possibly reflecting the dominant B2 phenotype. In contrast, the kinetics of clinical illness differed for the B8 homozygous birds. The clinical illness of the B8/B8 birds resolved earlier following infection with the Gray strain than the more susceptible B12/ B12 and B19/B19 birds or than the B19/B19 birds following infection with the M41 strain. However, the initial respiratory signs of the B8/B8 birds were more severe early PI with the Gray strain similar to that observed for the B19 and B12 homozygous chicks although they recovered faster than even the B2/B2, B5/B5 and B2/B12 birds. The early differences observed following infection of the B8/B8 birds could be due to inherent differences in the B8/ B8 line of chicks. homozygous birds more effectively cleared virus.

Furthermore, the sequences in the B complex encompassing 14 gene loci from BG1 to BF2 have been shown to be identical at nine loci between the B12 and B19 haplotypes and at seven loci between the B5/B5 and B8/B8 (Hosomichi et al., 2008) . However, sequences of the B2/B2 haplotype were not found to be relatively close to either the B12 and B19, nor the B5 and B8 haplotypes. Overall, the striking differences in disease resistance following IBV infection may be, at least in part, a direct consequence of differences in MHC B region.

Infection of congenic lines of birds with a highly pathogenic strain of avian influenza virus (AIV) suggested that resistance could also be dependent on genes outside of the B locus (Hunt et al., 2010) . However, the strain of AIV used was lethal even in many of the more resistant birds. Thus, the pathogenesis is very different from IBV strains that cause respiratory illness with low mortality, although the resistance and susceptibility in our studies were similar regardless of the IBV strain used. It is possible that genes outside that B region do influence, if not determine, resistance to viral infection. Future studies, determining the pathogenesis of IBV in inbred congenic chicken lines homozygous and heterozygous for these haplotypes, would more precisely define the impact of the B region and/or non-B regions on viral resistance.

The decrease in body weight due to infection is an expected finding. Although not defined by their MHC, similar results were reported by Otsuki et al.

The clearance of IBV from the tissues of the more resistance birds, especially early after infection could be attributed directly or indirectly to more responsive innate immune responses (Dawes & Drechsler, unpublished data) . In companion studies, the B2/B2 macrophages differentiated more readily and were dramatically more responsive to both IFNc (interferon gamma) and poly I:C (polyinosinic polycytidylic acid) than B19/B19 macrophages (Dawes & Drechsler, unpublished data). The latter stimulant simulates infection with an RNA virus, such as IBV, and the IFNc response was intended to reflect the interphase between innate and adaptive immunity. Moreover, lymphocytes that infiltrate trachea, lungs and kidneys following infection with IBV have been shown to be T cells (Janse et al., 1994) . MHC-restricted, IBV specific cytotoxic T cell responses have been shown to correlate with initial decreases in viral load and clinical signs Pei et al., 2003; . Elucidating the interphase between innate and adaptive immune responses to IBV needs to be further examined in resistant and susceptible birds of defined B haplotypes.",

The DNA sequencing of the MHC I (B-F) and MHC II (B-L) genes indicated that, although promoters of the avian are very similar, enhancer A sequences vary for the B2, B4, B8 and B21 haplotypes and are missing entirely in the B12 and B19 haplotypes (Kaufman et al., 1999; Miller et al., 2004) . Genetic resistance linked to the chicken B complex could be explained by variations in expressed MHC molecules.

The results in this manuscript indicate that these lines may be useful in defining B haplotype-linked influences on resistance to respiratory viruses, as well as differences in vaccines responses. These studies associated chicken MHC or B complex with IBV respiratory illness regardless of the IBV strain used. They also suggest that one might determine the sequences within the B2, B5 and B8 loci for eventual selection of chickens with resistance to IBV strains of distinct pathotypes. The chickens with the resistant haplotypes showed less severe clinical illness, cleared the virus infection sooner and performed better in terms of body weight than the susceptible chickens. An implication of these studies is the potential to breed birds with resistance genes from B2, B5 or B8 haplotypes in order to increase resistance to IBV and perhaps to other respiratory viral pathogens. While ongoing studies (Dawes and Drechsler, unpublished data) have identified functional differences in macrophages that would likely impact the sequelae of viral infection, future studies should investigate differences in adaptive immunity that would be further correlated with viral resistance.
