Fire Administration's National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS), stated that from 1987 to 1991, office buildings, hotels and motels, apartment buildings, and facilities that care for the sick, averaged 13,800 high-rise building fires per year and associated annual losses of 74 civilian deaths, nearly 720 civilian injuries, and $79 million in direct property damage. however, \"most of these high-rise building fires and associated losses occurred in apartment buildings.\" 11 hall added that for this period: \"Only a small share of high-rise building fires spread beyond the room of origin, let alone the floor of origin.\" 12 The most recent published study by hall shows that \"in 2002, 13 high-rise buildings in these four property classes combined had 7,300 reported structure fires and associated losses of 15 civilian deaths, 300 civilian injuries, and $26 million in direct property damage.\" 14 he concluded that \"these statistics generally show a declining fire problem over the nearly two decades covered\" 15 and, similar to his previous findings, \"most high-rise building fires and associated losses occur in apartment buildings.\" 16 he further comments pertaining to the latter, \"this may seem surprising, but it shouldn't. homes dominate the u.S. fire problem so completely that it is always a good bet that any newly examined fire problem, unless it is one that cannot occur in homes, will have its largest share in homes.\" 17 however, hall did caution that, due to a number of factors (one being lower participation in national fire incident reporting in recent years 18 ) \"the patterns shown in data available so far should be given limited weight.\" 19 r \"here, 'risk' refers solely to the risk of having a reported fire\" (hall Jr JR. High-Rise Building Fires. Quincy, MA: National Fire Protection Association; September 2001:17). rr \"Tracking of the fire experience in [u.S.] high-rise buildings, however, has been less than systematic because the nationally representative fire incident data bases did not originally include reporting of height of structure. Reasonably good reporting began with 1985 fires\u2026. NFPA [National Fire Protection Association] and other analysts have long used lists of particularly memorable incidents to study the high-rise fire problem, but these and other available special data bases are heavily weighed towards larger and more severe incidents\" (hall Jr JR. High-Rise Building Fires. Quincy, MA: National Fire Protection Association; September 2001:1). rrr \"The term 'motel' is a general designation for lodging establishments that specialize in attracting the motoring public by offering parking accommodations. The distinctions between hotels and motels are gradually disappearing, however\" (Beaudry Mh. Contemporary Lodging Security. Newton, MA: Butterworthheinemann; 1996:ix It is worth noting here that O'hagan, in his book High Rise/Fire and Life Safety, stated that high-rise residential building fires to some extent are different in nature and not as severe as fires in high-rise office buildings (see the earlier discussion in Chapter 2). Two of his stated reasons for this position are (1) high-rise residential buildings are typically of masonry construction and lack the empty spaces between the interior of their exterior walls and the outer edges of their floors (that typify the curtain walls of steelframed [core construction] buildings) and (2) for privacy and usage reasons, residential buildings are typically compartmentalized with walls and partitions that have adequate fire resistance to withstand the fire until the arrival of the fire department; as a result individual fires are considerably smaller in area. 20",

(See Chapter 4.) Because fire is a risk in high-rise buildings, the following is noted regarding their fire protection features: residential and apartment buildings that have properly designed, installed, operated, tested, and maintained automatic fire detection and suppression systems and other fire protection features-automatic closing fire doors for compartmentation and maintenance of the integrity of occupant escape routes and automatic smoke control systems to restrict the spread of smoke-do have the necessary early warning systems to quickly detect fires and warn occupants (including residents and visitors) of their presence; and they also have the necessary automated sprinkler systems to quickly extinguish a fire in its early stages. One of the key issues here is the presence or absence of sprinklers. 20 In the study mentioned in the previous section, \"Threats,\" hall commented on fire protection in high-rise buildings by stating,",

For highrise buildings, automatic extinguishing systems are associated with a reduction of at least 88% in the rate of deaths per 1,000 fires for each of the three property classes (excluding office buildings, which had no deaths recorded in NFIRS [National Fire Incident Reporting System] in high-rise buildings) and at least 44% in the average dollar loss per fire for each of the four property classes. Fire detection equipment is associated with a reduction of 55% in the rate of deaths per 1,000 fires in apartment buildings. Fire-resistive construction is associated with a reduction of 30% in average dollar loss per fire in apartment buildings. This probably is produced not directly by the construction but indirectly by the compartmentation features that tend to be used with fire-resistive construction, features that keep more fires smaller and so keep property losses lower. (Note, though, that compartmentation practices probably vary more by type of occupancy than by type of construction.) Because high-rise buildings often use all three systems, it is very difficult to try to separate their effects on loss rates, and many rates are very sensitive to deaths or large dollar loss in individual incidents.",

If a written brochure is used, it may also include a Certificate of Occupant Training ( Figure A9 -20 contained in Appendix 9-2 on the Cd-ROM provided with this book) to be filled out by the occupant receiving the training and returned to the building fire safety director for record keeping. Figure A9 -21 in Appendix 9-2 on the Cd-ROM provided with this book is a sample of a building's website on which emergency phone numbers, an emergency procedures brochure, a site plan depicting outside safe refuge areas, building floor plans, a fire life safety video, and other emergency preparedness resources (such as links to public websites) are published. If such web-based fire life safety training is provided, some learning management systems record the actual training that each occupant has participated in. For example, after viewing a fire life safety training video, the occupant is asked to answer online questions to gauge his or her comprehension of the viewed material. The occupant's answers are permanently recorded by the system. These records can be invaluable in determining occupant participation in fire life safety training. Also, they can be used as evidence to demonstrate a building's efforts to prepare occupants for emergencies.",

Every site and building is different, and emergency plans vary according to local laws and the requirements of the authority that has jurisdiction. It is up to each residential and apartment building to develop the emergency management plan most appropriate to its needs. Summary l From the time a vehicle enters the parking structure and residents proceed to the building, travel in the tower elevators, and enter an individual residence or apartment, there is a need for access control measures that sift out unwanted persons and intruders and yet constitute a minimum of inconvenience to legitimate building users. l The purpose of establishing, implementing, and maintaining a building emergency management plan is to provide for the life safety of all building occupants. l \"Occupants of each living unit must be given emergency instructions on a yearly basis, indicating the location of alarms, exiting paths, and actions to be taken in response to a fire in the living unit and in response to the sounding of an alarm.\" 45 r A drill is defined by the NFPA Glossary of Terms, National Fire Code, as \"an exercise involving a credible simulated emergency that requires personnel to perform emergency response operations for the purpose of evaluating the effectiveness of the training and education programs and the competence of personnel in performing required response duties and functions\" (Quincy, MA: National Fire Protection Association; 2005). A fire drill is such an exercise for a simulated fire emergency. The local authority that has jurisdiction will specify at what intervals the fire drills shall be conducted. rr A mutual aid agreement is \"a pre-arranged agreement developed between two or more entities to render assistance to the parties of the agreement\" (ASIS Business Continuity Guideline. Alexandria, VA: ASIS International; January 2005:8). 45 Bush K. Apartment buildings. In: Fire Protection Handbook. 20th ed. Quincy, MA: National Fire Protection Association; 2008:20-47.",

At present, our buildings are not well designed to achieve the needed level of situation awareness, despite the availability of many technological tools. Addressable detection devices can pinpoint the locations of detection of hazards, but the building interfaces used to display the information [do] not supply an immediately comprehensible understanding of the situation. Technological devices like CCTV cameras and smoke detectors are not deployed in ways that help building management and emergency responders understand the status of key egress systems like stairs and corridors. Research and development towards the support of situation awareness in buildings is a priority.",
