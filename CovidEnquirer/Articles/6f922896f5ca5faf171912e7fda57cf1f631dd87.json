            "text": "Many studies have shown that the activation of b-catenin signaling can promote oncogenesis, and it is therefore of interest to find agents that modulate this pathway. Recent work has shown using B lymphoma cells that infection by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and expression of its latent membrane protein (LMP)-1, cause increases in the expression of b-catenin and cellular transformation. Conversely, results from cell-based small molecule screening studies have shown that the antibiotic hexachlorophene can down-regulate b-catenin in colon cancer cells. Here we report that hexachlorophene also counteracts the elevated bcatenin levels in EBV-infected B lymphomas. This is associated with restoration in levels of Siah-1 (an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is active in b-catenin regulation) which had been diminished by LMP-1. Our results suggest that Siah-1 is targeted by both LMP-1 and hexachlorophene with opposite effects. The hexachlorophene modulation of Siah-1 and b-catenin is independent of p53 and results in reduced expression of cyclin-D1 and c-Myc (target genes of b-catenin), leading to the growth arrest of B lymphoma cells. From these results we propose that hexachlorophene may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for EBVinfected B lymphoma cells by reducing b-catenin levels via the restoration of Siah-1.",

In particular, the abnormal up-regulation of Wnt/b-catenin activity has been frequently detected as an early event in many cancers [3] . The level of b-catenin is normally regulated in part through its targeted decay as mediated by a glycogen synthase kinase-3b (GSK-3b)-dependent pathway [4] and alternatively by a Siah-1-dependent pathway [5] . In the GSK-3b-depen-dent pathway, b-catenin is phosphorylated by a multi-protein complex composed of APC, Axin, and GSK-3b [6, 7] , leading to the degradation of b-catenin through a ubiquitin-dependent mechanism [8] . Conversely, in the Siah-1dependent pathway, Siah-1 interacts with the carboxyl terminus of APC, recruits the ubiquitination complex, and promotes the degradation of b-catenin through a pathway independent of both GSK-3b and b-TrCP, an F-box protein in the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex [5] .",

All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.canlet.2008. 10 .041 has shown that latent membrane protein (LMP)-1 of EBV can transform rodent fibroblasts in vitro [9] and induces lymphomas in transgenic mice [10] . Thus, LMP-1 has been considered as an important and multifunctional oncoprotein, causing the dysregulation of cell signaling pathways and inducing a variety of cellular genes that enhance cell survival and adhesive, invasive, and angiogenic potential [11] . For example, LMP-1 oncoprotein appears to mimic cellular CD40 molecules, leading to interaction with TRAF proteins and culminating in the activation of NF-jB and JNK [12, 13] . Other studies have shown that LMP-1 also activates Stat molecules through JAK interactions [14] , and LMP-1 has recently been reported to elevate b-catenin protein levels through down-regulation of Siah-1 E3 ubiquitin ligase [15] .",

Here we report that hexachlorophene does indeed suppress the level of LMP-1-induced b-catenin in EBV-infected B lymphoma, apparently through the rescue of Siah-1 E3 ubiquitin ligase. Our results thus raise the possibility that hexachlorophene or similar compounds may ultimately be useful in the treatment of EBV-mediated B lymphoma.",

The infection with EBV was confirmed by the expression of LMP-1, a primary oncogenic protein in IM9 and Raji B cells (Fig. 1A ). This figure also shows that the protein level of Siah-1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, was decreased whereas the b-catenin protein level was enhanced in the IM9 and Raji cells. By comparison, the Siah-1 level was higher while the b-catenin level was lower in both BJAB and Ramos B cells. To test whether LMP-1 (instead of other viral proteins) is specifically linked to the up-regulation of b-catenin and the down-regulation of Siah-1, we expressed LMP-1 protein in BJAB cells using electroporated pcDNA3-LMP-1 vector. We found that LMP-1 expression alone is sufficient to reduce Siah-1 protein levels, leading to up-regulation of b-catenin (Fig. 1B) . In addition, to determine whether the increased b-catenin due to the introduction of LMP-1 is transcriptionally active, we transfected cells with a reporter plasmid containing wild-type (TOPFlash) or mutant (FOPFlash) binding sites for Tcf [22] in the presence or absence of LMP-1. As seen in Fig. 1C , LMP-1 expression specifically induced Tcf reporter activity, indicating that at least some of the LMP-1-induced b-catenin is transcriptionally active. To examine whether LMP-1 also down-regulates Siah-1 mRNA levels, we measured Siah-1 mRNA from BJAB cells in the presence and absence of LMP-1 using RT-PCR. As seen in Fig. 1D , the presence of LMP-1 down-regulated Siah-1 mRNA levels in a dose-dependent manner. The results suggest that LMP-1 reduces Siah-1 both protein and mRNA levels. Taken together, we propose that LMP-1 expression induces up-regulation of b-catenin through down-regulation of Siah-1.",

We therefore examined whether hexachlorophene can also down-regulate the high levels of b-catenin observed in EBV-infected B lymphoma. As shown in Fig. 2A and B, hexachlorophene significantly down-regulates protein as well as mRNA levels of b-catenin level in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, hexachlorophene treatment reduced LMP-1-induced Tcf transcriptional activity in a dose dependent manner (Fig. 2C) . Next, to examine whether proteosomes are involved in the down-regulation of b-catenin following treatment with hexachlorophene, we administered MG132 (a proteosome inhibitor) into hexachlorophene-treated cells and then analyzed the b-catenin level. We found that b-catenin levels were restored by MG132 when compared with cells treated only with hexachlorophene (Fig. 2D) , suggesting that down-regulation of b-catenin mediated by hexachlorophene is achieved via proteosome activation. Of interest, the introduction of cycloheximide, an inhibitor of protein synthesis, also partly restored the b-catenin level from hexachlorophene-treated cells (Fig. 2D) , suggesting that some aspect of protein synthesis is required for the activity of the b-catenin degradation pathway.",

As seen in Fig. 3A , hexachlorophene also induced up-regulation of Siah-1 levels, associated with the decrease of b-catenin in EBV-infected B cells (1st and 2nd lanes). To confirm that this feature is mediated by LMP-1 expression, we also introduced the LMP-1 expression vector into BJAB cells and treated them with hexachlorophene. We found that hexachlorophene treatment rescues the decreased Siah-1 level mediated by LMP-1, resulting once again in up-regulation of b-catenin (Fig. 3B) . Next, since the phosphorylation of b-catenin by GSK-3b, followed by association with b-TrCP, can lead independently to b-catenin degradation [8] , we tested whether GSK-3b and Siah-1 might cooperate to regulate b-catenin. However, we found that GSK-3b inhibition using LiCl caused an increase in b-catenin protein levels without affecting Siah-1 levels in IM9 B cells (Fig. 3A, 3rd lane) , suggesting that GSK-3b protein is not directly involved in the Siah-1 signaling pathway. However, co-administration of LiCl and hexachlorophene caused the protein level of b-catenin to be still elevated (Fig. 3A , 4th lane) in IM9 B cells. This suggests that the effect of LiCl on the induction of b-catenin through GSK-3b inhibition overrides that of hexachlorophene through Siah-1 in EBV-infected B lymphoma.",

In addition, some genotoxic reagents, such as doxorubicin, may suppress the b-catenin response through the p53-inducible transcription pathway involving Siah-1 [5] . To further explore this issue, we investigated whether hexachlorophene treatment might influence p53 transcription in IM9 cells, which contain wild-type p53. As seen in Fig. 4A , neither hexachlorophene nor doxorubicin treatment affected p53 transcript abundance [23, 24] . Furthermore, we examined p53 protein levels after the treatment with hexachlorophene and found again no change in p53 protein level, even at 30 lM hexachlorophene, whereas doxorubicin induced up-regulation of p53 abundance (Fig. 4B ). In addition, to determine whether the increased Siah-1 due to treatment with hexachlorophene enhances p53 transcriptional activation of target genes, we transfected cells with a luciferase reporter vector containing a target sequence for binding of p53 protein. As seen in Fig. 4C , hexachlorophene did not increase p53 transcriptional activity while doxorubicin drastically enhanced p53 transcriptional activation of the target. These results suggest that hexachlorophene induces the expression of Siah-1 independently of p53 pathway activation. ",

As seen in Fig. 5A , the expression levels of cyclin-D1 and c-Myc were diminished in nuclear extracts when compared with Sp-1 expression, in a hexachlorophene dose-dependent manner at 12 h post-treatment. As other groups have reported that shRNA or chemical inhibition of b-catenin induces retardation of tumor cell growth [29] [30] [31] , we explored the potential biological consequence of the reduced b-catenin levels achieved by treatment with hexachlorophene. When we examined viable cells of EBV positive B lymphoma, we observed a striking dose-dependent decrease in viable cell numbers of IM9 B lymphoma cells 48 h after treatment with hexachlorophene (Fig. 5B) . These results suggest that hexachlorophene decreases the expression of b-catenin-dependent genes, leading to the growth arrest of B lymphoma cells.",

Here we show that LMP-1, a primary oncoprotein of EBV also induces up-regulation of b-catenin in B lymphocytes by the decrease of Siah-1 protein and mRNA levels. As it is known that Siah-1 itself is a target for ubiquitination and proteosomal degradation [36] , LMP-1 may affect Siah-1 protein destabilization. In addition, LMP-1 down-regulates Siah-1 mRNA levels, which indicates that LMP-1 might inhibit transcription of the Siah-1 gene. Although the promoter region of Siah-1 has been recently identified [37] , more work is required to establish in detail how LMP-1 inhibits transcription of Siah-1.",

Hexachlorophene specifically up-regulates Siah-1 mRNA and protein in B lymphoma, counteracting its down-regulation by LMP-1. Furthermore, prolonged exposure of EBV-infected B lymphoma cells to hexachlorophene also induces apoptotic cell death and down-regulation of b-catenin targeted gene expression. However, the up-regulation of b-catenin by LiCl through GSK-3b inhibition overrides that of hexachlorophene through Siah-1 in EBV-infected B lymphoma (Fig. 3) . Since previous work showed that hexachlorophene can inhibit the expression of b-catenin induced by LiCl in HEK293 cells [19] , this difference in response in the two cell types is currently under investigation. Of interest, we observed that cycloheximide restores b-catenin levels in hexachlorophene-treated cells (Fig. 2D) . As we suspect that the stability of proteins that are involved in the regulation of b-catenin expression is also a critical factor, Siah-1 degradation by cycloheximide treatment may contribute to the recovery of b-catenin; this point will be the subject of further studies by our group.",

However, hexachlorophene does not affect p53 at either the transcriptional and translational level in our study: this suggests the existence of another hexachlorophene-responsive and p53independent pathway for the regulation of Siah-1. A recent report showing that Wnt5a also promotes the degradation of b-catenin through the p53-independent up-regulation of Siah-1 level is consistent with our suggestion [39] . Since hexachlorophene can suppress Wnt/b-catenin signaling in a p53-independent manner, it is possible that this potential therapeutic strategy may be effective against cancer cells with mutant p53, which is commonly found in many cancers that are resistant to genotoxic chemotherapeutics.",
