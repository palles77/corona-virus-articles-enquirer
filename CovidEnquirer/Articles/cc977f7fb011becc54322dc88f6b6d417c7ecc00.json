            "text": "Objective A case-control study was conducted to assess seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness (SIVE) during the 2015-2016 influenza season. Methods A study was performed in three departments in Lithuania between 1 December 2015 and 1 May 2016. Data on demographic and clinical characteristics including influenza vaccination status were collected from the patients recommended to receive the seasonal influenza vaccine. Influenza virus infection was confirmed by multiplex reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) . results Ninety-one (56.4%) of the 163 included subjects were \u226565 years old. Fifteen (9.2%) subjects were vaccinated against influenza at least 2 weeks before the onset of influenza symptoms, 12 of them were \u226565 years old. Of the 72 (44.2%) influenza virus positive cases, 65 (39.9%) were confirmed with influenza A (including 50 cases of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09), eight (4.9%) were confirmed with influenza B and one was a co-infection. Unadjusted SIVE against any influenza, influenza type A and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 was 57% (95% CI \u221241% to 87%), 52% (95% CI \u221257% to 85%) and 70% (95% CI \u221243% to 94%) respectively. conclusion Although SIVE estimates were not statistically significant the point estimates suggest moderate effectiveness against influenza type A.",

            "text": "Influenza is a highly contagious viral airborne disease that in the northern hemisphere typically occurs during the winter months. 1 Annual influenza epidemics result in high morbidity (three to five million cases of severe illness) and significant mortality rates (250 000-500 000 deaths) worldwide. 2 In addition, for people with chronic underlying medical conditions and those of 65 years old and older influenza is associated with significant adverse health outcomes, [3] [4] [5] such as influenza-related hospitalisations and deaths. 6 7 The most effective way to prevent potentially severe influenza complications is vaccination. 8 9 Annual influenza immunisation is recommended for the most vulnerable groups, such as adults aged \u226565 years and people with co-morbidities. 10 However, the evidence base for this recommendation is weak, and except for a few randomised control trials, is based on the results of observational studies. 11 12 The lack of laboratory confirmation of influenza infection and the assessment of influenza vaccination effectiveness against non-specific outcomes are the major limitations of the majority of the existing observational studies. Relatively recently, the test-negative case-control studies have been introduced to assess seasonal influenza vaccine effectiveness (SIVE), and despite some limitations, they are currently considered to be the most accurate and efficient way to monitor SIVE. 13 ",

The study population consisted of 18 years and older individuals with underlying medical conditions, healthy \u226565 years old individuals and pregnant women living in the community, who were admitted to one of the participating sites due to SARI with no contraindication for influenza vaccination, that is, allergies to influenza vaccine and other adverse events to vaccinations in the past.

Patients were not eligible to be included in the study when they were institutionalised, unwilling to participate, not able to communicate, not able and/or willing to give written informed consent (IC). Eligible patients were asked to provide one throat and one nose swab specimen for influenza testing by the multiplex RT-PCR. As data from shedding studies propose that influenza virus detection decreases after 7 days, recruitment was limited to patients who were swabbed not more than 7 days after onset of the symptoms. 18 Swabbing was done after the information on demographic and clinical characteristics was collected from the medical history and patient self-report.",

Although we were not able to perform SIVE due to extremely low numbers of influenza B cases, our findings show that the circulating strain mismatched the B/Yamagata lineage virus, which was included in the 2015/2016 season's vaccine. This was confirmed by the OR of 1 when 0 vaccinated influenza B cases were replaced with one case, as well as not significant mid-season estimate of 4% found in Denmark. 12 Five deaths occurred in our study during the 2015-2016 influenza season, of which four subjects were positive for influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. All five subjects had at least one underlying medical condition. Three of the four influenza cases were younger than 65 years. Only one (influenza positive) patient was vaccinated against influenza this season. During hospitalisation, all patients developed the unilateral or bilateral pneumonia. The main cause of death among the influenza cases was the respiratory insufficiency due to the acute respiratory distress syndrome. Such high mortality in our study sample, and especially among the influenza confirmed cases (5.6%) as compared with controls (1.1%) reflects the severity of the condition of the hospitalised population and the increased risk for severe influenza-related outcomes and calls for better influenza prevention measures for the risk groups.",

The selection bias was reduced by including the patients into the study before the laboratory result of influenza status was known; cases and controls were similar with regard to the demographic and clinical characteristics. The outcome bias was further reduced by using a very sensitive influenza detection method. 32 The exposure status was verified with the GP, and therefore exposure misclassification was very unlikely. That together gives us confidence that despite low sample size and low precision of the SIVE estimates, the bias in this test-negative case-control study, except for unmeasured confounding, which we were not able to assess, is limited. 33 34 This study has several limitations. First, the two participating university hospitals are located in two of the 10 districts in the country. However, the infectious diseases units in these hospitals are the main centres where the majority of patients with clinically suspected influenza are admitted in the Vilnius and Kaunas regions and they cover about 35% of the Lithuanian population. 35 The low precision of the SIVE estimates was partly due to low number of vaccinated patients, which would require a much higher sample size to be able to provide precise SIVE estimates. Nevertheless, we addressed the potential biases in the design and the analysis stages of the study, and at least for influenza type A the obtained estimates are likely to be a reasonable indication of SIVE during the 2015-2016 season.",

In England, for example, GPs and other providers are encouraged to contact eligible patients in September and actively invite them to attend the clinics and get vaccinated against influenza. 17 37 In Lithuania, personal invitations are usually not sent and the vaccination coverage among the healthcare workers themselves is quite low, 36 which likely influences the patients' decisions as well.
