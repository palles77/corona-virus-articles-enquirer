Two women were less than 28 weeks of gestation and the other 11 patients were in their third trimesters at presentation. None of the patients had underlying medical disease. Previous studies suggested that COVID-19 is more likely to affect older males with comorbidities [3] . We reported 13 pregnant COVID-19 patients in China, indicating pregnant women also susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. Clinical manifestations of the pregnant COVID-19 patients in this study varied widely from asymptomatic to very severe, similar to previous report in non-pregnant patients [4] . Most of the pregnant patients had mild to moderate symptoms. Fever and fatigue were the principal symptoms, and less common symptoms were sore throat and shortness of breath. Almost all the patients had a clear epidemiologic history.",

Three of the patients (23%) improved after hospitalization and got discharged with an uncomplicated ongoing pregnancy. The other 10 patients (77%) all underwent caesarean section. Five of the 10 patients were delivered by emergency cesarean section because of pregnancy complications including fetal distress (in three of ten patients) , premature rupture of the membrane (in one of ten) and stillbirth (in one of ten). Six patients (46%) had preterm labour between 32-36 weeks of gestation. Patient 6's condition deteriorated during hospitalization, prompting intensive care unit (ICU) admission with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) including acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation, acute hepatic failure, acute renal failure and septic shock. As of February 25th, Patient 6 was still in the support of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO). The other 12 pregnant patients were all discharged with no obvious complication. Except for 1 stillbirth, nine newborn infants got a 1-min Apgar score of 10. There was no clinical or serologic evidence suggestive of vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2.",
