Since the nucleocapsid (N) protein is highly conserved, it is a candidate protein for early diagnosis and vaccine development. In this study, the N genes of 15 PEDV strains were amplified by RT-PCR and cloned into the pMT-19T vector, sequenced, and compared to each other as well as to PEDV reference strains. The nucleotide sequences of the N gene of the Chinese PEDV strains consist of 1326 nucleotides and encode a 441-aa-long peptide. The nucleotide sequences of the fifteen PEDV strains in our study were 96.1-100 % identical to each other, and the deduced amino acid sequences were 94.8-100 % identical. Sequence comparison with other PEDV strains selected from Gen-Bank revealed that their nucleotide sequences were 94.2-99.7 % identical to those of the Chinese PEDV strains, and their deduced amino acid sequences were 94.1-99.5 % identical. In addition, the fifteen strains showed a high degree of nucleotide sequence identity to the early domestic strains (98.4-99.7 %) except the LZC strain, but less sequence identity to the vaccine strain (CV777) used in . Phylogenetic analysis showed that the Chinese PEDV strains are composed of a separate cluster including three early domestic strains (JS-2004-02, LJB/03 and DX) but differ genetically from the vaccine strain (CV777) and the early Korean strains (Chinju99 and SM98).",

PED was first reported in England in 1971 [2] . Since then, PED occurs in most swine-raising countries in Europe, as well as China, Korea, Thailand, and Japan [3] [4] [5] [6] . However, this disease is becoming a big concern especially in Asia, where outbreaks are often more acute and severe than those observed in Europe [7, 8] . Since the beginning of October 2010, a porcine epidemic diarrhea epizootic has been occurring in China, affecting pigs of all ages but characterized by high mortality rates among suckling piglets. The outbreak has been prevalent nationwide and has caused huge economic losses [9] [10] [11] . Most of the affected farms have lost 100 % of their newborn piglets, usually within 7 days, but sometimes even within only a few hours of birth. Few sows or boars show any clinical signs, which is inconsistent with a previous report of an outbreak in Thailand in 2007 that was characterized by pigs of all ages being infected and showing different degrees of diarrhea and anorexia [4] . In addition, in China, sporadic outbreaks of PED have been seen year round, and not just in the winter months.",

The genome is comprised of a 5' untranslated region (UTR), a 3' UTR, and at least seven open reading frames (ORFs) that encode four structural proteins, (spike [S], envelope [E], membrane [M], and nucleocapsid [N]) and three non-structural proteins (replicase 1a and 1b and ORF3) [15] [16] [17] . It has been reported that the N protein binds to viral RNA, providing a structural basis for the helical nucleocapsid, which is a basic phosphoprotein associated with the genome [18] . In addition, the N protein is thought to be important in inducing cell-mediated immunity in the host [19] . The N protein participates in transcription of the viral genome, the formation of the viral core, and packaging of viral RNA [20, 21] . In the early stages of PEDV infection, a pig can produce high levels of antibodies against the N protein. Since the N protein is highly conserved, it is the best candidate protein for use as an antigen for early diagnosis reagents and vaccine development [22] [23] [24] .",

These data provide additional molecular epidemiological information on PEDV circulating in China and provide a basis for further development of diagnostic reagents and methods as well as assisting in vaccine selection.",

None of the Chinese strains were found to have sequence insertions or deletions in their N genes. Sequence comparison with other PEDV strains selected from GenBank indicated that the N genes of the Chinese strains were highly conserved, even though these strains originated from different geographic regions. The alignment also showed that the N gene sequences have a high degree of nucleotide sequence identity. This could be useful information for the development of genetically engineered N proteins for vaccine development and prevention of PEDV infections. The N protein is a phosphorylated structural protein that is associated with the viral genome and is abundant in virus-infected cells [25] . Therefore, the appearance of the N protein indicates replication of PEDV, and this can be used for early and accurate detection of virus replication in infected cells [23, 26] . Previous studies have shown that the N protein of the Chinju99 isolate has seven potential T-or S-linked phosphorylation sites [27] . In this study it was revealed that the CH-GX1-2011 strain (representing all of the 15 Chinese strains) had the same number of T-or S-linked phosphorylation sites as Chinju99 despite that fact that there were 15-18 mismatched amino acids when compared to Chinju99, LJB/03 and DX [28, 29] . Moreover, the CH-GX1-2011 strain had seven potential protein kinase C phosphorylation sites, nine casein kinase II phosphorylation sites, one tyrosine kinase phosphorylation site, and two cAMP-and cGMP-dependent protein kinase phosphorylation sites. There are larger hydrophilic regions in the center of the N protein that might play a role in transcription and replication of the viral genome.",

Sequence comparison with the other seven selected strains of PEDV revealed that the Chinese field PEDV strains had nucleotide sequence identities of 94.2-99.7 % and deduced amino acid sequence identities of 94.1-99.5 %. In addition, the fifteen strains showed a high degree of nucleotide sequence identity to the early domestic strains (98.4-99.7 %) except the LZC strain, but less identity to the vaccine strain (CV777) used in China (94.7-97.7 %). Sequence analysis of the N gene Sequence analysis revealed that none of the fifteen strains had insertions or deletions in the N gene. In each case, the N gene had an ORF of 1326 nucleotides coding for a 441-amino-acid protein. The alignment with the Chinju99 strain indicates that the N gene is highly conserved except for some point mutations located at amino acid positions 84, 123, 142, 144, 206, 242 to 255 292, 317, 350, 369 and 394 to 413 (shown in",
