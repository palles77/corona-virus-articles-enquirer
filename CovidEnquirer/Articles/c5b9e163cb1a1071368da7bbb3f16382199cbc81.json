Once the enough amount of protein enters into circulation, immune response against disease-causing pathogens is initiated. These do not require large stainless steel tanks for cell culture and purification. They require only green houses. In the process of edible vaccine production, the desired antigen coding gene isolated from microbes and processed in two manners: (1) by genetic engineering, recombinant virus is introduced into plants. Chimeric virions are extracted and purified from these plants. The edible vaccines thus produced are used for immunological purpose, (2) another method is of transformation technique, vector is integrated with gene of interest (Geetika and Sanjana, 2014; Mishra et al., 2008; Kamenarova et al., 2005) .

The endocytosis process makes the DNA free to recombine and integrate into the host genome Fukunaga et al., 1983) . Viral vectors can also be used in this system. The successful transformation has been reported in various plants, e.g., in tobacco, wheat, and potato (Dekeyser et al., 1990; Zhu et al., 1993; Sawahel, 2002) . Another example is transformation of intact yeast artificial chromosomes into plant cell, which was successfully achieved via lipofection-like particle bombardment.

When taken orally, edible vaccine undergoes mastication process and then enters into intestine for further degradation via enzymes and acids present in the gut.

However, if it is from transgenic plants, then it is free from toxin (Geetika and Sanjana, 2014) . The edible vaccines provide more immunity when compared to conventional vaccines because in later case the sugar attached to animal vaccines was not reckoned to be beneficial. Conventional vaccines are expensive, need sterilization conditions, purification, refrigeration for proper storage, have poor mucosal response, and require cold chain and trained medical personnel when compared to edible vaccines. Children have to experience pain for immunization and vaccination; therefore, noncompliance is observed. The edible vaccines bypass all these conditions, need not be administered with a needle and syringe, can be eaten, and noncompliance is not observed. There is no need of trained medical personnel, have good stability, do not require refrigeration, shipping cost is eliminated, cold chained is not required, and contamination is also not found. Moreover, edible vaccines are economical as compared to conventional vaccines because of mass production, transportation, ease of separation, and purification from plant materials.",

The available vaccine for measles is a live attenuated vaccine having certain disadvantages. For preparing edible vaccine, MV-H (measles virus hemagglutinin from Edmonston strain) antigen was introduced in tobacco plant using a plasmid vector. It was observed that serum antibodies induced immune response against the antigen. The fecal samples of immunized animal were also found to contain antigencontaining IgA antibodies. Therefore, transgenic rice, lettuce, and baby food have been developed against measles. If this was given along with CTB, 35\u00c050 g of MV-H lettuce was enough, but a higher dose might show better results (Giddings et al., 2000) .",

During this infection, the first detectable antigen is hepatitis B surface antigen (HBSAg). Vaccination is available against Hepatitis B infection. The transgenic plants were developed by CaMV (Cauliflower mosaic virus) plasmid cloned by HBSAg subtype and thus regenerated plants produced HBSAg from the transformed cells. Further experiments in potatoes showed higher concentration of expression antigen in roots than in leaf tissues and was not sufficient to be used for oral vaccine (Domansky, 1995) . Further research was carried out to increase HBSAg levels using different promoters, e.g., patatin promoter and different transcriptional regulatory elements (Geetika and Sanjana, 2014) . Artnzen and colleagues investigated a number of signaling peptides and 5 0 and 3 0 untranslated regions in constructs driven by normally constitutive CaMV 35s promoter to develop transgenic potato with higher levels of HBSAg antigen (Artnzen, 1997) . When HBSAg expressed in tobacco plant was administered to animals as parental vaccine, it showed primary response equivalent to conventional vaccine. When animals were fed on tobacco plant with HBSAg expression, it showed better results as compared to conventional vaccine.",

For example, tomato plant expressing rabies could induce antibodies in mice. The transgenic potato produced from transgenic plant with CTB gene of Vibrio cholera was found to be very effective in mice. Transgenic potato expressing Norwalk virus antigen has shown seroconversion. Human trials of potato-based hepatitis B virus have shown good results. A study carried out by Mason et al. (1996) investigated the antigenic or immunogenic effects of transgenic potato tubers and tobacco leaves, carrying a Norwalk virus capsid protein; in mice, this virus causes gastroenteritis in human. A successful expression of antigens in plants was achieved for rabies virus G-protein in tomato (McGarvey et al., 1995) . Rotavirus VP7 has been expressed in transgenic plants, and oral immunization in mice was observed by inducing the production of mucosal IgA and serum IgG against VP7 (Wu et al., 2003) . The development of systemic and mucosal antibody response was observed in response to LT-B in young and aged mice. The expression of a recombinant subunit antigen (ORF2), representing the carboxy-terminal 267 amino acids of the 660 amino acid hepatitis E virus (HEV) capsid protein of HEV was studied in tomatoes, and activity of protein or expressed antigen was tested using enzyme-linked immunosorbant assay method (Ma et al., 2003) . In addition, efforts have also been made to develop edible vaccine against neurocysticercosis that occurs due to ingestion of contaminated food and water by Taenia solium (Lightwlers, 2003) . Vaccine against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus has also been developed by scientists and is under study. These examples show that plants are promising bioreactors in generation of therapeutically desired biopharmaceuticals.",

Even more palatable alternatives to potatoes have been developed, e.g., banana. Many solutions have been tried to overcome this limitation. These include techniques such as optimization of the coding sequence of bacterial or viral genes for expression as plant nuclear genes and defining the subcellular components to accumulate the product for optimal quantity and quality.
