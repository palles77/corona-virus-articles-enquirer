            "text": "Clinical trials of gene therapy for cystic fibrosis suggest that current levels of gene transfer efficiency are probably too low to result in clinical benefit, largely as a result of the barriers faced by gene transfer vectors within the airways. The respiratory epithelium has evolved a complex series of extracellular barriers (mucus, lack of receptors, immune surveillance, etc.) aimed at preventing penetration of lumenally delivered materials, including gene therapy vectors. In addition, once in the cell, further hurdles have to be overcome, including DNA degradation, nuclear import and the ability to maintain long-term transgene expression. Strategies to overcome these barriers will be addressed in this review and include the use of: (i) clinically relevant adjuncts to overcome the extra-and intracellular barriers; (ii) less-conventional delivery routes, such as intravenous or in utero administration; (iii) more efficient non-viral vectors and 'stealth' viruses which can be readministered; and (iv) new approaches to prolong transgene expression by means of alternative promoters or integrating vectors. These advances have the potential to improve the efficiency of gene delivery to the airway epithelium, thus making gene therapy a more realistic option for cystic fibrosis. \uf6d9",

In utero gene transfer A very recent technology developed by Mitchell and collaborators takes advantage of the cell's Because of the hurdles and barriers involved with endogenous splicing machinery as a strategy for conventional gene transfer, several groups have modifying pre-mRNA. The SMaRT process uses begun to look into in utero gene delivery as a new pre-therapeutic RNA molecules (PTMs) that are way potentially to increase the efficacy and duration designed to base pair with the intron of a targeted of transgene expression. CF is a particularly inviting pre-mRNA to suppress target cis-splicing while target disease for the development of in utero gene enhancing trans-splicing between the PTM and therapy because amniotic fluid circulation provides target. The aim is to repair mutant pre-mRNA vector exposure to pulmonary, gastrointestinal and molecules and generate full length repaired mRNA sinus epithelia, all primary sites of CF pathology. that is translated and processed into mature CFTR Viral vector introduced into amniotic fluid of mice, protein [126] .

Most of these studies have been physiological expression of CFTR, as previously carried out with adenoviral vectors, and many have discussed. Furthermore, as PTM expression cassettes led to substantial inflammation and subsequent foetal can be much smaller than those encoding full-length loss. Fewer adverse events have been observed when cDNAs, SMaRT also allows for the use of smaller AAV is used. Retroviral vector use for applications and less immunogenic vectors, such as rAAV with in utero has been limited because the amniotic fluid limited packaging capacity.
