            "text": "Interferon-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM) 1, 2 and 3 genes encode a family of interferon (IFN)-induced transmembrane proteins that block entry of a broad spectrum of pathogens. However, the transcriptional regulation of these genes, especially whether there exist any enhancers and their roles during the IFN induction process remain elusive. Here, through public data mining, episomal luciferase reporter assay and in vivo CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, we identified an IFN-responsive enhancer located 35 kb upstream of IFITM3 gene promoter upregulating the IFN-induced expression of IFITM1, 2 and 3 genes. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and luciferase reporter assay demonstrated that signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) 1 bound to the enhancer with the treatment of IFN and was indispensable for the enhancer activity. Furthermore, using chromosome conformation capture technique, we revealed that the IFITM1, 2 and 3 genes physically clustered together and constitutively looped to the distal enhancer through long-range interactions in both HEK293 and A549 cells, providing structural basis for coordinated regulation of IFITM1, 2 and 3 by the enhancer. Finally, we showed that in vivo truncation of the enhancer impaired IFN-induced resistance to influenza A virus (IAV) infection. These findings expand our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the transcriptional regulation of IFITM1, 2 and 3 expression and its ability to mediate IFN signaling.",

A number of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) activated by IFN mediate virus-inhibiting function at all stages of virus life cycle [2] . Among these, interferon-induced transmembrane (IFITM) 1, 2 and 3, a cluster of genes encoding membrane proteins, inhibit the fusion of viral envelope with endosomal membrane [3] , and are therefore responsible for limiting infection by many kinds of viruses including influenza A virus (IAV), West Nile virus, Dengue virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [4] [5] [6] [7] . Additionally, polymorphisms within IFITM genes might lead to differences in host susceptibility to viruses. Specifically, several laboratories demonstrated that the IFITM3 coding region genetic variant rs12252-C which is supposed to alter a splice acceptor site is associated with higher susceptibility to IAV [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

They are expressed basally in primary tissues and cell lines [12] and robustly induced by either type I or type II IFNs [13] . Both Type I and type II IFNs activate ISGs through Janus kinase (JAK)-STAT pathway. The difference is type I IFNs, such as IFN\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2, induce gene expression by the combinatorial binding of transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9), phosphorylated STAT1 and 2 to IFN-stimulated response elements (ISREs) within the target gene promoter, while type II IFN, IFN\u03b3, exerts its regulation through the induced binding of phosphorylated STAT1 homodimers to the gammaactivated sequence (GAS) [14] . Chromatin-remodeling factor BRG1 is also essential for IFITM1, 2 and 3 gene expressions [15, 16] , as it constitutively binds to the promoters of IFITM1, 2 and 3 genes and remodels the chromatin to make the promoters accessible to STAT1/ STAT1/IRF9 transcription factor complex and transcription machinery [17] . Sp1 and TEF-1 are reported to be involved in recruiting BRG1 to the promoter of IFITM3 gene [16, 18] .",

These six loci and a negative control locus named as \"R\" outside these fragments were amplified and cloned upstream the luciferase promoter in pGL3promoter constructs respectively.

We found that both E1-2 and E2-3 displayed enhancer activity (Fig. 1B) . However, upon treatment of IFN\u03b2, the enhancer activity of E1-2 did not change whereas the enhancer activity of E2-3 was greatly elevated (Fig. 1B) , suggesting E1-2 element was a constitutive enhancer while E2-3 element was an IFN\u03b2-responsive enhancer. Similar results were also confirmed in A549 cells (Fig. 1C ).

Then we measured mRNA expression levels of IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 in the mutant and corresponding wild-type control HEK293 cells treated with IFN\u03b2 or PBS. Expectedly, we found that IFN\u03b2-induction of IFITM1, 2 and 3 was significantly impaired in the mutant cells (Fig. 2C) . This was further validated at the protein level as assessed by western blot (Figs. 2D and S1 ). By contrast, for the E2-3\u2032s nearest gene B4GALNT4 gene, neither its basal expression nor induction by IFN\u03b2 could be detected in our experiments (Fig. 2C) . Similar results were also observed when cells were treated with IFN\u03b1 (Fig. S2) , suggesting that IFITM1, 2 and 3, but not B4GALNT4 are bona fide targets of enhancer E2-3. In addition, whether IFN\u03b2 treatment or not, no difference was observed in the levels of STAT1 and phosphorylated STAT1 (P-STAT1) between the mutant and corresponding wildtype control HEK293 cells (Fig. S3) , ruling out the possibility that impaired induction of IFITM1, 2 and 3 by IFN in mutant HEK293 cells was due to disruption of JAK-STAT pathway by CRISPR off-target effect.",

We further proved that this interaction was specific, as STAT1 motif mutant DNA could not compete the binding probe to nuclear proteins (Fig. 3D) . Moreover, when antibody against STAT1 was added into the nuclear extract, the shift band was remarkably reduced and a weak supershift band appeared above it (Fig. 3E) .

Recent reports have showed that distal enhancers could form long-range interactions with the promoters of the targeted genes to exert its function [26] . To investigate whether Pol II ChIA-PET interactions, DNaseI hypersensitivity clusters, H3K4Me1 marks, H3K27Ac marks, transcription factor ChIP-seq data of P300, STAT1 and STAT2, and conservation are displayed. (B) Six fragments, all contained in the two regions interacting with IFITM locus, was used to enhance expression of an SV40 promoter-driven Firefly luciferase reporter gene vector (pGL3-promoter). R fragment, outside the two interacting region, was used as a negative control. Following transient co-transfection, HEK293 cells were treated with PBS or 1000 U/mL IFN\u03b2 for 24 h before collected. Results are displayed as ratios of Firefly to SV40 promoter-driven Renilla luciferase activities from three independent experiments. Statistical analyses were performed with unpaired Student's t-tests (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001). (C) Same as (B) except A549 cells was transfected. enhancer E2-3 also behaved like this, we performed chromosome conformation capture (3C) assay in HEK293 cells [25] . Using enhancer E2-3 as anchor, we observed E2-3 looping to the promoters of IFITM1, 2 and 3. When cells were treated with IFN\u03b2, the interaction frequency increased, in accordance with the elevated expression of IFITM1, 2 and 3 (Fig. 4A) .To further validate this result, we also performed 3C assay using IFITM1, IFITM2 or IFITM3 locus as anchor respectively, and as expected, all of 3C data showed that E2-3 could interact with IFITM1, IFITM2 or IFITM3 especially when treated with IFN\u03b2 (Figs. S3-S5 ). In addition, we observed the interactions among the promoters of IFITM1, 2 and 3 (Figs.

Combining public ENCODE data mining, luciferase reporter assay and genome editing by CRISPR-Cas9, we identified an IFN-responsive enhancer located 35 kb upstream of IFITM3 gene promoter regulating the expression of IFITM1, 2 and 3 genes, thus providing the first evidence that enhancers play an important role in transcriptional regulation of these IFITM genes.",

            "text": "Notably, this single enhancer E2-3 could simultaneously enhance the expression of three clustered genes in the IFITM locus, suggesting it might act like a locus control region (LCR), as in the \u03b1-globin and \u03b2globin loci [32, 33] . We also noticed that the induction of IFITM1, 2 and 3 was not completely disrupted by truncation of enhancer E2-3. Two possible explanations may be proposed: firstly, enhancer E2-3 was only truncated, not completely deleted. The residual E2-3 might still have an effect. Indeed, luciferase reporter assay indicated that the truncated E2-3 still had a minor enhancer activity under IFN treatment conditions. Secondly, given the nature of complicated chromatin interaction and regulation network in eukaryotic genomes, many studies have shown that genes could be regulated by multiple enhancers [34] [35] [36] . Therefore, it's possible that there are other redundant enhancers like E1-2, which was also identified as an enhancer in our luciferase reporter assay screening, controlling the expression of IFITM genes. After all, truncation of enhancer E2-3 decreased IFN\u03b2-induced resistance to IAV infection, highlighting its biological importance. STAT1 binds to the promoters of ISGs to activate gene expression in both type I and type II IFN induction [14] . However, previous ChIP-chip or ChIP-seq data indicated that only a small fraction (< 30%) of STAT1 binding sites were within 1 kb of transcriptional start sites (TSSs) [37] [38] [39] . The function of the large numbers of distal STAT1 binding sites remains unknown. Here we showed that STAT1 binding to the enhancer E2-3, which was located > 35 kb away from its target genes, was indispensable for its IFN-responsive enhancer activity. We therefore speculate that a similar enhancer function may also exist in other distal STAT1 binding sites. In addition to STAT1, STAT2 might also be involved in the regulation of IFITMs by enhancer E2-3, because STAT2 is also suggested to bind to E2-3 in IFN\u03b1-treated K562 cells, as inferred from ENCODE STAT2 ChIP-seq data. It's quite interesting that the promoters of IFITM genes already contain the binding sites for STAT1 or STAT2 while there still exists an enhancer mediating IFN/STAT signaling. A reasonable explanation might be that the distal enhancer could fine tune the expression of these important genes and thus add robust and plastic response to virus invasion and IFN stimulation. Besides the IFITM gene cluster, it has been previously reported that many other genes such as IFN\u03b2 gene [40, 41] and STAT1 gene [42] also behave like this, suggesting a general transcriptional regulation on eukaryotic gene expression.",

            "text": "Circumstantial evidence indicates that distal enhancers regulate gene expression through formation of physical chromatin loops [26] . Consistent with transcriptional regulation of IFITM1, 2 and 3 by the remote enhancer E2-3, we did observe long-range interactions between enhancer E2-3 and promoters of IFITM1, 2 and 3 using 3C assays in HEK293 and A549 cells. Notably, the promoters of IFITM1, 2 and 3 also clustered together physically in three dimensions to form some kind of active chromatin hub [43] , which might facilitate coordinated regula- tion of enhancer E2-3. Moreover, these interactions or active chromatin hub already existed before treatment of IFN. This may be beneficial to rapid induction of gene expression, thus timely restricting the infection of viruses. Such pre-formed promoter-enhancer interactions have been widely reported in many biological processes like TNF\u03b1 response, development and hypoxia [35, 44, 45] . Specifically, upon truncation of E2-3, the truncated E2-3 still interacted with the promoters of IFITM1, 2 and 3. A recent paper about a distal enhancer regulating PAG1 gene also reported a similar phenomenon [46] . It's possible that the driving force looping E2-3 to IFITM gene cluster might not be disrupted upon truncation of E2-3, suggesting roles of architectural factors residing outside E2-3, possibly CTCF and cohesin [47] . At last, considering the growing reports that one enhancer could contact and regulate multiple related genes, some of which are even on different chromosomes [34, 35, 45, 48, 49] , we are open that E2-3 might also be able to associate with and regulate other ISGs in addition to IFITMs. These possibilities of course call for extensive efforts to examine in the future.",
