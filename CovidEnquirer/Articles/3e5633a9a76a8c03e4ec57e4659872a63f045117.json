Here, the Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, which is responsible for developing the official classification of viruses and taxa naming (taxonomy) of the Coronaviridae family, assessed the novelty of the human pathogen tentatively named 2019-nCoV. Based on phylogeny, taxonomy and established practice, the CSG formally recognizes this virus as a sister to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus and designates it as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). To facilitate communication, the CSG further proposes to use the following naming convention for individual isolates: SARS-CoV-2/Isolate/Host/Date/Location. The spectrum of clinical manifestations associated with SARS-CoV-2 infections in humans remains to be determined. The independent zoonotic transmission of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 highlights the need for studying the entire (virus) species to complement research focused on individual pathogenic viruses of immediate significance. This research will improve our understanding of virus-host interactions in an ever-changing environment and enhance our preparedness for future outbreaks. : bioRxiv preprint Defining novelty and the place of SARS-CoV-2 within the taxonomy of the Coronaviridae family During the 21 st century, researchers studying coronaviruses -a family of enveloped positivestranded RNA viruses of vertebrates 8 -were confronted several times with the question of coronavirus novelty, including two times when a severe or even life-threatening disease was introduced into humans from a zoonotic reservoir: this happened with severe acute respiratory",

            "text": "The questions of virus novelty and naming are now posed in relation to a coronavirus causing an outbreak of a respiratory syndrome that was first detected in Wuhan, China, December 2019. It was temporally named 2019 novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV. The term \"novel\" may refer to the disease (or spectrum of clinical manifestations) that is caused in humans infected by this particular virus, which, however, is only emerging and requires further studies 1,2 . The term \"novel\" in the name of 2019-nCoV may also refer to an incomplete match between the genomes of this and other (previously known) coronaviruses, if the latter was considered an appropriate criterion for defining \"novelty\". However, virologists agree that neither the disease nor the host range can be used to reliably ascertain virus novelty (or identity), since few genome changes may attenuate a deadly virus or cause a host switch 3 . Likewise, we know that RNA viruses persist as a swarm of co-evolving closely related entities (variants of a defined sequence, haplotypes), known as quasispecies 4, 5 . Their genome sequence is a consensus snapshot of a constantly evolving cooperative population in vivo and may vary within a single infected person 6 and over time in an outbreak 7 . If the strict match criterion of novelty was to be applied to RNA viruses, it would have qualified every virus with a sequenced genome as a novel virus, which makes this criterion poorly informative. To get around the potential problem, virologists instead may regard two viruses with non-identical but similar genome sequences as variants of the same virus; this immediately poses the question of how much difference is large enough to recognize the candidate virus as novel or distinct? This question is answered in best practice by evaluating the degree of relatedness of the candidate virus to previously known viruses of the same host or established monophyletic groups of viruses, often known as genotypes or clades, which may or may not include viruses of different hosts. This is formally addressed in the framework of virus taxonomy (Box 2).",

Thus, SARS-CoV-Urbani with a particular genome sequence 20 could be regarded as equivalent to a single human being, while the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus would be on a par with the species Homo sapiens.

Distance estimates between SARS-CoV-2 and the most closely related coronaviruses vary among different studies, depending on the choice of measure (nucleotide or amino acid) and genome region. Accordingly, researchers are split about the exact taxonomic position of 2019-nCoV (i.e., SARS-CoV-2). When we included SARS-CoV-2 in the dataset, including 2505 coronaviruses and used for the most recent update (May 2019) of the coronavirus taxonomy that is currently being considered by ICTV 18 , the species composition was not affected and the virus was assigned to the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus, as detailed below. The species demarcation threshold/limit in the family Coronaviridae is defined/imposed by viruses whose PPD may cross the inter-species demarcation threshold. Due to their minute share of ~10 -4 of the total number of all intra-and inter-species PPDs, they may not even be visually recognized in a conventional diagonal plot clustering viruses on species basis (Fig. 3A) . Furthermore, these violators do not involve any virus of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus species, as evident from the analysis of maximal intraspecies PPDs of 2505 viruses of all 49 coronavirus species (Fig. 3B) and PDs of 256 viruses of this species (Fig. 4) . Thus, the genomic variation of the known viruses of this species is smaller compared to that of other comparably well sampled species, e.g. those prototyped by MERS-CoV, HCoV-OC43 and IBV (Fig. 3B) , and this species is well separated from other known coronavirus species in the sequence space. Both these characteristics of the species Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus facilitate the unambiguous species assignment of SARS-CoV-2 to this species.",

These relationships stand in contrast to the shallow branching of the most populous lineage of this species which includes all the human SARS-CoV isolates collected during the 2002-2003 outbreak and the closely related bat viruses of Asian origin identified in the search for the potential zoonotic source of that epidemic 28 . (Note that this clade structure is susceptible to homologous recombination, which is common in this species 29 28,30 ; to formalize clade definition, it must be revisited after the virus sampling of the deep branches was improved sufficiently). The current sampling defines a very small median PD for human SARS-CoVs, which is approximately 15 times smaller than the median PD determined for SARS-CoV-2 (0.16% vs 2.6%, Fig. 4 ). This small median PD of human SARS-CoVs also dominates the species-wide PD distribution (0.25%, Fig. 4) .

Due to being first, these viruses and their taxa were assigned new names whose origins reflected the practice and the state of virus taxonomy at the respective times ( Fig. 5B ) (Box 4). Neither of these circumstances are applicable to SARS-CoV-2, which is assigned to an existing species of hundreds of known viruses predominantly isolated from humans and diverse bats. All these viruses have names derived from SARS-CoV (directly or through the species name), even though only the human isolates collected during the 2002-2003 outbreak have been confirmed to cause SARS in infected individuals. Thus, the reference to SARS in all these virus names (combined with the use of specific prefixes, suffixes and/or genome sequence IDs in public databases) acknowledges the phylogenetic grouping of the respective virus with viruses isolated from SARS patients, for example SARS-CoV-Urbani, rather than linking this virus to a specific disease (i.e., SARS) in humans. Based on the established practice of virus naming in this species and the relatively distant relationship of SARS-CoV-2 to the prototype SARS-CoV in a species tree and the distance space (Figs. 2B, and 4), the CSG renames 2019-nCoV to SARS-CoV-2.",

Our understanding of these pathogens could be significantly advanced if both viruses were characterized along with viruses of other origins, known and yet-to-be discovered 25 , as part of the Severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus species, with the long-term goal of comprehending the biology and evolution of that species, as is the norm elsewhere in biology.

This necessary adjustment may be facilitated by the major revision of the virus species nomenclature that is currently being discussed by ICTV and planned to be implemented in the near future 33 .

Thus, the genome sequence is the only characteristic that is known for the vast majority of viruses, and its use in defining virus identity in the virosphere is the only available choice going forward. In this framework, a virus is defined by its genome sequence that instructs the synthesis of polynucleotide molecules capable of autonomous replication inside cells and dissemination between cells or organisms under appropriate conditions.

If a candidate virus clusters within a group of isolates, it is a variant of this group and, in other words, may be considered a known virus. On the other hand, if the candidate virus is outside of known groups and its distances to viruses of these groups are comparable to those observed between viruses of different groups (intergroup distances), the candidate virus is distinct and could be considered novel. Commonly this evaluation is conducted in silico using phylogenetic analysis that may be complicated by uneven rates of evolution that vary across different virus lineages and genomic sites due to mutation, including exchange of genome regions in closely related viruses (homologous recombination). Comparative genomics forms also the basis for PCR assays that are suitable to detect established viruses and their groups in vitro. If such PCRs do not recognize the candidate virus, it may be considered novel. There are two caveats to the above approaches. Since the current sampling of viruses is small and highly biased toward viruses of significant medical and economic interest, the group composition varies tremendously among different viruses, making decisions on novelty group-specific and dependent on the choice of specific criteria selected by .

To decide on virus novelty, taxonomists use the results of different analyses, although comparative sequence analysis plays an increasing role and is now the primary tool in the classification of coronaviruses (Box 3). Taxonomical classification is hierarchical, using nested groups (taxa) that populate different levels (ranks) of classification. Taxa of different ranks differ in respect to intrataxon pairwise divergence, which increases from the smallest at the species rank to the largest at the realm rank. They may also be distinguished by taxon-specific markers that characterize natural groupings. When classifying a virus, researchers are required to define and name taxa only on the species and genus ranks while filling other ranks is optional. Thus, species is the smallest and mandatory unit of virus taxonomy. Only if a virus prototypes a new species, it will be regarded as truly novel, taxonomy-wise. Within this framework, a virus that crosses a host barrier and acquires novel properties remains part of the original species. This association may persist even after the virus established a permanent circulation in the new host, as it likely happened with coronaviruses of four species circulating in humans (reviewed in 38 ).",

This exceptional treatment of viruses is a by-product of the historical perception of viruses as a feature of the diseases they cause (Box 1) and the way we usually catalogue and classify newly discovered viruses, rather than an expression of appreciation of virus individuality. Apart from disease, also geography and the organism a given virus was isolated from dominate the name vocabulary, occasionally engraving connections that may be accidental (rather than typical) to the virus in nature. Virus naming is linked to the recognition of virus novelty (Box 2), which is not formally regulated; and no national or global authorities have been established to certify virus novelty and approve virus names. Thus, it is mainly up to virus discoverers or other researchers to decide on these matters, and it is not uncommon to see two variants of the same virus having very different names, if they were described by different researchers.",

            "text": "One of the priorities of the World Health Organization (WHO), an agency of the United Nations, is concerned with communicable diseases, including the coordination of international public health activities aimed at containing (and mitigating the consequences of) major virus epidemics. WHO also considers virus novelty and has responsibility in naming the disease(s) caused by newly emerging human viruses. By doing so, WHO often takes the traditional approach of linking viruses to specific diseases (Box 1) and assessing novelty by an apparent failure to detect the causative agent by established diagnostic assays. Formally, ICTV was involved in virus naming only until the grouping of the most closely related viruses into clusters (taxa species) was introduced and their nomenclature in the taxonomy established 45 . Since then, the specialized Study Groups have been involved in virus naming only on a case-by-case basis as an extension of their official remit and using the special expertise of their members. However, since the study groups are responsible for assigning viruses to virus species, they could play an important role in advancing the species concept (which is yet to be fully appreciated) to the research community and others, who may be uncertain about its significance 21 . The CSG adopts the DEmARC-based approach to define virus species (Box 3). Practically, virus species are often ignored or confused with viruses that are part of the respective species. This problem may be alleviated by strictly adhering to established rules for the naming of species and viruses in that species 33 .
