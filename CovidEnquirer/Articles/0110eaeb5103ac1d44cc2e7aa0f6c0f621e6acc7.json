An experimental BRSV infection model was used to study the pathogenesis of the disease in calves. Broncho alveolar lung lavage (BAL) was performed on 28 Jersey calves, of which 23 were experimentally infected with BRSV and \u00aeve were given a mock inoculum. The presence of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor a (TNF-a) in the BAL\u00afuids was detected and quanti\u00aeed by a capture ELISA. TNF-a was detected in 21 of the infected animals. The amount of TNF-a in the BAL\u00afuid of calves killed post inoculation day (PID) 2 and 4 was at the same very low level as in the uninfected control animals. Large amounts of TNF-a were detected on PID 6, maximum levels of TNF-a were reached on PID 7, and smaller amounts of TNF-a were seen on PID 8. The high levels of TNF-a appeared on the days where severe lung lesions and clinical signs were obvious and the amounts of BRSV-antigen were at their greatest. Although Pasteurellaceae were isolated from some of the BRSV-infected calves, calves treated with antibiotics before and through the whole period of the infection, as well as BRSV-infected calves free of bacteria reached the same level of TNF-a as animals from which bacteria were isolated from the lungs. It is concluded that signi\u00aecant quantities of TNF-a are produced in the lungs of the calves Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 76 (2000) 199\u00b1214",

Interstitial edema may be seen in all lobes, whereas emphysema typically is located in the diaphragmatic lobes (Kimman et al., 1989; Bryson, 1993) . Microscopic \u00aendings consist of epithelial lesions in the bronchi, bronchioles and alveoli, which are \u00aelled or in\u00aeltrated with neutrophils and macrophages. Frequently, multinuclear syncytia as well as hyaline membranes can be found. Also, evidence of bronchiolar repair including epithelial hyperplasia and organisation of exudate are observed fairly early in the course of the infection (Kimman et al., 1989; Bryson, 1993) . Immunostainings performed on lung tissue indicate that BRSV are located in the cranioventral lobes in most cases, and rarely in the caudal parts of the diaphragmatic lobes (Kimman et al., 1989; Ellis et al., 1996; Viuff et al., 1996) . The similarity of the clinical signs and pathology appearing in BRSVinfected calves and HRSV-infected infants is noticeable (Baker, 1991) . Hence, studies of BRSV-infections in calves also contribute valuable information to the disease in infants. Today, the available treatments and prophylactic precautions against the diseases are far from optimal. In fact, a vaccine against HRSV is still not available for children (Collins et al., 1996) . Therefore, a great effort has been made to study the immune response and pathogenesis of the viral infection in ruminants (Kimman, 1993; Belknap et al., 1995) .",

Moreover, the importance of different subpopulations of leukocytes in the lung during infection has been investigated (Kimman, 1993; Taylor et al., 1995) . In particular, alveolar macrophages (AM), which phagocytise pathogens and secrete in\u00afammatory and immunoregulatory cytokines, have attracted attention. Human or murine AM infected with HRSV in vitro produce large amounts of the cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) (Panuska et al., 1990; Becker et al., 1991) . Today, accumulating data from in vivo investigations indicate that TNF-a is implicated in the pathogenesis of the disease. AM isolated from infants suffering from an acute RSV infection have been found to express TNF-a protein in a cell-associated manner (Midulla et al., 1993) . Moreover, Matsuda et al. (1995) demonstrated the presence of TNF-a in the nasal discharge from HRSV-infected infants. In the murine HRSV-model, high levels of bioactive TNF-a were found in the lungs and sera of HRSV-infected BALBc mice, post inoculation day (PID) 2 (Hayes et al., 1994) . Additionally, TNF-a has been shown to possess an antiviral effect against HRSV in vitro (Cirino et al., 1993; Merolla et al., 1995) as well as in mice in vivo (Neuzil et al., 1996) . Therefore, the cytokine may also be involved in the immune defense directed against the RSV infection.",

The cytokine has also been shown to be involved in the mechanisms leading to increased permeability of endothelium (Zeck-Kapp et al., 1990) and epithelium in lung in\u00afammations (Li et al., 1995) . Additionally, TNF-a has been shown to inhibit the alveolar type II epithelial cells production of surfactant phospholipid (Arias-Diaz et al., 1993) and surfactant proteins (Wispe et al., 1990; Pryhuber et al., 1996) , a mechanism which has been suggested to contribute to the pathophysiology of adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Arias-Diaz et al., 1993) . Therefore, the biological effects induced by TNF-a could explain the presence of purulent exudate, edema and atelectasis in the BRSV-infected lung.

Compared to other bovine studies (Yoo et al., 1995) , relatively high amounts of TNF-a were detected in the BAL\u00afuids in this study, possibly because cell-associated TNF-a was included, since the BAL-cells were not separated from the lung wash suspensions before they were frozen.",

However, investigations performed by Taylor et al. (1995) indicate that cytotoxic T-lymphocytes could participate in the clearance of BRSV infections. In our study, the calves had few or no maternal antibodies (IgG 1 ) against BRSV when they were inoculated with BRSV and IgM was not detected before PID 8, and only in one calf (data not shown). The presence of cytotoxic Tlymphocytes in the lungs of BRSV-infected calves is currently being investigated within the group.",

In our study, no infectious BRSV could be isolated from the lungs of six out of eight BRSV-infected calves on the same day (PID 7) when TNF-a reached its maximum level in BAL.

This mechanism might play an important role in the RSV-infection since in vitro studies have shown that the TNF-receptor p55 is secreted in large amounts from lung epithelia cells infected with HRSV (Arnold et al., 1994) . Interestingly, a homology was recently discovered between a conserved region in the G-protein of RSV and a domain within the TNF-receptor p55 (Langedijk et al., 1998) . Therefore, one could speculate that RSV has evolved mechanisms by which it is able to interact with TNF-a, and thereby inhibit the antiviral effect of the cytokine. This interference may eventually result in the dramatic levels of TNF-a found in the lung.",
