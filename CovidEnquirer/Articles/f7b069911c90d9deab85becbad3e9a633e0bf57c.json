Available estimates of the case fatality ratio, i.e. the proportion of cases that are fatal (CFR, (6,7)), can be used to estimate the number of cases who would have shown symptoms at the same time as the fatal cases. We developed a model to use CFR alongside other epidemiological factors underpinning disease transmission to infer the likely number of cases in a population from newly reported deaths.",

Intuitively, the CFR provides some information on the number of cases, as it represents the expected number of deaths per case, so that CFR -1 corresponds to the expected number of cases per death. In practice, the number of cases until the first reported death can be drawn from a Geometric distribution with an event probability equal to the CFR. Note that while our approach could in theory use different CFR for each case (to account for different risk groups), our current implementation uses the same CFR for all cases in a simulation. Dates of symptom onset are simulated from the distribution of the time from onset to death, modelled as a discretised Gamma distribution with a mean of 15 days and a standard deviation of 6.9 days (8).",

Optionally, this model can also incorporate heterogeneity in transmissibility using a Negative Binomial distribution instead of Poisson. The serial interval distribution was characterised as a discretised Lognormal distribution with mean 4.7 days and standard deviation 2.9 days (11) . We assume that past cases caused secondary transmissions independently (i.e. are not ancestral to each other), so that simulated cases for each death can be added. This assumption is most likely to be met when reported deaths are close in time. As the time between reported deaths increases, past cases may come from the same epidemic trajectory rather than separate, additive ones, in which case our method would overpredict epidemic size. Further details on model design and parameters values are provided in Supplementary Material.

We ran simulations for a range of plausible values of R (1.5, 2 and 3) and CFR (1%, 2%, 3% and 10%), assuming a single death on the 1st March 2020 (7) . 25,000 epidemic trajectories were simulated for each parameter combination. Simulations for an 'average severity' scenario (7) with R = 2 and CFR = 2% show that by the time a death has occured, hundreds to thousands of cases may have been generated in the affected population ( Figure 1 ). Results vary widely across other parameter settings, and amongst simulations from a given setting (Table 1) , with higher R and lower CFR leading to higher estimates of the numbers of cases. However, a majority of settings give similar results to our 'average' scenario, suggesting that a single death is likely to reflect several hundreds of cases. Results were qualitatively unchanged when incorporating heterogeneity in the model using recent estimates (13), but prediction intervals were wider (Supplementary Material).",

First, our approach only applies to the deaths of patients who have become symptomatic in the location considered, which should usually be the case in places where traveller screening is in place. We also assume constant transmissibility (R) over time, which implies that behaviour change and control measures have not taken place yet, and that there is no depletion of susceptible individuals. Consequently, our method should only be used in the early stages of a new epidemic, where these assumptions are reasonable. Similarly, the assumption that each death reflects independent, additive epidemic trajectories is most likely to hold true early on, when reported deaths are close in time (e.g. no more than a week apart). Used on deaths spanning longer time periods, our approach is likely to overestimate epidemic sizes.",
