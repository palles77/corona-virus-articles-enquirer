            "text": "Methods: We reviewed the case records of patients admitted to the Persahabatan Hospital (RSP), Jakarta, Indonesia, with infl uenza A(H5N1) confi rmed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Results: Twenty-two previously well patients, aged 3 to 47 years (median 24.5 years), were identifi ed. All attended a clinic or hospital after a median of 2 days of illness (range 0-7). Times to fi rst dose of oseltamivir (three died before receiving oseltamivir) were 2 to 12 days (median 7 days), administered mostly (n 5 15) at RSP. Nineteen patients required mechanical ventilation. Deaths numbered 18 (case fatality 5 82%) occurring within hours to 6 days of RSP admission, corresponding to 6 to 16 days of illness. Admission hyperglycemia ( \u0546 140 mg/dL), unrelated to steroids or known underlying diabetes mellitus, and elevated D-dimer levels (0.81-5.2 mg/L, upper limit of normal , 0.5 mg/L) were present in 14/21 (67%) and 20/21 (95%) patients, respectively. Fibrinogen concentrations were mostly low/normal at 129.9 to 517.9 mg/dL (median 241.1, normal 200-400 mg/dL), whereas C-reactive protein (9/11) and ferritin (6/8) levels were increased. Risk factors for death (univariate analysis) included: (1) increased D-dimers, (2) hyperglycema, (3) increased urea, (4) more extensive chest radiograph shadowing, and (5) lower admission oxygen saturation. Conclusions: Early diagnosis and effective treatment of human infl uenza A(H5N1) infection remains challenging. Most patients were referred late with advanced disease. Oseltamivir had limited clinical impact. Elevated D-dimer levels, consistent with fi brinolysis, and hyperglycemia warrant more research to determine their underlying mechanisms and optimal treatment.",

Diagnostic diffi culty at the early (primary care) or later stages (in hospital) of disease coupled with a low index of suspicion leads to diagnostic and antiviral treatment delays. Certainly, the rapid progression to respiratory failure, necessitating early ventilation, should alert clinicians to the possibility of infl uenza A(H5N1) infection. cally, 21 patients were diagnosed with pneumonia and 1 patient had a mild fl ulike illness.",

Hyperglycemia on admission or developing after treatment with steroids has been observed previously in infl uenza A(H5N1) 6,11,23 but has not been identifi ed as a possible poor prognostic factor. By contrast, hyperglycemia was an independent risk factor for increased mortality in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome whether they had diabetes or not. 24 Suboptimal glucose control is associated with a poor prognosis in critically ill patients, often in association with bacterial sepsis, 25 and important parallels may exist between sepsis and infl uenza A(H5N1).

In the Oner et al 26 series, two of their eight patients had ISTH DIC scores of 8 (admission) and 5 (developing later). Published data suggest overt DIC affects a minority of patients with infl uenza A(H5N1) and when present does not usually cause spontaneous bleeding. 11, 12, 26 D-dimer levels in our patients were elevated out of proportion to the PT and aPTT. Concentrations of fi brinogen (an acute-phase protein) were mostly low or normal despite intense infl ammation, a hallmark of severe infl uenza A(H5N1), 8 as evidenced by increased ferritin and CRP levels in most of our patients who had these acute-phase proteins measured. High D-dimer levels and low fi brinogen levels suggest infl uenza A(H5N1) associated fi brinolysis in the absence of DIC.

Of these, only one had mild clinical disease and a normal CXR. Throat swab viral clearance was confi rmed for three patients within 4 days, suggesting sufficient oseltamivir absorption and antiviral effi cacy. 40 By contrast, others have found that continuing infl uenza A(H5N1) replication despite oseltamivir treatment is associated with death. 41 The effi cacy of IVIG is unknown but may have contributed to survival in three of the patients. In China, convalescent serum administered to several infl uenza A(H5N1) patients also appeared benefi cial. 11 Combined immunomodulatory and antiviral drug therapies warrant further research. 42 The primary limitation of our study was the small number of patients, thus restricting statistical power to discern more subtle effects. We also used a somewhat crude classifi cation of the CXR fi ndings by simply classifying the degree of consolidation as . 50% or not and whether consolidation was unilateral or bilateral. Such a system may be helpful to busy clinicians but lacks the fi nesse of other classifi cations. 43 Not all patients were sampled daily for virus detection and no attempts were made to collect specimens to measure oseltamivir concentrations.",
