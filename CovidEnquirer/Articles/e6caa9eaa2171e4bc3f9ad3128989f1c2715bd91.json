Intravitreal injections of [3H]proline were given at regular intervals after virus inoculation, the labelled protein in the superior colliculi was then measured after survival periods of 18 h or 10 days, for fast and slow axonal transport studies, respectively. Fast transport studies showed an enhanced amount of protein arriving at the optic nerve terminals (superior colliculus) of the SFV-infected mice prior to the onset of demyelination. In contrast, the slow transport studies showed an enhanced amount of protein at the superior colliculus of the SFV-infected mice during the demyelination period. There was no concomitant increase in labelled protein in the retina at any time after the SFV infection. It is proposed that alteration in the transport of the protein constituents other than major myelin specific components may cause disruption of myelin maintenance in SFV infection.",

Injections were given slowly over 2 min to prevent a sudden increase in intraocular pressure and a drop of light silicone oil (Dow Corning 200/100 cs) placed on the cornea to help seal the injection site and assist wound repair 4.

For the fast transport study the mice were allowed to survive for 18 h following the intravitreal injections, they were then killed and the injected eye and the brain were rapidly removed and fixed in 10% TCA (trichloracetic acid, BDH Chemicals) for 48 h, after which little unincorporated radioactive label remains in the tissue 12. Tissues were then washed in distilled water for a further 24 h to remove all the TCA and then prepared for liquid scintillation counting (see later).",

The amount of radioactivity was assessed by counting the samples in a 1215 Rakbeta (LKB-WalIac) scintillation counter. Corrections were applied for the volume of [3H]proline injected and for quenching using the external standard channels-ratio method 9, the counting efficiency for the samples being of the order of 28-34%. The amount of radioactivity in the retinae was expressed as disintegrations per minute per mg of dried tissue (dpm/mg). For the axonal transport studies, since approximately 97% of optic nerve fibres cross in albino mice 7, the contralateral superior colliculus was considered as the target tissue and the ipsilateral superior colliculus as the control tissue for diffused or bloodborne label.

            "text": "Secondly, the viral specific IgG increase and degree of subsequent demyelination are greater in mice that had received two SFV inoculations than those that received only one inoculation (Illavia and Webb, personal communication). Our observations that the increase in fast axonal transport was much greater in the mice that had two rather than one inoculation of SFV therefore suggests that the increase in the fast axonal transport is related to immunological responses preceding demyelination. On the other hand, since there was no difference in the slow axonal transport between those animals that had one and two inoculations, the change in the slow axonal transport seems to be independent of the immunological responses.",

            "text": "With regard to our question as to whether the increase in axonal transport is due to enhanced uptake and incorporation by precursors by the retina, we found no increase in labelled protein in the retina (measured at 18 h after intravitreal proline injection) at any time after SFV or BAPS inoculation (see Figs. 3 and 5) . It is unlikely that the increased axonal transport has been caused by an increased uptake or incorporation by the retinal ganglion cells. The fact that the retinal protein levels remained the same whilst labelled protein accumulated at the optic nerve terminals, leads us to consider the possibilities of decreased turnover of the protein or less utilization of protein along the optic nerve fibres in SFV-infected mice. There is already evidence that membrane properties of optic nerve fibres are greatly disturbed after SFV infection, as the optic nerve fibres produce abnormally enhanced spontaneous firing, as well as long lasting rhythmic oscillatory bursts after stimulation in SFV-infected mice 31. In addition, SFV is known, from extensive in vitro studies, to affect host cell metabolism and membrane incorporation (e.g. ref. 13) . Therefore altered utilization of protein along the retinal ganglion cell axons would not be surprising. A more detailed study of axonal transport metabolism and energetics following SFV inoculation is awaited. For example, although we already know that the rate of fast and slow axonal transport had not changed at the peak of demyelination 21, we still need to look at whether the transport rates remained constant throughout after SFV inoculation.",

            "text": "Finally, an important question remains as to the identity of the compounds of the fast axonal transport changes that precede the demyelination induced by SFV. With specific regard to myelin constituents, there is strong evidence for the transfer of lipid material from axon to myelin in the CNS s, although studies on protein transfer have yielded more equivocal results. Several authors ~\u00b0'1~ have isolated both fast and slow axonally transported protein with myelin fractions, and these are identified as high-molecular weight and not the myelin-specific proteins (myelin basic protein, MBP; proteolipid protein, PLP; and DM-20). Since retinal ganglion cells do not synthesize MBP, PLP or DM-20 (ref. 22) , it is likely that protein constituents of myelin other than the major, myelin-specific components are synthesized and transported along the axons of retinal ganglion cells, and that some alteration of this activity could cause disruption of myelin maintenance in SFV infection. Although this view must remain as conjecture, awaiting further studies, we suggest that neuronal changes are of importance in the study of demyelinating disease.",
