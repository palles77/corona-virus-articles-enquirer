The USEPA has defined a list of 126 toxic organic and inorganic chemicals that appear as specific limitations in discharge permits. These are identified as priority pollutants and can be found on the USEPA website www.epa.gov. Volatile organic chemicals (VOCs) such as benzene and toluene may result in public health problems and must be controlled under Clean Air Act legislation. The refractory organics are of particular concern because of the potential long-term cumulative effects of these materials in drinking water and the food chain. The Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) also requires the USEPA to list unregulated contaminants that are known or anticipated to occur in public water systems and may require regulation in the future. This list is called the Contaminant Candidate List (CCL) and is updated every five years and can be found on the USEPA website. The EPA uses the CCL to prioritize research efforts in order to make informed regulatory decisions about specific chemicals. The agency determines whether or not to regulate at least five chemicals on the CCL with each publication cycle. Newer organic pollutants, such as pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs) and endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), have received increasing attention over the last decade. This is because of their wide distribution in surface waters, groundwater, and wastewater effluents, and their effects on the development of a variety of aquatic species, the development of antibiotic resistant pathogens, and possible effects on human health. Regulations for a number of these newer pollutants are currently being evaluated by the EPA. Some are currently banned in the United States and the European Union.",

            "text": "Physical pollutants include color, turbidity, temperature, suspended solids, foam, and radioactivity. Although color is not necessarily harmful, it may be aesthetically unacceptable for drinking water and some industrial uses. Color is often caused by organic colloids, thus making its removal expensive. Color may be the result of natural decay of vegetative organics such as fluvic and humic acids. These can react with free chlorine to form Trihalomethanes (THMs) which are of public health concern in drinking waters. Temperature is an important factor in biological activity and significantly affects chemical, biological, and physical reactions. It may also act synergistically with toxic materials, for example, heavy metal toxicity increases with increasing temperature. Turbidity is caused by colloidal material and/or suspended solids, and its removal requires coagulation and filtration. Suspended solids, which may cause turbidity, can result from wastewater discharges or from natural processes, such as erosion. This may inhibit photosynthesis by reducing light penetration, decrease benthic organism activity by covering the water bottom with sediment, and interfere with fish activity by clogging their gills. Solids may be organic or inorganic. Dissolved solids tend to increase in concentration with reuse. In most cases these are difficult and expensive to remove. Foam resulting from surface active agents may cause aesthetic problems, but developments by the detergent industry have minimized these effects. Surface active agents also may cause a reduction in the rate of oxygen gas transfer into the water. Radioactivity may be the result of fallout, natural sources, or waste discharges and can be incorporated into sludges or biological life or dissolved in the water. Because of the unique effects of radioactive substances, they must be controlled at the source.",

Sludges are particularly troublesome because of their high water content, concomitant large volumes, and concentration of heavy metals, viruses, protozoa, and other constituents capable of causing environmental and public health harm. Costs of treatment may be one-half or more of that of the aqueous waste stream. Many of the processes mentioned in the preceding paragraphs produce solids. Solids from primary and secondary clarifiers must be effectively managed. Residual solids usually undergo a series of treatment steps involving thickening, dewatering, and final disposition or reuse. Organic sludge may also require stabilization prior to final disposal. Stabilization may be achieved by digestion [aerobic or anaerobic (no oxygen present)], lime stabilization, or by other means. Sludge thickening is typically accomplished by gravity, flotation, or centrifugation methods. Centrifuges, belt filters, and filter presses are dewatering options. The selection of unit processes and their sequence will depend primarily on the characteristics and volume of the sludge and on the final disposition or reuse option selected.",

Primary clarification also acts as a barrier for oil and grease to prevent operational problems during subsequent treatment. Since solids will be collected at the bottom of the settling tank, provision must be made for their removal. This is usually accomplished by utilizing a continuous belt device as shown in Figure 3 . The solids (sludge) are then pumped from the sludge hopper to a sludge digester or other sludge treatment unit process. Note that the secondary sedimentation tank follows biological treatment. As shown in Figure 3 , it differs from the primary tank because the provision for scum removal will generally not be required. Additionally, in place of a belt conveyor, a vacuum draw-off is often employed to remove solids quickly for activated sludge applications. It should be noted that chemicals are sometimes added prior to settling to enhance solids removal. The efficiency of solids removal for both primary and secondary clarification is a function of the overflow rate (gal ft \u00c02 day) which is essentially the velocity of the liquid exiting the tank.

Thus, part of the energy may be utilized in reproducing new bacterial cells and the rest of the energy used in converting waste products to carbon dioxide and water. If the food supply becomes meager, the bacteria will eat themselves and bacterial cells will be converted into end products. This process, when the food-to-microorganism ratio is low is called endogenous respiration. It can also be seen from Figure. 4 that part of the waste material will be non-biodegradable. This is the residue of the waste material that will not be removed, either as cell material or as non-biodegradable residues produced during metabolism termed soluble microbial products (SMPs). The endogenous respiration process is analogous to a starving human who uses his own tissue to provide energy to sustain life processes. Note that SMPs are also generated during synthesis. Figure 5 schematically demonstrates a complete-mix biological wastewater treatment process, where Q is the flow volume, S is the concentration of organics (substrate), V is the volume of the tank, M is the mass of microorganisms in the tank, s is the concentration of organics in the tank, and R is the fraction of return flow. The mass of microorganisms per day wasted divided into the inventory of microbes in the reactor is termed the sludge age or mean cell residence time (MCRT). This is used for system control to maintain a desired physiology of the biomass present. The required time for stabilization for industrial wastewaters, which are often soluble, is usually longer than that required for municipal wastewaters and will vary depending on the complexity of the waste.

Typically, air is introduced, either in the form of bubbles through diffusers or by turbulent agitation of the liquid by an impeller. In some cases pure oxygen is used in place of air.

Retention times may be 24 h or longer for extended aeration package plants. With the activated sludge process, it is possible to obtain removals of BOD on the order of 95% or greater with a higher quality effluent than with most other biological oxidation processes. Many modifications of the activated sludge process exist, including a high-rate process where the food to-microorganism ratio is high, thus producing more sludge, typically used for pretreatment; a step-aeration process, where the influent is added at intervals along the aeration tank; tapered aeration, where the introduction of air is varied along the length of the tank, the higher concentration being at the influent point of the tank; and the contact stabilization process, where a portion of the sludge is aerated separately, thus adding flexibility to the process. Most conventional activated sludge basins treating municipal wastewaters are designed for plug flow to minimize hydraulic retention time and optimize settling properties of the floc. In a true plug flow unit all particles entering the reactor stay for an equal amount of time. This of course is not possible in practice. However, plug flow can be approached by dividing the aeration tank into a series of reactors. With complete-mix reactors the incoming wastewater is completely mixed with the reactor contents upon entry. Because of its ability to absorb shock loadings and reduce toxic/inhibitory constituents by dilution to below threshold levels it is often used for treating industrial wastewaters.

            "text": "As previously mentioned, the trickling filtration process is similar to the activated sludge process, except that the microorganisms working to stabilize the organic waste material are attached to a fixed bed rather than being suspended. Following pretreatment and sedimentation the wastewater is distributed from rotary nozzles over the bed, which usually consists of coarse, rough, hard material that gives support to the biological film. The organics in the wastewater are oxidized after assimilation by the bacteria. Periodically, the film will become so thick that it can no longer be supported on the medium and will slough off and be discharged into the effluent from the filter. This sludge will then go to the secondary settling tank and be removed with that from the primary settling tank. The trickling filtration process is said to be advantageous because it can provide good performance with a minimum of skilled operator attention and use less energy. However, the process is highly temperature dependent and will not always perform in accord with the requirements of present-day regulatory agencies. Other variables affecting performance include the organic and hydraulic loading rates and the biodegradability of the wastewater. While effluent quality is less than that from the activated sludge process, quality can be enhanced by following the trickling filter with a biological contactor. The contactor is usually designed for a retention time of 15 min and a solids content similar to that maintained in the activated sludge process. For the treatment of industrial wastewaters, a trickling filter is considered a pretreatment process usually designed to remove approximately 50% of the BOD. Note that recirculation of the effluent into the influent is commonly practiced to reduce influent organic concentration and maintain a 'wetted' filter growth. Both carbonaceous and nitrogenous oxygen demand can be reduced using trickling filters. Figure 7 is a schematic diagram of a typical 'old style' rock filled trickling filter installation. Oxygen is supplied because of the 'open-air' nature of the filter, and the wastewater is applied to the filter medium via the distributor, which rotates because of the momentum induced by the carrier water. The medium shown is stone, although today filters utilize synthetic media such as PVC, which allows greater depths of filtration and a larger specific surface for microbial growth. Multi-stage filters can be used if needed to comply with more stringent effluent standards. Filters may also be covered and off gases treated to reduce or eliminate odor problems.",

Separation of solids by membrane filtration eliminates the need for secondary sedimentation, and small pore size prevents the discharge of most pathogens. The MBRs can be operated with a longer solids retention time, allowing for more complete oxidation of organics and the maintenance of a population of slow-growing bacteria capable of nutrient, EDC and PPCPs removals and reduced biosolids generation.

Diffused air or surface mechanical aerators are used to provide mixing and oxygen requirements. An aeration time of 10-20 days is usually provided based on temperature. Volatile solids reduction are in the range of 30-50%, with greater than 44% being most desirable. The digested sludge can be disposed of without causing odor or other nuisance conditions. The oxygen required for aerobic digestion can be estimated as 1.4 lb of oxygen consumed for each pound of volatile suspended solids destroyed. Nitrogen and phosphorus will be released by the oxidation process and nitrification will usually occur. As the sludge age is increased in the bioreactor, more of the degradable biomass is oxidized and less will be oxidized in the aerobic digester.

The term 'Exceptional Quality' is often used to describe a biosolids product which meets Class A requirements. The end product must be stable (i.e., no odors, no vector attraction), noninfectious, and of sufficiently low metals content so as not to translocate and bioaccumulate to undesirable levels. Some treatment technologies capable of producing a Class A sludge include composting, heat drying, auto-thermal thermophilic aerobic digestion, pasteurization and gamma radiation. The constraints on the use of sludge for growing edible crops are primarily associated with the presence of heavy metals, the nitrogen content, and the possibility of the presence of phytotoxic materials in the sludge. Particular care must be given if the solids contain contributions from industry. Some metals of concern include arsenic, mercury, lead, zinc, copper, and nickel, although the limiting metal is usually cadmium. Cadmium is of particular concern because of its potential translocation from the soil to the fruit and the ability of certain crops, such as chard, to accumulate significant quantities in the edible portion of the plant. Other metals such as arsenic may also be accumulated in fruit and grain to levels exceeding FDA and other regulatory limits.",

At that point, the unit is backwashed and made ready for another cycle. It should be noted that the diatomaceous earth filtration process was developed during World War II to remove the cysts that cause amoebic dysentery and is presently quite common in swimming pool filtration. Chemical clarification consists of four phases: coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, and filtration. Coagulation, essentially the addition of chemicals that are rapidly mixed with the water, usually involves the use of polymers and/or the oxides of aluminum, iron, or calcium. Once the coagulation step (charge neutralization) is accomplished, the flocculation process then allows aggregation, neutralization, and adsorption of the floc particles. This process is followed by the sedimentation process, where the flocs that have been previously formed are allowed to settle. Although most of the flocculated material will be removed in the sedimentation tank, it is usually required to further remove the floc particles that do not settle by the use of a filtration process that is conducted in beds of porous media such as sand.",

As wastewater containing solids is passed through this type of filter, the solids will accumulate and eventually clog up the openings causing high head loss and/or poor effluent quality. Thus, some provision must be made to remove the collected material. The procedure usually followed is to backwash the sand, that is, to reverse the flow, usually with air scour, so that the sand is suspended and the lighter material is washed away. It should be noted that subsequent to a backwashing operation, the sand will settle according to size and thus become stratified, with the smaller particles at the top. Since these particles will filter out most of the solid material, it may be concluded that the entire depth of a sand bed is not utilized in a filtration process. To alleviate this problem, a multimedia filter is employed, involving different filtration materials, each having a different specific gravity. Materials commonly used are sand, coal, and garnet, as shown in Figure. 16. This type of filter extends the length of the filtration runs and demonstrates high efficiency.

Ultrafiltration or nanofiltration uses pressure to drive a liquid through a membrane permeable to some consituents including fine particles, viruses, bacteria and protozoans. This process is similar to reverse osmosis, but differs with respect to the size of the particles that are separated. Ultrafiltration will generally not retain a particle whose weight is 500-1000 times the molecular weight, and thus it fails to separate inorganic salts. The pressures used in ultrafiltration are on the order of 50 lb/in 2 as contrasted to pressures exceeding 500 lb/in 2 in reverse osmosis.

Since the powdered form is not conducive to column operation, granular activated carbon is used most frequently in advanced wastewater treatment plants. As the wastewater passes through the bed and the constituents from the wastewater are adsorbed onto the carbon, the sites available for adsorption will be exhausted and the bed must be replaced.

The sorption capacity of regenerated carbon however may be reduced as compared to the virgin material. In large plants, regeneration by high temperatures is usually practiced.

The higher valence, higher molecular weight constituents replace the lesser ones. As with adsorption on carbon, if a solution containing an ion to be removed is continuously applied to the ion-exchange medium, the medium will eventually become exhausted. It may then be subjected to a process called regeneration, where the exchange medium is converted back to its original state by passing a concentrated solution of the original replaced ion through it. There are many modifications and combinations of ion-exchange units that have been used in both water and wastewater treatment technology. It should be noted that it is possible to recover material from an ion-exchange unit that might be economically advantageous.

It has become good business practice by many industries and municipalities and the only option to sustain life in small to large communities in many parts of the world. Drivers such as water scarcity and droughts, lack of good quality water supplies, the cost of treating wastewater to very high standards due to more stringent regulations, permitting requirements, public relations, energy conservation, etc. have become strong motivators for industry and communities to look at wastewater as a resource not a waste.",

Perhaps one of the most compelling drivers for water conservation and reuse is the scarcity of water supplies and the uneven distribution of water resources across the globe. The ever increase in population growth will undoubtedly place extreme pressures on the world conventional water supplies (fresh surface water and groundwater) and energy resources required to tap into unconventional supplies (brackish and sea water). In areas such as the Middle East, water scarcity is an everyday concern. In the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, there are virtually no rivers, little precipitation, and limited renewable fresh groundwater supplies. Dependence on desalination is high and is extremely energy intensive and expensive. Water reuse in these countries is an everyday practice. GCC countries lead many others in the world in the reuse of their treated sewage effluent (TSE) for landscape irrigation.",

Before injection, the water was blended 2:1 with well water from a deep non-contaminated aquifer. The water could then flow to the ocean or to augment the potable water supply, or in both directions. The water produced from the treatment plant had no measurable viruses, non-detectable coliform organisms, and an average turbidity of 0.22 TU. Continuing monitoring showed the treatment process removed potential contaminants to non-detect levels for drinking water. Epidemiological studies showed no measurable adverse health effects in the populations ingesting the reclaimed water. It must be recognized that the reclaimed water was diluted with non-contaminated water and had time in the aquifer for natural purification. This facility was recently demolished to make room for a new Groundwater Replenishment (GWR) system. The system opened in 2008 at a cost of $480 million to build and $29 million a year to operate. This enhancement was necessary due to increased population growth, salt water intrusion due to over pumping from the ground water aquifer, the on going chronic drought, and the increased cost of importing water from Northern California. The treatment train consist of filter screens followed by microfiltration. Reverse osmosis is next and the effluent is disinfected using UV light with hydrogen peroxide, About 70 MGD of water is produced. Approximately half filters through the soil into deep aquifers. The rest is injected into the Orange County seawater barrier to prevent ocean seawater intrusion.",

This treatment process consist of screening, grit removal, sedimentation, activated sludge, biological phosphorous removal, chemical treatment, filtration, ion exchange ammonia removal and chlorination for disinfection. A unique system of ammonia removal is employed. A combination of ion exchange using clinoptilolite (a natural ion-exchange medium) in conjunction with an indoor air stripping operation results in the recovery of ammonium sulfate, a fertilizer. The effluent has better water quality than many municipal drinking waters. In spite of the high degree of treatment, the effluent is injected into the groundwater system via a leach field where it eventually finds its way into the Truckee River, which is the major source of water for Reno, Nevada.",
