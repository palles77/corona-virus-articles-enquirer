Surprisingly, microarray based identification of food-borne viruses, one of the largest groups of pathogenic viruses, causing more than 1.5 billion infections world-wide every year, has lagged behind. Cell-culture techniques are either unavailable or time consuming for routine application. Consequently, current detection methods for these pathogens largely depend on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based techniques, generally requiring an investigator to preselect the target virus of interest. Here we describe the first attempt to use the microarray as an identification tool for these viruses. We have developed methodology to synthesize targets for virus identification without using PCR, making the process genuinely sequence independent. We show here that a tiling microarray can simultaneously detect and identify the genotype and strain of common food-borne viruses in a single experiment.",

Indeed, any existing methods are currently impractical for rapid virus detection and identification, particularly when there is a need to applied detection methods for foods that are highly perishable and can contain cell culture inhibitory substances [5, 14] . For these reasons, there is an urgent need for the development of viral genome based rapid detection and identification methods for food-borne viruses with discriminatory power at the level of species and strain/genotype (or genogroup). Based on our previous results using a lower density array [15] as well as the work of others on non-food-borne viral pathogens [16] [17] [18] , microarray based methods offer one such methodological approach. Initial attempts at virus detection and typing by microarray hybridization were limited to detection of known mutations in the viral genome based on hybridization to a \"handful\" of oligonucleotide probes immobilized on a solid support. In the current investigation, we have successfully developed and applied a high density microarray to detection and identification of multiple viral species as well as virus strains within the same species. In addition, our results indicate the capacity of this methodology to discriminate between multiple virus species contained within the same sample.",

            "text": "Microarray Design and Fabrication. Throughout this manuscript, \"probes\" are used to mean oligonucleotides immobilized on the solid support, and \"targets\" are labeled cDNA sequences of the sample virus. Table 1 lists the selected enteric viruses and the number of probes for each strain of virus that were synthesized directly on the FDA_EVIR microarray by photolithography, whereby the total number of probes on the array is 91542. Selected regions of several enteric viral genomes were tiled at two nucleotide spacing, which means each succeeding oligo probe starts from the third nucleotide of the preceding oligo probe. Thus the approximately 91,000 probes can interrogate a total of more than 180,000 nucleotides. Since most enteric viruses have rather small genomes (approx. 7400 nucleotides), we were able to scan the genomes of a number of viruses. We also laid on the array a number of partial sequences in the database, particularly for norovirus. Each probe is 25 nucleotides long and there is a 23 base-pair overlap between consecutive probes for the same virus genotype; therefore, the complete array covers 183,084 nucleotides of viral genomic sequence. The number of probes for each group of virus range from 1113 for rotavirus (RV) group C segment IV to 18736 for norovirus (NV) genogroup II. The large range is due to the number and extent of independent genome sequences available for NV from GenBank. Norovirus genogroup II is represented by the largest number of probes due to a preponderance of partial sequences for these strains in GenBank. Generally, the short size of oligonucleotide probes on the array ensures that their binding to target sequences are sensitively affected by single base mismatches within a test genome that could be detected by a decrease in hybridization signal. Therefore, the tiling array design would allow detection of nucleotide changes by interrogating multiple neighboring probes.",

            "text": "All microarrays used in this study were customer ordered to be fabricated by Affymetrix Inc. (Santa Clara, CA) using a photolithographic array synthesis technology [19] . The tiling microarray was designed to detect common food-borne and fecally transmitted viruses including hepatitis A virus, norovirus, sapovirus, coxsackievirus, astrovirus, rotavirus, as well as hepatitis E virus. All viral genetic sequence data were obtained from the GenBank database of viral genomes. The tiling microarray chips were composed of overlapping 25mer oligonucleotides with a 2-nucleotide spacing whose sequences were derived from the 5' end viral genomes (3,700 nucleotides) of each virus except rotavirus. Sequence representation for this virus was derived from individual genome segments and ranged from approximately 2,300 to 3,300 nucleotides. Multiple sequences of partial genomes were also used as in the case, for example, of the HAV VP1-P2A junction. The genogroup (or genotype, serotype, group or partial genome) identification and the number of oligomer probes representing that particular group of genomes on the array is given in Table 1 . Microarray Hybridization, Scanning, and Data Analysis. Microarray hybridization was performed using the Affymetrix protocol. Briefly, biotinylated cDNA in the presence of Affymetrix hybridization buffer was hybridized to the microarray chip in a total volume of 120 l. Before application to the array, the samples were heated to 98 \u00b0C for 1 min, cooled at 45 \u00b0C for another 5 min, and centrifuged at 12,000 x g for 5 min. The microarray chip was then incubated at 45 \u00b0C for 16 hrs in a hybridization oven. Following hybridization, the wash and stain procedures were carried out by the Fluidics station (Affymetrix, CA). All arrays were imaged by using Affymetrix microarray scanner at a resolution of 10 m per pixel. Signal intensity of the hybridization was extracted by using Affymetrix power tools, and the subsequent data analysis was performed using MS Excel. For each viral genome represented on the array, the average signal intensity for all the probes within that genome was determined. The average intensity is first determined as described by Jackson et al. [20] , and Ayodeji et al. [15] . Each average genome intensity was then normalized by the average intensity of all the probes represented on the array. To minimize effects of nonspecific hybridization, an empirical cutoff value of 3.0 was considered as a threshold value for a positive signal. Microarray hybridization data were then converted to color visualization schemes in which hybridization signal intensity is reflected by the color scale of vertical strips.",

To confirm the microarray genotyping result of the norovirus sample #186 (NoV#186), we performed a specific PCR with a published primer set G1SKF (5'-CTGCCCGAATTYGTA AATGA-3') and G1SKR (5'-CCAACCCARCCATTRTAC A-3'); G2SKF (5'-CNTGGGAGGGCGATCGCAA-3') and G2SKR (5'-CCRCCNGCATRHCCRTTRTACAT-3'; Y=C/T; N=A/T/G/C; R=A/G; H=A/T/C). These primer pairs were used for the amplification of genogroup I and group II norovirus. The PCR was carried out as described previously [21] . The amplicon was sequenced and its relationship to known NoV strains was determined by phylogenetics analysis program ClustalX as described by Thompson et al. [22] . A phylogenetic tree from boot-strap analysis was generated by Neighbor-Joining method. Other norovirus samples were genotyped by Dr. William Burkhardt (FDA, Dauphin Island, AL) and by Dr. Jan Vinje (CDC, Atlanta, GA) via RT-PCR. Fig. (1) shows the results of hybridization of the array probes to samples of coxsackievirus, hepatitis A virus, and norovirus samples. Coxsackievirus samples CXKV B2, B3, B4 and A2 demonstrated clear-cut hybridization patterns. In CXKV A5, a minimal degree of cross-hybridization to A16, B3, B5 and A7 as well as B1 were also detected. The reason is the considerable localized sequence identity between different CXKV strains. However, their signal intensities were much lower than that of the probes from the same strain to targets derived from A5 itself (58.2-fold). For HAV, strong hybridization signals are only observed in HAVderived oligoprobes and genotypic-specific probes generate high intensity signals although cross-hybridization among strains is also observed, which reflects the sequence conservation within the HAV genus.",

Peaks indicate decreased hybridization of the test strains due to nucleotide changes. The corresponding sequence alignment shown (Figs. 2B, 3B) validates the peaks of maximum destabilization by identifying the nucleotide changes in HAS 15. In contrast, comparison of HM175 and 18f, which differ by only 28 nucleotides over their entire 7.4 kb genome, show only three areas of nucleotide changes (red line) within the VP1/2A junction.

Unlike in Figs.

The cross-hybridization of some CXKV strains to a limited number of oligo probes from a different strain marked areas of extensive sequence homology, when the sequence of different strains were aligned (data not shown). The specificity of the assay is exemplified by the fact that there was never any crosshybridization detected between CXKV, HAV and norovirus probes to the non-target sequences.",
