(2005) for 12 virus identification including IAV, IBV, ICV, RSV, HMPV, PIV1-4, HCoV-OC43  and 229E, and HRV in three tubes with hemi-nested PCR 8 then  later improved by Vabret et al. for 14 viruses plus with HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63 in four tubes. 13 Besides, the primers used for HRV detection could also detect HEV, and the two viruses were then differentiated based on the sizes of the amplified products. The DNA band with the size of 550-574 bp corresponded to rhinovirus while the band with the size of 600-700 bp corresponded to enterovirus. Hence, the mRT-PCR could detect 15 viruses. The mRT-PCR multiplex 1 and the hemi-nested multiplex 1 detected 1 and 0.1 TCID50 of RSV A, respectively, and 0.01 and 0.001 TCID50 of influenza virus A/H3N2, respectively. 8 We have improved the method to detect 17 viruses in a fivetube mRT-PCR assay by introducing specific primers to ADV and HBoV. 14,15 Moreover, we eliminated previous hemi-nested PCR step to avoid cross-contamination but introduced sequencing of amplification products. The assay was compared with commercialized Resplex II assay (Qiagen) in previous study and its sensitivity reached 0.01 TCID50 of RSV B, 0.3 TCID50 of influenza virus A/H1N1, and 0.001 TCID50 of IBV, respectively. 12 Tube 1 targeted IAV, IBV, RSV, HMPV; tube 2, PIV1-4; tube 3, HRV and ICV; and tube 4, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1. 8,10,12 Tube 5 targeted ADV and HBoV using previously published primers: HBoV (188F, 5 -GASCTCTGTAAGTACTATTAC-3 ;",

No HMPV-A2 lineage was found. Hence, a change of predominant lineage in the seasons was observed, but no association between the severity of infection and genetic drift of HMPV was found, as shown in other previous studies. 30, 31 Besides, studies showed more sequence diversity in G and SH genes but not in F gene, 30 which could explain the constant incidence of HMPV infection in the population. HCoV-HKU1 (in group II with HCoV-OC43) and HCoV-NL63 (in group I with HCoV-229E) are two novel coronaviruses. 32, 33 During the present 2-year study, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E were the major HCoV circulating in Shanghai, whereas only one strain of HCoV-OC43 and one of HCoV-HKU1 were detected, indicating a sporadic introduction of group II HCoV to the region. In context that the recent emerged HCoV, like HKU-1 and SARS whose sequence is more homologous to group II virus, could cause severe respiratory infection, the surveillance for emergence of new species of HCoV is necessary.",

            "text": "The co-infection of RSV and HBoV was frequently detected among the samples, whereas these two viruses co-dominated in cold season. HBoV was the second most prevalent virus (24.5%), and the co-infection rate of HBoV with other respiratory viruses was 54.6%, compared to 14% in non-HBoV-infected patients. This was lower than the co-infection rate reported previously, which ranged up to 71%. [34] [35] [36] [37] A previous study showed that HBoV increased the severity of bronchiolitis in children less than 1-year-old co-infected with RSV, and that it is not an occasional virus. 38 However, no correlation of HBoV infection with clinical severity was observed in this and its related study. 7 One study carried out in Wuhan, China analyzed peripheral blood samples by indirect immunofluorescence to detect RSV, IAV, IBV, ADV, PIV1-3, Chlamydia pneumonia and Mycoplasma pneumonia in children ARI inpatients and used viremia as sign of severe infection. 39 It showed that 36% of cases were co-infected by multiple agents and IAV, IBV and PIV1 were associated with co-infection. In addition, studies showed up to 30% of co-infection in hospitalized children 40 and RSV co-infection was associated with clinical severity. 38, 39 However, no such correlation was found in this study. This may be due to differences in the criteria of patient enrollment and in the lower severity of clinical signs observed. Bacteria-virus co-infection was commonly found in inpatients. In our study, only polynucleosis (>10,000 on absolute count) was considered as a sign of bacterial infection and was observed in 30 patients infected with a respiratory virus. Hence, future studies should focus on severe respiratory infection to identify viral determinants of disease severity and should introduce bacteriological test.",
