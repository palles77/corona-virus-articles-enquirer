In this study, we found that IOP can act as a broad-spectrum antiviral drug against feline viruses in the in vitro experiment. Using cell models of feline calicivirus (FCV), we demonstrated that IOP treatment was capable of exhibiting anti-FCV strain F9 activity in cell-based assays and also showed low cytotoxicity. Investigation of the mechanism of action of the compound revealed that IOP treatment induces its inhibitory actions directly on virus particles through blocking viral binding/absorpting. The inhibitory activity against other FCV isolates from China was also identified. More importantly, we found that IOP exhibited broad-spectrum antiviral activity against the feline herpesvirus 1, feline influenza virus H3N2 and H5N6, feline panleukopenia virus and feline infectious peritonitis virus that can contribute to respiratory and gastrointestinal diseases in cats. These findings suggest that IOP may be a potential broad-spectrum antiviral drug against feline viruses.",

Currently, while widespread vaccination projects have been performed, the prevalence of these viruses remains high due to main antigen change and the emergence of new viruses. Immune serum containing viral antibodies can be used to prevent infection in susceptible animals. However, the method is not currently widely applied. Feline recombinant interferon-omega is effective in the treatment of feline leukemia virus (FeLV) [1] and FCoV [2] infection in cats and also inhibits viral replication of canine parvovirus [3] . It remains unclear if it is an effective treatment to inhibit other feline viral infections. Mefloquine, a small molecule inhibitor was demonstrated as an effective antiviral drug against FCoV [4] and FCV [5] replication in in vitro experiments. Our previous studies showed that LiCl [6] and germacrone [7] can efficiently inhibit FCV replication in vitro. However, the broad-spectrum antiviral activity of the inhibitors needs to be investigated further. So, it is urgent to develop an effective, safe and broad-spectrum antiviral drug for feline viral diseases.",

It is a parasite on Betula (birch) trunks in low latitudes (approximately 45-50 \u2022 N) of Asia, Europe, and North America [8] . Clinical animal experiments demonstrate that IO polysaccharides may be a potential drug to prevent and cure cancer, cardiopathy, diabetes, AIDs, pancreatitis and other diseases [9] [10] [11] . IO fungus water extract shows a virucidal activity towards hepatitis C virus [12] , suggesting a potential application in antiviral research. However, it is a crude extract, and the main antiviral factor remains unknown. Moreover, a crude extract may potentially exhibit stronger toxicity. Here, we evaluate the antiviral effects of IO polysaccharides (IOPs) towards multi-feline respiratory and gastrointestinal viruses such as feline calicivirus (FCV), feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1), feline influenza virus (FIV), feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). The results revealed that IOP possesses broad-spectrum activity against feline RNA-and DNA-viruses. Preliminary mechanism revealed that IOP acts by targeting virus entry. ",

To investigate whether the anti-FCV activity of IOP resulted from the activation of cellular factors, cells were pre-treated with IOP; then cells in CP-A treated group were infected with FCV in presence of IOP, and cells in CP-B treated group were infected with FCV without IOP. As shown in Fig. 2C and D, the viral RNA level and viral titer from the CP-A treated group were significantly lower than the mock group but both levels were not reduced in the CP-B treated group while cells were pre-treated with IOP, indicating that anti-FCV activity for IOP may be not a result of activation of host factors by IOP treatment. Next, we examined whether IOP treatment induces its inhibitory actions directly on virus particles. The mixture containing virus and IOP was incubated at 4 \u2022 C for one hour and then added to cells. For the VT-A treated group, after a one-hour absorption period, the cells were continuously kept in the presence of IOP, but the VT-B treated group did not receive IOP in the medium. Both the viral RNA levels and the viral titers from the VT-A and VT-B treated groups were significantly lower than the mock group, but no significant difference was observed between the VT-A and VT-B treated groups (Fig. 2C, D) . In both the VS-A and VS-B group, the mixture containing virus and IOP was directly added to cells. For the VS-A treated group, after a one-hour absorption period, cells were continuously kept in the presence of IOP, but the VS-B treated group did not receive IOP in the medium. The result from a comparison between the VS-A and \u2212B treated groups was similar to that between the VT-A and VT-B treated group, both of which indicate that IOP treatment may affect viral binding/absorpting to cells directly.",

In this study, we found that IOP potently inhibits at least five different families including RNA viruses (Caliciviridae, Coronaviridae and Orthomyxoviridae) and DNA viruses (Alphaherpesvirinae and Parvovirus) ( Table 1) . To visualize the inhibitory effect of IOP, a In the CP-A group, the medium was not changed, and strain F9 at an MOI of 0.01 was directly added. In the CP-B group, the cells were washed and virus at an MOI of 0.01 was added. After one-hour absorption at 37 \u2022 C, fresh DMEM containing 1% FBS was added into the CP-A and CP-B groups. For the VT-A and VT-B groups, 100 L of IOP (60 g/mL) or DMEM (mock) and 10 L of strain F9 (an MOI of 0.01 when added into cells) were mixed and incubated at 4 \u2022 C for one hour before the mixture was added to the cells. After one-hour absorption at 37 \u2022 C, the cells were washed, and fresh DMEM containing 1% FBS and IOP (60 g/mL) or containing only 1% FBS was added into VT-A and VT-B groups, respectively. For the VS-A and VS-B group, 100 L of IOP (60 g/mL) or DMEM (mock) and 10 L of strain F9 (an MOI of 0.01 when added into cells) were mixed and then the mixture was directly added to the cells. After one-hour absorption at 37 \u2022 C, the cells were washed, and fresh DMEM containing 1% FBS and IOP (60 g/mL) or containing only 1% FBS was added to the VS-A and VS-B groups, respectively. Viral RNA (C) and titers (D) were analyzed at 36 hpi. Results represent the mean of three replicates \u00b1 SD, and each experiment was repeated three times. The data is an overview of cell-based experiments to evaluate the antiviral efficacy (IC50) and overall toxicity (CC50) of IOP. The antiviral activity of IOP was detected using multiple and unrelated viruses and on different cell types.",

The time-of-addition experiment performed with FCV suggested that the early stage of viral replication is affected by IOP. Because a variety of different virus families were inhibited by IOP, it appears likely that a potential cellular factor that is essential for viral replication was activated. However, we found that IOP treatment induces its inhibitory actions directly on virus particles and may affect viral binding/absorpting to cells directly. Previous clinical animal experiments demonstrate that IOP may be a potential drug to prevent and cure cancer, cardiopathy, diabetes, AIDs, pancreatitis and other diseases [9] [10] [11] . Here, we described the broad-spectrum antiviral effects of IOP towards multi-feline viruses such as feline calicivirus (FCV), feline herpesvirus 1 (FHV-1), feline influenza virus (FIV), feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), feline coronavirus (FCoV). Moreover, IOP showed low cytotoxicity, and the CC 50 was determined to be > 1 mg/mL. The IC 50 for the viruses in this study ranged from 10 g/mL to 100 g/mL. Notably, IOP treatment shows no toxic effects on mouse major organs such as the liver, as evaluated by histopathological examinations [23] . These data indicate that IOP might be a potential feline antiviral agent due to its broad-spectrum antiviral activity and low toxicity.",

The feline viruses investigated are members of RNA and DNA viral families, many of which do not use the same entry mechanism. A previous study indicated that the extracts of Ulva fasciata (U1) can inhibit JEV infection by forming the U1-JEV complex, then blocking virus adsorption [22] . Based on the investigation of the mechanism of IOP against FCV infection, only two hours of pre-treatment with IOP for cells before infection did not contribute to their resistance to FCV infection, suggestting that hose factors activated by IOP may not play important role in anti-FCV infection. However, both treatment of addition of IOP into the virus before infection or without pretreatment could inhibit FCV replication. So we speculate IOP can absorb these virus particles, which may prevent these viruses from entering into cells.",
