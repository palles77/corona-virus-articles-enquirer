Methods: Retrospective study of critically ill patients with 2009 influenza A(H1N1) at ICU. Demographic data, symptoms, comorbid conditions, and clinical outcomes were collected using a case report form. Results: Critical illness occurred in 61 patients admitted to an ICU with confirmed (n=45) or probable and suspected 2009 influenza A(H1N1). Patients were young (mean, 41.5 years), were female (54%). Fifty-six patients, required mechanical ventilation (14 invasive, 27 noninvasive, 15 both) during the course of ICU. On admission, mean APACHE II score was 18.7\u00b16.3 and median PaO 2 /FIO 2 was 127.9\u00b170.4. 31 patients (50.8%) was die. There were no significant differences in baseline PaO 2 /FIO 2 and ventilation strategies between survivors and nonsurvivors. Patients who survived were more likely to have NIMV use at the time of admission to the ICU. Conclusion: Critical illness from 2009 influenza A(H1N1) in ICU predominantly affects young patients with little major comorbidity and had a high case-fatality rate. NIMV could be used in 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection-related hypoxemic respiratory failure.",

In the affected patients, a novel swine origin influenza A (H1N1) virus (S-OIV) with molecular features of North American and Eur-asian swine, avian, and human influenza viruses were isolated (2) . In the same month, the World Health Organization (WHO) classified the global spread of this virus as a public health event of international concern. After documentation of human to human transmission of the virus in at least three countries of two WHO regions, the WHO raised the pandemic level to 6 (3). It has spread very rapidly since the first cases were diagnosed in Mexico with the subsequent spread of the virus throughout Europe during the winter season. The H1N1 2009 influenza pandemic (pH1N1) has resulted in over 15921 deaths worldwide more than 212 countries as of 14 February 2010 (4) . Turkey reported its first laboratory-confirmed case of influenza A (H1N1) on 16 May 2009, becoming the eighteenth country in the WHO European region to do so, and a second case on 17 May 2009 (5) .",

            "text": "Our data of critically ill patients with Influenza A 2009 (H1N1) reveals that relatively younger patients are affected by the disease. Fever and respiratory symptoms were cardinal symptoms of disease in all patients. There was a relatively long period of illness prior to presentation to the hospital, followed by a short period of acute and severe respiratory deterioration. These patients had severe hypoxia requiring high FiO2, PEEP, and ventilator pressures. Within 30 days, 51% of critically ill patients had died. Previously published reports have highlighted cases of severe viral pneumonia affecting patients younger than the expected age of patients affected during a normal influenza season (11) . The low mean age is different from seasonal influenza, in which older patients appear more susceptible to severe diseases (12) . Our findings are consistent with these reports. In our data and in other studies, death was occurred mostly young critically ill patients (1, 13, 14) . But, the risk of death increased with increasing age. Importantly, severity of illness and mortality in our cohort are similar to that demonstrated previously with novel H1N1. The first data from Mexico showed that most of the patients were previously healthy (1). In our study, the most of critically ill patients had comorbidities and there was no difference according to comorbidities between survived and died patients. A history of lung diseases, obesity, diabetes, hypertension, neurological diseases, malignancy, and heart diseases were the most common comorbidities in our study (83.6%). Among critically ill patients, obesity has been shown to be a risk factor for increased morbidity, but not consistently with mortality (15) . In our study, there was no statistically significant difference due to obesity between survivors and nonsurvivors. We did not find a significant difference in BMI between survivors and nonsurvivors. An early 2009 meta-analysis indicated that obesity was not associated with increased ICU mortality (16) . A recent, large cohort study by Gong et al. (17) prior to 2009 novel H1N1 infection, noted an association of obesity with ARDS but not with mortality. The Canadian novel H1N1 experience likewise suggests that BMI did not differ between survivors and non-survivors (18) . Patients with H1N1 infection-related critical illness experienced symptoms for an average of 6 days prior to hospital presentation, but rapidly worsened and required care in the ICU within 1 to 2 days (1). In our study, this duration was higher than other studies (1, 18, 19) . The tendency of females to develop severe 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection in this series is striking. A general female susceptibility has been observed in other influenza case series of variable severity including reports of H1N1 infections (18, 19) . In this report, death was higher in males than females. The explanation for increased risk of death among males in this report may be due to existence of more frequent comorbidities in man. In most of infectious diseases and related conditions such as sepsis and septic shock, males represent a larger proportion of cases and have a higher mortality (20, 21) . Importantly, we found in this cohort that APACHE II score may help to identify patients at high risk of death.",

However, survival rate was higher in NIMV than invasive ventilation. We used full-face mask in all patients for NIMV. Noninvasive ventilation has been used an alternative therapy for patients with acute respiratory failure with hopes of obviating intubation and mechanical ventilation. The results of NIMV in hypoxemic respiratory failure have been conflicting, and the etiology of hypoxemia appears to be an important determinant of its success. Ferrer et al. (22) compared NIMV to conventional venture oxygen delivery in patients with severe hypoxemic respiratory failure and found that NIMV decreased the need for intubation. This benefit was observed in the subgroup of patients with pneumonia, but not in those with ARDS, in which the intubation rates were high in both groups. A meta-analysis suggests that NIMV does not decrease the need for intubation, so there is not enough evidence to support its use in ARDS (23) . Of all patients, 56 (91 %) were mechanically ventilated on the first day of ICU admission; 14 (23 %) invasively and 42 (68.8 %) noninvasively. Fifteen patients (24.5%) who received noninvasive ventilation ultimately required invasive ventilation. Dominguez-Cherit et al. (24) reported that invasively ventilation was used in 82.7% of patients. In Kumar's study (18) , invasive ventilation was used in 81% of patients with swine flu associated respiratory failure. In our study, we used noninvasive ventilation in 68.8% of critically patients with 2009 Influenza A (H1N1) on admission ICU. In critically ill patients with 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection, high levels of PEEP were often used to achieve adequate oxygenation. In our study, patients with ARDS were often had PEEP refractory hypoxemia. It was also noted that once patients improved and the weaning process was started, oxygenation was sensitive to small decrements in PEEP. We used high PEEP levels up to 20-25 cmH2O in some patients.",

It is difficult to identify immediately if patients are infected or not during epidemic so noninvasive ventilation can be initial chose of ventilatory support in those patients. There is always a potential harm from a withholding a procedure while there is epidemics. Even if there is risk to use noninvasive ventilation for H1N1 patients since it may save the lives, we decided to use it under strict isolation including negative pressure isolation rooms.",

Among patients admitted to ICU, older age, and a requirement for invasive ventilation were associated with increased risk of death, but because there were greater numbers of younger patients in our cohort, the majority of deaths occurred in younger patients. Alternatively, NIMV could be used in 2009 influenza A (H1N1) infection-related hypoxemic respiratory failure.",
