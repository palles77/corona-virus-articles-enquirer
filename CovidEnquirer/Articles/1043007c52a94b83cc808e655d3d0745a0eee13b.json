Very low levels of IFN-y were found in the serum and peritoneal exudate of infected young mice. This was in contrast to the levels observed in adult mice. Spleen cells and macrophage cultures from young AI] mice, again in contrast to adult AI] mice, were shown to be unable to synthesize IFN-y and IFN-Ct/~ respectively. Macrophages from either young or adult AI] mice were able to be activated with exogenous recombinant IFN-y or IFN-a/~, enabling both sets of cells to restrict MHV3 replication. The results indicate that the ability of the immune system to synthesize IFN-y and IFN-a/~ may playa major role in the age-dependent resistance of AI] mice to MHV3.",

IFN-a/~ is readily induced during the initial phase of infection, well before the generation of an immune response, and IFN-y is rapidly induced following the generation of the immune response directed against the virus. Our previous studies, both in vitro and in vivo indicated that aT-cell dependent activation of macrophages in which IFN-y plays a major role is required to confer resistance to adult AI] mice against MHV3 (27) . These mice have macrophages that are very sensitive to IFN -y and are also sensitive to IFN-a/~. During infection, IFN-y is found in significant amounts in peritoneal exudate and serum and can be effective in restricting MHV3 multiplication in macrophages. On the other hand, mice from the susceptible BALBI c strain were shown to have macrophages that are not sensitive to IFN-a/~ or IFN-y. In spite of the high amounts of IFN-y detected in the serum and peritoneal exudate during the first days of infection, the macrophages could not restrict virus multiplication. The animals died 5 to 6 days after infection with the high amounts of IFN-y reflecting the virus replication and stimulation of the immune system (27) .",
