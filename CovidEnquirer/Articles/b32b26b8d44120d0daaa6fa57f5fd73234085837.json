            "text": "Extracts of Echinacea purpurea (EP, purple coneflower) have been used traditionally in North America for the treatment of various types of infections and wounds, and they have become very popular herbal medicines globally. Recent studies have revealed that certain standardized preparations contain potent and selective antiviral and antimicrobial activities. In addition, they display multiple immune-modulatory activities, comprising stimulation of certain immune functions such as phagocytic activity of macrophages and suppression of the proinflammatory responses of epithelial cells to viruses and bacteria, which are manifested as alterations in secretion of various cytokines and chemokines. These immune modulations result from upregulation or downregulation of the relevant genes and their transcription factors. All these bioactivities can be demonstrated at noncytotoxic concentrations of extract and appear to be due to multiple components rather than the individual chemical compounds that characterize Echinacea extracts. Potential applications of the bioactive extracts may go beyond their traditional uses.",

            "text": "Herbal medicines derived from several species of the indigenous Echinacea genus were in use throughout the plains of North America long before the introduction of European medicines, primarily as treatments for various infectious diseases and wounds. Nine discrete species were classified subsequently by botanists, as indicated in Table 1 , although medical records suggest that considerable interchange between uses of designated species occurred and consequently the association of a specific species with particular treatments has to be viewed with caution [1] [2] [3] . Even in recent years there have been revisions in the taxonomy of the genus [4, 5] . Nevertheless it is generally agreed that Echinacea purpurea, the purple coneflower, was widely used by Native peoples and later by the Eclectic practitioners of North America, possibly because it was so widespread, and also because it was apparently effective in a number of diseases. Current herbal preparations, which have become very popular in North America, Europe, and elsewhere, have tended to favor this species over the others, and the majority of the basic scientific studies have focused on this one. Accordingly, this review is restricted primarily to discussion of E. purpurea (abbreviated EP), with occasional reference to alternative species.",

Influenza virus A deserves special consideration because of its unique capacity for genetic reassortment between animal and human strains and consequent production of epidemics (Section 2.3 below). The SARS virus (SARS-HCoV) also merits additional comments, as explained in Section 15. In addition the recent application of more sensitive molecular detection techniques has revealed the presence of other viruses, such as metapneumoviruses and bocaviruses, which might also be involved in the generation of respiratory symptoms [10] . However we do not know if these newly recognized viruses are really pathogenic or are simply \"passengers\" that eluded previous diagnostic techniques. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) also produces oral mucosal infections (\"cold sores\"), and these may be accompanied by symptoms reminiscent of respiratory viruses.",

Other molecules such as kinins are released and are probably responsible for some of the early symptoms. Rhinoviruses have also been shown to induce kinin gene expression [27] , although this effect is more likely a delayed effect of virus infection. In response to all these mediators phagocytic cells and various types of inflammatory cell may then be attracted to the site of infection [26] .

If a potential safe anti-inflammatory agent also contains multiple antiviral activities, then this would provide a bonus. Several herbal extracts have been shown to possess a combination of bioactivities that could be useful in the control of respiratory infections [17, 29, 30] , and these Echinacea extracts have become very popular, although, because of the variation in their chemical composition (as mentioned in Section 1), not all of them are necessarily beneficial.",

However there was no correlation between antiviral activity and composition of the recognized marker compounds, that is, caffeic acids, polysaccharides, and alkylamides, and in fact a purified polysaccharide fraction from EP possessed no significant activity, while cichoric acid and several caffeic acid derivatives showed only weak to moderate activity, insufficient to account for the potent activities of EP [42] . In addition the antiviral activity of commercial ethanol tinctures from EP can remain stable for at least several years at ambient temperatures, which would seem to rule out many potential candidate bioactive compounds. Furthermore some, but not all, of the antiviral activities were due to photosensitizers, which again limits the number of prospective candidates [12, 43] .",

Rhinoviruses stimulated the secretion of many different cytokines [46, 47] , including the proinflammatory IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF\u03b1, which are known to be collectively involved in many of the symptoms common to respiratory infections, such as sneezing, fever, sore throat, nasal discharges, and inflammation in various respiratory tissues. Several EP preparations were able to completely or partly reverse this stimulation [48] [49] [50] . EP could be added before or after virus infection, with similar success, and also the results were not affected by virus dose or the time of exposure to EP [49] . It is noteworthy that RV14 and RV1A, which are known to use distinct cellular receptors (ICAM-1 and LDL, resp.), both stimulate cytokine secretion that is reversed by EP, suggesting the involvement of multiple signaling pathways. This concept was supported by the demonstration that many transcription factors (TF's) known to be associated with cytokines and chemokines were also stimulated by RV14, and these TF's were modulated by EP treatment [50, 51] .",

In the case of EP, all the fractions derived from roots, leaves plus stems, and flowers, were anti-inflammatory according to IL-6 and IL-8 measurements [52] . Numerous viral and bacterial infections, as well as wounds, result in substantial stimulation in levels of proinflammatory cytokines, especially IL-6 and IL-8, which are consequently considered to represent useful markers of an inflammatory condition [23, 29] . Thus any compound or herbal extract that inhibits or reverses this elevation in IL-6/8 and so forth, could be considered as a potential anti-inflammatory agent.

Under these conditions the effects of rhinovirus infection, and EP, on various parameters of tissue integrity and cytokine induction were evaluated [55] . Individual replicate tissue samples, maintained as inserts in culture for three days or three weeks, were infected with rhinovirus type 1A (RV1A), EP alone, a combination of the two, or medium only. None of the treatments affected the histological appearance or integrity of the tissues, all of which maintained a high level of cell viability and preservation of cilia, with the exception of the conspicuous virus-induced mucopolysaccharide inclusions in the goblet cells. There was no evidence of virus replication, although the RV infected tissues secreted substantial amounts of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8, and this response was reversed by EF treatment ( Table 5 ). The goblet cells also appeared normal and free of inclusions in the EP-treated tissues. Therefore these results confirmed the findings derived from studies of bronchial and lung epithelial cell lines (above), namely, that RV infection resulted in a substantial inflammatory response and mucin secretion in the absence of virus replication.",

Both extracts influenced the expression of many genes, including cytokine genes, although the pattern of expression was different for the two extracts. In addition the virus itself induced numerous changes, mostly increases in expression, [55] ). and the extracts tended to decrease (i.e., restore to normal levels) these expression levels. Further analysis of the effects revealed that some of the changes in cytokine expression were interconnected through a specific transcription factor, C/EBPb (CAAT/enhancerbinding protein b, [59] ). Since numerous transcription factors were known to be affected by EP extract in this same cell-virus system [50] , it is tempting to conclude that many gene expression effects of Echinacea extracts could be due to changes in expression or activation status of multiple transcription factors. This in turn could be brought about by interaction with surface receptors or their intracellular modulators. Analyses of IFN\u03b1 (interferon alpha) gene expression, by DNA microarray analysis and PCR assays, revealed only a few changes in cells treated by different EP extracts, in uninfected bronchial epithelial cells, or in rhinovirus-infected cells, although certain interferon stimulated genes (ISG's) were upregulated by the virus and downregulated by the EP extracts [59] . Interferon bioassays in bronchial cells failed to detect IFN, in contrast to cells stimulated by the known IFN inducer poly I : C (Vimalanathan and Hudson, unpublished data). Negative findings were also reported recently in a mouse macrophage cell line infected with HSV-1 [60] , from which the authors concluded that EP induced little if any IFN alpha or beta, and consequently antiviral effects of EP are not likely to involve the interferon system.",

The reverse process was also demonstrated; prior infection of epithelial cells with H. influenzae increased the level of ICAM-1 receptors and resulted in enhanced rhinovirus infection [76] .

Keratitis, an infection of the corneal epithelium and stromal tissue, which may also be recurrent, is a major cause of blindness. Fortunately most of these infections are accessible to topical agents, and not surprisingly many antiviral drugs have been marketed for their control, with variable success; but since most of these were designed to target viral genes, then emergence of resistant mutants is always a threat. However many plant extracts have been evaluated as anti-HSV agents [77, 78] , and some of these have shown promising results. Several EP preparations showed potent virucidal activity against HSV, and these results have already been summarized in Section 2.1 above, in connection with respiratory viruses.

One explanation for the chronic nature of the disease is that the P. acnes induces the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as other inflammatory mediators, which attract leukocytes to the site of infection and thereby set up a cascade of inflammatory responses, which also involve production of reactive oxygen species and other radicals, all of which in combination lead to the development of the acne lesion [79, 80] . Conventional therapy targets the development of the lesions, by means of retinoic acid analogues and other compounds and antibiotics directed against the bacterium [80] . Needless to say that the continued application of antibiotics entails the risk of resistant bacteria emerging. As an alternative approach, several recent reports have indicated the possibility of using plant extracts to counter the growth of the bacteria and/or the inflammatory response, although these have yet to be evaluated in vivo (e.g., [81] ).",

Results are summarized in Table 7 . The bacterial-induced cytokines included IL-6 and IL-8 (CXCL8), and to a lesser extent TNF\u03b1, which are hallmarks of inflammatory responses and would be expected to lead to influx of various inflammatory leukocytes.

Thus the net result of interactions between EP and cells in vivo will likely be influenced by the composition of the extract and the nature and location of the cell type. Rininger et al. made a different series of observations [106] . They reported that several preparations of EP showed minimal effects on production of cytokines in mouse cultures, unless the extracts were first exposed to a simulated gastric and intestinal digestion protocol, whereupon they acquired the ability to stimulate cytokine secretion. This result is clearly relevant to normal consumption of Echinacea, but remains unexplained.",

The epidemic was officially recorded as the first pandemic of the 21st century. As a result of emergency global public health measures the disease was halted and appears to have been controlled, although continued vigilance is necessary in case the causative virus \"returns\" [119] . The novel coronavirus responsible (SARS CoV), believed to be of animal origin, was isolated and its genome quickly sequenced [119] . However no satisfactory antiviral therapy was or is available. A study on autopsy lung tissues revealed that viral nucleoprotein and RNA were present mainly in alveolar epithelial cells, the probable initial site of virus replication, and to a lesser extent in macrophages, which could be the mode of systemic transmission [120] . A more recent review summarized studies on SARS CoV infection in cell cultures and emphasized the role of innate immune responses to the virus infection [121] . This virus, like other coronaviruses and other respiratory viruses, stimulates inflammatory cytokine secretion, although coronaviruses generally do not induce antiviral interferon. Thus modulation of cytokines and evasion of the innate immune defences could be important contributors to SARS virus pathology. Therefore a herbal preparation like EP, with antiinflammatory and virucidal properties, could be useful if the SARS were to return.",

It is likely that the chemical composition of the extracts, and consequently their bioactivities, differed substantially. Attempts to rationalize the interpretation of results by the use of meta-analyses encountered the same problem, namely, the resulting variability in test materials. Consequently it is no surprise that the issue is \"controversial\", and many popular scientists and pseudoscientists have jumped to conclusions about the efficacy or lack of efficacy of Echinacea in preventing or treating the common cold. In spite of these reservations there was an overall trend towards beneficial effects of the Echinacea, but equally importantly the safety of the preparations was confirmed repeatedly, including trials in children [125] [126] [127] . A more comprehensive trial that also includes influenza virus and other respiratory viruses, incorporating the use of a well-characterized bioactive Echinacea extract, is needed to confirm the benefits of oral Echinacea use.",

In addition, these extracts can affect various signaling pathways of epithelial cells and inhibit the virus/bacterium-induced secretion of cytokines/chemokines and other inflammatory mediators that were responsible for the pulmonary symptoms. Since many signaling pathways can be affected by Echinacea in different cell types, including immune cells [47, 59, 97] , it is conceivable that the overall beneficial effects are due to a particular combination of compounds acting synergistically. Examples of synergism in herbal medicine have been described and in some cases validated experimentally [23, 129, 130] , and it is likely that certain Echinacea preparations also display synergism. However, in spite of our attempts to correlate bioactivities of Echinacea preparations with recognized chemical markers, that is, polysaccharides, caffeic acid derivatives, and alkylamides [5] [6] [7] , we have not succeeded in doing so. In contrast, preliminary evidence in our laboratory has implicated other classes of compounds (unpublished data).",
