In that study, more respondents underestimated the death rate of SARS patients than in the present study (71% vs. 45%), with no significant difference between affected and unaffected countries. Our study was conducted later, which may have meant that more knowledge about SARS was available. Earlier studies (9, 10) have reported on SARS-related risk perceptions during the outbreak in Hong Kong, and these studies reported quite different perceptions of high personal risk, ranging from 9%-30%. In our study, the perceived likelihood of getting SARS was rated high by few persons. Women reported higher perceptions of risk than men, and people with less education expressed more worries about the disease. Earlier studies on different topics reported mixed findings on differences in risk perceptions according to level of education (11) (12) (13) . Higher perceptions of risk were associated with more worry and more self-reported precaution-ary actions, which is in line with predictions from risk perception theory and previous research (2, 9) . Avoiding air travel was the only precautionary action that was mentioned relatively often.",
