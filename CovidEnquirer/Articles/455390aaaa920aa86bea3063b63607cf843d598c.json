The mortality rate in this patient population is low (!1%) in contrast to patients who require hospitalization, who have a mortality rate of approximately 15%. Because most patients with pneumonia are managed by emergency and primary care physicians, infectious disease specialists tend to see a population of patients with pneumonia that is skewed toward more complicated and severe infections. Emergency physicians may be less inclined than infectious diseases specialists to pursue aggressive diagnostic testing and cultures, except in patients who are seriously ill. Whereas in the past decisions regarding initial antibiotic therapy were deferred to admitting primary care and consulting physicians, quality standards currently reinforce timely initiation of antibiotics in the emergency department (ED). The practicality and ultimate consequences of arbitrary time standards are debated, however. Pneumonia management remains challenging because of several constantly changing factors, including an expanding spectrum of pathogens, changing antibiotic resistance patterns, the availability of newer antimicrobial agents, and increasing emphasis on cost effectiveness and outpatient management.",

Issues for which emergency physicians and infectious disease specialists may have different perspectives include the use of blood and sputum cultures, indications for hospital admission, appropriate level of care, and the breadth of antimicrobial spectrum for empiric therapy.",

In most healthy older children and adults, the diagnosis of pneumonia can be reasonably excluded on the basis of history and physical examination, with suspected cases further evaluated by chest radiography.

Although it is clear that many chest radiographs are performed unnecessarily on patients with upper respiratory tract infections or bronchitis, it is difficult to identify a set of specific criteria to direct test ordering that is better than the clinical judgment of an experienced physician [5] . Routine chest radiography for all patients who present with cough is not necessary but may be reserved for patients without a history of asthma who have other suggestive findings (eg, fever, tachycardia, decreased oxygen saturation, or focal abnormality on lung examination) [6] . Among patients who are suspected of having pneumonia, these clinical findings have been prospectively validated and are better predictors of a radiographic infiltrate than physician judgment [7] . Patients with serious underlying disease or severe sepsis/septic shock in whom hospitalization is considered should have a chest radiograph performed. CT of the chest seems to be more sensitive than plain radiography for detecting the presence of pulmonary consolidation, although the natural history and clinical significance of CT-positive, plain radiograph-negative pneumonia are not clear [8] . CT may play a role in evaluating for other pulmonary diagnoses that may mimic pneumonia, such as pulmonary emboli, and may further delineate the nature of the pneumonia, such as in the case of necrotizing infection associated with community-associated methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA).",

Routine performance of chest radiography for patients with exacerbation of chronic bronchitis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is of low yield and may be limited to patients with other signs of infection or congestive failure [9] . Studies of infants with fever show that routine chest radiography is of low yield in the absence of other symptoms or signs of lower respiratory tract infection (eg, cough, rales, or elevated respiratory rate) [10, 11] .

Although the finding of a white blood cell (WBC) count of more than 15,000/mm 3 increases the probability of the patient having a pyogenic bacterial origin rather than a viral or atypical origin, this finding depends on the stage of the illness and is neither sensitive nor specific enough to aid decisions regarding therapy in an individual patient. A WBC count may be helpful if it reveals evidence of immunosuppression, such as neutropenia or lymphopenia, which may indicate immunosuppression from AIDS. Serum lactate dehydrogenase may be helpful in evaluating possible Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in patients known or suspected to have HIV infection. Several rapid HIV tests are available that may be helpful in this situation [17] . Although CD4 counts usually cannot be obtained within the time frame of an ED visit, total lymphocyte count of less than 1000/mm 3 predicts a higher likelihood of CD4 count less than 200/mm 3 [18] . When suspicion exists for severe sepsis/septic shock, serum chemistry and coagulation studies may be helpful in evaluating patients for metabolic acidosis, renal and hepatic dysfunction, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. In the absence fluid-unresponsive hypotension, elevated arterial and central venous lactic acid levels also may indicate the need for early and aggressive hemodynamic resuscitation and broader empirical antibiotic therapy.",

For most patients, thoracentesis can be deferred until after hospital admission. Patients in significant respiratory distress or with evidence of tension and mediastinal shift require emergent diagnostic and therapeutic thoracentesis, however. Assessment of respiratory function with pulse oximetry is important in the evaluation of patients with pneumonia. Because clinical assessment of oxygenation can be inaccurate [3] , a pulse oximetry reading should be obtained in any patient suspected of having pneumonia in the EDdand ideally upon ED triage.

The routine use of sputum Gram stain as a basis for empiric therapy in the ED can be problematic for several reasons. Many patients are not able to provide an adequate sputum specimen. Induction of sputum without adequate isolation facilities can put patients and staff at risk if sputum is induced from persons with unrecognized TB. Correlation between identification of pneumococcus on Gram stain and sputum culture results is poor, even when commonly used criteria for an adequate sputum specimen (less than five squamous epithelial cells and O25 WBC/high power field) are applied. Gram stains are even less likely to demonstrate gram-negative pathogens, such as H influenzae, and should not be relied on to rule out a gram-negative cause.",

The most recent Infectious Disease Society of America/American Thoracic Society (IDSA/ATS) consensus guidelines suggest that more aggressive diagnostic testing can be reserved for the more seriously ill patients. If sputum Gram stain and culture are considered, they should be reserved for the subset of patients with more serious illness (eg, admitted to the intensive care unit [ICU]), in whom the bacteriologic diagnosis is highly uncertain and for whom it is felt that the outcome may depend on optimal antimicrobial therapy.

Most studies have revealed that the rates of false-positive culture results are similar to true-positive results, and false-positive culture results increase costs and prolong hospital stays [24, 25] . In one prospective study of 760 patients with CAP, a change of antibiotic therapy based on blood cultures may have improved clinical outcome in only three cases (0.4%) [26] . Blood cultures should be obtained in seriously ill patients; if drawn, they should be obtained before the initiation of antibiotics (although antibiotics should not be delayed for this reason). When results are positive, blood cultures reflect the etiologic agent more accurately than sputum cultures but still only uncommonly lead to a rational change in antimicrobial therapy. Bacteremia occurs in approximately 25% to 30% of hospitalized pneumococcal pneumonia cases, but the diagnosis and therapy are usually well established before blood culture results are available.",

Unfortunately, it is often not possible to predict later transfer to ICU when a patient is admitted from the ED. Infectious disease consultants who see the minority of patients who deteriorate after initial treatment in the hospital may criticize the lack of blood cultures obtained on admission. Perspective from these occasional cases should not lead to a conclusion that all patients admitted with pneumonia need blood cultures. Blood cultures obtained from patients who do not show signs of serious infection at the time of ED evaluation are of lower yield and often give false-positive results (ie, contaminants). The follow-up of false-positive blood culture results can be costly and labor intensive and may lead to unnecessary use of agents such as vancomycin or linezolid when results are initially reported as gram-positive cocci in clusters.",

Inpatient treatment of pneumonia is approximately 25 times more expensive per patient than outpatient treatment, and most patients are more comfortable in a home environment. There is tremendous variability in physician admission decisions for pneumonia. The more common tendency is overestimation of disease severity, which leads to hospitalization of patients at low risk for death or serious complications [31] . Although no firm guidelines exist regarding hospital admission, several well-recognized risk factors are associated with an increased risk of death or a complicated clinical course [32, 33] . It is becoming more common practice for many hospitals and managed care systems to use some type of scoring system to assist with decisions regarding hospitalization for patients who have pneumonia. One commonly used system is based on the Pneumonia Patient Outcomes Research Team study, a prospectively validated predictive rule for mortality among immunocompetent adults with CAP [34] . This model (also known as the pneumonia severity index [PSI]) suggests a two-step approach to assess risk. Patients in the lowest risk class who are recommended for outpatient management are younger than age 50, do not have significant comorbid conditions (eg, neoplasm, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, renal disease, liver disease), and do not have the following findings on physical examination: altered mental status, pulse 125 beats/min or more, respiratory rate 30 breaths/min or more, systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg, or temperature less than 35 C or 40 C or more. Patients who do not fit the lowest risk category are classified into categories based on a scoring system that takes into account age, comorbid illness, physical examination findings, and laboratory abnormalities (Tables 1 and 2 ). Hospitalization is recommended for patients with a score more than 91 (class IV-V), and brief admission or observation may be considered for patients with a score of 71 to 90 (class III).",

Additional discharge criteria could include improving and stable vital signs over a several-hour observation period, ability to take oral medications, an ambulatory pulse oximetry more than 90%, home support, and ability to follow-up. Good clinical judgment should supersede a strict interpretation of a scoring system. A study in which physicians were educated and provided the patient's risk score, however, revealed a significantly lower overall admission rate, cost savings, and similar quality-of-life scores compared with patients conventionally managed by their physicians [35] . Another study randomized patients in PSI class II-III to admission or discharge home and found that outcomes such as mortality and hospital readmission were similar, with higher patient satisfaction among outpatients [36] .

Transfer to the ICU for delayed onset of respiratory failure or septic shock is associated with increased mortality [42] . Defining ''severe'' pneumonia also has implications for empiric antimicrobial selection. Most studies of ''severe'' pneumonia have simply defined it as pneumonia in a patient admitted to the ICU. Objective criteria using the PSI (class V) and CURB-65 have been proposed but have not been prospectively validated for the ICU admission decision. When these criteria were retrospectively studied in a cohort of CAP patients, they did not perform better than actual physician decisions [43] . The 2007 IDSA/ATS guidelines include criteria for defining severe CAP that are based on ATS minor criteria and CURB variables ( Table 3 ) [1] . They recommend that either of the two major criteria is an indication for ICU admission and that presence of at least three minor criteria would indicate a need for ICU admission.

It is important to recognize that this practice comes with a cost that may put other patients at higher risk for morbidity and mortality, however. Many ICUs in US hospitals are operating at capacity or near capacity, and seriously ill patients are spending more time boarding in EDs when no beds are available. ED overcrowding has adverse impacts that include ambulance diversions and longer transport times, longer waiting times for patients (some of whom have serious illness that cannot be recognized until they are evaluated by a physician), and lower overall quality of care [44] . Transfer of a deteriorating patient to the ICU from the hospital ward is not necessarily a failure. Some of the appropriate reasons for admitting patients to the hospital are to observe them and quickly move them to a higher level of care if necessary.",

Depending on individual risk assessment, other patients with noncavitary pulmonary infiltrates, such as inner-city homeless persons or intravenous drug users, may need to be isolated for possible TB.

This policy was largely based on a 2004 study that showed that administration of antimicrobial agents within 4 hours of hospital arrival was associated with lower mortality and reduced length of stay for Medicare patients over age 65 [57] . For various reasons, many facilities have had difficulty meeting this standard in a high proportion of patients. EDs in many US cities face critical overcrowding issues, and patients with pneumonia who do not appear seriously ill at triage may spend hours in the waiting room before evaluation. Because the ''clock starts ticking'' when the patient arrives at triage, the 4-hour time limit may pass by the time a patient is evaluated by a physician. The diagnosis of pneumonia is not always straightforward, and even minimal diagnostic testing in the ED may put a patient beyond the 4-hour window. Much like the problem of retrospective judgment, case reviews based on the final hospital diagnosis of pneumonia are biased toward overestimating therapeutic delays of patients who initially appear to have other conditions, such as congestive heart failure [58, 59] . Some facilities have even resorted to a policy of giving antibiotics upon arrival for any patient with respiratory complaints that might be possibly caused by pneumonia. This strategy may improve compliance with the standard but obviously leads to many patients receiving unnecessary antibiotics [60, 61] .",

Although it is not possible to predict a specific cause of pneumonia with a high degree of accuracy, it is possible to choose empiric therapy that covers the likely pathogens without being unnecessarily broad spectrum. For most older children and adults with CAP, it is appropriate to choose empiric regimens with activity against S pneumoniae, H influenzae, and atypical organisms such as C pneumoniae and M pneumoniae. Recommendations for empiric therapy for CAP in adults are summarized in Tables 4 and 5. CA-MRSA has rapidly emerged as the most common pathogen isolated in community-acquired skin and soft-tissue infections [63] and is increasingly recognized as a cause of CAP. CA-MRSA pneumonia typically presents as a severe, rapidly progressing pneumonia with sepsis, often in children or healthy young adults [20] . Antimicrobial agents with consistent in vitro activity against CA-MRSA isolates include vancomycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, daptomycin, tigecycline, and linezolid. Optimal therapy for MRSA is a subject of current debate in light of increasing minimum inhibitory concentrations for vancomycin [64, 65] . Post hoc subgroup analysis of clinical trials for health care-associated pneumonia found that linezolid treatment in the subgroups found to have MRSA was associated with improved survival compared with vancomycin [66] . Prospective trials are ongoing to determine whether a difference truly exists. Daptomycin is inactivated by pulmonary surfactant, so it would not be appropriate for empiric therapy of pneumonia. Although it is not necessary to provide empiric coverage of MRSA for all pneumonia cases, it should be strongly considered for patients with severe pneumonia associated with sepsis, especially persons with concurrent influenza, contact with someone infected with MRSA, or radiographic evidence of necrotizing pneumonia.",

Depending on their level of activity, comorbid conditions, history is designated as having health care-associated pneumonia, which is associated with a greater likelihood of resistant pathogens, such as Pseudomonas and MRSA. Mortality is also higher than with CAP [67] . It is appropriate to give broader spectrum empiric therapy to patients with health care-associated pneumonia, usually with a combination of antimicrobial agents to increase the chance that at least one antibiotic is active against the causative pathogen. Appropriate combinations include an antipseudomonal b-lactam agent, such as piperacillin/tazobactam, cefepime, imipenem or meropenem, combined with either an aminoglycoside or a fluoroquinolone and vancomycin or linezolid to cover for MRSA [68] . Studies of antiviral agents for influenza have generally focused on uncomplicated cases, but the impact of treatment on patients hospitalized with influenza or bacterial complications of influenza is less clear. It is reasonable to add antiviral treatment for pneumonia patients with positive antigen or culture-positive influenza or begin empiric treatment in patients with compatible clinical findings when influenza is in the community [1] . Neuraminidase inhibitors, such as oseltamivir, are a better choice than amantadine and rimantadine because they are active against influenza A and B and because many strains currently circulating in the United States are resistant to these older agents [69, 70] .",

Because of the potential toxicity of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim (TMP/SMX), empiric treatment with this agent for well-appearing outpatients with a low probability of PCP is generally not recommended. An empiric trial of a macrolide may be indicated for treatment of mild CAP in a patient at low risk for PCP (eg, recent CD4 count O350/mm 3 ). Any deterioration on outpatient oral antibiotics should prompt admission for a more extensive evaluation. Some emergency physicians initiate oral outpatient therapy with TMP/SMX or an alternate drug for patients with a high probability of PCP and favorable clinical parameters, but this should only be done if a patient can be followed closely for continued diagnostic evaluation and observation for toxicity. It is best done in consultation with the patient's continuing care physician.",

Certain patients also might be brought back to the ED for follow-up in 24 hours, either in person or by telephone. An outpatient regimen of an oral respiratory fluoroquinolone is another option that may be advantageous for moderately ill patients who are considered borderline for hospitalization. These agents have more reliable activity against drug-resistant S pneumoniae and good oral absorption that provides serum levels comparable to parenteral therapy [71] .",

Most patients who have pneumonia and present to the ED can be safely discharged home on empiric oral antimicrobial agents with minimal diagnostic testing. Emergency physicians must be skilled at identifying patients who may require more extensive diagnostic testing, have severe sepsis/septic shock, are at risk for opportunistic infections such as PCP, and for whom empiric therapy should be expanded to cover less common organisms, such as CA-MRSA. Empiric antibiotics should be initiated in the ED, but using arbitrary time cutoffs for initiating antibiotics as a quality measure for patients ultimately diagnosed as having pneumonia is problematic. Decisions regarding hospital admission and level of care are central to emergency medicine practice and can be aided with prognostic models. It is also important to initiate infection control measures in the ED when appropriate.",
