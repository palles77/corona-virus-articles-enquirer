            "text": "Pathogens which are classed as emerging or re-emerging are identified through global surveillance programmes and organizations such as the World Health Organization (WHO). Although labelled 'emerging', most of these pathogens are not new and have either been quiescent in the environment until the conditions are opportune to emerge or have evolved from a parent organism to adapt to the prevailing conditions. Thus, there is an intricate relationship between the environment, the climate, wildlife and human existence and lifestyle. The coronaviruses exemplify this point: the ancestral virus possibly existed approximately 10 000 years ago [1] . Coronaviruses have a wide species range infecting birds, bats, chickens, pigs, dogs, cats and rodents [2] . However, the first human coronavirus was described only in the 1960s [3, 4] , and the coronavirus causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was discovered only in 2003 [5] [6] [7] , while that causing Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) first emerged in 2012 [8] . It is likely that warm-blooded flying birds and bats have co-evolved with the coronaviruses to aid dissemination [9] . For example, SARS is thought to have first infected Old World bats, then spreading to horseshoe bats [10] , civets and finally to man [11] . In the 2003 outbreak of SARS in China and adjacent countries, phylogenetic analysis suggested that the virus spread from bats to humans, possibly through the intermediary civet species. Neither bats or civets showed any clinical signs of infection, and it is thought that bats are the main zoonotic reservoirs for the virus [12] .",

            "text": "NIAID [14] and CDC [15] also publish lists of pathogens of priority which comprise bacteria and viruses, but categorize these into three groups depending on pathogenicity, accessibility and the availability of vaccines and therapies. All the viruses listed by the WHO also occur on these lists, alongside bacterial pathogens of concern. One of these is Yersinia pestis, causative of bubonic and pneumonic plague, which is recognized by all three bodies (WHO, CDC, NIAID) as a current priority following the exceptionally large and serious outbreak between September 2017 to April 2018 in Madagascar [16] , where the disease is endemic. In addition, NIAID recognizes the added threat to human health posed by the acquisition of AMR by pathogens and WHO has also published a priority list [17] of bacterial species for which R&D is required to develop new antibiotics (Table 2) . Globally, there are many regions of endemic disease which are maintained by reservoirs of zoonotic pathogens in the local wild animal species. These pathogens comprise viral, bacterial and rickettsial species and some have complex lifecycles, infecting an environmental (e.g. standing water) or animal reservoir and then being transmitted either by direct contact with man or indirectly, via an insect (e.g. mosquito) or mammalian (e.g. bat, civet, camel) vector, to man, from which they may be spread by human-tohuman transmission. (Fig. 1 ). An example of a serious and widespread bacterial infection is mosquito-transmitted Plasmodium falciparum, causing malaria in many tropical regions. Malaria causes significant morbidity and co-morbidity in these regions in which it is endemic. Due to the complex life cycle of the causative bacterium, it has been challenging to achieve a vaccine for malaria. The most advanced candidate is the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine [18] , which is undergoing a pilot implementation in three countries in sub-Saharan Africa, with a view to determining its impact on disease prior to a wider implementation [19] . Despite the availability of approved vaccines [20, 21] , typhoid fever and cholera remain significantly debilitating enteric diseases in regions of the world where hygienic living conditions are poor and there is little access to health care. Both infections are caused by bacteria (Salmonella typhi and Vibrio cholera, respectively) which exist in contaminated water and food. Tuberculosis (TB) is a respiratory infection which is widespread globally. Caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and transmitted to man from zoonotic reservoirs (badgers, cattle) with a high potential for subsequent human-to-human transmission, TB is prevalent in susceptible individuals living in overcrowded conditions [22] . Although the BCG vaccine has been in routine use for many years, variable efficacy has been reported, depending on region of use [23, 24] with 60-80% reported in the United Kingdom but lower levels in equatorial countries. The emergence of multi-drugresistant TB (MDR TB) in recent years raises the bar for treatment of this disease and makes a high level of vaccine efficacy even more important [25] . Examples of zoonotic reservoirs which maintain endemic viral diseases are numerous and are summarized in Table 3 . In particular, viral endemic disease is caused by the coronaviruses (MERS and SARS) in Saudi Arabia and the Eastern Mediterranean countries; and by the Lassa arenavirus, which is endemic in West African countries and caused a serious outbreak of Lassa fever in Nigeria in 2018 [26] ; other viruses which are endemic and cause viral haemorrhagic fever include dengue, which is widespread in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide [27] , the filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg) which have a zoonotic reservoir in bats in sub-Saharan Africa [28] ; and yellow fever virus, which is prevalent in Africa, Central and South America and the Caribbean [29] . Interestingly, the same mosquito (Aedes aegypti) which spreads yellow fever virus also transmits the dengue, chikungunya and zika viruses [30] . Chikungunya virus has a widespread distribution in Africa, Asia, India and South America and with occasional cases in Europe, and causes a debilitating, but rarely fatal, disease [31] . Zika virus emerged in Brazil in 2015 [32] , although it was first detected in monkeys in Uganda as early as 1947 [33] , and the first documented human case occurred in Nigeria in 1954 [34] . The large Brazilian outbreak of Zika viral disease culminated in 2017, with thousands of cases reported [35] . Rift Valley Fever Virus (RVFV) is another zoonotic virus which is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa and primarily infects cattle, sheep and goats, but can be transmitted to man by mosquito bite to cause an acute fever [36] . An example of a bacterium which has been classed as a re-emerging pathogen and which is endemic in global regions is Y. pestis, causative of plague. Bubonic [37] [38] [39] . Over thousands of years, Y. pestis has evolved away from the enteric yersinia species to become a lethal flea-transmitted bacterium [40] . It is transmitted to man, typically from a zoonotic reservoir in infected rats or other rodents (e.g. ground squirrels or prairie dogs), by flea-bite to cause bubonic plague [41] (Fig. 2 ). If not detected and treated, this can develop into either septicemic plague or the most serious form of all, a secondary pneumonic plague. In turn, individuals with pneumonic plague can transmit this by aerosol droplet to others, to establish a primary pneumonic plague infection. Each year, a few cases of plague are also reported in the Southwestern United States, where the disease has been endemic in the rodent population since the late 1800s [42] . As well as infecting the rodent population, infected fleas can spread Y. pestis to other wildlife species (e.g. rabbits/hares or, rarely, domesticated animals [43] ) which, in turn, raises the potential of transmission to man by inhalation to cause a primary pneumonic plague. In endemic areas, outbreaks of plague are often associated with seasonal environmental changes, causing rodents to stray closer to human habitation. The plague outbreak in Madagascar during 2017/18 was particularly serious, with an estimated 2671 cases and 239 deaths (8\u00b79% fatality rate) [44] . This outbreak was approximately sixfold greater than usual, with an unusual predominance of pneumonic, rather than bubonic plague.",

In the PEP and PET contexts, the benefit of vaccination vastly outweighs the risk of disease (i.e. the risk : benefit ratio is low), while in the prophylactic context the risk : benefit ratio may be greater than, or equal to, 1\u00b70). For infections with short incubation times, e.g. less than 72 h, as for pneumonic plague, PEP or PET vaccination may only be useful if administered under antibiotic cover. In the United States, once a vaccine candidate has been thoroughly tested for safety in non-clinical models, and in an escalating-dose, statistically powered, Phase I design in the clinic, from then on it may be possible to pursue approval for an EUA, rather than pursue the full-length pathway to biological licensing authorization (BLA). This can enable the earlier availability of vaccines for use in endemic regions. However, it should be noted that EUA is only available through the Food and Drug Agency (FDA) in the United States. Some alternative regulatory mechanisms that may be considered prior to licensing are outlined below.",

As this is the first time the candidate is being used in man, the Phase I trial is typically small and cautious. If a range of dose-levels is being tested, it may be necessary to dose a sentinel group of single subjects from each arm of the study to assess safety through week 1 of immunization and starting at the lowest level before proceeding to the next level. The data from the sentinel group would be reviewed before proceeding with the main study. Then the first cohort would be dosed at the lowest level before proceeding to the next level, and so on. Volunteers will be closely monitored for adverse effects in the clinic at each dosing time-point and will typically maintain a diary at home to record any symptoms arising between time-points. An independent safety monitoring panel, including medically qualified personnel, will be required to monitor the reporting of adverse effects. Volunteers may also be blood-sampled to assess vaccine immunogenicity from baseline and serial samples, and depending on vaccine type may be required to supply additional samples which can be collected non-invasively, e.g. saliva/stool samples.

As long as effective biosurveillance programmes are in place to instigate a rapid response to new infections in an unvaccinated placebo cohort, the latter group may be included in a prophylactic efficacy trial. Conversely, reactive mode vaccination in the context of an actual outbreak is likely to be more complicated, as it would be unethical to omit anyone at risk of infection from the vaccination programme. Hence, sufficient safety data on the candidate vaccine would be required in case of need to administer it to pregnant/nursing mothers, children and elderly people as well as to the general adult population. Additionally, it may be necessary to administer an adjunct to the vaccine, such as an appropriate antibiotic, to both cohorts (vaccinated and placebo).

For some vaccines, the induction of a cellular memory response instead of, or in addition to, circulating antibody will provide the correlate.
