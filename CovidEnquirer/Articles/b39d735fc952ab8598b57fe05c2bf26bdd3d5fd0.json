In this study, we examined knowledge of SPs and IC among clinical students attending the King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, we targeted clinical students from the following five colleges: Medicine (fifth and sixth years); Dentistry (second semester of the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth years); Applied Medical Sciences (third and fourth years); Nursing (third and fourth years); and Pharmacy (third, fourth, and fifth years). The data collection instrument was an adopted 41-item questionnaire that measured knowledge of SPs and IC in five domains. A score of \u226524 (60%) indicated sufficient knowledge. Results: The participants comprised 129 students (67 men). The proportions of participants from each college were: Medicine, 58.1% (n = 75); Dentistry, 14% (n = 18); Applied Medical Sciences, 13.2% (n = 17); Nursing, 10.9% (n = 14); and Pharmacy, 3.9% (n = 5). Most students (73.6%) demonstrated sufficient knowledge (men, 67.2% and women, 80.6%). The highest scores were obtained for the domains \"general concept of SPs\", \"hand hygiene\", and \"personal protective equipment\", whereas the lowest scores were obtained for \"disposal of and injuries from sharp objects\" and \"health-care providers' care\". The main information source was formal curricular teaching. Conclusions: In Saudi Arabia, students' knowledge of SPs and IC is satisfactory, with no significant differences between the sexes or between colleges. Thus, formal curricular teaching is an effective way to increase students' knowledge of SPs and IC.",

A recent literature review revealed that only one study, conducted in 2012 at the King Faisal University, Al-Ahsa, Saudi Arabia, has examined knowledge of SPs among Saudi-Arabian medical students in their clinical years [2] . The researchers reported that participants' knowledge was low, and that self-directed learning and informal bedside practices were the main sources of knowledge. In contrast, many studies have addressed this crucial aspect of IC worldwide. In 2008, a study conducted at Rouen University, Normandy, France, reported differing levels of knowledge for different categorized domains (e.g., hand hygiene, nosocomial infection, and SPs) [3] . The study targeted four specialties (Medicine, Nursing, Radiography, and Physiotherapy). The best scores were related to SPs, and the university curriculum was the primary source of students' knowledge. Another study conducted in 2014 at the University of Tirana, Tirana, Albania, demonstrated that students in four specialties (Medicine, Physiotherapy, Radiography, and Nursing) had a moderate knowledge of IC [4] . Formal, in-class training was their main information source.",

We analyzed the data using Raosoft software (Raosoft, Inc., Seattle, WA, USA) with a margin of error of 5% and a confidence interval of 95%.

The adopted questionnaire examined demographic data, information sources, and five domains consisting of 41 items measuring students' knowledge of SPs and IC. Demographic information included sex, college, and year. The five domains comprised: general concept of IC and SPs (five questions); hand hygiene (10 questions); personal protective equipment (PPE; nine questions); disposal of and injuries from sharp objects (eight questions); and health-care providers' care (nine questions). The questions were closed-ended true/false (34 questions) or multiple-choice questions (seven questions). Each correct answer was worth one point (maximum score, 41 points).

The participants of this study demonstrated acceptable knowledge compared with the participants of the study conducted at King Faisal University (73.6% vs. 26.7%, respectively) [2] . In this study, the primary information source reported by students was formal curricular teaching, consistent with the findings of Tavolacci et al. [3] and Bello et al. [11] . However, this result contrasted with that of the study performed at King Faisal University, which reported self-directed learning and informal, bedside practice as the main information sources [2] . This may explain the difference in knowledge levels between this study and the study conducted at King Faisal University.",

In the study performed at King Faisal University, hand hygiene and health-care providers' care were the most well-known domains, whereas management of sharp objects and PPE were the least well-known [2] . In contrast, Tavolacci et al. [3] reported that SPs and hand hygiene were the most well-known domains, whereas nosocomial infection knowledge was the least well-known. These findings show that knowledge of how to handle sharp objects requires improvement; therefore, the curriculum should be amended to increase its emphasis of these issues. Furthermore, IC should be introduced to health sciences students prior to their clinical phase. In this study, the highest proportion of individuals demonstrating sufficient knowledge was found among nursing students, consistent with the findings of Tavolacci et al. [3] and Garc\u00eda-Zapata et al. [12] .",
