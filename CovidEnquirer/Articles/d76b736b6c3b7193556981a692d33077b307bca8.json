Morbidity and mortality in infected neonatal piglets <5 days of age approaches 95% because of the severe diarrhoea and dehydration. Histological lesions are characterised by villous atrophy and fusion in the jejunum and ileum . In the Republic of Korea, there has been high incidence of diarrhoea and death in neonatal piglets associated with PEDV infection and this has become a major economic concern .",
