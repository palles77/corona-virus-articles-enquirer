As controls, sera from 166 patients with intestinal and non-intestinal conditions associated with immunological abnormalities were tested. 30 sera from healthy age-matched children were also studied. Results are reported in the Both IFL-AGA and ELISA-AGA were more sensitive than Rj-ARA (p<001). However, Rj-ARA were strictly confined to CCD, as was IFL-AGA, while ELISA-AGA were occasionally found in control patients. IFL-AGA and ELISA-AGA showed a very similar sensitivity, while IFL-AGA were slightly more specific than ELISA-AGA. Unlike Unsworth et al we could not find IFL-AGA in groups other than CCD. The low prevalences of IFL-AGA and ELISA-AGA and RI -AGA found by us in the gluten-free diet CCD subgroup are probably due to the fact that our patients were tested after a longer period (1 year instead of 3 months). Both sensitivity and specificity of IgA and IgG antibodies were identical for IFL-AGA, while IgG ELISA-AGA were more sensitive than IgA ELISA-AGA (p<0.01) but less specific. On the whole, IFL-AGA and ELISA-AGA gave similar results in the diagnosis of CCD. The choice of test will depend on the facilities available in each laboratory. pain may be a common presenting symptom of carcinoma of the colon. We believe this to be especially true in elderly patients.",

Of the patients admitted to the geriatric ward with colonic carcinoma 39 -8% complained of abdominal pain, whilst of those admitted to the surgical ward 60% complained of abdominal pain. Of patients with rectal carcinoma 25% of those admitted to the geriatric ward and 28% of those admitted to the surgical ward had abdominal pain.

The classic triad of altered bowel habit, rectal bleeding, and tenesmus in rectal carcinoma was present in only 50% of the surgical patients. Tenesmus in particular was an uncommon symptom, being complained of by only 1 patient admitted to the geriatric department. It is thus important to consider the diagnosis of colorectal carcinoma in elderly patients who present with ill-defined symptoms rather than rely on the classical presentation of these conditions. The code for heteromorphisms described by AgNOR is: L=large, M=medium, S=small, -= inactive. GTG stained slides were scored for satellite stalk and short arm length (I= long, m= medium, s = short, -= absent stalk, p+=long, p = normal, p -= absent p arm). QFQ stained slides were scored for satellite intensity after Pans nomenclature (1=negative, 2 = pale, 3= medium, 4= intense, 5 = brilliant).'

These regions at or near the centromere are useful for linkage analysis because of their position and constitutive heterochromatin composition both of which preclude crossing over. The variants were identified at high resolution by sequential staining with G-banding and silver of the nucleolar organising region (NOR) or G and Q banding. In all eleven families, the chromosome 15 donated by the father was identified as the chromosome in which the deletion had occurred (table). Both sets of parents' chromosomes were normal; thus all chromosome deletions were de novo. The probability that the father would donate the chromosome resulting in the deletion in all cases in our sample by chance was less than 1 in 1000 (&frac12;)11. Why should the deletion affect only the chromosome donated by the father? The continued proliferation of male gametogenesis makes this stage more vulnerable to environmental insult than is female meiosis, which is arrested for a long period. If chromosome 15 is sensitive to a particular environmental agent, there may be a greater chance for chromosomal breakage to occur. One possible agent is human coronavirus. One or more loci for sensitivity to human coronavirus 229E have been identified on the long arm (qll-qter) of chromosome 15 by cell hybridisation.8 This finding of paternal origin of deletions in PWS suggests that other deletion syndromes -be investigated to establish whether paternal origin of de novo deletions is more widespread. insulin-dependent diabetes with no known precipitating factors the study of genetic and immunological factors is of considerable interest.
