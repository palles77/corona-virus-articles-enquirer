Results are presented in Fig. 2 . Within the first 8 d after withdrawal of CsA therapy, 5 of 10 animals exhibited cytotoxic T cell activity. Of the five animals who showed cytotoxic T cell activity, two animals had evidence of clinically significant syngeneic GVHD, as manifested by erythroderma of the ears, and dermatitis. The diagnosis was confirmed histologically. The remaining three animals had histological evidence of syngeneic GVHD. No evidence of the syngeneic GVHD syndrome was present in the five animals that did not exhibit spleen cell-mediated lysis of the test target cells. Among animals tested 14-28 d after cessation of CsA therapy, 15 of 19 animals had demonstrated this cytotoxic activity against Lewis, ACI, and BN blast cells. 12 of the 15 animals had clinical and histological evidence of syngeneic GVHD, the remaining 3 had minimal GVHD-like histological changes. Of the 4 of 19 animals that did not demonstrate any significant spleen cell-mediated cytotoxic activity, two showed no histological evidence of syngeneic GVHD, while the remaining two had histological evidence compatible with mild GVHD. The spleens from these two animals were very fibrotic, with limited cell recovery. In the animals that were tested 32-44 d after CsA therapy was stopped, five of eight animals exhibited cytotoxic T cell activity and also showed histological evidence of syngeneic GVHD. Of the remaining three animals, which did not exhibit significant cytotoxic activity, only one showed histological evidence of syngeneic GVHD. In all, 28 of 37 animals treated with CsA following a syngeneic marrow transplant exhibited clinical and/or histologic evidence of the syngeneic GVHD-iike syndrome. Of the 28 animals with this syndrome, 25 demonstrated cytotoxic activity to Lewis, ACI, and/or BN target cells. The remaining nine CsA-treated syngeneic marrow recipients, without the syndrome, did not have this activity. The presence of the cytotoxic activity was significantly (P < 0.001) associated with the incidence of the GVHD-Iike syndrome. Spleen cell-mediated cytotoxic activity from nontransplanted animals that had been treated wtih CsA, and nontransplanted animals treated with the control diluent was assessed. The regimen of CsA or control diluent therapy was identical to that for the syngeneic marrow recipients. Table I demonstrates that the nylon wool-nonadherent spleen cells from these two groups were not capable of mediating significant lysis of ACI, Lewis, or BN target cells. Table II summarizes the results of NK activity for the four experimental groups. NK activity in animals receiving syngeneic transplants and treated with CsA was significantly (P <0.01) elevated compared to the syngeneic marrow transplant recipient not treated with CsA. Animals that received syngeneic marrow transplants, were treated with CsA, and later exhibited histological evidence of syngeneic GVH D had no significantly different N K activity compared to animals that received the same treatments, but showed no histological signs of GVHD. In comparison, nontransplanted animals that received either the control diluent or CsA had levels of NK activity comparable to the control non-CsA-treated syngeneic marrow recipients.",

A perplexing observation is that the effector cells associated with the syngeneic GVHD are capable of lysing blast cells from several strains of rats in an apparently unrestricted fashion. The strains used here do not share class II antigens, but have distinct atlotypes with respect to both class I and class II histocompatibility antigens. Two hypotheses can be formulated to account for our results; the polyclonal activation of class II-reactive cells, including autoreactive cells; or the development of a cytotoxic effector cell with apparent multiple specificity (to \"private\" antigenic epitopes?). Cold target-inhibition studies support the latter hypothesis, since both ACI and Lewis cold targets were equally effective at inhibiting the lysis of either ACI or Lewis labelled target cells, although crossreactivity within the rat class II determinants cannot be totally excluded. Another hypothesis is that the effector cell is recognizing a common determinant (\"public\" epitope) of a class II (or related) antigen shared by many strains of rats. This hypothesis has some merit, since crossreactivity among the rat major histocompatibility antigens has been reported, including antigenic similarity of the B chain of class II molecules from independent rat haplotypes (22). However, the splenic T lymphocytes from rats with the syngeneic GVHD-iike syndrome, in the majority of instances, mediated equivalent levels of lysis regardless of the target cell used (ACI, BN, or Lewis). If crossreactivity was solely responsible for our results, it would seem likely that there would be differences in the ability of the effector cells to lyse the different targets. Further studies are needed to clarify this issue.",

Although there was a highly significant association of syngeneic GVHD with the development of anti-Iaspecific cytotoxic T cells, it remains unknown whether these cells are the mediators of this syndrome or require other interacting T cell-subsets. Studies are currently underway to adoptively transfer syngeneic GVHD by transferring cell populations enriched for this killer T cell. In the studies of Cheney and Sprent (23) using a murine model of CsA-induced syngeneic GVHD, a striking decrease in overall thymic Ia expression was observed, compared to control transplanted animals. The results of our studies could explain their findings, in that the anti-Ia cytotoxic T cells eliminated the cells bearing the class II antigens. It may also be, that in syngeneic GVHD, reduced thymic Ia expression resulted in a failure of T lymphocyte maturation, with the subsequent induction of Ia\u00b0 specific cytotoxic T cells.",

The integrity of thymic tissue appears to be a critical factor. The importance of the thymus in the induction of syngeneic GVHD is supported by the results of Glazier et ai. (15, 21) . Despite comparable CsA therapy, syngeneic GVHD could not be induced if the thymus was shielded during irradiation. This is in contrast to the consistent development of GVHD seen in CsA-treated rats given total body irradiation without shielding the thymus. The development of syngeneic GVHD is not limited to CsA-treated animals, since Van Bekkum and DeVries (24) described the development of syndromes similar to syngeneic and autologous GVHD in neonatally thymectomized animals, and in animals that received additional irradiation to the thymus. Further studies implying a role for thymic integrity in the induction of syngeneic GVHD are those in which nontransplanted, nonirradiated animals treated with CsA do not develop the syndrome, and anti-Ia cytotoxic T cells cannot be found. This is in spite of the fact that CsA treatment of both transplanted and nontransplanted animals leads to remarkable thymic changes, with rapid depletion of medullary lymphocytes (21). It is tempting to speculate that CsA alters the educational process, or accentuates a maturational failure of T lymphocytes in the irradiated thymus that allows the development of polyclonal or self-anti-Ia-reactive cells. Whether radiation damage to the thymus, or depletion of normal thymocytes, in combination with CsA therapy leads directly to development of the polyclonal or self-class II-reactive cytotoxic T cells and the development of syngeneic GVHD remains unknown. It remains possible that generation of class II-reactive cytotoxic T cells is a normal part of the ongoing differentiation in the thymus, controlled by intrathymic regulatory events, and that CsA abates this regulatory influence. The syngeneic GVHD syndrome would only appear after radiation damage to the thymus or depletion of normal thymocytes, including a regulatory subset that controls the generation of autoreactive cells. The regulatory influence of the host has been shown (15, 21) . Adoptive transfer of normal syngeneic spleen cells with spleen cells from animals suffering from syngeneic GVHD into irradiated Lewis recipients did not prevent the development of syngeneic GVHD. However, transfer of spleen cells from animals with syngeneic GVHD into normal, unirradiated recipients apparently prevented the development of this syndrome, implicating some facet of host regulation that remains unidentified.",
