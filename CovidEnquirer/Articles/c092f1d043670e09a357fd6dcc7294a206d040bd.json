In the present study we aimed at assessing NDV and IBV prevalences in Ivory-Coast by molecular screening of N22,000 avian swabs by nested PCR and by serology testing of close to 2000 avian sera from 2010 through 2012. The NDV and IBV seroprevalences over the study period reached 22% and 72%, respectively. We found 14.7% pooled swabs positive by PCR for NDV and 14.6% for IBV. Both pathogens are therefore endemic in Ivory-Coast. Economic losses associated with NDV and IBV infections still need to be evaluated.",

The infectious agent of ND, Newcastle disease virus (NDV), is a single stranded, non-segmented, negativesense RNA virus belonging to the order Mononegavirales, family Paramyxoviridae, sub-family Paramyxovirinae, and genus Avulavirus (Lamb and Parks, 2007; Cattoli et al., 2011) . However, only virulent strains of NDV cause ND when they infect birds. This genus contains at least 9 serogroups of avian paramyxoviruses (APMV-1 to -9) previously described and recently 3 more serogroups have been added: APVM10 (Miller et al., 2010) , APMV11 (Briand et al., 2012) and APVM12 (Terregino et al., 2013) . According to their virulence in poultry, APMV-1 isolates can be grouped into three pathotypes: lentogenic, mesogenic or velogenic (Alexander, 1997; Cattoli et al., 2009 ). The velogenic strains may cause 100% mortality in infected chicken flocks (Kho et al., 2000) ; they are further classified as neurotropic or viscerotropic based on their pathological manifestations (Alexander, 1998; Wise et al., 2004) . Mesogenic strains cause primarily respiratory disease while lentogenic isolates are of low virulence and may cause mild respiratory or enteric infections. The virulent NDV isolates (mesogens and velogens) are notifiable agents that require reporting to the OIE (OIE, 2000) .",

It is a highly contagious upper-respiratory tract disease of chickens.

It belongs to the family Coronaviridae and subfamily Coronavirinae within the genera of Gammacoronaviridae (Jackwood et al., 2012) . Clinical signs of IB disease in chickens are watery eyes, mucus in the nares and trachea, gasping, coughing, and tracheal rales. The disease can also cause a decrease in egg production and egg quality and some strains of the virus can cause an interstitial nephritis (Jackwood et al., 2012) . Morbidity is close to 100%, while mortality can be variable, ranging from 14% to 82%, depending on the age of the birds, strain of the virus and secondary infections (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008) .",

A recent study undertaken on chickens from commercial farms, live bird markets and backyard farms in Nigeria and Niger revealed the presence of IBV genome. Phylogenetic analysis of the S1 coding sequence revealed a new genotype of IBV. This strain did not cross-react with antisera against known strains such as IT02, M41, D274 or Connecticut in virus neutralisation tests . In Ivory-Coast, poultry technicians report on a regular basis the presence of IB in commercial farms and recommend the use of vaccine, mainly based on the M41 strain, although there is no prior study of the presence of IBV in the country or on the type of strains circulating. These reports, based on clinical signs, were never confirmed by the laboratory.",

From that date on a continuous surveillance of poultry farms, both backyard and commercial production systems, has been implemented. Every month, the team of the Virology Laboratory was sent to the field to collect tracheal and cloacal swabs and serum samples. These samples were collected in the southern regions (Agneby, District of Abidjan, South Comoe), which are the biggest large-scale poultry production areas in the country. In addition, the south-eastern region (South Comoe) includes lakes and rivers with large populations of various water bird species (Fig. 1) . The sampling was carried out following a validated protocol previously described with data from 2007 through 2009 previously reported (Couacy-Hymann et al., 2012a) . In each region, a minimum of 5 villages were randomly selected from a known list of villages. In addition, following the same protocol, 5 commercial farms were selected per region. However, any commercial farm, having reported any diseases to the veterinary field technician, was systematically included in the survey (in addition to the 5 commercial farms randomly selected). Within a selected village, any backyard poultry's owner having a poultry flock (flock size varying between 5 and 20 birds per household) was systematically included in the survey. At live bird markets (mainly one big live market per region), 5 vendors were randomly selected (average number of vendors per market = 10). In addition, farmers were interviewed regarding the case mortality that occurred on their farms.",

The procedure for RNA isolation was as recommended by the manufacturer, using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Germany). The RNA was eluted in 50 \u03bcL of nuclease-free water. The RT step was performed by using random hexamer primers (Introgen, Carlsbad, CA., USA) with 10 \u03bcL of extracted RNA and the First-strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (GE Healthcare Europe GmBH, Orsay, France) as recommended by the manufacturer's protocol. Then, 5 \u03bcL of the cDNA obtained was used as the template for the PCR step with each outer set of primers specific for NDV F (Kho et al., 2000) or IBV S1 (Akin et al., 2001) . Conventional PCR was carried out with the GeneAmp PCR System 2400 (Perkin-Elmer, Applied-Biosystems, Paris, France) using a 50 \u03bcL reaction mixture as previously described (Couacy-Hymann et al., 2012b; Kho et al., 2000; Akin et al., 2001) .

This situation greatly affected local poultry industries along with the loss of an important source of proteins for middle income and poor populations. Interestingly, the avian crisis highlighted the importance of ND (of which the main concern is the velogenic form) alongside other respiratory diseases such as IB. We took advantage of the ongoing surveillance for avian influenza virus within Ivory-Coast which followed the detection of 12 outbreaks of H5N1 . Birds that were sampled were clinically examined for any signs of disease. Animals showing clinical signs were included in the survey along with dead animals found on the site of sampling. The collected samples were screened for avian influenza virus type A RNA and for specific subtype H5, H7 and H9 antibodies and the overall result remained negative (Couacy-Hymann et al., 2012b) .",

The study has demonstrated the importance of ND in these mainly rural areas with poor populations, whose backyard poultry farms contribute significantly to household income and so contribute to poverty alleviation. Particularly, essentially all chickens found dead or sick were positive for NDV genome, with 96.3% prevalence. Partial sequencing of the F gene from samples collected on dead chickens showed the presence of polybasic sequence at the F protein cleavage site, corresponding with that expected for a velogenic strain of NDV. NDV-specific antibody prevalence ranged from 18.2% to 29.3% over the period of the study, with an overall average value of 21.6%, while the NDV F gene detection gave an overall prevalence of 14.7%, showing widespread distribution of the virus even among apparently healthy animals. These results confirm a previous study undertaken in Ivory-Coast on the burden of NDV in backyard poultry units, when compared to commercial farms where vaccinations are implemented in a correctly and thoroughly applied programme (Couacy-Hymann et al., 2012a) . In rural regions, no vaccination against NDV is implemented on free range poultry. Among the three avian species studied, chickens, with 22.1% seroprevalence, are of main concern. The widespread nature of NDV in these populations contributes to the maintenance of the endemic pattern of the disease, causing mass seasonal death and impacting negatively on food security and poverty alleviation in those rural populations.",

            "text": "If ND is well known and studied in Africa, this is not the case with IB, which remains less investigated, with few data available presently . Cases of IB are reported mainly from commercial layer farms based on clinical signs such as respiratory distress, decline of the egg production, and damage of the shape of the eggs. Vaccination against the disease is strongly recommended in commercial poultry farms. Although field veterinary personnel and rural farmers report from time to time cases of low egg size or change of the shape of the eggs, any respiratory signs in the field are associated with, and reported as, ND. Little is also known on IB in backyard poultry units, since ND is still reported as the most important disease in that type of poultry farm. Our study shows that IBV is widespread in such units, albeit causing largely inapparent or subclinical infections; the seroprevalence in the period 2010-2012 was 72.3%, much higher than the seroprevalence for NDV, while the prevalence of the viral genomes was similar for the two viruses (12.7% IBV positive, 14.2% NDV positive). Chickens, with a seroprevalence of 74.9%, appear to be the main host of IBV in backyard poultry species. Our results demonstrate the high levels of circulation of IBV in poultry farms in free range (backyard) poultry farms as in commercial farms. Our results are in agreement with previous studies in Nigeria and Senegal, which also found high levels of circulation of IBV in backyard poultry farms, with seroprevalence rates above 70% (Owoade et al., 2006; Emikpe et al., 2010; Ntirandekura, 2011) . The IBV virus itself was so far only reported in Africa in Morocco in 1982 -1983 (el Houadfi and Jones, 1985 ), in Egypt in 2003 (Abdel-Moneim et al., 2006 , and in Nigeria in -2007 , likely more because very few research teams looked for the virus on the continent rather than because it is not present.",

The sequenced NDV F cleavage sites highlighted the circulation of velogenic strains of the virus in the country. Taken together these results suggest that while healthy birds have been detected positive for NDV velogenic strains, the pathogen likely causes severe mortality in the field that may explain a lower seroprevalence for NDV than for IBV. A recent study in domestic poultry reported 8.7% NDV prevalence by virus isolation in Uganda with circulation of mainly velogenic viruses as well. In the Ugandan study, 28.6% (6/21) and 9.0% (108/1229) of the chickens from which NDV could be isolated were sick and healthy, respectively, confirming both the morbidity caused by velogenic NDV in the field and the detection of these strains in asymptomatic birds (Byarugaba et al., 2014) .",
