Besides a standard geometric Brownian motion, another two driving processes are taken into account: a stationary Poisson point process and a continuous-time finite-state Markov chain. The classical harvesting problem for this model is a big difficult puzzle since the corresponding Fokker-Planck equations with three types of noise are very difficult to solve. Our main goal of this paper is to work out the optimization problem with respect to stationary probability density. One of the main contributions is to provide a new equivalent approach to overcome this problem. More precisely, an ergodic method is used to show the almost surely equivalency between the time averaging yield and sustainable yield. Results show that the optimal strategy changes with environment. An interesting thing is that the optimal strategy for each state is equivalent to the global optimality.",

            "text": "Investigations on various logistic-type systems are one of the most important themes in mathematical ecology. Optimal harvesting problem is an important and interesting topic from both biological and mathematical point of view. The optimal harvesting problems have received a lot of attention since Clark's [1, 2] classical works on the following deterministic logistic system with catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) hypothesis: dX (t) = X (t) (a \u2212 bX (t)) dt \u2212 EX (t)dt. (1.1) In Eq. (1.1), X (t) represents the size of population at time t, a denotes the intrinsic growth rate of X (t), a/b is the carrying capacity of the environment, EX (t) is the CPUE hypothesis of harvesting function. Clark showed the optimal harvesting effort for Eq. (1.1) is E * = a/2 and the maximum sustainable yield is a 2 /(4b). The fact that population systems are inevitably subject to various environmental noises is accepted by a large number of scholars, such as [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] and references cited there in. Beddington and May [9] showed the optimal harvesting for natural populations in a randomly fluctuating environment in Science. In their paper, they proved the optimal harvesting effort for dX (t) = X (t) (a \u2212 bX (t)) dt \u2212 EX (t)dt + \u03c3 X (t)dB(t) (1.2) is (a \u2212 \u03c3 2 /2)/2 and the maximum sustainable yield is (a \u2212 \u03c3 2 /2) 2 /(4b). Here, B(t) is a standard Brownian motion defined on a complete probability space (\u2126, F , {F t } t\u22650 , P). \u03c3 2 /2 is the intensity of white noise. In addition, population systems may be affected by another type of environmental noise, namely, color noise or say telegraph noise. This telegraph noise can be illustrated as a switching between two or more sub-regimes of different environments [10, 11] . For instance, the growth rate for some fish in dry season will be much different from it in rainy season. Wang [12] considered color noise on a stochastic logistic model with CPUE hypothesis. He studied the following system dX (t) = X (t) (a (r (t)) \u2212 bX (t)) dt \u2212 EX (t) dt + \u03c3 (r (t)) X (t) dB(t), (1.3) where r(t) is a continuous-time finite-state Markov chain with values in the finite state space S = {1, 2, . . . , N}. For any state i \u2208 S, a(i) and \u03c3 (i) are both positive constants. That is to say, Eq. (1.3) can be considered as a switching between N regimes of Eq. (1.2) . For each regime i \u2208 S, it has different parameters. Results show that the optimal harvesting effort for Eq. (1.3) is",

These sudden environmental shocks will cause jumps in population size, and model (1.3) cannot describe these phenomena exactly. To describe this type of environmental noise, scholars introduce a jumping process into the underlying population dynamics, and use stochastic differential equations (SDEs) driven by jumping processes to explain these phenomena. We regard this type of noise as jumping noise. Rong Situ [13] (see page 32) said ''stochastic perturbation of jumps in a dynamical system usually can be modeled as a stochastic integral with respect to some point processes, i.e. its martingale measure or counting measure''. Motivated by this, we will use a stationary Poisson point process as the driven jumping processes in this paper. Let p (t, \u03c9) represent a stationary F t -adapted Poisson point process. N is the Poisson counting measure generated by p (t, \u03c9). \u03bb is the intensity measure of N which is defined on a finite measurable subset Y \u2282 (0, \u221e). \ueb68 N is the compensated random measure defined by \ueb68 N (dt, du) = N (dt, du) \u2212 \u03bb (du) dt. Consequently, the corresponding stochastic logistic hybrid jump-diffusion process driven by p (t, \u03c9) has the following form:",

The other parameters have the same meanings as models (1.1)-(1.3). Brownian motion B(t), Markov chain r(t) and stationary Poisson point process p (t, \u03c9) are always assumed to be mutually independent and defined on the same complete probability space (\u2126, F , {F t } t\u22650 , P). Markov chain r(t) is assumed to be irreducible since this standing hypothesis implies the hybrid system will switch from any sub-state to any other sub-state. In addition, this assumption also means that Markov chain has a unique stationary distribution [15] \u03c0 = (\u03c0 1 , \u03c0 2 , . . . , \u03c0 N ) \u2208 R 1\u00d7N . Eq.

Naturally, we want to know if this conclusion is valid for all the Markov-switching systems. From the process of proof, it is exactly right when the Markov chain is irreducible. Furthermore, the optimal yield for a hybrid system is equal to the weighted average of every sub-system according to the Markov chain's stationary distribution.

The numerical simulations for each state are based on the method mentioned in paper [14] . Then, for Eq.
