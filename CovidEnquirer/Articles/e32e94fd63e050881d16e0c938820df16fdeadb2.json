We enrolled MERS-CoVpositive patients at a hospital in Saudi Arabia and periodically collected specimens from multiple sites for real-time reverse transcription PCR and serologic testing. We conducted interviews and chart abstractions to collect clinical, epidemiologic, and laboratory information. We found that diabetes mellitus among survivors was associated with prolonged MERS-CoV RNA detection in the respiratory tract. Among case-patients who died, development of robust neutralizing serum antibody responses during the second and third weeks of illness was not sufficient for patient recovery or virus clearance. Fever and cough among mildly ill patients typically aligned with RNA detection in the upper respiratory tract; RNA levels peaked during the first week of illness. These findings should be considered in the development of infection control policies, vaccines, and antibody therapeutics.",

Chest radiographs of 4 G1 patients were described as abnormal, typically with unilateral findings (Appendix 2 the proportion of patients mechanically ventilated appeared to align with the proportion who had detectable MERS-CoV in the LRT (Figure 2 , panel C); only 1 G2 patient (Pt 13, who had underlying pulmonary disease) was MERS-CoV-positive for a short period but required extended mechanical ventilation.

Our findings demonstrate a possible association between DM and prolonged MERS-CoV RNA detection in survivors, when adjusting for severity. The prevalence of DM is high in Saudi Arabia; estimated national prevalence ranges from 14.4% (41) to 18.6% (42). DM is frequently reported among MERS case-patients (7, 43) , is a risk factor for illness among those with primary exposures (13) , and has been associated with increased severity (44) and mortality (26, 44) , as was observed in our study. DM was less frequently reported in MERS patients from South Korea (5, (45) (46) (47) in 2015, and its association with increased severity in that setting was less clear (5, 45) . In our investigation, factors affecting DM management before infection were unknown. Information about MERS-CoV detection and antibody responses in case-patients who died has been limited (19, (24) (25) (26) 29) . In our study, patients who died had robust neutralizing antibody responses during the second and third weeks of illness, but this response was not sufficient for patient recovery. During this same period (weeks 2-3), RNA levels peaked in the LRT of these case-patients, suggesting that antibodies might not be sufficient for virus clearance. Antibodies were more often co-detected with viral RNA in the serum and URT of case-patients who died compared with survivors. Co-detection of antibodies and RNA has been described previously but not by patient outcome (19, 25) . Six patients who died had MERS-CoV RNA in their serum, despite the presence of neutralizing antibodies, and 3 had RNA in urine. Detection of MERS-CoV in blood or serum has previously been associated with need for supplemental oxygen (18) , the need for mechanical ventilation (24) , and death (24, 26) . Although we detected RNA in the blood or serum of all severity groups, estimated viral loads might have been higher in patients who died than survivors; this was difficult to assess statistically because of limited specimen collection and variability in timing of collection. In 4/12 patients who died, RNA levels in the LRT decreased to low or undetectable before death, suggesting that viral replication in the respiratory tract might variably or indirectly contribute to outcome.",

Although most patients in our study developed early and concomitant MN and VSV-MERS-S (pseudoparticle assays) responses, 1 case-patient who died exhibited a prominent delay in detectable VSV-MERS-S and S ELI-SA responses compared with MN. This finding warrants further investigation and might suggest that the MN assay targets antibodies functioning beyond S-specific viral entry. Although our neutralizing assays targeted 2 different MERS-CoV strains, no variations exist within the receptor binding sites of these viruses (Appendix 1 Figure 10 ). Compared with these 2 viruses, the virus strain used in our S ELISA (EMC) differs in S by 2-3 aa, which is unlikely to confer a notable difference in binding during a polyclonal antibody response.",

Similar to previous descriptions, we detected MERS-CoV RNA in the blood or serum of some mildly ill patients (18, 25) , but we also detected RNA in stool up to 15 days after illness onset; viable virus was not isolated from these specimen types. MERS-CoV RNA has been reported in stool previously (19) , but the severity of illness and the time since illness onset in these patients were unknown. Replication in the intestinal tract has been postulated (27) , but its role in pathogenesis or transmission remains unclear.",

First, the number of patients enrolled might have been insufficient to detect some associations, especially when adjusting for other variables. Second, testing data were not available before onset for all but 1 patients, and so we used days from onset to MERS-CoV negativity to assess shedding duration; we also excluded fatal cases from such analyses because time to death was not reflective of shedding duration, meaning that factors associated predominantly with mortality were not assessed for prolonged shedding. Third, the presence of MERS-CoV RNA does not necessarily represent viable virus. Fourth, serum specimen collection was deemed too sparse to reliably assess antibody kinetics at the patient level. Prolonged shedding in those with DM and the detection of MERS-CoV RNA from nonrespiratory specimens, including RNA-positive stool in mildly ill patients, should be considered in infection prevention and control and when determining whether home isolation is appropriate.
