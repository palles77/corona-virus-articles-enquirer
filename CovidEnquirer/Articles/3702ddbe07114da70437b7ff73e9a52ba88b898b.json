Upon infection, DMVs have been shown to harbor the replicase complex of positive-strand RNA viruses such as MHV, poliovirus, and equine arteritis virus. Recently, it has been shown that autophagy proteins are proviral factors that favor initiation of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Here, we identified ATG5 as an interacting protein for the HCV NS5B. ATG5/NS5B interaction was confirmed by co-IP and metabolic labeling studies. Furthermore, ATG5 protein colocalizes with NS4B, a constituent of the membranous web. Importantly, immunofluorescence staining demonstrated a strong colocalization of ATG5 and NS5B within perinuclear regions of infected cells at 2 days postinfection. However, colocalization was completely lacking at 5 DPI, suggesting that HCV utilizes ATG5 as a proviral factor during the onset of viral infection. Finally, inhibition of autophagy through ATG5 silencing blocks HCV replication.",

Recently, the contribution of an autophagy protein, ATG5, to viral replication has been demonstrated (Prentice et al., 2004) . Indeed, production of MHV particles is profoundly reduced (N99%) in ATG5\u2212/\u2212 knockout (KO) embryonic stem cells (Prentice et al., 2004) . In this system, the expression of ATG5 in ATG5\u2212/\u2212 cells restores virus production. The relationship between ATG5 and MHV replication may come from the ability of ATG5 to initiate the formation of DMVs, which have been observed in MHV-infected cells Mizushima et al., 2001) . As seen for dengue virus-2 (DV2), when autophagy is blocked by ATG5-KO MEF cells, extracellular DV2 virus titers are reduced by 3fold compared to those from wild-type MEF cells (Lee et al., 2008) .",

Because HCV replicons replicate autonomously in Huh-7, it has been proposed that the membranous web that contain the HCV replication complexes represents the genuine site of viral replication Moradpour et al., 2003) . In HCV-infected cells, accumulation of lipid droplets, shown to be essential for HCV replication, has been observed in the proximity of the membranous web (Miyanari et al., 2007) . Given the involvement of autophagy at the site of replication of other positive-stranded RNA viruses, are the autophagy proteins or structure involved in HCV replication? In that regard, Tanida et al. (2009) recently showed that Atg7 silencing decreased the levels of infectious HCVcc by about 40%, whereas intracellular HCV RNA and protein levels remained unchanged. At the same time, another group demonstrated that autophagy proteins (ATG4b and Beclin-1) are required only for the initiation of incoming HCV RNA translation/replication ). To identify novel cellular factors that may play an essential role in HCV RNA replication, we have previously screened a human liver cDNA library for proteins interacting with the HCV NS5B RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Here we report that ATG5, a protein required for the formation of DMV in embryonic stem cell (Mizushima et al., 2001) , specifically interacts with HCV NS5B. We propose that the NS5B/ATG5 interaction may be required for the initial onset of HCV replication.",

Two more clones corresponded to the EMBL/GenBank/ DDBJ accession number Y711588a. This gene is highly homologous to the Saccharomyces cerevisiae ATG5 gene (Hammond et al., 1998) . ATG5/NS5B interaction was confirmed in the yeast two-hybrid system using the full-length human ATG5 gene amplified from a human liver cDNA library (Clontech) (Fig. 1) . As a control, a panel of proteins (RAR-\u03b2, RAR-\u03b1, HCV core, and nonstructural protein: NS3 prot , NS3 hel , NS4A, and NS4B) cloned in the GAL4 DNA binding domain was tested for interaction with ATG5.

We used yeast cells in this study because cotransfection of Huh-7 cells with c-myc-NS5B and HAtagged ATG5 resulted in a low level expression of ATG5 protein. Yeast extracts were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal antibody against either the c-myc or the HA tag, followed by separation on SDS-PAGE. As shown in Fig. 2A , an immunoreactive band (lane 2) that corresponds to the size of the NS5B protein (68 kDa; lane 4) was coimmunoprecipitated with ATG5. This band was not present when the extracts were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-5A antibody (lane 1) or without any antibody (Protein A/G sepharose beads alone) (lane 3). The bands corresponding to the 50-and 25-kDa molecular weight are the heavy and light chains, respectively, of the antibody. Conversely, ATG5 was coimmunoprecipitated with NS5B when the same extract was incubated with monoclonal anti-c-myc antibody. Indeed, a distinct immunoreactive band (lane 5) that corresponds to the size of ATG5 (lane 7) was detected. However, this band could not be immunoprecipitated by the monoclonal anti-5A antibody (lane 6). This proteinprotein interaction was further substantiated by the metabolic labeling experiments shown in Fig. 2B in which ATG5 was constitutively expressed and NS5B expression was under a copper-inducible promoter. As expected, when the labeled extracts were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-HA, a prominent band corresponding to the size of ATG5 was detected in yeast extracts under induced (lane 1) and noninduced (lane 2) conditions. However, the band corresponding to NS5B was only detected in lane 1 (induced condition). When the same extracts were immunoprecipitated with monoclonal anti-c-myc antibody, an intense band corresponding to the size of NS5B was apparent under the induced condition (lane 3). As expected, a band corresponding to the size of ATG5 was also detected in the extracts under the induced condition (lane 3) but not under the noninduced condition (lane 4). Taken together, these observations indicate that ATG5 and NS5B interact.",

Thus, we looked at the subcellular membrane association of ATG5 in replicon cells. As expected, both NS5B and ATG5 proteins were excluded from the cytoplasmic fraction (Fig. 4B) . Indeed, both proteins appeared to reside in the microsomal/mitochondrial fractions, suggesting that ATG5 is directed to membranes in replicon cells.

Therefore, infected Huh7 cells were transfected with pEGFP-ATG5 and analyzed at 2 or 5 DPI for the presence of NS5B and ATG5 (Fig. 5A) . To our surprise, a strong colocalization of GFP-ATG5 and NS5B was evident in approximately 80% of infected cells at 2 DPI, but completely disappeared at 5 DPI.

Because viruses such as MHV and perhaps HCV may utilize ATG5 to initiate DMV formation but may not require further maturation of the DMV into autophagosomes, the function of APG12 in virus-induced DMVs remains to be determined.",

In HCV replicon-harboring cells, a membranous structure that contains both viral proteins and RNA, called the membranous web, has been identified . It has been shown that the formation of the membranous web can be induced by NS4B alone (Konan et al., 2003) . Another report has shown physical interaction between NS5B (or NS5A) and the SNARElike protein, hVAP-33 (Tu et al., 1999) , leading to the localization of the HCV replicase complex on lipid rafts (Aizaki et al., 2006; Gao et al., 2004) . Despite these findings, the role of the host factors in the formation and function of the HCV replication complex needs to be better defined. In that regard, we propose that autophagic proteins, and perhaps the resulting membranes, are indispensable during the onset of HCV replication.",

S. cerevisiae Y187 (MAT\u03b1), which contained the pretransformed human cDNA library (complexity N2-4 \u00d7 10 6 independent clones) cloned into the Gal4 activation domain vector (pACT2) was allowed to mate with S. cerevisiae AH109 (MATa), which had been transformed with a Gal4 DNA-binding domain vector (pGBKT7) containing HCV NS5B as a bait. To construct the bait, the HCV NS5B gene lacking the region encoding the C-terminal 21 amino acid residues was amplified by PCR using the HCV-BK (genotype 1b) genomic cDNA as a template and NS5B-H1 and NS5B-R1700 as primers (Table S1 ). The resulting NS5B\u039421 gene containing unique EcoRI and BamHI sites at the N-and C-termini, respectively, was cloned into the pGBKT7 expression plasmid to generate an in-frame fusion protein with a Gal4 DNA binding domain. The resulting plasmid, pGBKT7-5B\u039421 was sequenced and subsequently used to transform the AH109 yeast strain. Following mating, the diploid yeast strain (Y187-AH109-NS5B) was selected on SD medium in the absence of leucine, tryptophan, and histidine (\u2212LTH). Eight hundred potential positive yeast clones were obtained from two million screenable clones and were replica-plated onto X-\u03b1 Gal indicator plates in the absence of leucine, tryptophan, histidine, and adenine. Three hundred blue colonies (positive for X-\u03b1 Gal as a result of MEL1 gene activation) were selected by prototrophy for histidine and adenine. These clones were retested for positive interaction, and pACT2/cDNA plasmids were isolated from 20 strong positive clones as reflected by the intensity of the blue color formed on X-\u03b1 Gal indicator plates. These plasmids were retransformed into yeast strains carrying the bait construct, pGBKT7-5B\u039421 or pGBKT7, to confirm true interactions. Clones that gave a positive signal when cotransformed with pGBKT7-5B\u039421 were chosen for DNA sequencing. The DNA sequences of the positive pACT2/cDNA clones were translated and compared with a nonredundant sequence database using the BLAST program through the National Center for Biotechnology Information network service. CLUSTAL_X program was used to analyze statistically significant matches.",
