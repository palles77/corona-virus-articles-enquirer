Clinical laboratory tests are vital for the correct diagnosis and treatment of individuals. Clinical laboratories analyze blood, urine, mucus, saliva, respiratory secretions, cerebrospinal fluid, semen, vaginal secretions, sweat, feces, fluid aspirated from joints, and tissues from humans and animals. The tests performed include cell counts; analytical chemistries, including drug and toxin tests; and examinations to detect and identify microbes and markers of current and past infection. Environmental testing is critical to the detection of outbreaks, the prevention of disease, and the monitoring of the environment. Environmental laboratories analyze samples of water, food, air, soil, plant material, and unknown powders, as well as samples taken from surfaces for evidence of bacterial, viral, toxin, or chemical contamination.",

Data collected during the preanalytical, analytical, and postanalytical phases of testing can be captured and incorporated directly into biosurveillance systems. Preanalytical data, such as the type of test ordered and the reason for a test, can provide an early clue to the existence of an outbreak. Similarly, analytic results, such as the initial Gram stain of a cerebrospinal fluid specimen, can potentially confirm a diagnosis when combined with other clinical information, as it did in the first case of inhalational anthrax in the 2001 postal attack. The actual results of tests are obviously foundational to biosurveillance.",

The majority of clinical laboratories in the United States are small laboratories located in physician offices; however, the larger laboratories account for a high volume of all tests performed. Table 8 .1 describes the clinical laboratory tests that contribute to the diagnosis of inhalational anthrax. Anthrax, as well as many other infectious diseases, is diagnosed after the performance of presumptive and confirmatory tests in combination with the clinical presentation. Clinical specimens, such as blood, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, sputum, throat swabs, and skin scrapings, are used to isolate a causative agent that is later subjected to further testing with confirmatory procedures to make the final identification. Preliminary tests results are sometimes released before the confirmatory tests results become available. When preliminary results are reported, the report often contains a statement about when final results will be available.",

The CDC's laboratories focus on infectious diseases, occupational diseases, and environmental causes of diseases. The CDC specialized laboratories are in Colorado, Ohio, West Virginia, and Puerto Rico, in addition to its headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. The CDC has led the development of rapid national laboratory reporting systems that have been successfully used to identify multistate outbreaks of diseases ( Bean et al., 1992; Hutwagner et al., 1997) . CDC-based scientists have developed and used new technologies to identify outbreaks of disease in cooperation with state and local public health laboratories. One such example of the successful application of a new technology is known as PulseNet (discussed in Chapters 3 and 5; http:// www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/). PulseNet is a national network of public health laboratories that perform DNA \"fingerprinting\" of foodborne pathogens and clinical isolates to allow matching of isolates. This epidemiological typing method is the basis for detecting clusters of disease that are geographically diffuse, and for linking bacteria found in a specific food to bacteria found in one or more persons with a particular disease. PulseNet permits recognition of outbreaks that previously went undetected. A multistate outbreak of listeriosis in 2000 was identified only after the isolates of Listeria monocytogenes were tested by using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and determined to all have a common PulseNet pattern (CDC, 2000) .",

The classical approach to identification of biologic agents involves direct examination of stained materials by microscopic examination for the presence of agents (DHHS/CDC, n.d.; York, 2003) . Microscopic examination relies on staining characteristics and the size and shape of the organisms found. With few exceptions, it is rarely possible to identify an agent based only on microscopic characteristics. Direct stains may help eliminate organisms from further consideration, but they are usually not sufficient without further testing to identify a pathogen. Wet mounts are used for the direct microscopic examination of clinical materials for fungi and parasitic agents. Additional simple assays take advantage of the ability of an organism to metabolize chemicals or produce chemical reactions that result in color changes of a substrate. Recently, many assay kits have been developed for waived tests. These waived test kits can produce reliable results in most cases; however, one must understand the limitations of these kits and the need for confirmatory testing. Field test kits, often referred to as handheld assays, have become popular with first responders who have a need to know if an unknown material contains a biologic agent or toxic chemical. Simple immunologic reactions, coupled with a colorimetric indicator, form the detection systems for many handheld assays. Validating the performance of handheld assays in comparative studies is a task generally reserved for governmental agencies or contract laboratories (Emanuel et al., 2003) . The major advantage of the simple assays is that they are quick, as a result may be available in 5 to 20 minutes. The short turnaround time makes these tests ideal for use by surveillance systems provided one understands the limitations of the tests and that a method for confirmatory testing is available.",

Many of the definitive and confirmatory assays used today are molecular assays, which detect genetic material that is specific to a bacterium, virus, protozoa, or other organism. Nucleic-acid-based assays rely on the unique differences found in the structure of single strands of DNA and RNA. The unique pattern of bases is specific for a single organism or closely related organisms. The nucleic-acid-based assays involve the use of probes, which are strands of DNA or RNA that match distinctive DNA or RNA patterns of the organism being tested and will bind with that DNA or RNA if it is in the clinical specimen. Once the binding occurs, the binding can be detected by using electrochemical, colorimetric, and optical systems (Committee on Research and Development Needs for Improving Civilian Medical Response to Chemical and Biological Terrorism Incidents, 1999) . This binding provides extreme selectivity between the known probes and the material found in clinical specimens. The use of a technique known as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) makes it is possible to amplify trace quantities of DNA or RNA in a clinical specimen to enable the detection of as few as 1,000 bacteria or viruses.

A phlebotomist attaches the label to a \"purple top\" vial (containing magnesium citrate or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid [EDTA] to prevent the blood from coagulating). The phlebotomist draws the blood after checking carefully that the identification on the labeled tube matches the patient, and sends the sample to the laboratory. Oftentimes, the labeled specimen is transported by pneumatic chute from clinical areas, such as the emergency department, or by express overnight delivery to the laboratory. A technician in the laboratory scans the barcode of the specimen with an optical scanner, which is connected to the LIMS. If the laboratory has an automated analyzer for blood counts, the technician simply places the vial into the specimen carousel of the analyzer. The analyzer recognizes the bar code, communicates with the LIMS over an internal laboratory network to determine which tests were ordered for the spedmen, runs the tests, and transmits the results to the LIMS. Other types of specimens may require preparation, such as centrifugation, before being placed into the carousel of an automatic analyzer, but the information processing and communication between the analyzer and the LIMS are otherwise identical. For tests that are done by hand, the LIMS provides user-interfaces into which medical technologists register specimens and enter intermediate and final results of tests.",

At present, however, there are significant technical barriers to connecting a LIMS located in a laboratory with a computer located in a biosurveillance organization. The most difficult technical barrier is data incompatibility. Most laboratories do not use standard coding systems to identify the names and results of laboratory tests. Data standards exist, but few laboratories use them. Most laboratories have evolved their own naming or coding systems for the tests that they perform and the results of those tests. They use these proprietary codes (or free text) to identify the laboratory test, specimen type, organism, or other results of a test. As a result, each LIMS-tobiosurveillance-computer interface requires significant effort to understand the data and to create means to translate the data into a standard format so that it can be integrated with data coming from other LIMS. We discuss standard data formats in detail in Chapter 32.",
