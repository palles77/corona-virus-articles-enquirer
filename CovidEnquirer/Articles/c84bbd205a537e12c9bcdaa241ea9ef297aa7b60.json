Measurements were collected for each disease for nine criteria that described potential disease impacts. A total score was calculated for each disease using a weighted sum value function that aggregated the nine disease criterion measurements and weights of importance for the criteria that were previously elicited from two groups of industry stakeholders. One stakeholder group placed most value on the impacts of disease on livestock, and one group placed more value on the zoonotic impacts of diseases. Prioritisation lists ordered by disease score were produced for both of these groups. Vesicular diseases were found to have the highest priority for the group valuing disease impacts on livestock, followed by acute forms of African and classical swine fever, then highly pathogenic porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome. The group who valued zoonotic disease impacts prioritised rabies, followed by Japanese encephalitis, Eastern equine encephalitis and Nipah virus, interspersed with vesicular diseases. The multi-criteria framework used in this study systematically prioritised diseases using a multi-attribute theory based technique that provided transparency and repeatability in the process. Flexibility of the framework was demonstrated by aggregating the criterion weights from more than one stakeholder group with the disease measurements for the criteria. This technique allowed industry stakeholders to be active in resource allocation for their industry without the need to be disease experts. We believe it is the first prioritisation of livestock diseases using values provided by industry stakeholders. The prioritisation lists will be used by industry stakeholders to identify diseases for further risk analysis and disease spread modelling to understand biosecurity risks to this industry.",

However, the incursion of equine influenza into Australia in 2007 (Kirkland et al., 2011) highlighted that geographic isolation, trade restrictions and biosecurity do not guarantee protection from exotic disease incursions. Following the equine influenza incursion and the recommendations of the report \"One health: a working partnership\" (Beale et al., 2008) , a project was initiated to investigate and prioritise exotic disease risks to the pig industry. The overall aim of the project is to enhance the industry's preparedness and response to an incursion of the highest priority diseases in order to minimise impact on trade.",

All of these methods take into account the complex decision problem that is disease prioritisation; there is more than one criterion by which to rank the importance of a disease. However, the transparency of these prioritisations is affected by subjectivity when scoring diseases; particularly when using qualitative criteria that have been assigned arbitrary numerical levels of severity which are difficult to define.",

These novel approaches included using a set of quantifiable disease attributes as indicators of disease impact, deriving and validating weights of importance from a stakeholder group (pig producers) not considered to be experts in diseases via an online survey (Brookes et al., in preparation) , and presenting the results as series of prioritisation lists that build up impacts to aid communication with stakeholders.

Each potential disease was evaluated according to the criteria, using information from industry and government department reports specific to criteria, OIE publications (terrestrial animal health codes and manuals, technical disease cards) and peer-reviewed literature. If there were still information gaps, experts in specific diseases were consulted directly. Relevant peerreviewed literature was identified using a literature search of all citation databases in ISI Web of Knowledge using the following search terms: Title = (\"disease\" OR \"syndrome\" OR \"pathogen\") AND Title = (\"review\"), Timespan = All Years. The electronic search was supplemented with a handsearch of literature referenced by the identified reviews, the citation mapping tool on ISI Web of Science, and by consultation with experts who were identified through their published work. Worst case measurements that would be seen in the initial stages of a disease incursion in a naive population were used for each criterion. The criterion measurements for each disease were incorporated into the model as deterministic values. Uncertainty and variation in diseases (for example, attributes of differing strains) were reflected by creating more than one scenario for some diseases, so that variation in overall score for each disease was due solely to variation in stakeholder opinion. Australia, 2001) . iii. Attack rate for pigs on a single farm (0-100%): A \"standard\" farrow to finish herd was used as the affected production unit, assumed to consist of 10% adult animals (70% pregnant) with the remainder of the population being young animals between 0 and 22 weeks old, with a weaning age of 4 weeks. Measurements reflected the percentage of pigs with clinical disease, rather than exposure measured by seroprevalence. For example, clinical signs for Japanese encephalitis in half of the pigs up to 6 weeks old (12% of the farm population) and abortion in 50% of pregnant adult sows (4% of the population) on a \"standard\" farm gave an overall attack rate of 16%. iv. Length of clinical disease in pigs (range 0-42 days). v. Case fatality rate in pigs (0-100%). vi. Ruminant market loss (0-100%): Information for this criterion was taken from industry reports (Meat and Livestock Australia, 2009-10) and the Australian Veterinary Emergency Plan disease strategies and response policy briefs (Animal Health Australia, 2001) . vii. Incidence in humans (0-100%): The number of the Australian population (size 20 million) that could be affected in the initial stages of a disease incursion was considered. viii. Disability weight for humans (0-1): Information from the WHO Global Burden of Disease 2004 Update was used (Mathers et al., 2006) . The measurement indicated the severity of the disease in humans. ix. Case fatality rate in humans (0-100%).",

MCDA aims to fulfil all these requirements. Using MCDA we combined and extended techniques used in previous prioritisations, which provided advantages in all these respects. Aggregation of criterion measurements and weights with a MAVT based function required quantitative criteria because arithmetic operations cannot legitimately be carried out on categorical data. This was advantageous in that scoring was straightforward (data was readily available for most diseases) and more importantly, the scores were objective, definitive measures and therefore transparent and reproducible. Previous prioritisation exercises have used levels of criteria to score diseases, either to allow use of categorical criteria such as potential threat, emerging potential and disease trend, or to reduce quantitative criteria to commensurable scales. In the case of categorical criteria, the decision-makers define an ordinal scale according to level of severity of the criterion. The levels are subjective and definitions can be open to interpretation, thus affecting both transparency and reproducibility. Disease prioritisations that have been repeated have addressed this problem by modifying and improving definition of criteria (Carter, 1992; Doherty, 2006) or seeking stakeholder input in designing future prioritisations (Krause and Prioritization Working Grp, 2008; Gilsdorf and Krause, 2011) . For both qualitative and quantitative criteria, using levels also inadvertently weights the criteria because the cut-offs between levels are arbitrary. For example, the study designers could choose to divide a criterion range (for example 0-100) into either 4 or 5 levels of equal size, giving the value 95 a score of 4 in one scheme, and 5 in the other. The study designers have therefore inadvertently added weight to some of the values in one scoring system compared to the other. As well as adding a subjective element that again reduces transparency and reproducibility, this could affect the order of ranking by influencing the overall disease score. In this study it was not necessary to reduce the criteria to commensurable scales. The MAVT based technique used here was modified to allow use of incommensurable scales, because the values elicited in the stakeholder preference modelling step were modelled within the MAVT function and are therefore implicitly related to the scales of criteria (Brookes et al., in preparation) .",

Multiple disease scenarios were tested without having to repeatedly consult stakeholders, as also demonstrated in other recent prioritisations (Havelaar et al., 2010; Humblet et al., 2012; Ng and Sargeant, 2012; Del Rio Vilas et al., 2013) . In addition, this prioritisation demonstrated how the weights of importance from more than one stakeholder group could be aggregated to produce prioritisation lists tailored to the values of different stakeholder groups without having to collect further disease information. This has wider implications than simply informing resource allocation for this stakeholder group. \"Public perception\" is often included as a criterion in disease prioritisations because it is recognised as an important driver of human and animal health policy. It comprises judgement of the impacts of a disease, including the mitigations, in a social and cultural context and therefore, defining and measuring public perception is a challenge. Weights of importance for criteria used for exotic disease prioritisation for the domestic pig industry in Australia (Brookes et al., in preparation Its definitions and levels have varied between prioritisations reflecting this difficulty (Carter, 1992; Rushdy and O'Mahony, 1998; Doherty, 2000; Del Rio Vilas et al., 2013) . Prioritisations such as this can provide a model of public perception by using broad groups of stakeholders such as the general public to inform criterion weights, or smaller groups such as farmers and animal welfare organisations. This can be used to assist policy makers in understanding how people who are not health-experts value disease attributes and perceive the overall importance of different diseases.",

            "text": "The stakeholders in this prioritisation were divided over whether they placed more importance on the livestock and industry impacts of diseases, or the zoonotic impacts of diseases, and separate prioritisation lists were produced to reflect these diverse preferences. Vesicular diseases dominated the three prioritisation lists for the stakeholders who placed most importance on livestock and industry impacts of diseases. Building up the prioritisation in stages was an important communication tool because it allowed stakeholders to visualise how disease scores changed as different types of impacts were added. The highest weighted criteria for this group were attack rate and length of clinical disease in pigs (Brookes et al., in preparation) . Therefore, foot and mouth disease (FMD) scored the highest in the first prioritisation list that considered pig farm criteria only, above acute forms of African swine fever and classical swine fever which had comparable attack rates in pigs, much higher case fatality rates but much lower lengths of clinical disease. Once the criteria for market loss for pigs and ruminants and the amount of cost sharing by the government were added to the next list, several scenarios for some diseases were included in order to account for variation and uncertainty regarding disease measurements. When swine vesicular disease (SVD) and vesicular stomatitis (VS) were included as scenarios that were undifferentiated from FMD they ranked in first and second places respectively, due to lower cost-sharing by the government compared to FMD. Their priority diminished once differentiated from FMD, and again if modified stamping out was used rather than stamping out that does not allow process slaughtering. This showed that rapid differentiation from FMD and early detection of incursions of SVD and VS are both important factors in reducing the impact for this stakeholder group. Two scenarios for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) were included, because different strains occur worldwide (Li et al., 2007) . The China 06-07 strain, otherwise known as highly pathogenic PRRS, occurred as a severe outbreak of disease across China starting in 2006 (Tong et al., 2007) . However, the pigs in China were co-infected with other pathogens (Zhou and Yang, 2010) , making the severity of disease due to PRRS alone difficult to evaluate. Given the relentless spread of the highly pathogenic PRRS syndrome through south-eastern Asia and Australia's proximity to these outbreaks , this form was included in this study. It appeared high on the prioritisation list. The other form of PRRS included might be more typical of outbreaks in developed countries, such as the outbreak identified in Sweden in 2007 (Carlsson et al., 2009) effects of disease on human health. Overall, the disease order did not change markedly except for diseases with high disability weight such as rabies which increased in priority, as disability weight was the fourth highest weighted criterion for this group. We did not consider FMD as a zoonosis in this prioritisation because its transmission to humans is rare and accepted as causing very mild clinical signs (Prempeh et al., 2001) . SVD is generally not considered to be a zoonosis at all. However, it was reported to cause disease in four laboratory workers and one person was hospitalised (Brown et al., 1976; Lin and Kitching, 2000) . This potential level of severity of disease makes its zoonotic effects difficult to ignore, even if rare. However, if zoonotic transmission of the virus is not an important factor SVD also reduces in priority once differentiated from FMD. The other group of stakeholders were more concerned about the impacts of zoonotic diseases: although case fatality rate in pigs was the highest weighted criterion for this group, case fatality rate and disability weight in humans were the next most important criteria. Consequently, zoonotic diseases scored much higher than in the livestock disease prioritisation lists. This stakeholder group was inconsistent in their preference rankings in the step to elicit criterion weights (Brookes et al., in preparation) . It was recommended that these lists should be used to prioritise zoonotic diseases only, particularly as attack rate in pigs -their lowest weighted criterion -had a negative mean weight leading to unexpected final scores for diseases with high attack rate in pigs, but low criterion measurements otherwise. When zoonotic criteria were considered alone, rabies, Japanese encephalitis, Eastern equine encephalitis and Nipah virus were the highest priority diseases. These results are consistent with a recent prioritisation of zoonotic diseases using conjoint analysis of the preferences of a public stakeholder group in North America (Ng and Sargeant, 2012) , and a prioritisation of zoonotic disease using MCDA and the values of disease experts (Havelaar et al., 2010) . When all criteria and diseases are included rabies is still the highest priority disease, followed by SVD as a zoonosis and Japanese encephalitis. FMD and SVD undifferentiated from FMD are still high priority due to their high case fatality rates when stamping out is used to control disease on farms.",

Risk is dependent on many environmental and host factors as well as disease characteristics. Whilst more than one scenario has been included to account for variations and uncertainty in disease characteristics, including multiple scenarios or probability distributions to account for variation and uncertainty in host and environmental characteristics is beyond the scope of disease prioritisation and this is better investigated via risk analysis. We considered the stakeholders to be experts in pig farming, and therefore able to interpret disease information in terms of economic impact on their farms and to their industry. More detailed economic analysis could be carried out subsequently on selected diseases. Control methods such as treatment or vaccination are either preventive or instigated secondary to a disease incursion, and can also be considered subsequently. Ultimately, MCDA in disease prioritisation is an aid to decision-making, not a substitute for making decisions. It provides a baseline of information about disease impacts according to stakeholder opinion. Selection of diseases for resource allocation for either surveillance and prevention or control will be influenced by other factors such as risk of disease entry (Cox, 2009) , once the diseases have been ordered.",

Another limitation of this prioritisation is exclusion of diseases due to insufficient information. It is possible that they could be of high priority if they could be included. A procedure involving the use of algorithms such as those described and used by the Human Animal Infections Risks and Surveillance Group (Palmer et al., 2005; Morgan et al., 2009) , could be modified and used to assess information gaps and potential threats from these diseases.",

Whilst MCDA has been used in previous disease prioritisations, this is the first prioritisation of diseases of livestock using MCDA that reflects the values of a specific group of public stakeholders who are not considered disease experts. Although the aim of decision making is to usually combine the opinions of all stakeholders, producing two sets of prioritisation lists at the aggregation step of this MCDA allowed better representation of the values of the stakeholder group rather than producing an \"average\" list that suited nobody. Overall, quantitative criterion measurements through the use of MAVT and separation of objective criterion measurements from subjective weights of importance through the MADM structure provided transparency, reproducibility and flexibility to the prioritisation, and provided stakeholders with a decisionaid based on their own values. It subsequently allowed the stakeholders to make an informed decision about which diseases should be prioritised for further investigation of biosecurity requirements using risk analysis and disease spread modelling.",
