Furthermore, long-term treatment with commonly used antifungals, such as amphotericin-B, has toxic effects: ketoconazole, fluconazole and clotrimazole are limited in their spectrum and efficacy and use may result in strain resistance. 6, 7 For this reason, there is a need for new active molecules which can serve as lead for further development in antifungal chemotherapy.",

            "text": "Air-dried plant material (10 kg) was pulverized and extracted with 95% ethanol (4\u00b7 15 L) for 24 h at room temperature. The whole extract was concentrated under reduced pressure by using rotatory evaporator at 50\u00b0C and finally dried under vacuo to get solid mass coded as D002 (315 g). The crude ethanolic extract (145 g) was macerated with n-hexane to get n-hexane-soluble fraction (F003, 2.5 g). The insoluble residue was partitioned between chloroform and water to give chloroform-soluble fraction (F004, 40 g) and aqueous portion. The aqueous portion was then partitioned with n-butanol to give n-butanol-(F005, 63 g) and watersoluble fraction (F006, 39 g). All these fractions were submitted for evaluation of antifungal activity against human pathogenic fungi. The chloroform fraction (F004) showed significant antifungal activity. The fraction F004 (15 g) was subjected to column chromatography by using n-hexane containing increasing amount of acetone as an eluent to give a fraction F007 n-hexaneacetone (9:1 v/v) in which activity was localized. The fraction F007 (7 g) was further subjected to repeated column chromatography by using benzene and increasing amount of methanol as an eluent to give two compounds 1 and 2. The compound 2 was identified as 3-hydroxy-1-methoxy anthraquinone-2-carboxaldehyde by comparison of their spectral data with those reported in the literature [9] [10] [11] and the structure of the newly isolated compound 1 was elucidated as 3,4-dihydroxy-1-methoxy anthraquinone-2-carboxaldehyde by their detailed spectral and chemical analysis. Compound 1 was obtained as yellowish amorphous powder and crystallized in methanol acetone mixture, mp 273-275\u00b0C. In IR spectrum of the compound a strong absorption band for hydroxyl group was observed at 3400 cm \u00c01 , other characteristic bands appeared at 1670, 1587 cm \u00c01 due to anthraquinone nucleus 9,12,13 and at 1652 cm \u00c01 and 1640 cm \u00c01 due to the two chelated carbonyl groups. ESMS (+ve) displayed [M+H] + peak at 299 corresponding to the molecular formula C 16 H 10 O 6 and other fragment peaks at m/z 271 and 267 were observed after loss of CO and OCH 3 groups from the molecular ion. The 1 H NMR spectrum of the compound (Table 1) showed signal at d 10.45 (1H, s) for aldehydic proton and two 1H singlets at d 12.07 and 13.06 due to chelated hydroxyl protons. A multiplate at d 7.77-7.84 (2H, m), signal at d 8.17 (1H, d, J = 7.9 Hz), 8.24 (1H, d, J = 7.9 Hz) for the aromatic proton of the type 'AA 0 , BB 0 ' confirmed the presence of the four aromatic proton. [13] [14] [15] Other sig-nal in the 1 H NMR spectrum at d 4.10 was assignable to the OCH 3 group. The aldehyde group of the compound 1 was reduced to CH 2 OH with methanolic sodium borohydride to give compound 1R. 16 The 1 H NMR spectrum of the compound 1R having a 1H singlet at d 13.06 due to the hydroxy group chelated with one of the carbonyl group of the anthraquinone nucleus revealing the position of one hydroxy group at C-4 of the anthraquinone nucleus. The signal at d 12.07 which disappeared on reduction of compound 1 to compound 1R thus belonged to the hydroxyl group chelated to the aldehyde group. It must be located at the carbon ortho to the aldehydic group. Moreover, the methoxy proton signal appeared somewhat down field (d 4.10) from its normal position d (3.50) indicating that methoxy group must be flanked by anthraquinone carbonyl and aldehydic groups. The 13 C NMR spectrum of the compound (Table 1) 6 is due to methoxy carbon. All these spectral data suggested compound 1 to be 3,4-dihydroxy-1-methoxy anthraquinone-2-carboxaldehyde.",

NA, Inactive at the tested concentration between 1.56-500 lg/ml.",
