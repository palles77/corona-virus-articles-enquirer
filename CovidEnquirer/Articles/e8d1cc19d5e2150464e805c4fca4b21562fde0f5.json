When using one single cell line, HEp-2, the overall numbers of adenoviruses detected using cytopathogenicity and immunofluorescence were roughly equal. In situ hybridization was approx. 40% more sensitive than either of these other methods as determined by average virus titers for the different samples, and also proved to be better by means of a nonparametric comparison. The 293 cell line was approx. 5 times more sensitive for detecting adenoviruses by cytopathogenicity as compared with the HEp-2 cell line, but proved unsuitable in our hands for quantitatively detecting indigenous adenoviruses by immunofluorescence. The relative number of indigenous adenoviruses present in the sewage concentrates we examined was, on average, 94-fold greater than that of enteroviruses.

Production of tube cultures of either HEp-2 or 293 cells for use in cytopathogenicity assays was done in screw-capped 16 x 125 mm culture tubes. The type of tube material used for cytopathogenicity assays depended upon the cell line; borosilicate glass for HEp-2 cells and polystyrene for the 293 line. Choice of the latter combination was based upon a finding that cells of the 293 line did not grow well on glass surfaces. Production of individual HEp-2 cell cultures for either immunofluorescence or in situ hybridization assays was done using 8-well chambered slides with removeable gaskets (Lab-Tek, Miles Laboratories Inc., Naperville, Ill.).",

Both lines have been found to be suitable for the detection of adenoviruses by this technique (Benton and Ward, 1982; de Jong et al., 1983; Takiff et al., 1981) . The tube cultures had been prepared using stationary racks. One hour prior to inoculation with sample material, the medium in the tubes was substituted with FBS-free MEM containing 5 ml 1-t of sodium bicarbonate solution and also guanidine hydrochloride (further referred to as \"inoculation medium\"). The cultures were incubated with this medium for an intervening period of I h at 37~C, after which they were inoculated with 0.05~).1 ml of the sewage concentrate, either as prepared or following dilution at rates of 1:10 or 1:100 in inoculation medium. At 4 h post inoculation the medium in these tubes was changed to fresh inoculation medium. The tubes were returned to 3TC for further incubation. The medium was additionally changed on days 2 and 5 post inoculation, to flesh inoculation medium containing chicken serum at a final concentration of 2% v/v. The cell cultures were examined on days 4-8 post inoculation for the presence of characteristic adenoviral cytopathogenic effects. Culture tubes containing HEp-2 cells were incubated on a roller apparatus during the eight day post inoculation period in an effort to speed development of cytopathogenic effects (Schmidt, 1979) , Culture tubes containing 293 cells were incubated in stationary position post-inoculation because of their tendency to detach from culture surfaces if continuously turned. The viral titers from this type of assay are normally expressed in terms of tissue culture infectious doses as a 50% endpoint (TCIDs0) per ml as determined by the technique of Reed and Muench (1938) . In order to arrive at a titration endpoint which could more closely be compared with those of the other viral assays used in this study, the derived TCIDs0 titer values were divided by a factor of 2 and then expressed as TCID ml-l.",

All cells determined as positive by immunofluorescence were immediately subjected to confirmation of their positive status by morphological examination using phase contrast microscopy. Cells which failed to be recognized as positive by both immunofluorescence reactivity, as well as morphological appearance when viewed by phase contrast, were considered negative and not included in determining the virus titer.

Cells of the HEp-2 line were chosen for this comparison because of difficulties which we have experienced when attempting use of the 293 line for adenovirus immunofluorescent foci assays. These difficulties with the 293 line have been 2-fold. Firstly, a tendency of the cells to round-up severely during the course of adenoviral infection such that the positive status of fluorescing cells cannot be confirmed through examination of the cell's internal morphology. Secondly, a poor adherence of cultures of this cell line to either glass or plastic microscope slides, such that the produced monolayers readily detach during efforts at fixation prior to immunofluorescence staining.",

The procedure used for this inoculation, as well as subsequent fixation of the infected HEp-2 cells in methanol and staining of them for examination by indirect immunofluorescence, was the same as that described in Materials and Methods for directly assaying sewage concentrates in the HEp-2 cell line. All of the 56 adenovirus positive culture tubes of 293 cells which we examined as a part of this confirmation were subsequently found to be positive by immunofluorescence in the HEp-2 cells. This indicated that the much higher viral titers obtained when performing the cytopathogenicity assay with cells of the 293 line did indeed reflect numbers of viable adenoviruses which were not capable of initially replicating in HEp-2 cells. All of these viruses were, however, capable of subsequent replication in the HEp-2 cell line following their first passage in 293 cells. It is suggested by the efforts of Takiff and coworkers (1981) that this difference of adenoviral titers yielded by cytopathogenicity in 293 cells vs HEp-2 cells reflects that portion of the total adenovirus population which is enteric in nature, i.e. is of serotypes 40 and 41, which are causative agents of human gastroenteritis. The variability associated with detecting adenoviruses by cytopathogenicity using the 293 cell line was greater in our hands (Table 3) than it was for detecting adenoviruses by either of the three techniques when using HEp-2 cells.",

By our procedure, producing a positive result for cytopathogenicity should necessitate production of progeny virions which are fully infectious for the same cell culture line as was inoculated. The reason for assuming this necessity of full virus replication for our cytopathogenicity assay is the relatively low number of viral units which would have been present in the end-dilutions of the sewage concentrates being examined, likely far fewer than would be needed to initially infect 5% of cells in the culture. In addition, nearly all of the positive tubes reached a point where 25% or more of the cells demonstrated cytopathic effects. The immunofluorescence assay required that viruses be capable of proceeding through their replicative cycle to the stage of producing progeny capsid proteins. The similarity of our results from these two assay techniques would suggest that, on average, those virions which are capable of producing capsid proteins within 48 h will subsequently be able to progress in their replicative cycle through the stage of assembling fully infectious progeny if given an additional 6 days of incubation. Our discovery that the number of viruses detected by in situ hybridization was greater than that found using immunofluorescence may suggest that some members of the adenovirus populations contained in our samples were capable of progressing to the stage of generating progeny DNA within 48 h, however were unable to progress significantly further given the constraints of the cell line and the allowed amount of incubation time.",

In the case of cytopathogenicity assays, guanidine also seemed to make the cells somewhat more sensitive to cytotoxic effects of compounds present in sewage which concentrated along with the viruses (Hurst and Goyke, 1983) . While this increased sensitivity to cytotoxicity did result in some suppression of viral titers for undiluted sewage concentrate, it was generally not a problem for our study because the high numbers of adenoviruses present in the processed sewage concentrates necessitated their dilution by a factor of at least 10-fold prior to inoculation for that type of assay.

Our finding that the average number of adenoviruses present in sewage concentrates, as measured by cytopathogenicity using the 293 cell line, was 94-fold greater than for the enteroviruses as determined by plaque assay, contrasts with the findings of the above investigators who have reported differences of approx. 3-fold or less. This finding could be associated with three possible factors. Firstly, that adenoviruses might have been recovered more efficiently by the elution and concentration procedures which we used in our study than were the enteroviruses, a possibility that we have begun to explore further in our laboratory. Secondly, that our collection of samples for use in this study may have coincided with a peak period for the presence of adenoviruses, and simultaneously a minimum period for the presence of enteroviruses. This could well be, as our samples were collected during the time period of November-December. Krikelis and coworkers noted in their study that enterovirus titers peaked in August and September as should be expected for the northern hemisphere, but that the titer of adenoviruses peaked in the months of April and June. Studies by other groups on the prevalence of adenoviral gastroenteritis in the northern hemisphere would indicate the illness to have two annual peaks, one occuring in November and the other from April to May (Cevenini et al., 1985; Cusi et al., 1986; Isaacs et al., 1986; Payne et al., 1986) .",

Without the use of either guanidine or some similar compound capable of selectively suppressing replication of enteroviruses, the assay titers obtained for adenoviruses in any study similar to ours might be artificially low due to rapid overgrowth of the cell cultures by enteroviruses. This overgrowth effect has previously been even more apparent to us when performing the rapid assay techniques, for which samples are inoculated at lower dilutions due to both the time constraints involved in reading the assays and the reagent costs.",

Efforts to reduce the incubation period for either of these two assays from 48 h down to a period of 24 h were unsuccessful in our hands. The cause for this lack of success was due to reduced formation, within the shorter time period, of viral capsid proteins and nucleic acid within the infected cells. The optimum choice for detection of adenoviruses may, however, still rest with use of a eytopathogenicity assay when performed with a highly sensitive cell line such as 293.",
