The PCR cycle used for the amplification of cDNA of SARS-3CL Pro was as follows: 94\u040aC for 5 min, 25 cycles of 94\u040aC for 1 min, 58\u040aC for 3 min, 72\u040aC for 2 min and 72\u040aC for 10 min. A full-length 3CL Pro of SARS coronavirus was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. Following cleavage by thrombin, 3CL Pro was purified to homogeneity. A 15mer peptide with sequence H 2 N-SITSAVLQSGFRKMA-COOH corresponding to an autocleavage site of the SARS-3CL Pro was synthesized and used for protease cleavage activity assay. The highly purified protein was shown by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis to exhibit proteolytic activity in trans.",

The main protease, frequently called 3C-like protease (3CL Pro ), has been identified as an attractive drug target (17) . Of the 720 natural products screened in this study, tannic acid (Fig. 4a) and TF2B were identified using the HPLC proteolytic assay to inhibit 50% of the proteolytic acitivity of 3CL Pro at concentrations \u03fd10 M. Both tannic acid and TF2B belong to the group of natural polyphenols found in teas. Low concentrations of tannic acid were found to inhibit proteases including tissue-type plasminogen activator, urokinase-type plasminogen activator and plasmin activity [13] . Over 300 different kinds of tea are now produced, but they are classified into three main forms: green tea is manufactured by drying fresh tea leaves, with emphasis on the prevention of oxidation of the tea polyphenols during the manufacturing process. In contrast, the manufacture of black tea is characterized by a high degree of fermentation, which produces a series of chemical condensations among the ingredients present in tea. Oolong tea is partially fermented, and the tea compositions are more similar to those found in green tea (18) . In evaluating different types of tea, we found that extracts from several different types of tea, including Puer and black tea, could inhibit 3CL Pro activity while green or oolong tea could not. However, the chemical composition in Puer tea is very complex and it is difficult to isolate pure ingredients for structural identification.",

These compounds are abundant in the extract of black tea (16, 19) . Black tea is a popular beverage in the world. Results from this study warrant further investigation to examine the effect of these natural products in inhibition of SARS-CoV replication in cell culture. Clark et al. reported that theaflavins extracted from black tea were able to neutralize bovine coronavirus and rotavirus infections (20) . Thus, it will be very interesting to evaluate, in a separate study, whether drinking black tea can prevent or alleviate the infection of an enteric form of coronavirus since SARS-CoV is known to actively replicate in the intestinal tract (21) .
