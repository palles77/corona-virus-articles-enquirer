            "text": "Cats infected with virulent feline coronavirus which causes feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) usually succumb to disease despite high antibody concentrations. One of the mechanisms that can help resolving infection is antibody-dependent, complement-mediated lysis (ADCML) of infected cells. ADCML consists of virus-specific antibodies that bind to cell surface expressed viral proteins which result in complement activation and cell lysis. The objective of this study was to determine the sensitivity of FIP-virus (FIPV) infected cells towards ADCML and to examine the role of the accessory proteins 3abc and 7ab in this process. ADCML assays, using FIPV strain 79-1146 and its deletion mutant strain 3abc/ 7ab, were performed on: (i) CrFK cells that show surface-expressed viral antigens, (ii) monocytes without surface-expressed viral proteins due to retention and (iii) monocytes with surface-expressed viral proteins since the antibody-mediated internalization of these proteins was blocked. As expected, no ADCML was detected of the monocytes without surface-expressed viral antigens. Surprisingly, no lysis was observed in the CrFK cells and the monocytes that do show surface-expressed viral proteins, while controls showed that the ADCML assay was functional. These experiments proof that FIPV can employ another immune evasion strategy against ADCML (besides preventing surface expression): the inhibition of complementmediated lysis. This new evasion strategy is not attributed to the group-specific proteins since lysis of cells infected with FIPV 3abc/ 7ab was not detected.",

            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a fatal disease, characterized by fibrinous-granulomatous serositis often with protein-rich effusions in body cavities, granulomatous-necrotising phlebitis and periphlebitis and granulomatous inflammatory lesions in several organs (Weiss and Scott, 1981a,b; Kipar et al., 1998 Kipar et al., , 2005 . The causative agent is a virulent form of the feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) belonging to the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales. In vivo, monocytes and tissue macrophages are the target cells and play a central role in the development of the lesions (Kipar et al., 2005) . These infected cells should be excellent targets for the immune system to fight the infection. However, in most cases the immune response is not protective and the cat succumbs to the infection. The cell-mediated immunity is believed to be important in control and clearance of the FIP-virus (FIPV) infection if there is an efficient first response to the infection. The humoral immune response is believed to be not protective. High concentrations of neutralizing antibodies are present in cats with end-stage FIP and no difference is seen in the antibody concentration and fluctuations between survivors and non-survivors after a FIPV infection (de Groot-Mijnes et al., 2005) .",

            "text": "In general, virus-specific antibodies can help to resolve infection by antibody-mediated lysis of infected cells via cytolytic immune cells with Fc receptor (like NK cells, macrophages or neutrophils) or via complement (Sissons and Oldstone, 1980 ). The complement system is an immunological defense system and plays a role in both the innate and the adaptive immune response against invading pathogens. Complement consists of serum and membrane-bound proteins which, once activated, can trigger a biochemical cascade of reactions contributing to the eradication of pathogens (Blue et al., 2004) . Important complement effector functions are opsonization of pathogens, cytolysis and promoting host inflammatory responses (anaphylatoxin and chemotaxin production) (Janeway et al., 2005) . In viral infections, the complement system can be activated by free virus particles and virus-infected cells. Complement can inactivate free virus in the presence or absence of antibodies. Opsonization of the virus with complement proteins can promote phagocytosis, virolysis and interference with attachment, internalization or uncoating of the virions (Hirsch, 1982) . Cells infected with enveloped viruses can be lysed by complement in the presence of antibodies if newly synthesized viral glycoproteins are expressed at the plasma membrane of the infected cell. Virus-specific antibodies can then bind to these surface-expressed proteins and thereby activate the complement system. Eventually, this results in cell death (Sissons and Oldstone, 1980 process is called antibody-dependent, complement-mediated lysis (ADCML).",

Namely, the retention of viral proteins in infected cells and the antibody-mediated internalization of surfaceexpressed viral proteins. Both processes result in the clearance of all detectable viral antigens from the plasma membrane of infected cells (Dewerchin et al., 2005; Dewerchin et al., 2006) . FIPVinfected monocytes/macrophages isolated from naturally infected cats do not express viral proteins at their plasma membrane either (Cornelissen et al., 2007) . Absence of viral proteins in the plasma membrane of infected monocytes can protect the infected cells from efficient ADCML. This has been described for pseudorabies virus (PRV), equine herpesvirus-1 (EHV-1) and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) (van der Meulen et al., 2003; Van de Walle et al., 2003; Costers et al., 2006) .",

The ADCML assay was performed as described above using PRV strain Kaplan, feline pAbs against PRV (derived from a Geskypur (Merial) vaccinated FCoV-negative cat, according to manufacturer's instructions), feline complement and FITC-labeled PRV-specific pAbs to identify infected cells. It has been described that PRV-infected porcine macrophages with surface-expressed viral antigens are sensitive to ADCML (Van de Walle et al., 2003). The results of the ADCML with FIPV 79-1146 and the deletion mutant virus strain FIPV 3abc/ 7ab are given in Fig. 1 . With both viruses and both cell types, the percentages of dead FIPV-infected cells in the ADCML assay with virus-specific antibodies were not significantly different from those in the assay without antibodies (p \u2264 0.05). Also no significant difference was seen with the ADCML assay with FIPV-negative antibodies. Triplicate assays were performed and results were compared using the Friedman Test from the SPSS software package (Version 12.0; SPSS Inc.).",

In the presence of complement the virus neutralization titer was two times and 64 times higher for 1000 and 10 000 TCID 50 of FIPV 79-1146, respectively. The ADCML assay with PRV showed that the ADCML was effective for both CrFKs and feline monocytes. For both cell types there was a significant rise in the percentage of dead cells with higher antibody concentrations (p \u2264 0.05; Friedman Test) (Fig. 1) . The humoral immune system is activated during a FIPV infection, but the antibodies formed seem to be ineffective in eliminating virus and virus-infected cells. For FIPV-infected cells, antibodymediated internalization of plasma membrane-expressed viral proteins has been described (Dewerchin et al., 2006) . This inter-nalization, resulting in the absence of viral proteins in the plasma membrane, can protect the infected cells from efficient ADCML. Inhibiting this internalization process, resulting in infected cells being recognizable by antibodies, could be a part of a treatment protocol for FIP cats. Unfortunately, results of this study show that even if there are viral proteins present on the plasma membrane, no lysis does occur through ADCML. However, if antibodies bind to the surface-expressed viral proteins, cell lysis may still occur via other cell lysis mechanisms e.g. via antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity. In this mechanism, lysis is performed by activated natural killer cells, neutrophils, monocytes or macrophages.",

The FIPV-specific antibodies used are able to bind complement since virus-neutralization was higher in the presence of complement. This higher neutralization can be due to virolysis, agglutination of virus-antibody-complement complexes or coating of the virus with complement components which can interfere with the binding of the virus to target cells or alter the surface charge of the virus (Hirsch, 1982; Lachmann and Davies, 1997) . For example, it could be possible that binding of complement to the Fc portion of the antibody inhibits antibody-dependent enhancement of infectivity (ADEI), a mechanism which is described in vitro (Hohdatsu et al., 1991) . The fact that neutralizing antibodies are present in a cat with FIP, together with the observed enhancement of neutralization by complement in this study, indicates that cell free virus does not play an important role in the pathogenesis of FIP (de Groot-Mijnes et al., 2005) .",

It has been described for measles virus-infected cells that redistribution of viral antigens has no influence on the effectiveness of the ADCML . Half of the infected monocytes showed bound antibodies on their surface, which are consistent with previously published results (Dewerchin et al., 2005) . As expected, the monocytes without surface-expressed viral proteins were protected against ADCML, but also no ADCML was seen of the monocytes with surface-expressed viral proteins.

            "text": "It seems that FIPV can employ another virus complement evasion strategy in addition to the already described retention of viral proteins in the cytoplasm of infected cells and the antibodymediated internalization of plasma membrane-expressed viral proteins. This additional evasion strategy cannot be attributed to the accessory or group-specific proteins 3abc and 7ab since lysis of cells infected with the double mutant strain FIPV 3abc/ 7ab was not detected. These genes encode for proteins that are not necessary for virus growth and infection. Their deletion has an attenuating effect on the virulence of the virus in cats (Haijema et al., 2004) . The basis of the attenuation is not known, but there is no correlation with the efficacy of the ADCML, as shown in the present study. This new immune evasion strategy has to be attributed to the structural proteins or the non-structural proteins of ORF 1ab and can be direct via viral proteins or indirect by means of cellular proteins that regulate the complement cascade. Various virus complement evasion strategies have been described for other viruses. Viruses can express proteins with Fc receptor activity that can inhibit the binding of complement to the antibody-antigen complex. The glycoprotein gE expressed by herpes simplex virus (HSV) has an Fc receptor activity and protects against antibody and complement-mediated lysis, both in vitro and in vivo (Adler et al., 1978; Lubinski et al., 2002) . For FIPV, the presence of an Fc receptor activity has never been studied but the spike proteins of other coronaviruses, namely mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), bovine coronavirus (BCV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) display Fc receptor activity (Oleszak et al., 1995) . Another possibility is that the virus encodes proteins with functional similarities to complement control proteins, inhibitors of the complement cascade. No viral complement control proteins have been described for coronaviruses but several have been described for poxviruses and herpesviruses Bernet et al., 2003) . For FIPV, this would imply that the spike, membrane and envelope protein or the non-structural proteins encoded by ORF 1 should exhibit complement control protein activity, like binding to or accelerating the decay of certain complement factors. Finally, it is possible that the virus induces an upregulation of host complement control factors in the infected cell. This has been described for human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) where upregulation of complement regulator CD55 protected infected cells from complement-mediated lysis (Spiller et al., 1996) .",
