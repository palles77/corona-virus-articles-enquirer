In both young and aged mice, an intranasal Protollin-formulated S-protein vaccine elicited high levels of antigen-specific IgG in serum, comparable to those elicited by an intramuscular Alum-adsorbed S-protein vaccine. Serum antibodies were shown to be virus neutralizing. Intranasal immunization of young mice with the Protollin-formulated vaccine elicited significant levels of antigen-specific lung IgA in contrast to mice immunized with the intramuscular vaccine in which no antigen-specific lung IgA was detected. Following live virus challenge of aged mice, no virus was detected in the lungs of intranasally immunized mice, in contrast to intramuscularly immunized mice whose lung virus titers were comparable to those observed in control mice.",

A new coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was identified to be the causative agent of SARS [1] [2] [3] and its genome sequence was published in 2003 [4] [5] [6] . The outbreak in 2002-2003 caused approximately 8000 SARS-related cases with a mortality rate of about 10%. This relatively high death rate coupled with the apparent ease of transmission of SARS-CoV, posed a serious public health threat and prompted considerable efforts to develop a safe and effective prophylactic vaccine for use in the event of a re-appearance of the disease.",

Another whole virus vaccine comprising formaldehyde-inactivated, polyethylene glycol (PEG)-precipitated SARS virus given intranasally to mice, was reported to induce virus-specific lung IgA and serum IgG [8] .

            "text": "Infection with SARS virus is thought to be mediated by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a surface protein found on lung alveolar epithelial cells and on vascular endothelium [12] . Thus, it would be highly desirable for an effective vaccine to induce immunity in both the respiratory tract as well as in serum, i.e. mucosal and systemic immunity. This laboratory's approach has been to attempt the induction of both by mucosal immunization of mice with a subunit vaccine formulated with the proprietary adjuvant Protollin-Shigella flexneri LPS non-covalently associated with major outer membrane proteins from Neisseria meningitidis (Proteosomes). In many pre-clinical studies, intranasal administration of vaccines comprising antigens formulated with Protollin have been shown to elicit potent mucosal as well as systemic immunity [13] [14] [15] [16] , while clinical trials of Protollin alone (as an intranasal vaccine against Shigella disease) showed that it was safe and well-tolerated in human volunteers [17] . Thus, provided it was successful in eliciting appropriate immune responses in pre-clinical studies, a Protollin-formulated S-protein vaccine would have the potential to be tested in clinical trials as a human SARS vaccine. This report documents pre-clinical feasibility studies in mice with intranasal Protollin-formulated S-protein and compares the responses elicited and their phenotype with those elicited by an intramuscular Alum-adsorbed S-protein vaccine.",

An additional 0.1 mL of cell growth medium containing 4% fetal bovine serum was then added to each well, gently mixed and incubated at 37 \u2022 C for 6 days which had been previously determined to be the optimal time required to achieve full cytopathic effect in the non-treated infectivity controls when using virus at 200 TCID 50 units. The wells in the plate were then scored by visual observation for CPE or cytotoxicity using light microscopy. CPE was graded on a scale of 0-4, 0 indicating no cytopathic effect and 4 indicating complete cytopathic effect. Titers were then calculated using the Reed-Muench equation [21] .

Both vaccines elicited comparable levels of antigen-specific serum IgG though the titers achieved by three immunizations fell short by a factor of 3 or 4 of the titers achieved by two immunizations of 6-8week-old mice with the same vaccines. This however is not surprising given the well-documented effects of aging on the humoral immune system [22] . Antigen-specific lung IgA titers were also lower than those elicited in the 6-8-week-old mice, and were below the accepted ELISA's lower limit of quantitation. However, when OD values in minimally diluted lung lavage were used instead of titer analyses for the measurement of lung IgA, significantly higher S-protein-specific IgA levels were detected in the mice immunized intranasally with Protollin-formulated S-protein than in those immunized intramuscularly with Alum-adsorbed S-protein.",

Furthermore, measurement of virus titers in the lungs of the challenged mice showed that there were much lower virus counts in the lungs of mice given the Protollin-formulated vaccine compared with the titers in the lungs of mice given the Alum-adsorbed vaccine or any of the control treatments. In fact none of the mice immunized intranasally with the higher 30 g dose of S-protein formulated with Protollin showed any detectable virus titer in the lung. Thus, there was a qualitative correlation between the level of IgA in lung lavage fluid of intranasally immunized mice and virus titer recovered from their lungs following subsequent challenge. The fact that mice immunized with the Alum-adsorbed S-protein also developed high levels of serum neutralizing activity but no detectable lung IgA but had significantly higher viral lung titers than the intranasally immunized mice strongly supports the concept that specific lung IgA titers are an important and, in the case of SARS, perhaps potentially critical component of protection afforded by immunization with the Protollin-formulated, intranasal S-protein vaccine.",

These data indicate that further development of an intranasal Protollin-formulated S-protein vaccine to protect against the re-emergence of SARS disease is warranted. Such studies would include advanced development of antigen and adjuvant production, performance of pre-clinical toxicology and non-human primate studies, and early phase clinical trials designed to assess the vaccine's safety and immunogenicity.",
