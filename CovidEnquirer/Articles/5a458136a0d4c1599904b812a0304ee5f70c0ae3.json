            "text": "Background: The H1N1 Influenza A pandemic arrived in Australia in early May 2009. In Queensland, the highest number of H1N1 cases were admitted to the intensive care unit when compared with the other Australian states. While many recent studies examining the H1N1 pandemic have focussed on service delivery and disease epidemiology, few have explored the lived experiences of frontline health care workers caring for the patients in the intensive care unit. Objectives: The purposes of this study were to: document and describe the lived experiences of the nursing and medical staff caring for patients in the intensive care unit during the H1N1 pandemic; to validate the staffs' experiences; and to assist in informing future pandemic planning by highlighting the collective experiences of these frontline health care workers. Design: A phenomenological study method was used. Setting and participants: 34 staff from a tertiary referral hospital in Brisbane, Australia participated in the study. Methods: Data was collected using an open ended questionnaire and focus groups. The resulting responses were analysed using Colaizzi's framework to discover regular patterns of meaning that emerged. Results: Eight common themes emerged: the wearing of personal protective equipment; infection control procedures; the fear of contracting and transmitting the disease; adequate staffing levels within the intensive care unit; new roles for staff; morale levels; education regarding extracorporeal membrane oxygenation; and the challenges of patient care. These eight themes articulate the lived experience of the staff during the height of the H1N1 Influenza pandemic period. Conclusions: Planning for a pandemic situation is invariably difficult due to the unpredictable nature of the event itself. Recommendations for future pandemic planning which can be drawn from this study include the appointment of a dedicated infection control representative to provide information and support regarding infection control matters; the maintenance of effective communication channels is crucial; and the increased staffing requirements across nursing, medical, allied health and ancillary staff to cope with the higher patient numbers and acuity must be anticipated and planned for.",

In Queensland, the highest total H1N1 admissions to ICU was reported with the most occupied ICU bed days compared with other centres in Australia. The first case of confirmed H1N1 Influenza was admitted to our unit on 8 July 2009 and to the end of September, there have been 20 confirmed cases and 13 suspected cases of H1N1 Influenza admitted to the ICU. The impact of the H1N1 pandemic on the ICU was tremendous. Bed capacity was increased to 23 beds and elective cardiothoracic surgery was cancelled to cope with the large influx of critically ill patients. The acuity of some H1N1 patients dictated that many were cared for by 2 RNs (i.e. those on ECMO) and this put great strain on the nursing and medical workforce such that many hours of overtime were worked to ensure that the patients were cared for safely.",

All persons entering the isolation unit were required to wash their hands and apply personal protective equipment (PPE) [gown, gloves and mask] prior to entering.

The transcriptions were concomitantly analysed by a second investigator using the aforementioned method. The themes identified by each investigator were then discussed, revised and agreed upon by both investigators. Coliazzi's last step in data analysis is to return the findings to the participants to confirm that the findings are a true reflection of their experiences.

However, during the height of the pandemic, there was a perceived lack of firm recommendations and guidelines regarding specifically what PPE was required. This created an element of confusion amongst the staff caring for these patients. Staff described feeling unsure regarding what PPE was required -''PPE requirements for both staff and relatives changed on an almost daily basis. Hard to keep up with what the current requirement was'' and ''we were told one day. . .if you're at the bedside and you've got a patient on the ventilator just put a plastic apron on. . .and then we were told -you can't wear that, you have to have a yellow gown on at the bedside''. Some staff reported that the ambiguity regarding PPE requirements made them feel ''unprotected'' and ''undervalued''. There was also a perception that the supplies of PPE were running low within the unit and this created an environment which made staff question whether they would remain adequately protected during the pandemic period and that they might have to ''compromise''. One bedside nursing staff member stated ''as supplies ran out the 'rules' changed and surgical masks and plastic aprons were [considered] effective. It made me worried that the only reason it was changed was due to stock shortage and that perhaps we weren't as protected''. It was acknowledged that adequate supply of PPE was a major priority for the nursing management -''our biggest fear was running out of things, like your masks and gowns. . .I think there was a time when they thought we were going to run out and resort to substandard masks'' and the shortage of PPE supplies was communicated to the bedside nursing staff on many occasions by nursing management. It is evident from the data collected in this study that a large discrepancy in perceptions existed regarding the connection between the changing of PPE protocols and perceived stock shortages. Although stocks of PPE did not run out, it was acknowledged that if the pandemic had gone on much longer that supplies of PPE would indeed have been critically low to running out.",

Therefore it was necessary for nursing staff, not usually functioning in the roles of TL or Float, to quickly up-skill to fill these positions not only in the isolated unit, but also in the other two units. This was seen as a major concern for many more senior staff, in terms of these junior TLs and Floats being provided with adequate support -''junior TLs and floats left to run ICU, left feeling unsupported and anxious''; ''increased demand for senior nursing staff to care for ECMO saw less experienced staff pushed into roles of float and TL'' and ''the junior staff were quite stressed because there was very little support for them because all the CNs were wrapped up in the ECMO''. In response, the clinical nurse teachers' role within the unit changed and they provided support to these more junior TLs and floats and also the more experienced nurses were able to provide support when able -''there were quite a few times early on when. . .if there was three of us between the two ECMO patients, one of us would go off and give them [the new TLs and floats] a hand''.",

(2006) suggested that it would be reasonable to consider significantly reducing or banning visitors during this time because of the risk of spreading the disease, the difficulty of guaranteeing the correct PPE for visitors and the risk of lapses in infection control protocols by visitors. The nursing management agreed that if a pandemic was to occur again, the unnecessary visitors would indeed be restricted. However, the welfare of the patient's significant others during this stressful period must also be taken into account. Therefore, a change of communication methods will be necessary and a daily phone call to one relative may be required to update them of the patient's condition, in the event that a ban on visiting was in effect (Gomersall et al., 2006) . Additionally, it is also important to ensure that only health care workers essential in the care of the patient are permitted to enter the isolated area.",

            "text": "It is paramount that effective communication channels are maintained during this time. One way this was achieved in the ICU was the appointment of one intensive care specialist as the pandemic coordinator and the staff identified this as being extremely helpful. This role involved being the coordinator of the pandemic, managing all issues pertaining to the pandemic including communications with external departments and dealing with any issues arising from the pandemic that did not involve direct patient care issues. This allowed the other intensive care specialists and nursing staff to concentrate on the care of the patient. This appointment of a coordinator role streamlined communication both within the unit and also externally and there was no confusion about who to communicate with regarding pandemic issues. Another useful measure identified in maintaining good communication channels was a daily meeting between the senior medical and nursing staff which provided a forum to feedback issues to each other and problem solve.",

            "text": "Maintaining adequate numbers of appropriately skilled staff was identified by nursing management as a major challenge during this period. The importance of matching the high acuity of the patients with appropriately skilled staff is an important method to ensure the safe care of all ICU patients. It has been shown that nurse inexperience can adversely impact on the quality of care provided to critically ill patients (Morrison et al., 2001) and the contributing factors to such occurrences were all present during the recent pandemic -staff shortages, high unit activity and lower levels of supervision. Additionally, many staff were working a large amount of overtime during the pandemic and this has also been shown to increase both errors and near misses (Scott et al., 2006) . However, the reality of the situation was that if the medical and nursing staff had not have worked the extra hours, it would not have been possible to staff the ICU. The nurse managers identified that in a future pandemic actions to minimise staffing problems would include limiting annual leave during this time and also booking contract or agency nursing staff in advance to cover the increased staffing needs of the ICU. It is essential to increase staffing levels during a pandemic period to assist in facilitating adherence to staffing protocols, to facilitate adequate meal breaks for staff and to assist bedside nursing staff in getting supplies and running blood tests. If safe to do so, the transfer of lower acuity patients to nearby ICUs should also be considered to reduce the burden on staff.",

Placing a wardsperson on duty overnight would facilitate the completion of essential cleaning duties which were difficult to complete during the busy daytime hours. There was no increase in wardsperson hours during the height of the pandemic despite requests from ICU management and this must be remedied in the event of a future pandemic. The importance of the wardsperson's role in the successful functioning of the ICU during a pandemic period must be recognised by hospital management and resources must be put in place to deal with the extra workload.",

Issues which were important to the staff while caring for these patients were: the wearing of PPE for long periods, while essential, was physically uncomfortable and difficult; adequate stocks of PPE must be ensured; good communication was crucial in ensuring the efficient dissemination of information particularly regarding infection control measures and the disease process; adequate staffing levels must be maintained and the increase in staffing levels must be anticipated; the education of staff in advanced therapies (such as ECMO) is of great importance in coping with the increased demands of the pandemic; and the care of these patients and their loved ones is physically and emotionally demanding. Recommendations for future pandemic planning which can be drawn from this study include the appointment of a dedicated infection control representative to provide information and support regarding infection control matters; the maintenance of effective communication channels is crucial and the appointment of a pandemic coordinator should be considered; and the increased staffing requirements across nursing, medical, allied health and ancillary staff to cope with the higher patient numbers and acuity must be anticipated and planned for. The findings of our study offer valuable insights into the frontline medical and nursing staffs' experiences of a pandemic and it is hoped they provide valuable information for health care professionals and policy makers to assist them in planning for future pandemic outbreaks.",
