Many international agencies have made similar statements regarding the effect of health on FDI inflows. Such claims have bolstered the position of health on the global development agenda. To date, however, a relationship between population health and FDI has not been established in the empirical literature. The aim of this paper is to investigate whether population health encourages inflows of FDI after controlling for other relevant variables. This study is important for two main reasons. First, developing countries continue to face severe resource constraints. Placing budgetary priority on health interventions at the expense of competing claims merits a strong evidence-based foundation. Second, the expanding role of FDI in the global economy has made understanding its determinants a priority for both researchers and policy makers.",

During the past two decades, global inflows of FDI have soared: from $59 billion in 1982 to $651 billion in 2002 (UNCTAD, 2003) . Attracting FDI is important for countries at all stages of development. It has been argued, however, that inducing greater FDI inflows is of more importance to developing countries given their lower savings rates and income levels. Indeed, FDI now represents the largest component of net resource flows to developing countries, surpassing official development assistance (ODA), portfolio investments, and bank loans (Miyamoto, 2003) .",

            "text": "In addition to providing much needed capital, FDI has other attributes of particular relevance for developing economies. These attributes include expanding access of domestic firms to global markets and facilitating the transfer of technology. FDI may also increase tax revenue for the host economy and enhance the competitiveness of the domestic market through spillover effects (Loungani & Razin, 2001; UNCTAD, 2004a) . These potential benefits of FDI have been widely publicized. Leaders gathered at the International Conference on Financing for Development (ICFD), held in Mexico in 2002, characterized FDI as an engine for economic growth and an integral component of poverty alleviation. The Monterrey Consensus, adopted at the ICFD, stated, ''A central challenge, therefore, is to create the necessary domestic and international conditions to facilitate direct investment flows . . . to developing countries'' (United Nations, 2002) . This challenge has not yet been met. Global FDI inflows are not distributed evenly. Industrialized economies are the most likely destination for FDI; and some developing countries receive much greater inflows than others. 2 African countries in particular have struggled to attract foreign investors (see Morisset, 2002) . In 2002, Africa attracted only $11 billion in foreign investment; far less than Central Europe ($28.7 billion), Latin America ($56 billion), or Asia ($95.1 billion) (UNCTAD, 2003) . Asiedu (2002) , empirically investigating the determinants of FDI to developing countries, found that sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries were less likely to attract investors than non-SSA countries, despite the fact that US investment into SSA had a higher rate of return than investment in other developing regions. Furthermore, factors proven to promote FDI to non-SSA countries (such as infrastructure and return on capital investment) did not have a clear impact on FDI to SSA countries. A survey conducted by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) of the leading multinational enterprises supported Asiedu's results. Only one out of every five respondents expected higher inflows to African countries over the next two years, and two-thirds believed that the current level of flows would remain unchanged (UNCTAD, 2004b) .",

            "text": "Under standard neoclassical assumptions (where output is produced by capital and labor), capital is predicted to flow from wealthy to poor countries until capital-labor ratios equalize across countries. The observed pattern of FDI, with most capital flowing from one wealthy country to another, is thus an apparent paradox. Lucas (1990) argues that differences in human capital could explain this paradoxical pattern. Recently, there has been renewed interest in the idea that human capital might play a role in encouraging foreign investment. To the extent that physical capital and skills are complementary inputs, the presence of a healthy and more highly educated workforce can increase the productivity of capital. This is driven in part by economic activity shifting first from the primary goods to manufacturing sectors and then toward services, which are successively more knowledge intensive. For example, in the early 1970s, the services sector accounted for only 25% of the world FDI stock. By 2002, services had risen to about 60% of the total stock (UNCTAD, 2004a) . FDI geared to knowledge-and skill-intensive industries may imply that countries with higher levels of human capital are more attractive to investors (Blomstr\u00f6 m & Kokko, 2003; Miyamoto, 2003; Noorbakhsh, Paloni, & Youssef, 2001) . Most cross-country studies investigating this idea identify human capital narrowly with education, ignoring strong reasons for considering health as an integral component of human capital. Therefore, in a natural extension of the literature, we investigate whether the health status of the population encourages inflows of FDI. In Section 3, we review empirical evidence establishing health as a form of human capital and summarize circumstantial evidence suggesting a link between health and FDI.",

Healthier children have enhanced cognitive function and higher school attendance, allowing them to become better educated, higher earning adults (Bhargava, 2001; Bloom, 2005) . Healthier workers, who have lower rates of absenteeism and longer life expectancies, acquire more job experience. Better health also improves the prospective lifespan of workers. In countries with low life expectancies, the prospect of retiring is remote. Once better health becomes more common, retirement seems more attainable. Increased longevity, therefore, can generate the need for retirement income and set off a savings and investment boom (Bloom, Canning, & Graham, 2003) . Health improvements may also affect the age structure of populations. Initially, such improvements tend to reduce mortality rates among infants and children, since interventions to reduce childhood mortality are usually neither costly nor complex. As parents come to expect more of their children to survive to adulthood, fertility rates fall. This change produces a baby boom generation. The fall in birth rates, coming as it does after a fall in mortality rates, means that the large baby boom generation is unique, with much smaller cohorts before and after it. As this generation enters the workforce, it may provide a boost to productivity leading to economic growth (Bloom & Canning, 2000) .",

As the CMH report suggested, a healthy workforce could enhance worker productivity and attract FDI inflows. However, health may also encourage FDI via other mechanisms. Firm profitability may suffer if health-related costs are high. Companies operating in countries where health infrastructure and personnel are lacking may need to develop or significantly subsidize a health care system for their employees. 3 Sick leave, funeral costs, and low workforce morale represent additional burdens for investing firms. In addition, for fear of endangering their own health and that of their expatriate staff, foreign investors may shun areas where disease is rampant and where access to health care is limited. Foreign investors and their managerial staff may lack resistance to disease, either acquired or inherited, that the host country population enjoys. For example, a significant portion of the population in Africa carries the sickle cell trait. This condition confers protection from severe malaria and is much less common among European descendants (Pasvol, Weatherall, & Wilson, 1978) . A similar reduction in disease severity has been observed with certain types of thalassemia (Clegg & Weatherall, 1999) . Indeed, these inherited hemoglobinopathies are thought to persist among certain African and Asian populations because natural selection favors alleles offering protection against malarial illness.",

The two effects of income per capita on FDI can be thought of as generating a coefficient b = (b 1 + b 2 ) on income per capita in our regressions where b 1 represents its scale effect on absorptive capacity and b 2 represents its effect on average input prices. Provided the model is correctly specified, there is no problem in estimating the total effect of income per capita (b 1 + b 2 ) though we cannot identify the individual parts of this effect. While this will not affect the validity of our estimation, the coefficient on GDP per capita should be interpreted with caution because it may reflect both the market size and the cost effect that tend to move in opposite directions. Note that the market size effect is usually associated with horizontal FDI, while in our model a positive effect of market size on vertical FDI may be due to the economies' ability to absorb FDI inflows without pushing up the price of capital.

However, Murray and Lopez (1996) demonstrate that higher life expectancy is associated with lower morbidity and overall better health status. Furthermore, Shastry and Weil (2002) report that the survival rate of adult males is linearly related to adult male height, which is often used as a measure of health human capital in microeconomic studies (e.g., Savedoff & Schultz, 2000; Schultz, 2002) . These findings establish a relationship between mortality and morbidity measurements. However, health is a multidimensional concept and it is likely that our life expectancy measure does not capture the full complexity of population health. Different dimensions of health may have differing economic consequences (e.g., Gallup & Sachs, 2001 , show that endemic malaria affects economic growth, even after accounting for life expectancy). We leave the study of the effects of different components of population health on FDI to future research.",

While inland areas can access markets through rail or road links, these are often much more expensive forms of transportation. Thus, we include a dummy variable for whether a country is landlocked with the stipulation that the country is not located in Western or Central Europe (countries in Western and Central Europe have close proximity to a major market and the absence of sea routes may not matter).

We constructed gross FDI inflows using data from the World Development Indicators (World Bank, 2003) . The World Development Indicators does not include data on gross inflows directly, but does provide data on total gross flows (the sum of gross inflows and gross outflows) and on net inflows (gross inflows minus gross outflows), from which gross inflows can be derived. We calculated gross FDI inflows using the following two relationships: We multiply this by GDP (constant 1995 US$) to obtain gross FDI inflows. All explanatory variables are taken at the beginning of the relevant time period. 11 Summary statistics for the full sample are presented in Table 1 . The correlation coefficients for the full sample of 74 countries are presented in Table 2 . Life expectancy ranks second only to GDP per capita in strength of raw correlation to log gross FDI inflows. Table 2 shows that life expectancy is highly correlated with income per capita (a correlation coefficient of just above 0.9). However, while this correlation tends to increase the size of the estimated standard errors in our regressions, it does not undermine the consistency of the estimates or the validity of the inference we can draw assuming that the functional form of our model is specified correctly.

This finding is consistent with the conflicting evidence on the importance of education in determining the inflows of FDI.

The reason for the poorly determined coefficient on secondary schooling in our model could be measurement error in the data on education that biases the estimated coefficient toward zero (see Krueger & Lindahl, 2001) . We also tried other measures of education, such as the number of accumulated years of education in the population aged 15-64 and school enrollment rates, but did not find any measure that produced a statistically significant effect.",

The results reported in column (4) indicate that the coefficient on life expectancy is robust to these alternate specifications, though many of the controls do not themselves appear to be statistically significant. 12 Recent evidence suggests that pooling data from industrial and developing countries in empirical FDI studies may yield misleading coefficient estimates (Blonigen & Wang, 2004) . We might expect that developing countries are more dependent on export-oriented FDI, while industrial countries are more attractive for market-seeking FDI (Shatz & Venables, 2000) . Of particular relevance to the current study, we noted a gap in average life expectancy between income groups: 75.2 years for high-income countries versus 59.4 years for low-and middle-income countries. Diminishing returns to health might well make it a more important investment in low-income countries. We therefore analyze the model using two restricted samples, one of low-and middle-income countries and one of high-income countries selected on the basis of the World Bank's income classification. 13 The results for low-and middle-income countries are reported in Table 4 . The model being estimated in Table 4 is identical to that reported in Table 3 , the only difference being the sample. The results are broadly similar to those listed in Table 3 . The coefficient on openness is somewhat larger than before, which is consistent with foreign investment to developing countries being mainly export-oriented. Life expectancy once again has a positive and statistically significant effect on FDI. The large decrease in the coefficient on GDP per capita when we add life expectancy to the model indicates that when health is excluded from the model, GDP per capita is, to some extent, serving as a proxy for health in low-and middle-income countries.",

It is also consistent with Alesina and Weder (1999) , who argue that the relationship between corruption and economic performance is complicated. Some types of corruption may allow the relatively efficient provision of services to foreign firms, its main effect being on the distribution of domestic economic gains, with little distortion of productive activities. Table 5 uses the same specifications as Table  3 for a sample restricted to high-income countries. The sample size now becomes quite small and may lead to some variables becoming statistically insignificant simply because of a lack of power; therefore, these results should be treated with caution. Unlike the results reported from the previous two samples; openness, GDP per capita, and bureaucratic quality are not statistically significant. The lack of significance of openness is consistent with the idea that FDI going to industrial countries is mainly to access their markets rather than to export.",

Reduced corruption does appear to have a positive and significant impact on FDI in this sample; indicating that the type of corruption, or the way it affects the economy, may differ between industrial and developing countries.

This leads us to reject the hypothesis that the coefficients reported in the two sub-samples are the same at the 5% significance level.

The positive coefficient on life expectancy may be due to factors correlated with health that we could not control for in the model. Future studies should confirm the robustness of our findings and attempt to disaggregate the health effect we have identified. It may be that certain diseases have a greater impact on FDI inflows than others. For example, diseases that afflict the working-age population (e.g., HIV/AIDS) or are easily transmittable (e.g., tuberculosis) may deter FDI inflows more than chronic, non-communicable diseases. Perhaps diseases with a high morbidity affect FDI differently than those with a high mortality. It is difficult to carry out this type of detailed analysis at the cross-country level, but it may be possible in more local settings. Despite these qualifications, our main result is that a one-year improvement in life expectancy is associated with a 9% increase in gross FDI inflows to low-and middle-income countries, and this result seems fairly robust. These findings are consistent with the view that health is an integral component of human capital for developing countries and suggest that the payoff to improved population health is also likely to include an elevated rate of FDI inflows.

Because data are not available for 1980, we used the earliest available data (during 1983-87) for the index of corruption and quality of bureaucratic institutions over both time periods. The data for the variable, ''percent of population 100 kilometers from the coast or an ocean-navigable waterway,'' are estimated using geographic information system (GIS) technology, which does not date back to 1980. Despite this limitation, the variable was included in the model as a determinant of trade costs. We also tried other geographic variables (e.g., land area in the tropics) but none were significant.",
