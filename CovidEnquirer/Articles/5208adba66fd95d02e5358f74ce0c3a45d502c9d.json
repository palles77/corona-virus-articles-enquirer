In 2005, an optimized pancoronavirus reverse transcription-PCR assay was used to explore the incidence of HCoV-NL63 infection in children in Belgium who had a diagnosis of respiratory tract infection (4) .

Reptilian erythrocytes are nucleated, and commercial lysis methods clogged fi ltration columns because of the high DNA content of whole blood. Consequently, DNA was extracted from frozen whole blood by using a modifi ed alkaline lysis method adapted from an avian cell culture DNA extraction method (10). PCR screening for Bartonella was performed by using primers for the 16S-23S internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region (Table) . Bartonella ITS-positive samples were further screened by using primers for a consensus sequence of the phage-associated gene Pap31 (9) . Primers for the 28S rRNA were used as a housekeeping gene. The PCR-positive control contained 0.002 pg/\u03bcL of B. henselae H1. Water was the negative PCR control. Amplicons of the expected sizes were consistently obtained from housekeeping gene and positive control reactions, while amplicons were never obtained from negative controls. ITS amplicons were obtained from 16 (43%) of 37 sea turtle blood samples tested, including samples from 13 free-ranging and 3 rehabilitated turtles. Pap31 PCR was performed for Bartonella ITS-PCR-positive samples. Pap31 amplicons were obtained from 5 samples of which 3 were successfully sequenced. Amplifi cation and sequencing of the 16S-23S ITS region detected 2 Bartonella species: a B. henselae-like organisms and 1 more similar to B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffi i. The 3 Pap31 amplicons successfully sequenced confi rmed B. henselae infection. Sequences obtained from 1 sample matched B. henselae strains H1-like, the B. henselae SA2-like strain, and B. vinsonii subsp. berkhoffi i genotypes II and IV, which suggests that this turtle was co-infected with multiple Bartonella spp. and strains. Three other samples yielded amplicons 99%-100% identical with B. henselae strain SA2, and 3 yielded sequences most similar to B. vinsonii subspecies berkhoffi i genotypes II and IV. Two samples contained an ITS region sequence most similar to B. henselae SA2, but with a 15-bp deletion beginning 617 bases downstream from the 16S rRNA gene. Whether these ITS sequence differences represent distinct strains or nonrandom translocation events is uncertain.",
