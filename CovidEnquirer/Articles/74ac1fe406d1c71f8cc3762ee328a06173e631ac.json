When you breathe through the mouth -for example when you blow out a candle or suck through a strawthe soft palate is arched upward to form a seal against Passavant's ridge at the top of the pharynx. This form of airways obstruction is a normal function. Similarly, under normal circumstances, the genioglossus muscle of the tongue has a high resting tone in conscious subjects, and this holds the tongue forward, preventing it from obstructing the airway. During sleep, and particularly in those suffering from the dangerous condition of obstructive sleep apnoea, the tongue falls against the back wall of the pharynx and obstructs breathing. The muscle tone of the pharynx itself becomes reduced, particularly during REM (rapid eye movement) sleep and in OSA the pharynx collapses under the negative pressure of inspiration. Blocking of the airways by the tongue also and almost inevitably occurs during general anaesthesia and requires immediate attention from the anaesthetist.",

The resistance to breathing of the nose is about twice that of the mouth and nearly half the total resistance of the airways. The disadvantage of this is offset by the advantage obtained by the air-conditioning and fi ltering activities of the nose, which warm, moisten and fi lter the air before it comes in contact with the delicate respiratory regions of the lungs. Newborn babies have great diffi culty breathing through their mouths: they are almost obligate nose breathers and become very distressed when their nose is blocked. Their predominantly nose breathing may be associated with their ability to suckle and breathe at the same time. On the other hand, many animal species, such as rabbits, manage to eat and breathe at the same time by having lateral food channels on either side of the larynx (see below) that bypass the airway. Marine mammals such as whales have completely separate air and food channels, with the airway ending at the back of the head.",

Each nostril narrows to form its nasal valve, and at this level the total cross-sectional area of the airways is narrower (3 mm 2 ) than anywhere else in the system. This narrowing imposes the majority of the high resistance to airfl ow found in the nose (see Chapter 5) and, combined with the sharp turn the inspiratory air must make as it enters the wide (140 mm 2 ) lumen of the cavum of the nose, causes turbulence. The walls of the nasal cavum are rigid bone projecting out into the airway from the lateral walls as the turbinates . These have a large surface area (150 cm 2 ) covered by vascular mucosal erectile tissue important in the ' air-conditioning ' activities of the nose. This mucosal tissue can swell considerably in conditions such as rhinitis (described above), and it is here that nasal decongestants such as oxymetazoline, an agonist of \u03b1 adrenergic receptors on vascular smooth muscle, act to clear a blocked nose by causing the vascular smooth muscle to contract.",

This fusion results in an ultrathin layer ideal for the diffusion of gas but not much good for support.

The pulmonary arterioles are also very different from systemic arterioles, having very little smooth muscle in their walls. This absence of smooth muscle in the arterioles, and of course the capillaries and venules, persuades many scientists to consider the microcirculation of the lungs as a whole, rather than making a special case of the capillaries, which snake along several alveolar walls, one after the other, before reaching the venules. Venules join to form veins which, unlike the arteries, do not travel with the airways but make their own way along the septa that separate the segments of the lung. The airways and pulmonary blood vessels down as far as the terminal bronchioles receive their nutrition from the bronchial circulation which, as part of the systemic circulation, is distinct from the pulmonary circulation of the lungs. Part of the bronchial circulation returns to the systemic venous system in the normal way, but part drains into the pulmonary veins, ' contaminating ' their oxygenated blood with deoxygenated blood.

Not only do the external intercostal muscles help to bring about this reduction in pressure, but by stiffening the chest wall during inspiration they prevent a ' sucking-in ' of the chest (just as you can suck in your cheeks) that would take place if they did not contract. The action of the intercostal muscles accounts for about 25% of maximum voluntary ventilation. The importance of the ribs and intercostal muscles to breathing is seen in patients whose ribs are broken and who exhibit what is known as ' fl ail chest ' in which the chest wall moves in during inspiration and out during expiration. Although expiration is largely passive during quiet breathing (resulting from the elastic recoil of the lungs -like a balloon collapsing) expiratory muscles can contract actively during high levels of breathing or if the airways are obstructed by disease. Under these conditions the abdominal muscles are the most important muscles of expiration. By squeezing the contents of the abdomen up against the diaphragm they force it up into the chest, thereby expelling air from the lungs. These abdominal muscles are especially active during a cough or a sneeze, as will be apparent if you press your fi ngers into your abdomen and cough. The internal and innermost intercostal muscles, like the external intercostals, occupy the spaces between the ribs and are innervated by segmental nerves. They pull the ribs down, reduce the diameter of the chest, and so contribute to expiration. Like the external intercostals, they reinforce the spaces between the ribs and prevent the chest from bulging out during expiration. The changes in size and shape of the chest brought about by the activity of the diaphragm, intercostals and accessory muscles are transmitted to the outer surface of the lungs. Because the lungs are so fl exible, any change in pressure on their surface is rapidly transmitted to the air within the alveoli. This does not mean that the actual pressure in the fl uid between the layers of pleura that form the covering of the lungs and the lining of the chest is the same as the pressure in the alveoli (see Chapter 5): in fact, it is important for the student to realize that they are very different.",

When premature delivery of an infant is threatened its ability to secrete surfactant is estimated by measuring the ratio of lecithin to sphingomyelin in its amniotic fl uid. If necessary, the activity of the type II pneumocytes can be enhanced by the administration of corticosteroids, and after birth exogenous surfactant can be administered as an aerosol.

Because the volume (and hence the mass) of a drop is related to the cube of its diameter and its surface area is related to the square of its diameter, large drops fall faster than smaller ones. A shower of rain falls to the ground; a mist remains suspended for some time (Stoke's Law tells us that the terminal velocity of a falling sphere is proportional to the square of its radius). Scientists interested in the way aerosols behave in the lungs often convert the weight and shape of the particles into the size of the aerodynamically equivalent spheres. The mass median diameter of an aerosol is the diameter about which 50% of the total particle mass resides. The mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) is the product of the mass median diameter and the square root of the particle density. Using this system we see 95% of particles \u03fe 5 mm MMAD impact on the walls of the nose and pharynx, where they are trapped by the sticky mucus. This impaction is the result of turbulence and the particles ' momentum throwing them out of the airstream, when they rapidly change direction. In our noses the mucus that has trapped the dust is wafted to the pharynx by cilia. It is then swallowed. In dogs the cilia beat toward the outside and this contributes to the wet nose of a healthy dog. Slightly smaller particles (1 -5 mm) survive the twists and turbulence of the upper airways and are removed by sedimentation in the small airways. Sedimentation is the settling of particles ' under gravity, and this slow process is only effective in the small airways because their diameter is so small that the particles have only a little way to fall. Small though they are, these particles are too massive to be much affected by the buffeting of the gas molecules around them that constitutes the phenomenon of diffusion. Particles which reach the wall of the small airways are trapped in the mucus there and travel up the mucociliary escalator at a rate of about 2 mm s \u03ea 1 to the pharynx in considerable amounts, to be swallowed. The mucus blanket which traps the particles is 5 -10 mm thick and in two layers. The outer gel layer rests on a less viscous layer in which the cilia beat toward the mouth at a frequency of about 20 Hz.",

They are also beyond the end of the ciliary escalator. In the alveolar region amoeboid macrophages ( Fig. 2.17 ) engulf particles and carry them to the escalator, or take them into the blood or lymph. When the dust load is large the macrophages dump their load around the respiratory, bronchioles, and any pathologist from a coal-mining area will have seen the black ' halos ' so formed. Bacteria are particularly susceptible to the attentions of macrophages, which kill them with enzymes and oxygen-based free radicals (see Metabolic activity, p. 26) or transport them out of the lungs. The activities of these phagocytic cells ensure that the alveolar region of the lung is effectively sterile. The free radicals and proteases produced by macrophages to deal with foreign material have the potential to damage the lung itself; how these dangerous substances are neutralized is described below (Metabolic activity, p. 36) .",
