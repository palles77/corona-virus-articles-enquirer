The inquiry is guided by multidisciplinary behaviouralrelated theories. The analyses employed a long span of Bursa Malaysia stock market data from 1977 to 2014 along the different phases of economic development and market states. The tests confirmed the presence of asymmetric dynamic behaviour of prices predictability as well as risk and return relationships across different market states, risk states and quantiles data segments. The efficiency tests show trends of an adaptive pattern of weak market efficiency across various economic phases and market states. Collectively, these evidences lend support to boundedadaptive rational of investors' behaviour, dynamic stock price behaviour, and accordingly forming bounded-adaptive market efficiency.",

Since its development in the 1960s, the notion of efficient markets has been subjected to intense theoretical and empirical debate for more than century (Ackert & Deaves, 2010; Shefrin, 2007) . Nonetheless, this fundamental issue remains puzzled today after for more than 40 years (Verheyden, de Moore, & den Bossche, 2015) . In this line of enquiries, the debated issue is whether the market is fully efficient in accordance to efficient market hypothesis (EMH) in modern finance paradigm or adaptively efficient according with the adaptive market hypothesis (AMH) in behavioural finance paradigm. While the AMH is still new with limited empirical support, mounting evidence of market imperfection and inefficiency challenge the validity of EMH.",

This instability and inefficiency although short lived, will persist consistently in the market so long normal people are trading in the market because of constant human nature that will regularly produce financial fads, euphoria and gloom (Sanford, 1994; Slezak, 2003) . In behavioural finance paradigm, this instability and inefficiency are due to behavioural risks that are critical for Asia emerging financial markets (Kim & Nofsinger, 2008) . Despite the above arguments, the importance of investor and market imperfection has been ignored in academic and practice due to the popularity of modern finance thoughts. However, relying solely on modern finance perspective probably mislead practitioners as noted below;",

This paradigm postulates that reasonable people should act rationally as postulated in rational choice theory (Arrow, 1958) . The rational decision means that human think and decides to maximize wealth as described in expected utility theory idealize by von Neumann and Morgenstern in 1944 (Quiggin, 1982) . This implies that individual preference is static with risk adverse behaviour and asset prices only influenced by fundamental. Accordingly, constant rational human behaviour expected to imply normality, random walk, mean reversion properties of stock prices, and no expected excess returns. This theorized in the random walk behaviour of stock prices by Louis Bachelier in 1900 and a martingale model of stock prices by Paul Samuelson in 1965 (Fama, 1965) . Collectively, this will imply the non-predictability of stock prices to exploit arbitrage conditions. Holding investor and prices behaviours as assumed, a random process of financial series will exhibit independent and identical distribution, such as a Gaussian with zero mean and constant variance (Lim, Liew, & Wong, 2005) .",

First, markets are made up of large, competent and fully informed investors that are always aiming for profitmaximization and risk averse in their decision-making. Second, all agents have homogeneous expectations. Third, current information about the economy and individual firm fundamental are freely available and always instantaneously and correctly fully reflect available information. Fourth, no taxes, no transaction costs, and no danger of bankruptcy. Fifth, competitive pressure among economic agents will keep securities fairly priced as any opportunity to realize an excess profit is exploited without delay and thus disappears (Chittedi, 2014; Fama, 1970) . These will collectively form an equilibrium financial market with perfect and competitive under conditions of uncertainty (LeRoy, 1989) .

The bounded rational theory asserts that a normal human being is not entirely rational in their decision making due to various behavioural heuristics and biases (Simon, 1955) and individual decisions are under time-inconsistent preferences, incomplete information, and different learning environment (Brocas & Carrillo, 2000) . Further, neuroscience perspectives justify the dual process (i.e. cognitive and affective) of human neural basis that rationalize the rational (i.e. cognitive logic) and irrational (i.e. cognitive heuristics and affective bias) factors influencing human decision making (Carmerer, Loewenstein, & Prelec, 2004; Shimp, Mitchell, Beas, Bizon, & Setlow, 2015) .

The first theory is bounded rational market has been suggested in Miller (1987) as a result of bounded rational human behaviour. Bounded rational decision influences the market fluctuations in the following three ways. First, it adds noise to investor decisions and cause disturbances in market fluctuations. Second, it will lead investor to replace the optimizing behaviour with rules of thumb which will result in a frequent fluctuation in market behaviour. Third, it creates a new cost to decision deliberation that may engender various adjustments in behaviour and affect the market fluctuations accordingly (Conlisk, 1996) . The second theory is AMH introduced by Lo (2004), which is idealized based on interdisciplinary theories that consist of bounded rationality, complex systems, evolutionary biology, and evolutionary psychology. AMH is relevant in recognizing the variation of investor and market behaviours in today the complex and dynamic market environment (Meier, 2014; Soufian, Forbes, & Hudson, 2014) . Additionally, the evolving stock return predictability can be rationalized within the framework of the adaptive markets hypothesis (Lim & Brooks, 2011) .",

This implies the still dominance of modern finance paradigm to the majority finance scholars. Nonetheless, the awarding of the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel 2013 1 to Eugene Fama, Lars Peter Hansen and Robert Shiller provides a testimony that both modern-and behavioural-finance are a valid paradigm in finance. This paper revisits this efficiency issue in Malaysian stock market in the context of behavioural finance paradigm. Guided by multidisciplinary behavioural theories, we position our investigation of Malaysian stock market efficiency based on the belief that investors are bounded-adaptive rational, stock prices are asymmetrically dynamic, and the market is bounded-adaptive efficient. In this research, the findings lend support to the validity of behavioural finance's theoretical perspectives on the nature of individual, asset prices, and stock market behaviours.",

At the end of 2014 after for about 25 years later, there were 911 3 companies listed on the Main and ACE market boards.

Historically, various political events both in local and international fronts have, to a certain degree influenced the performance of the Malaysian stock market and in some cases, the effect on the stock market is very drastic particularly for politically connected firms (Ali, 1997; Mitchell & Joseph, 2010) . Political shocks can cause either overreaction or underreaction in the stock market (Ali, Nassir, Hassan, & Abidin, 2010 ) and this will result in short-term non-linearity in prices (Lim & Hinich, 2005) . Regulatory changes (amendments) have also been performed to promote further the efficiency and growth of the capital market in Malaysia (Yong, 1994) . For instance, the Second Board was introduced in 1989 to encourage listings of small firms. The government had implemented a short-term capital control in 1994 and in 1998 (Ocampo & Stiglitz, 2008) to curve financial market excessive volatility due to speculative activities.",

In this respect, various economic cycles in Malaysia have influenced the stock market. In the early 1970se1990s, Malaysia economy is concentrated on resources-based and export-oriented and has been known as the world's leading exporter of tin, rubber and palm oil (George, 1991; Kean, 1986) . Accordingly, most of the quoted firms very much dependent on the export of primary commodities and soaring commodity prices in the 1980s have been the main driver for stock market boom during this time (Kean, 1986; Yong, 1994) . In line with the economic and capital market liberalization moves in 1990, Malaysia experienced rapid economic growth spurred by increased government spending, foreign direct investments and exports (Ocampo & Stiglitz, 2008) . Capital market liberalization provides both opportunities and challenges to the Malaysian stock market. Advocates of capital market liberalization beliefs that it will increase economic growth and market efficiency as well as reduce risk (Ang & McKibbin, 2007; Kim & Singal, 2000; Ben Rejeb & Boughrara, 2013) . However, empirical evidence revealed that capital market liberalization does not bring the benefits promised by the theory. Rather, it further contributes to the degree of financial market volatility (Chittedi, 2014) and instability (worsening of market efficiency) especially in thin stock markets in developing countries with worldwide cross-boarders influx of irrational and rational exuberance and pessimism that created a contagion of opinions and bubbles in financial markets (Ocampo & Stiglitz, 2008) . In no exception, the Malaysian stock market has been very sensitive to both internal and external economic and financial crises. Those crises, including the following; IraneIraq war (06/81e08/82), Black Monday (08/87e12/87), US recession (08/90e09/90), Mexican financial crisis (01/ 94e01/95), Asian financial crisis (02/97e09/98), 911 attacks and technology slump (04/01e04/02), SARS (04/02e03/03), Subprime crisis (01/08e10/08), and US crisis (10/08e12/09) (The Edge Malaysia, 2008 4 ; Chong, 2011) .",

Enhancement of technology used in the KLSE and stock broking companies has made it possible for the system to handle a significant increase in trading volume (Ali, 1997) . In 1982, KLSE started to use computerization by setting up the data processing department in May 1982. However, the first daily business report was only published in February 1983. Initiated the computerization of clearing systems in November 1983 and was fully completed in March 1984. Installation of real-time share prices reporting and corporate announcements (MASA) was available in 1987 for brokers and subscribers that have enhanced the speed of information transmissions (Butler et al., 1991) . In May 1989, a semi-automated trading system called system of computerized order routing and execution (SCORE) was implemented to facilitate and improve the speed of shares trading through electronic systems (Nasir & Mohamad, 1993; Yong, 1994) .

First cluster (1970e1990) is for pre-industrialization/ liberalization/information technology revolution. During this period, trading activity in the stock market is relatively limited and slow (Arief, 1975) and the market characteristic has been noted to reflect the weak-form EMH. A second cluster (1991e1999) is for post-industrialization/liberalization/ information technology revolution. In the post-1990, consensus on market efficiency in Malaysia has been generally in support for the weak form of EMH while acknowledging the present of temporary inefficiency. The third cluster is the new millennium era (2000ecurrent). This period is associated with a high degree of individual involvement in the stock market that increases trading and volatility (Hollifield, 2002; Sanderson, 1998; Schwert, 2002) . However, recent research provides evidence of multifractal market efficiency. A summary of these researches are summarized in Table 2 .",

The first study to reconcile the evidence of Malaysian stock market efficiency based on the AMH is given by Lim and others through a series of empirical research. This research noted that linear and nonlinear dependencies play a role in the data generating process. The nature of price dependency is not stable which is in line with the adaptive nature of price evolution as postulated by AMH (Lim, 2007 .",

            "text": "The bounded-rational theory (Simon, 1955) , prospect theory (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) , and adaptive expectation theory (Tinbergen, 1939) collectively describes heterogeneity roles of investor decision and preferences. In line with this assumption, the asset prices formation in financial markets is believed to be best described by the dynamic asset price theory (Westerhoff, 2003) . Taken together, the investor and price formation behaviour will form an adaptive efficient market as described by AMH (Lo, 2004 (Lo, , 2005 (Lo, , 2012 ) that prescribed the dynamic behaviour of financial markets due to a complex combination of investor behaviour across time and circumstances that are adapting to information and technological changes (Nawrocki & Viole, 2014) . While AMH is still in infancy stage, the theory's validity is supported by empirical research from both developed and emerging financial markets (see Hiremath & Kumari, 2014; Kim, Shamsuddin, & Lim, 2011; Lo, 2004; Todea, Ulici, & Silaghi, 2009; Urquhart & Hudson, 2013; Verheyden et al., 2015) . The current research offers a different theoretical and methods to examine the AMH validity. Specifically, the prospect theory's hypothetical value function (Fig. 3 ) and the quantile regression p function (Fig. 4 ) are used to analyse the heterogeneity of riskereturn relationships. This idea is motivated by other scholars' works as briefly discussed herein. The use of prospect theory is more appropriate in behavioural finance research as suggested by prominent scholars in this area (Barberis, 2013; Barberis, Huang, & Santos, 2001; Shiller, 1999) . To be specific, the prospect theory postulates that individuals behave differently in their decision making that is risk-seeking in losses domain and risk-averse in gains domain with the middle point being the reference points. Due to the expected heterogeneity behaviour of investors at the individual security and market level, the nonparametric and nonlinear statistics are best suited for inferential analysis in behavioural finance (Nawrocki & Viole, 2014) . In line with this idea, quantile regression is one of the suitable methods. This nonparametric quantile-based risk measures seek to estimate risks without making strong assumptions about the distribution under consideration and estimate risk measures from the entire distribution. Thus, this method avoids the risk of model misspecification, which could bias the estimated risk measures (Dowd & Blake, 2006) . More importantly, this method is compatible in validating the adapting preferences as postulated by the prospect theory. In particular, quantile regression can distinguish between negative returns (lower quantiles) and positive returns (upper quantiles) behaviours. In this regard, the beta is expected to be greater in negative conditions (due to risk-seeking over losses) and smaller in positive conditions (due to risk-averse over gain) (Baur & Schulze, 2010) . In the market efficient test, the quantile autoregressive model approach has been recently used by Muller, Righi, and Ceretta (2015) . We also acknowledge that earlier works have investigated the dynamic behaviour of riskereturn relationships and market efficiency in emerging markets, including Malaysia 5 but guided by different theoretical underpinnings and methods. As the research focuses exclusively on behavioural finance perspective, we neglected the bulk of modern finance literature concerning the same issue.",

In OLS method, the estimation of model prediction error (\u03b5 i ) is based on minimization of P i \u03b5 2 i . As an alternative, in QR method as presented in Eq. (4), the relationship between dependent and independent variables are estimated based on the conditional median function, Q \u00f0q\u00de \u00f0y i jx i \u00de of specific quantile (q) of the empirical distribution. Where conditional quantiles range between 0 < q < 1 and the QR can be performed from q0 to q1 with q0.5 known as the median regression. This means that, the data is split into proportions of q below and 1 \u00c0 q above. In the estimation of the model prediction error, median regression minimizes P i \u03b5 i and QR minimizes a sum that gives asymmetric penalties \u00f01 \u00c0 q\u00dej\u03b5 i j for overprediction and qj\u03b5 i j for underprediction. Unlike OLS, the QR is more robust to outliers and does not require fulfilment of normal distribution of the error process (Koenker & Bassett, 1978; Koenker & Hallock, 2001) .",

This evidence is in confirmation with the previous market efficiency studies conducted in Malaysia. In addition, the level of market efficiency decreases as the number of lags increases.

These forces indirectly have improved the degree of weak market efficiency in Malaysia in particular and in emerging markets in general, despite the fact that it has been evolving to adapt to economic cycles and series of financial crises (see Abiad, Oomes, & Ueda, 2008; Ben Rejeb & Boughrara, 2013 Bekaert, Harvey, & Lundblad, 2003; Henry, 2000; Nguyen & Fontaine, 2006; Rizvi & Arshad, 2014 . Most importantly, the Malaysian capital market institutions noted to have improved after the implementation of a Capital Market Master Plan in 1999, which have improvised regulatory framework and corporate governance (Gimet & Lagoarde-Segot, 2011) . Based on the market states condition, the pattern of stock returns autocorrelation independence is homogeneous in crisis states compared to non-crisis states which indicate the presence weak efficiency. This is also consistent with VR test that shows relatively higher VR value during the crisis compared to non-crisis market states. The insignificant of autocorrelation test in this crisis-sub sample provides evidence of unpredictability pattern of stock returns using its past price information. We caution readers for generalization of our findings due to contradictory opinion drawn from existing studies which argued that the weak market efficiency pattern is deteriorating in Malaysia during the crisis market states (see Kim & Shamsuddin, 2008; Lim, Brooks, & Kim, 2008; Rizvi & Arshad, 2016) . In addition, our finding might also be due to less noisy monthly data used. In the meantime, we provide possible theoretical justification on this finding. The psychology-based negativity bias hypothesis states that people are more sensitive to negative events compared to positive ones and the effect of negative news is stronger than positive news (Kanouse, 1984) . Based on this hypothesis, we argue that during crisis market states, the negativity biases are homogeneous to all investors and that enhance the predictable pattern of price behaviours. On the other hand, during non-crisis market states, investors' information and opinion divergences are large and weaken the predictable pattern of price behaviour.",

            "text": "This section provides an assessment of bounded rational of investors and asymmetric dynamic behaviour of stock prices. Behavioural finance assumes risk forces comprise of fundamental and behavioural risks, and riskereturn relationships are to be asymmetrically dynamic due to bounded-adaptive rational of investors thinking and decisions. To validate this, the asymmetric dynamic behaviour of stock prices in extreme losses and extreme gains of data distributions according to the perspective of prospect theory is examined. This theory postulates that the investor decides based on loss and gains, and experiencing losses are more painful to humans compared to experiencing gains. Accordingly, the OLS and QR estimations for return autocorrelations with its lag 1 values are estimated and the results are as presented in Fig. 5 . The average mean-based Fig. 5 . Stock return autocorrelations using quantile regression approach. Notes: The OLS figures represent the coefficient and R 2 , which is significant at 1% level. The figures in grey and black histograms are the coefficient and R 2 for QR for the respective quantiles (q). Coefficients in q0.01, q0.05, q0.1, q0.98, and q0.99 are significant at 1% level. While coefficients for q0.5 and q0.9 are insignificant. (OLS) and quantiles-based (QR) estimations yield a different conclusion with regards to the nature of returns autocorrelation. The OLS analysis, which is based on Gaussian assumptions indicated that past returns information is positively related to contemporaneous returns. On the other hand, the alternative non-Gaussian QR analysis revealed that the autocorrelations relationship is asymmetric. The relationships are positive and significant in extreme losses, negative and significant in extreme gains, and insignificant in median points. Also noted that the risk influence to return is stronger in losses compared to gains a situation that is in confirmation to prospect theory theoretical ideas. These findings are in line with recent studies conducted by Baur, Dimpfl, and Jung (2012) and Zhu, Li, and Zeng (2015) . Practically, in loss situations, investors are generally panic and scared of further losses. Thus, risk forces are very sensitive to the stock prices. In gains situation, most investors opt to liquidate their investments for profit taking. These provide justification on negative riskereturn relationships in the upper quantiles. In prediction comparison (based on R 2 ), OLS underestimate the effect on lower quantiles and overestimate the effect on upper quantiles. In the next analyses, selected fundamental (i.e. KLCI t\u00c01 , CI, LAI, LEI) and behavioural (i.e. BCS, CSI, VOL) risks influence on aggregate stock market returns are examined in both contemporaneous and future returns perspective. This is to gauge the bounded rational investors as proxies by the influence of both fundamental and behavioural risks in their stock investment decision. The results are as summarized in Tables 6 and 7. In both contemporaneous and future returns analysis, the OLS and QR analyses provide a different conclusion with regards to the influence and significance of the relationship of risk variables examined. The influences of selected fundamental and behavioural risks are significant, but heterogeneous on the condition of market states and risk states. We draw readers' attention to the emerging patterns in the analysis with justifications from the behavioural finance theoretical lenses.",

This is consistent with growing evidence of investors irrationality among retail and institutional investors (Akerlof & Shiller, 2009; Garling, Kirchler, Lewis, & Raaij, 2009 ). Due to the bounded-adaptive of investors' behaviour, stock prices show a dynamic behaviour. Dynamic means stock prices trending in non-linear fashion and the riskereturn relationships are heterogeneous across specific conditions. This in line with suggestions by some earlier scholars (Baur, 2013; Baur et al., 2012; Blume & Easley, 1992; Fiegenbaum, 1990) .

Some scholars' suggestions are summarized here. On an individual level, fund managers need to recognize their own and others mistakes, to understand the reasons for these mistakes, and to avoid mistakes (Shefrin, 2000) . In portfolio management, Shefrin and Statman (2000) develop a behavioural portfolio theory and suggested its implications for optimal portfolio construction that are segregated into multiple mental accounts that resemble both bonds and lottery like features. In investment strategy, an adaptive investment strategy argued to be more efficient in a complex market system that is changing over time due to constant information and technological changes (Mauboussin, 2002; Nawrocki & Viole, 2014) . In line with this intuition, several authors have proposed a possible adaptive investment approaches as follows. Livanas (2007) provides interesting ideas on the construction of optimal portfolio. To simplify, the author suggests that the value of portfolio gains should be higher that the value of portfolio losses to hedge on the risk of investors asymmetric risk tolerance. In Zhu (2013) , the author develops a distribution-based framework for return prediction and portfolio selection. Howard (2014) introduces some thought on behavioural portfolio management strategies from asset allocation to stock selection, and market selection. Last but not least, Ma (2015) , a practitioner, introduces three different ways to develop investment strategies with the ability of adapting to economic regimes, market returns, or market volatility changes. Equally important, there is a need to enhance awareness and action on corporate governance to address behavioural biases in investment institutions (Suto & Toshino, 2005) .",

The needs to regulate these behavioural risks have been discussed in details by some scholars (see Cunningham, 2002; Daniel, Hirshleifer, & Teoh, 2002; Li, 2008) but still have been largely neglected so far. These scholars suggested some important issues for policy consideration including; the need to educate investors on behavioural risks, the need to promote the efficiency of the markets by minimizing the effect of behavioural risks, and the need to incorporate mechanisms to protect investors from excessive behavioural risks in the current corporate governance framework. In this regards, the study of Klapper and Love (2004) for 14 emerging markets provide evidence to support that better corporate governance is highly correlated with better operating performance and fair market valuation.",

Drawing from theoretical and empirical evidence from the current research, it is important to view the nature of market efficiency as prescribed by AMH. This efficiency theoretical framework offers the following advantages. First, this framework theoretically connects investors bounded and adaptive rationality which will collectively determine price formation, then induced a degree of market stability and finally creates the bounded and adaptive market efficiency. Second, will also be consistent with consideration of multifactor fundamental and behavioural risks that possibly influenced the stock price formation. Third, the theoretical framework will be compatible with various methods that aim to recognize many stylized properties in financial prices. More importantly, the consistency of the philosophical, theoretical and methods are essential in scientific research inquiry and for a fair view of financial market reality. To mitigate excessive behavioural risks that will ensure reasonable fundamental valuation in the stock market and stable efficiency of financial markets, behavioural risks need to be curved right from the investor behaviour, fund management practice, and market regulations. Going forward, joining Verheyden et al. (2015) calling, we suggest that future research is geared towards further examination and development of the theory of adaptive markets and its implications for investor education, investment portfolio management, and financial market regulation and governance.",
