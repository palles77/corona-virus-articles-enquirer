MSCs have been isolated from different tissues including adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, synovium, spleen, thymus, blood, lung, fetal blood and amniotic fluid [2] . Several studies using a variety of animal models have shown that MSCs may have a role in the repair and regeneration of injured lung, infarcted myocardium, and damaged bone, tendon and cartilage [3] [4] [5] [6] . Following infusion of in vitro expanded MSCs in the lung, MSCs have been detected as type I and type II alveolar epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and bronchial epithelial cells [7] . Although not as tested yet, logically lung MSCs would be more efficient in treating lung diseases as compared to BM-MSCs.",

Microscopically, the cultured cells showed fibroblast-like morphology. Phenotypically these cells expressed CD44, CD90, CD105 and the transcription factor PouV, which has been shown to be critical for stem cell self-renewal and pluripotency. The multipotency of chicken MSCs was demonstrated by their ability to undergo adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation. Like chicken bone marrow MSCs and mammalian MSCs, chicken lung MSCs had immunoregulatory activity and profoundly suppressed the proliferative capacity of T cells in response to a mitogenic stimulus. Next, we examined the susceptibility of these cells to H1N1 and H9N5 avian influenza (AI) viruses. The lung MSCs were shown to express known influenza virus alpha-2,3 and alpha-2,6 sialic acid receptors and to support replication of both the avian H1N1 and avian H9N5 influenza strains. Viral infection of MSCs resulted in cell lysis and cytokine and chemokine production. Further characterization of lung MSCs in chicken and other mammalian species may help in understanding the pathogenesis of infectious and non-infectious lung diseases and the mechanisms of lung injury repair.",

Rous sarcoma virus, the first tumor virus, and the oncogene (src) were identified in the chicken thus, the chicken serves as a model organism for the study of viruses and cancer. The chicken immune system provided the first indications of the distinctions between T-and B-cells, with the B-cell nomenclature based on the avian bursa of Fabricius [24] . MSCs derived from lungs could be a very valuable source for use in cell therapy applications on the lung. In addition, we have also provided evidence that chicken lung MSCs are susceptible to infection with AI virus and infected MSCs produce proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines, and therefore, may play an important role in the pathogenesis of influenza infection. We also discuss the potential implications of these observations for infection with highly pathogenic influenza viruses.",

However, this is the first report showing the infection of lung MSCs with influenza virus. Additionally, we detected the expression of IL-6 and IL-8 in AI virus-infected lung MSCs. Production of IL-6 and IL-8 was also detected in human BM-MSCs stimulated with poly(I:C) [41, 42] . IL-6 regulates inflammatory responses and hematopoiesis [43] , and its overproduction relates to the pathology of autoimmune diseases and tissue remodeling. Conversely, IL-8 is present in the inflammatory milieu during tissue repair [44] . The production of IL-6 and IL-8 thus suggests that infection of lung MSCs with AI virus might affect their differentiation potential and potentiate the inflammatory response as observed in avian and mammalian species following infection with influenza virus [18, 21, 22] . The mechanism responsible for this hyperimmune activation is not known. Based on our findings and other reports on mechanisms of immune regulation by MSCs, we speculate that infection and lysis of MSCs by AI virus might result in local immune dysregulation allowing infiltration and proliferation of inflammatory cells in the infected lung with excessive production of proinflammatory cytokines. Secondly, as MSCs have been shown to induce the production of T regs [13] , lysis and/or apoptosis of MSCs by AI virus and excessive proinflammatory cytokine production by immune cells and MSCs may mediate the depletion of T regs, again contributing to the dysregulated immune response in the lung. Future studies will be directed to examine the proportions of T regs in influenza virus-infected MSCs-T-cell co-cultures and the mediators responsible for inducing alterations in the proportions of T regs.",

Due to non-availability of cross-reactive Oct4 antibody, we were not able to directly assess infection of lung MSCs with AI virus in virus-infected chicken lung sections. Interestingly, earlier studies [46, 47] showed the susceptibility of Oct4 expressing putative lung stem cells to SARS-corona virus infection in mouse lungs.

Our findings suggest that in addition to respiratory epithelial cells, AI virus infects lung MSCs resulting in cell lysis and the production of proinflammatory cytokines. The death of the lung MSCs and the resulting local immune dysregulation may contribute to lung damage, loss of repair capacity, and respiratory failure. Further characterization of these MSCs in chicken and other MSCs were infected with H1N1 or H9N5. After indicated times, total cellular RNA was extracted and subjected to qRT-PCRs by using specific primers to IL-6, IL-8 or 28S rRNA. Quantitation of the IL-6 and IL-8 mRNA was determined by the comparative cycle threshold (CT) method. RNA isolated from uninfected control cultures was used as the reference sample (calibrator) at each time point. The relative change in mRNA concentration (DCT) for each virus-infected sample was then determined from the difference between the calibrator CT and the CT of each virus-infected sample. Fold increase of IL-6 and IL-8 transcript expression over uninfected controls was calculated with the 2 DDCT method. The data are representative of two separate experiments. mammalian species may help in understanding the pathogenesis of infectious and non-infectious lung diseases and the mechanisms of lung injury repair.",

Cultures were incubated for 48 h and for the final 6 h of culture [ 3 H] TdR was added to the wells. Results are expressed as percentage of proliferation, with the positive control (in the absence of MSCs) at 100%. The values are averages AE S.D. of triplicate determinations. The data are representative of three separate experiments.",
