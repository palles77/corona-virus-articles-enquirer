STUDY DESIGN: Exploratory studies were conducted using spleens from septic patients and from mice with abdominal sepsis. Seven patients with sepsis after injury were identified retrospectively and compared with six injured patients. C57BL/6 male mice were subjected to cecal ligation and puncture, or to IP lipopolysaccharide. Control mice had sham laparotomy or injection of IP saline, respectively. A sepsis classification model was created and tested on blood samples from septic mice.",

For blood studies, classifiers were constructed using data from a training data set of 26 microarrays. The error rate of the classifiers was estimated on seven de-identified microarrays, and then on a subsequent cross-validation for all 33 blood microarrays. Estimates of classification accuracy of sepsis in human spleen were 67.1%; in mouse spleen, 96%; and in mouse blood, 94.4% (all estimates were based on nested cross-validation). Lists of genes with substantial changes in expression between study and control groups were used to identify nine mouse common inflammatory response genes, six of which were mapped into a single pathway using contemporary pathway analysis tools. CONCLUSIONS: Sepsis induces changes in mouse leukocyte gene expression that can be used to diagnose sepsis apart from systemic inflammation.

The cornerstone of successful therapy is early, accurate diagnosis, coupled with eradication of the source of infection and appropriate antibiotic therapy. 2 Unfortunately, efforts to identify specific and sensitive diagnostic markers for sepsis have met with limited success. 3 The diagnosis of sepsis in ICUs is especially challenging because it is frequently difficult to distinguish between systemic inflammation and systemic infection. Clinicians are unable to identify the pathogen responsible for sepsis in up to 50% of patients or to determine whether patients are responding to antibiotic therapy 1 ; and the traditional means of identifying the organism responsible for bacterial infections are nonspecific (Gram stain), slow (culture), or insensitive (both Gram stain and culture).",

This molecular classification strategy involves searching for expression patterns in a subset of genes from tissues of known phenotype (the \"training\" data set), constructing a prediction rule, and then using these \"biomarker\" genes to predict the phenotype of new samples (the \"test\" data set). Studies that apply these genome-wide technologies to inflammation and sepsis in animal models and patients are now underway, [11] [12] [13] [14] as reviewed recently. 15, 16 These reports suggest that genome-wide profiling of gene expression holds promise as a molecular diagnostic tool, capable of generating profiles from leukocytes that are sensitive, specific, and timely for pathogen detection. 13 Despite provocative in vitro findings, 4, 5 there are few reports of using microarrays to study sepsis in vivo. These reports indicate that the transcriptional response during polymicrobial sepsis is organ-specific in mice 12 and rats. 11 There are no reports of using microarrays to make a diagnosis of sepsis, although very recent reports suggest that this will be feasible in patients. 17, 18 We hypothesized that leukocyte gene expression profiles obtained using DNA microarrays could be used to predict septic states; in particular, distinguishing between sterile and infectious sources of systemic inflammation, a common conundrum in caring for the critically ill or injured.

Seven-to nineweek-old, male C57BL/6 mice were purchased (Harlan, Inc) and allowed to acclimatize for at least 1 week. Male mice were used to avoid the confounding effect of the female estrous cycle and the well-characterized sexual dimorphism of the adaptive response to cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). 20 The seven experimental groups were designed to make classification difficult, reflecting clinically important distinctions relevant to care of ICU patients: lethal abdominal inflammation from a sterile source, lethal abdominal infection, and antibiotictreated abdominal infection. Mice were assigned to the seven treatments listed in Table 1 , grouped into those with no deaths (controls) and those that were \"sick\" with substantial associated mortality (sterile or infectious causes of systemic inflammation). Normal animals were untreated. Previously reported protocols were used to perform CLP and sham laparotomy. 21, 22 The ceca of some animals were punctured twice using a 25-gauge needle (CLP), and others were punctured using a 27gauge needle to produce a \"milder\" sepsis that caused much lower mortality (Mild CLP). Animals that had laparotomy and cecal manipulation without ligation or puncture were included in the sham laparotomy group (Sham). Another group of animals had CLP and treatment with a standard antibiotic regimen for mouse abdominal sepsis: IP ceftriaxone 6.4 mg/kg and metronidazole 3.5 mg/kg, delivered 1, 12, and 24 hours after CLP (CLP \u03e9 antibiotics group). 23 To induce severe systemic inflammation without infection, IP injection of Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide (LPS) serotype 0111:B4 20 mg/kg (Sigma, Inc) was performed (LPS group). 24 The dose of LPS (20 mg/kg) was used because it reliably produces death over several days in the animals; smaller doses in pilot experiments tended to produce morbidity without mortality. Mice injected IP with Abbreviations and Acronyms CLP \u03ed cecal ligation and puncture FDR \u03ed false discovery rate EST \u03ed expressed sequence tag IP \u03ed intraperitoneal LPS \u03ed lipopolysaccharide PCA \u03ed principal components analysis normal saline vehicle (Saline group) acted as the concurrent control group for LPS treatment. The census of surviving mice was recorded at 24-hour intervals for 7 days. In a separate cohort, mice were sacrificed at 24 hours after injury by cervical dislocation under halothane general anesthesia. The 24-hours time point after injury was chosen because pilot experiments showed that the ability to distinguish between spleen expression profiles was greater at 24 hours than at 48 or 72 hours after injury. 25 Whole spleen tissue from eight CLP and eight Sham mice was harvested and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u03ea80\u00b0C. In another cohort of animals, intracardiac blood from eight animals per group was pooled using the PAXgene Blood RNA System to derive total RNA from whole blood (PreAnalytiX GmbH). While 5 GeneChips from blood for each of the seven groups were prepared, there were a total of 35 mouse blood GeneChips from 280 animals: 28 Gene-Chips were in the training data set and 7 GeneChips were in the test (de-identified) data set.",

Differences in apparent gene expression between the Sepsis and Injury (control) phenotypes were used to construct a classifier, the accuracy estimate of which was 67.1%. This small, exploratory clinical study provided \"bedside\" proof of feasibility using human transcriptional profiles to model the septic phenotype, but also demonstrated a large degree of variance in gene expression between subjects, because of both technical and biologic differences. To control more of this variance we moved from the bedside to the bench, performing a systematic examination of the diagnostic potential of spleen and blood gene expression profiling in inbred mice. Consistent with the human data, spleen samples from mice after CLP exhibited microarray patterns that could be modeled to predict the septic phenotype. The nested cross-validation accuracy estimate of 96.0% for sepsis prediction using mouse spleen was considerably better than that found using human spleen, likely because of the mouse experimental design that exploited fresh tissues and identical age, gender, and genotype across subjects. Because the clinical use of gene expression analysis using splenic tissue is severely limited, we explored next the use of circulating blood for class prediction in our mouse models. The combined accuracy of the predictions for any-CLP versus non-CLP and LPS versus controls was high at 94.4% and 93.2%, respectively. The accuracy estimate for distinguishing between the high and low mortality CLP groups (CLP versus Mild CLP and CLP plus antibiotics) at this 24-hour time point was much less at 62.4%. These conclusions are consistent with the PCA analysis in Figure 4 , in which we sought differences in apparent Table 3 . ABX, antibiotics. gene expression across the seven experimental groups. Interestingly, the only samples that were cluster outliers were in the CLP plus antibiotics group, consistent with an effect of antibiotics to change the septic phenotype toward the control phenotypes. We conclude that circulating blood gene expression profiles can be used to predict CLP and non-CLP phenotypes in prospective cohorts, in particular, distinguishing controls from lethal endotoxicosis (LPS) from lethal infection (CLP). It is important to note that at this 24-hour time point, there were no substantial differences between LPS or any of the CLP groups in clinical presentation or complete blood counts. Microarray analysis could make the diagnosis of sepsis (distinguishing between sterile and infectious sources of systemic inflammation) when clinical criteria and white blood cell counts could not, a frequent occurrence in ICUs. 33 In addition, the differences between groups as measured by absolute fold-changes in individual gene expression were small (eg, in the final model for blood, 86.4% of genes were altered less than twofold), yet the changes in the patterns of expression across hundreds of genes were robust predictors of phenotype.",

            "text": "To discover changes in expression generic to the inflammatory and septic responses, we used the intersection of gene lists identified by the pair-wise group comparisons (Fig. 5) . Nine genes were commonly increased, validated across two tissue types (spleen and blood) and two insults (CLP and LPS). In contrast, there were no genes that were commonly decreased. Given that this list of nine genes was based on changes in relative RNA abundance across a number of cell types, the network analysis performed served as an exploratory tool, validating in silico the role of six of nine genes in canonical pathways for inflammation, apoptosis, and signal transduction: inhibitor of DNA binding 2, calgranulin A and B, interferon regulatory factor 7, lipocalin 2, and formyl peptide receptor-like 1 ( Table 4) . Several characteristics of these nine common inflammatory response genes are notable. Inhibitor of DNA binding 2 is required for normal mouse immune development, especially of lymph nodes and Peyer's patches. 34 Calgranulin A and B, which belong to a recently described group of proinflammatory molecules, form extracellular complexes that bind to and activate endothelial cells, promoting chemotaxis and phagocytic adhesion in a positive feedback manner. 35, 36 Interferon regulatory factor 7 is a key regulatory of monocyte development, essential to differentiation of monocytes to macrophages. 37 Lipocalin 2 is a secreted protein that undergoes transcriptional induction after cytokine withdrawal and induces leukocyte-specific apoptosis. 38 Lipocalin 2 transcription, translation, and secretion are induced by ligation of Toll-like receptors on leukocytes, with secreted lipocalin 2 acting to sequester siderophores, thereby limiting bacterial growth. 39 Formyl peptide receptor-like 1 is a member of the chemoattractant subfamily of G protein- coupled receptors that are involved in controlling leukocyte migration. 40 The other two annotated genes not listed in the network, neutrophilic granule protein and serum amyloid A3, have also been associated with inflammation and cellular defense, although less is known about their functions and protein interactions. Neutrophilic granule protein is a cysteine protease inhibitor that has been associated with myeloid differentiation. 41 Serum amyloid A3 is a highdensity apolipoprotein, the only amyloid made by both hepatocytes and peripheral monocytes and macrophages. 42 It is believed to function by retargeting transported lipids, including cholesterol, in the disposal of toxins. 42 The function of the ninth gene, a retroviral species that is increased in a number of different models of infection and inflammation, is not known. We compared this common inflammatory response cluster with the list of proteins recently reported to diagnose intra-amniotic infection in patients, 18 as another means of validating the importance of these nine genes. Of the 11 proteins and polypeptides detected in that study, 3 were also identified in our study, specifically calgranulin A and B and lipocalin 2 (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin). Calgranulin A (S100A8) was also the most differentially expressed gene in blood in a small microarray study comparing eight septic patients with four surgical controls with-out systemic inflammation. 17 Serum amyloid A protein was identified as a plasma proteome biomarker in patients with coronavirus (severe ARDS). 43 Together, these studies support our hypothesis that there are a group of common inflammatory response genes that can be used as novel biomarkers to diagnose inflammation across species, tissue, and different types of infecting organisms, at either the RNA or protein level.",

Nevertheless, the data from these patients have proved invaluable for the study of immune dysfunction in human sepsis 2 and provided proof-ofprinciple here that molecular profiles of human lymphoid tissues could be used to distinguish between septic and nonseptic phenotypes. Because cellular populations of mammalian tissues are heterogeneous, use of microarray profiles to study the cellular response to a given stimulus must be understood in the context of changes in cell populations. This substantially limits conclusions about whole spleen data, given our reports and those of others that sepsis accelerates splenocyte apoptosis. 2, 19, 44 In contrast, changes in blood cellular heterogeneity are measured routinely. Although CLP and LPS stimuli changed both absolute WBCs and cell differentials compared with the controls, among the four groups of \"sick\" animals cell counts were indistinguishable (Fig. 2) . This mirrors the clinical situation where differentiating between sterile (LPS) and infectious (any-CLP) sources of systemic inflammation is not possible based on clinical grounds or cell counts. Microarray profiles, as we have discussed, were very successful at making this distinction.",

Our data are unique in that they show that transcriptome molecular profiles can distinguish between sterile and infectious causes of systemic inflammation and can make a diagnosis of sepsis in pro- spective cohorts. Importantly, we observed that the magnitude of change in gene expression that was needed to predict the septic phenotype was very small. It was the pattern of these small changes in expression that were predictive, not the magnitude of any single change. We and others reported recently validated clinical protocols for blood gene expression profiling used to characterize the human systemic inflammatory response. 13, 14 The data presented here suggest that these protocols should be extended to clinical trials, testing the efficacy of microarray gene expression profiling to diagnose human sepsis. We expect that these studies will provide new insight into how specific pathogens uniquely perturb the physiology of cir-culating leukocytes and how the host successfully mounts pathogen-specific defenses. .

A contemporary pathway analysis tool was used to automatically create a network of interactions among these nine genes, based on previously reported interactions in the literature.

            "text": "Tests for differential expression, class prediction, and pathway analysis: For the mouse blood study, a mixed-model ANOVA was used to detect differential expression between treatment groups, with a linear contrast between the any-CLP and non-CLP groups. The ANOVA model was chosen to partition treatment group and technical batch variability from variability due to biological and experimental noise. The following linear mixed model was used to detect differential expression on a gene-bygene basis in the mouse blood data:where y gij is the expression of the gth gene for ith treatment and jth batch. The mean expression for the gth gene is given by g . The symbols T and B represent effects due to treatment and batch respectively. The error for the gth gene for sample ij is designated as gij . For the mixed-model analysis of variance, treatment is a fixed effect and batch is a random effect. A batch constitutes 7 samples (one from each treatment group) which were processed and hybridized at the same time. In the case of the last batch (batch 5), the GeneChips were scanned on a different scanner. For the mouse and human spleen studies samples were processed in a single batch, so a simple one-way analysis of variance with a contrast between any-CLP and non-CLP was used to identify differentially expressed genes. The linear contrast between any-CLP and non-CLP is given by:where CLP is the mean of the CLP group, CLP\u03e9ABX is the mean of the CLP\u03e9ABX group, etc.Where possible, the following competing classifiers were considered for all tasks, and the optimal classifier was selected: number of genes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 , 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 450, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 2000, 5000, and 10000), prior probabilities for nearest centroid (equal and proportional), functions for discriminant analysis (liner and quadratic), prior probabilities for discriminant analysis (equal and proportional), number of neighbors (k) for k-NN (1, 3, and 5), and distance functions for k-NN (Euclidean distance, Pearson's linear correlation, and absolute value distance). Thus as many as 426 classification models were considered for each classification task.For the mouse blood data, we used a leave-one-batchout (5-fold, one for each of the 5 batches) outer crossvalidation, while the inner cross-validation is leave-onesample-out. We refer to this as nested cross-validation with an outer \"leave-one-batch-out\" layer and an inner \"leave-one-sample-out\" layer. (27) Using this method, the determination of how many and which genes to use for classification were determined using only the training samples. In addition, all additional classifier parameters (e.g., number of neighbors and distance measure) were determined using only the training samples. For each held-out batch in the outer 5-fold cross-validation, the classifier and genes that performed best on inner cross-validation were selected and applied to the 6 or 7 held-out test samples (two batches only had 6 samples due to removal of an outlier sample). For the mouse and human spleen data where all samples were processed in a single batch, both the outer and inner cross-validation used full leave-one-sample-out. 598 .e1",
