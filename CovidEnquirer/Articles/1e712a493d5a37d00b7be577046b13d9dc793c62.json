We found that standard vaccine preparations of recombinant Modified Vaccinia virus Ankara produce only about 20-30% plaque-forming virions in fully permissive cell cultures. To evaluate the biological activity of the non-plaque-forming particles, we generated recombinant viruses expressing fluorescent reporter proteins under transcriptional control of specific viral early and late promoters. Live cell imaging and automated counting by fluorescent microscopy indicated that virtually all virus particles can enter cells and switch on viral gene expression. Although most of the non-plaque-forming infections are arrested at the level of viral early gene expression, we detected activation of late viral transcription in 10-20% of single infected cells. Thus, nonplaque-forming particles are biologically active, and likely contribute to the immunogenicity of vaccinia virus vaccines.",

            "text": "Vaccinia virus (VACV) is the best-studied poxvirus and the prototype live virus vaccine used to eradicate human smallpox (for review see (Moss, 2013a) ). VACV was among the first animal viruses to be cultured and purified (Maitland and Maitland, 1928; F. Parker and Nye, 1925; R.F. Parker and Rivers, 1935; Steinhardt et al., 1913) . Early studies with virus preparations from the skin of infected rabbits (Smadel et al., 1939) or the chorioallantois membrane (CAM) of embryonated chicken eggs (Dumbell et al., 1957) already provided evidence that more total particles (also called \"elementary bodies\") are produced than infectious VACV virions. Indeed, a ratio of 10 total particles to 1 plaque-forming unit (PFU) was determined for purified preparations of VACV using a protocol of ultracentrifugation through sucrose-gradient similar to the one still used for producing vaccine preparations (Joklik, 1962) . A single study using semi-purified (removal of cellular debris from virus harvest via low-speed centrifugation) MVA and comparing EM counted particles to tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TICD50) determined 2-3-fold more total particles than the TICD50 (Guggenberger, 1989) . This biological phenomenon is true for many animal viruses, and even when disregarding morphologically or biochemically \"incomplete\" virions, 10 to 1 million virus particles are usually needed to initiate a single event of infection (Isaacs, 1957) .",

MVA lost its ability to productively replicate in most mammalian cells, but maintained expression of all classes of viral and recombinant genes under conditions of non-permissive viral growth. Therefore MVA can serve as an exceptionally safe live viral vector vaccine (Sutter and Moss, 1992) .

After imaging we fixed the infected cell cultures and performed a standard VACV-specific immunostaining assay to confirm the data from plaque counting using the Hybrid Cell Count analysis assay.

We could confirm these findings in CEF cells, where 16.9% of the selected cells formed plaques, 10.6% shifted to red fluorescence without plaque development, and 72.5% remained single green fluorescent cells. As expected, MVA-GFP-mCherry infection of human HeLa cells did not result in detectable virus plaques. However, the overall ratio of infected green cells arrested at the early stage of gene expression (83.9%) to infected red cells exhibiting late gene expression (16.1%) was similar to the proportion observed in the avian cell cultures (Fig. 3A) . Next, we analyzed infections with the replication-competent CVA-GFP-mCherry in DF-1 and HeLa cells using the same experimental setting (Fig. 3B) . In DF-1 monolayers 10.1% of the selected single infected cells developed into typical plaques, 17.6% of the single cells displayed red fluorescence without formation of plaques, and 72.3% of the infected cells remained green. These results were comparable to those obtained with MVA-GFP-mCherry in DF-1 cell cultures.

Since the results from experiments with replication-competent CVA-GFP-mCherry confirmed the data seen for MVA-GFP-mCherry, we are confident about the general validity of these findings for infections with particles from different strains of VACV and possibly for infections with virions from other orthopoxviruses. The mechanistic reason(s) for the substantial portion of abortive infection events still remain unclear. One possibility is that VACV preparations commonly contain fractions of \"defective\" virions unable to initiate a full cycle of viral gene expression and productive virus replication. We examined the virus particles in our stock preparations by electron microscopy and detected only mature brick-shaped virions with normal morphology (data not shown). Yet, this apparent absence of malformed particles does not formally exclude the possibility of mutations blocking later stages of infections. Alternatively, the biology of the host cell is essential for the replication of VACV and it is tempting to speculate that simply the condition of the infected host cell determines the outcome of an infection. The activation of host cell signaling pathways e.g. involving the MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and JNK (Jun N-terminal kinase) has been shown to be critical for productive infection and VACV spread (Andrade et al., 2004; de Magalhaes et al., 2001; F. Wang et al., 2004) . Moreover, the activation of these host signaling pathways is specifically modulated in the favor of virus replication by various poxvirus regulatory proteins (de Magalhaes et al., 2001; Schweneker et al., 2012; Torres et al., 2016; G. Wang et al., 2006) . These findings are used in the development of oncolytic poxviruses that better grow in tumor cells where such pathways are malignantly activated (Bell and McFadden, 2014) . Our observation of CVA-GFP-mCherry infection resulting in enhanced plaque formation in HeLa cells might be based on the preferential productive replication of this virus in tumor cells (see Fig. 3B ).",

Both infectious forms, MV and EV, have distinct biological properties and activities: EV are responsible for efficient cell-to-cell spread and contribute to transmission within the host, while the MV play a key role in the transmission between the host animals (Blasco and Moss, 1992; Cudmore et al., 1995; Moss, 2012) .

Despite the inability of these \"defective\" virus particles to induce plaque formation, these particles are still able to switch on early gene expression. Interestingly, already early work by Galasso and Sharp (1964) suggested that \"non-replicating\" VACV particles enter cells and exert biological activities. More recently, UV-inactivated recombinant VACV is used to express early genes as nonreplicative vector in tumor immunotherapy (Zajac et al., 2003) . Thus, viral and recombinant early transcripts might serve to efficiently trigger innate immune responses and antigen production by recombinant vaccines similar to processes described for other vaccine-induced activations of immunity. In addition, these findings indicate that the choice of early or early-late promoters is an appropriate approach to most practically activate vaccine-induced immunity. Finally, our results further support the ability of MVA-based vaccines to stimulate a balanced interplay between innate and adaptive immunity as the key to robust protection against a selected pathogen.",

Briefly, the sucrose-cushion purified virus samples were diluted 1:200 and 1:400 in ViroCyt sample dilution buffer. Subsequently, 300 ml of each sample were incubated with 150 ml Combo Dye solution, a combination of two fluorescent dyes specific for proteins and nucleic acids (Stoffel et al., 2005) . After 30 min of light-protected incubation at room temperature, the virus particles were quantified in the virus counter. Simultaneous detection of both fluorescent signals using the virus counter's dual channel flow cytometer was measured as one virus particle. Intersample washes, followed by a cleanliness control run were performed between each sample analysis, and medium from uninfected CEFs was used as a negative control. Total virus particle concentration was recorded as virus particles per ml (VP/ml) and determined for at least three times per virus sample.",

Single infected fluorescent cells and plaques were quantified using Hybrid Cell Count Software (right panel).",
