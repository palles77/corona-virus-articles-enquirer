For example, intestinal ischemia that is very severe might initiate the disease in combination with bacteria that happen to be very pathogenic. Alternatively, a marked excess of substrate or the presence o~ some particularly damaging substrate could be responsible. The quantitative idea implies that there is a threshold of injury and that the damaging events exceed that threshold. We need to review each of the three pathogenic factors in some detail.",

In his experimental model, a seal was dunked into the bathtub in coot water, with an electromagnetic flow probe attached to its flipper. Oxygen consumption was measured by means that now seem primitive. During the immersion, the seal's normal heart rate of 80 to 90 beats/rain fell to 5 or 6 beats/min. Peripheral arterial pressure fell sharply, and flow virtually ceased in the periphery. During the simulated dive, which may last as long as 6 minutes, all the cardiac output went to two organs, the heart and the brain. The gut was ischemic, the kidney was ischemic, and the flippers were ischemic; those circulatory beds were shut down. When the seal surfaced, flow resumed in the flippers and other ischemic organ systems, leading to a reactive hyperemia with increased flow to those organs. Later, Scholander was able to train the seal to put its face into the water and reproduce the diving reflex. The seal knew that if it produced a good diving reflex, it would get a nice fish as a reward.",

The child was transferred from another hospital after a paracentesis that showed intestinal gangrene, and my colleagues and I were preparing to operate on him. We decided to intubate his trachea before taking him to the operating room. As the laryngoscope was put in and the endotracheal tube was passed, this baby experienced a full cardioputmonary arrest. Resuscitation was successful, and after a total of 45 minutes of compressions and of drug administration, he was breathing on his own and had good cardiovascular function. We decided to proceed to the operating room to remove the gangrenous intestine. We found a short segment of dead intestine in the ileocolic area. The small bowel was pink and viable, but as the operation progressed, the small bowel became redder, more swollen, and more distended; it then turned deep puple, looking almost like the bowel seen with gastroschisis. It was so swollen from reactive hyperemia that we could not close the abdomen and had to do what we sometimes do in cases of gastroschisis: we put a Silastic pouch on the abdomen for 3 days, until the edema resolved. Thus, anecdotally at least, the diving reflex does occur in human neonates. It is of interest that this infant did not have NEC in the portion of the small bowel that had the reflex. That portion stayed viable, as did the infant, who is a longterm survivor.",

Dr. Murray 14 outlined the complexities of the development of the bowel flora in health and disease, illustrating the little niches in the colon where the bacteria hide and set up housekeeping. The most common bacteria isolated from infants with NEC are the gram-negative rods. Klebsiella leads in most series, including ours. We have isolated Clostridium in about 20% of our infants with NEC. 15 The occurrence of cases in the NICU may be sporadic or epidemic. The occasional epidemics may be caused by or related to a single pathogen, such as an infective rotavirus 16 or coronavirus, 17 or a toxigenic strain of Escherichia coli. 18 Salmonella was implicated in the South African reports from the 1970s. 19 Usually, however, the I wish to discuss some NEC equivalents, particularly pig-bel, a disease that occurs in the highlands of New Guinea. It is a necrotic enteritis that strikes the indigenous population after pig feasting. They are mostly vegetarians, their diet containing many raw sweet potatoes, which contain trypsin inhibitors. Twice a year they feast on pig that is poorly cooked and probably contaminated with Clostridium perfringens. Murrell established the pathogenesis. After the feast, some of the children and young adults become very sick with a disease resembling NEC, characterized by abdominal distension, bloody diarrhea, and sometimes pneumatosis intestinalis. The patient is treated medically, but if complications of gut perforation or gangrene occur, surgery is required. The findings at operation are remarkably similar to those in NEC.",

Shortly after this study was published, we had a term infant in our nursery who was 2 clays of age and scheduled for discharge on the day when fulminant NEC developed. He had septic shock and an intermittent purplish coloration of the abdominal wall (livedo reticularis). His pneumatosis intestinalis was much greater than any we had seen. At operation the pneumatosis was everywhere, involving the bowel, retroperitoneum, kidneys, and bladder. The gut was infarcted from top to bottom, and there was nothing we could do surgically. The patient died shortly afterward. The peritoneal fluid contained C. perfringens. Sections of necrotic ileum (Fig. 1) contained gram-positive rods, which most likely were C. perfringens also. We studied clostridial NEC and found that infants with C. perfringens in their peritoneal fluid had a fulminant form of NEC. 15, 24, 25 They have rapid progression to gangrene and quantitatively far more pneumatosis intestinalis.

We used two side-by-side loops that were made surgically in the ileum. One was made ischemic by a microaneurysm clip that was applied for 30 Or 60 minutes to obtain two different severities of ischemia. We injected a variety of bacteria or infant formulas into the loops, with a control that was nonischemic in all animals. We found that the major determinant of necrosis was the presence of bacteria; neither ischemia nor formula alone had a significant effect. 34 Germ-free models are difficult to work with.

The bezoars were simply big milk curds that precipitated in the stomach, causing some degree of obstruction. Furthermore, casein is a chemotactic factor for human polymorphonuelear leukocytes. 48 It is used as a nonspeeific attraetant for in vitro immunologic experiments. Could it be that, in the lumen, casein binds to leukocytes--leukocytes that are there to help the gastrointestinal mucosa survive the attack from gastrointestinal bacteria and toxins?",

Then, in the fall of 1981, we had 13 cases in 5 months, and these infants were very sick; many required surgery. Very quickly, we scrutinized our hand-washing and gowning procedures and made improvements. Nevertheless, the epidemic continued. Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, we studied in detail the charts of all the infants who had had NEC, trying to identify a common pathogenic factor so that we could institute a control measure and stop the epidemic. We were elated when, after the beginning of January 1982, there were no additional cases for the next 6 months (Fig. 2) .",
