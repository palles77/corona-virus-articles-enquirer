METHODS: A prospective study during 2009 to 2013 clinically assessed acute respiratory illnesses soon after onset and 3 to 4 weeks later in patients aged !60 years with chronic lung and heart diseases (group 1, 100 subjects) and healthy adults aged 18 to 40 years (group 2, 101 subjects). Respiratory secretions were tested for nucleic acids of a panel of respiratory viruses. An increase in antibody titer was assessed for 4 coronavirus strains.",

Coronaviruses (group 1: 14 [18.9%] illnesses; group 2: 26 [21.5%] illnesses) and enteroviruses/rhinoviruses (group 1: 14 [18.9%] illnesses; group 2: 37 [30.6%] illnesses) were most common. Virus co-infections occurred in 10 illnesses. Illnesses with 9 to 11 symptoms were more common in group 1 (17 [23.0%]) than in group 2 (15 [12.4%]) (P < .05). Compared with group 2, more group 1 subjects reported dyspnea, more severe disease of longer duration, and treatment for acute illness with prednisone and antibiotics. Coronavirusassociated illnesses (percent of illnesses, group 1 vs group 2) were characterized by myalgias (21% vs 68%, P < .01), chills (50% vs 52%), dyspnea (71% vs 24%, P < .01), headache (64% vs 72%), malaise (64% vs 84%), cough (86% vs 68%), sputum production (86% vs 60%), sore throat (64% vs 80%), and nasal congestion (93% vs 96%). CONCLUSIONS: Respiratory illnesses were commonly associated with coronaviruses and enteroviruses/ rhinoviruses affecting chronically ill, older patients more than healthy, young adults.

[30] [31] [32] Coronavirusassociated illness was less severe than influenza but was associated with multiple respiratory and systemic symptoms, and hospitalization. 30 Walsh et al 33 reported HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 infection rates of 2.8% to 26% in healthy young and elderly adults, high-risk adults, and hospitalized patients during the winters of 1999 to 2003 and as contributions to medical disease burden. 33 In this multi-year, prospective study, our goal was to underscore the manifestations and importance of HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, and HCoV-HKU1, and other respiratory infections throughout the calendar year in at-risk older patients with underlying chronic cardiopulmonary and other diseases compared with young healthy adults.",

This multi-year study involved prospective interactions with study subjects throughout the calendar year, not solely during winter seasons. A weakness is that it was a single-center study in 1 geographic region. Coronaviruses and enteroviruses/rhinoviruses contributed to morbidity in both subject groups and illnesses qualifying for clinical assessment. Patients were assessed for all 4 commonly circulating coronaviruses rather than for 1 or 2, as has been the more typical report in the literature. They are alphacoronaviruses (HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63) and betacoronaviruses lineage A (HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1). The related Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus are betacoronaviruses, but of the lineages B and C, respectively. More severe illness and higher mortality rates are associated with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, although a spectrum of mild to moderate disease also occurs. 2, 3, 6, 7 Respiratory illnesses occurred throughout the calendar year, but most commonly in the first and fourth calendar quarters and least commonly in the third calendar quarter. In both age groups, coronaviruses accounted for approximately 20% of illnesses and 44% to 48% of illnesses with which a virus was associated. Because coronavirus infections were the focus of this study, we were more likely to identify coronavirus-associated illnesses due to serologic diagnosis of coronavirus infection in addition to the multiplex RT-PCR assay that detected fewer infections. Enteroviruses/rhinoviruses were as likely to be identified as coronaviruses, using only RT-PCR the results of which clinically could be available sooner than acute and convalescent serology results. Viral co-infections occurred as in other reports. 28, 33 The overall incidence of coronavirus-associated illnesses (considering all 4 strains in our study) was higher than that reported previously when testing for 2 strains (HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43). 30, 33 HCoV-OC43 was most frequent, and \"Coronavirus with another Virus\" refers to illnesses that were associated with coronavirus and a second virus.
