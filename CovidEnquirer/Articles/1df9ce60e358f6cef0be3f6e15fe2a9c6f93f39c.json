            "text": "A novel coronavirus outbreak took place in Wuhan, Hubei province, China in December 31 2019 1 . This novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causes pneumonia in patients 2 and it has 32 rapidly spread to other provinces in China and other countries 3 . This novel coronavirus 33 outbreak had raised global concern but current knowledge on the origin and transmission 34 route of the pathogen is still limited. The SARS-CoV-2 belongs to the genus Betacoronavirus, 35 which also includes two highly virulent human coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. 36 Apart from human, many animal species, such as bat, rat, camel, swine and hedgehog, can be 37 infected by different types of coronaviruses. Further sequence analyses of this novel and 38 other betacoronaviruses might provide additional information to better understand the 39 evolution of SARS-CoV-2. 40 Preferential codon usage is commonly seen in different organisms, and it has been evident 41 that the uneven codon usage is not neutral but related to gene expression or other selection 42 pressures 4-6 . There are two levels of codon usage biases, one is at amino acid level and the 43 other is at synonymous codon level. The amino acid composition of proteins can be an 44 important factor that explaining certain sequence traits. For example integral membrane 45 proteins that are enriched in hydrophobic amino acids can create significant codon usage 46 bias 7 . Amino acid composition sometime can also introduce confounding effects when one 47 only focuses on studying the variations of synonymous codon usage. The use of global 48 correspondence analysis (CA) and its derivatives within-group correspondence analysis 49 (WCA) and between-group correspondence analysis (BCA) to analyze codon usages can 50 overcome the above problem. In fact, WCA becomes \"model of choice\" for analyzing 51 synonymous codon usage in recent years, as it is more robust than other traditional methods 52 (e.g. CA with relative codon frequency or CA with RSCU values) 7,8 . This analytic approach, 53 however, has not been used in studying viral sequences. As the natural history of the SARS- 54 CoV-2 remains largely unknown, an in-depth codon usage analysis of this newly emerging 55 virus might provide some novel insights. 56 In this study, we used both CA and WCA to analyses codon usage patterns of a vast number 57 of betacoronavirus sequences. We found SARS-CoV-2 and bat SARSr-CoV have similar 58 amino acid usage. However, our analyses suggested that the spike and member genes of 59 SARS-CoV-2 have rather distinct synonymous codon usage patterns. Table S1 . 86 The codon count for every gene sequence input for the correspondence analysis was All the correspondence analyses in this study were performed individually for each gene, to 103 achieve better resolution on gene specific codon usage pattern. Gravy score provides an easy way to estimate the hydropathy character of a protein 15 . It was 117 used in this study as a proxy to identify proteins that are likely to be membrane-bound 118 proteins. The GRAVY score was calculated in a linear form on codon frequencies as: The overall amino acid and codon usage of the dataset are plotted in an ascending order 140 ( Figure 1 ). We observed that leucine and valine were the two most frequently used amino 141 acids in the four studied genes, while tryptophan, histidine and methionine were the three 142 least used ones. We also found that codons ending with cytosine or guanine were generally 143 less frequent than the codons ending with adenine or thymine. This pattern of uneven usage 144 in synonymous codons is in accordance with the G + C content distribution results (codons 145 ending with guanine or cytosine were less frequently observed). 146 We found a substantial bias in amino acid usage among these four genes, and this bias is well 147 explained by the hydropathy of the encoded proteins (results from global correspondence 148 analysis on all the four genes, collectively, data not shown). The GRAVY scores for every 149 sequence were calculated to represent the degree of hydropathy. We discovered that the 150 . CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 International license author/funder.

            "text": "Correspondence analysis 154 We first conducted a multivariate analysis of codon usage on the dataset by using global 155 correspondence analysis. We also conducted WCA and BCA to study these sequences at 156 synonymous codon usage and amino acid usage levels, respectively. Given that there were 157 different amino acid usage biases among different genes (Supplementary Figure S3) , we 158 performed correspondence analyses of these genes separately. 159 Of all the four correspondence analyses for the four genes, the extracted first factors 160 explained more than 50% of the total variance (see Supplementary Figure S4 The global codon usages of bat RatG13 virus were found most similar to SARS-CoV-2 in 196 orf1ab, spike and nucleocapsid genes, but not in membrane gene ( Figure. 2). In the analysis 197 of membrane protein, pangolin P1E virus had a more similar codon usage to SARS-CoV-2 198 than all the other viruses. We found the similarity in codon usage between pangolin P1E and 199 SARS-CoV-2 were also high in orf1ab, where P1E was the second closest data point to 200 SARS-CoV-2. But this is not the case for spike and nucleocapsid genes. 201 We also observed that the codon usage pattern in spike gene was more complex than in other (Table   217 1). 218 Results from the BCA suggested that the amino acid usage of SARS-CoV-2 is closely related 219 to bat and human SARSr-CoVs in all four genes ( Figure 3B and Figure 4B ). Specifically, we 220 discovered that the SARS-CoV-2 had amino acid usage pattern most similar to bat RaTG13 Figure S8A ). It is evident that the synonymous codon usage pattern of SARS-CoV-2 is 243 distinct from other bat origin coronaviruses. The difference in synonymous codon usage is 244 largely explained by the first factor (more than 50%), and our analysis on codon usages 245 suggest that the first factor maybe highly related to the preferential usage of codons ending 246 .

We also had similar observation for the membrane 247 gene. Our three-dimensional analysis revealed that the synonymous codon usage of SARS-248 CoV-2 in membrane was most similar to P1E and CoVZXC21 (Supplementary Figure S8B) . 249 It is worth noting that comparing to RaTG13, P1E and CoVZXC21 had lower synonymous 250 codon usage similarity to SARS-CoV-2 in the other three genes. 251 Overall, our WCA results support a more complex synonymous codon usage background on 252 spike and membrane genes, though we identified unique codon usage patterns of SARS-CoV-253 2 on these two genes. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10. 1101 /2020 In addition to global CA analysis, the application of WCA and BCA can eliminate the effects 279 caused by amino acid compositions and synonymous codon usage, respectively. These 280 alternative analytical tools were important to our study. It is because the amino acid 281 sequences are expected to be more conserved such that they can preserve biological functions 282 of the translated genes. By contrast, mutations at synonymous level tend to be more frequent, 283 as most of these codon alternatives do not affect the biological function of a protein. The S protein is responsible for receptor binding which is important for viral entry. The 302 genetic variability is extreme in spike gene 27 , and this highly mutable gene may possess 303 valuable information about recent evolution history. In our results, the synonymous codon 304 usage of SARS-CoV-2 in spike gene was distinct from those of RaTG13 and other 305 phylogenetic relatives ( Figure 3A) , which was not observed in orf1ab or nucleocapsid gene. 306 Although the codon usage in spike of SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13 and P1E were similar at amino 307 acid level, the difference at synonymous codon usage level indicates that they are unlikely to 308 share a very recent common ancestor. It is more likely that SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13 and P1E 309 might have undergone different evolution pathways for a certain period of time. The amino 310 .

These findings suggest that there may be different selection 314 forces between genes. Our result supports different evolutionary background or currently 315 unknown host adaption history in SARS-CoV-2. The codon usage of SARS-CoV-2 in 316 nucleocapsid gene was similar to bat SARSr-CoV both at amino acid level and synonymous 317 level, suggesting that no highly significant mutation happened in this gene. 318 Codon usage can be shaped by many different selection forces, including the influence from 319 host factors. Some researchers have hypothesised that the codon usage in SARS-CoV-2 320 maybe directly correlated to the codon usage of its host 28 . However our recent study on 321 influenza A viruses implied that these may not be the most influential factors shaping the 322 codon usage of a viral genome 19 . Our analysis took advantage of the existing genomes of 323 Betacoronavirus to study the complex host effect on codon usage, which warrants more 324 accurate but relatively conserved estimation. 325 ",

The codon usages 258 of viral sequences can vary by genes and host origins 21-23 . The bias in codon usage is a 259 unique and distinctive characteristic that can reflect the \"signature\" of a genomic sequence.260 Codon usage analyses are often complementary to ordinary sequence alignment-based 261 analyses which focus on the genetic distance at nucleotide level, whereas codon usage 262 analyses enable capturing signals at different sequence parameters. Therefore, codon usage 263 bias can be another good proxy for identifying unique traits (e.g. virus origin, host origin, or 264 some functions of proteins) of a genome. The goal of this study was to investigate the codon 265 usage bias of betacoronaviruses.

The GC3 content has pronounced effects on our WCA analysis of the orf1ab 272 and spike genes. The GC3 content was found correlated with high WCA values on the first 273 factor of orf1ab (Supplementary Figure S9).

The G + C 275 contents in membrane and nucleocapsid genes were less suppressed (Supplementary Figure 276 S2).
