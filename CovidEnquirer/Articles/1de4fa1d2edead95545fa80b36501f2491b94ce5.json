Rhinoviruses (RVs) are responsible for more than one-half of URTIs (Jacobs et al., 2013; Megremis et al., 2012) . RVs are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that belong to genus Enterovirus of family Picornaviridae. RVs comprise three species, Rhinovirus A, B, and C, and types within are commonly referred to by species letter and number (e.g. rhinovirus A2; RV-A2). To date, over 170 rhinovirus types have been identified, displaying high genetic and antigenic variability (Megremis et al., 2012; Tapparel et al., 2013) . RV infection carries an enormous economic burden due to the direct and indirect costs associated with the illness. In addition, to causing common cold, these viruses are the causative agents of many cases of severe pneumonia in the elderly and immunocompromised patients, as well as exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma (Jacobs et al., 2013; Tan et al., 2003; Wark et al., 2013) . Moreover, rhinovirus infection increases susceptibility to bacterial infection, e.g., by disrupting epithelial cell barrier function and promoting bacterial adhesion and internalization into epithelia (Sajjan et al., 2008; Unger et al., 2014) .",

            "text": "Because respiratory infections can be caused by a variety of viral or bacterial pathogens, accurate and timely diagnosis is crucial for optimal management and treatment. Diagnosis of RVs is challenging due to genetic and antigenic variability among the types, as well as presentation of similar signs or symptoms in patients infected by bacterial or other viral respiratory pathogens. Furthermore, rhinoviruses grow slowly in cell culture, and RV-C is currently uncultivable (Price, 1956; Lau et al., 2007) . Development of serology-and antibody-based detection methods has been hampered due to structural diversity of RV types and slowness of the immune response to generate specific antibodies. Thus, real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) remains the only sensitive method for diagnosis of RVs (\u00d6sterback et al., 2013; Dagher et al., 2004) . RT-PCR is often targeting the highly conserved 5\u2032 noncoding region (NCR) of RV types (RV NCR). However, because the RV NCR region is highly similar between enteroand rhinoviruses, most RT-PCR methods cannot distinguish between rhinoviruses and other members of the Enterovirus genus (Cassandra et al., 2011) . Consequently, commercial RV RT-PCR tests report combined results as rhinovirus + enterovirus. Furthermore, RT-qPCR requires thermal cyclers and skilled personnel, which are costly and require laboratory environments, limiting its use in field or point-of-care applications. Isothermal nucleic acid amplification methods obviate the need for thermal cyclers because the reactions are performed at low and constant temperature.",

In RT-SIBA reactions, RNA is first reverse transcribed into cDNA, and then immediately amplified and detected under isothermal reaction conditions (Fig. 1) . The SIBA method relies on separation of the target duplex by a recombinase-coated invasion oligonucleotide (IO), allowing the primers to bind and DNA polymerase to extend the target sequence. The continuous strand separation and primer extension lead to exponential amplification of the target RNA under constant temperature. RT-SIBA detected RV in clinical samples with high analytical sensitivity and specificity comparable to diagnostic RT-qPCR methods.",

(Eurofins, Germany) These plasmid were used as controls for the quantification of RV-A60 and RV-B17 viral RNA using qRT-PCR. A total of 19 microbes (other than rhinoviruses) commonly found in respiratory specimens were used to determine the analytical specificity of the assay. A total of 26 respiratory clinical isolates (21 rhinovirus, 3 coronavirus, and 2 enterovirus) were from collections of University of Turku (Turku, Finland). A total of 50 retrospective nasopharyngeal (NP) swab specimens were obtained from Helsinki University Hospital (Finland), 26 of which were positive for RV. The specimens were handled and tested anonymously.

The serotype RT-SIBA oligonucleotides were approximately 95% identical to those for serotype C (rhinovirus C26). The 5\u2032-end of the IO includes poly-cytosine nucleotides (poly-C) that are non-complementary to the target region (seeding region), which promotes optimal coating of the IO by the recombinase (Eboigbodin et al., 2016a; Hoser et al., 2014; Formosa and Alberts, 1986) .

Therefore, we sought to determine the optimal concentrations of RV-A and RV-B IO (RV-A-IO and RV-B-IO) that would efficiently amplify both RV-A and RV-B RNA in the same reaction tube.

However, an increase in the concentration of RV-A-IO also led to a dramatic increase in the time taken to detect RV-B virus (i.e., the amplification rate for RV-B RNA was slower). Similarly, increasing the RV-B-IO concentration from 100 to 400 nM decreased the detection time for RV-B RNA but increased the detection time for RV-A RNA. These results suggested that RV-A-IO and RV-B-IO compete for reaction components.

However, to further evaluate the performance of both RV assays, it will be necessary to test a larger set of clinical specimens. Another limitation of our RV SIBA assay is that it was not tested with RV-C, mainly due to the unavailability of well-characterized RV-C types. The oligonucleotides used in our assay share approximately 95% identity with RV-C26, suggesting that the assay could also detect RV-C types. However, it may be necessary to include additional oligonucleotides to facilitate optimum detection of RV-C. Because the RV SIBA assay can be performed at low and constant temperature, the reactions can be performed using relatively small and inexpensive fluorescence readers. The shorter detection time of the RV SIBA assay, along with its compatibility with portable devices, will facilitate timely diagnosis of infection, thereby improving patient care and helping in avoiding unnecessary use of antibiotics.",
