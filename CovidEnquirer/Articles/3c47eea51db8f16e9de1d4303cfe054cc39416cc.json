The first step of registration was the computation of a rigid transform to coarsely align images by registering the bone structures, using the mutual information as similarity function. The second step consisted of a deformable registration using the symmetric diffeomorphic transformation model [6, 7] with third-order B-spline regularization.

For this purpose, the mask of the baseline EI image (after HCl) was manually outlined by a trained operator and applied to all the subsequent EI and EE images of that same animal, which had been previously registered to the same coordinates. Implementation details and software code of the registration and the procedure of manual segmentation can be found in. [8] Quality of the Registration Methodology: Figure 2 shows a representative example of the output of the registration pipeline. Starting from paired EI and EE CT acquisitions, a warped expiratory map (middle panel) was obtained by registering the original EE to the EI image. In the warped 5 EE image, the bone structure and the major airways appeared to be aligned with the EI image, and the local distribution of aeration was maintained as in the original. To validate alignment of major anatomical structures, we randomly selected 15 rats providing a total of 75 pairs (five time points for each rat) of co-registered EI and EE images and 60 pairs of longitudinally coregistered (between baseline and each subsequent time points) EI images. In each pair, eight anatomic landmarks were chosen at bifurcations of major airway branches. [9] Trained operators manually recorded the spatial coordinates of each landmark, and compared the topological distance in each paired set of co-registered images. The results of the landmark validation of the registration process are shown in Figure 3 . All operator-labeled landmarks (insert) were in positions that matched reasonably well between EI and warped EE images, with average distance of 325.7\u00b1170.4 \u00b5m between the corresponding landmarks in each pair. In longitudinal CT acquisitions, landmark positions were also maintained in the warped EI images and the average distance was of 335.7\u00b1168.0 \u00b5m between markers in the original and in the warped EI images.",

Figure 4 shows examples of displacement fields in healthy and injured rats. These were extracted from the transform functions used to align EE to EI images during the registration process. The color intensity represents the amount of deformation that lung regions underwent during inflation, while the segments indicate its direction. The maps show patterns of deformation that were compatible with physiology, in both healthy and injured lungs. Finally, comparisons of density distributions were performed between the original and the warped images, in both the whole lung and in horizontal bins ( Table 1) . Warping adapts the EE image to fit the size and shape of the EI image, but the percentage of voxels allotted to each density range (as a fraction of total voxels in each image) remained unchanged between warped 6 and original images (P>0.05 by ANOVA). This confirms that no tissue type was overrepresented at the expense of the others, suggesting that distortion artifacts were minimal and percent inflation abnormalities (e.g. atelectasis, mixed aeration) were preserved during image processing.",

We used the density boundaries of each range (100 HU increments) to generate two-dimensional bins in PRM plane ( Figure 5) . These bins were then tested as a dichotomic classifier of propagation vs. stable density as follows: in each PRM we determined the fraction of voxels that showed injury progression in the subsequent PRM (after one hour); values of sensitivity and specificity for such 7 observed progression were calculated for each bin (two dimensional ranges of HU for EE and EI) and averaged for all rats ( Figure 5) . The averages were weighted by the bin-wise frequency distribution of voxels in the overall population, to assure that bins with high sensitivity and specificity for propagation but containing small numbers of voxels had limited undue influence on the assessment of the bin's overall prediction. A domain of voxels at high risk of increasing their density to the severe injury region of the PRM after one hour was then identified, where both the sensitivity and the specificity of the prediction (after averaging and normalization) were higher than 0.85 in that bin. Percent values of high risk and severe injury tissue, measured using PRM in healthy rats are shown in Table 2 . (Figure 7) . For validation of the prediction model, a jack-knifing cross-validation strategy was used (leave-one out). [12] This approach to validation was chosen due to the heterogeneity of injury trajectory in the sample population. The 8 residuals of the model were tested to assure the quality of the prediction. Then, we tested whether or not the model generated in the first stage was able to predict voxel distributions in the following time intervals larger than one hour. For this purpose, Pr and Pi in the baseline (after HCl) condition of each rat were used to obtain predicted values of Pr (Pr') and Pi (Pi') after one hour; these predicted values were then used to predict Pr'' and Pi'' after two hours, with an iteration that was continued until the last image of each series. Derived Pr' * and Pi' * values for the final time point of each experiment were then correlated with the actual measured Pr and Pi for validation: a jack-knifing cross-validation strategy was again used, similar to the first stage.",

[13] Of a total of 13 patients, we chose 9 subjects who underwent inspiratory and expiratory CT within one week after intubation. A PET/CT tomograph (GE Discovery ST, axial field of view 15 cm, 47 sections 3.27 mm thick), equipped with an 8-slice CT, was used. A section of thorax 15 cm long on the longitudinal axis was acquired, selected on the scout view. In all patients the most cranial slice was above the carina and the most caudal slice below the diaphragmatic dome. One 15 cm long field of view in this region includes approximately 73 % of the lung volume. The images used for the current study were spiral CT scans obtained while holding the airway pressure constant at PEEP, at EI (plateau pressure), and at a pressure equivalent to the mean airway pressure recorded during ventilation (CT fusion).",

For the current study, inspiratory and expiratory images were registered, manually segmented by trained operators, and replotted in PRM using the same methodology used for the animal scans. High risk and severely injured voxels were identified and measured using the inspiratory-expiratory density ranges derived from the animal experiments. In addition to PRM analysis, CT density analysis was performed, using methods described in the original publication. [13] Briefly, three dimensional regions of interest (ROI) were segmented on the original CT fusion images and partitioned in air and tissue, allowing quantifying lung weight and gas volumes. Tidal recruitment (the weight of lung that collapses and reopens after each inspiration) was also calculated. [13] Results of this analysis are shown in Table 3 .",

            "text": "Model: We used a multivariate linear regression model to predict the progression of lung injury from the baseline lung CT densities, i.e. based on the percentage of voxels that fell in the high risk (Pr) and in the severe injury (Pi) domains. In the first stage of model building, each pair of Ei and EE images was used individually to correlate Pr and Pi at baseline with the voxel distribution in the following time point. All the rats (n=73) were used in the training/test model, with all the paired time points one hour apart included resulting in a total of 220 sets of images. All pairs of datasets were treated independently of time acquisition, thus no adjustment for longitudinal correlation was performed. This is justified by the fact that the inclusion of time post-injury as an independent predictor did not significantly improve the model (based on Akakie Information Criterion). A linear regression model containing Pr and Pi, their quadratic terms (Pr 2 and Pi 2 ), and the interaction of the two terms (Pr*Pi) with logarithmic transformation was used to predict Pr and Pi in the next time point",

Furthermore, each threedimensional image was separated in three anterior to posterior regions. The warped -original gradients were not different between the aeration compartments and between regions of the lung (P>0.05 by ANOVA for all comparisons).",

The displacement vectors (arrows, see zoomed image in C for detailed visualization) represent the displacement of the pixels (distance traveled in mm), the tail and head of each arrow representing the pixel location respectively at inpiration and expiration during tidal breathing. Caudal lung regions (near the diaphragm) had larger displacement as expected. Low PEEP and higher VT caused larger displacement in the lower lobes (green arrows in D).
