The clinical manifestations of SARS are well documented (2) (3) (4) (5) . However, we do not yet know the spectrum of clinical disease or whether mild or asymptomatic infections attributable to the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) occur. Whether subclinical infections occur and whether one may seroconvert to the SARS-CoV with minimal or no symptoms are concerns for HCWs and others.",

Asymptomatic staff or those without compatible symptoms were also invited to participate in this study. In late March and early April 2003, a blood sample was collected from each HCW who voluntarily participated and who wished to be tested for antibody to SARS-CoV; a second blood sample was collected 4-6 weeks later. Most of the second blood samples were collected in early May 2003, approximately 8 weeks from the first peak and 4 weeks from the second peak of admission of HCWs with SARS ( Figure) . Each HCW completed a questionnaire to document known direct contact with SARS patients, their body fluids, secretions, or excretions; places of duty within the hospital; and symptoms of any illness during the period between first and second blood sample collection. Additional information also included the department and the position of HCWs, so that the job nature could be delineated.",

This finding has important public health implications, as the level of immunity towards SARS-CoV could be very low even in members of communities that had had a large outbreak of SARS.
