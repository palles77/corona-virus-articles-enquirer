The underlying mechanism of acute exacerbations of COPD is acquisition of new strains of bacteria and viruses. A complex host-pathogen interaction then determines the clinical manifestations and outcomes of such acquisition. COPD predisposes to community-acquired pneumonia and alters its cause, treatment, and outcomes. Several lines of evidence now suggest that chronic airway infection by bacteria is prevalent in COPD, and by triggering a chronic inflammatory response contributes to progression of disease. Lung innate immune defenses are impaired in COPD, making these patients more susceptible to infection. Respiratory pathogens prevalent in COPD use various mechanisms to evade host responses and thereby cause acute and persistent infections.",

            "text": "The role of infection in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) was first postulated in 1953 by Stuart-Harris and colleagues 1 in what is now known as the British hypothesis. They speculated that the decline in the lung function in COPD was the result of mucus hypersecretion and recurrent bacterial infections. In the next 2 decades, several studies were performed to confirm the hypothesis. In some of these studies, sputum microbiology was used to compare the rate of bacterial infection in patients with chronic bronchitis at baseline and during exacerbations, as well as in comparison with individuals without COPD. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Some differences in bacterial infection related to disease state were found; for example, Smith and colleagues 2, 3, 8 ",

However, for the most part, differences in the rate of bacterial isolation from sputum at stable state (ie, colonization) versus at acute exacerbation (ie, infection) were not seen in these studies. Advanced molecular biology techniques to differentiate bacterial strains within species had not been developed and were therefore not available to these investigators. Other investigators examined this hypothesis by using serologic studies to determine levels of antibacterial antibodies in patients with chronic bronchitis. These results were also confusing and contradictory and were confounded by the use of laboratory strains as an antigen (discussed in Ref. 9 ). In 1977, Fletcher and colleagues 10 published a landmark study that showed that frequency of exacerbations and mucus hypersecretion did not result in faster decline of lung function in patients with COPD. By the early 1980s, because of these observations and the appreciation of the importance of tobacco smoke in COPD pathogenesis, the British hypothesis was rejected, and bacterial infection was relegated to an epiphenomenon in this disease. 7 The role of viral infection in COPD exacerbations was also extensively investigated in the 1960s and 1970s with viral cultures and serology at exacerbation. 3, 5, 8 Because of the lack of confounding by chronic colonization and serologic cross reactivity, about 30% of exacerbations were confirmed to be of viral origin. Following 20 to -30 years of scant investigation, the role of infection has been revisited in the last 2 decades with new molecular biology, immunology, and microbiology techniques. 11 Understanding of infection in COPD, both in the acute and chronic settings, has consequently developed substantially, as discussed later (Fig. 1 ).",

The differentiation between the two presentations is based on the presence (pneumonia) or absence (exacerbation) of lung parenchymal involvement, which presents as an infiltrate on chest radiology. Although pneumonia has been always considered to be a more significant acute infection, exacerbations occur with much greater frequency and also have serious consequences in COPD. As the British hypothesis was being largely discredited, the importance of exacerbations in COPD was also minimized. They came to be regarded as self-resolving viral illness of little consequence (chest colds) for which no specific therapy was available and that were part of the natural course of the disease. The last 2 decades have seen considerable revision in this point of view, because data have emerged that exacerbations do contribute to the loss of quality of life and lung function in COPD and account for as much as half the cost of care of COPD. Furthermore, bacterial infection contributes to exacerbations, specific therapies are of benefit, and prevention of exacerbations is possible and is an important therapeutic goal in COPD.",

Understanding of viral exacerbations has recently been expanded by the use of molecular diagnostic techniques and with the development of a human experimental model of rhinoviral exacerbations. The most common viruses detected in airway secretions at exacerbation are rhinovirus, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza, and adenovirus. A recent systematic review found that viruses were detected in 34.1% of exacerbations. 12 More recent studies using molecular detection of virus by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques have found viruses in up to half of all exacerbations. 13 The human experimental model of rhinoviral exacerbations was described in a study in which 13 subjects with COPD and 13 control subjects were nasally inoculated with a low dose of rhinovirus. 14 An increased neutrophilic inflammatory response in the lower airway, and more prominent lower respiratory symptoms and airway obstruction, were found in COPD compared with controls. An impaired interferon response to the infection was seen in patients with COPD. This work confirms the viral causation of exacerbations and has provided insights into susceptibility and pathogenic mechanisms involved in viral exacerbations.",

            "text": "Previous studies that defined bacterial pathogens isolated from sputum only at a species level were unable to fully appreciate the dynamic nature of bacterial infection in COPD. In a longitudinal prospective cohort study in patients with COPD, when bacterial strains in sputum were characterized by molecular techniques, combined with a careful analysis of host immune and immunologic responses, an important mechanism that likely underlies exacerbations caused by the 4 major pathogens listed earlier was found (Fig. 2) . 15 The risk of having an exacerbation was increased by more than 2-fold with respiratory tract acquisition of strains of these bacterial pathogens that were new to the patient. In this initial study, 33% of the visits within a month of new strain acquisition were associated with an exacerbation compared with 15.4% without a new strain. 16 Subsequent analyses from this study have now shown that the incidence of exacerbations at a visit with a new strain isolated from sputum is 40% to 50%, and that this holds true for each of the 4 major pathogens (nontypeable H influenzae, S pneumoniae, M catarrhalis, and P aeruginosa). [17] [18] [19] Additional support for this mechanism for exacerbations comes from various observations. Exacerbationassociated strains of H influenzae are more inflammatory in in vitro and animal models than strains associated with colonization, showing that clinical implications of bacterial acquisition correlate with strain virulence. 20 Strain-specific host immune response and a vigorous neutrophilic inflammatory response distinguish new strain exacerbations from those without new strains. 21 Whether an increase in bacterial concentration (load) in the airway of a preexisting (colonizing) strain can be an additional independent mechanism of exacerbations is controversial. When bacterial sputum concentrations from our longitudinal cohort study were analyzed, either no differences or small differences were found between stable disease and exacerbation, and the small differences were no longer seen once new strain acquisition was taken into account. 21 In contrast, Rosell and colleagues 22 showed in pooled analysis of their data from bronchoscopic protected brush specimens that 54% of the patients with COPD exacerbation had pathogenic bacteria present in their airway secretions at significant concentrations compared with 29% of the patients with stable COPD. Intracellular H influenzae was found in bronchial mucosal biopsies in 87% of intubated patients with COPD exacerbation, compared with 33% of the patients with stable COPD. 23 Garcha and colleagues, 24 using quantitative PCR, found higher sputum bacterial loads at exacerbation than at stable state. However, these studies that have shown higher bacterial loads in sputum at exacerbation have not taken into account bacterial strain variation in their specimens. ",

In contrast, in another experimental model, Avadhanula and colleagues 28 found increased bacterial adhesion to respiratory epithelial cells after viral infection. In the human rhinovirus experimental model, degradation of antimicrobial peptides such as elafin by neutrophil elastase could explain the occurrence of secondary bacterial infection. 27 In summary, bacterial and viral infections play a critical role in COPD exacerbations. Application of molecular diagnostic techniques to exacerbations is likely to further enhance understanding of infectious episodes.

The mortality for a PSI of 5 was 35.7%. In 2 European studies, hospitalized patients with CAP with and without COPD were compared. Although mortality differences between the groups were not seen, patients with COPD experienced more severe pneumonia, higher rates of readmission, and recurrent pneumonia. Lower serum tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) and interleukin-6 levels were seen in the COPD group, suggesting an impaired inflammatory response in these patients. 36, 37 Higher mortality with CAP in COPD has been observed in other studies, reiterating the importance of early recognition and appropriate management in this highrisk population. [38] [39] [40] Causes of CAP in COPD S pneumoniae remains the most common cause of CAP in COPD. However, because of alterations in the lung microbiome in COPD, pathogens such as H influenzae, M catarrhalis, and P aeruginosa may play a larger role in the development of CAP in these patients. Moreover, patients with COPD are exposed to frequent antibiotic courses and they are more likely to be infected with antibioticresistant pathogens, making empiric antibiotic choices challenging. 41 In a study of hospitalized patients with COPD with CAP, more infections attributable to P aeruginosa were observed. 42 However, the use of respiratory specimens to determine the microbiological cause of CAP in COPD is challenging, because chronic colonization with CAP-associated pathogens is common in COPD.",

In a pathologic study of small airways of patients with COPD, the extent of formation of lymphoid aggregates predominantly composed of B cells had the best correlation with the degree of airflow obstruction. 63 It is likely that these aggregates represent a local host immune response to chronic microbial infection. Furthermore, this pathologic finding was replicated in a mouse model of chronic inflammation in the lungs induced by repeated instillation of nontypeable H influenzae lysate. 64 Widespread use of high resolution computed tomography scans has revealed that bronchiectasis develops in a substantial proportion of patients with COPD. In a comprehensive study of 92 patients with stable moderate or severe disease, 57.5% had bronchiectasis, and its presence was related to worse lung function, hospital admission in the past year, and chronic bronchitic symptoms. 65 Repeated sputum cultures in these patients linked chronic colonization with potential bacterial pathogens (predominantly nontypeable H influenzae and P aeruginosa) with the presence of bronchiectasis. 65 In summary, these various lines of investigation support the paradigm of a vicious circle of infection and inflammation in COPD. However, COPD is a heterogeneous disease and it is likely that in 30% to 50% of these patients chronic infection plays a prominent role, these being the ones with chronic colonization, bronchiectasis, and/or chronic bronchitis. Future longitudinal natural history studies or studies with interventions that decrease bacterial colonization and measure disease progression are needed to prove the vicious-circle hypothesis.",

SLPI levels decrease significantly at the time of such exacerbations, which return to baseline after resolution. 78 Lysozyme and lactoferrin levels decrease and LL-37 levels increase with both colonization and infective exacerbations with H influenzae and M catarrhalis. 78 In a human model of rhinoviral infection, impaired elafin and SLPI responses following rhinoviral infection were associated with secondary bacterial infection. 27 Macrophage function Key cellular components on innate lung defense are alveolar macrophages and airway epithelial cells. Phagocytic and cytokine responses of alveolar macrophages to bacterial pathogens are crucial for dealing with small pathogen inocula, without invoking potentially damaging inflammatory and adaptive immune responses. Alveolar macrophages from patients with COPD show impaired ability to phagocytose H influenzae and M catarrhalis, but not S pneumoniae or inert microspheres. This impairment is correlated with worsening lung function (Fig. 4) . 91 Alveolar macrophages from patients with COPD also have a less robust cytokine response to bacterial proteins, specifically outer membrane protein P6 and lipo-oligosaccharide (endotoxin) of H influenzae. [92] [93] [94] Following exposure to rhinovirus, alveolar macrophages showed decreased cytokine responses to bacterial lipopolysaccharide and lipoteichoic acid, 95 which could explain the increased susceptibility to bacterial infection after viral infection in COPD.",
