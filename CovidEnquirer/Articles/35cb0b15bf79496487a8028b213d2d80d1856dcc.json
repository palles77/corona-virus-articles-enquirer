            "text": "foot-and-mouth disease viruses were isolated from cells infected with a mixture of temperature-sensitive (fs) mutants belonging to different subtype strains. In order to select for recombination events in many different regions of the genome, crosses were performed between various pairs of mutants, with ts mutations in different regions of the genome. ts+ progeny were analysed by electrofocusing virus-induced proteins and RNase T, fingerprinting of their RNA. All but 5 out of 43 independent isolates, from nine crosses, proved to have recombinant RNA genomes. Maps of these genomes, based on a knowledge of the locations of the unique oligonucleotides, were constructed. Most could be interpreted as being the products of single genetic cross-overs, although three recombinants were formed by two cross-overs each. Cross-overs in at least twelve distinct regions of the genome were identified. This evidence of a large number of recombination sites suggests that RNA recombination in picornaviruses is a general, as opposed to a site-specific, phenomenon.",

            "text": "The ability to exchange genetic information between KIUH molecules by recombination has been demonstrated definitively in only two viruses, poliovirus and foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV or aphthovirus). Recombination was first detected in these picornaviruses by measuring the increase in the number of resistant viruses produced when a mixture of sensitive mutants was grown in the same cell (Hirst, 1962; Ledinko, 1963; Pringle, 1965) . Genetic maps, based on this measure of recombination frequency, were constructed for both viruses (Cooper, 1968; Lake et al., 1975; McCahon et al., 1977) . Only recently, however, has the existence of RNA recombination been confirmed biochemically. Recombination between different subtype strains of FMDV was demonstrated by electrofocusing virus-induced proteins and RNase T, fingerprinting of the genomic RNA (King et al., 1982; Saunders et al.. 1985) . Different types also recombined with each other, though at a lower frequency (McCahon et al., 1985) . In the case of poliovirus, inter-type recombinants have been recovered from a contact of a human subject who had received trivalent live vaccine (Kew and Nottay, 1984) . Recombination has also been shown to occur between poliovirus types 1 and 3 in tissue culture (Ago1 et al., 1984) .",

The genome locations of 37 subtype-specific oligonucleotides (18 0, and 19 0,) have previously been determined from their sequence (Saunders et al., 1985) . At least two oligonucleotide changes appear to have been caused by mutations that arose, not in the parents, but during the isolation of the recombinants themselves. Thus, oligonucleotide O,-21 and its homologue, O,-20, were both missing from Ret 15. This cannot be explained by homologous recombination within this region of the genome, the oligonucleotide sequences being highly conserved (Saunders et al., 1985) . Moreover, the change occurred at a site remote from the only known genetic cross-over in Ret 15. For the same reasons, recombination is an unlikely explanation for the substitution of a new spot in the fingerprint of Ret 12 (arrowed in Fig. 2) in one of the type 7 recombinants probably represents a third example of a mutation, since this oligonucleotide was also located far from the known cross-over region. The other alterations involve oligonucleotides that have not been mapped, and their cause is unknown. Since the oligonucleotides on which this genetic analysis is based represent only about 5% of the total viral genome, the occurrence of three oligonucleotide changes in 43 isolates implies a high frequency of spontaneous base substitutions (of the order of one per genome) among the progeny of these crosses. Most recombination events would be expected to occur within, rather than between, polypeptide-coding regions, and the oligonucleotide maps of Fig. 4 illustrate many examples of recombinant genes. It is remarkable that none of these genes gave rise to a novel recombinant protein; in all cases the gene product exhibited the same isoelectric point (pl) as one or other parent. It is unclear whether the distribution of charged amino acid residues in the parental protein sequences was too conserved for proteins of novel pl to be generated, or whether such hybrid proteins were non-functional.",

The RNA fingerprints verify that this biological assay does primarily detect genetic recombination, rather than some other process, such as complementation. Thus, nearly all (38/43) of the independent ts+ isolates, including many that were originally assumed to be revertants on the basis of their protein patterns (King et al., 1982; Saunders et al., 1985) did indeed possess recombinant genomes. Only in crosses D and E were revertant-like viruses isolated, and it is significant that these were the only crosses in which there was no enhancement in the yield of ts+ progeny over that of the singly infected controls ( Fig. 5 . The regions of the genome in which cross-overs occurred, indicated by dotted lines, are deduced from the protein and RNA compositions summarized in Fig. 4 and results published previously (Saunders et al., 1985) taking account of both the presence and absence of oligonucleotides, and also of any differences between ts parents and wild-type. In contrast to our previous studies, which distinguished only two cross-over regions, Fig. 5 shows that recombination took place in many different regions scattered throughout the genome. Indeed, the only region in which recombination is known not to have occurred is the region coding for VP1 and most of the adjoining VP3 gene. Since VP1 and VP3 are the most poorly conserved picornaviral proteins (Forss et al., 1984; Stanway et al., 1983) it is possible that recombination in this region was prevented by nucleotide sequence heterogeneity, or that recombination did occur but gave rise to non-functional gene products. Fig. 5 also shows the loci, deduced from recombination analysis, of the ts mutants that were used as parents. ts16 is of particular interest since this mutation also confers partial resistance to guanidine (gr), a property often associated with changes in P34 (Saunders and King, 1982) . The fact that the possible locus of ts16 overlaps the 3'-end of the P34 gene supports the conclusion of a previous study (Saunders et al., 1985) that guanidine-resistance mutations are carried by a small carboxy-terminal region of P34. The loci of the other mutants in Fig. 5 are consistent with independent information summarised in Table 1 . One parent, ts304, is missing from Fig. 5 because no single locus is consistent with all the recombination data. A possible explanation is that recombination within P34 suppressed, rather than eliminated, the ts phenotype of ts304 in either Ret 5 or Ret 12; independent evidence suggests that ts304, like ts16, is located in the P34 gene (Table I) .",

The same is also true of Ret 9 and Ret 10. Thus. a minimum of 12 different cross-over sites are needed to explain the variety of compositions observed. The actual number of recombination sites may have been much larger than twelve, since the estimate ignores several variants whose significance is unclear (Table I) , and is based on only a limited number of biochemical markers. It is noticeable that the commonest types of cross-over (e.g. Ret 1, Table 1 ) occurred in the least well-de-fined locations (Fig. 5) suggesting that more detailed analysis of such groups of recombinants would reveal additional cross-overs. The existence of so many cross-over sites tends to favour a general mechanism of RNA recombination, with a virtually infinite number of potential recombination sites, rather than a site-specific mechanism.",

The production of defective interfering (DI) particles exemplifies the latter type of RNA sequence rearrangement, since it requires little or no homology at the site of the cross-over (Jennings et al., 1983) . Sequence rearrangements of DI RNAs are frequently complex (Lehtovaara et al., 1981; O'hara et al., 1984) . and 'mosaic' DI RNAs, involving cross-overs between different genome segments of the same virus (Jennings et al., 1983) or between viral and host RNAs (Monroe and Schlesinger, 1984), have also been described. A viable recombinant might therefore be produced by a non-homologous mechanism if, by chance, the cross-over were to occur between two RNA molecules at an homologous site. However, it seems unlikely that most recombinants are generated in this way, since rearranging sequences at random is an inefficient way of generating equal cross-overs unless the number of potential donor and acceptor sites in the RNA is small; as we have seen, recombination occurs at many sites in the FMDV genome, and it is particularly difficult to explain the high proportion of double cross-overs observed (3 out of 38) on the basis of independent non-homologous events. We therefore conclude that genetic recombination in picornaviruses is primarily an homologous process, that entails, proper alignment of the parental RNA sequences. In this respect, recombination appears to differ from other forms of specific sequence rearrangement in RNA, such as splicing (Cech, 1983) and the synthesis of coronavirus messenger RNAs containing a common leader sequence CBaric et al., 1983) , which have been studied exclusively as intra-molecular events.",

However, some features of Fig. 2 and Fig. 4 require explanation.Two of the ts mutants used as parents, ts 13 and ts 16, carried mutations affecting individual oligonucleotides(Saunders et al., 1985)  which were passed on to their progeny. This explains the absence of spot O,-20 from the fingerprint of Ret 12, and of spot O,-31 from Ret 10 and 11. For the same reason, no significance regarding the location of the genetic cross-overs in Ret 16 and Ret 17 can be attributed to the absence of spot O,-31.",
