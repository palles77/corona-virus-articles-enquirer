After natural infection or experimental oral infection of pregnant sows with a virulent strain of TGE virus, lactogenic immunity is highly protective for piglets, and neutralizing antibodies in milk are mainly associated with the IgA fraction (Bohl, 1981) . In contrast, in sows immunized with cell culture-attenuated TGE strains, lactogenic immunity is poorly protective and neutralizing antibodies in milk are associated with the IgG fraction (Sail and Bohl, 1979) . In a previous investigation (Aynaud et al., 1985) , an attenuated TGE mutant virus, Nouzilly strain (N strain), resistant to acidity and digestive gastric enzymes, was used for oral immunization of seronegative pregnant sows. The post-vaccinal lactogenic immune response gave good protection to suckling piglets against virus challenge. However, the passive protection rate was not related to the level of neutralizing activity in milk and serum of sows after challenge exposure (Shira'/et al., 1988) . In the present investigation, our objective was to analyse the immune response of pregnant sows vaccinated with the N strain of TGE, using an ELISA technique. The levels of IgG, IgM, and IgA were evaluated in serum and milk of sows on the day of, and 10 days after virulent challenge of the piglets.",

This attenuated strain was used for vaccination of pregnant sows against TGE. Virus suspensions were prepared in the same way as the Purdue-ll5 strain. The virulent challenge Gep-II strain of TGE was isolated by P. Vannier (personal gift) from a field outbreak in France. A virulent virus stock (about 106 LDso/ml) was prepared from the contents of the small intestine of colostrum-deprived newborn piglets 24 h post-inoculation with the Gep-II strain. This strain was free of rotavirus antigens, and was filtered (0.22 ttm) before being used for the oral virulent challenge of the newborn piglets.",

Unfortunately, this field virulent strain does not grow in tissue culture, so it is not possible to analyse the neutralizing antibodies against this virus. However, we have analysed the neutralizing activity of many monoclonal (Delmas et al., 1986 ) and polyclonal antibodies against many different strains of the virus (personal data), and we have never found a fundamental difference between the neutralizing activities.

In the present work, using eight other sows, we confirmed the absence of linkage between protection and neutralizing antibody level on the day of challenge. We also demonstrated a statistically significant inverse relationship between the neutralizing antibody titre in milk 10 days after challenge and protection of the litters (Table 3 ). Ten days after challenge, it is clear that an inverse relationship exists between the protection and the titre of all the antibody classes in serum and milk ( Fig. 1 and 2, Table 3 ). This secondary response was modulated by the quantity of virus excreted by the piglets and the immune status of the digestive tract. Absence of, or a low secondary immune response of sows 10 days after challenge could be a good a posteriori marker of lactogenic passive protection.",

The low titres in the sample collected on the day of virulent challenge obliged us to search for a more sensitive technique. We used therefore an appropriate ELISA to allow us to study the antibody class distribution on the day of challenge. The pattern of the IgG, IgA and IgM TGE antibody classes did not show any relationship with protection. With high virulent TGE virus, antibody of the IgA class was the main immunoglobulin involved in the passive protection of the suckling piglets (Bohl and Saif, 1975; Saif and Bohl, 1979; Saif and Bohl, 1981 ) . However, the protection mediated by IgA is also dependent on the oral route of vaccination with virulent virus since intramuscular injection does not elicit IgA synthesis (Abou-Youssef and Ristic, 1975; Kodama et al., 1981; Woods, 1984) . With cell culture-attenuated TGE virus neutralizing antibody, but not IgA antibody, was detectable in the serum of sows which had been either orally or intramuscularly inoculated (Kodama et al., 1980; Woods, 1984) . With the attenuated N strain it seems that IgA antibody activity is not sufficient to explain the protection of the litters. However, purified IgG TGE antibody gives broadly the same passive protection as IgM and IgA to artificiallyfed piglets (Stone et al., 1977) and bovine hyperimmune colostrum whey, rich in IgG1, considerably reduced the mortality of passively-fed piglets following TGE challenge (Stepanek et al., 1982) . It is very difficult to compare an in vitro antibody detection test with the in vivo protection rate due to attendant complex multiparametric physiological phenomena.",
