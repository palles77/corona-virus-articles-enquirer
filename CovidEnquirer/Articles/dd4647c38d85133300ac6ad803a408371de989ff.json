PEDV causes severe diarrhoea and dehydration in nursing piglets, which leads to significant economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. Stress granules (SGs) are sites of mRNA storage that are formed under various stress conditions including viral infections. Increasing evidence suggests that SGs function in antiviral innate immunity of host cells to limit virus replication. Ras-GTPase-activating protein (SH3 domain) binding protein 1 (G3BP1) is a key stress granule-resident protein that nucleates stress granule assembly. Depletion of G3BP1 inhibits SGs formation and overexpression of G3BP1 nucleates SGs assembly. We observed that knockdown of G3BP1 by silencing RNA significantly increased PEDV replication. Overexpression of exogenous G3BP1, on the other hand, lowered virus replication by 100-fold compared to vector control. An increase in the levels of mRNAs of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) was also observed in PEDV-infected G3BP1 depleted cells compared to PEDV-infected control cells. Taken together, our results suggest that G3BP1 plays an antiviral role and impairs PEDV replication.",

Some virus infections cause SGs and the formation of SGs is considered as an indication of an antiviral innate response that limits translation of the viral genes (Onomoto et al., 2014) . Many viruses have evolved strategies to overcome the antiviral effect of SGs by degrading or sequestering its key components such as G3BP1 or TIA-1/TIAR to prevent the formation of SGs (Emara and Brinton, 2007; Humoud et al., 2016; Le Sage et al., 2017; Nelson et al., 2016; White et al., 2007; White and Lloyd, 2011) .

Some viruses have been reported to benefit from SGs formation.

Depending on the individual experiment, we observed that silencing RNA could successfully knockdown the expression of G3BP1 by 50-80% compared to the nontarget control silencing RNA. Accordingly, we observed that G3BP1 knockdown enhanced PEDV replication by 10-100-fold based on the G3BP1 knockdown efficiency. Representative results are shown in Fig. 1A and B, which showed a 50% reduction in G3BP1 expression and a 10-fold increase in virus titer compared to control silencing RNA. A 100-fold increase in virus titer was observed when 80% of G3BP1 knockdown was achieved (data not shown).",

Cleavage of G3BP1 by viral protease or sequestering of G3BP1 by viral proteins inhibits formation of SGs (Le Sage et al., 2017; Nelson et al., 2016; White et al., 2007) . Here we observed that while knockdown of G3BP1 enhanced PEDV replication, overexpression of G3BP1 reduced PEDV replication in Vero cells. Our data suggested an antiviral role of G3BP1 against PEDV. Similar observations were reported for other viruses including mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV) (Choudhury et al., 2017) and sindbis virus (Cristea et al., 2010) . G3BP1 appeared to play no role in porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) replication (Catanzaro and Meng, 2019; Zhou et al., 2017) . A pro-viral role of G3BP1 in hepatitis C Virus (HCV) (Garaigorta et al., 2012) , chikungunya virus (Scholte et al., 2015) , and respiratory syncytial virus shown. An average of 50% knockdown efficiency was achieved. G3BP1 knockdown efficiency was calculated based on the band densities after normalization with protein loading control beta-actin. B: PEDV replication was enhanced in G3BP1 knockdown cells compared to control cells. * indicates p < 0.05. C: The PEDV nucleocapsid (N) gene copies were enhanced in cells with G3BP1 knockdown compared to control cells as determined by real-time RT-PCR. D: The mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were increased in cells with G3BP1 knockdown after PEDV infection as determined by real-time RT-PCR. E: Overexpression of exogenous G3BP reduced PEDV replication. * indicates p < 0.05. The average and standard deviations of three experiments are shown. K. Pandey, et al. Veterinary Microbiology 236 (2019) 108392 (Lindquist et al., 2010) has been reported. Different viruses or even viruses within the same family exhibit unique features in the type of SGs they cause following virus infection, which includes stable, transient, and oscillating SGs (Lindquist et al., 2010; Ruggieri et al., 2012; White et al., 2007) . We observed that PEDV\u2212CO induced SGs as early as 12 h after infection. Approximately 35% PEDV infected Vero-76 cells exhibited two or more SGs at 24 and 48 h of infection. This is in contrast to poliovirus, which causes transient SG formation during the early phase of infection and disperse SGs by cleavage of G3BP1 during later stages of infection (White et al., 2007) . We did not observe any cleavage products of G3BP1 during PEDV infection (data not shown). RSV triggers stable SG formation throughout the viral replication cycle (Lindquist et al., 2010) . Cells infected with Mengovirus or Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), which belong to the Cardiovirus genus within the family of Picornaviridae, do not exhibit SGs because the viral nonstructural protein, leader (L) protein inhibits SGs (Borghese and Michiels, 2011) . Mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV), a member of Coronaviridae, induced SG formation early in infection (Raaben et al., 2007; Sola et al., 2011) . The percentages of SG positive cells increases as PRRSV infection progresses, suggesting that PRRSV induces stable SGs (Catanzaro and Meng, 2019; Zhou et al., 2017) .",

Since virus infections typically induce both ROS and antioxidant response simultaneously (Basu et al., 2017) , it is reasonable to speculate that activation of antioxidant pathway by PEDV may mediate the inhibition of SGs induced by AS treatment.

A previous study has shown that knockdown of SG markers such as G3BP1 increased NF-\u03baB activation and transcription of proinflammatory cytokines induced by PRRSV, which seems to be independent of virus replication (Zhou et al., 2017) . The detailed mechanisms by which G3BP1 knockdown affects virus induced proinflammatory cytokines remain to be determined. One limitation of the study is that we used Vero-76 cells, which are not the natural host cells for PEDV.

The average numbers of SGs positive cells were determined from three to four random pictures taken for each experiment. The experiment was repeated three to four times. * indicates significant difference between non-infected + AS with both PEDV (p = 0.0005) and PEDV + AS groups (p = 0.0016) (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article). K. Pandey, et al. Veterinary Microbiology 236 (2019) 108392 interferes with the formation of SGs induced by AS treatment. Knockdown of G3BP1 significantly enhanced viral replication and transcription of inflammatory cytokines. Similarly, overexpression of exogenous G3BP1 reduced virus replication. Further studies are needed to uncover the detailed mechanisms by which G3BP1 impacts PEDV replication.",
