            "text": "Early recognition of bioterrorism agents can be difficult since the early prodromal phase of most agents is similar and often indistinguishable from other causes of febrile respiratory illnesses. Febrile respiratory illnesses and respiratory failure can signify a natural outbreak (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome, plague, tularemia, or a novel strain of influenza) or a bioterrorism event. 1, 2 Most cases of febrile respiratory illnesses admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) are caused by community-acquired pneumonia, and respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) subsequently develop in up to 11% of these community-acquired pneumonia cases. 3, 4 Although most cases of community-acquired pneumonia are recognizable, the rare and contagious causes (e.g., plague) can have a large impact on the health care and public health systems. 2, 5 Thus, early recognition of these infections becomes important for two reasons. First, early infection control and public health preparedness strategies must be implemented to reduce spread to health care workers and the public, particularly in the acute stages of disease when patients are most contagious and most likely to undergo aerosolgenerating diagnostic procedures. Second, intentional release of these agents is a bioterrorism event, and public health and law enforcement authorities are now trained to provide immediate investigation and support. Therefore, early suspicion of a bioterrorism or outbreak event, along with early protective measures and public health contact, will reduce the likelihood of transmission to health care workers, visitors, patients, and the community.",

For example, in the 14th century, the Tartars catapulted plague-infected corpses into Kaffa, leading to disease spread and defeat of the city (also starting the second wave of the Black Death in Europe). 9 In the New World, smallpox-contaminated blankets may have been distributed by early settlers to natives in an effort to overcome the siege of Fort Pitt. However, bioterrorism took form in the last 100 years with extensive biowarfare units in World War I and II. 7, 8 Notably, Unit 731 of the Japanese army in World War II used anthrax, plague, cholera, and typhoid on Chinese prisoners with high mortality, but the transition to the battlefield was less successful. [7] [8] [9] The Cold War saw both the United States and the former Soviet Union develop bioweapon stockpiles that have since been dismantled. However, over the past 25 years, there has been an increase in individual-initiated bioterrorism, culminating in the anthrax outbreak in 2001 that used the postal service for distribution, causing 22 cases. 7, 8, 10 ",

            "text": "The route of transmission of bioterrorism agents can be by air (e.g., aerosol generation), food (e.g., botulism), or water (e.g., gastroenteritis agents). Delivery can mimic naturally occurring disease, especially if the food or water supply to the public has been targeted. However, with aerosol generation, rapid increases in new cases are seen in low-risk populations, as seen with the anthrax cases in 2001. 11 Because most bioterrorism agents are infectious diseases, presentation of disease is usually covert, with health care workers seeing the initial cases. Particularly with contagious diseases such as plague pneumonia, smallpox, and viral hemorrhagic fevers, secondary infections may propagate the event, allowing it to last weeks to months, stressing the capacity of the health care system. 2, 7 Chemical and explosive forms of terrorism, however, are often overt and immediately known, with first responders in the field evaluating the initial cases and subsequent cases rarely following the initial event. Therefore, epidemiologic evidence (e.g., an increase in pneumonia or a specific rash) may be the initial clue that there has been a bioterrorism event. 12 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has separated bioterrorism agents into three broad categories (A, B, and C) based on ease of spread and severity of illness. 7, 8, 13, 14 Category A agents are considered the highest risk to the public and national security for the following reasons: (1) easy person-to-person spread; (2) high mortality; (3) major public health impact causing panic and social disruption; (4) requirement for specific and specialized public health emergency response (e.g., public prophylaxis or protective equipment) 7, 8, 13, 14 (Table 40-1) .Category B agents are moderately easy to spread and result in moderate morbidity but low mortality in those affected. Fewer specific public health responses are required (Table 40-2) . 7 Category C agents are considered future or potential threats because they are easily available and can have a high mortality, but they have not been documented or engineered successfully (Table 40-3) . 14 Although all of these agents can potentially cause serious disease, the category A agents, along with select category B agents, would be seen by clinicians and have the greatest impact on the public and health care system. These agents present initially with a nonspecific prodromal phase but with epidemiologic clues that may separate them from other less threatening causes of a febrile respiratory illness. Tables 40-4 to 40-8 list the unique features associated with category A agents: clinical syndromes, preferred diagnostic methods, radiologic features, treatment, and infection control and respiratory protection.

Compared with patients who presented with community-acquired pneumonia in a retrospective study, patients with inhalational anthrax were more likely to have nausea or vomiting, tachycardia, elevated transaminases, hyponatremia, and normal white blood cell counts. 18 From these observations, a scoring system was devised that had approximately 80% sensitivity and 80% specificity for distinguishing inhalation anthrax cases. 18 Diagnosis of anthrax is best performed by isolation of B. anthracis from cultures of blood, sputum, pleural fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, or skin 16, 19 (see Table 40 -5). Clinicians should notify the laboratory of suspected anthrax, because spores can form during culture, leading to spread to laboratory workers if not properly handled. Additionally, any suspect case of anthrax should involve the public health laboratories for confirmation and strain typing. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and rapid enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) are available and have good sensitivity and specificity. 16, 19 The radiographic imaging findings associated with anthrax include a widened mediastinum consistent with hemorrhagic mediastinitis, the hallmark of inhalation anthrax 15, 16 (see Fig. 40 -2) (see Table 40 -6). However, during the 2001 outbreak, other findings, including patchy alveolar opacities, lobar consolidation, and pleural effusions, were also reported. 16 In each of these cases, a widened mediastinum was present on chest radiograph, with follow-up confirmation performed by computed tomography scan.",

Corticosteroids are widely used to reduce edema and hemorrhage, especially when cutaneous anthrax affects the head and neck, threatening airway integrity, but there are very limited data on their efficacy. 17 Raxibacumab, a human IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against B. anthracis protective antigen (whose role is to bind host cells and deliver anthrax edema factor and lethal factor to the host cell cytoplasm), has been effective for the treatment of anthrax in animal models, with cases seen in the Middle East. Most cases in the United States arise through the handling of animal products, such as the 2006 cases associated with animal hide drum skins imported from Africa. 16 Disease begins when B. anthracis spores are introduced subcutaneously or via ingestion or inhalation. After introduction to oxygen and a protein-rich environment, the spores convert to the vegetative (bacillus) form and initiate replication. 15, 16 Exotoxin secretion leads to local spread, edema, hemorrhage, and tissue necrosis. The anthrax capsule, edema factor toxin, and lethal factor toxin act in concert to drive disease. 15, 16 ",

Infected fleas bite their rodent hosts, inoculating the rodent. Mortality in these animals is lower than in nonrodent mammals, and disease is passed from infected rodent to flea and the life cycle continues. Y. pestis is transmitted to humans by bites from rodent-infected fleas, scratches or bites from infected animals, exposure to infected humans, or bioterrorism. 33, 34 Bites by infected fleas are the most common mode of transmission; squirrels, rabbits, domestic and wild cats, and prairie dogs are the most common sources of infected fleas. Large rodent or other animal die-offs, particularly in more susceptible species, may herald a large epidemic in nature. 33, 34 Plague is found worldwide; in the United States endemic disease is concentrated in the western states; most likely because of introduction of Y. pestis-infected rats through the ports of San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Seattle in the late 19th century. 35 ",

Seven serotypes of botulinum toxin exist, A through G, and are produced by different strains of C. botulinum. All botulinum neurotoxins act as proteases that cleave proteins on synaptic vesicles or the presynaptic plasma membrane of the neuromuscular junction and cholinergic autonomic synapses. The resulting inability to release neurotransmitters and disruption of neurotransmission account for the clinical findings. Serotypes A, B, and E predominate in human disease, although any serotype can cause disease. 48, 49 Serotypes C and D are predominately found in animal populations. Botulinum toxin is extremely potent, with the median lethal oral dose estimated to be 1 ng/kg, although the lethal dose may be two to three times higher if exposure is by inhalation. 48, 49 Disease presents from four potential sources: food-borne, wound, infant, and intentional. 48, 49 Food-borne disease presents in outbreaks and is often associated with homecanned foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and fermented fish. Wound botulism has been associated with intravenous and subcutaneous injection of black tar heroin, mostly of Mexican origin. Infant botulism is seen sporadically in some western states, likely from spore acquisition from soil or raw honey, with toxin production in the gastrointestinal tract. Finally, intentional release during a bioterrorism event may lead to oral ingestion or inhalation of the toxin.",

People have become infected after handling primate products, after consuming nonhuman primate meat, or after exposure to symptomatic patients, including in hospitals. Several cases have presented due to exposure in laboratories. The use of hemorrhagic fever viruses as bioterrorism agents has also been postulated, largely based on their high contagiousness in aerosolized primate models. 55, 56 The animal reservoir for these viruses was initially thought to be wild primates, but has recently been tentatively identified to be bats, which transmit the infection to nonhuman primates in the wild.",

Botulinum antitoxin cannot reverse botulinum intoxication 48, 49, 52 (see Table  40 -7). While the antitoxin is widely used in cases of botulism, its efficacy has only been inferred and, since the available antitoxin is derived from immunized horses, anaphylaxis and/or serum sickness can develop in 9% to 20% of recipients. A human-derived antitoxin is available but only for infant botulism. Human monoclonal antibodies have been prepared that neutralize multiple types of botulinum toxins, and these provide the potential for use in adults with a lower risk of adverse effects than the equine antiserum. 53 In wound botulism, after wound drainage, antibiotic administration is useful; penicillin or clindamycin are the drugs of choice. 48, 49 In food-borne and inhalation botulism, because the disease results from exposure to the toxin and not from infection, antibiotics are not efficacious. In all cases of botulism, routine monitoring of forced vital capacity is recommended, with early intubation if the vital capacity falls below 10 mL/kg (approximately 30% predicted). There is no direct prophylaxis for exposure, but in the setting of high-risk threats, a vaccine directed against serotypes A and E is available and has been largely used in the military. 52 Patients die of botulism due to respiratory failure without ventilatory support or from complications during critical care.",

Initially fevers persist irregularly over weeks to months, followed by arthralgias, gastrointestinal symptoms, and possibly endocarditis. 71 Diagnosis is suspected with a plausible history of exposure, with isolation of the organism by blood culture. However, growth is slow, so all cultures should be kept for 4 weeks if the diagnosis is suspected. Treatment is with doxycycline for up to 6 weeks, for children, treatment is with trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole for children. 71",

Symptoms begin within 4 to 12 hours after exposure. Systemic effects of ricin poisoning depend on route of exposure and exposure dosage.

Influenza-like symptoms (fever, myalgia, and arthralgia) may be seen, as can hypotension, respiratory failure, and multiorgan failure. 70 Few symptoms and signs exist to separate ricin intoxication from other causes of respiratory failure, although excessive diaphoresis has been reported and would be unusual in other causes.

If an etiologic agent is identified on initial screening and clinical findings (i.e., gram-positive diplococci with a lobar pneumonia on radiograph), targeted treatment should be initiated, with appropriate isolation precautions based on the pathogen. However, if an agent is not easily identified, patients should be placed in isolation and further diagnostic testing should be performed. If multiple cases with similar symptoms or a case with an uncommon epidemiologic link is determined, patients should be isolated and public health officials should be contacted. If specific clinical features subsequently arise, then directed diagnostic testing should be performed.

The administration of antivirals, particularly oseltamivir, reduced hospitalizations and death when administered within 48 hours of symptom onset. [79] [80] [81] [82] In critically ill patients with pandemic H1N1 influenza, oseltamivir was associated with increased survival compared with no treatment (75% versus 58%) with a median time of treatment initiation 4 days from symptom onset. 79 However, treatment initiated within 5 days after symptom onset was still associated with increased survival compared with no therapy. 80, 81 Similar findings were seen in children and other at-risk individuals, including immunocompromised and pregnant women. 82 Therefore the importance of early distribution and administration of therapy, including the rapid dissemination of therapy guidelines for practitioners, must be a cornerstone of any bioterrorism response.",

            "text": "The recognition of a case of a disease related to a bioterrorism event relies on a high index of suspicion by the clinician. However, recognition may be difficult in the early stages of disease, in that many of the category A agents casualties with an immediate critical area response. In contrast, because some of the category A agents are spread by contact and respiratory transmission, new cases will be seen after the initial outbreak. As these cases progress, the cumulative number of cases with severe respiratory illness will increase, potentially stressing the critical care system and leading to a sustained need for emergency mass critical care (EMCC) for weeks to months. Sustained EMCC can lead to depletion of critical care resources, such as mechanical ventilators, specially trained staff, antibiotics and antivirals, and ICU beds. 5 Thus, the unique issues associated with sustained EMCC have led to improved planning for a response to a bioterrorism or emerging infectious diseases outbreak. 89, 90 Recent consensus statements have recommended special critical care preparedness to include ICU capacity expansion, critical care resource storage, and the coordination of critical care across communities to a regional and statewide level. 89, 90 Capacity for critical care should be approximately three times normal ICU capacity, with all critically ill patients to be located in acute care hospitals (less severely ill patients will be diverted to alternative sites within the community). Each hospital should have enough supplies for 10 days for each critically ill patient along with plans to have expanded care by noncritical care specialists in the case of a shortage. 91 ICU admission should be limited to the most severely ill. Most importantly, establishment of a triage mechanism is required for the allocation of scarce resources in sustained EMCC, with the most identified critical resource being mechanical ventilation and medical oxygen. 92 This triage mechanism shifts the focus of critical care from optimal care of the individual to optimal care for the population and would identify critically ill patients who may not get specific scarce resources during a period of limited supply in an outbreak. It would include inclusion and exclusion criteria for ICU admission along with a triage scoring mechanism for patient assessment. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score is valuable, due to its value in sequential assessments and its ease of use given its lower reliance on laboratory data. Additional triage scoring systems may be warranted in future outbreaks as disease and outbreak conditions change.",
