True to its name and as an acid-extracted organic matrix from human bone sources, DBM retains much of the proteinaceous components native to bone, with small amounts of calcium-based solids, inorganic phosphates and some trace cell debris. Many of DBM's proteinaceous components (e.g., growth factors) are known to be potent osteogenic agents. Commercially sourced as putty, paste, sheets and flexible pieces, DBM provides a degradable matrix facilitating endogenous release of these compounds to the bone wound sites where it is surgically placed to fill bone defects, inducing new bone formation and accelerating healing. Given DBM's long clinical track record and commercial accessibility in standard forms and sources, opportunities to further develop and validate DBM as a versatile bone biomaterial in orthopedic repair and regenerative medicine contexts are attractive.",

Differences in preparation and processing methods for bone can impact properties and clinical performance. Biological testing of processed bone and the outcome measures to validate biological activity (i.e., the so-called osteoinductive index, OI, described herein) are not uniform among tissue banks, and as a result DBM products have variable composition and properties. This variability has obvious significance for clinicians and patients, but also issues for understanding performance in research studies. In addition, DBM products consist of bone-derived particle sizes and particle size ranges, even protein fibers. DBM sterilization protocols are also variable. Finally, the composition of various carriers combined with the DBM, and DBM combined with various bioactive substances will influence clinical and research outcomes. Best practices and consensus for use are difficult to ascertain from the literature. The diverse types of DBM products as well as commercial claims regarding the performance of those products leads to many questions about clinical effectiveness, future opportunities and understanding how it is best used. Given DBM's substantial history that weaves biology together and clinical applications, an initial review of its history, contemporary and factual clinical basis for DBM properties and clinical utility in bone repair is useful to understand current usage trends and future opportunities. Importantly, in this context, DBM was the original source for discovery of several key growth factors that were subsequently cloned and recombinantly expressed to become FDA-approved clinical therapeutic proteins BMP-2 and BMP-7 in bone repair (rhBMP-7 is no longer FDA-approved but has a highly restrictive human device exemption label).",

            "text": "Early publications by Harakas [6] and Glowacki and Mulliken [7] provide key historical information for first identifying and recognizing important pioneering work on DBM. Context for DBM use was prompted by clinical recognition of the value of bone grafting that alone has substantial history. A 1632 report regarding a Russian soldier successfully treated with dog bone graft (the first reported bone xenograft) elicited vociferous condemnation from the Christian church [8] . The treating surgeon, Meek'ren, fearing excommunication, removed the xenograft. Autografting was also reported by Macewen in 1881 [9] who speculated that transplanted osteoblasts carried in the autograft were responsible for success. Senn in 1889 used decalcified bone to treat osseous defects [10] . He soaked tibiae from oxen in hydrochloric acid (HCl), using logic that HCl had antiseptic effects on the xenograft and would benefit patients with osteomyelitis. Deaver [11] , Curtis [12] and Mackie [13] validated Senn's work. During World War I (1914) (1915) (1916) (1917) , combat-incurred injuries requiring bone grafting prompted resurgence in autografting. Notable clinician-scientists Phemister [14] and Groves [15] systematically studied autografting using pre-clinical models. Phemister underscored the need for 'mechanical stress' for successful structural bone grafting. While the concept of load may not have been specifically stated, the implications were that limb function following grafting is an important, positive bone-promoting stimulus. Phemister then introduced the 'creeping substitution' concept where host bone grows into bulk allograft. Barth (1893) [16] and Axhausen [17] previously described a process where host bone grows into other grafted bone. Contemporary nomenclature for 'creeping substitution' is 'osteoconduction', the term coined by Urist (reviewed in [18] ). Groves emphasized the importance of 'secure fixation' of the graft to the recipient bed as well as noting viable bone produced better outcome than non-viable bone [15] .",

Furthermore, time on the operating room table, infection risk and increased patient care costs were concerns that persist today as contemporary challenges. Noteworthy, the overall risk of infection from hospital internment remains substantial. Consequently, 20th century clinicians sought alternatives to autografting that minimize hospital exposure-a lingering quest remaining for 21st century clinicians as well.",

            "text": "An initial alternative to autografting was offered by Huggins [19, 20] . He described a propitious finding where transitional epithelium from the urogenital system promoted ectopic osteogenesis: the formation of bone in a connective tissue site. These reports were similar to Neuhof's observation [21] , where fascia used to augment bladder in dogs elicited an ectopic osteogenic outcome. Interestingly, in 1998 Urist and colleagues reported detection of messenger RNA for bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) 2, 4 and 5 in bladder tissue, producing an important causal connection [22] . Important to DBM development, these reports on 'ectopic osteogenesis' were followed by two provocative papers in 1934 and 1938 describing the response in muscle to alcohol extracts prepared from bone [23, 24] . The alcohol extracts injected into skeletal muscle produced osteogenesis. These studies were phenomenological, and it was not until 1945 and 1947 that a biological explanation was offered by Lacroix [25, 26] who thought that bone contained 'substances' that enabled osteogenesis. His 1947 paper in Nature stated that 'osteogenin', speculated to be in bone, initiated its growth [26] . Ray and Holloway [27] and then Urist in his landmark paper in Science [28] determined ectopic osteogenesis occurred when demineralized bone was implanted into a non-bony site. This elegantly detailed scientific explanation of ectopic osteogenesis coined the term 'autoinduction'. Urist posited that the substratum (the non-mineralized matrix of bone) was key, providing morphogenetic signals that prompted osteogenesis. It is highly noteworthy that in 1971, Urist and Strates introduced 'bone morphogenetic protein' (BMP) and 'osteoinduction' to the scientific and clinical communities [29] . Urist systematically and lucidly presented a visionary process-still highly relevant today-of bone morphogenesis promoted by the demineralized component of bone: the organic substratum (as Urist called it) [30] .",

In 1976, Reddi and Anderson [33] refined and polished Urist's work on 'induced osteogenesis' and then provided the first credible and compelling explanation of the functional role of purified organic bone matrices (i.e., the bone's demineralized matrix) [34] . Sampath and Reddi stated 'the functional collaboration between the soluble extract and insoluble collagenous substratum' (i.e., the demineralized matrix) were necessary for 'optimal osteogenic activity'. Reddi and his loyal colleagues identified factors in the 'soluble extract' crucial to ectopic ossification. Respecting the hallmark work of Lacroix along these lines, Reddi called one of these factors osteogenin [35] , later also identified as BMP-3. Reddi's comprehensive and pioneering work on DBM enabled the cloning and expressing of recombinant human BMPs. Reddi acknowledged in 2000 [36] , the 'incisive work of Wozney and colleagues [37] who cloned bone morphogenetic proteins 2 and 4. This accomplishment was followed in 1990 by \u00d6zkaynak and co-workers who cloned BMPs 7 and 8 (also called osteogenic proteins 1 and 2, or OP-1, and -2, respectively) [38] . These BMP molecules are part of the 'soluble extract' Reddi first identified in his original demineralized bone matrix (DBM) (reviewed in [36] ).",

This demineralized component was proven to contain the biological drivers essential for osteogenesis. This history provides a conceptual foundation to develop several issues germane to the biological activity of DBM and its clinical utility, including procurement, donor profile (e.g., gender, age), processing, production issues, sterilization, and its combinations with carrier biomaterials.",

The procurement process is highly regulated by the FDA and specific requirements are found in Title 21 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR 21) Part 1270. Compliance with these tissue processing guidelines requires the cooperation of independent organizations, including hospital-based medical staff, recovery and screening organizations, tissue processing facilities and sales and distribution organizations. The starting point is an assessment of the suitability of a donor conducted by a recovery or screening organization based on general criteria followed by an initial medical screening. The family of the deceased donor is consulted to obtain an informed consent for tissue donation. If the triage and consent steps are successful, the tissue processing facility is contacted and takes responsibility for final screening.",

FDA mandates that a detailed medical and social history is obtained to uncover social and behavioral risk factors (see Supplementary Table 1 ). The information is obtained through interviews with family and other close contacts of the donors. In some instances identification of a behavioral risk factor disqualifies a donor and in other cases it triggers further investigation. The next assessment is a physical examination that may reveal evidence of risk factors or signs of pathologies not otherwise detected through serological testing and could lead to donor exclusion (Supplementary Table 2 ). Finally, a series of clinical tests are completed to rule out Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) types 1 and 2, Hepatitis B virus (HBV), Hepatitis C virus (HCV), and treponema pallidum (syphilis).

In general, the DBM preparation protocol includes donor bone debridement of adherent soft tissues and removal of blood and lipids. At this point, often an antibiotic soak is used to initiate the sterilization process. Subsequently, cleansed donor bone is morsellized to defined particles or fibers and subjected to acid demineralization followed by one or more rounds of freeze-drying. The mineral phase is extracted from the particulate whole donor bone with 0.5-0.6 N HCl, leaving the organic matrix intact. Upon freeze-drying, the resulting demineralized bone powder (synonymous with DBM) can be formulated into putties, pastes and more recently, flexible, pre-formed strips for implant use. The freeze-drying as one step in the processing has led to the alternative DBM term: Demineralized Freeze-Dried Bone Allograft (DFDBA).",

Different surface geometries may impact host cellular interactions as well as diffusion rates of DBM-resident biological molecules and endogenous agents such as BMPs or growth factors in and out of DBM. Consequently, some discussion regarding the optimal size and size range of particle for DBM preparations suggests that particles less than 250 \u03bcm are not as osteoinductive as larger-sized (420-840 \u03bcm) particles [5, 41, 42] . Generally, preclinical data are inconsistent regarding DBM compositions as particles and their size ranges, as well as for fibers, and DBM formulations in sheets and gels. Inconsistency is due to different animal models and outcome measures, many of which are highly subjective and are unique to one laboratory and not universally accepted. Moreover, human data on DBM are weak due in part to the emphasis on DBM as a bone graft extender rather than as a stand-alone therapy. Consequently, the efficacy for different formulations for DBM has not been clearly elucidated. Formulation design features are largely empirically ascertained in arbitrary test beds.",

Conversion of DBM powder to putty involves formulation with a biocompatible viscous carrier that provides a stable suspension of DBM powder particles. The viscous carriers can be classified as water-soluble polymers such as sodium hyaluronate or carboxymethylcellulose, or anhydrous water-miscible solvents such as glycerol. In some cases, the carrier selection has implications for other processing steps, compatibilities, applications, and even sterilization. Further, DBM can be mixed with these carriers to produce flexible sheets that may contain both DBM and cortical bone chips as a composite biomaterial. Additionally, the polymer carrier Pluronic (BASF product, synonymous with poloxamer), is a temperature-sensitive biomedical copolymer carrier used with DBM. The composition becomes firmer as it warms to body temperature. Another carrier is a thermoplastic, porcine collagen-based hydrogel that is non-water-soluble. The DBM-porcine collagen can be extruded through a syringe after it is heated to 46-50\u00b0C. In situ at body temperature the composition becomes firm.",

Sassard and colleagues reported on a retrospective review of patients who had undergone instrumented posterolateral lumbar spinal fusion with an autogenous bone graft and Grafton gel [46] . Age-, gender-, and procedure-matched group of patients were involved. There were no differences between treatment groups (autograft vs autograft plus Grafton) based on radiographs up to 24months after surgery. The fusion rates in the autograft with Grafton group and the autograft-only groups were only 60% and 56%, respectively. The most important predictor of 24-month bone mineralization was a correlation between the type of instrumentation and fusion success. Bostrom and co-workers implanted Grafton subcutaneously into athymic rats and reported acute tubular necrosis [47] . It was speculated the glycerol component in Grafton led to the nephrotxoicity. However, the dose was 10 times the human clinical dose. Nevertheless, glycerol-containing products should be used with caution in pediatric patients and in those at risk of renal disease [48] .",

Moreover, individual 'DBM lots' processed by the same tissue bank may possess different osteoinductive capacities, and these capacities may vary among different donors. While biological activity is measured by osteoinduction and is reported as the osteoinductive index, OI, no DBM \"potency\" or \"compositional\" regulatory standards are enacted across DBM products to understand or control these differences. It is also noteworthy to emphasize the significance of shelf life and carrier stability for DBM composite products. If precise control of conditions is not maintained, then endogenous osteogenic proteins in the DBM, most importantly, BMPs, might be susceptible to chemical and physical degradation [50] . Variations in the shelf life of a specific carrier may or may not affect the overall activity of the product.

When DBM is combined with a 'synthetic carrier', it becomes a device. With all implants, there is a finite increased risk of infection with DBM implantation. Medical devices must be provided to the surgeon in a certified sterile condition. The FDA regulates the sterility requirements for devices and the most recent guidance document for sterility of 510(K) medical devices such as DBM was provided in August 2002 (Updated 510(K) Sterility Review Guidance K90-1; Guidance for Industry and FDA). The degree of sterility must be quantified to provide an achievable benchmark or set point for industry. Currently the sterility assurance level (SAL) required for DBM and all other implants is set at SAL 10 \u22126 . This SAL nomenclature signifies that no more than one unit out of one million devices sterilized would fail sterility testing. Implant sterilization methods are categorized by the FDA as either \"Traditional\" or Non-Traditional\" methods. Traditional methods include dry heat sterilization, moist heat sterilization, ethylene oxide (ETO) in a fixed ETO chamber, gamma and electron beam radiation and liquid chemical sterilants. Non-traditional methods are defined as ETO not using fixed chambers, high intensity light, chlorine dioxide, ultraviolet light, combined vapor and gas plasma, vapor systems (peroxide or peracetic acid) and filtration. Manufacturers of DBM can use either category provided that the SAL 10 \u22126 threshold is met. Table 1 lists methods applied to specific products.",

Munting and co-workers prepared rat DBM preparation and sterilized it using different protocols: gamma irradiation, merthiolate, glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde and ethylene oxide (ETO) [55] . Glutaraldehyde, formaldehyde and ETO abolished OI while merthiolate and gamma radiation were less damaging to the OI. Other reports document the impact of sterilizing BMPs derived from DBM [56, 57] .

In another study the humidity during the ETO exposure process modulated the effects of ETO on OI [72] . As a reactive gas, ETO penetrates and sorbs into soft, porous biomaterials like DBM so that de-gassing of ETO commonly used for porous implants might be poorly controlled in these comparative studies and remains partially unaddressed.

Sterility is achieved by aseptic processing through a combination of manufacturing controls and standard operating procedures. The FDA provided a guidance document in September 2004 entitled \"Guidance for Industry, Sterile Drug Products Produced by Aseptic Processing-Current Good Manufacturing Practice to help manufacturers achieve sterility through aseptic processing. The document provides information on the engineering and human controls that can be used to ensure sterility. Compliance with the guidelines to ensure a sterile product depends on adequate manufacturing spaces called \"clean rooms\" with sufficient air quality controls. Clean rooms must have High-Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filtration and allow entry and exit of staff and materials without the introduction of infectious agents. Chemical and physical conditions typical of other sterilization methods that could degrade or alter biologically derived substances are avoided in the aseptic processing of DBM. Several DBM manufacturers have endorsed the cost effectiveness of aseptic processing in preserving the DBM OI.",

Processing can include sterilization protocols versus aseptic procurement, as well as the quantity and OI potency per unit volume of DBM found within the carrier. Consequently, since processing and sterilization methods may change over time, it is useful to collect contemporary comparative data in standardized models, especially in light of the recent 510(K) clearance requirements that mandate controlled and validated manufacturing processes.

However, their report used DBM from a cohort of only eight donors ranging in age from 18 to 72. Consequently, the study may have been insufficiently powered. Aaboe and colleagues found that ectopic bone formation by DBM from differently aged rats seemed to indicate a modest age-related increase in osteoinductivity from younger vs. older rat donors [3] . Moreover, an evaluation of human DBM preparations from age and sex stratified donors indicated a correlation between donor age and the amount extractable BMP-2 suggesting with an increase in age there was a decrease in BMP content (reviewed in [83] ). A similar profile was observed for BMP-4 [84] . In contrast to these reports, no significant correlation was suggested between donor age and BMP-2, -4 and -7 [83] . Given that BMP-2 levels are in the nanogram per gram level in cortical bone, it is unclear that age related effects of either BMP-2 or TGF-are clinically meaningful [83] .",

The simple rationale for the corporate sector is that in vitro assays are quicker and less expensive than in vivo assays!

While loading is critical to stimulate new bone, DBM implantation is performed in the absence of controlled mechanical loading. After approximately 28days, the rodent is euthanized and the explanted muscle mass is radiographed and tissues are processed for histological assessment. The radiograph is examined for radiopacity. The histological tissue assessment includes a subjective grading of bone formation among a number of random histological sections at a certain magnification using a stain of choice for the laboratory (e.g., Goldner trichrome). An arbitrary 'value' (i.e., some numerical 'grade') is given by the examiner to the histology slide based on the bone observed without any clear standard or endpoint for bone architecture defined for the field. Because of this, there may be little relevance for numerical scores among different bone banking laboratories and sometimes there are differences in 'scores' within the same laboratory. Therefore, a standardized procedure needs to be adopted for bone banks for 'grading' biological (e.g., osteoinductive) outcome from the DBM in vivo assay.

Contemporary demineralized products are designed as bone fillers for bone defects that have 'walls', that is, the defect is bounded by existing, intact bone. Craniofacial applications are challenging, requiring structural support and protection of the dura as essential elements of a successful bone substitute material. In the early 1980s, Mulliken et al. [103] reported on demineralized bone powder for cranial reconstruction. Since then, several groups have used demineralized bone preparations for cranial reconstruction and in the reconstruction of nasomaxillary cleft defects [104, 105] . Ousterhout placed demineralized implants in facial defects and LeFort I osteotomies [106] . He found that demineralized products to augment facial contours resulted in considerable resorption, while demineralized bone in defects generally resulted in satisfactory osteogenesis.",

Weinraub and Cheung used allogeneic bone either with or without demineralized bone in several procedures including arthrodesis, segmental lengthening, and treatment of nonunion.

Tiedman and his group used demineralized bone, alone, and as a composite graft with autogenous bone marrow in orthopaedic applications [113] . They concluded that DBM and marrow composite grafting is a suitable alternative to autogenous iliac crest bone graft for clinical situations such as bone defects in children, comminuted fractures with associated bone loss, non-united fractures, or for augmentation of arthodesis [113] . In one of the few prospective studies using demineralized bone products in orthopaedics, Geesink et al. [114] compared Osteogenic Protein-1 (OP-1: Stryker Biomedical, Inc.; also known as rhBMP-7) to Grafton Gel in fibular defects. At early time points, OP-1 had superior union, however, at 12months, there was no difference in bone mineral density scores between OP-1 and DBM Grafton Gel. Although controversial, controlled studies and anecdotal reports suggest that bone graft substitutes, including demineralized bone matrix, may result in improved treatment outcomes for patients with fractures of the distal radius [115] .",

First, using demineralized bone in conjunction with autogenous bone demonstrates a synergistic osteogenic response. Second, demineralized bone products in bone defects provide qualitative and quantitative bone healing results depending on the volumetric characteristics of the defects. Osseous defects with only two walls (e.g., segmental or continuity defects) would be expected to have less predictable osteogenesis than defects with only one wall. Third, demineralized bone products are not advised for augmenting facial and cranial contour deficits due to the tendency for resorption. Fourth, considerable variability in tissue banking processing of demineralized products, as well as lot-to-lot variability in composition and OI are confusing and concerning still to DBM use. Though DBM can be successful if used alongside allograft bone, its use alone in applications undergoing high compressive loads is contraindicated, leading to greater graft collapse in the inherent absence of structural rigidity.",

However, as its clinical appeal expanded, innovative DBM formulations with carriers were designed and developed to increase clinical utility. Consequently, with this manipulation for clinical use, the FDA now regulates DBM as a 510(k) medical device. Therefore, DBM products must satisfy regulatory guidelines to ensure biocompatibility, manufacturing validation, shelf life and osteoinductive potential.
