We first describe a novel method, SiteEngine, that assumes no sequence or fold similarities and is able to recognize proteins that have similar binding sites and may perform similar functions. We achieve high efficiency and speed by introducing a low-resolution surface representation via chemically important surface points, by hashing triangles of physico-chemical properties and by application of hierarchical scoring schemes for a thorough exploration of global and local similarities. We proceed to rigorously apply this method to functional site recognition in three possible ways: first, we search a given functional site on a large set of complete protein structures. Second, a potential functional site on a protein of interest is compared with known binding sites, to recognize similar features. Third, a complete protein structure is searched for the presence of an a priori unknown functional site, similar to known sites. Our method is robust and efficient enough to allow computationally demanding applications such as the first and the third. From the biological standpoint, the first application may identify secondary binding sites of drugs that may lead to side-effects. The third application finds new potential sites on the protein that may provide targets for drug design. Each of the three applications may aid in assigning a function and in classification of binding patterns. We highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each type of search, provide examples of large-scale searches of the entire Protein Data Base and make functional predictions.",

Since proteins function by interacting with other molecules, similarity in the binding patterns of proteins is closely related to similarity in their biological functions. There are two potential ways to infer the function of a novel protein. The first is to recognize a sequence or fold similarity with a protein(s) whose function is known. However, a similar fold does not necessarily imply a similar function. For example, proteins with the same fold, like TIM barrels, can have multiple functions. 1 On the other hand, proteins with different folds, like subtilisin and trypsin, can share the same function. The alternative approach, implemented in our method, is to investigate the physico-chemical patterns and shape of the protein molecular surface. Proteins are assumed to perform similar functions if they share similar binding patterns and recognize similar binding partners, even if they have different sequences and (overall) fold homology.",

This is particularly important, since a single protein-binding site may have several binding patterns. Not only can the same binding site bind different ligands with different functional groups, but there is also evidence that at least in some enzymes a single compound can bind in different ways. 10 -12 A wide variety of methods have been developed for protein structural alignment. 13 Most existing methods describe a protein structure by its C a atoms and seek to maximize the overall similarity of the structures.

These allow recognition of the \"catalytic triads\" that are typical for some of the protein families, like serine proteases, triacylglycerol lipases, ribonucleases and lysozymes. Using atomic representation, the geometric hashing technique 19 -21 was applied to efficiently compare a query protein to the template of the catalytic triad. This algorithm (TESS) has been recently updated by JESS, 22 which is flexible and unconstrained by the template syntax.

Unlike other methods that use the computationally expensive clique detection algorithm (NP-hard), 37, 38 our heuristic algorithm is based on efficient hashing and matching of triangles of centers of physico-chemical properties. It introduces a low-resolution representation by chemically important surface points and performs fast scoring of all possible solutions, while retaining the correct ones. Successive scoring schemes, which are applied to smaller numbers of candidate solutions, perform a thorough exploration of the overall similarity of the surfaces as well as of local shapes of the chemically similar regions. We apply SiteEngine to a set of biological applications. First, we introduce a benchmark dataset, which is used to construct two surface description databases: one of complete protein structures and the other of binding sites. We compare between various searching applications that can be performed for recognition of functional sites. Each application is illustrated by examples of successful recognition of specific types of protein binding sites such as estradiol binding, adenine and ATP binding. For each example, we further make some specific predictions by providing a list of proteins recognized to share functional similarities with the query. We provide examples of classification of fatty acid-binding proteins and serine proteases and show the capability of the method to recognize the known similarity of the binding sites as well as of the catalytic residues. At the next stage, we apply SiteEngine to search a non-redundant dataset of all known protein structures. We describe the binding sites that are recognized to be the most similar to our query binding sites and discuss the quality of the predictions obtained. Since SiteEngine searches a complete structure of each protein in a matter of seconds, we find it to be well suited for such large-scale applications.",

However, from the algorithmic standpoint, the second type of comparison is essentially the same as searching for a given binding site on a protein surface, which is limited to a certain region of interest. Therefore, here we describe the algorithmic approach of SiteEngine for searching a complete protein structure for a region similar to a given binding site. The input to the algorithm consists of a binding site of one protein and of a complete structure of another, where the binding sites are defined by the surface description of the relevant regions. The structure of the complete molecule is searched for the presence of a region, which is similar to the inputbinding site. The output is a transformation that superimposes the input-binding site on the recognized region and a score that measures the similarity between them. The main stages of the algorithm are summarized in Figure 1 (a).",

The rules for the representation of each amino acid as a set of such centers follow Schmitt et al. 35 However, unlike their definition, we do not consider a peptide bond as an aromatic property and we do not estimate the directionality of the H-bonding property. Figure 2 (a) shows an example of a representation of cavity-flanking residues. In addition, we consider the pseudocenters of H-bonding properties of the side-chains of Arg, Lys and His to be positively charged, and those of Asp and Glu to be negatively charged.

This provides physico-chemical labeling of the surface regions, so that only surface patches with similar properties will be matched. We use a smooth molecular surface as implemented by Connolly 34, 39 and a Distance Transform grid, as implemented by Duhovny et al. 40 For each chemically labeled surface patch we estimate the patch center by a surface point nearest to its center of gravity (see Figure 2 (b) and (c)). Each patch center is used to estimate the average curvature of its surface patch by calculation of the solid angle shape function. 40 -42 In this calculation, a sphere of a certain radius is placed at the patch center. The average curvature is approximated by the fraction of the sphere inside the solventexcluded volume of the protein. The radius of the sphere determines the region in which the curvature is approximated. We perform two calculations with different definitions of the radius of the sphere. In the first calculation, we consider a minimum radius sphere bounding the surface patch represented by the patch center. In the second calculation, the radius is user defined (by default, 6.0 \u00c5 for hydrophobic regions and 3 \u00c5 for others).

The hashing stage of SiteEngine is extremely efficient, due to the consideration of the physico-chemical properties of the pseudocenters in addition to the geometrical constraints. As a result, we create less false-positive transformations and therefore greatly reduce the overall number of candidate solutions. We can score each candidate transformation and avoid any loss of competitive solutions due to the low number of votes.

The maximum weight match 47 in this graph provides a 1:1 correspondence between subsets of pseudocenters of the two molecules. The obtained match represents a set of pairs of pseudocenters of the two molecules, so that the points of each pair are the most similar in their geometrical and physicochemical properties.",

Second, our motivation was to include representatives of important and well-studied structural families so that we will be able to check the classification capabilities and the consistency of our method. We have selected seven different protein families: HIV-1/HIV-2, HIV protease, anhydrase, antibiotics, fatty acid-binding proteins, chorismate mutases and serine proteases.

Figure 5 represents an analysis of a binding site of phoshoinositide 3-kinase (1e8x) that is ranked third. The protein that was used for the alignment is in a complex with ATP. However, there is another structure of the same protein in a complex with wortmannin (PDB code 1e7u), which has structural similarity to estradiol. Figure 5(a) -(c) show the similarity between wortmannin (C 23 H 24 O 8 ) and estradiol (C 18 H 24 O 2 ). Figure 5 (d) presents the alignment between the surfaces of the binding sites of phoshoinositide 3-kinase (1e8x) and a sex hormone-binding globulin (1lhu). Ranked fourth is a binding site of a beta-lactoglobulin complexed with retinoic acid. As in the previous case, the alignment obtained between the binding sites provides a good superimposition between the hydrophobic ligands of estradiol and retinoic acid and places the retinoic acid in the estradiol-binding pocket as would be done with a docking program. 4, 5, 9 It is important to note that the binding sites of all estradiol-binding proteins are correctly recognized in spite of the fact that five of them were not complexed with estradiol. Some of these ligands are very different from estradiol both in their size and in chemical structure. However, these differences in binding partners as well as the local flexibility that is required to accommodate them did not prevent the successful recognition of the functional similarities made by SiteEngine.",

The catalytic residues (ordered from right to left) Ser225, His71, Asp38 of 3tec (colored blue) and Ser195, His57, Asp102 of 2ptc (colored red) are displayed in ball-andstick. SiteEngine has recognized the similarity between the residues of serine (right) and histidine (middle).

The Figure presents the catalytic histidine residues (in ball-and-stick) of these proteins, when they are superimposed on 1q2w by the transformation calculated by SiteEngine. The catalytic His41 of 1q2w is colored blue, His71 of 3tec is green and His57 of 2ptc is red.

We have calculated the RMSD 45 between the ligands of these proteins when they are superimposed by two transformations: one defined by the superimposition of the C a atoms and the other defined by SiteEngine. As can be seen, the RMSD in all cases is very low and even existing techniques like docking 4,5 consider such transformations to be a success. As detailed below, binding sites of fatty acid-binding proteins that did not receive a high rank are known to exhibit a different binding pattern than the query protein. However, all database binding sites that were extracted from fatty acidbinding proteins were correctly superimposed on the region of the query protein known as its binding site. To visualize these results, Figure 7 (a) presents the superimposition of the ligands from these binding sites on the query protein. No ligand information was used during the search and each ligand is superimposed onto the structure of the query protein using the transformation obtained by the alignment between the database-binding site and the query protein.

The absence of an exact definition of the pattern we are looking for makes the evaluation of such partial solutions even more complicated. Considering the superimposition between the ligands obtained by an alignment between unrelated proteins can also be misleading. Similar binding sites may accommodate ligands that differ in their size and shape and it is not clear what should be the correct superimposition between them. Figure 8(a) presents an alignment between the ATP ligands of the hexamerization domain of N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor (1nsf) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (1atp) obtained by the alignment of the corresponding binding sites. As can be seen in the Figure, the superimposition of the ligand molecules achieves a good alignment between the ribose parts of the ATP molecules while the orientation of the adenine moieties is different. However, when the binding sites are artificially superimposed using the transformation that aligns the adenine moieties, the distance between the phosphate tails of the ATP molecules is approximately 20 \u00c5 and only six pseudocenters are identified to be similar (as opposed to nine Figure 8 . Alignment between the ligands induced by the alignment of the binding sites.

The colored spheres represent the centers of interaction recognized by the program. The coloring of the spheres is as in Figure 2 . The spheres of 1nsf are smaller. It can be seen that the solution provides a good alignment between the ribose parts of the two ATP molecules at the expense of the alignment between the adenine moieties. (b) Alignment between the NAD and ATP ligands of lactate dehydrogenase (9ldt) and hypothetical protein MJ0577 (1mjh) obtained by the alignment of the corresponding binding sites. The solution provides a good alignment between the ribose parts of the NAD and ATP ligand molecules. However, the adenine ring of ATP is aligned to a nicotinamide ring of NAD, and not to its adenine ring as expected. As can be seen, the resulting alignment provides a superimposition of 13 functional groups, that are depicted as balls. Moreover, it provides an alignment of two conserved residues His40 and Val142 of 1mjh (colored cyan) and His195, Val32 of 9ldt (colored blue) that are located in similar spatial locations. pseudocenters identified by SiteEngine). Therefore, it is not straightforward to identify which solution is the correct one, especially due to the fact that the adenine moiety is known to exhibit two different binding modes. 10 Figure 8 (b) presents an alignment between the NAD and ATP ligands of lactate dehydrogenase (9ldt) and the hypothetical protein MJ0577(1mjh) obtained by the alignment of the corresponding binding sites. Once again, the alignment between the binding sites of the proteins provides an alignment between the ribose parts of the NAD and ATP ligand molecules. However, the adenine ring of the ATP is aligned to the nicotinamide ring of NAD (and not to an adenine ring as expected). This solution provides the alignment of 13 similar centers of interaction shared by these binding regions. Moreover, there are two residues (1mjh, His40, Val142; 9ldt, His195, Val32) that are present in both binding sites and have the same spatial locations as well as identity of the amino acid. Since SiteEngine is a software tool it recognizes regions that maximize the similarity; however, it cannot assess the biological significance of the obtained predictions.

We have illustrated this application by searching the database with a complete structure of a fatty acid-binding protein. SiteEngine has successfully selected from the database of binding sites those that are known to be similar to the query and suggested a good alignment between them. However, the ranking of binding sites of different size according to their similarity to different regions on the surface of the complete protein is not straightforward. In this work, the ranking was done according to how much of the database-binding site was matched during the search. However, some binding sites received a high rank due to their small size and the fact that some surface patterns have a high probability of appearance on the surface of any protein structure. These considerations must be taken into account when developing more reliable searches of this type.",

The 13 best solutions are the adenine binding sites of these proteins. In total, there are 17 such sites among the 30 top-ranking solutions. These binding sites were correctly located on the surfaces of these proteins and the performance of SiteEngine in these cases was similar to the five top-ranking solutions presented in Table 1 . It is interesting to note that only five of the recognized adenine-binding sites are complexed with adenine, while the rest are unbound or accommodate other ligands. Ranked 19 is the correctly recognized binding site of a replication factor C (1iqp) that accommodates an ADP molecule. Figure 9 (a) shows the correct recognition of this site and Figure 9 (b) presents an additional binding site of D-Ala-D-Ala ligase (1iow) that accommodates an ADP molecule and is ranked 31. As can be seen the transformation calculated by SiteEngine provides a perfect alignment between the ATP substrate of the query site to the ADP of the recognized region. In spite of the difference between the overall structures, these proteins were recognized to have similar shapes of the binding sites and share 12 functional groups located in similar spatial locations.

In both cases, these two solutions were followed by a hypothetical protein YggV (1k7k). Although extremely similar to the query, this protein is also a part of the Structural Genomics project and its function is unknown. When searched with a bound form of MJ0226 (2mjp), ranked 4 is a binding site of autoinducer-2 production protein LuxS (1j6w) and ranked 5 is a tandem phosphatase domain of RPTP LAR (1lar). Ranked 6 is a binding site of adenylate kinase with the substrate-mimicking inhibitor Ap5A. This inhibitor can be considered as an ATP molecule coupled to an AMP molecule via the additional phosphate group and its interaction with the protein shows the pathway of phosphoryl transfer. 72 SiteEngine has recognized a high degree of similarity of the regions that interact with the phosphate groups, which are aligned by the calculated transformation. A similar alignment is also recognized with the GNP-binding site of a G protein gialphal (1cip, ranked 27), presented in Figure  10 (c). This result seems consistent with the suggestion by Hwang et al. 71 that this protein can function similarly to the signal sorters of G-proteins. When searched with an unbound form of MJ0226 (1b78), the ranking of the results (other than the top three) is slightly different due to the differences of the surfaces of the bound and unbound forms. Ranked 4 is a copper amine oxidase (1ivw), ranked 5 is a tryptophan indol-lyase (1ax4) and ranked 6 is a farnesyl diphosphate synthase (1uby). Figure  10 (d) illustrates the result that is ranked 31, in which we recognize similarity to a UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine-D-glutamate (MurD) ligase (2uag). The obtained alignment of the binding sites provides a superimposition of the ANP substrate of the query to a nucleotide precursor UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-L-alanine (UMA). As can be seen, the rings of the two ligands participate in similar aromatic interactions with a phenyl residue that is present in both binding sites. In total, these binding sites share three residues (1b78 Asn19, Asp73, Phe149, and 2uag Asn138, Asp35, Phe422) that have the same spatial location and identity.",

In the current version of SiteEngine there is no implicit treatment of electrostatic potentials that have a strong impact on the interaction. Addition of such consideration may help to filter the false-positive solutions like the one presented in Figure 5 . Additional weaknesses of the method are the requirement of high-resolution protein structures and addressing protein molecules as rigid bodies. Protein flexibility is addressed only through a set of thresholds that allow a certain variability in the locations. These are definitely insufficient for efficient searches of binding sites that can bind large flexible molecules.",

One is the absence of a clear definition of what exactly is a functional site and what are the features that define it. When the binding site is defined by its contacts with the smaller ligand, a significant amount of information may be missed. As a result, essential features might be ignored and the extracted pattern might be partially aligned to other functionally different binding sites. There is no simple automatic solution to this problem. One possibility is the construction of a database of consensus binding patterns, common to all proteins with the same function. Another problem is assessing the statistical significance of the obtained results. These are strongly influenced by the number of functional sites of the same type present in the searched database. Although the ASTRAL dataset provides a non-redundant coverage of protein structures, it contains many redundancies of functional sites. In order to provide a truly representative statistical evaluation it is essential to consider a non-redundant dataset of functional sites, the construction of which is a future challenge. In order to efficiently address these problems there is a need for methods for multiple structural alignments between binding sites. In the future, we intend to utilize the insights we have gained in the present method for the development of such algorithms.",
