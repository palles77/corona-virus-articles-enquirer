Although MERS-CoV infection is ubiquitous in dromedaries across Africa as well as in the Arabian Peninsula, zoonotic disease appears confined to the Arabian Peninsula. MERS-CoVs from Africa have hitherto been poorly studied. We genetically and phenotypically characterized MERS-CoV from dromedaries sampled in Morocco, Burkina Faso, Nigeria, and Ethiopia. Viruses from Africa (clade C) are phylogenetically distinct from contemporary viruses from the Arabian Peninsula (clades A and B) but remain antigenically similar in microneutralization tests. Viruses from West (Nigeria, Burkina Faso) and North (Morocco) Africa form a subclade, C1, that shares clade-defining genetic signatures including deletions in the accessory gene ORF4b. Compared with human and camel MERS-CoV from Saudi Arabia, virus isolates from Burkina Faso (BF785) and Nigeria (Nig1657) had lower virus replication competence in Calu-3 cells and in ex vivo cultures of human bronchus and lung. BF785 replicated to lower titer in lungs of human DPP4transduced mice. A reverse genetics-derived recombinant MERS-CoV (EMC) lacking ORF4b elicited higher type I and III IFN responses than the isogenic EMC virus in Calu-3 cells. However, ORF4b deletions may not be the major determinant of the reduced replication competence of BF785 and Nig1657. Genetic and phenotypic differences in West African viruses may be relevant to zoonotic potential. There is an urgent need for studies of MERS-CoV at the animal-human interface.",

Many human infections are zoonotic in origin, but some result from clusters of human-to-human transmission, especially within hospitals and health care facilities (2) . Zoonotic disease has been reported from the Arabian Peninsula, and dromedary camels are the only confirmed source of zoonotic infection (3) . Although MERScoronavirus (MERS-CoV) is also endemic in dromedaries in Africa, where the majority of dromedary camels are found (4-7), zoonotic infections have not been reported from Africa. Hypotheses for this pattern of zoonotic disease include genetic differences in the viruses; cultural, behavioral, or dietary differences in interactions between humans and camels and camel products; or unnoticed human cases through lack of awareness and surveillance in African countries. Data on phylogenetic and phenotypic characterization of Significance Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is a zoonotic disease of global health concern, and dromedary camels are the source of human infection. Although Africa has the largest number of dromedary camels, and MERS-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is endemic in these camels, locally acquired zoonotic MERS is not reported from Africa. However, little is known of the genetic or phenotypic characterization of MERS-CoV from Africa. In this study we characterize MERS-CoV from Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Morocco, and Ethiopia. We demonstrate viral genetic and phenotypic differences in viruses from West Africa, which may be relevant to differences in zoonotic potential, highlighting the need for studies of MERS-CoV at the animal-human interface.",

Viruses from Nigeria, Burkina Faso, Morocco, and Ethiopia formed a monophyletic clade together with previously sequenced viruses from Egypt, which we now provisionally designate as virus \"clade C.\" A time-resolved phylogeny of currently available MERS-CoV sequences, including those generated in this study from diverse parts of Africa, is shown in Fig. S1 . An analysis of synapomorphies (mutations inferred to have occurred once in the tree), homoplasies (repeat mutations), and reversions within available MERS-CoV full-genome sequences is shown in Fig. S2 . Viruses from Burkina Faso (n = 3), Morocco (n = 1), and Nigeria (n = 9) had signature deletions in the ORF4b and/or ORF3 gene regions ( Fig. S3 ) and are designated \"clade C1\" (Fig. 1 ). Clade C viruses from Ethiopia (n = 4) and Egypt (n = 3) did not have such gene deletions, nor do the majority of viruses from the Arabian Peninsula. However, sequences of two clade B human viruses detected in 2012 (Riyadh_1_2012 and Bisha_1_2012) available in public databases also have short (17-nt) deletions in the ORF4b region in a similar, although not identical, region as the African isolates (Fig. S3 ). Targeted sequencing of the ORF3/4b gene region was done on additional African camel viruses from which full genomes could not be obtained because viral load was too low. Overall, all 10 additional viruses from Burkina Faso carried these same signature deletions, frame shift mutations, or premature stop-codons that markedly reduced the size of the ORF4b, but none of the 10 additional viruses from Ethiopia did so (Fig. S3 ). Clade C1 viruses with ORF4b deletions appear to share a common ancestor, with a 6-nt and a 360-nt deletion in ORF4b denoted as the \"ancestral type i ORF4b deletion\" in the phylogenetic tree ( Fig. 1 ) and in the schematic of the deletion (Fig. S3 ). This deletion has been added to progressively, and these deletions are denoted as \"ii,\" \"iii,\" \"iv,\" and \"v\" along the branches of the phylogenetic tree ( Fig. 1 ) and the schematic (Fig. S3 ). Some of these viruses (Nigeria/HKU NV1657-like and Burkina Faso/CIRAD-HKU697-like) have also acquired deletions in ORF3. Notably, the Ethiopian and Egyptian viruses encoded a full-length ORF3.",

The type i/v deletion found in BF785 and BF434 viruses truncated the ORF4b protein from 246 aa found in the EMC prototype MERS-CoV EMC to 14 aa, deleting the whole of the nuclear localization signal as well as the enzymatic domain that cleaves 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate (9) . Nig1657 retains the nuclear localization signal and part of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) domain and is truncated to 71 aa. All these deletions disrupt the PDE catalytic site. ORF4b encoded a polypeptide known to be an IFN antagonist (10, 11) . The N-terminal region of ORF4b encodes the nuclear localization signal. Deletion of this region abrogated nuclear localization and led to a loss of suppression of IFN-\u03b2 induction via the IRF3-and IRF7-signaling pathways. However, it did not affect suppression of IFN-\u03b2 via Tank-binding kinase 1 and I\u03baB kinase, which was demonstrated in transient transfection experiments and appears to be mediated by the C-terminal domain of ORF4b (10) . These data come from ORF4b protein overexpression and may or may not be physiologically relevant. The two Saudi Arabian clade B viruses Riyadh_1 and Bisha_1 had less extensive deletions of the PDE domain, although they also disrupt the PDE catalytic site.",

However, while zoonotic MERS has been repeatedly reported from the Arabian Peninsula, zoonotic human disease has not so far been reported in Africa. There are, however, little viral genetic data from MERS-CoV in Africa. To begin to address this knowledge gap, we genetically characterized MERS-CoV from Burkina Faso, Nigeria, Morocco, and Ethiopia. We found that MERS-CoV circulating in dromedaries in Africa are phylogenetically distinct from viruses in the Arabian Peninsula. There are no homoplasies (convergent mutations) shared between the African and Saudi clades, suggesting no recombination between these lineages (consistent with a single or just a few introductions into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and limited further contact between the lineages). MERS-CoV from North and West Africa form a distinct subclade (clade C1) within those from Africa, and they have characteristic deletions in ORF4b, an accessory gene that has been previously reported to be an IFN antagonist (10, 11) . Some of these viruses also have partial deletions of ORF3. The biological function of ORF3 still remains unclear. Dromedary camel movements in Africa occur more in the north-south direction with movements between countries such as Morocco, Burkina Faso, and Nigeria being more much likely than east-west movements, i.e., between West Africa and Ethiopia or Egypt (17) . This may explain the observed separate phylogenetic clustering of viruses from West and North Africa as clade C1, which were also the viruses that have the ORF4b gene deletions. Although genetically distinct, MERS-CoV from West Africa were antigenically similar to the prototype EMC virus (clade A), AH13 (clade B), and Egypt NRCE-HKU270 (clade C, nonclade C1) viruses in microneutralization tests. Thus, it is likely that neutralizing antibodies elicited by the prototype strain EMC in putative vaccines are likely to be cross-protective against these genetically diverse African strains.",

In contrast to influenza H5N1, which was a potent inducer of IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03bb1, IP10, ISG15, and Mx1 by 24 h post infection, the four MERS-CoV had little effect in up-regulating these innate immune responses at 24 h post infection, suggesting that potent innate immune-evasion mechanisms remained active in all four coronaviruses despite the ORF4b deletion in BF785 and Nig1657 viruses (Fig. 3) . Coronaviruses have multiple antagonists of IFN induction and signaling, and thus deletion of ORF4b by itself may not be decisive in this regard. By 48 h post infection, there was detectable induction of innate immune responses by some MERS-CoV, although this was still much lower than those elicited by H5N1 virus. Nig1657 also has deletions in ORF3. No consistent pattern was discerned between innate immune responses (or evasion of such responses) and the impaired virus replication competence of BF785 and Nig1657. Taking these findings together, we conclude that the impaired replication phenotype was not associated with the lack of innate immune evasion. In contrast, it was recently reported that a recombinant MERS-CoV clone with ORF3/4/5 deletions had reduced virus replication competence in Calu-3 (but not Vero) cells and in the lungs of human DPP4-transgenic mice, suggesting that the combined loss of these ORFs does lead to attenuation of the virus (18) .",

We found rgEMC\u03944b viral titers did not significantly differ from rgEMC-WT at 24 h replication, in contrast with BF785 and Nig1657 viruses where replication was significantly reduced at this time. Thus, the ORF4b deletions in BF785 and Nig1657 were likely not major contributors to the reduced virus replication observed in clade C1 virus-infected cells. At 48 h post infection rgEMC-WT replicated to modestly lower titers compared with rgEMC\u03944b. The rgEMC\u03944b virus elicited significantly higher mRNA expression of IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03bb1, CXCL10 (IP-10), ISG15, and MX1 in rgEMC\u03944b-infected cells. Previous evidence for an IFN antagonist role for ORF4b protein (10, 11) was based solely on the overexpression of ORF4b, while our data were generated from an isogenic deletion mutant virus. Increased mRNA of type I IFN and type III IFN as well as TNF-\u03b1 suggests that ORF4b has effects on IRF-3 as well as NF\u03baB pathways.",

Although these viruses have deletions in ORF4b, this does not appear to be the major explanation for the reduced viral replication competence of clade C1 viruses. It is relevant that two clade B viruses, Riyadh_1_2012 and Bisha_1_2012, which also have ORF4b deletions, have previously been isolated from patients with severe human disease. Thus, ORF4b deletions by themselves are unlikely to contribute to altered zoonotic transmission of West African viruses. Furthermore, in previous experiments where EMC virus has been serially passaged in mice to derive mouse-adapted MERS-CoV, such mouse adaptation and increase in virulence for mice have often been associated with deletions or frameshift mutations in all the accessory proteins, including ORF5 (19, 20) . Recently, a clade B MERS-CoV with a deletion in ORF4a (a different accessory gene) and a minor deletion in ORF3 has been isolated from humans diagnosed as part of a hospital outbreak in Jordan (21) . All 13 viruses from patients sampled during this outbreak had this ORF4a deletion, indicating that these viruses were transmissible in humans. ORF4a is also known to be an IFN antagonist acting by binding and antagonizing the dsRNA-binding protein PACT (22) . It is not yet reported whether ORF4a deletions in these human MERS-CoV affect IFN responses or virus replication competence.",

Clade C1 MERS-CoV that are enzootic in dromedaries in West Africa had lower replication competence in human respiratory epithelium in vitro, in cultures of human bronchus and lung ex vivo, and in the lungs of experimentally infected mice. The genetic determinants of this reduced virus replication competence of clade C1 viruses remains to be established. It is possible that these observations may be relevant to explain the apparent lack of zoonotic disease in West Africa. It is important to note that viruses from Egypt were not phenotypically different to those from the Arabian Peninsula, and thus there is no indication that MERS-CoV from East Africa have reduced zoonotic potential. These findings highlight the need for more extensive and sustainable surveillance and monitoring systems, especially in East Africa, including seroepidemiologic studies in humans regularly exposed to dromedaries, to ascertain whether unrecognized zoonotic MERS infections are taking place.",

The RNA expression of viral gene (UpE) (A), mRNA expression of IFNs (IFN-\u03b2, and IFN-\u03bb1) (B and C), IFN-inducible genes IP-10 (D), ISG15 (E), and MX1 (F), and a proinflammatory cytokine TNF-\u03b1 (G) is shown as the mean and SEM of three biological replicates. The detection limit of each gene was 20 copies. (H)",
