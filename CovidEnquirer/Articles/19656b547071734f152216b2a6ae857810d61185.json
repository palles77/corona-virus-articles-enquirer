Spinal cord compression can occur from canal stenosis, vertebral malalignment, or instability. III. Hemivertebrae are most commonly associated with clinical signs. IV. Signs are often slowly progressive, owing to the chronic compression. V. Neurological defi cits are consistent with a transverse myelo-Myelography is useful for determining the extent of associated cord compression or stenosis. III. MRI is valuable in determining associated spinal cord compression or concurrent spinal cord anomalies. Treatment I. If clinical signs are nonprogressive, conservative management is recommended. II. Surgical decompression combined with stabilization is recommended for progressive clinical signs from spinal cord compression. I. Prognosis is good if the defect is an incidental fi nding; vertebral anomalies can become clinical later in life. II. Prognosis is guarded with chronic, progressive cord compression. Spina bifi da occulta indicates that the spinal cord and meninges are normal. III. Clinical spina bifi da is accompanied by a meningocele or a meningomyelocele. IV. Meningocele is a protrusion of the meninges through the vertebral cleft. V. Meningomyelocele is a protrusion of the meninges and spinal cord through the vertebral cleft. I. Spina bifi da is likely the result of abnormal development of the neural tube. II. Teratogenic compounds, nutritional defi ciencies, and environmental factors may be associated with spina bifi da. III. A high incidence in the bulldog and Manx cats suggests a heritable cause. IV. In Manx cats and bulldogs, there is an association with sacrocaudal dysgenesis. V. In the Manx, an autosomal-dominant condition leads to absence of the tail and to several sacral-related abnormalities. I. Spina bifi da is rarely associated with clinical signs. II. When present, signs vary with the degree of spinal cord and meningeal involvement. III. Most lesions occur in the caudal lumbar region, but can occur in any vertebra. IV. Physical examination may reveal abnormal directions of hair growth, a skin dimple, or an open tract draining cerebrospinal fl uid (CSF) at the site of the lesion. V. Fistulous meningocele can cause hypochloremia and hyponatremia subsequent to CSF loss. Dorsoventral radiographs of the vertebral column may reveal an absence of the spinous process(es). III.

MRI may detect specifi c spinal cord changes and is advised before surgical intervention.Treatment and MonitoringI. Treatment is not necessary for spina bifi da occulta. II. Meningoceles can be surgically resected in cases without concurrent spinal cord lesions. III. Tethered spinal cord syndrome can be treated surgically by severing the fi lum terminale. IV. Surgical closure of spina bifi da aperta, removal of the fi stulous tract, and broad-spectrum antibiotics may be necessary to reduce the incidence of bacterial meningomyelitis. V.
