Live viral vaccines. Live virus vaccines are prepared from viral strains that have been attenuated, but retain their ability to replicate in the human host and thus their ability to induce protective immune responses. 5 Out of the 15 viruses against which antiviral vaccines are currently licensed in the United States, nine are live attenuated (Table 15 .1).

Several methods have been used to attenuate virus strains in order to be safely used as human vaccines. One method depended on the use of viral strains that are specific to a different host as vaccine strain. The oldest example of such strategy is the use of cowpox virus to vaccinate humans against smallpox. 6 Another strategy relied on attenuation of the virus by passaging it in unnatural host or cells. Examples of this approach are the development of 17D, the yellow fever vaccine strain and polioviruses. 7 Introducing the virus via unnatural route is a strategy used to develop adenovirus Types 4 and 7 vaccine, which is given orally. 8 Finally, generation of temperature sensitive mutants such as the live attenuated influenza vaccines. 9 2. Inactivated whole viral vaccines. Whole inactivated virus preparations are prepared by simply inactivating viral particles by heat, UV irradiation or by special chemical treatments. Formalin and beta-propiolactone are the most commonly used chemicals for this purpose. Vaccines against polioviruses and influenza were among the first to be prepared using this strategy. 10, 11 Immunogenicity of these viral preparations is usually robust as they contain multiple pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that could engage several of the host innate immune receptors such as the toll-like receptors (TLRs). 12 For polio, an incident of incomplete inactivation of the vaccine preparation resulted in an outbreak of paralytic poliomyelitis in the United States, the so-called \"Cutter Incident.\" 13, 14 Hence, safety of such preparations has always been a concern. 3. Subunit vaccines. Due to the increased risk of reactogenicity associated with whole inactivated virus vaccine preparations, purified preparations that contain the main targets of protective immune responses were developed. 15 Subunit vaccines that contain the surface glycoproteins of influenza and hepatitis B viruses are currently licensed (Table 15 .1). Subunit vaccines show an improved reactogenicity profile compared to whole inactivated virus preparations, but this is usually at the expense of the immunogenicity of the vaccine. When administered with adjuvants, immune responses to these vaccines can be significantly enhanced. 16 ",

Virus-like particles (VLPs). VLPs are multimeric structures assembled from viral structural proteins. They often display viral surface proteins in a high-density repetitive manner on their surface, which may play a role in the enhanced immunogenicity observed with this kind of vaccines compared to recombinant viral proteins. [19] [20] [21] [22] In 1986, the first antiviral VLP vaccine (against hepatitis B) had been licensed. 23 The vaccine is based on the hepatitis B surface antigen or HBsAg, which upon expression in yeast forms spherical VLPs that are then adsorbed onto alum as adjuvant.",

To date, all human vaccines that have shown considerable success in combating viral infections depend on antibodies as the primary mediators of protection. 1 The process of generating these antibodies starts when a vaccine antigen encounters and binds to its specific B cell. In the presence of cognate CD4 T-cell help, these vaccine specific B cells start to expand. 30 Some of the activated B cells differentiate into plasmablasts whose function is to secrete an early protective wave of antigen-specific antibodies. 30 In a primary vaccination, those early antibodies are mostly IgM and bind to the vaccine antigen with a relatively low affinity. A subset of the activated B cells will continue expanding forming specially organized structures in the secondary lymph nodes known as germinal centers (GCs). 30 GCs are where vaccine-specific B cells with the highest antigen binding affinity are preferentially selected and also where the majority of antibody isotype-switching from IgM to IgG and IgA occurs. 31 Antibodies can protect against viral infections via several ways:",

In contrast to antibodies that recognize epitopes in 3-dimensional conformation, T cells recognize linear peptides from the infecting agent that are expressed on MHC molecules on the surface of virus-infected cells. Some of these peptides come from viral proteins that do not exhibit extensive antigenic variation making T cells an important mechanism of protection against rapidly evolving viruses. 37 CD4 + T cells contribute to antiviral vaccine effectiveness in several ways; secreting cytokines such as IFN-\u03b3 and TNF and supporting the activation of B cells and CD8 + T cells (Th1); secretion of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and other cytokines to support B-cell activation and differentiation (Th2); triggering the formation and maintenance of the GC reaction via the expression of CD40L and secretion of IL-21 (Tfh). CD8 + T cells, on the other hand, clear virus infected cells by directly killing those cells (through the release of perforins and granzymes) or indirectly by secreting inflammatory cytokines. CD8 + T-cells can control viral burden and thus limit the severity of the disease.

These analyses provide us with enormous insights about a variety of biological processes that an immune cell experiences such as activation, proliferation, differentiation and death when responding to a foreign antigen. At the beginning the number of fluorescent dyes (which are conjugated to antibodies so that each dye could be assigned to one molecule) that could be used simultaneously was limited to one or two. This number has dramatically expanded (up to 18) over the past two decades. 41 These advances came from the introduction of novel fluorescent dyes that provided additional excitation and emission spectra to be used.

Most RNA viruses such as HIV and influenza exist as quasispecies and the introduction of deep sequencing technology has afforded us a higher resolution look at such diversity instead of analyzing individual viruses. 1 Each clonal pool of antigen-specific B or T cell share a distinct junction region that is formed at the site of the B-cell receptor (BCR) heavy or T-cell receptor (TCR) beta gene segments ligation. 47 Interrogating the B-cell repertoire by deep sequencing allowed us to study the diversity of B-cell responses to viral infections and vaccinations. 46 By diversity here we refer to how many distinct clonal pools are participating in the B-or T-cell response to a particular vaccine. This is particularly important when analyzing responses to vaccines against highly variable viruses such as influenza and HIV. Against such viruses it is better to have a polyclonal response that is directed against several epitopes than a focused response. Moreover, tracking B-cell clonal pools that secrete antibodies of desired specificity or quality has helped in studying the ontogeny and evolution of such responses. 48 Similar analyses have been performed on the alpha and beta chain of the TCRs. 49 6.

More than a 100 years ago, Emil von Behring developed passive immunotherapy using serum to treat infections, such as diphtheria and tetanus and was awarded the Nobel prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1901. 50 The advent of hybridoma technology in the mid-1970s introduced the concept of generating a monoclonal antibody with a single defined specificity. 51 Over the past two decades, tremendous efforts have gone into developing technologies to generate human mAbs. The currently most widely used methodologies to generate human mAbs are: a. Phage display libraries: As the name indicates, phages are designed to express single-chain variable antibody fragments (scFvs) or antigenbinding fragments (Fabs) on their surface and screened for binding to the desired antigen. The libraries are constructed from the variable genes of B cells isolated from vaccinated individuals or from convalescent patients. This method has been successfully used to generate neutralizing mAbs against many viruses including West Nile, rabies, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus, hepatitis A, HIV, Ebola, yellow fever, hepatitis C, measles and influenza. 52 A major drawback of this method is that it cannot be used to examine the repertoire or the immunodominance hierarchy of the antigen-specific B-cell response as the antibody fragments displayed were generated by random pairing of the BCR heavy and light chains and not from a naturally existing pairing. 53 b. B-cell immortalization: B cells can be immortalized by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) mediated transformation. 54 Immortalized B cells can then be stimulated to secrete antibodies and those antibodies are screened for the desired specificity. B-cell pools secreting the desired antibody are then cloned by limiting dilution into single cells and the BCR genes are sequenced. This method has been used to generate mAbs against many viruses including influenza, HIV, SARS, dengue, and RSV. [55] [56] [57] [58] While this method is effective in isolating mAbs from rare memory B cells, 59 it is labor-intensive, as it requires the screening of thousands of immortalized memory B cells in order to isolate few mAbs with the desired specificity.",

            "text": "1. Structure-based immunogen design. As mentioned earlier, the design an immunogen to be used as an antiviral vaccine has always been an empirical process. The immunogen was picked based on its ability to elicit a detectable protective immune response. While this process was sufficient for many viruses, for some challenging viruses such as HIV and influenza, a deeper analysis of the epitopes targeted by neutralizing antibodies was needed. 63 The traditional way of determining the amino acid residues within a viral protein that are recognized-and thus mediate virus neutralization-by a certain mAb is the generation of viral escape mutants. This method was instrumental in mapping the major neutralizing epitopes within the influenza HA molecule. 64 However, this method has several drawbacks; (1) some neutralizing mAbs fail to generate escape mutants such as the influenza broadly neutralizing mAbs recognizing the HA stem region (discussed later in the chapter) and therefore could not be mapped using this approach; (2) the increased risk and logistic difficulties associated with the generation of escape mutants against certain viruses, such as the highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses and Ebola; (3) given that the majority of neutralizing mAbs recognize conformational epitopes so identifying a single or few amino acid residues that contribute to binding does not provide a complete picture; (4) a change of an amino acid residue in an escape mutant does not necessarily mean that this residue is the point of contact between the viral protein and the mAb. A change of the epitope conformation induced by the change of an adjacent amino acid residue could also be responsible for the generation of an escape mutant. In 1990, the first crystal structure of a viral glycoprotein-antibody complex was published. 65 Solving such structures for many viral glycoproteins has allowed us to examine the binding of antibodies to their respective epitopes at the atomic level. More importantly, it provided the basis for rationally designing viral immunogens that could-at least theoretically-induce an immune response enriched with antibodies with a desired specificity. This idea has recently been tested with partial success in the efforts to generate targeted antibody responses to HIV, RSV, and influenza. 1 These early experiments have also revealed that more work is needed to fully understand how these complex epitopes are recognized by B cells in vivo and how to minimally design an immunogen without interrupting its stability as a protein or the antigenicity of the epitope. 1 2. DNA-and RNA-based vaccines. The concept of using naked DNA as a vaccine was introduced in the early 1990s. 66 It rapidly gained traction mainly due to its simplicity and versatility. While the early clinical trials demonstrated the safety of DNA vaccines, it also revealed that they were poorly immunogenic. The immunogenicity of DNA vaccines has been improved through different methods; (1) improving the efficiency of DNA delivery to enhance the cellular uptake of the plasmid DNA; (2) the use of adjuvants either in physical form or encoded on separate plasmids; (3) optimizing the sequence of the DNA vaccine to enhance the expression and immunogenicity of the encoded protein. 66 DNA vaccines against a variety of viruses are now being tested at different stages of clinical trials. Advances in the methods of mRNA synthesis and stabilization have paved the way for the possibility of using mRNA as vaccine platforms. 67 The ability of mRNA to stimulate several of the innate immune receptors (eg, TLR3 and TLR7/8) gives them an intrinsic adjuvant activity. The approach has been boosted by the recent introduction of self-amplifying RNA strategy, which works by delivering the alphavirus genes encoding the RNA replication machinery along with the recombinant viral target antigen resulting in enhanced antigen expression. 67 3. Vector-based vaccines. Vectored-based vaccines could be considered a type of DNA vaccines where an attenuated virus or bacterium is used to introduce microbial DNA to host cells. The most commonly used virus vectors are adenoviruses, alphaviruses, and poxviruses. 68 As for bacteria, strains belonging to Bacillus Calmette-Guerin, Listeria monocytogenes, and Salmonella typhi are being tested as vectors for human vaccines. 69 ",

Examples for challenging viruses are HIV, HCV, [70] [71] [72] RSV, CMV, 73 HSV-2, 74,75 EBV, and dengue. For a variety of reasons, developing an effective vaccine against these viral pathogens has been a formidable task despite the tremendous efforts. Great amounts of resources have gone into developing a vaccine against HIV, [76] [77] [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] but this mission has proved to be the most arduous so far (challenges and prospects are discussed later in the chapter). As for influenza, effective vaccines against seasonal and potentially pandemic influenza virus strains have been licensed. However, these vaccines (as discussed later in the chapter) do not offer broad protection against these rapidly evolving viruses. Vaccine candidates against RSV 84, 85 and dengue 86, 87 have now entered advanced stages of clinical testing (Table 15. 2). Emerging viral pathogens include Ebola, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), hendra, nipah, Marburg, chikungunya, lassa, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever, and zika viruses. Infections with most of these viruses are limited to certain endemic areas, which in turn make the decision of developing a vaccine against such viruses not an economically favorable one. However, in the wake of the 2014 massive Ebola outbreak that ravaged West Africa this perception could change. For Ebola, recent studies suggest that robust immune responses could be detected in convalescent patients, 88 indicating that developing a protective vaccine against this pathogen is doable. Indeed, many vaccine candidates have shown promising results in clinical trials. 89 Two of these candidates are ready for Phase 3 testing. 89 Other antiviral vaccines that are in advanced stages of clinical testing include vaccines developed against CMV and norovirus. 73, 90 Later in the chapter we will discuss the challenges facing developing a vaccine against HIV, influenza (universal), and RSV, and how recent technological advances could help in overcoming such challenges.",

The challenges that impede developing a vaccine against HIV stem from the following points: [92] [93] [94] 1. Like most RNA viruses, HIV viruses continually mutate and evolve leading to the emergence of new variants even within an infected individual. This necessitates that for any vaccine to be successful, it has to elicit an immune response with enough breadth to protect against such extensive diversity. 2. The correlates of protection against HIV infection are not well established. A common factor for viruses against which a vaccine has successfully been developed is that we know which immune effector mediates protection. Correlates of protection are usually defined by analyzing immune responses in individuals who have recovered from infection or showed less susceptibility to such infection. Complete recovery from HIV infection is not common occurrence, if at all. This is at least partially because the virus infects CD4 + T cells, which orchestrate the two arms of adaptive immune responses: B cells and CD8 + T cells.",

The dilemma stems from the ever-evolving nature of influenza viruses, which enables the viruses to escape preexisting immune surveillance. 106 Moreover, effective vaccines against influenza viruses work by eliciting antibody responses that primarily target the globular head of the HA, which is the most variable among virus proteins. 106 Therefore, it has been necessary to perform an annual revision of the antigens included in human seasonal influenza vaccines 300 PART | VI New Approaches for Needed Vaccines to ensure that they match the circulating influenza strains. Currently, seasonal influenza vaccines include antigens from three (H1N1, H3N2, and an influenza B) or four (H1N1, H3N2, and two influenza B) human influenza virus strains. The need for a broadly protective influenza vaccine is clearly demonstrated by the occasional failure of these seasonal influenza vaccines to control the annual epidemics of influenza viruses, which result in about 3-5 million cases of severe illness, and up to 500,000 deaths worldwide. 106 In a more serious scenario, influenza viruses cause occasional pandemics when an antigenically novel virus spills into the human population or when, as in the case of the 2009 pandemic H1N1 virus, an influenza virus that has ceased to circulate among humans for decades reemerges.",

Recent data suggest that conventional seasonal vaccines induced B-cell responses are dominated by those targeting the HA head region. 112 Therefore, new immunogens would be needed to refocus the responses on those targeting the HA stem region. The use of immunogens comprised of globular head region HA molecules derived from viruses which have not been widely circulating in the human population, such as H5N1 avian influenza viruses, combined with a stem region that is conserved among the strains can change the dominant immune response from head focused to stem focused. 112 The globular head region of H5 is significantly different from the circulating human viruses while the stem region is largely conserved. The idea is to engage stem-specific memory B cells with minimal interference of the head specific ones. While this strategy did indeed succeed in boosting the stem-specific responses, questions regarding whether this boost is enough to afford protection in vivo are yet to be addressed. 112 In addition, further boosting with H5 in the aforementioned trial restored the globular head immunodominance of B-cell responses suggesting that the globular head region might be intrinsically more immunogenic than its stem counterpart. Similar to HIV, efforts are now focused on designing structure-based immunogens that present the broadly neutralizing epitopes (those within the HA stem and the within the receptor-binding domain) to the immune system in the most relevant conformation.

Vaccine-enhanced disease: This phenomenon was first noted when a formalin-inactivated vaccine candidate (FI-RSV) was developed and tested in infants and children in the late 1960s and the immunogenicity results were promising. 118, 122 However, upon natural RSV infection, 80% of the FI-RSVvaccinated subjects were hospitalized, whereas only 5% of the control group required admission, and two children died. 118, 122 2. The formidable task of getting the right balance between vaccine safety and immunogenicity/efficacy especially in the most vulnerable and highest priority target population, infants. 1 3. The lack of ideal animal models making clinical trails-which are expensive and time consuming-an imperative measure to assess candidate vaccines. Additionally, the clinical endpoints in evaluating an RSV vaccine efficacy are not very specific as the disease symptoms are shared with many other respiratory viral infections. 1 Based on the epidemiology and burden of RSV disease there are four target populations for RSV vaccination; (1) infants (<6 months); (2) children (6-24 months); (3) pregnant women; (4) the elderly. 117, 118 Each of these populations presents its own challenges in terms of how their immune systems respond to various vaccine candidates. There are several types of RSV vaccines that have been developed and many others are in the pipeline (Fig. 15.3) . Many of these vaccines are still in the preclinical stage. Four types of vaccine platforms are being tested in Phase 1, 2, or 3 trials (Fig. 15 .3); live attenuated virus vaccines; particle-based vaccines (VLPs); subunit vaccines; and vector-based vaccines. 123 Each of these vaccine platforms has advantages and disadvantages, 117,118 but they mostly share that they focus on eliciting antibody response to RSV F glycoprotein. 123 Palivizumab, which is a humanized mAb specific to the F glycoprotein, is a proof of principle that neutralizing antibodies could provide protection against hospitalization. 124, 125 Palivizumab is licensed to be used in infants at high risk of severe disease. 124, 125 Recently, the structural insights gained by solving the atomic structure of the pre-and postfusion forms of the F proteins have invigorated RSV vaccine development efforts. [126] [127] [128] [129] [130] We now know that many of the neutralizing F-specific antibodies that did not bind the postfusion form of the F protein are actually specific to the prefusion form. Moreover, a novel antigenic site, termed \u00d8, was revealed. Antibodies targeting this epitope show a more potent neutralization capacity compared to palivizumab. 1 The efforts are now focused on preparing physically stable vaccine candidates comprised of the native F protein trimer in its prefusion form. 131 ",

            "text": "There are multiple factors that contribute to the lack of a licensed protective vaccine against any particular virus. Most of these factors originate from the nature of the virus itself. Examples include: (1) viruses that exhibit extensive genetic variations (eg, influenza); (2) viruses that evolved multiple mechanisms for evading host immune detection and response (eg, HCV and HSV); (3) viruses that integrate their genomes in that of the host (eg, HIV); (4) viruses that are capable of developing latency (HSV). Some factors stem from the inability of the host to protect against infection (and reinfection) due to the inadequacy of the immune response (eg, RSV). Other factors that are unrelated to both virus and host include the lack of animal models that are suitable for evaluating the efficacy of vaccine candidates and economical considerations. Early antiviral vaccine success stories (eg, smallpox, rabies, and yellow fever) were based on empirical efforts in which vaccines were derived from either a live attenuated form of the virus or inactivated whole virus. It is clear that such approaches are not enough to address the current challenges. Developing an effective vaccine against many of the currently challenging viruses would require an integrative effort from scientists representing various disciplines. For example, public health studies would be needed to assess the disease burden in different populations in order to define the most vulnerable ones. Virological studies would be important for generating viral vaccine strains that lack immune evasion capacity, for example. Immunologists would define which arms of the immune response are needed to achieve protection. Bioinformaticians would need to work very closely with immunologists in order to transform high-throughput data and analyses into concrete, useful knowledge. Structural analyses would help in identifying important immune targets and how to rationally design immunogens that elicit maximal immune responses to such targets. Vaccinologists would then assess vaccine candidates in preclinical and clinical trials. Finally, engaging the pharmaceutical industry would be essential for scaling up the production of the final product.",

There are at least four different mechanisms by which anti-HIV neutralizing antibodies could block the virus. First, they can block the initial attachment of the virus to its receptor/coreceptor on the target cells. Second, they can block viral spread through cell-to-cell transmission. Third, they can aid in the clearance of infected cells through Fc-dependent mechanisms such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity. Fourth, anti-HIV antibodies could inhibit the passage of HIV-1 from the lumen to the basolateral pole (HIV-1 transcytosis). (Source: Adapted from Ref.[97].)",
