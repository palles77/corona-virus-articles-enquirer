In 34 (45%) patients, improvement of initial pulmonary lesions was associated with appearance of new radiological lesions at other sites. Nine (12%) patients developed spontaneous pneumomediastinum and 15 (20%) developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in week 3. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR of nasopharyngeal aspirates in 14 patients (four with ARDS) showed peak viral load at day 10, and at day 15 a load lower than at admission. Age and chronic hepatitis B virus infection treated with lamivudine were independent significant risk factors for progression to ARDS (p=0\u00b7001). SARS-associated coronavirus in faeces was seen on RT-PCR in 65 (97%) of 67 patients at day 14. The mean time to seroconversion was 20 days.",

A novel virus, the SARSassociated coronavirus, has been identified as the causal agent. [1] [2] [3] [4] The clinical, radiological, and other investigative findings at initial presentation have been previously described, [5] [6] [7] but the temporal progression is unclear. The routes and duration of viral shedding and the best clinical samples for diagnosis at different stages of the illness are also largely unknown. From March 24, 2003, a major outbreak of SARS involving 321 patients occurred in Amoy Gardens, a high-rise housing estate in Hong Kong. Epidemiological investigations suggested a point-source outbreak, which was linked to a faulty sewage system, initially contaminated by the excreta of the index case who visited the housing block on March 14 and 19. 8 The first 75 adult patients, belonging to 57 households, were admitted with a clinical diagnosis of SARS to one hospital. We did a prospective study on the clinical, haematological, radiological, and microbiological findings of these 75 patients over a period of 24 days, and correlated these findings with treatment 9,10 and with viral load in the nasopharyngeal aspirate to elucidate the pathogenesis and the impact of treatment. We report the usefulness of different clinical samples for virological diagnosis and its importance in transmission.",

We entered on a predesigned database the daily clinical findings based on history and physical examination, oximetric measurement, and haematological, biochemical, radiological, and microbiological investigations. We collected nasopharyngeal aspirates and clotted blood for virological studies from all patients at presentation and on day 14 after the onset of illnesses. Anteroposterior chest radiography was done daily for each patient. All chest radiographs were jointly reported by specialist radiologists and respiratory physicians. We did high-resolution CT of the thorax for patients who had apparently normal, equivocal, or atypical chest radiographs. For patients who developed acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with partial arterial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 ) to fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) less than 26\u00b76 kPa, 11 and recorded acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II) scores. 12 From 20 patients in whom SARS-associated coronavirus RNA was detected by reverse-transcriptase (RT) PCR in the initial nasopharyngeal aspirate samples, we collected further nasopharyngeal aspirates, urine, and faecal samples every 3 days. In 14 of these patients, quantitative PCR was done on the nasopharyngeal aspirates collected on days 5, 10, and 15 after onset of symptoms. The nasopharyngeal aspirates on admission were assessed by rapid immunofluorescent antigen detection for influenza A and B, parainfluenza types 1, 2, and 3, respiratory syncytial virus, and adenovirus, and were cultured for conventional respiratory pathogens on Mardin Darby Canine Kidney, LLC-Mk2, RDE, Hep-2, MRC-5, and fetal rhesus kidney (FRhK-4) cell lines. RT-PCR for SARS coronavirus was done directly on all clinical samples. Briefly, total RNA from clinical samples was reverse transcribed with random hexamers and cDNA was amplified with primers 5\u0408TACACACCTCAGCGTTG-3\u0408 and 5\u0408-CACGAAC GTGACGAAT-3\u0408. 3 For real-time quantitative PCR assays, cDNA was amplified in an SYBR Green I fluorescence reactions (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) as described. 13 Briefly, 20 L reaction mixtures containing 2 L cDNA, 3\u00b75 mmol/L magnesium chloride, and 0\u00b725 mol/L of the same forward and reversed primers as the reaction mixtures were thermal-cycled by a Light cycler (Roche, Mannheim; 95\u00baC, 10 min followed by 50 cycles of 95\u00baC, 10 min; 57\u00baC, 5 s; 72\u00baC, 9 s). Plasmids with the target sequence were used to generate the standard curve. At the end of the assay, PCR products (182 bp) were subjected to a melting curve analysis (65-95\u00baC, 0\u00b71\u00baC/s) to find out the specificity of the assay. The acute and convalescent sera were tested in parallel for SARS-associated coronavirus IgG, with SARS-associatedcoronavirus-infected Vero cells fixed in acetone in an indirect immunofluorescent format. We investigated blood, sputum or endotracheal aspirates, and urine bacteriologically, as clinically indicated. All patients had sepsis work up on admission and if fever recurred. Stools were sent for routine bacteriological culture, Clostridium difficile cytotoxin assay, and examined for parasites in selected patients.",

Week 1 was characterised by fever, myalgia, and other systemic symptoms that generally improve after a few days. The increasing viral load during this phase suggests that the symptoms are largely related to the effect of viral replication and cytolysis. As the disease progressed into week 2, the patients frequently had recurrence of fever, onset of diarrhoea, and oxygen desaturation. Strikingly, nearly half the patients had shifting radiographic shadows. If viralinduced damage was the primary pathological mechanism, such a flitting pattern of radiological change is difficult to explain. The timing of the IgG seroconversion, which starts on day 10, seems to correlate with falls in viral load, which occurs from between day 10 and 15, despite the use of pulse methylprednisolone. Severe clinical worsening also occurs at this time, which cannot be explained by uncontrolled viral replication. This finding is supported by the progressive decrease in rates of viral shedding from nasopharynx, stool, and urine from day 10 to 21 after onset of symptoms in the 20 patients who underwent prospective follow-up with RT-PCR. Taken together, these findings suggest that the lung damage at this phase is related to immunopathological damage as a result of an overexuberant host response, rather than uncontrolled viral replication. 20% of patients in this cohort progressed to the third phase, characterised by ARDS necessitating ventilatory support. Inevitably, several patients developed nosocomial sepsis during this phase of end-organ damage and severe lymphopenia.",

At the time of writing, no antiviral is reported to be clinically effective for the treatment of this novel coronavirus. Ribavirin has broad-spectrum antiviral activities and is effective for the treatment of fulminant hepatitis in mice caused by the mouse hepatitis coronavirus. 15 Although the inhibitory activity of ribavirin against mouse hepatitis coronavirus is weak, ribavirin can decrease the release of proinflammatory cytokines from the macrophages of mice. It also switched the immune response of the mice from a Thelper-2 to a T-helper-1 response. Thus, irrespective of its antiviral role, ribavirin may act as an immunomodulator. An effective antiviral agent is needed because decreasing the initial cytolytic damage and viral load in the first phase may in turn result in decreased immunopathological damage during the second phase. Since a notable proportion of our patients developed ARDS, the role of immunologically directed strategies, such as corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, IgM-enriched immunoglobulin, convalescent plasma, and the antitumour necrosis factor thymosin, deserve further investigation.",

            "text": "The presence of virus in the stool is an important finding because it suggests the possibility of oral-faecal transmission. The epidemiological investigation of the Amoy Gardens SARS outbreak suggested that the outbreak was caused by a faulty sewage system. 8 Diarrhoea seemed more prominent in our cohort of patients than previously reported, 3, 7 and the severe watery diarrhoea in these patients presented a challenge to health-care workers for infection control. Whether this apparent change in the clinical presentation is related to the difference in the route of infection or a mutation in the virus is still conjectural. Importantly, the mortality rate of 6\u00b77% we reported is higher than the previously reported figure of 3\u00b75% at day 21. 6 We noted the absence of a relation between the high rate of spontaneous pneumomediastinum unrelated to intubation and positive-pressure ventilation. This phenomenon is rarely reported in advanced cytomegalovirus pneumonia, 17 and influenza bronchiolitis, 18 whereas spontaneous pneumothorax is commonly reported in Pneumocystis carinii, and Staphylococcus aureus pneumonia. The initial radiographic lesions in SARS were pleural based. 6 In patients in whom the initial consolidation is abutting on to the mediastinum, adhesions and cyst formation might occur at the interface between the mediastinal pleura and the pulmonary pleura. Any rupture of these cysts will result in spontaneous pneumomediastinum. Alternatively, a diffuse peripheral pneumonic changes followed by pleural adhesion may occur over the parietal pleura of the chest walls, which leaves the mediastinal sites as the area in which rupture of cyst can occur. This will also create the necessary setting for spontaneous pneumomediastinum to occur without spontaneous pneumothorax.",
