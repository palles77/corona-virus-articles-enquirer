Thus, the prevalence and clinical importance of virus infections and the need for antiviral drugs differ from place to place and from time to time. National and World Health Statistics of notifications of disease give some index of the incidence of infections but not all virus infections are notifiable.

Early start of treatment of acute virus infections with existing drugs gives the best results and, where the clinical diagnosis is uncertain, accurate rapid virus diagnosis is of paramount importance. Many virus infections are asymptomatic or of trivial importance and without sequelae. However, new or improved antiviral drugs are needed for the prevention and/or treatment of a number of significant conditions caused by viruses which are not at present adequately controlled. These include upper and lower respiratory tract infections, influenza, chronic hepatitis, gastroenteritis, infectious mononucleosis, measles, rabies, haemorrhagic fevers and warts. Furthermore, such drugs might prove of therapeutic value in the prevention or treatment of virus-associated tumours, such as hepatoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, Burkitt's lymphoma, Kaposi's sarcoma and possibly carcinoma of the cervix. antivirals; vaccines; immunoglobulins 0166-3542/85/$03.30",

In many virus infections, clinical symptoms appear relatively late, and in some they only appear as viral replication ceases. Antivirals could only be of therapeutic value in those infections where symptoms and pathological changes develop in the presence of viral replication. However, prophylactic treatment of contacts is another potentially important indication for some infections. The clinical importance of a virus infection can be assessed according to rates of mortality, morbidity and the frequency of long-term sequelae. Thus, for example, the fatal outcomes associated with clinical rabies and herpes encephalitis confer on these infections an importance different from those of rhinoviruses. Prevalence of infection is highly variable and dependent on many factors, including population density and immune status, genetic susceptibility, geographical location, sanitation, virus virulence, and medical management of cases, with particular reference to quarantine and other procedures which prevent transmission. Clearly, the prevalence of an infection changes, as new vaccines are developed, and according to the success with which programmes for immunization and the control of vectors are implemented.",

For example, the proportion of cases of poliomyelitis with paralysis varies from 0.1% to 20% [36, 47] , infection with influenza may produce symptoms of a common cold without significant systemic illness, and the ratio of cases of rubella with and without rash is reported to vary between 1 : 1 and 1 : 6 [27] .

Mumps vaccine is licensed but is not recommended since it is not considered that the morbidity and sequelae of mumps infection are significant. Viral vaccines are either live or inactivat~ d. Measles, rubella, mumps, yellow fever and oral poliomyelitis vaccines are live, vaccinated subjects being inoculated with an attenuated infection, which elicits protective immune responses of long or life-long duration but causes few if any symptoms of natural infection. For all except oral poliomyelitis vaccine a single dose of vaccine constitutes a primary immunization course. Such vaccines are highly effective in developed countries. However, since they may be inactivated at temperatures above 10\u00b0C, the maintenance of a cold chain from manufacturer to vaccinee is of paramount importance.

Paccaud [29] comments that the world may be divided into two groupscountries with nationwide poliomyelitis vaccination campaigns, where the incidence approaches zero, and countries without such programmes, where the incidence is increasing. In the latter, improvements in living standards have been associated with delays in the age at which infection occurs, leading to an increased incidence of paralysis. Furthermore, in tropical countries, live vaccine has frequently been shown to elicit poor seroconversion rates, results which have been attributed to breaches in the cold chain, interfering enterovirus infections and/or inactivation of vaccine virus by antiviral agents present in saliva. However, a mass immunization programme was effective on controlling an outbreak of poliomyelitis within twelve days of its initiation [35] . Thus, the development of anti-poliomyelitis virus drugs seems of secondary importance to the implementation of aggressive poliomyelitis vaccination programmes using either live or killed vaccines.",

The rash appears on the 14th day simultaneously with the end of virus replication and the development of antibody. In developed countries measles is rarely life-threatening in immune competent children, but carries a significant morbidity mainly due to bacterial superinfection of the respiratory tract but also to an occasional (0.1%) case of encephalitis. High measles mortality rates are seen in malnourished children in tropical, developing countries and in children who are immune-compromised [19] . In the United States, health authorities aim to eradicate measles by requiring that all children attending school are immune as a result of previous natural infection or vaccination. During 1980 only 13 506 cases of measles were reported in the whole of the United States, in comparison with almost 150000 in England and Wales [2, 28] . In 1982 in the United States, and England and Wales respectively 1697 and 94 193 cases were notified. The measles vaccine uptake in the U.S.A. is over 90%, whereas that in Britain is about 50% [5] . The National Childhood Encephalopathy Study demonstrated that vaccinated children are 2.5 to 3.9 times more likely to develop encephalitis 7-14 days after vaccination than unvaccinated control children [56] . Nevertheless, the estimated 1 : 87 000 risk of encephalitis within 14 days of vaccination is significantly less than that associated with natural infection. It will be some time before western European countries approach the control of measles achieved in the United States. Anti-measles compounds would be of some value for the treatment of children in developing countries, for children with serious measles in developed countries, and for children who are immune-compromised. However, since virus replication ceases when the rash appears, early diagnosis and treatment would be critical. In addition, such compounds might be effective in the management of patients with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, a rare condition caused by persistent measles infection of the central nervous system which gives rise to progressive neurological dysfunction and death.",

They estimated that maternal and child care for 100 typical surviving children would cost over $2000 million [4] . Live vaccines which are safe and effective are available and with uptakes of over 90% in young children have reduced the incidence of congenital rubella in the United States [16] . However, so far, rubella vaccination programmes in Europe have shown little effect. The UK National Congenital Rubella Surveillance Programme documented 536 cases of confirmed or suspected congenital rubella during the decade from 1970 to 1979 inclusive [46] . Of these about 25% gave no history of illness, or contact and would not therefore have presented as candidates for antiviral therapy.

Influenza poses a greater risk to patients with chronic respiratory illness and other chronic diseases than to the normal population. The control of influenza by vaccination presents special problems because of the ability of infuenza viruses to recombine and to give new antigenic types which evade immunity generated by previous natural infection or by vaccination. Major antigenic changes preceded the worldwide pandemics of 1918, 1957 and 1968, while smaller antigenic changes have been associated with smaller outbreaks. While inactivated influenza vaccines clearly protect against infection with homologous strains, the propensity of wild virus to undergo antigenic changes makes vaccination against influenza a less certain and effective procedure than is the case for other viruses. It is generally recommended that vaccination be restricted to special risk groups [3] .",

Amantadine inhibits penetration of influenza virus (A strain) into host cells and has been shown in placebo-controlled trials to prevent infection with sub-types H iN1, H2N 2 and H3N 2. In therapeutic trials, amantadine has been shown to give more rapid recovery and to curtail the amount and duration of virus shedding [48] . Amantadine is also used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. It has not received wide acceptance as an antiviral agent, probably because of incomplete effectiveness, the occurrence of minor side effects, and the absence of activity against influenza virus B strains. In the presence of outbreaks of influenza A there is merit in the prophylactic administration of amantadine to high risk patients. In contrast, the advantages of its use in sporadic cases of influenza are less clear. Since illnesses caused by A and B strains are not distinguishable on clinical grounds, and rapid laboratory techniques to identify the causative virus are not routinely done, practitioners do not know whether an individual is infected with an A or B strain, or even with some other agent.",

The mortality rate is low (< 1%) and chronic infection leading to cirrhosis has not been demonstrated. As yet no vaccines against hepatitis A are licensed but short-term protection against infection may be achieved by administration of immune serum globulin, which is recommended for certain classes of contacts according to the degree of risk. Since clinical symptoms appear as virus shedding ceases, the development of anti-hepatitis A virus agents does not seem to be an important target.",

About 10% of patients develop a chronic carrier state, which may be either asymptomatic or associated with active liver disease. Patients with chronic infection may develop cirrhosis of the liver and primary hepato-cellular cancer [9] . In the United States about 15000 cases of hepatitis B infection are reported annually although it is estimated that only 10-25% of cases are notified [59] . In 1977, there were over 30 000 deaths from hepatic cirrhosis and 2400 deaths due to primary hepato-cellular carcinoma, of which respectively 11% and about 36% were attributed to hepatitis B [9] . The incidence may be lower in the United Kingdom, since in England and Wales only 5132 cases of infective jaundice were notified in 1980. The incidence of hepatitis B is higher in other populations (for example the Chinese) where infection early in life is frequent and followed by a significant incidence of primary hepatocellular carcinoma.",

Short-term protection against hepatitis B may be achieved by the administration of hepatitis B immunoglobulin, or alternatively immune serum globulin and is recommended for contacts. Human hepatitis B virus cannot readily be propagated in tissue culture or animals. Animal models of infection with related hepatitis viruses are being developed. Until now therefore assessments of the antiviral activity of test agents have been carried out directly in human subjects, monitoring virus markers of infection. The antiviral effects of interferon, adenosine arabinoside, adenosine arabinoside monophosphate, acyclovir, and combinations of some of these agents have been studied in patients with chronic infections [40, 44, 50, 52] . All these agents have been shown to affect markers of virus replication in the short-term. However, virus replication usually returns to pre-treatment levels once short-term antiviral therapy has been stopped. There are two important targets for antiviral therapy in this condition: to convert infectious carriers to non-infectious carriers, and to eradicate infection thereby preventing further liver damage and the long-term sequelae of cirrhosis and cancer.",

It has also been suggested that CMV may be an important factor in the immune suppression that occurs in acquired immune-deficiency syndrome (AIDS), a condition which may progress to Kaposi's sarcoma. The rationales for this suggestion are that more patients with disease have antibody to CMV than controls, that CMV infection is a suppressor of cellular immunity and that DNA and early antigens of CMV have been found in Kaposi's sarcoma cells [10] [11] [12] .",

Combined treatment with acyclovir and interferon was without effect in the treatment of CMV infections in bone marrow transplant recipients [23] , although in a placebo-controlled trial of interferon in the prevention of CMV infections in renal transplant recipients, patients receiving interferon had fewer clinical signs of CMV infection (interferon 1 of 20 patients, placebo 7 of 22 patients; P = 0.03) [15] .",

The illness starts as a cold, followed by fever and shortness of breath. The occurrence of unusually severe illness at a time when maternal circulating antibody is still present, suggests that IgG-antibody sensitizes tissues to damage by viral invasion. Infants, who received an experimental inactivated vaccine, also developed a particularly severe respiratory illness following infection. The mechanism for this may be the same as that underlying more severe disease in children with maternal IgG, but may also be related to the fact that, during the inactivation of the vaccine, a particular antigen (the fusion protein) had been destroyed [22] .

In developed countries infections are rarely fatal, since dehydrated patients are given adequate and timely hospital care. Nevertheless, viral gastroenteritis is second in frequency only to the common cold among illnesses affecting US families. Techniques are available for rapid identification of rotavirus in faeces.

Certain points are worth stressing. Antiviral drugs are unlikely to be of value in treatment, if symptoms only appear with the cessation of virus replication but drugs may be useful in the prevention of infections in contacts. For the vast majority of infections, early treatment is important if it is to be useful. Early treatment demands early diagnosis, either clinically based upon pathognomonic symptoms and signs, or by rapid viral diagnostic techniques. With the availability of specific antiviral compounds, the latter will assume greater importance. Although vaccines or other measures may be highly effective in preventing many infections, it should be remembered that for the patient in whom vaccination is contraindicated or in whom prevention fails there exists an individual need for safe antiviral therapy. Table 6 lists viruses and the availability of vaccines, specific immunoglobulins and licensed antiviral drugs for their prevention and treatment. Of the 14 viruses shown, no preventative or therapeutic agents are available against six. Vaccines have been licensed for the prevention of six, and specific antiviral drugs against only three infections. There are clear needs for new or better agents for the treatment and prevention of rhinovirus, influenza, respiratory syncytial and other respiratory viruses, hepatitis B, Epstein-Barr, cytomegalo-, rabies, human papilloma and rotaviruses.",
