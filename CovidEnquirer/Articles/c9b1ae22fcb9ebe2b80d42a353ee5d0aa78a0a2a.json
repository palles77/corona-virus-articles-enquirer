It was discovered for a second time in 1966 during the characterization of bradykinin (BK) degrading enzyme from kidney and this enzyme was named kininase II; it later was found to be the same enzyme as ACE. ACE2 was discovered in 2000 when two independent research groups cloned homologous ACE that could convert Ang I to Ang(1\u00c09) and yet also is captopril-insensitive [2, 3] .",

Somatic ACE possesses two catalytic domains (N-and C-domains) and a C-terminal transmembrane segment (stalk) ( Figure 29D .1). Somatic and testis ACEs in humans contain 1,306 and 665 aa residues, respectively. Testis ACE only possesses one catalytic domain. Both catalytic domains are zinc-metallopeptidase with the active motif HEMGH where the two histidine residues coordinate the zinc ion. The stalk anchors the enzyme on the membrane and is susceptible to be cleaved by shedding enzymes, resulting in plasma ACE activity ( Figure 29D .1). ACE2 is a chimaera protein with a single catalytic domain of ACE, and a C-terminal highly resembling collectrin, which may act as a chaperone protein to deliver other proteins to the brush border membrane.",

Several enzymatic assays have been developed for the measurement of ACE activity in plasma and tissues and usually involve artificial substrates such as hippuryl-His-Leu or N-[3-(2-furyl)acryloyl]L-phenylalanyl-glycyl-glycine (FAPGG), in combination with captopril inhibition. These methods were developed in mammals but were also extended to other vertebrates including birds, amphibians, and fishes [5] . However, these enzymatic methods may be erroneous because the enzyme specificity on the artificial substrates could be different. Lamprey ACE activities in different tissues were measured but captopril failed to decrease the ACE activities, indicating a possible nonspecific enzyme measurement. In amphibian, high captopril-sensitive ACE activities were found in gonad, intestine, kidney, and lung, moderate activities were presented in liver, heart, and skin, and low or negligible activities were observed in plasma, muscle, and erythrocytes.",

ACE is under promoter regulation by hypoxia-inducing factor 1\u03b1 (HIF-1\u03b1), which upregulates the ACE expression under hypoxic conditions, resulting in an increase in Ang II concentration. Under hypoxia, ACE2 will be downregulated but it was shown that it is indirectly controlled by Ang II, but not HIF-1\u03b1 [6] . Testis ACE expression control is highly specific and regulated by a tissue-specific promoter located immediately 259 bp of the transcription start site, which is frequently used in testis-specific overexpression studies. Hypoxia induced by high temperature decreased gill ACE activity but had no effect on kidney in carp. Promoters of ACE2 from mammals, amphibians, and teleosts drive specific expression in the heart. Cis-element search results discovered WGATAR motifs in all putative ACE2 promoters from different vertebrates, suggesting a possible role of GATA family transcriptional factors in ACE2 expression regulation.",

The snake venom peptides were further studied to produce the first orally active form, captopril, that lowers the blood pressure of essential hypertensive patients [7] . The most common side effects of captopril are cough, skin rash, and loss of taste, and therefore derivatives such as enalapril, lisinopril, and ramipril were developed with fewer side effects. After the discovery of N-and C-domains of ACE, specific domain inhibitors were developed to increase specificity. Ang I is mainly hydrolyzed by the C-domain in vivo but BK is hydrolyzed by both domains. By developing a C-domain selective inhibitor (RXPA380) some degradation of BK by the N-domain would be permitted and this degradation could be enough to prevent accumulation of excess BK causing angioedema [8] .",

ACE also acts on other natural substrates including encephalin, neurotensin, and substance P. Besides being involved in blood pressure control, ACE possesses widespread functions including renal development, male fertility, hematopoiesis, erythropoiesis, myelopoiesis, and immune responses [1] . ACE2 can convert Ang II to Ang(1\u00c07), thereby reducing the concentration of Ang II and increasing that of Ang(1\u00c07). ACE2 can also convert Ang I to Ang(1\u00c09), which is subsequently converted into Ang(1\u00c07) by ACE. The high expression of ACE2 favors the balance of Ang(1\u00c07) over Ang II, which accounts for the cardioprotective role of ACE2 via the Ang(1\u00c07)/Mas signaling pathway [9] .",

Although mice with testis ACE deficiency mate normally and their sperm quantity and motility are no different from those of wild-type mice, the survival of sperm in the oviduct and fertilization rate are highly reduced [1] . Overexpression of ACE2 in hypertensive models, but not in normotensive animals, reduced blood pressure.

ACE2 was identified as the receptor for SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) coronavirus. SARS virus binding downregulates the cellular expression of ACE2, and the binding induces clathrin-dependent internalization of virus/receptor (SARS/ACE2) complex. Not only has ACE2 facilitated the invasion of SARS virus for rapid replication, but also ACE2 is depleted from the cell membrane and therefore the damaging effects of Ang II are enhanced, resulting in acute deterioration of lung tissues.",
