            "text": "Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is an economically significant animal disease because of the speed of its transmission. The current FMD vaccine provides no protection until 7 days after the vaccination, which reduces its effectiveness in the case of an outbreak. Therefore, to find an alternative method of applying antiviral agents for rapid and enhanced inhibition of the FMD virus (FMDV), we compared the antiviral effects of promising antiviral agents and attempted to apply them in combination. First, we measured and compared the 50% effective concentration (EC 50 ) to the mean inhibition effects of FMDV, and the 50% cytotoxic concentration (CC 50 ) to the mean cytotoxicity of antiviral agents such as ribavirin, guanidine-hydrochloride (guanidine-HCl), 6-azauridine, and recombinant adenovirus expressing three small interference RNAs (Ad-siRNA) or porcine interferon-a (Ad-porcine IFN-a) in swine kidney cells (IBRS-2). The selectivity indices of ribavirin (35.2) and 6-azauridine (34.6) were higher than that of guanidine-HCl (26.9). The selectivity indices of Ad-siRNA or Ad-porcine IFN-a were 7 \u00c2 10 3 or 7 \u00c2 10 4 based on the adenoviral titer. Next, we tested the combined effects of the FMDV inhibition agents. Enhanced inhibition effects were observed in the IBRS-2 cells and in suckling mice from the combination of Ad-porcine IFN-a and Ad-siRNA or ribavirin. The combined application of these recombinant adenoviruses and ribavirin may enhance their inhibitory effect on FMDV and overcome FMDV resistance against antiviral agents.",

            "text": "Foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) is a highly contagious disease that affects cloven-hoofed animals such as cattle, swine, and sheep (Pereira, 1981) . The ability of the FMD virus (FMDV) to spread rapidly in susceptible animals has led to FMD being considered a disease serious enough to be listed by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) . FMDV belongs to the genus Aphthovirus in the family Picornaviridae (Bachrach, 1968) . The virus genome is an 8.5-kb, positive-sense single-stranded RNA containing one open reading frame. There are 7 serotypes: A, O, Asia1, C, SAT1, SAT2, and SAT3; moreover, numerous subtypes have evolved within each serotype (Knowles and Samuel, 2003; Domingo et al., 2003) . The use of current FMD vaccines to induce early protection is limited because protection cannot take effect until 7 days after the vaccination (Golde et al., 2005) . Therefore, an alternative method of applying antiviral agents is required to reduce the spread of FMDV in outbreak situations. Guanidine-hydrochloride (guanidine-HCl), ribavirin, interferon (IFN), and small interference RNA (siRNA) have been proposed as promising antiviral agents with different mechanisms. However, their inhibition effects on FMDV have not been evaluated although they have different antiviral efficiency. Furthermore, treatment with individual antiviral agents does not lead to perfect inhibition because of limitations related to viral resistance.",

Guanidine-HCl inhibits the replication of picornaviruses such as FMDV and poliovirus. Ribavirin has antiviral effects against a broad range of viruses, including FMDV, by inhibition of RNA-capping activity or viral polymerase, and by increasing mutation frequency (Graci and Cameron, 2006) . A broad-spectrum anti-metabolite, 6-azauridine inhibits virus replication (Rada and Dragun, 1977) . It has been reported that 6-azauridine effectively inhibits RNA viruses such as Chikungunya virus, Semliki Forest virus, and human coronavirus at low concentration (Briolant et al., 2004; Pyrc et al., 2006) . However, it has not been reported whether 6-azauridine effectively inhibits FMDV. Recombinant adenovirus expressing porcine IFN-a induces high levels of biologically active IFN in cell supernatants and has antiviral effects against FMDV in cells, and the protection lasts for 3-5 days in swine inoculated with the adenovirus (Chinsangaram et al., 2003) . RNA interference (RNAi), which causes gene silencing in a sequence-specific manner, is mediated by short hairpin RNA. Recently, researchers reported the inhibition of FMDV replication using plasmids or adenovirus expressing RNAi (Chen et al., 2006 (Chen et al., , 2004 Kahana et al., 2004) . We have reported significant antiviral effects against FMDV by adenovirus expressing multiple siRNA targeting non-structural protein genes (Kim et al., 2010) . The multiple siRNA enhanced antiviral efficiency and had antiviral effects against 7 FMDV serotypes.",

Ribavirin and guanidine-HCl have been reported for application in cases of FMDV (Black and Brown, 1969; de la Torre et al., 1987) , while 6-azauridine has not. We reported previously that recombinant adenovirus expressing three different siRNA sequences targeting the non-structural protein regions 2B and 3C (Ad-siRNA) significantly inhibits FMDV replication (Kim et al., 2010) . To produce Ad-porcine IFN-a, the porcine IFN-a1 gene (GenBank accession number NM_214393) was synthesized by Bioneer Corp. (Republic of Korea) and cloned into a pENTR\u2122/SD-TOPO cloning vector (Invitrogen, USA). Recombinant human adenovirus was produced according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly, we performed a recombination reaction using a pENTR\u2122/SD-TOPO construct (Invitrogen), pAd/CMV/V5-DEST\u2122 Gateway Vector (Invitrogen), and Gateway LR Clonase\u2122 Enzyme Mix (Invitrogen), and 293A cells were transfected with the adenovirus constructs digested with PacI using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). When approximately 80% cytopathic effect (CPE) was observed, the adenovirus was harvested. The harvested virus was purified using a ViraBind Adenovirus Miniprep Kit (Cell Biolabs, Inc., USA). Adenovirus stock of 10 8 -10 9 TCID 50 /mL was used for the experiment.",

These antiviral agents have different mechanisms for virus inhibition. Ribavirin is a mutagenic nucleoside analogue that is converted to its triphosphate form by cellular enzymes. Recently, the lethal mutagenesis of FMDV by ribavirin was analyzed on a molecular basis (Ehrenfeld et al., 2010; Perales et al., 2011) . The study reported that ribavirin leads to lethal mutagenesis by accelerating the occurrence of AU-rich mutant clouds during the early replication stage, and not by increasing viral mutation rate. Guanidine-HCl blocks the ATPase activity of nonstructural protein 2C, a protein involved in poliovirus replication (Saunders et al., 1985) . Type I IFNs, IFN-a and IFN-b, lead to the expression of genes that have antiviral activity (Der et al., 1998) . Researchers have reported that treatment with IFN-a inhibited FMDV in cells, and the process is involved with IFN a/b-stimulated genes (ISGs), 2 0 -5 0 oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) and double-stranded RNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) (Chinsangaram et al., 2001 (Chinsangaram et al., , 1999 .

Ad-porcine IFN-a was administered 24 h before FMDV infection and ribavirin was administered 6 h before FMDV infection except for combination group 2 (A and C). Combination group 2 received a mixture of Ad-porcine IFN-a and ribavirin 24 h before FMDV infection. Combination group 1 received 1 \u00c2 10 7 TCID 50 each of Ad-porcine IFN-a and Ad-siRNA (B and D). Combination group 2 received 2 \u00c2 10 7 TCID 50 each of Ad-porcine IFN-a and Ad-siRNA. Suckling mice were challenged with 125 LD 50 (A and B) or 250 LD 50 (C and D) FMDV (O/SKR/2002). Animals were monitored for 7 days. silencing is caused by siRNA in a sequence-specific manner and leads to the inhibition of virus replication. Our group has reported that adenovirus expressing three different siRNAs targeting nonstructural protein genes in the 2B or 3C regions possess enhanced and broad antiviral effects against FMDV (Kim et al., 2010) .",

The combination of Ad-porcine IFN-a with 6-azauridine did not demonstrate as much enhanced antiviral effect as the individual Ad-porcine IFN-a or 6-azauridine treatments did. The reason the Ad-porcine IFN-a and 6-azauridine combination did not have an additive inhibition effect is not clear.

            "text": "The combination of 100 TCID 50 Ad-porcine IFN-a and ribavirin, except at high concentration (500 lM ribavirin), did not lead to an enhanced antiviral effect, whereas the single adenovirus treatment did (Fig. 2B) . The reason might be the combination of the high-dose recombinant adenovirus and ribavirin. The combination of ribavirin and human IFN-a protein is a common treatment method for human hepatitis C (Bhagani, 2011) . Therefore, we suggest that ribavirin might interfere with the expression of porcine IFN-a in the recombinant adenovirus, or a part of ribavirin might inhibit the adenovirus. A previous study reported that ribavirin had antiviral effects on adenoviruses (Lenaerts and Naesens, 2006) . However, the mechanism of ribavirin against adenovirus and its antiviral effect on recombinant adenovirus is not clear because several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the antiviral activity. Due to this possibility, we compared the simultaneous inoculation of Ad-porcine IFN-a and ribavirin, and sequential inoculation, where ribavirin treatment followed adsorption of Ad-porcine IFN-a (Fig. 4) . The sequential inoculation of Ad-porcine IFN-a and ribavirin at 24 and 6 h, respectively, before FMDV infection was more effective than their simultaneous inoculation. The result was consistent with the results of Perales et al. (Perales et al., 2009) . Sequential treatment with ribavirin and guanidine-HCl was more effective than the simultaneous combination treatment. Therefore, we carried out the sequential or simultaneous injection of Ad-porcine IFN-a and ribavirin in suckling mice to expand the examination to animals ( Fig. 5A and 5C ). The effects of the antiviral agents and their combination were also demonstrated in the animal experiment (Fig. 5) . We demonstrated that the mixture of Ad-porcine IFN-a and Ad-siRNA or ribavirin had a positive effect on FMDV inhibition, and that the effect of 1 antiviral did not interfere with that of the other in vivo. The survival rate of Ad-siRNA was higher than that of Ad-porcine IFN-a in the same titer in 125 LD 50 and 250 LD 50 , although the selectivity index of Ad-porcine IFN-a in IBRS-2 cells was 10-fold higher than that of Ad-siRNA (Table 1) . One possible reason is that the inhibition effect of multiple siRNA was higher than that of porcine IFNa. Another possible reason is that the inhibition effect of Ad-porcine IFN-a was enhanced by the stimulation of IFN pathway-related genes in porcine kidney cells (Chinsangaram et al., 2003 (Chinsangaram et al., , 1999 , and that the gene stimulation might not have taken place because the suckling mice model lacks IFN responses (Ryman et al., 2000) . The survival rate of combination group 1, treated with Ad-porcine IFN-a and Ad-siRNA, was lower than that treated with Ad-siRNA alone, while that of combination group 2, treated with a mixture of single-dose Ad-porcine IFN-a and Ad-siRNA, was higher than that of single-dose Ad-siRNA. A possible explanation for this result could be that the antiviral effect is proportional to adenovirus titer, and the survival rate of the Ad-siRNA-treated group was higher than that of the group treated with Ad-porcine IFN-a in the same titer.",

Second, the combination treatment could maintain the inhibition effect for a longer period because the combination of antiviral agents could be advantageous to circumventing FMDV resistance and the antiviral agents might have varying half-lifes in animals. Furthermore, Ad-porcine IFN-a stimulates the genes related to antiviral effects as time progresses after the treatment, and has a direct effect by the porcine IFN-a protein (Chinsangaram et al., 2003) . Third, we suggest that their combination can reduce the quantities of single agents used to inhibit FMDV. Therefore, we propose that the combination of Ad-porcine IFN-a and ribavirin or Ad-porcine IFN-a and Ad-siRNA could be effective when used as an emergency or combination agent with vaccines in order to prevent the spread of FMDV. It could be a very promising method if the agent could start to take effect within 24 h and could maintain the antiviral effect until the formation of immunity by vaccination. Further study in a natural host would provide conclusive evidence.",

We suggest that the combinations proposed in this study: 1) Ad-siRNA with Ad-porcine IFN-a, or 2) Ribavirin with Ad-porcine IFN-a, may be advantageous in inhibiting FMDV because they have different mechanisms and activation times. Further study is necessary to test their enhanced antiviral effect in natural hosts such as swine, cattle, or goats, and against more FMDV strains. A combination ratio and injection dose could be determined in a natural host.",
