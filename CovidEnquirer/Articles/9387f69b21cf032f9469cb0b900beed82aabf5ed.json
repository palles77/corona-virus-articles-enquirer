The application of a rapid nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) assay for the detection of NLV RNA in stool is described using the NucliSens \u2020 Basic Kit. Primers and probes for the NLV Basic Kit assay were based on the RNA polymerase region of the prototype NLV, Norwalk virus (NV) genome and could consistently detect 10 4 RT-PCR detectable units of NV RNA in a stool filtrate. When compared directly with RT-PCR on a dilution series of NV stool filtrate, the NucliSens \u2020 Basic Kit assay was equally sensitive. Cross-reactivity studies with a representative panel of other enteric pathogens were negative. When applied to 15 stool specimens from NV-challenged volunteers, the NASBA Basic Kit application for NV detection yielded 100% sensitivity, 50% specificity, and 67% concordance, using RT-PCR as the 'gold standard'. Despite the specificity of the NASBA primer/probe sequences for NV, other representatives from both NLV genogroups I and II could be detected by the Basic Kit assay in outbreak stool specimens, although the results were inconsistent. Our results suggest that the NucliSens \u2020 Basic Kit assay provides a rapid and sensitive alternative to RT-PCR for detecting NV RNA in stool specimens. However, improvements in test specificity and primer design will be needed before the assay can be used routinely in the clinical setting. #",

These viruses contain a positive-sense, single stranded RNA genome of approximately 7.6 kb. Based on sequence information for the genes encoding the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the capsid protein, the NLV genus is sub-divided further into two genogroups: Genogroup I with Norwalk virus (NV) as the prototype strain, and Genogroup II with Snow Mountain and Hawaii virus as prototype strains. NLVs have been implicated in 96% of the outbreaks of acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis in the US documented by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) between 1996 and 1997 (Fankhauser et al., 1998) . Additionally, NLVs are a major cause of acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis in children and adults worldwide (Bon et al., 1999; Parks et al., 1999; Taylor et al., 1996; Vinje et al., 1997) . NLV outbreaks have been reported in communities, schools and day care centers, nursing homes, hospitals, recreational areas, cruise ships, military ships and bases (Fankhauser et al., 1998; Grohmann et al., 1991; McCarthy et al., 2000; Sharp et al., 1995) . These viruses replicate in the gastrointestinal tract of the infected host and are excreted in feces. Although food-borne transmission is most common, these viruses are also transmitted through fecal contamination of drinking and recreational water, as well as through contact with contaminated environmental surfaces and infected individuals.",

            "text": "Despite numerous attempts, NLV infections have not been induced in experimental animals, nor have these viruses been propagated successfully in cell culture. Diagnosis has relied historically on the observation of the 27 nm viral particles by electron microscopy (EM) (Glass et al., 2000) . However, because NLVs are shed usually in low concentrations, EM is frequently not sensitive enough to detect these viruses in stool. Early diagnostic tests for NV, developed in the 1970's and 1980's, were primarily immunoassays that required reagents derived from NV-infected human volunteers and were not widely available (Atmar and Estes, 2001) . The cloning and sequencing of NV in 1990 (Jiang et al., 1990) led to the development of new molecular diagnostic assays. Currently, the detection method used most widely for NLVs in stool samples is reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. The resulting RT-PCR amplicons are confirmed by probe hybridization or nucleotide sequence analysis. RT-PCR has proven to be an extremely sensitive method for detection of NLVs. However, this method has several drawbacks: the presence of amplification inhibitors in stool samples, the need to confirm amplification products to prevent false positive results, and the amount of time needed to complete the analysis.",

Studies have demonstrated that the isothermal nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) method provides a sensitive and rapid method for detection of viral RNA from human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) (Berndt et al., 2000; Fiscus et al., 2000; Segondy et al., 1998; van Gemen et al., 1993) , Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) (Brink et al., 1998; Cruz et al., 2000) , human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) (Blok et al., 2000; Witt et al., 2000) , human rhinovirus and enterovirus (Damen et al., 1999; Lunel et al., 1999) . This RNA amplification method utilizes three enzymes (reverse transcriptase, T7 RNA polymerase, and RNaseH) and two target specific oligonucleotide primers. The reverse oligonucleotide primer contains the bacteriophage T7 promoter sequence, while the forward oligonucleotide primer contains an electrochemiluminescent (ECL) tail that is used in the detection of the amplification product. The transcription-driven NASBA reaction amplifies theoretically the RNA target more than 10 12 -fold within 90 min. In this study, we report the application of a rapid NASBA assay for the detection of NV RNA in stool using the NucliSens \u2020 Basic Kit. This assay was compared directly with RT-PCR and used for the detection of NV and other NLVs in fecal specimens obtained from human challenge studies and NLV outbreaks. The NASBA assay described here was optimized for the detection of NV, and these NASBA primers and probes were not designed to be reactive broadly for other NLV.",

Each dilution was tested in triplicate on three different days, resulting in nine replicate tests per dilution. Consistent detection of NV RNA was possible for dilutions corresponding to 10 4 PDU/ml with very small relative standard deviations (0.1 \u00c1/0.6). As the concentration of NV was reduced to the equivalent of 10 2 PDU/ml, NASBA detection was slightly less consistent, with eight of the nine reactions giving positive amplification results. At this dilution, larger standard deviations were observed only in those instances where one of three samples in a run was negative for viral RNA. The detection endpoint occurred at approximately 10 1 PDU/ml. At levels of 10 0 PDU/ml and below, the NASBA results were consistently negative and had small standard deviations.

NV infection in these volunteers was also confirmed by ELISA for IgG seroconversion as described previously (Moe et al., 1998) . All five specimens that were positive by RT-PCR were confirmed by a positive ECL signal, yielding a test sensitivity of 100% when using RT-PCR as the 'gold standard'. The log 10 of these positive ECL values ranged from 4.82 to 5.56 with a geometric mean of 5.14. Five specimens that were negative by RT-PCR were also confirmed as negative by the NucliSens \u2020 Basic Kit assay. However, there were two volunteer samples (VT 23-1, VT 5-1) that were negative by RT-PCR but gave inconsistently positive results using the NucliSens \u2020 Basic Kit. These specimens tested negative in one assay but positive in another and can be considered true false positives because they were obtained from subjects prior to NV challenge. There also were three RT-PCR negative samples that gave consistently positive results by NASBA-ECL. The log 10 ECL signals for these samples ranged from 3.48 to 4.3, with a geometric mean of 3.97 that was more than one log 10 lower than the geometric mean of the RT-PCR positive/NucliSens \u2020 Basic Kit positive samples (5.14). Sequence analysis of the NASBA amplicons obtained from these three samples confirmed the pre- sence of the target NV RNA. Two of these three specimens (VT 23-8 and VT44-7) were collected from NV-infected volunteers at later post-challenge times (22 \u00c1/23 days post-challenge) than the other RT-PCR positive specimens from these volunteers (2 \u00c1/16 days post-challenge). We have detected NV-positive specimens at Day 22 post-challenge by RT-PCR in only two other infected volunteers (data not shown) indicating that viral shedding is possible during this time period. However, those specimens were not tested by the NucliSens \u2020 Basic Kit. The NASBA results for VT 23-8 and VT 44-7 suggest that the NucliSens \u2020 Basic Kit may be more sensitive than the RT-PCR assay. However, this statement is made cautiously because a third RT-PCR negative specimen (VT 3-5 from Day 4 postchallenge) that was positive by the NucliSens \u2020 Basic Kit assay was from a volunteer who had no indication of viral shedding by RT-PCR and who did not seroconvert. Overall specificity (using the RT-PCR gold standard) was 50% and concordance between the RT-PCR and NASBA results was 67%.",

Investigators have reported particularly good success using NASBA methods to quantitate HIV load in blood and plasma (Berndt et al., 2000; Dyer et al., 1999) . More recently, the technology has been developed for the detection and/ or quantification of HCV (Damen et al., 1999) , Candida species (Widjojoatmodjo et al., 1999) and the parasite Plasmodium falciparum (Schoone et al., 2000) , all in blood-based specimens. RNA sequences from Chlamydia trachomatis derived from urine and cervical scrapings (Morre et al., 1996) , as well as rhinovirus in nasopharangeal aspirates (Samuelson et al., 1998) have also been detected using NASBA approaches. To our knowledge, this is the first published report on the use of NASBA technology for the detection of an enteric pathogen in a fecal matrix. Overall, the NucliSens \u2020 Basic Kit method for RNA extraction resulted in highquality RNA extracts that were capable of supporting NASBA amplification with no further sample dilution. Because levels of infectious virus in patients during acute phases of viral gastroenteritis can approach 10 6 \u00c1/10 8 /g of feces (Kapikian et al., 1996) , the potential of this method for routine diagnosis of NV infection is excellent.",

The primers and probe set used in this study were intended to demonstrate the feasibility of NASBA amplification for the detection of Norwalk virus in stool, and were, therefore, designed to be specific for the G1 NV 8FIIa strain. Although we were readily able to detect the prototype Norwalk virus strain 8FIIa with these primers, they were relatively ineffective for the detection of other Genogroup I and II NLV strains collected from food-borne disease outbreaks. Even though these results were anticipated, this finding further supports the need for more broadly reactive primers to improve all nucleic acid amplification assays designed for the detection of this genetically diverse group of viral pathogens.",

For the NASBA assay, the NucliSens \u2020 Basic Kit RNA extraction method, based on the method of Boom et al. (1990) , was used as per the manufacturer's instructions. For the RT-PCR assay, we used two methods that work well in our experience: the heat release method and the Ultra-spec3 method. These different methods may explain in part the discrepant results from the two assays for a few specimens. It is well known that the sensitivity and specificity of nucleic acid amplification methods is affected by the efficiency of the RNA isolation method. For instance, Brink et al. (Brink et al., 1998) noted that the relative sensitivity of NASBA detection of EBV is more likely to be influenced by RNA isolation efficiency than by amplification efficiency. Others have shown that the effect of matrix-associated inhibitors on amplification efficiency is exacerbated at low levels of target template, yielding both false negative and false positive results (Jaykus et al., 1996) . Losses during RNA extraction may well account for the slightly poorer detection limits noted for both the RT-PCR and the NucliSens \u2020 Basic Kit methods described in this paper (Fig. 1) , when compared with the RT-PCR detection limits we have observed for dilutions of the Norwalk virus stock preparation. The Norwalk virus stock solutions used in this study were titered using a heatrelease RT-PCR method (Schwab et al., 1997) rather than the Boom et al. (1990) silica-based method followed by RT-PCR. The relatively high degree of false positive amplification results noted in the Basic Kit assay may also be associated with residual matrix components that serve as template for non-specific amplification and hybridization. It may be possible to improve both the sensitivity and specificity of amplification by using an alternative RNA extraction method, followed by amplification and detection using the latter two steps of the NucliSens \u2020 Basic Kit. Such an approach could facilitate further removal of residual matrix associated components and thereby improve the efficiency and specificity of subsequent RNA amplification.",

Furthermore, because the virus stock used in these experiments had been titered previously by heat-release RT-PCR multiple times, we have been able to establish an approximate level of detection when applying the combined RNA extraction, NASBA amplification, and ECL detection of the NucliSens \u2020 Basic Kit. The detection limit approximates 10 1 \u00c1/10 3 PDU per amplification reaction, which is very close to the detection limits obtained for RT-PCR. However, the ease of use and speed of detection supplied by the NucliSens \u2020 system provides a significant advantage over RT-PCR detection approaches.
