These outbreaks had the potential to sweep away economic and social structures whilst political and administrative functions collapsed, resulting in disorder of a degree not far from anarchy [1] . The last of these was the global disaster wrought by the influenza pandemic of 1918-1919 in which up to 50 million people died [2] . Since then, the late 20th and the 21st centuries have been characterized by a feeling of invulnerability induced by advances in medical science. The rapid identification of responsible organisms, increased availability of chemotherapy, more evidence-based therapeutic practice, and improvements in critical care, have engendered a feeling of profound complacency which unfortunately is entirely misplaced.",

This is unaffordable-even for the richest economy in the world-and excludes consideration of the setting required, and the numbers of sufficiently trained staff needed, to manage these critically ill patients [5] . In South Africa, an example of a developing country, there are approximately 2,560 ventilators in total, and an expectation that 99,000 would be required: this does not take into account the current HIV/AIDS epidemic, that these patients are likely to be sicker and will shed virus for longer, and the fact that ICU's presently run at capacity and frequently turn patients away.",

This means that if newer adjuvant technologies are unsuccessful or unavailable, production capacity can be divided by 12. This, together with delays in characterization of the antigenic structure of the virus at the onset of a pandemic, means that an adequate supply of specific vaccine is only likely to be available within 3-6 months of the onset of a pandemic.",
