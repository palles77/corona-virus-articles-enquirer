Beyond that, laboratory tests of viruses and related indicators in urine may be needed in some special patients of 2019-nCoV.",

In addition to well-known alveolar type 2 cells in lung, expression of ACE2 has also been investigated in liver cholangiocytes, esophagus epithelial cells and absorptive enterocytes of ileum and colon by scRNA-Seq [11] [12] [13] . These results demonstrated the potential utility of scRNA-Seq to unmask the potential target cell types of 2019-nCoV. Since the urinary system infection and its potential aftermath could be essential to the patient care during and after the infection, here we used two scRNA-Seq transcriptome data in healthy kidneys and one dataset in heathy bladders to investigate the expression patterns of cell types in the urinary system.",

The most common symptoms of 2019-Cov infection are fever and cough in most patients, with symptoms of chest discomfort, progressive dyspnea or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in severe patients. Acute kidney injury (AKI) has been reported in a small number of patients with confirmed 2019-nCoV infection. The laboratory findings of 99 patients infected with 2019-nCoV showed that 3 patients (3%) had different degrees of increased serum creatinine 9 . In another clinical observation study, 4 (10%) of all 41 patients, including 2 of 13 (15%) ICU and 2of 28 (7%) non-ICU patients, showed the elevated serum creatinine 10 . However, why and how the 2019-nCoV induced AKI remains largely unknown. In addition, whether 2019-nCoV can be transmitted through the urinary tract still remains a largely unanswered question. As ACE2 plays an important role in the 2019-nCoV infection, we aimed to identify the ACE2-expressing cell composition and proportion in normal human kidneys and bladders by single-cell transcriptomes in order to explore the possible infection routes of 2019-nCov and the roles of ACE2 in urinary tract system infection.",

In addition, the stroma and immune cells, composed of a small number of endothelial cells (CD34, PECAM1) and monocytes (CD14, FCN1, VCAN), were found (Fig 2B).

In the latest analysis about the clinical features of the cases infected with 2019-nCoV, renal function damage had been confirmed 9 10 and the continuous kidney substitution treatment (CRRT) are needed in about 9% of all 99 infected patients 9 . In addition, kidney injury and renal dysfunction had been seen in other coronaviruses associated with respiratory infections, especially two beta-coronaviruses (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) 20 21 22 , which are genetically similar to 2019-nCoV 4 8 . A previous study reported that 36 (6.7%) of 536 patients with SARS developed AKI and 33 of all 36 patients (91.7%) with renal dysfunction died finally 20 . Importantly, SARS -CoV fragments had been detected by PCR in urine specimens of some patients 23 . Furthermore, SARS-CoV persistent infection and replication had been observed in the kidney, particularly in tubular epithelial cells in vitro 24 ,indicating that the kidney damage in patients with SARS could be owing to the direct viral infection in target cells except for the consequences of the host immune response.",

Finally, though there has been no reports of positive detection of 2019-nCoV in urine up till now, the distributions of ACE2 in the renal system and its detection in urine samples of SARS patients hinted the importance of virus-testing in urine samples of 2019-nCoV patients.
