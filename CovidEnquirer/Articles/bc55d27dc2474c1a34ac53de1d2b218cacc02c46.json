While scientifically metagenomic analysis was established before the start of the era of high-throughput sequencing, the availability of the first second-generation sequencers was the kick-off for diagnosticians to use sequencing for the detection of novel pathogens. Today, diagnostic metagenomics is becoming the standard procedure for the detection and genetic characterization of new viruses or novel virus variants. Here, we provide an overview about technical considerations of high-throughput sequencing-based diagnostic metagenomics together with selected examples of \"virus discovery\" for animal diseases or zoonoses and metagenomics for food safety or basic veterinary research.",

As shown later in selected examples, various diseases of unknown etiology are caused by pathogens that were recently detected by novel technologies, namely, by microarrays or high-throughput sequencing. Regardless of the platform or the specific sample selection and preprocessing, an unambiguous association of the detected pathogen with the observed disease requires the fulfillment of Koch's postulates as he formulated them in a talk (Redactions Comit e, 1891) . Due to the problems that may arise in fulfilling these, a number of amendments of Koch's postulates have been suggested (Mokili et al., 2012) . Nevertheless, still the stringent criteria formulated in the late 19th century by Koch and coworkers are the golden standard. In some of the examples provided in a later section of the article and discussed in detail in the following chapters, Koch's postulates were fulfilled, showing that in veterinary science this important proof can be achieved.",

Even though a systematic assessment of the impact of the sample so far has not been conducted, published data imply this Pfaff et al., 2017a) . Moreover, it is logical that due to differing organ tropism of different pathogens different organs will be positive for pathogen nucleic acids. Noteworthy to mention that also the time point of sampling is crucial. Looking at the studies of Wernike and colleagues (Bilk et al., 2012; Hoffmann et al., 2012; Wernike et al., 2012 Wernike et al., , 2013 dealing with Schmallenberg virus (SBV), it is evident that owing to the short viremia sampling will yield genome copies only in a relatively narrow period and hence allow virus detection. Fig. 1 displays the impact of the pathogen content on detection probability. The plots on the one hand illustrate that at a certain pathogen load it is nearly impossible to fail with detection. On the other hand, Fig. 1 also shows that if the pathogen content is too low, astronomic datasets may be necessary for the detection. However, it is logical that the larger and more complex the dataset gets, the longer the data analysis to find hints at the potential causative agent takes. Although substantial efforts have been put into optimizing sample preprocessing for pathogen detection, the intention of all these is to bias the sequencing (Briese et al., 2015; Conceicao-Neto et al., 2015; Kohl et al., 2015) . However, this bias naturally comes together with information loss due to the selection of only a fraction of the nucleic acids, and this loss can render the analysis useless if the necessary information is lost.",

This variation clearly is a result of the organ tropism of the virus in quest. Therefore, analyzing a variety of sample materials might be necessary for success. As also shown in Fig. 2 , samples from different animals infected with the same viral species may have a greatly varying pathogen content, as depicted for a pair of rabies virus (RABV) infected animals (data taken from Hanke et al., 2016) .

Inter alia, characteristics influencing the choice of the most suitable sequencing platform are the read length, which is a major determinant of the reliable taxonomic classification, the runtime to complete an analysis, the possible size of the datasets, or the overall cost for an analysis. Fig. 3 and Table 1 show an example for the impact of read length on the sensitivity of detection. The original dataset (from Hoffmann et al., 2012) and the same dataset with shortened reads were analyzed using the software pipeline RIEMS (Scheuch et al., 2015) with identical settings and databases. It is clearly visible that longer reads are more readily classified than shorter ones.

This tolerance depends on the software workflow in use (Scheuch et al., 2015) . Of course, if the error rate rises too high, no sufficient sequence identity will be detectable and hence no classification possible. Finally, it has to be concluded that there is a tradeoff between read length and error rates that can vary depending on the availability of reference sequences with sufficient similarity enabling recognition of the pathogen. Of utmost importance are the potential inherent sources of contamination like carryover between runs or missorting of/mislabeling with molecular barcodes due to impurity of the barcoded adapters (Sigma Aldrich, 2017) used for deconvolution of the datasets. Such missorting is the likely reason for errors seen in the INSDC databases. For instance, Mukherjee et al. (2015) reported on integration of the PhiX phage into bacterial genomes of diverse families, even those that had never before been associated with PhiX. The authors report that 10% of the contaminated genomes had even been published in literature. By thorough analysis, they found out that the integration of the phage genome into the bacterial genomes was by missorting of the raw data, which included the used sequencing control sample into all datasets. Fig. 4 depicts another example of probable missorting and its result in the generated sequence. In this case, the Influenza A neuraminidase gene was assembled into a genome sequence of a bacterium taxonomically classified as Bacillus sp. In the respective genome assembly, also the Influenza A virus Hemagglutinin gene was included (not shown).",

Hence, although generally seen as a method that works without a priori knowledge because the starting point of the complete procedure can be true shotgun sequencing, regardless of the chosen type of nucleic acid, DNA or RNA, metagenomics heavily relies on a priori knowledge. Until we overcome the necessity that initial identification of the pathogen is based on similarity of the sequencing reads with known sequences available in the INSDC databases, we will not have a system that is independent of a priori knowledge and hence truly unbiased. This stresses the need for algorithms that can determine the source of a sequence with sufficient reliability solely based on low-level characteristics without calculating sequence similarities. On the one hand, novel optimized procedures like for instance Kraken (Wood and Salzberg, 2014) or Diamond (Buchfink et al., 2015) have the potential to speed up the classification. On the other hand, if it is possible to determine characteristics for classes of genomes (classified by higher orders like for instance a superkingdom), e.g., composition rather than sequencebased characteristics, this may help increase the sensitivity of detection.

On the contrary, all protocols including sample preprocessing will strongly influence the specificity of the overall process. All these procedures in the worst case will render detection of pathogens that are not in the focus of the preprocessing procedure nearly impossible.

Foodborne pathogenic bacteria like Salmonella, Listeria, or toxin-producing Escherichia coli strains, but also norovirus and Hepatitis A virus and parasites (Trichinella, Giardia) can cause disease outbreaks accompanied by vomiting and more or less severe diarrhea. For instance, a severe outbreak of gastroenteritis and the hemolytic-uremic syndrome caused by Shiga toxin-producing E. coli in Germany in 2011 mostly affecting adult women was likely caused be the consumption of sprouts (Frank et al., 2011) . In another case, frozen strawberries caused a norovirus gastroenteritis outbreak in Germany in 2012. Samples from this outbreak analyzed by real-time RT-PCR assay revealed a combination of three different genotypes that had not been reported in Germany so far resulting in the suggestion that the strawberries were polluted from sewage rather than from a single infected food handler (M\u20ac ade et al., 2013) .",

To systematically evaluate the suitability of shotgun metagenomics for the assessment of the quality of animal-derived foods and foods in general, we conducted a pilot study in which we investigated conventional food samples of animal or plant origin. We analyzed various untreated and highly processed food sample using our in-house metagenomics sample processing workflow. The investigated sample matrices included rocket, mushrooms, ham, salmon, meat loaf, cheese, oat flakes pizza, chocolate, oysters, strawberries, tap water, and parasite-containing wild boar meat. The used workflow starts with RNA instead of DNA extraction. In general, we could obtain RNA from all tested food products. The resulting concentration and especially the quality of the RNA obtained from processed food samples were clearly lower since their RNA content and integrity is inherently very low. Special matrices like fatty (e.g., cheese) and fiber-containing foods (e.g., oat flakes) were challenging and possibly need sample-dependent pretreatments, like defatting. Nucleic acids of samples with a low pH value (e.g., frozen berries suspicious to be contaminated by norovirus) are difficult to isolate and should be pretreated with a neutralization step.",

In a rocket sample, we found a novel yellows virus (0.3% of reads) that was only about 91% identical (at nucleotide level) to yellows viruses known from turnip and brassica. Meat loaf is an example of processed food in which we were able to detect a well-known pepper mild mottle virus (0.1%) that might cause different symptoms like fever or pruritus (Colson et al., 2010) . Interestingly, we discovered a novel mycovirus in untreated (mushrooms) and processed samples (pizza with mushrooms). This virus is only 35% similar (at amino acid level) to known mycoviruses; however, mycovirus sequences found in both mushroom samples are nearly identical to each other. In the examples mentioned here, the detected viruses are RNA viruses, which prove our RNAbased strategy to be very successful in shedding light on the virosphere. In addition, parasite-specific sequences matching the expected pathogens could be detected in wild boar meat containing parasites (trichina 0.02% and liver fluke 0.000002%). Thus, the used protocols seem to be applicable over a wide range of foodborne pathogens and food categories. Routinely applied for foodborne pathogens, resulting metagenomics data can be helpful for surveillance as well as foodborne outbreak investigation and will improve the hazard identification by increased specificity and potentially by a fundamental change in the definition of the hazard being rather a specific virulent strain, subtype, or gene instead of a not well-specified species.",

Whereas anthropologists already successfully analyzed ancient samples immediately after the early second-generation sequencers became available (Green et al., 2006 (Green et al., , 2010 Maricic and P\u20ac a\u20ac abo, 2009; Noonan et al., 2006) , researchers only recently started using shotgun high-throughput sequencing to systematically assess the pathogen content of historic samples available in museums or other collections and ancient DNA from archaeologic specimens. Systematic investigation of historic samples will not only help discover the diversity of the virome but will essentially contribute to the elucidation of viral evolution and the potential impact of vaccination on the evolving virome, for instance. At the moment, however, no reports on the analysis of historic animal samples have been published, but the studies of historic DNA samples are focused to human samples. For instance, in a recently published paper (Feldman et al., 2016) , the authors describe the analysis of an ancient Yersinia pestis genome. The DNA was recovered from a 6th-century skeleton, a putative victim of the Justinianic plague, found in a southern German grave. The authors were able to assemble a complete genome with high coverage. Their sequence analysis revealed a number of unique variants and some structural differences compared to the previously available Y. pestis sequences. In another report, Duggan et al. (2016) sequenced a complete variola virus genome from a 17th century child mummy from Lithuania. The authors were able to reconstruct the complete viral genome, which was found to be basal to all strains from the 20th century. The authors concluded that much of variola virus evolution and diversification occurred recently driven by the impact of vaccination. Another study published by Pajer et al. (2017) shed further light on the long-term evolution of variola virus. In their study, they report on the sequencing and analysis of two complete variola virus genomes from historic human specimens from a museum in Prague. Together these two studies provide a new level of insight into long-term virus evolution.",

Another example for the possibilities that high-throughput sequencing opens in this field is the work published by Toppinen et al. (2015) . They analyzed DNA obtained from bones of putative Finnish casualties from World War II for parvovirus B19 DNA. Interestingly, they found only viral genotypes that disappeared from Northern Europe in the 1970s or had never previously been reported to be found there. Moreover, using molecular clock analysis the authors were able to date the most recent common ancestors for all sequenced viruses back to the early 19th century. Noteworthy to mention that in addition to virus analysis, the obtained sequences also enabled tracing the origin of the casualties. The authors were able to show that one of the casualties was most likely of Russian origin. This highlights an additional facet of genome analysis using shotgun high-throughput sequencing. A similar approach was used for in-depth spatio-temporal investigation of arctic rabies viruses and their reservoir hosts in Greenland . The study explored virus dynamics over a period of roughly 10 years. The authors did not find a link between viral genotypes and the reservoir host population. All these studies together demonstrate the utility of shotgun high-throughput sequencing for investigations into virus dynamics and evolution.",

This encompasses the procedures from sample to sequence and the subsequent analyses of the generated datasets for the detection of the viruses. An important determinant of success is the selection of suitable samples and the sampling and sample handling and storage conditions. To this end, awareness must be raised as to the preservation of samples that are intended for metagenomic analysis. A common preservation is formalin fixation followed by paraffin embedding. However, this minimizes the prospects of success for sequencing-based pathogen detection. Moreover, since the complete characterization of viruses and their unambiguous connection with the disease imperatively requires virus isolates, native material must be available. Therefore, it is necessary to preserve samples by other means than fixation and embedding. Possible procedures have to be evaluated for their suitability and subsequently need to be validated on a range of samples. Finally, this will help improve the complete procedure of diagnostic metagenomics.",
