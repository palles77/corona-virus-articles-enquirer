The pGE374/viral recombinant vector generates a tripartite bacterial/viral protein composed of a segment of the RecA protein at the N terminus, the coronaviral sequences in the middle, and an enzymatically active /3-galactosidase at the C terminus. Rabbits immunized with such recombinant proteins generated antibodies to the MHV-A59 portion of the tripartite protein. Because the MHV-A59 polymerase proteins have been difficult to identify during infection, we used a novel method to demonstrate the viral specificity of the antiserum. The viral cDNA was excised from the expression vector, and transferred to a pGem vector, downstream from and in-frame with a portion of the cat gene. This construct contained a bacteriophage RNA polymerase promoter that enabled the cell-free synthesis of a fusion protein that was used to verify that antibodies were generated to the expressed viral DNA. This strategy was shown to successfully result in the specific generation of antibodies to the encoded information of the viral cDNA. Furthermore, this method has general applicability in the generation and characterization of antibodies directed against proteins encoded in cDNAs. PA 19104-6076 (U.S.A.) Tel.

            "text": "During infection of murine cells, coronavirus MHV-A59 generates at least four viral nonstructural proteins (Spaan et al., 1988) . These proteins, present at low levels in infected cells, are difficult to detect against the background of cellular proteins. Some of these proteins have been detected in infected cells and in the products of cell-free translation of viral mRNAs (Leibowitz et al., 1982; 1988; Skinner et al., 1985) . We have previously used a vector generating a tripartite protein containing RecA-viral-fiGal aa sequences to generate antisera against a nonstructural protein encoded in gene E of MHV-A59 (Leibowitz et al., 1988) . The MHV-A59 RNAdependent RNA polymerase is presumed to be encoded in gene A, the approx. 23-kb sequence at the 5' end of the genome RNA (Pachuk et al., 1989) . Cell-free translation of genome RNA has allowed the identification of a group of proteins, 28-and 200-to 250-kDa (Denison and Perlman, 1986) , which are probably encoded in the 5' portion of gene A (Soe et al., 1987) . The protein products of the rest of gene A have yet to be identified. We demonstrate here a method for the generation of antisera against the polypeptides encoded in the viral polymerase-encoding gene using a vector in which the viral segment is randomized by homopolymer addition (Uhich et al., 1982) and inserted between a truncated recA and the lucZ gene, to generate B/V fusion proteins as immunogens. Unique to our work is a method to verify the viral specificity of these antisera using second fusion proteins. The viral segments are inserted into a second plasmid in which the cut gene is upstream from the viral sequences and provides the ATG for initiation of translation. RNA transcripts are generated in vitro from a T7 bacteriophage promoter and translated in a reticulocyte-free system. These viral/CAT fusion proteins were used to verify the viral specificity of the sera raised against the RecA/viral/j?Gal B/V proteins. In this way, we have been able to verify the viral specificities of the antisera without knowing the identity of the polypeptides encoded in this gene. This method of veritication of the specificities of antisera will be applicable to other systems in which the protein product of an ORF has not been identified.",

Translation of the CAT/1533 RNA results in two major proteins. The larger 74-kDa polypeptide is the size expected for a CAT/1533 protein which would contain part of the N terminus of the CAT protein, 27 aa from the N terminus of BGal, as well as the coding information in the 1533 insert (approx. 450 aa). The smaller protein is the size expected for the CAT protein terminating at the recA/viral junction, probably due to the homopolymer sequence resulting from tailing. The major product of translation of the control RNA is a 24-kDa protein consistent with the size of the CAT/372 sequence. These translation products were immunoprecipitated with antiserum raised against the RecA/1533/Gal protein, to verify the viral specificity of the antiserum. The CAT/372 protein was a necessary control for the small amount of /IGal still present in the CAT/1533 hybrid protein. As shown in Fig. 5 Fig. 4 . Use of viral CAT/viral fusion proteins to determine the specificity of antiserum. The pGem4CAT vector was constructed by inserting 550 bp ofthe 5' end ofthe cur gene (including the ATG start codon), derived as a HindIII-Ban1 fragment, from the pRSV2CAT plasmid (provided by Dr. J. Alwine) into Hind111 + PstI cleaved pGem4 downstream from a bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase promoter. The 1533 viral sequences were excised from pGE374/1533 with NcoI (at the 5' end of the recA gene) and PvuII (in the la& gene) and inserted into pGem4CAT downstream from the car sequences and the T7 bacteriophage promoter. This fragment contained, in addition to the viral sequences, 82 nt of the IucZ gene. A control vector was constructed by insertion of the small N~~I-PwII fragment ofpGE372 into pGem4CAT. These recombinant vectors were linearized with Asp718 and transcribed using the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of 500 mM 'G(5')ppp(S')G. The template was removed with DNase I and the RNA recovered all as described by Krieg and Melton (1984) . RNAs (I pg) were translated in 25 ~1 of rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega Biotec) containing 10 units of RNasin, 25 pg of soybean trypsin inhibitor, 10 pg of leupeptin, and 10 yCi of [35S]methionine. Following a l-h incubation at 3 1 'C, the reaction was terminated by dilution into RIPA buffer. The viral/CAT fusion protein and the control pGE372 protein, synthesized as described in Fig.4 , were immunoprecipitated with pre-immune and 1533 antisera which had been concentrated by precipitation in the presence of 40 y0 ammonium sulfate. Immunoprecipitations were carried out as described previously (Leibowitz et al., 1988) and the resulting proteins were analyzed by SDS-7.5%PAGE (Maizel, 1971) . Lanes: a,protein M, markers (sizes in kDa in the lefihand margin); b, control protein analyzed directly; c, viral/CAT protein analyzed directly; d, control protein immunoprecipitated with preimmune serum; e, viral/CAT protein immunopiecipitated with pre-immune serum; f, control protein immunoprecipitated with 1533 serum; g, viral/CAT protein immunoprecipitated with 1533 serum. There are no bands observed in lanes d-f. protein immunoprecipitated the in vitro translation product of pGem4CAT/1533 RNA but not the control pGEMCAT/372. Thus, the antiserum must contain antibodies which recognize the viral sequences. The fact that the smaller protein derived from the CAT/1533 fusion does not immunoprecipitate, is consistent with our hypothesis that this protein contains CAT sequences but not viral sequences.",

(1) The strategy for insertion of foreign DNA into pGE374 requires no detailed sequence information to determine if a coding sequence is present in the fusion DNA. Statistically, ifthere are n ORFs out of the six possible ORFs for the insert, the ratio of LacZ' transformants to the total number of transformants is n/18. If there are N codons in a random piece of DNA, then the probability that in either polarity a contiguous ORF is present, is 2 x (61/64)? If N is greater than 110, there is less than a 1% chance that the ORF is the result of random occurrence. The 1533 cDNA (1.4 kb), inserted into the pGE374 vector resulted in a LacZ + phenotype in approx. 5 % of transformants, suggesting it contains a single ORF.",

Multiple copies of the vector and induction of the operon in the presence of mitomycin C contribute to the high expression. Identification of both the N-terminal RecA sequences and the C-terminal BGal sequences are easily accomplished (RE-SULTS AND DISCUSSION, section a; Fig. 3 ). This and the relative insolubility of the fusion protein make purification simple. (3) Because this system can be used for expression of relatively large fragments of DNA, the fusion protein is likely to display sequential and conformational epitopes when used as an immunogen.",

Therefore, the only assay for the sera available is the reaction with the products of cell-free translation of genome RNA, in which the first 7-8 kb, of genome are translated (Denison and Perhuan, 1986) . To verify the viral specificity of antisera made against polypeptides encoded in more 3' portions of the polymeraseencoding gene, the cat/viral plasmids were constructed. In vitro translation of RNA from the cat/1533 vector was used to demonstrate that the 1533 antiserum did contain virus-specific antibodies. This was verified by immunoprecipitation of the products of cell free translation of genome RNA (Fig. 5) . We have now demonstrated that this antiserum specifically stains infected cells by an immunofluorescence assay and immunoprecipitates several large proteins from infected cells (P.W.Z., J.L.L. and S.R.W., manuscript in preparation). This CAT/viral fusion protein assay will be even more important for antisera derived against proteins encoded further downstream in the putative polymerase-encoding gene (for example, 1033, see Fig. lB ), in which synthesis of protein from the genomic template in a cell-free translation system is not observed.",
