            "text": "Background & Aim: Recurrent Clostridium. difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD) is associated with a lack of protective immunity to C. difficile toxins. A paremeral C. difficile vaccine containing toxoid A and toxoid B was reported previously to be safe and immunogenic in healthy volunteers (Kotloff et al., Infect Immun 2001; 69:988-95) . Our aim in this stuy was to examine whether the vaccine is also well tolerated and immunogenic in patients with recurrent C. difficile associated diarrhea (CDAD). Methods: Subjects received four 50 microgram intramuscular inoculations of the C. difficile toxoid vaccine over an 8 week period. Serum antibodies to purified toxin A and toxin B were measured by EL1SA. Toxin neutralizing activity in sera was evaluated using the tissue culture cytotoxni assay. Results: Three patients with multiple episodes of recurrent CDAD were vaccinated. Two of the three showed an increase in serum IgG anti-toxin A antibodies (3-fold and 4-fold increases at day 70 compared to baseline) and an increase in serum IgG anti-toxin B antibodies (52-fold and 20-fold respectively). Both also developed cytotoxin neutralizing activity against toxin A and toxin B in their sera. Prior to vaccination the subjects had required nearly continuous treatment with oral vancumycin for 7, 9 and 22 months respectively to treat recurrent episodes of CDAD. After vaccination all three subjects discontinued treatment with oral vancomycin without any further recurrences. Conclusions: A C. difficile toxoid vaccine induced immune responses to toxins A and B and was associated with resolution of recurrent CDAD. This is the first reported use of a C. difficile vaccine in patients with CDAD. The results of this study support the feasibility of active immunization against C. difficile and its toxins in high risk individuals but must be validated in larger controlled trials.",

The aim of this study was to compare the effects of EPEC and C. rodentium on cultured murine 1EC, CMT-93. Bacterial adherence, actin rearrangement, inflammatory responses, transepitbehal electrical resistance (TER) and tight junction (TJ) morphology in response to EPEC and C rodentium were examined. The adherence of EPEC and C. rodentium to CMT-93 cells was comparable at ] h (7_ + 1 and 5_+2 xl05 CFU/well, resp, n=3, p=0.5) but was greater for EPEC at 3 h (141_+16 and 22_+2 x 105 CFU/well, resp, n=4; p=0.005). ME lesion formation by EPEC occurred by 1 h but required 3 h for C rodentium. EPEC and C. rodentium induced inflammatory cascades including nuclear tranalocation of p65, ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and PKC~ translocation within 1 h suggesting that the these responses are independent of A/E lesion formation. In fact, sterile supernatants from both pathogens stimulated p65 tmnslocation indicating that type IlI secretion is not involved. In contrast to human IEC (T84 & Caco-2), TER of CMT-93 monolayers was not altered by either pathogen unless centrifuged (5 rain at 46xg) onto monolayers. In this case, EPEC (-58 -+ 12% at 6 h; n=10; p<0.001vs controls), but not C. rodentium (+5_+15% @ 6 h; n=10; p>0.05), significantly decreased TER. The localization of the TJ proteins, as assessed by immuuofluorescence microscopy, was disrupted only in monolayers infected with EPEC following centrifugation, correlating with the decrease in TER. In conclusion, bacterial adherence, ME lesion formation, and disruption of the TJ barrier were significantly greater for EPEC than for C rodentium while the inflammatory responses by host cells were similar. Despite the genetic similarities of these pathogens, the functional alterations induced in host cells are significantly different. The variability in physiological responses exerted by these two pathogens on murine IECs suggest that caution should be exercised in extrapolating information regarding C rodenflum infection to EPEC.",

            "text": "The Clinical Application of Polymerase Chain Reaction to Diagnose Clostridium difficile in Hospitalized Patients with Diarrhea Michael S. Morefli Jr., Susan D. Rouster, Ralph A. Giarmella, Kenneth E. Sherman Background and Aims: Clostridium difficile is a common cause of diarrhea in hospitalized patients and is associated with significant morbidity and cost. The current diagnostic standard, enzyme immunoassay (EIA), suffers from low sensitivity, leading to repetitive testing and empiric treatment. We sought to demonstrate the utility and cost-effectiveness 0f polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of toxin B gene for diagnosis of Clostridium difficileinduced diarrhea. In addition, we analyzed the practice of physicians regarding testing/ treatment of Clostridium difficile compared to practice guideline recommendations. Methods: 148 stool samples from academic and community-based hospitals were sent for EIA testing and were prospectively evaluated for presence of toxin B gene by PCR. Results were compared to EIA regarding sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values with PCR serving as the gold standard. Likelihood ratios were calculated. Medical charts were reviewed to determine a) number of EIAs sent per admission b) number sent within a 24-hour time period and c) how caregivers reacted to EIA results. Results: Mean age of 130 subjects was 55 years. EIA/ PCR were positive in 6.8%/13.6%. EIA sensitivity was 40%, specificity 98%, and positive/ negative predictive values 80%/91%. The positive likelihood ratio for EIA was 25.4, and the negative likelihood ratio was 0.61. Cost of PCR was $27/sample and the total turnaround time for 10 samples was 7.5 hours. Empiric treatment for Clostridiam difficile was given unnecessarily in 40% of ELA-negatives. 30% of patients had 3 or more EIAs sent during hospital admission. Of patients with multiple samples sent, 57% had more than one sent in a 24-honr period. Conclusion: Many physicians do not conform to practice guidehnes regarding recommended diagnosis and empiric treatment of Clostridium difficile. This may be due to low confidence in test reliability. Toxin B gene PCR represents a more sensitive and potentially cost-effective method to diagnose Clostridium difficile-induced diarrhea than EIA and should be considered for use as an alternative diagnostic standard.",

            "text": "Exploration of the Role of Bismuth Thiols in Control of Bacterial Infection Associated with Biliary Stent Occlusion Hong]un Zhang, Jevon Tang, Xiangwen Meng, Jackie Tsang, Tat-Kin Tsang Background &Aims: Bacterial infection and biofilm formation on the surface of biliary stents are believed to be one of the main factors for the stent occlusion. The effect of long-terra prophylactic antibiotics and incorporation of some antibacterial agents into stents have not been proven to be satisfactory. This study aimed to explore the role of the new reagents, bismuth thiols, in preventing bacterial adherence and bacterial biofilm formation on the surface of biliary stents. Methods: A modified flow cell system was used, into which 10F, 7cm polyethylene straight stents were built. The sterile porcine bile that was infected separately with Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterobacter and Enterococcns was used as the perfusion medium. The bacterial growth in bile and bacterial adherence on the surface of stents was tested when 0mM, 5raM, 10mM and 20mM bismuth dimercaptopropanol (BisBAL) was diluted in the perfnsion medium. The amount of bacteria adhered to the surface of the stents as well as the amount of bacteria in each perfnsion medium were measured by using the plate-count method at 2, 6, 12, 20, and 24 hours time points respectively. Results: The results demonstrated that 5mM BisBAL did not inhibit the growth of all the tested bacterial species. They did, however, significantly decrease the amount of most bacteria adhering to the surface of stents with the exception of Eseherichia. coil 20ram BisBAL significantly inhibited the growth of Escherichia. coil, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Enterobacter, and thereby significantly decreased these bacteria adhering to the surface of stents. Conclusions: The results indicate low concentration of bismuth thiols present in bile may inhibit their adherence to the surface of biliary stentts and then retard the bacterial biofilm formation. High doses of bismuth thiols in the intestinal tract may erase the bacterial sources and prevent the infection by reflux. Since these unique bactericidal and antibiofilm properties of bismuth thiols may contribute to delaying the process of biliary stent occlusion, therefore they could be used appropriately on patients before and after the procedure of biliary stent placement. Cholera toxin (CT), Escherichia coh heat labile (LT) and heat stable (ST) toxins mediate intestinal secretion in part through an enteric reflex arc; this maybe via a direct effect on enteric nerves. We have shown previously that CT and LT, but not ST, induce neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells and enhance the neuronal differentiation effects of nerve growth factor (NGF). Method: cDNA microarray technology was used to identify early gene expression in PC12 cells induced by CT, LT and ST. The Affymetrix growth and differentiation genechip U34A was used for microarray analysis. Results: CT and LT induced a 17.9 and 6.5 fold change respectively, in expression of NGF-induced protein, an early growth response gene. NGF alone induced a 23.6 fold change in expression of this gene. CT + NGF and LT + NGF induced a 42.9 and 33.3 fold change in the expression of NGF-induced protein.",

            "text": "CT and LT induce a 17.7 and 8.5 fold change respectively, in expression of NGF-induced factor A gene. NGF induced a 17.1 fold change in expression of this gene. CT \u00f7 NGF and LT + NGF induced a 34.7 and 19.1 fold change in the expression of NGF-induced factor A. c/EBP related transcription factor and VGF nerve growth factor inducible genes were only upregulated in the presence of CT + NGF and LT + NGF but not by enterotoxin or NGF alone: fold changes in expression were 2.1 and 1.5, respectively. No significant change in gene expression was seen with ST. Discussion: In PC12 ceils, CT and LT induce upregulation in genes involved in neuronal differentiation. A synergistic effect of CT or LT with NGF occurs in some NGF-induced genes, supporting the phenotypic synergistic changes previously observed. New gene upregulation occurs when PC12 cells are exposed to CT or LT + NGF. These findings suggest that CT, LT and NGF have separate but synergistic effects on gene expression. Background: Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in solid organ transplant recipients. Tissue invasive CMV disease with negative antigenemia screening is not only a diagnostic dilemma, but can significantly increase patient morbidity. CMV infection is defined as the isolation of CMV virus or detection of CMV viral proteins or nucleic acid in any body fluid or tissue specimen. While culture, immunohistochemistry and/or detection of viral inclusion bodies in tissue are gold standards for diagnosing CMV infection, serology is only useful for detecting previous infection. As tissue biopsies can be time consuming and require invasive procedures, most centers rely on rapid serum antigen screening to guide patient management. The aim of this study was to ascertain the accuracy of serum antigen screening in transplant recipients with tissue invasive CMV disease. Methods: We retrospectively reviewed all cases of biopsy-proven tissue invasive CMV disease in our solid organ transplant recipient patients between 1998 and 2002. We recorded the T1793 Rifalazil Prevents Relapsing of Clostridinm difficile-Associated Diarrhea Anton M. Pauline, Efi G. Kokkotou, David Rothstein, Ciaran P. Kelly, Charalabos Pothoulakis Background and Objectives: Clostridium difficffe associated diarrhea and colitis (CDAD) is currently treated with vancomycin or metronidazole. However, 15 to 20% of patients relapse following discontinuation of therapy, and in some cases prolonged therapy with vancomycin is required. We recently showed that rifalazff (20 mg/kg/day for five days), a new rifamycin derivative, was equally effective to vancomycin in preventing and treating CDAD in Syrian hamsters. However, in contrast to vancomycin, rifalazff was associated with no relapses. Here we used the Syrian hamster model of CDAD to a) establish the number of days and dose of rifalazff needed to achieve a full therapeutic and relapse-free response and b) compare rifalazil and vancomycin in the treatment of relapsing CDAD following vancomycin treatment. Methods: Golden Syrian hamsters (100-125g) were injected s.c. with clindamycin phosphate (10 mg/kg) followed, 24 hrs later, by C. difficffe garage (105 CFU). After 24 hrs hamsters (5-8 per group) were administered by gavage either vehicle or rifalazil daffy for 1,2,3,4 or 5 days. To model relapsing CDAD, we administere~t vancomycin (50 mg/kg), rifalazil (2 mg/kg) or saline by garage for 5 days beginning one week after an initial 5 day course of vancomycin in challenged hamsters. Results: While 100% of vehicle-administered animals became moribund from CDAD 2 days after C. difficffe gavage, none of the rifalazil (20 mg/ kg/day)-treated animals showed signs of CDAD up to 30 days after discontinuation of treatment. Time-course experiments indicate that at 20 mg/kg/day of rifalazil, 5 days of treatment are required to obtain a full therapeutic and relapse-free response. Dose-response studies using 20, 10, and 2 mg/kg/day indicate that doses of rifalazil as low as 2 mg/kg/ day are effective in treating CDAD in hamsters. In the relapsing CDAD model, 50% of salinetreated control hamsters were euthanized for severe CDAD 10-15 days after discontinuation of vancomycin treatment. In contrast, none of the animals that received either vancomycin or rifalazff developed fatal CDAD. However, the rifalazil-treated animals gained weight at a significantly higher rate than vancomycin-treated hamsters (p<0.018) during the 34 day Course of the study. This indicates greater protection against mild recurrent CDAD in the rifalazff group. Conclusions: Our results indicate that low doses of rifalazff may be superior to vancomycin for prevention and treatment of relapsing CDAD. Supported by a grant from AetivBiotics, Inc., Lexington, MA development in an in vitro model of infection. Yet in a mouse model of C parvum infection, no difference was found in either the course or severity of infection between wild-type and TNF~x knockout mice. Though TNFa does not appear to be essential for recovery, many questions remain unanswered. For instance could the role of TNFc\u00a2 be predominantly proinflammatory rather than linked to parasite dearance or could TNFa be a 'redundant' entity in the presence of other cytokines such as 1FN'y, a crucial cytokine for the clearance of this parasite in vivo. Methods: Small intestinal histological sections taken from TNF~x KO and wild-type mice infected with C parvum were stained in H&E to compare the degree of inflammation present. In order to explore the relationship between TNFa and IFN'y, semiquantitative RT-PCR was performed on intestinal samples obtained at the peak of infection from the above 2 groups for differences in mucosal mRNA expression of IFNy. Additionally, IFN'y KO mice which develop a chronic infection with C parvum, were treated with anti-TNF antibodies at the time of infection and the level of oocyst shedding measured on days 4 and 7 post infection. Results: Histologically the level of inflammation between C parvum infected TNF KO and wild-type mice appeared similar suggesting that the presence of TNFa contributed little to the inflammatory process. 1FN'y mucosal expression was again similar in these 2 groups. The addition of anti-TNF antibodies to IFN'y KO mice infected with C. parvum had no effect on the degree of infection. Thus, even in an 1FN',/-deficient environment, TNFc~ did not seem to be important. Conclusion: TNFcx appears to have a minimal role in the immune response to C. parvum in a mouse model of infection.",

Bohr, Michael Selgrad, Christian Ochmann, Andreas Fenske, Doerthe Kuester, Albert Roessner, Thomas Wex, Peter Malfertheiner BACKGROUND: Enterohepatic Helicobacter species are capable to colonize the hepatobifiary system and the intestinal tract of laboratory mice in which the bacteria may cause various diseases such as hepatitis, inflammatory bowel disease and malignancies. Because the prevalence of Helicobacter infections in laboratory mice is uncertain, we investigated a sample of laboratory mice in the specific-pathogen free tract of our animal facility on Helicobacteraceae. METHODS: From 50 laboratory mice harboured in the central animal laboratory of our university feces was collected and analysed for Helicobacteraceae using a group-specific PCR. DNA-sequencing and subsequent sequence analysis were performed to identify the individual Helicobacter species. In double infected mice species identification was completed by restriction fragment length polymorphism. RESULTS: In 28 (56%) of the 50 tested laboratory mice the PCR assay produced a strong amplification product indicating Helicobacter infection. Nine mice (18%) were PCR-negative. In the remaining 13 mice (26%) the PCR assay produced a marginal result. Therefore, these samples were not further analyzed. In 25 out of the 28 Heficobacter-positive mice the 16S rRNA sequence obtained by DNA-sequencing of the amplification product could clearly be assigned to known Helicobacter species: H. ganmani (n= 14) , H. sp. \"ulmiensis\" (n=6), H. hepaticas (n=3) , and H. sp. \"hamster B\" (n=2). In 3 mice DNA-sequencing indicated an infection of the animals with more than one Heficobacter species. In these mice co-infection with H. ganmani and H. hepaticus was diagnosed by restriction fragment polymorphism analysis. CONCLUSION: Although the mice were reared under SPF conditions and some of the mice had been delivered as Helicobacter free, in the investigated mice Helicobacter infections were frequently detected. This is of importance because Helicobacter infections have to be considered as undesirable and incalculable variables, which may have impact on the reproducibility of animal experiments especially in the field of hepatology and gastroenterology. Communication between neurites and mast cells is a prototypic example of neuro-immune interaction. We previously reported a close apposition between mucosal mast cells (MMCs) and a dense network of calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP)-IR extrinsic primary afferent nerve fibres in the lamina propria of S. mansoni-infected murine ileum (1). These CGRP-IR fibres originate from dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Using optical recordings of intracellular calcium (Ca2 + )i we examined the bidirectional interaction between primary cultured MMCs and DRG neurons in vitro. The degranulatory EC50 for the mast cell degranulator C48/80 (10/.~g/ml) and the neuropeptides CGRP (2.10-8 M) and SP (3.10-8 M) were determined by measurement of extracellular mMCP-1. Application of the mast cell degranulator C48/ 80 (10p, g/ml) to fluo-4 loaded (I~M, 40rain, 20\u00b0C) MMCs induced a transient rise in (Ca2+)i in 56_ + 1% (mean _+ SD; 3 cultures) of the 260 cells studied, with a lag time of 47-+21s and an amplitude of 7-+2 RE (Relative Fluorescence; baseline RF= 1). A smaller (P~0.01) percentage of MMCs was activated by 10-7M CGRP (15-+6%; 3 cultures; 599 cells) and 10-7M SP (12 -+ 3%; 2 cultures; 547 cells). The lag time of the response to CGRP (33 _+ 26s) and SP (21 -16s) was shorter (P~0.001) than that to C48/80. The CGRP response could be completely blocked (to 1 _+ 2% of control; 5 cultures) by pertussis toxin (2p.g/ml; 3h), indicating involvement of G-proteins. Application of 'MMC juice' (obtained by C48/ 80 degranulation) to fluo-4 loaded DRG neurons (5 cultures) induced a rise in (Ca2 +)i, with a lag time of 5 _+ 2s and an amplitude of 2 _+ 0.4 RF. We also showed that degranulation of MMCs by C48/80 in culture dishes containing DRG neurons, caused a comparable activation (1.7-+0.4 RF) of DRG neurons, but with a much longer lag time (25_+ 10s, P<0.001; 2 cultures). In conclusion, these results demonstrate that a bidirectional crosstalk between cultured MMCs and DRG neurons in vitro, indicating a functional relevance for the close apposition of MMCs and CGRP-IR nerve fibres in vivo.

            "text": "Background. Na-amino co-transport (NAcT) is inhibited during chronic intestinal inflammation secondary to altered affinity of the co-transporter for the amino acid. Whether and how arachidonic acid metabolites (e.g. prostaglandins and leukotrienes), known to be elevated in the inflamed intestinal mucosa, may affect this alteration is unknown. Aims. Determine whether arachidonic acid metabolites metabolites (AAM) mediate the inhibition of NAcT during chronic enteritis. Methods. The rabbit model of inflammatory bowel disease produced by Eimeria magna was utilized. Villus cells were isolated from rabbit intestine by a Ca + + chelation technique. Brush border membrane vesicles (BBMV) were prepared from villus cells by Ca + + precipitation and differential centrifugation. Results. Treatment of rabbits with chronic enteritis with arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (ATMK), an inhibitor of arachidonic acid metabolism, resulted in the reversal of inhibition on NAcT in villus cells (Nadependent alanine uptake was 10.5 --+ 1.1nmol/mg protein/15 minutes in normal, 1.6 + 0.4 in inflamed and 7.8 + 0.6 in inflamed + ATMK, n = 3, p<0.01). ATMK had no effect on NAcT in normal villus cells. ATMK also reversed the inhibition of Na-K-ATPase in villus cells during chronic enteritis (Na-K-ATPase activity was 14.0 + 1.1 nmols Pi/mg protein/minute in normal, 4.9+1.0 in inflamed and 12.3_+1.0 in inflamed + ATMK, n=3, p<0.01). However, ATMK reversed the inhibition of NAcT in villus cell BBMV from the chronically inflamed intestine which suggested a direct effect on the co-transporter itself. (Na-dependent uptake of alanine in BBMV was 74.1 + 3.4 pmols/mg protein/9 seconds in normal, 8.6 -+ i. 1 in inflamed and 72.7-+3.3 in inflamed + ATMK, n=3, p<0.05). Kinetic studies demonstrated that ATMK reversed the inhibition of NAcT by restoring the affinity of the cotransporter for amino acid (1/Km) without an effect on the maximal rate of uptake of amino acid (Vmax) . Western blot studies also demonstrated that ATMK treatment did not affect the imuno-reactive levels of NAcT in BBM. Conclusions. When AAM production is abolished in the chronically inflamed intestine, inhibition of NAcT is alleviated. The mechanism of reversal of NAcT inhibition is secondary to the restoration of affinity of the co-transporter for the amino acid. Thus, AAM likely mediate the inhibition of NAcT in the chronically inflamed intestine.",

            "text": "Pradip K. Bardhan, Hamidur Rahman, David A. Sack Background. Oral rehydration solutions (ORS) can successfully rehydrate more than 90% of patients with dehydration from acute diarrhea. However, treatment with the present ORS formulations does not reduce the volume, frequency or the duration of diarrhea. Objective. To study whether incorporation of ORS components into liposomes increases small intestinal absorption of water from ORS in an experimental animal model. Method. In vivo perfusion of the entire small intestine was performed in a total of 83 adult rats divided into three groups: normal rats (n= 2B), rats exposed to cholera toxin (CT) (n= 24), and rats exposed to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (n=31). PEG was used as marker. Net movements of water was compared between a Tapioca-based ORS containing liposomes (Aquis kiposomal ORS), a Tapioca-based ORS without liposomes (Tapioca-ORS), and the recently WHO-recommended hypo-osmolar ORS (W~AO-ORS). Results. All the three ORS solutions resulted in significant absorption, but the Aquis Liposomal ORS provided a significantly and statistically higher level of absorption in all three of the rat groups as compared to both the WHO-ORS and Tapioca-ORS. The results of the 5-FU treated rats indicate that Tapioca appears to increase absorption in damaged mucosa. A practical improvement of the Aquis Liposomal ORS is that it tasted less salty. Conclusion. All three oral rehydration solutions are well absorbed, but the Aquis kiposomal ORS was associated with the highest level of water and electrolyte absorption. Comparing the results of the Aquis kiposomal ORS with the Tapioca-ORS indicate that the liposomes were responsible for the sigmficant increase in the absorption of water and electrolytes. Tapioca It inhibits proliferation of host T-lymphocytes and induces cell cycle G2 arrest. In this study, we hypothesize that Vpr induces human intestinal epithelial cell malfunction. Methods: C2BBE1 cells (a differentiated intestinal epithelial cell line derived from human colonic adenocarcinoma) were used. Cells were infected with Ad-Vpr (replication-deficiem adenovirus carrying vpr gene). To determine cell cycle profile, cells were stained with propidinm iodide and cell cycle distribution was determined on a FACScan. To examine cytoskeleton structure, cells were stained with FITC-conjugated phalloidin and analyzed with a fluorescent microscope. Results: Our preliminary data indicated that Ad-Vpr-infected C2BBE1 cells exhibited increased G2/M:G1 ratio compared with mock infected cells. The effect was detected within 72 hrs and in a dose dependent manner. These observations suggest that vpr gene expression in intestinal epithelial ceils resulted in cell cycle G2 arrest.",

The cytoskeleton structure of the infected cells was further disorganized at 72 hrs of infection. Conclusions: The present study indicates that H1V-1 Vpr (1) induces cell cycle arrest of human intestinal epithelial cells at the G2 phase; and (2) disrupts the cytoskeleton of human enterocytes. Therefore, we hypothesize that Vpr may play a role in the pathogenesis of HIV intestinal disease (Supported by Eloise and Warren Botts Young Investigator Award). Clostridium difficile is the primary cause of nosocomial antibiotic-associated diarrhoea m developed countries and a frequent cause of pseudomembranous colitis. The main virulence factors, two toxins (toxin A and toxin B) secreted by the bacteria, have been targeted by vaccine studies. However, the surface layer proteins (SLPs), which completely cover the cell, are also targeted by the immune response in the disease. This study assessed the ability of high-titre rabbit anti-C, difficile SLP antibodies to protect against infection in a lethal hamster challenge model. SLPs were extracted from a Type 1 C difficile strain with 8 M urea and purified to >95% on a MonoQ anion exchange column attached to an FPLC system. New Zealand White rabbits were injected subcutaneously with 100 lag of the purified SLPs in complete Freund's adjuvant and boosted after 2 and 4 weeks with 100 p,g of antigen in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Specificity of the antibodies was confirmed by Western blot with the SLPs. The SLP-specific antibody titre of the harvested serum was 1:64,000 as determined by ELISA. Two groups of hamsters (n = 8) were challenged by orogastric administration with 2 mg clindamycin (-4h) followed by C. difficile (105 CFU) . C difficile was preincubated with rabbit anti-SLP or irrelevant serum prior to administration. One pre-challenge (-7h) and three post-challenge doses (6h, 17h, 24h) of rabbit anti-SLP serum were also given. A C difficile-only group (n = 4) was also included. We examined the permeability to the macromolecnle horse radish peroxidase (HRP, 40 kD) in duodenal biopsies of eight children with chronic diarrhea and compared it to control values in biopsies of five patients without diarrhea. Furthermore, in additional biopsies of the diarrhea patients we tested the effect of mucosal addition of carboxyldextran (150 kD, 5 g/l) upon the permeability of HRP. Biopsies were mounted in Ussing chambers (serosal surface area 1.1 mm 2) at 370 C. HRP (105 M) was added to the mucosal side and serosal appearance was measured enzymaticafly during 120 minutes. Then tissues were fixed for electronmicruscopy and stained for HRP-activity. In control patients HRP-flux at 120 minutes was 7.4 + 1.5 pmol/cm2.h (N = 5) and mucosal uptake appeared to be detectable only by endocytosis. In four,diarrhea patients (of which three had microvilhis inclusion disease) HRP uptake was detected by endocytosis but also by tight junctional leak and paracellular permeation, and HRP-flux was significantly increased (36.2 \"4\" 6.0 pmol/cm2.h; N =4; p < 0.02). In the presence of carboxyldextran HRP-flux in these patients was significantly reduced (p < 0.03) to 8.4 _+ 1.0 pmol/cm2.h (N =4), and no tight junctional or paracellular staining of HRP was detectable anymore. In the four other diarrhea patients HRP-flux was comparable to controls (11.8 -+ 3.2 pmoI/cm2.h; N = 4) and only detected by endocytic uptake. In these latter four patients carboxyldextran had no effect on HRP-flux (15.1 _+ 6.4 pmol/cm2.h; N = 4), and HRP-staining was only detected in endosomes. Moreover, in rat ileum mounted in Ussing chambers, the carbachol-induced threefold increment in HRP permeability was significantly reduced by electronegative carboxyldextrans, but not by neutral dextrans. We conclude that mucosal addition of carboxyldextrau may prevent the loss of small intestinal paracellular macromolecular barrier function, and that the electronegative terminal carboxylgroup is important in this aspect. These findings may possibly lead to a new therapeutical approach in intestinal permeability disorders.",

            "text": "Three to five billion cases of diarrhea are reported throughout the world every year; of these, ~-10 million are fatal. While the etiological agent for these cases is not always identified, the role of viruses in inducing diarrhea has become increasingly recognized. Astrovirus has been shown to be the second leading cause of virally induced diarrhea in children; in spite of its prevalence in the population, little research has been conducted on the mechanisms of astrovirns pathogenesis, particularly in humans. Previous findings in an avian infection model have demonstrated a lack of either cellular damage or an inflammatory response; t~med on this, we hypothesized that astrovirus infection decreases intestinal barrier permeabilily, leading to diarrhea in the absence of cellular damage. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the effect of infection on intestinal barrier permeability using human intestinal carcinoma (Caco-2) cells. Briefly, Caco-2 cells were incubated for 3 days using the BD BioCoat intestinal differentiation environment to form a polarized cell layer; cell layers were then infected with serotype 1 human astrovirus (HAstV-1). Barrier permeability was measured by changes in transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and the migration of fiuorescentlylabeled dextran across this cell layer. We observe a time-dependent decrease in TER in h-ffected cells which is absent in controls; furthermore, by 24 hours after infection, we see an increase in basolateral chamber fluorescence over controls wells. Both of these results ~dicate an astrovirus-induced increase in intestinal barrier permeability. The celhdar and ,viral mechanisms by which this is effected have not yet been identified; however, we are L'urrently pursuing the possible relationship between astrovirus infection and cytoskeletal changes in an effort to further understand this decrease in barrier integrity. Background : Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a major cause of nosocomial diarrhea, and prevalence rate of C. difficile in healthy adults is believed to be very low. However, our current study using RT-PCR with glass powder, that eliminates PCR inhibitors, showed that C. difficile toxin B mRNA was detected in approximately 50% of feces from healthy human adults. In this study, to clarify the validity of our current study we attempted to show whether PCR inhibitors in feces actually decrease the sensitivity of PCR for detecting C. difficile and the glass powder can eliminate such PCR inhibitors and increase the sensitivity of PCR. Methods : (1) Fecal samples were collected with informed consent from 30 healthy human adult volunteers (mean age: 42.5+/-13 (SD) years old). They had not received any antibiotics in the past 6 months and had not admitted in the hospitals in the past few years. mRNA was extracted from fecal samples with acid phenol and glass powder (BIO 101, CA). After reverse transcription of 2ml of the extracted RNA, converted DNA was amplified by PCR with the primers to toxin B gene of C. difficile. Since some PCR inhibitors in feces carried through the phenol-chloroform extraction procedure, we also extracted DNA from fecal samples using phenol-chloroform and they were subjected to PCR with the same primers.",

            "text": "Background: The enterohepatic circulation of bile salts involves specific bile acid transporters expressed in the enterocytes in the ileum. Disease or surgical resection of the terminal ileum produces bile acid malabsorption leading to diarrhea. Idiopathic (primary) bile acid malabsorption is a relatively common cause of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. A mutation in the apical sodium-linked bile transporter, expressed in the brushborder membrane, has been reported to cause disease but is not found in most patients with primary bile acid malabsorption. We looked for polymorphisms in another transporter in this system, the ileal bile acid binding protein gena (IBABP, gene symbol FABP6), expressed in the cytoplasm. Methods: Genomic DNA was prepared from 23 patients with chronic diarrhea, including 9 with bile salt malabsorption confirmed by SeHCAT testing, and 23 control subjects without diarrhea. Approximately lkb of the promoter and the four exons including intron/exon junctions were amplified and sequenced. Results: Several different Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were identified in the promoter region of the 1BABP gene. 12 of the 46 subjects had a SNP in the promoter. No patient had more than one polymorphism. The most frequent of these SNPs was found in 9 subjects: 6 with diarrhea and 3 controls. Another was found in 2 subjects with diarrhea and in 2 controls. Both of these SNPs may represent consensus transcription factor binding sites. A number of other SNPs were identified in the exonic regions including a coding change in exon 2. Conclusion: Genetic variation is common in the IBABP gene and may lead to functional abnormalities in bile acid absorption. Further studies are necessary to define the contribution of these polymorphisms to the pathophysiology of primary bile acid malabsorption and chronic diarrhea.",

            "text": "Purpose: Patients that present with a complaint of chronic diarrhea often have irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) . Distinguishing between IBS patients and those with significant organic pathology can be difficult without performing invasive investigations. A non-invasive test to rule out organic pathology could potentially eliminate the need for costly investigations in certain patients. The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility of using assessment of whole intestinal permeability (gastric, small intestinal and colonic) to predict the presence of organic pathology in patients presenting with chronic diarrhea. Methods: New referrals to a tertiary care gastroenterology clinic with a history of three or more stools per day for at least six weeks were assessed for enrollment. Patients underwent investigations at the discretion of the treating gastroenterologist. In addition to appropriate investigations, the whole intestinal permeability of each patient was assessed. Sucrose was used as a probe for gastric permeability. The ratio of lactnlose to manuitol was used as a probe for small intestinal permeability and sucralose was used as a probe for colonic permeability. All patients had an endomysial antibody (EMA) and screening bloodwork including a complete blood count. Results: To date, complete data on eight patients is available. Invasive investigations were done in all patients including esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), colonoscopy and small bowel follow through (SBFT) in two, EGD and colonoscopy in four and colonoscopy alone in two. Two patients had a final diagnosis of lymphocytic colitis, one bad post-infectious IBS, one had mycophenolate induced colitis, two had mild, non-specific colitis of an undetermined etiology and one bad no diagnosis assigned after normal investigations (EGD and colonoscopy). EMA was negative in all patients. Gastric, small intestinal and colonic permeability was normal in all patients. Conclusions: In this preliminary data, whole intestinal permeability testing does not appear to be of value in predicting the presence of organic disease. There does not appear to be an abnormality in colonic or small intestinal permeability in the two patients reported with lymphocytic colitis. More patients will be studied in a continued effort to examine the utility of permeability testing in this patient population.",

            "text": "To date, virtually no information is available on the modulation of SCFA uptake by pathogenic microorganisms that cause secretory and inflammatory diarrhea in the human intestine. In this regard, EPEC is a major cause of infantile diarrhea and intestinal inflammation. The effect of EPEC infection on butyrate uptake was investigated using human intestinal epithelial Coco-2 ceils as an in vitro model. Monolayers were infected with EPEC or its mutants for 30 to 90 rain and butyrate transport was subsequently determined as pH-driven P4C] butyrate uptake. Our results demonstrated that infection of Caco-2 cells with EPEC resulted in substantial decrease in butyrate uptake, with ~70% decrease as early as 30 rain (P<0.05). Non-pathogenic E. coil had no effect. EPEC houses a pathogenicity island that encodes a type Ill secretory system (TTSS) that translocates bacterial virulence proteins directly into host cells. EPEC exerts its effects on host cells by intimately attaching and injecting effector molecules into the host cell cytoplasm. Mutation of escN, which encodes the ATPase for \"f'fSS, ablated the effects of EPEC on butyrate uptake (in pmol/mg proteirdSmin, Control: 4.25 +/-0.5; EPEC: 2.34 +/-0.05; escN: 3.85 +/-0.25). The TTSS apparatus is a complex array of structural and EPEC secreted proteins (Esps). The terminal structures of this apparatus consist of EspA, EspB and EspD. EPEC secreted effector proteins include EspF, EspG, EspH, Tir and Map. Infection of Coco-2 monolayers with EPEC mutants harboring mutations in either espA, espB, espD, or t/r, the translocated intimin receptor, ablated the effect of EPEC on butyrate uptake by Caco-2 cells (as % of Control, EPEC: 29 +/-5; tit: 109 +/-7.5). The mutants espG and espH, however had no effect on butyrate uptake. Conclusions: Our results provide evidence that EPEC inhibits butyrate uptake in human intestinal epithelial cells and that these effects are dependent on a functional TFSS and the secreted EPEC receptor, \"fir. We speculate that the decreased availability of butyrate to intestinal epithelial cells induced by EPEC infection may compromise epithelial integrity and enhance inflammation of the colonic epithelium. Background and Aims: We previously characterised a novel bacteriocin produced by a human commensal/probiotic that has a broad spectrum of antimicrobial activity. We also reported that some but not all commercially available and experimental probiotics confer host protection against S. typhimurium infection. The aim of the present study was to examine mechanisms of action at several levels including: probiotic-pathogen antagonism; local invasiveness; translocation; and host cytokine responses. Methods: Balb/c mice were fed B. infantts, L. salivarius or other probiotic strains (n = 10 per strain, lxlOg/day) for 3 weeks prior to challenge with lxl07 S. typhimurium. Feeding was continued for a further 6 days. Invasiveness and translocation of the pathogen were confirmed by recovery from intestine, spleen and liver. Production of cytokines by intestinal and other lymphoid cells was assessed by EL1SA and probiotic-pathogen interactions in vitro were studied with epithelial cell lines (HT29 and CaCo2). The activity of buffered and non-buffered probiotic supernatants with and without bacteriocin were assessed in probiotic/pathogen co-cultures using B. infantis and L salivarius. Results: In vitro co-cultures showed clearly that S. typhimurium is not susceptible to the probiotic-derived bacteriocin (ABP UCCll8) tested. However, partial direct inhibition of the pathogen was observed that could not be accounted for by changes in pH due to lactic acid production by the probiotics. Epithelial binding and competitive inhibition of invasiveness was demonstrable in vitro with several lactobacilli but this did not predict in vivo probiotic performance. Clinically effective probiotic strains exhibited not only reduced local invasiveness by S. typhimurium but also reduced translocation of the pathogen to the liver and spleen. The protective effect of probiotic feeding was associated with enhanced production of IFN-y by intestinal Peyer's patch cells after stimulation in vitro by salmonella. Conclusion: (1) the in vitro activity of putative probiotics against S. typhimurium does not predict in vivo performance against a sublethal infection; (2) probiotic strains exhibiting clinically significant protection against this invasive pathogen were associated with enhanced IFN~/production by intestinal lymphoid cells which may be critical to the mechanism of action. Background : Previously reported data showed that L farciminis improved an experimental colitis induced by TNBS in rats. Moreover, L salivarius exerts a prophylactic effect on both colitis and arthritis in mice by systemic and local immunomodulation through norrnalizatio~ of enteric flora. On another hand, N. brasiliensis (Nb) infection in rats is associated with both intestinal and lung inflammation characterized by a synchronous increase in MPO activity in both organs peaking 12 days after infection. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine whether oral L. farcirainis treatment exerts anti-inflammatory effects in two different targets (jejunum and lung) in Nb-niduced inflammation in rats. Methods : Two series of experiments were performed in groups of 10 male Wistar rats: controls (0.2 ral saline, sc) and Nb-infected rats (3000 third stage infective larvae in 0.2 ml saline, sc). Frora 4 days before until 12 days after injection, rats received a daily oral treatment of 101l CFU of L farciminis or saline. In the first series, rats were exanguinated on day 12, and jejunum and lung segments were collected for MPO activity assay. In the second series, the number of leucocytes and individual white ceils were determined in broncho-alveolar lavages (BALs)I Results : Compared with control rats, Nb infection significantly increased MPO activity in both jejunum and lung (456 -+ 56vs40 \u00b1 9 ;324 +--21vs 100 -+ 16 U /g protein respectively). L. farciminis treatment significantly reduced by 49.6 % and 26.2 % the increase of MPO in jejunum and lung segments respectively. Likewise, the number of macrophages, neutrophils, lymphocytes and eosinophils was significantly increased in BAL from Nb-infected rats compared with controls. Treatment with L. farciraints significantly reduced pulmonary leucocyte infiltration in BALs from Nb-infected rats (58.3%). Similarly, all white cell numbers were reduced in animals treated with L. farciminis. Conclusion : This work shows that an oral treatment with L.farciminis has an anti-inflammatory effect against N. brasiliensis infection in both gut and lung, suggesting a neuro-immune link between the two organs. Background : Our previous data showed that L farciminis reduces the severity of an experimental colitis through the release of nitric oxide (NO), and inhibited stress-induced increases in colonic paraceflular permeability and sensitivity in rats. The aim of the present study was to determine whether the beneficial effects of L. farciminis on stress-induced colonic alterations may result from the intracolonic delivery of NO by this probiotic. Methods : Ten groups of 8 female Wistar rats were equipped with NiCr wire electrodes in abdominal striated muscles (groups 1-5) or intracolonic (IC) catheter (groups 6-10). Rats received orally during 15 days either saline (groups 1-3, 6-8) or 1011 CFU/day of L farciminis (groups 4, 5, 9, 10) . They were submitted to partial restraint stress (PRS) (2h; groups 3-5, 8-10) or sham stress (groups 1, 2, 6, 7). Stepwise rectal distension (RD) (0-60 mm Fig; increment 15 mm Fig) were performed in groups 1 to 5, 20 rain after PRS or sham stress. Groups 6 to 10 received 5~Cr-EDTA (250 ~L; 0.7 ~Ci IC) after PRS or sham stress and colonic paraceflular permeability was assessed by measuring radioactivity recovery in urine for 24 h. Hemoglobin (NO scavenger; 200mg/kg/day) was infused continuously into the colon for 48 h before PRS or sham stress, and during the RD session (groups 2, 5) or urine recovery period (groups 7, 10). Results : PRS increased the number of abdominal contractions for all volumes of RD (84 -+ 5 vs. 54 -+ 4 contractions/5 rain at 45 mm Hg; P<O.05) and colonic permeability (2.07 -+ 0.24 vs. 1.40 _+ 0.20 %; P<0.5) compared to sham stress. L. farciminis treatment prevented the increase of the number of abdominal contractions, whatever the volume of RD (44 \u00b1 5 vs. 84 + 5 contractions/5 rain at 45 mm Hg; P<O.05), and the increase in permeability (0.95 \u00b1 0.09 vs. 2.07 -+ 0.24 %; P<O.05). Hemoglobin reversed the protective effects of L farciminis on stress-induced hyperalgesia (90 \u00b1 8 vs. 44 \u00b1 5 contractions/5 m/n at 45 mm Hg; P<O.05) and on the increase in colonic permeability (1.72 _+ 0.19 vs. 0.95 _+ 0.09 %; P<O.05). In the absence of L farciminis treatment hemoglobin had no effect per se. Conclusion : This work indicates that the beneficial effects of a two week treatment by L. farciminis on stress-induced increases in both colonic permeability and sensitivity are linked to the intraluminal release of NO by this probiotic.",

Background/A/m: FMLP has been shown to enhance inflammatory activity in animal models of acute colitis. An etiologic pathway has been proposed that would involve the presence of some, as yet unknown, initiating factor or antigen, which gains access to the subepithelial space. The pathophysiological role and importance of such a peptide in the chronic phase of colitis is still unknown. We hypothesized that the route of administration of the bacterial peptide FMLP, either intravenous (i.v.) or intracolonic (i.c.), and thus access to the subepithelial space, would influence differently the inflammatory response in the chronic relapse phase of colitis. Methods: Six weeks after the initial induction of acute colitis with TNBS (30mg in 50% ETOH i.c.), chronic relapsed inflammation was induced by administration of TNBS (5mg/kg i.v.) at 24 hour time intervals over three days. Five groups of rats with chronic colitis were studied: reactivated with TNBS alone, reactivated with TNBS + FMLP in 6\u00b0,% DMSO (i.v. or i.c. administration) , and reactivated with TNBS + 6% DMSO (i.v. or i.c. administration) . The colons were removed and scored for macroscopic and microscopic damage, tissues were taken for myeloperoxidase activity, and sections of muscle-free mucosa were mounted in Ussing chambers. Epithelial cell basal short circuit ct/rrent (Isc), resistance (R), potential difference (PD) and responses to acetylcholine (ACh; 10 9--10 -3 M) were used as indices of tissue viability. Results: Intravenous administration of FMLP significantly decreased Isc and tissue viability in distal colon compared to vehicle treated controls (Alsc 58.03 \"4-10.22 vs 125.43 -+ 20.59 p~'cm 2, p<0.05; 1.OmM ACh). In addition, the intravenous administration of FMLP aggravated the macroscopic and microscopic damage induced by TNBS. In contrast, the intracolonic administration of FMLP did not further modify the effects of TNBS on macroscopic damage or viability parameters in this reactivated model of relapsed colitis. Conclusions: The role of baqterial peptides in chronic inflammation is far less important if confined to the lumen of the colon by an intact epithelial barrier. However, if this peptide is able to reach the systemic circulation, it can exacerbate the ongoing inflammation contributing to changes in tissue viability and damage. Supported in part by an NRSA from NIDDK and NIH-MBRS. Introduction. Unmethylated CpG motifs, predominantly present in bacterial DNAI can be immunostimulatory via Toll-like receptor (TLR)-9. Commensal bacteria play a role in maintaining immune homeostasis in the gut. Dendritic cells (DC) play a pivotal role in recogmsing and responding to microbial products, including DNA, and shaping the developing T cell response. Therefore, we determined the effects of DNA derived from probiotic bifidobacteria, lactobacilli and Streptococcus salivatius subsp, thermophilus present in the probiotic combination VSL#3 (VSL#3 Pharmaceuticals, Ft. Lauderdale, FL, USA) on DC. Methods. DC in whole blood or enriched on a metrizamide gradient were cultured with DNA derived from the probiotic bacteria in the presence or absence of TLR9. DC were identified by muhi-colour flow cytometry as an HLA-DR+ lineage negative (CD3-, CD14-, CD16-, CD19-, CD34-, CD56-) population and within this population CDllc+ (myeloid) and CD1 lc-(plasmacytoid) DC were assessed. Expression of activation markers (CD40 and CCR7) was analysed by flow cytometry and cytokine production (IL-10 and IFNa) was assessed by intracellular staining and ELISA. Results. Probiotic bacterial DNA activated both myeloid and plasmacytoid DC as indicated by enhanced CD40 and CCR7 expression in DNA-treated cultures. DNA derived from all bacterial strains potently induced IL-10 production by an enriched DC population as assessed by ELISA. In whole blood cultures, the bacterial DNA selectively induced IL-10 in the myeloid DC population. Low levels of 1FNu were transiently induced by bacterial DNA at early time points selectively in plasmacytoid DC. Blocking of TLR9 led to lower CCR7 expression on plasmacytoid DC and to decreased IL-10 production by myeloid DC. Conclusions. Bacterial DNA from all probiotic strains was a potent IL-IO inducer but induced low levels of IFNa by DC. Given TLR9 expression by plasmacytoid DC, it may be hypothesized that bacterial DNA exerts its primary and early effects on plasmacytoid DC. The effects on myeloid DC may be either indirect via plasmacytoid DC or direct via yet unknown mechanisms. Each year in the US there are 2 to 4 million cases of Salmonella infection in infants under 1 year of age, resulting in varying degrees of diarrhea. The hypothesis of this study was that fiber with differing fermentability provides beneficial effects on ileal and colonic intestinal function and structure following Salmonella typhimurium infection. Piglets (48h old, n = 60) were randomized to: control (C, sow milk replacer formula), or control formula supplemented with non-fermentable methylcellulose (M), moderately fermentable soy polysaccharide (S), or completely fermentable fructooligosaccharide (F) for 7d. Piglets were then infected with 1010 colony forming units of ST-798 by oral gavage, and both ileal and colonic tissues were harvested at O, 4, 12, 24, 48h post infection for electrophysiological and histological analyses. Regardless of time, ileal glucose transport in the S group was elevated (p = 0.0186) over F and C groups, with the M group exhibiting a moderate increase compared to F (C = 2.28 _+ 0.99, M = 4.36 _+ 1.16, S = 5.48_+ 1.03, F = 1.34 --_ 0.91 p,A/cm2). At all time points, S groups showed increased (p = 0.0349) ileal glutamine transport compared to C, M and F (C = 1.72 _+ 0.55, M = 1.96 + 0.64, S = 3:00-+ 0:56, F = 1.47 -+ 0.54 pA/cm2). Colonic glutamine transport at 12h was elevated (p = 0.01995) in the M group compared to all other treatments (C = 0.42-+ 1.59, M= 11.71 -+2.10, S= 1.55-+2.10, F =0.85-+ 1.75 ~A/cm2). At 48h, colonic glutamine transport for the S groups was increased (p=0.0199) compared to all other groups (C=2.16+2.10, M= 0.8_+ 1.75, S= 4.99-+ L75, F= 2.50+ 1.75 pA/cm2). There was no char~ge in basal short circuit current between any groups. Regardless of time, ileal crypt depth was decreased (p=0.0450) in M and S groups compared to C and F (C=167+14, M=140-+14, S=139+15, F=168_+15 ~M). Conversely, colonic crypt depth in the S group was increased (p = 0.0508) above all other treatments at all time points (C=283-+31, M=260+ 14, S=307-+ 14, F=265-+ 14 p,M). These results indicate that fiber has positive effects during enteric Salmonella typhimurium 798 infection that are dependant on the degree of fermentability, with soy polysaccharide appearing to elicit the greatest improvement in ileal and colonic function and structure.

Sitaraman Background and significance: Host factors regulating bactenal-epithefial interactions are mostly unknown yet may play a role in regulating intestinal inflammation. Adenosine is a potent endogenous physiological regulator of inflammation whose levels are upregulated during inflammation. This study was undertaken to investigate the role of adenosine in modulating flbronectin (FN) synthesis, polarity of FN secretion and its effect on S. typhimurium (S.T.) invasion into, and induction of chemokine secretion by, model intestinal epithelia.",

            "text": "Methods: Primary intestinal epithelial cell line IEC-6 and colonic epithelial cell line, T84 were used. 8.T. strain SL 3201 was used for invasion assays. IL-8 was measured by ELISA. Results: Adenosine added to either apical or basolateral aspect of the cells led to a time and dose dependent accumulation of FN in the culture supernatants, polarized to the apical compartment and reached to maximal levels, 24 h after apical or basolateral (10 and 12 fold increase compared to control) addition of adenosine. Confocal microscopy revealed that FN localized to apical domain of model intestinal epithelial cells stimulated with apical or basolateral adenosine. The induction of FN was significantly downregulated in response to adenosine 2b receptor antagonist afloxazine and PKA inhibitor H89 and was completely abolished by cycloheximide. Adenosine increased FN promoter activity (3.5 folds compared to unstimulated controls) indicating that FN induction is, at least in part, transcriptionally regulated. Finally, pretreatment of epithelia with exogenous FN (12 ug/ml) at the luminal surface, significantly enhanced the adherence (S.T. alone 10 +/-3 X 106 FN + S.T. 69 +/-5 X 10 ~ CFU/insert) and invasion of S.T. (S.T. alone 0.09 +/-.01 X 106 FN + S.T. 0.4 +/-0.09 X 106 CFU/insert) and upregulated basal IL-8 secretion (Control: 0.03 +/-0.01 S.T. 0.32 +/-0.01, FN + S.T. 0.54 +/-0.05 ng/ml respectively) from intestinal epithelial cells infected with bacteria. Conclusions: Using physiologically relevant epithelial model systems, we have shown for the first time that FN, a classic extracellular matrix protein is secreted into the apical compartment of epithelial cells in response to adenosine. FN may be a critical host factor that modulates adherence and invasion of bacteria such as S.T. and regulate chemokine secretion, thus playing a key role in mucosalimmune responses during inflammation.",

            "text": "Characterization of a Murine Model of Enteropathogenic E. Coil Infection Suzana D. Savkovic, Jennilee Villanueva, Kristina A. Matkowskyj, Gall Hecht Enteropathogenic E. coil (EPEC) is an important cause of diarrhea in humans. EPEC infection of cultured intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) induces attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions, increases paracelhilar permeability, and initiates inflammation. The lack of a small animal model has restricted in vivo studies examining EPEC-host interactions. We have demonstrated that EPEC attaches to cultured murine IEC, induces A/E lesions, activates inflammatory molecules, and colonizes the intestine of C57BL/J6 mice. The aim of this study was to further characterize the C57BL/J6 mouse as a model of EPEC infection. Six to eight week old C57BL/ 6J mice were infected with EPEC for 5 or 10 days and observed for water consumption and body weight. At the time of sacrifice, intestines were inspected for the presence of liquid vs formed stool. The colon was assessed for effacement of microvifli, A/E lesions, and overall histology. Mice infected with Citrobacter rodentium, a mouse pathogen genetically similar to EPEC, were used for comparison. After 10 days of infection, there was no significant difference in body weight or water intake between uninfected and mice infected with EPEC or C. rodentium. The entire colon of uninfected mice was filled with formed stool pellets, while the proximal colon of infected mice contained fluid with formed stool pellets only in the distal colon. There was a trend toward increased colon weight in infected animals (35.3 -2.2, 43.4 \u00b1 2.1, and 44.9 \u00b1 3.1 mg/cm for control, EPEC (p = 0.056), and C. rodentium (p = 0.072), respectively). Hematoxylin & eosin staining revealed crypt abscesses, increased inflammatory infiltrate in the lamina propria, formation of lymphoid aggregates, and loss of goblet cells in EPEC infected mice. Similar changes, in addition to colonic hyperplasia, were seen, as previously described, for infection with C. rodentium. Immunofluorescent staining for intimin, an EPEC adhesin, suggested adherent microcoloines on the surface epithelium. Co-staining for actin revealed intimin-associated actin aggregates indicative of A/E lesion formation. Assessment of colonic tissue by transmission electron microscopy confirmed intimately attached bacteria and effacement of microvilli in EPEC and C rodentium infected mice. In conclusion, EPEC infection of C57BL/6J mice results in: 1) A/E lesion formation; 2) increased colonic weight and liquid stool, and 3) intestinal inflammation. These data demonstrate that the C57BL/6J mouse may provide a good model for EPEC infection. Recent studies indicate that TNF-a increase in intestinal TJ permeability may be an important mechanism leading to an increase in antigenic penetration and intestinal inflammation. The mechanism of TNF-a modulation of intestinal epithelial TJ barrier remains unknown. The purpose of this study was to determine the intracellufar mechanisms involved in TNF-c~ modulation of intestinal TJ barrier, using the filter-grown Caco-2 intestinal monolayers. Specifically, the role of MLCK in Caco-2 TJ barrier regulation was examined: Methods: Caco-2 TJ permeability was determined by electrical epithelial resistance or epithelial permeability to the paracelhilar markers. Results: 1) TNF-c~ produced a concentration dependent increase in Caco-2 TJ permeability and alteration in junctional localization of TJ proteins (Z0-1 and occludin). 2) TNF-a induced increase in Caco-2 TJ permeability was accompanied by an increase in MLCK expression. 3) MLCK inhibitors (ML-7 and ML-9) prevented the TNF-c~ increase in Caco-2 TJ permeability and alteration in junctional localization of TJ proteins. 4) The TNF-c~ increase in MLCK protein expression (4-6 hrs) was preceded by NF-KB activation (within 30 minutes of TNF-c~ treatmen0, suggesting that NF-KB activation may modulate MLCK expression. 5) NF-KB inhibitor curcumin prevented the TNF-c~ increase in MLCK protein expression, confirming the importance of NF-KB activation in up-regnlation of MLCK protein expression. 6) TNF-a also caused an increase in Caco-2 MLCK mRNA expression, indicating up-regulation of MLCK gene transcription process. 7) Curcumin prevented the TNF-u increase in MLCK mRNA expression, confirming the requirement of NF-KB activation in MLCK gene transcription process. Conclusion: Our findings indicate the TNF-u increase in intestinal TJ permeability is mediated by an increase in MLCK protein expression. Our data also suggest that TNF-(x increase in MLCK protein expression is dependent on TNF-a induced NF-KB activation. Based on our results, we postulate that TNF-(x activation of NF-KB leads to up-regulation of MLCK promoter activity, increase in MLCK gene transcription and protein expression, and subsequent alteration of TJ protein localization and increase in TJ permeability.",

We have recently described a novel protein, zonufin, that dictates tj competency. Structure-function analysis of the protein allowed us to enguaeer a synthetic peptide (FZI/0) that prevents zonulin binding to its target receptor. Using BB/Wor diabetic-prone (DP) rats as an animal model of T1D, we have demonstrated an increase in intrafuminal zonufin concentration compared to diabetic-resistant (DR) rats that paralleled the increase in IP and preceded the onset of T1D. Aim: To establish whether FZI/O can prevent the onset of T1D by affecting the IP. Methods: BB/'qqot~ DP rats were randomized at age 20 days into a treatment group that received drinking water plus 10 p~g/ml FZI/O in bicarbonate, and a placebo group that received only bicarbonate, In vivo 1P using Lactulose/Mannitol assay and serum zonulin and glucose levels we~ monitored every 10 days. Rats with blood glucose ->200mg/dl were considered diabe~\u00a2 and were sacrificed within 24 hours of reaching the diabetic status. The small intest~ were mounted in Ussing chambers to measure transepithelial intestinal resistance (TEER}, Measurement of intraluminal zonulin was determined by sandwich ELISA. BB/Wor DR rat~ ; were used as controls. Results: Untreated DP rats showed increased zonulin levels starti~ I at age 40 days that paralleled an increase in in vivo IP. FZI/0-treated rats also showed~ elevated zonulin serum levels, however no changes in IP where detected. Eighty percent of the untreated DP rats (12/15) and 27% of the DP FZl/0-treated rats (4/15) progressed to the diabetic state. The average age of onset of diabetes was significantly delayed in treated rats (77.5-+ 3.5 days) compared to untreated animals (69.2-+ 2.9, p = 0.048). DP rats th~ developed T1D showed a significant decrement in TEER in the ileum as compared to DR rats, while DP rats treated with FZI/0 showed a TEER that was similar to that detected i~ i DR rats. lntraluminal zonufin was significantly elevated in DP rats as compared to DR rats, :! irrespective of the FZI/O treatment. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that there is a correla~ tion between intraluminal zonulin and IP.

Howe, Colin R. Reardon, Derek M. McKay Background: Maintenance of the epithelial barrier is of primary importance in the balanct between health and disease. Transforming growth factor ~ (TGF[3) is a multifunctional cytokine with immunosuppressive and wound healing properties that is also notable as one of a small number of molecules that can enhance epithelial barrier function, by a mechanism that has yet to be defined. Aim: To determine the signaling pathway and cellular changes responsible for TGF[3-enhanced barrier function in gut epithelia. Methods: Filter-grown T84 colonic epithelial cells were exposed to TGF[3 (lOng/ml, lh or 24h) _+ pretreatment with the ERK/MAPK signahng inhibitor, PD98059 (25g, M), or infection with adenovirus encoding the inhibitory SMAD7 protein (50moi), and transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) was measured at 72h as an index of permeability. ERK/MAPK, SMAD2/3, and tight junction (TJ) protein expression was assessed by immunoblotting and TJ protein distribution visualized by confocal microscopy. Results: TGF[3 elicited a significant increase (62.0 \u00b1 16.1%) in TER 72h post-treatment (p<0.05, n = 12 monolayers) and this enhanced barrier was accompanied by increased expression of clandin-1, but not claudin-2, claudin-4, occludin, or ZO-1 as determined by western blots of whole cell protein extracts (n = 3). Corroborating these data, confocal microscopy revealed thicker bands of claudin-1 at the perimeter of TGF[3-treated ceils compared to controls. Additional western blots determined increased activation (i.e. phosphorylation) of ERK/MAPK and SMAD2/3 15 and 30min after TGF[3 exposure, respectively (n = 3), and pharmacological inhibition of ERK activation or adenoviral-induced inhibition of SMAD signaling completely prevented the TGF[3-evoked increase in epithelial barrier function (n=9-12 monolayers). Conclusion: TGF[3-enhancement of epithelial barrier is dependent on ERK/MAPK and SMAD signaling, and is likely a result of increased expression of claudin-1 at the tight junction. With immunosuppressive and barrier-enhancing roles, targeted delivery of TGF[3 may be a useful therapeutic strategy for enteropathies associated with inflammation and altered epithelial permeability.

Occludin is critical in BF, but the molecular signals underlying its modulation remain unclear. Because protein kinase C (PKC) is key in barrier permeability alterations, we sought to determine whether activation of the atypical PKC-~ &/or the novel PKC-~ modulate occhidin in monolayers of intestinal (Caco-2) cells. METH-ODS: We used unique cell clones stably transfected to ectopically-express either the PKCor PKC-8 isoforms or to inhibit their endogenous, native, expression. Clones were then preincubated with EGF or PKC modulator (OAG, a synthetic diacylglycerol) _+ oxidant H202. Wild type (WT) cells were treated similarly. We assessed: BF ~clearance~; occludin subcellufar distribution, phosphoryfation, oxidation, integrity dmmunoprecipitation, PAGE, laser confocal~q PKC-~ / ~ distribution & activity dmmunoblotting, in vitro kinase~, n = 6/ grp. RESULTS: ~A~ Relative to WT cells exposed to oxidant, clones stably over-expressing PKC-~ (2.9 fold) showed activation of -4 and protection of both BF & occludin (indicated by decreased oxidation/nitration, enhanced particulate distribution, reduced phosphorylation, increased architectural stability). PKC-~ expression induced occludin stability was OAGindependent, but EGF potentiated it. Most of the expressed PKC-~ resided in particulate (cytoskeletal) fractions along with occludin (with less than 10% in cytosol). Stable antisense inhibition PKC-~ activity (99%) prevented EGF protection of monolayer occludin 6~ BF. ~Bg In PKC-8 clones induction of over-expression by itself (3.5 fold) led to PKCactivation and instability of BF & occludin (indicated by increased oxidation/cytosohc distribntion/phosphoryfation, & decreased architectural integrity); this was comparable to that of WT cells exposed to oxidant alone. All measures of PKC-B induced instability were potentiated by oxidant. Stable dominant inactivation of native PKC-8 (99%) prevented oxidant-induced instability of ocdudin & BF. CONCLUSIONS 1) activation of PKC-~ is required for occhidin stability & BF in intestinal monolayers; 2) activation of PKC-8 causes din instability & monolayer barrier disruption; 3) The ability to alter oxidation, phoslation, and stability of occludin cytoskeleton is a novel molecular mechanism not usly attributed to these PKC isoforms in cells s23 ~/~ .Expression of Claudins in Inflammatory Bowel Disease ~hyam Prasad, Katri Kaukinen, Roberto Mingrino, Thomas MacDonald, Jane Collins !~k,rround In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) intestinal permeability is increased which ~lieved to result in inappropriate exposure of the gut immune system to bacterial flora.",

            "text": "Background: The role of PAR-2 in the colon remains unclear. Our previous data showed that both in vivo and in vitro activation of colonic PAR-2 increased paracellular permeability. On another hand, colonic resident bacteria have been shown to interact with colonocytes and intercellular tight junctions by a mechanism yet to be defined. The present study was aimed at identifying relationships between PAR-2, paraceflular permeability and resident flora in mouse colon. Methods: Ten groups of 8 Swiss mice (26-31g) were used. Groups 1 to 6 received simultaneously for 2 weeks two antibiotics in drinking water (ampicillin 0.5 g/l and neomycin 1 g/l), while groups 7-10 only received tap water. Mice were treated by tntracolonic infusion with either trypsin (400 U/mouse; 50 Izl) once (2h; groups 1, 7), twice (1\"2h and 24h; group 2), thrice (24}1, 12h, and 2h; group 3), or standardized colonic content once (2h; groups 4, 8), twice (12h, 2h; groups 5, 9) , before the end of antibiotic treatment i~nil permeability measurement. Groups 6 and 10 were controls. Colonic paracellular permeability was measured by infusing 5:Cr-EDTA into the colon (0.7 p, Ci; 0.25 ml/h; 2 hrs), and expressed as % of radioactivity recovered outside the colon. Colons were collected in all mice for PAR-2 immunochemistry. Values were expressed as the mean _+ SEM for each group. Results: In groups untreated by antibiotics, trypsin increased paracellular permeability (8.58 _+ 1.13 vs. 2.08 -+ 0.40 %; p<0.01) and one or two infusions of colonic contents had no effect (1.64 +_ 0.27 and 2.32 -+ 0.31 vs. 1.82 _+ 0.33 %, respectively). In contrast, treatment with antibiotics decreased paracellular permeability (0.81 -+ 0.20 vs. 2.12 _+ 0.13 %; p<O.01) and colonocyte PAR-2 expression, as compared with controls. In antibiotictreated mice a single infusion of trypsin or colonic contents had no effect, whereas three infusions of trypsin or two infusions of colonic contents restored paracellular permeability ( Increased intestinal permeability and endotoxemia play crucial role in the alcoholic liver disease. A significant body of evidence indicates that acetaldehyde, the metabolic product of ethanol, is accumulated in the colonic lumen after alcohol consumption. Our previous study showed that acetaldehyde disrupts tight junctions (TJ), and increases paracellular permeability in Caco-2 cell monofayer. In the present study we determined the roles of eytoskeletal reorganization and phosphorylatinn of TJ-and adherens junction (AJ)-proteins, and evaluated the protective effect of epidermal growth factor (EGF) on acetaldehydeinduced disruption of TJ. Methods: Caco-2 cells on Transwefl inserts were exposed to acetaldehyde (100-600 mM) in the absence or presence of EGF (3-30 nM) for 3-6 hr. Permeability was evaluated by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), and unidirectional flux of FITC-inulin or FITC-lipopolysaccharide (LFS). Reorganization of actin cytoskeleton and redistribution of TJ and AJ proteins were determined by confocal microscopy. Actin binding of TJ-and AJ-proteins analyzed by immunoblot analysis in isolated Factin fraction. Phosphorylation of TJ-and AJ-proteins on Tyr, Ser and Thr residues was analyzed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis. Results: EGF reduced acetaldehyde-induced reduction of TER and increase in permeability to inulin and LPS, in a timeand dose-dependent manner. EGF-mediated protection was effective both at the apical and basolateral surface, and was attenuated by AG 1478, specific inhibitor of EGF-receptor kinase. Acetaldehyde induced reorganization of actin cytoskeleton, and resulted in redistribution of occludin, ZO-1, E-cadherin and [3-catenin from the cellular junctions, and reduced the levels of occludin, ZO-1, E-cadherin and [3-catenin associated with the F-actin. EGF reduced these effects of acetaldehyde on actin cytoskeleton and TJ/AJ proteins, and their interactions. Acetaldehyde increased phosphorylation of occhidin, ZO-1, E-cadherin and [3-catenin on Tyr residues, and decreased phnsphorylation of Ser/Thr residues; and EGF prevented these effects of acetaldehyde. Conclusion: These results indicate that EGF attenuates acetaldehydeinduced disruption of TJ and AJ by reducing acetaldehyde-induced effects on the actin cytoskeleton, phosphorylation of TJ-and AJ-proteins, and release of TJ-and AJ-proteins from the actin cytoskeleton. Support by DK55532 and AA12307. In bindingcompetition experiments, cells exposed to an excess of SLIGKV-amide ligand showed a significant reduction of FZI/O immunofluorescent staining particles compared to monolayers exposed to a scrambled peptide, suggesting that FZI/O binds to a site very close to or synonymous with PAR2. Activation of PAR2 in Caco2 cells with SL1GKV-amide induced a significant intracellular cytoskeleton reorganisation in Caco2 cells that was prevented by pre-treatment with FZI/0 peptide. Addition of SLIGKV-amide to the luminal aspect of the intestine decreased TEER compared to untreated tissues and these changes were completely prevented by pretreatment with FZI/0. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that PAR-2 (or a closely related moiety) could be the target receptor for both Zot and zonulin and is involved in the regulation of intercellular tj. We have previously shown that these PG-mediated events are responsible for initiating recovery of barrier function in an in vitro porcine model of intestinal ischemia. Although the C~ secretory channel involved in these events appears to be C1C-2, the NHE isoform involved is unknown. Therefore, the present series of experiments were conducted to investigate the contribution of select NHE isoforms to recovery of barrier function. We hypothesized that PG-mediated blockade of NHE-2 and NHE-3 is responsible for recovery of barrier function in ischemia-injured ileum. Porcine ileal mucosa was subjected to 45-min of ischemia and mounted in Ussing chambers for measurement of transepithehal electrical resistance (TER) and unidirectional NaC1 fluxes. Tissues were bathed in indomethacin to block endogenous PG production, and Western analyses of NHE isoforms were performed. Blockade of NHE-2 with apical application of HOE-694 (251xM) restored TER values to control levels over a 240-min recovery period in ischemia-injured mucosa based on a 40% improvement in TER compared with tissues treated with indomethacin alone. Elevations in TER observed with blockade of NHE-2 correlated with progressive and significant reductions in mucosal-to-serosal fluxes of 22Na (JNa~). Histological evaluation of ischemia-injured tissues revealed that epithelial restitution was complete within 60 rain of mounting on Ussing chambers, indicating that the sigulficant increases in TER in the presence of HOE-694 were attributable to changes in paracellular rather than transceflular resistance. Alternatively, blockade of NHE-3 had rio effect on TER. Western blotting identified both NHE-2 and NHE-3 as proteins of approximately 85 kDa in molecular mass and both isoforms were significantly up-regulated during ischemia. Furthermore, NHE-2 and NILE-3 were predominantly expressed at the villus tips of ileal porcine mucosa by immuuoflourescence labeling. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that recovery of barrier function in the presence of PGs is likely partially attributable to blockade of NHE-2. Crohn's patients have an abnormal increase in intestinal epithelial permeability. The defect in intestinal tight junction (TJ) barrier has been proposed as an etiologic factor of Crohn's disease (CD). TNF-a produces an increase in intestinal TJ permeability. Since TNF-c\u00a2 levels are markedly increased in CD, TNF-u increase in intestinal TJ permeability could be a contributing factor of intestinal permeability defect in CD. The purpose of this study was to determine the intraceflular mechanisms involved in TNF-c\u00a2 modulation of intestinal epithelial TJ permeability, using filter-grown Caco-2 intestinal monolayers. Methods: Caco-2 TJ permeability was determined by electrical epithelial resistance or epithelial permeability to the paracellular markers. Caco-2 NF-KB activation was determined by cytoplasmic-tonuclear translocation of NF-KB p-65 using immunofluorescent antibody labeling. NF-KB binding to DNA was determined by electromobility shift assay. Results: 1) TNF-a produced a concentration-and time-dependent increase in Caco-2 TJ permeability. 2) TNF-a increase in Caco-2 TJ permeability correlated with increase in Caco-2 NF-KB activation and binding of activated NF-KB to the NF-KB binding site on DNA.",

Each fraction was also resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred, and immunoblotted with zonulin-immunoreactive, anti-Zot antibodies. Both wild type and WBB6/Ft-W/W ~ mice intestinal tissues were tested in the microsnapwell assay and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) and zonufin release from stimulated tissues determined. Results: Of the 6 fractions (F1-F6) collected and tested with zonukn ELISA, F5 contained the highest zonufin concentration. Western analysis revealed two major bands that migrated with approximate apparent Mr of 24,000 and 23,000 in the zonulin-pnsitive fraction, FS, while the zonufin-negative fractions, F1-4, and 6, each revealed only one immunoreactive band (-24 kDa). Therefore, the -23 kDa band from F5 was excised from a Comassie bluestained gel and subjected to Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption ionization mass spectrometry. Search using the Profound search engine for protein matches revealed a high similarity of this protein (estimate Z score 1.58) with the rat mast cell protease (MCP)-n. To establish whether zonulin and MCP-II are the same moiety, mierosnapwell experiments were conducted in WBB6/F1-W/W ~ mice characterized by pleiotropic defects in mucosal mast cells and, therefore, lack MCP-li. Tissues mounted in the microsnapwell system and exposed at increasing time intervals (up to 3 h) to zonufin-releasing stimuli showed a TEER decrease (A TEER= -170_ + 15.80mhs/cm2 vs -43-+ 11 in untreated tissues, p<0.001) and a parallel increase in zonulin release (10.0 \"4-0.8 ng/mg protein vs 0.2 _+ 0.7 in untreated tissues, p<0001 ) similar to that observed in stimulated wild type animals (-120 -+ 20 and i5. i \"4\" 3. i, respectively). Conclusions: zonufin is structurally and functionally similar, but not identical, to MCP-II and may represent one of the possible intestinal luminal PAR-2 activators involved in the pathophysio|og/cal regulation of intercellular tight junctions. Background : Our previous data showed that acute stress increased colonic paracellular permeability in mice through mast cell activation and IFN'y secretion by T-cells. After stresS, impairment of the epithelial gut barrier leads to excessive antigen crossing and immune stimulation, resulting from an alteration of epithelial cells and intercellular junctions. Our aims were to characterize time-related functional and molecular alterations of tight junction (TJs), and to assess changes in colonocyte differentiation following acute stress. Methods : ~,,ven groups of Swiss mice were used to investigate the colonic expression of mRNAs ~eoding for TJ proteins by means of real time RT-PCR. Each group was submitted to an ~-ute stress session consisting of contention plus acoustic stimufi for 2 hours. Colons were ~llected in groups 1 to 6 from days 1 to 6 after the stress session respectively (mice in group 7 were unstressed control) : mRNAs encoding ZO-1, ZO-2 and occludin were analyzed, the opening state of TJs was assessed by transmission electronic microscopy (TEM). ~loreover, to mimic the effects of stress, six groups of Swiss mice were treated by a mast activator (BrX-537A, 2 mg/kg ip) from days 1 to 6 before the colon collection. Alkaline ~osphatase (AP) activity, a marker of colonocyte differentiation, was assayed on mucosal klmples, and morphological alterations were determined on colon sections (Duboscq-Brazil ILV, ation and hemalun-eosin stain). Results : Three days after stress session, expression of ~INA encoding occludin and ZO-2 was decreased by 60% (0.44 _+ 0.08 vs. 1.04 -+ 0.11 itbitrary unit, p<0.05) and 43% (0.62 + 0.06 vs. 1.05 _+ 0.14, p<0.05) respectively, ~ompared with controls ; no significant decrease for ZO-I was observed and TEM showed that TJs were more leaky than in controls. Morphological examination of colons after BrX-.~87A, showed loss of epithelial integrity and submucosal edema after three days. Finally, activity decreased progressively from days 1 to 3, then dramatically increased on day 4 {549.5 + 71.9 vs. 217.8 _+ 38.0 mU/mg protein, p<0.01). Conclusion : We conclude that acute stress had initiated a postponed (3 days) deleterious effect on intestinal barrier through functional alterations of TJs. Thus, the increase of paraceflular permeability resulting from TJs modification, and the associated impaired colonocyte differentiation may both explain this long-term effect. Our previous studies demonstrate that PGE2 stimulates recovery of ischemic-injured porcine ileum by a mechanism involving reductions in paracellular permeability rather than increases in restitution. Furthermore, the signaling mechanism for this response centers on PGE2-Iladuced CI-secretion. Interestingly, this restorative, secretory event appears to be mediated ~K~lely through C1C-2 CI channels. The latter finding is based on Ussing chamber studies in which selective blockade of CIC-2 Cl channels in ischemia-injured porcine ileum prevented ~\u00a2overy of barrier function whereas blockade of CFTR and outwardly rectified Cl channels had no effect despite exhibiting marked reductions in C1 secretion. Given the critical role oIC1C-2 in the restoration of intestinal barrier function, we conducted a series of experiments to investigate the expression and localization patterns of ClC-2 Cl channels in ischemiainjured porcine ileum. Porcine ileal mucosa was subjected to 45-min of ischemia and prepared for immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry techniques. SDS-PAGE was performed on tissue protein extracts and ClC-2 immuno-precipitates from control (non-iscbemic) and /Schemia-injured porcine ileal tissues. Co -immunoprecipitation experiments were performed on immunoprecipitated C1C-2 extracts that were probed with an occludin antibody. Immunofloureseence and immunogold labeling experiments were also performed. C1C-2 was expressed as a single protein band of approximately 90 to 97 kDa in molecular mass. A significant up-regulation of C1C-2 was observed in ischemia-injured ileal tissues compared with controls measured by quantitative densitometry, whereas as CFTR was down-regulated in the same tissues, lmmunogold electron microscopy revealed that C1C-2 is localized to the tight junction of intestinal epithelial ceils recovering from ischemia injury. Furthermore, immunofluorescence indicated that CIC-2 is localized predominantly in the apical aspect of the interepithelial region in recovering mucosal villi, and to a lesser extent in the mucosal crypts. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that occludin, a protein expressed exclusively in the tight junction, was expressed in C1C-2 immunoprecipitates. The localized expression of CIC-2 Cl channels to the tight junctions suggests that signaling events initiated by PGE2 activation of this transporter initiates recovery of paracellular resistance noted in our previous studies.",

In rats, IP administration of LPS from E.Coli causes rectal allodynia. This study aimed to evaluate whether the LPSiaduced increase in colonic permeability is linked to epithelial cell cytoskeleton contraction and wether rectal LPS-induced allodynia results from the alteration of permeability. Methods: First, 4 groups of 10 male Wistar rats equipped ~vith an intracolonic catheter received respectively, vehicle (controls), LPS from E.coli O11 l:B4 ( lmg/kg IF), ML-7 (a MLCK inhibitor; 3xlmg/kg/48h; 1F) prior to LPS, injection and ML-7 alone. Colonic permeability was mea-SUred by intracolonic injection of 51Cr-EDTA (250~L, 0.7p.Ci) and expressed as percent of radioactivity collected in the urine for 6h. Secondly, abdominal contractions (criteria of visceral pain) were assessed in rats equipped with intramuscular NiCr wire electrodes. Rectal distension was performed (0.4 to 1.2mL) 3h after LPS administration, in rats pretreated or not with ML-7. Thirdly, for all treatments, western blotting of the phosphorylated MLC and tight junction electron microscopy examination of the colonic epithelium were performed. Results: LPS increased the 0-6h colonic permeability of 5tCr-EDTA from 0.74_+0.08% in Controls to 1.56 -+ 0.18% (P<0.05). ML-7 significantly attenuated this effect (0.99 -+ 0.14,\u00b06; P>0.05 vs. control). LPS promoted a delayed (3h) rectal aflodynia, increasing the number of abdominal cramps from 6.3 _+ 1.2 in controls to 16.9 _+ 1.7 contractions/5min at the lowest volume of distension. ML-7 prevented this rectal allodynia (9.8_+ 1.4 contractions/5min; P<0.05). Electron microscopy showed LPS-induced alterations of tight-junction integrity (1.7 + 1.1% in controls vs. 16.7 _+ 3.1%; P<0.05) associated with increase of the phosphorylated form of MLC in LPS treated rats; these effects were abolished by ML-7 (3.7+-2.9%; P<0.05). For all measured parameters, ML-7 has not effect per se. Conclusion: In rats, LPSinduced allodynia to distension results from increased paraceflular permeability, an effect linked to LPS-induced activation of MLCK and phosphorylation of MLC, resulting in tightjunction opening.",

However, no link has been estabhshed between the two pathophysiological events. The aim of this study was to determine in rats i) whether blockade of the stress-induced increase in colonic paraceflular permeability can reduce the concomitant hypersensitivity to colonic distension; ii) the role of epithelial cell cytoskeleton contraction in the effect of stress on permeability and subsequent hypersensitivity. Methods : Eight groups of 8 female Wistar rats were equipped with an intracolonic (IC) catheter or HiCr wire electrodes in to the abdominal striated muscles. All rats were submitted to partial restraint stress (PRS : 2h; groups 2, 4, 6, 8) or sham stress (groups 1,3, 5, 7). TAP (2,4,6-triaminopyrimidine, 100mM), a tight junction chemical blocker, or vehicle was infused 1 hour (0.5 mL/h) before and during PRS or sham stress (groups 1, 2, 5, 6). ML-7, a myosin light chain kinase inhibitor (MLCK; 1 mg/kg i.p.) was injected three times at 12 h interval before PRS or sham stress (groups 3, 4, 7, 8) . Groups 1 to 4 were submitted to progressive rectal distension (RD) in stepwise volumes (0.4-1.2 mL) 20 rain after PRS session or sham stress. Groups 5 to 8 received SlCr-EDTA (250~,L; 0.7 I.LCi IC) after PRS or sham and colonic permeability was assessed by measuring the radioactivity in 24h post-stress urine collection. Results : PRS increased colonic permeability (2.2_+ 0.2 vs. 1.2 _+ 0.1%) and the number of abdominal contractions for all volumes of RD (e.g. 0.8 mL: 28 + 2 vs. 13 + 1 contractions/5 min) compared to sham. TAP suppressed the stress-induced increase in colonic permeability (0.8+0.1 vs. 2.2_+0.2 %) and sensitivity to colonic distension (e.g. 0.8 mL : 18-+2 vs. 28-+ 2 contractions/5 rain). Similarly, ML-7 blocked the stress-induced increase in colonic paracellular permeability (1.2 + 0.2 vs. 2.2 _+ 0.2 96) and sensitivity (e.g. 0.8 mL : 14 + 2 vs. 28-+ 2 contractions/5 min). Treatment by TAP and ML-7 had no effect per se on both permeability and sensitivity in the absence of stress. Conclusion : Our data show that the increase of colonic permeability induced by acute stress is responsible of stress-induced rectal hypersensitivity and results from epithelial cell cytoskeleton contraction through activation of MLCK. Consequently MLCK inhibitor may represent a promising treatment of post-infections IBS.",

            "text": "Potential Mechanisms Underlying Genistein-lnduced Changes in Intestinal Cell Dynamics in the Neonatal Piglet Intestine An-Chian Chen, Sharon M. Donovan Currently 15% of U.S. infants are fed soy formula containing up to 14 mg genistein/L. Our goal was to investigate the impact of oral genistein on neonatal intestinal development. Piglets (n=24) were fed formula (CON) alone or containing 1 (LG) or 14 mg/L genistein (HG) for 10 d. Cellular proliferation in the jejunal crypts was reduced 50% (p = 0.001) and enterocyte migration was reduced 20% (p=0.1) in piglets fed the HG formula. Estrogen receptor B (ERB), which are expressed in the small intestine, have a high affinity for genistein. Jejunal ERB mRNA expression was 5096 lower (p = 0.05) in the HG group compared to the LG group, but neither was significantly different from CON. Genistein signaling for cell proliferation involves the protein tyrosine kinase, src. Genistein is a potent and specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which can potentiafly inhibit src activity and lead to the observed decrease in prohferation in the jejunal crypt cells. The protein abundance of c-src and phospho-src (Tyr416) were determined by immunoblotting. No difference in the abundance of either protein was observed among the treatment groups. However, the lack of difference may have been impacted by the timing of intestinal sample collection relative to the feeding of geinstein (2-4h), as differences in c-src phosphorylation are detected within minutes in vitro. Lastly, we investigated whether the trend in suppressed enterocyte migration in the HG group was due to a change in trefoil factor expression, as this protein promotes cell migration and is inducible by estrogen. ITF expression in the jejunum and ileum were not significantly different among the groups. SP/TFF2 expression in the stomach was 30% lower (p=0.05) in both geinstein groups compared to CON. In summary, genistein at the concentration present in soy formula detrimentally impacts intestinal cell dynamics and down-regulates jejunal ERB mRNA expression in the neonatal small intestine. (Funded by the State of Illinois through the Council on Food and Agricultural Research). Expression of intestinal amino acid and peptide transporters is subject to regulation by substrate availability, including manipulations of dietary protein intake. Enterocytes utilise significant proportions of absorbed amino acids and may influence adaptive responses. To determine how intestinal expression is affected by removal of dietary nutrients, we have studied mRNA expression for a series of nine transporters for amino acids and peptides in nutritionally maintained rats with no oral intake. The transporters illustrate varying patterns of expression along the longitudinal axis of the intestine and varying localisation to luminal and basolateral plasma membrane domains. The role of the specific intestinotrophic hormone, GLP-2, in the responses has been investigated. Groups of rats, six animals/group, were maintained on total parenteral nutrition (TPN) or TPN + GLP-2, while control animals were orally-fed, mRNA abundance of the transporters was determined in proximal and distal small intestine mucosa using semi-qnantitative RT-PCR and in Caco-2 cells grown in the presence or absence of GLP-2. In proximal small intestine, absence of dietary nutrients specifically increased expression of ASCF1, SAT2 and GLYT1 mRNAs. ASCT2, EAAC1, NBAT and PepT1 mRNA abundance was increased only in distal small intestine. CAT-1 and SN2 mRNA abundances were unaffected. GLP-2 reversed these effects. In Caco-2 cells, GLP-2 decreased expression of ASCT1, ASCT2 and GLYT1 but not PepT1. In the absence of a luminal amino acid supply, the enterocyte adapts to maximise amino acid uptake to meet its own requirements. Three sub-groups of transporters have been identified by differences in response to TPN. This may reflect differing roles for substrates of transporters located apically and basally and along the proximal-distal axis of the intestine. GLP-2 reduced transporter expression in TPN-fed rats and in Caco-2 cells, possibly through direct effects on enterocytes. The importance of maintaining amino acid supply for intestinal mucosal function is illustrated.",

Background: Short chain fatty acids (SCFA) are absorbed by the enterocytes in the small intestine. Little is known of the effect of small intestinal motor activity on SCFA absorption. The aim of our study was to investigate the relationship between spatiotemporal characteristics of postprandial duodenal motor activity and absorption of the SCFA octanoic acid, using micromanometry and the nC-octanoic acid breath test (OBT). Materials and Methods: Duodenal manometry was performed in 15 healthy volunteers (8 women and 7 men, median age 26 yr, range 20-60 ),i.), using a catheter incorporating 12 duodenal side holes spaced at 1.5-cm intervals. A mixed nutrient liquid was administered intradnodenafly (90 kcal total), followed by 100 mg octanoic acid, labeled with nC, dissolved in 1 ml water, given as a bolus. Pressures were recorded for 60 rain after infusion of the octanoic acid. The nC-OBT was performed simultaneously, with breath samples taken every 15 minutes. Recovery of nC in the breath samples was a measure for the absorption of octanoic acid. In manometric analysis, 4 periods of 15-rain were analyzed and data of duodenal side holes was clustered in 3 clusters, each covering 4.5 cm. Results: The median time of peak excretion of nCO2 was 20 min (range 12.5-30), with a median absorption rate of 0.22 micromol/min (range 0.12-0.29). The absorption rate of octanoic acid was related to the mean amplitude of duodenal pressure waves (duodenal PW) in the second cluster (r = 0.36, P = 0.006). During the first 15 rain after infusion of octanoic acid, the recovery of uC was related to the mean amplitude of duodenal PW in each cluster, the relation being stronger in the most proximal clusters (resp. r = 0.43, P = 0.001; r = 0.51, P<0.001) than in the distal cluster (r = 0.26, P<0.05). Number of duodenal PW was not related to the absorption of SCFA, either in time or in place. Conclusion: Mean amplitude of the duodenal PW influences the amount of absorption and the absorption rate of SCFA during the first 15 rain of availability of the SCFA. No relation was observed between the number of duodenal PW and SCFA absorption.",

In the fasted state, the FCR for WT and CD36-/-was18.84 _+ 3.06 and 11.96 _+ 5.01 pools/hr, respectively (p=O.O02). An experiment with Triton WR-1339, a compound that obliterates TGRP hydrolysis, was performed to determine whether hydrolysis affects TGRP uptake by CD36. Injection with Triton WR-1339 resulted in a significant decrease in TG hydrolysis in both WT and CD36-/leading to decreased TGRP uptake However, a proportional decrease in FCR of 35% in WT and CD36-/-in experiments with and without Triton WR-1339 supports the hypothesis that uptake of TGRP by CD36 is independent of TG hydrolysis. Data showed higher uptake of TGRP in the heart; however, this only occurred in the fed state. Collectively, there was a trend of greater TGRP uptake in WT than CD36-/-in muscle and adipose tissues (3867 vs. 3301 counts per minutes (CPM)/g tissue in muscle and 5691 vs.4292 CPM/g tissue in adipose tissues, respectively). These results strongly indicate a novel role of CD36 in chylomicron clearance and tissue-targeting. Background and aims: Iron absorption has been attributed to the activity of a highly regulated iron uptake pathway localised to duodenum. However, only 10% of dietary iron is absorbed in the duodenum meaning that 90% reaches distal small intestine and colon. Recent work has led to the identification of several genes for this uptake pathway in mice and humans. Fe3 +, which is main dietary iron form in the lumen of the gut, must be reduced to Fe2 + form by duodenal ferric reductase (Dcytb) to be taken up by enterocytes. Fe2 + is then transported across the apical membrane of enterocytes by DMT1 (divalent metal transporter). lregl is responsible for the basolateral transport of iron into body. The expression of these genes is mainly localised within the small intestine to duodenum and proximal jejunum. However, the localization and function of these genes in the large intestine are not fully understood. We therefore investigated the cellular localisation and regulation of expression of these genes in mouse caecum and colon. Methods: For quantification of the expression of the target genes, i.e., Dcytb, DMT1 and Iregl, RT-PCR was carried out by means of the LightCycler (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Penzberg, Germany), using RNA extracted from iron deficient and hypoxic mouse large intestine, compared to controls. Protein localisation and regulation of those genes was measured by immunohistochemistry using frozen sections of large intestine from the same mice. Results: Dcytb mRNA was expressed at very low levels in large intestine, compared to duodenum; In contrast, DMT1 and Iregl mRNAs were expressed at significant levels in large intestine and were increased in iron deficient caecum, proximal and distal colon with the most significant increases seen in distal colon. Hypoxia increased Iregl expression in proximal colon. By immunohistochemistry, significant levels of Iregl were detected in basolateral membrane of colonic epithelial cells, in contrast, Dcytb and DMT1 were virtually undetectable on the apical membrane of colonic enterocytes. Conclusion: We conclude that colonic epithelial cells express basolateral lregl and are capable of regulated iron transport. However, Dcytb and DMT1 were virtually undetectahle, indicating that the uptake pathway for iron in the colon may differ from that m the duodenum. Iron absorption by the colon may be important in determining both whole body and colonic epithelial levels of iron.",

Ghishan Introduction: Inorganic phosphate (Pi) is necessary for many homeostatic mechanisms in mammals, Thus, understanding intestinal absorption of dietary Pi is of great importance. To date, the NaPi-llh cotransporter is the only known Pi transporter in the small intestine. We hypothesize that there are unidentified genes involved in small intestinal Pi transport and in homeostatic regulation of Pi metabolism. Therefore, the current studies were designed to identify novel genes involved in phosphate homeostasis and intestinal transport in mice. Methods: 3-week-old C57BL6 mice were placed on high (0.45 %) or low (0,02%) Pi containing diets for 3 weeks. The mice were sacrificed (5 per group) and intestinal mucosa was harvested from the proximal half of the small intestine for RNA purification by Trizol reagent. Total RNA samples were processed according to standard protocols to produce cDNA then cRNA; cRNA was hybridized to mouse genome expression arrays (Affymetrix; 430A). Arrays were washed, stained and scanned, and the resulting data was analyzed with Affymetrix software. The experiment was repeated two times with different animal groups. Results: Data analysis revealed that 75 genes increased expression 2-fold with dietary Pi deprivation, while 70 genes exhibited a 2-fold decrease in expression, Quality control parameters, established by Affymetrix, were within acceptable ranges, Interestingly, genes involved in Ca ion transport (Inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor 1), cholesterol and fatty acid transport (ABCA1, Fatty Acid Binding Protein), metabolism (UDP-glucoronosyhransferase) and apoptosis (Clusterln) were among the significant changers with this treatment. In addition, a number of genes implicated in signal transduction pathways also showed changes in transcript expression (Cholecystokinin A receptor, Ramp2). Discussion: The mouse 430A array allows for the simultaneous analysis of over 14,000 well-established genes. Our study revealed a significant number of differentially expressed genes with dietary Pi deprivation. Of particular interest are genes pertaining to nutrient transport, which suggest the existence of novel pathways involved with the regulation of intestinal Pi homeostasis and transport. This investigation was supported by NIH grant R01-DK33209-20. Introduction Many genes are expressed in the human small intestine. Genome-wide microarray technology provides a sophisticated tool to obtain general information about all processes that are under genetic control. No data are available about genome-wide gene expression profiles in the human small intestine, or about the ability to regulate biochemical processes on the transcriptome level by nutritional interventions. Methods Eight volunteers (22 +/-2 y) were tested on two separate occasions. After an overnight fast, duodenal biopsies, taken in the horizontal part of the duodenum (15 cm distally from the pylorus), were obtained by gastroduodenoscopy. Subsequently, a perfusion catheter was inserted into the proximal small intestine with an injection port located in the proximal descending duodenum. After positioning, a 40-cm segment of the proximal small intestine was perfused with saline and, after reaching steady state, with either 80 or 400 mg iron as ferrous gluconate for 30 rain. Finally, saline was perfused for another 60 rain. A second duodenoscopy was performed to obtain tissue samples after the iron challenges. Gene expression profiles in the tissue samples were measured using Affyraetrix U133A microarray chips (~ 20.000 mapped genes). Information about biological processes affected by the iron challenges were investigated using GenMAPP software (http://www.GenMAPP.org). Results Among 8542 genes expressed in the baseline tissue samples, 28 genes were statistically increased by 125 and 157 % after administration of the low-and high iron dose, respectively, whereas 61 genes were significantly downregulated by 170 and 201%, respectively. Furthermore, 293 genes tended to be mediated by the iron challenges. GenMAPP analysis revealed that both iron challenges strongly mediated a number of processes, which were mainly associated with signal transduc* tion. Conclusion The microarray technology profiles provides a useful tool to generate research hypotheses to design further studies to largely unknown phenomena, such as the response of intestinal mucosa on nutrient interventions. The biological implication of microarrray results will have to be investigated in additional, dedicated experiments.",

            "text": "9enss changed/measured cell cycle 8/9 GPCRs, class C 3/5 calcium channels The traditional Japanese diet, containing high levels offish and soy, is associated with a low risk of colorectal cancer. There is good epidemiological evidence to support a protective effect of fish and the protective effects of HRT treatment suggest that estrogen like compounds may also be beneficial. Both oestrogen receptor (ER) \u00a2t and [3 are expressed in the colon but ER [3 is the predominant form, and that to which phytooestrogens preferentially bind. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of fish oil and soy isoflavonoid phytoestrogens on mitosis and apoptosis, and on the expression of ER ct and IB in colonic mucosa. Method: Female Sprague Dawley rats were exposed to a diet containing soy extract (0.5g/100g dry wt), rich in isoflavonoids ( 15g/100g dry wt of extract) or menhaden oil (40g/kg diet) for a period of two weeks. Apoptosis and mitosis were assessed in microdissected isolated crypts as described previously. Expression of the oestrogen receptors and the 'housekeeper gene' GAPDH was determined by RT-PCR, using Taqman. Results: Both fish oil and soy isotlavonoids significantly reduced c/ypt ceil proliferation, but only fish oil increased apoptosis. Furthermore, both diets resulted in decreased expression of ER u gene (fish oil 50% and soy isoflavone 75% reduction) and a three fold increase in expression of ER [~ gene as compared to control animals. Conclusion: An up-regulation of ER [3 gene is associated with anti-proliferative effects in colorectal cancer cells and thus might be predicted to be protective in relation to development of colorectal cancer. The role of ER c~ in the colon is uncertain although down-regulation might reduce the protective effects of estradiol in colorectal carcinogenesis. However, a better understanding of the relative importance of ER c~ and ER [3 in the aetiology of colorectal cancer is required before extrapolation to predict effect on colorectal cancer risk. Increased intestinal permeability and endotoxemia play crucial role in alcoholic liver disease. A significant body of evidence indicates that acetaldehyde, the metabolic product of ethanol, is accumulated in the colonic lumen after alcohol consumption. Our previous study showe~t that acetaldehyde disrupts YJ and increases paracelluiar permeability in Caco-2 cell monolayer. In the present study we evaluated the protective effect of L-glutamine on acetaldehydeinduced cytoskeletal reorganization and phosphorylation of TJ-and adherens junction (AJ)proteins, and the disruption of TJ. Methods: Caco-2 cells on Transwell inserts were exposed to acetaldehyde (100-600 txM) in the absence or presence of L-glutamine (0.3-3 raM) for 3-6 hr. Permeability was evaluated by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance (TER), and unidirectional flux of inulin or LPS (endotoxin). Reorganization of actin cytoskeleton and redistribution of TJ-and AJ-pmteins were determined by confocal microscopy. Actin binding of TJ-and AJ-pruteins analyzed by immunoblot analysis in isolated F-actin fractions. Phosphorylation of TJ-and AJ-proteins on Tyr, Ser and Thr residues was analyzed by immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis. Results: Acetaldehyde reduced TER and increased permeability to inulin and LPS, which were reduced by L-glutamine (but not by D-glutamine) in a time-and dose-dependent manner, and this protective effect of glntamine was unaffected by glutaminase inhibitor, l.-Aspargine, L-arginine, L-lysine and L-alanine showed no significant protection from acetaldehyde. L-Glutamine prevented acetaldehydeinduced reorganization of actin cytoskeleton and redistribution of occludin, ZO-1, E-cadherin and [3-cateinn from the cellular junctions, and prevented the reduction of the levels of occludin, ZO-I, E-cadherin and ~-catenin associated with the F-actin. L-glutamine also reduced acetaldehyde-induced increase in phosphorylation of occludin, ZO-1, E-cadherin and [~-catenin on Tyr residues and decrease in phosphorylation on Ser/Thr residues. Conclusion: These results indicate that L-glntamlne attenuates acetaldehyde-induced disruption of TJ and AJ by reducing acetaldehyde-induced reorganization of actin cytoskdeton, the changes in phosphorylation of E-cadherin, [3-catenin, occludin and ZO-1, and release of TJ-and AJproteins from F-actin. Support by DK55532 and AA12307. , monitoring of esophageal body and LES pressure by an infused catheter system with a Dent sleeve (Amdorfer Inc, USA), and monitoring of esophageal pH 5 cm above the LES with a micro-glass pH meter (Microelectrode Inc,, USA). Serum levels of glucose, insulin, and gastrin were measured at 15-rain intervals for 1 hour and at 30-min intervals for 3.5 hours after ingestion of the ENS (400 kcal/400 ml) labeled with 100 mg of 13C sodium acetate (Cambridge Isotope Laboratories Inc., USA). Breath samples were automatically and continuously obtained through an exclusive nasal cannula for 4 hours after ingestion of the test meal. To increase ENS viscosity, 90 g of low methyl-ester pectin was ingested after the entera! solution, and the same study was repeated in the same subjects on another day. Results: After adding pectin, gastric emptying coefficient determined by the 13C breath test (3.00 +/-0.20 vs. 2.72 +/-0.20, mean +/-SE) and the motility index of the gastric antrum measured by manometry (553 +/-318 vs. 22.5 +/-15.8) were significantly (p<0.05) higher until 1 hour after ingestion than without pectin, In both studies, the peak gastrin level was 15 rain after ingestion and it decreased again by 60 rain. insulin, glucose, and the insulogenic index did not differ in both studies. Conclusions: Gastric amral motility was lower in the absence of pectin. When ENS viscosity was increased by adding pectin, gastric emptying was enhanced with an increase of antral motility. Increased viscosity might inhibit rapid flow of an ENS into the duodenum after ingestion, which can inhibit gastric motility via duodeno-gastric feedback rather than a change of the gastrin level. . Recently, SGLT-3, a member of the SGLT family that binds glucose with a high Kd but does not transport it across the membrane, has been identified as a putative glucose sensor in the intestine (Diez-Sampedro et al., PNAS, 2003) . The specific aim of this study was to determine the rule of SGLT-3 in mediating glucosedependent 5-HT release and intestinal secretion. Methods: 1. The human BON cell line, a model of EC cells, was used to determine the cellular mechanism of 5-HT release. Changes in intracellular calcium were measured in response to glucose (25 and 75 mM) using Fura-2 on monolayers of cells. SGLT-3 mRNA was measured by Taqman real time PCR. 2. Intestinal secretion was measured by the change in weight of a 2.5% agamse cylinder inserted into the terminal ileum of anesthetized rats; secretion was measured in response to glucose, c~-methyl-glucose (a non-metabolizable glucose analog), galactose (substrate for SGLT-1 but not SGLT-3), or mannitol (1 mmole, 15 min pretreatment PO, n=5-8 in each group). Results: 1. Glucose increased intracellular calcium at 75 mM (change in ratio 340/380 rim; 0.28 -+ 0.05, n=4), but not 25 mM glucose. SGLT-3 mRNA signal was detected in BON cells. 2. Glucose caused a significant decrease in ileal fluid absorption compared to vehicle treatment (0.5 _+ 0.6 vs. 4.8 _+ 1.2 ~l/cm2/hr, p < 0.005). a-Me-glucose also caused a significant decrease in fluid absorption (1.2 _+ 0.3 vs. 4.8 _+ 1.2 l*l/cm2/hr p < 0.05), whereas mannitol and galactose had no significant effect on ileal secretion. Conclusion: Glucose-mediated release of 5-HT involves SGLT-3. SGLT-3 is a candidate for the regulation of 5-HT release from EC cells and may play a key role in nutrient sensing in the gut. Diets that are high in glucose may exacerbate diarrhea and/or constipation associated with IBS and IBD which may result from a chronic mismatch between 5-HT signaling and the ability of the intestinal mucosa to mount an appropriate secretory and motility response to dietary sugars. The effects of fat on appetite, gastrointestinal (GI) motility and the secretion of GI hormones, including cholecystokinin (CCK) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) may be critically dependent on the chain length of fatty acids released during lipolysis. We postulated that duodenal administration of lauric acid (12 carbon atoms, C12) would suppress appetite, modulate antmpylomduodenal (APD) pressure waves (PWs) and stimulate the release of CCK and GLP-1 to a greater extent than decanoic acid (10 carbon atoms, C10). 7 healthy men (19 -47 years) were studied on three separate days in a double-blind, randomised fashion. Appetite perceptions, APD PWs, and plasma CCK and GLP-1 concentrations were measured during a 90 min intraduodenal infusion of (i) C12, (ii) CIO or (iii) control (rate: 2 ml/min; 0.375 kcal/min for C12 and CIO, total amount: 34 kcal (142 kJ)). Energy intake was quantified at a buffet meal, offered immediately after completion of the infusion. C12, but not C10, suppressed both appetite perceptions (P < 0.05) and energy intake (P = 0.002, Figure) . C12, but not CIO, induced nausea (P = 0.01). C12 stimulated basal pyloric pressure (peak pressure (change from baseline; mmHg): C12:4.9 +/-1.0, C10:0.9 +/-0.9, control: -0.5 +/-1.8) and isolated pyloric PWs (P < 0.05 for both) and suppressed antral and duodenal PWs, compared with control (P < 0.05 for both). C10 transiently stimulated isolated pyloric PWs (P = 0.037), had no effect on antral PWs, but markedly stimulated duodenal PWs (P = 0.012). Both C12 and C10 increased plasma CCK (P < 0.05; peak conc (pmol/l): C12:13.4 +/-1.7, CIO: 8.8 +/-1.2, control: 3.7 +/-0.6), but the effect of C12 was substantially greater (P = 0.001). C12 also stimulated GLP-1, whereas CIO did not (P < 0.05; peak conc (pmol/l): C12:23.3 +/-4.5, C10:11.9 +/-1.3, control: 9.6 +/-1.0). We conclude that there are major differences in the effects of intraduodenally administered C12 and C10 on appetite, energy intake, APD PWs and gut hormone release in humans. These observations may have important implications for the use of C12 as an appetite suppressant. Background Disordered gastrointestinal function, including gastroparesis, occurs frequently in both type 1 and type-2 diabetes. Acute changes in blood glucose concentration have a major effect on gastrointestinal motor and sensory function in diabetes. It is likely that many of the motility disturbances and gastrointestinal symptoms associated with diabetes are mediated by sensory pathways in the vagus nerves that detect glucose in the proximal small intestine and circulation (via the hepatic portal vein) and signal this to the brain stem. The anatomical and molecular components that constitute the intestinal glucosensor are currently unknown. Aims To determine the localization and pattern of candidate molecules involved in sensing glucose in the duodenum and hepatic portal vein. Methods In rats, dual-label immunoh/stochemistry was performed for the glucose transporter GLUT2 and SURI (the sulfonylurea receptor component of the pancreatic KA~ potassium channel complex) in the duodenum, hepatic portal vein, pancreas and tongue, sites known or suspected to detect glucose in the periphery. Anterograde tracing (Dil) was performed from the nodose ganglion to assess vagal innervation of the rat duodenum and hepatic portal vein. Results In 8 rats we confirmed the labelling of GLUT2 and SUR1 antibodies in specific populations of pancreatic 13-islet ceils. We further demonstrated the presence of GLUT2 in the apical and basolateral membrane of the duodenal epithelium. PGP9.5 labelled nerve fibers in the duodenal lamina propria were shown to label for SUR1; these are likely to be extrinsic vagal or spinal sensory nerves as they also labelled for the sensory peptide CGRP. Anterograde tracing showed vagal endings in close proximity to the duodenal lumen and within the endothelium of the hepatic portal vein. Conclusions These observations suggest that glucose may activate duodenal sensory nerves by closing Kate potassium channels -a novel mechanisn~ that has not been considered so far in peripheral nerves. The initial point in the glucose sensing pathway on these sensory nerves remains to be characterised. Anterograde tracing results strongly suggest that hepatic sensory fibres sample venous blood directly (and possibly glucose content) without intervening cell types, in contrast to what is currently believed. Background: IgE mediated food allergy (FA) results in a Th2 driven inflammation, causing loss of gut mucosal integrity and elevated intestinal permeability. The aim of this study was to investigate, if increases in permeability correlate with the allergenic potency of different alIergens in sensitized and challenged animals. Methods: In an established model of FA, rats (Brown Norway males, 4-6 weeks old) were systemically sensitized to peanut (P), or spinach ribulose extract (SR) food proteins and orally challenged twice with the correspondent protein after 14 days. Control animals were treated with PBS. One hour after allergen challenge, intestinal permeability was measured by a lactulose / mannitol test. The animals received the sugar probe molecules by gavage feeding; urine recovery was quantified using HPLC with pulsed electrochemical detection. To assess allergen-induced immune responses, total and allergen specific lgE levels in serum and in vitro proliferate responses of spleen MNC to allergen/mitogen stimulation were determined. Results: Despite the absence of gastrointestinal clinical symptoms the intestinal permeability was significantly increased by two fold in P sensitized and challenged animals as compared to PBS control (lactulose/ mannitol ratio (PI) 0.301 +/-0.099 vs. 0.174 +A 0.019). SR resulted in a moderate but also significant increase of PI (0.254 +/-0.044). The data corresponded well to the degree of aflergeincity of P and SR observed in the present model. Allergen sensitization of the animals resulted in an enhanced total IgE serum level. We found a significant increase in total IgE levels of peanut sensitized animals, as compared to PBS control (total IgE 20.3 +/-4.4 versus 3.4 +/-1.5 mg/dl), but only a small difference between the P and SR groups (total IgE 20.3 +A 4.4 versus 13.6 +/-3.2). Furthermore a considerable level of specific IgE was induced in P sensitized animals (45.7 +/-1.8 LU/ml). Re-stimulation of spleen MNC with the corresponding allergen resulted in an increased proliferative response in animals sensitized with peanut, but not with SR. Conclusions: In vivo measurement of the intestinal permeability is a sensitive parameter to assess early barrier dysfunctions after induction of lgE mediated FA and my help to estimate the allergenic potency of an alIergen Background: It is unknown whether gastric volume response to feeding is influenced by meal consistency. Aims: To compare gastric volume responses to isocaloric liquid or mixed (solid-liquid) meals and document the intra-and inter-individual reproducibility of gastric volume measurement using SPECT imaging after i.v. 9~Tc-pertechnetate. Methods: Eight healthy volunteers each participated in 3 studies. Gastric volumes were measured in response to ingestion of a 317-kcal liquid nutrient meal on 2 occasions at least 9 months apart. Within 2 weeks of the second liquid meal study, the participants underwent a third study of gastric volume in response to a 317-kcal mixed meal. The order of the mixed and second liquid meals was randomized. Paired t test compared the gastric volumes after the mixed or liquid isocaloric meals. Results: Fasting and postprandial gastric volumes associated with the two liquid meals were not significantly different ( Gastroparesis frequently limits nutrition in the critically ill. The underlying gastroduodenal motor dysfunction is poorly defined, but assumed to reflect gastric pump failure. The potential contribution of increased small intestinal (SI) feedback is unknown. The aims of this study were to determine the effects of gastric and submaximal 81 nutrient infusion on antro-pyloro-duodenal (APD) motility and gastric emptying in the critically ill. APD pressures were recorded in 12 mechanically ventilated patients (age 60 +/-4 yr, APACHE 1I score 16 (12-23)) and 10 healthy volunteers (age 25 +/-2 yr) using a 16 channel manometric assembly incorporating a sleeve sensor for measurement of pyloric pressure. Readings were made during fasting (6h), SI infusion of Ensure (lkcal/ml; 50ml/h; 6h) and following a gastric bolus of lO0ml Ensure (4h). Gastric emptying of intragastric Ensure was measured using a C13 octanoate breath test and the gastric emptying coefficient (GEC) was calculated. Study periods were randomised. Volunteers were studied on 3 separate days. The frequency of antral, localised pyloric, duodenal pressure waves and phase 3 activity was determined.",

            "text": "Analysis was by mixed model ANOVA. Results are summarised in the table. In volunteers, neither gastric nor Sl nutrient affected APD motility compared to fasting values, confirming that the nutrient dose was submaximal. Antral motility was decreased under all conditions in patients compared to healthy subjects. SI nutrient stimulated pyloric pressure waves in patients, and the frequency was greater than in the healthy subjects. Phase 3 activity was decreased by SI nutrient infusion in the volunteers but not in the critically ill. Gastric emptying was slower in patients, and inversely related to pyloric pressure wave frequency (r-0.78, p = 0.005). We conclude that in the critically ill: 1. the regulation of fasting APD motility is impaired; 2. increased small intestinal sensitivity to nutrients may contribute to delayed gastric emptying. Background: Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) is a common symptom in children and adolescents. RAP in children is poorly characterized. Aims: To measure the prevalence of RAP among children in the community and describe the clinical constellation and natural history of RAP. Methods: After informed consent, children attending two middle schools and one elementary school, with their parents, completed a standardized questionnaire concerning socioeconomic parameters and abdominal pain intensity, frequency, duration,, nature of RAP and possible relationships with school activities, eating pattern, and other upper gastrointestinal symptoms. Each child reported abdominal pain, completed a muhidimensional measure for RAP that consisted of 3 sub-scales: pain intensity scale (6 items), non-pain symptoms scale (8 items); and satisfaction scale (2 items). Results: 1,080 children were invited and 700 completed the questionnaire (65% repose rate), mean age = 9.5 years. Children were classified as having RAP if they met Apley's Criteria. The overall prevalence of RAP was 24%; 25% among boys vs. 23% among girls, p=0.6. There were no ethnic differences in RAP between Black, Hispanic or White children; 25%, 22%, and 28%, respectively, p=0.7. Pain or discomfort occurred more than once/month among reported cases of abdominal pain. Based on a pain intensity scale, 60% reported moderate to severe pain and 45% had pain for -> 30 minutes. Nausea and bloating were the most common upper G1 symptoms associated with the pain. Eating fresh fruits played a protective role against RAP (OR= 2.2 (95% CI= 1.5-3.7) (p=0.01) for those children with 0-2 servings of fruits/week compared to those with daily servings. An inverse correlation was observed between RAP and eating fast food; children who eat daily in fast-food restaurants have more frequent episodes of pain than those who eat only once/week, (OR= 1.5, 95% CI = 0.9-2.5) (p = 0.09). Conclusion: There is a high prevalence of abdominal pain/discomfort among school children that is severe enough to interfere with school activities. Healthy eating habits appear to play a protective effect against RAP in children.",

The effect of VIP during the course of acute pancreatitis is unclear. To address this, we investigated the effects of V1P and selective agonists for two subtypes of VIP receptor (VPAC 1-R and VPAC2-R agonist) on acute pancreatitis. Methods: Acute pancreatitis was induced in mice by four intraperitoneal injections of Caemlein (Cn) (50/*g/kg) and a single injection of LPS (8 mg/kg) 5 hours after the first Cn injection. V1P, VPAC1-R agonist, VPAC2-R agonist, or secretin (5 nmolfoody) was administered 30 minutes before and after the administration of LPS. Serum amylase, IL-6, TNF-c~ and IL-10 levels were determined and histological changes in the pancreas were evaluated. In vitro, we isolated the monocytes originated from the spleen and determined the production of IL-6 and TNF-c\u00a2 24 hours after the stimulation of LPS (100 ng/ml) with VIP, VPAC1-R agonist or VPAC2-R agoinst (10 12 M to 10 ~ M). We also investigated the expression of VPAC1-R and VPAC2-R mRNA in the monocytes. Results: VPAC1-R agonist significantly decreased serum amylase, IL-6 and TNF-cx whereas VPAC2-R agonist produced a marked increase in the amylase level. Histologically, VIP and VPAC1-R agonist attenuated the severity of pancreatitis whereas VPAC2-R agonist or secretin showed no significant effect on the pancreas. In vitro, both VPAC1-R and VPAC2-R mRNA were obviously expressed in the monocytes. Under stimulation with LPS, VIP presented a biphasic pattern that once decreased IL-6 production from monocytes at the concentration of 10 -1\u00b0 M, and then enhanced at high concentration (10 .6 M). VPAC1-R agonist reduced IL-6 levels, whereas VPAC2-R agonist increased IL-6 dose-dependently. VPAC1-R agonist reduced TNF-c~ levels in a dose dependent manner. Conclusions: These results indicate that VIP attenuated the severity of experimental acute pancreatitis enzymatically and morphologically. It was considered that the effect of VIP resulted from the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine production in the monocytes mainly through the VPAC1-R.",

            "text": "We have shown previously that edema formation during acute cerulein-induced pancreatitis is due to the release of bradykinin within the pancreas. In many tissues, bradykinin releases prostaglandins (PG), especially PGE2, which in turn can contribute to the bradykininmediated increases in vascular permeability. We have now studied the PGE2 release during acute pancreatitis with respect to its time course, its dependence on bradykinin action, and its contribution to oedema formation. Acute pancreatitis was induced by i.v. infusion of cemlein (4 nmol/kg/h for 2 h) in anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats; control animals received phosphate-buffered saline. Prostaglandin synthesis was quantified as PGE2 release per 10 min in supernatants of tissue samples incubated at 37\u00b0C using a radioimmunoassay for PGE> The inflammatory edema reached peak values within 2 h and was resolved 24 h after induction of pancreatitis. The bradykiinn B2 receptor antagonist icatibant (100 nmol/kg, s.c.) potently attenuated edema formation, while the B~ receptor antagonist des-Arg~\u00b0-Leu 9kallidin (DALKD; 300 nmol/kg s.c.) had no effect. PGE2 production was significantly elevated at 2 h, and showed a continuous further increase at 4 h and 24 h. PGE2 formation was not altered by icatibant or DALKD. In contrast, the cyclo-oxygenase (COX) inhibitor indomethacin (10 mg/kg i.p.) abolished the prostanoid release at all time points. The selective COX-1 inhibitor SC-560 (1 mg/kg i.p.) also inhibited PGE2 synthesis while the COX-2 inhibitor DFU (2 mg/kg i.p.) had no effect. None of the COX inhibitors had an inhibitory effect on edema formation. In cerulein-induced pancreatitis, edema formation and the release of PGEz have different time courses, PGEz is not released via B2 receptors, and PGE2 does not contribute to increased vascular permeability. Prostanoid release and kinin-mediated oedema formation thus are independent in this model. Furthermore, COX-2 does not seem to contribute to PGE2.release even at the later stages of the inflammatgry injury in this model. Background & Aims: The mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule-1 (MAdCAM-1) is known to play an important role in the etiology of IBD, but whether MAdCAM-1 is expressed within the inflamed pancreas, or whether it may possibly play a role in forms of pancreatic inflammation has not been previously investigated. The purpose of this study was to measure MAdCAM-1 expression, regulation and function in a recently established murine pancreatic endothelial cell line in vitro. Methods: We derived a mouse pancreatic endothelial cell system, which uses cells originally obtained from mice which express a temperature-sensitive SV40 large T antigen (H-2Kb-tsA58 mice; ImmortoMice). MAdCAM-1 expression was examined by western immunoblotting in cell lysates after stimulation with TNF-a, 1L-1~3 or 1FN-% We also studied the signal pathways which regulate pancreatic MAdCAM-1 expression in response to TNF-c\u00a2 using several pharmacological signal blockers (Proteasomal inhibitor:MG-132, PARP inhibition:GPI-6150, tyrosine kinase:genistein, p42/44 MAPK:PD-98059, p38 MAPK:SB-202190, PKC:GO-6976, and PKG:KT-5823). Lymphocyte adhesion mediated by MAdcAM-1/~x4~7 integrin was studied using the c\u00a24137 integrin expressing lymphocyte cell line 'TK-I', in the presence and absence of a saturating dose of anti-MAdCAM-1 mAb. Results: TNF-c~ induced MAdCAM-1 in a dose-and time-dependent manner, and was PKC, tyrosine kinase, p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, and NF-/CB/PARP dependent. IL-143 and IFN'y did not induce MAdCAM-1 expression in these cells. TNF-a significantly induced TK-1 lymphocyte endothelial adhesion, and was blocked by anti-MAdCAM-1; (-73.2% of the TNF-c~-induced TK-1 adhesion was found to be MAdCAM-1 dependent). Conclusion: MAdCAM-1 is induced on pancreatic endothelial cells by TNF-a but not other cytokines, and may therefore contribute to forms of acute or chronic pancreatitis. This novel pancreatic endothelial cell line might provide a useful model for studying cytokine mediated inflammation and reproduce some aspects of pancreatitis in vitro. Although pain is a cardinal feature of pancreatitis, its etiology is poorly understood and treatment remains difficult. The vanilloid receptor 1 (TRPV1) plays a fundamental role in the transduction of pain due to peripheral tissue injury/inflammation in part because TRPVI currents are increased inflammation, but its role in pain in pancreatitis is unknown. Our aim was to determine whether TRPV1 currents were enhanced in pancreatitis. Methods TRPV1 currents were measured in acutely dissociated pancreatic afferent neurons. To identify pancreatic afferents, retrograde label, cholera toxin B alexa dye 488 (CTB-488) was injected into the pancreas. Pancreatitis was induced with two i.p. injections of L-arginine (250 mg/ kg); control animals received saline. Sensory neurons were isolated from thoracic dorsal root ganglia (DRG)T12-T8 and experiments were performed within 24 hours. Currents induced by either bath or spritzer application of capsaicin (CAP) were measured in voltage clamp mode at a holding potential of -60 mV. The level of TRPV1 mRNA in DRG T9-Tll VR1 was measured by northern blot. Results In experiments using bath application of CAP (0.1 microM), the proportion of neurons sensitive to CAP was significantly greater in pancreatitis rats, 7/8 compared to controls, 10/15, p<0.05. Among neurons responding to CAP, currents normalized to neuron capacitance were significantly greater in pancreatitis -81.1 +/-15 compared to controls, -49.4 +A 7 pA/pF, p<0.05. In experiments using spritzer application of CAP (1.0 microM), the proportion of neurons sensitive to CAP was significantly greater in pancreatitis rats, 14/15 compared to controls, 8/14, p<0.05. Among neurons responding to CAP, normalized currents were significantly greater in pancreatitis -77.2 +/-15 compared to controls, -22.8 +/-7 pA/pF, p<0.0001. TRPV1 mRNA in DRG Tg-Tll VR1 was elevated 1.4 fold in rats with pancreatitis (n= 13, p<0.01). Conclusion TRPV1 currents and the proportion of pancreatic afferents responsive to capsaicin were increased in pancreatitis. Part or all of this increase may be due to up-regulation of TRPV1. These data support the hypothesis that TRPV1 plays a critical role in pain transmission in pancreatitis. Purpose. PAR-2 is activated when its tethered peptide ligand, SLIGRL, is proteolytically liberated and allowed to bind, intramolecularly, to the receptor's activating site. Following its activation, PAR-2 is phnsphorylated, internalized, and degraded. Thus, the disappearance of PAR-2 can be used, experimentally, to monitor receptor activation. Physiologically, PAR-2 is proteolytically activated by trypsin but it can also be activated, non-proteolytically, when exposed to soluble preparations of the activating peptide SL1GRL. Recently, Singh et al (Gastroenterology 122:A735, 2003) reported that the severity of caemlein-indueed pancreatitis was increased by genetic deletion of PAR-2 suggesting that normal expression of PAR-2 exerts a protective effect on pancreatitis. The currently reported studies examine mechanisms responsible for that protection. Methods. Mice were given hourly intraperitoneal injections of caerulein (50 ~tg/kg) to induce pancreatitis. For in-vitro studies, freshly isolated mouse acini were exposed to a supramaxi. maUy stimulating concentration (1 nM) of caerulein or activating peptide SLIGRL. PAR-2 levels were monitored by immunoblot analysis using anti-PAR-2 antibodies. Results. During the first hour of caerulein-induced pancreatitis there was a decrease in pancreatic PAR-2. After that PAR-2 levels increased to reach a steady-state that was lower than the PAR-2 levels observed prior to the induction of pancreatitis. Exposure of acini to 5LIGRL or supramaximal stimulation with caerulein (1 nM) in-vitro also resulted in timedependent decrease of acinar cell PAR-2 levels.",

Supported by NIH Grant DK31396 Introduction: Necrosis in severe acute pancreatitis (AP) is associated with high morbidity and mortality and a compromised pancreatic microcirculation. The role galanin plays in the regulation of pancreatic perfusion is unclear, however it is known to have vasoactive effects in other organs and may be important in the development of necrosis in AP. Aims and Methods: To determine the presence and location of galanin in the pancreas, tissue was harvested from Australian possums (n = 5), fixed and polyethylene glycol sections prepared. lmmunohistochemical labelling of galainn and qualitative assessment were undertaken. To examine the functional role of galanin in the possum, animals were anaesthetised and the pancreas exposed. Blood pressure (BP) and pancreatic vascular perfusion (PVP), using laser Doppler flowmetry in the head, body and tail of the pancreas, were continuously measured. Galainn (n= 5) and the galanin antagonist, galantide (n= 5), were given in increasing intravenous (IV) bolus doses, 0.001 to 10 nmol and 0.003 to 30 nmol respectively. IV infusions of both drugs (n=4) were evaluated at concentrations of 1 and 10 nmol and 3 and 30 nmol respectively. Results: Galanin was found to be most prominent in fibres surrounding blood vessels in the pancreas. Galanin caused a maximum rise in BP of 177% of baseline, with a 30 minute duration at the 10 nmol dose. The maximum pressor response and duration of effect were dose dependent. Galantide caused the opposite effect, with a maximal decrease in blood pressure to 73% of baseline, with recovery by 3 minutes and, at the 3 and 30 nmol doses, a further fall to 84% followed this recovery. In contrast to the rise in BP, PVP fell with galanin administration to a maximum of 75% of baseline, while galantide caused a biphasic effect with an initial maximal increase to 178%, followed by a maximal fall to 56% at the highest dose. Conclusions: The fall in PVP associated with galanin administration, and the initial increase in PVP achieved by blocking endogenous galarLin, suggests galanin may be important in the regulation of PVP. Thus, galanin may have a role in the development of necrosis in AP. The breakdown of the integrity of intestinal wall is believed to be implicated in bacterial translocation. We have recently found that apoptosis is accelerated on intestinal epithelial cells and that bacterial translocation is induced in rat severe acute pancreatitis. On the other hand, it is believed that cascade of caspase activation is involved in the signaling pathway of apoptosis. Caspase 9 is an initiator in mitochondrial pathway. Caspase 10 is an initiator in death receptor pathway. Caspase 3 is an effector in both pathway. In this study, to clarify the molecular mechanism of the apoptosis of the intestinal epithelial cells, involvement of caspases was investigated. [Materi-aIss & Methods] Male Wistar rats weighing 300-350g were used. Pancreatitis was induced by retrograde injection of 3% sodium deoxycholate into the biliopancreatic duct and ileum was removed. Immunohistochemistry for activated caspase 3, caspase 9, and caspase 10 and measurement of villous height were performed. Apoptosis was evaluated by TUNEL staining of ileum and DNA fragmentation ELISA in the ileal mucosa. Moreover, effects of caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-fmk) were investigated.",

Immunoreactivities for all activated caspases were diminished with the breakdown of intestinal mucosa 12 h after induction of pancreatitis. Administration of caspase inhibitor reduced the apoptosis induction rate and maintained the integrity of intestinal mucosa. [Conclusion] In severe acute pancreatitis, caspase 3, caspase 9, and caspase 10 were activated in the ileal mucosa in the early phase and thereafter apoptosis was induced. These results suggest that apoptotic change of ileal epithelium was induced via both mitochondrial pathway and death receptor pathway. Male Lewis rats were randomized to 4 groups (n=21 each): group 1: ischemia and SIR, group 2: ischemia and vehicle, group 3: sham surgery and SIR, group 4: sham surgery and vehicle. Sham-operated rats underwem the same surgical procedure without occlusion. SIR (1.5 rag/kg/d) and vehicle were given intraperitoneafly daily from day 3 before surgery until the day of sacrification. 7 animals out of each group were examined by intravital microscopy (IVM). In each group 7 rats were killed on day 1 and 5 obtaining tissue samples. Blood samples were analyzed for plasma endothelin-1 (ET-1), serum amylase and lipase levels. A semiquantitve score was used for assessment of histologic injury in standard H&E staining. Proliferation and apoptesis index were measured 1 and 5 days after ischemia. Results: SIR had no effect on microcireulation or morphology in sham~operated animals (group 3 vs. group 4).

Gooszen, Louis M, A, Akkermans, Karel J. van Erpecum Biliary reflux into the pancreatic duct is essential m the pathogenesis of biliary pancreatitis. We hypothesized that hydrophobic bile salts or cholesterol crystals may enhance, and phospholipids may decrease severity of pancreatitis, Methods: Model systems (all 15raM in PBS) composed with hydrophobic taurodeoxycholate (TDC), physiological mixture of bile salts (MBS), or hydrophilic tauroursodeoxycholate (TUDC) with or without cholesterol crystals or phosphatidylcholine (PC), were infused into bile ducts of male Sprague-Dawley rats (complete retrograde spread into pancreas confirmed by methylene blue). Twentyfour hours later, animals were sacrificed for histopathologic scoring of (peri)pancreatic inflammation. Results: Severity of acute pancreatitis depended on bile salt hydrophobieity (TDC > MBS >> TUDC = PBS; histopathologic scores: 26.3 \u00b1 0.3, 23.3 \u00b1 2.4, 15.7 +_ 0.3, 15.5 \u00b1 0.5 respectively; P = 0.002). Phosphatidylcholine protected against the detrimental effect of TDC at high, but not at low concentrations (scores: 17.0 _+ 3.1 vs 25.7 \u00b1 3.3 in case of PC/(TDC + PC) ratios 0.25 vs 0.05). Cholesterol crystals increased the severity of pancreatitis in model systems containing TDC or MBS, but not TUDC or PBS (33.0 \u00b1 0.6, 31.3 _+ 0.6, 17.5 _+ 1.8, 17.5 \u00b1 0.6 respectively; P < 0.001). Conclusions: In the rat model, hydrophobic bile salts and cholesterol crystals aggravate bfliary pancreatitis, whereas phospholipids have a protective effect. Aim: Acute pancmatitis is often associated with gastrointestinal motility disturbances. However, the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown. We therefore studied the effect of acute necrotising pancreatitis on the contractility of isolated musde strips from the gastric fundns and jejunum. Methods: Acute necrotising pancreainis was induced by feeding young female mice a cholinedeficient (CD) ethionine (0,5%) supplemented diet (CDE) for 72 hours. Longitudinal muscle strips were prepared from the gastric fundns and jejunum and mounted in organ baths for isometric tension recordings. Enteric nerve-mediated contractions to electrical field stimulation (EFS, 0.5-8 Hz) and contractions to carbachol (Cch, 109-10\"), substance P (SP, 10 9-10-v), serotonin (5HT, 108-105), prostaglandine F2~ (PGF2cq lOS-10 6) and KCI 50 mM were studied in control, CD and CDE mice. The severity of the acute pancreatitis was assessed by histological examination. Only mice with a histological severity score >\" 4 after the CDE diet were included in the CDE group. Results: EFS, Cch, SP, 5HT, PGF2a and KC1 induced contractions in jejunal and gastric fundus muscle strips from control, CD and CDE mice. However, all jejunal contractions were significantly decreased in CDE mice with acute pancreatitis (Table 1) , whereas jejunal contractility in CD mice was comparable to control mice (Table 1) . On the other hand, acute pancreatitis did not affect the contractility of gastric fundus muscle strips since contractions to EFS, Cch, SP, PGF,c~ and KC1 in the gastric fundns were similar in control, CD and CDE mice. Conclusion: Our results show that acute necrotising pancreatitis leads to a decreased contractility of the jejunum while the contractility of the gastric fundus remains normal during pancreatitis These results suggest that acute necrotising pancreatitis leads to a disturbed contractile activity of specific regions of the gut. Background: Acute pancreatitis (AP) is characterized by a disturbance of pancreatic microcirculation leading to ischemia and consequently necrosis of pancreatic tissue. Leukocyteendothelium-interaction and erythrocyte flow pattern have been well investigated during these pathophysiological processes. In contrast, it remains unclear how platelets contribute to these perfusion disturbances. Aim of our study was the investigation of platelet activation and function in experimental models of AP. Methods: AP of graded severity was induced in rats. 1) control animals (n = 6) Ringers solution i.v.; 2) mild AP (n= 12) cerulein i.v.; 3) severe AP (n= 12) glycodeoxycholic acid 2,5raM intraductal + cemlein i.v.. i2h after induction of AP intravital microscopy was performed in 6 animals of each group after separation and staining of platelets (lml blood, rhodamin 6G). Platelet velocity as well as temporary and firm platelet adhesion to the endothelium was investigated in capillary fields and postcapiflary venules. In addition serum thromboxane B2 levels were measured. In the remaining 6 animals per gruop, histological damage was evaluated 24 h after induction of AP. Results: Histology after 24 h showed a mild AP in the animals that had received cerulein. In contrast, in animals with GDOC application, inflammation and necrosis were signifikantly more evident (inflammation 1,3+/-0,18 vs. 1,9+/-0,21, necrosis 1,20+/-011 vs.1,80+/-0,28). lntravital microscopy showed significantly more platelet-endothelium interaction in animals with AP compared to control animals. In addition, TBX-levels were significantly higher in AP animals. Conclusion: Platelet activation plays an important role in the pathophysiology of acute, especially necrotizing pancreatitis. During mild AP mainly temporary plateletendothelium interaction is observed, while severe AP is characterized by firm platelet adhesion with consecutive coagulatory activation and perfusion failure. Background and Aim: Pancreatitis is known to induce changes in inilammatory cells. However, little is known regarding the relationship of lymphocyte migration patterns in different tissues of the same subject affected with pancreatitis. In the present work, pancreatitis was induced in rats with sodium taurocholate and ceil surface expression profiles of helper/ cytotoxic T ceils (CD4, CD8), selectin (CD62L), integrin (CDIla, CD49d), and T cell receptors (a/13 and ~//g) were determined on lymphocytes derived from either whole blood or spleen of the same rats after 24 hours. Methods: Acute pancreatitis was induced in Wistar rats by retrograde infusion of 4% sodium taurocholate into the pancreatic duct. Whole blood and spleen were collected after 24 hours. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were separated from each organ (Ficoll-Paque). PBMC were incubated with conjugated antibodies and expression of cell surface antigens were analyzed by flow microfluorimetry. Results: Minimal expression of CD4 (<2%) was observed on lymphocytes derived from either blood or spleen. A 4 fold increased expression of CD8 was observed on blood lymphocytes when compared to splenic lymphocytes (3% vs. 12%). integrin expression was similar on lymphocytes from both organs, CD49d -4% (+/-1%), CDlla -46% (+/-6%). Expression of CD62L selectin showed a 5 fold increase in blood when compared to splenic lymphocytes (33% vs. 6%). Lymphocytes from both groups were predominantly c\u00a2/13 (65%). Conclusion: Inflammatory changes in pancreatitis can be tissue specific and may provide insight into the migration of lymphocytes in different organs. Understanding cell surface expression and integrin/selectin profiles may provide novel approaches for immunotherapy in pancreatitis.",

The aim of this study is to clarify the effect of tumor necrosis factor receptor-p55/-p75 (TNFR-p55/TNFR-p75) in the pathogenesis of SAP. Methods: Thirtysix male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly allocated into 2 groups: SAP group and control group. SAP was induced by injection of 5% sterile sodium taurocholate into biliopancreatic duct, while control group was only given sham operation. All the rats were sacrificed at 3, 6, and 12 hours after the onset of operation. Blood sample and pancreatic tissues were harvested. The severity of pancreatitis was assessed according to the level of serum amylase and histological scoring. The serum level of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) was examined by ELASA. The expression of TNFR-p55 and TNFR-p75 in pancreatic tissues and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was determined by semiqnantitative RT-PCR. Results:The levels of serum amylase and TNF-alpha in SAP group were both significantly higher than those of the control group at each time point (P < 0.05, seperately). The expression of TNFR-p55 and TNFR-p75 in both PBMC (P < 0.01) and pancreatic tissues (P<O.01, P<0.05) of the SAP group were significantly upregnlated at each time point, and their expression reached its maximum about 6.0 hours after the onset of experiment in PBMC and then declined. In SAP tissue sample, severe edema and congestion were demonstrated at 3 hours, bleeding and necrosis were illustrated at 6 hours among the parenchyma of pancreata. Conclusion: TNF-alpha is a pivotal factor in the pathogenesis of pancreatitis, and its binding to TNFR-p55 and TNFR-p75 may intensify the pathological deterioration in pancreatic tissue and result in bleeding and necrosis. The present study indicated a pathoge. netic role of the cytotoxic TNF pathway in the clinical features of SAP by enhancing leucocyte activation through upregulation of TNFR-p55 and TNFR-p75 in PBMC and pancreatic tissue both.",

Sera amylase and lipase were determined, and pancreatic histological scoring for pancreatitis was assessed independently by two pathologists. Results: (1) Rats given 4 microgram/kg body w.t. of HGF showed lower levels of sera amylase, lipase, and histological score vs. those of control group (P<0.05), while the phenomenon was not observed from rats given 2 microgram/kg body w.t. of HGF.",

Conclusions: We concluded that the administration of enough exogenous HGF before the induction of severe acute pancreatitis could attenuate the following pancreatic damages in rats. Subtotal colectomy prior to experimental acute pancreatitis (AP) in rats has been shown to reduce mortality. However, the effect of subtotal colectomy on proximal small bowel bacterial overgrowth and infection of pancreatic necrosis, is unknown. The aim of this experiment was to investigate these effects of subtotal colectomy in rats with acute pancreatitis. Methods: 50 male Spragne-Dawley rats were allocated in four study groups. All underwent two laparotomies, with a 14-day interval. Group I: sham laparotomy and saline biliary duct infusion, group If: subtotal colectomy and saline infusion, group lIl: sham laparotomy and induction of AP (ductal infusion of 10 mM glycodeoxycholic acid, followed by intravenous cerulein) and group IV: subtotal colectomy and AP. Seventy-two hours after second laparotomy blood, peritoneal fluid, mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, spleen, pancreas, duodenum and ileum were collected for microbiological analysis. Results: A total of 39 rats was included. Seven rats were excluded for hyperbilirubinaemia, four rats died during surgery. There was no mortality due to AP. Subtotal colectomy caused duodenal and ileal bacterial overgrowth with aerobes (group I vs lI, duodenum 10log CFU (colony forming units)/g = 4.25 vs 5.46, p=0.027; ileum 10log CFU/g = 5.06 vs 6.59, p=O.O15). Total bacterial counts in the pancreas, duodenum and ileum of rats with AP and previous colectomy were significantly higher than in rats with AP only (group IIl vs IV: pancreas 10log CFU/g = 4.30 vs 5.91, p=0.O12; duodenum 10log CFU/g = 5.52 vs 6.59, p=0.047; ileum 10log CFU/g = 6.66 vs 7.64, p=0.049). Duodenal bacterial overgrowth and pancreatic infection with grampositive aerobes correlated significantly (r = 0.78, p<0.01). Conclusions: Duodenal bacterial overgrowth plays an important role in infection of pancreatic necrosis. Subtotal colectomy induces small bowel bacterial overgrowth, with increased pancreatic infection in acute pancreatitis.",

Methods: Forty-eight C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into SAP group and OXPAPC group. SAP was induced by administration of seven intraperitoneal injections of cerulein (50 rnicrog/kg) at hourly intervals. LPS was injected 6 hours after the first cerulein injection. OXPAPC was obtained by air oxidation of dry PAPC. The extent of oxidation was monitored by posititive ion flow injection electrospray mass spectrometry. Treatment with OXPAPC was started 5 minutes before the LPS injection. At 9, 12, 24 hours after the first cerulein injection, the blood and specimens of pancreas were harvested. Serum levels of amylase and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were measured. The severity of pancreatitis was evaluated by histological scoring using a semiqnantitative analysis of hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections of the pancreas. Semi-quantitive reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to quantify the intrapancreatic TNF-alpha,IL-1 beta,ICAM-1 and E-selectin mRNA levels. The expressions of phosphated JNK and NFkappa B p65 were investigated by the method of western blotting. The activity of PMN ~yeloperoxidase (MPO) was determined by zymohistochemistry. Results: Seven times cerulein injection induced edematous pancreatitis, while necrotising pancreatitis developed soon after LPS was challenged. Serum amylase levels progressively increased with a maximum reached at 12 hours. Treatment of OXPAPC significantly decreased amylase levels at 9 and 12 hours, while reduced LDH at 24h. Histologically, treatment with OXPAPC alleviated the severity of pancreatic injury including inflammatory cell infiltration, and necrosis at 12 and 24 hours. Intrapancreatic TNF-alpha,IL-1 beta,ICAM-1 and E-selectin mRNA levels were reduced in OXPAPC-treated group at 9 and 12 hours. Western blotting showed downregulation of phosphated JNK. and NF-kappa B p65 There was significant decrease in MPO activity in OXPAPC group at 9,12 and 24 hours. Conclusions: OXPAPC decreased the severity ofexperimetual pancreatitis and inhibited the intrapancreatic inflammatory mediators expression in vivo. The protective effect of OXPAPC was mediated, at least in part, through blocking endotoxin signal pathway.",

The aim of this study was to determine the effect of the free-radical scavenger melatonin on the early phase of experimental acute uecrotizing pancreatitis. Methods. Male Wistar rats were divided into five groups. Rats in group A received 3.2 g/kg body weight L-arginine (L-Arg) i.p. twice at an interval of 1 h to induce acute pancreatitis. In group MA, rats were treated with 50 mg/kg body weight melatonin i.p. 30 rain prior to L-Arg administration. In group AM, the rats received the same dose of melatonin 1 h after the induction of pancreatitis with L-Arg. In group M, a single dose of melatonin was administered as described previously. The rats in group C served as control and recived physiological saline injections i.p. Rats were exsanguinated 24 h after the last L-Arg injection. Results. In groups A, AM and MA L-Arg caused a severe necrotizing pancreatitis confirmed by the significant elevation of serum amylase levels, pancreatic weight/body weight ratio (pw/bw), and pancreatic myeloperoxidase activity vs. groups C. Elevation of the serum amylase level was significantly reduced in group AM vs. group A. The activity of pancreatic antioxidatu enzymes (Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD), Mn-SOD and catalase (CAT)) was significantly increased 24 h after the induction of pancreatitis. In group MA, the pancreatic CAT activity was significantly reduced compared to group A. in group A vs. group C, the lipid peroxidation level, glutathion peroxidase and Cu/Zn-SOD activity were significantly increased in the liver, whereas melatonin pretreatmem abolished these changes and decreased the activity of liver CAT vs. group C. Conclusion. In severe acute pancreatitis a moderate protective effect of melatonin was observed 24 h following pancreatitis induction demonstrated by the decrease of serum amylase activity, and lipid peroxidation. This work was supported by the Hungarian Scientific Research Fund (T042589). Tumor cells are known to form \"dorsal ruffles\" in response to certain growth factors. Previously, we demonstrated that stimulation of a variety of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), including EGF-R or PDGF-R, induced the rapid and transient assembly of a Dyn2, cortactin, actin, and N-WASp-Arp2/3 complex into concentric structures near the leading edge of highly metastatic human pancreatic ductular tumor cells. These complexes moved along the dorsal membrane in a \"wave\" like fashion, constricted, and then disappeared. Concomitant with the formation and disappearance of these dorsal waves was a marked reorganization of actin stress fibers and localized lamellipodia extension (MBC, 2003) . The GOAL of this current study was to test if EGF-induced dorsal waves are endocytic structures that sequester and intemafize the EGF receptor-figand complex at the cell surface. Ductular tumor cells expressing EGF-R-GFP were stimulated with 30 ng/ml EGF and observed by fluorescence microscopy. Within just minutes a marked sequestration of the tagged receptor into the waves occurred, subsequently generating numerous receptor positive tubular-vesicular structures. Electron microscopy confirmed that these wave structures were formed along the dorsal membrane surface and emended numerous tubules into the cytoplasm. We observed an increased labeling of the dorsal wave structures with cholera toxin compared to the surrounding plasma membrane. Importantly, dorsal waves selectively sequestered the stimulated EGF-R away from non-stimulated receptors as neither PDGF nor the transferrin receptors were enriched in the waves. Despite the active internalization of EGF-R and ligand, dorsal waves did not stain with multiple antibodies to clathnn, Epsl5, or caveolin, nor did they incorporate GFP-tagged clathrin or caveolin-1. In SUMMARY, these findings describe the formation of a novel, dorsal, tubular-vesicular structure that requires the participation of Dyn2 and the actin cytoskeleton to sequester EGF-R into specific GM 1 -rich plasma membrane invaginations for subsequent internalization, independent of traditional endocytic structures such as clathrin pits or caveolae. These findings provide new information on how pancreatic tumor cells internalize tyrosine receptor kinases that is likely to facilitate motility and invasion. The pancreatic acinar cell is known to regulate exocytosis, protein synthesis, and secretory protein transport in response to a secretory stimulus. Whether secretory vesicle formation is also regulated in acinar cells is unclear. We have previously demonstrated that dynamin-2 (Dyn2), a large, ubiquitously expressed GTPase, is essential for the scission of nascent secretory viral protein-contaiinng vesicle carriers from the trans-Golgi network (TGN) of cultured epithelial cells. The GOAL of this study was to determine whether agonist stimulation induces morphological alterations in the acinar cell Golgi apparatus and to define the role of Dyn2 in Golgi structure and zymogen granule (ZG) formation. Changes in Golgi structural integrity were assessed by utilizing Golgi and TGN lipid and protein markers in live and fixed cells upon stimulation with cholecystokinin (CCK). Subsequently, ZG size and number were quantified in cells expressing a dominant negative, GTPase-defective Dyn2 protein. RESULTS: Regulated secretion in acinar cells induced a marked fragmentation of the TGN, while pre-TGN compartments of the Golgi as well as regions of the TGN involved in the generation of constitutively trafficking vesicles were unaffected. Coincident with the fragmentation of the TGN during regulated secretion was a significant recruitment of Dyn2 to the acinar cell Golgi compartment. In the resting state, inhibition of Dyn2 function i~ cultured acinar cells through expression of a GTPase deficient, dominant negative, Dyn2 protein induced the formation of large perinnclear membrane aggregates. Interestingly, this membrane disruption was not observed in other non-acinar epithelial cell types such as Clone 9 cells (hepatocyte) or NRK (kidney) suggesting a perturbation specific to ZG formation. Importantly, a reduction of ZG number within the mutant Dyn2-expressing acinar cells did not occur, although we did observe a substantial increase in the size of ZGs. Expression of the dominant negative, Dyn2 protein resulted in a 4-fold increase in average zymogen granule size. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the acinar cell TGN is a dynamic organdie that is responsive to agonist stimulation and becomes fragmented via the recruitment and action of Dyn2. Furthermore, Dyn2 plays an important role in the de novo biogenesis of ZGs in the acinar cell possibly through a role in vesiculation of select cargo from condensing, maturing ZGs. Backgrounds : Glucagon-like peptide-1 is an intestinal incretin hormone, derived from the processing of proglucagon, that exerts insulmotropic actions on insulin-producing pancreatic beta-cells. We established multipotetuial progenitor cells in the pancreas, termed YGIC cell lines that are transdifferentiated from adult pancreatic acinar cell to ductal progenitor cells. Our aims are to analyze the effects of GLP-1 on the transdifferentiation of the established normal rat pancreatic ductal cells and to investigate the potential role of GLP-1 for the future cell therapy using normal pancreatic duct cells as a pancreatic precursor cell. Methods : Treatment with recombinant GLP-1 was camed out in the absence of serum. YGIC cells are transfected with pBX322/GLP-1 to make inducible transfectant producing GLP-1. We identified the expression of SCF, c-kit, PDX-1, Pax-4, Pax-6, Ngn-3, NeuroD, insulin, glucagon and CFTR and by westem blotting, RT-PCR and ELISA methods. Results : While Hes-1, Notch-l, neuroD, Shh, Pax6 key players of embryonic pancreas development, were not modulated by the treatment of GLP-1, ngn-3 and pdx-1 was down-regulated by GLP-1. Stem cell markers, SCF and c-kit were induced by the treatment of GLP-1, whereas CFTR, ductal marker, was down-regulated. Furthermore, GLP-1 treatment induced both insulin and glucagon in YGIC cells. GLP-1, however, failed to modulate Glut-2 and glucokinase implying that this factor affects early events of endocrine differentiation, but not terminal differentiation in these cells. Conclusions : GLP-1 stimulates the differentiation of ductal progenitor ceils into insulin-producing cells. These findings suggest a model of islet development in that pancreatic progenitor cells differentiated into pancreatic endocrine cells that express GLP-1 receptors, glucagons, PDX-1 and insulin. Background & Aims: The cytokine tumor necrosis factor-ix (TNF-ix) plays a key role in the development of acute pancreatitis; however, the mechanisms involved are poorly understood. Changes in actin cytoskeleton in the pancreatic acinar cells are an early event in pancreatitis, and proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2) is one important regulator of cytoskeleton. The present study sought to determine the involvement of PYK2 in TNF-Ix signaling in pancreatic acinar cells. Because protein kinase C (PKC) is implicated as an upstream mediator of PYK2 activation by other stimuli in pancreatic acinar cells, we also examined whether and which PKC isoforms are involved in the TNF-IX induced PYK2 activation. Methods: Dispersed rat pancreatic acini were stimulated with TNF-IX (100 ng/ml). By Western blot analysis, we examined tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2 at Y402 and Y580, the sites are essential for the SH2-mediated protein-protein interactions and for PYK2 full catalytic activity, respectively. The activities of conventional (og]~/~), novel (~ and e), and atypical (4) PKC isoforms were measured by kinase assay using isoform-specific immunoprecipitates and isoformoptimized peptide substrates. The roles of individual PKC isoforms for PYK2 phosphorylation were assessed by isoform-specific PKC inhibitors. Results: TNF-IX rapidly stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2. The phosphorylation of PYK2 at Y402 reached a maximum at 1 rain and plateaued by 5 rain after TNF-ix stimulation, whereas phosphorylation at Y580 peaked at 5 rain. The phosphorylation of both sites was prevented by PYK2 inhibitors, Na salicylate and tyrphostin A9. The broad-spectrum PKC inhibitor, GF 109203X, also inhibited PYK2 phosphorylation at both sites induced by TNF-c\u00a2, suggesting the involvement of PKC in the mechanism. TNF-u activated the novel PKC isoforms, ~ and e, and the atypical PKC isoform ~, but not the conventional PKC isoforms. The isoform-specific peptide inhibitors for PKC 8 and e markedly inhibited PYK2 phosphorylation at both sites induced by TNFa. In contrast, PKC ~ inhibitor did not affect PYK2 phosphorylation. Conclusion: TNF-c~ induces PYK2 phosphorylation in pancreatic acinar cells through pathways mediated by novel PKC isoforms, B and e. This signaling mechanism may play an important role in pancreatitis.",

            "text": "Background & Aims: Proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2) is an important regulator of cytoskeleton and has recently been linked to NF-KB activation induced by G-protein activation. NF-KB activation and changes in actin cytoskeleton in pancreatic acinar cells are important early events in pancreatitis. Cholecystokinin-8 (CCK) induces NF-/CB activation and PYK2 phosphorylatinn in pancreatic acini, and protein kinase C (PKC) mediates both of these processes. However, the relationship between the two signaling pathways, as well as the involvement of individual PKC isoforms, is not known. The present study sought to determine whether PYK2 is involved in the CCK-induced NF-KB activation in pancreatic acinar cells. Methods: Dispersed rat pancreatic acini were stimulated with CCK for 30 min. NF-KB binding activity was measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and the degradation of the inhibitory IKBa protein, by Western blotting. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PYK2 at Y402 and Y580, the sites are essential for the SH2-mediated protein-protein interactions and for PYK2 full catalytic activity, respectively, was examined by Western blotting. We used isoform-specific PKC inhibitors to assess PKC isoforms involved in the NF-KB activation and PYK2 phosphorylation and specific pharmacologic inhibitors, PP1 and PP2, to examine the role of Src kinase in the processes. Results: CCK at a supraphysiologic concentration (100 nM) caused both NF-KB activation and PYK2 phosphorylation (at both Y402 and Y580 sites), whereas at a physiologic concentration (0.1 nM) it only induced PYK2 phosphorylation. The isoform-speciflc peptide inhibitors of PKC 8 and e inhibited both the NF-KB activation and PYK2 phosphorylation induced by CCK. On the other hand, a specific inhibitor of atypical PKC ~ isoform affected neither the NF-KB activation nor PYK2 phosphorylation. These data show that PKC B and ~ mediate both NF-KB activation and PYK2 phosphorylation induced by CCK. Src kinase inhibitors, PP1 and PP2, prevented the PYK2 phosphorylation but did not affect the NF-KB activation, indicating distinct downstream mechanisms involved. Conclusion: The results show a key role of PKC ~ and ~ in downstream pathologic effects of CCK. PYK2 phosphorylation does not mediate NF-KB activation induced by CCK in pancreatic acinar cells. Acute pancreatitis is the most frequent disease of the pancreas. During the acute phase of pancreatitis, harmful pancreatic enzyme expression is reduced. However, other genes are strongly activated. These phcnotypic changes might enable the pancreas to protect itself against the acute attack of pancreatitis or, conversely, participate in the pathophysiological mechanism of the disease. The aim of our research is to characterize at the molecular level the pancreatic emergency program set up in response to pancreatitis. We have used a quantitative fluorescent cDNA microarray hybridization approach to identify pancreatic genes induced in pancreatic cells by acute pancreatins in the mouse. Here, we describe the cloning, sequencing, and expression analysis of a gene, named IPIS, whose activation is related to the acute phase of experimental pancreatitis. Analysis of its structure indicated that this gene is interferon-inducible and encodes a putative transs-membrane protein of 137 amino acids long, with a theoretical pl of 7.50 and a predicted molecular weight of 14.954 Da. In vivo studies on swiss mice showed that lPl.5 is strongly activated in pancreas early during caerulein treatment. Northern blot analysis of pancreas tissue with the IP15 cDNA probe showed maximal expression 3 hours after cerulein administration. In situ hybridization of the IP15 mRNA with a digoxigenin labeled cRNA probe on pancreatic tissue from mouse with acute pancreatitis showed that the expression is restricted to the acinar cell. Interestingly, IP15 mRNA was also expressed in intestine during the early stages of Salmonella typhimurinm infection. In vitro studies using NIH 3T3 cells showed that LP15 expression is induced by [NF-alpha and it is not activated by stress treatments like H202 or heat shock. Cells expressing IP15/V5 have less capacity to develop colonies after appropriate antibiotic selection. Hela ceils transfected with pCDNA4-1P15 yielded 46.8% surviving colonies as compared to the pCDNA4 empty transfected cells (100%). In the same cell lines, we followed the growth arid death rate during a 5 day period. IP15-expressing cells showed significantly lower (p<0.01) proliferation rate than control cells. In conclusion, we identified a new interferoninducible gene that is activated in pancreas during the acute phase of pancreatitis and whose expression inhibits cell proliferation. Cysteine string protein (CSP) is a cochaperone of HSP70 heat shock proteins that are known to prevent against the onset of acute pancreatitis in rodents. We previously reported that CSP is expressed on the outer leaflet of zymogen granule (ZG) membranes and proposed a role for CSP in HSP70/HSC70 activation and ZG trafficking. The interaction of CSP with known ZG membrane regulatory proteins was investigated. A direct association of CSP with the SNARE protein, VAMP-8 was shown by coimmunoprecipitation (colP) and immunofluo. rescence microscopy. Conversely, CSP did not interact with VAMP-2. Previous studies have reported that VAMP-2 regulates ZG exocytosis, however, VAMP-8 has not been investigated. A role for VAMP-8 in acinar cell secretion was demonstrated using a permeabdized acinar cell preparation. Acinar cells were permeabil/zed with perfringolysin-O and incubated with the cytoplasmic domain of recombinant VAMP-8 or VAMP-2. Exposure of cells to VAMP proteins is known to inhibit SNARE protein complex formation and exocytosis. In acinar cells, both VAMP-2 and VAMP-8 were found to dose dependently inhibit Ca2+-stimualted amylase secretion by approximately 40%, establishing that both SNARE proteins are involved in exocytosis. Further investigation of CSP interacting proteins revealed that CSP is in a high affinity complex with CaT1 Ca2+-channels. CSP was quantitatively coIPed with CaT1 from isolated ZG membranes. These findings were confirmed by GST-pufl down assays, immunofluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation showing a strong colocalization of these molecules on ZGs and at the cell apex. These data indicate that CSP is in a molecular complex with acinar cell SNARE proteins and CaT1 Ca2+-channels in ZG membranes. We propose that the HSP70/HSC70 cochaperone activity of CSP may facilitate dynamic interactions of SNARE proteins and Ca2+-influx machinery under physiological and pathophysiological states.",

            "text": "Clusterin Overexpressed in Acute Pancrcatitis Protects the Acinar Cell Line AR4-2J from Apoptotic Stimuli Hans Bodeker, Vuk Savkovic, Sebastian Gaiser, Joachim Mossner, Volker Keim Introduction: Clusterin is overexpressed during acute pancreatitis in exocrine pancreas. Our studies intended to clarify the role of Chisterin expression using the acinar cell line AR4-2J as a model. Material and Methods: The cDNA of Clnsterin was subcloned in sense (pClusense) and antisense (pClu-anti) direction into an expression vector. AR4-2J cells were stably transfected and protein expression was determined by Western-blot. These cell lines were exposed to different concentrations of cerulein (CER), staurosporine (STS), lysophosphatitylcholin (LPC) or H202. Cell viability was assayed with a WST-test after 24 hours. Caspase~ 3 activity under stress was monitored using cotransfection of either expression plasmid with the pCaspase3-Sensor vector (pCas-3-S). It codes for a fusion protein of the EYFP containing a nuclear export signal (NES) fused to Caspase-3 cleavage side. In silent cells the NES locates the EYFP in the cytoplasm. When Caspase-3 is activated during apoptosis the NES is cut and the EYFP is translocated into the nucleus. Apoptotic cells were quantified under the fluorescence microscope. Results: AR4-2 J cells exhibited a basal expression of Ckisterin. Exposure to cell stressors CER, STS, LPC, or H202 induced Clusterin expression. Stable transfection with pClu-sense or pChi-anti led to cells over-or under-expressing Chisterin compared to control. The stressors decreased cell viability dose-dependently. Ceils overexpressing Clusterin showed higher cell viabihty under cellular stress. Cell lines transfected with pChi-anti showed diminished Clnsterin expression in response to the stressing agents as well as reduced viability compared to control. Cotransfection experiments of pClu-sense with the pCaspase-3 sensor vector under cellular stress showed diminished apoptosis in AR4-2J cells compared to control. In contrast, cells transfected with pClu-anti revealed enhanced Caspase-3 activity under the same conditions. This effect was blocked by a specific Caspase-3 inhibitor. Cell viability under stress could be ameliorated by adding a specific Caspase-3 inhibitor. Conclusion: Clusterin protected AR4-2J cells against agents which mimick cellular stress in acute pancreatitis. Blocking endogenous Clusterin expression led to higher Caspase-3 activity in stressed AR4-2J ceils. In contrast, overexpression of Clusterin hindered this apoptotic event. Clusterin seems to be part of a defense program in exocrine pancreas against organ injury.",

            "text": "Helicobacter Pylori Infection Induces Intestinal Metaplasia Related Gene Cdx2 in Gastric Epithelial Cells via PTEN-PI3K/Akt-NFKB Pathway Naoki Asano, Akira Imatani, Atsushi Masamune, Motoki Ohyauchi, Makoto Yonechi, Shuichi Ohara, Tooru Shimosegawa Background & Aim: Intestinal metaplasia (IM) is known as a precursory lesion of gastric cancer. Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection in the human stomach is one of the major causes of IM, but little is known about the molecular biological pathway between them. Recently, the homeobox gene Cdx2 has been reported to induce IM, but there has been no report of the relationship between Hp infection and Cdx2. We attempted to reveal the molecular biological pathway between Hp infection and IM, in terms of the induction of Cdx2. Methods: We used human gastric cancer cells GCIY, which did not express Cdx2, as an in vitro model of the gastric epithelial cells. We infected them with Hp and examined the expression of Cdx2 by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Next, we tried to reveal the signal transduction between Hp infection and the expression of Cdx2. We assessed the importance of the two NFKB binding sites of the Cdx2 gene promoter by electrophoretic-mobility shift assay (EMSA) with NFKB oligonucleotide, Western blotting for IKB-a, and luciferase reporter assay. We also peformed a luciferase reporter assay using cilostazol, formerly reported as the suppressor for phosphorylation of phosphatase and tensin homologue deleted from chromosome 10 (PTEN), and PI3K inhibitor wortmannin to find out whether PTEN participates in the pathway to the expression of Cdx2 or not. Results: Expression of Cdx2 was detected lhour after Hp infection (Sxl07cfu/ml), by RT-PCR and Western blotting. EMSA using NFKB oligonudeotide detected the shifted band in the nuclear protein extracted from ffp infected GCIY. Western blotting for IKB-c\u00a2 showed the decrease of IKB-a after Hp infection. The cells infected with Hp showed 3.2folds relative luciferase acivity compared to the cells that were not. 100nM wortmaninn activated the luciferase activity by 2.1folds. This suggests that the inhibition of PI3K induces Cdx2. Background: Helicobacter pylori (Hp) adherence to gastric epithelial ceils activates several signal transduction pathways. In preliminary data we found that Hp adherence to gastric cells increased intracellular Ca 2\u00f7 [Ca2+l~ levels (Am J Physiol, 285:G163-76, 2003) , and increased [Ca2+]~ can activate the non-receptor proline-nch tyrosine kinase-2 (PYK2). In other cell types, both PYK2 and the phosphatase SHP2 (SH2 containing protein tyrosine phosphatase-2) are involved in regulating cell morphology, proliferation, or apoptosis. We therefore wanted to examine in the present study the relationships between PYK2, SHP2 and cell morphology in normal human gastric mucous epithelial cells. Methods: Normal human gastric mucous epithelial cells from surgical specimens were cultured in DMEM serum media. Hp vcdd-type strains (60190, 84-183) were grown on agar plates. Immunoprecipitation and Western blotting was used to detect phosphorylation of PYK2, SHP2, and paxillin. Immunofluorescence microscopy was used to examine signaling molecules and cell morphology. Resuhs: In Hp treated cells, a rapid 3-4 fold increase in phosphorylated PYK2 was detected within 10 rain that was parafled by a -2-fold increase in paxillin phnsphorylation. In Hp-treated cells, PYK2 became dephospholylated after 10 rain which was paralleled by a -2.3-fold increase in SHP2 phosphorylation. In Hp treated cells, anti-pPYK2 and anti-pSHP2 immunoprecipitations detected the phosphorylated forms of PYK2, SHP2, and paxillin. Pretreatment of cells with the intracellular Ca 2+ chelator BAPTA (10uM) or PKC inhibitor GF-109203X (SUM) reduced PYK2 and paxiflin phosphorylation. No PYK2 or SHP2 phosphorylation was observed with beat-killed bacteria. Long term (4hr-24hr) Hptreatment of cells produced cell rounding and detachment. Pretreatment of cells with the SHP2 inhibitor, calpeptin, prolonged Hp-induced PYK2 phosphorylatinn and attenuated the morphological responses, lmmunofluorescence of Hp-treated cells detected PYK2/SHP2 primarily at focal adhesions with paxillin. Conclusions: 1) H. pylori treatment of normal human gastric mucous epithelial cells induces phosphorylation of PYK2 and paxillin, and the binding of the phosphatase SHP2 to PYK2 may regulate PYK2 dephosphorylation; 2) H.pylori activation of PYK2/SHP2 may be part of a signaling mechanism in the control of focal adhesions and paxillin for regulating normal gastric epithelial cell morphology, proliferation, or apoptosis. Background & Aims: Cyclooxygenase (COX) is a rate-limiting enzyme for prostaglandins, which play an important role in inflammation and carcinogenesis. COX-2 is induced by a variety of factors including cytokines, growth factors and tumor promoters. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of COX-2 on H. pylon-induced gastric inflammation, apoptosis and cell proliferation. Methods: H. pylori strain TN2 was inoculated into the stomachs of strain C57/DBA1 of wild-type (WT) and COX-2 deficient (COX-2-/-) mice, and the mice were sacrificed 24 weeks later. WT and COX-2 deficient mice without H. pylori inoculation were used as controls. The density of H. pylori colonization (by culture), gastric COX-2 protein expression (by Western blotting), gastric prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) levels (by ELISA), the severity of chronic gastric inflammation, apoptosis (by TUNED and proliferation (by Ki-67 assay) of gastric epithelial cells were determined. Results: They were no significant difference in the density of H. pylori colomzation between COX-2 deficient and WT mice. COX-2 protein expression was increased in H. pylori-infected WT mice. There was no COX-2 protein expression in COX-2 deficient mice. Gastric PGE2 levels and gastritis scores were increased in WT and COX-2 deficient mice with H. pyloriinfection compared with uninfected mice. Without H. pyloriinfection, COX-2 deficient mice had higher apoptosis index than WT mice. H. pylori infection induced stronger gastritis and apoptosis, but less cell proliferation m COX-2 deficient mice than in WT mice (Table) . Conclusion: In 24 week H. pylori colonization study model, COX-2 deficiency enhances gastritis and potentiates the AI/PI ratio induced by H. pylori infection. Aim: Helicobacter species establish persistent infection in gastric mucosa. Surfactant Protein D (SP-D), a coflectin of the innate immune system, is expressed in gastric mucosa in vivo and is upregulated in Helicobacter refection. In vitro SP-D binds to H. pylori and H. felis causing aggregation of bacteria. The aim of this study is to determine the role of SP-D in host defence in gastric colonisation by Helicobacter and gastric inflammation and immunity in the SPD deficient mouse model. Methods: Specific pathogen-free SP-D -/-mice (n = 30, C57BL/6 background) and C57BI./6 (n=30) wild type mice were infected by garage with 101 or 103 H.felis for 3 weeks to determine the ability to clear the infection at low infective doses and 107 (3x) H. fells for 12 weeks to further investigate the inflammatory response. Gastric colonisation by H. felis was assessed using histology and real-time PCR T cell proliferative response for H. fells specific antigens was examined by 3H-thymidine incorporation assay. Inflammatory scores were determined by neutrophil counting in four areas of the stomach (cardia, body, transitional zone and antrum). Results: SP-D -/-mice were effectively colonised by H. fells. By 3 weeks post-challenge with 103 infective dose, SP-D 4mice showed a significantly higher colonisation rate to that of the controls (p = 0.04). The T cell proliferative response was also significantly reduced in the absence of SP-D (p = 0.001). Nentrophil responses were not significantly different between SPD-/-and wild type mice. Conclusions: The absence of SP-D is associated with increased susceptibility to low doses of infection, failure in bacterial clearance and reduced levels of T cell response to Helicobacter.",

Schmidt, Frank Schmitz Introduction and Aim: Antimicrohial peptides are effector molecules of the innate immune system and are crucial in gastrointestinal barrier function with ToU-like receptors being pattern recognition receptors in the initiation of such immune responses. The aim of the study was to systematically characterize the expression of various antimicrobial peptides in infectious and non-infections gastritis and to clarify a putative role of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) as well as involved signaling mechanisms. Methods: Gastric biopsies were obtained from patients with informed consent (n = 55; 12 Heficobacter pylori (Hp) positive gastritis, 9 C-gastritis, 5 unspecific gastritis, 23 patients with PPI-therapy, 6 controls without any inflammation or treatment). Gastric AGS cells were incubated with cagA and vacA positive and negative H. pylori strains or pro-inflammatory stimuli. Expression of antimicrobial peptides was quantified by real-time PCR. Intracellular signaling was determined by Western blot analysis and specific blockage of distinct sgnaling molecules. To clarify a putative role of TLRs basal expression patterns were determined and transient transfection of TLR perfromed. Results: The gastric mucosa constitutively expresses ~-defensin 1 (hBD-1) while expression of hBD-2 is induced in both infectious and non-infectious gastritis. Expression of HD-5 and hBD-4 significantly correlated with infection by H. pylori. Expression of antimicrobial peptides RNase 7 and LL-37 was detected in samples of healthy controls as well as in various forms of gastritis with no obvious correlation to infection with Hp. Expression of a-defensin 6 (HD-6), hBD-3, hBD-5 and hBD-6 was not detected. AGS cells constitutively express hBD-1, whereas stimulation with living cagA and vacA positive Hp and Hp lysates but not Hp conditioned media differentially induced the expression of HD-5, hBD-2 and hBD-4. Expression of antimicrobial peptides is induced following activation of TLRs (2 and 5) and is mediated by the MAP kinase ERK1/2 but not p38. Conclusion: Antimicrobial peptides are differentially expressed in infectious and non-infectious gastritis in humans. Induction of peptide expression by H. pylori requires direct contact with the microorganism but not additional mediators. Recognition of H.pylori and initiation o f specific effector molecules seems to be mediated by TLRs. These results suggest, that differential innate immune responses contribute to the protection of gastral mucosa. ",

Aim: We examined whether the TLR4 Asp299Gly poiymorphism influences risk of gastric cancer (GC) in Caucasians. Subjects & Methods: We used PCR-RFLP and 5' nuclease assays to genotype the TLR4 Asp299Gly polymorphism m a Polish populatinn-based case-control study comprising 360 gastric cancer cases and 420 controls. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated and logistic regression was used to adjust for confounding variables. Results: The frequency of the mutation in the control population was similar to other Caucasian populations (7%) and the alldes were in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. There was a significant association between carnage of the Asp299Gly mutation and increased risk of GC (adjusted OR = 2.2, 95% CI: 1.4-3.7). The increased risk applied equally to diffuse and intestinal type GC and was stronger for the non-cardia subsites. The risk was higher for H. pylori positive cases. Conclusions: Our results indicate that carriage of the TLR4 Asp299Gly mutation increases risk of GC in this Caucasian population. We speculate that aberrant handling of LPS (of any origin) due to this mutation leads to an exaggerated inflammatory response that is characterised by severe gastritis, gastric atrophy, hypochlorhydria, and ultimately increased risk of GC. Our findings expand and strengthen the role of host genetic factors in the pathogenesis of H. pylori-induced GC.",

Since they are strategically located between luminal antigens and resident intraepithelial and lamina propria T cells, GEC could play a major role in the immunopathogenesis associated with H. pylon infection. However, during H. pylon infection the T cells are hyporesponsive and do not afford protection. The ligand PD-L1 (B7-H1) on APC binds with the T cell receptor PD-1 that negatively regulates T ceils. Thus, the hypothesis addressed in this study is that GEC express B7-H1 that allow them to inhibit local T cells and contribute to the chroincity of H. pylori infection. Methods: The presence of new B7 members was detected by RT-PCR. Changes in the expression of B7-H1 (PD-L1) by GEC following H. pylori infection were determined by real time quantitative RT-PCR and flow cytometric analysis. The functional role of B7-H 1 in the crosstalk between GEC and T cells was assessed by co-cultnring them in the presence of blocking agents such as antibodies to PD1, B7-H1, 1COS-Ec, B7-HIFc and PDIFc. Results: In addition to the co-stimulator ligand ICOSL, RT-PCR revealed the expression of PD-L1 and PD-L2 by GEC. PD-L1 was also detected by flow cytometry in GEC such as Kato III, N87, AG8 cell lines and also in nontransformed HS738 ceils. PD-L1 expression by GEC increased following H. pylori infection as detected by real time RT-PCR. Interestingly, IFN gamma which is produced during H. pylory infection increased PD-L1 expression by GEC. TNF-alpha also increased PD-L1 expression whereas LPS and IL4 had very little effect in PD-L1 expression. Cocultnring GEC with CD4+T cells revealed the functional role of PD-L1 in promoting T cell apoptosis, in regulating Thl/Th2 cytokine expression and limiting T cell proliferation. Conclusions: Induction of PDL1 in H. pylori treated GEC indicates the possible role of PD-L1 in immunosuppression. Functional studies indicate the involvement of other non-PD1 receptor or other B7-H members in GEC.",

            "text": "Background: Ghrelin is a recently described growth hormone releasing peptide synthesised mainly in the oxyntic mucosa of the stomach. It has a powerful effect on the secretion of growth hormone and directly signals the hypothalamic regulatory nuclei that control energy haemostasis. H. pylori gastritis is invariably associated with a local immune response though the organism generally persists and leads to chronic gastric inflammation. The influence of H. pylon associated gastritis on the regulation of gastric ghrelin has not been studied. We speculate that inflammation of the oxyntic mucosa may impair the ghrelin synthesis. This may account for the association of H. Pylon infection with growth delay in childhood. Methods: Total RNA was extracted from a pair of fundic biopsies. This was reverse transcribed and cDNA was subject to quantitative real time PCR with results normalised to the housekeeping gene hHPRT. H. pylori status was determined by separate antral biopsies. The Ghrelin sequence used was: Ewd:5-ACAACTCCTTGCAGCTCC-3 ;Rev:5-ATCTTCATGAAGG-TAGRCAGTC-3. Statistical analysis was done using Mann Whitney Test. Results: Twenty six patients were recruited for the study, of which five patients had H. pylori gastritis and the rest had normal histology. There was no significant difference in demographics and anthropometrics in the two groups [H. pylori gastritis v Controls; Mean (SD); Age -48(11) v 47(14), p = 0.7; Sex (M: F)-4:5 v 7:10; BMI-28.5(3) v 27.7(4), p = 0.5 and bioimpedence -473(85) v 512(85), p = 0.3]. The Ghrelin/hHPRT mRNA ratio [mean (SD)] was 0.007(0.008) in samples with H. Pylori gastritis compared to 0.038(0.04) in controls (p = 0.01). Conclusion: H. pylon infection is associated with down regulation of gastric fundic gene expression. Reduced gastric production of ghrelin in patients with H. pylori associated gastritis may contribute to extra intestinal manifestations of the infection via reduced GH release and/or via disturbances in the regulation of appetite and energy homeostasis. The mechanism by which the local inflammation inhibits gastric ghrelin expression still remains to be investigated. (Hi) or H. pylori (llp) SS1 strain. Infected animals (n = 33) plus controls (n = 17) were sacrificed at 36 and 62 weeks post-infection (p.i.). Infection was confirmed by culture and/or histology. Serum gastrin was measured by radioimmunoassay. Haematoxylin and eosin, and anti-chromogranin stained sections were used to grade gastric pathology and enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells respectively. Results: All Hf and Hp inoculated gerbils were infected. Gastric pathology with Hf at 62 weeks p.i. was greater in the corpus than the antrum, consisting of marked atrophy of parietal/chief cells, cystic changes and mucous metaplasia. In the antrum at 62 weeks, Hp was associated with significantly greater chronic inflammation (p< 0.05), polymorph activity (p< 0.005) and atrophy (p< 0.003) than Hr.",

Long-term Hf infection results in corpus predominant gastritis, elevated gastrin, ECL cell hyperplasia and gastric carcinoids. Hp-infection in Mongolian gerbils is an established experimental model of gastric carcinogenesis resulting from the long-term infection of gastric mucosa by this germ but the role of gastrin or prolonged hipergastrinemia induced by omeprazole treatment in these animals remians to be established. We studied the effects of intragastric inoculation of Mongolian gerbils with Hp strain (cagA + vacA +, 5x106 CFU/ml) isolated from gastric ulcer patient. Hp infected and non-infected gerbils received daily treatment for the 3 weeks with: 1) vehicle (saline); 2) gastrin-17 (10 nmolfag i.p.); 3) pentagastrin (40 nmol/kg s.c.) and 4) omeprazole (10 mg/kg s.c.). At 4, 12, 30 and 60 wks upon Hp inoculation, the morphological changes in glandular mucosa were assessed by histology, the viable Hp analyzed by rapid urease test and density of Hp-colonization was evaluated by counting of the number colonies per plate. In addition, gastric blood flow (GBF) was measured by H~-gas clearance technique, plasma gastrin was determined by RIA and expression of COX-2 protein was assessed by Western Blot. The Hp infection was detected in all animals by histology, Hp culture and rapid urease test. Early lesions were seen 4 wks upon Hp-inoculation and consisted of chronic gastritis with increased mucosal foldings and elongated interfuveolar ridges and formation of multiple lymphoid follicles in the gastric mucosa. By the end of study typical adenomateous hyperplasia with cellular atypia was observed together with atrophic gastritis, intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia and intraepithelial neoplasia, especially in gerbils treated with gastrins or omeprazole. In Hp-infected gerbils, plasma gastriu levels was increased by 4-5 folds and the sigmficant rise in the mucosal protein expression of COX-2 were observed and these effects were markedly enhanced in gerbils treated with gastrin-17, pentagastrin and omeprazole. The GBF in Hp-infected gerbils treated with gastrin-17, pentagastnn or omeprazole was significantly lower than that in Hp-infected treated with vehicle and this decrease in GBF remained constant until the end of observation period. We conclude that gastrin and prolonged hypergastrinemia caused by long omeprazole treatment with the subsequent COX-2 induction play a major role in the development of typical functional changes such as impairment of gastric mucosal microcirculation and by promoting of pathological changes leading to gastric carcinogenesis.",

            "text": "Helicobacter Pylori Infection of the Human Antral Cell Line, NCI-N87, Alters Expression Levels of the Cell Matrix Proteins Dystroglycan and PaxiUin, Resulting in Increased Rates of Migration Jian Kang, Victoria S. Conlin, Susan Curtis, Ying Zhao, Edwin Moore, Steven Pelech, Alison Buchan AIM: Wound-closure requires epithelial cells to migrate as a sheet, as opposed to single cells. We predict that this is achieved by altering the expression of cell matrix proteins whilst cefl:cell adhesion protein expression remains constant. Dystroglycan is one of the proteins involved in maintaining the attachment of epithelial cells to the basement membrane. These experiments addressed the question of whether Heflcobacter pylon infection altered the expression of attachment proteins dystroglycan and paxiflin and cell migration rates. METHODS: Cells were starved for 24h prior to infection with wild type (cag A+/vac A+) H. pylon and incubated for a further 24h. For migration assays a wound was made across the centre of the well and the rate of wound closure monitored at 12h intervals over a 48h period. Cells were lysed in the presence of protease inhihitors for immunoprecipitation experiments or fixed in paraformaldebyde for immunocytochemical analysis usmg deconvolution microscopy. RESULTS: Western blot analysis of H. pylori infected NCI-N87 ceils revealed a decrease in dystroglycan protein expression in conjunction with an increase in both paxiUin protein expression and tyrosine phosphorylation (12.6% above control, n = 2). Parallel immunocytochemical analysis showed translocation of dystroglycan and paxilin away from the basal membrane that was correlated with increased cell migration (28.6% above control, n = 4). CONCLUSION: H. pylori infection increases the migratory rate of epithelial cells, in part, by decreasing dystroglycan levels and altering the distribution of paxiflin and focal adhesions. Background: Beta-defensins are a family of endogenous anti-microbial peptides that engage in host defence most prominently at mucosal epithelia and skin. We and others have previously shown human bera-defensin (hBD)-2 and -3 to be potent bactericidal agents against H. pylori. At present the identity of signalling pathways involved in host-bacterial cross talk leading to modulation of defensin expression remain largely unknown. In the present study we are investigated the role of NFkB and MAP Kinase signalling events, which are both central players in inflammatory immune responses, in the regulation of hBD-2 and-3. Methods: AGS gastric epithelial cells were infected with cytotoxic H. pyloristrains (84183, 60190) and defensin gene expression quantified. Activation of MApK pathways was followed by detection with phospho-speciflc antibodies to ERK, p38 andJNK enzymes. NFkB activation was determined by lkBa degradation and p65 phosphorylation. Results and Conclusions: All three MAP kinase pathways were activated by wild type bacterial strains with a potent rapid induction of ERK (5mins) followed by slower induction of JNK and p38 pathways (30-40mins). IkBa degradation was maximal by 30rains, a rate similar to that observed during IL-lb stimulation. MAP kinase inhibitor studies suggest a critical role for the ERK pathway in bacterial-induced but not IL-lb stimulated defensin gene expression. We are currently delineating the upstream signalling events that are likely to be responsible for the differential defensin gene expression observed during infection and inflammation. IL-l~-511 polymorphism was evaluated with 5' nuclease PCR assays (TaqMan) and IL-1RN with VNTR. Results: IL-l~-511 C/C was found at the 26%, 18%, '27%, and 20% in the control, stomach cancer, BGU, and DU patients, respectively. IL-lf3-511 C/T was found at the 50%, 55%, 42%, and 69% in the control, stomach cancer, BGU, and DU patients, respectively. IL-lf3-511 T/T, suggesting of high expression of IL-1[3 was found at the 24%, 27%, 31%, and 11% in the control, stomach cancer, BGU, and DU patients, respectively. The Odds ratios of IL-l}-511 TFf in each disease such as stomach cancer, BGU and DU compared with control were 1.20 (C.I. 0.59-3.40), 1.44 (C.I. 0.84-2.53), and 0.38 (C.I. 0.16-0.84, *P=0.019), respectively. IL-IRN UL was found at the 91%, 91%, 88%, and 86% in the control, stomach cancer, BGU, and DU patients, respectively. IL-IRN L/2 was found at the 9%, 7%, 11%, and 14% in the control, stomach cancer, BGU, and DU patients, respectively. IL-1RN 2/2 was found at the 0%, 2%, 1%, and 0% in the control, stomach cancer, BGU, and DU patients, respectively. There was no difference of IL-1RN 2/2 depending on each disease, partly originated from the low proportion of 2/2 expression in Korea. These results of IL-1B-511 and IL-1RN were very similar in the analysis of Hp-positive subjects of each disease or control. Conclusion: There was slightly increased proportion of IL-l~-511 T/T genotype in the group of stomach cancer or BGU than in control, but without statistical significance. However, the IL-1~-511 T/l-genotype significantly protected DU occurrence by Hp infection in Korea. The impact of long-term acid suppression on development of gastric glandular atrophy in Helicohacter pylon (Hp)-infected patients has been debated vigorously. It has also been suggested that marked acid inhibition might induce gastritis through colonisation by other bacteria than Hp. Patients and methods We report the seven year follow up analysis of biopsies from the gastric corpus mucosa in patients with Reflux Esophagitis, randomised to omeprazole therapy (OME) or to anti-reflux surgery (ARS).155 patients were randomised to ARS of whom 144 subsequently were operated. 155 were randomised to omeprazole of whom 154 were treated. After seven years, 113 patients m the OME group and 98 patients in the ARS group remained in the study. Biopsies taken from the corpus mucosa were Scored according to the Sydney Classification System. 60 ARS patients remained Hp-negative throughout the study period, 3 initially Hp-neg turned Hp-pos, 12 initially Hp-pos turned negative and finally 12 were persistently Hp-pos. The corresponding numbers in the OME group were 83, 3, 10, and 13 patients. Results In the biopsies from patients who remained Hp-negative throughout the study, there was no development of atrophy. Signs of chronic inflammation was a rare phenomenon and decreased in both groups. None had signs of activity of gastritis. In the 25 Hp-infected patients, the atrophy score improved in one and deteriorated in five omeprazole treated patients. The corresponding figures in ARS treated patients were one and three. Some progression of inflammation scores was noted in the omeprazole group while no changes were seen in the ARS group. Conclusion Long-term acid inhibition does not alter the oxyntic mucosal morphology in Hp-negative GERD-patients. There are no indications of a major influence of long-term acid inhibition on the development of glandular atrophy in the gastric mucosa in Hp-positive patients. Helicobacter pylori (H.pylori) infection is probably acquired in childhood and it causes a vigorous immune response. It is unclear as to why only a subgroup of infected children develop peptic ulceration. We have reported a trend of lceA1 strains causing severe disease in children (Journal of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition 35:680-684; 2002) However, the pathogenesis does not depend solely on ulcerogenic strains of H.pylori but also on the variability of the host response. Aim: The aim of this study was to assess the significance of TNF-u promoter polymorphism in relation to infection with H.pylori strains in children. Methods: 81 antral biopsies of H.pylori positive children (aged 2-18 years) were analyzed. 19 children had duodenal disease including erosive duodenitis and/or duodenal ulceration and 62 had gastritis only. H.pylori infection was diagnosed by bacterial culture and histology. Genomic DNA extracted from the antral biopsy was used to characterize the genetic polymorphism of TNF-R promoter at nucleotide positions -308 and -238 by PCR-based restriction fragment length polymorphism. All H.pylon strains were examined for CAG, VAC and IceA1. Results : 31% of children with duodenal disease were infected with lceA1 positive strains and had the -238 G to A polymorpfiism in the TNF -c~ promoter vs. only 1.6% of children with gastritis alone (p<O.O005, Fishers exact test). Conclusion: The combination of bacterial IceA1 and TNF-c~ 238 G to A polymorphism may be a risk factor for peptic ulcer disease in children infected with H.pylori. Larger studies are needed to confirm this association.",

            "text": "Heficobacter pylori (H.p.) infection has been linked to gastric mucosal hyperprofiferation and carcinogenesis, however the mechanisms involved in this relation are not fully elucidated yet. p53 modulates cell proliferation and differentiation by regulating the transcription of several gene products. Tyrosine kinases are involved in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, transformation and tumor progression. AlMS & METHODS: The aim of the study was to evaluate the correlation between gastric mucosal inflammation grade, total tyrosine kmases (w-k) activities, proliferative activity (by the Ki-67 labeling index estimation) and p53 expression in patients with H. pylori infection. 50 patients with H. pylori infection and 10 -H. pylori negative controls have been included into the study. Biopsy specimens from gastric mucosa of all subjects have been assessed for inflammation degree (according to update Sydney classification), Ki-67 and p53 immunohistochemistry with monoclonal antibodies as well as total tyrosine kinases activities with ELISA assay kit. RESULTS: Total tyr-k activities and Ki-67 labeling index (LI) were sigmficantly higher in H.p. (+) than H.p. (-) group (614.23 +_ 31.05 vs. 306.2 _+ 23.5 pmolP/mg/min; p < 0.01 and 25.2 _+ 1.3% vs. 11.2 _+ 0.5%; p < 0.001, respectively). The significant correlation (r = 0.8) has been observed between the Ki-67 LI and total tyr-k activities in all examined subjects, p53 immunoreactivity has only been detected in 20% patients with intestinal metaplasia. In addition, p53 accumulation was more commonly detected than in others in patients with severe grade of chronic gastritis (p < 0.01). Mean gastric mucosal total tyr-k activities in patients with p53 immunoreactivity yielded 777.2 _+ 50 pmolP/mg/min, which was significantly higher (p < 0.05) than in p53 -negative subjects: 506.6 -+ 32.3 pmolP/mg/min. There was no significant correlation between Ki-67 LI and p53 immunoreactivity in all examined patients. CONCLUSION: Those results suggest that tyrosine kinases may play an important role in the development of gastric mucosal hyperprofiferation in H. pyloninduced chronic gastritis and possibly in early gastric carcinogenesis. Our results lend further support to the hypothesis that p53 mutation may be an early event in the stomach carcinogenesis in the course of H.pylori infection. The study was supported with Polish Committee for Scientific Research (grant 6P05B12121).",

PPARy is expressed in human gastric cancer as well as in colon cancer. Activation of PPARy by figand produces pro-apoptutic effect and ameliorate growing of cancer cells. H. pylori is main etiologic agent for gastric inflammation, and raises the cell turnover of gastric epithelium. Longstanding infection with this organism is related to development of non-cardia gastric cancer. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of H. pylori on the expression of PPAR'y mRNA and protein in chronic gastritis. Methods: Gastric biopsy samples were taken from H. pylori infected (n = 18) and noninfected (n = 21 ) patients during endoscopic examination. PPARy mRNA was quantified by real time PCR, and normalized for 18SrRNA (data expressed as relative copy numbers). PPARy protein expression was evaluated by image analysis of immunohistochemical staining. Staining intensity was graded 0 (no staining) to 4 (intense staining). Results: PPARy was localized to the nuclei of the foveolar epithelial cells in infected and unifected mucosa. PPAR~' protein expression was higher in H. pylori infected patients than noninfected patients (3.83 + 0.38 vs. 2.62 _+ 0.97 Hp infected and noninfected, respectively; p< 0.01). However, PPARy mRNA levels were not significantly different (24 + 18 vs. 29 + 25 Hp infected and noninfected, respectively; P>0.05). Also, we could not deduce the apparent relation for the expression between PPARy mRNA and PPAR'y proteins in immunohistochemistry. Conclusion: PPAR'~ expression is increased in H. pylon infected chronic gastritis.",

            "text": "We examined the effect of H. pylori infection and of the nitrosatnig carcinogen ethyl-nitronitrosognanidine (ENNG) on expression of ILlb and MGMT. We also currently investigate whether cancer does emerge, as reported in monkeys after 1 year of ENNG (J Natl Cancer Inst i986). Gastruscopies were performed in 23 monkeys naturally infected with H. pylori. Biopsies were fixed for histology, cultured, or flash frozen for molecular analyses, mRNA expression of I-I. pylori 16S rRNA, 1L-lb, and MGMT were determined using an absolute quantitative RT-PCR (TaqMan) method, standard curves of cloned RNA fragments, and normalization with b-actin (copies/100 ng RNA). Statistical significance was calculated using Kruskal-Walhs tests and ANOVA. The infection was cured with quadruple therapy and the animals were divided into four groups: controls (C, n = 5); inoculation of a virulent H. pylon strain isolated from a patient with gastric cancer (H, n =6); ENNG (E, 30 mg/day, n=6); and H. pylori inoculation + ENNG (started 6 months post-inoculation; H+E, n = 6). Follow-up gastroseopies and biopsies were performed at regular intervals. FoLLowing antibiotics, cultures were negative, expression of 16s rRNA and n-lb were suppressed (p <0.05), and MGMT expression did not change significantly. At 14 months post inoculation, both H and H + E groups had antraL gastritis and H. pyLori were present in the gastric lumen, attached to epithelial cells, and in the lamina propria. Recovered isolates were identical to the input strain by RAPD fingerprinting and therefore are being studied by microarray DNA analysis. 1L-lb expression increased in H. pylori infected monkeys and MGMT expression increased in H, E, and H+E compared to C (Table) . lLlb and MGMT mRNA expression was significantly correlated with 16S rRNA expression both in H and H + E (p <0.05). Thus, expression of the DNA repair gene initially increases during exposure to H. pylon and/or ENNG but, similar to the earlier report, cancer has not appeared after 8 months of ENNG. Repeat endoscopies continue to be performed at 2-month intervals. Background & aims: Notch signaling system plays an important role in the process of tissue development and cell differentiation. This is mediated through inhibitory effects of hairy and enhancer of split homologue (Hes) proteins on basic helix-loop-heLix (bHLH) type transcriptional factors. Id (Inhibitors of differentiation / DNA binding) proteins also act as negative regulators of bIHLH proteins. These molecules are known to participate in intestinal cell differentiation, but little is known of their contribution to the gastric mucosal development. The present study investigated the expression of Notch receptors and Id proteins in the human gastric mucosa with or without H.pylori infection. Materials & Methods: Endoscopic biopsy specimens were obtained from 7 H.pylori-negative volunteers and 15 H.pyloripositive chronic gastritis cases with their consents. Immunohistochemistry of Notch-l, 2, 4 receptors and ld-I, 2 proteins was performed by a stmptoavidin-biotin peroxidase method using formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded sections. Results: In normal gastric mucnsa, Notch 1, 2, 4 receptors and ld-1, 2 proteins were expressed in the cells located around glandular isthmus and parietal cells, but not in surface epithelial cells. The expression of Notch-2 was relatively weak in comparison to Notch-1 and 4. H.pylori-infected gastric mucosa was accompanied with various levels of inflammation or intestinal metaplasia. Different from H.pylori-negative cases, the expression of Notch receptors and Id proteins in H.pylor~-positive cases was extended to the upper part of surface epithelial cells corresponding to degrees ofinflarnmatory cell infiltration. In addition, columnar cells of intestinal metaplasia extensively expressed Notch receptors and ld proteins from the basal part to the surface of pits, but goblet cells did not express them. Conclusions: The present study suggests that Notch receptors and ld proteins may play an important role in gastric mucosal cell differentiation. Changes in their expression patterns may contribute to the deviation from the gastric type of cell lineage commitment relating to the development of intestinal metaplasia in the gastric mucosa with H.pylori infection.",

            "text": "Masahiko Nakamura, Hidenori Matsui, Kaori Nishikawa, Shinichi Takahashi, Kanji Tsuchimoto During our previous investigation of the mouse gastric mucosa infected with Helicohacter heflmannii-hked organism (HHHLO), these bacilli were found to be localized in the deeper fundic and antral glands, compared with Hehcohacter pylon. In addition, administration of H2 blockers to HHLO-infeeted mice brought about the increased apoptotic parietal cells. Thus, the present study was undertaken to clarify the precise alteration of the parietal cell differentiation in the HHLO-infected and acid-suppressant-administered mouse gastric mucosa. Materials and methods C57BL6 mice infected with HHLO for 6 months were used in the following experiments. After treatment with cimetidine or lansoprazole (30 mg/kg b.w., every 12 hours for 3 days) through orogastric intuhation, the cells immunoreactive to Musashi-1, one of the RNA-binding proteins specifically localized in the cytoplasm of the stem cells of the digestive tract, were detected by the indirect immunohistochemical method. In addition, the number of the BrdU-reactive parietal cells was investigated by the double staining with anti-BrdU and H, K-ATPase monoclonal antibodies. The number of the parietal cell nucleus was calculated by electron microscopy. To clarify the conversion from the mucous neck cell to the parietal cells, the double staining with HIK1083 monoclonal antibody, one of the antibodies against glandular mucous cell, and H, K-ATPase was also performed. The localization of the HHLO in the fundic gland was shown using the antibodies against Hp and type IV secretory apparatus, VirB7. Results Multinucleated or Musashi-1 or BrdU-immunoreactive parietal cells increased just under the HHLO-habited apoptotic parietal cells in the base of the fundic glands in the cimetidine-treated group but not in the control and fansoprazole-treated groups. Most of these positive cells were not immunoreactive to HIK1083, suggesting that these parietal ceils dedifferentiate from the mature parietal cells and not derive from the mucous neck cells. In conclusion, H2 blocker administration to the HHLO-infected mouse was shown to bring about the dedifferentiation of the parietal cell located in the base of the fundic gland. The transcription factor Foxll is expressed in the mesoderm-derived tissues Like kidney and mesenchyme of the digestive tract, but is not expressed in the endoderm-derived epithelial ceils. We generated Foxll knock out (KO) mice and analyzed the phenotype of the KO mice. The loss of Foxll gene led to a severe reduction in acid secretion and it could not be stimulated by histamine, gastrin, bethanechol or cAMP. To investigate the mechanism of impairment in acid secretion in Foxll KO mice, we assessed the expression of H,K-ATPase alpha-and beta-subunits by western blotting, and found that the expression of both alphaand beta-subunits was reduced in Foxll KO mice compared to wild-type (WT) mice. It is possible that the reduced expression of H,K-ATPase results from the decreased number of parietal cells in Foxll KO mice. To test the possibihty, we performed the histochemical analysis of parietal cells using a parietal cell-specific lectin, DBA. There was no significant difference in the number of parietal cells between WT and Foxll KO mice. We also performed flow cytometry to examine the expression level of H,K-alpha, and found that Foxll KO parietal cells express a smaller amount of H,K-aIpha than WT parietal cells. Electron microscopic observation revealed that there is no apparent difference in the ultrastmctures of parietal cells at the non-stimulated state between WT and Foxll KO mice. However, when treated with histamine, secretory canaliculi of Foxll KO parietal cells was not expanded, nor fully connected to the apical membrane, like in WT cells. The finding indicated that, in Foxll KO mice, fusion between tubuLovesicles and secretory canaliculi might be obstructed, and prompted us to study the expression of syntaxin3, VAMP2, Rab3a, Rab11, SNAP25 and ARF6, which were thought to regulate the membrane fusion event between tubulovesides and secretory canaliculi in parietal cells. The expression level of syntaxin3, VAMP2, Rab3a, Rabl 1 and ARF6 proteins is not almost equivalent between WT and Foxll KO mice, whereas that of SNAP25 protein decreased in Foxll KO mice compared with WT mice. These results indicate that the expression of SNAP25 as well as H,K-ATPase aLpha-and beta-subunits is perturbed in the absence of Foxll. Defect in acid secretion from Foxll KO parietal cells seems to result from the combined effect of the impairment in membrane fusion between tubulovesicles and secretory canalicuh due to reduced SNAP25 and the decrease in the expression of H,K-ATPase alpha-and beta-subunits for proton excretion. Background and Aims: Duodenal mucosal bicarbonate secretion (DMBS) provides an important first line of duodenal mucosal defense against gastric acid. Ca ~ + -dependent secretagogues, such as carbachoL, induce an increase in intracellular Ca 2+, which stimulates DMBS. However, the underlying Ca2+handling mechanisms are still unclear in duodenal mucosa. The aim of the present study was to determine the source and clearance of intracellular Ca 2+ utilized for DMBS in mice. Methods: Duodenal mucosae from NIH Swiss mice were stripped of seromnscular faters and mounted in Ussing chambers. Short-circuit current (Isc) was measured. Expression of sodium/calcium exchanger (NCX) and transient receptor potential-like channel (TRP) in duodenal mucosae was analyzed by Western blot. Results: Carbachol (100 p.M) induced an increase in Isc in a biphasic manner: an initial peak (6.0 + 0.4 vs 2.3 -+ 0.3 IzEq/cm~-h, n= 15, P<0.001) and second plateau (3.3 \"4-0.4 vs 2.3 + 0.3 p~Eq/ cm2-h, n= 15, P<0.05). Carbachol-induced increases in DMBS and Isc are mediated by mnscarinic receptors and extraceLlular Ca 2+ since 10 ~M atropine or Ca2+-free solutions totally abolished the effects of carbachol (n = 5, P<0.01). Preatreatment with cyclopiazonic acid (10 g~M) or caffeine (10mM) alone increased basal Isc but did not prevent carhacholinduced increases in lsc (n=6, P<0.05). However, the combination of cyclopiazonic acid and caffeine abolished the initial lac peak increased by carbachol. Nifedipine (10 p,M), a voltage-gated calcium channel blocker and SKF-96365 (100 g.M), a receptor-operated calcium channel blocker, had no effect on responses to carbachol (n= 6, P<0.05). Nickel (lmM), a TRP blocker, did not affect the initial peak (4.8 -+ 0.9 vs 5.4 \u00b1 0.6 p~Eq/cm 2h, n=6, P<0.05) but prevented the second plateau (2.0 _+ 0.2 vs 3.3 \u00b1 0.4 p~Eq/cm:-h, n = 6, P<0.05) induced by carbachoL. Moreover, KBR-7943 (30 p.M), an inhibitor of NCX, potentiated the second plateau (4.0 + 0.2 vs 3.1 \u2022 0.3/zEq/cm2-h, n = 7, P<0.05) induced by carhachoL Western blot analysis showed expression of NCX1 and TRP4 proteins in duodenal mucosae. Conclusion: These results underscore the importance of intracellufar Ca 2 + for the regulation of duodenal mucosa[ ion transport, and possibly of DMBS. Stimulation of muscarinic receptors may cause not only Ca 2\u00f7 release from both 1P3-and caffeine-sensitive intracellular stores, but also extracellular Ca 2+ entry via TRP. NCX may be involved in Ca 2+ clearance from the cytosol to resolve the effects of mnscarinic stimulation.",

Several studies have demonstrated that kip stimulates production of this cytokine in human gastric mucosa and in cultured primary gastric epithelial cells. Despite these observations, the cellular constituents from which IL 18 originates in the stomach have not been established. Objective: We performed the following studies to examine 1L-18 gene expression and regulation in primary gastric mucosal ceils. Methods: Canine gastric mucosal cells were isolated by collagenase digestion and several populations (chief, mucous, and parietal cells) were enriched by counter flow dutriation/percoll density centrifugation and cultured on matrigel-coated plates. Expression of IL-18 was examined by RT-PCR using canine IL-18 primers: 5'-ATGGCTAC-TAACTAATAGAAGAC-3' and 5'-CTAGCTCTTGTTTTGAACAGTGAA-3'. RT-PCR products (550 bp) were analyzed by electropboresis on 1.5% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide and bands were examined under UV light for the presence of the amplified DNA. Results: IL-18 mRNA expression was constitutively detected only in gastric parietal cells. TNF-alpha (50 ng/ml) significantly stimulated IL-18 gene expression in a time dependent fashion. The maximal response was 215.4_+25.6% above basal (n= 3, p<0.05) after 2 hours, returning to baseline within 24 hours. To examine the signaling pathway by which TNF-alpha induces 1L-18 gene expression, gastric parietal cells, were pretreated with the NF-kappa B inhibitor PDTC (1055M), PKC inhibitor GF109203 (10-~M), PI3 kinase/Akt inhibitor LY294002 (10 6M) or the ERK inhibitor PD98050 (10 eM) for 30 min. PDTC abolished TNF-alpha induced IL-18 gene expression. Furthermore, LY294002 partially inhibited the stimulatory effect of TNF-alpha on IL-18 gene expression from 226.2_+22.9% to 126.3_+30.2% above basal (45.5_+ .3% inhibition) (n = 3, p<0.05). GF109203 and PD98050 did not alter the effect of TNF-alpha. Conclusions: We demonstrate that only gastric parietal cells express IL-18. In addition, TNF-alpha stimulates IL-18 gene expression via NF-kappa B and PI3 kinase/ Akt pathways. These results suggest that non-inflammatory cells can express this important cytokine and that gastric parietal cells may play a role in mediating the action of IL-18 in the gastric mucosa.",

However, many of the proteins expressed by this cell are unknown and likely to have physiological relevance. Aims: To determine specifically expressed genes of the rat parietal cell using subtractive comparison approach with digonudeotide expression microarrays. Methods: Microarray technology was applied using subtracrive comparison. Rat gastric mucosal pronase digest was fractionated by centrifugation on 14% nycodenz gradient, elutriated at 45-60 ml/min at 1800 rpm and purified further on a 9% nycodenz gradient. Parietal cells in the primary digest (25%) were purified to 85% homogeneity as measured either by immunostaining or auto fluorescence (3.4 x enrichment). RNA of purified cells and mucosal digest were separately labeled with Cy-3 and Cy-5 and co-hybridized to an Agilent oligonucleotide expression array (n = 3). RNA from genes which are specifically expressed by parietal cells should be increased at least -> 3 fold, and RNA which is ::\" 3 fold decreased is likely absent in parietal cells. Results: 87 of the 22K genes on the array\" were enriched more then 5 fold. These included heat shock proteins, cell cycle and proliferation genes, perhaps due to cell preparation. An additional 585 genes were found to be 3-5 fold enriched. Most marker genes for parietal cells were enriched (M3 (3.3-+0.8) and H2 (2.2-+0.9) receptors, mitochondrial proteins (2.7_+0.5) etc). Specific genes present in parietal cells included potassium channels KCNQ1 (6.5 _+ 2) and KCNE2 (2.7 \u00b1 1.1), Na facilitated glucose transporter Ghit4 (5.2 _+ 0.8), prostaglandin receptor EP313 (3.4 \u00b1 0.8), prostaglandin transporter Pgt2 (3.9 _+ 0.4), endocytoric apical membrane associated glycoprotein GP2 (7.7 \u00b1 2.4), cytoskeletal proteins ezrin (3 \u00b1 1.8) and SNAP25 (2.9 \u00b1 1.4). KCNQI expression was confirmed by real time PCR with GAPDH as control. The Agilent rat microarray does not contain a valid oligonucleotide for HK-ATPase a or [3 subunits but real time PCR showed an increase ofa subunit expression by -> 2.8. 479 genes were found to be decreased including pepsinogen (2.3 \u00b1 1.3), mucin (4 _+ 0.6), somatostatin (1.6 _+ 0.5) and ghrelin (1.4 _+ 0.3). Conclusion: The combination of cell purification and subtractive comparison microarray technology leads to a snapshot of the overall physiological gene expression patterns of parietal cells. This method can be used to identify novel genes expressed in the parietal cell.",

GABA effects on GAS have not been characterized in mice. AIMS: To determine the effects of GABA on GAS secretion in mice and the involvement of GABAa, GABAB and GAB& receptors. METHODS: In urethane-anesthetized mice GAS was monitored at 10-rain intervals by continuous intragastric perfusion with saline and backtitration to pH 7.0. The effects of iv GABA and selective GABAA (muscimol), GABAB (R-baclofen and SKF-9754l) and GABAc (imidazole 4-acetic acid hydrochloride) agonists on GAS were investigated. RESULTS: Basal GAS was low in urethane-anesthetized mice (0.61 \u00b1 0.03 [mu] tool/h). GABA (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 and 100 mg/kg, iv, n=4) did not modify basal GAS. The GAB& agonist, R-baclofen, (0.1, 0.3, 1 and 3 mg/kg, iv) stimulated GAS in a dose-related manner (0.71 _+0.04, 1.07 \u00b1 0.41, 2.23 -+ 0.63 and 7.07 -+ 1.68 [mu[ mol/h respectively: n = 3 for each). Similarly, the potent GABAB agonist, SKF-97541, (0.01, 0.03, 0.06, 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg, iv) also Stimulated GAS in a dose-related manner (0.61 -+ 0.05, 0.78 _+ 0.12, 0.96 _+ 0.21, 2.92 _+ 0.6 and 7.99 -+ 0.93 [muJ mol/h, respectively; n=6 for each). The GAB& agonist, muscimol, (0.1, 0.3 and 1 mg/kg, iv) did not affect basal GAS. The GABAc agonist, imidazole, (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg, iv) had a tendency to inhibit basal GAS at 3 mg/kg (0.36_+0.14 [mu] tool/h, n=4; P=0.07 vs basal: 0.64\u00b10.11 [mu] tool/h) and significantly reduced basal GAS at 10 mg/kg (0.21_+0.03 {mu] tool/h, n=4; P=0.006 vs basal). Stimulatory responses to SKF-97541 (0.1 mg/kg) were similar to those elicited by vagal stimulation with 2-deoxy-D-glucose, and were prevented by pretreatment with the selective GABA~ antagonist, 2-hydroxysaclofen, (5 mg/kg, iv) (0. [ mol/h, n=3) . CONCLUSIONS: In mice, activation of GABAB receptors stimulates GAS through a colinergic, vagally-mediated, mechanism. Lack of effects of GABA might be related to its inability to cross the blood-brain barrier.",

            "text": "The benzimidazole family of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) including: omeprazole, lansoprazole and pantoprazole are commonly recognized as effective treatment for hyperacidity and gastroesophageal reflux disease. These compounds are thought to be neutral and inactive until introduced into an acidic environment. There they undergo chemical rearrangement, leaving them reactive to form disulfide bonds with the F1/K ATPase pump near the target membranes. Recent evidence suggests that pantoprazole may react differently with I-l/K, forming a non-reducible bond (Gastment. 123:1588 (Gastment. 123: , 2002 . That is, reducing agents efficiently remove PPIs from H/K-associated binding, restoring acid secretion, except for pantoprazole. To examine the molecular basis of these findings we studied the reactivity of PPIs with defined synthetic peptides using mass spectrometry and 2D NMR. We also present a method to determine PP1 site of action in vivo. Consistent with earlier findings, conversion of drug to an activated form is highly dependent on pH. At moderate pH (3-4) the drugs rapidly degrade into non reactive products. When activated at lower pH, modeling primary acid secretion, the activated forms are stabilized, though less reactive towards our synthetic peptides. Our results also demonstrate that activated PPIs are more selective in suflhydryl binding, and variable in reaction, than originally thought. The irreducible nature of pantoprazole binding is not a simple steric hindrance but due to a previously undocumented reaction in the presence of primary amines.",

Orlando AIM/BACKGROUND: The epithelium of the human G1 tract can be studied effectively by mounting endoscopic biopsies in mini-Ussing chambers (J Lab Clin Med 1998; 132:512-8). We therefore used this technology to compare the basic electrical data and sodium transport capacity for esophageal stratified squamous epithelium (ESSE) and Barrett's specialized columnar epithelium (BSCE). METHODS: Endoscopic jumbo biopsies were obtained from subjects with normal ESSE or subjects with BSCE and these mounted in mini-Ussing chambers (lucite rings of aperture diameter 2 ram) for measurement of potential difference (PD), short-circint current (lsc) and calculation of total electrical resistance (RT) while bathed in normal Ringer solution at 37\u00b0C, pH 7.4, gassed with 95%OJ5%CO> RESULTS: (Means \u00b1 SEM). For ESSE (n = 7) vs BSCE (n = 5): basal PD was -1.06 \u00b1 0.26 vs -3.32 _+ 2.24 mV; Isc was 2.89-+0.75 vs 29.82_+15.81 uAmps/cm 2 and R~ was 415-+84 vs 80-+15 ohm.cm 2. Notably basal Isc and RT were significantly different for ESSE vs BSCE (p< 0.05) and this was consistent with differences reported in vivo for esophageal PD of ESSE and BSCE. Removal of sodium from luminal and serosal bathing solutions reduced Isc for ESSE and BSCE by 89 -+ 6% vs 42 -+ 12%, respectively (p<0.05), and sodium restoration restored Isc to basal levels. Serosal addition of ouabain, 1 raM, reduced Isc by ->89% for all tissues. CONCLUSIONS: These data document that ESSE and BSCE have distinctive electrical properties and these can be assessed in vitro in endoscopic jumbo biopsies mounted in mini-Ussing chambers. Further, BSCE has higher net ion transport capability and lower transepithefial RT than ESSE; and unlike ESSE, more than 50% of net ion transport in BSCE is independent of net sodium movement. Based on direction of the current, this could reflect either chloride and/or bicarbonate secretion by BSCE. Support: DK063669.",

The percentage time of intragastric pH<4.0 was significantly higher in H. pylori negative cases than that in H. pylori positive cases. The tolerance phenomenon to H2RA was observed during 14-day administration of both drugs in H. pylori negative cases, as reported previously. On the other hand, the tolerance phenomenon was not observed in H. pylori positive cases during 14-day continuous administration of famotidine or la[utidine. IConclnsions] The tolerance phenomenon to H2RA treatment occurred during 14-day administration of lafutidine as well as famotidine. This study also clearly demonstrated that the tolerance phenomenon to H2RA is not observed in cases with Helicobacter pylori infection. Background: Gastric carcinoma is strongly associated with H. pylori infection and also with a high dietary salt intake. Both these carcinogenic factors are associated with a reduction of gastric acid secretion. However, the direct effect of high salt intake on acid production is poorly documented. The gerbil has been shown to be a model for investigating the pathogenesis of gastric cancer. In addition, gerbils, being desert animals, are tolerant of the high dietary salt intake. This tolerance creates a unique opportunity to investigate the effect of high salt intake on gastric acid secretion. Methods: Gerbils were divided into 2 groups. Animals in the first (acute treatment) group were orally fed with either 2 ml of 0.85%, 4%, 6% or 8% NaCl solution, 30 min. before ligation of the stomach. The second (chronic treatment) group was fed a high salt (8% NaCl) rodent diet and gerbils were tested for their acid secretory capacity at 8 and 16 weeks. In this study, the method of pylorus ligation was employed in both groups to determine in vivo gastric acid secretion. The stomach was excised three hours after ligation, the volume of gastric juice measured, and acidity and total acid output were determined by titrating the gastric juice with 0.1M NaOH to pH 7. Results: In the acute treatment group, there was significant 70% reduction in the total acid output in the gerbils orally fed with 8% NaC1 solution as compared to the untreated and normal saline fed (0.85% NaCl) controls (5.023 vs 16.654 vs 17.279 p.Eq/3h/100g, P<0.01, respectively). In contrast, the volume of gastric juice was significantly higher in 4%, 6% and 8% NaC1 fed gerbils than in untreated and normal saline fed controls (1.914, 1.964 and 2.i82 vs 0.775 and 1.024 ml/3h/100g, P<0.01, respectively). In the chronic treatment group there was a 72% reduction in the tota[ acid output only in gerbils on the high salt diet for 16 weeks as compared to normal diet controls (4.566 vs 16.654 IzEq/3h/100g, respectively). Furthermore, in contrast to the effectS of acute salt intake, there was a reduction in the volume of gastric juice when compared to the controIs (0.509 vs 0.775 ml/3h/lOOg respectively). Conclusion: This is the first report demonstrating a reduction in gastric acid secretion with both acute and chronic high salt intake in gerbils. The data confirm the assumptions that a high salt intake may compromise the secretory functions of the oxyntic mucosa. In addition, this may explain in part the synergistic association between H. pylori infection and a high salt diet in the development of gastric cancer.",

            "text": "Objective To explore CYP2C19 polymorphism and its relation to the metabolism and acidsuppression efficacy of rabeprazole and omeprazole. Methods This was a randomized, open, crossover and comparative study. There were thirty-six healthy subjects whose CYP2C19 genotype status was previously determined by allele-specific polymerase chain reaction amplification as twenty-four of extensive metabolisers (homo and hetero EMs) and twelve poor metabolisers (PMs). After a single oral dose of 20 mg rabeprazole or 20rag omeprazole by a cross manner, blood samples were collected at various time-points until 12 hour after administration. Intragastric pH was recorded from pre-adminstration and up to 24 hours. Results There was no difference between the two groups in C~. AUC and T~ while the mean TI,~ of thioetber-rabeprazole in PMs (3.04-+ 0.83h) was significantly longer (p<0.05) than that in EMs (1.92 + 0.44h). For omeprazole, except for T~ of omeprazole and 5-OHomeprazole, there were significant differences in other prarmacokinetic parameters between the PMs and EMs (all p<<0.001). The total time and percent time of intragastric pH>4 of PMs was significantly longer and higher than that of EMs in OME group (P<0.05) in the light of 24h acid-suppression efficacy. The median pH of PMs was significantly higher than that of EMs in OME group (P<0.05) in the light of night acid-suppression efficacy. Conclusion Rabeprazole is predominantly transformed to thioether metabolite in a nonenzymatical manner, and the pharmacokinetics of rabeprazole is less dependent on CYP2C19 polymorphism. The metabolism of omeprazoIe is highly dependent of CYP2C19 genetic polymorphism. So there may be less influence on CYP2C19 genetic polymorphism from rabeprazole than omeprazole on the acid-inhibitory efficacy.",

            "text": "Premise: Flinders Sensitive Line (FSL) rats are selectively bred for increased cholinergi\u00a2 responses as compared to their counterparts, the Flinders Resistant Line (FRL) rats, and have been successfully used as a model of depression. However, the potential of FSL rats to act as models for other disorders has been largely unexplored. As cholinergic pathways are heavily involved in gastric acid secretion, it is possible that FSL rats will exhibit unique gastric physiology that can be utilized as a model of gastric disorders. Methods: The physiology of acid secretion was characterized in FSL, FRL, and Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats using an isolated, lumen-perfnsed stomach model. Acid secreted in the perfusate was measured with a pH electrode. This model allows testing of acid secretion without involvement of the central nervous system. Responses to carbachol, bethanechol, epibatidine, histamine, pentagastrin and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) were compared. Significance was indicated by a p-value < 0.05. Results: No significant differences in carbacho] or bethanechol potency or maximal effect were found between FRL, FSL, and SD rats, and responses were completely inhibited by atropine (10 .5 M). Epibatidine, a highly selective nicotinic agonist, had no effect in all strains. Histamine was significantly more potent in FRL than FSL and SD Purpose: This post-hoc analysis assessed the ability of escalating doses of esomeprazole and lansoprazole to produce a gastric pH>4 at steady state during waking hours. Methods: Continuous 24-hr intragastric pH was recorded on day 5 following repeated oral doses of either esomeprazole or lansoprazole in an open, single-center, randomized, sixway crossover study. 37 healthy Helicobacter pylori-negative volunteers (20 females) received esomeprazole 20, 40 and 80 rag, and lansoprazole 15, 30 and 60 mg once daily before breakfast for 5 days, with a washout period of -> 13 days between treatments. The percentage of time with intragastric pH>4 during the first 12 and 16 hours following dosing on day 5 was calculated. These endpoints were chosen to reflect the time during which heartbum is more likely to occur. 1 Results: See Table. A greater proportion of esomeprazole-treated patients had an intragastric pH>4 for at least 50, and 75% of the first 12 and the first 16 hours following dosing on day 5 than with equivalent doses of lansoprazole. Conclusion: Standard-dose esomeprazole provided a greater proportion of subjects with an intragastric pH>4 for significantly longer periods during the first 12 or 16 hours after dosing than any of the doses of lansoprazole, including twice the standard dose. This was also true for the whole 24-hour period? Therefore doubling the standard dose of lansoprazole did not provide the same level of acid control as esomeprazole 40 mg once daily during the times when acid production is at its peak and when reflux symptoms commonly affect patients. Purpose: This study evaluated the possible association between abnormal hypopharyngeal and esophageal acid exposure and laryngeal signs or symptoms of suspected reflux laryngitis. Methods: Patients with both signs and symptoms of suspected reflux laryngitis were enrolled in a clinical trial of esomeprazole 40 mg BID vs placebo for 16 weeks. Patient eligibility criteria included symptoms of reflux laryngitis (throat clearing, cough, globus, sore throat, or hoarseness for >3 consecutive months) and signs of reflux laryngitis based on laryngoscopic examination using video stroboscopy. At the end of a run-in period, but prior to randomization to study medication, a 2-catheter, 3-probe (Sandhil] Scientific) 24-hour ambulatory pH test was performed. Probes were placed in the hypopharynx (2 cm proximal to upper esophageal sphincter [UES]), proximal esophagus (8 cm distal to UES), and distal esophagus (5 cm proximal to LES). Using blinded pH tracings, an independent expert at a central laboratory evaluated all hypopharyngeal tracings for pharyngeal-associated reflux (PAR) events. Other pH tests were evaluated for validity. Distal and proximal esophageal acid exposure values were calculated as total % time with pH >4 (excluding meal times). Acid exposure times were compared with published normal values and patients were classified as having normal or abnormal acid exposure. For hypopharyngeal tracings, the presence of ->1 pharyngeal reflux episode was considered abnormal. Results: See Table. Regardless of symptoms, abnormal pH tests were uncommon in these patients. There was no clear association between baseline suspected reflux laryngitis sign or symptom severity and abnormal acid exposure. Abnormal acid exposure did not appear to predict treatment response. Conclusions: The symptoms and signs of suspected LPR, in a population of patients defined by laryngoscopic examination using video stroboscopy, were not associated with abnormal hypopharyngeal or esophageal acid exposure. The utility of pH testing in establishing the diagnosis of reflux laryngitis and response to therapy in this population should be re-evaluated.",

Zhang, Jian-Ying Wang Early mucosal restitution occurs as a consequence of epithelial cell migration to resealing of superficial wounds after injury. An increase in cytosolic Ca 2+ concentration ([Ca2+]9~) is crucial for initiating cellular response and consists of an initial phase that reflects Ca 2\u00f7 release from intracellular stores and a second phase that results from Ca 2+ influx through Ca 2 + permeable ion channels. Capacitative Ca 2 \u00f7 entry (CCE) activated by Ca 2 \u00f7 store depletion represents a major Ca 2+ influx mechanism in nonexcitable cells, but molecular components constituting this process remain elusive. TRPC1 has permeability to Ca 2+ and is highly expressed in differentiated intestinal epithelial ceils. This study was to determine if TRPC] is involved in CCE in intestinal epithelial cells and plays a role in cell migration during restitution. Methods: Studies were conducted in IEC-6 cells, derived from rat small intestinal crypts. Ectopic TRPC1 expression was induced by stable transfection with the expression vector encoding the TRPC1 cDNA under control of PCMV promoter. TRPC1 expression was measured by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. CCE was elicited by passive store depletion using cyclopiazonic acid (CPA). Cell migration was measured in a model that mimics the early cell division-independent stages of epithelial restitution. Results: Five selective clones of stable TRPCl-transfected cells highly expressed TRPC1. Levels of TRPC1 mRNA and protein in these stable transfected cells were increased by -6 and ~10 times than that of parental IEC-6 cells, respectively. Increased TRPC1 expression in stable TRPC1transfected cells was associated with an increase in both resting [Ca2*]m (from 98 + 8 to 143 _+ 12 nM) and CPA-induced CCE (from 650 _+ 35 to 1325 \"4\" 57 nM). Stable TRPC1transfected cells also exhibited increased cell migration after wounding (from 110 + 8 to 185 _+ 19 cella/mm). Inhibition of TRPC1 expression by using the antisense TRPC1-SiRNA nucleotides not only reduced CCE but also inhibited cell migration after wounding. CCE was decreased by -70% in the SiRNA-treated cells, while cell migration was inhibited by -25% after wounding. Consistently, treatment with a specific CCE blocker SKF96365 also inhibited CCE and cell migration. Conclusions: These findings strongly suggest that TRPC1 is a candidate protein for Ca 2+ channel mediating CCE in intestinal epithelial cells and plays a critical role in restitution by regulating [Ca2+]~a influx. Background: Ethanol is a well established barrier breaker in gastric mucosa, but its effects at cellular level remain to be detailed. We have previously shown that intracellular free calcium concentration is increased, gap junctions are closed and cell volume is decreased after exposure to 5% (vol/vol) ethanol in primarily cultured rabbit gastric epithelial cells.",

Gap junctional diffusion was measured in 5-carboxyfluorescein loaded cells by bleaching a small area with laser and measuring the recovery with confocal microscope. Intracelhilar calcium was measured spectrofluorometricafly in fura-2 loaded cells. For cell volume measurements the cell monolayer was loaded with calcein and imaged along Z-a~s with a confocal microscope. The changes in fluorescence intensity were intercepted as a measure of cell volume change. TMB-8 was used to inhibit intracellular calcium release and lanthaninm to block cell membrane calcium selective ion channels, while BABTA served as an mtracelhilar calcium chelating agent. Results: Ethanol (7.5% v/v) exposure increased intracelfular calcium from 66 -+ 6 to 153 + 13 nM (N = 6, p<O.05), decreased cell volume by -23 _+ 5% (N = 7, p<0.05) and induced gap junction closure (fluorescence recovery from 33 + 8% to 7 -+ 4%, N = 7, p<0.05). A serosal potassium channel blocker, quinine, almost completely prevented the ethanol induced cell volume decrease (from -23 _+ 5% to -6 -+ 4%), suggesting that opening of basolateral potassium channels underlies cell shrinkage. BABTA completely (from 35 + 3 to 40 _+ 3 nM, N = 6, p<0.05) and TMB-8 + lanthanium partially (from 62-+ 6 to 102\"4\" 14 nM, N = 7, p<0.05) inhibited the ethanol induced intracelhilar calcium increase. BABTA also abolished the ethanol induced volume decrease (from -23 _+ 5% to 0.4-+4%, N~7, p<O.05), while TMB-8 + fanthanium had a smaller effect on it (from -23_+5% to-10-+3%, N~7, p<0.05). They also abolished the closure of gap junctions induced by ethanol (fluorescence recovery 55 -+ 10% for BABTA and 47 _+ 4% for TMB8 + lanthainum. Conclusions: Luminal ethanol opens hasolateral calcium dependent potassium selective channels with resultant shrinkage of the cells and blocks the intercellular gap junctions. These actions are mediated by intracelhilar calcium signaling.",

Tarnawski Serum response factor (SRF) is a transcription factor that regulates genes involved in cellular response to injury, stress and mitogenic stimuli. Its role in tissue injury or ulcer healing has not been explored. The aims of this study were to examine 1) the effect of esophageal ulceration on SRF expression; 2) whether and how gene therapy with SRF cDNA accelerates esophageal ulcer healing. METHODS: Esophageal ulcers were induced in rats by topical application of acetic acid onto the serosal surface of the lower esophagus. Rats with esophageal ulcers were treated with a single local injection of His-Myc-tagged plasmid expressing either SRE or antisense SRE, or vehicle plasmid as control. Esophageal tissues were obtained at day 1, 3, 6 and 9 after treatment. STUDIES: 1) Ulcer size; 2) quantitative histology; 3) gene expression by RT-PCR, Westem blotting and immunohistochemistry; 4) to elucidate further the cellular targets and the mechanisms, rat gastric epithelial cells (RGM1), smooth muscle cells (A7R5) and microvascular endothelial cells (RGMEC) were transfected with the same plasmids. RESULTS: Esophageal ulceration sigmficanfly activated SRF mRNA expression by > 4 fold (P < 0.01), SRE protein expression by > 3 fold (P < 0.01). Six days after treatment, the rats injected with SRF expression plasmid had reduced ulcer size by 54 % (P < 0.01), accelerated re-epithelialization, improved restoration of muscular components, and increased anglogenesis in granulation tissue by 180 % (P < 0.01). Local expression of antisense SRF in rats resulted in 107 % larger ulcers (P < 0.01) and reduced angmgenesis by 150 % (P < 0.01). SRF-transfected RGM1 cells demonstrated a 8-fold increase in cell migration and 85 % increase in cell proliferation (both P < 0.001). Similar results were obtained in SRFtransfected A7R5 and RGMEC cells. CONCLUSIONS: 1) Esophageal ulceration triggers SRE expression in mucosa bordering necrosis; 2) SRF gene therapy accelerates re-epithelialization, muscle restoration and angiogenesis, 3) knockdown of SRF delays ulcer healing, and 4) SRF promotes migration and proliferation of rat epithelial, endothelial and smooth muscle cells. This study demonstrates for the first time an important role of SRF in esophageal ulcer healing and feasibility of gene therapy.",

Bennett, Atsnshi Toyonaga, Michio Sata Background: The Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) participates in intracelhilar signaling cascades resulting in inflammatory responses. Therefore, inhibition of the JNK pathway may form the basis of a new strategy for treatment of acute gastric injury. However, JNK activation during gastric injury in humans as well as in animal models has not yet been shown, and its functional significance in vivo remains unclear. SP600125 effectively inhibits the synthesis of inflammatory cytokines through the inhibition of phosphorylation of JNK. The aim of the study was to determine whether JNK participates in experimental gastric injury. Methods: Acute gastric injury was induced in Sprague-Dawley rats by intragastric administration of 100% ethanol. Phosphorylated JNK was exammed in the rat stomach nsmg both immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Phosphorylation of the kinase was also examined in the stomach of human acute gastric injury by immunohistochemistry. Rats received twice daily injection of SP600125 (30 mg/kg, subcutaneously), or vehicle 2-hour before the induction of experimental injury. Animals were killed 24 hours later, with serum and stomach harvested to determine the degree of gastric injury and the production of cytokines. Results: Western blot analysis revealed a time-dependent increase in tissue levels of phosphor-ylatedJNK, p38 and ERK during the course of experimental injury. The presence of phospho-JNK was demonstrated in the epithelial cells and mononuclear cells of rat and human diseased stomach. Prophylactic treatment with SP600125 significantly reduced pathological scores in treated animals. SP600125 diminished expression of TNF-alpha levels with downregulation of JNK activities at the site of injury. Conclusions: These data identify JNK signaling is involved in the pathophysiology of experimental gastric injury. Furthermore, the anti-inflammatory potential of this inhibitor in animals in vivo suggests that JNK inhibitors may provide a new therapeutic option in the treatment of acute gastric injury in humans.",

Endogeneous bFGF is acid-labile but the effect of H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors on the enteric nerve regeneration was not dependent on the potency of the acid suppression, suggesting the existence of other mediators. Thus, the present study was undertaken to clarify the significance of the several growth factors other than bFGF to the gastric ulcer healing. Materials and Methods: Wistar strain male mrs, weighing 200 to 250 g, were used in the following experiments. Heat searing ulcer were provoked by the direct application of heat searing apparatus on the serosal surface of the glandular stomach three days, one or two weeks before the experiments, bFGF-CS23 (10 ug/100g b.w.), or lafutidine (30 mg/kg b.w.), famotidine (30 mg/kg b.w.) was given through orogastric mtubation every twelve hours after the formation of ulcers. The localization of bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP-2), -4 (BMP-4), BMP receptor 1A (BMPR1A) and 1B (BMPR1B) and platelet-derived growth factor-BB (PDGF-BB) was observed. The localization of the enteric nerves were detected by monoclonal antibodies against gruwth-associated protein 43 (GAP43), choline acetyltransferase, CGRE and VR1. Results: During the vehicletreated group, the regeration of the GAP43 and CGRP immunoreactive nerves was weak, while the bFGF-CS23 and lafutidine treatment brought about the significant increase of the regenerated CGRP immunoreactive nerves and VR1 receptors. Surrounding these regenerated nerves, marked accumulation of BMP-4 immunoreactive mesenchymal cells were recognized in the granulation tissues and most of them were revealed to be myofibrublast by the PR 2D3 immunoreactivity. BMP receptors were mostyl seen in the mesenchymal cells including fibroblasts, myofibrobfasts and enteric nerves. On the other hand, few BMP-4-immunoreactive mesenchymal cells were shown in the vehicle-treated group. Pretreatment with BMP-4 antibody one week before the fomation of the ulcer decreased the regeneration of the CGRPimmunoreactive nerves. Conclusion: Regeneration of the CGRP immunoreactive nerves was dependent on the existence of the BMP-4 mostly recognized in the myofibroblasts in the granulation tissues.",

            "text": "Feng]un Wang, Yingmin Wang, Jerrold R. Turner Inflammatory bowel disease is characterized by immune cell activation and compromised epithelial barrier function. One potential regulator of barrier function is MLCK, which increases myosin light chain (MLC) phosphoryfation and decreases epithelial barrier function. We have recently shown that treatment of epithelial monolayers with IFN~/FfNFc\u00a2 increases MLC phosphorylation and paracelfular permeability and that MLCK inhibition can reverse both events. The aim of this study was to determine the mechanisms by which IFN~ and TNFa regulate MLC phosphorylation and disrupt intestinal epithelial barrier function. METHODS: Caco-2 cells were treated with basolateral IFN~ (10 ng/ml) for 24 hrs followed by 1FN3* removal and basolateral TNFa (2.5 ng/ml) addition. Barrier function was measured as transepithelial resistance (TER). MLCK expression and MLC phosphorylation were determined by immunoblot. RESULTS: Following TNFa addition, TER of monolayers primed with IFN'y began to fall 3 hrs after TNFa addition and pfateaued with a 52 _+ 11% drop at 24 hrs. TNFa did not affect TER in the absence of IFN~ pretreatment. These TER decreases were associated with increased MLC phosphorylation and a 115 -+ 2% increase in MLCK protein expression at 24 hrs. To determine whether changes in TER and MLCK expression were mediated by NFKB activation, monolayers were treated with sulfasalazine (SSA), an inhibitor of IKK and COX. 0.5 mM SSA completely prevented TER loss, MLCK upregulation, and MLC phosphorylation after TNFa. However, 0.5 mM SSA did not prevent NF/CB nuclear translocation induced by TNFu treatment (10 min). In contrast, 2 mM SSA blocked NFKB nuclear translocation but increased TNFcx-induced TER loss 2.1 -+ 0.1-fold. Similarly, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and SN50, a peptide that blocks NFKB translocation, exacerbated TNFa-induced TER loss by 2.2 -+ 0.1-and 1.8 _+ 0.1-fold, respectively. The effects of sulfasalazine were not due to COX inhibition or other general salicylate-dependent effects, as related compounds (5-aminosalicylate, sulfapyridine, acetylsalicylate) did not prevent TER decreases. CONCLUSIONS: IFN~/and TNFcx act synergistically to decrease intestinal epithelial barrier function by upregulating MLCK expression and inducing MLC phosphorylation. SSA prevents this barrier dysfunction by blocking increases in MLCK expression. This protective effect is independent of TNFcx-mediated NFKB and COX activation. Superficial gastric mucosal injuries are primarily healed by rapid gastric restitution, whereby the exfoliated surface epithelium is replaced by a flattened neo-epithelinm formed by migrating survived epithelial cells around the lesion. CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) is a novel adapter/scaffolding protein, which regulates dynamic actin assembly m migrating kidney cells (AJP 283:F734,2002) . This study explores the actions of CD2AP in a migratory cell culture model simulating gastric restitution. Methods: The localization of CD2AP, E-cadherin and F-actin was analysed immunocytochemically with confoeal microscopy in cultured rat gastric mucosal (RGM) cells. For migration analysis the RGM cells were sparsely grown on a coverslip with a microgrid. Separate groups of cells were injected either with rabbit affinity purified concentrated CD2AP antibody or with Rabbit IgG. The migration of cells over the microgrid was followed wnth a microscope and average migration speed was calculated. In a different series the RGM cells were grown sparsely on cell culture dishes and migration was stimulated with 10 ng/ml HGF for 3 hours. The membrane and cytosol fractioning was performed by ultracemrifngation and analysed with western blotting to detect CD2AP in cytosol and membrane fractions. Results: In stationary RGM cells CD2AP was localized perirmclearly and E-cadherin and P-actin staining was normal for epithelial cells. In migrating cells CD2AP appeared as thread-like accumulations in the leading edges and lamellipodia, co-localizing with E-cadherin and F-actin. In stationary cells CD2AP was present only in the cytosol fraction, but in migrant cells it appeared also in the membrane fraction, indicating membrane translocation. The migration speed of uninjected cells was 2.5 _+ 0.6 ~m/h and rabbit IgG injected cells 3.3_+ 0.8/zrn/h. Intracellular injection of anti-CD2AP retarded the migration speed to 0.8_+0.4 gan/h (p<0.05, N~6). Conclusion: CD2AP is in a complex with F-actin and E-cadherin in migrating gastric epithelial cells, possibly acting as a scaffolding protein between the cytoskeleton and membrane proteins. Intracellular blockade of CD2AP with its antibody almost completely stopped cell migration suggesting a crucial role for CD2AP in this process. Background: Infection of Helicobacter priori is associated with induction of gastric mucosal injury. Like prostaglandins (PGs), capsaicm-sensitive afferent neurons play crucial roles in regulation of gastric mucosal integrity. In addition to capsaicin, protons and noxious heat stimulate these afferent neurons via activation of the vanilloid type-1 receptor (VR1), resulting in release of the neuropeptide, calcitoinn gene-related peptide (CGRP). Aim: To investigate the role of VR1 in gastric mucosal defense in mice infected with H. pylori. Methods: Mice were inoculated with H. pylon and four months after inoculation, cimetidme (100 mg/kg), the VR1 antagonist, capsazepine (30 mg/kg), or the CGRP antagonist, CGRP8-37 (500 nmol/ kg) was administered for one week. Four hours after flnai administration of these drugs, 0.15 N HC[ in 60% ethanol (HC1/EtOH) was orally administered to induce gastric lesions. PGE2 production and mydoperoxidase (MPO) activity, a marker of neutrophil infiltration, were measured in gastric tissue. Gastric epithelial cell apoptosis was assessed byimmunohistochemical staining for single-stranded DNA. The mRNAs for cyclooxygenases (COXs) were determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Results: MPO activity and the number of apoptotic cells in gastric mucosa were significantly increased in H. pylori-infected mice than in uninfected mice. tf. pylari infection elevated PGE2 production in gastric tissue, and prevented gastric damage induced by HC1/EtOH. This preventive effect of H. pylori infection was abolished by treatment with indomethacin. 16,16-Dimethyl PGE~ reversed the inhibitory effect of indomethacin on prevention of damage by H. priori infection. Although cimetidine affected neither lesion formation nor PGE2 production in H. pylori-uninfected mice, it counteracted the cytopmtective effect of H. priori infection by reducing PGE2 production. Treatment with capsazepine and CGRP8-37 also inhibited PGE2 production and aggravated HCl/EtOH-inducd gastric damage in H. pylori-infected mice. H. pylori infection increased the levels of mRNAs for COX-1 and COX-2 by 1.4-fold and 3.5-fold, respectively. None of the treatments affected the levels of mRNAs for either COX-1 or COX-2. Conclusion: Increased gastric acid back-diffusion due to impairment of mucosal barrier function in H. pylori-infected mice may stimulate PGE2 production via activating VR-1, which may contribute to maintenance of gastric mucosal integrity.",

The present study was designed to examine effect of lafutidine on expression of cytokines and growth factors or growth factor receptors gene expression in rat gastric ulcer. Methods: Lafutidine 30 mg/kg or cimetidine 100 mg/kg were given to rats with acetic acidinduced gastric ulcer for 2 weeks. Expressions of cytokines (IL-1[3, TNF-a, CINC-2a, MCP-1, MIP-lcq MIP-2, RANTES) and growth factors (TGF-~x, HGF, bFGF, VEGF) and receptors (EGF-R, VEGF-R1, VEGF-P,2) mRNA was measured by real-time RT-PCR. Immunohistochemical staining was performed to determine localization of target protein. Results: Expression of cytokines, growth factors and growth factor receptors mRNA in gastric ulcer was significantly increased compared with normal gastric mucosa. Lafutidine significantly accelerated gastric ulcer healing and stimulated VEGF mRNA expression compared with control and cimetidine-treated rats. These effects of lafutidine were completely abolished by chemical ablation of capsaicin-sensitive sensory neurons. Chemical deafferentation induced 45% and 25% reduction of VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2 mRNA expression, respectively, in rats treated with lafutidine. VEGF was localized in mesenchymal cells of ulcer bed and VEGF-R was found in endothelial cells.

Tamawski, Jianynan Chai, Rama Pal Clinical and experimental data indicate that rebamipide (RB), new drug developed in Japan, protects gastric mucosa against alcohol, bile acids, H,0~, ammonia, H. pylori toxins, free radicals and ischemia/reperfusion injury and accelerates healing of gastric, colonic and oral aphtous ulcers. The mechanisms of these actions are not fully explained and the activation of genes regulating gastric cell metabolism, deactivation of toxic metabolites, cell signaling or nitric oxide (NO) generation has not been explored before for RB or any other anti-ulcer drug. Methods: Normal rat gastric epithelial (RGM1) cells were treated with vehicle or RB (5 mg/ml) for 15 min-3 hrs. Studies: 1) Gene expression by Affymet~x rat genome U34A gene array chips containing ~ 7,000 genes and data analysis using GeneSpring program 2) Activation of some genes was confirmed by RTIPCR and Western blotting. 3) We also examined whether RB-induced Cox2 expression in RGM1 cells is mediated via the MAPle./ Erk2 signaling pathway. Results: Genes significantly upregulated by RB include: 1) aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) class 3 (> 26-fold), which oxidizes a large spectrum of endogenous and exogenous aldehydes (e.g. ethanol metabolites) that are toxic at low levels. 2) Serine/ threonine protein kinase TAO1 (by ~ 10-fold), which activates stress MAP kinases. 3) Cox2 (by 14-fold) and inducible NO synthase (iNOS) (by 4.7-fold). 4) Genes involved in Golgi transport (e.g. GS-15/SNARE), GAPDH, membrane Ca + + ATP-ase, and cytoskeletal genes (e.g. at-tropomyosin, myosin heavy chain, c~ actinin/LIM) essential for cell metabolism, transport and maintenance of cell integrity, respectively, were upregulated > 3-15-fold. Mechanistic studies showed that RB activates Erk 2 in RGM1 cells and that RB-induced Cox2 gene activation is critically dependent on Erk2 signaling. Conclusions: 1) Rebamipide activates, in gastric epithelial cells, genes encoding enzymes that metabolize toxic aldehydes (ALDH), enhance blood flow and mucosal protection (NOS), activate MAPK kinases and regulate cell metabolism, transport and cytoskeletal functions. 2) In RGM1 cells, rebamipide activates Cox2 via the MAPK/Erk2 pathway. 3) These findings reveal new molecular targets and provide new insight into the mechanisms of the wide spectrum of mucosal protective and ulcer healing actions of rebamipide as well as indicate new applications for this drug.",

            "text": "Gene Expression Analysis in the Rat Gastric Mucosa After the Ischemia-Reperfusion Using by the Tissue Microdissection and High-Density Oligonucleotide Array and the Effect of PPAR-gamma Ligands Tomohisa Takagi, \"fuji Naito, Hiroshi lchikawa, Naoya Tomatsuri, Kazuhiro Katada, Yutaka Isozaki, Masaaki Kuroda, Hisato Tsuboi, Toshimitsu Okuda, Satoshi Kokura, Norimasa Yoshida, Toshikazu Yoshikawa Background: Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-g (PPAR-g), a member of the nuclear hormone receptor superfamily, has recently been implicated as a regulator of inflammatory responses. We recently reported the protection of ischemia-reperfusion (I-R)-induced gastric mucosal injury by a PPAR-g ligand, piogbtazone. The aim of the present study was to analyze gene expression in rat gastric epithelial cells induced by I-R injury using high-density oligonucleotide array and to investigate the effect of PPAR-g ligands on the expression of these genes. Methods: Gastric mucosal damage was induced in male Wistar rats by clamping the celiac artery for 30 mni followed by reperfnsion. Specific PPAR-g ligands, Pioglitazone (10mg/kg), and 15-deoxy-12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15-deoxy PGJ2, 0.3mg/kg) was given to the rats intraperitoneally lh before the vascular clamping. The expression of PPAR-g was determined by RT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. Total RNA of the gastric epithelial cell was extracted by micro-dissection methods from gastric frozen tissue after I-R treated with/without PPAR-g ligands. The gastric epithelial cDNA formed from these RNA are amplificated by labeling-assay kit. Gene expression anlysis was performed using these cDNA by GeneChip (Affymetrgx), and confirmed by real-time PCR and Northen blotting. Results: The gastric expression of PPAR-g was confirmed by RT-PCR and Western blot, and localized on gastric epithelial cells and inflammatory cells. The expression was enhanced by the pioglitazone trteatment. I-R up-regulated the oxidative stress-related genes (catalase, peroxiredoxin etc.) and cytokine-related genes (C1NC etc.). The expression of these up-regulated genes was reversed by the treatment with these ligands. Conclusion: PPAR-g ligands inhibited the I/R induced gastric mucosal injury by suppression oxidative stress-related genes and cytokine-related genes. In conclusion, activation of PPAR-g may represent a novel approach to the treatment of gastric inflammation induced by I-R Background Mechanisms for development of reflux esophagitis has not been fully clarified. Tight junction that bears paracellular sealing of the esophageal epithelium may have some roles in development of mucosal injuries. Yet, there is few literature that described expression of tight junction proteins in esophagus with and without reflux esophagitis. Materials and Methods Chronic acid reflux esophagitis model was prepared in male Wister rats by the method of Omura et al. (Scand J Gastmenterol 1999) , and Sham operation was implemented to the controls. One and two weeks after the operation, the rats were sacrificed, and the following studies were performed; 1) The fuluoroimmunostaining with anti-Claudin 3 antibody to observe the alteration of distributed pauems of the tight junction using the confocal laser microscopy scanning and image analysis system 2) The western blot analysis to quantitatively investigate the alteration of Claudin 3 protein in rat esophageal mucosa with and without esophagitis. Results Evident macroscopic erosions occured two weeks after the operation while only a few small erosions were noted a week after the surgeries. In the control rat, Claudin 3 localized only on the cellular membranes of esophageal epithelial ceils mainly in the granular layer. In the esophagitis rats in both one and two weeks after the surgeries, the expression of Clausin 3 at 1 cm apart from the erosions localized mainly in the spnions layer, and its expression in individual ceils shifted to the cytoplasm from the cell membrane. The western blot analysis further revealed that the expression of the protein significantly decreased in esophagitis rats (intensity of the bands by densitometer 3676_+ 1478, in independent three experiments) compared to those of control (12260 _+ 2576.1, P<0.001). Conclusion In the esophageal mucosa of the rats with esophagitis, localization of Claudin 3, one of tight junction proteins, shifted from cell membrane to cytoplasm and from granular layer to spinous layer with decrease of its expression even in the normally appeared mucosa. Our results suggest paraceilular sealing of the esophageal epithelium may have some roles in development of esophageal erosions.",

Since the alcoholic beverages such as wine and Japanese sake contain a number of non-alcoholic components, some of them might afford protection against the mucosal irritative action of ethanol. In the present study, we examined the mucosal imtative action of whisky, wine and Japanese sake in the rat stomach both ex vivo and in vitro, in comparison with ethanol. Since both wine and Japanese sake contain glucose as the nonalcoholic component in most abundant, we also investigated the effect of glucose supplementation on the mucnsal irritative action of ethanol. Methods: Under urethane anesthesia, a rat stomach was mounted in an ex vivo chamber, perfused with saline, and transmucosal potential difference (PD) was measured. After basal PD had stabilized, the mucosa was exposed for 30 rain to 2 ml of ethanol, whisky, white wine or Japanese sake. Since wine and sake contain alcohol in the concentration of 15%, both whisky and ethanol were diluted with distilled water to contain the same alcohol concentration. In in-vitro study, RGM-1 cells were cultured with DMEM. After confluence, the cells were treated with the above alcoholic beverages for 5 rain, and the cell viability was determined by crystal violet. Results: Ethanol or whisky applied to the chamber caused a decrease in PD, while wine or Japanese sake did not decrease but slightly increased transmucosal PD. Histologically, apparent damage in the surface epithelial cells was observed after exposure to both whisky and ethanol, yet no damage was induced by wine and Japanese sake. Likewise, both ethanol and whisky markedly reduced the cell viability of RGM-1 cells after 5 rain incubation, while neither wine nor Japanese sake had any effect. In addition, supplementation of glucose significantly prevented a reduction in both PD and cell viability caused by ethanol, and this effect was antagonized by co-treatment with 2-deoxy-D-glucose given 1V infusion (100 mg/kg/h). Conclusion: These results suggest that the mucosaI irritative action of Japanese sake and wine is much less than that of ethanol or whisky and that glucose, one of non-alcoholic components, protects the gastric mucosa against the irritative action of ethanol. Thus, the less-damaging action of Japanese sake and wine may be, at least partly, accounted for by glucose contained in these alcoholic beverages.",

In the present study, we examined the effect of preconditiong stress (mild stress) on stress-induced gastric lesions and investigated the roles of PG/COX isozymes in the protective effect of mild stress. Methods: Male SD rats were used after 18 h fasting. The animals were exposed to mild stress (cold-restraint stress at degrees C for 30 rain), severe stress (cold-restraint stress at 10 degrees C for 6 h) or mild stress followed by severe stress 1 h later, and the gastric mucosa was examined under a dissecting microscope. Indomethacin (5 mg/kg, SC), SC-560 (a selective COX-1 inhibitor: I0 mg/kg, PO), rofeeoxib (a selective COX-2 inhibitor: 10 mg/kg, PO) or quinacrine (an inhibitor of phospholipase A2:100 mg/kg, SC) was given 30 rain before mild or severe stress. During a test period, the body temperature was monitored by a rectal thermometer. COX-2 expression was examined by RT-PCR. Results: Severe but not mild stress caused hemorrhagic lesions in the stomach. This ulcerogenic response was significantly worsened by indomethacin and SC-560 but not rofecoxib. Mild stress significantly suppressed gastric ulcerogenic response induced by severe stress, and this response was attenuated by not only nidomethacin and SC-560 but also rofecoxib. Body temperature was lowered after severe stress, yet mild stress prevented the decrease of body temperature in response to severe stress, the effect being attenuated by indomethacin, SC-560 and rofecoxib. The expression of COX-2 mRNA was up-regulated in the stomach 4 h after severe stress with or without mild stress, while this expression was potently observed in the hypothalamns before and after severe stress with or without mild stress. In addition, quinacrine also totally abolished the protective action of mild stress against gastric lesions and decreased body temperature caused by severe stress. Conclusion: These results suggested that 1) stress-induced gastric lesions are worsened by COX-1 inhibition, 2) mild stress protects against severe stress-induced gastric lesions, mediated by PGs produced centrally and peripherally by both COX-1 and COX-2, the effect being functionally associated with prevention of lowering body temperature, and 3) activation of PLA2 play a role in the protective action of mild stress, probably triggering central PG production by COX-2.",

            "text": "Overexpression of Surv/vin, Cox2, VEGF, EGF and Its Receptor in Regenerating Epithelium of Human Gastric Ulcers: New Insight into the Mechanisms of Healing Andrzej S. Tarnawski, Shiun-Kwei Chiou, Woo Sung Moon, Jayashri Kidao EGF and its receptor (EGF-R) are overexpressed during healing of experimental gastric ulcers. The relevance of these findings to human gastric ulcers is uncertain and the expression and roles of survivin (antiapoptotic and mitosis-facilitating protein), Cox2, VEGF~ EGF and EGF-R and their spatial relationship in normal or ulcerated human gastric mucnsa remain unexplored forming the basis for this study. Methods: Human biopsy specimens from norrad gastric mucosa and from gastric ulcers were obtained during endoscopy in 24 patients. Forty-nine surgical specimens of the gastric ulcers were retrieved from the surgical pathology archives. Studies: f) Expression of Cox2, EGF and EGF-R mRNAs by RT/PCR and in sitt~ hybridization, 2) Expression of survivin, Cox2, EGF-R and VEGF proteins by a) immunohiste~ chemistry and/or b) Western blotting, and 3) quantification of signal intensity using videoimage system. Results: In normal human gastric mucosa, survivin was expressed in the nuclei of surface epithelial and some foveoIar cells, EGF-R was expressed in foveolar cells while there was no expression of Cox2 and VEGF in epithelial cells. The epithelium fining the ulcer margin and regenerating glands demonstrated significant overexpression of EGF and EGFR mRNAs and proteins (210-320% increase; p<0.01) arid a significant overexpression of survivin and Cox2 by >300%; (p<0.01). VEGF was strongly induced in both epithelial and endothelial ceils, exhibiting co-localization with Cox2. Conclusions: 1) Regenerating epithelium of human gastric ulcers represents a new celllineage, which strongly overexpresses survivin, VEGF, Cox2, EGF and EGF-R. 2) Overexpression of survivin prevents apoptosis, promotes cell proliferation and thus gives regenerating cells survival advantage. 3) Since VEGF receptors are predominately localized to endothelial cells, VEGF secreted by regenerat. ing epithelial cells likely activates angiogenesis in the underlying granulation tissue. 4) Colocalization of Cox2 and VEGF in regenerating epithelial cells and endothelial suggests the/r interactions and autocrine regulation. 5) Since Cox2-generated prostaglandins transactivate EGF-R (Nature Ivied 2002), overexpression of both Cox2 and EGF-R in regenerating epithelium activates mitogenic and motogenic pathways essential for re-epithefialization. Alendronate causes serious gastrointestinal adverse effects. We aimed to investigate if montelukast, a leukotriene receptor antagonist, is protective against this damage. Rats were administered 20 mg/kg alendmnate by gavage for 4 days, either alone or following treatment with montelukast (10 mg/kg). On the last day, following drug administration, pyloric ligation was performed and 2h later, rats were killed, and stomach tissues were removed. Gastric acidity, gastric ulcer index values and malondialdehyde (MDA); an end product of lipid peroxidation, ghitathione (GSH); a key antioxidant, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity; an indirect evidence of tissue neutrophil infiltration, as well as the histologic appearance of the stomach tissues were determined. Chronic oral administration of alendronate induced significant gastric damage, increased myeloperoxidase activity and lipid peroxidation, while tissue glutathione levels were decreased. Treatment with montelukast prevented this damage as well as the changes in biochemical parameters. Light microscopy in the alendronate group revealed desquamation of surface epithelium and glandular degeneration, while the epithelium was sfightly damaged in the montelukast-treated alendronate group. Findings of the present study suggest that alendronate induces oxidative gastric damage by a local irritant effect and causes neutrophil infiltration to the tissue, whereas montelukast is protective against this damage by its anti-inflammatory action.",

            "text": "Cyclopamine, a Sonic Hedgehog Signal Inhibitor Promotes Intestinal Metaplastie Changes During Gatric Ulcer Healing in Mice Yasutada Akiba, Manabu Nakashita, Ken-Ichi Katsube, Masahiko Nakamura, Hiroshi Nagata, Soichiro Miura, Jonathan D. Kaunitz, Hiromasa lshii Sonic hedgehog (Shh) is a key molecule for the epithelial development including gastric glands. Disruption of Shh induces intestinal mucosa in the glandular stomach during mouse embryogenesis. Sbh is expressed in adult human and mouse stomach and in clinical gastric metaplasia, not in the intestine. We hypothesize that the Shh signal may be related with the process of gastric gland regeneration. The present study was undertaken to examine the effect of Shh during gastric ulcer healing using a Shh signal inhibitor, cyclopamine (Cyp). 57C./BL6 male mice (20-22 g b.w.) were used for the experimental gastric ulcer, which was induced with 100% acetic acid treatment on the semsal surface of the anterior wall of glandular stomach. Cyp was daily administered (1 mg/kg, s.c.) to normal mice and to half of the acetic acid-treated mice 3 days after the ulcer induction up to 14 days. Gastric mucosal tissue including ulcerative lesion from day 3, 6,10 and 17 was examined by routine histology and immunohistochemistry for the mucin core proteins MUC2, MUC5AC and MUC6, the proliferation marker Ki67 and a Shh receptor, Patched. Results: Cyp treatment alone had no effect on the control gastric mucosa. In Cyp-treated ulcer group, Cyp treatment had no effect on the ulcer area or healing rate, although the healed mucosa on day 10 and 17 became grossly rough and thick compared with the untreated ulcer group. Histology revealed that mixed-type intestinal metaplasia (alcian blue-positive) with pseudo-pyloric glands was frequently and widely formed in the Cyp-treated ulcer group, whereas only pseudo-pyloric gland formation (Schiff-and MUC6-positive) in the untreated ulcer group. MUC2-positve cells were frequently and strongly observed in the base of the healed mucosa neighboring to MUC5AC-positive epithelium in the Cyp-treated ulcer group, whereas they were not observed in the control gastric mucosa and infrequently weakly observed in the healed mucosa in the untreated ulcer group. Ki67-positive cells and Patched-positive cells were also increased in the Cyp-treated ulcer group. Summary: Cyp enhances intestinal metaplastic changes, accompanied with increased cell proliferation during gastric ulcer healing. Conclusions: Shh is essential for the gastric gland regeneration from some stem cells; inhibition of 5hh upregnlates specific intestinal mucin genes. These findings suggest that the modulation of Shh pathways may be involved in the pathogenesis of H. pylori-related intestinal metaplasia. The novel gastric pentadecapeptide (BPC 157) has been recently demonstrated to exhibit the cytoprotecrive, anti-inflammatory and angiogenic activities in various models of gastric injury and in oesophagitis but it remains unknown whether this peptide could affect gastric acid secretion and interact with prostaglandins (PG) system in healing of chronic gastric ulcers. We studied the effect of BPC 157 on gastric acid secretion in rats with chronic gastric fistulas with or without gastric ulcers induced serosal application of acetic acid (ulcer area 28 ram2). In another group of rats the effect of co-treatment of BPC 157 with indomethacin (5 mg/kg-day i.g.) on ulcer healing was determined. Rats with acetic acid ulcers were killed at 3, 8 and 16 days upon ulcer induction and the area of gastric ulcers were measured planimetrically, the gastric blood flow (GBF) at ulcer margin was assessed by H2-gas clearance technique and the gastric mucosal generation of PGE, was determined using RIA. Gastric acid output was reduced by over 40% after ulcer induction and this effect persisted during all time intervals tested. BPC 157 applied in graded concentrations ranging from 1 ~g/kg up to 100 [xg/kg failed to influence significantly gastric acid output in rats with or without gastric ulcer. The area of ulcers in control rats decreased significantly at day 8 and healing of these ulcers was completed at day 16. The GBF in vehicle-control rats showed gradual rise with decreasing ulcer size being significantly higher at the ulcer margin than the ulcer crater and finally reached after 16 days the value not significantly different from that recorded in intact gastric mucosa. In contrast, the ulcers were present till day 16 in all rats treated with indomethacin and this was accompanied by the significant fall in the GBF at ulcer margin. Treatment with BPC 157 (I0 ~g/kg-d i.p.) reduced significantly the ulcer area at day 8 and 16 and raised significantly the GBF at ulcer margin as compared to that in vehicletreated animals. Concurrent treatment with the indomethacin, which suppressed the PGE2 generation by about 85%, reversed, almost completely the acceleration of ulcer healing induced by BPC 157 (10 ~g/kg-d i.p.) and accompanying increase in the GBF at ulcer margin evoked by this peptide. We conclude that BPC 157 accelerates the healing of chronic gastric ulcerations without influencing gastric secretion via mechanism involving an increase in the gastric microcirculation at the ulcer margin and endogenous PG system.",

Transient B1 integrin overexpression may impair the E-cadherin cellcell adhesion ability. Introduction: Argon beam plasma coagulation (ABPC) has been used as an ablative treatment for high-grade dysplasia in Barrett's esophagus (HGD) and experimentally as a potential method for reducing the neoplastic potential of Barrett's esophagus. The neo-squamons mucosa that replaces the ablated tissue may still contain buried glandular epithelium beneath the surface. We believe this buried glandu[ar tissue and the neo-squamous mucosa may have a reduced neoplastic potential. To test our hypothesis we examined the cellular characteristics of the neo-squamous mucosa from both ablated Barrett's esophagus and ablated HGD, and compared this to normal esophageal mucosa and pre-ablation samples of Barrett's and HGD. Methods: Samples were selected from a prospectively collected database utilizing strict inclusion criteria. Following a second pathologist review, we identified archival esophageal mucosal biopsies of 13 patients with a normal histological appearance, 15 patients with Barretts esophagus, 15 with HGD, 12 patients with neo-squamous mncosa (5 from ablated Barrett's and 7 from ablated HGD). All the neo-squamous mucosa had buried glandular tissue in the biopsy sample. Using monoclonal antibodies for immunohistochemical staining two independent blinded observers measured quantitatively, on a scale of 0-3, the expression of COX-2 enzyme (suggestive of increased neoplastic potential), BCL-2 (indicating a pathway for oncogenic resistance to apoptosis) and Ki-67 (representing cellular proliferation). The mean values for the observations were calculated for each group and compared. Results: COX-2, BCL-2 and Ki-67 enzymes were all expressed in abnormal mucosa. Post ablation, all levels were significantly reduced in both Barrett's and HGD. Conclusion: Ablation of the pathological mucosa of Barrett's esophagus or HGD reduces the COX-2, BCL-2 and Ki-67 expression, which are cellular indicators of potential neoplastic behaviour. The neo-sqnamous mucosa that develops is not however, the same as normal esophageal epithelium. This has implications in the follow-up of these patients. A larger study is needed to confirm our findings. Loss of gut barrier function (BF) & oxidative damage are key in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Using monolayers of intestinal (Caco-2) cells, we reported that oxidants depolymerize the F-actin cytoskeleton and disrupt BF. Because the atypical PKC isoform h is abundant in Caco-2 cells, we hypothesized that PKC-X activation is key to oxidant-induced disruption of actin cytoskeletal subunit assembly & architecture and monolayer BF. METHODS We used the first, multiple sets of GI cell clones transfectcd to stably over-express (by induction) PKC-R or to inhibit activity of native PKC-k Clones were exposed to oxidants (e.g, H202) \u00b1 PKC modulators. Wild type (WT) Caco-2 cells were treated in the same manner. We then measured: BF (clearance by fluorometry); Actin cytoskeletal stability (confocal microscopy); PKC-k subcellular distribution (immunoblotting); PKC-X activity (in vitro kinase); molecular dynamics of polymerized (F) & monomeric (G) actin (43 kDa protein of actin filaments, PAGE), n=6/grp, RESULTS ,A,~ In \"W/ cells, oxidant exposure caused: translocation of PKC-R to membrane & cytoskeletal (particulate) fractions, activation of native PKC&, reduction in actin assembly (increased G & decreased F), instability of F-actin architecture, and bamer dysfunction. ~B~ In transfected ceils induction of PKC-~. over-expression (+ 3.2 fold), caused oxidant-like injurious effects, including changes in the molecular dynamics of actin cytoskeleton. Over-expression induced disruption was potentiated/sypergized by oxidants. Expressed PKC-X was mostly found in cytoskeletal / particulate fractions, indicating its activation. ~C. Stable dominant negative inactivation of native PKC-k (-99%) substantially protected against oxidant injury to monolayer actin dynamics and BF. We show for the first time: l) Oxidants induce instability of epithelial actin cytoskeleton, in large part, through the activation of the PKC-X signaling in intestinal monolayers; 2) Hyperactivation of PKC-k isolorm is a required condition for disruption of the molecular dynamics of the F-and G-actin cytoskeletons; 3) We have thus identified a novel biologic mechanism --destabilization of cytoskeletal dynamics and cellular integrity under oxidative, proinflammatory like conditions --among the atypical subfamily of PKC isoforms in cells. PKC-X activation may therefore play a crucial role in gut injury in oxidantinduced disorders such as IBD. Background/Aim: We previously reported that acid-induced HCO; secretion in the duodenum is mediated by activation of EP3/EP4 receptors, yet there is no information about the relationship between EP receptor subtype and acid-induced gastric HCO3 secretion. Since gastric HCO3 secretion has distinctive mechanisms concerning the 2nd messenger when compared to the duodenal secretion, it is possible that different EP receptor subtype is involved in the acid-induced HCO3 secretion. In the present study, we investigated which EP receptor(s) is involved in acid-induced HCO3 secretion in the stomach. Methods: Male SD rats and C57/BL6 mice, including wild-type OWE), EP1 (-/-) and EP3 (-/-), were used after 18 h fasting. Under urethane anesthesia, a chambered stomach or a proximal duodenal loop was perfnsed with saline, and the HCO3 secretion was measured at pH 7.0 using a pH-stat method and by adding 2 mM HC1. Mucosal acidification was performed by exposing the stomach or duodenum to 100 mM or 10 mM HC1, respectively, for 10 min. EP agoinsts were given IV, while EP antagonists were given SC 30 min before administration of EP agonists or mucosal acidification. Results: Mucosal acidification markedly increased gastroduodenal HCO; secretion in both rats and WT mice, in an indomethacin-sensitive manner.",

PGE2 (1 mg/kg) also increased gastroduodenal HCO3 secretion in both rats and WT mice.

We have previously reported that the decreased acid response after mucosal exposure to taurocholate Na (TC) is mediated by endogenous prostaglandins (PGs) produced by COX-1. However, it remains unknown which type(s) of PG receptors is involved in this phenomenon. In the present study, we invesugated the role for PGE receptor EP1 and EP3 subtypes or prostacyclin IP receptor in the decreased acid response in the stomach after exposure to TC, using knockout (-/-) mice lacking these receptors. Methods: Male C57/BL6 mice, including wild-type (WT), EP1 (-/-), EP3 (-/-) and IP (-/-), were used after18 h fasting. Under urethane anesthesia, the stomach was mounted on an ex-vivo chamber, perfused with saline, and the acid secretion (luminal pH) as well as transmucosal potential difference (PD5 were measured before and after exposure to 20 mM TC for 20 rain. Mucosal PGE2 and 6-keto PGFlcL content was measured by EIA. Indomethacin (2 mg/kg), SC-560 (selective COX-1 inhibitor: 5 mg/kg) or rofecoxib (selective COX-2 inhibitor: 5 mg/kg) was given intraduodenally 30 rain before TC. Results: Mucosal exposure to TC in WT mice caused a marked PD reduction of the stomach, and this PD response was similarly observed in the animals lacking either EP1, EP3 or IP receptors. In WT mice, indomethacin itself did not affect both PD and luminal pH (basal acid secretion), but significantly attenuated the decrease in acid secretion (the increase of luminal pH) after exposure to TC. This effect of indomethacin was mimicked by SC-560 but not rofecoxib, yet neither of these drugs had any effect on the PD response. Although the decreased acid response after exposure to TC was similarly observed in the animals lacking EP1 receptors, this response was partially mitigated in EP3 (4-) mice, especially in the later period after exposure, and markedly attenuated in IP (-/-) mice. Mucosal levels of PGE2 and 6-keto PGFla significantly increased in the stomach after exposure to TC, similarly in all groups of mice. Cicaprost (IP agunist: 10 p.g/kg) as well as sulprostone (EP1/EP3 agonist: 1 rag/ kg) given 1V slgnificantly decreased histamine-stimulated acid secretion. Conclusion: These results suggest that the reduced acid response in the stomach after damage is mediated by endogenous PGs derived from COX-1, through mainly prostacyclin/1P receptors and partially PGE2/EP3 receptors. Background: Gastric mucosa infected with Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) are resistant to noxious agents, although this bacterium causes neutrophils infiltration and over-expression of inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) in gastric mucosa. Recent studies have demonstrated that prostagIandin E2 (PGEa) derived from cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), plays an important role in this protective effect of H. pylon infection. PGE2 exerts its biological action by binding PGE receptors (EPs) which are pharmacologically subdivided into four subtypes (EP1-4). Aim: To assess the roles of COX-2 and EPs in gastric mucosal defense in H. pylori-infected mice. Methods: Mice infected with H. pylori for 4 months were used. Gastric lesions were induced by oral administration of 0.15 N HC1 in 60% ethanol (HC1/EtOH) and macroscopically evaluated 30 rain later. Mice were subcutaneously administered with NS-398 ~COX-2 selective inhibitor (10 mg/kg), concomitant with or without an oral administration with 16, 16-dimethyl PGE2 (16, 16-din PGE2) or EP selective agonists (each at a dose of 1 p.g/kg) 4 hours before HC1/EtOH challenge. Some mice with H. pylori infection were intraperitoneally administered with recombinant mouse TNF-a before HC1/ EtOH. Expression of COX-2 and TNF-a mRNA was determined by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. Localization of TNF-c~ and EP4 was examined immunohistochemically. Results: H. pylori infection increased the mRNA for COX-2 by 3.5-fold and significantly prevented gastric damage induced by HCI/EtOH. NS-398 abolished the protective effect of H. pylori infection. 16, 16-din PGE2 and selective agonists of EP1, EP2, and EP4, but not an EP3 agonist reversed the inhibitory effect of NS-398 on prevention of damage by H. pylori infection. The level of mRNA TNF-c~ was markedly elevated by H. pylori infection, which was further increased by administration with NS-398. Exogenous TNF-a aggravated HCl/ EtOH-induced gastric damage. Among EP agoinsts, only the selective EP4 agonist inhibited the increase in TNF-a expression by NS-398. Both TNF-a and EP4 were expressed on inflammatory cells in gastric mucosa. Conclusion: PGE2 derived from COX-2 may play an important role in resistance to HCI/EtOH in H. pylon-infected mice by activating EP1, EP2, and EP4. Among EPs, EP4 exerts anti-inflammatory effects, which contributes to protection of gastric mucosa.",

Jones, Tomohiko Akahoshi, Shnin-Kwei Chiou, Andrzej S. Tamawski, Tetsuya Tanigawa BACKGROUND~AIMS: The anti-apoptosis protein, survivin, promotes cell survival and mitosis. Although survivin is not expressed in most differentiated adult tissues, recent studies have demonstrated that survivin is expressed in normal gastric mucosa. This study was aimed to determine whether survivin plays a role in \"adaptive cytoprotection\" produced in the gastric mucosa by mild irritant ethanol (ETOH) concentrations against the necrotizing effects of subsequent concentrated ETOH exposure. METHODS: Fasted rats received 2 nil of water (controls) or 20% ETOH intragastrically 30 rain. prior to administration of 2 tal water (controls) or 70% ETOH. Gastric tissue was obtained 3 hrs. later. In vitro, rat gastric epithelial (RGM1) cells, treated with survivin antisense siRNA to knockdown survivin protein levels, or control siRNA not affecting expression, were preincubated with serum-free medinta alone (control) or serum-free medium containing 1% ETOH and then incubated in medium containing 5%, 7.5% or 10% ETOH, STUDIES: 1) Extent of macroscopic injury; 2) survivin expression by Western blot and immunohistochemistry; 3) cytotoxicity/cell necrosis in vitro by lactase dehydrogenase (LDH5 release; 4) apoptosis by TUNEL staining. RESULTS: Preadministration of 20% ETOH reduced macroscopic injury, following subsequent exposure to 70% ETOH, by 95% (P<0.O01) vs. controls. Pre-administration of 20% ETOH also resulted in increased survivin expression by 123% (P<0.05). In vitro, preincubation of RGMI cells in medium containing 1% ETOH reduced cell death, in response to subsequent incubation in the presence of 5-10% ETOH, by > 300% (P<0.001 ) vs. controls. Preincubation in medium containing 1% ETOH also increased survivin expression levels by >270% (P<0.001). The resistance to cell death, as a result of 1% ETOH pretreatment, was significantly decreased >65% (P<0.01) by siRNA treatment. CONCLUSIONS: 15 Protection against concentrated ETOH-induced gastric mucosal injury by prior administration of mild irritant ETOH is associated with up-regulated survivin expression levels. 2) In vitro, survivin deficiency significantly suppresses the resistance to ETOH-induced cell death provided by lowdose ETOH pretreatment. 3) Survivin is likely a key mediator of adaptive cytoprotection against ETOH-induced gastric mucosal injury.",

In addition to cytoprotecrive action, GGA also accelerated the healing of peptic ulcer even under Helicobacter pylori infection. On the other hand, prostaglandin E2 has protective effects on gastric mucosa through increases in mucosal blood flow, mucin and bicarbonate ion secretion. AIM: To explore the molecular mechanism of GGA action, we focused on cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) using rat gastric mucosal cells (RGM1 cells). METHODS: RGM1 cells (4 x 105/well) were incubated for 24 hours in D-MEM/F12 medium supplemented with heat-inactivated 10% FCS. After 24-hour starvation, they were incubated for 6 hours with different doses of GGA. COX-2 expression and NFkB phosphorylation were evaluated by Western blotting and PGE2 production was measured by EIA. The activation of NFkB was assessed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Cox-2 reporter assay was performed by transfecting plasmids containing transcription factor (TF) binding sequences for NFkB, NF-IL6 and CRE, or those with a mutation in each sequence. RESULTS: GGA increased COX-2 expression and PGE2 production in a dose-dependent manner (50 uM-4 raM). GGA(2 raM) activated NFkB and IkB, and EMSA clearly showed NFkB translocation into the nucleus. Furthermore, reporter assay demonstrated that GGA treatment significantly enhanced luciferase activities when the plasmid containing all three TF-binding sequences was transfected, and the activities were attenuated with a mutation in NFkB, but not in NF-IL6 or CRE. CONCLUSION: GGA enhances COX-2 expression and PGE2 production through the activation of NFkB. w967 lmmunolocalization of a Na + (HCO3-)n Cotransporter in Esophageal Submucosal Glands Hani N. Nakhoul, Solange M, Abdulnour-Nakhoul, Hendrik DeJong, Nazih k. Nakhoul, Roy C. Orlando Introduction The esophageal submucosal glands (SMGs) in humans secrete a bicarbonate (HCO3-)-rich fluid that contributes to esophageal defense against refluxed gastric acid. In the SMG-bearing pig esophagus, like human esophagus, we recently demonstrated HCO3secretion and showed that it could be blocked by removal of HCO3-or by treatment with DIDS, a non-selective anion transport inhibitor. This indicates that one or more HCO3transporters are likely present in cells of SMG. Since Na +-(HCO3-)n cotransporter (NBC) is a major contributor to HCO3-transport in other epithelial cells, we investigated the presence and location of NBC within SMGs by molecular techniques and immunofluoreS\" cence. Methods: Using SMGs isolated from pig esophagus, total RNA was extracted by RNA resin purification system. Total RNA was used to generate a first strand cDNA by reverse transcription for PCR studies. Immunofluorescence studies were carried out on pig esophagUS frozen in liquid nitrogen, cut and mounted on gelarin-coated slides. Sections were fixed, rehydrated and blocked with serum, then double-labeled with antibodies to rkNBC (rat kidney NBC) and to cc Na,K-ATPase. Sections were incubated with specific fluorescent secondary antibodies and counterstained with a nuclear stain before mounting and photO\" graphing using an epifluorescent microscope. Results: Using gene-specific primers compatible with 3 published NBC clones (rkNBC, human pancreas NBC, and human heart NBC), we identified a 1717bp PCR product homologous to segment 751-2467 of the human pancreas NBC. In addition, using 3' RACE another 1000 bp PCR product that includes the 3' end of the open reading frame was obtained. Immunofluorescence studies showed Na,K-ATPaSe antibody staining on the basolateral membranes of mucin (weak stain) and duct cells (strong stain) and intense staining without polar distribution on the serous (demi-lunes) cells. In contrast to Na,KoATPase, rkNBC antibody stained the luminal membrane of duct cells intensely, with weak staining of the basolateral membranes whereas no staining was evident in mucin cells, rkNBC, like Na,K-ATPase, intensely stained serous cell membranes without polar distribution. Conclusions: NBC is present on both duct and serous cells of the esophageal SMGs. The intensity of staining and co-localization with Na,K-ATPase in serous cells suggest active HCO3-and other ion transport processes in these cells, The location of NBC on the luminal membrane of duct cells may indicate a locus of HCO3-secretion in these glands.

            "text": "Inhibition of Glucosylceramide Synthase Attenuates the Formation of Acetic-Acid Induced Gastric Ulcer in Rats Manabu Nakashita, Soichiro Miura, Keita Uehara, Yasutada Akiba, Tetsu Takeuchi, Hidekazu Suzuki, Hiroshi Nagata, Hiromasa Ishii Background: Sphingolipids are involved in diverse cell processes, including cell apoptosis. We previously reported that the injection of phorbol ester resulted in the formation of gastric ulcers in the rat gastric mucosa with a significant increase in ceramide content (J Pharm Exp Ther.305:232, 2003) . However, it remains unknown whether the ceramide directly evoked gastric mucosal damage. In this study we investigated the effect of glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors on an acetic acid-induced gastric ulcer to see if ceramide metabolites are involved in the pathogenesis of the ulcer formation. Methods: Gastric ulcers were produced by injection of 20% acetic acid (AA) into the submucosal layer of the rat glandular stomach according to Okabe and Carl. To examine the role of complex sphingolipids, fumonisin B1, which inhibits ceramide synthase, was injected into the gastric wall together with AA. As glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors, d,1,-threo-l-phenyl-2-hexadecanoylamino-3-morpholino-l-propanol (PPMP) and N-butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ), were also administered with AA. Gastric ulcer formation was evaluated 72 hours later. The time course of ceramide content in the stomach was quantified after extraction of major lipids and resolved by thin-layer chromatography using petroleum ether and diethyl ether (7:3) as the first solvent, and chloroform and methanol (95:5) as the second solvent. The number of apoptotic ceils in the gastric mucosa was determined by immunohistochemistry by using a polyclonal antibody to ss-DNA. Results: AA induced significant lesions in the gastric mucosa at 72 hours after AA injection, accompanied with an increased ceramide content and an increase in apoptotic cell number. Fumonisin B1, which inhibited ceramide formation, attenuated the AA-induced gastric ulcer with a decreased number of apoptosis, suggesting the importance of de novo ceramide synthesis. On the other hand the administration of PPMP and NB-DNJ, those inhibit the metabolism of ceramide into glycosylceramide, also significantly attenuated the AA-induced gastric mucosal apoptosis and the mucosal damage in spite of the increased ceramide content in the mucosa. Our results suggested that not C18 and C24 ceramide itself, but their metabolites may be ulcerogenic. Conclusions: In conclusion, a ceramide pathway, especially ceramide metabolites, significantly contributes to AA-induced gastric damage, possibly via increased apoptosis. (Background/Aims) Cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-I) is the constitutively expressed isoform of COX, responsible for gastric housekeeping functions, while COX-2 has been shown to be induced in various gastric diseases, and involved in either mucosal &fence mechanisms or repair processes. In the present study, we examined the possibility that both COX-1 and COX-2 are important for gastric mucosal protection against ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injuries characteristic of increased free radical production derived from activated neutrophils. (Methods) Ischemia was induced in mice by clamping the celiac artery for 30min, followed by removal of the clamp for 90min. SC-560 (40mg/kg p.o.), a selective COX-1 inhibitor, or NS-398 (10mg/kg i.p.), a selective COX-2 inhibitor, or rebamipide (100mg/kg i.p.), a mucoprotective agent which could induce COX-2 in gastric mucosa, was administered to mice 60min before ischemia. Gastric damage was evaluated histologically and by using myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. COX protein expression was evaluated by western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in the gastric mucosa was evaluated by ELISA and immunohistochemistry. The effects of these drugs on thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) as a parameter of free radical production in gastric tissue and on gastric blood flow were also evaluated. (Results) COX-2 expression was induced in the mucosa 90min after reperfnsion, while COX-1 expression was not altered. The localization of COX-l, COX-2 and 1CAM-1 in IR injuried mucosa was mainly observed in endothelial cells. SC-560 pretreatment reduced gastric blood flow at the reperfusion point, TBARS levels, and ICAM-1 expression. Furthermore SC-560 significantly decreased gastric mucosal injury and MPO activity in IR mice. In contrast, NS-398 pretreatmerit increased TBARS levels and MPO activity in IR mice, albeit insignificantly. Furthermore, inhibition of COX-2 significantly increased ICAM-I expression in gastric tissue and aggra-Vated gastric damage in IR mice. Rebamipide pretreatment reduced both COX-2 expression and IR injury, suggesting that rebamipide reduced gastric IR injury via mechanisms independent of COX-2 expression in mice. (Conclusions) In IR mice, COX-1 is involved in upregulating reperfusion flow, thereby aggravating gastric mucosa through increases in free radical production, while COX-2 protects gastric mucosa through down-regulating ICAM-1 expression in the gastric mucosa. Background/Aim: It is known that the acid inhibitory mechanism in the damaged stomach involves endogenous nitric oxide (NO) and that the acid secretion in such stomachs turns into \"stimulation\" in the presence of NO synthase inhibitors such as NG-nitro-L-argiinne methyl ester (L-NAME), the process being mediated by histamine released in the mucosa, partly depending on capsaicin-sensitive sensory neurons. However, the role of vagal nerves in the acid response in the damaged stomach remains unexplored. In the present study, we investigated the role of vagal and sensory nerves in the acid response in the stomach after damage in the absence or presence of L-NAME. Methods: Under urethane anesthesia, a rat stomach was mounted in an ex-vivo chamber and perfused with saline. Acid secretion was measured before and after application of 20 mM taurocholate (TC) for 30 rain. Vagotomy was performed at subdiaphragmatic portion, while vagal sensory denervation was done by application of capsaicin at cervical portion. Results: Mucosal exposure to TC caused a decrease in acid secretion with increase of luminal NO. Pretreatment with L-NAME completely attenuated the decrease in acid secretion following TC, with suppression of h~minal NO release, resulting in an enhancement of the secretion over basal values, and the effects of L-NAME were all significantly reversed by co-administration of L-arginine. Bilateral vagotomy reduced basal acid secretion, while vagal sensory denervation had no effect. In vagotomized rat stomachs the acid secretion was further decreased following TC treatment, and remained decreased even in the presence of L-NAME. Likewise, vagal sensory denervation also totally attenuated the increase of acid secretion in response to L-NAME in the damaged stomach following TC treatment. In addition, the exposure of the stomach to TC increased histamine output in the lumen, and this response was significantly prevented by either bilateral vagotomy or vagal sensory denervation. Conclusion: These results suggest that I) damage in the stomach activates the acid stimulatory pathway, in addition to the NO-dependent inhibitory mechanism, 2) the acid stimulation in the damaged stomach is mediated by histamine released in the mucosa, the process being associated with capsaicin-sensitive afferent neurons in the vagus, and 3) L-NAME increases acid secretion through unmasking the acid stimulatory response by suppressing the NO-dependent inhibitory mechanism. w971 Live Animal Ratiometric Intracellular pH Measurement in Rat Duodenal Epithelium Using SNARE-1 Tetsu Takeuchi, Leinng Zhang, Jonathan D. Kaunitz Background: Our laboratory has measured the pH~ of the duodenal epithelium of living rodents in vivo by Fluorescence Ratio Imaging Microscopy (FRIM) using 2', 7'-bis (2carboxyethyl)-5(6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF) as a fluomphore. Since BCECF is a dual excitation-single emission fluorescein derivative, a ratio pair cannot be acquired simultaneously, allowing time for movement of the live animal subject between image acquisitions, preventing precise image registration. Methods: To address this problem, we sought to use a single excitation-dual emission pH-sensitive fluorescent dye (SNARF-1 ) with a Microlmager that splits the fluorescent emission into identical fields with different wavelengths (580nm/ 640rim), enabling simultaneous acquisition of ratio pair images. In this fashion, movement of the animal will not affect image registration, enabling a pixel-to-pixel concordance when analyzing ratio pairs. We found that 5-and 6-chloromethyl SNARF-1 produced the brightest and longest lasting images of the SNARF derivatives after initial loading of the mucosal cells, with fluorescence usable for 60 rain. With the use of an in vitro calibration curve, we were able to measure intracellular pH (pH,) of the duodenal mucosal cells of living rats. Results: An exposure to a physiological acid pulse (pH 2.5, 5 min) prompdy lowered pH,, with a recovery to baseline following the acid challenge. Conclusions: This technique will greatly decrease the effort taken with measuring pH, in vivo and will enable the measurement of pH~ at more frequent time points than with the BCECF-based method. Since, in the duodenal epithelium, luminal pH changes very quickly, with coordinate changes of pH,, this frequent measurement of pH, will be a marked advantage over existing methods. In this respect, SNARF-1 is considered as a useful alternative to BCECF in the measurement of pH~ in vivo. Grapefruit-seed extract (GSE) containing flavonoids, possesses antibacterial and antioxidative properties but whether it exerts gastroprotective activity against mueosal damage remains unknown. In this study we compared the effects of GSE applied intragastricaUy (i.g.) on gastric mucosal lesions induced in rats by topical application of 75% ethanol or 3.5 h of water immersion and restraint stress (WRS) with or without A) inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 activities by indomethacin and rofecoxib, respectively; B) suppression of NO-synthase with L-NNA (20 mg/kg i.p.), and C) inactivation of sensory nerves by capsaicin (125 mg/kg s.c.). GSE was administered 30 rain prior to ethanol or WRS. One hour after ethanol and 3.5 h after the end of WRS, the number and area of gastric lesions were measured by planimetry and the gastric blood flow (GBF) was assessed by H2-gas clearance technique, blood was collected for plasma gastrin levels by RIA and the gastric mucosal biopsies were taken for determination of the mucosal generation of PGE2 and malonylodialdehyde (MDA) content as an index of lipid peroxidation. Ethanol and WRS caused gastric lesions accompanied by the significant fall in the GBF and the significant rise in the mucosal MDA content. Pretreatment with GSE (0.5-20 mg/kg i.g.) dose-dependently attenuated gastric lesions induced by 75% ethanol and WRS; the dose reducing these lesions by 50% (EDs0) was 2.5 and 9.6 mg/kg, respectively, and this protective effect of GSE was similar to that obtained in rats pretreated with exogenous PGE2 (5 wg/kg i.g.). The protective effect of GSE was accompanied by a significant rise in GBF (by 28%), generation of PGE2 (by 33%), plasma gastrin levels (by 2 folds) and by the marked inhibition of gastric MDA contem and these effects were significantly reduced by pretretment with indomethacin or rofecoxib. Pretreatmem with L-NNA or capsaicin denervation, which by themselves aggravated the ethanol and WRS-induced gastric damage, significantly attenuated the gastroprotective and hyperemic effects of GSE. Addition of exogenous CGRP (5 vg/kg s.c.) restored GSE-induced protection and accompanying hyperemia in rats with capsaicin denervation. We conclude that GSE exerts a potent gastroprotective activity against ethanol and WRSinduced gastric lesions and this protection involves endogenous PG, suppression of lipid peroxidation and hyperemia probably mediated by NO and neuropeptides such as CGRP, released from sensory nerves. Aim: The reactive oxygen-nitrogen species NH2C1 accumulates in the inflamed stomach at levels as high as 200raM. We hypothesized that exposure of the gastric gland to NH2CI leads to pathological alterations in intracellular levels of non-Ca 2 + metal ions, potentially Zn 2 +. Methods: Rabbit gastric glands were loaded with the fluorescent dye, Fura-2, which binds intraceUular divalent cations ~M2*~ such as Ca ~+ (Ka 145nM), and Zn ~\u00f7 (I~ 3nM). Glands were loaded with a second fluorescent dye, FluoZin-3, which has a high binding affinity to Zn 2\u00f7 (lid 15nM) and is not affected by [Ca 2+] up to luM Fluorescence was measured at 488nM for fluozin-3 and ratiometrically (340nm/380nm) for fnra-2.",

In the presence of TPEN, responses to NH2C1 were delayed and attenuated (50raM, 12.2% +/-0.9; lO0mM, 7.0% +/-0.1; 200raM, 20.5% +A 1.1), compared to glands exposed to NH2C1 in the absence of TPEN. in addition, glands were perfused with Ca2+-free Ringer's, and then exposed to thapsigargin, which depletes the major intracellular Ca 2+ store (endoplasmic reticulum In our previous experiments using a model of acetic acid induced chronic gastric ulcers we showed, that inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) by Lisinopril and the blockade of angiotensin AT-1 receptors by Losartan accelerates the healing process of experimental gastric ulcers. However the precise mechanism of ACE inhibition in this experimental model has not been investigated yet. To test the hypothesis that angiotensin 1-7, a potent vasodilatatory member of angiotensin family peptides, is responsible for the protective action of ACE inhibition in the healing of experimemal gastric ulcers, we used an angiotensin 1-7 receptor antagonist: A 779 in placebo, Lisinopril and Losartan pre-treated rats Experiments were performed on Wistar rats weighing 200-220g Upon laparotomy gastric ulcers of initial area of 30 ram2 were induced using acetic acid under pentobarbital anesthesia. Seven days after ulcer induction, the gastric ulcer area (UA) and microcirculatory gastric blood flow (GBF) in the ulcer crater and margin using laser-Doppler flowmetry were measured. Gastric ulcer healing was investigated in control (placebo pre-treated), A 779, Lisinopril (10 rag/ kg), Losartan (10 mg&g) Lisinopril + A779 and Losartan + A779 pre-treated animals In control animals 7 days after ulcer induction the UA decreased by 66% and GBF increased in gastric ulcer margin vs. intact mucosa by 34% (p< 0,05). In both Lisinoprd-and Losartan pre-treated animals, a marked acceleration of healing of gastric ulcers was observed. In Lisinopril pre-treated group UA decreased by 79% and GBF increased in the ulcer margin by 53%. Administration of A 779 did not significantly change the healing rate of acetic ulcers. However when A 779 was given to Lisinoplil pre-treated animals, this angiotensin 1-7 receptor antagonist almost completely reversed the action of Lisinopril in acetic acidinduced model of gastric ulcers. In A 779 + Lisinopril pre-treated animals UA was reduced by 64% (NS different vs. control group with gastric ulcers). In this group GBF values increased in the ulcer margin vs. intact mucosa by 31%. Above results indicate that renin angiotensin system is responsible for the delay of the healing process of experimental gastric ulcers in the rats. Inhibition of ACE by increasing the gastric microcirculatory blood flow reverse the negative effect of renin angiotensin system activation upon gastric ulcer healing process, by stimulation of angiotensin 1-7 release. Background: Recent our investigation has demonstrated that pioglitazone, a specific peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-'y (PPAR-~) ligand, markedly inhibits ischemia/reperfusion-induced gastric mucosal injury via blocking neutrophil accumulation to the gastric mucosa in rats. The aim of the present study was to perform gene expression analysis in the rat gastric mucosal cellular response to hypoxia-reoxygenation using high-density oligonucleotide array and to investigate the effect of PPAR-'y ligands on the expression of these genes. Methods: All experiments were performed using a rat cell line (RGM-1) derived from normal gastric mucosa. Cells were subjected to hypoxia in a Plexiglas chamber with 95% nitrogen and 5% carbon dioxide at 37\u00b0c for 120 min. Reoxygenation was initiated by putting in an environment of normoxia (21% oxygen, 5% carbon dioxide and 74% nitrogen) for 8h. Cytokine-indnced neutrophtl chemoattractant-1 (CINC-1), a CXC-chemokine, production in each sample was assayed by ELLS& CINC-1 mRNA expression and protein were examined by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. After treatment of pioglitazone and 15deoxy-A12,14-prostaglandin J2 (15-deoxy PGJ2), CINC-1 mRNA expression and protein were measured. PPAR-\"/expression in RGM-1 cells was determined by RT-PCR, Western blot analysis, and immunohistochemistry. Total RNA was extracted after hypoxia-reoxygenation, and differences in gene expression profiles were investigated using GeneChip of Rat U34 array (Affymetrix). Results: PPAR-receptor was expressed in RGM-1 cells. CINC-1 mRNA and protein were induced during hypoxia followed by reoxygenation. Both pioglitazone and 15-deoxy PGJ2 significantly inhibited these increased expression of CINC-1 mRNA and protein in concentrations of O. 1-I OI~M. Hypoxia-reoxygenation up-regnrated the oxidative stress-related genes (catalase, peroxiredoxin) and cytokine-related genes (CINC, secreted phosphoprotein). The expression of these up-regulated genes was reversed by the treatment with these ligands. Conclusion: Hypoxia-reoxygenation can directly induce CINC-1 production by modifying gene expression. PPAR-~ ligands suppressed CINC-1 gene expression and protein in RGM-1 cells under hypoxia-reoxygenation. These results suggest that PPAR--/ligands are useful in treating ischemic-induced inflammatory process in gastric injury.",

Among three TFF members (TFF1, TFF2, and TFF3), TFF1 and TFF2 are expressed at high levels in gastric epithelial cells. However, the regulatory mechanisms of gastric TFF expression are not fully understood and it is not known whether inflammatory stimuli affect TFF expression. In this study, we examined the effect of TNFalpha on the expression of TFF1 and TFF2 in gastric epithelial cells. (Methods) MKN45, a cell line derived from human gastric cancer, was used as a model of gastric epithelial cells. Endogenous TFF mRNA expression was analyzed by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. For the reporter gene assays, the promoter sequences of TFF1 gene (-956 to + 36) and TFF2 gene (-912 to +24) were inserted into pGL3 luciferase reporter vector (TFF1-Luc, TFF2-Luc). NF-kappaB activity was monitored by using a reporter vector that contained multiple copies of NF-kappaB responsive element upstream of the luciferase gene (NF-kappaB-Luc). Dominant negative IkappaBalpha was overexpressed when the effect of NF-kappaB suppression was tested. Mutant-type TFF2-Luc, which lacks a most probable NF-kappaB responsive element within the TFF2 promoter (-428 to -415), was also made. For the reporter gene assays, pSV-beta-galactosidase vector was always co-transfected for standardization.

Fresh fruit and vegetabIes exert multiple biological effects on the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract due to their anti-oxidants content. Whether apple polyphenol extracts (APE) prevent reactive oxygen species-related damage to gastric cells is uukown. AIM: This study was designed I) to assess whether APE counteract oxidative damage to gastric epithelial cells in vitro and 2) to evaluate the mechanism of any such effect. METHODS: We used MKN 28 gastric epithelial cells derived from a human well differentiated gastric adenocarcinoma. APE were obtained from freeze dried apple flesh of Annurca variety following extraction with methanol. Oxidative stress was induced by incubating cells with xanthine oxidase (XO) (50 mU/mL) in the presence of xanthine (X) (1raM). Cell damage was assessed by LDH release and by MTT. Intracellular anti-oxidant activity was determined using the ABTS (azinobis ethylbenzothiazolin sulfonate) method. Malondialdheyde intraceflular concentration, an index of lipid peroxidation, was determined by HPLC with fluorometric detection. RESULTS: 1) X-XO dose-dependently and significantly damaged gastric cells; 2) Preincubation with APE significantly prevented X-XO-induced injury decreasing cell damage by over 50% (p<0.05); 3) Pure catechin or chlorogenic acid (the main polyphenol components of APE) were as effective as APE in preventing oxidative injury to gastric cells; 4) Pre-treatmem with APE increased the intracellular concentration of catechin, chlorogenic acid and epicatechin; 5) Pre-treatment with APE caused a 4-fold increase in the intraceflular anti-oxidant activity and significantly prevented its drop induced by X-XO; 6) Pre-treatment with APE counteracted X-XO-induced increase in malondialdhyde formation. CONCLUSIONS: 1) APE significantly protects gastric epithelial cells in vitro against damage brought about by reactive oxygen species: 2) Catechin and chlorogenic acid seem to greatly contribute to APE-related protective effect; 3) APE increases the intraceflular anti-oxidant activity and prevents lipid peroxidation induced by reactive oxygen species; 4) MKN 28 cells are a suitable in vitro system for screening vegetable compounds with anti-oxidant properties and for elucidating their mechanism of action: 5) We postulate that a diet enriched with apple polyphenols might exert a beneficial effect in gastric pathological conditions related to generation of reactive oxygen species. Background/Aim: Endogenous prostaglandins (PGs) are involved in adaptive gastric protection against acute injury, and cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 is responsible for the production of PGs in this phenomenon. Nitric oxide (NO) also plays a role in the mucosal defensive mechanism. However, the roles both PGs and NO play in the mucosal defense of the inflamed stomach remain to be unclear. In the present study, we examined the effects of various COX and NO synthase (NOS) inhibitors on gastric ulcerogenic responses induced by the repeated administration of iodoacetamide (IA) and investigated the role for PGs and NO in the mncosal defense of the inflamed stomach. Methods: Male SD rats were used. Gastric inflammation was induced by drinking O. 1% IA in tap water for 5 days. Indomethacin (a nonselective COX inhibitor: 5 mg/kg, PO), SC-560 (a selective COX-I inhibitor: 5 rag/ kg, PO), rofecoxib (a selective COX-2 inhibitor: 5 mg/kg, PO), L-NAME (a nonselective NOS inhibitor: 20 mg/kg, SC) or aminognanidine (a selective iNOS inhibitor: 20 mg/kg, SC) was given twice 24 h and 3 h before the termination of IA treatment. Results: Giving IA in drinking water for 5 days produced minimal damage in the stomach, with increase in myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. The damage was significantly worsened by indomethacin and L-NAME with increase in MPO activity. The worsening effect of indomethacin was reproduced by either SC-560 or ro fecoxib, although the effect of SC-560 was less pronounced. Mucosal PGE2 content was markedly increased after IA treatment, with expression of COX-2 mRNA in the stomach, and the increased PGE2 production was significantly suppressed by SC-560 and rofecoxib as well as indomethacin. In addition, the up-regulation of iNOS expression and NO production was also observed in the lA-induced inflamed stomach. Both L-NAME and aminoguanidine significantly reduced the increase in NO production and aggravated gastric lesions induced by IA. On the other hand, gastric acid secretion in pylorons-ligated stomachs was decreased following IA treatment, but the reduced acid response was significantly reverted by all inhibitors tested. Conclusion: These results suggest that not only endogenous PGs derived from both COX-1 and COX-2 but also NO produced by both cNOS and iNOS are involved in the mucosal defense of the inflamed stomach, partly by decreasing acid secretion and nentrophil migration.",

TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand) is a promising anti-cancer agent that induces apoptosis in multiple tumor cell types by engaging the caspase-8-and death receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway. We determined whether TRAIL also triggers the Bcl-2 regulated, mitochondrial apoptotic pathway and if so, whether the small molecule Bd-2 inhibitor, HA14-1, can reverse its anti-apoptotic effect. METHODS. SW480 cells were stably transfected with the PC3-Bcl-2 plasmid (SW480/Bcl-2) or vector alone (SW480/neo). Cells were incubated with recombinant human TRAIL (0-200ng/ml) and apoptosis was analyzed by annexin V-FITC labeling (6hr) +_ a caspase-9 inhibitor (Z-LEHD-FMK). Clonigeinc cell survival was determined after treatment with TRAIL (100ng/ml, 7 day) or diluent. The effect of TRAIL (15hr) upon Bid truncation, caspase-8 and -3 cleavage, and cytochrome c and Smac release were determined by cell fractionation and immunoblotting. In SW480/ Bcl-2 cells, the effect of HA14-1 (201xM) on TRAIL-induced (50ng/mL) apoptotic signaling was determined. RESULTS. Bcl-2 overexpressing SW480 cells were partially protected (3fold reduction) from a dosage-dependent induction of apoptosis by TRAIL. SW480/Bcl-2 cells demonstrated increased clonigenic survival compared to SW480/neo cells after TRAIL treatment (52% vs. 5% remaining clones). Bcl-2 blocked TRAIL-mediated caspase-3 cleavage, but bad no effect upon caspase-8 cleavage nor Bid truncation. The caspase-9 inhibitor reduced TRAIL-induced apoptosis 3-fold in SW480/neo cells. Bd-2 overexpression attenuated Bax translocation to mitochondria and cytosolic release of cytochrome c and Smac. Addition of HA14-1 to SW480/Bcl-2 ceils treated with TRAIL reversed Bcl-2-mediated protection and increased apoptosis 3-fold relative to TRAIL alone. HA14-1 alone did not induce apoptosis. SW480/Bd-2 cells co-treated with TRAIL and HA14-1 showed an increase in Bax translocation and cytoehrome c release relative to TRAIL treatment alone. CONCLUSION. TRAIL engages the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in SW480 ceils that is inhibited by Bcl-2. Bd-2 overexpression suppressed Bax transloeation, release of pro-apoptotic mitochondrial proteins, and effector caspase-3 cleavage. Co-treatment with HA14-I reversed these Bcl-2-related effects.",

M. Watson BACKGROUND: It is established in the normal mouse small intestine epithelium that the crypts, but not villi, undergo apoptnsis following treatment with DNA damaging agents, including Etoposide (VP16). Cancer patients receiving Vepesid (VP16) treatment suffer from bloody diarrhoea indicating that the normal intestinal epithelium is also sensitive to this chemotherapeutic agent. We hypothesise that the differential apoptotic response along the crypt/villus axis of the mouse small intestine may serve as an in-vivo model for the study of normal and resistant intestinal epithelium cells to chemotherapy. The aim of this study is to identify novel p53-dependent genes involved in the VP16 stress response. METHODS: Total mRNAs were extracted from VP16 treated (50raM; 24 hours) human colon adenoma HCTll6 (p53 isogenic pair) cell lines, and used to probe a 5.5k Human Unigene cDNA Chip Arrays (Vanderbilt). The expression data was interpreted using the Cluster Analysis programme. Candidate mRNA expression changes were confirmed by Real Time PCR (qPCR) using the ABI Prism 7700 series (Applied Biosystems). Protein expression was investigated by western blotting (WB) and immunocytofluorescence (ICD. A mouse, in-vivo, study of the identified candidate gene was performed on VP16 treated (10mg/kg BW; 45 hours) small intestine epithelium of p53 wild-type and null BDF-1. The total epithelium was isolated using the modified Weiser chelation buffer with gentle agitation. RESULTS: One of the genes identified by array analysis and confirmed by qPCR, was Baculoviral IAP Repeat 3 (BIRC3), a member of the Inhibitor of Apoptosis (IAP) family. This exhibited a p53-dependent increase in expression (n=4; -8-fold increase; P = 0.007) in VP16 stressed human HCTll6 cells. WB demonstrated protein expression was up-regulated (n=2; P=O.03), and ICF indicated a perinuclear/mitochondrial localisation. In the in-vivo mouse model we found the opposite result; a p53-dependent down-regulation of BIRC3 mRNA by qPCR (n = 4; -4fold decrease; P<0.00001), and protein by WB (n = 2; P = 0.09), following VP16 treatment. CONCLUSION: BIRC3 is a, VP16 responsive, p53-dependent gene in both human in-vitro, and mouse in-vivo models. In the normal in-vivo mouse intestinal epithelium, VP16 treatment reduces B1RC3 expression; consistent with an increased incidence of apoptosis as observed by histological analysis. In contrast, in transformed cells, B1RC3 expression induced by VP16 could contribute toward the apoptotic resistance of HCT116 cells.",

            "text": "Lack of Guanylyl Cyclase C (GC-C) Affects Both Polyp Number and Apoptosis in APCM'V+ Mice Elizabeth Mann, Carmen R. Stroup, Ralph A. Giannella BACKGROUND: GC-C is a transmembrane receptor for bacterial heat-stable enterotoxin (ST) and the mammalian peptides guanylin and uroguanylin that mediates ion secretion via cGMP signaling. In addition, effects on enterocyte apoptosis and/or cell cycle progression have been documented. Previously, we used mice heterozygous for the APC M~\" allele (Min/ + mice) as a model of intestinal cancer. We have shown a 50% reduction in the median number of polyps in Min/+ mice who also carry a knock out of the GC-C gene (Gucy2c). The objective of our study was to probe the mechanism(s) whereby polyp number is reduced. METHODS: We used microarray technology (Affymetrix MOE430) to determine differences in gene expression in the intestine of 8-week-old wild type, Min/+, and Gucy2c 4, Min/+ mice. Northern blot assays were used to validate the microarray results. We examined apoptosis in cytosolic homogenates of intestinal mucosa with an ELISA that detects the presence of nucleosomes (Cell Death Assay, Roche). RESULTS: Analysis of the microarray results using GeneSpring 6 (Silicon Genetics) showed a relatively small number of genes that differed by 1.3 fold or greater (p > 0.05) among the 3 genotypes. In general, genes whose expression level differed between wild type and Min/+ intestines exhibited a level similar to wild type in Gucy2c -/, Min/+ intestine. These include the genes for the transcription factor HNF-4, the receptor tyrosine kinase Mer, and the apoptosis effector proteases, caspase 3 and easpase 7. Finally, by examining levels of cytosoIic nucleosomes as an indicator of apoptotic cell death, we have demonstrated a decrease in apoptosis in Min/+ intestine relative to wild type while the occurrence of apoptosis in Gucy2c ~, Min/+ intestine is similar to wild type. CONCLUSION: The reduced number of adenomas in mice carrying the APC M\" allele on the GC-C null background indicates that GC-C acts as a modifier of tumor formation and/or progression. We have used microarray profiling to demonstrate that the loss of GC-C in Mini + mice leads to modulation of expression of a number of genes that differ between wild type and Min/+, increasing their similarity with the wild type profile. As one possible consequence, although the mechanism is not clear, programmed cell death is affected such that it is increased in Gucy2c -/, Min/+ intestine and may contribute to decreased polyp number. Suppression of effective death signaling can provide a selective growth advantage to transformed tumor cells. Phospholipases A~ (PLA 2) family members release arachidonic acid (AA) for cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) to synthesize prostaglandin (PG) in response to immune stimulation. Whereas PG promotes cell proliferation, AA is one of the major determinants of apoptosis. The coordinated expression of PLA2 and COX-2 maintains an effective balance between the availability of AA and the generation of PG. However, in the present study, using immunohistochemistry, we found that cPLA 2 expression is absent in 70% (20/28) of human colon adenocarcinomas that over-express COX-2 (28/37). Further analysis was carried out in HT-29 colonocytes to evaluate the functional sigmficance of this observation. Using antisense ofigos, we found that reduced cPLA2 levels led to dose-related attenuation of TNF-e~ induced apoptosis. Based on our in vitro analysis, we further evaluated the apoptotic status in the human colon tumors and found significantly lower (U50%) TUNEL staining in the cPLA2-negative tumors. In addition, our study revealed that loss of cPLA2 in the presence of elevated COX-2 occurs in preneoplastic aberrant crypt foci (3/5) obtained by close focus colonoseopy from patients being screened for increased risk for colon cancer.",

This study aims to determine the function and regulation of one of these proteins -Squamous epithelial heat shock protein 53 (SEP53)and its relation to the disease process. Oesophageal biopsies were analysed for the presence of SEP53. In samples from patients with no pathology or symptoms and those with non-erosive reflux disease SEP53 was detected.

When compared with an isogenic control, SEP53 cells showed a higher degree of resistance to bile acids and low pH. Ethanol alone had no effect but when combined with the bile acid, Deoxychofic acid, the effect was amplified. The same cells were treated for 24 hours and then stained with Propidium iodide and analysed by flow cytometry. In the presence of the bile acid there was an increase in cells in the G2 phase of the cell cycle and a reduction of the G0/G1 phase. This increase was less so in the SEP53 overproducing cells. Conclusions I. SEP53 is expressed constitutively in normal squamous oesophageal tissue and NERD, reduced in ERD and absent in many but not all Barrett's cases. 2. SEP53 presence increases the viability of the stable cell line in the presence of a variety of substance the oesophagus is commonly exposed to. 3.

Results: HET-IA, ChTRT, GihTRT and OE33 exhibited an inhibition of proliferation, and induction of p21_ and PAl in response to increasing doses of TGF~. Other oesophageal cells (GohTRT, TE7, SEG-I, BIC-1 and FLO-1) were not growth inhibited, and did riot exhibit induction of p21 in response to TGF]3. Apart from B1C-1, all unresponsive cell lines displayed a TGF~ induced increase in PAl expression. BIC-1 cells did not express Smad4 mRNA or protein, as a result of a base pair substitution in exon 9 of the Smad4 gene. Background: A growth condition of low oxygen is a hallmark in the growth of pancreatic cancer and may induce a specific epigenetic gene expression profile. It is known that angiogenic cytokines are upregulated under this conditioll but little is known of prometastatic genes. Aim: In the present stndy we aimed to clone new hypoxia inducible genes and characterize possible new genes in growth of pancreatic cancer. Methods: Cloning of new hypoma inducible genes was achieved by the RDA (representative differential analysis) method, where the Capan-2 cell line was cultured for 1_4 h in hypoxic conditions. Hypoxic induction of identified genes was confirmed by Northern blot analysis and all clones were sequenced. Expression studies in human pancreatic cancer specimens and cell lines was done by real time quantitative PCR and Western blot. Tissue specimens were analyzed by immunohistoehemistry and in situ hybridization. Tumor cell invasion was studied with matrigel invasion assays and cell viability with MTT assays. The bone marrow has recently been demonstrated to serve as a site of T cell priming and memory generation to blood borne tumor associated antigens in a murine model. Similarly to a majority of breast cancer patients the bone marrow of pancreatic cancer patients harbours high levels of tumor reactive memory T cells. T cell activation and subsequent memory formation is believed to require antigen presentation by activated antigen presenting ceils. Such activation is based on danger signals provided by mfectious agents but not autologous tumors which in contrast are known to elicit effective mechanisms to counteract T cell responses. Therefore, it remains unclear how TAA-specific memory T cells are sustained in tumor patients. Pancreatic cancer has been demonstrated to prevent cytolytic T cell responses by secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines. Nevertheless, we here describe for the first time high frequencies of TAA specific memory T ceils in the bone marrow of all tested pancreatic cancer patients. These cells were capable of IFN-y secretion upon stimulation and exerted cytotoxicity against autologns tumor cells in vitro. In contrast, memory T cells from patients with chronic pancreatitis did not react with antigens derived from autologous, inflammatory pancreatic tissue. Thus, generation of autoantigen reactive memory T cells was restricted to tumor patients. Here, we report for the first time TAA dependend cognate interactions between blood borne CD14 + monocytes and tumor reactive memory T cells from pancreatic cancer patients that lead to monocyte activation characterised by induction of TH 1 polarizing cytokine IL-12. Such activation required MHC I restricted cytolysis of autologous tumor cells by cytolytic memory T cells which was essential for uptake and processing of tumor antigens by monocytes. Subsequent induction of IL-12 was driven by cognate interactions with tumor specific MHC I and, to a lesser extend, MHC II restricted memory T cells. Thus, MHC I restricted cytolytic T cells may play a crucial role in sustaining TH1 responses by allowing tumor antigen uptake and -presentation by monocytes, and by activating them to secrete TH1 polarizing cytokines. Our data suggest that, after initial triggering, MHC I restricted cytolytic T ceils might be capable of sustaining high numbers of functional memory T cells even in the absence of further inflammatory danger signals. Background: Pancreatic cancer is a major oncological challenge due to its aggressive growth and metastasis. The molecular mechanisms underlying its deadly behavior are not well understood.

Purified human ADM was purchased from Sigma. Results: Our microarray data had shown that ADM was expressed 4.2 fold higher in pancreatic cancer compared to normal pancreas and pancreatitis, with elevated expression in 8/10 pancreatic cancer cell lines. RT-PCR confirmed the microarray data and immunohistochemistry revealed expression of ADM specifically in the pancreatic neoplastic epithelium. Evaluation of a pancreatic cancer tissue array demonstrated that 90% (43/48) of pancreatic adenocarcinomas overexpressed ADM compared to control pancreas. ADM was secreted by pancreatic cancer cell lines into the medium (eg. BxPC3 11.6 +/-1.2ng/ml). The level of ADM protein secretion correlated well with the microarmy data. Addition of ADM (10 nM) to Pancl cells stimulated cell proliferation to 219 +/-11% of control (p<0.05) at 48h. ADM (1-1000 nM) had a concentration dependent stimulatory effect on Pancl cell migration and invasion. At a concentration of 1000 nM, ADM increased migration to 1220 +/-299\u00b0,6 of control (p<0.05) and invasion to 975 +/-95% of control (p<0.05).

Buchler, Murray Korc, Helmut Friess Background: 14-3-3sigma belongs to the 14-3-3 family of proteins, which are involved in the modulation of diverse signal transduction pathways. Loss of 14-3-3sigma expression has been observed in a number of human cancers, suggesting that it may have a role as a tumor suppressor gene. Aim: To investigate the expression and the functional role of 14-3-3sigma in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. Methods: Expression of 14-3-3sigma was analyzed using laser capture microdissection, real-time quantitative PCR, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot analysis. The role of 14-3-3sigma in apoptosis and cell cycle regulation was evaluated by Western blotting, immunoprecipitation, and EACS analysis. Results: 14-3-3sigma mRNA levels were 54-fold increased in pancreatic adenocarcinoma in comparison to normal pancreatic samples and localized in pancreatic cancer ceils. In pancreatic cancer ceils, the degree of 14-3-3sigma expression was not decisive for the maintenance of G2/M cell cycle checkpoint or induction of apoptosis. Responses to radiation or apoptosis-inducing agents were neither accompanying by a significant 14-3-3sigrna accumulation nor by a change in association of 14-3-3sigma with cdc2, bad and bax. Conclusion: The marked overexpression of 14-3-3sigma in PDAC together with multiple known alterations of potential 14-3-3sigma interacting partners suggests an important role of aberrant 14-3-3sigma downstream signaling in pancreatic cancer. Background & Aims: We have reported that extracelhilar matrix (ECM) proteins and growth factors are 2 key environmental factors protecting pancreatic cancer cells from death. We hypothesized that the anti-apoptotic effect of both of these factors is mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). In this study, we determined the effect of ECM proteins and growth factors on ROS in pancreatic cancer cells, the sources of ROS production, and the role of ROS in pro-survival effects of ECM and growth factors. Methods: Human pancreatic carcinoma ceils M1A PaCa-2 and PANC-1 were cultured for up to 72 h on fibronectin, faminm or polyHEMA (non-adherent substrate preventing cell attachment), with and without serum or insulin-hke growth factor I (IGE-I). We measured intracellular ROS by FACS analysis of cells labeled with the ROS-sensitive probe DCF, and NAD(P)H oxidase activity in cell homogenates by lucigenin-derived chemiluminescence. Apoptosis was characterized by DNA fragmentation, phosphatidylserine externalization, caspase-3 activation, cytochrome c release, and mitochondrial depolarization. Mitochondrial DNA-depleted Rho0 cells were generated by long term culture of MIA PaCa-2 cells with ethidinm bromide. Results: Both ECM proteins (fibronectin and laminin) and growth factors (FBS and IGF-1) increased intracellular ROS and stimulated NAD(P)H oxidase activity. NAD(P)H oxidase inhibitor diphenylene iodoinum (DPI), but neither the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinnl nor the NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME blocked ROS production. The stimulatory effects of ECM proteins and growth factors on cellular ROS and NAD(P)H oxidase activity in Rho0 cells depleted of mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase were the same as in parental MIA PaCa-2. These data indicate a nonmitochondrial NAD(P)H oxidase as the source of ROS induced by the ECM proteins and growth factors. Inhibiting ROS by pharmacologic agents: DPI, the superoxide scavenger tiron and antioxidant N-acetylcysteine, or by overexpression of MnSOD stimulated apoptosis in MIA PaCa-2 and PANC-1 cells. Apoptosis was associated with mitochondrial dysfunction, effector caspase activation, DNA fragmentation, and phosphatidylserine externalization. Conclnsions: ECM proteins and growth factors stimulate ROS production in pancreatic cancer cells through a non-mitochondrial membrane NAD(P)H oxidase. Inhibition of this enzyme can be a potential therapeutic strategy to induce apoptosis in pancreatic cancer.",

Pancreas and isolated acini of transgenic mice were analysed by standard procedures. RNA and protein levels were detected by real time PCR, immunohistochemistry and western blots. Ras activity was detected by immunopecipitation assays. Kinase activities were detected using specific antibodies. Results: Overexpression of ErbB2 in the exocinre pancreas results in increased Ras activation at least m two of three mouse lines with downstream activation of Ras effectors including ERK1/2. Transgenic mice display no increased proliferation rate of acinar and duct cells, no signs of acinar cell damage and accumulation of extracellular matrLx. G1 type cyclins were not induced in acinar ceils as a result of increased Ras activity. Unexpectedly, cyclm D1 was found downregufated in these cells. Moreover, we observed areas of focal infiltrations interspersed in the exocrine pancreas. NF-kB binding activity is induced in transgenic acinar cells compared to controls contributing to high levels of chemokine and cytokine gene expression. Conclusion: These data suggest that overexpression of ErbB2 in acinar cells leads to increased GTP-bound Ras levels without cell cycle progression due to downregulation of cyclin D1. ErbB2 mediates an inflammatory response via NF-kB activation in acinar cells. These data show that the biological response of tyrosine kinase receptor/P, as signalling depends highly on the cellular context.",

Apoptotic cells are known to activate homologous complement and to be opsonized with iC3b. Since maturation of dendritic cells (DC) can be inhibited by binding of iC3b to the complement receptor 3 (CR3, CDllb/CD18) and because immature DC induce tolerance, we investigated the induction of tolerance after pulsing DC with apoptotic ceils in the presence or absence of native serum. Methods: Apoptosis in pancreatic carcinoma cells was induced either by heat-stress, chemotherapy or anti-Her2 antibody. Monocytederived DC were pulsed with apoptotic cells with or without native serum. DC were analyzed for the maturation state by flow cytometry and the cytotoxic activity was determined. Tolerance was prevented by addition of substances such as anti CDllb or N-acetyl-D-Ghicosamine (NADG) which block iC3b binding to CR3. Results: All of the former strategies for apoptosis induction resulted in iC3b release. Pulsing DC with apoptotic cells in the presence of serum prevents maturation of DC and induces finally tolerance. This tolerance could be prevented almost completely by blocking the interaction of iC3b with the CPO receptor. Conclusion: Chemo-as well as immunotherapeutical approaches induce apoptosis in tumor ceils. Release of iC3b from apoptotic tumor cells prevents fully maturation of DC and immature DC induce antigen-specific silencing or tolerance. Blocking of iC3b-binding could mostly prevent this effect. It seems that more attention should be drawn to the so frequently neglected innate immune system.",

Sraad4 is also an intracellular transmitter of transforming growth factor-[3 (TGF-~) signals and its tumor-suppressor function is presumed to reside in its capacity to mediate TGFq3-induced growth inhibition. However, certain TGF-[3 transcriptional responses are retained in Smad4-deficiem cells. Although such as mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) are activated independent of Smad4, there appear to be other unidentified TGFq3 signaling pathways. Aims 1) To establish pancreatic carcinoma cells whose Smad4 protein expression was stably knock downed. 2) To identify novel target molecules of Smad4-independent TGF-[3 signals using twodimensional gel electrophoresis (2DE) and mass spectrometry. Methods We established pancreatic carcinoma cells whose gmad4 expression was knocked down by stable transfection of plasmids expressing short interfering RNA (siRNA). These cells were treated with 10 ng/ml of TGF-[3 or control buffer 12 hours and the soluble protein was extracted and subjected to 2DE. After statistical analysis of the silver stained spots using PDQuest software, we have identified spots increased more than 1.3 fold or decreased more than 0.7 fold using MALD1-TOF/MS or MALDI-TOF/TOF. Quantitative changes of the identified spots were confirmed by Westem blots if antibodies were available, and changes of mRNA were also examined. :o investigate whether identified molecules were stimulated by MAPK, TGF-[3 stimulation was performed with or without pretreatment of selective ERK inhibitor PD98059. Results Smad4 protein expression and the TGFq3-Smad4 signals were impaired in Smad4 knock down cells. Of the 789 spots investigated, 5 showed more than 1.3 fold increases and 17 showed more than 0.7 fold decreases after TGF-[3 stimulation. We identified 5 proteins that were up-regulated and 7 proteins that were down-regnlated; ten of these were novel targets for TGFq3. These proteins function in cytoskeletal regulation, cell cycle, oxidative stress, and apoptosis. Quantitative changes confirmed by Western blot were almost identical to that shown on the 2D gels, although mRNA was not. Of the proteins identified, 14-3-3 ~, HSP27, and vimentin appear to be regulated via neither Smad4 nor MAPK pathways. Conclusion Introducing siRNA-mediated gene silencing into proteomics revealed a novel TGF-]3 signal pathway that did not involve Smad4.",

            "text": "The gastric epithelium of mice (and humans) is composed of thousands of invaginations known as gastric units (GUs). Gastric epithelial progenitor cells (GEPs) residing in the middle (isthmus) of each GU continuously repopulate the entire epithelium by spawning five distinct cell lineages that differ markedly in lifespan, pattern of migration, and biological function. To elucidate the molecular and genetic underpinnings of gastric epithelial renewal, we have undertaken 1) DNA microarray-based expression profiles of GEPs as well as the acid-secreting parietal cell and the pepsinogen-secreting zymogenic (chiet) cell (ZC); 2) a large-scale EST sequencing project from laser-capture microdissected GEPs as part of the Stem Cell Genome Anatomy Project (SC-GAP, www.scgap.org) consortium. Furthermore, we have developed a new bioinformatic tool that allows comparison of gene expression profiles from disparate functional genomic experiments (microarrays, EST sequencing, etc.) to analyze how molecular aspects of renewal in the stomach compare to those of other tissues. One enticing observation is that GEPs, like hematopoietic stern ceils, express higher levels than their progeny of genes (e.g., mago, Y14) that regulate splicing, transport and localization of mRNAs. Drosophila homologs of such genes are required for establishment of cell polarity and fate determination during oogenesis and neurogenesis. We propose that differentiation in mammalian epithelial cells may also involve processing and localization of transcripts that are not translated until cells differentiate. Accordingly, LCM followed by quantitative RT-PCR, coupled with both light and EM immunohistochemistry, show that, despite their extensive rough ER and elaborate secretory apparatus, mature ZCs express transcripts mediating mRNA localization (e.g., staufenl) at lower levels than their differentiating progenitors. We also find that other transcripts involved in establishing cell polarity are preferentially expressed in progenitors (e.g., protein kinase C ~., 3.5x relative to differentiated cells; Pard3, 2.2x; and the rac homolog TCIO, 9.8x), suggesting that the stomach will serve as a fertile in vivo system to study asymmetric cell division and establishment of cell polarity. Intestinal stem cells, located deep in the crypts of Leiberkuhn, have been demonstrated to be multipotent precursors of the 4 principal lineages within the epithelium. To date, our understanding of the properties of these cells has been greatly hampered by lack of methods to isolate, identify and characterize them. Thus, the aims of the study were; 1) to develop methods for isolation of viable intestinal stem cells: and 2) to assess the putative stem cell fraction for expression of known markers of intestinal and hematopoetic stem cells. We hypothesized that, as in many other adult tissues, intestinal epithelial stem cells may be identified as a side population (SP) by flow cytometry following staining with the DNAbinding dye Hoechst 33342. Methods: To generate single cell suspensions, mouse jejunum was digested with collagenase and subjected to serial sedimentation and filtration. Cell suspensions were stained with Hoechst 33342 and either -FITC or -PE labeled antibodies and subjected to dual wavelength flow cytometry as described in Goodell et al Q. Exp. Med. 183: 1797 -1806 , 1996 . In some experiments the SP fraction was collected for RNA analysis via real-time quantitative RT-PCR. Results: After staining with Hoechst 33342, 57-'/7% of the cells were found to be viable. Dual wavelength flow cytometry showed a distinct SP comprising 0.9-2.3% of the viable cells. When hematopoetic cells were excluded on the basis of CD45 immunoreactivity, the SP was reduced to 0.3-1.7%, a number consistent with the expected number of intestinal epithelial stem cells. The CD45 negative SP showed minimal expression of other surface markers of hematopoetic stem cells, specifically: CD34, Thy 1.2, sca-1 and c-kit. In contrast RT-PCR analysis of RNA from the SP fraction showed the presence of Musashi-1 mRNA, a known marker of intestinal epithelial stem cells. Conclusions: We appear to have successfully isolated viable stem cells from the mouse small intestine. The availability of these cells should contribute significantly to our basic understanding of epithelial biology as well as to new therapies for intestinal damage.

Methods: A rat model of intestinal epithelial regeneration, involving isolation and subcutaneous grafting of postnatal crypt cell aggregates, was used. Grafts were retrieved after 7, 14 or 21 days of regeneration and pooled for each time point. Expression of B-catenin, Tcf-1, Tcf-4 and Bcl-2 were assayed by western blot against B actin control and quantified by densitometry.

Results: B-catenin and Tcf-1 expression increased while Bcl-2 declined with progressive regeneration in grafts. Tcf-4 was highly expressed in positive and developmental controls but was undetected in any regenerating grafts. MNU treatment increased B-catenin, Tcf-1 and Tcf-4 in developmental control tissues but only B-catenin and Tcf-1 were unregulated in grafts. Tcf-4 was undetected.

Pasricha Introduction: Although neural stem cell (NSC) transplantation is a promising tool for the restoration of the enteric nervous system in a variety of motihty disorders, post-transplant survival appears to be a critical limiting factor for successful anatomical and functional repopulation. This may be determined by both immunological as well as non-immune mediated mechanisms including intrinsic programming towards apoptnsis. In this study, we investigated the roles of these mechanisms in the survival of transplanted NSCs. Methods: Mouse CNS-derived NSC (CNS-NSC) were isolated from the subventricular zone (SVZ) o[ embryonic mice trarlsgenically engineered to express GFP. CNS-NSC were transplanted at a density of 50,000 cells/m1 using a consistent site and depth of injection into the pylorus in wild type (WT) mice with and without administration of cyclosporine A (CyA 0.1 rag/ ml) or SCID mice. In a separate experiment, NSC were transplanted in WT with or without the addition of a caspase inhibitor in the injection media (Ac-YVAD-cmk 500 IxM). One week post-transplantation the animals were sacrificed and implanted cells were visualized and counted using a laser scanmng confocal microscope after counterstaining with the nucleic acid stain ToPro -3. Results: CyA treatment did not result in a greater number of grafted cells whereas a dramatic increase in number was seen in SCID mice (> 3-fold compared to controls). The addition of the caspase inhibitor also resulted in greatly enhanced survival (2.5-3 fold increase over controls). Conclusions: Our results indicate that both immune mechanisms and caspase activation can modulate cell survival during neural cell transplantation. Cyclosporine by itself is probably an inadequate immunosuppressive regimen to improve cell survival of NSC in the gut. However, pre-treatment with a caspase inhibitor may be a practical method to enhance the ability of transplanted NSC to survive in their new environment.",

Heninng Ileal bile acid binding protein (IBABP) is a cytosolic protein, expressed primarily in ileal enterocytes, that is believed to be involved in the intestinal absorption of bile acids. Its developmental expression is characteihzed by a dramatic increase in mRNA and protein levels during the third postnatal week of rats. 1BABP is a well-recognized target gene of the bile acid receptor, FXR, and its heterodimer partner, RXRu. In the developing rat ileum, FXR/RXRa DNA-binding activity is detected at the end of the third postnatal week but not earlier during the suckling period. Both FXR and RXR~x proteins have been detected in suckling rat whole ileal homogenates, but their nuclear versus cytosolic localization have not been determined. We hypothesized that changes in the nuclear tmnslocation of either FXR or RXR~x may account for the developmental pattern of FXR/RXRc~ DNA-binding activity. METHODS: Mucnsal scrapings of ileums from untreated rats were collected on posmatal days I2, 22 and 40. Crude nuclear, cytosofic, and whole cell extracts were prepared for use in Western blots. In a separate experiment, day 14 pups were administered the FXR agonist, GW4064, at a dose of 30 mg/kg or received vehicle by oral gavage. Whole ileal tissue was collected 24 hours ].ater for Northern blot analysis of IBABP mRNA. RESULTS: RXRc~ was found to be abundant in the nuclear fraction of ileal mucosa at all ages. In contrast, FXR was barely detectable in nuclei from suckling ileum, but was more abundant in the cytosol fraction. At days 22 and 40, FXR was readily detectable in ileal nuclei although it was still more abundant in the cytosol. Suckling animals receiving GW4064 had IBABP mRNA induced to adult levels, whereas there were minimal amounts detected in vehicle controls. CONCLUSIONS: FXR and RXRt~ have different cellular distributions. In the nuclei of suckling rat ileal mucosa, RXRa is highly expressed whereas there are much reduced levels of FXR. The induction of IBABP mRNA to adult levels in ileums of animals treated with a FXR agonist suggests that the lack of FXR activation and thus IBABP expression in the suckling ileum may be primarily due to insufficient amounts of intraluminal bile acids to act as FXR ligands. The bile acids may act directly to activate FXR/RXRc~ already present in the nucleus or they may drive the nuclear translocation of FXR. This work was supported by NIH grant #KO8 DK02550.",

CDX2/3 is a homeodomain-containing transcription factor from the caudal family. One of his intestinal target is sucrase-isomaltase, an enzyme expressed in the brush border and enterocytes. Little is known of the signal transduction pathways involved in the regulation of CDX2/3 activity. However, we have previously demonstrated that CDX2/3 was a substrate of p38 MAPK, and that CDX2/3 transcriptional activity was modulated by the p38 MAPK. Therefore, we wanted to define the mechanisms of CDX2/3 regulation by the p38 MAPK. Methods: By overlap extension mutagenesis, we constructed deletion mutants as well as specific mutants of putative MAPK phosphorylation sites. DNAbinding capacity was verified by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA). GST pulldown assays were performed to determine the p38 MAPK docking site on CDX2/3. In vitro phosphorylation assays with or without 5B203580 were performed to identify the p38 MAPK phosphorylation site. Transactivation potential on the sucrase-isomahase promoter was assessed by transient transfection in Caco-2/15 human colon carcinoma cells. Results: 1) Mutations in CDX2/3 did not affect the DNA-binding capacity to the SIF1 specific CDX2/ 3 element. 2) The p38 MAPK docking site on CDX2/3 was located between amino acids 49 and 108. 3) Consensus MAPK phosphorylation site at serine 33 and serine 99 were not phosphoryfated by the p38 MAPK. 4) The p38 MAPK phosphorylation site on CDX2/3 was located between amino acids 139 and 180. 5) Mutations of serines $33, $99 and $156 in alanine significantly decreased by 4096 the transactivation potential of CDX2/3 on the sucrase. isomaltase promoter and deletion of amino acids 19 to 26 decreased by 60%. Conclusion: CDX2/3 is indeed a novel substrate of the p38 MAPK. The p38 MAPK may well be an important regulator of CDX2/3 transcriptional activity. Research financed by CIHR, CCFC and NSERC.",

To understand the mechanisms controlling COX-2 expression in colorectal cancer, we examined its regulation occurring on the post-transcriptional level. This aspect of COX-2 gene regulation is primarily mediated through the conserved AU-rich element (ARE) within the COX-2 mRNA 3'-untranslated region (3'UTR). RNA binding studies identified the translational repressor TIA-1 as a regulatory factor capable of binding the COX-2 ARE. The significance of TIA-l-mediated regulation of COX-2 expression was observed in TIA.1 null fibroblasts that produced increased COX-2 protein levels and prostaglandin synthesis over that of wild-type fibroblasts. While treatment with the growth factor TGF-~ promoted enhanced COX-2 mRNA expression in both wild type and T1A-1 null fibroblasts, increased COX.2 protein expression was observed only in the T1A-1 deficient cells. The TIA-1 deficiency did not alter COX-2 gene transcription, steady-state mRNA levels, or rapid COX-2 mRNA turnover. These results implicate a novel role for the ARE-binding protein TIA-1 as a suppressor of TGF-13-induced COX-2 expression on the translational level. Furthermore, colon cancer cells that constitutively transcribe COX-2 mRNA and display defective TIA-1 binding to RNA also have increased translation of COX-2 mRNA and enhanced protein synthesis. These findings implicate that TIA-1 functions as a translational silencer of COX-2 expression and support the hypothesis that dysregulated RNA-binding of TIA-1 promotes COX-2 expression in neoplasm.",

Harp TNF protein expression is regulated by transcription, translation, and mRNA instability. Our interest in TNF gene regulation prompted us to perform a yeast two-hybrid screen using the tristetraprolin (TTP) as bait. TTP is required for proper post-transcriptional regulation o[ TNF, GM-CSF, and IL-3 cytokine mRNAs, causing their rapid deadenylation and destruction by binding to AU-rich elements in their 3'UTRs. It is also expressed in inflammatory regions in Crohn's Disease. The SG-and 40S ribosomal protein S3A was isolated by this screen. While originally described as a TNF-induced protein, with known RNA binding (near the mRNA cap) and complexing with other ribosomal proteins, this protein is not known to functionally interact with the 3'UTR of any mRNA. TNF mRNA translation is inhibited by protein components of the stress granule (SG), which includes TIA-I, initiation factors, and S3A proteins. The interaction was confirmed using nHPLC-uESI MS sequencing of epitopetagged TTP complexes, a process that identified native S3A and other SG proteins important for TNF regulation. We found that S3A can bind to TTP while TTP is bound to the TNF 3'UTR by RNA EMSA. Coupled S3A/TNF 3'UTR regulation was directly addressed using the hiciferase reporter gene fused to the TNF 3'UTR expressed from an endotoxin-inserlsitive promoter. The reporter plasmid was transfected into the RAW264.7 macrophage cell line with and without an S3A expression plasmid. E. coil endotoxin translationally de-repressed the TNF 3'UTR reporter approximately 4-fold over background without S3A; the addition of the S3A plasrnid increased this activity to 18-fold over background. S3A-regulatable RAW264.7 cells are currently being selected to understand how the repertoire o[ cytokines from stimulated macrophages is modulated by S3A over-expression. CONCLUSIONS: The TNF-stimufated protein S3A is a component of the stress granule that binds to the AU-rich regulating TTP protein, and is able to do so while TTP is bound to the TNF AU-rich element. S3A expression increases endotoxin-induced protein expression regulated by the TNF 3'UTR. Whether other macrophage-produced cytokines are enhanced by S3A protein levels is a subject of ongoing investigation. wlo08 Putative Intestine Specific Enhancers Located in the 5' Sequence of the CDXI Gene Regulate CDX1 Expression in the Intestine Wei Xu, Enrm B. Rankin, Debra G. Silberg, EunRan Suh Introduction: Cdxl is a homeobox transcription factor that plays a critical role in intestinal epithelial cell growth and differentiation. The Cdxl gene is expressed with a complex pattern in two stages during mouse development. At the first stage, CdxI is expressed in the primitive ectoderm and the mesoderm, while there is no detectable expression in the endoderm. At the second stage, Cdxl expression is limited to the developing intestine and expression remains strong in the intestinal epithelium throughout life. To date, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate the developmental and spatial patterns of CDX1 expression in normal intestine or what induces its downregulation in colonic adenomas and cancers. In the present study, we focus upon the initiation and maintenance of human CDXI gene transcription in the intestine and analyze cis-acting regulatory elements through comprehensive transgenic mice studies. Methods: To elucidate the mechanisms of CDX1 gene regulation, we employed a series of transgenic mouse studies using the 5' flanking sequences of the human CDX1 gene. DNase l hypersensitivity assays were performed to further localize enhancer elements. Results: Transgenic mice containing nucleotides between-327 and +68 relative to the transcription start site of the CDXI gene (CDXl32z+6SLacZ) demonstrated that transgene expression is dependent upon the site of insertion. Expression of the transgene CDXI~6k+eSLacZ is insertion site dependent and that it does not contain an intestine-specific regulator, demonstrating ectopic expression of the transgene in the brain and gastric smooth muscle. However, the nucleotides -15601 to +68 of the CDX1 gene direct transgene expression specifically to the intestinal epithelium and is able to switch transgene expression from mesoderm and ectoderm during early development to endoderm specific in later development, which is a similar pattern to endogenous Cdxl gene expression. Furthermore, DNase I hypersensitivity assays revealed two active chromatin regions in the CDX1 gene (HS1 and HS2) located at --5.8 kb and -6.8 kb upstream of the CDXI gene respectively, which may function as putative intestine-specific enhancers. In conclusion, the upstream sequences between -15601 and -5667 contain putative intestine specific enhancers that regulate developmental and spatial patterns of CDX1 gene expression.",

Our previous studies have shown that the human NaPi-IIb gene promoter, which contains 181 bp upstream of the gene transcnptional initiation site, is active in Caco2 cells. However, the minimal DNA sequences and the transcriptional factor(s) involved in this activation are not known and their identification was the focus of these studies. Methods: Deletion promoter constructs were made by PCR and restriction enzyme digestion and were subcloned into the pGL3 basic vector, which contains the luciferase reporter gene. These truncated promoter constructs were transfected into Caco2 cells with lipofectamine. Nuclear proteins were extracted from Caco2 ceils by standard methods, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) were performed to characterize nuclear protein-DNA interactions. Results: A series of 5' deletion constructs (-118, -58, -19 bp) was made from -18] bp of the hNaPiqIb gene promoter. All constructs ended with the same 3' base (+ 15). Reporter gene assays showed that deletion promoter constructs -118 and -58 bp were functional in Caco2 cells, while the -19 bp construct was not. EMSAs with DNA oligonucleotides showed that there was nuclear protein(s) binding to DNA oligos that span -50 to -26 bp and -37 to -13 bp regions, and that this binding could be competed by the same unlabeled otigos. Further, EMSAs with oligo covering (-37 to -13 bp) confirmed that bp -25 to -21 (5'-CCAGC-3') was required for nuclear protein binding. The protein bound at this region was identified as NF1 nuclear protein by supershift assay. Mutation on this region not only abolished the DNA-protein interaction, but also abolished -60% of the promoter activity in CaCo-2 cells. Conclusion: The -58 bp upstream region of the human intestinal NaPi-lIb gene is required to activate gene expression, and one transcnptional factor involved in this activation most likely belongs to the NF1 family. Further work will focus on identifying additional transcriptional factor(s) that bind to the -50 bp to -26 bp region of the hNaPi-Iib gene promoter, and on defining the possible protein-protein interactions necessary for full transcriptional activation of the human NaPi-llb gene expression.

Methods: Recent studies have shown that a T/C nucleotide polymorphism at position -13910 upstream the factase gene is associated with aduh-type hypolactasia (lactase non-persistence). -13910C and T variants were analysed for gene-regnlatory activity by generating a series of human LPH promoter/ reporter gene constructs containing a 450 bp fragment with the -13910T/C variants. These constructs were transfected into the intestinal cell line Caco-2 and analyzed for reporter gene expression. Transcription factors (HNF-lee, Cdx-2 and GATA4/5/6) known to be involved in LPH expression were over-expressed in order to analyze their importance for geue-regnlatory activity of the -13910 region. Binding of nuclear factors to the -13910 region were analyzed by electropboretical mobility shift assays (EMSA) and super shift assays using Caco-2 nuclear extracts. Sequences binding intestinal nuclear factors in the region surrounding the -13910 position were identified by DNase 1 footprinting. Results: Transfection experiments revealed that the -13910 region is a strong transcriptional enhancer and that the -13910T variant (lactase persistent) is four times more active than the -13910C variant (lactase non-persistent). It was shown that the transcription factor HNFlot stimulates the enhancer activity. A nuclear factor from Caco-2 extracts binds strongly to the -13910T variant whereas the binding to the -13910C variant is much weaker. Four footprints were identified in the region surrounding the -13910 position. One [ootprint covered the -13910 position, but also footprints over putative Cdx-2, HNF3[3 and HNF4cl sites were detected. EMSA and supershift assays verified that the footptinted regions are able to bind intestinal transcription factors. Conclusion: The binding of a nuclear factor to the -13910 T and C variants which is correlated to a different gene-regulatory activity supports the notion that the T/C polymorphism is causal for adult-type hypolactasia. The region surrounding position -13910 furthermore contains binding sites for intestinal transcription factors. This indicates that several transcription factors bind in the -13910 region and are necessary for the observed enhancer activity.",

Previous studies in transgenic mice indicate that a 2.0kilobase fragment of the factase promoter directs an appropriate maturational decline in reporter expression in the small intestine. We aimed to further characterize regions of the lactase promoter involved in mediating temporal expression of the lactase gene. METHODS: Transgenic mice harboring 1.3-kb and 2.0-kb fragments of the 5' flanking region of the rat ]actase gene cloned upstream of a firefly fuciferase reporter were screened for transgene expression by in vivo photonic detection with an intensified charge-coupled device (ICCD) camera. Transgene expression was quantified by luciferase assay of tissue homogenates and by RT-PCR of total RNA isolated from distinct mid-jejunal segments harvested from pre-and post-weaned transgenic mice. RESULTS: Postweaned offspring of a 2.0-kb factase promoterreporter transgeinc line undergo a 6-fold decline of luciferase reporter gene expression compared to expression levels in preweaned offspring. The maturational decline in expression of the 2.0-kb promoter transgene is comparable to that of the endogenous lactase gene. By contrast, postweaned offspring of the 1.3-kb lactase promoter-reporter transgenic line undergo a >lO-fold induction of luciferase expression compared to levels in preweaned offspring. The induction in expression of the 1.3-kb lactase promoter transgeue is comparable to that of the endogenous sucrase-isomahase and trehalase digestive hydrolase genes. The proximal 100 bp promoter sequences of the lactase and sucrase-isomaltase genes contain similar DNA binding sites for intestine-specific transcription factors. CONCLUSION: 2.0kb and 1.3-kb fragments of the lactase promoter direct similar spatial expression patterns in the small intestine of transgenic mice. However, the temporal pattern of expression mediated by the 1.3-kfi promoter fragment contrasts with that of the 2.0-kb fragment and the endogenous factase promoter. The results suggest that key temporal control elements involved in mediating the postweaning maturational decline in lactase expression reside in the -700 bp region between -1.3 kb to -2.0 kb upstream of the lactase transcription startsite. Deletion of the maturational decline control region of the lactase gene yields a proximal promoter that is induced upon weaning similar to the promoters of other intestine-specific digestive hydrolase genes.",

Rowley HNF-4~x and HNF-la are transcription factors critical for expression of genes involved in hepatic lipid metabolism, including the rat liver fatty acid binding protein gene (Fabpl). We determined that Fabpl contains adjacent binding sites for both factors in the proximal promoter. HNF-4a haploinsufficiency results disorders in hepatic lipid metabolism as well as maturity onset diabetes of the young type 1 (MODY1). Single HNF-4ct amino acid changes also result in MODY1. We found that two such MODY1 HNF-4ot point mutants (Gl15S and R127W) retained near wild-type ability to transactivate an Fabpl transgene in cultured HepG2 cells, opening the question of why these mutants result in disease. HNF-4a and HNF-llx exhibit a marked functional cooperativity in Fabpl tmnsgene activation, similar to cooperativity observed between these two factors in activating other hepatic genes. However, the two HNF-4cl MODY1 mutants had a complete lack of functional cooperation with HNFla. Furthermore, while HNF la bound to HNF-4c~ in solution, the two MODY1 HNF 4a mutants exhibited decreased or absent binding to HNF lcc These results suggest that one mechanism by which MODY1 mutations result in defects in hepatic lipid metabolism is through loss of cooperativity with HNF lcx.",

We previously demonstrated that 14 genes including hepatocyte growth factor activator inhibitor 2/placental bikunin (HAI2/PB) showed particularly high substantial inductions (more than 5-fold changes) after 5-aza-2'deoxycytidine (5Aza-dC) treatment in multiple hepatoma cells using cDNA microarray (Fukai et al. Cancer Res. in press). In this study, we examined methylation status of 5'CpG islands in these genes except HAI2/PB and further estimated the association between aberrant methylation and levels of acetylated histones. Among them, 5 genes, namely E-cadhefin, collagen type 1 alpha-2 (COL1A2), insulin-like growth factor binding protein 2 (1GFBP2), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), and fibronectin 1 (FN1), exhibited methylation of 5'CpG islands in multiple hepatoma cell lines based on bisulfite genomic sequencing. We also analyzed methylation status in primary hepatoma tissues as to several genes showing aberrant methylation of 5'CpG islands in hepatoma cell lines. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (CHIP) assay using anti-acetylated histone H3 or H4 antibody showed that DNA methylation and histone deacetylation cooperate in gene silencing in these genes except FN 1. In further studies of 24 primary hepatoma tissues using methylationspecific PCR (MS-PCR), methylation signals of COLIA2, IGFBP2, CTGF and FN1 were detected in 10, 18, 4 and 9 patients, respectively, although no methylation signals were observed in 3 normal liver tissue samples. Aberrant methylation in these genes generally tended to be observed frequently with the advanced stage of chronic liver damage. In conclusion, we showed linkage between DNA methyfation and histone deacetylation in regulation of gene expression and identified the 4 novel methylated genes in hepatoma cell lines, i.e., COLIA2, IGFBP2, CTGF and FN1, by microarray based strategy. The results of MS-PCR suggested that some of them might be involved in hepatocarcinogenesis. It is also suggested that these genes would be targeted for the DNA methyltransferase inhibitors or suggest that TRPV1]3 might be a naturally occurring dominant negative regulator in sensory combination treatment with HDAC inhibitors, neurons that code for noxious stimuli. WlO15 Class 2 (4, 5) HDACs. RESULTS: Transactivation of the LAP gene was seen with each of the TRs in the presence of F3 (al ~10 fold, ]31 ~16 fold). HDAC alone had no effects on basal LAP gene activity. However, in the presence of T3, the HDACs inhibited LAP gene activation to varying degrees, depending upon the specific HDAC and TR studied. HDAC3 was the most potent inhibitor (>90% inhibition of LAP activity induced by either TRod or TR~I. HDAC2 caused an approximate 40% inhibition of LAP activity induced by either TR. In contrast, the other HDAC family members had minimal effects on LAP gene activation (< 20% inhibition). Furthermore, in the absence of T3, the ligand-independent repression mediated by TRcd or TR]31 was largely blocked by HDAC3 but not by the other HDAC family members. CONCLUSION: Among the various mammalian HDACs, HDAC3 appears to play the major role in the context of thyroid hormone activation of the lAP gene.",

Wood Transient receptor potential vandloid (TRPV1), also known as vanilloid receptor 1, is the founding member of the vainfloid type of the TRP superfamily of nonselective cation channels. Noxious heat, acid and alkaloid irritants and several endogenous ligands activate the TRPV1 channel. Aside from their role in sensory coding of noxious stimuli, sensitization of TRPV1 by inflammatory mediators underlies signaling to the brain of inflammatory pathology in bodily organs. Properties of rat and human TRPV1 cDNA are known; whereas, TRPV1 cDNA from the mouse has not been characterized. Here, we report molecular cloning of two TRPV1 cDNA variants from dorsal root ganglia of C57BL/6 mice. The deduced proteins are designated TRPVla and TRPV1]3 and contain 839 and 829 amino acids, respectively. TRPV1]3 arises from an alternative intron recognition signal within exon 7 of the TRPV1 gene. We used RT-PCR coupled to Southern hybridization to show predominant expression of TRPVla in several tissues and significant expression of TRPVllB in dorsal root ganglia, skin, stomach and tongue. When expressed in HEK-293 cells or Xenopus oocytes, TRPVla formed a calcium permeable channel activated by ligands known to stimulate TRPV1. TRPVI]3 was not functional by itself.

The fold-changes relative to control at 6, 8, 12, and 24 hr were 3, 9, 6, and 20, respectively. We selected 473 genes that are involved in cell cycle regulation for analysis. Of this group, 62 were positively correlated and 45 were negatively correlated to the expression profile of KLF4. Examples of up-regnlated genes include transcription factors E2F1 and E2F2, tumor suppressors p53, PLAG, and PLAGL1, and cell cycle inhibitors p27, p57, CULL and CUL5. Examples of down-regulated genes include those functioning in cell cycle progression such as CCND2, CDC2, CCT2, CCT7, B1RC5, MAD1L1, MCM4, MCMS, and CDC37.

            "text": "Purpose : It was the purpose to identify promoter elements common to genes expressed in small intestinal crypts or villi respectively. Methods : Pure ileal villi and crypt preparations were obtained from eleven weeks old mice by use of a published procedure. RNA was extracted and used for preparation of biotin labelled cRNA followed by hybridization to the Affymetrix mouse 430A GeneChip. The promoters of genes which were in the \"refseq\" database were extracted from the mouse genome sequence and formed a background set of promoters. A subset of promoters controlling genes that that displayed more than four fold difference in expression levels between crypts and villi were also defined. Cis-elements which were over-represented in the crypt or villus subset of promoters compared to the background promoter set were identified by the use of a newly developed algorithm (http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/-rshamir/prima/PRIMA.htm). Results : Comparisons of the crypt / villus expression patterns predicted by our DNA-array analysis conformed very well with the results of in situ hybridizations previously presented in the literature. Analysis of the promoter structures of genes with specific crypt or villus expression respectively revealed an over-representation (P<0.001) of cell cycle related ciselements (NF-Y, E2F, Myc/Max) for crypt-speinfic promoters, whereas the villus-specific promoters had over-representarion of cis-elements for T cell factor (TCF/LEF; P<0.05). Interferon regulatory factor (IRF-1, 7: P<0.01), hepatoeyte nuclear factor 3b and 4a (HNF3b, HNF4a; P<0.01), activator protein 1 lAP-l; P<0.05) and Smad3 (P<0.01). Conclusions : Our results demonstrate a clear relationship between the intestinal cellular function and the promoter structure of active genes. The active promoters in the profilerative crypt compartment, are characterized by the presence of cis-elements known to be controlling cell-cycle regulated genes. For the promoters active in the villus compartment, the overrepresented eis-elements reflect signalling in the wnCoeta-catenin (TCF-4), the MAP kinase lAP-l) and the TGF-beta (Stnad3) signalling patwhays. In addition cellular specialisation (apolipoprotein and hydrolase production) is reflected by over-representation of HNF3b and HNF4a cis-elements. Prior studies have demonstrated that ghicocorticoid hormones elicit functional maturation of the small intestine as evidenced by their ability to elicit dramatic increases in the expression of various digestive hydrolases, such as sucrase-isomaltase and trehalase. However, the mRNAs for these genes display a slow increase following ghicocorticoid administration, first being detectable between 12 and 24 hr. Thus we hypothesize that the functional maturation is a secondary effect resulting from one or more immediate early genes of glucocorticoid action on the developing intestine Methods: To identify the primary response genes, we have performed microarray analysis on pooled RNA from the jejunums of 4 untreated postnatal day 8 (P8) mouse pups and from 4 littermates who received dexamethasone 2 hr ahead. Fluorescent dye-fabeled samples were hybridized in quadruplicate to glass spotted cDNA micmarrays containing 15,000 cDNA clones from the National Institute of Aging ~DNA clone set manufactured in the Baylor Microarray Core Facility. Results: Data analysis, ilsing relatively stringent criteria, identified a total of 66 mRNAs significantly up-regnlated and 36 significantly down-regulated by 2 hr of glucocorticoid treatment. Amongst the upregulated mRNAs the magnitude of the increase detected by.'microarray ranged from 1.4to 16-fold. Selected mRNAs from throughout the range were subsequently analyzed by Northern blotting. Of 14 mRNAs chosen, 8 were detectable by Northern blotting and all 8 were confirmed as being up-regnlated by dexamethasone. In general, there was a strong correlation between the magnitude of the increase observed from the microarray analysis and from Northern blotting. Additional time points showed that although these mRNA increases were detectable after 2 hr, most of them peaked at 6 hr and had returned to baseline by 24 hr. Gene ontology analysis showed a preponderance of genes known to be involved in proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation. Conclusions: Genes in the differentiadon category are likely candidates for mediation of glucocorticoid-induced maturation of intestinal function.

Perhaps most interesting was upregnlation of an enterocytespecific basolateral copper ATPase (Atp7a) at 21d, 6 wk and 12 wks (12 to 4-fold). We hypothesize that in the absence of dietary iron, DMT1 transports copper into cells, which leads to upregnlation of AtpTa. Thus, this comprehensive series of experiments has described novel changes in gene expression in the proximal duodenum of iron-deficient rats and has further identified potentially novel genes involved in intestinal iron absorption.",

Zoghbi Background: Mouse atonal homolog 1 (Math1) is a bHLH transcription factor required for development of the secretory lineages of the intestine. In addition to neuronal defects, Math1 null (-/-) mice lack enteroendocrine, goblet, and Paneth cells. The aims of this study are to identify genes: (1) expressed in intestinal secretory ceils and (2) important for development of the intestinal epithelium. Methods: RNA from embryonic day 16.5 and 18.5 intestine was purified from Math1 4and heterozygous (+A) embryos. Triplicate pools of RNA from 12-18 embryos were used to interrogate Affymetrix GeneChips (MG U74Av2). Genespring and dChip software programs were used to identify genes with >2 fold change between RNA pools, and for statistical analysis. These results were compared to expression profiles previously generated with N1A 15K cDNA arrays. Northern blot and real-rime RT-PCR of individual genes were used to validate differences identified by expression profiling. Results: GeneChip comparisons between -/-and +/-intestines identified 368 genes that showed >2 fold change at E16.5 and 311 genes at E18.5, for a total of 574 genes. Included in these groups are secretory cell specific genes such as Tff3, secretin, and cryptdins. 3033 genes changed by at least 2 fold between E16.5 and E18.5 in either +/-or -/-intestines. Comparison between groups identified 146 genes which appeared to be both developmentally regulated and misexpressed in Mathl -/intestine. A subset of these genes, such as the goblet-specific gene Agr2, was further analyzed by Northern blot and/or real-time RT-PCR.",

The comparison of two embryonic stages identified rnany genetic differences between E16.5 and E18.5 intestine, which will be useful in defining the genetic program of intestinal development. Assessment of the expression status of genes known to be important in intestinal epithelial differentiation showed genes with minimal Changes (e.g., Klf4) and those with marked changes (e.g., Pdxl). This analysis allows a tentative placement of Mathl in the genetic hierarchy of intestinal ontogeny. Gene expression profiling provides an unique opportunity to gain insight into development of different types of gastric cancer Tumor sample heterogeneity is thought to decrease the sensitivity and tumor specificity of microarray analysis Thus microdissection and preamplification of RNA is frequently performed. However, this technique may also induce considerable changes to the expression profile. Objective: We measured the variation in gene expression within the same gastric cancer sample by performing a gene chip analysis with two RNA preparations extracted from the same tumor specimen. Methods: Five gastric cancers originating from either the gastroesophageal junction or the distal stomach were matched for nodular involvement (N 1 -N3) and pathologic grading (G2-G3). All tumors were classified as intestinal and T2 by pathology. Tumor samples were dissected under liquid nitrogen and RNA was prepared from two separate tumor fragments. Each extraction was individually processed and hybridized to an Affymetrix U133A gene chip containing 22253 probe sets (approx. 18000 human gene transcripts). Expression profiles were analyzed using Microarray Suite 5.0 (Mfymetrix) and GeneSpring 6.0 (Silicon Genetics). Results: All gastric cancers showed little variance in expression profiles between different regions of the same tumor sample. In this case gene chips displayed mean pairwise correlation coefficients of 0.94 +-002, compared to values of 0,61 +-0.1 for different tumor samples. Expressing the variance between two expression profiles as a percentage of \"Total change\" (Affymetrix) revealed a remarkably low average value of 1.18 + -0.78 for comparing fragments of the same tumor sample. These results are in agreement with data obtained from microarray experiments using RNA prepared from identical cell cultures. Conclusion: We found a surprisingly low degree of expression profile variability within our gastric tumor samples. These data suggests that tissue heterogeneity is not a dominant source of error for microarray analysis of larger tumor samples, making total RNA extraction an appropriate strategy for performing gene chip expression profiling of gastric cancer. In ongoing studies we will compare the quality of gene expression profiles derived by total RNA extraction to those generated by laser microdissection and preampfification from gastric cancer tissues to investigate the error induced in more detail.",

            "text": "Neurotensni (NT), a gastrointestinal (GI) hormone, binds its receptor (NTR) to regulate proliferation of normal and neoplastic intestinal cells; the molecular mechanisms remain largely undefined. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) have been reported to play critical roles in endothelial cell migration and matrix remodeling during the angiogenic process. Among these MMPs, membrane-type MMP-1 (MT1-MMP) is an important molecule that can trigger the invasion of tumor cells. The purpose of this study was to identify whether MMP-1 expression is regulated by NT using a human colon cancer cefi line, HT29, and, a human pancreatic cancer cell line, MIA PaCa-2, which possess high-affinity NTR. METHODS. HT29 and MIA PaCa-2, cells were incubated in serum-free medium 24h before treatment. Cells were treated with NT for 0.5, 2, 4, 8, and 24 h and total RNA extracted for assessment of MMP-1 expression using RNase protection assay. To determine the signaling pathways involved in the NT mediated effects, cells were pretreated for 30 rain with: (i) the MEK inhibitor PD98059, (ii) the PI3-K inhibitor wortmannin, (iii) the p38 inhibitor SB203580, or (iv) various PKC inhibitors; protein was extracted and analyzed by Western Not for MMP-1 expression. RESULTS. NT promoted a time-dependent induction of MMP-1 mRNA expression without affecting the expression of other MMPs in HT29 and M1A PaCa-2 cells. NT-mediated MMP-1 protein induction was blocked by G06983 (which inhibits conventional and novel PKCs) and SB-203580 and partially inhibited by PD98059 but not by inhibitors of PI3-kinase (wortmannin) or G06976 (which inhibits conventional PKCs) suggesting a predominant role for certain PKC isoform(s) and MAP kinase in MMP-1 induction by NT. CONCLUSIONS. Importantly, our results demonstrate, for the first time, induction of MMP-1 by the gut hormone NT through signaling pathways involving activation of PKC and MAP kinases. Delineating the signal transduction mechanisms regulating the cellular effects of NT will provide important insights into the molecular pathways responsible for NT-mediated effects on both normal and neoplastic cells. There was no association of H.pylori, age, sex, site, Dukes' stage and grade of turnout with elevated plasma progastrin levels. Plasma progastrin as a marker for turnout recurrence had a low sensitivity 42% (95% CI 28.3 to 55.6) and a high specificity 74.8% (95% CI 67.4 to 82.1). The OR of having liver metastases was also elevated in patients with high plasma progastrin (p=0.002). Removal of the primary tumour was associated with a decrease in postoperative plasma progastrin levels. There was no change in plasma pmgastrin levels following resection of liver metastases from colorectal cancer. Conclusions: The risk of having a recurrence is 2.787 times greater with elevated plasma progastrin levels. Plasma progastrin as a marker for tumour recurrence has a low sensitivity and high specificity. The role of plasma progastrin levels in patients undergoing resection of primary or metastatic liver disease needs to be investigated further with an assay of increased sensitivity and in a larger group of patients. In the biopsy samples phosphorylated PKB/Akt was shown to be higher in BE (p<O.O08 for each pair). Conclusion: Exogenous gastrin via the CCK-2R up-regulates PKB/Akt phosphorylation in oesophageal cells. Endogenous gastrin may contribute to basal PKB/Akt phosphorylation and degradation of the downstream target IKBcc Levels of gastr/n and CCK-2R expression increase as BE develops, potentially explaining the increase in activated PKB/ Akt. These findings suggest a role for gastrni in progression to oesophageal adenocarcinoma through PKB/Akt activation, IKBa degradation and subsequent inhibition of apoptosis.",

To date, five receptor subtypes, SSTR1 to SSTR5, are known. The SMS analogues which are in current clinical use exhibit high affinity for SSTR2, moderate affinity for SSTR5, and low affinity for SSTR3. In recent years, these compounds have been introduced into the therapy of advanced inoperable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The efficacy of this treatment is under debate due to the controversial results of clinical trials. Compared to the considerable number of patients treated with SMS analogues, little is known about the expression of SSTR subtypes in HCCs. The aim of Our study therefore was to systematically analyze the incidence of each of the SSTRs in these tumors. Methods: 50 HCCs were investigated by immunohistochemistry using SSTR subtype specific antibodies. Pancreatic islets which have been shown to express all five SSTRs Were used as a positive control. For specificity and negative controls the primary antibody was preabsorbed using the antigen. Results: Express/on of all SSTR subtypes was visualized in pancreatic islets. In contrast, HCCs display high variability in expression patterns as well as expression levels for SSTRs. Nine different expression patterns were identified. The most commonly expressed receptor subtype is SSTR5 (75% of the investigated HCCs), followed by SSTR3 (64%), SSTR1 (48%), and SSTR2 (38%). None of the tumors expresses SSTR4.",

We have also shown that GRP stimulates NB cell growth; however, the exact role of GRP-R in the regulation of NB cell growth is unknown. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine whether up-regulation of GRP-R alone can stimulate NB cell growth and to discern the molecular mechanisms involved m this process. METHODS. Neuroblastoma cell lines, SK-N-SH, SH-SY5Y, and BE(2)C, were used for our experiments. We established GRP-R stable expression neuroblastoma cell lines by transfection with the human GRP-R cDNA inserted in N-termini of GFP in pEGFP expression vector and observed by immunofiuorescent microscopy, Western blot and receptor binding assay. Cells (lxlO4/well) were plated in 96well plate in RPMI with 10% EBS and counted each day for cell growth in the presence of various kinase inhibitors, lmmunoblots were also performed using specific phos-Akt or phos-Rb antibodies. GRP peptide secretion into the media was measured by RIA. RESULTS. NB cells with GRP-R transfection was confirmed by immunofluorescent and Western blot. Nearly 3-fold increase m GRP-R binding capacity was noted in GRP-R overexpressnig cells when compared to GFP vector alone. Cells overexpressing GRP-R, without exogenous GRP treatment, demonstrated significant constitutive increases in ceil growth by days 3 and 4. Treatment with LY294002 (a PI3-K inhibitor) attenuated growth of GRP-R transfected cells; however, this inhibitory effect was not seen with PD98059, an inhibitor of MEK. GRP-R transfected ceils showed constitutively higher expression of p-Akt and p-Rb. GRP secretion into the media was not significantly different between GRP-R transfected and control ceils (0.657 ng/ml vs. 0.650 ng,/ml at 24 hrs). CONCLUSIONS. These data demonstrate that increasing GRP-R binding capacity results in promotion of NB cell growth without altering GRP secretion, suggesting an important role for GRP-R in the regulation of NB cell growth.",

This in vitro model provides a valuable tool for identifying molecular mechanisms involved in GRP-iuduced tumor progression of neuroblastoma and development of potential novel therapy. Background/Aim: Amidated Gastrin Releasing Peptides (GRPs) have been identified as autoctine growth factors in small cell lung cancer but their role in the development and progression of colorectal carcinoma is less clear. In addition, the biological activity of non-amidated GRP has not been investigated. We therefore aimed to determine whether or not bombesin (a mammalian homologne of GRP), and amidated and non-amidated GRP stimulated proliferation or migration in the human colorectal carcinoma cell line DLD-1, and whether or not gastrin-releasing peptide receptor (GRP-R) antagonists inhibited any such effects. Methods: Cell proliferation was measured by MTT colorimettic assay and 3H-thymidine assays, cell migration using a wound-healing model, and expression of the GRP receptor (GRP-R) by RT-PCR. Activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) was measured by western-blot, and production of inositol phosphates was measured using phosphorylation of 3H-myo-inositol. Results: Treatment with either bombesin, or amidated or non-amidated GRP, resulted in significant increases in proliferation and in migration in a wound-healing assay. Both the mitogenic and migratory effects of amidated and non-amidated forms were inhibited by the GRP receptor antagonist, D-Phe6, Leu-NHetl3, des-Met 14-bombesin (6-14) . The presence of GRP receptor mRNA in four colorectal carcinoma cell lines was demonstrated. Transfection of DLD-1 cells with a dominant negative phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase did not affect bombesni-stimulated cell proliferation, but inhibited bombesin-stimulated cell migration. Bombesin and GRPgIy activated phospholipase C, and caused early transient phosphorylation of MAPK and FAK. Conclusion: We conclude that both amidated and non-amidated forms of GRP accelerate proliferation and migration of DLD-I human colorectal cancer ceils via the GRP-R but phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase is only involved in the ceil migration signalling pathway. Our results suggest a potential role for GRP-R antagonists in the management of colorectal cancer.",

Recently, a splice variant of the CCK-2 receptor with an in frame insertion of the unspficed intron 4 (SV-CCK-2R) has been cloned from human colon cancer and was postulated to exhibit enhanced growth-promoting effects. However, the role of the SV-CCK-2R role in mediating carcinogenic eftects of matureamidated gastrin in colorectal cancers has not been fully explored. Aim: The aim of the present study was to determine whether the SV-CCK-2R mediates overexpression of the COX-2 gene in human colon cancer cells upon stimulation with gastrin. Methods: Colo320 ceils were transfected with the human CCK-2R wild type (Colo320WT) or the SV-CCK-2R (Colo320S\u00a5). After stimulation with gastrin, transactivation of the COX-2 promoter was determined by luciferase reporter gene assay. 5'-deletions of the COX-2 promoter were transfected into Co[o320SV or WT cells to narrow down the gastrin-responsive regulatory elements. Induction of COX-2 expression was further explored at the mRNA and protein level using real time RT-PCR and Western blotting. Prostagfandin E2 (PGE2) secretion was measured by ELISA. Results: Gastrin stimulated PGE2 secretion (2-3-fold) as well as COX-2 mRNA expression (2-fold) in Colo-320 cells expressing the SV-CCK-2R or wild type CCK-2R. Gastrirl also potently transactivated the -963 to + 70 bp COX-2 promotor/[uciferase reporter gene in a time-and concentration-dependent manner. A maximal gastrin response was observed upon stimulation with 100 nM gastrin after 10 h of incubation. A 5'-deletion analysis of the COX-2 promoter revealed that a proximal promotor sequence spanning -203 to + 70 bp is essential for gastrin-induced COX-2 transcription. Inhibition of the ERK1/ 2, p38 and JNK pathway revealed that all three signaling pathways are required for full transactivation of the COX-2 gene by gastrin. Conclusion: The effects of gastrin on the COX-2 gene are mediated through activation of the SV-CCK-2R. This observation provides a model how a mutant gastrin receptor can influence the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer.",

When aberrantly up-regulated in colon cancer these proteins act as morphogens, promoting the assumption of a better differentiated phenotype and retarding metastasis by their ability to activate FAK. To metastasize to the liver, tumor cells must elude immunological surveillance in and around the hepatic sinnsoids. Yet nothing is known about the kinetics of tumor ceil transit through this particular vascular space in serum-and protein-free conditions. Thus the aim of this study was to employ computer chip design (i.e., microfabrication) technology in order to create translucent synthetic sinnsoids allowing for cell transit to be evaluated as a function of GRP-induced FAK activation. Methods: Photomask templates of channels possessing an endothdial surface pattern were transferred to silicon wafers by photolithography. Microchannels were 10/*m in diameter and 150 ~m long, and connected to inlet/outlet reservoirs 5 mm apart. Sinusoidal shear stress (16 dynes/ crn 2) was generated using a double syringe pump.

Results: Only 50% of 293 cells exposed to GRP and activating FAK were able to transit the micwchannels under constant shear stress. Those transiting took over 300 ms to traverse the 150 l.trn distance. In contrast, FRNK up-regulation permitted 100% of cells to transit the micmchannel in less than 50 ms. Conclusions: GRP binding to its receptor causing FAK to become activated results in cells becoming less able to transit a nticrochannel designed to mimic a hepatic sinnsoid. Such cells would he susceptible to being targeted for destruction by immunological cells known to be resident in this space, and would decrease the propensity for successfully metastasizing to the liver.

            "text": "Smooth muscle of the gut expresses mainly VPACz receptors coupled via G~ to stimulation of cAMP and activation cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA). We have previously shown that VPAC2 receptor phosphorylation is mediated by G protein coupled receptor kinase-2 (GRK2), arid that GRK2 activity is enhanced via selective phosphorylation of GRK2 by PKA. Aim: To characterize the effect of PKA-induced GRK2 phosphorylation on desensitization, internalization and recycling of VPAC2 receptors in smooth muscle cells. Methods: Studies Were done in cultured gastric muscle cells expressing wild-type GRK2, kinase-inactive GRK2 (GRK2 K220R), arid the PKA pbosphorylation-site deficient GRK2 (GRK2 $685A). Receptor internalization and recycling were measured by radioligand binding and receptor biotinylation. Receptor desensitization was measured by the decrease in cAMP formation m response to VIP. GRK2 and VPAC2 receptor phosphorylation was measured by immunoprecipitation with specific VPAC~ and GRK2 antibodies in cells labeled with 32p. Results: VPAC2 receptor phosphorylation and internalization followed a similar time course and were maximal within 20 rain. VPAC2 receptor phosphorylation and internalization were absent in muscle cells expressing kinase-deficient GRK2, implying that receptor phosphorylation and internalization were exclusively mediated by GRK2. VPAC2 receptors were only partly phosphorylated in cells expressing PKA phosphoryfation-site deficient GRK2, implying that phosphorylation of GRK2 by PKA augmented GRK2 activity and VPAC2 receptor phosphorylation. VPAC2 receptor internalization, determined from residual mI-V1P binding and receptor biotinyfation after 30-min exposure to VIP, was greatly diminished (~65%) in ceils expressing PKA-site deficient GRK2. Similarly, receptor recycling, determined by recovery of mI-VIP binding or receptor biotinylation after 30-min treatment with VIP, was diminished in cells expressing PKA-site deficient GRK2. Finally, functional receptor desensitization, determined from the decrease in the cAMP response after 30-rain exposure to VIP, was also significantly diminished (56%) in cells expressing PleA-site deficient GRK2. Conclusion: VPAC2 receptor phnsphorylation is mediated by GRK2. Phosphorylation of GRK2 by PKA greatly enhances GRK2 activity and its ability to induce VPAC2 receptor phosphorylation, internalization and desensitization. The interaction of extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules with adhesion receptors in muscle contributes to tensile strength arid contractility. While prior work suggests that ligand type, receptor clustering, or inside-out signals might regulate adhesion, we postulated that adhesive force might also be determined by the mechanics of the membrane in which the receptor is anchored. METHODS: We assayed force associated with single adhesive bonds involving the ECM molecule, faminin, and a laminin receptor, dystrnglycan (DG) on the surface of live C2 myoblasts using high-resolution force spectroscopy. DG receptor expression was assayed by immunofluorescent and electron microscopy, and cell adhesion to collagen, fibronectin, and laminin assayed by 30 m/n attachment assay. RESULTS: C2 adhesion was greater for laminin compared to collagen or fibronectin, whereas immunofluorescence and electron microscopy demonstrated DG in clustered configurations on the cell surface in response to laminin. Evaluation of these laminin-DG bonds with force spectroscopy (225 force distance curves, 20 separate experiments) revealed two mechanical domains on the membrane: 1) bonds which detached at >500 rim membrane deformation, which were smaller in magnitude (38.2 +/-9.1 pN) and 2) bonds which detached at <500 nm membrane deformation, which were significantly greater (92.2 +/-37.9 pN, p< 0.05). Since receptor expression and clustering are related to cytoskeleta[ attachment, we elected to modify membrane mechanics through variation of DG receptor expression. We stably transfected wild type myoblasts with an anti-sense DG expression construct to yield a clone (l 1E) with 80-90% reduction of DG surface expression. Compared with wild type ceils, llE ceils demonstrated significantly less whole cell adhesion to laminin, less frequent and smaller DG clusters in response to faminin, and increased stretch with cantilever retraction. Force spectroscopy determined that reduced adhesion of the lie cells to laminin was due to the selective elimination of bonds occurring in low deformation membrane domains. CONCLU-SIONS: 1) DG is a laminin receptor expressed on the surface of myoblasts.",

            "text": "Short-term exposure of cells to substance P (SP) induces desensitization of the neurokinin-I receptor (NK1R) followed by receptor endocytosis and recycling by well-defined mechanisms. However, the mechanisms of down-regulation of the NK1R after long-term exposure to SP and subsequent recovery of responses have not been investigated. Aim: To investigated the effects of hing-term exposure of cells to SP on NK1R signaling and trafficking. Methods: We studied NKiR-transfected KNRK cells. We examined the effects of chronic exposure to SP on 1) Ca 2+ signaling, measured with fura2; 2) localization of the NK1R, determined by immunofluorescence and confocal microscopy; 3) NKIR ubiquitination, determined by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. Results: Incubation of KNRK-NK1R cells with SP (100 nM, 3 hours) abolished SP induced Ca 2 + mobilization, which after removal of agonist recovered within 16 hours. Recovery of NK1R signaling was prevented by cycloheximide (70 p,M) and epoxomicin (10 ~M), and is thus dependent on new protein synthesis and the proteolytic activity of the proteasome, respectively. Chronic exposure to SP induced redistribution of NK1R from the plasma membrane to an intracelhilar location. The NK1R was not found in early endosomes, nor was it co-localized with a [ysosomal marker. By immunoprecipitation of the NK1R and immunoblotting for ubiqintin, we observed that continuous exposure to SP for 1-5 hours induced formation of a ubiquitin-NKIR containing complex. To determine whether chronic SP exposure induced ubiquitlnation of the NK1R or an associated protein, we mutated all five lysine residues in the NK1R C-terminal taft to arginine. The mutant receptors was expressed at the cell-surface and signaled normally by mobilizing [CaZ+]~ and internahzing SP. Chronic exposure to SF still resulted in formation of the ubiquitin-NKiR containing complex in a similar manner to the wild-type receptor. However, after SP exposure, ceils expressing the mutant receptor (KNRK-NK1A5KR) were observed to recover signaling after a recovery period of 4 hours. Further, an additional mutant, in which all ten intracellular lysine residues were mutated recovered signaling in 2 hours. Conclusions: Chronic exposure of cells to SP down-regnlates signaling of the NKIR. This is associated with receptor ubiquitination. Recovery from down-regulation depends on the ubiquitination state of the receptor. Supported by DK39957.

The present study is designed to investigate the effect of NO suppression on the ghrelin dynamics. Methods. L-NAME (200 mg/kg/body) was administered subcutaneously to 7 week-old male Wistar rats. Seven days later, the rats were examined after 16-hours food deprivation. The plasma and gastric ghrelin levels were measured by radioimmunoassay, and the preproghrefin mRNA expression was measured by quantitative RT-FCR. Ghrelin-immunoreactive cells in the stomach were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Serum leptin levels were measured by ELISA. In a separate experiment, we also investigated the effects in rats administered D-NAME treatment. Results. In the L-NAME treated rats, the gastric total and active ghrefin levels, gastric preproghrelin mRNA expression levels, and the number of ghrelin-immunoreactive cells in the stomach showed no significant changes as compared with those in the control rats. While the daily food intake and body weight in the L-NAME treated rats decreased significantly as compared with those in the control rats, the plasma total (635.9-+ 18.8 fmol/ml) and active (59.0_+8.6) ghrelin levels in these rats increased significantly as compared with those in the control rats (total:522.2 _+ 12.6 fmol/ml, active:34.1 _+ 3.2, p<0.05), suggesting compensatory increase of plasma ghrefin. The serum leptin levels in the L-NAME treated rats (136.7_+45.2 pg/ml) decreased significantly as compared with those in the control rats (377.5+82.3 pg/ml, p<O.05). On the other hand, D-NAME treatment did not sigmficantly change plasma ghrelin levels. Conclusion With attenuation of NO synthesis, while the daily food intake decreased significantly, gastric ghrelin secretion increased significantly. Thus, ghrelin secretion might show a compensatory increase to offset the decrease of the appetite-stimulatory signal by NO. supernatants and whole cell lysates were separated by RP-18 reverse-phase HPLC. IL-8secretion in the supematants was determined by ELISA. Binding of 14C labelled 13-OxoODE was demonstrated using a His-tagged PPAR-'/overexpression construct. RESULTS: Stimulation of HT-29 and primary CEC homogenates with and without Ca-ionophor was followed by the formation of high amounts of the linoieic acid metabolite 13-OxoODE (155 and 85 ng/mL). The decrease of IL-8 secretion from 1EC (as a readout of cell activation) was more pronounced after preincubation with 13-OxoODE (57 % of TNF-a stimulated control, 25 ~M) compared to the PPAR-~ agonist troglitazone (76 % of TNF-a stimulated comrol, 25 p.M) and higher as with the known PPAR-~/ligands 13-HODE and 15-HETE. Binding assays with 14C-labelled 13OxoODE in cell lysates after overexpression of His-tagged PPAR-'y clearly demonstrated a direct interaction. CONCLUSION: High amounts of 13-OxoODE can be induced in CEC by stimulation of linoleic acid metabolism. 13-OxoODE binds to PPAR-'y and has anti-inflammatory effects. Therefore, 13-HODE dehydrogenase might be a CEC-specific therapeutic target in ulcerative colitis.",

Since PARs regulate hemostasis, inflammation, pain and healing, it is important to determine the agonists of these receptors. However, in many tissues the proteases that activate PARs are unknown. Although pancreatic trypsin may cleave and activate PAR~ and PAR4 in the small intestine and pancreas, these receptors are expressed by cells not normally exposed to pancreatic trypsin. Aim: To determine whether extrapancreatic forms of trypsin are PAR agonists. Methods: We assessed the expression of PARs and trypsinogens in extrapancreatic cell lines and tissues by RT-PCR, immunofluorescence and functional assays. We cloned and expressed these trypsinogens and determined if they activated PARs expressed in KNRK cells by measuring Ca 2\u00f7 transients. Results: Epithelial cells lines from prostate, colon and airway, and human colonic mucosa expressed mRNA encoding PAR~, trypsinogen IV and enteropeptidase (a natural activator of trypsinogens). Immunoreactive trypsinogen IV was detected in vesicles in these cells. Trypsinogen IV was cloned from PC-3 cells and expressed in CHO cells, where it was also localized to cytoplasmic vesicles. We enganeered trypsinogen IV with an N-terminal lgK signal peptide to direct constitutive secretion and allow enzymatic characterization. Enteropeptidase treatment of conditioned medium reduced the apparent molecular mass of trypsinogen IV from 36 to 30 kDa and generated enzymatic activity, consistent with formation of trypsin IV. In contrast to pancreatic trypsin, trypsin IV activity was unaffected by addition of polypeptide inhibitors, such as soybean trypsin inhibitor and aprotinin. Exposure of cell lines expressing PAR2 and FAI~ to trypsin IV increased [Ca~+]~ and strongly desensitized cells to subsequent challenges by PAR agonists. There were no responses in cells lacking these receptors. Conclusions: Trypsin IV is a potential agonist of FAR2 and PAR4 in extrapancreatic epithelial tissues where its resistance to endogenous trypsin inhibitors may permit prolonged signaling.

            "text": "Background: Non-amidated gastnns such as progastrin and glycine-extended gastrin 17 (G17gly) induce proliferation and migration of various cell lines in vitro, and proliferation of the colonic mucosa in vivo. Our earlier Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) study defined the tertiary structure of G17gly (ZGPWLEsAYGWMDFG), and showed that ferric ions are essential to its biological activity, the first binding to E7 and the second to E8 and 9 (Panneqinn et al., J. Biol. Chem. 277:48602-9 (2002) ). The aims of this study were to define the minimum biologically active fragment of G17gly, and to determine whether ferric ions were required for its biological activity. Methods: Fragments of G 17gly containing the five glutamate residues (LEsAYG, LE~AY, EsAY, LEsA, LEs, E~A and Es) were investigated. Activity was measured in proliferation and wound healing assays with the non-transformed gastric epithelial cell line IMGE-5. The requirement for ferric ions for activity was tested by inclusion of the iron chelator desferrioxamine in the assays. The stoichiometry and affinity of ferric ion binding to the G17gly fragments was determined by absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy, respectively, and the residues involved in binding were defined by NMR spectroscopy. Results: Cell migration and proliferation studies show that the nonapeptide LEsAYG is fully active, but that the activity of shorter peptides is reduced, and less dependent on the presence of ferric ions. Fluorescence quenching experiments indicate that all peptides bind 2 ferric ions with affinities between 11 and 34 ~M, approximately 20-60-fold weaker than for Ggly (Kd = 0.6 ~M). The NMR results show that the truncated peptides have no defined structure, and that the preferred iron binding sites differ from those in Ggly. Conclusion: We conclude that the N-terminal tetrapeptide and C-terminal pentapeptide of G17gly are not required for biological activity The homeobox containing gene PDX-1 is also expressed in the small intestinal mucosa and has been shown to play a critical role in both pancreatic development and in the expression of pancreatic-specific genes, including insulin. Purpose: To determine the role of PDX-1 in the regulation GIP expression in the intestinal K-cell. Methods: Immunohistochemistry was employed to evaluate the expression of PDX-1 and GIP in wild type (WT) and PDX-1 null mutant (KO) mice. Northern blot analysis, Western blot analysis, and immunocytochemistry were used to evaluate RNA and protein expression in the neuroendocrine cell line STC-1. Electromobility shift assays (EMSAs) and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays (ChiPs) with a PDX-1 specific antibody were employed to analyze specific DNA/protein interactions between PDX-1 and the GIP promoter. Results: Co-localization of GIP and PDX-1 was demonstrated in mouse intestinal K-cells, and an immunohistochemical comparison of WT and PDX-1 KO day 18.5 dpc mouse embryos showed a 95.6% reduction in the number of duodenal GIP-expressing cells in the absence of PDX-1 expression. In addition, both PDX-1 transcripts and protein were found in STC-1 cells, and EMSAs showed specific binding of PDX-1 protein to a cis-regnlatory region b~tween bases -151 and -156 of the G1P promoter. Finally, using ChIP analysis, we demonstrated in vivo binding of PDX-1 to this region of the GIP promoter. Conclusion: The results of these studies indicate that the transcription factor PDXd plays a critical role in the cell-specific expression of the G1P gene. They also suggest a possible ontogenic link between GIP and insulin. Abdominal surgery causes peritoneal adhesions in up to 95% of patients. The peptide substance P (SP), a proinfiammatory mediator, may participate in the local inflammatory responses associated with adhesion formation. Previously we showed in a rat model that a t SP receptor antagonist (SPRA) decreases adhesion formation. \"In peritoneal tissue contiguous to adhesions, the SPRA increases mRNA levels for tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and matrix metafioproteinase (MMP)-3 by 24 hrs post-surgery. The fibrinolytic effects of tPA prevent adhesions, and evidence implicates MMPs in the regulation of fibrinolytic acttvity. The aim of this study was to determine; (1) if SPRA administration affects peritoneal fibrinolytic activity in vivo, and (2) if SP alters expression of tPA and MMP-3 in mesothelial cells, which line the peritoneum and play an important role in adhesion formation. Methods: Using our rat model of adhesion formation, surgery was performed on 20 rats; 10 received daily IP injections (5.0 rag/kg; BID) of SPRA CJ-12,255 (Pfizer) and 10 received saline. At 24 hrs post-surgery, peritoneal fluid was collected from the operated animals and from 10 non-operated controls for assessment of fibrinolytic activity by fibrin zymography. Additionally, experiments were performed in a human mesothehal cell line (Met5A) to evaluate the role of SP in the peritoneum. SP (10-100 nM) was administered to the cells for 6, 12 and 24 hrs. Media was collected for assessment of MMP-3 activity by casein zymography, and tPA and PAId (tPA inhibitor) mRNA levels were analyzed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Results: Zymography of peritoneal fluid showed 4 bands of lysis that were determined to represent free tPA and tPA bound to PAId, et2-amiplasmin and Cl-esterase inhibitor. Total tPA activity in peritoneal fluid was significantly increased by surgery (43%) compared to non-operated controls, and was further increased by 53% (P < 0.05) by SPRA administration. In Met5A cells exposed to SP for 24 hrs, tPA mRNA expression decreased 20% (P < 0.05) with no effect on PAl-1 mRNA levels. Consistent with our previous data showing that SP decreases MMP-3 mRNA levels in Met5A cells, MMP-3 activity was decreased by 45% (P < 0.05) in the media at 24 hrs. Conclusion: The in vivo SPRA data support the hypothesis that SF promotes adhesion formation by inhibiting fibrinolytic activity in the peritoneal cavity. The in vitro studies suggest that this effect may be mediated, in part, by SP reduction of tPA and MMP-3 m peritoneal mesothelial ceils.",

We have previously reported a profound reduction in pyloric nNOS mRNA, protein expression and NO function in diabetic mice that is reversible with insulin treatment (JCl 106:373-384, 2000) . The 5' regulatory domain of mnrnie nNOS consists of multiple alternatively spliced tirst exons (la, lb, lc) and part of Exon 2 upstream of the translation initiation site previously reported to include a major promoter responsive to calcium (PNAS 97:8617-8622,2000) . Insulin-responsive mouse neuroblastoma N2A cells were transiently transfected with reporter constructs consisting of exons la, lb and lc without the downstream exon 2 sequences as well as exon 2 promoter alone fused to a ~-gal reporter gene. Following treatment with 100 nM insulin for 48 hours, reporter activity was significantly induced only in Exon 2 transfectants (484_+32.5 vs 2317 -+ 327 RLU/mg protein). Similar reporter induction was observed in transfectants treated with the insulin mimetic BPV (2.5~,M) Truncation analysis of the exon 2 promoter sequence revealed the presence of Insulin Response Elements (IRE) between -720 and -234 and -183 and -141 relative to the translation initiation site at + 1 and a site in the -183/-141 fragment for Sp-1 recently described as insulin responsive (J. Mol.End. 29:265-279, 2000) . Two major specific complexes were identified in nuclear extracts isolated from N2A cells treated with insulin for 24 hours using a radiolabeled oligonucleotide (-183/-141). One was disrupted by competition with excess Spl consensus oligonucleotide and antibody, the other by addition of egr-1 consensus ofigonucleotide and antibody. Other transcription factors tested did not compete. When N2A cells were co-transfected with -183 reporter construct and an SpI expression vector, both basal and insuhn stimulated reporter activity were sigmficantly increased in the double transfectants (basal : 133_+22 vs 539_+80; Insulin stimulated: 338_+ 30 vs 942_+ 86). Furthermore, pretreatment with 100nM Mithramycin A, a potent inhibitor of Spl binding to GC rich DNA motifs, totally abolished the stimulatory effect of Insulin. We conclude that Spl activates nNOS transcription through binding to the exon 2 promoter in response to insulin with possible interactions with egr-1.",

            "text": "Objective: The amphibian peptide bombesin (BN) and its mammalian homologue, the gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP), bind selectively to GRP receptors (GRP-R) with high affinity. While GRP-R has critical functions in the normal digestive system, the human GRP-R (hGRP-R) is found aberrantly over-expressed in cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, lung, and prostate, thereby mediating potent signals of cell proliferation via ligand-specific receptor activation. Previously, we showed that the MAP kinase pathway and subsequent activation of immediate early genes and Elk-1 are involved in BN-induced cell proliferation. Cyclin D1 (CD1), the regulatory subunit of several cyclin-dependent kinases, is an alternative downstream target of the MAP kinase pathway which is required for progression of the G1 phase and is, therefore, a critical target for proliferation signals in G1 phase. The objective of this study was to elucidate whether the human CD1 is involved in BN-induced mitogenic signaling. Methods: Northern blot and Western blot were used to detect hGRP-R dependent CD1 and Egr-1 expression. CD1 transcriptional activation was measured in prostate cancer cells with functional hGRP-R (DU-145) by transient transfection assays usmg serial human CD1 promoter-hiciferase reporter plasmids. Results: We found in this study that BN (100 riM) induced CD1 expression on both mRNA and protein level. In time course experiments, CD1 mRNA was increased from 4 to 12 hours after BN treatment. Similarly, CD1 protein was induced by BN between 6 and 18hrs after BN treatment with a mammum response occurring at 9 to 12hrs. Mutation and promoter activity analyses showed BN-enhanced CD1 transcription required the binding of nuclear proteins to the -144 to -104 bp region of the CDI promoter, which contains binding sites for transcription factors SP-1 and Egr-1. Expression of Egr-1 was also induced by BN and required for BN-enhanced CD1 transcription. Inhibition of the MAP kinase pathway with either MEK1 inhibitor PD98059 or the dominant negative Ras mutant, RasN 17, partially abolished BN-induced CD 1 promoter activity. Conclusions: BN-induced CD1 expression in DU-145 cells is mediated by Egr-1 activation and interaction of Egr-1 with the -144 to -104 bp region of the human CD1 promoter in a partially MAP kinase-dependent pathway. These findings represent a novel, alternative mechanism of BN-dependent stimulation of cell proliferation by regulating directly the cell cycle in human epithelial cancer cells. The goal of this study was to identify a mouse CCK gene region containing the sequences responsible for expression in intestinal endocrine ceils. METHODS: A lacZ expression constmct (CCKL1) containing 6.4 kb of mouse CCK gene sequence was tested in transgenic mice and in the mouse enteroendocrine cell line STC-1. CCKL1 expression in fetal and adult transgenic mice was determined by measurement of [3-galactosidase activity in tissue homogenates or by histochemieal staining of frozen tissue sections. Immunostaniing for CCK or the neuronal marker peripherin was used to identify the cell type expressing the tmnsgene. CCKL1 expression in STC-1 cells was assessed by transient transfection and measurement of ]3-galactosidase activity, and then compared to expression in the rat intestinal cell line IEC-6 and the non-intestinal cell lines CHO and HeLa. RESULTS: In transgenic mice, CCKL1 was expressed in intestine and brain and not in spleen and liver, which follows the tissue distribution of the endogenous gene. In line J 14, transgene expression was activated at the normal time in development (E14.5-E16.5) and localized to CCK-expressing cells.",

            "text": "Background : Previous studies (Gastroenterol 124: A-435, 2003) showed that somatostatin (SS) mRNA expression and pancreatic contents were increased in rats during streptozotocininduced diabetes with returns to control upon insulinotherapy. These observations suggested that insulin can negatively control pancreatic 8S mRNA expression and contents. This study was undertaken to demonstrate this negative control of insulin on SS mRNA expression. Methods : Streptozotocin (65 mg kg-l) diabetic rats with or without insulin and SS-RIN-14B cells were used. The exclusive presence of SS in the RIN cells was determined by confocal microscopy and SS mRNA in purified rat islets and RIN cells was estimated by RT-PCR. The effects of insulin on SS mRNA expression in RIN cells were tested according to various glucose and insulin concentrations in culture medium. Results : During diabetes, glycemia reached 30 mM from day 7 to 28 with a return to 8 mM (normal) upon 14 days of insulinotherapy. After 7 days of diabetes, SS mRNA in isolated islets increased 3 fold with a return to normal after 14 days of insulin. Confocal microscopy images clearly indicate that the RIN cells contain $5 without insulin and glucagon. In these cells, 30 mM glucose increased $8 mRNA by 92% above 2.8 and 5.6 mM values within 4h. 100 nM insulin for 4h reduced SS mRNA by 61, 21 and 53% in 2.8, 5.6 and 30 mM glucose, respectively. Finally, increasing concentrations of insulin from lnM tolO-6 M for 4h in a 30 mM glucose medium resulted in progressive reductions of SS mRNA expression in the R1N cells. Such decreases ranged from 16.6% at 1 nM insulin up to 60 % at 300 nM and 70 % at 10-6 M insulin. Summary : These studies clearly showed that 1) diabetes is associated with increased pancreatic SS mRNA expression and contents, an effect totally reversible by insulin; 2) the RIN-14N cells exquisitely synthesize SS as hormone; 3) SS mRNA expression in these cells is overexpressed in 30 mM glucose; 4) the inhibitory eftect of insulin on SS mRNA expression seems independent of glucose but totally dependent on insulin concentration; 5) the insulin and glucose effects are rapid as observed within 4h of exposure. Conclusions : Insulin is definitively involved in the negative control of pancreatic SS mRNA expression independently of glucose. Supported by NSERC Canada.",

            "text": "Xiaofu Wang, Qingding Wang, B. Mark Evers Neurotensin (NT), a gut tridecapeptide, has multiple physiological and pathologic effects in the GI tract such as stimulating proliferation of intestinal mucosa and certain colon and pancreatic cancers. Protease systems have been identified as important regulators of intracellular activities including apoptosis. Two prominent cytoplasmic protease systems have been identified: the ubiqintin-proteasome pathway and the calpain-calpastein system. The purpose of this study was to examine the role of protease systems on human NT (hNT) gene regulation. METHODS. The human pancreatic carcinoid cell line, BON, which expresses high levels of hNT mRNA, was treated with various protease inhibitors for 24 h. Northern or RNase protection assays were used to determine hNT and apoptotic gene expression. hNT promoter constructs were transfected into BON cells and treated with protease inhibitors; luciferase activity was assessed by Dual-Luciferase assays. BON cell apoptosis was measured by Cell Death Detection ELISA. RESULTS. The proteasome inhibitor, MG132, significantly decreased hNT mRNA expression in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, MG132 dramatically induced the apoptotic gene dnsterin (TRMP2) but had little effect on the expression of the Bcl-2 family of genes. Similar effects were obtained using another proteasome inhibitor, Lactacystin, but the effect was not as pronounced as with MG132. In contrast, the calpain inhibitor, calpeptin, had no effect on hNT or apoptotic gene expression. Consistent with the results of RNA expression, hNT promoter activity was reduced by both MG132 and Lactacystin, but not by calpeptin; the region -122 to -71 bp of the proximal hNT promoter appears to be responsible for the proteasome pathway regulation. Consistent with the effects on hNT expression, both MG132 and Lactacystin induced BON cell apoptosis with the greater effect noted with MG132; however, there was no effect of calpeptin on BON cell death. CONCLUSIONS. Our findings identify the proteasome pathway as critical for the constitutive expression of the gut peptide NT. Increased BON cell apoptosis correlated with inhibition of hNT expression. Apelin is a recently discovered peptide that is the endogenous ligand for the APJ receptor. Apelin is expressed in the stomach. Apelin stimulates cholecystokinin (CCK) secretion and GI epithelial cell proliferation. The purpose of these studies was to clone the human apelin promoter in order to elucidate molecular mechanisms underlying regulation of apelin expression. Methods. The 5'-flanking region of the human ape fin gene was cloned by PCR using human genomic DNA as a template. A ~4000 bp fragment of the human apelin 5'-upstream sequence and 5 '-deletions (4131, -2171, -1689, -1209, -730, -249 bp) were subdoned upstream of the luciferase gene into pGL-3 basic in order to identify elements essential for activation of transcriptional activity. Transient transfection experiments were done to identify cell type expression specificity. The effects of 5-azacytidine (5-AzaC, 2.5/*M, DNA methyl. transferase mhibitor-Dnmt) and trichostatin A (TSA, 300 nM, histone deacetylase inhibitor. HDAC) on activation of human apelin gene expression were tested in a human mammary gland cell line (Hs578T) in real-time PCR experiments. Results. The human apelin 5'upstream region was isolated, sequenced and verified. Approximately 100% of promoter activity was retained within the first -730/-76 bp of the 5'-flanking sequence, constructs were 150-fold more active than a promoterless construct. Highest transcriptional activity was measured in breast Hs578T and kidney (COS1) cells; core promoter activity was 2and lO-fold greater when compared to activity in colon and stomach cells, respectively. In breast cells, transcriptional activity of the Y-flanking region includmg sequences upstream of the -730 bp fragment was significantly lower, suggesting a repressor element in this region. TSA increased apelin gene expression 2-fold whereas 5-AzaC exposure did not increase apelin expression. Conclusions and Discussion. The -730/-76 bp fragment is suffi. cient to drive human apelin gene expression. The finding that apdin core promoter activity is higher in breast and kidney cells when compared to colon and stomach cells indicates that transcriptional regulation of apelin gene is cell-type specific and agrees with levels of apdin gene expression in the body. A repressor element may be present in the region upstream of the core promoter. The finding that the HDAC inhibitor increases apelin expression suggests that histone acetylation is a regulatory step in apelin gene expression.",

            "text": "Interferons are a family of cytokines with antiviral, antiprofiferative and immunomodulatory activities. Both IFN alpha and gamma are involved in the regulation of a large number of genes and are crucial for the macrophage activation. Aim of this study is to evaluate KC gene expression in basal condition and after stimulation with IFN alpha and gamma, in order to suggest possible mechanisms of action of these cytokines in macrophage activation. Methods. Rat KC isolated by collagenase perfusion and centrifugal elutriation were cultured for 24 hours and divided into three different groups: unstimulated; stimulated with IFN alpha (1000UI/ml); stimulated with IFN gamma (1000 UI/ml). After an 8 hours incubation period total RNA was extracted and processed according to Affymetrix protocols, until biotinilated cRNA, which was hybridized on R34A microarray gene set. Data analyses was performed using MAS 5.0 software. Genes showing remarkably different expression in microarray analysis were selected and confirmed by real time PCR. Results. Nearly 4000 out of the 8800 genes represented in the array were expressed by KC. Among these, IFN alpha upregulates 183 genes by over twofold and downregnlates 125 genes by 50% or more. Upregulated genes belong to a broad range of functional pathways and include effector proteins with strong antiviral activities, genes involved in antigen prcessing and presentation and tumor suppressor/proapoptotic genes. IFN gamma, on the other hand, upregnlates over twofold 188 genes, and downregnlates 264 genes by 50% or more. Most of the genes induced by IFN alpha are also induced by IFN gamma. Downregnlated genes include genes of cytoskeletal regulation like EB1 and markers of proliferation like cyclin D1. RT-PCR confirms the results of the array. Conclusion. This study shows that IFNs directly target rat KC and are involved in the regulation of a wide variety of genes. The analysis of their expression profile shed light onto molecular mechanism of KC activation in specific pathways such as antiviral and antitumor processes. Ghrelin, originally discovered in the stomach, stimulates food intake and triggers secretory and motor responses but the involvement of this peptide in gastroprotection has been little studied. We compared the effect of ghrefin applied intraperitonealfy (i.p.) or intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) on gastric secretion in rats with chronic gastric fistula and gastric lesionS induced by 3.5 h of water immersion and restraint stress (WRS) or ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) with or without inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX) with indomethacin and rofecoxib, the COX-2 inhibitor; B) suppression of nitric oxide (NO)-sFathase by L-NNA; C) blockade of sensory nerves by capsaicin (125 mg/kg s.c.) and CGRP release by CGRPs.37 (100 ~g/kg i.p.); and D) cutting of vagal nerves (bilateral vagotomy). The area of gastric lesions was measured by plainmetry, the gastric blood flow (GBF) was determined by H2-gas clearance technique and gastric luminal NOx levels was measured by Griess method. Blood and mucosal biopsy samples were collected for assessment of plasma ghrelin levels by RIA and mRNA for ghrelin by RT-PCR. WRS produced typical gastric bleeding erosions and significantly raised plasma ghrelin levels and mRNA for ghrelin in the gastric mucosa. Ghrelin (5 -80 ~g/kg i.p.) increased gastric acid secretion as compared to basal and dose-dependently attenuated gastric lesions induced by WRS and I/R; the dose reducing these lesions by 50% (EDs0) was 20 p.g/kg and 30 ~g/kg, respectively. Ghrefin (150-2400 ng/rat i.c.v.) attenuated significantly gastric lesions induced by WRS and I/R and the gastroprotective effect of central and peripheral ghrefin were accompanied by the significant rise in plasma ghrelin level and an increase in the GBF and luminal NOx content. The protective and hyperemic effects of ghrelin applied i.p. and i.c.v, were completely abolished by vagotomy and significantly attenuated by suppression of COX-1 and COX-2 with indomethacin and rofecoxib and by sensory denervation with capsaicin or CGRP antagonist, CGRPs.37. L-NNA attenuated significantly ghrelin-induced protection and hyperemia but addition to L-NNA of L-argiinne, but not D-arginine, restored the protective and hyperemic effects of both hormones. We conclude that central and peripheral ghrelin exerts a potent gastroprotective action on the stomach depending upon vagal activity and sensory nerves and involving hyperemia mediated by NO and prostaglandin but unrelated to acid secretory effects.,",

            "text": "Orexin A (OXA) is a novel neurupeptide that increases food intake and inhibits fasting small bowel motility in rats. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of intravenous (IV) oXA and endogenous OXA on acid secretion, gastric emptying and the distribution of orexin immunoreactivity in the rat stomach. In additon the half-life of OXA in rat plasma was studied. Rats equipped with a gastric fistula were subjected to IV infusion of OXA (500 praol/kg/min) or the selective orexin-1 receptor (OX1R) antagonist SB-334867 during saline or pentagastin (90 pmol kg-1 rain-l) infusion. After administration of polyethylene glycol ~000 (PEG 4000) with 51Cr as radioactive marker, or a liquid nutrient with 51Cr, gastric retention was measured after a 20-min infusion of OXA or SB-334867-A. Immunohistochemit, try against OXA, OXB, orexin receptors (OXR), gastrin and neuronal NOS (nNOS) in the gtomach was performed. Another group of rats were given OXA (100 pmol/kg/min) for different time intervals in order to calculate plasma half-life. The OX1R antagonist SB-334867-A inhibited both basal (-28.7 +/-9.6, p<0.05) and pentagastrin-induced (-7.3 +/-10.6 Ixmo]/30 rain, p<0.05) gastric acid secretion and decreased gastric retention of the I/quid nutrient (saline 32.8 +/-3.5 and nutrient 66.9 +/-4.3 %, respectively), but not nonnutrient liquid (PEG 4000). OXA alone had no effect on either basal acid secretion or gastric emptying. The plasma half-life of OXA was 27.1 +/-9.5 min. Stepwise increasing infusion rates of OXA confirmed a linear concentration-time curve and thus first-order kinetics. Plasma OXA decreased after nutrient intake and after infusion of SB-334867-A (201.8 +/-5.5, 34.4 +/-2.8, 32.5 +/-10.6 pmol/L respectively for saline, nurient and OX1R antagonist, p<0.05). Orexin. and orexin receptor-immunoreactivitiy were found in the mncosa, myenteric nerve cells bodies and varicose nerve fibers in ganglia and circular muscle of the stomach. A subset of these structures co-expressed VIP, gastrin or nNOS. In conclusion, by use of an antagonist, endogenous OXA seem to influences gastric acid secretion and gastric emptying of a nutrient liquid. The pineal gland secretory product, melatonin, exhibits gastroprotective activity against mucosal damage induced by strong irritants but whether central application of this hormone or its precursor, L-tryptophan, influence gastric mucosal defense remains to be elucidated. We studied the effect of intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of melatonin or Ltryptophan on acid gastric secretion in rats with gastric fistula and in those with 3.5 h of water immersion and restraint stress (WRS)-induced gastric lesions with or without A) removal of pineal gland (pinealectomy); B) luzindole (3 mg/kg i.p.), an antagonist ofmelatonin Mel2-receptors; and C) functional ablation of sensory nerves by capsaicin (125 mg/kg s.c. within three days). The number of gastric lesions was determined by planimetry, the gastric blood flow (GBF) was assessed by H2-gas clearance method and the plasma melatonin and gastrin levels were measured by specific RIAs. Exposure to WP, S produced gastric lesions accompanied by the increase in gastric acid output, the fall in the GBF as compared to baseline and these effects were augmented by pinealectomy or capsaicin-denervation. Both, melatonin and L-tryptophan (1.25-10 Ixg/kg or 5-50 Ixg/kg i.c.v) that raised the plasma melatonin levels by 3-4 folds over basal, significantly decreased gastric secretion. Melatonin dose-dependently reduced the WRS-induced gastric lesions; the dose inhibiting these lesions by 50% (EDs0) being 5 Ixg/kg, and produced a significant rise in the GBF and plasma immunoreactive gastrin levels. These protective and hyperemic effects of melatonin were significantly reduced by luzindole and completely abolished by capsaicin-denervation and further restored by exogenous CGRP (10 gg/kg s.c.) added to melatonin and L-rtyptophan in capsaicin-denervated animals. Pinealectomy exaggerated WRS-induced lesions and significantly decreased accompanying fall in the GBF. These deleterious effects were counteracted by i.c.v, supplementation of pinealectomized rats with melatoinn (2.5 Ixg/kg) or L-tryptophan (10 Ixg/kg) and further abolished by concurrent treatment with luzindole. We conclude that central melatoinn and that derived from L-tryptophan, inhibits gastric secretion and exhibit gastroprotective activity against WRS damage via mechanism involving an activation of Mel2 receptors and gastric hyperemia possibly mediated by sensory neuropeptides such as CGRP and by gastrin, known to exert gastroprotective, vasodilatatory and trophic actions. Sensory information transmitted by vagal afferents largely fails to reach the level of conscious perception. Recent human studies indicate that high frequency, low energy gastric pacing enhances tolerance to gastric distension in patients with diabetic gastroparesis. Similar eleertostimulation also reduces dyspeptic symptoms independent of gastric emptying in another group of diabetic patients. These observations implicate the vagal afferents in the modulation of noeiception and pain. The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is functionally related to cognitive, emotional, and affective processing of sensory information. We hypothesize that vagal stimulation modulates ACC activities, leading to enhanced tolerance to visceral stimulation. We recorded the electrophysiological response of single ACC neurons to graded CRD (10, 20, 50 mm Hg) in control rats and in rats with visceral hypersensitivity (VII) induced by intracolonic instillation of 0.6% acetic acid followed by 3 days of periodic CRD. Vtl did not show gross colonic pathology. None of 33 ACC neurons in controls responded to CRD. In contrast, basal firing rates of ACC neurons of VH rats were higher compared to controls (1.9 _+ 0.1 vs 0.8 _+ 0.07 spikes/sec), and graded CRD evoked responses in 1 (4%), 4 (15%) and 12 (44%) of 27 ACC neurons tested. Vagotomy or perivagal application of capsaicin did not alter ACC responses to CRD. To investigate the vagal afferent role in modulating ACC activities, we studied the effect of electrical subdiaphragmatic vagaI stimulation (EVS) on ACC activation by CRD (50 ram Hg) in AC rats. Low-intensity EVS (80, 100 Ix A, 30 Hz), which activates vagal A fibers, reduced basal and CRD-induced firings by 42% and 59%, respectively. This inhibitory action was not affected by perivagal application of capsaicin. In contrast, high-intensity EVS (200, 500 Ix A, 2 Hz), which activates vagal C fibers, had no effect. Intracellular recording of nodose ganglia neurons followed by immunohistochemical labeling showed that 7 of 8 nodose neurons activated by low-intensity EVS were GABA-immunoreactive (ir). One neuron was glutamate-it and none contained substance P. This is the first report that activation of vagal afferent A fibers reduces ACC neuronal activities stimulated by noxious CRD. These A fiber nodose neurons were mainly GABA-ir. Activation of this vagal afferent pathway may decrease nociception and reduce pa!n and other dyspeptic symptoms evoked by visceral stimulation by modulating ACC activities.",

            "text": "Inhibition of Lumbar Splanchnic Afferent Mechanosensitivity by Galanin Benjamin D. Phillis, L. Ashley Ashley Blackshaw Background: Galainn (GAL) is a 29 amino acid neuropeptide present in both the central and peripheral nervous system. We and others have shown it may act peripherally to inhibit mechanosensitivity of primary afferent endings in skin, joints, stomach and esophagus (e.g. Page et al DDW 2003 , Flatters et al Neurosci. 116 (2003 1005). Aims: Investigate the effects of GAL on the mechanosensitivity of high threshold colonic primary afferents, with a view to its role in colonic hypersensitivity. Methods: Using an in vitro rat colonic afferent preparation, distal colon and lumbar splanchnic nerve (LSN) were removed intact. In a specialised organ bath, the colon was opened longitudinally off-centre and pinned fiat. The LSN were guided through to an oil filled chamber and single units recorded. Six serosal/ mesenteric afferents were classified according to the location of their mechanoreceptive field and responses to mechanical stimuli: blunt probing and application of a calibrated yon Frey hair (10rag for 3s). Drugs were added to a metal ring surrounding the receptive field. Results: Incubation with human GAL (10~\u00b0-I08M) for 10 minutes was not found to sigmficantly change spontaneous discharge (n = 6) in comparison to incubation with 0.1% BSA-Krebs vehicle (2-factor repeat measures ANOVA). The number of action potentials generated in response to probing were reduced in 5/6 units (54_ + 16% at 10-8M), resulting in a dose dependent reduction in mean peak instantaneous frequency (p<0.05, one-way ANOVA). Galanin induced a concentration dependent excitatory effect in one unit. Both inhibitory and excitatory effects were reversed by the selective galanin receptor antagonist galantide (108M) and by washout. Time controls showed no effect unrelated to drug administration. Conclusion: These results suggest that GAL may reduce the mechanical sensitivity of a subpopulation of colonic primary afferents. The lack of GAL specific antagonists makes it difficult to determine which of the 3 galanin receptor subtypes is involved in this inhibitory effect, but GalR1 and GalR3 are candidates.

Studies focused on brain localization of the melanocortin-4 receptor (MC4-R/based on in situ hybridization analysis of MC4-R mRNA m rat brain indicate that the most intensely labeled cells are contained in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV) (Molec. Endocrinol. 8:1298 Endocrinol. 8: , 1994 . Within the DMV, MC4-R mRNA is most intense in the medial part of the rustral two-thirds of the nucleus, i.e., the region that projects to the stomach (J. Comp. Neurol. 457:213, 2003) . The purpose of our study was to determine the effects of activation of MC4-R in the medial-rostral DMV on gastric motility. This was performed by unilaterally microinjecting two doses (5 and 20pmol/3Onl) of MTI1, a potent cyclic agonist of MC3-R and MC4-R, into the rostral DMV of anesthetized rats while monitoring gastric activity with an intragastric balloon. L-glutamate was used as a tool to identify the rostral DMV for subsequent MTII microinjections, since it has been previously shown that microinjection of L-glutamate into the region of the DMV rostral to obex in the rat causes an increase in intragastric pressure (NeurogastroenteroI. Mot. 10: 305, 1998) . At a dose of 5pmol, MTII produced an increase in gastric motility by 127 + 47 mmHg.sec area under the curve) (n = 4). This effect occurred immediately upon MTII administration and lasted only 49.4 seconds. The four-fold higher dose of MTII (n = 4) also increased gastric motility (176 + 141 mmHg.sec area under the curve). This effect also occurred immediately and lasted 145 seconds. The excitatory effect of MTII on gastric motility closely resembled that observed with L-glutamate and could be reproduced after 20 minutes (the excitatory L-glutamate effect was repeatable at 5 to 10 minute intervals between microinjections). Our findings indicate that activation of MC4-R in the rostral DMV increases gastric motility, presumably by exciting cholinergic motor neurons in the DMV that synapse with postganglionic cholinergic neurons innervating the stomach.

The affinities to the human NK2 and rat NK3 receptor were much lower (pKi NK2: 6.3, pKi NK3: 5.3). In functional cell assays using chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the recombinant human NK1 receptor, SLV 317 potently inhibited the SP-induced increase in cAMP and inositol-tris-phosphate with pA2 values of 8.9 and 8.8, respectively. Furthermore, SLV 317 concentration-dependently inhibited the SP induced relaxation in the phenylephrine precontracted guinea-pig aorta in vitro with an ECs0 value of 1 nM. To investigate the NK1 antagonistic potency of SLV 317 in viva, its ability to antagonise SP induced hypotension was investigated in anaesthetised guinaa-pigs. The EDs0 after i.v. administration was 9 nmol/ kg. After oral administration, SLV 317 inhibited the NK1 response with a long duration of action and an EDs0 (determined 1 h after the administration) of 0.68 p.mol/kg. SLV 317 was also tested in a rat model of visceral hypersensitivity and pain. After sensitisation of colonic afferents by previous instillation of diluted acetic acid, colonic distension induced nociceptive behavioural responses such as abdominal cramps and writhing. Using 100 p~mol/ kg SLV 317 s.c., a long lasting effect could be demonstrated during the test period of 120 minutes after drug administration (mean inhibition during 30-120 rain after administration was 55.5%). A maximal inhibition of 70% was achieved. The data demonstrate that SLV 317 is a potent and orally active NK1 antagonist. The ability of the drug to reduce visceral hypersensitivity suggests that SLV 317 might be beneficial in irritable bowel syndrome. Both peptides were given either icy or ip. Thirthy min later gastric lesions were induced by the intragastric administration of 50% ethanol (1 ml/rat). Rats were sacrificed 5 min after ethanol exposure, individual hemorrhagic lesions were measured along their greatest length and the overall total lesion was designated as lesion index. Results. lcv injection of N/OFQ, 1 to 4 ~g, dose-dependently inhibited the formation of gastric mucosal lesions caused by ethanol. Maximal reduction was 69.9 _+ 16.7 % (P<0.01 vs vehicle, n = 8-10), following N/OFQ 4 pg. Time-course studies showed that peak effect was exerted by N/OFQ at 4 b~g when injected 30 min before ethanol challenge, declined at 60 rain (16.1 \u00b1 2.2 %, n = 8) and was absent at 120 rain. UFP 101, over the range 2.5 to 10 p.g icv, was ineffective when given alone and dose-dependently antagonized the protective effect of N/OFQ 4/~g. A complete blockade was observed following UPF 101 at 10 p.g. Ip injection of N/OFQ, 1 to 40 p.g/kg, was similarly effective in preventing the development of gastric mucosal lesions. Maximal reduction was 42.8 \u00b1 16.5 % (P<0.05 vs vehicle, n = 7-8), lower than that achieved when N/OFQ was icv injected. The protective effect of peripherally injected N/ OFQ was antagonized by UFP 101, 20 to 200 p.g/kg ip. Conclusions. Present results indicate that N/OFQ acts both centrally and peripherally to protect the gastric mucosa from damage and that its effect is short-lasting in line with its pharmacokinetic features. Protection by N/OFQ appears to be mediated by activation of NaP receptors and adds further support to the hypothesis that N/OFQ may partecipate in the regulation of gastrointestinal functions.",

IK channel-like immunoreactivity (IK-1R) has been reported in human and rat dorsal root ganglia (DRG; Boettger et al., 2002, Brain 125, 252-63) and human enteric neurons (Arnold et al., 2002, NeuroReport I4, 191-5) . However, IK-1R has not been described in the normal human G1 tract using routinely fixed tissue specimens. Methods: Formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue blocks of human gastrointestinal tract and DRG (n>50) from patients undergoing surgery for a variety of conditions and autopsy specimens were obtained from local hospitals, following appropriate ethical procedures. FFPE rodent tissues were also studied. Immunohistochemistry was performed on 2p.m sections using rabbit anti-human lK (GSK, M20), raised against amino acids GGDLVLGLGALRRRKC from the N-terminal of the human 1K channel. Detection was performed using Zymed NBA kits (South San Francisco) and colour was developed in AEC before mounting in an aqueous medium. Non-immune serum and adsorption with immunizing peptide were used as controis. Results: IK-IR was present in myenteric and submucosal ganglia. The majority of ganglion cells appeared to be positive, although the intensity of staining varied from cell to cell; and nerve fibres in both plexi were also IK-1R. The proportions of ganglion cells labelled varied from tissue to tissue. IK-IR was also localized to most epithelia, albeit relatively weakly, with occasional epithelial cells (resembling enteroendocrine ceils) expressing IK-IR of equivalent intensity to positive neurons. Occasional mononuclear cells were also stained in the mucosa, submucosa and serosa. Rat and mouse enteric ganglia were also IK-IR and the epithelium in these species was strongly stained. Human, rat and mouse DRG expressed strong IK-IR, which was most intense in smaller diameter neurons, but IK-IR was also observed in some axons. All IK-IR was abolished when the antiserum was preadsorbed with antigenic peptide (100p.g/mL). Conclusions: The distribution of IK-IR in human G[ samples and DRGs is consistent with that seen in rodents and with earlier work. The localization of IK-IR in routine FFPE pathology samples will allow study of the distribution of this ion channel in various human intestinal diseases.",

Immunohistochemistry for mGIuR5 was performed in combination with retrograde tracing of gastric inputs to the NTS from the proximal stomach over 4 days (0.5% CTB-FITC). Results Administration of MPEP (10nmoles, icy) attenuated the response of NTS units excited by gastric distension by 81 \u00b1 4% (5 min, 6/7 units). In contrast, MFEP had no effect on units inhibited by gastric distension (3/3 units). Immunohistochemistry for mGluR5 in fixed, cryostat sections of the ferret NTS revealed heavy fiber labelling at the lateral border of the medial subnucleus and in the intermediate subnucleus of the NTS (regions in which neuronal responses to distension were recorded), Low level labelling was also seen in fibers in the lateral portion of the subnucleus gefatinosns and in traced soma in the dorsal motor vagal nucleus (DMV). Conclusions These findings indicate that gastric input to the ferret NTS is mediated by mGluR5. This combined with localization of mGluR5 to fibers in the medial NTS suggests mGluR5 has a prominent central role in visceral input, mGluR5 may prove a suitable target for reducing afferent input for therapeutic",

The endogenous ligand for the growth hormone secretagogue receptor subtype la seems to transduce changes in food intake to the central nervous system. Elevated ghrelin levels in patients with anorexia nervosa were shown to retum to normal after partial weight gain. The aim of our study was to investigate postprandial plasma ghrelin concentrations during weight gain. Methods: Fasting plasma ghrelin levels were measured in 20 female patients with anorexia nervosa (25,6+ 1 years) following psychotherapeutic treatment intervention in a psychosomatic institution (10.6\u00b10.8 months). Standardized tests with 250 ml fluid meal (9.4 g protein, 34.4 g carbohydrates, and 8.3 g fat) were performed in patients at three different times (after admission, after partial weight gain of 2.8\u00b10.1 kg, and 7.6\u00b10.5 kg, respectively).

Conclusions: Our study shows a significant postprandial suppression of plasma ghrelin levels in patients with anorexia nervosa. After weight gain basal plasma ghrelin levels significantly decrease, however relative meal-induced ghrelin decrease is not significantly different. These findings indicate that acute changes in energy balance in anorectic patients are independent from chronic changes in energy balance. Recently, six homologues of gp91 ph'~ have been identified and named systematically as the NADPH oxidase (Nox)/dual oxidase (Duox) family. Among these family members, Noxl is thought to be responsible for generating superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide for tumorigenicity and angiogenic functions in mice injected with Noxl-transfected NIH 3T3 cells. Primary cultures of guinea pig gastric pit cells express Noxl and spontaneously produce superoxide anion at considerably high rates when exposed to Helicobactor pylori (Hp) lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from type I, but not from type I[ strains, suggesting art important role of Noxl m Hp-triggered, ROS-mediated carcinogenesis in the stomach. In this study, we precisely examined the mechanism for the priming with Hp LPS. Guinea pig pit cells cultured in LPS-free conditions constitutively expressed p67 p~\u00b0~, its new homologue (p51~*), p22 ph\u00b0~, and Racl mRNAs as well as Noxl. In response to Hp LPS, these cells induced expression of Noxl and a novel p47 P~\" homologue (p41 ~) mRNAs, while levels of the other component mRNAs were not changed. Actinomycin D or cycloheximide completely bDcked the priming effect of Hp. RNA interferences targeting Noxl and IN-1 ~x significantly suppressed the up-regulation of superoxide generation. Furthermore, we found that Hp LPS increased GTP-bound Racl within 5 min, and this activation continued for up to 16 h, which was confirmed by the pull-down assay of human PAK2 protein. A phosphoinositide 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 completely blocked the Hp LPS-induced activation of Racl and superoxide generation without affecting the LPS-triggered expression of Noxl and p41 \"\u00b0~ mRNAs. Finally, we confirmed that transfection with a constitutievely active Racl adenovirus vector or direct activation of Racl by phorboI 12-myristate 13-acetate completely reversed the LY294002-induced inhibition of snperoxide generation. Our results suggest that Noxl and p41 \u00b0\u00b0x may be inducible in response to Hp infection. This study also demonstrates for the first time that Racl plays an indispensable role in the full activation of Noxl.",

Rao, James L Madara It has become increasingly apparent that a dynamic molecular cross talk exists between the microflora and mucosal epithelial cells of the gut. Patients with inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) have higher amounts of bacteria attached to their epithelial surfaces than do healthy people. Evidence indicates that IBD results from aberrant immune activation of the intestinal mucosa by normal, usually commensal, host bacterial flora and/or their products. Our laboratory has previously reported that bacterial-epithelial interaction involved proinflammatory NF-kappaB pathway. In these studies, we define a novel bacteria effector protein AvrA regulating other than NF-kappaB pathway. It regulates beta-catenin pathway, which is important in control epithelia proliferation. We also find interesting cross talk between NF-kappaB and beta-catenin pathways. We used human epithelial cells HT29-C19A and T84 as in vitro models, we found that AvrA expression in epithelial cells directly regulated the expression of beta-catenin and it target gene C-myc. Cell proliferation was enhanced in nonvirulent Salmonella PhoPc colonized cells when compared with those colonized by wildtype Salmonella, or AvrA mutant strain. Our immnuno-precipitation results showed there was a physical interaction between NF&appaB and beta-catenin.

Bacterial-host interactions might induce long-term cellular responses in addition to the more transient inhibition of acute inflammatory responses, utilizing bacteria-derived factors to activate host machinery. While we have previously shown that IEC respond in a differential fashion to bacterial DNA, it/s unknown how IEC interact with bacterial DNA under inflammatory conditions. Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the effect of bacterial DNA on IEC immune responses in the presence of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, TNFa, and assess the effectiveness of oral administration of probiotic bacterial DNA in an animal model of colitis. Methods: HT-29 cells were pre-treated with DNA (50 g.g) from Salmonella Dublin, or the probiotic compound, VSL3, prior to incubation with TNFa (10 ng/ml). IL-8 secretion was measured by ELISA; IkB protein and mRNA levels by Western blotting and RT-PCR; NF-kB activation by reporter assays; and proteasomal activity by 20S proteasome assay kit. For in vivo studies, adult 129 Sv/Ev IL-10 z mice received VSL DNA orally (50 Ixg in 36.8 ~1) for 14 d. At sacrifice colons were removed and analyzed for TNFa and IFN3' mRNA levels and protein secretion. Results: TNF~ treatment stimulated IL-8 mRNA production and protein secretion. Pre-treatment with S. dublin DNA had an additive effect on 1L-8 secretion in response to TNFcc This was associated with enhanced NF-kB activation and increased IL-8 mRNA. In contrast, pretreatment of cells with VSL DNA resulted in a significant inhibition of IL-8 secretion, delayed NF-kB activation and stabilization of IkB. This was paralled by a reduction in proteasome activity. Interestingly, TNFc~-induced increases in mRNA levels of IL-8 were not significantly altered by VSL DNA, suggesting a possible inhibitory effect of probiotic DNA on chemokine translation or secretory processes. The ability of VSL DNA to down-regulate inflammatory responses was mirrored by in vivo studies, where treatment of IL-1W mice with VSL DNA by oral gavage resulted in a significant reduction of colonic IFN~/and TNFa secretion and mRNA levels, and attenuation of histological inflammation. Conclusions: In an inflammatory environment, DNA from pathogenic bacteria can augment epithelial immune responses through enhanced NF-kB signaling. In contrast, DNA from probiotic bacteria given orally has a beneficial effect in the treatment of colitis, possibly acting to limit inflammation through a specific down-regulation of epithelial chemnkine secretion.",

            "text": "Background: Growing evidence suggests that the pathogenesis of IBD involves a dysregulated mucosal immune response to the commensal bacterial flora. In this regard, bacteria and their byproducts elicit cellular responses primarily through activation of the innate immune system. There is currently little information regarding the innate immune response elicited by bacterial colonization of the intestinal tract in vivo. Methods and Results: In order to develop a database of innate immune response genes that are altered by bacterial colonization, colonic RNA was isolated from three groups of C.B 17.SCID mice and studied using Affymetrix microarrays: 1) Germfree, 2) Colonized with Altered Schaedler's Flora (ASP), a defined flora of 8 gut commensals, and 3) Monoassociated with Schaedler's E. coll. All target genes of interest were confirmed by quantitative RT-PCR. Mining of this database for alterations in epithelial genes identified a single family that was consistently and robustly activated (8 to g-fold) by commensal colonization, the Rag III[3/y family of autocrine growth factors. Studies in several different tissues have shown that this family of genes can be activated by immune stimulatory cytokines. Subsequent analysis of our database identified a single immune modulating cytokine, interferon gamma (IFN3,), which was strongly induced in SOD mice upon commensal colonization. Induction of IFNy was observed in both chronically colonized formerly germfree and well as conventionally housed SCID mice when compared to germfree SCID mice. Previous studies have shown that RegllI expression can be activated by IFNy, in vitro. Immunohistochemistry of the colon of E. coli monoasssociated SOD mice identified intraepithelial mononuclear cells as the sole source of IFN',/. Dual immunofluorescence showed that [FN3' expression colocalized with a marker for natural killer (NK) cells, asialo-GM1. Conclusions: These results provide the first demonstration that colonization of the intestinal tract with commensal bacteria results in the activation of a unique population of innate immune effector cells at the mucosal interface, intraepithelial NK cells (IENKs). In turn, IFNy production by IENKs may modulate the characteristics of the intestinal epithelium at this interface by activating the expression of RegllI, an autocrine epithelial growth factor. Culture supematant was run on SDS PAGE gels impregnated with 0.5% gelatin without heat/ reduction. Gelatinolytic bands were developed over 18 h. at 37 C in the presence/absence of specific protease inhibitor (PI, I~M). A murine closed loop model was used to study RRV infected BALB/c mice. Loops were constructed by tying the junctions at the stomach and duodenum, and then cecum and terminal ileum. Prior to tying the distal knot, 100 tx[ PBS _+ a mix of serine PI (aprotinin, leupeptin, and AEBSF) was injected intraluminally. Mice were sacrificed at 2h. and loop weights expressed as mg/cm. Net fluid secretion is total loop weight less tissue weight. Results : Zymograms from culture supematant of infected, but not uninfected, HT-29 cells showed proteolytic bands at 70-75, 90, and 125 kD. Cysteine, aspartic and metalloprotease inhibitors did not affect band development. However, serine PI (Pefabloc, benzamidine, aprotonin, and PMSF) and cation chelators completely inhibited all bands. The loop weight increase in RRV infected loops treated with PI was 31.93 _+ 5.3 mg/cm vs. 27.23-+ 3.65 mg/cm with no PI (p<0.02). Differences are expressed as net fluid secretion in the table below. There was no effect of PI in uninfected mice. Conclusion: RV infection causes increased release of serine proteases from intestinal epithelial cells. Serine protease inhibitors significantly increase the intestinal secretion that occurs in the murine model of RV infection. Thus, specific enhancement of proteolytic activity may modulate host fluid loss during infection. Attenuation of this activity may cause excessive secretion and more severe disease outcomes. Background & Aims: Epithelial ceils are sensors of the microbial environment and prime the host immune response by elaborating chemokines in response to bacterial signals from the enteric lumen. We previously demonstrated that some but not all probiotics confer protection against invasive salmonella infection. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the influence of Lactobacillns salivarius on epithelial cell IL-8 responses to invasive Salmonella typhimurium. Methods: HT-29 epithelial cells were stimulated with L salivarins or Salmonella typhimurium for 24 hours. In addition, L. salivarius was pre-incubated with epithelial cells (-2 hours), added simultaneously or added after (+ 2 hours) the addition of S. typhimurium or TNF and co-incubated for a further 24 hours. Supematant IL-8 levels were measured using ELISAs. The number of S. typhimurium cells adherent to epithelial ceils was measured by plating on Tryptic Soya Agar (TSA) following 5 washings of the apical surface. Results: In contrast to S. typhimurium and TNF, both of which induced significant secretion of IL-8 in a dose-and time-dependent manner, L. salivarius significantly reduced basal secretion of lL-8 by epithelial cells (p<0.05). Furthermore, the IL-8 response to S. typhimurium was significantly reduced by prior or simultaneous exposure of the epithelia to L. salivarina. This was not due to competitive exclusion of the pathogen by the probiotic at the epithelial surface because numbers of adherent S. typhimnrium were unaltered. The probiotic-associated reduction in IL-8 response was less evident when TNF was substituted for the salmonella stimulus and significant reductions were observed only when L. salivarius was pre-incubated with the epithelial cells. As expected, both TNF and S. typhimurium were associated with activation of NF-kB, but L Salivarius did not activate NF-kB. Conclusion: L. salivarius reduces epithelial cell IL-8 responses by a direct action on the epithelial cell rather than by exclusion of the pathogen from epithelial binding sites; the mechanism is unclear but may not directly involve NF-kB.",

We have previously shown that RS218 induces small intestinal villous damage in areas directly in contact with bacteria. The aim of these studies was to determine whether RS218 induced this damage via apoptosis. Methods: Spmgue-Dawiey rat pups were orally inoculated with RS218 or nonpathogenic E. coli HBI01 and sacrificed at 72 hours. Routine histology and TUNEL assay (TDT-mediated dUTP-biorin inck-end labeling) were performed on rat intestinal tissue and IEC-6 cells. Apoptosis in IEC-6 cells was quantified by Annexin V-FITC (AV) expression and loss of propridium iodide (PI) exclusion after incubation with RS218 at an MOI of 100:1. This tracked cells from AV-PI-(viable, no measurable apoptosis), to AV+ P1-(early apoptosis with membrane integrity), to AV + P1 + (end stage apoptosis and death). Caspases 1-9 were measured with the VAD muhi-caspase substrate. Surface expression of CD95 (Fas) was verified using specific monoclonal Ab. All cells underwent FACS analysis with Becton-Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer and were analyzed with CellQuest Software. Results: TUNEL+ rat enterocytes were confluent at villous tips directly in contact with RS218. Rats fed HB101 showed rare, diffuse TUNEL+ at the base of the crypts. After incubation with RS218 for 20 hours TUNEL+ IEC-6 cells increased from 0.16% to 87.03 +/-15.5%. Uninfected IEC-6 cells demonstrated, on average, 10% AV +, 23% PI + and 11% AV + PI + at baseline. After 2.4, 6, 8 and 12 hours of incubation with RS218, the AV + cells increased to 22%, 39%, 22%, 26% and 50%, PI+ cells increased to 26%, 71%, 81%, 98%, and 70%, while AV+PI+ was seen in 17%, 52%, 18%, 42%, and 38% of cells at those time points, respectively (all p<0.01 compared to baseline). Caspases were upregulated from 6% to 87% in IEC-6 cells and CD95 expression increased more than 100-fold in \"1\"84 cells incubated with RS218 for 18 hours. Conclusions: RS218 can induce damage in human and rat intestinal epithelial cells via apoptosis, perhaps by activating the CD95 pathway. Induction of apoptosis by E coli K1 may explain its ability to successfully translocate the intestinal barrier and disseminate. Understanding the mechanisms by which these host microbial interactions take place may lead to novel preventative or therapeutic treatments for gram negative sepsis and meningitis as well as inflammatory bowel diseases.",

Recent studies showed that TLR3 recognizes double stranded RNA (dsRNA) and induces immune responses. Rotavirna, having a daRNA genome, infects epithelial cells in the small intestine and causes acute gastroenteritis in young children. The aim of this study was to clarify whether rotavirus dsRNA modulate wound repair in IEC. [Methods] (1) Expression of TLR3 in IEC-6 cells: Expression of TLPO mRNA in IEC-6 cells was assessed by RT-PCR. Ampfified DNA fragment was subjected to sequencing analysis. (2) Wound assays: Confluent rnonolayers of IEC-6 cells were wounded and cultured for 24 hours in the absence or the presence of various concentrations (1, 10, 100 trg/ml) of rotavirus (strain RRV) RNA. Migration of IEC-6 cells was assessed by counting 1EC-6 cells observed across the wound border. (3) induction of cytokines: Expression of TNF-a, IL-6, Interferon IB (IFN~) mRNA by IEC-6 cells was assessed by RT-PCR at 0 and 2 hours after stimulation with rotavirus RNA (100/xg/ml). (4) Activation of signal pathway: Activation of ERK1/2 MAPK by stimulation with rotavims RNA was assesses by Western Blot. (Results] (1) Intensified expression of TLR3 mRNA was observed by RT-PCR. (2) Epithelial migration into the wound area was diminished 0.71 times (p< 0.01), 0.72 times (p<0.0l), or 0.20 times (p<0.01) by exposure to 1/~g/ml, 10l-~g/ml, or 100~g/ ml of rotavirus RNA (3) Expression of TNF-c\u00a2, IL-6, IFN~3 mRNA by IEC-6 ceils was induced at 2 hours after stimulation with rotavirus RNA. (4) ERK1/2 MAPK was activated 15rains after stimulation with rotavirus RNA. IConclnaion] Rotavirus dsRNA induced expression of inflammatory cytokines and significantly diminished wound repair in IEC.

Gastroenterology 2003;124:A591). S. flexneri can induce i) acute changes in the neurochemical phenotype and ii) morphological alterations suggestive of neuronal damages in human submucosal neurons. Therefore, the goal of this study was to investigate the mechanisms involved in these effects using a pharmacological approach in an ex vivo human colonic model. Methods: Segments of colon from patients undergoing surgery for cancer were mounted in a modified Ussing chamber. The invasive (M90T) or non invasive (B5176) strains of S. fiexneri were added to the mucosal side of the chamber. After 3 hours of culture, the tissue was fixed and microdissected to obtain whole mount of Meissner plexus. Neuronal form of nitric oxid synthase (nNOS) and neuron specific enolase (NSE) were detected using immunohistocherak cal methods. Pharmacological studies were performed using an itthibitor of NOS (L-NAME; 50/xmol) and an antagonist of the NMDA receptors (MK-801; 20 Ixmol). Results: Mg0T did not modify the total number of neurons per ganglia (7+/-1 vs 6+A2 respectively;, p = 0.31; n = 11 ). Nevertheless, the proportion of neurons expressing nNOS was significantly decreased in the presence of M90T as compared to BS176 (3.5+/-1.7% vs 11.7+/-2.8%., p = 0.03; n = 6). This effect was blocked by preincubation of tissue with L-NAME. In addition, M90T induced a significant decrease in NSE labeling of enteric neurons (-45 +/-11%; n = 8; p<0.001) and altered neuronal morphology as compared to BS176. This latter effect of M90T was blocked by MK-801 but not by L-NAME Conclusion: These results confirm that S. fiexueri alters the ENS and induces changes in the neurochemical phenotype of submucosal neurons. The alterations of the neuronal phenotype are mediated at least in part via an b NAME dependent pathway while the alterations of NSE labeling might be mediated by NMDA receptors.",

CACO-2 ceils constitutively express TLR2 and are LPS and peptidoglycan (PGN) unresponsive. As measured by activation of a NF-kB-luciferase reporter, over-expression of TLR1 (CACO-2Fi'LR1) or TLR6 (CACO-2/ TLR6) sensitizes CACO-2 ceils to LPS (commercial) or PGN, respectively, in a TLR2dependent fashion (dnTLR2 tranfectants inhibit LPS-or PGN-induced activation) via formation of TLRI/TLR2 or TLR2/TLR6 complexes. In contrast, TLR4/MD2 transfectants (CACO-2/TLR4+MD2) sense LPS but not PGN independently of TLR2. CACO-2/TLR1, CACO-2/ TLR6 and CACO-2/TLR4 + MD2 were then utilized to compare three model intracellular enteric pathogens: gram-positive L. monocytogenas and gram-negative S. fiexnerii and S. paratyphi. TLR4/MD2 recognized gram-negative bacteria, while the specificity of TLR2 depended upon the partner it associated with: TLRI or TLR6. TLR1/TLR2 recognized gramnegative pathogens; TLR2/TLR6 was specific for gram-positive Listeria. The intracellul~r presence of bacteria was not required as outer bacterial cell wall components were sufficient for activation of TLRs. Re-purified commercial LPS as well as wild type and LPS-free mutant of N. meningitidis confirmed that LPS was specifically recognized by TLR4/MD2. The ligand for TLRI/TLR2 differed from LPS but it was recognized in LPS-dependent fashion. In contrast, TLR2/TLR6 detected PGN of gram-positive bacteria. Fiilafly, triggering of the TLR complexes in CACO-2 led to inflammatory chemokine (11--8, MCP-1 and 1P-10) expression but not IL-lb and IL-12 p40 production whereas PB monocytes were unable to produce MCP-I and IP-10 when stimulated through TLRs, but upregufated IL-8, IL-lb and IL-12. These findings demonstrate tissue specific differences in TLR-induced responses and may represent the functional consequences of the activation of TLR-positive IECs in vivo during acute bacterial infection in the gut.",

The clinical spectrum varies from mild watery to bloody, inflammatory diarrhoea and is frequently associated with post infectious extraintestinal complications such as Guillain-Barr6 Syndrome. Despite the serious health problem caused by the bacterium, disease pathogenesis remains poorly understood. In the present study we have investigated the role of epitheIM antimicrobial peptides (beta-defensins) during C.jejuni infection. Methods: Human colonic intestinal cell line (Caco-2) was infected with 108 cfu/ml virulent strain (NCTC 11168) of (2 jejuni and defensin gene expression was assessed by RT-PCR. The bactericidal activity of recombinant human beta-defensins (hBDs) -1, 2 and -3 against test strains was evaluated by broth-dilution assay. Results & Conclusions: A marked timedependent induction of hBD3 was observed with maximal expression at 8 hours postinfection. In contrast hBD2 gene expression was modest. Importantly the bacterium was found to he highly susceptible to the antimicrobial action of hBD-3 amongst the peptides tested. Our studies suggest that hBD-3 is likely to contribute to the self-limiting nature of the infection via enhanced bacterial clearance.",

The Nox family comprises Noxl (initially termed Moxl or NOH-I), Nox2 (renamed gp91Ps\u00b0x), Nox3, Nox4 (Renox), and Nox5. Noxl is preferentially expressed in the colon, while physiological roles of Noxl have just started to be investigated. More recently, the Nox organizer 1 (NOXO1; we refer to it as p4P \u00b0~ here) and NOX activator 1 (NOXA1; p5P \u00b0~) genes that encode novel p47 ph\u00b0~ and p67 ph\u00b0~ homologues, respectively, have been cloned. These new adaptor proteins are thought to be essential for Noxl activity. We have established primary cultures of guinea pig large intestinal epithelial ceils giving 90% purity of surface mucous cells. These cells spontaneously released superoxide anion of 160 nmol/mg protein/h and expressed the Noxl, p22 Ph\u00b0~, p67 ph\u00b0', and Racl mRNAs, but not the gpgl ~' h\u00b0~, Nox4, p47P~% p4tY 'h\u00b0~, and Rac2 mRNAs. They also expressed p41 '\u00b0x and p51 ~-'. Human colon cancer cell lines (T84 and Caco2 cells) expressed the Noxl, p22 ph\u00b0~, p51 ~ and Racl mRNAs, but not the other NADPH component mRNAS, and secreted only ~aall amounts of superoxide anion (< 2 nmol/mg protein/h). Co-transfection of p41 ~ and pSl ~ cDNAs in T84 cells enhanced PMA-stimulated superoxide release 5-fold. Treatment of the transfected T84 cells with recombinant flagelfin (rFIiC) from Salmonella enteritidis further augmented the superoxide release in association with the induction of Noxl protein. Ilae enhanced superoxide production by co-transfection of p41 ~' and p51 ~x vectors further ~gmented the rFbC-stimuIated IL-8 release from T84 cells. T84 cells expressed the Tolllike receptor 5, and rFliC rapidly phosphorylated transforming growth factor-B-activated Idnase 1 (TAK1) and TAK1 binding protein 1 (TAB1). A potent inhibitor for NF-KB (pyrrofidine dithiocarbamate) significantly blocked the rFliC-primed increase in superoxide produclion and induction of Noxl protein. These results suggest that p41 ~' and p51 ~ are involved in the Noxl activation in surface mucous cells of the colon, and besides that epithelial cells discern pathogenecities among bacteria to appropriately operate Noxl for the host defense. On the other hand, probiotics such as VSL3 have been reported to have in vitro antiinflammatory effects. However, whether other mucosal bacteria such as F. varium cause inflammation of the intestinal mucosa has not been determined. Methods: Human colonic epithelial cells (Caco-2) were cocultured with mucosal bacteria isolated from UC (19 species), and probiotics (4 species). Cell cultures were infected with bacteria and resuspended in MEM containing 10% FBS at a bacterium/cell ratio of 100:1, and further incubated for 2 h to allow bacterial entry to occur. After removal of the extracellular bacteria, the cultures were incubated for 4 h in the presence of 50t~g/mL of imipenem to kill the remaining extracelhilar bacteria. Subsequently, the supematants were removed and the cells were lysed with 0.1% SDS in saline, and the number of viable bacteria released was determined by culturing for 3 days on agar plates. The 1L-8 and IL-6 concentrations in the supematants were determined with ELISA kits. Results: Mucosal bacteria, which included F. vanum, Eubacterium aerofaciens, E. colt, Enterococcus feacium, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Streptococcus sanguis, were recovered from Caco-2 cells at 0.6-8x104 CFU/mL. No other bacteria, including probiotic strains (L delbrueckii subsp, bulgaricus, Str. thermophilus, L. gasseri, B. longum) entered the Caco-2 cells. IL-8 concentrations after exposure to all bacteria strains were below 16 pg/mL. In contrast, the mean IL-6 concentration after exposure to F. varium was at highest level, 3.37 pg/mL. The IL-6 concentrations after exposure to B. vulgatus, St. epidermidis, Eubacteriam lentum, Eubacterium aerofaciens, and Sir. sanguis were 2.65, 1.43, 1.42, 0.938, arid 0.985, respectively. However, IL-6 concentrations after exposure to the probiotics were below 0.45 pg/mL. Conclusion: Probiotics did not invade the colonic epithelial ceils and induce IL-6 secretion in the cells. On the other hand, some mucosal bacteria, especially F. varium, isolated from UC invaded colonic epithelial cells and induced IL-6 secretion. Background: GITR is a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor family induced by dexamethasone in murine T ceils. This molecule is also known to be highly expressed on CD4+ CD25+ T cells and to be involved in their regulatory function. CD4+ CD25+ T cells also express membrane-bound TGF-B, which might mediate suppression through cellcell contact. The expression of GITR and membrane-bound TGF-B is characteristic of marine CD4 + CD25 + T cells. Aim: In the present study, we sought to determine whether human CD4 + CD25 + ceils also express GITR and membrane-bound TGF-B as well as murine CD4+ CD25+ cells. Next we sought to analyze the difference between CD4+ CD25+ ceils in the patient with IBD and that in healthy volunteer. Methods: Peripheral blood lymphocytes were obtained from ulcerative colitis (UC) (n=43), Crohn's disease (CD) (n=43) and healthy volunteers (control) (n=43) by centrifugation of fresh blood over F/coil Paque. For cytometric analysis, 106 cells were stained with approximately diluted antibody. Antibodies included CD4-FITC, CD4-PerCP, CD25-PE, HLADR-PE @harM ngen), anti-human GITR (GENZYME-TECHNE) and anti-human LAP (TGF_B1 / (R&D system). Results: The expression of GITR was significantly higher on CD4+ CD25+ cells from controls than that on CD4+ CD25-ceils (41.8+/-10.0 % of CD4+ CD25+ cells were GITR positive, while 11A +/-7.5 % of CD4 + CD25-cells were GITR positive/. Sire arly, membrane-bound TGF-~ 1 were expressed at higher level on CD4 + CD25 + cells than that on CD4 + CD25-ceils (48 +/-49%, I 0 +/-i 5%, respectively:). There were no significant differences between UC, CD and control in CD4+ CD25+/CD4+ ratio (16.2+/-6.5%, 20,2 +/-8.0, 18.2 +/-8.7, respectively), CD4 + CD25 + GITR+/CD4+ CD25 + ratio (40.5 +/-9.7, 47.2 +/-14,0, 41 8+/d0.0, respectively) and CD4 + CD25 + TGF_B1 +/ CD4 + CD25 + ratio (5.4 +/-4.0, 6.5 +/-4.4, 4.8 +/-4.9, respectively). However, there was significant difference between active UC and inactive UC in CD4+ CD25 + TGF-B1 +/ CD4 + CD25 + ratio (2.9 +/-3.1, 7.0 +/-3 8, respectively). Conclusion: 1. Human CD4 + CD25 + cells also express GITR and membrane-bound TGF-B1 as well as murine CD4 + CD25 + cells. 2. The number of CD4 + CD25 + cells expressed TGP ]31 was significantly increased in patients with inactive UC compared with active UC. 3. TGF-[$1 may be involved in induction or sustain of remission in UC.",

To investigate the impact of SOCS-6 on the intestinal mucosal immune response, we induced a moderate dextran sodium sulphate (DSS) colitis in constitutively SOCS-6 overexpressing mice. Typical symptoms of colitis, such as loose stools, rectal blood loss, and loss of body weight, were apparent in the SOCS-6 transgenic mice (n = 13) as early as 3 days after DSS administration. In their wild type littermates (n = I2), symptoms were first observed at day 6. As a result, SOCS-6 transgenic animals had lost significantly more body weight (12.5 \u00b1 3.4%) at the end of the experiment (day 8) than the wild type mice (5.5 + 2.3%, P < 0.05). Subsequent histopathological assessment of tissue injury in inflamed proximal and distal colonic areas did not reveal gross differences between SOCS-6 transgenic and wild type mice. However, immunohistochemical analysis of these areas showed an increased number of lamina propria CD3 + T lymphocytes in the SOCS-6 transgenics. In addition, colonic TNFA mRNA levels in transgenic mice were significantly increased.

Wl077 lnterleukin-23, a Novel 1L-12-1ike Cytokine with Thl Properties, is Upregulated in the Inflamed Intestinal Mucosa of Patients with 1BD Paul Guarino, Muhammadzeza A. Sachedina, Sharon Hoang, Margarita Mishina, Giorgos Bamias, Brian K Reuter, Fabio Cominelfi, Theresa T. Pizarro BACKGROUND: Intarleukin-23 (IL-23) is a novel heterodimeric cytokine (p40/p19) related to lk-12 that shares the p40 subunit with IL-12 (p40/p35), as well as the ability to induce Th 1 mediated immune responses. Preferential expression of IL-23 has been recently reported in the normal mouse gastrointestinal tract by ileal dendritic cells, implicating the potential role for IL-23 in the site-specific manifestation of Crohn's disease (CD), a prototypic Thlmediated inflammatory disorder. AIMS: To determine the relative expression and cellular localization of IL-23 in the intestinal mucosa of patients with IBD and non-inflamed controls. METHODS: Involved (Inv) and non-involved (N-inv) intestinal mucosal biopsies from patients with CD and ulcerative colitis (UC), as well as non-inflamed tissue from controls (CONT), were processed for total cellular RNA, reversed transcribed, and resulting cDNAs analyzed by real time PCR (RT-PCR) for P19 transcript levels using sequence-specific probes and primers for human IL-23 P19; results were normalized to 18S RNA. Cellular localization of IL-23 was determined by immunohistochemistry, utilizing a recombinant human IL-23 receptor/human IgG Fc chimera as a primary detecting antibody. RESULTS: IL-23 P19 mRNA levds were significantly increased by 5.5-fold in CD lnv and 4.7-fold in UC Inv compared to CONT lp<0.005). Although increased levels of P19 mRNA were detected in CD Inv compared to UC lnv (1.8-fold increase) and CD N-Inv compared to CONT (2.4fold), these trends did not reach statistical significance. There was no statistically significant difference between IL-23 P19 transcript levels in UC N-Inv versus CONT tissues. In addition, P19 protein was localized to lamina propria mononuclear cells, that are morphologically consistent with tissue histiocytes (macrophages) in inflamed ileal tissues from CD patients. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, these studies indicate IL-23 is present at higher levels in inflamed tissues in patients with CD, as compared to non-inflamed and non-CD patient tissues. Given the ability of IL-23 to elicit Thl immune responses in memory T-cells, and its localization in the lamina propria of affected tissues, these data suggest IL-23 may play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of chronic intestinal inflammation, characteristic of CD.",

In humans, two variant IL-10R1 alleles, the SNP4 (G330R, on the cytoplasmic domain) only and the SNP3 (S138G, on the extracellular domain) + SNP4 allele, are present in about 50% of Caucasians and protect from UC. Previously, our lab showed that monocytes from individuals carrying these IL-10R1 variants are less sensitive to IL-10-mediated inhibition of TNF-ot production in vitro (] [ramunol 2003) . In this study we further elucidated the molecular basis of the functional differences of these IL-10R1 SNPs. Methods: The coding sequence of the IL-10RI cDNA was obtained from different individuals by 5'RACE Three common haplotypes (wildtype. SNP4 only, and SNP3 + 4) and the EGFP gene (as control) were cloned into pIRESpuro3 resulting in pIRESpuro3-R1, plRESpuro3-R4, plRESpuro3-R7, and pIRESpuro3-EGFP. Constructs were transfected into Ba/F3 (a mouse pro B-cell line that does not carry IL-10R1) and selected with puromycin. Each Ba/F3 clone (Ba/F3-Rwt, Ba/F3-R4, Ba/F3-R7 or Ba/F3-EGFP) was checked for expression of the construct by flow cytometry and Western blot. IL-10 induced proliferation was tested by MTT-assay with and without the addition of Ik-3. Results: Stable clones were grown for 24 and 48 hours in 96-well plates with various concentrations of IL-10. Ik-10 induced moderate proliferation within 24 hours in Ba/F3-Rwt, 5 to 10-fold less in Ba/F3-R7 and none in Ba/F3-R4 or Ba/F3-EGFP clones (figure). This effect was consistent within a 48 hours proliferation period, but was overruled by IL-3-induced proIiferation. No cumulative effect was seen with suboptimal IL-3 concentrations. Conclusion: These data indicate that the exchange of glycin 330 to arginine (SNP4) at the cytoplasmic domain of the human IL-10R1 renders Ba/F3 ceils unresponsive to IL-l0. The simultaneous presence of the SNP3 variant partially counteracts this effect by a yet poorly understood mechanism. Background: IL-17R mediates NF-KB activation in response to IL-17, a proinflammatory cytokine expressed by TCRa/~' CD4 CD8-thymocytes, activated CD4 + and CD4 \u00f7 CD45RO\u00f7 memory T cells. Although IL-17 has been implicated in IBD, regulation of its receptor system remains unclear. Method: Human IL-17R splice variant expression was assessed in the intestinal mucosa of Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and control patients by RT-PCR. Intracellular receptor trafficking, secretion and signal transduction was assessed using full length and mutant GFp. or Flag-tagged IL-17R and sIk-17R expression constructs in NIH3T3, Caco-2 cells and cell lines lacking full length IL-17R expression. Confocal microscopy was utilized to characterize activation dependent membrane and compartment association. Result: IL-I7R is encoded by 13 exons stretching over 26,330 bp on chromosome 22q11.1. During cloning of the human IL-17R we observed potential splice variants lacking the transmembrane domain encoded by exon 11. Analysis of inflamed and non-inflamed intestinal tissue mRNA confirmed the expression of an sIL-17R, which contains the complete extracellular IL-17 binding domain and the cytoplasmic tail lacking only 21 AA encoded by exon ii. Both IL-17R isoforms are concomitantly expressed in most tissues in similar ratios. However, while IL-17R mRNA expression was upregulated 10-20-fold in Crohn's disease when compared to normal controls, the splice variant appeared to be constitutively expressed. Furthermore, the ratio between IL-17R and sIL-17R mRNA expression varied between different intestinal and hematopoetic cell lines, corresponding to their I L-17 responsiveness. The lack of the transmembrane domain resulted in a distinct vesicular sorting of both IL-17R isoforms. IL-17R was integrated and enriched in cell surface membranes and rapidly translocated into early endosomal compartments upon 1L-17 stimulation. In contrast, slL-17R was only observed in the Golgi network and secretory vesicles. Minimal overlap of IL-17R and sIL-17R containing compartments indicate an early differential cellular targeting of both receptor isoforms. Consequently, slL-17R but not IL-17R could be isolated from cell supematants. Conclusion: The discovery of a soluble IL-17R demonstrates that the IL-17R signaling system includes at least one additional secreted regulator. Differential control of IL-17R mRNA splicing may be responsible for modulating adaptive responses through this ubiquously expressed cytokine receptor system.",

            "text": "Background: Heine oxygenases (HOs) are the rate-limiting enzymes in heine degradation, catalyzing the cleavage of the heine ring to form carbon monoxide (CO), ferrous iron and biliverdin. Three HO isoforms have been identified, one of which, HO-1 play a protective role in the process of inflammation. The present study investigated the possible role of HO-1 in the regulation of inflammatory process using a dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-induced colitis in mice. Materials and methods: Acute colitis was induced with DSS in male BALB/ c mice. A disease activity index (DAD was determined on a daily basis for each animal, and consists of a calculated score based on changes in body weight, stool consistency, and intestinal bleeding. HO-1/HO-2 rnRNA and protein expression were determined by western blot and RT-PCR at different points after DSS induction. Colonic mRNA expression for proand anti-inflammatory eytokines (TNF-a, IFN-g, IL-4, and IL-10) were determined by ELISA and RT-PCR. The mRNA expression of CCR5 (Thl marker) and CCR4 (Th2 marker) was also measured. Moreover we evaluated the enhancement by treatment of an HO-1 inhibitor, zinc protoporphyrin IX (ZnPP 25mg/kg i.p., daily). Results: After DSS administration, DAI score and expression of HO-1 mRNA and protein were increased in a time-dependent manner. Expression of TNF-a, IFN-g, IL-4, IL-10, CCR4, and CCR5 mRNA were increased after DSS administration. CCR5 expression was more enhanced during DSS administration compared to CCR4 expression. Co-administration with ZnPP enhanced the increase in DAI score. The increases in the expression of TNF-a, IFN-g, CCR4, and CCR5 were enhanced in ZnPP-treated group, and dominance of CCR5 expression was also enhanced. In contrast, the increases in the expression of IL-4 and IL-IO were inhibited in ZnPP-treated group. Conclusion: These results indicate that HO-1 plays a protective role in the intestinal mucosal injury induced by DSS. These effects probably result from the regulation of Thl/Th2 cytokine balance in intestinal tissues. Introduction: Ulcerative colitis (UC) is characterized by a Th2 immune response leading to mucosaI inflammation and epithelial barrier dysfunction. However, typical Th2 cytokines as IL-4 or 1L-10 do not affect the intestinal barrier. Recently we have identified IL-13 to be the key Tb2 cytokine in oxazalon-cofitis, a mouse model for UC The present study aimed to characterize the role of IL-13 for epithelial barrier function in UC. Methods: Lymphocytes were isolated from biopsies of UC patients and IL-13 production was measured by EL1SA. HT-29/B6 monolayers were used as cell culture model to study the effects of 1L-13. Barrier function was investigated by measuring resistance with the Ussing-tecbnique. Tight junction proteins were quantified in immunohlots densi-tometrically. Epithelial apoptosis was detected by TUNEL staining. Epithelial restitution was assessed in HT-29/B6 monolayers as the closure \u2022 ~locity of a 200 um defect. Results: In UC lymphocytes, IL-13 release was higher than in e.ontrol (p=0,001). In HT-29/B6 cells, IL-13 (lOng/ml) decreased Rt from 512Ohm+-29 to 317Ohm +-36 Ohmxcm2 after 48h. In parallel, apoptotic ratio was upregulated by IL-13 from 1.0 + -0.5% to 5.6 + -0.9% (p<0.001), while interferon-g had no effect. The poreforming tight junction protein claudin-2 was increased by IL-13 to 295 +-37% of control (p<O.O01). In wound healing assays, repair velocity was reduced by IL-13 from 15 +-1 to I-1 um/h (<0.001). Finally, UC mucosa was studied. Similar alterations were observed as in HT-29/B6 cells exposed to IL-13, namely an increase in claudin-2 expression and in epithelial apoptotic ratio. Conclusion: IL-13 is the key Th2 cytokine in ulcerative colitis thc, t induces epithelial bamer dysfunction by affecting epithelial tight junctions, epithelial apoptosis and epithelial restitution.",

The nuclear transcription factor ppARgamma (PPARg) is highly expressed in normal and Crohn's Disease intestinal epithelium, and activation of this receptor has been demonstrated to reduce general inflammation in murine colitis models. However, little is known regarding the specific effects of PPARg activation on intestinal T cell migration. We tested whether PPARg activation reduces secretion of Thl-associated chemokines from intestinal epithelium, and whether this reduction is associated with reduced T cell migration during colitis. Methods: The effects of 4 specific TZDs (PPARg agonists: rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, MCC-555, and RO2060297) on chemokine levels were measured in vitro and in vivo. For the in vitro experiments, HT-29 intestinal epithelial cells were pre-incubated with varying levels of agonist, followed by addition of IFNg or TNFa for 8 hours. Chemokine RNA and protein levels were then measured by QPCR and ELISA. For the colitis experiments, C57/B16 mice were given acute dextran sodium sulfate (DSS)-mediated colitis, with or without pretreatment with pioglitazone. On day 7, chemokine levels in the colon and number of colonic T cells were measured by quantitative PCR, ELISA, and immunohistochemistry. In another set of experiments, 5E5 splenocytes from congeinc CD45.1 expressing mice that had been given DSS 7 days earlier were injected intraperitoneally into mice given colitis 4 days previously.

Wittig, Martin Zeitz, George Ku, John Randle, Britta Siegmund Introduction: has been demonstrated to be up-regulated in lesions of patients with Crohn's disease, but not in ulcerative colitis. 1L-18 is expressed constitutively as an inactive precursor which is cleaved and thereby activated by the interleukin-l[3 converting enzyme (ICE). We demonstrated previously that ICE KO mice are protected from acute and chronic DSS-induced colitis (PNAS 2001 (PNAS ,98:1329 . Since IL-18 is acting in strong synergism with II.-12 in IFN\"/induction, we hypothesized that inhibition of ICE would also offer protection in other colitis models. Methods: Trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis and oxazolone-induced colitis models were employed and mice were treated bid with pralnacasan via oral garage starting at initiation of colitis. Mortality, weight loss and histologic score were evaluated. At the end of experiment, colon culture was performed for cytokine evaluation as well as analysis for apoptosis of the lamina propria lymphocytes (LPL) by flow cytometry. Results: In vehicle-treated WT mice, 70% mortality was observed after colitis induction by TNBS, while only 20% of pralnacasan-treated (100 mg/kg) mice died. In addition, pralnacasan treatment prevented weight loss and the histological signs of inflammati on were significantly reduced when compared to the vehicle-treated group (3.0+0.6 vs. 5.2+0.2, p<0.O1; 0 = no inflammation, 6 = maximum disease). Consistent with this reduced macroscopic and histologic disease severity, IFN~/and 1L-6 concentrations were markedly suppressed in the Supernatant of total colon culture in pralnacasan-treated animals, while the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokiue 1L-10 remained unchanged. TNBS-induced colitis was associated with a 15% decrease in apoptosis of LPL in vehicle-treated WT mice. In contrast, LPL from pralnacasan-treated TNBS-exposed mice presented with an apoptotic rate similar to the one detected in healthy control mice. In oxazolone-induced colitis, pralnacasan (1.6-100 mg/kg p.o.) treatment reduced the colonic tissue content of IL-I~ and IL-18 dose-dependently. Summary: Inhibition of ICE by the specific inhibitor pralnacasan, currently in phase 1I for rheumatoid arthritis, protects from Thl-as well as from Th2-mediated colitis and provides therefore an interesting target for human disease. Background: Hydroxy-eicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) are important paracrine signaling modulators in cancer and inflammation. HETEs synergistically enhance Ik-la-induced COX-2 expression in human colonic myofibroblasts (CMF). IL-Ia induces COX-2 transcription via ERK and p38 activation and PKCz (zeta)-mediated ROS generation, p38 activation also enhances COX-2 mRNA stability. The aim of this study was to determine how HETEs enhance COX-2 expression. Methods: CMF were treated with IL-la (500 pg/ml), HETBs (10 raM) or both. Protein was isolated and subjected to Western blot analysis for COX-2, ERK and p38 analysis and immunoprecipitation/kinase assays for PKCz activity, mRNA stability was assessed by adding DRB (50 raM) 4 h after IL-la addition, and then subjecting RNA isolated at various times to Northern blot analysis. Single cell ROS generation was determined by DCF fluorescence. Results: 5(S), 12(R) and 15(S)-HETEs enhanced IL-1mediated COX-2 expression 3.6 + 0.5 fold, yet did not affect COX-2 expression on their own. The primary effect was at the level of message stability although a modest (2 fold) transcriptional enhancement was seen. HETEs did not affect ERK or PKCz activity, but did increase p38 activity for 2 hours compared to IL-1 alone. HETE alone induced ROS generation (2.06 + 0.18 fold) and the combination of HETEs and IL-1 significantly increased ROS compared to IL-I alone (2.79 + 0.45 vs 1.78 _% 0.08, respectively). H202 (100-200 raM) also enhanced COX-2 expression and antioxidants (DPI and NDGA) blocked the effect of HETEs. Conclusions: Our data demonstrate that HETEs enhance COX-2 expression in CMF via enhanced ROS generation, resulting in increased message stability with only a shortterm (2 hour) enhancement of p38 activity. HETE-induced ROS did not involve increased PKCz activity, suggesting a different mechanism of ROS generation than IL-la. These results demonstrate that depending on their source, ROS can affect COX-2 expression at both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. These studies were supported by the N1DDK and the Gulf Coast DDC.",

Recent studies demonstrated that PGs may play important roles in the prevention of intestinal mucosal inflammation through membrane receptor (PGE receptor) and/or the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor y (a nuclear PG receptor, PPAR~/) (J. Clin. Invest. 109: 883, 2002 , Gastro. 124: 1265 , 2003 . In the present study, to determine the targets and roles of PGs in ulcerative colitis (UC), we examined the localization of COX-2 and the effect of PGs on HGF and VEGF production by macrophages and colonic flbroblasts. Methods: Three each specimens of human UC were immunostained with specific antibodies against COX-2, macrophages (CD68), and myofibroblasts 0x-SMA). PMA-differentiated U937 cells were used as a human macrophage model (H-Mac). Human colonic fibroblasts were obtained from a resected colon at surgery and cultured in F-12 medium with 10% fetal bovine serum. PGE~ (an agonist of PGE receptor) and 15-deoxy-A 12' 14-PGJ2 (an agonist of PPAR% 15d-PGJ2) were used. HGF, VEGF and cAMP were measured by E1A. mRNA expressions of PG receptors in these cells were assessed by RT-PCR. Results: Immunoreactive COX-2 was predominantly and strongly expressed in interstitial cells located around microvessels of severely inflamed area. The staining patterns of macrophages and myofibroblasts were similar to that observed for COX-2 in UC. mRNAs of EP2 and EP4 PGE receptors were expressed in H-Mac and colonic fibroblasts. In H-Mac, PGE~ dramatically increased VEGF production and significantly increased cAMP formation. 8-bromo-cAMP (membrane-permeable form of cAMP) and cholera toxin (a cAMP elevating agent) also significantly increased VEGF production. 15d-PGJ2 dramatically increased VEGF production, but not cAMP formation. In fibroblasts, PGE1 dramatically increased HGF and VEGF production and significantly increased cAMP formation. 8-bromo-cAMP and cholera toxin also significantly increased HGF and VEGF production 15d-PGJ2 did not increase HGF and VEGF production. Conclusion: These results suggest that PG-growth factor pathway through membrane receptor-mediated process may have a defensive role in human UC. Further studies are required to establish the role of PPARy in this area. Background: The mesenteric adipose tissue hypertrophy such as fat wrapping is one of the characteristics of Crohn's disease (CD). This finding suggests that adipocytes or their secreted specific proteins could play a functional role in the pathogenesis of CD. Adiponectin is an adipocyte-specific secretory protein that was identified by our group in human adipose tissues. Adiponectin belongs to the family of proteins that includes C l q. It has been reported that adiponectin may have anti-inflammatory properties, and especially in macrophages, it may suppress their phagocytic activity and TNFaproduction. Therefore we investigated the adiponectin expression in the mesenteric adipose tissue contiguous to the intestine of CD. Method: The mesenteric adipose tissue specimens were obtained from CD patients (n = 19), ulcerative colitis (UC) patients (n = 8), and controls (n = 28) undergoing intestinal resection. Immunohistochemistry for CD68, CD3, CD20 and adiponectin was performed. Adiponectin concentrations in tissue homogenates and adiponectin release in vitro short-term culture were determined by ELISA. Adiponectin mRNA concentrations in tissue homogenates were determined by competitive RT-PCR. Moreover, the associations between adiponectin concentrations and laboratory data were investigated. Result: Adiponectin concentrations in the mesenteric adipose tissues contiguous to involved intestine of CD patients and adiponectin release from them were significantly higher than those in the mesenteric adipose tissue contiguous to healthy intestine of CD patients (p<0.01, p<0.05, respectively), the intestine of UC patients (p<0.01, p<0.01), and the intestine of controls (p<0.01, p<0.01). A 2fold increase in adiponectin mRNA levels was found in the mesenteric adipose tissues contiguous to involved intestines of CD patients compared to those to healthy intestines of CD patients (p<0.05). Furthermore, adiponectin concentrations in the mesenteric adipose tissue contiguous to involved intestine were inversely correlated with serum CRP levels of CD patients (r-0.58, P<0.01). Conclusion: These results suggest that adipocytes in the hypertrophied mesenteric adipose tissue such as fat wrapping produce and secrete a lot of adiponectin, and it may regulate the inflammatory reaction in CD.",

Chang, Keri Kles, Ken Drabik, Didier Merlin, Eugene B. Chang Background ~r Aims: hPepT1, a di/tripeptide transporter of intestinal epithelial cells, is most highly expressed in the small intestine and minimally expressed in the colon. In states of chronic colonic inflammation, hPepT1 expression is upregulated in colonic epithelial cells in contrast to other transport-and barrier-related proteins that are dowrtregulated. Interferon-3' (IFN-'y) is one cytokine, which stimulates hPepT1 activity and appears to be a potential mediator of increased hPepT1 expression in chronic inflammation. In low doses (O-5ng/ ml), IFN-3' is known to increase hPepT1 activity in Caco2/bbe (C2) cells in the absence of increased hPepT1 protein expression. In this study, we examine the potential role of different cytokines in mediating inflammation-associated increases in hPepT1 activity and expression. Methods: C2 cells grown on collagen<oated transwells were treated with IFN-3', TNF-c~, I1_-113, IL-2, IL-8, and IL-10. In C2 cells, hPepT1 function was determined by measurement of [JH]glycosylsarcosine transport (a classical hPeptl substrate) and protein was determined in total and biotinylated samples (representing apical hPepT1) by Western blot. Results: Basolateral treatment of C2 cells with IFN-3' and TNF-a (concentration 50ng/ml) for 2 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours revealed an upregulated hPepT1 protein in total and biotinylated portions. At early time points (2hours), apical but not total hPepT1 expression is increased, paralleling changes in activity. At later time points (24hours and 48hours) further increase in activity were observed with correlate in induction of hPepT1 expression at the apical membrane and increased total hPepT1 expression. Concentrations of O-100ng/ml of IFN-3' and TNF-a showed a concentration-dependent upregnlation of hPepTf in total and biotinylated samples (detectable at concentrations > 10ng/ml) at 48 hours. Other cytokines like IL-113, IL-2, IL-8, and IL-f0 failed to increase hPepTf function or hPepTf expression. Conclusions: Interferon-3' and TNF-cl are two important cytokines, which may modulate intestinal inflammation and upregulate hPepT1 activity and protein in C2 cells. This increased hPepT1 expression may be responsible for enhanced expression of hPepT1 function and expression in chronically inflamed colonic mucosa.",

Methods: We established a colon endothelial cell line (MJC-1), from 'Immortomouse' mice expressing a temperature-sensitive SV40 large T antigen (H-2Kb-tsA58 mice; ImmortoMice). MAdCAM-1 expression in MJC-1 cells was examined in response to TNF-c~, IL-I~ and IFN-y and the signal pathways involved in MAdCAM-1 expression examined using signal blockers for: proteasomes (MG-132), PARE (GPI-6150), tyrosine kinase (genistein), MAP kinases (PD-98059, SB-202190), PKC (Go-6976), and PKG (KT-5823). We also examined lymphocyte-endothelial adhesion using TK-1 cells (which express ~x4 [~7) with and without saturating levels of anti-MAdCAM-1 mAb. Results: TNF-~x induced MAdCAM-1 dose-dependently at time points >24h, MAdCAM-1 induction was PKC, tyrosine kinase, p38 MAPK, NF-KB/PARP dependent. IL-I[~ and IFNy did not induce MAdCAM-1 expression. Lymphocyte endothelial adhesion was increased -2.6-fold after TNF-c~, and was significantly inhibited by anti-MAdCAM-1 antibody (P < 0.05 vs. TNF-c~ treatment). Conclusion: MAdCAM-1 expression in response to cytokines is thought to be an important event in IBD, and MAdCAM-1 is induced on colonic endothelial cells after TNF-a where it acts as a determinant of lymphocyte recruitment, therefore this system may provide a useful model of some forms of IBD in vitro.",

            "text": "Deficiency of NK and CD1D Specific Valpha24+ NK T-Cells in Crohn's Disease and Ulcerative Colitis Randall H. Grose, Adrian Cummins, Fiona Thompson A subset of immunoregnlatory T-cells have the surface pfienotype of Va24 V~11. Va24+ VIJll + T-cells are predominantly CD161 + NK cells and are CDld restricted. Va24+ Tcells are deficient in a autoimmune disorders. The aim of this study was to investigate whether regulatory Vc~24 + T-cells are deficient in Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis. Blood was collected for flow cytometry from subjects with Crobn's disease (n = 97), ulcerative colitis (n = 68) and control subjects (n= 152). Numbers of circulating CD56 +, CD57 +, CD94 +, CD 161 + NK cells and Vcd4 +, V[311 +, and IFN production was measured after in vitro anti-CD3 antibody stimulation. Relative duplex PCR from ileal or colonic biopsy samples was used to determine Vex24 mRNA expression. CD56 +. CD57 +, CD94 +, CD161 + NK cells were reduced to 38%, 70%, 55% and 47% in Crohn's disease of levels in normal controls. Similarly, CD56+, CD57 +, CD94 +, CD161 + NK cells were reduced to 56%, 73%, 59% and 67% in ulcerative colitis subjects. V~x24 +, Va24 + CD4 +, Vc~24 + V[311 + T-cells and CD161 + Va24 + NR T-cells were reduced to 34%, 45%, 21% and 25 %, of levels in normal controls, respectively, in Crohds disease. The V~x24+ V[311+ and Va24+ V[311 + (x-galactosylceramide/CDld+ T-cells were 21% and 0.3% in Crohn's and 15% and 7% in ulcerative colitis compared to normal control subjects. IL-4 and IFN-3' production by Vc~24+ T-cells were defective. Intestinal Vc~24 mRNA expression from Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis was 15 % and 29%, respectively, of levels in normal subjects, We conclude that NK cells are deficient in Crohn's disease and in ulcerative colitis. V(x24 + T-cells are deficient and functionally defective in Crohn's disease, and are selectively and mucosally deficient in ulcerative colitis. Vc~24+ Vl311+ and Vc~24+ V[311+ c.galactosylceramide/CDld tetramer+ cells are deficient in both Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. This decrease in immunoregnlatory ceils may contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD. The clinical benefit of OPC-6535 in active ulcerative colitis patients was demonstrated in a recent phase 2 trial. In the present study, the pharmacological effects of OPC-6535 on tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) production in [eukocytes in vitro and in vivo were evaluated. METHODS: 1) Whole blood: Aliquots of hepariinzed human and porcine whole blood were incubated with or without various concentrations of OPC-6535 for 30 min at room temperature and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) was added. After incubation for 24 hr at 37\u00b0C, culture supernatant was collected for ELISA. 2) Isolated peripheral blood monocytes: Human and porcine monocytes were isolated under sterile conditions from whole blood using dextran sedimentation followed by Ficoll-Hypaque centrifugation and adhesion to the wells of a culture plate. Monocytes were either treated with various concentrations of OPC-6535 for 30 rain at 37\u00b0C or left untreated, and then stimulated with LPS. After incubation for 24 hr (human monocytes) or 4 hr (porcine monocytes) at 37\u00b0C, the culture supernatant was collected for ELISA. 3) In vivo porcine endotoxemia model: Anesthetized pigs received a 15-rain IV infusion of OPC-6535 (30 or 60 /.~g/kg/min) or vehicle prior to 60-rain LPS infusion (0.1 ~g/kg/hr). Plasma samples collected at several time points were used for ELISA. RESULTS: Without OPC-6535, LPS stimulated TNF-a production in all in vitro experiments except for porcine whole blood. In both human whole blood and isolated human monocytes, OFC-6535 inhibited TNF-~x production in a concentration-dependent manner (IC50:l0 and 2.4 ~M, respectively). OPC-6535 also inhibited TNF-u production in porcine monocytes (ICs0:14/xM). In the in vivo model, a transient increase in plasma TNF-c\u00a2 level was observed, peaking at 90 min after LPS infusion. Pretreatment with OPC-6535 suppressed the increase in plasma TNF-a level in a dose-related manner, and at 60 ~g/kg/min significantly suppressed the increase compared with the vehicle control group. CONCLUSION: OPC-6535 inhibits TNF-a production by monocytes. This inhibitory effect is demonstrable both in vitro and in vivo. FKN is an endothelial cell surface chemokine that mediates leukocyte adhesion through a unique receptor (FKN-R). We investigated the potential role of FKN in IBD by assessing its production and function in Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). FKN expression by resting and activated control and IBD human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells (HIMEC) was studied by flow cytometry and western blotting. Secretion of soluble FKN was measured by ELISA in HIMEC supematants, and FKN-R expression assessed by flow cytometry in peripheral blood T-cells from CD, UC, and controls, as well as T-cell lines. The role of FKN in leukocyte-HlMEC adhesion was investigated by antibody blockade. Both control and IBD unstimulated HIMEC displayed low (<3%) FKN expression which was moderately upregulated by 1FN-y, TNF-a, and IL-lJJ. However, the combination of TNFa, and IFN-y reduced a marked synergistic effect, which was significantly (p<0.01) stronger for CD (70%) and UC (58%) than control HIMEC (26%). Contact with Jurkat T-cells also upregnlated FKN expression by 40%, an increase which was significantly (p<0.05) higher in CD and UC than control HIMEC. FKN secretion paralleled HIMEC surface expression, CD and UC producing significantly (p<0.04) more than controls. FKN-R expression was significantly (p<0.01) higher in CDJ+, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells from active CD and UC patients than those with inactive disease or controls. Adhesion of Jurkat cells to CD and UC HIMEC was significantly (p<0.05) higher than control HIMEC, and FKN blockade substantially (26%) decreased adhesion. Interestingly, FKN blockade resulted in a greater inhibition of VCAM-l-mediated adhesion (61%) than that induced by VCAM-1 alone (39%). The combined enhancement of FKN production by the mucosal microvasculamre and the upregnlated expression of FKN-R by peripheral T-cells provides a possible explanation for the enhanced endothelial-T-cell adhesion in CD and UC, suggesting a specific mechanism of T-cell recruitment into the inflamed mucosa that contributes to IBD pathogenesis.",

The acute-phase response (APR) is a self-fimited phenomenon with the initiation of production of several negative-feedback factors such as the soluble cytokine-receptors (sCRs) (sIL1RI, slL1RI1, sTNFRI and sTNFRII). These sCRs are cytokine-scavengers and inhibit the binding of cytokines to their membrane receptors. There is a major exception for the slL6R which complex with IL6 and activates cellular gp130 subunit -driven signal transduction. However, the gpl30 soluble form prevents this interaction and inhibits the IL6 signalling pathway. Pharmacological blocking of TNFa offers a unique opportunity to understand TNFa-mediated offers regulation of sCRs, as compared to their modulation by steroids. Methods. We prospectively examined active CD patients (aCD) treated with lnfliximab (5 mg/kg, n=21) or with intravenous methyl-prednisolone (MP) (0.5 mg/kg, n= 10), patients with CD in clinical remission (rCD) (CDAI < 150 with normal CRP and w/o immunosuppressants) (n = 20), and healthy subjects (n = 15). The circulating levels of TNF~, sTNFRI, sTNFRII, ILlb, sIL1RI, slL1RII, 1L6, sIL6R and sgp130 were measured using quantitative sandwich enzyme immunoassay at baseline, 1 and 4 weeks after treatment. Results. Higher levels of sTNFRI (p<0.05, p<0.01), sTNFRII (p<0.O1, p<O.O1), sIL1R1 (p<0.01, p<0.05), IL6 (p<0.01, p<0,01) and slL6R (p<O,01, NS) were observed in aCD when compared to rCD and healthy subjects. Importantly, the soluble decoy receptor, slL1RII ((10211pg/ml [6270-23995] vs 16007 [9854-25506] p<O.05 and 19944 [14537-28505] p<0.01)) and sgpl30 (p<O.O1, p<0.01) were decreased in aCD when compared to rCD and healthy subjects, emphasizing a deficient production of these two important anti-inflammatory sSRs in aCD. Infliximab and MP induced a significant decrease of CDAI (p<O.05), CRP (p<0.01 ) and IL6 (p<0.05) already at 1 and 4 weeks. Interestingly, lnfliximab induced a significant decrease of sTNFRII at 1 and 4 weeks (p<O.05), and surprisingly enhanced the expression of slL6R at 1 week (p<O.05). Inversely, MP clearly increased sIL1RI at 4 weeks and sIL1RII at 1 week (p<0,05 and p<O,05 respectively). Conclusion. Different profiles of sCRs production were observed in aCD and rCD. Induction therapies, such as tnfliximab and steroids, differently regulated these sCRs in aCD. BACKGROUND & AIM Active ulcerative colitis (UC) is associated with elevated peripheral blood granulocytes and monocytes/macrophages which show activation behaviour, produce pro-inflammatory cytokines and are resistant to apoptosis. Further, The level neutrophils in the mucosa parallels intestinal inflammation and can predict UC relapse. Accordingly, adsorptive granulocyte and monocyte apheresis (GMA) in patients with severe UC was associated with a dramatic and sustained clinical efficacy (Hanai H, et al., Clin Gastroenterol Hepatol 2003; 1:28-35) . However, the full efficacy of GMA did not appear to be due to the reduction of peripheral blood granulocytes and monocytes per se. METHODS We were interested to see if GMA changes the plasma levels of substances which might exert antiinflammatory effects. Forty-six patients with steroid dependent UC, mean CAI (clinical activity index) 9.2 and DAI (disease activity index) 8.6 were treated with GMA by using the Adacolumn which removes granulocytes, monocytes and a small fraction lymphocytes (Fcy and complement receptors bearing leukocytes). During the first treatment session, we measured plasma levels of IL-1 receptor antagonist (1L-ira), IL-10, soluble TNF-a receptors I and lI and L-selectin expression index on leukocytes at the inlet to the column and in the blood returning to the patients (column outflow). RESULTS In the column outflow, the levels of IL-lra, IL-10, TNF-a receptors I and II increased by 96% (P=O.O001), 322% (P=0.0001), 56\u00b0,6 (P=0.0001) and 51% (P=0.0001), respectively together with downmodulation of L selectin (P=0.0001). In the same test samples, TNF-a and IL-1B were virtually undetectable, lL-lra and 1L-10 are reported to have strong anti-inflammatory effects, while soluble TNF-c~ receptors are known to block the effect of TNF-c\u00a2 in viva. CONCLUSION The major sources of IL-lra, IL-IO, TNF-a receptors 1 and II are believed to be adsorbed rnonocytes and neutrophils to the column cames. These effects together with reduction of circulaung levels of granulocytes and monocytes should alleviate inflammation and promote remission of active UC. The results should increase understanding of the mechanisms of clinical efficacy associated with adsorptive granulocyte and monocyte apheresis. Introduction Clinical outcome in ulcerative colitis (UC) has been shown to correlate with in vitro measures of lymphocyte steroid sensitivity (LSS). Small studies implicated IL-2 and 11--4 overproduction in steroid resistance, and we reported a beneficial effect of anti-IL-2 receptor treatment (anti-CD25) upon steroid resistance in UC. Here we aim to study the relationship between in vitro LSS and the production of IL-2 and other cytokines by lymphocytes in a larger study. Methods Peripheral blood lymphocytes from 27 healthy volunteers were isolated. LSS was assessed by measuring the antiproliferative effect of dexamethasone (Dex) following stimulation by phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). Results are counts per minute (cpm) from the mean of triplicate cultures and presented as percentage inhibition at 10 6 mol/L Dex (1~ = cpm with PHA alone -cpm with Dex/cpm with PHA alone x 100%). Culture supematants 48hrs post PHA stimulation were assayed for IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-IO, TNF-a, and IFN-'y using flow cytometry/multiplexing bead array. Correlation was with Spearmans rho. Results Median Im~ was 80.7% (30.4 to 94.9). After PHA stimulation, median cytokine levels (pg/ml) in the absence of Dex were low for I]--2 = 10.6 (2.7 to 1279) and IL-4 = 10.5 (0 to 478), but high for 11.-5 = 94.1 (4.7 to 880), IL-10 = 1356 (243 to 5000), TNF-a = 437 (27 to 2628), and IFN-y = 4696 (208 to 21321) . There was a strong negative correlation between I~ and IL-10 (r-0.704'*), 1FN-'y (>0.48*), , and TNF-a (r-0.395\"), but none between I~ and levels of IL-2 (r-0.147, p = 0.47) or IL-4 (r-0.167, p = 0.41). IL-2 receptor blockade (basiliximab) resulted in a rise in median levels of IL-2 to 364.7 (46 to 1225), but decreased levels of lL-4, IL-5, 11_-10, TNF-a and IFN-'y. In the presence of basiliximab, steroid resistant individuals overproduced more IL-2, with a significant negative correlation between l~ and IL-2 levels (r-0.395\"). (*p<0.05, **p<0.01) Conclusions Lymphocyte steroid sensitivity does not correlate with 2I_-2 or IL-4 secretion in vitro , but is negatively correlated with production of IL-5, TNF-a, IFN-y and especially IL-10. We have previously shown that IL-2 receptor blockade improves LSS, thus the low levels of IL-2 present must play at least a permissive role in steroid resistance. Overproduction of other cytokines may account for variation in LSS and represent other targets for intervention. The excessive rise in IL-2 in the presence of anti-CD25 is further evidence of dysregnlated cytokine production in steroid resistant individuals.",

            "text": "Effect of Nicotine on Cytokine and Human l~-Defensin 2 (HBD2) Responses in an Organ Culture Model in IBD Marian C. Aldhous, Jack Satsangi Introduction The effects of smoking in IBD are now well established, but the mechanisms by which these occur are unknown, affecting innate or acquired immune responses. Cytokine dysregnlation is a feature of both CD and UC. Mucosal human ]3-defensin 2 (HBD2), which is produced by epithelial cells, may contribute to innate defence to micro-organisms and has been shown to be raised in UC. We investigated the effects of nicotine on spontaneous and LPS-induced cytokine and HBD2 production. Methods We used a 24 hour organ culture method to incubate colonic pinch biopsies, obtained at endoscopy, from patients with CD (n = 6), UC (n = 4) and controls (HC, n = 12) with differing concentrations of nicotine, LPS, and LPS + nicotine. Cytokines (ILl]3, IL2, ILl0, ILl2, TGP[3, TNFa) and HBD2 were measured in culture supernatants by commercial and in-honse ELISAs respectively. Results Significant differences in cytokine levels were obtained for IL2. Production of IL2 was highest in unstimulated biopsies from HC (median=2118 pg/ml) compared with CD (median = 739 pg/ml) or UC (median = 369 pg/ml). A similar pattern was seen with LPSstimulated biopsies (HC, median = 1906 pg/ml, CD, median = 632 pg/ml UC median = 524 pg/ml). Comparison of IL2 production from all stimulants across the disease groups gave a significant difference (p = 0.0463, 2-way ANOVA), although comparison of each stimulant in turn was not significant. There was no consistent pattern of IL2 production in response to nicotine alone in any disease group. However, on comparison of biopsies stimulated with LPS alone and LPS+nicotine from the same patients, an increase of >50pg/ml in IL2 production was seen in 5/5 CD, but only 1/4 UC and 4/11 HC (X 2 = 6.818, p = 0.033). HBD2 was highest in unstimulated biopsies from UC patients (median = 15.8 pg/ml) compared with CD (median = 9.6 pg/ml) or HC (median = 11.8 pg/ml) but did not quite reach significance, one-way ANOVA p = 0.0689. For HBD2, there was little change in response to any stimulant. Discussion HBD2 was increased in UC but levels were not affected by stimulation with nicotine and/or LPS. IL2 production was reduced in CD and UC compared with HC. While IL2 levels did not significantly change in response to nicotine alone, differential changes were seen when nicotine was combined with LPS. These changes in IL2 production may be enough to offset the finely tuned local inflammatory responses in the gut, and may underlie disease differences in response to smoking.",

            "text": "Soluble Galectin 3 Is a Strong Colonic Epithelial Cell (CEC) Derived Fibroblast Stimulating Factor Elisabeth Lippert, Werner Falk, Thflo Kaehne, Juergen Schoelmerich, Gerhard Rogler BACKGROUND: Intestinal fibroblasts (IF) play an important role in the pathogenesis of fibrosis and stenosis in Crohn's disease (CD). The'mechanism and factors which affect the activation of flbroblasts in CD are still subject to research. We therefore tried to identify IEC-derived factors that activate IF. METHODS: Primary human CECs and IF were isolated from control mucosa. IL-8 in the supernatant of IF cultures as a readout for IF activation was quantified by ELISA. Translocation of NF-kappaB was inhibited by dominant negative IKB-expressing adenovirus. Activation of NF-kappaB was demonstrated by immunfluorescence and a Protein/DNA array. The major activating (IL-8 inducing) protein was purified using FPLC (HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl S-200 High Resolution Column) and SDS gel electrophoresis and sequenced. RESULTS: A significant increase of IL-8 secretion from IF stimulated with CEC-conditioned media compared to unconditioned media (155,000 +/-10,000 versus 1,434 +/-695 pg/ml) was found. Denaturation of the medium (95\u00b0C for 30 minutes) reduced the activation suggesting that this effect was caused by a protein. Dilutions of the conditioned media up to 1:20 still induced detectable IL-8 levels indicating a strong stimulator. The effect of IEC-conditioned media on IF IL-8-secretion was NF-kappaB dependent as overexpression of dominant negative IkappaB reduced IL-8 secretion to levels of untreated cells. Translocation of NF-kappaB to the nucleus was higher in stimulated compared to non-stimulated IF. A Protein/DNA array confirmed these results. FPLC analysis suggested the existence of a protein with a molecular weight between 15 and 25 kDa mainly responsible for IF activation. Purification (FPLC and SDS-PAGE) and subsequent sequencing revealed soluble galectin 3 to be this strong IF activating factor produced by CEC. CONCLUSION: By a classical biochemical approach we identified soluble galectin 3 to be a strong activator of IF produced by CEC. Galectin 3 induced NF-kappaB activation and IL-8 secretion in these cells. Supported by DFG (SFB 585) W1097 Pro-Angiogenic Profile of the Mucosal Microenvironment in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Silvio Danese, Miquel Sans, Brenda M. Rivera Reyes, Gall West, Manijeh H. Phillips, Antonio Gasbarrini, Claudio Fiocchi Neoangiogenesis, the growth of new blood vessels, is critical for neoplastic growth, but also chronic inflammation, like in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and atherosclerosis. We recently demonstrated occurrence of intense neoangiogenesis in Crohffs disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) mucosa, but the local mediators of new vessel formation have not been identified. In vivo levels of the key pro-angiogenic molecules IL-8, bFGF and VEGF, and their cellular source(s) were examined, and whether they could promote angiogenesis in vitro was tested with human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells (HIMEC). ELBA and immunoblotting measured IL-8, bFGF and VEGF in mucosal extracts, and in cultures of human intestinal fibroblasts (HIF) and lamina propria mononuclear cells (LPMC) stimulated by TNF-a, and LFS or anti-CD3, respectively. Chemotaxis tested the extracts' capacity to induce HIMEC migration, and the contribution of individual angiogenic factors was assessed by antibody blockade. Compared to controls (22 -+ 6 pg/mI), IL-8 levels in IBD extracts were remarkably (p<0.01) higher in UC (698-+ 180) and CD (456-+ 170), and the same was true for bFGF (UC: 1450+60, CD: 1376+55, control: 802-+33). VEGF showed a 5-fdd increased in IBD compared to normal mucosa. Unstimulated HIF produced negligible amounts of IL-8, but low and high amounts of bFGF and VEGF, respectively. After TNF-a stimulation, production of 1L-8 and VEGF increased dramatically, while that of bFGF remained unchanged. In contrast, LPMC spontaneously produced large amounts of all three mediators, and these increased with LPS and anti-CD3 stimulation for IL-8, while only LPS enhanced bFGF and VEGF. Both CD and UC extracts induced a 4-fold increase in HIMEC migration, which was inhibited primarily by blocking IL-8, but less bFGF and VEGF. These results demonstrate that both immune and nonimmune cells significantly contribute to the creation of a pro-angiogenic microenvironment in IBD mucosa. Understanding the dominant angiogenic factors and their cellular source provides the material and conceptual bases for developing novel anti-angmgenic therapies in IBD.",

            "text": "A Role for SPARC in the ExtraceUular Matrix Changes in 1BD lan C. Lawrance, Francis Lloyd, Warren Raye Background: Crohns disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) of unknown aetiology. CD, unlike UC, presents with transmural inflammation that may lead to fibrosis and intestinal obstruction. SPARC protein (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine) is transiently expressed in inflamed tissue, is associated with wound healing and its mRNA expression is inversely related to the presence of fibrosis. Aims: The aims of this study were to correlate SPARC expression with intestinal inflammation and fibrosis in human IBD and to determine if altered expression of SPARC influences fibrosis in the TNBS model of murine intestinal fibrosis. Methods: Sections from control intestine, fibrosed CD, nonfibrosed UC and the disease controls fibrosed diverticular disease and nonflbrosed ischaemic colitis were stained with haemotoxylin and eosin, trichrome, SPARC, collagen I and III and analysed. In the murine model, chronic intestinal inflammation was established by weekly intrarectal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) for 8 weeks. Groups of mice were treated with oral RA 50mg/kg/day (stimulates SPARC expression), indomethacin 0.2mg/kg/day (blocks the downstream signalling of SPARC) or neither. Colonic tissue was obtained, stained as above, mRNA isolated and SPARC expression determined by real-time PCR. Results: SPARC protein was constitutive expressed in neural tissue and fibroblast-like ceils in all colonic tissue, but SPARC was only expressed in the inflammatory cell infiltrate in inflamed, but not fibmsed intestine. In the murine model, indomethacin induced and retinoic acid inhibited both inflammation and fibrosis at 2 weeks (determined by trichrome, collagen I and lI1 staining). SPARC mRNA expression was inversely related to the development of fibrosis at 2 weeks, except in the indomethacin-treated mice where SPARC levels were significantly elevated (p<0.0001), but did not protect against fibrosis. Differences between the groups were lost at 8 weeks. These findings demonstrate that SPARC expression levels inversely correlate with the level of intestinal fibrosis and that increased SPARC levels protect against intestinal fibrosis, but this protection can be blocked by indomethacin. Conclusion: SPARC expression levels play a role in the development intestinal fibrosis. BACKGROUMD: An emerging concept in matrix biology suggests that upon tissue injury, a provisional, HA matrix is formed at the same time that infammation occurs. Over time, HA is replaced with more permanent tissue-repair matrix elements (e.g.collagen, elastin) and inflammation recedes. Recently, Teder et al. (Science 2002-296:155) showed in a lung injury model that hyaluronan must be cleared before a permanent matrix is deposited and inflammation resolves. Macmphages, via CD44 receptors, were responsible for clearing HA. We observed upregulation of HA in the colonic mucosa during active IBD and have reported that treatment of mucosal smooth muscle ceils (M-SMC) with vires or other agents that induce endoplasmic reticnlum stress in vitro, causes elaboration of a HA matrix that is adhesive for mononuclear leukocytes via their CD44 receptors. AIMS: We investigated whether monocytic cell populations (from U937 cells, PBML or LPMC) that preferentially bind to the adhesive HA matrix in vitro are able to clear HA. Additionally we followed the fate of hyaluronan after exposure to monocytes by measuring the changes in the M-SMC, monocyte and culture medium compartments. METHODS: Human M-SMCs and LPMCs were derived from resected colon tissue. LPMC or U937 monocytic cell binding to unstimulated or poly I:C-stimulated M-SMCs was assessed using 51Cr-labeled leukocytes and confoeal microscopy. HA was measured by fluorophore-assisted carbohydrate gel electrophoresis (FACE). RESULTS: HA mediated leukocyte adhesion favors the binding of monocytic lineage (CD13 +, CD14 +) leukocytes. Adhesion of monocytic leukocytes to HA results in CD44 capping and HA internalization by these cells. HA is depleted from the M-SMC surface rapidly (15-30 rain), and a rise in HA in monocytes and culture medium is observed. CONCLUSIONS: Hyaluronan-mediated mononuclear leukocyte adhesion represents a noncytokine-induced pathway of leukocyte retention by M-SMCs that favors interaction with monocytes. Binding induces changes in these leukocytes, most apparent in the rapid CD44 capping and HA degradation and internalization. An imbalance in the synthesis / degradation pathways could account for the observed accumulation of HA in inflamed colonic mncosa and may contribute to the chronicity of IBD flares.",

It is also suggested that enteric microflora act an important pathophysiological role in active UC. Aim of this study is to investigate the effect of enteric microflora in the inflammatory action by analyzing proinflamamtory cytokines or toll-fike receptor (TLR) expressions of colonic epithelial cells in UC. (Subjects and Methods) Colonic mucosa was obtained from surgically operated or biopsied specimens from 16 UC patients, 10 Crohn's disease (CD) patients and 18 normal subjects. Western blot analysis was performed using monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against ubiqnitinated protein and IKB-~ protein, lmmunohistochemical staining was also performed using anti-ubiquitin mAb. After co-cultured with bacterial products from normal flora, proinflammatory cytokines' secretion, TLRs and IL-8 mRNA expressions of colonic mucosa / isolated epithelial cells were analyzed by ELISA / RT-PCR. (Results) 1) By Western blot analysis, polyubiquitinated protein expression was up-regulated in active UC mucosa. Furthermore, total IKB-~ protein expression was down-regulated, while ubiqnitinated and phosphorylated IKB-a protein expression was up-regulated in active UC mucosa.",

            "text": "Extended Lifespan and Long Telomeres in Fibroblasts from Older Ulcerative Colitis Patients Katherine Getliffe, Carmen Martin-Ruiz, Thomas von Zgfinicki, Chuka Nwokolo Ulcerative colitis (UC) is characterised by damage to the intestinal epithelium and the underlying connective tissue. The cellular causes of this damage are unknown, but could include changes in the proliferative ability of the epithelial layer, and either decreased or overactive wound healing activity, the latter of which leads to fibrosis. All three of these processes are regulated, at least in part, by the colonic fibroblasts present in the stmma of the colonic mucosa, and a recent study has shown that these cells are functionally altered in UC. In cells lacking telomerase, telomeres shorten with each cell division until they reach a critical length at which proliferation ceases, and the cells undergo replicative senescence. Since senescent fibmblasts are functionally deficient, it is possible that telomere shortening and senescence could be accelerated in UC and thus play a role in the etiology of the disease. Further support for this idea is provided by previous observations of changes in telomerase activity, telomere shortening rates, and genomic instability in UC and by the fact that the telomerase knockout mouse suffers colitis-fike ulcerations of the bowel. To test our hypothesis, we have isolated colon fibroblasts from 9 UC patients and 9 non-colitis controls and measured their proliferative lifespan in vitro. Telomere lengths were measured by quantitative real time PCR. We found that the age of control patients correlated negatively with the lifespan of their rectal fibroblasts (p = 0.003 P,2 = 0.68), but this linear correlation was absent in UC fibroblasts. In fact cells from older UC patients underwent significantly more population doublings before senescence when compared to age-matched controls (25 vs 15, p = 0.02). Trends towards longer telomeres at explant and slower rates of telomere shortening were also observed in fibroblasts from older UC patients. Unexpectedly, our study showed that replicative senescence is delayed in rectal fibroblasts derived from older UC patients. This could reflect an increased risk of cancer progression or a biomarker for a different disease process in these individuals. This study finds further evidence of connective tissue abnormalities in the colon in UC.",

Several classes of cell surface glycoproteins including CD98 have been shown to play a role in integrin-mediated events. In the present study, we investigated i) CD98 protein expression induced by the pro-inflammatory cytokine interferon gamma in caco2-BBE monolayers ii) cell signaling events induced by CD98 figation in Caco2-BBE monolayers iii) the intestinal effects of CD98 ligation in mouse colitis model. Methods: Intestinal epithelial cell line Caco2-BBE, intestinal mucosa from human and mice were used in this present study. In vivo studies were performed in mice administered DSS. Results: We show that CD98 is expressed in normal human and mice small and large intestine. We demonstrate that the cytokine interferon gamma increases the expression of CD98 protein in Caco2-BBE monolayers. The increase expression of CD98 by interferon gamma is at the transcriptional level. We show that the ligation of CD98 protein with a mouse anti CD98 antibody induces an increase in intraceflular calcium and protein phosphorylations (e.g FAK phosphorylation) in Caco2-BBE monolayers. We demonstrate that the administration of anti-CD98 to the mice did not induce visible colonic inflammation. However, dextran sulfate sodium-induced murine colitis is significantly enhanced by CD98 ligation. Conclusions: These data collectively indicate that, i) CD98 is up-regnlated during intestinal inflammation ii) activation of CD98 protein worsens intestinalinflammation. We propose that during inflammation, CD98 is up-regulated and that natural binding molecules to CD98 are released. The combination of these events might play an important role in the induction and perpetuation of the intestinal inflammation. Introduction and aims-Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal disorder characterised by an abnormal mucosal immune response, probably triggered by components of intestinal bacterial flora, in genetically susceptible hosts. NOD2/CARD15 is the first susceptibility gene identified in Crohn's disease and is thought to interact with bacterial muramyldipeptide intracellularly, leading to activation of the NFkappaB pathway. NOD2/ CARD15 is constitutively expressed in monocytes and in Paneth cells in the small intestine, possibly explaining why NOD2/CARD15 mutations are particularly associated with Crohn's disease of the terminal ileum. Paneth cells are specialized secretory epithelial cells located at the bases of the crypts of Lieberktihn in the small intestine and they produce important ant/bacterial proteins such as lysozyme, secretory phospholipaseA2 (sPLA2) and alphadefensins. In this study we investigated Paneth cell morphology and gene expression in Crohn's disease in relation to the NOD2/CARD15 genotype. Methods-PCR, restriction fragment length polymorphism and sequencing were used for genotyping. Terminal ileal surgical resection specimens were used for immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis to detect expression of lysozyme, sPLA2 and alpha-defensin 5. Results and conclusions-While there were histochemicafly apparent differences in the number and distribution of Paneth cells that were correlated with NOD2/CARD15 genotype, all the Paneth cell antimicrobial products we tested for were detected in all samples, regardless of genotype. These products included lysozyme, sPLA2 and alpha-defensin 5, suggesting that although NOD2/ CARD15 mutations could alter aspects of Paneth cell function and differentiation, they do not cause an absolute deficiency of antibacterial proteins and peptides.",

            "text": "Uncouped eNOS Activity in Chronically Inflamed Human Intestinal Microvascular Endothelial Cells Contributes to Acquired Microvascular Dysfunction in IBD Parvaneh Rafiee, Ossama A. Hatoum, Kirkwood A. Prichard Jr., David G. Bininn Introduction: Microvacular endothelial dysfunction is found in chronically inflamed IBD intestine, which may contribute to impaired healing, enhanced leukocyte recruitment and thrombotic complications. Loss of endothelial derived nitric oxide (NO) and increased superoxide generation in affected gut microvessels underlies this dysfunction. It is now known that eNOS may switch from NO production to superoxide generation, based on activation status and HSP 90 association, which is found in endothelial cells exposed to chronic stress (i.e. atherosclerosis, diabetes mellitus). We hypothesized that uncoupled eNOS activity with preferential generation of superoxide contributes to microvascular endothelial dysfunction in IBD. Methods: HIMEC from involved IBD (Crohn's disease & UC) and normal controls were assessed unstimulated or following TNF-a/LPS activation, eNOS expression was assessed using Western blotting. HIMEC lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-eNOS antibody and analyzed by Western blotting (SDS-PAGE) for anti-eNOS, phosphorylated eNOS (ser 1177, thr 495) and HSP90 association to demonstrate eNOS activation state. HIMEC superoxide generation was assessed using hydroethidine intravital staining and sepiapterirl was used to ensure adequate stores of tetrahydobiopterin. Results: Equivalent HsPgo expression in control and 1BD HIMEC increased following TNF-a/LPS. Control and IBD HIMEC demonstrated equivalent amounts of eNOS protein, and phosphorylation of ser 1177. In contrast, HSP90 association with eNOS, and phosphorylation of eNOS thr 495 was diminished in chronically inflamed IBD HIMEC compared to controls. Sepiapterin administration had no effect on control or IBD H1MEC superoxide generation, suggesting a mechanism independent of tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency. Conclusions: These data suggest that eNOS activation state is altered in chronically inflamed 1BD HIMEC. This uncoupling of eNOS in chronically inflamed IBD endothelial cells results from diminished thr 495 phosphorylation and a lack of HSP90 association. We have previously shown that IL-113 and H202 are elevated in sigmoid circular muscle from UC patients. The H202 scavenger catalase restored the decreased Ca '-+ signal in UC sigmoid muscle cells and cell shortening to normal levels, supporting the hypothesis that H202 contributes to sigmoid motor dysfunction in UC. In addition, IL-113 reduced NKAinduced Ca 2+ signal and cell shortening in Ca 2+ free medium and caused the switch of signal transduction pathway of NKA-induced contraction from calmodulin-and protein kinase C (PKC)-dependent in untreated normal cells to PKC-dependent in 1L-l~-treated cells, similar to the changes observed in UC, suggesting that IL-I[3 contributes to motor dysfunction in UC. IL-liB-induced reduction in Ca 2 + signal and shortening of isolated circular muscle cells was restored by catalase, suggesting that IL-l~-indnced motor dysfunction occurs at least in part through production of H202. In this study we tested sigmoid smooth muscle cells as a possible source of H202 in UC. Intraceflular H~O2 was measured by using fluorescence of 5,6-chlommethyl-2', 7'-dichlorodihydrofluoreseein diacetate (CM-H2DC-FDA). A stronger oxidant signal was detected in enzymatically isolated UC sigmoid circular smooth muscle ceils than control cells. The oxidant generated was H202, since preincubation of the muscle cells with catalase (78u/ml, 50min) significantly reduced the fluorescent signal. These data suggest that isolated UC muscle cells contain excess H202. To confirm this observation control and UC sigmoid circular smooth muscle cells were cultured for 48 hours and H202 levels in the culture medium measured. UC muscle cells spontaneously secreted more H202 than normal cells. These data indicate that sigmoid smooth muscle cells may be a source of H202 in UC. Treatment with UC mucosal homogenates for 48 hours significantly increased secretion of H202 by normal muscle cells, whereas normal mucosal homogenate did not, suggesting that inflammatory mediators secreted by UC mucosa stimulate muscle cells to produce H202. Similarly, a 48-hour exposure to TNFc~ (1 ng/ml) or IL-113 (10 U/ ml), which are elevated in the mucosa and muscle from UC patients, significantly increased secretion of H202 by normal muscle cells. We conclude that TNFct and IL-l~3 secreted by UC mucosa stimulate sigmoid circular smooth muscle ceils to produce H202. Supported by NIDDK R21 DK62775-01.",

Buchan, Kevan Jacobson Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and recurrent intestinal inflammatory disorder that in adults has been associated with changes in neuropeptide expression and distribution. The purpose of the present study was to determine whether similar changes were observed in children with IBD. Full thickness sections of tissue were collected from fresh surgical specimens from areas of inflamed colon and non-inflamed margins from children with ileocoloinc (n = 5) and colonic (n = 2) Crohn's disease, (mean age 13,3 years, age range 10-15 years, 4 males, disease duration prior to surgery 1 month-50 months, mean 23.85 months). The tissues were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and 601xm cryostat sections were immunostained for vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and nitric oxide synthase (NOS). Neural abundance was quantified using a morphometric analysis system. In inflamed regions in the submucons plexus a significant increase in the number of VIP immunoreactive (IR) neurons/plexus was observed (non-inflamed margins 1.9 -+ 0.4 neurons/ganglion vs. inflamed tissue 3.3-+ 0.4 neurons/ganglion). In contrast no change was seen in NOS-1R neurons in the inflamed submucous plexus as compared to normal margins (non-inflamed margins 0.8 -+ 0.5 neurons/ganglion vs. inflamed tissue 1.4 +_ 0.2 neurons/ganglion). Whereas, in the myenteric plexus the number of NOS-IR neurons was significantly increased in the inflamed areas (non-inflamed margins 4.8 _+ 0,6 neurons/ganglion vs. inflamed tissues 9.9 -+ 1.5 neurons/ganglion) and there was no change in VIP-IR neuron number (non-inflamed margins 1.3 _+ 0.3 neurons/ganglion vs. inflamed tissue 1.87 + 0.4 neurons/ganglion). In contrast to the adult data, there was little evidence for co-localization of VIP and NOS in the colon. These data demonstrate an important differential expression of subpopulations of neurons where in inflamed tissue VIP and NOS respond differently in the two major enteric plexi. Such changes in neuropeptide expression and distribution might contribute to the pathogenesis of IBD and ongoing symptoms even in the absence of active disease. Supported by CCFC (Canada).",

We examined the effects of soluble factors generated in the intestinal mucosa on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) to better characterize the possible regulatory mechanisms of enhanced recruitment of circulatory neutrophils into the affected mucosa with UC. Methods: Colonoscopic mucosal biopsy tissues were cultured on a culture insert for 24 h and the organ culture supernatants were used for the following experiments of endothelial activation /UC~ n= 16, Crohn's disease; n= 15, coutro Is: n = 15). The parameters for endothelial activation included IL-8 production (ELISA), ICAM-1 expression (flow cytometry), and NF-kB activation (immuno-histochemistry, Western blotting, and luciferase reporter assay). The interactions between neutrophiI s an d HUVEC were examined with the binding and migration assays. Results: The locally generated soluble factors in UC mucosa could activate endothelial NF-kB with subsequent IL-8 production and ICAM-1 expression. Neutralization experiments with specific block ing antibodies suggested that endogeneous lL-lb in UC mucosa may be largely responsible for enhanced neutruphilic migration through increased binding to HUVEC. As for the therapeutic agents, prednisolone (PSL) and cyclospor/n A (CsA), but not 5-A SA, sig nificandy inhibited IL-lb-induced endothelial NF-kB activation. Conclusions: In actively inflamed mucosa with UC, locally generated IL-lb could attract neutrophils through NF-kB-mediated ICAM-1 expression and 1L-8 production. These phenomena was s uppre ssed in the presence of PSL or CsA, suggesting that suppression of endothelial activation may be a candidate therapeutic target in patients with UC.",

The aim of this study is to investigate the importance of leukocyte-platelets (Leu-Plt) complex and the mechanisms of its formation m the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis (UC), and to evaluate the effect of granuloeytapheresis (GCAP) on platelets-leukocyte complex. Methods: 1) Peripheral blood was obtained from patients with ulcerative colitis (UC), or healthy controls (HC) with anticoagulant. After red blood ceils were hemolyzed with ammonium chloride, white blood cells were stained with anti-CD3, anti-CD14, anti-CD16, anti-CD61, anti-CD162 (PSGL-1) or control antibody conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate or phycoerythrin. The platelets were isolated from peripheral blood and stained with anti-CD62P (P-selectin). Then, cells were analyzed by flow cytometer. 2) The severity of UC was assessed by the clinical activity index (CAI) score according to Lichtiger and Present, and the relation of Leu-Ph complexes to CA1 score was analyzed in UC patients. 3) Fiftynine patients with UC treated with GCAP were studied. Each patient received five apheresis sessions for 5 consecutive weeks. Peripheral blood was obtained just before 1st session, 3rd session, 5th session, then Leu-Plt complex were analyzed. Results: 1) The numbers and percentages of neutrophde-platelet (N-Plt) complex (CD16 + CD61 + ) and monocyte-platelet (M-PIt) complex (CD14 + CD61 + ) were significantly increased in patients with UC compared with HC. Although CD162 was expressed on neutrophiles and monocytes from both UC patients and HCs, the expression of CD62P was higher on platelets from UC patients than those from HCs. 2) There was no relation between the number of Leu-Ph complex and CAI score in UC patients. However, in patients treated with prednisolone (PSI.) 5rag/ day, the number of Leu-Plt complex was significantly related to CAI score. 3) In patients treated with 5 rag/day or less of PSL, N-Plt complex was significantly decreased before 3rd and/or 5th treatment in GCAP responder group. Conclusion: These results suggest that Leu-Pit complexes play an important role in the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis, and that these complexes reflect the severity of the disease and the response to GCAP therapy. The TLRs expressed by macrophages, DC, and lymphocytes are an integral component of innate immune response. Similar to TLRs, some CD 1 family members are capable of recognizing bacterial components. Although an in vivo microbial Ag for CDld is unknown, CDld activates Val4 NKT cefls which have been shown to mediate important innate immune response. The aim of our study was to characterize the interaction of TLRs and CDld by examining the dependence of TLR expression on CDld following oral Listeria infection. 129/B6 CDld-/-and Wild Type (WT) mice were infected PO with 5x108 Listeria monocytogenes (Lm), and PMBC and lymphocytes from the lung and intestines were isolated for TLR2 and TLR4 expression by flow analysis at 20 and 40 hr after infection. Results indicated that the number of CD 1 lb + blood macrophages was decreased at 20 hr in CD 1 d-/-(7.8%) compared with WT (14.6%) mice. Differential TLR2 expression was observed following Lm infection. In CDld-/-mice, CD1 lb + TLR2 + ceils increased from 4% at baseline to 62% (15.5 fold) at 20 hr, while macrophages expressing TLR2 in WT increased from 3% at baseline to only 12% (4 fold) during this time. The levels of TLR4 cell surface expression in WT and CDld-/. mice were comparable in blood CD11b+ cells at 20 hr (1.5%vsl.3%), but CDld-/-mice showed a 3.5 fold increase in TLR4 expression (9.5%) compared with WT mice (2.7%) at 40 hr. In addition, we have observed that TLR2 expression was increased in CD4 + T cells in the lung (1.4 fold), but was decreased in CD5+ cells when compared with IELs from the small intestine (1.4 fold) of WT mice. This difference was increased in lung (1.7 fold) compared with IEL from the small intestine, when CD5+CD4+ T cells were analyzed. These data suggest that 1) expression of TLR2FfLR4 on CD1 lb + macrophages are dependent on CDld for an efficient Listeria clearance, 2) absence of CDld induced an upregulation of TLR2/TLR4 as a possible compensatory mechanism to activate innate immunity, 3) Lm activated TLR2 early in the infection followed by TLR4, and 4) CD5 + cells may be down regulating TLR2 expression in CD4 + T cells ni the intestine.",

Flageflin-induced IL-8 and MIP3A promoter activity or protein production were not altered by transfection of NCM+60 cells with a dominant negative JNK mutant or preincubation with the JNK inhibitor, SP600125, respectively. However, flageflin-stimulated IL-8 promoter activity was blocked by a dominant negative MEK1 (a kinase involved in the ERKI/2 activation) mutant or by the MEK inhibitors PD98059 and U0126. Flagellin-mediated MIP3A expression was suppressed by exposure to the MEK inhibitors, whereas increased MIP3A promoter activity was partially inhibited by a dominant negative MEK1 mutant. ConcInaion: In non-transformed human colonocytes MEK activation mediates IL-8 and MIP3A expression in response to flagellin-TLR5 engagement.

            "text": "The Structure of CARD15 and the Molecular Mechanisms of Mutations Associated with Crohn's Disease Bissan A1-Lazikani, Daniel J. B. Marks, Anthony W. Segal CARD15 is thought to act as a receptor for muramyl dipepride (MDP), a component of bacterial cell walls. Mutations in the CARD15 gene are associated with chronic inflammatory granulomatons diseases, including Crohn's disease and Blau syndrome. Little is known about the protein's normal structure and function, and precisely how mutations alter these characteristics. Using bioinformatics methods we structurally annotate and model all domains in CARD 15, focusing on regions associated with disease. The C-terminal domain of CARD15 is a canonical Leucine Rich Repeat (LRR), similar to that seen in Ribonuclease-H inhibitor. By modelling the 3-dimensional structures of the wild-type and mutated LRR domains, we propose that it interacts with another protein domain, and that the interface spans at least 25A. This includes approximately half of the face of the LRR, implying that it does not bind MDP in isolation. We suggest either that CARD15 is not the receptor for MDP but an intermediary downstream in a signalling pathway, or that MDP must be presented bound to a protein partner. We also explain how the G908R and L1007finsC mutations associated with Crohn's Disease disrupt this interface and the normal signalling function of CARD15. We next modelled the Nucleotide Binding Domain. By homology, we expect this to function as a catalytic ATPase, since it possesses key residues implicated in ATP hydrolysis. In contrast with the mutations in the LRR, we demonstrate that mutations involved in Blau syndrome, characterised by arthritis, uveitis and cutaneous inflammation but not overt bowel disease, directly affect ATP binding. Specifically, the R334W/Q and L469F mutations impede the deactivation kinetics of either ATP hydrolysis or release. This would explain the constitutive activation of CARD15 described in cells transfected with constructs containing the Blau mutations. By using bioinformatic predictive methodology we have provided valuable insights into the normal functioning of CARD15 Furthermore, we can precisely explain the mechanisms by which mutations in the LRR cause the loss-of-function associated with Crohn's disease, and those found in the NBD cause the constitutive activation witnessed in Blau syndrome.",

We have recently demonstrated that ligand-induced activation of TLR2 significantly enhances intestinal transepithefial resistance (TER) mediated via PKC, independently of MyD88 Aim: To identify specific TJ-associated proteins as targets of TLR2-induced activation of PKC modulating TER. Materials and Methods: Subceflular distribution of TJ-associated proteins during TLR2-induced increase of TER was assessed by laser confocal microscopy of highly differentiated Caco-2 monolayers after exposure to the synthetic fipopeptide Pam3CysSK4, a known TLR2 ligand. Results: After stimulation with Pam3CysSK4, membrane-associated ZO-1 redistributed to apical TJ areas forming distinct and consolidated lateral cell-cell contacts in comparison with samedepth negative controls analyzed by (X/Y-)Z-section confocal immunofiuorescence. Alteration of ZO-1 distribution correlated in a time-dependent manner with Pam3CysSK4-induced transient increase of TER. Pretreatment with specific PKC inhibitors (G66976 and rottlerin) for 30 minutes blocked Pam3CysSK4-induced alteration of ZO-1 distribution correlating with inhibition of TER increase via PKC. However, stimulation with Patn3CysSK4 did not result in TJ junctional-associated morphological changes of occludin, claudin-1, E-cadherin or actin cytnskeleton, suggesting a specific effect on ZO-1 via TLR2-PKC. In contrast, stimulation with the phorbol ester PMA activated several different PKC isoforms which led to disruption of ZO-1 lining, suggesting stimulus-specific effects on diverse morphological alterations of ZO-1 via the broad PKC-complex. Conclusions: The present study suggests that PKC-complex is an essential component of the TLR2 signaling pathway and directly enhances intestinal epithelial integrity through translocation of ZO-1 upon activation.",

Smith Background: We have shown that human intestinal macrophages are down-regulated for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines but retain their phagocytic and baeteriocidal capabilities. Here we investigated the mechanism underlying the profound down-regulation of intestinal macrophages for cytokine release Methods: Intestinal macrophages obtained from patients undergoing gastrojejunostomy and isolated by enzyme digestion and homologous blood monocytes were purified by elutriation. Conditioned medium was derived from the stroma of small intestinal mucosa (S-CM). Nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts and mRNA extracts were prepared from intestinal macrophages and monocytes incubated with or without LPS (1 Mg/ml)-, IFN-F(100 U/ml)-, heat-killed Staphylococcus aureus (HKSA; 107 CFU) for 15, 30 and 60 minutes. Extracts also were made from stimulated monocytes in the presence of S-CM or S-CM plus anti-TGF-B. Signal transduction capability was assessed by determining MyD88, TRAF-6, NF-KB, IKBA and p-IKBA levels by western blot and MD-2 mRNA by RT-PCR. Culture supernatants were evaluated for IL-1, IL-6, TNF-A and TGF-B. Results: Stumulated intestinal macrophages released no NF-KB-inducible cytokines (ILl, 1L-6, TNF-A), did not express the signal transduction proteins MD-2 or MyD88, and failed to activate NF-KB. Monocytes released these cytokines, expressed the signal transduction proteins, and activated NF-KB. Since intestinal macrophages derive from blood monocytes, we investigated how intestinal rnacrophages lose the ability to express MD-2 and MyD88, and to activate NF-KB Monocytes stimulated as above, but in the presence of $-CM, released no NF-KB-dependent cytokines, and did not activate NF-KB, identical to intestinal macrophages. However, the S-CM-treated monocytes did release TGF-B, (an NF-KB-independent process). Importantly, pre-incubation of S-CM with anti-TGF-B antibodies inhibited S-CM do,mr-regulation of monocyte NF-KB activation and the release of NF KBdependent pro-inflammatory cytokines. Conclusions: Intestinal macrophages are downregulated for pro-inflammatory cytokine release through blockade of MD-2 and MyD88, key proteins in the NF-KB activation pathway. Moreover, the ability of stromal cell-derived TGF-B to inhibit monocyte NF-KB-dependent cytokine production, suggests a mechanism whereby monocytes newly recruited to the lamina propria undergo down regulation for pro-inflammatory cytokine production Wl117",

Although there is growing data to suggest that the neuropeptide somatostatin (SUM) modulates the innate immune response and thus may impact the natural history of gut mucosal inflammation, the effect of SUM on the biochemistry and cellular physiology of integrin-mediated neutrophiI recruitment has not been studied. Purified human PMN, isolated from whole blood, were fluomscein-labeled and binding assays performed in plates coated with human fibrinogen (FIB). a ligand specific for the predominant B2 integrin receptor on PMN, Mac-l, or with human ICAM-1, a ligand recognized by both Mac-1 and LFA-1. 10-7M SUM-14, inhibited IL-8stimulated PMN adhesion to FIB 40.7% (n= ll, SE=4.3, p =.00001). SUM may impact the function of both Mac-1 and LFA-1 or interrupt key interactions between these two integrins as ceil adhesion was inhibited 60% in PMN adherent to ICAM-1. PMN primed with IFNF, an important pro-inflammatory cytoklne in inflammatory conditions of the gut mucosa, had an augmented response to IL-8-when adhesion to ICAM-1 was assessed, This augmentation was reversed in the presence of SUM. SUM inhibits the activation of MAPK in pancreatic cancer cells, possibly by activating serine phosphatases. As MAPK activity is an essential mediator of IL-8-stimulated Mac-1 activation and figand binding on PMN, we examined the effect of SUM on MAPK in PMN lysates in western blots with activationspecific antibody. SUM 14 (10-8M) inhibited IL-8-stimulated MAPK activity by 38.1% (n = 9, SE = 7.1, p = .001). Similarly, preservation of protein kinase C (PKC) activity is important for integrin-mediated PMN adhesion and we have previously identified a 74kD isoform of PKC that is rapidly activated in stimulated PMN. SUM decreased the activity of this PKC isoform 35% (n=5, SE=8.9, p= .013) SUM receptors, have been identified on human and murine lymphocytes and monocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. PMN were incubated with I125-Tyrll S-14 at 37\u00b0C in the presence of unlabeled SUM. Cold SUM displaced the label in a dose dependent manner in unstimulated PMN as well as IL-8stimulated PMN. In addition, preliminary flow cytometry experiments show specific binding of Ab to SSTR2 to human PMN stimulated with PMA.

The characteristic gastric mucosal change in AIDS has been reported to be hypertrophic gastric fold, which is usually associated with opportunistic infection such as cytomegaIovirus, cryptospondium or toxoplasma in Helicobacter pylori-negative patients. However, the mechanism of the~ gastric changes is still unclear. To clarify it, we studied the pathophysiology of gastric mucosal lesions in the impaired acquired immunity using MHC class II deficient mice, which is supposed to be similar to AIDS patients. Materials and Methods: MHC class II deficient mice (C57Bld6 background) were serially sacrificed up to 6 months (10 in each group). Wild type (WT) C57BL/6 mice were served as controls. All mice were bred in the SPF conditions.

Moreover, to investigate the effects of gastrin on the gastric hyperplastic changes, inhibitor of gastrin receptor, AGO41R, was administered to 10 mice for three months. RESULT: (1) CD4+ T cells, but not CD8 or B220+ cells, decreased in the spleen of MHC class II deficient mice.

TCP-1 gamma gene was amplified by PCR reaction using Taq DNA polymerase (lnvitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and the amount of PCR product for each sample was compared with its 18S RNA. The ratio of intensity for TCP-1 gamma and 18S RNA, quantified by Kodak EDAS290 gel documentation system, was used as a measure of expression of TCP-1 gamma gene. Based on statistical analysis (mean +/-SD) of HS, a ratio of 0.12 (12%) is the cut off value to demarcate the expression levels of TCP-1 gamma in UC and HS. We observed that 83% HS have a ratio higher than 0.12 Where as 83% of UC patients have a ratio of less than 0.12. This difference in expression of TCP-2 gamma gene between healthy subjects and UC patients is statistically highly significant (p value (0.002). Conclusion: This is the first report of expression of TCP-1 on normal lymphocytes. We postulate that down regulation of TCP-1 in UC may be associated with altered immune balance and autoimmune responses in UC. Background & Aims: Enteric-bacterial interactions appear to play a central role in the development of colitis, and some anti-bacterial molecules have been demonstrated to possess a beneficial effect on the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Studies were undertaken to characterize naturally occurring host molecules which can modulate IBD. Methods: DNA microarray was performed using total colonic mucosal RNA obtained from WT mice on days 4 and 8 with administration of 4% DSS for 5 days. Messenger RNA that shows more than 20 folds increase in DSS-day 8 compared to DSS-day 4 was selected and the expression was confirmed by quantitative (Q)-PCR and immunohistochemistry (1HC) in animal models of acute and chronic colitis as well as human IBD including UC and CD. Results: Chitinase 3-like-1 (Chi3L1), a mammalian homologne of plant chitinases that play a major role in defense mechanisms against fungal pathogenesis, was 15-30 fold increased in the recovery phase (day 8) compared to the acute phase (day 4) of DSS colitis. The expression of Chi3L1 and its homolognes (Chi3L3 and 3L4 in mouse, Chi3L2 in human) was highly upregnlated in both colonic epithelial cells (CEC) and lamina propria (LP) cells of T-cell receptor alpha chain knockout (TCRa KO) mice (Th2 dominant colitis), and IL-4 and B cell deficient TCRa triple KO (ap, lL-4 TKO) mice (Thl dominant colitis) compared to WT mice in which ChDL1 expression was absent in both CEC nor LP cells by Q-PCR. The Chi3L1 mRNA expression was significantly upregulated in human UC and CD compared to those of normal individuals. The IHC analysis using affinity purified rabbit anti-Chi3L1 polyclonal antibody showed that CEC (both apical and basal sides) and LP cells (mainly macrophages and dendritic like cells) strongly expressed ChDL1 protein in TCRaKO mice and a~IL-4TKO mice, but the expression was stronger in CEC than LP in the colonic tissue of patients with UC and CD. The Chi3L1 expression was absent in WT and normal individuals. Both message and protein levels positively associated with the disease severity especially in Th2-dominant forms of colitis in mouse and human. Conclusions: Chi3L1 is significantly upregulated in both recovery phase of acute colitis and chronic colitis in animal models of colitis as well as human IBD. It is possible that Chi3L1 molecule might act as a beneficial factor in the development of colitis.",

We also reported that SP stimulates cell proliferation, a critical event in tissue restoration and healing during chronic colitis, via transactivatiml of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). However, the mechanism(s) involved in SP-induced EGFR and MAPI( activation are not completely understood. Here we examined the mechanism by which SP induces EGFR activation in normal human colonocytes and determined whether this mechanism is involved in MAPK and NF-kappa B signaling. Methods: Non-transformed human colonic NCM-460 cells, that normally express low levels of NK-2R, were stably transfected with the human NK-1R (NCM-NK-2R cells) using a retroviral expression system. Cells were incubated with SP for different time points and phospfiorylated EGFR or ERK1/ 2 were determined by Western blot analysis. Results: We found that exposure of NCM-NK-2R cells to SP (1 p~M) stimulated EGFR activation at 5 min followed by ERK1/2 activation at 15 min. SP-induced EGFR and ERK1/2 activation was blocked by pre-treatment of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor batimastat and the specific EGFR phosphoryIation inhibitor AG2478. Pretreatment with antibodies against potential EGFR ligands suggested that TGF alpha, but not epidermal growth factor (EGF), heparin-binding EGF, or amphiregnfin, is a major mediator of SP-induced EGFR transactivation. We also demonstrated that SP-induced I kappa B phosphorylation was not inhibited by either batimastat (3 &g/ml), or AG1478 (0.4 /.~M) pretreatment. Moreover, SP induced IL-8 secretion and IL-8 promoter activity was not significantly altered by batimastat or AG2478 pre-treatment. Conclusions: 1) SP induced EGFR and ERK1/2 activation involves MMP-mediated release of TGF a[pha leading to subsequent EGFR transactivation and cell proliferation.",

Pressure increased phagocytosis in all three groups. However, FAK SiRNA transfected cells exhibited only 40% of the pressure effect on phagocytosis observed scrambled SiRNA transfected cells, so that phagocytosis inversely paralleled FAK activation. Pretreatment of macrophages with PD98059 (50 raM) inhibited ERK activation and increased basal bead uptake cells (26.9 + 1.8 vs 31.7 -+ 2.2%, n= 15, p<0.05), but pressure did not increase further bead uptake in PD98059-treated cells. Pressure also inhibited ERK activation in mock-transfected macrophages or macrophages transfected with serambled-SiRNA, but transfection of FAK SiRNA abolished the inhibition of ERK by pressure. MonoMac-1 cells, which do not express FAK, exhibited minimal phagocytosis and pressure failed to increase MonoMac2 phagocytosis. These data suggest that tissue pressure from inflammatory edema may activate macrophages and that inhibition of FAK and consequent inhibition of ERK by extracellular pressure may contribute to this effect.",

            "text": "The In addition, we have linked the altered muscle contractility to eviction of the parasite, thereby contributing to host defense. Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is critical for the differentiation of naive T cells to Th2 cens. However, the source of IL-4 early in the immune response remains unclear. NK-T cells are an unusual population of T ceils, which coexpress receptors of T and NK cells, and these cells are considered to be an early source of IL-4. Murine CD1 has been implicated in the development and function of NK-T cells. In this study we investigated the intestinal muscle contractility and host protective immunity during Trichinella spirafis infection in CDldl mutant mice, which are deficient of NK-T cells. METHODS: CDldl mutant (CDldl -/-) and wild-type C57BL/6 (CDldl +/+) mice were infected with T. spiralis and were sacrificed at various time points to investigate worm recovery, carbachol-induced intestinal muscle contractility and IL-4 production from in vitro Con A stimulated spleen cells. RESULTS: Intestinal worm expulsion was delayed in CDldl -/-m~ce. A significantly higher number of worms was recovered from CDldl -/-mice as compared to CDldl +/+ mice on days 10 and 14 post-infection (p.i.) (worm count was 110.6 _+ 15.3 on day 10 p.i. and 52.5 +-6.7 on day 14 p.i. vs. 70.2 _+ 10.9 on day 10 p.i. and 31.3 -+ 4.9 on day 14 p.i. in CDldl 4-vs. CDldl +/+ infected mice, respectively). The delayed worm expulsion in CDldl -/-mice was associated with a marked attenuation of intestinal muscle contraction (muscle contraction was 1618.29 -4-286.73 mg/mm 2 in CDldl -/-infected mice compared to 1185.42 _4_-319.33 mg/mm 2 in CDldl +/+ infected mice on day 14 p.i.). This was correlated with a down-regulation of IL-4 production from splenocytes in CDldl -/-mice as compared to CDldl +/+ mice after infection (14.9 -+ 2.3 pg/ml vs. 35.9 _+ 6 pg/ml in CDldl -/-vs. CDldl +/+ infected mice on day 7 p.i.). cONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that CDldl contributes at least in part to infectioninduced muscle contractility, worm expulsion and the generation of a Th2 immune response in T. spiralis infection. Absence of NK-T cells in infected CDldl -/-mice is associated with the reduction of I1--4 production, which subsequently interfered with host protective immunity in this nematode infection. Leptin and ghrelin that are involved in the control of food intake, have recently been detected in the gastric mucosa and implicated in gastroprotection against various noxious agents but lheir anti-inflammatory effects in the lower gut have been little studied. In this study we compared the effects of vehicle, leptin and ghrelin applied subcutaneously (s.c.) in a dose of 0.5 -50 gg/kg on the healing of colonic damage induced in Wistar rats by the intrarectal administration of trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS, 10 mg/kg) with or without A) suppression of NO-synthase with L-NNA (20 mg/kg i.p.), and B) inactivation of sensory nerves by \u00a2apsaicin (125 mg/kg s.c. within three days) applied with or without the treatment with leptin or ghrelin. At 2 weeks upon the TNBS treatment, the colonic blood flow (CBF) was assessed by H2-gas clearance technique and the plasma leptin and ghrelin levels were assessed by radioimmunoassay (RIM. The distal 8 cm of the colon was removed and the colonic tissue weight, the area of colonic lesions (pfainmetry), myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity (by ELISA) and leptin and ghrefin mRNAs (by RT-PCR) were evaluated. Administration of TNBS resulted in macroscopic lesions accompanied by increase in tissue weight and 4-5-fold rise in the MPO activity. The expression of leptin and ghrelin mRNA in the colon was significantly enhanced in TBNS-treated rats as compared to those in intact colonic mucosa. Leptin or ghrelin dose-dependently attenuated the area of colonic lesions; the dose reducing these lesions by 50% (EDs0) was 20 and 40 8g/kg, respectively, and produced the significant fall in tissue weight and decrease in MPO activity. This acceleration of colonic healing evoked by both hormones was accompanied by the significant rise in the CBF (by 25%) and by 2-3 fold increase in plasma leptin and ghrelin levels. Inhibition of NO-synthase activity with L-NNA and capsaicin-deactivation of sensory nerves prolonged the healing of colonic lesions and significantly attenuated the leptin and ghrelin-induced acceleration of the healing of colonic damage and eliminated the accompanying rise in the CBF evoked by these peptides. We conclude that both, leptin and ghrelin applied exogenously and those expressed and released endogenously, exert anti-inflammatory properties and accelerate the healing of ulcerative colitis. These healing effects of hormones depend upon hyperemia in the colon probably mediated by NO and capsaicin-sensitive afferent fibers releasing vasoactive neuropeptides.",

Experiments using recombinant proteins in various animal models of gastric injury have demonstrated a role for TFF3 in repair processes. It enhances mucosal healing and restitution in vivo and promotes migration of intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. We have previously described a shedding of membranic E-cadherin Using an in-vitro cell culture system with Caco-2 derived enterocytes after administration of recombinant mouse TFF3. The aim of this study was to investigate possible ways in which E-cadherin is shed. Enterocyte-like Caco-2 cells were treated with TFF3 during 2 hours. Total RNA was isolated and cDNA was synthesised. The cDNA probe was hybridised to the Human Unigene Set 2 colony filters (RZPD), containing ~75.000 known and unknown ESTs spotted in duplo. These filters cover more then 90% of the human genome. Spot intensities were measured and signal quality was evaluated. The in vivo induction of MMP3 by TFF3 was evaluated in the murine Dextran Sodium Sulfate (DSS)-induced model for acute colitis. During DSS administration (drinking water was supplemented with 5% weight/ volume DSS), two groups of mice received daily inocula of LL-TFF3 or LL-pTREX1 (vector control) through an intragastric catheter. Mock-treated animals received daily 100 btl of BM9. Healthy control mice received normal drinking water throughout the experiment. MMP3 expression levels were evaluated in the colon at day 8 after treatment using quantitative PCR and immunohistochemistry. The macroarray results on the Caco-2 derived enterocytes showed a more than 2-fold increase in the expression of MMP3. In the mouse model, treatment with mTFF3 secreting L. lactis, LL-mTFF3 augmented the level of expression more than 10 times compared to the water controls, the relative expression levels of MMP3 were four times as high in the mock-treated mice suffering from acute colitis and administration of the vector control LL-pTREX1 led to a seven-fold increase. Immunohisthochemical staining for MMP3 expression in these mice showed a significant increase in MMP3 expression in the crypt epithelium of the mice treated with LL-mTFF3. In conclusion we show that TFF3 administration leads to an increased MMP3 transcription and protein expression.",

It has a peptide-binding site and binds peptides, which occur in the cell during proteasomal degradation. Gp96 with bound peptides is released into extracelhifar space during cell stress and necrosis, it binds to the CD91-receptor and is intemalised. The peptides are transferred to major histocompatibifity complex class I and are presented to T-cells and thereby immunity or tolerance can be induced. Recently we showed expression of gp96 in IMACs. METHODS: mRNA from in vitro differentiated macrophages and IMACs from norrn~l mucosa was isolated and Affymetrix \u00a9 ofigonudeotide array analysis was performed. Multicellular spheroids (MCS) in which the specific differentiation of IMACs occurs were generated by culturing HT-29 cells for 7 days on agarose. Freshly isolated blood monocytes were cocultured with the MCS and stained for gp96 after 24 h, 3 and 7 days immunohistochemically. In a murine transfer (CD4 + CD62L +) colitis model in SCID mice gp96 expression was further analyzed. RESULTS: In IMACs from non-inflamed mucosa gp96 mRNA was expressed 10-fold higher than in in vitro differentiated macrophages supporting earlier results on mRNA induction from a subtractive screening. Gp96 expression was induced in the MCS after 7 days of coculture, whereas staining was absent after 24hrs and 3 days. Background: The protein C is a potent natural anti-thrombotic and anti-inflammatory substance, whose activation is regulated by the endothelial expression of thrombomodulin (TM) and endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR). Inflammatory bowel diseases are characterized by chronic inflammation and an increase prevalence of thrombosis. Aim: aim of the present study was to evaluate the expression of EPCR and TM in intestinal resection or mucosal biopsy specimens from patients with inflammatory bowel diseases and controls. The soluble forms of the receptors were also measured in plasma. Materials and Methods: Resection specimens from 36 patients with ulcerative colitis, 38 with Crohn's disease were studied by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. 38 peritumoral tissue specimens from patients with colon cancer and 32 resection specimens from patients with diverticulitis were used as controls. RNA from 12 frozen tissue from IBD and controls undergoing colonoscopy was extracted for RT-PCR. Soluble receptors were measured in the plasma of 52 IBD patients and 52 controls. Statistical analysis was performed by means of non-parametric tests. Results. Endothelial protein C receptor and thrombomodulin were expressed on mucosal endothelium of normal specimens, while the intensity of the signal decreased in inflammatory bowel diseases. Surprisingly, EPCR was also expressed by-dendritic-like cells, which also stained positive for CD21. Co-localization was verified by immunofluorescence. The number of EPCR+/CD21 + dendritic-like ceils was decreased in ulcerative colitis patients compared to controls (12.0_ + 3.6 cells per high power field vs 23.8 + 10.4, p=0.03), while this decrease was less evident in sections from Crohn's disease patients. Messenger RNA for EPCR paralleled protein expression. Median soluble thrombomodulin and EPCR plasma levels were higher in IBD patients than in controls: 41.5 vs 26.0 ug/mL (p< 0.0001) and 141 vs 130 ng/mL (p<O.05), respectively. Conclusions. EPCR expression on dendritic-like cells which bear the key complement receptor CD21 suggests a role for EPCR in innate immunity. In IBD, the reduced mucosal expression of TM and EPCR as well as the high soluble TM and EPCR plasma levels suggest a derangement of protein C activation, possibly leading to decreased anti-thrombotic activity of this pathway.",

Parvum Infection of Neonatal Piglets Jody Gookin, Jessica Allen, Sophia Chiang, Martha Armstrong C. parvum parasitizes epithelium of intestinal villi, resulting in enterocyte injury, inflammatory cell influx, electrolyte and fluid loss, and a decrease in barrier function. We have previously shown that inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is expressed by infected epithelium and nitric oxide (NO) metabolites increase in urine of infected piglets. Inhibition of iNOS had no short-term effect on barrier function of Ussing chambered sheets of ileal mucosa obtained from infected piglets. We hypothesized that epithelial iNOS induction may serve to promote parasite clearance and thus examined the in vivo mechanism of iNOS action in C. parvum infection. One-day-old fittermate piglets were randomly allocated to treatment groups and infected with 10 ~ C. parvum oocysts on day 3. The location and amount of iNOS protein was determined by IHC and immunoblottmg of ileal mucosa from control and infected piglets. NO synthesis was measured by urinary excretion of NOx. Mucosal myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity was measured to quantify nentrophil infiltration. Piglets were treated with an iNOS inhibitor (L-NIL 3 mg/kg IP q24-hr; n=9) or saline (2 ml IP q24-hr; n=9). Severity of infection was determined by daily body weight, fecal consistency, and number of excreted oocysts. Piglets were euthanized at peak infection for quantitative histology and ileal mucosal sheets were mounted in Ussing chambers for measurement of transeptihelial resistance, 3H-mannitol flux, and Cl-secretion. C. parvum infection resulted in intense expression of iNOS by parasitized enterocytes along apical villi, and significantly increased urinary excretion of NOx, and mucosal MPO activity compared to uninfected piglets. Infected piglets treated with L-NIL had significantly decreased urinary excretion of NOx, significantly increased excretion of oocysts in feces, and significantly greater numbers of parasites per villus enterocyte compared to saline-treated infected piglets. There were no differences body weight, severity of diarrhea, mucosal barrier function, C1-secretion, or mucosal MPO activity between saline and L-NIL-treated piglets. Results of this study demonstrate that epithelial expression of iNOS significantly diminishes early enterocyte parasitism in C. parvum infection.",

Introduction. Dendritic cells (DC) occupy a central position in the immune system as cells responsible for priming naive T ceils. Priming of naive T ceils is a critical event in the induction of an adaptive immune response because the differentiation of these cells determines the nature of the adaptive response whether it be a Thl, Th2 or regulatory T cell response. These different outcomes can be influenced by the effects of microbial products, including DNA, on DC. Oligonucleotides can have either stimulatory or inhibitory effects on the immune system. Therefore, we assessed the effects of DNA derived from commensal bifidobacteria, lactobacilh and Streptococcus salivarius subsp. Thermophilus on the ability of DC to stimulate naive T cells.",

Enriched DC were exposed to DNA from commensal bacteria in the probiotic preparation VSL#3 (4 lactobacilh strains, 3 bifidobacteria strains and 1 streptococcal strain), a cell wall preparation from the same probiotic bacteria or medium alone as a control. Responses of allogeneic naive CD4 + T cells were measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation. Flow cytometry was used to assess DC phenotype and viability and to detect apoptotic cells by Annexin-V/ propidinm iodide staining. Results. Irrespective of the different treatments, metrizamide-separated DC expressed high levels of costimulatory molecules (CD40, CD80, CD86) and the maturation marker CD83. However, significantly lower proliferation was observed in co-cultures of naive T cells with bacterial DNA-treated DC compared with either cultures containing DC exposed to medium alone or DC exposed to cell wall components of the same bacteria. Responses stimulated by DC exposed to medium or cell walls did not differ significantly. Viability of DC was not affected by any of the treatments, indicating that the bacterial DNA preparation was not toxic. Anuexin-V staining was negative in all T cell cultures at 4 hours and 96 hours, suggesting that the lower proliferation seen in the DNA-treated cultures is unlikely to be due to induction of apoptosis. Conclusion. DNA from the probiotic bacterial preparation VSL#3 inhibits the ability of mature DC to stimulate naive T cells possibly indicating that \"inhibitory\" CpG motifs dominate in the genome of commensal bacteria. Neither the precise function of resting intestinal eosinophfls nor the immunopathogenic mechanisms that drive resting ceils to activation is clearly understood. In eosinophilic esophagitis (EE), we hypothesized that the eosinophils infihrat -ing the esophagus are activated and that the eosinophil population present in the intestine is resting. With the aim of better understanding the mechanisms of eosinophil activation, in healthy individuals and in patients with EE, the expression of potential activation markers (CD25 and CD137, and the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and 1L-13) was determined using immunofluorescence and confocaI microscopy. Tissue specimens from the esophagus and the intestine and blood samples of healthy controls and EE patients were analyzed. In healthy individuals, 42% of intestinal eosinophils but no blood eosinophils express 11--13, suggesting a physiologic activation process in the digestive tract. With EE patients, 66% of the intestinal eosinophils express IL-13, indicating that the inflammatory response may not be restricted to the esophagus. In EE patients, approximately 60% of eosinophils infiltrating the inflamed esophageal mucosa express IL-l3, IL-4 and CD137, indicating an increased proportion of activated cells when compared to the physiologic situation. However, the numbers of CD25, CD137, and IL-4 positive intestinal eosinophils did not differ between EE patients and controls. Our original hypothesis of having resting eosinophils in normal intestinal mucosa and activated eosinophils in the inflamed esophagus proved too simple. Our current data indicate heterogeneity among eosinophils, both under non-inflammatory and inflammatory conditions. Based on these findings, we would like to suggest the following three patterns of activation of mucosal eosinophils: 1) Baseline Activation Pattern seen in the intestinal mucosa of healthy subjects and indicating that eosinophils may be actively involved in the barrier function; 2) Primary Activation Pattern observed at the inflammation site and reflecting the eosinophils' pivotal involvement in the inflammatory process; and 3) Remote Activation Pattern noted far from the inflammatory process and consistent with a systemic activation. Background & Aims: Alterations of important mucosal modulators in innate mucosal immunity such as defensins and toll like receptor (TLR) may be involved in the disruption of innate immunity. In this study, expression of various defensins and TLRs were quantified immunohistochemically in intestinal epithelium, lamina proprla, and submucosal leukocytes. Methods: Surgical specimens from 17 patients with Crohn's disease (CD), 10 with ulcerative colitis (UC), and 15 controls were fixed and cryostat sections were cut. Endogenous peroxidase activity was inactivated. Anti-human beta-defensin 2, -beta-defensin 3, -alfa-defensin 5, -alfa-defensin 6, -TLR2, -TLR4, and -TLR9 were used as primary antibodies. Sections were then stained with their appropriate sedondary antibody, either with peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat immunoglobulins, goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse immunoglobulins conjugated to peroxidase-labeled dextran polymer. Positive expression was assessed for each 1/3 region of crypt (basal, mid, and superficial) and semi-quantified as follows; 0 = none, 1 = 1 region of crypt, 2 = 2 regions of crypt, and 3 regions of crypt. Lamina propria and submucosal leukocytes were counted and expressed as positive cells / ram2. Results: alfadefensin 3 and TLR4 were significantly up regulated in CD epithelium compared to controls (p = .045, p = .0356, respectively). The number of alfa-defensin 5 positive cells was significantly larger in the lamina propria of patients with UC than in controls (p = .0281) and CD (p = .0382). The number of TLR2 positive lamina propria leukocytes was significantly larger in patients with CD than in controls (p = .001D and UC (p = .0239). Expression of these molecules on submucosal leukocytes did not show any significant differences between CD, UC, and controls. Conclusion: Differential expression of defensins and TLR represents alterations of the innate immunity in CD and UC mucosa. Epithelial expression of beta-defensin 3, TLR4, and lamina propria leukocyte expression of TLR2 characterizes alterations in the innate immunity in patients with CD.",

Superoxide dismutases (SOD) are key antioxidant enzymes, but their use in inflammatory diseases is hampered by their short circulatory half-life. AIM: Our aim was to determine whether a bactenal supply of SOD into the colon might improve an experimental colitis. We compared the effects of oral treatment with wild type or engineered Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacfllns plantamm, producing different amounts of SOD. We also tested the effects of a continuous infusion of bovine SOD in the colonic lumen. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were fitted with a catheter in the proximal colon. Colitis was induced by administration of TNBS (80 mg/kg) through the colonic catheter. Two groups of rats received a continuous intracolonic infusion of bovine SOD (40 U/rat/day) or saline for 4 days after TNBS. Five groups were treated orally with live lactic acid bacteria (109 CFU/day) or the bacterial buffer, for 4 days before and 4 days after TNBS. Lactic acid bacteria were wild type or recombinant strains over-expressing SOD (SOD + ). SOD activity of bacterial extracts was 0, 0.86, 10.7, 25.0 Units/lO ~ CFU, for wild type L. plantamm, wild type L. lactis, L. plantamm SOD +, L lactis SOD +, respectively. Rats were sacrificed 4 days after TNBS and samples of colonic tissue were taken for evaluation of macro-and microscopic damage scores, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. RESULTS: TNBS induced a weight loss of 5.8 _+ 0.8 %, macro-and microscopic colonic damages (scores: 6.9 _+ 0.6 and 15.8 _+ 1.1, respectively), and increased MPO activity (4596 -+ 485 U/g protein, vs 124 _+ 24 in controls). These alterations were significantly reduced (P<0.05) by bovine SOD colonic infusion and by oral treatment with wild type L. lactis, L. lactis SOD +, and L. plantamm SOD +. There was no significant difference (P>0.05) between the effects of the three bacteria. ]:or example, the decrease in MPO activity was 59.4, 80.3 and 61.3 % after treatment with wild type L. lactis, L. lactis SOD+ and L. plantamm SOD+, respectively. Wild type L. plantamm, which does not produce SOD, had no significant effect on TNBS-induced alterations. CONCLUSION: Lactic acid bacteria producing SOD, even in small amounts (wild type L. [actis), are effective in reducing the severity of TNBS colitis in rats. These bacteria can be considered as promising therapeutic agents in IBD. Recent studies have shown that probiotics are effective in remission maintenance in pouehins. But the mechanism by which probiotics exert ist activity is still unknown. Aim: To investigate the composition of the microflora and bacterial diversity in pouchitis biopsies before and after a probiotic therapy. Methods: Mucosa-assoc/ated pouch microflora before and after a probiotic therapy was investigated using 168 rDNA-based single-strand confirmation polymorphism (SSCP) fingerprint, cloning experiments and real-time PCR. Results: Bacterial diversity is low in pouchitis. This simplification of the flora appears to be a hallmark of active IBD (Ottet al., DDW 2004) . Diversity was restored under treatment with probiotics (p = 0.023 for comparison of diversity scores). The total number of bacterial cells in pouch biopsies was significantly increased during probiotic therapy in comparison to untreated remission (p = 0.0021). Identification of bands demonstrates that probiotics induce diversity in the anaerobic flora but no mucosal growth of the strains contained in the preparation. Conclusions: Pouchitis seems to be associated with a loss in bacterial diversity and normal anaerobic flora. Probiotic therapy may restore the normal anaerobic flora, which may be important to obtain non-inflammatory barrier functions. or placebo for 9 days prior to anti-CD3 treatment. Serum was collected and mice were sacrificed 1 or 24 hours after anti-CD 3 injection. Tissue was obtained for mRNA extraction for use in semi-quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: Histologic examination of small intestines revealed a significantly decreased mucosal damage score characterized by a decrease in apoptotic bodies (39.93 +/-14.75 in Lb + anti-CD 3 vs 60.48 +/-16.56 for anti-CD 3 alone (p < 0.0001)) and improved villous-crypt ratios (2.6 +/-0.56 in Lb + anti-CD 3 vs 1.86 +/-0.54 in anti-CD 3 alone (p<0.00001)) in mice pre-treated with Lactobacillus spp. Serum levels of interferon-F, TNF-A and IL-10 were not altered by Lb; however, mRNA isolated from the small intestine of mice treated with Lb revealed significantly decreased relative expression of interferon-F at 1 hour (0.059 fold difference compared to anti-CD 3 alone, p<0 0005) and IL-6 at 1 and 24 hours (0.22 fold compared to anti-CD 3 alone at 1 hour (p<0.005) and 0.54 at 24 hours (p<0.05)). CONCLUSIONS: Oral feeding with Lactobacillus spp. prior to the initiation of T-cell mediated bowel damage ameliorates the A-577 AGA Abstracts mucosaI damage, diminishing the apoptotic response in the small intestine. This was associated with a decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine mRNA. Funded by the CCFC and an Abbott/CAG/CIHR fellowship.",

Paneth cells, located at the base of small intestinal crypts, contain abundant microbicidal a-defensins in secretory granules. The role of these molecules in innate immunity has been demonstrated in studies of mice expressing a human a-defensin transgene. Gram + and Gram -pathogenic bacteria and their antigens induce the release of the Paneth cell a-defensins into the crypt lumen, however the potential influence of the intestinal microflora, particularly prohiotic species, on Paneth cells has not been investigated. Aim: To investigate the influence of the probiotic strain Lactobacillus casei DN-114 001 (L. casei) on Paneth cells secretory responses and to investigate the sensitivity of L. casei to a-defensins. Methods: Crypts were isolated by EDTA treatment of small intestinal segment from adult mice and exposed to live L. casei. Bactericidal assays were performed on secretions collected from crypts exposed with L. casei using the defensin-sensitive phoP-strain of S. typhimurium. Surviving bacteria were counted on plate. Mouse a-defensins (Crps) were prepared by gel permeation chromatography of intestinal acid extracts and purified to homogeneity by RP-I-IPLC. Recombinant rhesus macaque a-defensins, human a-defensin HD-5, and defensinrelated CRS1C and CRS4C peptides were expressed in E. coil and purified by HPLC. Survival of bacteria exposed to peptides for 1 h in solution was determined by counting CFU after plating. Results: L. casei DN-114 001 induced secretion by Paneth cells in isolated crypts to the same extent as induced by other species of bacteria (e.g.S. typhimurium). L. casei was more sensitive to Crp3 than to a mixture of Crps 1-6, and log-phase L. casei were more sensitive to Crp4 than stationary phase cells. The sensitivity of L. casei to rhesus macaque a-defensins and HD-5 was approximately the same and similar to Crp sensitivity. Two mouse a-defensinrelated gene products, CRS1C and CRS4C, are exclusive to Paneth cells and were bactericidal against S. aureus and E. coli but not against L. casei. Conclusion: L. casei induced a-defensins release from crypt Paneth cells and was sensitive to a-defensins from mouse, Rhesus macaque and human Paneth cells. These observations may reflect one mechanism by which probiotics may increase resistance to intestinal pathogens.",

We utilized this agent in patients with proximal inflammation of the small bowel and report our ongoing results. METHODS: 20 patients with symptoms consistent with Inflammatory Bowel Disease and a negative GI evaluation underwent capsule endoscopy which revealed inflammatory changes mostly in the proximal small bowel. Each of these patients received 20 to 40 cc's PO BID of E-Coli M17 containing 10 to the seventh live bacteria per cc. (ProBactrix, The BioBalance Corp) for 4 to 6 weeks. Two patients discontinued this Probiotic agent after 10 to 14 days and were placed on 5 ASA preparations. 6 patients did not experience any improvement on Probactrix. Three of these patients underwent a follow up capsule endoscopy study. The remaining 12 patients reported improvement or very significant improvement following treatment with Probactrix. All of these 12 patients underwent a follow-up capsule endoscopy after completing a 4 to 6 week course of the Probiotic agent. The CE studies were initially read in a non-blinded fashion by two experienced capsule endoscopists. The CE studies were then read in a blinded fashion by another experienced capsule endoseopist. The blinded reader was given the cases in pairs de-identified with respect to identity and date. The order with respect to pre and post-treatment was randomized as well. RESULTS: i2 out of 18 patients had a good or a very good clinical response to the Probiotic agent with marked reduction in abdominal symptoms and improvement in well being. In these 12 patients, initial CE revealed inflammation in the proximal small bowel and significant improvement post-treatment. 2 of these 12 responders with normal small bowel biopsies and positive celiac serology screening had the celiac serologies return to normal after the course of ProBactrix. Two of the patients did not improve and CE was unchanged pre and post treatment. One reported a progression of symptoms and CE revealed worsening inflammation post therapy. All findings were consistent among all three readers. CONCLUSIONS: 1. E-Coil M17 has been demonstrated endoscopically to have a healing effect on small bowel mucosa in some patients with proximal inflammation of the small bowel. 2. CE is a valuable tool to measure therapeutic response in small bowel inflammatory disease.",

Methods: The effects of culture supernatants or heat-killed bacteria of Bacillus mesentericus TO-A (BM), Strcptococcas faecalis %110 (SF), and Clostridium butyricutn TO-A (CB) on HT-29 human colonic epithelial cells were examined. Colonic epithelial cells were treated with each culture supematant or heat-killed bacteria, with or without Thl cytokines, and TLR4 mRNA and GAPDH mRNA were evaluated by real-time PCR. The active agents in the culture supematant were determined by HPLC. Results: Treatment with CB supematant significantly reduced TLR4 mRNA level (16 \u00b1 8%) compared with untreated controls (100%), whereas BM or SF supematant induced no significant changes in TLR4 mRNA level. None of the heat-killed bacteria altered the TLR4 mRNA level. IFN~/at 100 p,g/ml upregulated TLR4 mRNA (191 \u00b1 18%). Interestingly, CB supematant significantly reduced TLR4 mRNA level (21 \u00b1 6%) even in the presence of lFN'y. The CB supematant was analyzed to determine the active elements responsible for TLR4 mRNA downregulation. HPLC showed that CB supernatant included 0.4 mM formic acid, 0.8 mM acetic acid, and 1.4 mM butyric acid. Colonic epithelial cells were treated with these organic acids separately or in combination. TLR4 mRNA was significantly suppressed (15-16%) only when cells were treated with solutions containing butyric acid. Conclusion: The culture supernatant of Clostndiam butyricum, but not heat-killed bacteria, reduces TLR4 mRNA level in human colonic epithelial cells. Butyric acid produced by Clostndium butyricum was the active agent responsible for this suppression of TLR4 mRNA. Our results indicated that probiotics including Clostridium butyricum are effective for downregulating TLR4 in human colonic epithelial cells.",

Coli Nissle 1917 (EeN) Inhibits Activation and Adhesion of Peripheral T-cells to Extracellular Matrix Andreas Sturm, Klaus Rilling, Joflarma Harder-d'Heureuse, Daniel Baumgart, Bertram Wiedenmann, Axel Dignass BACKGROUND: EcN has been shown to serve as an effective maintenance treatment for ulcerative colitis and pouchitis. We have previously demonstrated that EcN inhibits the cell cycle of peripheral blood T-cells (PBT), but not of lamina propria T-cells. We hypothesized now, that EcN inhibits activation and recruiting of activated PBT into the intestinal mucosa by down-regulating their activation and adhesion to ECM that are involved in the recruitment of T<ells from the circulating blood into the intestinal mucosa. METHODS: PBT were stimulated with cross-linked anti-CD3 mAb and cultured in the absence or presence of sterile filtered EcN supernatants. Flow cytometry analysis was used to assess CD28, CD69, CD80, CD86, TCR-oe/LB, TCR-'y/B, and integrin expression. Cytokine secretion was measured by CBA analysis and adhesion of PBT to the ECM components fibronectin and collagen by using an adhesion assay based on luminometric analysis of fiuorescently labelled cells. RESULTS: Supernatants of EcN significantly inhibited the activation of PBT in a dosedependent fashion following CD3 stimulation (0 vol% EcN: 35\u00b13.1% CD69+ cells; 25 vol%: 12 \u00b1 2.9% CD69 + cells: 50 vol%: 7 + 1.9% CD69 + cells). In addition, the expression of co-stimulatory molecules CD28, CD80 or CD86 was significantly down-regulated by ECN (CD28:58 \u00b1 4.7%, CD80: 65-+ 6.1% or CD86:53 \u00b1 8.5%). Culture of PBT with EcN supematants also resulted in a relative increase of TCR-'y/8 + cells from 6.4 to 14% of the T-cell population. Furthermore, the synthesis of pro-inflammatory TNF-a by PBT was significantly reduced (mean: 38 \u00b1 6.2%), while the secretion of anti-inflammatory IL-IO was significantly enhanced (mean: 69 \u00b1 9.7%). Finally, EcN inhibited adhesion of PBT to collagen and fibronectin (mean: 32 \u00b1 7.3% and mean: 43 \u00b1 8.0%, respectively), maybe caused by an downregulation of integrin-[31 expression by EcN (mean: l 5 \u00b1 3.7%). CONCLUSION: Cellfree snpernatants of EcN inhibit the activation of PBT by down-regulating co-stimulator)' molecules necessary to fully activate T-cells and modulate the production of pro-and antiinflammatory cytokines by PBT. Furthermore, a decreased expression of the integrin-151 may result in reduced adhesion of PBT to collagen and fibronectin that may ultimately cause a decreased recruitment of activated PBT to the side of intestinal inflammation. This data provide further evidence that probiotic bacteria broadly influence the human immune system and may explain their beneficial effect in intestinal inflammation. . We analyzed the cellular responses induced by gram-negative E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) and gram-positive Lactobacillus acidophilus PZI041 in T84 cells. After co-incubation with the probiotic strainS ~300 genes are differentially regulated. Expression of 15 genes was verified by quantitative real-time PCR (LightCycler technology) and by Western blotting. Probiotic effects on the barrier function of IECs were monitored by measuring tranSepithelial resistance (TER). EcN affects the transcription of genes representing the NF-kB signaling pathway such as IKB, IKK1, MIP3A, altering expression of inflammatory cytokines. Since the expression of genes for the tight junction proteins piinn and ZO-2 involving the PKC pathway were also upregulated by contact with EcN, colonic physiologic function and barrier integrity appeared to be positively modulated by this probiotic in vivo. With L. acidophilus PZ1041 similar genes are effected but to a lesser or even reverse extend (IKB). Our data provide insights into the molecular mechanisms by which EcN and L. acidophilus PZ1041 might modulate the clinical characteristics of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) (Crohns disease and ulcerative colitis) which result from an aggressive immune response to the resident microflora. Furthermore, the effect of EcN on gene expression of tight junction proteins may explain why this strain exerts a protective effect against enteroinvasive pathoge N in cell culture models. DNA micmarray analyses of gene expression will lead to the development of new strategies in the treatment of IBDs and infectious diseases.",

            "text": "Lactobacillus Probiotics appear to be beneficial in IBD, but their mechanism of action is poorly understood. Lactobacillus brevis (LB) and Streptococcus thermophilus (ST) are two pmbiorics with high levels of sphingomyelinase (SMAse), an enzyme leading to ceramide-mediated apoptosis. We investigated whether CD LPMC undergo SMAse-dependent apoptosis and, because activated immune cells are more susceptible to cell death, whether this form of apoptosis depends on the degree of cell activation. LPMC were obtained from control and CD patients, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from healthy volunteers. Fresh PBMC were used as resting or activated cells after stimulation with anti-CD3 + CD28. Bacterial sonicates were obtained from LB, ST, and a non-pathogenic E. coli (EC). LPMC and PBMC ceils were exposed to bacterial sonicates (1 mg protein/ml_), ceramide (30 ~g/mL), or medium alone for 24 hours. In some experiments, sonicates were preincubated with 5 mM glutathion to inhibit SMAse activity. Apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry of propidium iodidestained cells and expressed as % apoptotic cells. LB and ST sonicates induced significantly (p<0.05) more apoptosis in CD (59_+3 and 44-+3%, respectively) than control LPMC (31 _+ 6 and 18 -+ 4%), but less in PBMC (18 -+ 1 and 9 -+ 2%, respectively). Stimulation with anti-CD3 + CD28 induced a time-dependent increase in LB-and ST-induced apoptosis (27, 35, and 51% for LB, and 17, 20, and 22% for ST at 24, 48 , and 72 hours, respectively). EC sonicates failed to induce apoptosis of all cell types, regardless of activation state, while ceramide induced apoptosis in all cells. Inhibition of SMAse by glutathion markedly reduced LB-and ST-induced apoptosis of LPMC. Enhanced apoptosis of CD LPMC appears to be a selective effect of the probiotics LB and ST, since other enteric bacteria like EC, fail to enhance apoptosis. Probiotic-induced apoptosis is SMAse-mediated and activation-dependent. These results suggest that induction of immune cell apoptosis is one of the mechanisms mediating the therapeutic effects of probiotics in 1BD.",

We have recently demonstrated the ability of E. coli Nissle 1917 to induce the human beta defensin-2 in CaCo-2 cells. Our aim was to investigate the E. coli Nissle mediated transcriptional regulation of the hBD-2 gene. Methods: To study the activation of the hBD-2 promoter and putative binding sites for NF-kB by E. coli Nissle, Luciferase reporter gene assays were applied. After transfection of CaCo-2 cells with the respective plasmids for 24 h, cells were incubated with E. coli Nissle and other strains, whose influence on hBD-2 expression had been predefmed by real time PCR. To prove the direct impact of NF-kB, a hBD-2 promoter plasmid with 2 mutated binding sites of NF-kB (-186/-205 and -572/-596) was used for transfection Results: The hBD-2 promoter Was activated by E. coli Nissle as well as by an uropathogenic E coil strain, analogous to hBD-2 transcript induction in real time PCR Remarkably, the bacterial supematant prompted a 13 fold higher promoter activation compared to bacterial pellets A NF kB reporter plasmid was moderately activated only by E. coli Nissle Additionally, the supematant had the strongest capacity to activate NF-kB mediated transcription. After mutation of two NF-kB binding sites, hBD-2 promoter activation by complete bacteria, bacterial supernatant and the positive control IL-1 beta was almost completely blocked Discussion: The abrogation of hBD-2 promoter activation by E. cofi Nissle following insertion of mutated NF-kB sites indicates an important role of this transcription factor The induction of the antimicrobial peptide hBD-2 through moderate activation of NF-kB represents a novel mode of probiotic action.",

Recent research has led to rapid advances in the application of molecular techniques based on 16S ribosomal RNA/DNA (rRNA/DNA) gene sequences to study the microbial diversity. Methods: Feces were collected from patients suffering from ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. Fecal pellets were immediately placed into the anaerobic dilution buffer. The intestinal flora was analyzed using selective media in the anaerobic chamber. Colonies of the organisms were counted and bacterial counts were expressed lOgl0COlony-forming units (CFU) per gram wet weight feces. Moreover, DNA extracted from feces was analyzed by full-automatic flora analyzing system using DNA extracted from pure culture and enumerated each bacteria as an external standard. SYBR Green I was used as the fluorescent substance and ABI PRISM 7900HT was used as the detection equipment for PCR. Results: Bifidobactrerium, Bacteroidaceae and Enterobacteriaceae were decreaced, and Lactobacillus and Enterococcus were increased in IBD patients. Using full-automatic flora analyzing system, Bacteroides fragilis group was quantitatively decreased, contrary to the previous reports. Interestingly, although B. vulgatus and B. ovatus were decreased in accordance with decrease of B. fragtlis group, B. fragllis was not affected quantitatively. Bacteroides vulgatus was the most dominant bacteria not only in IBD patients but also in healthy control. The Activity or extent of disease of UC did not affect Bacteroides species and predominant flora quantitatively. Similarly, corticosteroids (PSL 10mg-30mg / daily) or probiorics (Bifidobacterium and/or Lactobacillus 3x107 ~ lx109 daily) did not affect Bacteroides species and predominant flora quantitatively. Conclusion: We developed full-automatic flora analyzing system using quantitative PCR with genus or species specific primers based on 16S rDNA gene sequences. Using this system, more than 90% of bacteria are identified as known cluster or species within hours. These results suggest that this system is useful for analysis of intestinal flora and intestinal flora of 1BD patients is different from that of normal subjects.",

A Pilot Study Paolo GionchettL Femando Rizzello, Claudia Morselli, Gilberto Pierangeli, Filippo Pierangeli, Rossella Romagnofi, Federica Ugolini, Silvio Laureti, Massimo Campieri Background: Pouchitis is the major long-term complication after ileal-pouch anal anastomosis (IPAA) for ulcerative colitis (UC). Broad-spectruR a antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment in this condition. Recently we have shown the efficacy of a highly concentrated probiotic preparation (VSL#3; 300 billions/g lyophilised viable bacteria) in preventing relapses of chronic pouchitis and in preventing pouchitis onset. Aim: to evaluate the efficacy of VSL#3 12g/day in the treatment of mildly active pouchitis Methods: twelve consecutive patients with mild pouchitis (defined as a score between 7 to 12 in the Ponchitis Disease Activity Index (PDAI) which include clinical endoscopic and histological criteria) were treated with VSL#3 6g b.i.d for 1 month. PDAI and quality of life score (Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire, IBDQ) were assessed before and at the end of the study period. Results: Eight of 12 patients (66.6%) were in remission (defined as a PDA1 score -<7) with a significant decrease of mean total PDAI score from 10.5 (range 10-12) to 5 (range 3-7) (p< 0.01), 3 were unchanged (mean PDAI score from 11 to 12.5) and one patient was dropped out for non compliance to the treatment. Median IBDQ score improved significantly in patients in remission from 128 (range, 104-160) to 210 (range, 196-220) (p< 0,05).

In a 3-dimensional morphogenesis model, ROCK induced analogous F-actin aggregates in addition to abnormal filopodial-bke protrusions. \"\u00a3-27632 treatment evoked a significant reduction in di-phospho-myosin light chain (MLC) levels in migrating epithelial cells. The actin aggregates but not the filopodiallike protrusions could be mimicked by direct inhibition of MLC kinase with ML-7 (20~M). Y-27632-induced protrusions could not be reversed by the c-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor, STI-571 (IOI~M); or following expression of dominant-negative Cdc42. However, ROCK inhibition was associated with reduced phosphorylation (and thus reduced inactivation) of cofilin through LlM-kinase 1. Actin-rich protrusions induced by Y-27632 were partially reversed by overexpression of LIM-kinase 1. We conclude that the ROCK effectors MLC kinase and klM-kinase 1 orchestrate distinct responses during coordinated epithelial cell motility, primarily regulating cdl-mat~x adhesion and protrusion respectively. Using monolayers of intestinal Caco-2 cells, we reported that activation of an inflammatory mediator, NF-KB and degradation of its modulator I-KB-a are required for oxidant-induced disruption of BF and that EGF protects against this injury. But the molecular mechanisms are unclear. Because the 131 isoform of PKC is key in monolayer integrity, we hypothesized that PKC-131 activation is critical to EGF protection against oxidant-induced NF-KB activation and consequences of NF-t\u00a2B activation, namely cytoskeletal disassembly & barrier dysfunction. METHODS We used the first, multiple sets of GI clones created by stable transfection to over-express PKC-{~I or to inhibit its expression. Clones were then pretreated with EGF or PKC activator (e.g, DAG analog, OAG) -+ oxidant H202. We assessed: monolayer BF; stability and molecular dynamics of F & G-actin cytoskeletons; subcellular distribution and in vitro kinase activity of PKC-131 isoform; levels & phosphorylation of 1-KBa; nuclear translocation & activity of NF-KB subunits (p65 / pS0), n = 6/grp. RESULTS ~A~ Relative to wild (WT) monolayers exposed to oxidant alone, the transfected clones stably overexpressing PKC-131 (3.1 fold) were protected against oxidative damage by low, previously non-protective doses of EGF or PKC activator as indicated by enhanced native PKC-131 isoform activity~ suppressed NF-KB subunits (p65 / p50) nuclear translocation & activation; reduced 1-KBa degradation & phosphorylation; enhanced F-actni assembly (decreased Gactin pool); increased actin cytoskeletal stability; and enhanced BF to near normal. ~B<< PKC-131 overexpression induced stabilization of I-KBct & inactivation of NF-KB was potentiated by EGP or OAG. In these clones low doses of these modulators led to increases in PKC-~I in the particulate fractions, indicating activation of -131 isoform. <C~ Anti-sense transfection to stably inhibit native PKC-~I activity (-99%) substantially inhibited all measures of EGFmediated protection against NF-KB activation and monolayer F-actin & barrier dysfunction. We show for the first time that 1) Activation of PKCq31 is crucial to EGF-mediated protection against oxidative stress of NF-KB activation; 2) PKC-131 is a unique intracellular modulator of I-KBet in intestinal cells; 3) We have thus discovered a novel biologic mechanism -inhibition of the dynamics of NF-KB and cytoskeletal/barder instability--among the classical subfamily of PKC isoforms in cells",

Recent reports indicate that specific fraction of bone marrow cells contribute to the regeneration of intestinal interstitial ceils and epithelium after mucosal damage. In this process, HPCs homing in intestinal mucosa is essential and require adhesive interactions with vascular endothelinm, which are not fully understood. In this study, we examined CD34 + bone marrow ceils migration in microvessels of small intestinal mncosa in vivo with or without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) treatment, and investigated the role of adhesion molecules. Methods: HPCs were isolated as CD34 + cells by magnetic cell sorting from tibias and femurs of male C57BL/6 mice. LPS was administered intraperitoneally into some of host mice three hours before CD34 + cells administration. CD34 + cells were labeled with carboxyfluorescein snccinimidyl ester and administered into control mice or LPS treated mice via tail vein. CD34 + ceils migration in postcapillary venules (PCVs) of Peyer's patches (PPs), villus microvessel, and submucosal venules were monitored using intravital microscope. Rolling and adherence of CD34 + ceils were quantified and compared.",

In addition to their antimicrobial role, the position of Paneth ceils at the base of intestinal crypts adjacent to intestinal stem ceils and their lifespan of 20 days, place these ceils in an advantageous position to act as a sentinel of intestinal stem cells and to influence the stem cell microenvironment. We hypothesize that cytotoxic damage in the stem cell zone elicits a secretory response of Paneth cells. This hypothesis was tested by assessing the response of Paneth cells following administration of the chemotherapeutic drug, adriamycin. Methods: Adult [emale C57B1/6 mice were treated i.p. with a single injection of adriamycin (20 rag/ kg body weight), and jejunal tissue was collected between 2 and 120 h later. Tissue sections were evaluated for damage and scored for numbers of Paneth and apoptotic cells. Incorporation of BrdU into crypt epithelium was quantitated at 6 and 24 h. Results: Evaluation of H&E stained sections revealed that gross mucosal damage occurred between 48 and 72 h after a single dose of adriamycin and persisted until 120 h after injection when newly formed crypts could were observed. An earlier response to adriamycin could be seen in the epithelium where numbers of apoptotic cells increased as early as 2 h, peaked at 6 h, and returned to near normal levels by 24 h after injection. In addition, Paneth cells increased in number at the crypt base by 6 h as assessed by H&E and lysozyme immunohistochemistry. Panetb cell numbers remained elevated at 48 h after injection and were found not only in the crypt base but along the sides of the crypt. Paneth cells were present in degenerating crypts between 72 and 96 b and could also be found at the base of newly formed crypts at 120 h post injection.

Similarly, hypoxia-reoxygenation (HR) of intestinal ceils in vitro can impair cellular function. Protein kinase C (PKC) has been shown to mediate hypoxia (H)-induced damage to various cell types. Whether PKC plays a similar role in intestinal cells is unknown. The present study examined the role of various PKC isoforms in enterocyte viability in response to H and HR. Methods: The human intestinal epithelial cell line, SCBN was used. Cells were subjected to hypoxia (95% N2/5% CO2) for periods up to 18 hr. Some groups of cells were subsequently reoxygenated by exposure to room air and 5% CO2. Furthermore, some groups were pretreated with either selective PKC inhibitors or agonist peptides prior to H or HR challenge. Viability was estimated by formazan dye reduction. Apoptosis was determined histochemically, by determination of the degradation of polyADP-ribnse polymerase (PARP), part of the signaling cascade of apoptosis and by cytochrome C translocation (an index of mitochondrial injury). Results: H and HR resulted in activation of PKCet, 8 and e in SCBN cells. Cell viability decreased as the duration of H increased. R resulted in a further decline in viability. PKC activation via phorbol ester treatment exacerbated injury in response to H and HR. Inhibitors of PKCa and e reduced the degree of cell injury while PKC8 antagonism exacerbated this response. Treatment with a selective PKC8 agonist decreased the extent of damage. H was associated with morphological changes to the cells including cell shrinkage and nuclear deformation. R increased apoptosis as evidenced by an increase in the appearance of nuclear condensation and fragmentation. Treatment with a specific PKCe~ agonist increased the early cellular and nuclear deformation associated with hypoxia but did not alter apoptotic changes induced by R. In contrast, PKC8 agonism decreased apoptosis in response to HR challenge. Hinduced cytochrome c release was reversed by a PKCe antagonist while PARP degradation after HR was abolished by a PKC8 agonist. Conclusions: Different PKC isoforms appear to be involved in cell injury and apoptosis in response to HR challenge to human intestinal ceils. PKCa and e appear to be involved in the injurious response to HR challenge while PKC8 appears to play a protective role in this model of intestinal ceil injury.",

Promising results have recently been obtained with probiotic therapy in UC. Orally administered lactulose has been shown to increase the colonic levels of Lactobactllns species in association with probiotic activity. The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of lactulose on a rat UC model induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Methods: Experimental colitis was induced in male Wistar rats by 3% DSSsolution added to drinking water for 7 days. Lactulose (300-1000 mg/kg) was administered PO twice daily for 6 days. Metrunidazole (10 and 30 mg/kg) was used as a reference drug, giving PO twice daily for 6 days. Colonic ulceration area, colon length, body weight changes, diarrhea/bloody feces, colonic mucosal myeloperoxidase activity (MPO), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and histology were examined. Results: DSS-treatment of control animals resulted in severe colonic lesions accompanied by diarrhea, bloody feces, decrease of body weight, shortening of colon length, and increase in MPO activity as well as TBARS, were due to Ca ~+ alone, crypts were perfused with Ca2+-free Ringer's, then exposed to NHzC1 (200mM), in the presence or absence of TPEN (20mM), a high-affinity chelator of heavy metals (Ka for Zn 2+ -3 x 10I6M). TPEN significantly delayed (2.5 +/-0.8-fold increase in time required to achieve maximum response) and attenuated (57 +/-8% of maximum response in control conditions) responses to NHzC1 (n = 5). NHzCl-induced change in [M 2+ ], was prevented with pre-treatment of 1 mM DTT (n = 5), implicating thiol groups as NH~CI targets. In crypts perfused with Ca2\u00f7-free Ringer's, and exposed to thapsigargin, which depletes the major intracellular Ca 2+ store (endoplasmic reticulum), responses to NH2CI were attenuated (n = 5 Background and aims. The mechanisms underlying damage and impaired healing in ulcerative colitis (UC) have yet to be defined. Transglutaminases (TG) are a family of enzymes which catalyze protein cross-linking and are associated with increased tissue stabilization and wound healing. Expression of keratinocyte transglntaminase (TGk), resulting in crosslinked protein envelopes in comified epidermal cells, is required for barrier function in terminally differentiating stratified squamous epithelia. In this study, we looked at a possible role of this isoenzyme in intestinal mucosa integrity in UC patients. Patients and methods. Endoscopic and histologic indices were studied in 26 patients with UC (10 active and 16 inactive) and in 20 normal controls undergoing colonoscopy. TGk protein content and mRNA expression in the colon were evaluated by Western blot analysis and semiquantitative RT-PCR, respectively. The colonic location of TGk was evaluated by immunohistochemistry using specific monoclonal antibody. Results. We showed for the first time, the presence of TGk in normal colonic mucosa. In control subjects, an increasing number of epithelial cells positive for TGk were observed by immunohistochemistry from the base to the upper crypt; the staining was less pronounced in inactive patients and surprisingly absent in active UC.",

We hypothesized that the barrier protects proliferating cells from luminal acid-hase extremes: The colonic lumen contains -60% CO2, an elevated level that may be deleterious to proliferating epithelial ceils. Using cultured cell models known to lack an appreciable barrier, we sought to determine if elevated CO2 induces apoptosis and/or necrosis. Methods: T84, HT29 (both colon cancer) and IEC-6 (immortalized intestinal crypt-like) cell lines were cultured in standard 10% BSA-supplemented-DMEM under normoxic conditions with either 5% or 30% CO2. At 6, 24, 48, and 72h, cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for surface annexin-V (apoptosis), propidium iodide staining (necrosis), and mitochondrial membrane potential (AWm) using JC-1. Caspase-3 was assayed fiuorimetrically to confirm apoptosis. Results: T84 cells grown under 5% COL conditions displayed a modest, gradual increase in apoptosis from 6h to 72h (7.5 +/-1.2% to 8.8 +/-1.2% at 72h) and necrosis (8.6 +/-0.7% to 13.7 +/-0.6% at 72h) consistent with normal cell turnover. In contrast, 30% COL doubled the rate of apoptosis by 48h (annexin positive ceils rose from 8.4 +/-1.1% to 15.8 +/-2.7%) and tripled by 72h (24.4 +/-1.7% annexin positive cells). By 6h, caspase-3 activity increased in cells exposed to 30% COL (vs. 5%) and tripled by 72h; also by 72h, 30% COL doubled necrosis (PI 23.6 +/-0.7%). A~m remained normal despite prolonged exposure to either 5 or 30% COL. Further, under ambient COSree conditions at pH 6.9 (the measured pH of the standard DMEM solution under 30% COL conditions), there was no increase in apoptosis or necrosis by 48h, but there was an acute decrease in AWm consistent with early mitochondrial injury.

Schmidt Background/Aims: Variona studies have suggested that Glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2), secreted from the enteroendocrine cells in the gastrointestinal tract after food intake, is able to decrease mucosal injury in setting of human disorders characterized by injury and dysfunction of the intestinal mucosal epithelium. We evaluated the potential of GLP-2 after epithelial injury by using an in vitro model. Methods: Wounds were induced by using a razor blade in confluent IEC-6, IEC-18 and Caco-2 and Colo 320 monolayers. Afterwards GLP-2 was supplemented to the media. Wound healing was investigated after 24 hours by microscopic quantification of number of cells migrating across the wound edge. Proliferation was assessed by using photometric mitochondrial incorporation measurement of MTT. Monoclonal TGFq3rantibodies (10 Ixg/ml) were added to wounded monolayers to neutralize the effect of GLP-2 induced TGF-131 mediated wound healing. Results: GLP-2 induced a significant increase of Migration in IEC-6 and IEC-18 monolayers compared to the control group (ANOVA, post-hoc test, p< 0.01). No effect was observed in the colon-cancer derived cell hnes Caco-2 and Colo 320. MTT-Proliferation assays revealed a significant dose dependent increase in Proliferation after GLP-2 stimulation in the colo 320 colon-cancer cell line while no effect was detectable in IEC-6 and -18 cells. Neutralization experiments with anti-TGF-[~ lead to a total inhibition of GLP-2 induced migration of wounded small intestinal monolayers. Conclusion: These results indicate that GLP-2 exerts its reparative action by induction of TGF-131 secretion in IEC 6 and -18 cells, which seems to be the responsible factor for the improved epithelial wound healing. Thus GLP-2 or analogues of this peptide may potentially useful for the treatment of variona gut disorders characterized by injury or inflammation and ineffective repair of intestinal mucosa.",

Since inhibition of COX-1 was accompanied by COX-2 expression, it is assumed that prostaglandins (PGs) produced by COX-2 contribute to the mucosal integrity under adverse conditions induced by COX-1 inhibition. On the other hand, NO produced by constitutive NO synthase (cNOS) plays an important role in maintaining the mucosal integrity of the small intestine, mimicking the role for PGs produced by COX-1. If so, intestinal damage might be induced by inhibition of both cNOS and COX-2. In the present study, we examined whether intestinal damage is provoked under inhibition of both cNOS and COX-2 and whether COX-2 expression is up-regulated under conditions of NO deficiency. Methods: Male SD rats were used. L-NAME (10-50 mg/kg: cNOS/iNOS inhibitor), aminognanidine (20 mg/kg: iNOS inhibitor), SC-560 (10 mg/kg: selective COX-1 inhibitor) or rofecoxib (10 mg/kg: selective COX-2 inhibitor) was given PO, either alone or in combination, and the animals were killed 24 h later. Analysis of COX-2 mRNA was performed by RT-PCR. Results: Neither L-NAME nor aminoguanidine alone provoked damage in the small intestine within 24 h, yet L-NAME when administered together with rofecoxib produced gross lesions in a L-arginine-sensitive manner. Following administration of L-NAME the expression of COX-2 mRNA was up-regulated in the intestinal mucosa, and the PGE2 content was increased 12 h later, in both a rofecoxiband a L-arginine-dependent manner. L-NAME enhanced intestinal motility, decreased mucus secretion, and increased bacterial invasion in the mucosa. The up-regulation of COX-2 expression as well as PGE2 production following L-NAME was inhibited by prior administration of atropine, at a dose that inhibited the intestinal hypermotility caused by L-NAME. In addition, the intestinal lesions induced by L-NAME plus rofecoxib were prevented by pretreatment with ampicillin and atropine as well as aminognanidine. Conclusion: These results suggest that inhibition of both cNOS and COX-2 provokes intestinal damage, similar to inhibition of both COX-1 and COX-2. Inhibition of cNOS, similar to COX-1, up-regulates COX-2 expression in the intestine, the process being associated with intestinal hypermotility and bacterial invasion, and this may be a key to the occurrence of intestinal damage associated with COX-2 inhibition.",

We have recently reported that PGs produced by both COX-1 and COX-2 are important in maintaining the mucosal integrity of small intestine against NSAID-induced damage, yet the role of PGs in healing of the intestinal ulcers remains unknown. In the present study, we examined the roles of PG/COX in healing of indomethacin-induced intestinal ulcers in rats, using selective COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitors. Methods: Male SD rats were used. Intestinal ulcers were induced by a single injection of indomethacin (10 mg/kg, SC), and the animals were killed 7 days after the administration. Various COX inhibitors (SC-560:3 mg/kg, rofecoxib: 3 rag/ kg, SC-560 plus rofecoxib) were given PO twice daily for 6 days or for 3 days, either from 1 day (early stage) or 4 days (late stage) after ulceration. Expression of COX-2 mRNA in the mucosa was examined by RT-PCR, while PGE2 content was measured by E1A. Results: Intestinal ulcers induced by indomethacin healed within 7 days, the ulcer area decreasing from about 200 ram2 to less than 25 mm2. All drugs tested significantly delayed the healing of intestinal ulcers when they were given for 6 days. However, when they were given for the early 3 days, the healing was significantly delayed by indomethacin and rofecoxib but not SC-560. In contrast, the healing was impaired by both indomethacin and SC-560 but not rofecoxib when they were given in the late 3 days. The COX-2 mRNA was up-regnlated in the intestinal mucosa from 1 day after ulceration throughout 6 days, yet the intensity being most potent on day 1 and diminishing thereafter. Mucosal PGJ~2 content significantly decreased at 3 h after administration of indomethacin, recovered gradually within 24 h, and significantly increased over normal levels on 2nd and 3rd days after ulceration. The increased pGE2 content observed 2 days after ulceration was significantly decreased by rafecoxib but not SC-560, but that on day 5 was suppressed by SC-560 but not rofecoxib. Conclusion: Endogenous PGs produced by both COX-1 and COX-2 play a role in healing of intestinal ulcers, but the role of COX isozyme actively involved in this process may be different depending on the stage of healing, COX-2 in the early stage and COX-1 in the late stage.",

Recent studies demonstrated that gastrointestinal ulcerogenic properties of NSA1Ds are accounted for by the inhibition of both cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2.

Methods: Experimental colitis was induced in male Wistar rats by daily treatment with 2.5% DSS in drinking water for 6 days. Indomethacin (a non selective COX inhibitor, 1 mg/kg), SC-560 (a selective COX-1 inhibitor, 3 mg/kg) or celecoxib (a selective COX-2 inhibitor, 3 mg/kg) was given PO twice daily during DSS treatment; either consecutively for 6 days, early 3 days or late 3 days. The expression of COX-1 and COX-2 mRNA in the colonic mucosa was examined by RT-PCR. Mucosal PGE2 content was measured by EIA. Results: Daily treatment with 2.5% DSS for 6 days caused mucosal lesions in the colon, with a decrease in body weight gain and colon length as well as an increase of MPO activity. Daily administration of indomethacin, SC-560 and celecoxib for 6 days all worsened the severity of DgS-induced colonic damage with increased MPO activity. Likewise, the damage was aggravated by 5C-560 given for early but not late 3 days, or celecoxib given for late but not early 3 days during DSS treatment, lndomethacin, given for either early or later 3 days, both worsened the colonic lesions. The expression of COX-2 mRNA was up-regulated in the colon on day 5 during DSS treatment, with a significant increase of PGE2 production. The PGE2 content in the normal mucosa was inhibited by indomethacin and SC-560 but not celecoxth, while that on day 5 during DSS treatment was suppressed by indomethacin and cdecoxib but not SC-560. Conclusion: These results suggest that endogenous PGs produced by both COX-1 and COX-2 afford protection against DSS-induced colonic lesions; COX-1/PG is involved in the early period (development phase), while COX-2/PG in the later period (extension and/or repair phase). Thus, a caution should be paid for the use of selective COX-2 inhibitors as well as NSAIDs in patients with ulcerative colitis.",

Intestinal epithelial cells (Caco-2) were seeded in Transwell filters (12 wells) at a density of 70000/wdh The next day, filters were placed in culture with EGCs or without EGCs (control) and maintained in culture up to three days. Caco-2 proliferation was assessed by 3H thymidine incorporation and measuring resistance. The tight junction associated protein ZO-1 was assessed in Caco-2 at the protein (immunohistochemistry) and mRNA level (RT-PCR). Results: Cocufiure of Caco-2 with EGCs induced a significant increase in cell proliferation as compared to control (Caco-2 cultured alone). Indeed, after 24h coculture of Caco-2 with EGCs, there was a 27 +/-6% increase in thymidine incorporation as compared to control (p<0.05; n = 5). Concomitantly, the number of Caco-2 cells was signlficandy increased by 29 +/-10% (n= 3) as compared to comrol. This effect was also associated with an increase in the resistance of the Transwell filter by 420 +/-230% (n-5) after 48h and 966 +/-450% (n = 4) after 72h when Caco was cultured with EGCs as compared to control. The effects of culturing Caco-2 with EGCs were reproduced by conditioned medium of EGCs cultured alone. In addition, when Caco was cocuhured with EGCs there was a significant decrease of 65 +/-30% in ZO-1 mRNA as compared to control. This effect was associated with a cytoplasmic redistribution of ZO-1 associated to actin filaments. Conclusion: Our results suggest that EGCs are involved in the regulation of intestinal cell proliferation and intestinal bamer permeability. The mechanism and factors responsible for these effects remain unknown but could involve ZO-1 and play an important role in the repair processes of the intestinal barrier following an aggression.",

            "text": "Effect of PKC Activation on Intracellular Ca :\u00f7 Signaling and Integrity of Intestinal Epithelial Cells Barry Tepperman, Brian Douglas Soper, Qing Chang Background Protein kinase C (PKC) activation has been associated with tissue injury including colonic inflammation and can compromise the integrity of isolated intestinal epithelial cells (Am. J. Physiol. 276:G583,1999) . In addition, increases in cytosofic Ca 2+ can also reduce gastrointestinal cellular integrity (Dig. Dis. Sci. 44: 697,1999) . Furthermore. it has been demonstrated in a number of cellular systems that PKC activation can alter cellular Ca > homeostasis and increase Ca '-+ levels (J. Physiol. 529: 159,2000; J. Biol. Chem. 271: 21522,1996) . Therefore, in the present study we have examined the effects of PKC activation on intestinal cellular integrity and the role of Ca > in this response. Furthermore, we have also examined the effect of specific PKC isoforms on these responses. Methods The rat intestinal epithelial cell line, IEC-18 was used in these studies. Cells were incubated in the presence of the PKC activator phorbol myristate acetate (PMA; 0.1-1.0 I.M). In some experiments cells were incubated in Ca 2+-free medium. Cell viability was assessed by trypan blue uptake or alamar blue dye exclusion. Cellular Ca 2 \u00f7 signaling was assessed fluorimetrically in cells incubated with indo-l,AM dye. Results PMA treatment resulted in a concentration~ dependent increase in the extent of cell injury. This response was significantly attenuated by addition of the pan-specific PKC inhibitor GF 109203X. Furthermore, cell viabihty was maintained in cells preincuhated with the PKC isoform-specific inhibitors GO 6976 (PKC~x), rottlerin (PKCS) and eV1-2 (PKC~). Cell injury was also reduced if cells were incubated in Ca2+-free medium or in the presence of either the Ca > channel antagonist, verapamil or the intracellular chelator (BAPTA-AM), PMA, but not the inactive phorbol ester, 4aPMA, induced a dose-dependent increase in cellular Ca 2+ which was characterized by a rapid, transient spike followed by a tonic plateau phase above control levels. These responses were eliminated by the addition of BAPTA-AM Furthermore the increase in the Ca > spike was reduced or eliminated by co-incubation with the PKC8 antagonist, rottlerin. Inhibition of PKCa or PKC~ were less effective or ineffective in this regard. Conclusions These data suggest that PKC activation via PMA challenge affects the integrity of rat intestinal epithelial ceils. PKC8, but not PKCa or ~, activation appears to mediate this effect via an increase in cellular Ca 2+. Moreover, they are known to produce inflammatory mediators, including prostaglandin (PG)E2 and 6-keto PGF~cc 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) is a widely used immunosuppressam in the treatment of inflammatory bowel diseases. Its effect on intestinal myofibroblast function is unknown. We therefore analyzed the effects of 6-MP and its metabolite, 6-thioguanine (6-TG), on a) myofibroblast proliferation and apoptosis, b) myofibroblast production of PGE~ and 6-keto PGF~c~, and c) myofibroblast-stimulated intestinal epithelial repair. Methods: Primary subepithelial colon myofibroblasts (CMF) were isolated from human colon resectates and stimulated with either 6-MP or 6-TG at concentrations of 0.1-10 ~M for 24 hours. Effects of 6-MP and 6-TG on CMF proliferation were assessed by [3H]-thymidine incorporation. Apoptosis was evaluated by histone ELISA. In addition. PGE2 and 6-keto PGF# concentrations in CMF supernatants were determined by EL1SA. For analysis of 6-MP and 6-TG effects on CMF-stimulated intestinal epithelial repair mechanisms, human colon epithelial cells (Caco-2) were incubated with conditioned media collected from CMF stimulated with 6-MP or 6-TG. Proliferation and apoptosis of Caco-2 cells was evaluated as described above. Caco-2 cell migration was analyzed by a sheet migration assay. Results: Both, 6-MP and 6-TG, did neither affect proliferation nor apoptosis of CMF. However, both substances effected a substantial inhibition of PGE2 as well as 6-keto PG Fla concentrations in CMF culture supematants; maximal effects (30% and 40%, respectively) were observed at a final concentration of 10 I*M. Culture supema~nts from CMF-stimulated with 6-MP or 6-TG exerted no significant effect on migration, proliferation, or apoptosis of Caco-2 cells as compared to control media. Conclusion: 6-MP and its metabofite 6-TG decrease PGE, and 6-keto PGFtc\u00a2 release from colon myofibroblasts in vitro. In contrast, they do not modulate myofibroblast-stimulated repair mechanisms of the intestinal epithelium.",

In order to further investigate the role of COX-2 in mucosal recovery, COX-2 knockout and wildtype (B6) mice were subjected to 45 mm jejunal ischemia, after which mucosal-to-serosal fluxes of manintol were monitored in vitro as an index of barrier function recovery. Jejunal tissues were subjected to COX-selective inhibitors, and PGE2 was measured in serosal solutions after 120 min recovery. Denuded villous surface area was calculated after ischemia and 120 min recovery as an index of restitution. Western analyses were performed for COX isoforms. By 120 rain of recovery, ischemic-injumd tissue was significantly less permeable to mannitol than control tissue in wildtype mice. Treatment with the selective COX-1 inhibitor 5C-560 (5~M) significantly increased permeability to manintol in recovering tissues compared to control tissues, associated with significant reductions in PGE2 levels, whereas manintol permeability was not significantly different fi:om control tissues following treatment with the selective COX-2 inhibitor NS-398 (5b~M). There was no significant effect of any of the treatments on epithelial restitution, suggesting changes ill mannitol permeability were paracellular in nature. In COX-2 knockout mice, mannitol permeability in ischemic-injured tissue recovered to control levels by 120 min, but the significant reduction in mannitol permeability noted in wildtype tissues was not seen. Similar to wildtype tissues, SC-560 significantly increased permeability to mannitol, associated with significant reductions in PGE2 levels, but no change in epithelial restitution. COX-1 and COX-2 protein was present in control and ischemic samples from wildtype mice, whereas only COX-1 was present in COX-2 knockout mice. Mucosal barrier function of ischemicinjured jejunum recovered within 120 min in wildtype and COX-2 knockout mice, but an overshoot reduction in mannitol permeability was only seen in wildtype mice. The latter was also blocked by NS-398 in wildtype tissues, suggesting this was a COX-2-driven process. Alternatively, inhibition of COX-1 prevented recovery of barrier function in both sets of mice, suggesting a more important role for COX-1 in acute recovery of ischemic-injured jejunum.",

            "text": "Glucagon-Like Peptide-2 Mediates Protective Effects in TNBS Induced Ileitis Laurie E. Wallace, Gary R. Martin, David L Sigalet Inflammatory bowel disease is a devastating cause of intestinal dysfunction, especially in patients with Crohn's disease. However, the pathogenesis of inflammation and regulation of intestinal repair are poorly understood. Our lab has previously administered glucagonlike peptide-2 (GLP-2) to improve nutrient malabsorption following resection and we have noted that this peptide has putative anti-inflammatory effects. AIM: To examine if there is a protective role for GLP-2 in rat trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) induced ileitis as a Crohn's disease model. METHODS: Fasted 250 g rats were given an intraluminal injection of TNBS solution (40 mg/ml in 40% ethanol) at a site 10 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve. A subset of TNBS treated animals received GLP-2 (100 ug/kg s.c. BID). Both groups were followed for 5 days. Body weight was monitored throughout this period. On day 5, blood was sampled to determine post prandial GLP-2 levels as assessed by ELISA. In addition, ileal tissue was harvested and assayed for myloperoxidase activity (MP\u00a9); cytokine expression (IFN3', TGF~I, iNos, IL-ll3) by Western blot. RESULTS: Exogenous supplementation of GLP-2 to TNBS rats demonstrated significant increases in body weight and post prandial GLP-2 blood levels as compared to TNBS alone (Table 1) . MPO tissue damage score and the markers of intestinal inflammation were significantly reduced in GLP-2 treated animals (Table 1) . CONCLUSION: The upregulation of the markers of intestinal inflammation were moderated following GLP-2 administration. Clearly, GLP-2 is effective in rat TNBS ileitis however more investigation is required to delineate the anti-inflammatory properties of this potential therapy. Background: Intestinal transplantation as treatment of intestinal failure requires endoscopic surveillance and pathologic confirmation to identify acute allograft rejection. Advances in endoscopic imaging have allowed morphologic features of rejection to be identified more readily (Gastro Endosc 1999 50:257) . We show with the combination of improved magnification imaging and methylene blue chromoscopy that early rejection, graft recovery, and intestinal adaptation (villous hypertrophy) can be visualized in \"real time\" and correlates reliably with established pathologic features. Methods: 3 male infants underwent living related ileal allograft transplantation for gastroschisis. Examination of the graft was performed with a Fujinon EG 485ZH videoscope wit h 70X magnification through the intestinal stoma at postoperative day 7 for 4weeks, then every 2 weeks for the next 8 weeks, followed by monthly exams for 12 additional weeks. Subjects had 6 biopsies obtained for histology, proliferation (Ki-67) and intestinal succus was aspirated for IGF-1 RIA analysis. A total of 36 examinations were performed in the course of 1 yr. Results In early rejection villi are flattened and stain more intensely blue. The inter-villus spaces are also increased. This appearance correlates with crypt apoptosis, villus blunting, submucosal edema, and inflammation. Villus recovery is selective Regenerating villi stain selectively while denuded areas post villus slough do not take up methylene blue. The regenerating villi are shor t but do not stain intensely as villi with rejection. This appearance correlates histologically with villi that are thin and lack enterocyte differentiation. The crypt repair is more complete and the inflammation and submucosaI edema is reduced. In int es tinal adaptation the villi are elongated and overlap. There is loss of inter-villous spaces after staining. Increased enteral IGF-1 levels were seen only with surgical adaptation and were low in rejection and recovery. Proliferation was markedly incr eased during early recovery, decreased in acute rejection, and unchanged in surgical adaptation. Conclusion: Magnification chromoendoscopy is useful in the management of intestinal transplantation It can identify rejection and recovery earlier and reduce dur at ion and intensity of immunosuppression. This strategy could blunt the dilemma of rejection, sepsis, and post transplant lympho-proliferative disorder with which this surgical procedure is so often associated.",

            "text": "Background & Aims. Defective TGF-bl signaling is associated with high Smad7 in the mucosa of patients with Crohn's disease (CD), and enhanced Smad7 contributes to maintaining mucosal inflammation. In this study we have examined the molecular mechanisms underlying the induction of Smad7 in human intestine. Methods. Whole intestinal mucosal and lamina propria mononuclear cell (LPMC) samples were obtained from CD patients and controls and analysed for Smad7 RNA and protein by real-time light cycler RT-PCR and Western blotting. Smad7 acetylation and interaction with the intrinsic histone acetyhransferase, p300, were examined by immunoprecipitation and Western blotting. To determine if Smad7 expression requires de novo protein synthesis, CD LPMC were treated with cydoheximide (CHX) for 1 up to 6 hours, and analysed for Smad7, Ikba, and b-actin by Western blotting. Finally, to determine if acetylation enhances Smad7 expression, normal LPMC were treated with trichostatin, a histone deacetylase inhibitor, for 1 up to 24 hours. Results. Smad7 protein expression was increased in all CD samples in comparison to controls. In contrast, controls exhibit higher levels of Smad7 RNA than CD, suggesting that Smad7 is regulated at the post-transcriptional level in CD. Indeed, inhibition of de novo protein synthesis with CHX reduced Ikba, (a protein with a very short half-life) but not Smad7 expression, raising the possibility that high Smad7 is caused by enhanced protein stability. To address this issue, we first examined if Smad7 is acetylated in CD mucosa, given that acetylation is one of dynamic post-transtranslational mechanisms, which enhance protein stability. Co-immunoprecipitation assays revealed that Smad7 was acetylated on lysine residues and interacted with p300. Importantly, inhibition of histone deacetylase by trichostatin enhanced Smad7 protein but not RNA expression in normal LPMC. Conclusions. These data indicate that, in CD mucosa, high cellular levels of Smad7 are sustained by dynamic post-transcriptional mechanisms, and suggest that acetylation of Smad7 on lysine residues can enhance Smad7 protein expression by making the protein resistant to ubiquitination and degradation. Background & Aim. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-y (PPAR-~,) is a ligand dependent nuclear receptor that has been implicated in the regulation of chronic intestinal inflammation. We have previously shown that non-pathogenic Gram negative bactena induce NF-KB activity and pro-inflammatory gene expression in primary and intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) lines. In this study, we characterized the molecular mechanisms of PPAR-y and 15deoxy-Am4-prostaglandin J2 (15d-PGJ2) on Gram negative bacteria-induced IEC activation. Methods. Phospho-RelA and PPAR-~' were detected in IEC from Bacteroides vulgatus monoassociated germ-free Fisher rats using immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. CMT-93 cell fines which constitutively express PPAR-y were stimulated with Gram negative B. wlgatns/LPS in the presence or absence of the PPAR-y agonists rosiglitazone and 15d-PGJ2. PPAR-y specific knock-down in CMT93 cells was achieved using small interference (si) RNA technique. Results. We demonstrated that non-pathogenic Gram negative B. vulgatus induce persistent PPAR-y expression in colonic epithelium following bactenal co [onization (day 3, 7, 14, 28) . Consistent with the transient induction of phospho-RelA in colonic epithelium (day 3), PPAR-~, ligand 15d-PGJ2 inhibited B. vulgatus/LPS-induced RelA phosphoryhtion ($536) but not IKBa degradation, NF-KB nuclear translocation nor NF-KB DNA binding activity in CMT93 cells. Of note, the low affinity PPAR-~, ligand 15d-PGJ2 inhibited LPSinduced IL-6 but not IKBu gene expression in CMT-93 cells. Conversely, the high affinity ligand rosiglitazone did not affect RelA phosphorylation or pro-inflammatory gene expression in IEC. Concordanfly, PPAR-'y specific knock-down in CMT-93 cells failed to reverse the inhibitory effect of 15d-PGJ2. Conclusion. We could demonstrate that the PGD2 metabolite 15d-PGJ2 inhibits Gram negative bacteria-induced ReLA phosphorylation and lL-6 gene expression in IEC via PPAR-y independent mechanisms, questioning the role of PPAR-y in the regulation of chronic inflammation in the intestinal epithelium. Background & Aim: In Crohn's disease (CD) mucosa, lamina pmpria T lymphocytes (LPL) express high levels of Fas but are resistant to Fas-mediated apoptosis. The molecular mechanism underlying the resistance of CD LPL to FAS-mediated apoptosis still remains unclear. The aim of present study was to examine the expression and the role of FLICE-inhibitory protein (Flip), an inhibitor of the Fas signaling pathway, in CD. Materials and Methods: Whole intestinal mucosa, lamina propna mononuclear cells (LPMC) and LP CD3 + T lymphocytes (LPL) were obtained from CD and ulcerative colitis (UC) patients and normal controls and analyzed for the expression of Flip by Western blotting, using a monoclonal antibody that recognizes both the full-length and short form of Flip. To investigate mechanismS underlying the induction of Flip, normal LPMC were cultured in the presence of anti-CD3 with or without the addition of IL-12, a cytokine which is produced in excess in CD mucosa and able to enhance resistance of T cells to Fas-mediated apoptosis. Results: The full-length form of Flip was constitutively detected in all samples, but its expression was higher in whole biopsies and mucosal cells from CD patients in comparison to UC and normal controls. In addition, CD samples exhibit higher levels of the short form of Flip, which negatively regulates the activity of initiator caspases. Treatment of normal LPL with IL-12 enhanced anti-CD3-induced Flip expression, thus suggesting a role for this cytokine in inducing Flip",

In response to pathogens, intestinal epithelial cells (IEC) secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines. To aid in defense against bacteria, IEC also secrete anti-microbial peptides, termed defensins. The aim of our studies was to understand the role of toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling in regulation of 13-defensin expression by IEC. Methods: The effect of LPS and peptidoglycan (PGN) on 13-defenain-2 expression was examined in IEC lines constitutively or transgenically expressing TLRs. Regulation of 13-defensin-2 was assessed using promoter-reporter constructs of the human 13-defensin-2 gene. Expression of 13-defensin-2 and TLRs was examined by real-time PCR in normal and IBD mucosa. Results: LPS and PGN stimulated 13-defensin-2 promoter activation in a TLR4-and TLR2-dependent manner, respectively. A mutation in the NF-KB site within the 13-defensin-2 promoter abrogated this response. Expression of the 13-defensin-2 gene correlated with expression of TLRs in biopsies from normal and inflamed tissues. Conclusion: IEC respond to pathogen-associated molecular patterns with expression of the anti-microbial peptide 13-defensin-2. This mechanism may protect the intestinal epithelium from pathogen invasion and from potential invaders among the commensal flora",

Conditioned media from the EEC cell line STC-1 was cultured with the routine macrophage line RAW264.7, and LPS-and PGN-activated NO production /Griess reaction) and cytokine expression determined. Results: We have previously reported specific expression of TLR1, TLR2, and TLR4, co-localizing with the enteroendocrine cell (EEC) marker serotonin in primary human intestinal tissue sections. Studies performed on routine and human EEC lines revealed the same TLR expression pattern. The murine EEC fine STC-1 stimulated with bacterial ligands specific for TLR2 (PGN) and TLR4 (LPS) activated a NF-KB reporter plasmid in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, in this cell line, LPS induces mRNA expression of the anti-inflammatory gene TGF13 and the proinflammatory genes TNF and MIP-2. EEC supematant transfer experiments demonstrate inhibition of NO, IL-12 and TNF from LPS-activated macrophages. The inhibitory component in EEC conditioned media is not somatostatin. Conclusions: These results suggest that in normal intestinal homeostasis, EECs may function' to inhibit immune responses during exposure to bacterial ligands. Future work will characterize how the EEC contributes to innate immune responses in the normal mucosal immune system and how alterations in this process may lead to chronic intestinal inflammation. W1128 Expression of Chaperone Protein, TCP-1 Gamma, Is Down Regulated on Lymphocytes of Patients with Ulcerative Colitis Gopala Kowali, Carlos D. Minacapefli, Kiron M. Das T complex polypeptide 1 (TCP-1) or 'chaperonin containing TCP-I' (CCT) is the first member of the TF55/TCP-1 lamfly of eukaryotic chaperonins. TCP-1 consists of eight structurally related subunits of 52-65kDa. Several proteins are shown to require CCT for proper folding, though actin and tubulin are the inajor substrates for TCP-1. Recently, autoantibodies against TCP-1 are found in human sera with rheumatoid arthritis. In a twohybrid screen, viral P4 capsid protein was shown to interact with gamma subunit of TCP-1. However, there are no reports that address any role of TCP-1 in the pathogenesis of human disease. From yeast two-hybrid screen, we have earlier identified that gamma subunit of human TCP-1 (hCCT gamma) interacts with human tropomyosin isoform 5 (hTM5). hTM5 is involved in autoimmune responses -both humoral and cellular -in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC)",

ShaivaI Dave, Shignang Liu, Milena Bogunovic, Scott Plevy Purpose: Recognition of microbial components by the innate immune system involves tolllike receptors (TLRs). Intestinal epithelial ceils (IECs) are in constant contact with the microbial flora that colonize the intestinal lumen. Absorptive enterocytes are generally unresponsive to extracellular bacterial ligands. Whether they express functional TLRs remains controversial.

Results: H202-induced disruption of TJ was associated with dephosphorylation of occludin on Thr residues (but not in Ser residues) in a time-dependent manner. OA and FS reduced PP2A activity and the H202-induced disruption of TJ and permeability in a dose-dependent manner. Transfection of antisense oligos or siRNA to PP2A-C~t reduced the levels of PP2A (but not PP1) protein and activity, and the H202-induced disruption of TJ and permeability. Immunoprecipitation of occhidin co-precipitated PP2A. PP2A protein and the PP2A activity associated with occludin-immunocomplex were rapidly increased by H202. A dose-dependent binding of PP2A to GST-occludin demonstrated a direct interaction of PP2A with occludin. H2Or induced translocation of PP2A to occludin immunocomplex was completely prevented by Src kinase-specific inhibitor. Conclusion: These results indicate that PP2A directly interacts with occludin, and this interaction is increased by H202 by a Src kinase-dependent mechanism, and suggests a possible role of PP2A in dephosphorylation of occludin.

Recent studies show that ELR-CXC chemokines can also exert mitogenic effects on a variety of cell types. The aim of this study was to determine whether ENA-78 can induce intestinal epithelial cell proliferation and to examine the signal transduction pathways regulating this response.

Results: Mode-K cells constitutively expressed low amounts of Fas which was significantly increased by IFN-3~ or TNF-ct. Treatment of Mode-K with IFN-'y or TNF-ct induced a small degree of apoptosis (17 _+ 4 % and 13 _+ 2 %, respectively) and anti-Fas mAb alone induced only 14 + 2 % apoptosis of Mode-K cells. Pretreatment of Mode-K with IFN-~/and TNF-ct led to a significant increase in anti Fas-induced apoptosis (94 -4-4 %). IL-10 treatment of Mode-K ceils decreased IFN-3' and TNF-u induced Fas expression by 50-70%. Similarly, IL-10 significantly diminished 1FN-3, or TNF-ct induced apoptosis of Mode-K ceils by 50%.

Comparisons between luminal fluids from patients with IBD and normal subjects were done by Western blotting. Result: The ratio of active to total MMP-2, estimated by zymography, increased significantly at 24 and 48h after 1L-6 stimulation compared to controls. Western blotting revealed significant increase (3 fold compared to control) in the expression of MT1-MMP protein after 24 of 1L-6 stimulation. Confocal microscopy confirmed the increased membrane expression of MT-MMP1 by IL-6. Interestingly, soluble form of MT1-MMP, as measured in the conditioned media, also showed increase after iL-6 stimulation. TIMP-2 protein levels were moderately decreased at 24 and 48h after IL-6 stimulation. Western blotting also revealed significantly up-regufated protein expression of both, pro-and active forms of MMP-2, as well as of MT1-MMP in luminal fluid of patients with Crohn's disease compared to luminal fluid from normal subjects. Conclusion: 1) In intestinal epithelial supernatants, MMP-2 activation was significantly elevated following the addition of IL-6 2) IL-6 enhanced the membrane expression of MT1-MMP and the secretion of MMP-2 suggesting that at the surface of intestinal epithelial cells, IL-6 regulated MT1-MMP mediated pro-MMP2 activation. These finding suggest that IL-6, through the activation of MMP-2, may modulate extraceflular matrix remodeling and wound healing both of which play an important role in intestinal fibrosis, characteristic of inflammatory diseases such as Crohn's disease. Wl186 Induction of Nitric Oxide in Human Colonic Fibroblasts Yingting Zhu, Michael Duffey, M. Peter Lance PURPOSE: To investigate the relationship between nitric oxide (NO), the product of inducible NO synthase (iNOS), and COX-2 derived prostanoid biogenesis in human colorectal stromal flbroblasts. METHODS: Human fetal (CCD-18Co) fibroblasts were cultured to 70% confluency, then shifted to medium supplemented with 1% fetal bovine serum for the period of testing. Supematants were harvested from untreated (control) cultures and cultures supplemented with lipopolysaccharide (LPS, 1 ug/ml), interferon (IFN)-gamma (200 U/ml), or both. Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and nitrite concentrations, respectively, in cell-free supernatams were measured by radioimmuno-and colorimetric assays. Levels of COX-2 and iNOS mRNA and protein, respectively, were assessed by Northern and Western analysis. The relationship between NO expression and COX-2 upregulation was investigated with specific inhibitors and transfection of fibroblasts with specific duplex COX-2 or iNOS small interfering RNA (siRNA). RESULTS: Maximal 4-fold elevation of PGE2 levels occurred after exposure to LPS for 24 h. IFN did not stimulate PGE2 synthesis. Maximal 2-, 4-and &fold increases, respectively, in NO synthesis occurred after exposure for 72 h to 1FN, LPS and the combined agents; protein kinase C but not intraceflular Ca2 + release was involved in mediation of these effects. A selective COX-2 inhibitor, NS398, blocked LPS-stimufated PGE2 synthesis but not NO synthesis. An iNOS inhibitor, 1400W, completely blocked NO synthesis and reduced maximal PGE2 levels after LPS by 20%. COX-2 siRNA decreased maximal COX-2 protein expression following LPS stimulation by 85% but had no effect on maximal expression of iNOS protein",

The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of BBS on the gene expression of COX-2 and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) in flbroblasts. HGF is known as a potent mitogenic and motogenic stimulator in normal and neoplastic ceils and is produced mainly by fibroblasts. Whereas its receptor, c-Met, is expressed in epithelium. METHODS. 3T3-L1 fibrobfasts were treated with or without BBS (10 nM) in serum-free conditions. Protein levels of HGF were determined by Western blotting. The mRNA expression of HGF and COX-2 were examined by cDNA microarray and Northern blot analyses, respectively. RESULTS. BBS administration significantly stimulated HGF and COX-2 mRNA abundance and induced an increase of HGF protein m 3T3-L1 cells in time-dependent fashion. Similar to BBS, prostaglandin E22 (PGE2, 1 p~M) treatment also increased HGF production in the cells; whereas, IL-1 [3, a HGF inducer in other cell types had only a minimal effect. Moreover, the BBS-dependent HGF protein production was partially suppressed by NS398, a selective COX-2 inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS. BBS treatment significantly stimulated HGF and COX-2 gene expression in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts The BBS-elicited HGF production may be mediated partially by the COX-2/PGE2 pathway",

Results: The probiotic mixture caused concentration-dependent contractile responses in the ileal segment, but induced relaxation /n the colon segment. In order to characterize the behavior of each bacterial genus, Bifidobact-\u00a2rium, Lactobacillus and Streptococcus preparations were assessed. Bifidohacteria strains showed the most potent relaxant effect upon the colon segment while elicited a slight ileal contraction which was not dose-dependent. In contrast, Lactobacillus strains induced more pronounced ileal contraction and had less effect on colon relaxation. Streptococcus strain did not have any effect on ileal segment while showed colon relaxation. Control bacteria did not show significant changes on intestinal motility, except S. aboni which strongly stimulated ileal contraction. Conclusions: The in vitro relaxation of the colon segment caused by ~ifidobactena and, to a lesser extend, by Lactobacilli and Streptococcus might explain at least part the beneficial effect exerted by probiotic bacteria in reducing the stool frequency in diarrhea.

Activation of PPAR',/in colonic cancer cells results in stimulation of apoptosis and inhibition of cell proliferation. In previous studies we demonstrated overexpression of PPAR~/both in the Barrett's adenocarcinoma cell line OE33 in vitro and in primary Barrett's epithelium and Barrett's adenocarcinoma ex vivo, as compared to the esophageal squamons cancer cefi-line Kyse-180 and healthy esophageal squamous epithelium. Aim: In this study we investigated the specific effects of PPAR3,-activation on apoptosis, cell differentiation and proliferation in gastro-esophageal cancer cells. Methods: In the cell-lines OE33 (Barrett's carcinoma) and Kyse-180 (esophageal squamous cell carcinoma) PPAR'y was activated by stimulation with 30, 60 and 90 I~M pioglitazone or vehicle (DMSO) as a control for 8 days. The effect of PPAR3,-activation on cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell-cycle regulation was analyzed by standard assays. Results: PPAR',/-activation in OE33-cells resulted in a highly significant dose-and time-dependent decrease of cancer cell numbers within 4 to 8 days as compared to non-stimulated cells. Concomitantly, both a dose-dependent increase in apoptotic activity and inhibition of cell proliferation at 901xM pioglitazone was observed in OE33-cells upon PPAR~ activation. Cell-cycle analysis after PPAR'y-activation revealed an increased number of OE33 cancer cells within the Gl-phase. In contrast, in Kyse-180 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cells PPAR~-activation by piogfitazone had no effect on cell numbers, apoptosis, cell proliferation and cell-cycle regulation. Conclusions: These results identify PPAR~ as a transcriptional regulator of apoptosis and cell proliferation in Barrett's carcinoma cells. Activation of PPAR~/by thiazolidinedinnes may be successful as an antiproliferative intervention in Barretfs disease.W985SEP53 Esophageal Stress Protein Enhances Cellular Defence Mechanisms Mairi J.

Fitzgerald Introduction: Transforming Growth Factor[3 (TGF[3)is a multi-functional growth factor that inhibits cell proliferation through the induction of cell cycle regulators, such as p21. This response is lost in many gastrointestinal carcinomas. In contrast, the TGF[3 induced expression of other genes, such as plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) is conserved and can aid tumour progression. Given that aberrant cell proliferation occurs in the neoplastic progression of Barrett's metaplasia, we hypothesise that there maybe a selective loss of TGF[3 responsiveness in Barrett's associated adenocarcinoma. Methods: TGFI3 induced inhibition of proliferation was assessed by MTT assay, and induction of p21 and plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAl) mRNA expression assessed by RT-PCR in oesophagea] cell lines derived from: normal squamous epithelium (HET-1A), Barrett's oesophagus (BE) with high-grade dysplasia (ChTRT, GihTRT, GohTRT), and BE associated adenocarcinoma (OE33, TE7, SEG-1, BIC-I, FLO-1).

The T3 effects on a target gene are mediated by the binding of T3 to its receptor (TR) and the subsequent association with a variety of histone-modifying proteins. In the present work, we examined the role of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) family of proteins in the context of the T3 target gene, intestinal alkaline phosphatase (LAP). METHODS: Human colon cancer (Caco2) cells were transiently transfected with LUC reporter plasmids containing 2.5 kb of the human LAP gene promoter along with pfasmids expressing the TR (TRal or TRy1) that are known to activate the LAP gene.

We recently showed that, in vivo, it has a complex action in the rat colon since it stimulated the epithelial cell proliferation but significantly inhibited the development of carcinogeninduced aberrant crypt loci(Gastroenterology, 2004). Aims : To further investigate the effect of leptin a) in vitro, on the proliferation of human colon cancer cell lines (HT-29, LoVo, SW-480, Caco2), b) in vivo, on the growth of HT-29 xenografts in nude mice and on the development of spontaneous intestinal tumors in Apc mill/+ mice. Methods : Colon cancer cells were cultured in the absence or presence of leptin (20 to 500 ng/ml). Cell proliferation was assessed by 3H-thymidine incorporation and hemocytometer cell count. In vivo, leptin (800 microg/kg/d) or its vehicle was administered s.c. by minipump renewed every two weeks a) for 28 days in nude mice which were inoculated s.c on day 0 with 1.107 HT-29 cells, or b) for 45 days in 8 to 10 week-old Apc rain/+ mice. Control and leptin treatedmice were pair-fed. Tumors in nude mice were daily measured and weighed at killing time. In Ape mid/+ mice, tumors in small intestine and colon were quantified and their largest diameter measured. Results : In vitro, leptni dose-dependently stimulated cell DNA synthesis and growth in the four cell lines. Incubation for 2 rain with leptin (100 ng/ml) induced optimal phosphorylation of Ob-Rb lepim receptor isoform in HT-29 cells. In vivo, after 28 days of treatment, plasma leptin levels were 4.3-fold increased in leptin-treated nude mice as compared to controls (9.1 +/-2.4 vs 2.1 +/-0.4 ng/ml, P<0.0003). However, although HT-29 xenografts of the two groups expressed leptin receptors, this hyperleptineima did not induce significant variation in tumor volume during the course of treatment nor in weight at the end of treatment (689 +/-99 mg vs 663 +/-149 rag) as compared to controls. Results in Apc mill/+ mice indicated that the numbers of intestinal tumors (104 +/-17 vs 105 +/-21), their density per mm of mucosal length (2.8 +/-0.9 vs 2.6 +/-0.7) and the distribution profile of tumor size were similar in leptin-treated and control groups. Conclusion : Although leptin stimulates the proliferation of human colon cancer cells in vitro, it does not promote the tumor growth of xenografted colon cancer cells nor the intestinal tumorigenesis in the in vivo models tested.W1026An Anti-Apoptotic Role for Gastrin in Barrett's Oesophagus Joseph C. Harris, Phil A. Clarke, Altaf Awan, Jannsz Jankowski, Sue A. Watson Background and Aims: Barrett's oesophagus (BE) is a pre-malignant disorder of the distal oesophagus, characterised by a metaplastic change from normal squamous to intestinal-type epithelium. This study assessed gastrin and cholecystokinin-type 2 receptor (CCK-2R) levels in normal and BE biopsy samples and related these to activation of the potent anti-apoptotic factor, protein kinase B/Akt (PKB/Akt). Methods: Expression of gastrin (n= 16) and CCK-2R (n= 18) in normal and BE biopsy samples was quantified via real-time PCR. Effects of exogenous gastrin stimulation on PKB/Akt phosphorylation and degradation of the downstream target IKBa was assessed in two CCK-2R positive oesophageal cell lines via Western blotting. Immuno-staining confirmed expression of gastrin and CCK-2R in the cell lines and of PKB/Akt in the paired biopsy samples (u=8). Results: Real-time PCR showed gastrin (p = 0.0076) and CCK-2R (p = 0.0068) to be significantly up-regulated in BE compared to paired normals. Exogenous amidated gastrin increased phosphorylation of PKB/Akt in OE33 cells. PKB/Akt was constitutively phnsphorylated in OE19 cells, which had higher detectable gastrin gene expression. Basal IKBc~ inversely correlated with PKB/Akt phosphorylation levels.",

Fourmy, Marlene Dufresne, Catherine Seva BACKGROUNDS & AIMS:Gastrin is now recognized as a mitogenic factor for gastrnintestmal mucosal cells. Often up-regulated in precancerous lesions and carcinomas, gastrin may contribute to cancer development and progression in the G1 tract. Epithelial cell layers of the gastm-mtestinal tract exhibit an ordered polarized architecture. However, during malignant transformation, epithelial morphology is lost and mesenchymal characteristics acquired, generally coinciding with a loss of cell-cell adhesion, reorganization of actin cytoskeleton and an increased metastatic potential. Here we have analyzed the signalling pathways potentially involved in the modulation of ceil-cell adhesion by gastrin. METHODS: In non tumorigenic intestinal epithelial ceils (IEC-6), we tested the activation of JAK2/STAT3 and PI3-K pathways in response to gastrin by western-blot method and in-vitro kinase assays. The expression and localization of cell-cell adhesion molecules (Cadherins, Catenins) was studied by immunofiuorescence technique. RESULTS: In response to gastrin, we found a rapid and transient activation of both JAK2/STAT3 and PI3-Kinase pathways. In anti-JAK2 immunoprecipitates, we also detected an increase in PI-Kinase activity in response to gastrin that was blocked by LY 294002, a specific P13-Kinase inhibitor. Moreover, by coimmunoprecipitation and western-blot analysis we confirmed the association between JAK2 and the regulatory subunit p85 of this PI3-Kinase in response to gastrin. In addition, Pl3-Kinase activation by gastrin was inhibited in cells pre-treated with the JAK2 specific inhibitor (AG 490) suggesting that JAK2 activates the PI3-Kinase in gastrin signalling. We also demonstrated that loss of cellcell adhesion and reorganization of actin cytoskeleton induced by gastrin required the activation of JAK2 and the PI 3-K. Indeed, the modifications in localization of adherens junction proteins, alpha-, beta-catenins and pl20CTN observed in gastrin-stimulated cells were reversed by pre-treatment of the cells with the JAK2 inhibitor, AG490 or the PI 3-K inhibitor, LY294002. Similarly, gastrin-induced reorganization of actin filaments was blocked by both inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: These results described for the first time the involvement of JAK2 in the modulation of cell-cell adhesion in non transformed epithelial cells. They support a possible role of JAK2 in the epithdial/mesenchymal transition during malignant development.w1034 Effect of Membrane Mechanics on Single Laminin-Dystroglycan Bond Force in Live Myoblasts Richard Gilbert, George Gluck, Ayse Erol, David W.

The highest activity of 13-HODE dehydrogenase is found in CECs and liver, therefore, 13-OxoHODE could be a CEC specific ligand for PPAR-'y playing a role in ulcerative colitis. METHODS: Induction of LOX-activity in CECs was investigated by stimulation with and without calcium chloride (1.0 raM), arachidonic or linoleic acid (25 ~M) and Ca-ionophor A23187 (10 p,M) at 37~C.

Jones, Andrzej S. Tarnawski VEGF-regulated angiogenesis is essential for embryonic development, wound healing and cancer growth. Serum response factor (SRF) is a serum inducible transcription factor important for embryonic development and muscle function. Its role in endothelial cell physiology, migration, proliferation, augiogenesis and potential interaction with VEGF remains unexplored. The aims of this study were to determine the role of SRF in angiogenesis, endothelial cell biology and its regulation by VEGF. METHODS: SRF deficiency was induced in rat gastric microvascular endothelial cells (RGMEC) by transfection with SRF ant/sense oligonudeotide. A complementary sense oligonucleotide was used as a control. STUDIES: The effect of SRF deficiency on: 1) VEGF-induced m vitro angiogenesis in RGMEC cells was evaluated by Matrigel assay; 2) VEGF-induced endothelial cell migration and proliferation was examined by wounding assay and 3H-thymidnie incorporation, respectively; and 3) VEGF-niduced expression of SRF-targeted genes such as c-Fos and Egr-1 analyzed by Western blotting. 4) Effect of VEGF on SRF expression was determined using RT-PCR, Western blot analysis and EMSA. 5) The signal transduction pathways mediating VEGF-niduced SRF activation were investigated using specific inhibitors for MEK-ERK and Rho-actin pathways. RESULTS: SRF deficiency inhibited VEGF-induced angiogenesis in vitro in RGMEC cells by 84 % (P < 0.001), reduced VEGF-induced endothelial cell migration by > 4 fold and proliferation by 40 % (both P < 0.001), and inhibited VEGF-induced G-actni polymerization and activation of c-Fos and Egr-1. VEGF treatment induced SRF expression by 7 fold and activated SRF nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity. This activation was completely abolished by MEK inhibitor U0126 and PD98059, Rho GTPase inhibitor Clostridium difficile toxin B, and actin polymerization inhibitor Latranculin B. CONCLUSIONS: 1) SRF is a down stream mediator of VEGF signaling and a critical requirement for VEGF-induced angiogenesis; 2) VEGF-induced endothelial cell migration is dependent on SRF activation; 3) SRF is important for VEGF-induced endothelial cell proliferation; and 4) VEGF promotes SRF expression, nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity in endothelial cells through both Rho-actin and MEK-ERK dependent signaling pathways.W1042Substance P May Promote Intraabdominal Adhesion Formation by Decreasing Peritoneal Fibrinolytic Activity Karen L.

This WAT hypertrophy points to a functional role of adipocytes or adipocytokines, e.g. Adiponectin (AN), in intestinal inflammation. AN is a protein strictly secreted by adipocytes that is part of the Clq/TNF superfamily. We evaluated the secretion of AN by WAT in patients with CD, diverticulitis (D1V) and controls (CO) ex vivo. Secondly, the effects of AN on the secretion of IL-6 were investigated in two different cell lines in vitro. Methods: Tissue specimens of WAT of 3 patients with CD, 2 patients with DIV and 5 CO (non-inflamed WAT of patients with colon carcinoma) were obtained by laparotomy and incubated for 24 hours. The concentration of AN was determined in the supernatant by ELISA. MonoMac6-cells (a myelo-monocytic cell line) and HT29 cells (an epithelial cell line) were stimulated with 10 ng/ml lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and increasing concentrations of AN. As a control, cells were also incubated in the presence of a specific neutralizing antibody against AN. Results: In the supernatant of the fat tissue cultures of patients with CD as well as of patients with DIV, the concentration of AN (Irg/g fat tissue; mean _+ SEM) was significantly elevated in comparison with CO (1421 _+ 173 (CD); 1275 _4-178 (DIV) vs 932 + 109 (CO); p<O.02). In vitro there was no detectable IL-6 secretion by both cell lines after stimulation with AN alone. However, in both cell lines a dose dependent additive effect of AN on the LPS stimulated secretion of 1L-6 could be detected (p<0.02). This effect could be reversed by neutralizing AN with a specific antibody. Conclusion: WAT cultures of patients with CD and DIV as well as the demonstrated additive effect of AN with LPS incubation on the IL-6 production indicate an involvement of WAT and its secreted adipocytokines in intestinal inflammation. However, the preliminary ex vivo results do not point to a specific role of AN during chronic intestinal inflammation.

NewberryPurpose: Isolated lymphoid follicles (1LEs) are organized tertiary lymphoid structures in the small intestine. The formation of ILFs is characterized by a progression from clusters of B220 + cells, immature ILFs (iiLFs), to an organized lymphoid stmcture possessing an overlying follicle associated epithelium, mature ILFs (mILFs). The formation of ILFs is known to be dependent upon lymphotoxin beta receptor (LTI3R) expression by intestinal stromal cells. The formation of mILFs is known to require lymphotoxin (LT) sufficient B-cells, however the requirement for LT sufficient B-cells in the formation of iILFs is unknown. The induction of LT expression in B-cells can occur following B-cell activation by B-cell receptor crosslinking and CD40 figation. Alternatively the induction of LT expression in B-cell can occur following chemokine ligation. We sought to determine the requirement for LT sufficient B-cell in the formation of ilLFs, and to determine the requirement for antigen specific Bcell and T-cell stimulation in the formation of iILFs and mILFs. Methods: Mice expressing exclusively a transgenic B-cell receptor specific for hen egg lysozyme, MD4JH-/-mice, and mice expressing exclusively a transgenic T-cell receptor specific for a peptide o f hen egg lysozyme presented in the context of 1-Ak, 3AgTCRoL-/-mice, were examine for the presence of ilLFs and mlLFs using whole mount techniques with anti-B220 staining and UEA-I lectin staining. Lethally irradiated LT~-/-mice receiving LT~-/-bone marrow, C57BL/6 bone marrow, or a combination of LTo~-/-and JH-/-bone marrow were examined for the presence of ilLFs and mILFs. Findings: We observed that ilLFs and mlLF formation was preserved in MD4JH-/-and 3A9Ka-/-mice. Immature and mature ILFs were observed in the intestines of LTa-/-mice receiving C57BL/6 bone marrow. Immature 1LFs but not mlLFs were present in LTa-/-recipients of a combination of LTa-/-and JH-/-bone marrow. Both ilLFs and m ILFs were absent in intestines of LTot-/-mice receiving LT(x-/-bone marrow. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that antigen specific B-cell and T-cell events are not required for the formation of ilLFs and mILFs. In the absence of LT sufficient B-cells ILF formation is arrested at the iILF stage. These findings suggest that ILF formation does not require antigen specific responses, and may be driven by a chemokine positive feedback loop which induces B-cell LT expression with subsequent induction of further chemokine expression by LTI3R expressing stromal cells.Wl130Potential Anti-bacterial Product, Chitinase 3-1ike-1, Is Upregulated Under Inflammatory Condition in Mouse and Human Emiko Mizoguchi, Ken Sugimoto, Ramnik J.

Colt Isolated from Crohn's Disease patients Isabelle lngrassia, Antony Leplingard, Arlette Darfeuille-Michaud BACKGROUND: Ileal lesions of Crohn's disease (CD) are abnormally colonized by adherentinvasive E. coil (AIEC) strains, able to adhere to and to invade cultured intestinal epithelial cells. Probiotics are effective tools for preventing infections and their efficacy in inflammatory bowel disease has been reported. AIM: To determine the in vitro inhibitory effects of the probiotic strain Lactobacillas easel (L casei) DN-114 001 on adhesion to and invasion of human intestinal epithelial ceils by AIEC strains isolated from ileal lesions of CD patients. METHOD: Bacterial adhesion to and invasion of the intestinal epithelial cells Caco-2 were assessed by numbering colony forming units. Inhibitory effects of L. case/ DN-114 001 bacteria alone, or in the presence of its culture supematant, on AIEC adhesion to and invasion of the intestinal epithelial ceils Caco-2, HT29 and Intestine-407 were determined in pre-and co-incubation experiments. RESULTS: In co-incubation, using Caco-2 cells, inhibitory effects of L case/DN-114 001 alone on AIEC LF-82 adhesion and invasion reached 82% and 79%, respectively. Inhibitory assays realized in the presence of L. case/ DN-114 001 bacteria and 10% of L case/ DN-114 001 culture supematant revealed very strong inhibitory effects on LF-82 adhesion and invasion (90% and 93%, respectively). In preincubation, inhibitory effects of L case/DN-114 001 alone on LF-82 adhesion and invasion reached 47% and 56% respectively, and 73% and 89% respectively when supernatant was added. The increased inhibitory effects of L. case/ DN-114 001 in the presence of its supernatant was not due to a bactericidal effect on AIEC LF82 or a cytotoxic effect on Caco-2 cells. It was associated with an increased adhesion of L casei DN-114 001 to intestinal epithelial cells and an additional inhibitory effect of the supematant by itself. Similar results were observed with various AIEC strains and others intestinal cell lines (HT-29 and Intestine-407). CONCLUSION: The probiotic L case/DN-114 001 strongly inhibits AIEC adhesion to and invasion of intestinal epithelial cells, indicating that it could prevent intestinal colonization and invasion of the gut mucosa by AIEC strains and be beneficial in inflammatory bowel disease.

Pretreatment with PAR2-activating peptide (PAR2-AP, corresponds to tethered ligand domain) desensitized responses, suggesting that proteases signal by cleaving PAR2. Mast cell lysate also increased [Ca2+]i in epithelial cells, and responses were reduced by tryptase inhibitor. Mast cells, proteases or PAR2-AP added to the basolateral compartment of Transwells decreased TER and induced uptake of HRP into enlarged endosomes. These effects were also diminished by tryptase inhibitor. PAR2 activation induced redistribution of proteins from tight junctions, including ZO 1, occhidin and claudin, and caused a reorganization of cortical actin. PAR2 activation stimulated activity of extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERIO 1 and 2 in T84 cells which was prevented by down-regufation of b-arrestins using RNAi. This suggests that b-arrestins recruit PAR2 and ERK1/2 to endosomes and thereby specify the localization and function of activated ERKs. Finally, an inhibitor of ERKI/ 2 formation prevented PAR2-stimulated increases in epithelial permeability. Conclusions: Mast cell proteases signal to colonic epithelial cells by activating PAR2. This activation promotes reorganization of proteins from tight junctions and increases epithelial permeability that is mediated by b-arrestins and ERK1/2. These findings have implications for intestinal conditions where enhanced permeability contributes to the disease process.

Our data indicate that TNF-a activation of NF-KB pathways leads to cytoplasmic-to-nuclear translocation of NF-KB, increased NF-KB binding to the DNA binding site, down-regulation of ZO-1 protein expression, disturbance in junctional localization of Z0-1 protein, and functional opening of the TJ barrier. Moreover, our results indicate that TNF-a effect on Caco-2 TJ permeability was not due to an increase in apoptosis. Thrombin substantially enhances resistance and decreases permeability of intestinal epithelial cells in vitro. In summary, the data suggest that thrombin improves barrier function of the intestinal epithelium.Zonulin Is Structurally and Functionally Related to the Mucusal Mast Cells-Derived Mast Cell Protease II David Adams, Eugene Fang, Stefanie M.

While the activation of VDR by butyrate mainly seems to be responsible for cellular differentiation, the activation of PPARy in intestinal cells remains to be elucidate. Here we provide several lines of evidence suggesting that PPARy is not involved in butyrate induced cell differentiation. Materials and Methods: Caco-2 cells expressing PPARs were treated with two specific PPAR'y ligands ciglitazone and BADGE. Cell growth Was determined by BrdU incorporation cell differentiation by measurement of alkaline phosphatase activity (AP). PPARy mRNA was quantified by RT competitive multiplex PCR, PPARy protein by Western blot analysis. A dominant-negative PPARy mutant was transfected growth without affecting differentiation. Conclusions: The present study clearly demonstrated that PPAR'y is involved in butyrate induced inhibition of cell growth, but seems not to play a essemial role in butyrate induced cell differentiation.T1847L-Glutamine Prevents Acetaldehyde-Induced Disruption of Tight Junctions (TJ) by Preventing Reorganization of Actin Cytoskeleton and Changes inPhosphorylation of TJ Proteins Ankur Seth, Shyamali Basuroy, Parimal Sheth, R.

In-Seok Lee, In-Sik Chung, Hak-Sung Lee, Hue-Won Han, Yu-Kyung Cho, Se-Hee Kim, Sang-Woo Kim, Myung-Gyu Choi, Jae-Kwang Kim, Sok-Won Hart, Kyu-Young Choi Background: lnterleukin 113 is a proinflammatory cytokine and powerful acid inhibitor. Polymorphisms in the gene for IL-1B have been found to increase the risks of hypochlorohydria and gastric atrophy in response to H. pylori infection. Th/s study aimed to examine effects of IL-1B polymorphism on gastric acid output. Methods: 95 chronic gastritis patients with mild mucosal atrophy were evaluated for H. pylori status, serum gastrin, pepsinogen 1 and lI, basal and pentagastrin induced maximal acid output (BAO, MAO). Both the IL-1B-511 biallelic polymorphism and the IL-1RN penta-allelic variable number of tandem repeats were genotyped. Results: 57 patients were H. pylori infected (mean age 52.8, 25-82) and 38 patients were FI. pylori negative (mean age 56.8, 21-79). Acid output ofH. pylori infected patients seemed to be decreased compared to that of H. pylori negative patientS, but there were no significant difference. Among H. pylori infected patients, IL-1B-511 and IL-RN genotype polymorphism had no effect on basal and maximal acid output.

Retention of the ability of TGF~ to induce expression of other genes in oesophageal adenocarcinoma, such as PAl, may be a determinant of neoplastic progression. upregulates VEGF production in C1 and in MP2. DNA binding activity of HIF-1 to the promotor region of the VEGF gene was activated within 60 rain after onset of hypoxia. Hypoxic activation of HIF-1 DNA binding and VEGF expression was dose dependently suppressed by increasing doses of genistein. Protein levels of VEGF significantly (p<0.05) dropped significantly in both celllines C 1 (4.2 fold), MP2 (2.4 fold) upon geinstein treatment. In vivo geinstein suppressed VEGF mRNA expression significantly (p<0.05) in all animals treated. Reduced VEGF expression was also accompanied by a significant lower microvessel density (37.2 vs 21.2) in immunohistochemistry. Conclusion: In this study we present for the first time one likely mechanism on a molecular basis by which the previously reported antiangiogenic activity o[ genistein is mediated. Inhibition of HIF-1 appears to downregulate VEGF production not only in vitro but also in vivo, which leads to a decreased microvesse[ density in tumor xenografts. The regulatory unit of the transcription factor HIF-1 and its target gene VEGF may be a possible therapeutic target in future.",

OuelletteThe c~-defensin antimicrobial peptide family is defined by an invariant tridisnlflde array. To test the hypothesis that the disulfide pairings determine bactericidal activity, site-directed mutations were introduced into cryptdin-4 (Crp4), the most bactericidal mouse Paneth cell cx-defensin. Crp4 peptide variants with paired Ala for Cys substitutions, including (C4/ 29A)Crp4, null for C1-C6; (C6/21A)Crp4, null for C2-C4; (Cll/28A)Crp4, null for C3-C5; (C4/11/28/29A)Crp4, null for both C1-C6 & C3-C5 bonds, and (all Cys to Ala)-Crp4 ((60 A)-Crp4), lacking all disulfide bonds were purified and tested for bactericidal activity. Mutagenesis of Crp4 disulfide bonds had little or no measurable effect on bactericidal activity against several bacterial species. In fact, (C416/28/29A)-Crp4 and (6CJA)-Crp4 were more active than native Crp4 and three wild-type strains of S. typhimurium. Exposure of Crp4 and pro-Crp4 variants with Ala for Cys mutations to matrix metalloproteinase-7 (MMP-7) the mouse procryptdin activating enzyme, cleaved all mutant proteins at several internal positions as determined in AU-PAGE, MALDI-TOF MS, and N-terminal peptide sequence analysis. Although native Crp4 and proCrp4 were not cleaved within the defensin peptide region, the bactericidal activities of mutant Crp4 peptides were attenuated by MMP-7mediated proteolysis. Thus, the Crp4 disulfide array protects the a-defensin moiety from proteolysis during precursor activation hut is not required for bactericidal activity.Effect of Oral Administration of Isoleuciue, Stimulant of Innate Immunity, in IBD Patients Toshifnmi Ashida, Tokiyoshi Ayabe, Syuhei Inaba, Jun Sakamoto, Takahiro ltoh, Kohtaro Okamoto, Astuo Maemoto, Masami Moriyama, Michael Zasloff, Yutaka Kohgo Background/aim Impaired innate defenses against intestinal microorganisms are involved in the pathophysidogy of IBD. Recent report of Fellermann K et al directly suggested the reduced production of [g-defensins in Crohn's disease (CD). We also reported that Paneth cells isolated from intestines of CD patients showed insufficient secretion of antimicrobial activity. On the other hand, Fehlbaum et al. reported that the essential amino acid Lqsoleucine (Ile) is a potent inducer in vitro of an enteric [B-defensin. Based on flrese properties, we evaluated the effects of lie on both the Paneth cell secretion and clinical symptoms of IBD patients, especially in CD.Patients/Methods Human intestinal crypts isolated from surgical specimens by EDTA disruption method were used for in vitro study. Secretion of antimicrobial activity from isolated crypts was analyzed. Totally 24 IBD patients were studied in clinical study. Four grams/day of powdered Ile (Immunohealth Japan, Tokyo) divided into two doses was orally administered for 4 weeks. Daily symptoms including frequency of bowel habit and diarrhea, severity of abdominal pain and general condition were recorded for 4 weeks of lie administration and for 2 weeks before and after the administration periods. In CD patients, CDAI was calculated at the beginning and following the fourth week of Ile administration. To test the alterations of intestinal flora, population density of Lactobacifli in the stools of hospitalized 9 CD patients were analyzed. Results Isolated human crypts responded to lie treatment dose-dependently to secrete antimicrobial activities. Ile given with the low-residual diet under the restriction of yogurt and antibiotics for 1 week significantly increased stool Lactobacilfi CFU (before LogCFU 3.6, after 1 week 4.2, p = 0.03). Open clinical trial showed that frequency of diarrhea was significantly decreased in CD patients after 1 week of fie administration. As the result of the improvement of stool consistency and frequency, calculated CDAI was decreased at fourth week. (before 110.3, fourth week 83.4, p = 0.039). Further development of abdominal symptoms in CD or flareup in UC was not observed throughout the study periods. Conclusions These results suggest that Ile is a stimulant for human innate immune responses of intestine, to improve the symptoms of IBD patients by modulating the intestinal flora. The safety of lie warrants its further evaluation for the treatment of 1BD in the setting of appropriately designed placebo controlled trials.Rebamipide Blocks Endothelial Expression of MAdCAM-I: Implications forInflammatory Bowel Disease Therapy Tadaynki Oshima, Takashi Joh, Fumitaka Fujita, Tsuneya Wada, Shozo Togawa, Naotaka Ogasawara, Yutaka Kondo, Keisuke Itoh, Satoshi Tanida, Hiromi Kataoka, Makoto Sasaki, J. Steven Alexander, Makoto ItohBackground & Aims: Mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule (MAdCAM.1) is an adhesion molecule expressed in Peyer's Patches and lytnphoid tissues which is mobilized by cytokines like TNF-~x and is a major determinant of lymphocyte trafficking to the gut in human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Previous reports suggest that the effectiveness of rebamipide, a mucoprotective agent, enema therapy in 1BD patients via affecting epithelial cells. However, the mechanisms responsible for the rebamipide actions are not fully elucidated.Here we examine the effect of rebamipide on endothelial cells. Methods: SVEC 4-10 (SVEC), a murine small vascular endothelial cell line, was used to study the effect of rebamipide (1-1000 gtM) on TNF-ix-induced MAdCAM-1 expression by RT-PCR, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence. Lymphocyte adhesion assay was performed using TK-1 lymphocytes which express high levels of ~x4137 integrin. Results: TNF-c~ induced both MAdCAM-1 mRNA and protein in a dose-and time-dependent manner. MG132, a proteasome inhibitor blocked TNF-cc-induced MAdCAM-1 expression. These data indicate that TNF-a induced MAdCAM. 1 upregnlation through NF-KB activation. Rebamipide blocked TNF-a-induced MAdCAM. 1 dose-dependently. Rebamipide prevented IKB phosphorylation, IKB degradation and NF. KB activation. TNF-c~-induced lymphocyte adhesion was significantly blocked by rebamipide and MAdCAM-1 antibody. MAdCAM-1 was often localized to endothelial junctions and the expression was blocked by rebamipide. Conclusions: Rebamipide inhibits MAdCAM-1 induction on endothelial ceils by blocking NF-KB activation. These data indicate that rebami. pide can exert therapeutic activity in IBD through MAdCAM-1 inhibition.Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) Induced Leukocyte Recruitment in the Intestine: Role for a CD14 Independent Pathway Chang-Wen Chen, Donna-Marie McCafferty It is well documented that LPS acts through CD14 and TLR4 receptors to induce inflammatory responses. However, recent evidence suggests that there is a CD14-independent role in Some tissues. Chemokine receptor CXCR4, growth differentiation factor 5 (GDFS), heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) were shown in vitro to associate with LPS withoutCD14 (Triantafilou et al, Nat Immunol 2:338, 2001). The aim of this study is to assess the role of CD14 independent pathway in LPS-induced leukocyte recruitment in the intestine of mice. Materials and Methods: Intestinal leukocyte trafficking was observed using fluorescence intravital microscopy. Leukocyte kinetics were quantified in CD14-deficient (CD 14 v), TLR4-deficient (TLR4 /) or appropriate wild type (WT) control mice (n = 5). Mice were challenged intraperitoneally with highly purified LPS (E. colt 0111:B4, 5-500 ~g/kg) and submucosal vessels of the intestine were studied 4 h later. LPS-induced gene expression in the intestine was determined by cDNA microarray (mouse 7K, Stratagene) in WT and CD14 / mice. Results: In WT mice, LPS (500 ~g/Kg, i.p.), induced a significant increase in leukocyte adhesion (16.8 \u00b1 2.8 vs. 0.1 + 0.1 cells/100 /~m), a significant decrease in leukocyte rolling velocity (10.3 \u00b1 3.0 vs. 110.9 + 11.9 ~m/s) and flux (3.3 + 1.0 vs. 28.1 \u00b1 4.6 cells/rain) over saline treated controls. No significant changes in leukocyte kinetics were observed in LPS-treated TLR4 v mice over WT saline treated controls. However, LPS treatment in CD 14 ~ mice induced a significant increase in leukocyte adhesion (6.3 + 0.6 cells/100 ~m) and a decrease in leukocyte velocity (16.8 \u00b1 3.5 p, rrds) compared to WT controls. This CD14-independent increase in leukocyte adhesion was shown to be dose dependent. Microarray analysis of intestinal genes showed 113 genes in WT mice and 111 genes in CD14/-mice were upregulated at least 2-fold after LPS treatment. Interestingly, HSP70 and HSP90 were upregulated 2.8 fold and 4.2 fold respectively in CD144 mice only, while CXCR4 and GDF5 were not significantly altered. Conclusion: These data show in vivo, that leukocyte recruitment to the intestine can occur in part via a CD14-independent pathway. In addition, HSP70 and HSP90 may participate in the inflammation in the absence of CD14.Gastric MucosalHyperplasia via Upregnlation of Gastrin Induced by Chronic Activation of Gastric Innate Immunity Tnshiro Fukui, Akiyoshi Nishio, Hiroshi Kitamura, Satoko Inoue, Keiichi Kiriya, Shinya Ohashi, Hazuki Yoshizawa, Masanori Asada, Minoru Matsuura, Kimio Kawasaki, Hiroynki Tamaki, Hiroshi Nakase, Kazuichi Okazaki, Tsutomu Chiba",

WeinstockDouble blind studies show that helminths suppress integtinal inflammation in human IBD. We showed that H. polygyrus, a belminth that uniquely inhabitates mouse duodenum, inhibits TNBS and ILl0-/-colitis. We hypothesize that helminths induce immunoregnlatory pathways that limit intestinal inflammation. Since some studies suggest that LPS from gut flora drives colitis, we studied the influence of helminths on LPS-induced lamina propria mononuclear cell (LPMC) cytokine responses in mice. 200 H. polygyrus were administered by gastric lavage into 5-7 week old healthy C57BL/6 mice. Two weeks later, terminal ileal LPMC were isolated and stimulated in vitro with 100 ng/ml LPS for 48h to induce cytokine production, measured by ELISA. Although LPS can stimulate 1L12 production, in both worm-colonized and control mice LPS failed to modulate IL12 p40 secretion, However, LPS strongly induced LPMC from worm-infected animals to secrete TG]:I3 (cells only 96 + 9.6 pg/ml; cells + LPS 188 _+ 14 pg/ml; p<0.001, N = 6), whereas TGFI3 stimulation was not seen in LPMC from uninfected animals. As T regulatory cells (Treg) express TLR4 and thus sense LPS, we determined if LP T cells from worm-infected mice were LES responsive. Isolated LP T cells, positively selected to >98% purity as per FACS analysis, were cultured with or without LPS. Isolation technique did not activate T cells as shown by IFNy as well as IL4 ELISA. Again LPS stimulated isolated T cell TGF~ secretion from 110-+ 10 pg/ml to 228-+2 pg/ml (p<0.001, N=6). Also, using PCR, we showed that these T cells express TLR4 transcripts. Next we tested if the same kmmunomodulatory circuit was active in the ILl04-mouse colitis model. LPMCs from IL 10 KO animals were cultured with or without LPS stimulation. LPS induced TGFI3 secretion in LPMC without affecting ILl2 p4-0 production. Similarly, in purified LP T cells from ILl0 -/-mice, TGF[3 was increased from 89_+5 pg/ ml to 195 -+ 13 pg/ml (p<0.001, N = 8). This suggests that this regulatory pathway normally can be called into play during episodes of colitis. Conclusions: Intestinal worms alter LPMC LPS responsiveness promoting anti-inflammatory (TGFI3) rather than proinflammatory (ILl2) cytokme synthesis. This paradoxical response could be associated with TLR4-expressing mucosal T cells suggesting that helminths induce mucosa[ Treg that help protect from intestinal inflammation. LPS generated by intestinal organisms thus could serve to promote intestinal immune tranquility during periods of colitis.

CzinnPurpose: To understand the phenotypic and functional changes in isolated Iamina propria dendritic cells and in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells in response to probiotic. Background: Probiotics are of increasing use against intestinal disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease. Dendritic cells (DC) are potent antigen presenting cells which induce primary immune responses against microbial and other stimuli. The role of gut DC in IBD has not been well studied. Methods: BALB/c mice bone marrow-derived DC were generated in the presence of GM-CSF with the addition of probiotic mixture VSL#3 or other bacteria. Lamina propria DC were isolated by collagenase digestion of mouse colons and subsequent selection for CDllc positive cells. Colitis was induced in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice by reconstitution with CD45RBhi CD4 + donor BALB/c spleen T cells intravenously. Starting three days after cell transfer, probiotic was administered on alternate days by addition to the drinking water, until the onset of diarrhea in control PBS treated mice, at which time treatment was ceased. Results: Probiotic mixture (107 organisms/ml) upregulated the expression of costimulatory molecules CD40, CDS0, CD86, and of MHC class II i-A d on DC. In comparison with PBS or other bacteria, probiotic significantly enhanced levels of interleukin-10 released in DC cultures. Probiotic treated DC did not induce allogeneic CD4 + T cell proliferation above observed stimulation for PBS treated DC. Isolation of mononuclear cells from the lamina propria o[ colitic SCID mice resulted in 30 xl0 ~ cells/ colon in comparison with 3.5 x 10 \u00b0 cells/colon for control donor mice. inAb antibody staining and flow cytometry showed that these cells from colitic SCID mice contained 19% CD11c + cells expressing high levels of CD80, B7-DC and MHC class I1, but not expressing B220 or CDSa, and with morphological characteristics consistent with mature and immature DC as shown by Giemsa staining. Cell purification yielded 3.75 x 106 CD11c+ DC/inflamed colon. BALB/c lamina propria cells contained 3% CD1 lc positive cells and lacked costimulatory molecule expression. Initial studies with probiotic treated reconstituted SCID mice reveal that probiotic delayed the onset of diarrhea by 3-4 weeks. Conclusions: Probiotic administration is effective in the prevention of SCID mouse 1BD. Probiotic VSL#3 modulates bone marrow-derived DC. DC isolated from the lamina pmpria of 1BD mice are mature in comparison with those from normal mice. The regulation of intestinal DC by probiotic in IBD is under investigation.Non-Pathogenic Escherichia Coli Inhibits Signal Transduction Pathway in Intestinal Epithelial Cells: A Novel Mechanism of ActionKeinchi Maeda, Nagamu Inoue, Nobuhiko Kamada, Kyoung Su Hong, Harnhiko Ogata, Hiromasa Ishii, Toshifumi Hibi Background and aim: The results of clinical trial demonstrated that treatment with nonpathogenic E. coli strain Nissle1917 (Mutaflor) is effective in maintaining remission in patients with ulcerative colitis. However, very little is known about the mode of action of Nissle1917. The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of Nissle1917 on inflammatory process of intestinal epithelial cells in vitro using colon cancer cell lines. Methods: We investigated whether N/sale 1917 suppressed interleukin-8 (IL-8) production in HCT15 colon cancer cells stimulated by TNF-a for 30 rain. As controls, E. coli K12DHlOB and IEO15034 were used. Cells were treated with 105 CFU/ml of E. cob prior to TNF-a stimulation, then harvested and analyzed for cellular 1k-8 protein by ELISA and mRNA by RT-PCR. NF-KB activity was assessed with Western blotting and electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using cellular or nuclear protein. IL-8 promoter-luciferase plasmid were cotransfected with pRL-TK into HCT15 cells. After TNF-c~ stimulation, cells were harvested and luciferase activity was measured. Results: When HCT15 cells were incubated with 105 cfu/ml of Nissle1917 for 4 hour prior to stimulation with TNF-a, IL-8 production was significantly suppressed in protein and mRNA levels. Even at the condition where Nissle1917 and HCT15 cells were separated by the 0.2 mm filter (using Transwell system), IL-8 protein production was suppressed. Western blot analysis demon strated that Nissle1917 did not inhibit IKB degradation or NF-KB p65 subunit translocation to the nucleus. EMSA demonstrated that Nissle1917 did not inhibit NF-KB binding to probe DNA induced by TNF-cc However, Nissle1917 suppressed increased IL-8 gene promoter activity induced by TNF-a to nonstimulated level in IL-8 promoter plasmtd transfection assay. Conclusion: These results suggest that Nissle1917 or its secretory factor inhibit IL-8 transcription by modulating the post NF-KB-DNA binding process, such as chromatin remodeling.Bacterial Diversity and Normal Anaerobic Bacterial Flora is Restored in Pouchitis Through Probiotic TherapyTanja Kuehbacher, Stephan Ott, Toshiki Mimura, Ulf Helwig, Paolo Gionchetti, Femando Rizzello, Massimo Campieri, Michael Kamm, Foelsch R.

(CDI la/CD18), plays a 'crmcal role m trafflckmg to both lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues. As such, it has been targeted in therapy of irdlammatory diseases, including 1BD, in both animal models and human disease. However, in addition to its role as a trafficking molecule, there is substantial in vitro evidence that LEA-1 can contribute to T cell activation, both in its role as an adhesion molecule, and through other non-adhesive mechanisms. Therefore, it is important to understand the consequences of targeting LEA-1 in disease therapy, in terms of the spectrum of impact on immune cell trafficking, as well as the effect on other immune responses. At this time, the contribution of LFA-1 to T cell activation, in particular CD4+ T cell activation, in vivo has been less clear. There are numerous reports describing T cell response defects in vivo; however, due to the severe T cell migration defect to lymphoid structures in the absence of LEA-l, it has been difficult to dissect if there is also a T cell activation deficit contributing to the in vivo T cell function defects observed. Specifically, the decreased number of T cells in the lymph nodes and various other lymphoid sites secondary to the migration defect may be the dominant etiology of the defect in T cell responses. To investigate the role of LFA-1 in vivo, we used mice deficient in CD18, such that no 1.FA-1 is expressed on the cell surface. The ED18-/-mice were then crossed to DO11.10 T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice, which encode an ovalbumin-specific, lAd-restricted TCR. This system allows for segregating the tmgration defect from the T cell activation defect as there is an antibody directed to the DOl1.10 TCR, and we are able to follow these antigen-specific T cells in vivo. Cell division was used as a measure of T cell activation by utilizing CFSE-labeled DO11.10 CD4 + T cells. We have found that CESE-labeled CD18-/-CD4+ DOll.10 T cells adoptively transferred into wild-type mice have a defect in reaching later cell divisions in the peripheral lymph nodes upon immunization with subcutaneous LPS/ovalbumin. Furthermore, the defect in CD18-/-CD4+ DO11.10 T cell activation is more severe upon IV kPS/ovalbumin immunization. The CD18-/-T cell activation defects are accompanied by functional consequences in IFN-T production and antibody isotype switching. Therefore, in addition to the significant role LFA-1 plays in naive T cell migration to peripheral lymph nodes, we demonstrate that it is clearly also important for CD4 + T cell activation in vivo. compared to normal rats. Lactulose treatment ameliorated DSS-induced colitis in a dosedependent manner, and at 1000 mg/kg all of the parameters examined, except TBARS, were shown to improve significantly as compared to controls. The muc6sal damage scores in the groups treated with 300,600 and 1000 mg/kg of lactulose were 186.6 +/-65 mm2, 175.9 +/-61.1 mm2 and 109.3 +/-46.5 ram2, respectively, the last two being significantly lower (p<0.01) as compared to the control value (287.3+/-44.1 ram2). A dose-dependent and significant (p<0.01) inhibition of DSS-induced colon shortening was also observed in all Iactulose-treated groups, while the MPO activity was significantly (p<O.01) reduced by only 1000 mg/kg of lactulose. The microscopical grading in the severity of tissue damage was remarkably reduced by lactulose. On the other hand, the antibiotics metronidazole prevented the occurrence of DSS-induced UC in a dose-dependent manner, the inhibition at 30 rag/ kg being over 80%. Conclusion: These results demonstrated the protective effect of lactulose in this rat colitis model and suggested that the background of this lactulose effect may be due to alterations of colonic microflora. The ongoing determination of the changes in colonic microflora induced by lactulose may clarify the mechanism of action.",

            "text": "Butyrate Mediated Phosphorylation and Targeting of Hsp25 to Mitochondria in IEC-18 Cells: Role of p38 MAP Kinase Mark ]. Ropeleski Background: The induction of Hsp25 by butyrate is associated with increased epithelial resistance to injury. While the functional compartmentalization of Hsp25 in the IEC-18 cell is unknown, it may involve p38 MAP kinase-mediated alterations in Hsp25 phosphorylation. We hypothesized that changes in Hsp25 phosphorylation may mediate the protective properties of butyrate. Methods: IEC-18 cells were treated with butyrate for 6-24 hrs. Immunolocalization of Hsp25 was carried out by confocal laser microscopy. Hsp25 phosphorylation was examined using 2-D iso-electric focusing gel electrophoresis. The accumulation of Hsp25 in cytoskeletal-enriched fractions was examined in Triton X-IO0 insoluble protein fractions. Hsp25 accumulation in mitochondrial-enriched fractions was studied by immunoblotting. The activation of p38 MAP kinase by butyrate was determined using phospho-specific antibodies. Results: Treatment of IEC-18 cells with butyrate resulted in the generalized accumulation of Hsp25 in the cell at 12-24 hrs by Western blot and confocal microscopy. Hsp25 did not concentrate in Triton X-IO0 insoluble fractions. Hsp25 did accumulate in mitochondrial-enriched fractions, an event that was paralleled by the accumulation of phosphorylated Hsp25 isoforms at 12-24 hrs. p38 MAPK phosphorylation also coincided with changes in Hsp25 while the accumulation of phospho-Hsp25 was partially attenuated by the inhibitor SB203580. Conclusion: Butyrate mediated changes in Hsp25 phosphorylation are associated with Hsp25 enrichment of mitochondrial fractions. This phosphorylation appears to coincide with and partially depend on the activation of the p38 MAP kinase. We speculate that the targeting of Hsp25 by butyrate to mitochondria in order to antagonize ensuing cytochrome c release, assembly of the apoptosome and/or caspase activation during pro-apoptotic intestinal epithelial cell stress in inflammation may be an important path of cellular defense in non-transformed cells.",
