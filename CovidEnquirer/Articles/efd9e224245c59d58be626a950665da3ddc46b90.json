All members have well-developed salt glands, which are located dorsal to the orbit and are used in salt homeostasis by excreting salt in drops over the bill. It is an adaptation that allows the ingestion of saltwater and saltwater prey without the need to drink fresh water. Salt metabolism is also regulated by renal excretion. The sense of smell is well developed in Procellariformes, and many species may detect the smell of certain oils in the water for locating food in the open sea. The sense of smell also serves a purpose in locating nesting sites or burrows, and this function may even be more significant than prey detection in some species of diving feeders, which may rely on few olfactory cues for prey location. Many species are well adapted for nocturnal vision, which may be crucial for the underground nesting species and for predator avoidance when returning to nesting sites at night. In some species, nocturnal vision likely is an adaptation for feeding at night. Most Procellariform species are highly adapted for long distance flight and gliding, an energy-conserving strategy that allows the larger mass birds to travel long distances.

Some families (e.g., Diomedeidae) contain a large number of species at some risk of extinction. For primarily inland aquatic species (loons and grebes), the threats include the draining of wetland areas, human disturbance, pollution (specifically heavy metals and pesticides), and exposure to coastal oil spills during overwintering in marine environments. Marine seabirds are threatened by overharvesting for food, feathers, and oil; accidental bycatch during fishing operations; habitat disturbance of nesting grounds (including guano harvesting); pollution; and predation by introduced species (rats, cats, pigs, mongoose). Introduced predators may destroy or eat the eggs, the chicks, and the adults sitting on nesting sites, causing a significant impact on the populations in a relatively short timespan. Large-scale harvesting of fish by indiscriminate use of explosives, an illegal practice in many countries, may have a significant impact by affecting large groups of birds during feeding congregations. In addition, long-line fishing operations present a specific risk to many Procellariformes, as the birds get accidentally entangled in lines and die by drowning. Many species are prone to ingesting indigestible pieces of waste and garbage created by humans, specifically plastic, and this has been a threat to albatross species and their chicks. The epidemiology of infectious diseases has not been extensively studied in colonies, but the risk of virulent diseases spreading could be significant to the continued survival of some species, in particular those with limited nesting sites or isolated populations. The introduction and spread of foreign infectious diseases to established, naive colonies could have a significant effect at the population level.",

The lobes are flared as the foot pushes back to form a paddle effect and propel the bird forward during a stroke.

Regular epizootics affect general juveniles near fledging, causing high mortality after a period of blisters on the web of the feet and, sometimes, conjunctivitis. It is thought that the virus overwinters in other species such as fulmars and gulls, suggesting that other Procellariformes are susceptible. In one instance, it was suspected that the black-browed albatross served as an intermediate host between shearwaters and penguins. 5 Serological evidence of adenoviral infections is common during health surveys of aquatic birds, 5 but the significance is often not clear, since links to clinical disease are missing and because most serologic testing has some limitations. Antibodies to avian influenza viruses and evidence of viral presence are common in seabird colonies. Some strains of avian influenza may be present at enzootic levels and circulate in seabird colonies, often being shared between species, but documentation of the dynamics and epidemiology of suggest on first impression, and objective monitoring of body weight should be used as a baseline. Special attention should be given to plumage (for parasites, waterproofing, flight feather quality); to the tubular structures of the nares (for patency), and to the feet (for evidence of pododermatitis). The open oral cavity should be visualized, and the coelomic cavity should be palpated carefully for evidence of foreign bodies (specifically, ingested pieces of plastic).",

Besides the physical damage caused to the feathers and the integument, oil negates the thermoregulatory and waterproofing capabilities of an aquatic bird' s plumage, leading to energy lost through loss of body heat. Accidental ingestion of oil may have toxic systemic effects. A mass stranding of 14 species of birds, including loons and grebes, was attributed to surfactant-like proteins produced on the water surface by organic matter associated with a red-tide event caused by the dinoflagellate Akashima sanguinea. 8 Albatrosses, petrels, and other marine fish-eating animals are susceptible to accidental death by drowning caused by fishing operations. Line fishing is particularly dangerous to birds that follow ships in their search of fish and may get caught and dragged by the fishing line, eventually dying by drowning.
