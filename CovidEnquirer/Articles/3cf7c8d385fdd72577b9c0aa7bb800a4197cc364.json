Kaohsiung CGMH temporarily discontinued all emergency and hospital services. By the end of the SARS epidemic in Taiwan (July 2003), there were 347 confirmed cases and 37 confirmed deaths. 13 Because of its high infectivity and hazard to global health, scientists have attempted to develop reliable tests, find effective treatment protocols and determine the key epidemiologic parameters that affect the spread of SARS-CoV. 2 Previously, we found that some SARS patients in Taiwan had no apparent contact histories or travel histories to epidemic areas, suggesting that there might have been a sporadic community spread, especially in Taipei City and in Kaohsiung City.",
