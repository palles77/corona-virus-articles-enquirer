            "text": "We have recently described the cloning of a portion of the hepatitis E virus (HEV) and confirmed its etiologic association with enterically transmitted (waterborne, epidemic) non-A, non-B hepatitis. The virus consists of a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 7.5 kb, with a polyadenylated 3' end. We now report on the cloning and nucleotide sequencing of an overlapping, contiguous set of cDNA clones representing the entire genome of the HEV Burma strain [HEV(B)]. The largest open reading frame extends approximately 5 kb from the 5' end and contains the RNA-directed RNA polymerase and nucleoside triphosphate binding motifs. The second major open reading frame (ORF2) begins 37 bp downstream of the first and extends approximately 2 kb to the termination codon present 65 bp from the 3' terminal stretch of poly(A) residues. ORF2 contains a consensus signal peptide sequence at its amino terminus and a capsid-like region with a high content of basic amino acids similar to that seen with other virus capsid proteins. A third open reading frame partially overlaps the first and second and encompasses only 369 bp. In addition to the 7.5-kb full-length genomic transcript, two subgenomic polyadenylated messages of approximately 3.7 and 2.0 kb were detected in infected liver using a probe from the 3' third of the genome. The genomic organization of the virus is consistent with the 5' end encoding nonstructural and the 3' end encoding the viral structural gene(s). The expression strategy of the virus involves the use of three different open reading frames and at least three different transcripts. HEV was previously determined to be a nonenveloped particle with a diameter of 27-34 nm. These findings on the genetic organization and expression strategy of HEV suggest that it is the prototype human pathogen for a new class of RNA virus or perhaps a separate genus within the Caliciviridae family. o tsst Academic PWSS, IIX.",

Available serological tests allow the diagnosis of acute hepatitis due to infection with hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV). HBV is required for propagation of the delta agent, or hepatitis D virus (HDV); this co-infection results in a high proportion of cases progressing to chronic active hepatitis. The clinical and diagnostic exclusion of HAV and HBV led to the recognition of other viral hepatitides that were formerly grouped together as non-A, non-B hepatitis (NANBH) (Prince et a/., 1974; Feinstone et a/., 1975; Tabor, 1985) .",

The cloning of a blood-borne agent, termed hepatitis C virus (HCV) by us and others led to the development of a specific assay for circulating antibody to HCV (Choo etal., 1989; Kuo et al., 1989; Kubo eta/, 1989; Maeno et al., 1990; Reyes et a/., 1991 d) . This assay predomi-nantly detects infections at the chronic stage, but has facilitated the identification of HCV as the cause of up to 90% of parenterally transmitted NANBH. A second epidemiologically distinct form of NANBH was shown to occur in both epidemic and sporadic patterns in developing countries and is referred to as enterically transmitted non-A, non-B hepatitis (ET-NANBH) due to its water-borne mode of virus transmission and presumed enteric route of infection (Khuroo, 1980; Wong et a/., 1980) . ET-NANBH has been documented in India, Pakistan, Burma, USSR, Costa Rica, Mexico, and countries in Africa, where epidemic outbreaks can generally be traced to fecal contamination of drinking water (Bradley and Maynard, 1986; Bradley, 1990b) . The causative viral agent was previously shown to passage successfully in cynomolgus macaques (cyno) and tamarins with typical liver enzyme elevations and recovery of morphologically similar 27-to 34-nm viruslike particles from the feces of clinical specimens and experimental animals (Balayan et al,, 1983; Anjaparidze et al., 1986; Bradley et al., 1987; Arankalle et al., 1988) .",

G-tailed cDNA was made essentially as described before (Tam et al., 1989) . Briefly, first strand cDNA primed with HEV sequence-specific primer C (see Fig. 1 ) was tailed with dGTP using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. The modified cDNA was then amplified in a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (Saiki et al., 1985; Mullis and Faloona, 1987) employing the same synthetic HEV primer and an oligo(dC) primer, both of which contained an EcoRl cloning site at the 5' end. All four cDNA libraries were screened with appropriate synthetic oligomer probes (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) described under Results. Hybridizations were generally performed in duplicate (using 32P kinased probes) at 42\" in 30% formamide, 5X SSC, 5X Denhardt's (0.1% ficoll, 0.1% polyvinylpyrrolidone, 0.1% BSA), 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.0, and 50 @g/ml salmon sperm DNA.

Bife was chosen as the RNA source for cDNA synthesis because it contained relatively large numbers of virus particles when HEV cDNA clones were identified from libraries made from randomly primed cyno bile (solid square), or from cyno liver after priming by oligo-dT (solid circle), random sequence hexamers (open circle) and HEV-sequence specific oligonucleotides (open square). The designations given to the various clones are indicated together with their sizes and relative position and overlap along the -7.5 kb genome. A and B represent synthetic oligonucleotides used for the generation and screening, respectively, of specifically primed cDNA libraries, The anchor PCR strategy using G-tailing and PCR (primer C) was used in the synthesis of primer extension libraries for the extreme 5' end. The procedure yielded numerous clones by hybridization with primer D, of which BET-EXPCR2 is a representative example. Primer extension studies confirmed the 5' extent of the viral genome (see Fig. 2 ). The BET1 clone contained a long stretch of poly(A) residues at its 3' end indicating its position at the 3' terminus of the viral genome. compared with fecal preparations. It was also expected that the lower sequence complexity would enhance the sensitivity of the differential (plus/minus) screening protocol used for clone identification. ET1 .l contained a 1.3-kb EcoRl fragment that was exogenous to both human and cyno genomic DNA and specifically hybridized to cDNA derived only from infected sources (Reyes et al., 1990) . Oligonucleotides based on the end sequences of ET1 .1 were used as hybridization probes to rescreen the original bile-derived cDNA library. The largest identified clone, BETG-1, contained a 2.6-kb EcoRl insert. Restriction mapping revealed that the original ET1 .l clone was contained within the larger BETG-1 ( Fig. 1; Fry et a/., 1991) .",

The resulting extension products for each synthesis reaction were, respectively, 50 and 51 bp longer than the expected product, thereby suggesting that the 5' end of BET-SPl was about 50 nucleotides from the 5' end of the virus (Fig. 2) . After several failed attempts at cloning the remaining 5' end sequences by oligonucleotide hybridization of specifically primed cDNA libraries, an alternative expansion/enrichment procedure of PCR amplification of specifically primed G-tailed cDNA was applied (Tam et al., 1989 ). An atiquot of the amplified material was fcoRl digested, electrophoresed, blotted, and probed with a 5' internal HEV oligomer (primer D). This hybridization study confirmed the amplification of the &aired HEV extension products (data not shown). This same DNA, after preparative gel etectrophoresis, was recovered and ligated into Xgtl 0. The specific priming procedure (followed by PCR amplification) resulted in a high percentage (over 10%) of HEV-positive recombinants in the enriched library. BET-EXPCR2 is a representative clone from over 50 analyzed; all of these were 50 bp in length and therefore in agreement with the primer extension experiment.

A representation of the potential ORFs and stop codons in the three positive-polarity frames is presented in Fig. 4a . Two large potential ORFs were found in the first and second reading frames. ORFl begins at the 5' end of the viral genome after 27 bp of apparent noncoding sequence at the 5' end, and then extends 5079 bp before termination at nucleotide position 5107. The second major ORF (ORF2) begins at nucleotide position 5147 and extends 1980 bp before terminating 65 bp upstream of the poly(A) tail. The termination of ORFl and the transition into ORF2 was confirmed by sequencing the region in question five times using two different HEV sequencespecific primers. The sequence of a second clone in this region yielded the same results. Furthermore, cDNA clones isolated directly from infected human (Huang et al., 1991 , data not shown). A third positive-polarity reading frame of 369 bp (ORF3) overlaps both ORFl and ORF2 and was found by independent experiments to encode an immunoreactive epitope recognized by sera from HEV-infected humans and animals (Yarbough et af., 1991; Reyes et a/., 1991b) .

The overall frequencies for HEV and HCV are similar (-58% G + C), but differ markedly from that of HAV (37% G + C). The relatively high G + C content results in a higher overall frequency of codons containing G + C throughout the HEV coding sequence. This contrasts with the CG dinucleotide discrimination in the second and third position that has been noted in human coding sequences (Nussinov, 1981) . There appears to be a slight selection for codons ending in C, which is also seen with HCV; however, the discrimination against codons ending in A is far more apparent (-9%) and is a unique fea?ure of HEV when compared to HAV and HCV.

The forward (positive-sense) orientation was defined by strand-specific hybridization of genomic RNA (Reyes et al.. 1991 b) and the identification of consensus sequence motifs related to nonstructural gene products in ORFl (Kamer and Argos, 1984) .

Note the large hydrophobic region at the beginning of the sequence that marks the putative signal sequence highlighted in Fig. 3. against A is shared by the structural ORF region of another positive-strand RNA virus, rubella virus, where the frequency of A is only 7% (Frey and Marr, 1988) . HEV and HCV are also similar in their apparent preference for G in the first coding position (35 and 33%, respectively).",

            "text": "The computer translation of the partial nucleotide sequence from clone ET1 .1 led to the detection of a conserved amino acid motif recognized in all positivestrand RNA viruses (Reyes er a/., 1990; Fry et a/., 199 1). The canonical Gly-Asp-Asp (GDD) tripeptide (amino acids 1550-l 552, identified by asterisks in Fig.  3) is believed to encode a portion of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RDRP) gene critical to viral replication (Kamer and Argos, 1984) . Translation of the complete ORFl revealed a second region 5' to the RDRP gene bearing similarity to another nonstructural gene product (Fry et a/., 199 1) . Two well-conserved sequence motifs have been found in association with purine nucleoside triphosphate (NTP)-binding activity (Gentry, 1985; Strauss and Strauss, 1988) . The first, site A (G/AXXXXGKS/T), is represented in the HEV sequence by GVPGSGKS at amino acid position 975-982 (underlined in Fig. 3) . A version of the second NTP- binding motif, site B (DEAD), occurs approximately 46 amino acids downstream (3') from site A and is represented in HEV by the partially conserved amino acid sequence DEAP at position 1029-l 032 (underlined in Fig. 3 ). The latter site is believed to interact with the Mg+2 cation of the Mg-NTP complex for RNA-or DNA-dependent NTPase activity. A superfamily of helicases involved in replication, recombination, and DNA repair has been described with consensus features similar to those described here for NTP-binding (Gorbalenya eta/., 1989). These nonstructural genesimilarities are seen in other geographically distinct isolates of HEV and may indicate a putative helicase function for this region. The localization of an NTP-binding domain and the RDRP gene to ORFl is consistent with a genomic organization where the nonstructural genes are expressed from the 5' end of the viral genome. Translation of the second major open reading frame, ORF2, indicated a novel polypeptide not present in the PIR protein database. The hydropathicity plot of the sequence indicated a large hydrophobic domain at the amino terminus of ORF2 followed by a hydrophilic electropositive peak (Fig. 4~ ). The hydrophobic region marks a typical signal sequence (amino acids 5 to 22) and contains a potential cleavage site (PAIPPP) as predicted by the lntelligenetics eukaryotic secretory signal sequence program. In ORF2, between residues 22 and 322, nearly 10% of the amino acids are arginine conferring a high isoelectric point (pl = 10.35) to the first half of the ORF2 polypeptide. The basic charge of capsid proteins is believed to indicate their involvement in the encapsidation of the genomic transcript by effectively neutralizing the electronegatively charged RNA (Dalgarno ef al,, 1983; Rice et a/., 1985) . The mechanism of capsid assembly in HEV, and the exact nature of the membrane targeting (if any) of the ORF2 polypeptide, will require further study. Such studies will be facil-itated by the availability of an appropriate in vitro propagation system for HEV and immunospecific anti-HEV reagents.",

Additional evidence for the encoded polyprotein having a function in viral replication is provided by the presence of conserved motifs involved in purine NTPase activity found in a variety of cellular and viral helicases (Geider and Hoffman-Berling, 1981) . These helicases promote the unwinding of DNA, RNA, or DNA-RNA duplexes required for genome replication, recombination, repair, and transcription.

This pattern of gene expression employed by HEV has not been described in the various families of single-stranded positive-sense, nonenveloped RNA viruses affecting humans or animals. Among the enveloped RNA viruses, the structural proteins of rubella virus and certain alphaviruses are found in a different reading frame from those encoding the nonstructural proteins and are also expressed from a subgenomic 3'end transcript (Ou eta/., 1982) . The presence of HEV-specific subgenomic RNAs localized to the 3' one-third of the genome suggests that these may be the transcripts from which these 3' end ORFs are expressed and is indicative of a unique expression strategy among nonenveloped positive-sense RNA viruses infecting humans. The mechanism by which these subgenomic transcripts are generated is unknown. The differential abundance of the various messages (i.e., 7.6 kb > 2 kb > 3.7 kb; see Fig.  5 ) does, however, suggest active transcriptional regulation rather than genomic RNA fragmentation as the means by which these subgenomic messages are generated. This would in turn imply the existence of an internal RNA initiation sequence and expression from the anti-genomic strand. Experiments are currently in progress to map the 5'ends of these subgenomic transcripts. We at this time, however, cannot exclude other mechanisms of expression for ORF2 and ORF3 including frameshifting or internal translation initiation, although there is little evidence for the latter among other positive-sense RNA viruses (March and Haenni, 1987) . It is also possible that complex RNA splicing could account for these subgenomic messages although there is evidence that Northern hybridization probes from the extreme 5' end failed to detect hybridization to the 3.7-and 2.0-kb messages (A. W. Tam, unreported) . 6 . HEV genomic organization: The proposed organization of the HEV genome is presented with the nonstructural genes encoded by the 5' ORFl and the structural genes located at the 3' end of the genome (ORF2 and possibly ORF3). The genomic organization, nature of the virus particle (enveloped or nonenveloped), presence of subgenomic messages, and the presence of a 3'terminal poly(A) addition is compared for the various positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus families.

The 5' nonstructural/3 structural genomic organization of HEV is similar to that found in the alphavirus, rubivirus, and coronavirus families (see Fig.  6 ). There is an absence of any significant homology with these enveloped viruses at both the nucleotide and amino acid levels (excluding the canonical amino acid residues noted above for the nonstructural gene products). Immune electron microscopy has clearly established that the virions of HEV are 27-to 34-nm nonenveloped viral particles and are therefore clearly distinguished from these enveloped viruses. Picornaviruses are small nonenveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense, polyadenylated RNA viruses. The various members of the picornaviridae, however, exhibit vastly different genomic organization (Siddell, 1987) . HEV has been shown to be unrelated antigenically and biophysically to picornaviruses (Arankalle, 1988) .",

Recently the nucleotide sequence of a large portion of the nonstructural gene region of feline calicivirus (FCV) has become available for comparison to HEV (Neill, 1990) . Although having a similar overall genomic organization to that of HEV with 5'-nonstructural and 3'-structural genes, it is clear that FCV shares a higher degree of similarity with picornaviruses in the recognized nonstructural gene motifs. The proposed gene order for the nonstructural polypeptides in FCV is 2C (NTP-binding), 3C (cysteine protease), followed by the 3D gene (RDRP). The distance between the NTP-binding site motif A and the GDD triplet of the RORP is 1100 amino acids in FCV compared to rhe 568 amino acids in HEV. In addition there is no evidence in the HEV sequence for an intervening cysteine prateaselike region as recognized in FCV. These finding8 would further suggests that HEV represents either the prototype member of an as yet unclassified novel virus family or perhaps a separate genus within the calciviridae. It is too early, however, to propose 8 dlfinitive classification of HEV beyond the hypothesis presented here based on the proposed genetic organization and expression strategy of the virus.",
