The three component substrate is characterized by single-stranded DNA target, an oligonucleotide probe, separated from a helper oligonucleotide by a one base gap. The oligonucleotide probe contains a non-fluorescent quencher at the 5 0 end and fluorophore attached to the 3 0 end through a special rigid linker. Fluorescence of the oligonucleotide probe is efficiently quenched by the interaction of terminal dye and quencher when not hybridized. Upon hybridization of the oligonucleotide probe and helper probe to their complementary target, the phosphodiester linkage between the rigid linker and the 3 0 end of the probe is efficiently cleaved, generating a fluorescent signal. In this study, the use of the Endo IV assay as a post-PCR amplification detection system is demonstrated. High sensitivity and specificity are illustrated using single nucleotide polymorphism detection.",

            "text": "Nucleic acid assays utilizing cleavage enzymes to generate a fluorescent signal from dual-dye-labeled oligonucleotide probes have been extensively used in diagnostics (1) (2) (3) . In these assays, the ability of fluorescent dyes to transfer energy absorbed from light to nearby molecules forms the basis of homogeneous nucleic acid based assays (1, 4, 5) . In the unhybridized state the fluorophore and quencher are within close proximity, which allows the quencher to absorb energy from the fluorophore to affect quenching. The use of fluorogenic probes in a 5 0 -nuclease polymerase assay, where the probe is enzymatically cleaved to release the fluorophore (2) , is well known. The signal amplification reaction utilizes invasive cleavage with structure-specific 5 0 -nucleases (6) . The method requires annealing of two oligonucleotides, called the upstream oligonucleotide and the probe, to a target sequence, which results in the formation of a unique substrate for the 5 0 -nuclease. In the DNAzyme-PCR strategy the primer contains a target-specific sequence and harbors the antisense sequence of a 10-23 DNAzyme. During amplification, amplicons are produced containing active sense copies of DNAzymes that cleave a reporter substrate included in the reaction mixture (7) . A target nucleic acid sequence can be amplified exponentially in vitro under isothermal conditions by using three enzymatic activities essential to retroviral replication: reverse transcriptase, RNase H (RNA cleavage) and a DNA-dependent RNA polymerase (8) . Cycling probe technology represents a simple method for the detection of DNA target sequences, utilizing a chimeric DNA-RNA-DNA probe which is cleaved by RNase H when hybridized with its complementary target (9) .",

The first lesion ( Figure 1A ) is a typical abasic (apurinic or apyrimidinic site generated by spontaneous or enzymatic loss of a nucleic acid base. The second lesion ( Figure 1B) is an atypical abasic site appearing as a result of inherent instability of the 3 0 -phosphodiester bond in abasic deoxyribose in lesion 1 or its cleavage by a Class I AP endonuclease. As shown by the arrow, AP endonucleases cleave the phosphodiester linkage at the abasic sites. In the novel Endo IV assay a short probe with a fluorophore linked through a phosphate at the 3 0 end and a short enhancer oligonucleotide generate an artificial, lesion 2 type Endo IV substrate. This arrangement allows the specific and efficient cleavage of the phosphodiester bond of the probe by Endo IV and release of fluorescent dye ( Figure 1C ). The addition of a quencher at the 5 0 end of the probe allows quenching of the fluorescence in the uncleaved probe. The specific cleavage of the phosphate bond and the generation of fluorescence is the basis of the new assay.",

It was shown that Endo IV cleavage of the probe has a relatively flat pH optimum in the range between pH 8.5 and 9.5. For compatibility with post-PCR Endo IV amplification the assay buffer with pH 8.6 was chosen, similar to that of the PCR master mixture. Inclusion of the divalent magnesium cation in the buffer ranging from 0 to 20 mM, resulted in more than 2-fold increase in cleavage rate, the optimum range was $5-8 mM. A concentration of 5 mM was chosen for the Endo IV assay. It was determined that the monovalent cations, such as Li, Na, K and Rb, inhibit Endo IV cleavage activity for the concentrations studied in the range from 0 to 100 mM. An inhibition of $30% was observed at 20 mM monovalent cation concentration, which increased to $60-70% at 100 mM concentration. The optimum probe concentration was determined to be $600 nM, please see Supplementary Figures 1-3 . Figure 3A shows a model Endo IV assay that requires a target complementary to an enhancer and a probe labeled at the 5 0 end with an Eclipse Dark Quencher and a fluorescent dye at the 3 0 end. As shown, the probe (calculated T m \u00bc 46.7 C) and enhancer (calculated T m \u00bc 50.2 C) are separated by one base to mimic a natural abasic site. Four probes with different fluorescent dyes and linkers ( Figure 3B ) were evaluated for their performance in the new assay. Fluorophores FL1, FL2 and FL3 of the probes I, II and III (with similar quantum yields) contained a hydroxyprolinol linker between the 3 0 -phosphate of the probe sequence and the core of the dyes. Fluorophore FL4 of probe IV was analogous to FL3 of probe III, with an additional aminocaproic spacer introduced between the hydroxylprolinol moiety and the dye; the purpose of this spacer was to distance the fluorophore from the cleavage site.",

Targetdependent (specific) and target-independent (non-specific) cleavage rates of the probe were measured as the percent target cleaved per minute. The results are summarized in Table 1 . Probes I-III demonstrated similar specific cleavage. A 2-to 3-fold decrease in the rate of non-specific cleavage for probes II and III versus probe I was observed. These low, non-specific cleavage rates translate into high-specific to non-specific cleavage ratios. It appears that chloro-or chloro/ methyl substitutions in the fluorophores of probes II and III, respectively, are beneficial for the reduction of non-specific cleavage. One possible explanation for this reduction may be an effect of increased hydrophobicity of FL2 and FL3 on enzyme activity. In the case of probe IV, with the extended hydroxyprolinol linker, the rate of specific cleavage almost doubled. However, the corresponding increase in the rate of non-specific cleavage was $20 times higher than that observed in probe III, substantially compromising the ratio of specific to non-specific cleavage rates. Once again, this result implies the existence of inhibiting interactions between Endo IV enzymatic activity and fluorophore which can be adjusted by moving the fluorophore away from the active center.",

Probe lengths ranging from a 6mer to a 14mer were investigated and are shown in Figure 5 with calculated T m s of between 14 and 60 C. All the probes showed a bell-shaped relationship for cleavage rate with temperature. As expected, the cleavage rate for all probes increased with increased temperature. A relatively sharp cleavage rate optimum was observed for the probes a, b and c with calculated T m s of 60, 48 and 42, respectively. It appears that the best probe cleavage occurs close to the calculated T m or slightly above it. Performing the assay at a temperature slightly higher than the T m ( Figure 5 ) showed not only optimum activity but also appears to allow probe cleavage cycling, an important feature of this assay.",

Mismatches were introduced in the probe one at a time, from positions 1 to 8. The Endo IV assay shows excellent specificity for the different mismatches from base 1 to base 6 with large match/mismatch signal ratios. As shown in Figure 7 , the mismatch signal is often about the same as that of the NTC or slightly higher. The exceptions are the difficult 4-G/T-and 8-T/G-mismatches (24) where match/mismatch ratios of $16 and 7 were observed, respectively. These ratios are quite adequate to differentiate matched and mismatched sequences. It appears (data not shown) that the discrimination in positions 1 and 2 is largely determined by substrate requirements while discrimination in other positions is determined by thermodynamic considerations. Experiments with a large number of assays have also indicated that, with 10mer to 12mer probes, satisfactory discrimination is observed with the mismatch position in all except the last three bases at the 5 0 end.",

The cleaved fluorescence from the two allele-specific probes, each labeled with a different fluorescent dye, is then plotted in a scatter diagram as shown in Figures 8 and 9 for the genotyping analysis of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) which are of immediate importance to in cancer (http:// snp500cancer.nci.nih.gov).

In both cases, a probe specific to the wild-type allele is labeled with FL1 and a probe specific for the mutant allele labeled with FL3 is used. The probe sets, designed to analyze ASIP-01 and APC-03 polymorphisms, were used to assay 102 unrelated human DNA samples obtained from the Coriell Institute.

In comparison with other signal accumulating assays (2), the Endo IV assay has similar levels of high signal accumulation, but uses shorter probes with higher specificity than those assays. In the case of hybridization-based assays (5, 25) , the Endo IV assay has not only a signal accumulation advantage, but also uses shorter probes with a specificity advantage.

The parameters influencing the activity of the Endo IV enzyme were optimized. This optimized Endo IV detection assay requires, in addition to an oligonucleotide probe substrate, a fluorophore attached through a relatively rigid linker to the oligonucleotide and a helper oligonucleotide. The rigid linker conveys the exquisite specificity of Endo IV cleavage of the phosphodiester linkage in the probe and shows high-specific/non-specific rate ratios. The synthesis of fluorophore analogs coupled to a rigid linker and solid support, used in the synthesis of labeled oligonucleotides, was also disclosed. Excellent mismatch discrimination is observed from positions 1 to 6 in a 12mer probe. The ability to put the mismatch in any one of positions 1-6, allows for flexibility in probe design for genotyping assays where sequence and secondary structural constraints are considered. This method allows the use of probes shorter than those typically used in other methods (28) contributing to the improved mismatch discrimination.",
