Consequently, it is important to have a set of reagents of known and constant specificity for the isotypic characterization of bovine immunoglobulins. The advantages of consistency, reagent reproducibility and the specificity inherent in the hybridoma approach led us to prepare a number of class and subclass specific monoclonal reagents (Srikumaran et al., 1982) . The reactivity profiles of five of the more useful members of our library of anti-bovine Ig monoclonal antibodies are shown in figures la and lb. The monoclonal antibody DAS-2 is specific for bovine IgG2; DAS 17, for IgG1; DAS 7 for IgA; DAS 6 for IgM and DAS 9, specific for determinants on the light chain, reacts strongly with all bovine immunoglobulins. In practice, we use a combination of DAS 9 and DAS 10, two noncrossreacting anti-bovine light chain antibodies, in sandwich ELISA or specific assays employ an immobilized anti-light chain monoclonal antibody to capture the bovine Ig and the appropriate isotype-specific MAb ( Figure 1 ) to detect the captured Ig. These reagents were useful in the screening and characterization of the bovine Ig-secreting hybridomas described in the next section.",

A necessary concommittant of this theory is that the binding site (idiotope) of an antibody (AB I) which is complementary to an antigen (AG I) will be recognized by an anti-idiotype (AB 2). In some instances, the binding site of AB 2 will bear epitopes that are conformationally quite similar to the epitopes of the original antigen, AG 1. A number of interesting demonstrations of the capacity of AB 2 to mimic some of the biological effects of the antigen, AG 1, have been described and have led to consideration of anti-idiotypes as alternatives to antigen for the induction of immunity. Early work, employing a variety of antigens, demonstrated that the administration of anti-idiotyge can lead to suppression of normally dominant idiotopes (Hart et al., 1972; Strayer et al., 1974) or to induction of the corresponding idiotypes (Trenker and Riblet, 1975) . Also, in some systems it became apparent that whether the outcome of treatment with anti-idiotype was induction or suppression was dependent on dose and antibody class (Eichman, 1974) . (Shulman et al., 1978) as described in Srikumaran et al. (1983b) . The identification of the resulting mouse hybridomas which secreted monoclonal antibodies specific for the immunizing idiotype was accomlished by screening against the following antigens: BSA (control for nonspecific binding); LHRB 8, a monoclonal bovine IgM that does not react with S__~. a~alactiae (identifies those antibodies which are merely isotype specific) and the immunizing antigen, LHRB 19.17. This procedure resulted in the identification of a number of idiotype specific antibodies (Figure 3) .",

Of the 24 idiotype specific clones isolated, 15 (60%) are antigen blocking. This is an important consideration because any anti-idiotype that mimics the nominal antigen of the idiotype will compete with that antigen for the antigen binding site. However, for a variety of reasons, not all antigen blocking anti-idiotypes mimic the immunogenic properties of antigen. Therefore, h~ving established that many of our anti-idiotypes meet the necessary condition of antigen blocking, we await the assessment of their capacity to elicit an anti-S__ L. a~alactiae response t~ determine which are true antigen mimics.",

However, all of these applications have involved mouse MAb. For the passive immunotherapy of veterinary species homologous antibodies in which the effector function-mediating C regions of the Ig are most closely matched to the effector systems of the host would be advantageous. Specifically, in evaluation of mechanisms of humoral immunity such as complement fixation, antibody-mediated opsonisation Ig class-related function, Ig-halflives and tissue distribution there are clear advantages to the use of homogeneous monoclonal antibodies rather than polyclonal antibodies which differ in affinity and epitope specificity. Finally, demonstrations of the effectiveness of anti-idiotypes as alternative vaccines have been made in several model systems (Sacks etal., 1982; McNamara et al., 1984; Sharpe et al., 1984; Uytdehaag and Oosterhaus, 1985) . Homogeneous idigtype is an excellent target for the preparation and characterization of anti-idiotype antibodies and similarly, for the reasons previously mentioned, hybridomas are the preferred source of anti-idiotype antibodies.",

For example, Serge and Peterson (1978) have shown that anti-idiotype antibodies raised against bovine anti-insulin inhibited the binding of 1251 insulin to the receptors of rat epididymal fat cells. Particularly striking was the observation that the interaction of this anti-idiotype with rat thymocytes stimulated their uptake of alphaaminoisobutyric acid thereby mimicking the action of insulin. Clearly, antiidiotypic antibodies sometimes mimic critical structural features of the nominal or external antigen and so can act as immunogens which are alternative to conventional antigens. To develop the reagents for a study of idiotype/anti-idiotype interactions in a system of veterinary interest we explored the feasibility of raising monoclonal anti-idiotype antibodies to an antigen-specific monoclonal bovine immunoglobulin. Toward this end mouse monoclonal anti-idiotype antibodies were prepared as described below against LHRB 19.17 which is specific for S__~. a~alactiae. Balb/c mice (8-16 wk old) were primed by i.p. injection of 100-200 ug of affinity purified, S_L. agalactiae-reactive bovine idiotype precipitated on alum and emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant. Three weeks later the mice received by i.p. injection 118 ug of the affinity purified bovine idiotype emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Five days later spleen cells were harvested and fused to the mouse cell line SP 2/0",
