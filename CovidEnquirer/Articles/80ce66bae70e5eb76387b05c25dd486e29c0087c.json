A subject inhaled saline mist and exhaled through three oxygen masks to illustrate the pattern of dispersal of pulmonary gas. In two commonly used masks, exhaled gas formed a plume emanating from the side vents, while a third mask with a valved manifold, which was modified by adding a respiratory filter, retained the droplets. Maintaining respiratory isolation during the administration of oxygen may reduce the risk of the nosocomial transmission of respiratory infections such as SARS.",

Throughout exhalation, both the nonrebreathing mask and the Venturi-type mask channeled the exhaled gas through the side vents, forming a plume of exhaled gas (marked here by the previously inhaled aerosol) that was directed to the side of the patient. This potentially infectious plume could be directed toward caregivers, visitors, and other patients at face level. The extent of the plume might be greater with oxygen flows or when expiratory flows are increased by coughing, sneezing, or hyperventilation.",

The plumes visible in the figures are composed of the previously inhaled mist that marks the distribution of exhaled gas. We assumed that endogenously produced droplets would be within the distribution of the exhaled gas. The spread of the exhaled gas may be greater than shown, as evaporation and reduction in density of the droplets at the margin of the plume may limit their effectiveness as markers. On the other hand, the visualized cloud does mark the minimum distribution of gas that originated in the lung.",

However, when oxygen supplementation is required for spontaneously breathing patients, guidelines often condone open oxygen delivery systems that do not retain respiratory droplets. 6 In light of reports of SARS patients infecting other patients and health-care workers during the preintubation phase of their treatment, despite the use of protective equipment by health-care workers, we think that additional measures should be considered. 3 The administration of oxygen using the delivery systems described in this article may further reduce the risk of the nosocomial transmission of respiratory infections such as SARS.",
