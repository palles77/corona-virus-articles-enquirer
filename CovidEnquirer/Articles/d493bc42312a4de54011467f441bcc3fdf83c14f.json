Respiratory protection and negative-pressure rooms are needed to prevent transmission of airbornespread diseases, but US hospitals lack available and/or properly functioning negative-pressure rooms. Creating new rooms or retrofitting existing facilities is time-consuming and expensive. Methods: Safe methods of managing patients with airborne-spread diseases and establishing temporary negative-pressure and/or protective environments were determined by a literature review. Relevant data were analyzed and synthesized to generate a response algorithm. Results: Ideal patient management and placement guidelines, including instructions for choosing respiratory protection and creating temporary negative-pressure or other protective environments, were delineated. Findings were summarized in a treatment algorithm. Conclusion: The threat of bioterrorism and emerging infections increases health care's need for negative-pressure and/or protective environments. The algorithm outlines appropriate response steps to decrease transmission risk until an ideal protective environment can be utilized. Using this algorithm will prepare infection control professionals to respond more effectively during a surge of potentially infectious patients following a bioterrorism attack or emerging infectious disease outbreak.

            "text": "Terrorist attacks using biologic agents pose a substantial threat to the safety, health, and security of US citizens. As the 2001 anthrax attacks illustrated, only a small amount of agent is required to have a tremendous impact in terms of morbidity, costs, and mental health effects. 1 These consequences would likely have been exponentially greater if the terrorists had utilized an agent that causes a communicable disease because this could have resulted in the rapid spread of secondary infections. 1 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), terrorists are likely to choose an agent that would result in the greatest terror or mass casualties. 2 In this regard, infectious agents that are spread via airborne droplet nuclei, such as smallpox, have the potential for a massive public health impact. 2 Any infectious disease spread by droplet nuclei, such as smallpox, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), poses a threat to the health of other patients, staff, and visitors in the hospital setting. There is no single way to protect susceptible persons from transmission; it is recommended that a combination of methods be used. 3 For hospitalized patients, airborne precautions are used to decrease health care-associated spread of airborne-spread diseases. 4, 5 This category of isolation precautions consists of protective measures designed to remove as many of the droplet nuclei from the air as possible and eliminate the risk of inhalation by susceptible people. 4, 5 Airborne precautions consist of engineering controls, such as the use of a negativepressure environment, and the use of personal protective equipment in the form of respirators. 5 One major challenge to airborne precautions adherence is the well-documented lack of negativepressure rooms available in hospitals. [6] [7] [8] [9] In addition, research conducted in the early 1990s indicates that many rooms designed to be negative pressure do not consistently function as required. 6, 10 In a more recent (1996) study conducted in 10 St. Louis hospitals, this finding was reaffirmed: only 51% of the negativepressure rooms tested functioned properly. 11 Even the monitoring systems installed to verify continuously that negative pressure was maintained were found to be faulty. When smoke testing was conducted to verify negative-pressure functioning in rooms with a continuous monitoring system, only 50% were found to actually be negative pressure. 12 Nonfunctioning negative-pressure rooms are believed to contribute to health care-associated outbreaks of TB 6 and could therefore be an exposure risk for other infectious agents, such as smallpox and SARS.",

This was illustrated by the recent outbreak of SARS in Toronto, Canada. As the number of SARS cases increased, the need for negative-pressure facilities increased at an almost parallel rate. 13 In response, Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto was forced to expand its number of negative-pressure beds 7-fold, and future expansions are under consideration. 13 It has been estimated that Canada's 3 to 4 month outbreak of SARS cost $1.5 to $2 billion. 14 US hospitals can learn from Toronto's SARS experience and examine the potential consequences of a bioterrorism attack using smallpox or an outbreak of SARS in which many additional negative-pressure rooms or protected environments may be required to help contain disease spread.

A surgical mask should be placed on patients who are to be transported. 5, 20 Room placement Ideally, infected patients are placed in an airborne infectious isolation room (AIIR) that meets specific engineering controls that limit or prevent the spread of infectious particles to people outside the room. 4, 5, 20, 21 AIIRs decrease the health care-associated transmission risk by redirecting contaminated air in the patient's room to the outside environment and/or filtering it before recirculation. This protects susceptible staff, patients, and visitors outside the AIIR against exposure to the infectious aerosols. However, staff and visitors who enter AIIRs must wear N-95 respirators or PAPRs to protect themselves from inhaling aerosolized infectious particles. 5 Requirements for AIIRs include the following: (1) negative air pressure (in which the air flows from the adjacent corridor into the patient's isolation room), (2) a minimum of 6 to12 air changes per hour, (3) room air exhausted directly to the outside or filtered through a high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filter before recirculation, and (4) keeping the door to the room closed except when entering/leaving the room. 4, 10, 20, 22 Whenever possible, an isolation room with an anteroom is preferable because it will further decrease the risk of droplet nuclei escaping from the infected patient's room. 5, 20, 22 It does not matter whether the anteroom is positive or negative pressure in relation to the corridor, but it must be positive pressure in relation to the isolation room to be effective. 20 If a negative-pressure room is available, its functioning should be verified, and the patient should be transported to the room as soon as possible. 6, 12 An isolation gown or linen sheet should be placed on the patient before transfer from the room, making sure to cover as much as the patient as possible. 4, 5, 23 Covering the patient before transport reduces the risk of cross contamination from the patient. In addition, a surgical mask should be placed on the patient before transport. 5 If a traditional AIIR is not available, the use of a Discontinue precautions only after patient is on effective therapy, is clinically improving, and has 3 consecutive negative sputum smears collected on different days or TB is ruled out.

Physical isolation consists of placing potentially infectious individuals in a room as far away from others as possible and keeping the door to the room closed as much as possible. 17 For patients with smallpox, physical isolation was historically accomplished through home isolation or the creation of smallpox wards or facilities. 27 More recently, home quarantine (for contacts of SARS) and development of physically isolated wards (for patients with SARS) were again utilized to help prevent the spread of disease. 14 In addition to physical isolation, engineering controls will decrease the air's bioburden that will in turn help prevent transmission. 25, 26 The first engineering control is to shut down the HVAC system in the patient's room when possible. However, this should only be done if it will not affect the HVAC system to the rest of the hospital. 21, 22 The final engineering control involves the use of portable HEPA-filtration units. Portable HEPA units work in 2 ways: (1) they filter airborne contaminants from room air, and (2) they help increase the number of air changes per hour, which further improves the number of airborne contaminants removed from the room. 17 Although they are not 100% effective at removing infectious particles from the air, portable HEPA-filtration units provide more protection than the regular HVAC system alone, which only reduces particle concentrations by 34%. 28 HEPA filtration units remove $99.97% of 0.3 m size and 100% of larger size particles (such as droplet nuclei) from the air but require time to filter an entire room's air volume. 19, 26, 29 A HEPA-filtration unit can clear 90% of particles in a 760 cubic foot room within 5 minutes compared with $120 minutes needed in a room without a HEPAfiltration unit, but clearance times also depend on the room's airflow rate. 16 Portable filtration units do not eliminate secondary transmission risk to staff, visitors, or other patients either in or outside the room. However, portable HEPA units do decrease the droplet nuclei bioburden in the air, which reduces the risk of secondary transmission. 26 Although not completely protective, this is far superior to using only the facility's standard HVAC system. 17, 26 3 A second fan must be utilized to help draw contaminated air from the room at the same rate at which the fan at the door is drawing air into the room. 17 The fan in the window must be facing the outside of the building to direct air outward, and the window must be open. If the room's windows do not open, this fan system must not be utilized; the wind created by such a set-up may actually lead to an increased risk of transmission. 3 Many manufacturers recommend that portable HEPA-filtration units be placed in the center of the room, but this is not feasible in hospital settings. In addition, a 1995 study by Rutala et al illustrated that this is also not necessary. 16 Rutala et al found that the filtration units were effective regardless of placement in the room. 16 The overall portable filtration unit effectiveness depended on the air's bioburden of infectious particles, the facility's HVAC system, and the individual room's airflow rate and size. 16 Therefore, portable filtration units should be placed as close to the patient as possible, without interfering with staff work flow or medical equipment in the room. 29 In addition, health care providers should not stand between the patient and the portable HEPA unit's air intake because this can increase their exposure risk. 16, 29 Disadvantages to the use of portable filtration units include physical obstruction, air drafts, and noise. 16 In addition, the associated costs of purchasing and running one or more of these units may make them cost prohibitive for many hospitals. Prices range from $1000 to $2200 per unit and another $100 per year for filter replacements, and there is an uncalculated associated cost for electricity to power the machine(s). 29, 30, 31 Although $1000 per machine is a relatively inexpensive investment for disaster preparedness, the actual cost to a hospital would be exponentially higher in a mass casualty incident, such as a large smallpox or SARS outbreak, when hundreds of such machines might be needed.",
