After the Wenchuan earthquake, this plan was updated with lessons learned from massive casualties, including search, rescue, evacuation, and rapid triage. On activating these plans, a scene command center (for first aid) as well as a hospital-government coordination and communication mechanism (for long-term treatment) will be set up by the Hangzhou health bureau. These plans allow the scene commander to dispatch all essential government and public resources including fire engines, ambulances, a blood center, police, and public transportation (Fig. 1) .

According to the in-bus monitor, the terrorist set the bus on fire by dumping a bottle of lacquer thinner on the floor and igniting it with a cigarette lighter. The back half of the bus was completely engulfed in flames and smoke within only 4 s ( Fig. 2b and c) . Dozens of civilians, building safety guards, and private car/taxi/bus drivers at the scene broke the windows to help evacuate the trapped passengers and doused the fire using fire extinguishers and fire hoses (Fig. 2d ). Within 5 min, the fire was extinguished when the fire engine arrived, and the first evacuated victims were transported to the nearest hospitals by private cars and taxis. The Hangzhou public health event and disaster emergency plans were activated. The Hangzhou health bureau set up a scene command center, and 21 ambulances were mobilized to first assess and triage the patients. Within 40 min, all 33 patients were triaged to the five nearest hospitals. However, before the scene command center setup and ambulance arrival, the first 10 evacuated patients were transported by civilian cars to the two nearest hospitals, which did not have a burn ward.

(2) As the care, wound dressing, and surgery of patients with severe burns is both time consuming and labor intensive, doctors and nurses trained in our burn center (including those from other hospitals) were called in for reinforcement in shifts. (3) Multidisciplinary care was provided for critically injured patients. Several specialized teams were intimately involved: life/vital organ support, ICU physicians and nurses; inhalation injury management, respiratory therapists and bronchoscope operators (Fig. 4b) ; venous pathway maintenance, an intravenous (IV) team consisting of a specialized catheter anesthesiologist and nurse (Fig. 4c) ; and infection control, a hospital infection control/surveillance specialist and antibiotic experts. Moreover, a multidisciplinary conference attended by these experts, department directors, and hospital leaders was held at 16:00 every day for team members to discuss and solve problems of the most critically injured patients (Fig. 4d) .",

The guidelines include a set of fundamental concepts for reference provided by medical personnel and government officials involved in disaster planning and management. It describes in detail the facilities, specialized burn teams, equipment, and facility-society communication needed to prepare for massive burn disasters. Some authors have suggested establishing specialized burn wards or even specialized burn hospitals in most developing countries including China, where industrial and civil burn accidents are more common (especially small-and mid-sized ones) to prepare for possible massive burn disasters. However, in developed countries where specialized burn wards are dwindling, simulations and exercises during peacetime could both improve those plans and help the institutions and society prepare for possible massive burn disasters [12] .",

We took 2 days to arrange the transfer of the original burn patients to a central hospital and to sterilize the burn ward for concentrated treatment of the bus attack victims.
