The group embraced a global rather than U.S.-specific frame of reference and elected to avoid a disease-specific description for an approach based on factors of emergence. Factors of emergence are defined as ''. . .specific forces that shape infectious disease emergence [which] operate on different elements in the process of emergence,' ' (p. 47, ibid ) . The original six factors examined were: human demographics and behavior, technology and industry, economic development and land use, international travel and commerce, microbial adaptation and change, and the breakdown of public health measures. The report provided examples of how these factors work and on which emergent infections they apparently operated.",

Additional factors of emergence were examined in this report: human susceptibility to infection, climate and weather, changing ecosystems, poverty and social inequity, war and famine, the lack of political will, and intent to harm. Thus the original six factors grew to 13. While enriching the discussion and description of emergence, this proliferation of factors also created overlapping domains within factors; for example, climate and weather are an integral physical science aspect of ecosystems, the failure of political will is integral to the neglect of public health systems, and so forth. From an analytic point of view, the need for in-depth study of factors and how they actually work has become critical for scientific insight into public health protection.",

Every factor linked to emergence is essentially created or caused by humans. Some factors are more feasible to correct than others. One is the increasing burden on the Earth's limited resources. Another is the new ecosystem of sorts that we have created through burgeoning trade and travel -a world of high mobility and porous boundaries. Also, food production practices intensify as global commerce accelerates. Finally, we have a growing array of medical practices with unknown consequences, such as xenotransplantation and widespread antibiotic use (see Figure 1 ).",

The mechanisms of crossover are largely unknown, but some factors seem to facilitate the process: poor sanitation, encroachment of humans on animal habitats, maintaining food animals in crowded conditions, and extensive use of antimicrobials. The rapid acceleration of poultry agriculture in Southeast Asia has converted avian influenza into a growing number of human cases -371 at current count. An offshoot, cockfighting, includes behaviors that contribute to further infection, such as humans sucking blood and mucus from the beaks of injured birds. Early in the HIV epidemic, a transmission between monkeys or apes and humans was thought to have occurred. Whether this was through exposure between hunters and their primate prey in the rainforests or through bush meat consumption or another route remains a mystery.",

Again, the drivers are largely the product of human activity. Despite this certainty, little definitive work has been done to determine the threshold of each factor in the emergence of new human pathogens.

            "text": "At the microbial level, recent studies of the highly fatal 1918 influenza virus suggest that the neuraminidase portion of the virus was responsible for its contagiousness in humans. Scientists believe that the 1957 pandemic influenza emerged after the virus moved from ducks to pigs or chickens that were infected at the same time by a human virus. After the viruses exchanged bits of genetic material during their reproduction in the pigs and chickens, the new virus was equipped to infect humans. However, because of the state of science in 1957, this information has always been tentative. In fact, it is now believed that the 1918 influenza virus was avian in origin, and did not go through the mixing bowl of a pig or another land-based animal before infecting humans. Intensive study of the virus causing Asian avian influenza is now underway. The virus has already hopped the species barrier in 371 recorded human cases, causing 235 human deaths. At the macro level, we do not know the threshold number at which a safe density of poultry becomes unsafe. How many birds per square meter can be handled safely? How many are too many? What role do ducks migrating from farm to farm play in disease transmission? The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) stipulates that no more than ten chickens can be housed per square meter. Contemporary practice in the United States is for ten chickens to inhabit a 3-square-foot space for their entire lives, often with their beaks and talons removed to prevent injury. Practices using dense poultry habitat are correlated with the susceptibility of birds to highly pathogenic avian influenza. That susceptibility, thought to be related to stress and crowding, has been demonstrated all over the world (Slingenbergh et al., 2004) (Figure 2 ).",

He posits that food will become increasingly scarce for the human community.

Many biological aspects of life appear to be seasonal -births, deaths, numerous chronic diseases, and, of course, infectious diseases all peak during certain times of the year. At least this is the case in temperate climates, where the phenomena have been the most extensively studied.

This well-described but poorly understood phenomenon has enabled us to plan vaccine development and prevention efforts at certain times of the year in anticipation of upcoming outbreaks. When people travel between hemispheres, where the seasons are reversed, they can introduce viruses off-season, potentially throwing off this historically reliable rhythm of vaccines and prevention. Another illustration of the influence of human mobility on the microbial world is the transportation, via food products, of a pathogen from one region, where it may be endemic, to another, where it is not. In processing, shipping, packaging, and preparing food, we bring into our homes and our digestive systems food and microbes from thousands of miles away. We experience some of this microbial traffic as illness, when microbes pathogenic to humans infect us. Microbes that we know because they make us ill are an exceedingly small percentage of the microbes moving around. Our new manmade ecological space of mobile microbes impacts the rapidly evolving microbial world, but what that impact is remains a mystery.",

Changes in land use as a result of deforestation, reforestation, irrigation systems, urbanization, and crowding have been identified as the major players in the emergence of diseases. These land-use changes allow humans to encroach and settle in a new environmental niche with known and novel pathogens. Table 1 illustrates the diversity of infectious agents suspected or linked to known changes in landscape. The majority of these infectious diseases are either vector-borne or zoonotic.

Humans, sometimes unaware, and at other times fully aware, of the consequences are rapidly altering the basic foundations of the environment that sustains us.

Deforestation has increased the burden of malaria in some countries by exposing land to sunlight and creating pools of water that are known to favor the breeding of malaria-transmitting mosquitoes, anopheles gambiae. An increase in the prevalence of malarial infection in the New Guinea Highlands, an area previously malaria-free, has been linked to a rapid increase of anopheline populations after forest clearance and other local developments. Similar trends have been documented in several other countries, including Kenya, Madagascar, Uganda, and Rwanda.

Nipah virus, a newly recognized zoonotic disease found in Malaysia, results from bat-human interactions. Nipah virus demonstrates that infectious diseases do not have boundaries. The infection of people with Nipah virus in Malaysia was traced to disruption of bat habitat in Indonesia that forced bats to migrate to Malaysia. The spread of Nipah virus to humans was aggravated by humans' close vicinity to dense populations of farmed pigs. Other similar examples -the epidemic of Japanese encephalitis in Sri Lanka resulting from pig husbandry; rabies resulting from the spread of raccoons in New York; Lyssaviruses resulting from human-bat interaction in Thailand and Australia -are some examples of emergence and reemergence of diseases caused by human-animal interaction.",

With the explosion of global trading in beef after World War II, coincident with refrigerated transport, and the movement toward global free trade, the United Kingdom negotiated a timetable under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to scale down tariffs on beef, which heightened competition in the United Kingdom's beef industry and increased pressure for more efficient and less costly production methods.",

And for decades, United Kingdom farmers used the meat and bone meal (MBM) from rendering as a protein source for beef cattle. Historically, the rendering process was similar to pressure cooking -applying very high temperatures for very long times so eventually even the bones broke down into powder. It was an expensive, fueland time-consuming process. When a new cold vacuum extraction method of rendering was introduced requiring lower temperatures (i.e., less energy) and less time, it seemed a win-win situation considering the increasing pressure on the United Kingdom's beef industry in the face of global competition. But some time after the new rendering practice was introduced into the United Kingdom, the prion disease known as mad cow disease emerged. The new process, it was discovered, was not effectively disinfecting for prions. Existence of prion disease was unknown prior to its dramatic emergence, first in cows and then in people. The context is important to appreciate. Somehow the streamlining of the rendering process played a role. British scientists tested the new process by deliberately introducing animals with mad cow disease and assaying the resulting MBM product. They found that the newer rendering process does not remove the infection, whereas the older process did.",

We provided 150 newly hatched chicks with oxytetracyclinelaced feed and another 150 without. We followed the effect of the antibiotic-laced feed on the animals and people on the farm. As we began the study, the control group had little or no resistant organisms. In the group receiving low levels (200 ppm) of oxytetracycline, tetracycline resistance began to emerge among the fecal Escherichia coli. What was surprising was that, within 12 weeks, we detected as much as 70% of all E. coli with resistance to more than two antibiotics, including ampicillin, sulphonamides, and streptomycin. The resistances were all on transferable plasmids that emerged following use of just tetracycline. (Levy, 2002: 27) While antibiotics were designed to fight off infections in sick people and animals, they were approved for use as growth promoters for animals in the United States in 1949 and in the United Kingdom in 1953. Meanwhile, in the 1960s, scientists began to understand that the presence of antibiotics in the microenvironment of bacteria caused transferable antibiotic resistance. This means that populations of microbes not only become resistant to the antibiotic over time, but also can pass the new, adaptive characteristic resistance to other microbes -their biological extended family, as it were. Antibiotics fed to animals are not deactivated in the animals' digestion process. In fact, they remain largely biologically active when they are excreted by the animals on fields, into waterways, or elsewhere. Other vertebrates, including humans, begin to be colonized with the resistant organisms, if they share an environment with animals in which the resistant strains are developing. In areas where animals and humans are crowded together with poor access to sanitation, this aspect of antibiotic usage in animals becomes even more dangerous.",

The chickens are not sickened by these microbes; the Campylobacter are part of the normal gut flora. When chickens are raised in very close proximity, with thousands in a single facility, they are more prone to disease, as we have seen with the avian influenza virus. They also are more prone to bacterial disease. Thus, chickens are often treated with antibiotics, including fluoroquinolones, a particular type of antibiotic that is important in treating human infections. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the rate of resistance to this important class of antibiotics in human infections with Campylobacter rose from 13% in 1997 to 19% in 2001. In Minnesota, fluoroquinoloneresistant strains were isolated from 14% of chicken products in retail markets.

A number of other industrialized nations have been more diligent about monitoring and curbing the use of antibiotics in animals. The European Union has prohibited lacing the feed of animals with antibiotics that might also be useful in human disease, with the intent of preserving the effectiveness of such antibiotics as long as possible. The scientific evidence for this move is powerful and comes largely from the United Kingdom, Denmark, and Germany, where scientists have carefully monitored feed practices and resistance patterns over the last decade. Research suggests the bans can lead to a corresponding drop in drug-resistant bacteria. One study showed that rate of resistance to the antibiotic avoparcin declined in Germany and Denmark after that drug was prohibited for use as a growth promoter (Witte, 2000) . Scientists studied the disease patterns by using molecular genetic techniques to fingerprint specific gene groups that characterize both animal and human resistance to particular bacteria. These characteristic patterns were then tracked in different populations of animals and humans to trace the changes in their frequency of occurrence. Research demonstrated that the decline in resistance was correlated in time with the proscription of the use of avoparcin as a growth promoter and that the decline in the characteristic gene cluster took place in numerous animal and human systems coincidentally.",

The argument is that the basic value of ecological fitness is central for populations of microbes. This is simply the ability to pass their genetic material from one generation of their species to the next through replication. If the microbe can easily move from host to host, that is, if it is highly infectious, it invests more energy moving in mobile hosts and less on developing high virulence. On the other hand, some species, such as anthrax, lie in wait for extended periods of time and then immobilize their hosts by making the host moribund or dead, counting on the immobilized host to serve as a point of infection for other hosts. Ewald has coined the term 'cultural vectors' to describe transmission that takes place independent of typical mechanisms such as flagellae, which allow the microbe to swim, or mosquitoes, which transport the microbe to another host (Kimball, 2006) .

While there is no reason to believe that the biology and ecology are fundamentally different with regards to the use of antibiotics as animal growth-promoting agents in Europe, Asia, or Africa, national policy makers historically have made decisions based only on studies related to their own particular situations. Meanwhile, on a daily basis, additional resistance is being stockpiled through the consumption by humans of resistant strains of pathogenic microbes. As noted earlier, these antibiotics do not disappear from the environment when their use is halted. While information from Europe indicates that resistant strains will become sensitive again when the selective pressure of antibiotic use is removed, that information is not nearly as complete or compelling as it should be to justify the persistence of risky practices in animal husbandry. Antibiotic residues and active compounds are not only found in the food we eat. Increasingly they are found in groundwater and in the soil, begging a serious question: Is there a point where we have accumulated enough active antibiotics in the human environment to permanently alter the equilibrium of nature? Is this prospect a real threat to us?",

It might best be apparent in the case of tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is a slow-moving but devastating infection that begins in the lungs. It requires long-term treatment (6 months to a year) with three active antituberculosis drugs. In some countries, such as the Philippines, compounds available in pharmacies to treat cough may contain one active antituberculose agent mixed with vitamins. This will help with symptoms, but not cure the infection. Instead, as we have seen, resistant organisms will be selected and thrive in the patient.

While industry has increasingly come to understand that widespread, inappropriate use of antibiotics will shorten the effectiveness of their products, that inevitability is likely to occur well beyond the life of the drugs' marketing plans, so this consideration may not be as central to decision making as safety would dictate. Misaligned financial incentives also are evident in the Asia Pacific region. Physicians in the region have historically been marketed with financial incentives to prescribe antibiotics. Drug salesmen, known as detailers, call and visit physicians in practice to promote their products. In Asia, some hospital systems actually compensate physicians according to the number of prescriptions they write.
