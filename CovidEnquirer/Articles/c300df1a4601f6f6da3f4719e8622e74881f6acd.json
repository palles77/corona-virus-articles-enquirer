An increase of antibodies against FeLV SU after FeLV challenge exposure was found in all vaccinated cats that were protected against FeLV viremia. The booster-like increase of antibodies against SU can be explained by a minimal viremia which, however, was detected in only two of 17 protected cats. Western blot results supported that a very brief viremia existed in all animals. Antibodies against ~15, pl7 and p27 appeared in all cats after challenge infection, independent of vaccination. Virus replication was immediately controlled by the immune system. This was concluded from the observation that antibodies against SU measured by ELISA reached a maximum only 4 weeks after challenge infection and thereafter steadily decreased. With respect to protection, a very brief period of virus replication may be beneficial against FeLV infection.",

In the mouse, large granular lymphocytes with natural killer cell activity have been reported to express low amounts of CD8 markers (Prince et al., 1993) . Since no further characterization of CD8i0\" cells was conducted, the cells were not identified. It was interesting to note that the appearance of CD8ioW cells was accompanied by the decline of CDghigh lymphocytes.",
