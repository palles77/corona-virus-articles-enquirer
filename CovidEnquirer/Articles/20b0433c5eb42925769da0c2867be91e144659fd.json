Via its seven intrinsic lysine residues and its N-terminus, it can also form ubiquitin chains on substrates in many possible ways. To study ubiquitin signals, many synthetic and semi-synthetic routes have been developed for generation of ubiquitin-derived tools and conjugates. The strength of these methods lies in their ability to introduce chemo-selective ligation handles at sites that currently cannot be enzymatically modified. Here, we review the different synthetic and semi-synthetic methods available for ubiquitin conjugate synthesis and their contribution to how they have helped investigating conformational diversity of diubiquitin signals. Next, we discuss how these methods help understanding the ubiquitin conjugation-deconjugation system by recent advances in ubiquitin ligase probes and diubiquitinbased DUB probes. Lastly, we discuss how these methods help studying post-translational modification of ubiquitin itself.",

            "text": "Ubiquitin (Ub) is a 76-amino acid post-translational modifier fundamental to cellular homeostasis. Cellular processes regulated by ubiquitin modification range from classically known Ub-mediated proteasomal degradation to DNA repair, cell division, endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation (ERAD), mRNA stability and even regulation of the innate immune system [1] . Not surprisingly, deregulation of the ubiquitin system is associated with various serious illnesses such as cancer, immunological disorders and neurodegenerative diseases [2] . The post-translational modifier can be covalently attached to substrate proteins at the e-amino group of lysine residues or at the protein's N-terminal residue [3, 4] . Since ubiquitin harbors seven intrinsic lysine residues, it can also be conjugated to another Ub moiety. In this manner, homotypical ubiquitin chains of a single linkage type consisting of M1, K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48 or K63 can be formed, all of which are known to exist in vivo [5] . In addition, heterotypical chains of multiple ubiquitin linkage types can be formed, opening up an even more complex layer of post-translational modification ( Figure 1a ). Conjugation of Ub to a substrate protein is carried out by a cascade of three enzymatic activities: E1 ubiquitin-activating, E2 ubiquitin-conjugating and E3 ubiquitin-ligating activities (Figure 1b) . To date, 2 human E1s, about 40 E2s and over 600 E3 enzymes are known. The combination of E2 and E3 enzymes dictates what type of ubiquitin chain is formed and which substrate protein becomes ubiquitinated. In addition, the ubiquitination status of a protein can be regulated by removal or editing of ubiquitin chains, which is carried out by a family of approximately 100 deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) [6] . For some of these DUBs, linkage specificity has also been observed. To study the properties of differentially linked ubiquitin chains, traditionally one has relied on generating chains enzymatically by usage of linkage specific E2-E3 pairs. Not all E2-E3 pairs are known however, and some have only been uncovered recently. This resulted in a less extensive knowledge of the 'a-typical' K6-linked, K11-linked, K27-linked, K29linked and K33-linked ubiquitin chains. Therefore, much effort has been put into making differentially linked ubiquitin derivatives through synthetic and semi-synthetic methods, since these methods allow site specific incorporation of a specific chemoselective ligation handle. In addition, ubiquitin-based DUB probes and fluorescent ubiquitin-based enzyme substrates have seen an enormous boost, producing ubiquitin-based tools in all sorts of different flavors [7] . Two other highly investigated areas of synthetic and semi-synthetic ubiquitin-conjugate research focus on ubiquitinated histones [8, 9] and ubiquitinated asynuclein [10, 11] . We will briefly introduce the current synthetic and semi-synthetic methods that can be applied to generate ubiquitin and Ub-based tools and then focus on three other rapidly developing areas. First, we discuss how semi-synthetic diubiquitin synthesis has aided the structural characterization of all differentially linked diubiquitin modules, which further enhanced our understanding of how different linkages can confer specific signals. Next, we focus on recent advances in diubiquitin-based DUB probes and the development of ubiquitin ligase probes that open up new interesting areas of ubiquitin structural biology. Finally, we discuss advances in making synthetic and semisynthetic ubiquitin molecules containing other post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation.",

            "text": "Native chemical ligation (NCL) has been an extremely useful tool to make ubiquitin, ubiquitin-peptide conjugates, ubiquitin dimers and ubiquitin tetramers, as reviewed recently by Pham et al. [11] . Chemical synthesis of ubiquitinated peptides was first established by Muir and co-workers and utilizes a ligation auxiliary where the auxiliary group is removed under photolytic conditions; yielding a natively linked Ub-peptide conjugate [12] . Today, most reported methods rely on the incorporation of a g-thiolysine or d-thiolysine moiety at a designated lysine residue to allow NCL with a thioester moiety. The thiol containing ubiquitin module can be synthesized with total, linear synthesis [13] , or from two fragments [14] . During the total, linear fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl (Fmoc)-based solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) approach, the growing peptide chain is stabilized by the incorporation of special building blocks that prevent the formation of aggregates as the ubiquitin chain grows. In the two segment approach, an N-terminal Ub(1-45)-SR fragment is synthesized and ligated to a synthetic C-terminal Ub[(46-76)-A46C] fragment. In the latter fragment, alanine 46 is replaced by N-methylcysteine to allow NCL with the first fragment and is afterwards converted into the native alanine residue through a desulphurization step. To make ubiquitin dimers and other conjugates, a thioester needs to be introduced at the ubiquitin C-terminus for NCL with the Ub thiolysine-containing module. The thioester functionality can be incorporated by E1-mediated enzymatic conversion with sodium 2-mercaptoethane sulfonate (MESNa) [13] or during Fmoc-based SPPS [15] . Next, NCL can be performed and a subsequent desulphurization step results in a ubiquitin conjugate that bears the native isopeptide linkage. The above described methods are schematically represented in Figure 2a ,b. In addition, other strategies yielding a non-native isopeptide linkage have been reported and include oxime-based ligation for non-hydrolysable ubiquitin-conjugate synthesis [16] and thioether based ligation to prepare diubiquitin [17] , branched triubiquitin [18] and polyubiquitin [19] modules that retain Synthetic and semi-synthetic ubiquitin-based tools van Tilburg, Elhebieshy and Ovaa 93 a sulfur atom in the forged isopeptide bond. It is clear that synthetic protein chemistry has much to offer to the biological community, but one must keep in mind that the chemistry is not always straightforward. In addition, protein folding must always be checked, although this is less of an issue with the very stable ubiquitin protein.",

            "text": "Next to synthetic strategies, protein semi-synthesis has also become a very convenient strategy for the production of large peptides and small proteins since it was first introduced. Using expressed protein as the starting material, a number of strategies have been invented to equip the protein with chemical reactive groups, labels or fluorogenic dyes. For instance, the use of inteins has become a useful tool for the formation of protein thioesters through MESNa-mediated thiolysis (Figure 2c ) [20] . Expansion of the genetic code with unnatural amino acids (UAAs) has further aided the field of protein semi-synthesis [21] . Briefly, an UAA can be incorporated by a modified transfer RNA (tRNA) at the site of a rarely used codon, such as the amber stop codon in E. coli. To this end, the active site of the complementary aminoacyl tRNA synthetase (aaRS) needs to be mutated to allow selective recognition of the UAA, which will then be transferred to the modified tRNA and eventually incorporated into the newly translated protein. While genetic code expansion-based methods are clearly useful, most do require certain expertise that can only be found in specialized labs and often require specific E. coli strains and tRNA pairs. Below, we will discuss genetic code expansion strategies employed on ubiquitin, while a more extensive overview of incorporation of chemoselective unnatural amino acids in general is discussed by Lang et al.

In this case, allylamine was used to equip the Ub C-terminus with an alkene. Expressed ubiquitin lysine to cysteine mutants at the desired lysine conjugation site were converted into ubiquitin dimers by UV irradiation [25 ] . Through this procedure, a C-terminal alkyne moiety was also introduced, which in turn can be used as a reactive group to form non-hydrolysable ubiquitin conjugates with Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC, or 'click chemistry').",

In these efforts, people have been hampered by the lack of specific E2 and E3 enzymes to generate the so-called atypical (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33) chains. The K6 diubiquitin structure was first solved by using the semi-synthetic GOPAL approach [23] . Only recently an enzymatic approach for making K6polyubiquitin chains was reported [31] . K11 diubiquitin structure elucidation was achieved by two groups independently in 2010 [32, 33] after a K11-specific ligase was identified in 2009 [34] . Recently, K29-linked and K33linked diubiquitins have been structurally characterized after a combinatorial ligation-deubiquitination approach was developed to generate such linkages enzymatically [35, 36] . Currently, only K27-linked ubiquitin cannot be prepared fully enzymatically, although interestingly a recent study reports K27 polyubiquitination by the E3 ligase RNF168 [37] . Nevertheless, semi-synthetic and synthetic strategies have been an indispensable tool for studying the structural and biophysical properties of atypical diubiquitins. ",

In 2010, a report was made about deamidation of Gln40 on ubiquitin by the bacterial effector protein CHBP, which effectively impaired ubiquitin chain synthesis [66] . Recently, it was found that ubiquitin can be acetylated on Lys6, Lys48 and Lys63 by mass spectrometric efforts [67] . The effects of acetylation were studied by incorporation of N-acetyllysine on positions 6 and 48 of ubiquitin through genetic code expansion. Interestingly, acetylation at Lys6 and Lys48 on mono ubiquitin prevented ubiquitin chain elongation by several E2 enzymes in vitro. Histone H2B was identified as a substrate for acetylated mono Ub, further suggesting a chain terminating effect of the acetylation event. In addition to the three acetylation sites, Ohtake et al. also detected phosphorylation on Thr14 and Ser65 in conjugated ubiquitin species. Ub has eight potential phosphorylation sites: Thr7, Thr12, Thr14, Ser20, Ser57, Tyr59, Ser65 and Thr66. A general overview of post translational modifications on Ub is presented in Figure 3a .",

With regard to probes, much more can be achieved by extending the scope towards ubiquitin-like proteins, which in general is a much less characterized class of proteins. Many opportunities also still lie in the (semi-)synthesis of these UbL proteins, which would allow incorporation of fluorogenic dyes, warheads, ligation sites or other useful chemical handles. Finally, the seemingly limitless emerging post-translational crosstalk between protein modifiers reveals a whole new layer of interesting protein regulation.

Additionally, techniques are starting to emerge to study an even more intricate layer of the ubiquitin signal: post-translational modification of ubiquitin itself. Deamidation, acetylation and phosphorylation of ubiquitin have been reported and in addition, crosstalk between ubiquitin-like proteins and Ub is known to exist in vivo.

            "text": "This paper describes the structural diversity of all diubiquitin molecules by solution NMR. Structural determination of (di)ubiquitin (chain) conformation helps our understanding of how differently linked ubiquitin molecules can confer specific signals in the cell. Polyubiquitin is conformationally heterogenous, but each chain type exhibits unique conformations for that linkage. A number of diubiquitin molecules adopt conformation similar to previously solved K48-linked or K63-linked diubiquitin, suggesting potential overlap of biological functions between different lysine linkages.",

This paper describes the first complete characterization of K27 diubiquitin in particular. Interestingly the authors find that K27 diubiquitin is processed least by the DUBs they tested and also find that K27 diubiquitin can act as a competitive inhibitor of DUB activity towards other diubiquitin linkages. The paper provides a structural basis for why K27-linked diubiquitin is the most resistant diubiquitin linkage to deubiquitinating enzymes. ",
