            "text": "Since the discovery of SAFV many efforts have been made to clarify its possible pathogenicity in humans. In addition to the positive findings in respiratory specimens and stool samples, SAFV has been detected in the cerebrospinal fluid and the myocardium, indicating an invasive potential [6, 7] . In the first study, SAFV was found in the cerebrospinal fluid of two children \u22644 years of age, one of which died without preexisting symptoms. In this child, SAFV was also detected in a myocardial biopsy. In the second study, 10 myocardial biopsies were tested, and one was positive in a nested PCR assay, but not in real-time PCR. However, no histopathological alteration could be demonstrated in the myocardium of either of the two cases. In our study, we found SAFV in the respiratory secretion, blood and myocardial tissue of a child and histological evidence of inflammation in two related organs (heart and lungs). This combination is novel and may point to a role of SAFV in organ-related diseases. The histological alterations in the myocardium and lung tissue primarily consisted of lymphocytes, which is suggestive of an infection of viral origin. The inflammatory changes in the myocardium were less pronounced than the changes in the lungs. Myocarditis is known to be a condition that causes both focal and diffuse inflammation, and even a small lesion may have a significant clinical impact [10] . The presence of viremia and the detection of SAFV in respiratory secretion and myocardium combined with the absence of other detectable pathogens in the myocardium, made SAFV plausible as a causative agent of the inflammatory changes. The low concentration of SAFV in the myocardium compared to blood and respiratory secretion may have been caused by the use of FFPE myocardial tissue as there is a known decreased sensitivity of virus detection in FFPE tissue. This may also be a likely explanation for the negative result of SAFV analysis on FFPE lung tissue. However, a higher concentration of viral RNA in the myocardium compared to lung tissue is also a possibility. The possibility of detecting RNA targets in postmortem tissue samples depends on several parameters including postmortem interval, fixation time, pH in fixation solution, and RNA extraction method [11] . In this study, we could detect a control RNA target in more than 90% of the study samples suggesting a reasonable RNA detection sensitivity and integrity in our FFPE material. Other studies have established that FFPE tissue material is usable for reverse-transcriptase PCR analysis of virus and messenger RNA, although the analytical sensitivity is reduced when compared to the use of matched frozen tissue material [12] .",

            "text": "Three different types of bacteria were isolated from the lung tissue. Although S. aureus and H. influenzae may cause pneumonia, the histological picture is not in agreement with a bacterial etiology. Rather, the findings represent post-mortal growth of bacteria in the airways, and the presence of non-hemolytic streptococci supports this view. A limitation of our study is that a verification of intracellular RNA e.g., by in situ hybridization (ISH) was not performed. A positive PCR result in the myocardium might represent the presence of blood in the tissue. However, the sensitivity of ISH is markedly lower than RT-PCR and a negative result of ISH in our case cannot rule out the presence of the virus. Future studies preferably using unfixed material should establish the presence of the virus inside the infected myocytes. Another limitation is the age of the study cohort varying from 3 weeks to 77 years, with the mean being 34.7 years. Thirteen cases were below the age of 5 years. In prior studies as well as in this study, SAFV has mainly been detected in different compartments of young children, indicating that infection with SAFV occurs early in life [10, 13, 14] . Determining the exact significance of SAFV for myocarditis would require a study including a large cohort of young children.",

Despite a low prevalence that does not allow us to make a definite conclusion on the association of SAFV with myocarditis, we find the result remarkable because cardioviruses are well-known causes of myocarditis in animals [2] . In conjunction with prior studies it seems evident that SAFV plays a role in invasive human infections and our results suggest that SAFV may also be associated with myocarditis in humans.",
