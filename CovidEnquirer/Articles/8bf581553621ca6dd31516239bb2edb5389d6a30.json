Further, many of those who did remove the PPE in the correct order failed to properly dispose of their contaminated PPE in the isolated patient's room. Deviations from protocol were common. A previous study found that despite HCW review of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention PPE removal protocol before beginning the PPE removal process, and having it in front of them while removing their PPE, errors in removal order were still prevalent. 5 Previous studies have found that viruses on PPE transfer to hands in experiments involving model viruses and fluorescent tracers. 6, 7 We found that many HCWs did not tie the back of their gown, leading to the gown falling over the patient and increasing the risk of contamination. Additionally, many HCWs removed their PPEdboth gowns and glovesdby rolling the equipment against their previously uncontaminated work clothes or bare hands before disposal. These breaches of PPE removal protocol may be due to a lack of awareness of the proper protocol, time constraints, or lack of realization of the importance of proper PPE removal. 3 The poor HCW compliance with the proper PPE removal protocol indicates that further education and collaboration with hospital and HCW leaders to improve compliance are needed. As a result of the current Ebola virus outbreak, the critical issue of proper PPE removal has come front and center. Health care facilities should use this opportunity of heightened interest to undertake practice improvement focused on PPE removal protocol, including technique, for all health care-associated conditions that require the donning and doffing of PPE.",

            "text": "Our study has several limitations. First, many instances of PPE removal occurred behind closed doors in a patient room; thus, we were not able to observe a larger number of PPE removal opportunities. It is a common practice for privacy reasons to shut patient room doors when an HCW is with a patient. Thus this was not something the observer could change without drawing attention, which would undoubtedly have led to change in behavior on the part of the HCW and compromised our study. 8 Second, the study was completed at a single site. Finally, we did not make an assessment of contamination of the HCW following PPE removal. These limitations not withstanding we believe the findings of our study have implications for infection prevention, indicate inadequate adherence to proper PPE removal, and highlight the increased likelihood of the inadvertent transmission of infectious agents by HCWs.",
