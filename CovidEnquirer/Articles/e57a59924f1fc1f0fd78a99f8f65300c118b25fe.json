The older cat (cat 1) had revealed the first obvious episode of pelvic limb weakness at 6.5 months of age. The onset was described a fairly acute with a gradual, but complete recovery of signs over 1 week. The cat relapsed with similar signs 2 weeks later. The recurrent episode was again described as rather sudden in onset, but more severe than the first episode. The cat was gradually improving, but not back to normal at the time of presentation 3 weeks later. The owner of the younger cat (cat 2) reported that obvious signs of pelvic limb weakness were noted over the last 3 weeks. The onset was described as rather insidious and the course was initially slightly progressive. Both cats were grown in different environments and have not shared the same home or owner at any point.

In cat 1, neurological examination revealed a normal mental status and posture. The gait was both ataxic and weak in all four limbs, with the pelvic limbs much more pronounced. Paw positioning was considered as within normal limits. Deficits in hopping, hemiwalking, wheelbarrowing and extensor postural thrust became increasingly evident when testing was repeated. All four limbs were affected with reduced muscle mass, tone and spinal reflexes (withdrawal, extensor carpi radialis, cranial tibial and patella reflexes). In the younger cat, only the pelvic limbs were affected. The gait was ataxic and weak, and hopping, hemiwalking and extensor postural thrust were reduced. Muscle bulk, muscle tone and withdrawal were decreased in the pelvic limbs. Myotactic reflexes were unremarkable. Mental status and posture were normal in this cat. Nociception, panniculus, anal reflex and tail tone were unremarkable in both cats. There was no evidence of spinal pain in cat 1; cat 2 revealed some discomfort on lumbar palpation. Upon cranial nerve examination, mild vestibular/vestibulo-cerebellar disturbances were detected in both cats. Cat 1 had a pendular nystagmus that became intermittently jerky with a fast phase to the left. This cat also showed reduced menace response with normal vision and pupillary light reflexes. In cat 2, occulocephalic reflexes were absent initially, but this could not be confirmed with a repeated neurological examination the same day. The main neurolocalisation in cat 1 was neuromuscular; however, a caudal fossa neurolocalisation was considered additionally. Neurological examination in cat 2 was caudal lumbar intumescence or bilateral sciatic nerve. An additional caudal fossa neurolocalisation appeared rather unlikely in this cat, as occulocephalic reflexes were unremarkable upon repeat examination.",

Cat 2 also revealed some fibres undergoing necrosis and phagocytosis secondary to denervation. Semithin sections of the nerve fibres were within normal limits (Fig 5a,b) , but teasing preparation (cat 1) revealed a mild axonopathy with secondary myelin changes (Fig 5AeF) . Increased myelin sheath crenation, wrinkling and infoldings, that involved paranodes as well as internodes, indicated a mild axonal atrophy confined to large and medium-sized fibres. Further axonal changes comprised varicosities of the internodal segments and crowding of axoplasm at multiple paranodes. Consistent with a reactive Schwann cell hypertrophy, the perinuclear compartments and SchmidteLanterman incisures of more than 35% of teased large myelinated fibres (LMF) showed a remarkable enlargement.",

Since then this cat was supplemented long-term with the Chinese herb Bu Zhong Yi Qi San. Over the following year the cat has reportedly stabilised and no further deterioration was observed. All this information was retrieved by telephone conversation with the owner and referring veterinarian.

A central-peripheral distal axonopathy has been described in female Birman cats, 6 characterised by loss of myelinated and unmyelinated fibres in peripheral nerves in addition to fibre loss in the central nervous system. Onset of clinical signs in these cats is between 8e10 weeks, and the course is slowly progressive. One of our cats showed consistent clinical evidence of vestibuloecerebellar signs and MRI of the brain revealed slightly widened sulci of the cerebellum. Whether this could reflect a more generalised neurological syndrome also including the central nervous system, or was an unrelated finding must, however, remain open. Signs associated with vestibuloecerebellar disturbance did not progress and were not worse during the repeat episodes of neuromuscular weakness. We, therefore, consider the clinical syndrome in both Snowshoe cats as primarily neuromuscular.",

Affected cats usually succumb to acute renal failure. 7 A phenotypic variant of Niemann-pick disease type A has been reported in Siamese cats, demonstrating a primary demyelinating peripheral polyneuropathy with the presence of metachromatic granules. The course of this disease is progressive, and death usually occurs by about 10 months of age. 8 Neither the clinical course, nor clinicopathological findings in our cats were consistent with a metabolic disease.",

The clinical course is progressive. 9e12 Our case report describes an axonal neuropathy in two male, related, young Snowshoe cats. An acquired disease seems very unlikely based on signalment, history, course of the disease and findings of clinicopathological investigations. This probably inherited neuromuscular syndrome described here is very unusual in respect to; (1) its intermittent occurrence of clinically apparent weakness, and (2) initial progressive character with long-term stabilisation and tendency for remission. In cat 1, the intermittent course was more pronounced, however, the overall followup of this cat was longer (over 3 years, compared to the other cat that had a follow-up just under 2 years). We consider the pelvic limb tremor observed in cat 2 after 22 months as mild residual or recurrent clinical sign of pelvic limb weakness. In both cases, the neurological condition clinically stabilised at a level where they had a very good quality of life according to the owners, and repeat electrodiagnostic investigations and muscle biopsy in cat 2 confirmed remission of the disease. One retrospective study investigating muscle and nerve biopsies in 138 cats found that early age of onset appears to be associated with recovery from peripheral neuropathies. 13 However, whether the underlying cause of axonal degeneration in these two cats is a primary peripheral motor neuropathy or a motor neuron disease remains to be clarified.",
