In North America, some would cite the conservative political backlash of reduction in government as one of the effects, but the causes appear to be a genuine downturn in tax revenues collected for governmental expenditure. Reductions in funds available for public projects have also led to more privatization of government services, that are now conducted mostly on low-bid contracts leaving precious little funding for the contractor staff to attend professional society activities without dipping into their own pockets.",

The San Giuliani event measured only Richter 4.8 but destroyed a school, killing 26 children and four teachers. The building's collapse was blamed on the addition of two storeys without strengthening of the shallow foundations and block walls. While investigations initially focussed on whether the extension complied with building regulations, a subsequent government inquiry was asked to address the area's seismic classification. A 1998 government report had stated that the whole region should be considered a seismic risk zone but by the time of the November 2002 earthquake, no official classification had been issued. The chief engineer of the Italian seismic survey noted that none of the buildings in the village were designed for seismic loading. A civil engineer at the Italian Department for Civil Protection is reported as saying that many areas in Italy used similar construction methods to those in San Giuliano Di Puglia, transposing, in effect, equal levels of risk. As geologists, we are getting much better at analyzing seismic risk; but it would appear that persuading governments to act on such analyses remains a problem.",

The Czech Republic estimated flood damage or destruction of 30 motorway and trunk-road bridges plus the same fate for more than 130 secondary-road bridges. In addition, 120 km of trunk road and 780 km of secondary roads were deemed unusable without repairs. In Prague, the river burst its banks and the metro system was flooded. It is expected that one quarter of the flooded buildings in the city will have to be demolished. Throughout the Czech Republic, it is anticipated that as many as 24 months will be needed to repair all the damage. This is a story repeated in many countries and illustrates the importance of long-term climate prediction in all future foundation and flood protection design work. In most cases, careful engineering geomorphological field mapping will disclose areas of major potential flood damage.",

One impressive feature of the construction is the 56.6-m diameter access shaft to the TBM. Dublin is predominantly built on stout glacial lodgment till but has a long history of human occupation, making the 56.6-m diameter starter shaft a geotechnical challenge due to ancient refuse dumping, that also includes various hazardous and medical-biological contaminants. Variable fill and dump-ground conditions in the road link areas led to the extensive use of proof rolling with a high energy impact compactor to help identify areas needing treatment. In places this led to the placement of 2-3 m surcharges on the site to induce settlement prior to road construction. We hasten to point out here that urban engineering geologic site characterization must be mindful of archaeological implications, both of historic value and for the sake of identifying ''bad ground''.",

The task has been to build the 1300-ton concrete caisson foundations for 72 wind generators to be located 9 km off the east coast of Denmark. The caissons were each set in 22-m diameter circular excavations in the seabed, founded on stiff glacial till. Each generator will be standing in seawater depths between 7.5 and 12.75 m, with the three-bladed generator nacelles sitting 69 m above sea level. The wind farm will cover 24 km 2 and is expected to generate 158.4 MW of power. Wind farms further off shore can be expected to be constructed in Western Europe over the next decade given the commitment of the European Union to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the development of renewable sources of energy.

In a lead article in Ground Engineering (April 2002), the in-coming Chairman of the Engineering Group of the Geological Society addressed the issue of the skills shortage, citing earlier economic downturns that had forced senior staff into premature retirement. Other factors were the relatively poor salaries in the arena of practice, as well as other better-paying employment alternatives available to good science and engineering graduates.

That leaves weekends, with their multiple chores that have to be performed. Mine is a fairly simple case, considering the total three hours and twenty minutes I spend commuting-there are people around here (New York City) who do it four to six hours every day.

Preparation of Engineering Geologists for practice underground has perhaps become only more complicated under the far-reaching effects of commoditization of professional services. This overall force has been repeatedly cited in this report as the most damaging of all external influences to the profession. The reader is reminded that the malaise was generated by the U.S. Department of Justice beginning in 1970 with its enforced sanctions against the professional societies, which insisted that consulting engineers and geologists be selected for retention based on qualifications and not price. Sadly, price now rules, to the detriment of the profession and to society at large.",

Tunnel geology is one of the more complex subdisciplines of our naturally complex profession. Insiders tell us that the average age of seasoned Engineering Geologists is hovering very near to that of typical corporate retirement. At the same time, breaking into worthwhile career assignments in tunnel geology remains as it ever was, extremely difficult. The combined effect is that the insular field of tunnel geology remains isolated and non-replenishing in terms of practical experience. Since most of the historic academic instruction has been in departments of geological and mining engineering, and these are withering, the solution is far from at hand.",

This design displaces muck with each rotation of the cutting head, so that each cutter moves on a spiral trajectory causing face-rock failure in shear, a far more economical rock-breaking mode than compression. Wirth equipment has been used on its Tunnel Bore Extender (TBE) at Uetilberg, Switzerland, near Zurich, to expand its bore from an unlined 5 m to a final bore of 14.4 m (World Tunneling, 2003a) . Each push-advance of the TBE is limited to only 20 cm forward, but the advance is completed in only 8 to 10 rotations of the head. The host rock is relatively weak-rock flysch. Cutter heads are mounted on six arms and each cutter furrow is tracked by an appropriate displaced cutter on the next cutter arm, thus shearing the rock to failure along a weakly positioned ridge and furrow pattern. The entire TBE trails 180 m, making it extremely long by way of comparison to most TBMs. Judging from the schematic diagram, tunnel geologists should have adequate observation space for wall mapping during progress.",

DR Boards generally have three members, one appointed by the owner, one by the contractor, and one mutually agreed upon.

We do not comment on the ethics of the process, only warn our readers that the practice can only grow. In 2003, this job-shopping got as close as competitivebid aerial imagery products sold in the First World and completed elsewhere using global remote imagery and e. transmission of results to the home nation.",
