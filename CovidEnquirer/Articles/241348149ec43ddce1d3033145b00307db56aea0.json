Traditional therapeutic methods such as glucocorticoid and cytotoxic drugs are insufficient for treating PF and may cause severe side effects. Recent studies showed that traditional Chinese herbal abstraction such as Tanshinone IIA (TIIA) was displayed significant anti-PF effects in animal models. However, the exact mechanisms underlying the protective effects of TIIA were not fully understood. Here we further investigated the protective effects of TIIA and its mechanisms underlying. PF models of rat were induced by bleomycin (BLM); TIIA was administered subsequently. The PF changes were identified by histopathological analyses. The results showed that BLM resulted in severe PF and alveolar inflammation; together with significant elevation of transforming growth factor-\u03b2 1 (TGF-\u03b21). Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) together with angiotensin-(1-7) [ANG-(1-7)] were both greatly reduced after BLM administration. TIIA treatment notably attenuated BLM induced PF and inflammation, decreased expression of TGF-\u03b21 and reversed ACE-2 and ANG-(1-7) production in rat lungs. Thus we may draw the conclusion that TIIA may exert protective effects on BLM induced PF in rats, and the ACE-2/ANG-(1-7) axis may ascribe to those protective effects.",

IPF is an age-related disease with a poor prognosis, and the median survival of IPF patients from disease diagnosis to death is usually no more than 3 years [2] . The exact etiology of IPF is still unclear and there are limited proven treatment op-Ivyspring International Publisher tions.

After cleaved by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), angiotensin (ANG) I turns into ANG II. The activated ANG II answers for up-regulating transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) which is pivotal in modulating the differentiation of fibroblast to myofibroblasts [6] . Moreover, ANG II is also believed to associate with inflammatory responses and cell apoptosis during the progress of various lung diseases [7, 8] . Recent discovery of a homologue of ACE, named ACE-2, and its enzymatic product ANG-(1-7) could counter the detrimental effects of ACE and offer beneficial effects by limiting ANGII accumulation during kinds of pathophysiological processes [9] [10] [11] . Studies also demonstrated that ACE-2/ANGA (1-7) plays a key negative regulatory factor for severity of lung edema and acute lung failure [12, 13] . Recently, the protective effects of ACE-2/ANG-(1-7) during the progression of PF were increasingly being investigated [14] [15] [16] .",

In brief, after regular deparaffinization and rehydration, the lung specimens were immersed in 1% phosphomolybdic acid for 5 min and then covered with 0.1% (w/v) sirius red F3B (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) in saturated picric acid solution for 1 h at room temperature. The specimens were mounted after being dehydrated and cleared in xylene. The specimens were analyzed by using a light microscope (Olympus BX50, Tokyo, Japan) under normal and polarized light obtained with polarizing filters (Olympus U-ANT, Tokyo, Japan) in order to analyze the initial collagen organization and then the fibrosis. The lung alveolar inflammation and PF were scaled by the HE staining and the Trichrome Masson's staining as described by the previous study of Szapiel [21] .

In addition, significant decrease of ACE-2, ANG-(1-7), and elevation of TGF-\u03b21 were also found in rat lungs after BLM exposure. However, TIIA treatment notably halted BLM induced PF and inflammation, decreased exaggeration of TGF-\u03b21, and reversed reduction of ACE-2 and ANG-(1-7) in rat lungs. Overall, our results suggested a protective role of TIIA on BLM induced PF in rats. The ACE-2/ANG-(1-7) axis may answer for the protective role of TIIA.",

The endothelial and epithelial cells damages due to the lung injury, accumulation of inflammatory cells, and the subsequent increasing production of inflammatory mediators, all together promotes fibroblasts activation and proliferation during the pathogenesis of PF. PF induced exacerbated proliferation of fibroblasts, connective tissue expansion, and alveolar destruction gradually lead to functional loss of lungs.",

With further understanding of this disease, recent aims for treating PF have shifted from reversing the development to slowing or halting the progression of this chronic fibrotic disease [23] . As is well known that TGF-\u03b21 is amplified after lung injury, and plays a key promoter involved in the conversion of fibroblasts to myofibroblasts, transformation of epithelial cells into myofbroblasts (epithelial-mesenchymal transition), protection of myofbroblasts from apoptosis, and accumulation of collagen during the progression of PF [24] . Studies have demonstrated increased TGF-\u03b21 levels in lungs after BLM exposure [25, 26] . A monoclonal antibody has been demonstrated to be effective in blocking murine fibrosis by partial inhibition of TGF-\u03b21 without exacerbating inflammation [27] . Gene therapy methods have revealed more choices for attenuating fibrogenesis by direct or indirect blocking TGF-\u03b21 signaling pathway [28, 29] . In the present study, endotracheal instillation of BLM induced a severe PF together with a dramatic increase of TGF-\u03b21 expression, demonstrated as accumulation of interstitial lung collagen. Collagen deposition was obviously decreased by TIIA treatment. In line with these studies, we also observed increased lung mRNA levels of TGF-\u03b21 after BLM instillation, which was significantly reduced by TIIA treatment.",

Another study also demonstrates ACE-2 plays a negative regulatory role for severity of lung edema and acute lung failure [13] .

Our study showed that BLM induced decreased ACE-2 levels in rat lungs, which is consistent with the previous studies.
