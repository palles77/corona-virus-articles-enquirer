            "text": "The study of calf morbidity under field conditions raises some serious questions fundamental to the practice of both animal husbandry and veterinary medicine. The most serious and controversial of these questions concerns the nature of disease itself. Apart from those animals which are moribund or obviously debilitated, when and how do we judge an animal to be sick? Are there objective criteria by which one can judge this? Some veterinary researchers have attempted to avoid this shady area by evaluating the impact of calf diseases solely on the basis of microbiological laboratory diagnoses (House, 1978) . As Murphy (1976) has pointed out, however, any individual will ultimately be declared to be diseased if a sufficient number of laboratory diagnostic tests are performed. In addition, there is no clearly defined association between laboratory test results and true morbidity. Other researchers, such as Hancock (1983) , have developed their own scales for measuring the looseness of calf stools in order to give what are essentially qualitative judgements a semblance of objectivity. In many ways this begs the central question: do loose stools reflect disease, and, if so, how, or under what conditions? It is one thing to standardize one's observations; it is another matter entirely to say what the standardized observations mean.",

Nevertheless, it can be argued that calf diseases measured in this way reflect the clinical syndromes of interest to dairy farmers, and deserves study if only for that reason. The ability of a farmer to recognize clinical signs, his willingness to treat, and his record-keeping habits all contribute to whether or not calves are recorded as having been treated on a particular farm. Some, but not all, of these difficulties can be overcome by standardizing and monitoring record-keeping practices, and by using large numbers of farms. Also, since these factors are likely to be consistent within farms, farmlevel management effects can be assessed by looking for consonant patterns at the individual animal level on a within-farm basis. For instance, if farms which usually house calves in hutches have, in general, lower rates of treatments for scours, then calves housed in hutches on farms with more than one housing system should be less likely to be treated for scours than their herd-mates. Consistency between farm-level and individual animal-level findings lends strength to a hypothesis of causality (Susser, 1973) .",

In order to determine whether or not some factors in the model might significantly alter the effects of other factors, also in the model, (for instance, assisted colostrum feeding in calves that required birthing assistance, versus feeding assistance in naturally-born calves), models including interaction terms were constructed. Only biologically plausible interactions of those variables which had entered the main effects models were considered for entry. In these analyses, the p-values for F-to-enter and F-to-remove were set at ~< 0.05 and ~< 0.10, respectively, with all terms (main effects and interactions) being offered for entry.

In the full data set, calves from selenium-treated dams had a tendency (P ~< 0.09) to be less likely to be treated for neonatal pneumonia (~< 28 days) than other calves (data not shown). Another study carried out on these farms measured the selenium content of the hair of newborn calves, and related this to subsequent morbidity (Waltner-Toews et al., 1986e) . The latter study found a tendency toward lower rates of neonatal morbidity among calves with higher selenium status. These two studies, then, would tend to support the practice of administering selenium to newborn calves.",

No clear relationship appeared, in this study, between calving ease and vitamin D administration. However, older cows would have been more likely to receive the preventive treatment. These same cows may have produced colostrum with antibodies against a wider array of antigens which, in turn, would have had an effect on calf morbidity (Bradley et al., 1979; Roy, 1980b) . Navel treatment of newborn calves, while still recommended in the popular press (Heider, 1980) , has never been demonstrated to have a significant beneficial effect on calf morbidity or mortality. In this study, a policy of routine navel treatments had no significant effect on morbidity rates. At the individual calf level, navel treatment was either harmful (prolonged treatments if iodine was used; greater odds of being treated for pneumonia if anything other than iodine or chlorhexidine was used), or had no significant effect. Chlorhexidine and iodine had no significant effect in the pneumonia model (Table VIII) . This evidence calls into question any continued recommendation of navel treatments in general terms; of the various substances used to treat navels on these farms, only chlorhexidine appears to have had either no effect (on morbidity) or a sparing effect (on mortality; cf. Waltner-Toews et al., 1986c) and hence can be recommended.",

The differences in odds of being treated for scours for different methods of colostrum feeding, though only significant at P ~< 0.11, were consistent with those seen for pneumonia and crude morbidity. Calves that were assisted to suckle may have been weak calves to begin with, which could explain the higher odds of treatment in that group. The increased odds of treatment for calves given first colostrum by pail is unconditional for crude morbidity, but applies specifically to day-born calves for pneumonia. Perhaps night-born calves were more likely to have been suckled before morning when the farmer would initiate pall feeding. One explanation for the detrimental effect of pail feeding first colostrum is that newborn calves, struggling to learn how to drink from the pail, were not given sufficient time to take in adequate amounts of colostrum. The possibility of milk inhalation might also be increased under such circumstances. Fallon (1979) found no difference in amount of colostrum ingested or serum immunoglobulin levels in calves that were pail-fed colostrum versus those that were nipple-fed under experimental conditions. Thus, it is unlikely that the higher odds of morbidity in pail-fed calves can be attributed to the pail feeding per se.",

            "text": "At the farm level, pail feeding of calves subsequent to the colostral period (as opposed to the use of nipple feeders of some sort) was associated with decreased odds of having above-median summer morbidity and winter pneumonia treatment days. It may be relevant that delayed introduction of pail feeding was associated with increased odds of having calves which harboured salmonellae, enteropathogenic E. coli and/or rota-and coronavirus (Waltner-Toews et al., 1986f) . This, in turn, is hypothesized to relate to improper or inadequate disinfection of nipple feeders. However, under experimental conditions, no significant differences have been demonstrated in the disease rates in pail-and nipple-fed calves (Kesler et al., 1956; Wise and LaMaster, 1968; Morrill and Dayton, 1981) . Although isolation of these organisms from calves on these farms was not significantly associated with morbidity (Waltner-Toews et al., 1986f) , the circumstantial evidence is sufficiently compelling to suggest a rigorous study of the use of nipple feeders in young calves under common dairy farm conditions. Farms where calves were fed waste milk (that is, from treated or mastitic cows) or milk replacer had significantly increased odds of having abovemedian summer morbidity (Table IV) . A recent review of feeding waste milk to calves concluded that, with a few exceptions, no increased risk of disease in calves was associated with this practice (Kesler, 1981) . The health effects of feeding milk replacer have been reported to be related to the quality of the replacer used, and the methods of preparation (Roy, 1980a) . The negative effects seen in this study were significant only during the summer. This suggests that perhaps preparation practices of milk replacer and sanitation related to calf feeding were more problematic during the warm summer months.",
