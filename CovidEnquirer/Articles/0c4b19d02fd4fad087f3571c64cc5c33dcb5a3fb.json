(a) MACV GP1 (residues 79-258) with the addition of a His 6 -tag at the C-terminus, was expressed in insect cells and purified by nickel affinity chromatography. The purified protein, when passed over a size exclusion column (Superdex 200, GE Healthcare Life Sciences), elutes as a sharp peak at 17.3 ml (trace shown here). Inset is a SDS-PAGE gel of the protein under reducing conditions. MACV GP1-His 6 appears as a diffuse band because of extensive glycosylation. (b) The soluble ectodomain of hTfR1 (residues 117-760) was expressed in CHO cells and purified by affinity chromatography as previously described 1 List of MACV GP1 residues that contact TfR1, colored as in Figure 4 . The residues found in analogous positions for the recently isolated NW hemorrhagic fever arenavirus Chapare are shown 2 . SABV was included for reference, as Chapare and SABV are closely related (both are clade B3 viruses).",

The protein, when passed over a size exclusion column (Superdex 200), elutes as a sharp peak at 14 ml, consistent with the molecular weight of the TfR1 dimer (trace shown here).

(a) Side-view ribbon diagram of the rebuilt unliganded hTfR1 apical domain (gray) overlaid with the same region of the originally-published TfR1 structure (yellow, PDB ID 1XC8) 1 . The refined 2F o -F c density (at 1 \u03c3) is shown in gray. (b) Side-view of the rebuilt unliganded hTfR1 (gray) apical domain overlaid with the same region of hTfR1 in the MACV GP1-bound conformation (green). Residues 206-214 are labeled and shown as sticks. Supplementary Figure 3 Sequence alignment of the apical domain of the human and NW clade B arenavirus host-species TfR1 orthologs. Human TfR1 (hTfR1, residues 184-391) were aligned with the corresponding sequences of the TfR1 orthologs of Z. brevicauda (ZbTfR1), N. spinosus (NsTfR1), C. callosus (CcTfR1), C. musculinus (CmTfR1), and A. jamaicensis (AjTfR1). The NW arenavirus that corresponds to the listed host-species receptor is indicated in parentheses. Secondary structure elements are shown for hTfR1. Tree diagrams indicate sites of N-linked glycosylation. The putative N-linked glycosylation site found in Zb, Ns, Cc, and CmTfR1 (human residue 204) is shown as a red tree. Residues are colored according to the ClustalX color scheme. TfR1 residues that interact with MACV GP1 are labeled with asterisks colored according to the scheme in Figures 2 and 4.
