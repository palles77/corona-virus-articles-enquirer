During infection six capped, polyadenylated subgenomic messenger RNAs are synthesized in addition to full-length positive-sense RNA. The subgenomic RNAs form a nested set, all overlapping with the 3'end of genome RNA and all containing the same 5' 66-nucleotide \"leader\" sequence (Lai et a/., 1981 (Lai et a/., , 1984 Leibowitz et al., 1981; Spaan et al., 1982 Spaan et al., , 1983 Weiss and Leibowitz, 1983, see Fig. 1A) . A full-length negativestranded RNA serves as a template for the synthesis of all virus-specific mRNAs (Lai eta/., 1983) . The common 5'leader sequence is transcribed from the 3'end of this template and is subsequently used as a primer for mRNA synthesis or alternatively spliced co-transcriptionally to the body of the mRNAs (Baric et al., 1987a; Lai et al., 1983 Lai et al., , 1984 Spaan et al., 1988) .",

The nested set nature of the RNAs allows the mapping of clones to the unique regions of the RNAs and thus to individual viral genes. DNA from clones mapping to gene G hybridize to all seven viral mRNAs since gene G sequences are present in all seven mRNAs. Conversely, gene A-specific sequences hybridize only to mRNA 1 since this is the only viral mRNA that contains gene A sequences (Fig. 1) . It was important to include uninfected cell RNA on these blots because earlier we obtained clones that appeared to hybridize to MHV-A59 RNA 1 but also hybridized to a band of similar mobility in uninfected cells.

Furthermore, it is likely that translation of genome proceeds from the 5' end as is the case with other eukaryotic mRNAs. The 5' unique region of the avian coronavirus IBV is composed of two large ORFs (Fl and F2) which potentially encode polypeptides of 441 K and 300K . It is thought that a frameshifting mechanism (Jacks and Varmus, 1985; Brierlyetal., 1987) results in the synthesis of one large polypeptide from the two ORFs. Although the 5' regions of MHV-A59 and IBV do not share significant homology (Fig. 4) protein sequence homology between the protein predicted by the IBV ORF2 and the polypeptide predicted from the nucleotide sequence of the 3' portions of MHV-A59 gene A has been observed (Bredenbeek et a/., manuscript in preparation).",

Secondary structure analysis of the 5' ends of the A59 genome RNA showed two stem and loop structures with AG = -35.2 kcal. This structure is similar to that obtained by a similar analysis of the 5'end sequence of the JHM genome. This structure is maintained even as more nucleotides (up to 350) are added to the analysis which suggests that this is maintained as transcription continues further. It is not clear how leader is transcribed, where its transcription is terminated, and where it is released from its template. It seems likely that nucleotide 67 marks the end of the leader transcript as it is the first nonhomologous nucleotide between leader and template in the gene E/F intergenic region (Table  1 ). This is supported by the observation that this is an AU-rich region and is found in a region not involved in a secondary structure loop (Henikoff eta/., 1983; Mills et a/,, 1980; Zaret and Sherman, 1982) . If nucleotide 66 is the end of the leader transcript, then the AAAC (nucleotides 68-71) may be important not for primer hybridization but perhaps for protein interactions needed for initiation of transcription.",

It was of interest therefore to compare the 3' terminal sequence of plus-and minus-strand RNAs. Conservation of a primary nucleic acid sequence or of a secondary structure at the 3'ends of both plus-and minus-strand RNAs would suggest that the same or a similar replication complex recognizes both RNA species. Indeed, sequence homology between the 3' ends of both plusand minus-strand RNAs has been identified in the related coronavirus, IBV. This sequence is about 60 nucleotides in length and is located approximately 50 nucleotides from the 3' ends of both RNA species . However, this homology was not observed in the case of MHV-A59. This is not surprising since in the cases of some other classes of RNA viruses, for example, flaviviruses (Brinton and Dispoto, 1988) and alphaviruses (Levis et a/., 1986) , the regulatory sequences or secondary strtktures are different on plus and minus strands.",
