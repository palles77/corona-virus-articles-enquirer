There is growing evidence suggesting the involvement of the interferon (IFN) pathway in RV-associated morbidity in asthma and COPD. The mechanisms of RV-triggered exacerbations in CF are poorly understood. In a pilot study, we assessed the antiviral response of CF and healthy bronchial epithelial cells (BECs) to RV infection, we measured the levels of IFNs, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) upon infection with major and minor group RVs and poly(IC) stimulation. Major group RV infection of CF BECs resulted in a trend towards a diminished IFN response at the level of IFNs, PRRs and ISGs in comparison to healthy BECs. Contrary to major group RV, the IFN pathway induction upon minor group RV infection was significantly increased at the level of IFNs and PRRs in CF BECs compared to healthy BECs.",

RV serotypes are classified as major or minor group depending on the surface receptor used to infect target cells. More than 90% of RV serotyped strains belong to the major group and use as receptor the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), while the minor group RV strains bind to low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) on target cells [1, 2] . As the causative agents of the common cold and acute respiratory tract infections in children, RVs are one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality [3] . In addition, RVs are the predominant agents associated with pulmonary exacerbations of CF lung disease as they are detected in up to 40% of all virus-associated CF exacerbations [4] [5] [6] . The mechanisms of acute virus-mediated exacerbations in CF are so far poorly understood.",

The work of two groups studying mechanisms of viral control and IFN induction in BECs and macrophages collected from patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) led to controversial results. After growing BECs at air-liquid interface (ALI), Schneider et al. showed an increase in IFN production upon RV infection. Despite that, cells showed an impaired viral control and an increased pro-inflammatory phenotype [17] . On the other hand, Mallia et al. found lower IFNs responses upon infection with RV by BAL macrophages from COPD patients compared to control subjects [18] .",

In line with the decreased IFN responses of CF BECs infected with major group RV, we observed a non-significant trend towards a decreased induction of TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5 in CF BECs in comparison to healthy BECs after infection with major group RV. Interestingly, we found a higher induction of TLR3, RIG-I, and MDA5 in CF vs. healthy BECs upon treatment with the IFN inducer poly(IC). At the level of ISGs, we observed a decreased induction of viperin and MxA in CF BECs in comparison to healthy BECs after infection with major group RV. This observation is in accordance with our finding of impaired IFNs and PRRs expressions upon RV16 infection in CF BECs compared to controls. The baseline and RV infection-induced ISGs expressions were similar in CF and healthy BECs challenged with minor group RV. Consistent with the increased PRRs levels induced by poly(IC) treatment, poly(IC) treatment of CF BECs also led to a higher expression of some of the ISGs tested such as PKR and MxA, suggesting a dysfunction in the signaling pathways involving dsRNA PRRs such as TLR3. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing a hyperresponsiveness of CF cells to PRRs stimulation.",

            "text": "While the infection of CF BECs with major and minor group RV exert opposite IFN responses in comparison to healthy BECs, the elevated inflammatory response triggered by infection was similar for major and minor group RVs. The inflammatory cytokines produced by CF BECs upon poly(IC) stimulation were altered as demonstrated by the elevated levels of the proinflammatory cytokines CXCL8/IL-8 and IL-6. Also, we found an increased constitutive release of CXCL8/IL-8, IL-6 and CXCL10/IP-10 by CF BECs compared to healthy BECs. This observation is in accordance with previous reports attributing an intrinsic inflammatory phenotype to CF airway cells [7, 28] , and is compatible with our ex vivo data showing elevated inflammatory cytokine concentrations in BALs of stable CF patients [10] . In line with the elevated PRRs and ISGs of CF BECs stimulated with poly(IC), poly(IC) stimulation led to a hyper-inflammatory response of CF BECs in comparison to healthy BECs as evidenced by the elevated levels of CXCL8/IL-8 and IL-6. However, since both cytokines are constitutively elevated in CF BECs, it is unclear yet if the increased inflammatory response of CF BECs to poly(IC) is solely due to poly(IC) stimulation or as an additive effect to the already elevated baseline levels of CXCL8/IL-8 and IL-6. Additional experiments are required with other inflammatory stimuli in order to address this question. In contrast to IL-8 and IL-6, CXCL10/ IP-10 levels upon stimulation with poly(IC) were significantly decreased in CF cells in comparison to control cells. This observation is possibly explained by the fact that the regulation of the CXCL10/IP-10 gene transcription is under the control of the IFN pathway [29, 30] .",

All these viruses are inducing distinct pathogenesis in the lung and it is therefore conceivable that the mechanisms of virus-induced CF exacerbation are at least in part virus-specific. In line with this hypothesis, a recent study by Ramirez et al. demonstrated that CF exacerbations triggered by RV or influenza virus led to a distinct antiviral response [37] . Therefore, it would be interesting to test our in vitro system with other clinically relevant respiratory viruses such as influenza and respiratory syncytial virus.",
