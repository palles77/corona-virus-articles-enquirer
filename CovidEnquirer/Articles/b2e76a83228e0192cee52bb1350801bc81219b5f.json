The models are estimated using the volume of monthly international tourist arrivals in Singapore. Empirical findings demonstrate the evidence that the approach we propose generates relatively lower sample mean absolute percentage errors (MAPEs). This study also deals with the volatile data faced by a forecaster. We use the Asian financial crisis and the September 11 event as examples of economic and political shocks. With respect to the objective of shaving the coefficient MAPE, forecasts based on the selected ARFIMA models dominate convincingly. r",

Despite this positive outcome the rate of growth has varied unevenly from year to year. While most countries have enjoyed a steady increase in their tourist arrivals, some have experienced a decline in numbers at times. Planning under these circumstances is exceptionally difficult and important. To be successful, accurate forecasts of tourism demand are required. This can avoid the financial costs of excess capacity or the opportunity costs of unfulfilled demand.",

A large portion of these have yielded empirical information and a considerable majority have reported the accuracy of forecasts. Forecasting methods are generally classified into quantitative and qualitative (Archer, 1980; Uysal & Crompton, 1985) . The quantitative approach, which gives more accurate forecasts than judgement forecasts are further divided into causal methods (e.g., regression and structural models) and time-series methods. The latter identify stochastic components (i.e., autoregressive and moving average components) in each time series and its distinguishing feature is that no attempt is made to relate a variable, say y t to other variables. The movements in y t are 'explained' solely in terms of its own past, or by its position in relation to time (Harvey, 1981) .",

            "text": "The literature on modelling and forecasting tourism is huge. It includes approaches based on regression models, which to a large extent had been examined by Leob (1982) , Uysal and Crompton (1985) , Witt and Martin (1987) , Crouch, Schultz, and Valerio (1992) , Admowicz (1994) , Morris, Wilson, and Bakalis (1995) , Malenberg and Van Soest (1996) , Kulendran and King (1997) , and Song and Witt (2006) . Other authors such as Geurts (1975) , Choy (1984) , Van Doorn (1984) , Martin and Witt (1989) , Chan (1993) , Chan, Hui, and Yuen (1999) , Witt, Witt, and Wilson (1994) , Turner, Kulendran, and Pergat (1995) , Turner, Kulendran, and Fernando (1997) , Garcia-Ferrer and Queralt (1997) , Chu (1998a, b) , Kim (1999) , McAleer (2001, 2002) , Goh and Law (2002) , Gustavsson and Nordstro\u00a8m (2001) , Bra\u00a8nna\u00a8s, Hellstro\u00a8m, and Nordstro\u00a8m (2002) , Chu (2004) , and Gil-Alana (2005) use pure time-series analytical models. In testing the accuracy of different forecasting models for tourist arrivals, researchers had found that time-series models often generate acceptable forecasts at low cost with reasonable benefits. Therefore, a spate of literature had investigated the forecasting ability along this line. Since the purpose of this paper is mainly concerned with the worldwide visitors in Singapore, a brief review of the articles dealing with the prediction of this island state's tourism demand will be conducted. Chan (1993) examined various forecasting models on monthly data between July 1977 and December 1988 and found that the sine wave nonlinear regression model outperformed Na\u0131\u00a8ve I, Na\u0131\u00a8ve II, simple linear regression, and ARIMA (2, 1, 2). The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of the 19-monthsahead forecast is 2.567. Applying a seasonal ARIMA model and using the same dataset and forecasting horizon, Chu (1998a) found that the MAPE reduced to 1.857. Chu (1998b) further improved the MAPE to 1.813 by using a combined approach to the same dataset. This paper tries to improve the accuracy of forecasts by employing a fractionally integrated autoregressive moving average (ARFIMA) model. Sutcliffe (1994) argued that the use of fractional differencing opens up a much wider and realistic behavior for the trend and seasonal components than traditional integer differencing. He showed several advantages of using fractional differencing for forecasting monthly data. Franses and Ooms (1997) extended the standard ARFIMA (0, d, 0) model for quarterly UK inflation, where they allowed the fractional integration parameter d to vary with the season s. For quarterly out-ofsample forecasting, this so-called periodic ARFIMA (0, d, 0) model does not appear to be the overall winner when compared with rival forecasting schemes. Porter-Hudak (1990) characterized a set of monetary aggregate series using a seasonal ARFIMA model. She estimated the seasonal fractional differencing parameter using an extension of a method proposed by Geweke and Porter-Hudak (1983) for the non-seasonal fractional differencing case. She also looked at forecasts generated by the seasonal fractional model and compared the one-step-ahead forecasts with those of a standard seasonal ARIMA model. Ray (1993) used a series of monthly IBM product revenues to illustrate the usefulness of seasonal fractionally differenced ARMA models for business forecasting. She found that the fractionally differenced seasonal model gives a more accurate next-quarter, next-half-year, next-year, and next-two-year forecasts than the non-fractional model based on the criteria that are specifically constructed to reflect the accuracy of long-range periodic forecasts. Applying a seasonal fractional integration to the number of monthly visitors to the US for the time period January 1996 -February 2003 , Gil-Alana (2005 shows that the series can be well described in terms of a seasonal I(d) process, with d higher than 0 but smaller than 1. To examine the forecasting properties in the same article, Gil-Alina used a longer dataset (the short-term arrivals at the Auckland International Airport, April 1978 -December 1999 and found that the seasonal fractional models outperform the nonseasonal ones in practically all cases.",

Monthly data from July 1977 to December 1988 are used to identify a model for the series. Immediately after that, a 19-months-ahead forecast is implemented. This is a time period that covers relatively stable data. The reason why a period of 19 months was selected as the forecasting horizon is to compare our results with that of previous studies. Subsequently, the dataset will be extended to account for economic and political shocks. Shocks normally generate relatively unstable data. Therefore, the model will be tested by relatively stable and unstable data. Using the Gulf War as an example of sudden environment change, Chan et al. (1999) had explored the relative performance of various forecasting models and found Na\u0131\u00a8ve II to be the best in terms of forecasting accuracy. Chan, however, did not consider the ARFIMA model and restricted their prediction interval to 12 months. This paper considers ARFIMA and extends the sample data to cover the Asian financial crisis and the September 11 event. The prediction interval is extended to 19 months as well. The organization of this paper is as follows. The next section briefly discusses Singapore's tourist industry and its time-series data. The third section presents the ARFIMA model. The fourth section analyzes model estimation and reports the application to tourist arrivals forecasting. The final section presents a summary and conclusions.",

            "text": "The performance of the Singapore tourism industry has been remarkable in recent years. The island state's tourism sector, one of its pillar industries, employs some 150,000 people and accounts for about 10% of its economy of $87 billion a year. It also attracts some 8 million visitors-twice its population-each year from all over the world. The data of monthly number of international tourists visiting Singapore between July 1977 and November 2004 are obtained from Singapore Tourist Promotion Board and are plotted in Fig. 1 . The marked seasonal pattern dominates the movement in the series. The plot exhibited a permanent deterministic pattern of a long-term upward trend with short-term fluctuations that were independent from one time period to the next. Note that Singapore's popularity has been growing; the series appears to be nonstationary in that the mean is increasing over time. The tourism industry survived the heavy blows of the first Iraq War, the Asian financial crisis, the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States in 2001, the subsequent Iraq War, and the SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) outbreak in early 2003. These events, however, had influenced the decision of many of the potential travelers, and tourist arrivals therefore had been reduced significantly below the linear trend line in Fig. 1 . Among them, the Asian financial crisis and the September 11 event are two different demand shocks in nature. The former is economic while the latter is political. The impacts of both disturbances on arrivals are demonstrated by a fenced rectangular in Fig. 1 . For the forecasting experiment, the sample was split into the last 19 observations, henceforth called the 'prediction interval', and the remaining data, henceforth called the 'preprediction interval'. Parameter estimates were obtained from fitting the models to the pre-prediction interval. Three different types of pre-prediction and prediction interval are considered. One of them has stable tourist arrivals within the entire sample, henceforth called the 'tranquil period'. The other two, characterized by economic and political shocks, are further classified into cases, depending upon whether shock has taken place at the time the policy maker or the planning manager implemented the forecasts. Suppose the policy maker had already implemented the forecasts based on his best forecasting model but found later that shock had occurred. In this situation, the policy maker may be reluctant to change the forecasts because cost may surpass benefit. Even if he does change the forecasts based on alternative models at hand, there is no guarantee that the results will be better than those obtained from the previous models. Alternatively, if the shock had already taken place at the time the forecast is made, but the industry still shows no sign of partial or full recovery, the policy maker in this situation has the option to try alternative forecasting models if he deems appropriate.",

In all cases, fractionally integrated ARMA (p, d, q) models beat the rival nonseasonal ARIMA (p, d, q) and seasonal ARIMA (p, d, q). We mentioned earlier that the reason why a period of 19 months was selected as the forecasting horizon is to compare our results with that of past authors.

In fact, it improves the accuracy of forecast by several percentage points depending upon which rival models we are comparing it with. For instance, the improvement over the combined forecasting approach and seasonal ARMA (3, 1, 0)(0, 1, 0) 12 model are 4.15% and 6.41%, respectively. Improvement over the rest of the models is even more magnificent. The model we proposed also performed quite well in environments disturbed by economic and political shocks. Although we differentiate two cases that the forecaster or the policy maker may face in the vicinity of the shock, the proposed models seem to render the best performance to the policy maker among the methods we consider in most cases. This study is motivated by the potential of gains in predictive accuracy by using a fractionally integrated ARMA (p, d, q) model, in which the estimates of differencing parameter d are treated as fractional. Apart from treating d as a noninteger, appropriate integer differences are also implemented simultaneously in an effort to impart the data stationary. This may explain why the fractionally integrated ARMA (p, d, q) model performed relatively better than that of its rival traditional and seasonal ARIMA (p, d, q).",

Apart from the SARS period, the fractionally integrated ARMA (p, d, q) model outperforms the rival forecasting models most of the time.",

When model-based out-of-sample forecasts are entertained, more accurate results are generated. Hence, the results presented in this paper lead us to suggest that they can be used by recreation managers and decision makers in regional and national tourism offices in implementation of policies in an attempt to enhance tourism demand and growth.",
