In a young puppy or kitten, the right hand can be easily replaced by a moistened cotton-tipped applicator to accommodate the animal's smaller oral cavity. The healthy oral cavity is generally pink with a scattering of pigment, appears smooth and glistening, and has limited accumulation of secretions. The surface tissue is pliable and easily blanched with light touch. Gentle opening and palpation of the oral cavity should not be painful or cause prompt withdrawal of the head. Consequently, a painful reaction or inability to fully open the mouth should be obvious. The breath of a growing, healthy dog or cat is not unpleasant; the breath of nursing puppies or kittens generally has a characteristic milky smell. Alterations in the odor of the breath usually indicate a disease state, food the animal has eaten, or medication it has received. Offensive, foul-smelling breath may be caused by oral lesions, necrotic respiratory disease, or alimentary tract disease associated with belching. Periodontal disease is not as likely in the young dog or cat to cause bad breath. Teeth should always be inspected and the number of teeth and their arrangement within the dental arcade evaluated at each examination. The occlusal pattern of the jaws and teeth should also be examined regardless of the animal's age.",

In the immune-mediated diseases (i.e., pemphigus diseases, bullous pemphigoid, and lupus erythematosus), it is unusual in either the dog or cat for oral lesions to occur without skin involvement, especially at other mucocutaneous junctions, such as eyelids, nostrils, anus, vagina, and prepuce (Scott et ai, 1987a, b) . In pemphigus vulgaris, the presence of autoantibodies to intercellular epidermal antigens causes acantholysis and intraepidermal vesicobullous ulceration of the skin and oral cavity. Pemphigus foliaceus, the most common of the pemphigus diseases, rarely affects the oral cavity. In bullous pemphigoid, the presence of autoantibodies against antigens at the basement membrane zone causes subepidermal vesicobullous ulceration of the skin and oral cavity. In systemic lupus erythematosus, oral ulceration may occur in conjunction with its other multisystemic manifestations. Any of these immune-mediated diseases may first ap-pear in the dog or cat at 4 to 6 months of age and typically follow the same lesion(s) development and patterns as seen in the adult.

Black tongue, caused by niacin deficiency in dogs, is no longer seen as a clinical entity (Dillon, 1980) . Although rarely seen, deficiencies in many of the B-complex vitamins and possibly in zinc may contribute to the appearance of oral lesions in growing, malnourished dogs or cats (Lewis et al, 1987; Lyon, 1988) . Thallium is generally the heavy-metal cause of oral lesions. Petechiation of the oral mucosa or gingival bleeding may occur with coagulation abnormalities, that is, rodenticide poisoning, thrombocytopenia, clotting factor deficiencies, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Silver-gray collies affected with cyclic hematopoiesis often develop a recurrent stomatitis that coincides with absolute neutropenia (Cheville, 1968) . Proliferative eosinophilic granulomas have been seen in the oral cavity of Siberian huskies and in many breeds of young cats (i.e., in kittens as young as 8 weeks of age) (Madewell et al, 1980; Potter et aI, 1980) . General Therapy. The definitive cause of a stomatitis cannot always be determined by history, physical examination, cytologic examination, bacterial and fungal culture, or tissue biopsy. In many cases, bacterial cultures reveal the normal mixed flora of the oral cavity (Table  10 -2); therefore, antimicrobial sensitivities are The Digestive System I 149 Bacteria Commonly Isolated From the Oral Cavity often unreliable. In these cases, therapy to treat the symptoms is often efficacious. A gauze sponge can be used for mechanical cleaning of the mucosal surface. Daily flushing of the mouth with chlorhexidine (diluted to 0.1 % to 0.2% solution in tepid water) followed by rinsing the mouth with copious amounts of fresh water will help cleanse the affected areas. Soft, palatable food may need to be provided for several days during the initial healing phase. Ampicillin, amoxicillin, or cephalosporins may be administered daily in an oral liquid form for both a local antimicrobial effect and subsequent systemic effect after absorption. Antimicrobial therapy may be indicated for up to 3 weeks.",

Sialocele formation most commonly involves the sublingual and mandibular salivary glands, where blockage of a duct or rupture of the gland causes extravasation of saliva into the surrounding connective tissue. The saliva may gravitate to the sublingual area (often referred to as a ranula), intermandibular space, mediastinum, or pharyngeal area ( Fig. 10-7) . Swelling may develop suddenly but is more likely to be in the form of a slowly developing, fluctuant sac. Diagnosis of sialocele is based on physical appearance of the cervical swelling and on cytologic evaluation. Needle aspiration of the swelling yields a viscous, mucoid fluid that is usually clear or brown. Hemorrhage and exudate, which will cytologically show clumps of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and red blood cells ders, 1983, p 1184.) with saliva, may develop after excessive manipulation of the sialocele or with infection ( Fig.  10-8) . The injection of water-soluble contrast medium through the ducts may help to identify the affected gland, but in the young dog or cat the openings of the ducts are extremely small and usually impossible to find. Therefore, a thorough physical examination and cytologic examination of aspirated fluid are more reliable. Total excision of the affected gland, which is usually the sublingual or mandibular gland, and drainage of the sialocele provide the only longterm therapy for sialoceles. Removal of an elliptic portion of the wall of a ranula allows direct drainage of salivainto the oral cavity. The surgical techniques for the management of salivary The Digestive System I 155 gland disorders are described elsewhere (Harvey, 1989) .",

The pharyngeal stage occurs when the food bolus is propelled from the base of the tongue to the cricopharyngeal passage. The cricopharyngeal stage involves relaxation of the cricopharyngeal sphincter, passage of the food bolus into the esophagus, closure of the cricopharyngeal sphincter, and relaxation of the pharyngeal muscles (Suter and Watrous, 1980) . Difficulty in swallowing during anyone of these stages is defined as dysphagia (Shelton, 1982) . Dysphagia is uncommon in dogs and rare in cats. Dysphagia is usually recognized in puppies and kittens shortly after weaning.",

            "text": "Pharyngeal Dysphagias. Pharyngeal dysphagias are less consistent, and related signs are more difficult to localize. The most common signs are coughing with repeated unsuccessful attempts at swallowing and laryngotracheal aspiration of swallowed material. Often, the puppy or kitten will regurgitate masticated food several hours after ingestion, or food or liquid material will be misdirected into the nasopharynx, leading to nasal discharge (Shelton, 1982) . Cineradiographic features are generally more diagnostic than the presenting signs. These features include residual air and contrast medium in the pharynx with normal cricopharyngeal sphincter function; slow initiation and progress of pharyngeal peristaltic contractions; retention of contrast medium in the oropharynx, pharynx, and piriform recesses; and passage of contrast medium into the larynx (Suter and Watrous, 1980) . Cricopharyngeal Dysphagias. Cricopharyngeal dysphagias typically manifest as problems of asynchrony (i.e., incoordination of pharyngeal contraction and cricopharyngeal sphincter relaxation) or as achalasia (i.e., failure of cricopharyngeal sphincter relaxation) (Shelton, 1982) . In asynchrony, the cricopharyngeal muscle may contract too early or too late in relation to contraction of the pharyngeal muscles. Cricopharyngeal achalasia results from the failure of the cricopharyngeus muscle and part of the thyropharyngeus muscle to relax and thus permit a food bolus to move from the pharynx into the cranial esophagus (Rosin and Hanlon, 1972; Sokolovsky, 1967) . Signs of cricopharyngeal dysphagias can vary, depending on whether there is an achalasia or asynchrony. Because presenting signs of cricopharyngeal dysphagias are similar to those seen with pharyngeal dysphagias,. cricopharyngeal and pharyngeal dysphagias can be differentiated only by means of cineradiographic studies. If there is incomplete relaxation of the cricopharyngeal sphincter, cricopharyngeal dysphagias usually show a dorsal indentation of the food bolus as it passes through the sphincter. If there is incoordination of sphincter and pharynx, the food bolus will be misdirected into the nasopharynx ( Fig. 10-10 ) (Shelton, 1982; Suter and Watrous, 1980) .",

Oral and pharyngeal dysphagias are generally, however, made worse by the myotomy procedures (Suter and Watrous, 1980) . Oral and pharyngeal dysphagias are best managed by treating any underlying medical illness, changing the consistency of the animal's usual diet, and feeding the animal in an elevated position (Hoffer, 1986) . Other valuable techniques for short-term therapy are feeding by means of a nasogastric, esophagostomy, or gastrostomy tube. If conservative therapy is not helpful and the owner does not wish to continue feeding by one of the enteral methods, cricopharyngeal myotomy may be considered. In this situation, the owner should be aware that cricopharyngeal myotomy may make the animal's condition worse. ",

These anomalies produce an extramural obstruction of the esophagus at the base of the heart and rarely affect the trachea or cardiovascular system. The most frequently encountered vascular ring anomaly in the young dog or cat is persistent right aortic arch (Watrous, 1983) . Other vascular ring anomalies that occur infrequently are a double aortic arch due to persistence of both right and left fourth arches, anomalous origin of the subclavian or intercostal arteries, and an aberrant patent ductus arteriosus associated with the left or right aortic arches. The incidence of vascular ring anomalies is higher in young dogs than in young cats. Irish setters, Boston terriers, and German shepherds are the most commonly affected dog breeds (Leipold, 1977; Patterson, 1968) . Cats of all breeds are equally susceptible to persistent right aortic arch and the other vascular ring anomalies (Harpster, 1987) . Diagnosis. Signs caused by the vascular ring anomalies result from esophageal entrapment and obstruction, with subsequent precordial megaesophagus. When weaning to solid food, puppies and kittens will repeatedly regurgitate. Although regurgitation is usually associated with eating when solid food is first fed, it will occur at variable times after eating as the precordial megaesophagus worsens. Occasionally, signs in the puppy or kitten are associated with ingestion of maternal milk. The food-distended megaesophagus may be palpated at the thoracic inlet. Affected animals are obviously malnourished and underweight. Auscultation of the thorax may reveal coarse lung sounds due to laryngotracheal aspiration of ingested food and water, although heart sounds are usually normal. The diagnosis of a vascular ring anomalyinduced megaesophagus can usually be confirmed by a positive contrast esophagogram ( Fig. 10-11 ).",

Most animals show substantial improvement if they survive the immediate postoperative period. Persistent megaesophagus occurs if the esophagus develops sacculations, an extensive dilation that fills the anterior region of the mediastinum, or dilatation of the esophagus caudal to the vascular ring anomaly.

Gastric acid reflux is uncommon as a primary event, but can occur any time the lower esophageal sphincter pressure is compromised, such as during anesthesia or severe blunt trauma directly to the thorax or abdomen. Esophagitis can be limited to mucosal damage or may extend into the submucosa and musculature. If only the mucosa is involved, the esophagitis is usually mild and self-limiting. Esophagitis with submucosal and musculature involvement, however, often leads to severe ulceration with subsequent perforation, fibrotic stricture formation, persistence of inflammation, and/or disturbed motor activity (acquired megaesophagus). The possibility of gastric acid reflux-induced esophagitis should be minimized during surgical procedures by fasting surgical patients for 6 to 12 hours before surgery and avoiding surgical positions that promote gastric acid reflux (e.g., positioning the head lower than the body).",

Signs are attributed to the partial or complete obstruction of the esophagus and/or the size and shape of the lodged foreign object and length of time since its becoming lodged. Early signs may include regurgitation of all ingested solids and possibly liquids, painful dysphagia, hypersalivation, repeated gulping, and anorexia. Later the signs may include profound depression, anorexia, weight loss, and other signs that relate to associated complications. These complications may include perforated esophagus, pleuritis, mediastinitis, pyothorax, mucosal lacerations, esophageal stricture, diverticula, and severe esophagitis (Houlton et ai, 1985) . Confirmation of the presence of a lodged foreign object requires a physical examination (which includes a thorough oral examination), cervical and thoracic radiographs, and esophagoscopy ( Fig. 10-14) . Treatment. A foreign object lodged in the esophagus must be considered an emergency situation because the frequency of complications increases with the duration of the problem. In most cases of a suspected foreign object lodged in the esophagus, the use of esophagoscopy is advisable. Flexible endoscopes allow easy passage into an anesthetized young dog's or cat's esophagus to visualize a foreign object and to inspect for extent of esophageal damage. If the foreign object is small, it can often be removed by passing a flexible four-prong grasping forceps through the endoscope, grasping the foreign object, and pulling it retrogradely through the mouth. If the foreign object is too large for the flexible grasping forceps, rigid grasping forceps may be passed in conjunction with a flexible endoscope (Figs. 10-15 and 10-16). Once the object is grasped, it and the endoscope can then be pulled retrogradely through the mouth. Frequently, the object becomes dislodged from the grasper as it is passing through the cricopharyngeal sphincter region. The object can then be easily retrieved by grasping it with long alligator forceps through the sphincter and thus removing it. If the object cannot be removed in a retrograde manner, one may attempt to push it directly into the stomach. Careful manipulation is necessary when pushing the object into the stomach because the caudal portion of the esophagus deviates slightly at the gastroesophageal junction.",

The disorders more commonly associated with its altered function are hiatal hernia with reflux esophagitis (Alexander et aI, 1975; Gaskell et al, 1974; Robotham, 1977) and gastroesophageal intussusception (Leib and Blass, 1984;  Morris and Turnwald, 1980; Singer, 1975) . Hiatal hernia is the result of a congenital or acquired defect of the phrenoesophagealligament that allows displacement of the gastroesophageal junction forward into the thoracic cavity ( Fig. 10-22 ). Hiatal hernia may also be associated with an upper respiratory obstruction, especially common in young Chinese shar-peis. Gastric contents reflux WB Saunders, 1986, p 402.) through the incompetent junction into the caudal region of the esophagus, where they produce varying degrees of irritation to the esophageal mucosa. Signs may include regurgitation with possible hematemesis, dysphagia, altered breathing pattern, and weight loss. Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion followed by a barium contrast study performed under fluoroscopic observation. The hiatal hernia may be a sliding type hernia (Gaskell et ai, 1974) , which moves in and out of its normal position, or a fixed hernia (Alexander et ai, 1975) , which remains out of position. The amount of stomach that protrudes through the esophageal hiatus determines the radiographic appearance of the hernia. Usually, external abdominal pressure is necessary to demonstrate a sliding hiatal hernia (Hoffer, 1986) . The hiatal hernia may be repaired surgically. If excessive gastric reflux occurs, the gastroesophageal junction may be surgically strengthened by a gastric fundoplication (Nissen's operation) procedure (Hoffer, 1986) .",

The veterinarian can identify gastric disorders by observation of vomiting, which differs from regurgitation associated with esophageal disorders or from coughing and expulsion of phlegm associated with respiratory or cardiovascular disorders.

If the vomitus consists of food, the degree of digestion indicates the length of time food has remained in the stomach. Vomitus can contain varying amounts of mucus and fluid from gastric and swallowed salivary secretions. Yellow-or greenstained vomitus indicates intestinal reflux of bile into the stomach. Vomitus containing feces usually indicates intestinal stasis or possibly intestinal obstruction. Fresh blood from gastric bleeding may be present as small red flecks or as large blood clots. Blood that has been retained in the stomach soon becomes partially digested and has a brown \"coffee grounds\" appearance. The presence of blood in vomitus usually signifies a more serious gastric disorder. Other signs associated with gastric disorders may include nausea, belching, inappetence, polydipsia, and pica. Melena, or black tarry stools, is seen with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and may imply gastric mucosal damage (Wingfield and Twedt, 1986) . Causes. Gastritis can be associated with a multitude of factors but more commonly results from dietary indiscretions, infectious diseases, and possibly endoparasites. It is often associated with ingestion of rancid or contaminated foodstuffs that leads to food intoxication. The contaminated foodstuffs generally contain products of fermentation or putrefaction, various bacterial enterotoxins, and possibly mycotoxins (Harris, 1975) . Ingestion of foreign material such as bones, pins, needles, plastic objects, food wrappings, rocks, and small toys mechanically irritates the gastric mucosa and thereby causes gastritis. The incidence of ingested foreign material is much higher in young dogs and cats, possibly owing to their developmental chewing habits and curious natures. Trichobezoars (hairballs) are frequently seen in the vomitus of longhaired cats and some dogs. Many drugs (e.g., antimicrobial agents, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs, anthelmintics, and corticosteroids) and chemicals (e.g., heavy metals, cleaning agents, fertilizers, and herbicides) may also contribute to gastritis in the young animal (Atkins and Johnson, 1975; Harris, 1975) .",

The ingestion of grass and plants by seemingly healthy animals is not uncommon, possibly owing to their natural, instinctual behaviors. Many young dogs and cats with gastric disorders, for some unknown reason, frequently ingest and then vomit grass or plant material. The incidence of bacterial-induced gastritis is extremely low because the acidic gastric lumen does not favor the growth and colonization of bacteria (Strombeck and Guilford, 1990) . A gastric chlamydial infection has been identified in young cats (Gaillard et al, 1984) . Viruses such as canine distemper virus, canine herpesvirus, canine adenovirus-I, coronaviruses, and parvoviruses may cause gastric lesions and vomiting as a part of a more extensive disease condition. Mycotic infections of the stomach are extremely rare and generally not an important cause of gastritis in dogs and cats younger than 6 months (Ader, 1979; Foil et al, 1984) . Endoparasites seldom produce gastric lesions or signs. Physaloptera species, Ollulanus tricuspis (cats), ascarids, and, occasionally, tapeworms are endoparasites that may be associated with gastric irritation and vomiting. Other conditions, including renal failure, liver disease, neurologic disease, shock, sepsis, and possibly altered behavior, may also play a role in the cause of gastritis in the young dog and cat.",

Symptomatic treatment of most cases of gastritis and vomiting is begun without extensive diagnostic procedures. Most animals show improvement within 12 to 24 hours after little or no therapy and usually are treated on an outpatient basis. Those animals with persistent vomiting, evidence of dehydration, abdominal pain, organomegaly or palpable abdominal mass, or failure to respond to previous symptomatic treatment require further medical and laboratory evaluation. The general principles of the treatment of gastric disorders include removing the inciting cause; providing proper conditions to promote mucosal repair; correcting fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base abnormalities; and alleviating secondary complications of gastritis, such as abdominal pain and diarrhea (Wingfield and Twedt, 1986) . Dietary restriction is the initial management for gastritis. An animal with gastritis should be withheld food for 24 to 48 hours and water for 12 to 24 hours. If no vomiting occurs during this period of management, over the next 2 to 5 days the animal is gradually returned to full feed and water. Water is offered initially in small, frequent amounts or provided in ice cubes, enough to keep the mouth moist and to supply a modest fluid replacement. Until vomiting is well controlled, small amounts (three to six times daily) of a highly digestible, low-fiber diet are fed frequently, including cooked rice or cooked cereals supplemented in a 50:50 ratio with low-fat cottage cheese, boiled chicken, lean boiled ground beef, or commercial baby foods. Commercial diets formulated for gastrointestinal disease may also be prescribed. One can expect most cases of vomiting in young dogs and cats to respond to just dietary and water intake management.",

In dogs younger than 6 months and in cats, however, the animal's pyloric canal may not be large enough to accommodate the standard endoscope.

Gastric stimulation with metoclopramide is helpful in animals with functional, but not anatomical, gastric retention (see Table 10 -4). Metoclopramide increases gastric antral contractions, promotes relaxation of the pylorus, and increases smooth muscle contraction in the proximal small intestine. This enhances coordination of the antral and duodenal contractions, with subsequent acceleration of gastric emptying and small intestinal transit. Metoclopramide is contraindicated whenever increased gastrointestinal motility might be harmful. It should not be administered to animals with central nervous system disease, given in conjunction with phenothiazines or narcotic analgesics, or administered to animals younger than 2 months of age.",

A transient hyperkalemia results from gastric decompression (Wingfield et aI, 1975) ; however, a deficit in total body potassium levels is usually present owing to gastrointestinal loss and reduced intake of potassium. Corticosteroids are routinely used in the management of shock (Rawlings et al, 1976 ). Fluid replacement therapy should always precede corticosteroid therapy.

Bacteria (e.g., Salmonella species, Escherichia coli, Campylobacter species, Yersinia enterocolitica, Bacillus piliformis, and Clostridium perfringens) reside in, and may contribute to severe mucosal damage in, the small and/or large intestine. Viruses (e.g., canine distemper virus, parvovirus-2, coronavirus, and rotavirus) are important causes of enterocolitis in young dogs. Other viruses that have been identified in unformed stools of dogs are a minute parvovirus (canine parvovirus-1), adenovirus, caliciviruses (Evermann et al, 1985) , paramyxovirus-like virus, astrovirus, picornavirus, and human echovirus and coxsackievirus (Greene, 1990 (Greene, 1990) . In refractory diarrheal problems, feline leukemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, and feline infectious peritonitis virus should be considered in the diagnosis. The primary fungi infecting the intestinal tract are Histoplasma capsulatum, Aspergillus species, and Pythium species; however, they are uncommon in dogs and cats younger than 6 months.",

Restriction of food and possibly water allows for restoration of mucosal integrity and a more rapid return of gastrointestinal function.

If no diarrhea has occurred during the 24-to 48-hour fast, small amounts of a highly digestible, low-fiber, moderately low-fat diet are fed three to six times daily, such as cooked rice or cooked cereals supplemented in a 4:1 ratio with low-fat cottage cheese, lean boiled ground beef or chicken, or commercial baby foods. Commercial diets formulated for gastrointestinal disease may also be prescribed.

Of the salicylates, bismuth subsalicylate appears to be more effective as an oral antidiarrheal compound. The dose is about 0.25 mllkg body weight divided into four to six equal daily doses.

The rationale behind their use is based on their direct action on the smooth muscle of the small intestine and colon, causing increasing tone and segmentation (De-Novo, 1986 ). This produces increased resistance to luminal transit of ingesta. These drugs effectively relieve abdominal pain and tenesmus and reduce the frequency of stools. Anticholinergic and related antispasmodic drugs have an uncertain role in the management of diarrhea. Anticholinergic drugs block the effect of acetylcholine, the major neurotransmitter of the gastrointestinal smooth muscle, resulting in both decreased peristalsis and decreased segmenta-tion. With their use, motility of the small intestine and colon can be stopped, which allows the occurrence of bacterial overgrowth, thus compounding the hypomotility and possibly the diarrhea problem. Therefore, the narcotic analgesics, such as diphenoxylate hydrochloride and loperamide hydrochloride, are the preferred motility modifiers to be used in the symptomatic treatment of diarrhea. If the diarrhea is caused by an infectious agent such as Salmonel/a, the narcotic analgesics may be detrimental because they may trap organisms and their toxins within the intestine, and the infection may persist longer.",

In this disorder, morphologic changes in the mucosa of the small intestine, as determined by mucosal biopsies, are variable; changes appear patchy within individual animals and consist of partial villous atrophy with no remarkable alterations in the cellular components of the lamina propria. Specific activities of important brush-border enzymes of the villus are selectively decreased, and this is probably responsible for hypersensitivity to various components in dietary wheat (Batt et aI, 1984) . Thus the diarrheal disorder is attributed more to brush-border enzyme abnormalities than to specific morphologic changes in the small intestinal mucosa. Dietary management is the most practical approach to its diagnosis and treatment. A wheatsensitive enteropathy can usually be determined by a positive response to removal of wheat from the diet and return of signs when wheat is reintroduced.",

Linear foreign objects that are commonly ingested include elastic string, elastic binding from a golf ball, fishing line, cord, shoelaces, dental floss, pantyhose, fabric, and Christmas tree decorations. For a linear foreign object to cause problems, it must become fixed at some cranial site within the alimentary tract. Usually the object is either looped around the base of the tongue or lodged at the pylorus. Intestinal motility then propels the rest of the trailing object in an aboral direction through the intestine. Because the object is fixed cranially, motility of the small intestine is unable to move the luminal object into the large intestine. Consequently, the small intestine moves cranially over the fixed object, with resultant pleating or bunching of the intestine over the linear object, creating a partial or complete intestinal obstruction, multiple perforation sites, and either localized or generalized peritonitis ( Fig. 10-27 ). Cats are much more likely than dogs to ingest linear foreign objects.",

Tenesmus may also occur with the diarrhea. If the intussusception has prolapsed through the anus, it must be differentiated from a rectal prolapse; this is done by passing a finger or blunt probe into the rectum between the mass and rectal wall. If the mass is a prolapsed intussusception, the probe or finger may be inserted a considerable distance. An intussusception is confirmed with abdominal radiographs (Kealy, 1987) . Results of survey radiographs depend on whether the intussusception is causing a complete or a partial obstruction. If the obstruction is complete, dilated gas-filled and fluid-filled loops of intestine are seen cranial to the intussusception, and the colon is void of feces. If the obstruction is par-tial, there is little, if any, distention of the intestine, and feces are usually present in the colon. The intussusception itself may not be seen owing to its fluid density and to the overlapping density of fluid-filled intestine. Probably the better method of demonstrating a nonopaque intussusception is via barium enema (Fig. 10-28 ) (Kealy, 1987) or abdominal ultrasonography.",

It is also important to determine the inciting cause of the intussusception and to eliminate it, if possible. If the intussusception is due to altered motility secondary to parasite-induced enteritis, the appropriate anthelmintic should be administered. The ability to manually reduce an intus- WB Saunders, 1987, P 93.) susception at surgery depends on its duration ( Fig. 10-29) . One hand is used to hold the ensheathing layer (intussuscipiens), while the other hand pushes the apex of the invaginating layer (intussusceptum) cranially and exerts gentle traction on the intestine cranial to the intussusception (Bojrab, 1986) . After manual reduction of the intussusception, the intestine and mesentery are carefully checked for viability. If the involved segment is nonviable, then that segment should be resected and the remaining ends anastomosed. In intussusceptions of longer duration, manual reduction may be impossible. Adhesions often develop as a result of vascular damage and production of a fibrinous exudate The Digestive System I 191 from the serosal surfaces. With time, the compromised circulation causes an ischemic necrosis and often a localized peritonitis. In those cases in which manual reduction is impossible because of adhesions or if the segment of intestine is no longer viable, resection and anastomosis are warranted (Bojrab, 1986) .",

Some animals have the misleading complaint of diarrhea. The disruption and irritation of the intestinal mucosa promote secretion and accumulation of fluid that cannot penetrate the densely packed fecal materials and thus produce diarrhea. If defecation has not been observed, the animal may be brought to the veterinarian because it is depressed, listless, inappetent or anorexic, and vomiting intermittently (Burrows, 1986) . Animals presenting with fecal impaction are generally dehydrated. Cats may assume a crouching, hunched attitude indicative of abdominal pain, and obvious abdominal distention is observed occasionally. Abdominal palpation typically reveals hard fecal mass(es) that may fill the entire length of the large intestine. Rectal examination combined with abdominal palpation is useful in determining the amount of feces retained and compressibility of the material present and possibly in identifying the underlying cause of the fecal impaction, such as foreign object(s) or a narrowed pelvic canal.

If all the layers are involved, the prolapsed rectum takes on a more cylindric shape. A rectal prolapse can be mistaken for a rare intussusception of a more cranial section of the intestine that has prolapsed through the anal orifice. Differentiation between rectal prolapse and intussusception is made by attempting to insert a finger or blunt probe between the mucocutaneous junction of the anus and protruding bowel. If the finger or blunt probe is easily passed, an intussusception is present; if resistance is met, a rectal prolapse has occurred (Seim, 1986) . Treatment. A rectal prolapse does not occur without cause. Failure to identify and treat the underlying cause of rectal prolapse often results in its unsuccessful treatment. The initial treatment should include fluid replacement therapy for dehydration and electrolyte disturbances, symptomatic control of diarrhea, and administration of appropriate medication in the case of parasitic or bacterial enterocolitis. The rectal prolapse itself can be managed by several methods, including reduction and purse-string suture, amputation, and colopexy (Seim, 1986) . The method selected depends on the viability of the prolapsed tissue, the size and reducibility of the prolapse, and recurrence after a previous method has failed. Edematous but viable prolapsed tissue appears moist and varies from pink to dark red. Mucosa that is irreversibly damaged or necrotic appears leather-like and may be purple or black. With the animal under general anesthesia, a minor rectal prolapse of viable mucosa may be reduced manually and maintained by a purse-string suture in the anus for about 7 days, leaving a small orifice for stool passage. The small orifice is created by drawing the purse-string suture closed around a 4-inch rectal thermometer or another object of similar diameter. Desiccants such as hypertonic solutions of glucose or granulated sugar can be applied on the prolapsed tissue to reduce the edema before reduction and placement of the purse-string suture. Topical anesthetic ointment with 1% dibucaine can be instilled in the rectum postoperatively and continued for 2 or 3 days after removal of the purse-string suture (Seim, 1986) .",

A nonreducible viable prolapse or a recurrent rectal prolapse that fails to respond to more conservative treatment may be treated by celiotomy and colopexy (Seim, 1986) . For the colopexy, scarified surfaces of the descending colon and the sublumbar body wall are sutured together with several interrupted mattress stitches of nonabsorbable suture material, attaching the submucosal layer of the colon to the muscles of the abdominal wall. Topical anesthetic ointment is instilled rectally after colopexy and continued for 5 or 6 days postoperatively.",

Of these anomalies, imperforate anus, although rarely seen, is the most common. Puppies or kittens with congenital anorectal anomalies usually are presented to a veterinarian because of an absence of defecation, obvious defect in the anatomy of the perineal structures, or voiding of urine or feces through an inappropriate orifice (Chambers, 1986) . A distended abdomen often accompanies these anomalies if obstruction is present. The anorectal anomalies occasionally go unnoticed until the animal is several weeks old and may not be readily apparent from the appearance of the perineum.",

            "text": "Imperforate anus encompasses several types of congenital deformity (Seim, 1986) . Imperforate anus type 1 results from a failure of perforation of the anal membrane. Treatment consists of simply rupturing the membrane and trimming the excess tissue. A 4-inch rectal thermometer is used to ensure that the anal opening is adequate. Imperforate anus type 2 (also referred to as atresia ant) results from failure of the cloacal membrane to rupture, leaving a relatively thick membrane covering the anal orifice ( Fig. 10-31) . The anal sphincter is usually intact and functional. Treatment is directed at locating the anal dimple, dissecting the membrane to the level of the rectal mucosa, and suturing the mucosa to the subcutaneous tissue and skin. A convenient way of excising the anal membrane and exposing the underlying rectum is to make two incisions at right angles to each other, forming a \"+\" centered on the anal dimple (Chambers, 1986) . The four angled skin flaps thus formed are undermined and excised. The subcutaneous tissue is bluntly separated, and the blind-ended rectum is isolated and gently pulled toward the anus with forceps or stay sutures. The end of the rectum is then incised, and the mucosa is apposed to the skin with simple, interrupted stitches of absorbable. suture material. The Digestive System I 195 Imperforate anus type 3 (also referred to as rectal agenesis) results when the rectum ends blindly at a variable distance from the anal membrane. A lateral abdominal radiograph with the animal's hindquarters slightly elevated will allow visual observation of gas in the termination of the rectum (Seim, 1986) . The distance from the rectum to the anal membrane allows differentiation between imperforate anus types 2 and 3. Treatment requires a combined abdominal and perineal surgical approach (Seim, 1986) . The distal region of the rectum is exposed abdominally and then delivered through the pelvic canal to an opening made in the anal dimple. Rectal mucosa is then sutured to the subcutaneous tissue and skin in the perianal region. Animals may remain fecal incontinent after surgical correction.",

Contrast radiography is needed to establish the presence and position of fistulas between the anorectum and urogenital tract before surgical correction is attempted. Fistulas require lengthy dissection procedures and general anesthesia. Most of these fistulas can be isolated through a vertical midline perineal incision from the ventral region of the anus to the vulva (Chambers, 1986) . Gentle blunt dissection is used to separate the supporting tissue between the rectum and urogenital tract. Once isolated, the fistula is excised, and the lumina of the anorectum and urogenital tract are closed separately with simple interrupted stitches of 4-0 or 5-0 synthetic absorbable suture material. If the anorectum is malpositioned, it is relocated in the center of the external anal sphincter muscle, and the mucosa is sutured to the skin circumferentially with simple interrupted stitches of the same suture material. The fecal impaction is relieved manu-ally and with judicious use of enemas. The large intestine often is atonic and may require intermittent evacuation until normal defecation is established. ",
