SARS-3CL pro is a viral cysteine protease critical to the pathogen's life cycle and hence a therapeutic target of importance. The recently elucidated crystal structures of this enzyme provide an opportunity for the discovery of inhibitors through rational drug design. In the current study, Gold docking program was utilized to conduct extensive docking studies against the target crystal structure to develop a robust and predictive docking protocol. The validated docking protocol was used to conduct a structure-based virtual screening of the Asinex Platinum collection. Biological evaluation of a screened selection of compounds was carried out to identify novel inhibitors of the viral protease.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a highly infectious upper respiratory tract disease which reached epidemic status in 2003. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] The first reported outbreak of the disease occurred in 2002 in the Guangdong province of China. Within the span of a year the disease had spread over to 32 countries in Asia, North America, and Europe. The disease infected nearly 8000 people worldwide with an average mortality rate of around 10%. The etiological agent of the disease was identified as a previously unknown human coronavirus christened as the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). It is an enveloped positive sense RNA virus from the coronaviridae family containing a single chain RNA genome of $29,700 nucleotides, the largest viral RNA genome reported to date. 6, 7 Although there have been no reported occurrences of SARS infections since 2004, the disease should still be treated as a high health risk because of its high virulence and contagious nature. Historical evidence on several viral diseases, such as influenza, suggests that recurrences of epidemic outbreaks, caused by the wildtype or mutated variants of the virus, are common. These recurrences are usually spread over a long period of time and may occur in regions which are geographically distant to each other. Therefore, there is an urgent need for the understanding of the etiology, pathology, and possible therapeutic targets against this virus. Knowledge gained from these studies can not only be used in the design of therapies against the current form of the virus but may be carried over in the future to other mutated variants or other pathogenic viruses from the same family.",

            "text": "The SARS-CoV genome contains two open reading frames connected by a ribosomal frame shift which encode for two large replicase polyproteins pp1a ($450 kDa) and pp1ab ($750 kDa) which function in the viral replication and transcription processes. The polyproteins are processed by viral proteases 8, 9 to generate the functional components of a multiprotein complex known as viral replicase-transcriptase. 10, 11 While most coronaviruses utilize three proteases for proteolytic processing the SARS-CoV is known to encode only two proteases for this purpose. These two proteases include a papain-like cysteine protease (PLP2 pro ) 12 and a Chymotrypsin-like cysteine protease known as 3C-like protease (3CL pro ). The 3CL pro enzyme [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] is also called as the main protease (M pro ) since it plays a pivotal role in the processing of the viral polyproteins and controlling of the replicase complex activity. The enzyme is indispensable to the viral replication and infection processes, thereby making it an ideal target for the design of antiviral therapy. The availability of multiple crystal structures [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] of the enzyme with co-crystallized ligands makes the target amenable to structure-based drug design.",

Figure 1 shows some of the latest peptidic 29,32-34 and small molecule 24, 35, 36 based inhibitors devised using the structural information and the substrate specificity profile of the SARS-3CL pro enzyme. The peptidic inhibitors were designed by attaching a reactive 'warhead' type agent to a peptide mimicking the natural substrate. These warhead groups include Michael acceptors, 23, 29, 34 aldehydes, 29,37 epoxy ketones, 32 halo methyl ketones, 33 and a few others. 38 These inhibitors act through a two-step procedure wherein they first bind and form a non-covalent complex with the enzyme such that the warhead group is located in close vicinity of the catalytic residue. This is followed by a nucleophilic attack by the catalytic cys-teine and covalent adduct formation. The other category includes the non-peptidic inhibitors containing small molecule scaffolds. These inhibitors have been discovered using various techniques such as structure based virtual screening, 24, 36, 39, 35 pharmacophore based screening 40 as well as high through screening 41 methodologies.",

Evaluation of the generated docking poses is carried out using a metric such as a scoring function to identify putative binders. Compared to the high throughput screening of an entire compound library, only a small set of molecules selected on the basis of the screening strategy is evaluated in a biological assay to identify inhibitors of the target. In the present study, the Asinex Platinum collection was screened against the SARS-3CL pro enzyme crystal structure using the Gold docking program. Biological evaluation of a selected set of compounds in a SARS-3CL pro inhibition assay led to the identification of novel hits with activity in the low micromolar range which could be further optimized to develop potent antiviral therapies against SARS-CoV infections.",

            "text": "2.1. Analysis of SARS-3CL pro binding site requirements The 33.8 kDa SARS-3CL pro enzyme is a functional homodimer and shows three structural domains with an antiparallel b-barrel-shaped structure akin to the serine protease Chymotrypsin. The active site is located in a groove between the domains I and II and is a fairly solvent exposed and shallow cavity. The enzyme is an atypical cysteine protease, containing a catalytic diad (His41-Cys145) instead of a triad. Multiple crystal structures of SARS-3CL pro with co-crystallized inhibitors (1UK4, 19 2AMD, 20 The co-crystallized peptidic Michael-acceptor based inhibitor 9IN, from the SARS-3CL pro structure (2AMD, PDB code), is structurally analogous to the Cbz protected hexapeptide-CMK (chloro methyl ketone) inhibitor (1UK4, PDB code) and undergoes similar binding site interactions. Therefore, the cocrystallized pose of 9IN ( Fig. 2a and b) is used here to describe the relevant binding site interactions and the enzyme's subsite specificity. Mutation studies 44 have been carried out on the substrates of related coronavirus proteases to understand the specificity at each of the binding subsites and the effect of these mutations on the substrate binding and catalytic efficiency of the enzyme. It was found that the mutations at the P1 position produced the most significant loss in enzyme activity and the corresponding S1 sub site is very specific to a Glutamine residue. The other subsites of interest were S1 0 , S2, and S4 and the preferred substrate amino acid side chains for these sites were S1 0 (alanine/serine), S2 (leucine), and S4 (valine/serine). In case of the 9IN cocrystallized pose, the b-carbon of the Michael acceptor forms a covalent bond with the sulfur of the catalytic cysteine (Cys145). The cyclized ketoglutamine group occupies the S1 subsite and acts as an entropically favored surrogate for the glutamine side chain of the native substrate. The carbonyl oxygen of the ketoglutamine group undergoes a hydrogen bonding interaction with His163 while the ring amide NH forms a hydrogen bond donor interaction with the backbone carbonyl oxygen of Phe140. The side chain of Glu166 is also in close vicinity to form a hydrogen bond interaction with the ring amide NH group after minor rotameric adjustment. An interaction of this nature between the nitrogen of the P1-glutamine side chain or its surrogate and the side chain carboxylate oxygen of Glu166 is seen in the crystal structure of SARS-3CL pro inhibited by an aza peptide epoxide 22 (2A5I, PDB code) as well as a peptidic aldehyde 29 (2GX4, PDB code) based inhibitor. The S2 (His41, Met49, Tyr54) and S4 (Met 130, Pro163, Gln192) subsites are primarily hydrophobic in nature and are occupied by a leucine and valine residue, respectively. The terminal ethyl group of the ligand occupies the S1 0 site and undergoes hydrophobic interactions with Thr25 and Leu27. Additional hydrogen bonds are noticed between the peptidic backbone of the ligand and the residues Glu166, Gln189, and Thr190. Overall, the presence of hydrophobic groups at the S1 0 , S2, and S4 sites and a hydrogen bond acceptor at the S1 0 site can be considered as critical pharmacophoric requirements ( Fig. 2c) for the binding of putative inhibitors.",

The ligand has a large number of rotatable bonds and improperly resolved coordinates for the termi- nal portion of the ligand where the catalytic cysteine sulfur forms a covalent adduct with the ligand. Therefore, it was not feasible to conduct a pose validation study using this ligand structure. A series of phthalhydrazide based peptidic analogues 45 (Supplementary information, Fig. S1 ) with inhibitory activity against the SARS-3CL pro had been reported and was utilized in a validation study using Gold 2.2 to select the binding site definition and scoring function utilized for binding pose calculation. Amongst the thirteen ketoglutamine based analogues four had IC 50 values of 10 lM or less (pIC 50 P 5, IC 50 6 10 lM), four had IC 50 values ranging from 10 to 100 lM while five had activities greater than 100 lM (pIC 50 6 4, IC 50 P 100 lM). Typically, a molecule with a higher binding affinity would have a better interaction and geometrical profile as compared to that of molecule with a weaker binding affinity. A scoring function should be able to evaluate the quality of the binding poses and separate the poses of the actives (IC 50 6 10 lM) and the inactives (IC 50 P 100 lM) based on their docking scores. The docking calculations were conducted using the Gold standard mode speed up which allows for 100,000 genetic operations per docking pose. The Goldscore function was evaluated for its predictive ability and was found to provide a score based separation of the actives and the inactives (Supplementary information, Table S1 ). The separation becomes more pronounced if one outlier (molecule 4), which was awarded a lower docking score. was discounted from the comparison. This validated protocol was utilized in the actual screening.",

One approach we have successfully used previously 46,47 toward minimizing the overall down time without compromising the quality is to carry out a multi-stage cascade docking involving a less intensive and faster docking protocol at the early stages of the screening and a gradual increment in the computational complexity as we proceed toward the final stages. Typically, at the early stages of screening, the aim is to look for shape complementarity of the docked molecules against the binding site and elimination of molecules with low probability of attaining a proper binding pose within the active site. On the contrary, the final stage of the screening process involves the selection of deserving hits based on their complementarity with the binding site interactions and the geometrical qualities of the binding pose itself. While the elimination stage can be handled by a less intensive docking calculation, a more rigorous protocol incorporating exhaustive conformational sampling is a critical requirement for the final stages of the screening. In this case, a three stage docking protocol of increasing computational complexity ( Fig. 3 ) was implemented using the Gold 2.2 docking program.",

In the second phase, the molecule ranked within the top 30% (GDR score) of the 3000 molecules (Stage II 0 ) but was still far down to be selected for visual inspection.

The knowledge based filter generated using the docking pose based descriptors helped us in curtailing the top 3000 poses to 450 molecules (Stage III 0 ). In essence, the molecule of our interest still had the same score but a large number of poses ranked higher than this one but not fulfilling the descriptor criteria were removed by the filter, thereby boosting PJ169's position and bringing into a selected group which would be put through actual visual inspection.

The molecule was retrieved into the top30% (GDR score) of the 450 molecules in the Stage III 0 of the extension phase.

The enrichment study was conducted using a dataset comprising of 19 actives (Supplementary information,  Fig. S2 ) and 897 dummy (inactive) molecules taken from the ZINC database (http://zinc.docking.org/). The range scaled scores were calculated using expression 1 implemented in a python script.",

Hydrophobic features were defined as spheres with a tolerance value of 1.5 \u00c5 and were located on the geometric centroid of the heavy atoms of the relevant ligand side chains. The hydrogen bond acceptor feature was defined using the side chain carbonyl oxygen of the P1 ketoglutamine group. Each molecule was enumerated by 100 conformers generated in the 'fast' mode. Fitting of the conformers to the pharmacophore was handled using the 'fast fit' method. Docking pose based descriptors (Fig. 4d) for 'virtual' visual inspection were generated using Silver 1.1 (CCDC, Cambridge, UK) using the 2AMD (PDB code) co-crystallized ligand protein complex. Four descriptors (three hydrophobic, one hydrogen bond) were defined and any given pose could attain a score ranging from 0 to 4. The hydrophobic descriptor definition was similar to that of the hydrophobic feature of the pharmacophore pre-filter but consisted of spheres of 2 \u00c5 radius. Occupancy of P75% of the sphere volume by the ligand hydrophobic atoms was considered as positive occupancy. The hydrogen bond donor descriptor was defined using the N(e)-H of His163 and had the geometric criteria of D-H-A angle P120\u00b0and D-A distance 63.5 \u00c5 . Molecular diversity was calculated using the dissimilarity selection module of Sybyl 6.9.",
