Reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction amplification using this set of degenerate primers yielded products of the expected size from the genomes of all three viruses. It also yielded a product of appropriate size from the genome of another strain of PRRSV (VR2332), the ORF lb sequence of which is unknown, but the 3' end of the genome of which differs from that of the PRRSV-LV genome by about 50%. No products were generated from the genome of simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV), another member of this virus group. However, an appropriate product was generated with a second set of degenerate primers which was designed from the same ORF lb segments of LDV, EAV and PRRSV-LV as the first set but on the basis of human codon preferences. Sequence analysis showed that the amplified SHFV ORF lb segment exhibited about 50% nucleotide identity with the corresponding segments of ORF lb of LDV, EAV and PRRSV. The results show that these and other degenerate primer sets might be useful for the search of related viruses in other mammalian species.",

            "text": "Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) of mice, equine arteritis virus (EAV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) belong to a new group of positive-stranded RNA viruses, presently classified as the genus Arterivirus (reviewed in Plagemann and Moennig, 1992; Plagemann, 1996) . These viruses are enveloped and have a diameter of 40-60 nm. Their genomic RNA is 13-15 kb and gene expression is via formation of 6 or 7 subgenomic mRNAs. They also possess common biological properties: they replicate primarily in macrophages and can establish long-term asymptomatic persistent infections in their hosts. These viruses were discovered only accidentally or because of the appearance of variants with increased pathogenic potential. The discovery of LDV was based on a 5-to 10-fold increase in plasma lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity caused by LDV infection in mice. SHFV establishes long-term asymptomatic infections in several genera of African monkeys and it was discovered because accidental transmission in colonies causes a generally fatal hemorrhagic fever in Asian macaque monkeys. EAV and PRRSV infections are most often subclinical but infection can result in severe respiratory symptoms and reproductive failure in their respective hosts (Meredith, 1993; Timoney and McCollum, 1993) . The reasons for the variability in the outcome of EAV and PRRSV infections have not been elucidated but probably reflect the existence of variants with different pathogenic potential.",

Such viruses may have escaped detection because they generally cause only subclinical infections. However, if this is the case, variants with increased pathogenicity may emerge under certain environmental conditions, as apparently has been the case with PRRSV, since PRRS as a disease appeared only recently, independently in 1987 in the U.S. and in 1990 in Western Europe (Meredith, 1993) .

Serological tests seem of no use for this purpose because antibodies to LDV, EAV, SHFV and PRRSV do not cross-react (Plagemann and Moennig, 1992) . The problem is further complicated by the very restricted host ranges of these viruses which make their isolation by propagation in cell culture difficult. LDV replicates only in a subpopulation of mouse tissue macrophages; SHFV and PRRSV replicate only in cultures of alveolar macrophages of their respective hosts and clones of a single African green monkey kidney cell line (MA104) but not all viral isolates infect MA104-derived cells; and EAV infects horse macrophages and a number of lines of kidney cells from different species (Plagemann, 1996) . These difficulties have led us to develop a molecular method for the detection of viruses of this group. It is based on our finding of segments with identical amino acids in the ORF lb replicase proteins of the two strains of LDV, LDV-C (Godeny et al., 1993) and LDV-P Palmer et al., 1995) , one strain of EAV (Bucyrus strain; den Boon et al., 1991) and one strain of PRRSV (Lelystad virus, LV; Meulenberg et al., 1993) that have been sequenced.",

For example, the amino acid identities for the predicted LDV-P proteins with those of LDV-C, PRRSV-LV and EAV range from 75 to 99%, 33 to 57% and 27 to 40%, respectively (Plagemann, 1996) . However, the greatest degree of amino acid identity is observed for the predicted ORF lb proteins which contain common replicase, helicase and zinc finger motifs. Especially striking is the amino acid identity in a segment of the ORF lb proteins containing the universal replicase motif D.. Fig. 1 ). This amino acid identity suggests that these segments may play important roles in the function of the replicase protein. We have focused on two of the longest stretches with amino acid identity (segments 3 and 5, Fig. 1 ) and have generated sense and antisense degenerate oligonucleotide primers representing these segments of LDV-P, PRRSV-LV and EAV ( Fig. 2A ) with which reverse transcription (RT)/polymerase chain reaction (PCR) should generate specific products from the genomes of these viruses and perhaps the genomes of related other viruses. The anticipated PCR product using these primers should be 170 nucleotides long and products of this size were indeed obtained from the genomes of all three viruses (see below).",

Analysis of RNA extracted from the cell culture fluid indicated the presence of only small amounts of 15 kb genomic RNA in addition to two prominent species of RNAs of about 2.7 and 1.6 kb and two minor RNAs with intermediate molecular weights (Fig. 4A , lane 1). The origin(s) of the smaller RNAs is not known. The 1.6-kb RNA could be 18S rRNA, but it and some of the other RNAs could be defective interfering (DI) RNAs (M.A. Brinton, personal communication).",

However, products were generated from SHFV RNA with a second degenerate primer set designed for the same ORF lb replicase segments on the basis of human codon preferences (A1481/A1482; Fig. 2B ). With these primers a product of the predicted size (161 nucleotides) was generated from SHFV RNA (data not shown, see later) but not from LDV-P RNA. The product was TA cloned and two independent clones were sequenced (see later). In the course of these studies we observed that SHFV replicated much more efficiently in C1-2621 cells than in MA-104 cells; CI-2621 represents a clone of MA-104 cells which has been isolated for the propagation of PRRSV but has not been previously used in SHFV studies. SHFV infection resulted in complete destruction of C1-2621 cell cultures by 1-2 days p.i. and the virus formed plaques in cultures of these cells in 1-2 days. This permitted plaque purification of the virus. SHFV was plaque purified three consecutive times. When then propagated in CI-2621 cells, 1-or 2-day culture fluid consistently contained about 2--3 \u2022 107 PFU/ml. RNA extracted from SHFV harvested from such culture fluids was largely free of the smaller RNAs (Fig. 4A, lane 2) . ART/ PCR product of the expected size 161 nt) was generated from this RNA with the A1481/A1482 primer A. (C) Northern hybridization analyses of RNA were conducted as described previously (Kuo et al., 1991) using as probes SHFV ORF lb cDNA (see Fig. 5A ; lanes 1-3) or a cDNA to the 3' end of the SHFV genome (see text; lanes 4-6). The cDNA probes were labeled by random priming using [ct-32p]dATP as described previously . set (Fig. 4B) . The product was TA cloned and three additional clones sequenced. The sequences agreed well with each other and those of the two clones isolated earlier. The consensus sequence is shown in Fig. 5A . The only variability seen was in the segments representing the degenerate primer set (only the sequences of these segments of one clone are shown in Fig. 5A ). This variability indicates the independent origin of the five clones that have been sequenced. The consensus sequence of 121 nt between the two primers of the SHFV cDNA clones was colinear with those of LDV-P, LDV-C, EAV and PRRSV-LV and exhibited 52-56% nt identity with all of them (Table 1 ). The SHFV segment was comparison of the amino acid sequence of the predicted 40-amino-acid-long SHFV ORF lb protein segment with the homologous segments of the ORF lb proteins of LDV-P, LDV-C, PRRSV-LV and EAV (B). In A, the segments representing the A1481/A1482 degenerate primer set are overlined and in B, + = amino acids that are identical in the segments of all five viruses. The SHFV ORF lb sequence has been submitted to the GenBank nucleotide sequence data bank and has been assigned accession number U28864.",

Of special interest is the finding that these degenerate primer sets generated products from the genomes of three viruses, namely PRRSV-VR2332, SHFV and the vaccine strain of EAV, for which no ORF lb sequence information was available so that their sequences could not be incorporated into the design of the degenerate primer sets. This finding is not only significant in the case of SHFV, a quite distinct virus, but also in the case of PRRSV, since the known 3' end of the genome of PRRSV-VR2332 differs considerably from that of PRRSV-LV (by about 50%; Murtaugh et al., 1995) . Similarly, the sequence of the EAV vaccine strain used in the present study may differ considerably from that of the wild-type Bucyrus strain that has been sequenced (den Boon et al., 1991) since the vaccine strain has been passaged about 300 times through cultures of various types of cells (Timoney and McCollum, 1993) . It is also of interest that in the case of the SHFV gen0me, the degenerate primer set designed from genome sequences of LDV, PRRSV-LV and EAV yielded no RT/PCR product but that the primer set designed for the same genome segments on the basis of human codon preferences did yield products which exhibited strong sequence homology with the equivalent segments of ORFs lb of the other viruses of this group.",
