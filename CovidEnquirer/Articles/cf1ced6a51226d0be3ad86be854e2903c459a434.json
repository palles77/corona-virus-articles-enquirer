            "text": "The Ebola outbreak highlighted the challenge of health security and particularly of how best to give frontline workers the knowledge, confidence and competence to respond effectively. The goal was to develop a tool to improve infection prevention and control through local capacity building within the context of an emergency response. The research showed that digital technology could be a powerful 'force multiplier' allowing much greater access to high fidelity training during an outbreak and keeping it current as protocols evolved or new safety critical steps were identified. Tailoring training to the local context was crucial to its relevance and accessibility. This initiative used a novel approach to the development of the training tool -ebuddi. It used agile development to co-create the tool with active participation of local communities. A further pilot showed how it could be extended to meet the longer term needs of triage training and ensure better quality assurance. In the longer term it may have the potential to improve compliance with International Health Regulations, be adapted for future emergencies, and contribute to global health security.",

            "text": "The recent Ebola outbreak highlighted four key areas of concern in health security. Firstly, it focused attention on the importance of infection prevention and control (IPC) competence and compliance amongst frontline workers in a region as large and remote as West Africa. Secondly, training needed to be accessible to a wide range of people be they working in healthcare and the laboratory sectors or burial teams and maintenance staff -all with large variations in skills, knowledge and education levels [1] . These workers, whether they were professionals or volunteers, needed access to training to keep themselves, their patients, colleagues and families safe. Thirdly, community engagement was vital in controlling the outbreak. Finally, the need to be prepared for novel and new pathogens such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and other strains showing resistance to anti-microbials. Ebola was not a one off -there will be constant challenges of this nature, requiring healthcare systems to be more resilient, watchful and responsive than ever before. There are important messages to learn about health security from the Ebola response, both in the West African region and globally. Even highly trained international health workers lacked skills in the use of Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) which lead to high profile cases of infection. These observations imply a problem with how such epidemics are handled and without a change in attitude and approach; similar issues could resurface in the next outbreak, as illustrated by the challenge of dealing with the endemic Lassa Fever in the same region [2] .",

West Africa has seen technology leapfrog from minimal use of social media and connectivity to rapid adoption of to smartphones and use of tablets, without following the evolutionary path through desktops and laptops. This meant that agencies outside the region often underestimated the utility of digital tools or were constrained by the belief that custom low cost hardware would be necessary to ensure the broadest possible update of such tools.",

The intuitiveness of the module and the familiarity of the graphics were important. Unknown objects in the background distracted users from the key messages from the program, so the study worked alongside Liberian trainers to design a setting that was familiar to end users.

In the end, this would allow trainers to pick and choose the topics they needed according to their local priorities. The initial ebuddi module evolved to respond to the changing training needs in Liberia. Its teaching responded to changes in the National Guidelines that shifted focus from specific Ebola material to generic IPC in health facilities -from the 'Keep Safe Keep Serving' curriculum to the 'SQS' curriculum [15, 16] . The Liberia specific module developed is currently being adapted for training in standard precautions and IPC in Sierra Leone to build resilience post Ebola as part of the iCARE project, funded by the Department for International Development UK. Agile development has enabled the core modules to be adapted to this changing focus. This was a good indication of how the program could adapt to new material, something that the modular approach helped significantly.",

It began to address some of key concerns in health security raised from the lessons learnt from the Ebola response -focusing on improving outcomes in skill improvement not just outputs of number of health workers trained. The importance of IPC in such outbreaks is undeniable. Frontline workers need frequent, high quality training that is accessible to all and independent of location and education level. It needs to adapt to changing resources such as available equipment and how to respond to shortages, introduction of new equipment, procedural change and learning from incidents that might have resulted when critical safety steps have not been fully understood. The training needs to adhere to local policies and protocols. This is captured in the ebuddi development process by a compliance document that details local guidance and captures key learning, critical steps and evaluation points. The field trials showcased the potential of ebuddi to augment existing IPC training in Liberia, which has contributed to the success of stopping the outbreak. True behavior change of health care workers is difficult to ensure as adherence to standard protocols can wane quickly when the acute threat of infection is deemed to have reduced. The second key concern is that everyone must have access to required knowledge and skills to work with confidence and competence, a philosophy enshrined in the EFN report 'We are not prepared unless we are all prepared' [6] . ebuddi seemed to increase the confidence of healthcare workers in the short term, although the long term benefits require further research. A key finding from the fieldwork was that the graphics needed to be familiar to the trainee -including the design of the health facility, equipment available and surrounding landscape (rural or urban). The addition of a local soundscape further increases the immersive nature of the learning experience. Increased usability of the module developed from feedback, engaged a wide audience regardless of skills, knowledge or education levels. Community engagement is vital in controlling an outbreak such as Ebola. The co-creation model of ebuddi empowers frontline workers and trainers to give valued feedback and critically be able to see their input in the module. This ensured authenticity and buy in to any subsequent development. The avatar characteristics can be changed to reflect an appropriate mix of gender, ethnicity and culturally appropriate clothing. This gives the module great potential to relate to different communities and demographics, and recognise the importance of highlighting the key role women play in the response by highlighting this in the simulation exercises [17] .",
