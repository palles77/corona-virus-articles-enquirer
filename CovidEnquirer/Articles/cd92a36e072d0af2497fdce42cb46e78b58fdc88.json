A large body of evidence indicates that these differential responses depend not only on viral factors but also on inherited components affecting host susceptibility. Significant advances in our understanding of the host response to infection in humans and other animal species have recently been achieved through the use of mouse models of infection. In laboratory mice, years of inbreeding have fixed deleterious alleles, which can be detected as susceptibility phenotypes. Two major breakthroughs advanced this field. One was our ability to manipulate the mouse genome using transgenic and gene knockout technologies. This 'reverse genetics' approach allows direct testing of specific genes for their role in host resistance or susceptibility to infection. The other was our ability to clone genes responsible for natural variation in susceptibility to infection among inbred strains of mice, through molecular genetics. This 'forward genetics' approach can uncover novel mechanisms of host defense that are crucial to effective and protective responses to infection.",

Resistance is due to allelic variation in the gene encoding carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1) [4] . Susceptible strains carry the Ceacam1a allele, which encodes the principal MHV receptor, CEA-CAM1a. Resistant strains, such as SJL, are homozygous for the Ceacam1b allele, which encodes a 27-amino-acid substitution in the N-terminal virus-binding domain of CEACAM1a [4] . An IMMUNORECEPTOR TYROSINE-BASED INHIBITORY MOTIF (ITIM) (see Glossary) is present in the cytoplasmic domain of CEACAM1, also suggesting a potential immunomodulatory function for this molecule during MHV infection. Although no role for human CEACAM1a has been described during viral infection of humans [5] , a possible immunomodulatory function is consistent with the observation of a CEACAM1-mediated suppression of CD4 \u00fe T-cell activation during infection by the pathogenic bacteria Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Neisseria meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae. These human pathogens bind to domain 1 of CEACAM1, very close to the site recognized by MHV [6] .",

The Fv4 (or Akvr) locus is a defective endogenous ecotropic provirus that encodes an Env protein, which also has a fusion defect [7, 8] .

CD4 is the primary or 'attachment' receptor for HIV, but CD4 is necessary but not sufficient for the productive entry of HIV into target cells. The identification of CCR5 as a coreceptor for HIV prompted genetic screening of individuals that escape HIV disease despite high-risk behavior [10] . Individuals carrying a homozygous 32 bp deletion in the coding sequence of CCR5 (CCR5D32) are extremely resistant to the 'R5'strain of HIV because the deletion results in a frame shift and generates a nonfunctional receptor [10] . The CCR5D32 mutation is found predominantly in the Caucasian population and is absent in Africans, American Indians and East Asians [11] . It has been speculated that this distribution is consistent with resistance to an agent that predates HIVand caused enormous mortality. One candidate is Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of bubonic plague, although other pathogens targeting the macrophage/monocyte lineage cannot be excluded [12] .",

These motifs are associated with tyrosine kinases and other phosphotyrosinebinding proteins involved in cellular activation. Immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) : a cytoplasmic tyrosine-containing motif. In contrast to ITAMs, phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues within ITIMs recruits the Src-homology-2-domain-containing tyrosine phosphatase SHP-1 and/or SHP-2, transducing a negative signal that inhibits cellular activation. Interferons (IFNs) : a group of immunoregulatory proteins that are produced by cells infected with a virus and have the ability to inhibit viral growth. IFNs are classified as type I (IFN-a/b), which have antiviral properties, and as type II (IFN-g), which is known as immune interferon. Despite the use of different receptors, certain IFN-a/b and IFN-g functions are shared because the signal transduction pathways activated through these receptors partly overlap. Murine leukemia virus (MuLV) : there are four subgroups of naturally occurring MuLVs based on receptor usage on mouse cells: ecotropic MuLVs, which are able to infect only mouse cells utilizing the cationic amino acid transporter as a receptor; amphotropic MuLVs, which are able to infect mouse cells as well as those of other species (including human) by binding to an inorganic phosphate transporter protein; polytropic MuLVs, which can infect cells from mouse as well as nonmurine species using yet another cellular receptor protein, thought to be a G-protein-coupled receptor; and xenotropic MuLVs, which use receptors from cells of most species except mice. Quantitative trait loci (QTLs) : the locations of genes that affect a trait that is measured on a quantitative (linear) scale, such as body weight or blood pressure in animals, as identified by statistical analysis. These traits are typically affected by more than one gene, and also by the environment. Recombinant congenic strain : a variation on recombinant inbred strains in which the initial outcross is followed by several generations of backcrossing before inbreeding. Retroviral interference : the phenomenon by which prior infection of cells with a retrovirus confers strong resistance to infection of the same cells by a retrovirus that utilizes the same receptor; however, cells remain susceptible to viruses that use a different receptor. This process results from masking or downregulation of the receptor due to interaction with the glycoprotein of the established virus.",

            "text": "An important element of resistance to retroviral infection is provided by endogenous retroviral elements. Some retroviral elements in the mammalian genome are transcriptionally active but carry deletions and point mutations that render them unable to replicate. Some of their gene products, such as the FV4 and FV1 proteins, interfere with infection by their exogenous relatives thus providing a selective advantage to their hosts. For example, Fv4 encodes an Env protein that interferes with ecotropic murine leukemia virus (MuLV) infection (see main text) at the level of viral entry. Examples of this phenomenon can be found in mice, chickens and cats, suggesting that Env-mediated retroviral interference is commonly used for limiting virus spread [76] . Gene therapy based on the principle of receptor interference has demonstrated that introduction of Fv4-Envtransduced bone marrow cells into a thymectomized host confers resistance to Friend leukemia virus-induced leukemogenesis [77] . These findings suggest that a similar approach could be used as a therapeutic strategy to inhibit infections by other retroviruses in vivo, including immunodeficiency virus. For example, transfer of a gene encoding a normally processed but fusion-defective retroviral Env protein into susceptible cells would interfere with viral entry and potentially reduce the infectiousness of viruses emerging from the cell.",

Because all retroviruses replicate in very similar ways, it is conceivable that similar restriction mechanisms could be found in humans. Interestingly, although an Fv1 ortholog was not detected in nonmurine species, a mechanism of preintegration interference, resistance factor 1 (REF1), has been demonstrated in human cell lines [82] . At the time of writing, the REF1 gene has not been cloned, but there is speculation that, like Fv1, REF1 might consist of endogenous retroviral sequences. A recent study suggests the existence of a REF1-like restriction in humans and nonhuman primates that determines lentivirus tropism [83] . Consistent with this proposal, the target for this restriction is within the capsid protein of HIV [83] .",

            "text": "An example of an alternative mechanism of resistance to retroviral infection is provided by Fv2, which determines the progression of Friend virus complex-induced erythroleukemia. Fv2 is identical to Ron, which encodes STK, a member of the MET family of receptor tyrosine kinases. Susceptible mice express a positive-acting truncated version of STK lacking most of the extracellular domain, which is associated with proliferation of SFFV-infected erythroblasts [84] . successful, because potent defense mechanisms act at the intracellular level. One of the initial cellular responses to viral infection is the production of type I INTERFERONS (IFNs). IFNs, in turn, stimulate the expression of several gene products, including the double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) and RNase L, which leads to the establishment of an antiviral state in cells, characterized by a general inhibition of protein synthesis. The IFN-induced MX1 protein is one of the best-studied determinants of innate immune responses to viral infection. The inbred mouse strain A2G is resistant to doses of mouse-adapted influenza virus (an orthomyxovirus) that are lethal for other inbred strains [13] . Resistance in these mice is determined by a single dominant locus, Mx1, whose gene product, MX1, rapidly accumulates in the nuclei of cells following influenza virus infection, and blocks virus spread [14] . Susceptible mice produce no functional MX protein due to either a nonsense mutation (CBA/J) or gene deletion (BALB/c) [15] . The Mx1 product belongs to the dynamin superfamily of large GTPases conserved in all vertebrates. In mice there are actually two Mx gene products, MX1 and MX2. MX1 protein blocks transcription of influenza virus, probably via interaction with the PB2 subunit of the influenza virus polymerase [16] . By contrast, the MX2 protein is cytoplasmic and has been shown to inhibit viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm, such as vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and members of the family Bunyaviridae [14] . MX proteins inhibit virus replication by interfering with the transport of viral nucleocapsids, and by sorting them to locations where they become unavailable for the generation of new virus particles [14] , possibly to promyelocytic leukemia protein nuclear bodies (PML NBs) [17] , which are known to be a site of proteasome-mediated degradation.",

Virus titers in the brains of resistant mice infected with Murray Valley encephalitis virus, yellow fever virus or West Nile virus are orders of magnitude lower than in susceptible animals. Viral yields in tissue cultured from resistant or susceptible animals are also dramatically different, indicating that the Flv gene product acts intracellularly on flavivirus replication [18] . Genetic mapping localized Flv1 to chromosome 5 [19] and, more recently, it was demonstrated that Flv susceptibility is associated with a nonsense mutation in a member of the 2 0 ,5 0 -oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS) family, Oas1b [20, 21] . OAS proteins are induced by IFNs and play a central role in producing the antiviral state by binding double-stranded RNA and catalyzing the synthesis of 2 0 ,5 0 -oligoadenylates (2-5A), which, in turn, interact with and activate RNase L to degrade singlestranded viral and cellular RNAs. Whereas Oas1b genes from resistant mice encode full-length proteins, those from susceptible mice encode proteins truncated at the C-terminus that might not form active synthetases. In contrast to the single OAS1 gene found in humans, there are eight closely linked Oas1 genes in the murine genome [20, 22] , but only Oas1b is associated with resistance to flaviviruses.",

Strains of the C57BL background carry a dominant resistance allele, Cmv1 r , that restricts viral replication in target organs, whereas other mouse strains carry a recessive susceptibility allele, Cmv1 s , that allows rapid proliferation of the virus [25] . Cmv1 r encodes an activating NK-cell receptor, Ly49H [26 -28] , which is absent in susceptible strains. Mouse strains express different repertoires of Ly49 molecules, which are part of a large family of polymorphic receptors expressed on overlapping populations of NK cells. Upon binding of MHC class I ligands, different Ly49 molecules deliver either activating or inhibitory signals that modulate NK-cell function [29] . Recent studies have revealed that Ly49H recognizes MCMV-infected cells via direct interaction with the viral antigen, m157, which shares structural homology with MHC class I molecules and is expressed on the surface of infected cells [30, 31] . m157 also binds to an inhibitory receptor, Ly49I, expressed in susceptible strain 129 mice, suggesting that m157 could have evolved as a mechanism to escape NK-cell killing by targeting inhibitory receptors [30] . In resistant mice, Ly49H might have evolved as a countermeasure against virus-encoded MHC class I homologs, providing an overriding activating signal to the NK cell, and promoting the elimination of MCMV-infected cells (Fig. 2a) . Considering the prevalence of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in the human population, we expect that there are likely to be HCMV-specific activating receptors present on human leukocytes that might function in a manner analogous to Ly49H.",

Innate immunity constitutes the first line of defense, providing a rapid response through germ-line encoded proteins that pre-exist or are induced within hours of infection. Adaptive immunity is a slower, yet highly specific response mediated by B cells and T cells that confers effective and long-lasting protection against infection, and is characterized by immunological memory. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules are highly polymorphic glycoproteins encoded by MHC class I and II genes, which are mainly involved in the presentation of peptide antigens to T cells. MHC class I molecules bind peptides derived from proteins synthesized in the cytosol, such as viral proteins, and present them to cytotoxic CD8 \u00fe T cells. By contrast, MHC class II molecules are loaded with peptides derived from exogenous antigens engulfed within intracellular vesicles, for presentation to CD4 \u00fe T cells. MHC class I molecules also play an important role in modulating the cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) cells.",

Inhibitory receptors interact with MHC class I molecules and prevent cell killing of healthy cells by autologous NK cells. In situations where MHC class I is downregulated, such as during tumorigenesis or viral infection, reduced inhibitory signals result in NK-cell-mediated lysis [85] .

Congenic mice with intra-MHC recombinations provide an important tool for dissecting the contribution of MHC class I subregions to virus infection. For example, comparisons of T-cell responses in H2 congenic mice that differ in their recovery from Friend leukemia virus infection were used to localize Friend leukemia virus resistance loci Rfv1 and Rfv2. Rfv1 mapped to the H2D subregion and determined T-cell activation. Rfv2 mapped to the IA subregion and determined unresponsiveness of T cells in a proliferation assay [35] . Resistance to acute lethal infection of MCMV is also controlled by genes linked to H2, with the k haplotype being more resistant than b or d. Resistance was associated with genes of subregions K/IA and D. Interestingly in this model, transfection of macrophages with sequences encoding MHC molecules such as H2-K d , D d or K b renders these cells, which are major reservoirs for MCMV, sensitive to MCMV infection [37] , consistent with a role for MHC molecules as MCMV receptors.",

The study of infectious disease under complex genetic control in humans is complicated by a variety of factors including genetic heterogeneity, low penetrance and environmental factors. The tools currently available to the mouse geneticist make the identification and isolation of disease susceptibility genes much more attainable. An example is the response to Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV), a rodent model for multiple sclerosis [52] . In genetically susceptible mice, certain TMEV strains cause persistent infection, inflammation, and a chronic demyelinating disease. One of the loci determining Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus persistence (Tmevp1), maps to the MHC region and corresponds to the H2D gene [52] . Mice transgenic for the H2D b allele acquired resistance to persistent virus infection, suggesting that the gene effect was at the level of peptide presentation by H2D b [53] . Using the amount of viral RNA in the spinal cords of persistently infected mice as a phenotype, and a genetic dissection strategy based on genome scans, a second locus, Tmevp2, was localized near the type II interferon (IFN-g) gene on distal chromosome 10 [54] . Analysis of a panel of congenic mice that inherited different portions of mouse chromosome 10 revealed that Tmevp2 was actually two distinct loci, now termed Tmevp2 and Tmevp3, and excluded the IFN-g gene from the candidate region [55] . Recently, a strong candidate for Tmevp3, named Tmevpg1, has been identified as a noncoding RNA expressed in immune cells infiltrating the central nervous system of resistant mice, where an inverse relationship with IFN-g mRNA levels has been observed [56] , suggesting a role for this RNA in regulating IFN-g synthesis. Consistent with this observation, the same reciprocal pattern of RNA expression was observed for TMEVPG1, the human counterpart, and IFN-g in human NK cells and T cells.",

Wild-derived inbred strains of mice are an important source of additional resistance alleles [63] that is just beginning to be exploited, as demonstrated by the characterization of Flv. Chemical mutagenesis, a method that has been successfully applied to the study of other model organisms, from bacteria to Drosophila, is another promising strategy for creating novel susceptibility alleles in the mouse. The alkylating agent N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) introduces point mutations and creates random variation throughout the genome [64] . This is highly advantageous for defining host susceptibility phenotypes because it represents an unbiased method for identifying previously unrecognized physiological pathways because no assumptions are made about the relevant genes.

Important questions to be answered include: (1) Do other activating NK-cell receptors have specialized functions in virus recognition? (2) Is the MHC class I fold a recognition-associated structure? (3) What is the extent of the repertoire of target molecules for NK-cell-activating receptors? In addition, studies of mouse NK-cell receptors, such as the Ly49 family, have provided a conceptual framework for understanding human NK-cell biology. Because no functional human Ly49 counterpart has been identified, prime candidates for the recognition of viral pathogens by human NK cells are members of the killercell immunoglobulin-like receptor (KIR) family [65] . Although the ligands of activating KIR receptors remain to be identified, it has been proposed that activating KIR molecules have evolved to recognize infectious agents (Fig. 2b) [32] .",

This idea is supported by experimental evidence derived from mouse models for initiation and exacerbation of atherosclerosis following MCMV infection [66] , for diabetes [67] or dilated cardiomyopathy [68] following coxsackievirus infection, and for multiple sclerosis-like disease following TMEV [33] or MHV [69] infection. Identifying genes that control susceptibility to acute and chronic viral infection in these models is a crucial step in understanding the development of these complex pathologies.",
