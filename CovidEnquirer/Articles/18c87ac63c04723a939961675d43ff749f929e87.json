Although several vaccine candidates have been developed, there is still no clinically available vaccine for MERS-CoV. In this study, we developed two types of MERS-CoV vaccines: a recombinant adenovirus serotype 5 encoding the MERS-CoV spike gene (Ad5/ MERS) and spike protein nanoparticles formulated with aluminum (alum) adjuvant. Next, we tested a heterologous prime-boost vaccine strategy, which compared priming with Ad5/MERS and boosting with spike protein nanoparticles and vice versa, with homologous prime-boost vaccination comprising priming and boosting with either spike protein nanoparticles or Ad5/MERS. Although both types of vaccine could induce specific immunoglobulin G against MERS-CoV, neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV were induced only by heterologous prime-boost immunization and homologous immunization with spike protein nanoparticles. Interestingly, Th1 cell activation was induced by immunization schedules including Ad5/MERS, but not by those including only spike protein nanoparticles. Heterologous primeboost vaccination regimens including Ad5/MERS elicited simultaneous Th1 and Th2 responses, but homologous prime-boost regimens did not. Thus, heterologous prime-boost may induce longer-lasting immune responses against MERS-CoV because of an appropriate balance of Th1/Th2 responses. However, both heterologous prime-boost and homologous spike protein nanoparticles vaccinations could provide protection from MERS-CoV challenge in mice. Our results demonstrate that heterologous immunization by priming with Ad5/MERS and boosting with spike protein nanoparticles could be an efficient prophylactic strategy against MERS-CoV infection.",

Previous studies have investigated viral vector-based vaccines [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] , subunit vaccines [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] , and DNA vaccines [18, 19] . Of these, vaccination using viral vectors or DNA immunization successfully generated neutralizing antibodies and protected against infection [12] . However, safety concerns about DNA vaccines and their weak induction of neutralizing antibodies plus the possibility of reduced efficacy of viral vector vaccines because of preexisting immunity against the viral vectors induced by repeated immunization cannot be ignored. Although protein subunit vaccines can induce neutralizing antibody, they usually elicit a lower level of cellular immune response which has close association with rapid viral clearance when infection occurs. In addition, subunit vaccines could not induce enough immune responses in host, resulting in failure to make long-term memory of antigen [20] .",

This could be because of the low titers of neutralizing antibody induced by Ad5/MERS [26, 27] . To overcome this problem of preexisting antibody, several approaches have been developed [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . One approach was to increase the dose of viral vector, but high-dose injection increased its cytotoxicity. Another approach was to change the surface antigen of the adenovirus vector used for booster immunizations to a rare serotype to evade the preexisting antibody [28] [29] [30] [31] . However, the concern with this strategy is the difficulty of mass production of two types of recombinant viruses, although packaging of the adenoviral vector with polymer [32, 33] and/or administration of adenovirus through other routes, such as mucosal or nasal inoculation, may circumvent this problem Mean changes in body weight \u00b1 standard deviation are shown.

(B) Histopathological examination of homologously or heterologously vaccinated mice (spike protein nanoparticles or Ad5/MERS-spike protein) and nonvaccinated controls (PBS and Ad5/GFP). Lungs were collected 5 days postinfection. (C) Hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections of lung were examined and scored by blinded observers (n = 3). Score 0: absence of lesions. Score 1: small or occasional subpleural foci. Score 2: thickened intraalveolar septa and subpleural fibrotic foci. Score 3: thickened continuous subpleural fibrous foci and intraalveolar septa [40] . Each group had n = 5 mice. [34, 35] . Furthermore, these methods are dependent on the experimental conditions or the researcher's skill. Therefore, to overcome this disadvantage but to take advantage of a viral vector vaccine, in this study we used a heterologous prime-boost vaccination strategy, in which Ad5/MERS was used for the first (priming) vaccination to activate the cellular immune response and then MERS spike protein nanoparticles was used for the second and third (first and second booster) vaccinations to activate the humoral immune response. As shown in Figs. 3 and 4 , this strategy induced both specific neutralizing antibody and Th1 cells against MERS spike protein, indicating that it could effectively trigger a cellular immune response by priming with Ad5/MERS and bypass the limitations of viral vectors by boosting with MERS spike protein nanoparticles.",

            "text": "A recent study analyzing patients who survived MERS virus infection demonstrated that survival depended on induction of both a cell-mediated immune response and neutralizing antibody [36] . The analysis showed a correlation between the severity of symptoms, the activation of T cells extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and the intensity of the antibody response. According to these data, patients with stronger activation of a MERS-specific CD8 + T cell response showed faster viral clearance and had relatively shorter exposure to the virus. In this regard, adenovirus vaccines, which are known to increase cellular immune responses via activation of CD8 + T cells [26, [37] [38] [39] , may be strategic candidates for a MERS vaccine. The results shown in Fig. 6 indicate that both the Ad5/MERS-spike protein group and the spike protein group were protected against MERS-CoV challenge, as indicated by smaller body weight loss and less severe lung pathology after MERS-CoV infection. However, the spike protein group did not induce a Th1 immune response, but rather a Th2 immune response including induction of neutralizing antibody. This imbalance of Th1/Th2 responses suggests that immunization with spike protein nanoparticles alone may provide short-term protection against virus infection but not long-term maintenance of a protective immune response.",

It has also been shown that the induction of allergic and biased Th2 immune responses and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the airways and lungs are the main characteristics of VERD in RSV-inactivated vaccines [42, 43] . Our heterologous prime-boost immunization strategy with Ad5/MERS and spike protein nanoparticle clearly showed a balanced induction of Th1 and Th2 immune responses. Therefore, this vaccine strategy may be safe. However, it requires more detailed study.",
