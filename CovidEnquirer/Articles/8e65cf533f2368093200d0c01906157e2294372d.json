Although most acute RTI are thought to be of viral origin, viral etiology is still unknown in a significant number of cases. Objectives: Multiplexed whole genome sequencing (WGS) was used for virome determination directly on clinical samples as proof of principle for the use of deep sequencing techniques in clinical diagnosis of viral infections. Study design: WGS was performed with nucleic acids from sputum and nasopharyngeal aspirates from four pediatric patients with known respiratory tract infections (two patients with human rhinovirus, one patient with human metapneumovirus and one patient with respiratory syncytial virus), and from four pediatric patients with PCR-negative RTI, and two control samples. Results: Viral infections detected by routine molecular diagnostic methods were confirmed by WGS; in addition, typing information of the different viruses was generated. In three out of four samples from pediatric patients with PCR-negative respiratory tract infections and the two control samples, no causative viral pathogens could be detected. In one sample from a patient with PCR-negative RTI, rhinovirus type-C was detected. Almost complete viral genomes could be assembled and in all cases virus species could be determined. Conclusions: Our study shows that, in a single run, viral pathogens can be detected and characterized, providing information for clinical assessment and epidemiological studies. We conclude that WGS is a powerful tool in clinical virology that delivers comprehensive information on the viral content of clinical samples.",

Respiratory tract infections in these young children are associated with high morbidity and mortality [2] . Over 65% of respiratory infections are caused by viruses [3] . In the last decades, improvement of molecular techniques has resulted in the discovery of new viruses. However, the viral etiology of RTI is still unknown in a significant number of cases [3] . Current diagnostic methods for virus detection are mainly based on molecular amplification techniques such as PCR, using large panels of the currently known pathogens and frequently detected viruses. Therefore, new viral pathogens might be missed. Moreover, it was estimated that more than 50 percent of the human virus species still await discovery [4] .",

Most enzymes like nucleases, proteases and polymerases are produced in recombinant-protein expression systems.

The use of these columns might introduce parvovirus-like sequences and provide false positive diagnostic results [19] and should be avoided in NGS based methods. Similar to current molecular diagnostic methods, WGS is sensitive to crosscontamination. Therefore, the same procedures used for prevention of cross contamination in assays like PCR should be applied to WGS. Extraction of relevant information from sequencing data requires proper software tools. In recent years, a number of research groups working in the fields of microbiology or bioinformatics developed programs for the processing of sequence-data [14, [20] [21] [22] . Processing pipelines have to be capable of processing millions of sequence reads. Pipelines based on NCBI Blast are time-consuming and therefore less suitable for first-pass analyses. In our study we used a rapid procedure based on the short-read sequence assembling program Bowtie2 [11] . Assembly of reads against a dataset of all known viruses was sufficient to extract all significant virological genomic data that match the diagnostic results of the PCR-positive samples. Implementation of this kind of pipelines in Python-scripts were recently published by several groups [20, 21] .
