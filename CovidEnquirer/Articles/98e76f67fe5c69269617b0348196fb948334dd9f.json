Many, but not all [12] , adenoviruses use the Coxsackieadenovirus receptor (CAR) for this [13, 14] , which is present on the cell surface. Integrins act as secondary receptors by binding to the viral penton-base protein. Subsequently, the virus is internalized by receptor-mediated endocytosis. The adenoviruses escape from the endocytic vesicles (or receptosomes) by virtue of a change in the configuration of the virion surface due to the low pH in these vesicles. As a consequence, the virus particles are released in the cytoplasm of the cell, where they are further degraded [15] , with the DNA ending up in the nucleus, where a complex with histone proteins is formed, which may attach to the nuclear matrix for replication [16] .",

The E4 ORF6 protein, either alone or in a complex w^ith the ElB 55-kDa protein, binds the cellular protein p53, thereby blocking its potential to activate the transcription of tumor-suppressing genes [26, 27] .",

The El deletion renders the recombinant virus replication-defective, which is a prerequisite for most of the clinical applications. In order to be able to produce El-deleted recombinant adenoviral vectors, complementing cell lines have to be used that express the El proteins of adenovirus. One of the main challenges here is to express sufficient levels of the El protein to achieve this. However, adenovirus El proteins, and in particular ElA proteins, are very toxic to cells. ElA has a profound effect on the transcription of many cellular genes, which leads to alteration of the morphology and growth of the cells and may lead to apoptosis.",

It is not known whether cells that express ElA only are able to complement adenoviral vectors that are deleted for both ElA and ElB. Attempts have also been made to express El proteins in established cell lines such as A549. Growth of established cells is not dependent on El expression and the toxicity of El proteins made it difficult to isolate clones that show stable expression of the El proteins, although a few papers report encouraging results [46, 55, 56] . To the best of our knowledge, there is limited use of such cells and therefore this chapter will deal mainly with the group of El-expressing cells that use the transforming capacity of the adenoviral El genes.",

This cell line was generated in Leiden in the group of Prof. Van der Eb, by transfection of El sequences of adenovirus type 5 into primary human embryonic kidney cells [41] . The aim of this experiment was to study the transforming potential of adenoviral El sequences, and the DNA used for it was sheared adenoviral DNA [41] . Precise mapping of the adenoviral sequences present in this cell line indicated that the cell line had integrated bases 1-4137 of the adenoviral DNA [57] . Adenoviral vectors carry a deletion in the El region that runs from approximately nt 400 to nt 3500 of the adenoviral genome. This means that there is a substantial sequence overlap between the El sequences present in the cell line and the adenoviral vector DNA (see Fig. 2 ). This sequence overlap may result in homologous recombination between the sequences. Due to a double crossover, the El region present in the cellular chromosome may end up into the El-deleted adenoviral vector [58] (Fig. 2 ). The resulting virus is El-positive and therefore capable of replicating independently in cells that do not contain El sequences in the chromosome. Several reports have described the occurrence of RCA in adenoviral vector batches produced on 293 cells [46, 55^ 58-60] .",

A master virus seed (MVS), prepared from passage 12, w^as used to generate 8 virus-production lots (passage 13). The unprocessed virus harvest (vector-infected suspension culture) of the MVS and the virus-production lots w^ere tested for RCA. In brief, test articles were frozen and thawed and then assayed by inoculation onto the humanlung-carcinoma (A549, ATCC CCL 185) cell line for approximately 1-2 h at 37\u00b0C, after which the inoculum was removed and the culture was refed with medium. Cultures were passaged three times to amplify any putative RCA present, with incubation times ranging from 4 to 7 days for the early passages and 2 to 5 days for the final passage. The cultures were examined for cytopathic effects at each passage. The virus-production scale was approximately 20 L and a 60 mL volume (diluted to 600 mL to avoid toxicity and interference with detection of RCA) was tested for RCA for each lot. The testing volume was selected on the basis of a worst-case calculation to ensure the testing of at least three dose equivalents of virus. Earlier virusproduction studies suggested that the freeze-thaw extract would contain at least 5 X 10^ particles/mL (or 10^^ particles/20 mL). Thus, at least 3 x 10^^ Ad5 particles (three dose equivalents) would be tested. Assuming a random (Poisson) distribution of RCA, if there were an average of one RCA per 1 X 10^^ particles (20 mL), one would predict the probability of not detecting it by testing only 1 x 10^^ particles to be = e~^ or 0.3679 (36.79% chance). By testing 3 x 10^^ particles (60 mL), the (binomial) probability of not detecting 1 RCA/1 X 10^1 particles is reduced to = ^'^ or 0.04979 (4.98% chance). Mathematically, this is equivalent to three independent tests of 20 mL each (60 mL total).",

Using the ratio of particle/TCID50 determined for purified virus (15.6 particles/infectious units), the virus-production lots were estimated to have an average of 1.9 x 10^^ particles/mL. It was estimated that the mean probability of not detecting at least one RCA in a dose of 10^^ particles of virus-production lots was 0.000887%. Besides having directly tested the infected cell suspension of the MVS for RCA, the repeated inability to detect RCA in the various clinical batches bodes well for the RCA-free nature of the MVS. For the clinical production runs, 1 mL of MVS is used to inoculate each of 100 roller bottles (RBs). This means a total of 800 mL of MVS have been used for these \"clinical lots.\" Following the same calculation scheme as above, if there were one RCA per 20 mL of the MVS, there would be ^\"^^^ or 0.00674 probability (0.674% chance) of not transmitting an RCA when preparing a single clinical batch. Moreover, cumulatively across the eight clinical production runs, there would be only (e'^^'^f or a 4.25 x 10-^^ probability (4.25 x 10\"^^%) chance of not transmitting RCA in the preparation of eight lots. In conclusion, the 60-mL freeze-thaw sample used for RCA testing provided adequate assurance for the detection of RCA in virus-production lots, at a level of one RCA for a 10^^ dose. How^ever, for testing of future Ad5 vector lots, we plan to use a clarified lysate. In this case, the probability estimated for detection of RCA w^ill be based on more direct measurement of virus concentration.",

To take full advantage of high-density cultures the virus replication should last longer than 3 days to enable the utilization of all cells present because a repeated infection can occur with newly released particles from lysed cells. A typical example of a 20-L bioreactor run is presented in Fig. 7 . Because a large part of the total produced virus will be in suspension, the volume of such a culture is too large to enable purification by ultracentrifugation. Hollow-fiber ultrafiltration and chromatography are methods of choice for virus isolation and purification. With these systems directly connected to the bioreactor, thereby ensuring a closed system, all virus can be isolated from the culture medium. After capture of the virus, the bulk product can be further purified utilizing ion exchange chromatography and/or size exclusion chromatography systems. The obtained product is of high purity and infectivity. Final formulation can be done by ultrafiltration, bringing the product to the final concentration in the required buffer. Similar yields of El-deleted adenoviral vectors obtained on PER.C6 have been obtained by others [74] .",

            "text": "The estimated scale of the required bioreactor and cell-line stability is calculated as follows. The cell density used for virus production in perfusion mode is 3-6 x 10^ cell/mL. Therefore, assuming at least 20,000 virus particles per cell yield, the overall expected yield in the crude bioreactor harvest is 2 x 10\"^ vp/cell X 5 X 10^ cell/mL = 1 x 10^^ vp/mL. Further, after optimization. maximum expected loss of virus particles after downstream processing (DSP) by column chromatography is 75%, Therefore, from a 20-L perfusion bioreactor 1 X 10^^ vp/mL X 0.25 (recovery) x 10\"^ mL = 5 x 10^\"^ vp can be obtained. This gives 5 x 10^\"^ vp/1 x 10^^ vp/dose = 50,000 doses (assuming 1 x 10^^ vp/dose). When during product development 40% of the batch is retained for QC and archiving purposes 3000 patients can receive 50,000 x 0.6/3000 = 10 doses each. Therefore, using the currently developed technology, this 20-L bioreactor is sufficient for the generation of material for the first clinical studies. However, to be able to do process development on a larger scale, needed for full commercial production, a larger vessel is required. Full production scale is expected to be about five times larger, and therefore a 100-L bioreactor is expected to be the maximum volume required for application with single doses up to 10^^ vp. To propagate the cells from a working cell bank ampoule, containing 5^ cells, to a 5E6 cell/mL culture in a 100-L bioreactor would take 17 cell doubhngs. So a reliable production process would require a cell line which is at least stable over 20 cell doublings. PER.C6 was shown to be stable with respect to El expression for at least 98 cell doublings.",

The DNA preparation was shown to be of high molecular weight (average size ~100 kb) and devoid of significant protein or RNA impurities.

None of the mice in this study exhibited gross or microscopic evidence of tumors at the injection site. One treated mouse had a lymphoma at a distant site. However, nude mice -particularly females -are known to have a high incidence of spontaneous lymphoma [75] [76] [77] [78] , and the occurrence of a single lymphoma in 20 treated mice is consistent with the spontaneous incidence. Although the lymphoma was almost certainly a spontaneous event, a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) study was performed on the lymphoma DNA to determine if there was any evidence for the presence of the adenovirus El region -the transforming agent of PER.C6 cells. The study was negative, with a sensitivity of approximately one copy of El per 750 tumor cells. Previously, El expression has been shown to be necessary to maintain the transformed state of 293 cells, which, like PER.C6 cells, were transformed by El [79] . The results of the PCR analysis support the conclusion that the lymphoma was a spontaneous event, not induced by PER.C6 DNA.",

The negative results obtained with PER.C6 DNA in nude mice and newborn hamsters are consistent with these findings. In the case of the PER.C6 studies, the amount of DNA injected (~100 or 225 | JLg) represents a > 10^-fold excess compared to the amount of residual DNA present in a dose of vaccine produced on this cell substrate. Others have calculated that 100 pg of residual DNA from tumorigenic cells would be equal to less than a billionth of a tumor-producing dose [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] [87] .",

            "text": "Human prion diseases occur in sporadic, acquired or inherited forms with different clinical and pathological phenotypes (reviewed in [91] ). In 1996 a new variant of CJD (vCJD) was reported in the United Kingdom in relatively young patients with clinical features different from the known CJD forms [92] . It was also found by strain typing that the prion protein of these patients was indistinguishable from the one that causes BSE, thus raising the question whether vCJD could be acquired by consumption of meat from cattle suffering from BSE [93, 94] . The possibility of transmission of PrP^^ from bovine to human raises safety issues for cultured cell lines used for the production of human drugs. Therefore, PER.C6 cells were carefully examined for the PrP phenotype (see below) as well as genotype. It has been found that specific mutations in the PrP gene are associated with hereditary forms of human prion disease (reviewed in [89] and [91] ). Furthermore, a common methionine/valine polymorphism at codon 129 of the PrP gene appears to be associated with phenotypic variability and susceptibility to sporadic and iatrogenic CJD. The vast majority of patients suffering from sCJD and also from vCJD were found to be homozygous for 129 M, whereas patients heterozygous at codon 129 were strikingly underrepresented [95] [96] [97] . To examine whether the PER.C6 PrP gene contains any of the known mutations associated with susceptibility to prion diseases, the PER.C6 PrP gene was sequenced. For these sequencing studies, genomic DNA from PER.C6 cells was isolated, and used to amplify the PrP gene sequences by PCR. The resulting PCR product was cloned into a vector, and the PrP gene in each of 13 PrP-containing clones was sequenced by BaseClear (Leiden, The Netherlands). Five of these clones contained sequences coding for the 129 Methionine PrP^ protein, while the other eight contained the 129 Valine PrP^ sequence, demonstrating the heterozygosity at this position. To confirm this observation, the resulting PCR product was also sequenced. As expected, a double peak (g/a) was observed in the 129 codon at a position defining it as a valine (if the nucleotide is a guanine) or as methionine (if the nucleotide is an adenine). The PER.C6 PrP gene sequence was then compared to the wild-type sequence published in GenBank (Accession No. M12899) and was found to be identical to the wild type gene; thus, ruling out the possibility that these cells possessed a hereditary mutation that would be predisposing for prion diseases. The sequence also revealed that PER.C6 cells are heterozygous for methionine/valine at codon 129.",
