This study aimed to assess the knowledge and attitudes of Jordanian physicians toward public health surveillance of communicable disease. A cross-sectional study was conducted among resident doctors who were working in 4 main Ministry of Health hospitals and 2 teaching hospitals in Jordan in September 2017. A self-administered paper-based questionnaire was used to collect the data. The questionnaire collected information about sociodemographic and practicerelated characteristics of physicians and included items to assess their knowledge of surveillance and reporting practices. This study included 223 physicians (152 males and 71 females). About 60.1% of the residents were graduates from medical schools in Jordan and the remaining (39.9%) were graduates from medical schools in other countries. Approximately two thirds of residents (62.3%) were doing their residency in Ministry of Health hospitals and the rest (37.7%) in 2 teaching hospitals. Only 44.8% of physicians had defined surveillance correctly. Only 27.4% of physicians had been educated or trained on surveillance. About 39.5% of physicians had filled at least one report form during their practice. The main reasons for not reporting mandatory diseases were high workload (49.8%) and being not trained on reporting diseases (46.6%). A relatively high percentage of physicians have insufficient knowledge of surveillance and reporting of notifiable communicable diseases. Training of physicians on surveillance and diseases notification is highly needed. The practice of disease notification should be enforced in Jordanian hospitals.",

            "text": "This study revealed unexpected findings about the attitudes and practices of Jordanian physicians regarding surveillance and reporting communicable diseases. This study showed that Jordanian physicians in residency programs have poor knowledge regarding notifiable disease reporting. This finding is in agreement with the findings of other studies in South Africa, 9 the Syrian Arab Republic, 16 Taiwan, 17 Canada, 18 Nigeria, 19 and Madrid. 12 This study identified gaps in the awareness of physicians from 2 major health sectors in Jordan, MoH and university hospitals. This finding is explained by that undergraduate and graduate curricula in medical schools in Jordan do not cover surveillance and its importance. Moreover, hospitals' training programs do not stress on disease notification. This underscores the need to provide physicians with proper training on surveillance and repeatedly inform physicians about the notifiable disease under surveillance. Such training has been shown to improve the awareness and practice in New South Wales 20 and Washington. 13 To assess the physicians' practices of reporting communicable diseases, the most common notifiable diseases/conditions, according to the list of the MOH, were presented to physicians and were asked to determine whether they had ever filled the notification forms for these diseases. Among all physicians who diagnosed at least one communicable disease under surveillance during their practice, only 39.5% of them had filled a notification form. A similar level of underreporting in other studies proposes a need of knowledge of the study of disease transmission of a few notifiable infections. Consequently, this may cast question on the esteem of the notification process and illness surveillance framework. Feedback to doctors showing that preventive action is taken as a result of their notifications may be the most effective way to improve notification practices. 9 The most common reasons for not reporting notifiable diseases were work overload among MOH physicians and not being trained on reporting diseases among universities' hospitals physicians. Similarly, these reasons had been reported by physicians in other countries. 12, 13, 21 One study reported that physicians did not know where to obtain a notification form and\\or did not know whom to notify. 19 While other studies identified the reporting process, which is too time consuming, difficult access to the local public health unit, and poor knowledge of the legal requirements for notifiable disease reporting as major barriers to notifiable disease reporting. 12, 21 Despite varying experiences, the ability of physicians to diagnose the notifiable disease and report correctly according to the reporting list varied from 81.2% for meningococcal meningitis cases to 22.4% of suspected measles. This finding is consistent with findings of similar study among junior doctors in accident and emergency departments in Ireland. 22 They recommended that it would be helpful to have a poster in the emergency departments listing the notifiable diseases and the telephone number of the local public health authority and to encourage accurate reporting. 14 According to the participants, reporting rates could be enhanced through simple approaches, including a short, simple, readily intelligible, and accessible reporting form for physicians. Implementing workshops emphasizing the importance of and the process for notifiable disease surveillance in undergraduate and postgraduate medical education also would be valuable, as would including other health care workers in assistant physicians in their reporting task. Institutional computerized reporting systems and feedback to physicians also may help improve reporting rates. 17 This study has some limitations. First, health services providers in private sector were not included in the study. Therefore, the generalizability of study findings is potentially limited and the study findings can be generalized only to MoH and teaching hospitals' physicians. Another limitation is the low response rate.",

There should be regular awareness, information, education, and communication programs concerning NPHSS and its importance to the public and for health care facility workers on a regular basis. This will help them appreciate the importance of the system and thus improve their general attitude toward it. Moreover, undergraduate and postgraduate health professionals programs should be restructured to include surveillance education and training. Knowledge and incentive, eliminating barriers to disease reporting, and promoting some assisting factors could help reduce the underreporting of notifiable diseases. Further comprehensive studies that include all health care providers in all heath sectors of Jordan are recommended. Such studies might be valuable to provide baseline data for future evaluation of the new reporting system in Jordan.",
