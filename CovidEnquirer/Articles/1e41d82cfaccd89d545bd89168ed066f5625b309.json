Workup for altered mental status revealed an elevated ammonia level of 306 umol/L without evidence of liver dysfunction. Ultrasound imaging confirmed a normal appearing liver. She was started on broad-spectrum antimicrobials and lactulose, but quickly required intubation for airway protection and was transferred to the ICU. Despite an aggressive regimen of lactulose every hour, her ammonia level increased to 642 umol/L. There was no underlying heavy metal exposure, and drug screens (including valproic acid) were unrevealing. Her urine culture and bronchoalveolar lavage grew Klebsiella, suspected to be the cause of such refractory and severe hyperammonemia. Dialysis was initiated in an attempt to clear the ammonia, which decreased to as low as 206 umol/L but did not normalize. Intravenous carnitine was tried without any improvement. Brain imaging demonstrated progressive cerebral edema eventually leading to uncal herniation and brain death. Neurosurgical intervention was not attempted due to refusal from family.",
