As the largest known RNA viruses, CoVs are further divided into four genera: alpha-coronavirus, betacoronavirus, gamma-coronavirus and delta-coronavirus [2] . To date, there have six human coronaviruses (HCoVs) been identified, including the alpha-CoVs HCoVs-NL63 and HCoVs-229E and the beta-CoVs HCoVs-OC43, HCoVs-HKU1, severe acute respiratory syndrome-CoV (SARS-CoV) [3] , and Middle East respiratory syndrome-CoV (MERS-CoV) [4] . New coronaviruses appear to emerge periodically in humans, mainly due to the high prevalence and wide distribution of coronaviruses, the large genetic diversity and frequent recombination of their genomes, and the increasing of the human-animal interface activities [5, 6] . In late December 2019, a number of local health authorities reported clusters of patients with pneumonia of unknown cause, which were epidemiologically linked to a seafood market in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China [5] The pathogen, a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), was identified by local hospitals using a surveillance mechanism for \"pneumonia of unknown etiology\" that was established in the wake of the 2003 SARS outbreak with the aim of allowing timely identification of novel pathogens [5, 7] . On 30 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that CoVID-19 is a \"public-health emergency of international concern\" [8] . The pandemic is escalating rapidly. We searched the associated literature in CoVID-19 to summarize the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, diagnosis and treatments and preventions of the infection of SARS-CoV-2.",

It has been confirmed to be an acute respiratory infection caused by a novel coronavirus. So far, this disease has rapidly spread from Wuhan to China's other areas, and 66 countries. And then, clustered cases and confirmed cases without a history of travel to Wuhan emerged as the advancing of this disease [9] . In addition, confirmed cases without clear exposure to the seafood market of Wuhan have been spread in many foreign countries [10] . According to National Health Commission of the People`s Republic of China, as of 24:00 on March 2, 2020, a total of 80, 302 CoVID-19 cases in China have been confirmed in 31 provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities), and Xinjiang Production and Construction Crops\uff0c including Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan, including 2947 (3.66%) deaths. At present, there are 30, 095 confirmed cases (6, 806 severe cases), 47, 260 (58.85%) discharged cases, and 587 suspected cases were recorded. It is worth mentioning that up to now, Tibet and Qinghai provinces have no new coronavirus infected patients [11] . As of 11 February, a total of 1,715 medical workers had been infected, of which 5 had died, with a crude case fatality rate of 0.3%. The number of confirmed cases has surpassed SARS in 2003. Internationally, confirmed cases have been reported in 66 countries and 6 continents and another Diamond Princess. Outside of China, a total of 10415 cases of CoVID-19 have been reported from 66 countries, with 168 deaths. The epidemics in the Republic of Korea, Italy, Iran and Japan have been became the greatest concern of WHO [12] . According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) [13] , the latest daily risk assessment on COVID-19, March 2, they ECDC have now considered the risk moderate to high level. The case fatality rate of the currently reported cases in China is less than 4%, which implies that so far, this novel coronavirus does not seem to cause the high fatality rates previously observed for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, 10% and 37%, respectively [14] . According to the latest data, a total of 36167 cases were reported in Hubei, China, that gives a cumulated attack rate (CAA) of 0.11% (the permanent resident population of Hubei is about 59, 170, 000). However, when compared to the influenza virus of pH1N1, which shared the same transmission route, have a 50 times higher CAA, this data showed the importance of the intense quarantine and social distancing measures the Huibei government have taken.",

SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the family coronaviruses, which is the beta-CoV with over 70% similarity in genetic sequence to SRAS-nCoV [16] . Like SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and many other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 likely originated in bats, but it requires further confirmation whether pneumonia infected by the SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted directly from bats or through an intermediate host [9, 17, 18] .Recent research has found that the virus is 96% identical at the whole-genome level to a bat coronavirus, which means bats is the most possible host of the SARS-CoV-2 [17, 18] . Also, Ji and colleagues [19] demonstrated that snack as possible virus reservoir for human infection. And Zhu et al [16] indicated that bats and minks maybe the two potential hosts of the novel coronavirus, while the minks may be the intermediate hosts of this virus. Subsequently, studies have shown that pangolins are potential intermediate hosts, but in general, intermediate hosts may have multiple hosts [20] . For many viruses, one of the key steps in the emergence process is the jump from animals to humans. Thus, identifying the source of the virus will help control its spread [18] .",

            "text": "Chan and his colleagues [21] reported a case of five patients in a family cluster, which confirmed Person-to-person transmission of CoVID-19. Health officials have identified evidence of transmission along a chain of 4 \"generations\" (a person who originally contracted the virus from a nonhuman source infected someone else, who infected another individual, who then infected another individual), suggesting sustained human-to-human transmission [22, 23] . Up to present, the main infection source was the patients who with pneumonia infected by the SARS-CoV-2. Respiratory droplet transmission is the main route of transmission, and it can also be transmitted through aerial droplets and contact [9] . However, we also should attach importance to asymptomatic cases which may play a critical role in the transmission process [24] . Recently, new coronavirus was detected in the feces of confirmed patients in Wuhan, Shenzhen and even the first case in the United States, indicating that the virus can replicate in the digestive tract and exist, suggesting the possibility of fecal-oral transmission [25] , but it is not certain that eating virus-contaminated food causes infection and transmission. There were also views that viruses in feces may be re-transmitted by aerosol formation of virus-containing droplets, requiring further investigation. At present, there is no evidence for aerosol transmission of CoVID-19. WHO also believes that further evidence is needed to assess the possibility of aerosol transmission [23] . In addition, it has been reported that the mother was diagnosed with a new type of coronavirus pneumonia, and the newborn was positive for viral nucleic acid in pharynx swabs after 30 hours of birth [26] , suggesting that the new type of coronavirus may cause neonatal infection through mother-to-child transmission, which of course needs to be confirmed by more scientific studies [27] . WHO has published their estimation of R0 to be 2.0-2.5 using early information [28] . Li et al. [7] analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan and found that the R0 to be 2.2, without specifying their modelling method Jonathan Read and his colleagues [16] from Lancaster University who used a deterministic Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) metapopulation transmission model to determine the R0 to be around 3.1. Majumder and his colleagues [29] used Incidence Decay and Exponential Adjustment (IDEA) model to estimate the R0 to be 2.0-3.3 (The study did not published yet, available at SSRN). Recently, a large group of researchers from multiple institutes led by Jianhong Wu from York University [30] proposed a more general J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f deterministic SEIR compartmental model using more parameters, and arrived at a much higher R0 number of 6.47. A recent research [31] on the Diamond Princess cruise ship outbreak, at a loosen intervention and quarantine condition, showed the R0 was 2.28, and if reduce the R0 by 25% and 50%, the estimated cumulative cases would be reduce from 1514 to 1081 and 758, also proved that intense quarantine and social distancing measures should be taken to control the outbreak. While Estimates from the SARS-CoV outbreak in 2003 reported an R0 of 3 [32] , which means SRAS-CoV-2 has a similar ability to spread as SRAS-CoV, or higher spreading ability than SRAS-CoV, so that the SARS-COV-2 outbreak caused more than 90000 cases in 66 countries all over the world in less than 2 months, that's times of the SARS-COV outbreak [33, 34] .",

In addition, it should be distinguished from non-infectious diseases, such as vasculitis, dermatomyositis, and organizing pneumonia [9] . So, laboratory diagnosis is necessary. Identification of CoVID-19 mainly includes virus isolation and viral nucleic acid detection. According to the traditional Koch`s postulates, virus isolation is the \"gold standard\" for virus diagnosis in the laboratory [47] A variety of specimens (such as swabs, nasal swabs, nasopharynx or trachea extracts, sputum or lung tissue, blood and feces) should be retained for testing in timely manner, which gives a higher rate of positive detection of lower respiratory tract specimens [47] . Viral nucleic acids can also be used for early diagnosis, which is the most important thing. So, we should detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid: accurate RNA detection of SARS-CoV-2 is with diagnostic value [47] . The full gene sequence of SARS-CoV-2 has now been obtained and samples can be collected from the upper respiratory tract (oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal) and lower respiratory tract (endotracheal aspirate, expectorated sputum, or bronchoalveolar lavage) of patients suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection for diagnosis by real time RT-PCR method [48] Also, in the early stage of the disease, the total number of leukocytes decreased or keeps normal, with decreased lymphocyte count or increased or normal monocytes also indicated the diagnosis of CoVID-19 [9] .",

WHO has announced that a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 should be available in 18 months, but achieving this will require funding and public interest to be maintained even if the threat level falls [49] . The mainstay of clinical management is largely symptomatic treatment, with organ support in intensive care for seriously ill patients [50] . The general strategies include bed rest and supportive treatment, including antiviral therapy [51] , antibioics application, immunomodulating therapy [52] , organ function support, respiratory support, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), blood purification and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) [53] . Novel coronavirus infection is a new communicable disease with an emergent outbreak that affects all populations [54] . SARS-CoV-2 infection has been classified as category B infectious disease legally but managed as category A infectious disease by Chinese government. It is paramount to implement infection control practices by infection source controlling, transmission route blocking, and susceptible population protection. The unprecedented flurry of activity by WHO and other global public health bodies has mainly focused on preventing transmission, infection control measures, and screening of travelers [50] .",

What is the source of the virus? And how can it spread around the world in such a short time? At the moment, we know relatively little about CoVID-19, except that it is a highly pathogenic human pathogen, possibly a zoonotic agent. Now that a pandemic has occurred, it is critical that countries around the world take steps to stop transmission and save lives. In addition, J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f we should actively study its origin, tropism, and pathogenesis with the aim of providing some guidance in dealing with this rapidly spreading epidemic. Challenges remain in several key areas, including the recent cases of people who have tested positive for the virus. Can these cured patients be transmitted to others? All these suggest that we should develop more detailed criteria for the prevention and control of the virus, and more stringent criteria for discharge of patients after treatment.",
