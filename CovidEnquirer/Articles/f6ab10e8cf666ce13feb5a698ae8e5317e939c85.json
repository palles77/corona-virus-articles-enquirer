Nine herds with poor performance and diarrhoea among growing pigs were selected on the basis of their piglet mean age at a body weight of 25 kg, compared to the overall mean age in Swedish herds. In addition, four herds with good average performance and no problems with diarrhoea were selected. Pigs were necropsied and samples for histology and microbiology were collected. Based on the necropsy findings, the pigs from the good performing herds were all judged to be healthy. The presence of Brachyspira pilosicoli and Lawsonia intracellularis was significantly correlated to poor performing herds and the results indicate that these microbes are main pathogens involved in enteric diseases among Swedish grower pigs. In addition, concomitant infections with other presumptive pathogens were commonly found.",

Less attention has been paid to enteric diseases in young growing pigs that have passed the critical period of weaning (i.e., 8-13 weeks old), but diseases referred to as ''grower scour'' or ''colitis'' constitute an important problem in many herds (Taylor, 1987; Thomson et al., 1998) .",

            "text": "Generally, studies on enteric disease have focused on a specific pathogen (Reed et al., 1986 , Fellstr\u20ac o om et al., 1996 . Several agents have been suggested as possible causes of diarrhoea in growing pigs, namely Brachyspira spp. (Taylor et al., 1980) , Campylobacter spp. (Lawson and McOrist, 1993) , Clostridium perfringens type A (Jestin et al., 1985) , enterotoxic strains of Escherichia coli (Svensmark et al., 1989) , Lawsonia intracellularis (McOrist et al., 1995) , Salmonella spp. (Reed et al., 1986) , Yersinia spp. (Taylor, 1999) , coronavirus (Pritchard, 1987) , rotavirus (Lecce et al., 1982) , Isospora suis (Nilsson, 1988) and Trichuris suis (Batte et al., 1977) . However, the importance and involvement of some of these organisms in clinical disease still remains to be clarified. It is often possible to relate a certain microbe to characteristic pathological lesions in the gut. For instance, the lesions caused by L. intracellularis are mainly located in the small intestines (McOrist et al., 1995) , while lesions due to Brachyspira spp. are observed in the large intestines (Moxley and Duhamel, 1999; Taylor et al., 1980) . B. hyodysenteriae causes necrosis in the intestinal mucosa, with mucohaemorrhagic exudate (Wilcock and Olander, 1979) , whereas B. pilosicoli causes less prominent changes, with oedema and the development of a false brush border (Trott et al., 1996a) . Few surveys have been conducted on the relationship be- (Johnston et al., 2001; M\u20ac o oller et al., 1998) or pathological lesions in the intestines (Jensen, 1995; Thomson et al., 1998) .",

Except for L. intracellularis, the microbiological findings were similar in the diarrhoeic and apparently healthy pigs from the poor performance herds. Demonstration of B. pilosicoli and L. intracellularis was significantly correlated to poor performance herds and compatible with the pathological lesions in the intestines (Lomax and Glocke, 1982; Trott et al., 1996b) . This is in agreement with earlier studies showing that L. intracellularis and B. pilosicoli are the most commonly found pathogens in growing pigs (M\u20ac o oller et al., 1998; Thomson et al., 1998) . These authors also report a frequent finding of concomitant infections with two or more pathogens, which is in conformity with our results. However, in the present study a concomitant infection with B. pilosicoli and L. intracellularis was found only in the case pigs. Thus, the risk of developing clinical disease might increase if both pathogens are present, since the damage in the intestines will probably be more extended. The extent of intestinal damage seems to be closely related to the clinical symptoms, since 78% of the case pigs but only 18% of the ''poor controls'' had gross lesions, despite the fact that most pigs had microscopic lesions in the intestines ( Table 2) .",

            "text": "The apparent significant finding (p 6 0:01) of C. coli in healthy pigs is probably caused by the absence of other Campylobacter spp. in the culture (NMKL, 1990) . C. coli is often found in pigs irrespective of their clinical health status and is considered non-pathogenic to pigs (Lawson and McOrist, 1993) . C. jejuni, Cl. perfringens type A, Y. enterocolitica, B. pilosicoli, L. intracellularis and/or pathogenic E. coli were identified in 49 of the 54 pigs from the poor performance herds. Except for B. pilosicoli and L. intracellularis, no correlation was found between the findings of these bacteria and the clinical symptoms. However, only one case of pathogenic E. coli and two cases of Cl. perfringens were found in the conventionally reared, good performance herds. It is possible that feed compounds, inadequate biosecurity, hygienic or other factors in a herd may facilitate the transmission, survival and growth of some enteropathogenic bacteria (Bertschinger et al., 1978 (Bertschinger et al., ,1979 Skjerve et al., 1998; Wathes et al., 1989) . The increased number of potentially pathogenic species results in an increased risk of clinical enteric disease (L\u20ac o ofstedt et al., 2000) . Thus, one or several risk factors may be present in the poor performance herds. Alternatively, the enteric diseases per se may alter the ecological balance of the gut flora or change the environmental conditions in the gut, which would favour some bacteria (Katouli et al., 1999; K\u20ac u uhn et al., 1995) . Pathogenic strains of E. coli was found in four out of six samples from two of the Table 3 The microbial findings in pigs from herds with diarrhoeic problems in growing pigs and poor average performance, and in pigs from herds without any such problems and good average performance Animals *** poor performance herds. Both these herds had a case history of previous problems with post-weaning diarrhoea. As discussed above, this might indicate that these herds suffer from a high pathogen load, or that the postweaning diarrhoea might predispose to outbreaks of other enteric diseases.",

Several methods have been developed for the study of the gut flora, such as measurement of the diversity of the enteric coliform flora (K\u20ac u uhn et al., 1995) , measurement of enzymatic activities (Microflora-associated characteristics, MAC) (Midtvedt, 1999) , or determination of terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism profiles, i.e., T-RFLP profiles (Leser et al., 2000) . Additionally, the presence of some of the microorganisms discussed above might serve as an indication of a disturbance. The applicability of these methods needs to be further evaluated. Measurement of the phenotypic diversity of the coliform flora is a useful marker in studies of postweaning diarrhoea (Katouli et al., 1999; Melin et al., 2000) . However, the results of the present study indicate that the coliform flora remains stable during the course of diarrhoea in growing pigs.",

It might be suspected that if an animal harbours a large number of these bacteria at slaughter, the risk of contamination of the carcass will increase (Asplund et al., 1998; Nesbakken and Skjerve, 1996) . However, our study has focused on enteric diseases in grower pigs and it is not known whether our findings will be applicable to finisher/ slaughter pigs. In a Norwegian study, the prevalence of Y. enterocolitica in slaughter pigs differed between herds with different production systems (Skjerve et al., 1998) . Interestingly, in the present study two case pigs and one control pig from the same herd showed an abundant growth of Y. enterocolitica.",
