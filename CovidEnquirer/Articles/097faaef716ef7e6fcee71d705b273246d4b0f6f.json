About 30-50% of acute LRTIs are viral in origin; of these, influenza and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are associated with the greatest disease burden in humans. The emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus in 2003, and the ensuing worldwide epidemic, highlights the fact that respiratory viral infections in humans may originate in animals. Many different influenza A viruses occur naturally in animal reservoirs, and present a constant threat of zoonotic infections and global pandemics.",

This occurs regularly in aquatic birds, in which almost all combinations of influenza A virus segments can be detected, but is less common in mammals. It was previously thought that, for a novel subtype of influenza to arise in humans, reassortment of two virus subtypes had to occur in a mammal that could then transmit to humans. The pig was considered a suitable 'intermediate host', because both avian and human viruses, which differ slightly in their surface receptor requirements, can replicate in pigs. However, following transmission of H5N1 directly from birds to humans on 18 occasions Figure 5 ), it is evident that cross-species barriers to transmission may be less stringent than was thought. Nevertheless, the requirements for adaptation of avian viruses to mammals are poorly understood. Cross-species transmission of novel subtypes into susceptible human populations (antigenic shift) are thought to be the source of pandemics of influenza. Zoonotic infections involving several different subtypes of influenza have occurred in the last few years, indicating the pandemic potential of influenza viruses circulating in domestic poultry.",

However, the high variability of influenza virus means that antibodies to one strain confer only limited protection against drift variants. Thus, influenza vaccines are given annually before the influenza season to boost pre-existing immunity, and the composition of the vaccine is updated regularly. In developed countries, the benefit of immunization has led to expansion of age-related vaccination policies. In the UK in 2000, vaccination was introduced for all individuals over 65 years of age, irrespective of pre-existing illness. Vaccination rates vary considerably between countries.",

Since 2000, the UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence has recommended that neuraminidase inhibitors may be used for treatment and prophylaxis, with certain restrictions. Mutations conferring resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors do not arise very frequently in vivo, and viruses containing them generally lose reproductive fitness and are at a disadvantage in transmission.
