Understanding patterns of viral diversity in wildlife and determinants of successful cross-species transmission, or spillover, are therefore key goals for pandemic surveillance programs 4 . However, few analytical tools exist to identify which host species likely harbor the next human virus, or which viruses can cross species boundaries 5-7 . Here we conduct the most comprehensive analysis yet of mammalian hostvirus relationships and show that both the total number of viruses that infect a given species, and the proportion likely to be zoonotic are predictable. After controlling for research effort, the proportion of zoonotic viruses per species is predicted by phylogenetic relatedness to humans, host taxonomy, and human population within a species range -which may reflect human-wildlife contact. We demonstrate for the first time that bats harbor a significantly higher proportion of zoonotic viruses than all other mammalian orders. We identify the taxa and geographic regions with the largest estimated number of 'missing viruses' and 'missing zoonoses' and therefore of highest value for future surveillance. We then show that phylogenetic host breadth and other viral traits are significant predictors of zoonotic potential, providing a novel framework to assess if a newly discovered mammalian virus could infect people. Viral zoonoses are a serious threat to public health and global security, and have caused the majority of recent pandemics in people 4 , yet our understanding of the factors driving viral diversity in mammals, viral host range, and cross-species transmission to humans remain nascent.

Here we create then analyze a database of 2,805 mammal-virus associations, including 754 mammal species (14% of global mammal diversity) from 15 orders and 586 unique viral species (every recognized virus found in mammals 16 ) from 28 viral families (Methods). We use these data to test hypotheses on the determinants of viral richness and viral sharing with humans. We fit three inter-related models to elucidate specific components of the process of zoonotic spillover (Extended Data Fig. 1 ). First, we identify factors that influence total viral richness (i.e. 'baseline' number of unique viral species found in a given host, including those which may have the potential to infect humans). Second, we identify and rank the ecological, phylogenetic, and life-history traits that make some species more likely hosts of zoonoses than others. Third, recognizing that not all mammalian viruses will have the biological capacity to infect humans, we identify and rank viral traits that increase their likelihood of being zoonotic.",

Of 586 mammalian viruses in our dataset, 263 (44.8%) have been detected in humans, 75 of which are exclusively human and 188 (71.5% of human viruses) zoonotic -defined operationally here as viruses detected at least once in humans and at least once in another mammal species (Methods). The proportion of zoonotic viruses is higher for RNA (159/382, 41.6%) than DNA (29/205, 14 .1%) viruses. The observed number of viruses per wild host species was comparable when averaged across orders, but bats, primates, and rodents had a higher proportion of observed zoonotic viruses compared to other groups of mammals (Fig. 1) . Species in other orders (e.g. Cingulata, Pilosa, Didelphimorphia, Eulipotyphla) also shared a majority of their observed viruses with humans, but data were limited in these less diverse and poorly-studied orders. Several domestic ungulate species (orders Cetartiodactyla and Perissodactyla) are outliers for their number of observed viruses, but these species have a relatively low proportion of zoonotic viruses ( Fig. 1 ; Supplementary Discussion).",

However, these studies weight all species equally. In reality, the risk of zoonotic viral transmission, or spillover, likely varies among host species due to differences in underlying viral richness, opportunity for contact with humans, propensity to exhibit clinical signs that exacerbate viral shedding 18 , other ecological, behavioral and life-history differences 5, 12, 15 , and phylogenetic distance from humans 10 . We hypothesize that the number of viruses a given mammal species shares with humans decreases with phylogenetic distance from humans and increases with opportunity for human contact. We used generalized additive models (GAMs) to identify and rank host-specific predictors (ecological, life history, taxonomic, and phylogenetic traits, and a control for research effort) of the number of total and zoonotic viruses in mammals (Methods; Supplementary Table 1 ).",

Not surprisingly, research effort had the strongest effect on the total number of viruses per host, explaining 31.9% of the total deviance for this model (Extended Data Table 1 ). The remaining 17.3% can be explained by biological factors, a value greater than or comparable to studies examining much narrower groups of mammal hosts 10, 12, 15 (Supplementary Discussion). Mammal sympatry was the second most important predictor of total viral richness (Fig. 2d) . Our model selection consistently identified mammal sympatry calculated at a \u226520% area overlap over other thresholds explored (Methods), providing insight into the minimum geographic overlap needed to facilitate viral sharing between hosts. Host geographic range was also significantly associated with increasing total viral richness, although the strength of this effect was low (Fig. 2c) . Several mammalian orders, Chiroptera (bats), Rodentia (rodents), Primates, Cetartiodactyla (even-toed ungulates), and Perissodactyla (odd-toed ungulates) listed here in order of relative deviance explained, had a significantly greater viral richness than predicted (Fig. 2e ). This finding highlights these taxa as important targets for global viral discovery in wildlife 4 , and suggests that traits not captured in our analysis (e.g. immunological function, social structure, and other life-history variables) may underlie their capacity to harbor a greater number of viral species. Our models to predict total viral richness were comparable when excluding virus-host associations detected by serology, i.e. using the 'stringent data', and were robust when validated with random cross-validation tests (Extended Data Table 1; Supplementary Table  2 ). However, we identified several regions that showed significant bias when cross validated by excluding mammals from zoogeographic areas, suggesting that there are location-specific factors that remain unexplained in our models (Methods; Supplementary Table 3 ).",

A large fraction of the deviance explained is driven by the observed total viral richness per host -supporting the biological assumption that the number of viruses that infect humans scales positively with the size of the potential 'zoonotic pool' 19 in each reservoir host. Removing this contribution by including observed total viral richness per host as an offset, the model explains 33% of the total deviance in the proportion of viruses that are zoonotic (Methods), with 30% of total deviance explained by biological factors (Fig. 2f-i) . Several mammalian orders had both a significant positive (bats) and negative (two ungulate orders) effect on the proportion of zoonotic viruses (Fig. 2i) . A number of previous studies have proposed that bats are special among mammals in being reservoir hosts of a large number of recently emerging high profile zoonoses (e.g. SARS, Ebola virus, MERS) 12, 13, 20 . Our study, for the first time, tests this hypothesis in the context of all known mammalian viruses and hosts. While other mammalian orders have relatively high proportions of observed zoonoses and others have been poorly studied (Fig. 1a) , our model results show that bats are host to a significantly higher proportion of zoonoses than other mammalian orders after controlling for reporting effort and the other predictor variables.",

This is the first time this relationship has been demonstrated using data for all mammals and specifically as a determinant of zoonotic spillover, and is supported by previous taxon-specific studies that have examined host relatedness and parasite/pathogen sharing in primates 9,10 , bats 14 , and plants 21 . The proportion of zoonotic viruses shows some upward drift for mammals that are very phylogenetically distant from humans (Fig. 2g ) that may represent an artifact of preferentially screening marsupials for human viruses. While primate species largely drive the phylogenetic effect, our best-fit model excluded the effect of the order Primates as a discrete variable (Fig. 2i ) -suggesting that continuous variation in phylogenetic distance across primate species is more important, and is significant even when all mammals are included. This finding highlights the need to uncover the mechanism by which phylogeny affects spillover risk, e.g. evolutionarily related species sharing host cell receptors and viral binding affinities 22, 23 and specific viral mutations that may expand host range in related mammal species 24 .",

The response curve for urban to rural population suggests that increasing urbanization raises the risk of zoonotic spillover (Fig. 2h) , as does increasing human population density and the change in urban to rural population ratio over time. A single global metric of human-wildlife ecological contact did not emerge across models. However, the alternate inclusion of these related variables points to the importance of human-animal contact in defining per species spillover risk globally, and the need for controlled field experiments and human behavioral risk studies to uncover the mechanisms underlying this risk. Overall, the strength of the effect of phylogenetic distance was stronger than our proxies for animal-human contact in predicting proportion of zoonoses (30-44% stronger explanatory factor), but both remained significant after controlling for research effort (Extended Data Table 1 ).",

We then project these 'missing viruses' and 'missing zoonoses' geographically ( Fig. 3 , Extended Data Figs. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] to identify regions of the world where targeted, future surveillance to find new viruses and zoonoses will be most effective. In the process of translating our non-spatial, specieslevel predictions to geographic space, we identified several regions where our model predictions of the number of total and zoonotic viruses were systematically biased (hatched regions - Fig. 3 and Extended Data Figs. 3-8; Methods). Local factors contributing to this bias may include geographic variation in the detection probability of human and/or wildlife viruses, indicating areas where additional research and capacity strengthening for viral detection are most needed. Our model predictions were not systematically biased or clustered across host phylogeny (Extended Data Fig. 9 ).",

The best model for determining whether or not a known virus (n=586 mammalian viruses) has been observed as zoonotic explained 27.2% of total deviance and included maximum phylogenetic host breadth (PHB -a virus-specific trait that measures the phylogenetic range of known hosts, excluding humans), research effort, whether or not a virus replicates in the cytoplasm, is vector-borne, or is enveloped, and average genome length (Fig. 4 ). Using the 'stringent' dataset to define whether a virus is zoonotic resulted in a reduced model that excluded enveloped status and genome length (Extended Data Table 1 ). Our findings confirm a positive relationship between zoonotic potential and ability to replicate in the cytoplasm 7 , and that viruses with arthropod vectors may be able to infect a wider range of mammalian hosts 5 . Our phylogenetically-explicit measure of host breadth, PHB, can be used at various hierarchical taxonomic levels to quantify and rank viruses from specialist to generalist, and was the strongest predictor of zoonotic potential (12.4% of total deviance explained). This highlights the value of field programs to identify the natural host range of newly discovered pathogens in order to develop early proxies for their zoonotic potential 4 . Significant variation in PHB across viral families is suggestive of intrinsic differences in a virus' ability to infect diverse hosts, and this relates to the proportion of observed zoonoses in each family (Fig. 4a) .",

First, our estimates of 'missing viruses' and 'missing zoonoses' per species are based on the current maximum observed research effort from the literature, and these estimates should be viewed as relative, not absolute. The true size of the undiscovered mammalian virome will likely increase with new genetic tools for unbiased viral discovery and in depth studies that repeatedly sample wildlife populations over time 25 . Second, our ecological and biological predictor variables only explain a portion of the total variation in viral richness per host and zoonotic potential based on viral traits, although this is greater than that reported in comparable order-specific studies 10, 12 . Third, while we control for research effort we cannot account for viruses or host associations that have completely evaded human detection to date, nor those identified but not published. Additional resources to support better data-sharing and on-the-ground viral surveillance in the species and regions we identify would help validate predictive models to identify zoonotic viral hotspots, and streamline costly efforts to develop measures to prevent their future emergence.",

All viral species names were synonymized to ICTV 8th edition, which was the global authority on viral taxonomy at the start of our data collection in 2010 16 . From 2010-15 the authors and a team of research assistants and interns at EcoHealth Alliance compiled mammal species associations for each of 586 unique viruses published in the literature between 1940-2015 initially by using the virus name and synonyms as the search keywords in the major online reference databases (Web of Science, PubMed, and Google scholar) in addition to searching in books, reviews, and literature cited in sources we had already obtained. To narrow the search for hosts for well-researched viruses, we additionally included the terms \"host(s)\", \"reservoir\", \"wildlife\", \"animals\", \"surveillance\", and other relevant terms to find publications related to host range. Associations were cross-checked for completeness with the Global Mammal Parasite Database for primate, carnivore and ungulate viruses, version as of Nov 2006 (GMPD, www.mammalparasites.org) 30 and other published reviews specific to bats and rodents 12, 31, 32 . We excluded all records without species-level host information, and those where we could not track down the primary references. Records of mammal-virus associations from experimental infection studies, zoological parks or captive breeding facilities, or cell culture discoveries were excluded. Host species were defined as domestic vs. wild following the list of domestic animal species from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) 33 , and we removed the black rat (Rattus rattus) and domestic mouse (Mus musculus) from the domesticated list as these two species make up their own \"peridomestic\" category. Host species were categorized as either occurring in human modified habitats or being hunted by humans -both estimates for human contact -according to the IUCN Red List species descriptions 34 .",

We also recorded the number of disease-related publications for each species using the scientific binomial AND topic keyword: disease* OR virus* OR pathogen* OR parasit*. The * operator was used in our search criteria to capture all words that begin with each term, e.g. \"parasit\" (= \"parasite\", \"parasites\", and \"parasitic\"). These search criteria broadly included papers that examined disease or diseases, virus or viruses, pathogen or pathogens, parasite parasites, or parasitology, for each species. Only one measure of per host research effort was included at a time in model selection. As these metrics are highly correlated and the number of disease related citations per host outperformed the total number of publications per host in all but one model (all-data zoonoses), we decided to use disease-related publications as our per-species research effort measure for all models to improve interoperability.

Blomberg's K measures phylogenetic signal in a given trait by quantifying trait variance relative to an expectation under a Brownian motion null model of evolution using a phylogenetic tree with varying branch lengths. Blomberg's K-values are scaled from 0 to infinity, with a value of 0 equal to no phylogenetic signal and values greater than 1 equal to strong phylogenetic signal for closely related species that share more similar trait values. While there is no clearly defined K-value cut-off in which to apply phylogenetic comparative methods, non-significant value of <1, or more conservatively <0.5, are typical for traits that are phylogenetically independent. The only host variables we examined with significant K-values >0.5 were host body mass, and our direct measure of phylogenetic distance to humans. While there are several tools available to control for phylogeny in multivariate analyses, e.g. using phylogenetic generalized least square models (e.g. PGLS) 42 , there is currently no modeling approach to control for phylogeny using GAMs. More importantly, a wholesale effort to control for phylogeny across all variables in our analysis was not appropriate here, as we are explicitly testing the relative importance of phylogenetic distance to humans vs. other host traits including measures of human-wildlife contact to predict the proportion of zoonotic viruses for a given host species. This left body mass as the only variable in our models, excluding our direct measures of phylogenetic distance, with a significant Blomberg K value that was greater than one. We controlled for the significant effect of shared evolutionary history using a phylogenetic eigenvector regression (PVR) 43,44 on body mass. The PVR approach allowed us to remove phylogenetic signal for any phylogenetically non-independent variables and then include the corrected values back in our GAMs, while retaining predictor variables like phylogenetic distance to humans as unmodified. We calculated PVR for body mass using the R package 'PVR' and our custom-build maximum likelihood host phylogeny using cytochrome B sequences constrained to the order-level topology of the mammalian supertree 29, 45 . Our new variable for body mass that controls for phylogenetic signal (PVRcytb_resid) removed most of the phylogenetic signal, with K= 3.5 unadjusted, and K<0.5 after PVR correction. Our new metric of body mass scales in the same way, with larger values equal to species with larger body mass. PVR body mass was included in our GAM model selection for the total viral richness and zoonotic virus models.",

Our use of GAMs, an incorporation of smooth spline predictor functions into the generalized linear model (GLM) framework, allowed us to examine the functional form of our predictor variables (e.g. Fig 2 and 4) . Categorical and binary variables (e.g. host order, IUCN status of hunted or not, and certain viral traits) were fit as random effects of each variable level. We used automated term selection by double penalty smoothing 53 to eliminate variables from the models. This method removes variables with little to no predictive power and has been shown to be comparable or superior to comparing alternate models with and without variables. We did use the model comparison method in for the case of domestic animals, where the sample size was not sufficient for fitting all variables. In this case dropping variables by double penalty smoothing still allowed pruning the model list to eliminate redundant models. Where there were competing variables measuring the same mechanistic effect, we fit alternate GAMs using only one of each of these variables (as specified in below and in the Extended Data Figure 1 ). These included phylogenetic variables, citation counts from alternate databases, and different measures of human population/host overlap. For example, to capture host phylogeny we used phylogenetic distance based on either the mammal supertree 20 or a purpose-built CytB constrained by the topology of the mammal supertree, but never both in the same model. For human population variables, we looked at either variables measuring overlap of species range with humanoccupied areas, or human population in those areas, as area-and population-based measures were highly co-linear. For citation variables, we looked at either all citations or the number of disease-related citations for each host species, not both, and similarly citations in either PubMed or Web of Knowledge. We used a binomial GAM to analyze the 586 mammalian viruses in our database and identify viral traits that may serve as predictors of zoonotic potential. Collinearity was not a major issue among variables included in the same model.",

Using QGIS 56 , a mammal-specific zoogeographical shapefile provided by Holt's group at the University of Copenhagen (http:// macroecology.ku.dk/resources/wallace) was intersected (using QGIS Vector > Geoprocessing Tools > Intersect) with a shapefile of IUCN's host ranges for all mammals in our database. Areas of these intersections were then calculated using an equal-area projection (Mollweide), and each host was assigned to only the region that contained the greatest proportion of its range. We systematically removed all observations (species) from each given zoogeographical region, re-fit the model using all observations from outside the region, then performed a non-parametric permutation test comparing the predicted values to the observed values for that region. Non-significant results indicate that model predictions are unbiased. Significant results for a given zoogeographic region suggest that there are location-specific biases that remain unexplained. This systematic zoogeographic crossvalidation supported the overall robustness of our model predictions for several models, i.e. all-data zoonoses, all-data total viral richness, and stringent-data total viral richness models. For these models, even though a majority of zoogeographic regions were unbiased, we still identified several zoogeographic regions that showed significant bias. Our zoogeographic cross-validation was equivocal for the stringent-data zoonoses model, with 8 regions that showed evidence of bias and 7 regions which showed no evidence of bias (Supplementary Table 3 ).",

To further investigate this, we added zoogeographical region as a categorical random effect to each of our best-fit models. For three of our best-fit GAMs (all-data total viruses, stringent-data total viruses, and stringent-data zoonoses) the addition of zoogeographical region as a categorical random effect decreased the model AIC and increased the total deviance explained by 3-5%. The all-data zoonoses model, which was used to create the series of maps in the main manuscript, does not improve with the inclusion of zoogeographical region. However, the improved predictive power of models using region-specific terms is offset by the increase in degrees of freedom (i.e. if we included 31 zoogeographic regions as separate terms) and, more importantly, a decreased interpretability of our models -especially when compared to the geographical variables we used, such as host area or species range overlap with human modified habitat. We opted not to include these random effects in our final GAMs in favor of keeping only variables interpretable in the context of our host trait-specific framework. Instead, we indicate areas of geographic bias directly on our spatially mapped outputs. (See \"Calculating and visualizing 'missing viruses' and 'missing zoonoses'\", below.)

Additionally, we calculated the total number of people within each host geographic range using data from HYDE database 57 , and also separately totaled the number of people in rural and urban populations. We obtained data on the distribution of cropland, pastures, rural and urban areas (i.e., grazing land) also from the HYDE database 57 for the years 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000 and 2005 with a spatial resolution of 5' \u00d7 5', equivalent to 10km 2 by 10km 2 . These datasets were created by combining information from satellite imagery and sub-national crop and pasture statistics 57 . In our GAMs, we used several transformations of these variables as competing proxies for humanwildlife contact: the log-transformed area of host range that overlapped each type of humanmodified land cover, log-transformed human population in the host range, log-transformed human population density in the host range, and the log-ratio of urban and rural human populations in the host range. For each of these, we also included as a variable the change in value from 1970 to 2005. Human-wildlife contact variables that significantly covaried were excluded (set as competing terms) during the model selection process. The ratio of urban to rural human population was used to disentangle variables of human-wildlife contact that significantly covaried. For example, the total area of a species range that overlapped with urban and rural areas was highly correlated with the total geographic area variables we examined (e.g. total area, and area in crop, pasture, rural, and urban). The ratio of urban to rural population allowed us to separate these signals and best represent this proxy of per species human-wildlife contact.
