            "text": "Opportunities and challenges in utilizing electronic health records for infection surveillance, prevention, and control There are unique patient safety challenges in the prevention and control of health care-associated infections (HAI). It is estimated that approximately 2 million HAI occur every year in the United States, and each infection increases the risk of death by as much as 6 times. 1 This amounts to an estimated 90,000 deaths annually and $4.5 billion excess health care costs. 2, 3 The emergence of specific multidrug-resistant organisms (MDRO), the growing number of immunocompromised patients, and the increasing number of invasive procedures and medical device implantations are posing new challenges for infection control. How many of these HAI are preventable remains unclear, but payers such as the Centers for Medicare Medicare & Medicaid Services have already enacted rules that preclude reimbursement for certain conditions that are attributed to hospitalization, eg, catheter-associated urinary tract infections. 4 Initiatives such as the Institute for Healthcare Improvement's 100,000 and 5 Millions Lives Campaigns, The Joint Commission's National Patient Safety Goals, and guidelines for public reporting of HAI reflect growing concern over HAI and the need for their prevention. 3, 5 Many such initiatives are evidence based and have shown to reduce the rate of HAI. For example, adherence to the ''bundle'' (hand hygiene, full-barrier precautions during insertion of catheter, using chlorhexidine antiseptic to clean the skin, avoiding the femoral site, and removing unnecessary catheters) was recently shown to reduce significantly the rates of catheter-related bloodstream infections among patients receiving care in intensive care units. 5 However, creating a successful culture of safety requires a significant investment in both education of health care personnel and infrastructure support. Currently, a third of all hospitals have less than 1 recommended ratio of infection control professionals (ICPs) to patient beds (a ratio of 0.8 to 1.0 ICP for every 100 occupied acute care beds). 6 Hence, ICPs struggle to keep up with essential infection control tasks because of other competing responsibilities and lack of adequate resources. Without deploying resources that allow for automation, it may not be possible for ICPs to collect more and richer data (such as catheter-days and details on adherence to the bundle for catheter insertion) and at the same time design specific interventions required for pay-for-performance initiatives.",

Health information and data and results management allow for an efficient view of patients' past records including medications, allergies, past admissions, and laboratory and microbiology results. Electronic communication enables better coordination of care plan among multiple providers and ancillary services as well as timely notification of critical patient data. Administrative processes such as scheduling and billing increase the efficiency of heath care organizations, provide timely service to patients, and decrease the paperwork. 7 Order management, clinical decision support, patient support, and population health functions have the potential for a more direct impact on infectious disease management, surveillance, prevention, and control but are not generally essential components of all present day EHRs. Order management includes functions such as computerized physician order entry (CPOE), which allows electronic entry of laboratory, medications, and radiology orders instead of orders being recorded on paper sheets or prescription pads. The electronic entry allows clinical decision support (CDS) functions to compare the order against standards for dosing, allergies, and others and warn the physician about potential problems. Patient support means providing tools such as patient portals or personalized health records (PHRs), which give patients access to their health records, provide patient education, and help patients carry out home monitoring and self-testing. This can empower patients and help improve control of chronic conditions, such as diabetes and congestive heart failure. Reporting and population health management support the use of already collected electronic data in EHR for uses other than clinical care. Quality management, outcomes reporting, and infectious disease surveillance are included in this category.",

            "text": "Although the benefits of health information, result management, electronic connectivity, and administrative support activities in terms of 24/7 chart access and better availability of the data are apparent and well understood, CPOE and CDS when customized and utilized appropriately can also have a direct and significant impact on patient care. CPOE can support process improvement, increase accuracy and legibility of the order, and integrate CDS into the order-entry process. 9,10 CDS can provide alerts for drug-drug, drug-allergy, and drug-food interactions based on routinely updated drug formularies. In addition, CDS also includes reminders, prompts, and alerts to improve compliance with best clinical practices and hyperlinks that can provide context-specific drug or disease information to the provider at the point of care. Studies have shown that properly designed CPOE and CDS can lead to as much as 85% reduction in serious medication errors. 10 Other system-wide benefits from fully functional EHRs include increased compliance with preventive care guidelines, better coordination and management of chronic conditions, improvement in quality indicators for pay-for-performance initiatives, reduced staff time spent on paperwork, reduced number of duplicate or unnecessary laboratory and imaging orders, and increased accuracy and timeliness of billing. 11 To support infectious disease (ID) management, CDS can be customized to incorporate patient-specific clinical information such as laboratory or microbiology information along with diagnostic, demographic, and clinical guidelines. This allows for several modes of decision support including alerts for critical laboratory values and recommendations for best antibiotic practices. Figure 2 shows a CDS where information from patient and a knowledge base feed into an inference engine (a software that uses different rules to draw conclusions) to generate a computerized alert that specifies the need for isolation and a negative-air room for a patient that is suspected to be infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. CDS can also be customized to generate reminders to enhance vaccination rates and preventive screening that have shown to be more effective and less expensive than the paper-based reminders. 11, 12 It is estimated that such computerized reminders to providers at the point of care can lead to a 6.1% to 28.4% increase in preventive health activities such as pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations. 12 CDS can also help address the persistent problem of inappropriate antimicrobial prescribing that can promote antimicrobial resistance. For example, Evans et al reported the use of an antiinfective-management program that recommended antimicrobials for patients admitted in intensive care unit and provided warnings and immediate feedback. 13 The use of the program led to significant reductions in orders for antibiotic-susceptibility mismatches (12 vs 206, respectively, P , .01) and in adverse events caused by antiinfective agents (4 vs 28, respectively, P , .02). In addition, patients who always received the regimens recommended by the computer program had reduced length of the stay (adjusted mean, 10.0 vs 12.9 days, respectively; P , .001) and total hospital costs (adjusted mean, $26,315 vs $35,283, respectively; P , .001). In a separate study, the authors reported that the percentage of patients having surgery who received appropriately timed preoperative antimicrobial prophylaxis increased from 40% to 99.1%, and the antibiotic-associated adverse drug events decreased by 30%. During the study, antimicrobial resistance patterns were stable, and mortality rates decreased from 3.65% in 1988 to 2.65% in 1994 (P , .001). The authors concluded that computer-assisted decision support programs can improve antibiotic use, reduce associated costs, and stabilize the emergence of MDRO. 14 In summary, CPOE and CDS can decrease medication errors by increasing accuracy and legibility of the physician orders and providing alerts for drugdrug, drug-allergy, and drug-food interactions. In addition, they can help reduce inappropriate antimicrobial prescribing, which is one of the leading causes of adverse drug events and antimicrobial resistance. These tools can be also customized specifically to improve isolation practices for those infected with MDRO or active contagious diseases.",

            "text": "Surveillance is defined as a comprehensive method of measuring outcomes and related processes of care, analyzing the data, and providing information to members of the health care team to assist in improving those outcomes. 15, 16 Manual methods to identify potential HAI cases by chart reviews, entering data, and looking for associations can be inefficient, labor intensive, and error prone. 17 EHRs can automate many of these processes. If properly designed, EHRs and related Health IT can also help in data analysis by identifying abnormal distributions of variables from large interrelated databases. 18 This has shown to be more efficient (requiring one third to one sixth the amount of time required by standard surveillance methods) and effective in screening potential outbreaks as well as finding and reporting endemic HAI. 18, 19 With current emphasis on mandatory reporting of HAI and requirement by some states to perform house-wide surveillance, EHRs and related information technologies provide a unique opportunity to support the paradigm shift to automated surveillance strategies, which allow ICPs to minimize time spent finding HAI and to maximize time spent preventing them (Fig 3) . 20 EHR-supported surveillance has the potential for being a more proactive approach compared with traditional techniques for case finding by which data are collected post hoc after the infection or outbreak has happened. For example, Pittet et al used their hospital information system to generate a ''readmission alert'' to ICPs that informed them about a readmission to the hospital of any patient previously colonized or infected with MRSA. 21 During the first 12 months of application, delayed recognition of readmitted MRSA carriers decreased significantly, and the proportion of MRSA patients recognized at the time of admission to the hospital increased from 13% to 40% (P , .001). The effectiveness of this approach has also been reported by Gransden et al, who found that two thirds of patients readmitted to the hospital were not known to be previously infected by the admitting staff and were instead alerted by the computerized system. 22 Early identification of patients at risk, such as at the time of hospital admission, allows ICPs to conduct active surveillance and take prompt contact precautions if needed to prevent nosocomial spread. 23 This strategy has been found to be cost-effective and supported by ",

            "text": "Institutions that do not have comprehensive EHRs can benefit from utilizing Web-based systems and other health information technologies for HAI prevention, control, and surveillance. For example, the Chicago Antimicrobial Resistance Project (CARP) reported a successful use of the clinical data warehouse to automate measurement of performance indicators and surveillance for infection control. 25 The clinical data warehouse was designed to store data collected from both nonelectronic sources (eg, manually abstracted data from patient medical records and scanned surveys) and electronic data from many different hospital information systems: pharmacy, laboratory, radiology, medical records, and emergency department. The CARP data warehouse has been used in regular surveillance activities such as determining rates of HAI, central venous catheter use, and antimicrobial resistance as well as for quality improvement activities. These investigations as well as others highlight potential applications that utilize increased convergence between EHRs and laboratory and pharmacy information systems for electronic reporting of endemic and syndromic conditions in the population. 26, 27 A recent report described a stand-alone electronic anesthesia record system and 6 sigma methodology to improve successfully the timing of perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis before surgical incision. 28 The time interval for antibiotic administration before surgical incision decreased from a preintervention mean of 88 minutes (95% CI: 56-119 minutes) to 38 minutes (95% CI: 25-51 minutes) (P , .01). A recently published study reported using an intranet-based tool for improvement and documentation of influenza vaccination and declination rates of 20,170 health care personnel in an 1100-bed hospital. With an estimated direct cost of $4800, the intranet-based tool was associated with a significant increase in documented vaccination rates from 38% to 55% in 1 year. 29 There are commercial surveillance technology software that can work with EHRs or other health information systems to help automate identification of HAI using algorithms that analyze laboratory results, admission records, and possible pathogens. The majority of these can be readily implemented within a few months. Some of these products can simultaneously track infection data and combine it with pharmacy data such as antibiotic use to generate antibiotic utilization and resistance reports and recommend targeted and cost-effective antibiotic selections at the point of care. A few can even provide real-time infection risk profiles via an electronic clinical dashboard that helps alert clinicians to specific patients who may be at high risk for infection. 18, 20 In addition, some may facilitate efficient and timely reporting of notifiable conditions to public health agencies. 30 More detail on commercial surveillance technology solutions is reported elsewhere (www.manageinfection.com/10-06/mic1006w26. pdf). Because these solutions may require significant capital investment and customization, a thorough analysis is recommended to find the best fit for an organization.",

It is also useful to assess whether the system uses data exchange and messaging standards that can automate data collection from EHRs and existing Health IT and facilitate reporting to public agencies. Although automation enhances efficiency, it does not by itself lead to more accurate data. Overt reliance on administrative or billing databases can lead to inaccurate and misleading reporting. 35, 36 Hence, due diligence should be exercised to confirm the accuracy of data and associated processes so as to meet the requirements of an epidemiologically sound surveillance system. 15, 16 ",
