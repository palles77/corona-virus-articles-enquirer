Anthrax remains a severely under-reported disease in Africa, Asia, and South America, where humans frequently butcher and eat animals infected with B anthracis. 4, 5 It is unlikely that this situation will change in the mediumterm because public health services in these regions are inadequately prepared and resourced to address the recurrent, widespread, sporadic anthrax outbreaks according to best public health practice. 6 In livestockdependent communities, survival is closely linked to the health of their animals. When sickness prevails, decisions on disposing of animals are sometimes in conflict with the need to use or consume this precious resource, putting the community at risk of anthrax exposure. Anthrax in wildlife is neglected because of the absence of legal or economic incentives to promote wildlife health.",

Destroying carcasses by burying or incineration is costly, and frozen, flooded, treeless, or rocky ground can make this virtually impossible. Consequently, carcasses are often left to rot or are discarded into flooding rivers. 5 Billions of B anthracis spores are released into soil and the environment as a result. Furthermore, domestic animals now dominate the global mammal biomass 7 on a shrinking rangeland. This dominance is leading to high densities of livestock in some regions, and persistent anthrax hotspots.",

If progress is to be made, especially in high anthrax-risk environments, where there is frequent animal-human contact, the focus needs to shift to reducing environmental contamination in a more practical and effective way. Owners of domestic livestock populations and wildlife managers could easily be trained in the detection and control of suspect cases. Where burning or burial is not feasible, and fencing off the site will not stop epidemics, due to vectoring blow flies, vultures, and other scavengers, a possible solution is the use of animal body-bags made from heavy-duty sealable plastic. These could be made available from health extension offices, stamped with a warning \"suspect anthrax-do not touch or move\", with a phone number to the public health and veterinary authorities and smartphone app QR codes on the bags to record automated spatiotemporal data. This method should isolate the carcasses and, in many cases, heating in the sun and rapid putrefaction would in time destroy the vegetative bacteria. 8 If this was to occur, then the carcass would no longer pose a threat as spores would not form and subsequent exposure would allow the forces of nature, such as scavengers to clean up and at no cost or risk of further spread of infection. With large carcass counts this method would be particularly appropriate and could reduce the burden of anthrax on people, domestic animals, and biodiversity, and in time even the exposure risk from soils in high density livestock communities.",
