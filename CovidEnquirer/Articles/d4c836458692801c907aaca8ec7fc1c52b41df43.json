This was recently highlighted by the high mortality of health workers in the Ebola outbreak in West Africa and from lessons with other emerging diseases, such as MERS-CoV, drug-resistant tuberculosis and SARS (Suwantarat & Apisarnthanarak 2015; Turale 2014) . Despite the high risk of exposure to communicable diseases in nurses (Omar et al. 2015) , adherence to infection control measures is suboptimal (Jackson et al. 2014 ). More specifically, noncompliance with hand hygiene and use of personal protective equipment has been well documented (Yassi et al. 2007 ). The impacts on adherence to infection control measures of infection control knowledge, availability of resources and workload have been studied (Andersson et al. 2016; Gould et al. 1996) . However, the influence of negative psychosocial work environment on non-adherence to infection control has been under examined, and a large knowledge gap remains.",

This imbalance is well documented to lead to anger, frustration and perceived unfairness with resultant sustained autonomic nervous system activation contributing further to physical disease (e.g. cardiovascular disease) and mental disorders (van Vegchel et al. 2005) . This stress may eventually transition to burnout (Siegrist 1996) , a psychological syndrome composed of elements of exhaustion and negativism to others (e.g. family, friends and co-workers); (Bakker & Demerouti 2007) . High burnout rates have been documented in nurse populations around the world (Chou et al. 2014; Labrague et al. 2017) , to the detriment of both the individual and organization, including decreased patient satisfaction, and threats to patient safety, as well as decreased worker productivity and increased staff turnover (Dewa et al. 2014; Halbesleben et al. 2008; Topcu et al. 2016; Vahey et al. 2004) . The relationship between healthcare worker burnout and healthcare-associated infections has also previously been reported (Cimiotti et al. 2012) , albeit never in a low-or middle-income country.",

            "text": "The effect of negative psychosocial work environments is of special interest in low-and middle-income countries undergoing rapid socio-economic transitions, where work demands may be greater and the burden of infectious disease higher. Such is the case in Ecuador, where the healthcare system is divided into the public and private sectors. The public sector is comprised of The Armed Forces Institute of Security, and Social Security of the National Policeresponsible for the health of the armed forces and police members, respectively, the Ecuadorian Institute of Social Security (IESS)covering public sector employees, and private sector organizations and individuals which pay into IESS and the Ministry of Public Healthresponsible for the population which is otherwise uninsured (Lucio et al. 2011 ). There has been a concerted effort to improve accessibility and indeed attempt to provide universal health care to its populations both by increasing the accessibility to the Ministry of Public Health services and by increasing the population covered under IESS. These efforts led to an impressive increase in the percentage of ensured population from 21.36% in 2006 to 41.44% in 2014 (National Institute of Statistics 2015) and concomitantly in the use of public healthcare services, from 16.2 million doctor visits per year in 2006 to 43.9 million doctor visits per year in 2014 (National Secretariat of Planning and Development 2015). The increase in accessibility to health care has been mirrored by an increase in healthcare workers, with the number of nurses increasing from 6 320 to 16 931, and auxiliary nurses rising from to 13 229 to 18 256 from 2004 to 2006 (National Institute of Statistics 2016). The potential benefit to the public from these efforts is likely to be profound. However, increased accessibility comes with its own challenges, from 2006 to 2014 blood-borne infectious diseases treated in the hospital increased from 70 932 to 240 115, gastrointestinal infections from 478 377 to 542 569 and respiratory infections from 1 428 905 to 2 271 681 (National Directorate of Epidemiological Surveillance 2016). Notwithstanding questions of dissimilarities in reporting, higher than average rates of healthcare-associated infections, mortality associated with those infections and antimicrobial resistance have also been reported in Ecuador compared with other low-and middle-income countries in Latin America (Salgado Yepez et al. 2017) . Previous research in countries undergoing similar rapid healthcare transitions has documented increased workload, role ambiguity, interprofessional conflict, limited job autonomy, decreased financial or esteem rewards, restricted promotion prospects and decreased job security (Hasselhorn et al. 2004 ). These negative psychosocial work characteristics are well-documented causes of work burnout and ERI (Toh et al. 2012) , and the impact of the latter two factors on infection control merits further examination.",

Selection of facilities was based on the presence of professionals with a mandate for both occupational health and infection control and an interest in participating, and departments were based on their presence in all the selected facilities. Questionnaires were distributed by a research assistant to all healthcare workers in the intensive care, emergency, internal medicine and maternity departments of the facilities. Workers were given 30 min of their shift to complete them, and a box was made available for confidential return of the questionnaires. In total, 1050 questionnaires were distributed, and 761 questionnaires were submitted. Of the submitted questionnaires, 349 were by nurses (auxiliary, general or specialized).

Secondly, the cross-sectional data design makes it impossible to draw conclusions about causality, while it is reasonable to assume that ERI and burnout act on health instead of the inverse, there is clearly a dialectical relationship at play as those people with greater health concerns may suffer to a greater degree when there are effortreward imbalances in the workplace. Finally, both dependent and independent variables were assessed using self-reported surveys, increasing the studies susceptibility to subject-reporting bias.

The association with nursing role may also be confounded by other factors which have been previously associated with burnout and adherence, such as increased patient demand, nurse seniority and specialized nurse roles (Vargas et al. 2014 ), which would be higher among general and specialized nurses in Ecuador. Specifically, the role of auxiliary nurses in many hospitals in Ecuador is that of patient support services (e.g. moving patients, changing bed sheets) with the little-to-no medical involvement (e.g. administering medications, monitoring vital signs, suctioning secretions, drawing blood, inserting IV lines). Furthermore, the 168% increase in general nurses from 2004 to 2006, compared to the 38% increase in auxiliary nurses during the same period (National Institute of Statistics 2016) may indicate a de facto increase in role and responsibilities of general and specialized nurses, leading to role ambiguity and role conflict, and accounting for the increased burnout and decreased adherence in those two groups. The absence of a statistically significant relationship with any other demographic characteristic is in agreement with published literature on the subject. Previous literature (studying a variety of nurse populations globally) has been conflicting on the association between socio-demographic factors and burnout (Adriaenssens et al. 2015) . However, scholars in Ecuador have previously found correlations between burnout and gender and other socio-economic indicators (Breilh 2015) . The positive correlation between nurses' perceived risk of infection and increased infection control adherence has been noted previously (Powers et al. 2016) and is in line with the concept that healthcare worker beliefs concerning problems, benefits, barriers and self-efficacy play a role in health-associated behaviour, known as the Health Belief Model. Furthermore, Pratt et al. (2009) demonstrated that a nurses' direct care for a SARS patient was a unique incremental predictor of infection control adherence, in an attempt to control for this confounding factor, nurses perceived risk was adjusted for in the linear regression analyses.",

These findings are consistent with the vast body of research that has reported and investigated burnout as an outcome of ERI (Siegrist 1996) . However, past literature on the relationship between ERI and burnout has focused almost exclusively on high-income countries in North America and Western Europe (Bakker et al. 2000; Pratt et al. 2009; Schulz et al. 2009 ). This is the first study to our knowledge to confirm the presence of this association in Latin American healthcare workers. The findings contribute evidence to burnout as an outcome of ERI being a mechanism that is observable across cultures and international economic statuses. The validation of this mechanism in the study population also allows for the possibility of using the Siegrist's framework to pinpoint the specific factors most contributing to effort-reward imbalances. In future research, factorial analysis of ERI scores could be attempted to ascertain if this is helpful in guiding interventions that can minimize ERI, its transition to burnout and associated negative effects.",

It is well known that rapid change increases work stress, further contributing to a negative psychosocial work environment setting the stage for burnout; this study has now documented this impact in Ecuador. More importantly, we have shown that burnout is associated with lapses in infection control adherence, which may result in increased transmissible occupational infections, further threatening the health of both the healthcare workforce and the populations they serve. Attention must now be turned to unpacking the workplace dynamics and social processes that drive burnout in healthcare workers.",

The affect of ERI on burnout in nurses and other healthcare workers suggests that national and facilities level health authorities should guard against policies that might increase effort-reward imbalances among healthcare worker. This is of special interest in circumstance where efforts are being made to expand services and increase public accessibility with limited resources, wherein policy changes may increase workload, create role ambiguity, limit job autonomy, decrease financial or esteem rewards, restrict promotion prospects and/or decrease job security. The affect of these policies on ERI and burnout in healthcare workers could diminish the beneficial impact to the general population and increases costs of those policies through the downstream effects of increased burnout such as decreased patient safety, reduced worker productivity and increased staff turnover. Policy makers should include strategies to curtail negative changes to the psychosocial work environment.",

Organizational interventions guided by perceived effort-reward and job-demand-resources imbalances (Mijakoski et al. 2015) have shown success and should be considered valid tools in infection prevention and control. Furthermore, access to mental health services for healthcare workers, including individual psychosocial interventions to address burnout have shown success (Gunusen & Ustun 2010; Nowrouzi et al. 2015) , and should be considered not simply as part of the commitment to workers health but as an investment in patient outcomes as well.",
