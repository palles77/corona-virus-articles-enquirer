Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the HRCT scans of 71 patients (38 females and 33 males) with H1N1 infection, confirmed through laboratory tests, between July and September of 2009. The HRCT scans were interpreted by two thoracic radiologists independently, and in case of disagreement, the decisions were made by consensus. Results: The most common HRCT findings were ground-glass opacities (85%), consolidation (64%), or a combination of ground-glass opacities and consolidation (58%). Other findings were airspace nodules (25%), bronchial wall thickening (25%), interlobular septal thickening (21%), crazy-paving pattern (15%), perilobular pattern (3%), and air trapping (3%). The findings were frequently bilateral (89%), with a random distribution (68%). Pleural effusion, when observed, was typically minimal. No lymphadenopathy was identified. Conclusions: The most common findings were ground-glass opacities and consolidations, or a combination of both. Involvement was commonly bilateral with no axial or craniocaudal predominance in the distribution. Although the major tomographic findings in H1N1 infection are nonspecific, it is important to recognize such findings in order to include infection with the H1N1 virus in the differential diagnosis of respiratory symptoms.",

Another inclusion criterion was the required availability of complete chest HRCT scans of each study patient, performed during the acute phase of the disease. Patients with other pulmonary infections, confirmed through laboratory tests, were excluded, as were those with tomographic findings suggestive of pulmonary involvement resulting from chronic lung diseases.

            "text": "In April of 2009, there began an epidemic of acute febrile respiratory illness caused by a new virus: the influenza A (H1N1) virus. The first cases occurred in Mexico, and the infection rapidly spread worldwide. (1) By August of 2010, 214 countries had been hit by the infection and more than 18,000 deaths had been confirmed. (1, 2) Although the number of cases of H1N1 infection has decreased significantly since the 2009 pandemic, various studies have reported that the virus is still circulating together with other seasonal viruses, with different prevalences. In Brazil, by October of 2012, approximately 20,000 patients had been hospitalized for severe acute respiratory syndrome. Of those, approximately 2,600 cases were caused by the influenza A (H1N1) post-pandemic virus. (3) The most common clinical findings in the presentation of H1N1 infection are fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia, and headache. Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, have also been reported. (4) (5) (6) In most cases, the symptoms are mild and run a self-limiting course; however, a small proportion of individuals develop a severe course, which can result in respiratory failure and death. (4, (7) (8) (9) (10) The most common laboratory test findings include increased serum lactate dehydrogenase levels (which can exceed 1,000 IU/L), bearing in mind that elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels are significantly associated with disease severity and ICU admission (6, 11) ; increased C-reactive protein levels; increased serum creatine kinase levels; lymphopenia; and thrombocytopenia. Elevated transaminase and D-dimer levels can occur in some patients. (4, 7, 12) Chest X-ray provides adequate information for defining the approach in most of the affected patients. (13) However, HRCT often becomes an important tool for determining the extent of pulmonary involvement, as well as being useful in the evaluation of complications and in the clarification of suspected mixed infections or failure to respond to therapy. Pulmonary abnormalities were identified on the HRCT scans of all patients. The most common tomographic findings, in decreasing order, were as follows: ground-glass opacities, in 60 patients (85%); consolidations, in 46 (64%; Figures 1 and 2); airspace nodules, in 18 (25%; Figure 3 ); bronchial wall thickening, in 18 (25%); interlobular septal thickening, with or without ground-glass opacities, in 15 (21%); crazy-paving pattern, in 11 (15%); perilobular pattern, in 2 (3%); and air trapping, 2 (3%; Figure 4 and Table 1 ).",

These data are similar to literature data showing that these tomographic findings predominate in patients with H1N1 infection.

Other authors (25) suggested that these changes occur early in the disease course, a period when patients have not yet sought medical care, and is therefore poorly reported. Tanaka et al. (25) related the high frequency of these findings in their study (68%) to the fact that their patients had quick access to medical treatment. Likewise, the immunocompromised patients in another study (24) are probably patients who received prompt medical attention, given their comorbidities.

When zonal predominance was present, it was more common in the lower thirds and peripheral regions of the lungs. Pleural effusion, when observed, was typically minimal. No lymphadenopathy was identified. Although the major tomographic findings in H1N1 infection are nonspecific, it is important to recognize such findings in order to include infection with the H1N1 virus in the differential diagnosis of respiratory symptoms",
