            "text": "Background: Glucose non-fermenting gram negative rods are known to be highly resistant in hospital settings and have always been a challenge for clinicians and hospital infection control. The degree or type of resistance may be due to several sophisticated mechanisms such as production of broad spectrum beta-lactamases, efflux pumps and altered membrane permeability, inactivating most classes of antimicrobials that are available for treatment (cephalosporins, carbapenems, aminoglycosides, fluoruquinolones). Tigecycline, a member of a new class of antimicrobials (glycylcyclines), has been shown to have potent expanded broad spectrum activity against most species of Enterobacteriaceae and selected species of non-fermenters, as well as Gram positives, atypicals and anaerobes. The TEST program determined the in vitro activity of tigecycline compared to amikacin, ampicillin, imipenem, cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, minocycline and piperacillin/tazobactam against members of Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa collected from hospitals in North America, Europe and Asia. Methods: A total of 2513 non-fermenting clinical isolates were identified to the species level at each participating site and confirmed by the central laboratory. Isolates were collected throughout 2004. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MICs) were determined by the local laboratory using supplied broth microdilution panels and interpreted according to NCCLS guidelines. Results: The cephalosporins were ineffective towards A. baumannii (n = 424). Tigecycline showed the lowest MICs against A. baumannii with a MIC50/MIC90 of 0.5/2 mcg/ml, outperforming amikacin, 74.3% inhibition MIC50/MIC90 4/64, imipenem, 79.5% MIC50/MIC90 0.5/16, and minocycline, 85.4% MIC50/MIC90 1/8. Similar findings were found in other species of the Acinetobacter genus. Conclusion: The presented data suggest that tigecycline may be an effective and reliable therapeutic option against strains of Acinetobacter spp., including multi-drug resistant strains regardless of degree or type of resistance.",

Johnson, S. Bouchillon, J. Johnson, D. Hoban, M. Dowzicky, P. Bradford (Schaumburg, Pearl River, USA) Objectives: Tigecycline (TGC), a new glycylcycline antimicrobial in development has demonstrated excellent in vitro activity against Gram-positive and -negative pathogens. Recent reports suggest that TGC MIC values, against some organisms, may be elevated if broth used in microdilution panels is (>12 hours old (aged). The NCCLS has tentatively recommended that testing of TGC be performed in broth that is (<12 hours old (fresh). This study looks at the difference between panels using fresh broth, aged broth and broth with a biocatalytic oxygen-reducing agent (BORA) added to compensate for any potential broth differences. Materials and Methods: Testing was performed on approximately 120 organisms including: E. coli; K. pneumoniae; M. catarrhalis; S. epidermidis; and S. pneumoniae. The BORA used in this study is Oxyrase \u00d2 for Broth at 2% concentration. TIG microdilution panels evaluated in this study include: panels and aged broth without oxyrase (Aged); panels and aged broth with oxyrase (AO); panels and fresh broth without oxyrase (Fresh); and panels and fresh broth with oxyrase (FO). Panels and aged broth were prepared by Microscan. Fresh broth was prepared internally. Each organism was tested on all four panel types. Quality controls were performed using NCCLS approved ATCC strains. Results: Combined test results showed an MIC correlation (with in 1 log2 dilution) as follows: 97.5% between Fresh/AO; 85.6% between Fresh/Aged; 94.3% between FO/AO; and 87.9% between FO/Aged. Quality controls ranges for FO, Fresh and AO were all in compliance, but Aged panels were out of range 29.3% of the time.",

            "text": "Conclusion: The addition of a BORA to aged broth produced results equivalent to fresh broth without a BORA. Objectives: Despite the introduction of new antimicrobials to treat resistant gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus continues to be a therapeutic challenge for the clinician. Glycylcyclines are showing the promise of significant activity against many grampositive pathogens including methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Tigecycline, the first glycylcycline to enter clinical trials, has shown excellent activity against Staphylococcus spp. This study was initiated to evaluate the in vitro activity of tigecycline as compared with those of 9 comparator agents (ampicillin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, imipenem, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, minocycline, vancomycin, linezolid, piperacillin-tazobactam) against S. aureus including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) from multinational evaluation centres in the TEST program. Methods: A total of 1245 clinical isolates were identified to the species level at each of 15 sites in 8 countries and confirmed by the central laboratory. Isolates were collected between January 2004 and November 2004. MICs were determined by each participating laboratory using supplied broth microdilution panels from Dade MicroScan. All testing was performed according to NCCLS guidelines and manufacturer's instructions. Results: The MICs of tigecycline ranged from 0.06 to 1 mcg/mL for all isolates of S. aureus. Tigecycline's MIC50/MIC90 of 0.12/ 0.25 mcg/mL, respectively, against MSSA was similar to imipenem and minocycline and 4/8 fold lower than the remaining comparative agents. Tigecycline's MIC50/MIC90 of 0.25/0.5 mcg/mL, respectively, against MRSA was 8/4 fold lower than vancomycin, 2/4 fold lower than minocycline and 4/8 fold lower than linezolid. All isolates of S. aureus were inhibited by tigecycline at an MIC of 1 mcg/mL regardless of methicillin phenotype. Conclusion: The in vitro activity of tigecycline was comparable in all S. aureus tested regardless of methicillin phenotype. Tigecycline activity against MRSA was more potent than all antimicrobial agents tested in this study including imipenem, minocycline, linezolid, and vancomycin. Background: Rapid increasing resistance in nosocomial pathogens has always been a challenge for clinicians and hospital infection control. Tigecycline, a member of a new class of antimicrobials (glycylcyclines), has been shown to have potent expanded broad spectrum activity against most species of Enterobacteriaceae as well as Gram positives, atypicals and anaerobes. The TEST program determined the in vitro activity of tigecycline compared to amikacin, ampicillin, imipenem, cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, minocycline and piperacillin/tazobactam against members of Enterobacteriaceae (mainly E. coli, Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., and Serratia spp.) collected from hospitals in North America, Europe and Asia. Methods: A total of 3204 clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae were identified to the species level at each participating site and confirmed by the central laboratory. Isolates were collected throughout 2004. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MICs) were determined by the local laboratory using broth microdilution panels and interpreted according to NCCLS guidelines. Results: Tigecycline's activity was equivalent to imipenem presenting a MIC50/MIC90 of 0.25/1 mcg/mL against all strains of Enterobacteriaceae. In comparison to other antimicrobials tested, the MIC90 of 1 mcg/mL for tigecycline was also the lowest being 8 fold lower than commonly prescribed broad spectrum antimicrobials such as ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and minocycline and 16 fold lower than ceftazidime and piperacillin/tazobactam. The frequency of ESBL production among K. pneumoniae and E. coli was found to be 10.3% and 2.2%, respectively. Tigecycline inhibited >98% of all E. coli and K. pneumoniae ESBL producers at an MIC of 2 mcg/mL. Approximately 20% of Enterobacter spp. and Serratia spp. presented resistance to third generation cephalosporins (ceftazidime and ceftriaxone) suggestive of AmpC-type resistance. Tigecycline also inhibited a majority of these isolates with an MIC90 of 2 mcg/mL. Conclusion: Tigecyclines in vitro activity was comparable to the activity of a broad spectrum antimicrobial, carbapenem (imipenem) , and greater than other commonly prescribed broad spectrum agents tested in this study. The presented data suggest that tigecycline may be an effective therapeutic option against both susceptible strains of Enterobacteriaceae and multi-drug resistant strains regardless of degree or type of resistance. Background: Tigecycline, a member of a new class of antimicrobials (glycylcyclines), has been shown to have a potent expanded broad spectrum activity against most species of Enterobacteriaceae as well as gram-positive, atypicals and anaerobes. The TEST program determined the in vitro activity of tigecycline compared to amikacin, ampicillin, imipenem, cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, minocycline and piperacillin/tazobactam against isolates of Enterobacteriaceae collected from hospitals across the USA. Methods: A total of 2446 clinical isolates, collected in 2004, were identified to the species level at each participating site and confirmed by the central laboratory. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MICs) were determined by the local laboratory using broth microdilution panels and interpreted according to NCCLS guidelines. Results: The efficacy of all broad spectrum antimicrobial agents still remain highly active against Enterobacteriaceae in the United States. The susceptibility rates for amikacin, cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, imipenem, levofloxacin, minocycline and piperacillin/tazabactam are 99.3%, 97.5%, 89%, 92.2%, 98.8%, 85.5%, 85.7% and 91.8%, respectively. Tigecycline's activity was similar to imipenem presenting a MIC50/MIC90 of 0.25/1 mcg/ ml against all strains of Enterobacteriaceae. The frequency of ESBL production among K. pneumoniae and E. coli was found to be 8.5% and 2.2%, respectively. Tigecycline successfully inhibited >98% of all E. coli and K. pneumoniae ESBL producers at a MIC of 2 mcg/ml. It was also noticed unusual resistance to imipenem in 29 of these isolates. While still under more detailed analysis, preliminary data have shown that tigecycline presented a MIC50/ MIC90 of 1/2 mcg/ml against these multi-resistant isolates. Conclusion: Most of broad spectrum antimicrobial agents still remain active against Enterobacteriaceae from the US. Tigecycline's activity was comparable to the activities of broad spectrum antimicrobials and with greater activity against most ESBL and AmpC producing isolates. Tigecycline also showed in vitro activity against isolates that were intermediate or resistant to imipenem, which in many instances is considered as a last therapeutic option. The presented data suggest that tigecycline may be an effective and reliable therapeutic option against both susceptible strains of Enterobacterieaceae and multi-drug resistant strains regardless of degree or type of resistance. Background: Tigecycline, a member of a new class of antimicrobials (glycylcyclines), has been shown to have potent expanded broad spectrum activity against most commonly encountered Gram-positive and Gram-negative species, including anaerobic pathogens responsible for community and hospital infections. The TEST program determined the in vitro activity of tigecycline compared to amikacin, ampicillin, imipenem, cefepime, ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, minocycline and piperacillin/ tazobactam against gram negative rods in addition to linezolid, penicillin and vancomycin for the gram positive species. Isolates were collected from hospitals in the United States throughout 2004. Methods: A total of 4100 clinical isolates were identified to the species level at each participating site and confirmed by the central laboratory. Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MICs) were determined by the local laboratory using supplied broth microdilution panels and interpreted according to NCCLS guidelines. Results: As shown in the table below, tigecycline's activity was similar to imipenem against Enterobacteriaceae. It inhibited multi-resistant ESBL and AmpC producers with a MIC equal or lesser than 2 mcg/ml. Tigecycline also showed in vitro activity with a MIC90 2 mcg/ml against 29 imipenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae strains. Although similar to other classes of broad spectrum antimicrobial agents against non-fermenters, tigecycline was especially active against Acinetobacter spp. with the lowest MIC90 of 2 mcg/ml. Tigecycline inhibited S. aureus with MIC90 of 0.25 mcg/ml for both MSSA and MRSA isolates. Against enterococci, tigecycline's MIC90 was consistent regardless of vancomycin susceptibility. Conclusion: Tigecycline's in vitro activity was comparable or greater than most commonly prescribed broad spectrum antimicrobials. The presented data suggest that tigecycline may be an effective and reliable therapeutic option against both susceptible common gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens, including multi-drug resistant strains regardless of degree or type of resistance.

Results: Tigecycline's activity was similar to imipenem against Enterobacteriaceae with MIC50/MIC90 of 0.25/1 mcg/ml. Resistance to third generation cephalosporin was found in 63.2% of E. coli and 77.8% of K. pneumoniae consistent with ESBL phenotype. Tigecycline inhibited ESBL and AmpC producers with MICs equal or lesser than 1 mcg/ml. Although similar to other classes of broad spectrum antimicrobial agents against glucose non-fermenters, tigecycline was especially active against Acinetobacter spp. presenting the lowest MIC90 of 1 mcg/ml.

Materials and methods: A total of 185 Gram-negative anaerobic clinical strains (116 Bacteroides fragilis group, 20 other Bacteroides spp. non-fragilis, 34 Prevotella spp. and 15 miscellaneous) isolated during the period 11/2002-11/2004 were tested using the E-test and the agar dilution methods on brucella agar plates supplemented with 5% horse blood, vitamin K1 and hemin. Incubation in a ChelLab Anaerobic Chamber was performed for 48 hours. Interpretation of the results was according to NCCLS guidelines. For quality control the strains B. fragilis ATCC25285 and B. thetaiotaomicron ATCC29741 were used. Results: Overall MIC90 to tigecycline, tetracycline, penicillin, piperacillin + tazobactam, cefoxitin, clindamycin, metronidazole and imipenem were 8, 128, 256, 2, 64, 256, 1 and 0.5 mg/L, respectively, whereas MIC50 were 0.5, 16, 32, 0.125, 8, 1, 0.5 and 0. 064 mg/L, respectively. Bacteroides fragilis group MIC90 were 8, 256, 256, 4, 128, 256 , 1 and 0.5 mg/L, respectively, whereas MIC50 were 0.5, 16, 64, 0.25, 16, 1, 0.5 and 0. 064 mg/L, respectively. At the tigecycline MIC90 concentration of 8 mg/ L the compound inhibited a higher percentage of isolates than clindamycin, cefoxitin or tetracycline (which inhibited 76, 56 and 45% of the isolates, respectively). Only one strain was resistant to imipenem (MIC > 32 mg/L), having a tigecycline MIC of 8 mg/L. In addition, six of the eight strains with a metronidazole MIC > 16 mg/L had a tigecycline MIC < 1 mg/L. Conclusions: In general, tigecycline showed better in vitro activity than clindamycin, cefoxitin, tetracycline or penicillin against Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria and somewhat lower Clinical Microbiology and Infection, Volume 11, Supplement 2, 2005 activity than imipenem, metronidazole or piperacillin + tazobactam. Nevertheless, among most metronidazole and imipenem resistant isolates tigecycline displayed good activity. The results of this in-vitro evaluation show that tigecycline should be considered as a possible alternative for the treatment of mixed aerobicanaerobic infections. Objectives: To ascertain the variation between MICs of tigecycline determined in broth and agar, and by NCCLS and BSAC methods. To assess the effect of adding tigecycline to the medium one day before use and of using media that had been aged for one week before addition of tigecycline and inoculation. Method: MICs for 96 non-fastidious bacteria and 20 streptococci were determined in Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB), Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA), Iso-Sensitest broth (ISB) or Iso-Sensitest agar (ISA). Fresh antibiotic stock solutions (tigecycline, tetracycline and minocycline) were incorporated into bulk media by rolling, to minimise aeration. Preparation conditions otherwise were as fol-lows: (a) freshly-prepared media, antibiotic added upon cooling, then inoculated; (b) freshly-prepared media, antibiotic added upon cooling thenstored for 1 day before inoculationand (c) media stored for 7 days before addition of the antibiotic and inoculation. Results: MICs in fresh MHB (the NCCLS reference method) were taken as a standard. For all the tetracyclines, these MICS were 0-2 doubling dilutions higher than on MHA or ISA (BSAC reference method), or in ISB. Media with tetracyclines added a day before use gave raised MICs, though rarely by more than one dilution. Tigecycline MICs were increased in 7-day-old MHB or ISB. This effect was greatest (2-3 dilutions) for the most susceptible strains (MIC \u00a3 0.5 mg/L) and was absent for the resistant organisms (MIC \u2021 8 mg/L); it did not occur in agar. Minocycline MICs were not raised in aged media, and tetracycline MICs were only marginally affected. The addition of blood to the MHB largely abrogated the effect on tigecycline MIC, as did boiling the broth prior to adding the antibiotic. Conclusion: The raised MICs of tigecycline in aged broth probably reflect inactivation by dissolved oxygen. This accords with lack of any MIC increase in newly boiled (i.e. degassed) MHB or on aged agar (which is boiled to melt before use). The effect of blood may be to add to the reducing capacity, protecting the tigecycline. At a practical level, broth MIC methods for tigecycline (e.g. the NCCLS reference method) require, freshly prepared or steamed medium; this is not a concern if agar dilution methods are used, such as that of the BSAC.",

All serum samples were tested with conventional syphilis tests according to the manufacturers\u00d5 instructions: RPR, Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL), T. pallidum haemagglutination (TPHA) at a serum dilution of 1:80, fluorescent T. pallidum absorption (FTA-ABS) and IgM capture enzyme immunoassay (EIA). Subsequently, the results were compared to those of the Treponema + VDRL ViraBlot IgG, IgM test (Viramed, Labor -Diagnostika), a immunoassay for the qualitative detection of specific IgG or IgM antibodies to T. pallidum using the specific treponemal proteins p47, p44.5, p17 and p15, and the quantitative determination of VDRL reaction on one nitrocellulose strip. Results: Treponema + VDRL ViraBlot IgG and IgM tests confirmed the results for 56 serum specimens positive for T. pallidum antibodies: reactive VDRL band and at least two clear bands from p47, p44.5, p17 or p15 for IgG treponemal antibodies or at least one clear band p47, p17 or p15 for IgM treponemal antibodies. The 10 RPR reactive sera were VDRL ViraBlot reactive, but Treponema ViraBlot specific antibodies negative. None of the remaining sera reacted in tests with the Treponema + VDRL ViraBlot assay. Conclusions: The Treponema + VDRL ViraBlot assay combining the necessary serologic markers in one test strip (i.e. specific and non-specific treponemal antigens) is a useful confirmatory test for syphilis because it increases the reliability of syphilis diagnosis with respect to current conventional techniques.",

Meningeal and meningoencephalitic involvement may occur also in early stages of syphilis, thus posing problems of differential diagnosis. Case reports: A young woman and an HIV-infected male developed a syphilis with predominant meningoencephalitis expression. In the first p, based on an isolated positive Borrelia burgdorferi serology (later deemed as a cross-reaction), early ceftriaxone was started, due to a suspected neurological Lyme disease. Also after the diagnosis of neurosyphilis (on the ground of positive CSF serology), antimicrobial therapy was left unchanged for 3 weeks at our Day-Hospital facilities, until complete clinical-microbiological cure. A second, HIV-infected p was hospitalized owing to mild fever lasting 2 weeks, associated with cephalalgia and anxiety.The favorable virological-immunological status (CD4 + count 439 cells/lL and undetectable HIV viraemia, under an effective HAART regimen), did not exclude all searchs for possible HIV-related disorders.Although serum examination detected a potential latent syphilis (isolated positive serum Treponema pallidum IgG, TPHA 1:640,IgG-positive RPR, and mute history for syphilis), only CSF examination disclosed an increased cell content (50/lL), altered brain-blood barrier indexes with increased intrathecal Ig synthesis, and frank VDRL,TPHA (1:1520), and borderline T. pallidum IgM serology.Penicillin G at 24 MU/day for 14 days led to a slow resolution of neurological signs and symptoms, and a tendency to improvement of specific CSF-serum syphilis serology during subsequent controls.",

Results: The overall HPV DNA prevalence was 23.5% (24/102). Ten of the HPV positive women (41.6%) were infected with high-risk (HPV-16 or HPV-18) virus types; eight (33.3%) with low-risk types (HPV-6 or HPV-11), and six (25%) were infected with both high-and low-risk types (3 HPV-6/-16; 2 HPV-6/-18 or 1 HPV-6/-33). HPV prevalence among women younger than 23 years was 58.3% (14/24). For low-risk types the peak prevalence was observed in women between 35-40 years. Besides age, there was a positive association between the detection rates of HPV infection and number of sexual partners and oral contraceptive use. Conclusion: The used technique is simple, economic, rapid and reliable for screening studies of HPV infections. The prevalence of HPV in cytologically normal Bulgarian women is similar to the reported in other countries.

While some studies indicated that certain serovars are more frequently implicated with particular diseases, others have suggested that size variability of the multiple banded antigen (MBA) may contribute to ureaplasmal pathogenesis. To address these hypotheses, vaginal and placental samples from women with spontaneous preterm delivery were tested for ureaplasma species, serovars and MBA size variants. Methods: Placenta/amnion specimens and corresponding vaginal samples from women that delivered via caesarean section less than 34 weeks of pregnancy were collected. Samples were examined for ureaplasma species and serovars by cultivation and PCR assays. To determine MBA size variants, PCR with primers amplifying the non-repetitive and the C-terminal repeat region of the MBA gene were performed. Results: Out of 100 cases examined so far, 32 placenta/amnion specimens and 40 corresponding vaginal samples were positive for ureaplasmas by cultivation and PCR. While ureaplasma positive samples from the lower genital tract were carrying U. parvum (100%) and U. urealyticum (50%), colonization of the placenta/amnion was restricted to U. parvum which was only recovered from women with preterm labor or preterm PROM. In contrast, ureaplasmas were not detected in samples from women with HELLP syndrome, IUGR and preeclampsia. As opposed to some previous studies, particular serovars were not implicated in adverse pregnancy outcome. However, significant differences between number and lengths of MBA PCR products among placental and vaginal ureaplasma isolates were obvious. Ureaplasma isolates from placenta/amnion membranes gave shorter PCR products than did corresponding vaginal isolates and while a majority of vaginal ureaplasma isolates were composed of multiple size variants, placental isolates were predominantly restricted to a singular MBA size variant. Conclusion: Only U. parvum was found to be frequently present in the placenta/amnion of women with preterm delivery and certain serovars were not more frequently implicated with particular diseases. In addition, MBA size variation represents an additional level of phenotypic and genetic variability beyond the serovar category which may provide an important contribution to ureaplasmal pathogenesis.",

Methods: Eighty-one patients with clinical diagnosis of AV in accordance to Donders's criteria, have been included in the study. The presence at least of four of the following symptoms were taken as diagnosis of AV: objective abnormal yellow vaginal discharge, foul smell (but negative to KOH test), elevated vaginal pH (>5), abundant vaginal leukocytes and lactobacillary grade IIa, IIb and III in accordance to Donder's classification. Other characteristics such as vaginal dyspareunia, vulva-vaginal itching, cervical erosion as well as the isolament of vaginal microorganisms were also documented. The patients were randomised treated, 45 with kanamycin (100 mg vaginal ovules per 6 days, consecutively) whereas, 36 with meclocycline (35 mg vaginal ovules per 6 days, consecutively). The patients were visited before starting the study, 1-2 days and 30 days after the end of the study. Results: At the first follow-up the patients showed different level of symptoms reduction. Particularly, reduction of presence of leukocytes, burning of vaginal mucosa and itching were statistically significant in the group treated with kanamycin with respect to the group treated with meclocycline. Moreover, there was also a reduction of isolament of Enterobacteriaeae (97%) in the group treated with kanamycin versus 76% treated with meclocycline. At the second follow-up, vaginal homeostasis (normalisation of pH and presence of lactobacilli) was demonstrated only in kanamycin treated group. Conclusion: Our data suggested that the topic use of kanamycin could be considered a specific antibiotic for the therapy of this new pathology. Objectives: Establishing the identity of Lactobacillus species colonizing the vagina of women is of importance, because clinical studies have demonstrated an association between the presence of H 2 O 2 -producing strains of Lactobacillus and a decreased prevalence of bacterial vaginosis (BV).

Grade I specimens, representing a normal microflora, were further characterized as grade Ia when only L. crispatus cell types were present, grade Ib when other Lactobacillus cell types were present, grade Iab when both L. crispatus and other lactobacilli were present and grade Ic when either gram-positive rods, small and short, or irregularly shaped gram-positive rods, with clubbing, curved edges and irregular staining (\u00d4diphteroid cell types\u00d5) were seen. Results: Out of the 515 samples, 86.4% showed a normal vaginal microflora (grade I), 8.9% were grade II, 3.7% grade III and 1.0% grade IV. Based on the presence of different Lactobacillus species, grade I specimens were further characterized as grade Ia (36.4%), grade Ib (40.9%), grade Iab (13.5%) and grade Ic (8.5%). This classification was supported by the finding that out of respectively 86.0% and 76.6% of grade Ia and Iab specimens L. crispatus was cultured while this species was present in only 13.1% and 2.6% of respectively Ib and Ic specimens. In addition, 55.1% of grade Ic specimens contained Bifidobacterium spp. Conclusion: Further refinement of Gram stain based grading of vaginal smears is possible by distinguishing additional classes of normal microflora. These categories of Gram scores may facilitate and improve future studies regarding the interpretation of clinical data and therapeutic outcome. Objectives: The importance of the isolation of Gardnerella vaginalis in bacterial vaginosis is well known. The involvement in male urogenital infection is uncertain, probably due to low rate of isolation for inadequated specimens process. The objective of this study is to evaluate the possible pathogenic rol of G. vaginalis in male urogenital pathology. Semen is a recommended specimen in diagnosing of prostatitis. At the same time it also reflects normal genital tract microflora. Although its composition may be affected by the sexual activity, there are no data regarding the changes in genital tract microflora during the sexual debut. Objective: To identify possible associations between sexual experience and the reproductive tract inflammatory parameters and microflora in healthy young men. Methods: A total of 72 healthy men aged 17-22 years were included and divided into 3 groups based on their sexual experience (virgins n = 13, monogamous n = 11 and polygamous n = 48). A semen sample of each subject was assessed for basic semen parameters (semen volume, sperm concentration, sperm motility), white blood cell (WBC) counts and quantitative cultures for aerobic, microaerobic and anaerobic bacteria, and possible correlations between the type of sexual experience, WBC counts and seminal microflora were calculated. Results: Basic semen parameters were similar in all groups. 5.5% of men had high (>1 M/ml) and 19.4% of men had medium (0.2-1 M/ml) semen WBC counts. There were no correlations between the type of sexual experience and semen WBC counts. In comparison to sexually active men in virgin subjects the total microbial counts in semen (4.4 vs 5.0 log CFU p < 0.05) and the number of different species (3 vs 5, p \u00bc 0.05) were lower, however, no differences between mono-and polygamous men were found. There was a positive correlation between the total microbial concentrations and number of different species (r = 0.54; p < 0.0001). Staphylococci, Corynebacterium seminale, other coryneforms, gamma-and alpha-haemolytic streptococci and peptostreptococci were the most prevalent organisms. No significant differences in microflora were observed between the groups yet the Gram-negative anaerobic rods were more often seen in sexually experienced men than in virgins. The subjects with high WBC counts (>1 M/ml) tended to have higher number of different microorganisms than the rest of the men (median 7 vs 4, p = 0.05).",

Fifty five women were included in studied group -with confirmed C. trachomatis cervicitis and 67 women -in control group (with non-chlamydial/non-gonococcal cervicitis). BV was diagnosed using Amsel and Nugent (0-3 negative; 4-6 intermediate; 7-10 positive) criteria. By using Amsel criteria BV was suggested in 11% and 6% correspondingly among women in studied and control group. By using Nugent criteria BV was suggested correspondingly in 5.5% and 3%. These differences were not statistically significant and can be explained by the presence of muco-purulent discharge among studied women. Objectives: Helicobacter pylori is recognized as an important human pathogen but the differentiation of the species by classical phenotypic methods is really difficult. Therefore the objective of this study was the development of an identification method for Helicobacter species based on PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis of the 16S and 23S rRNA genes. Objectives: Since the first identification of Helicobacter pylori by Warren and Marshal in 1983, members of the genus Helicobacter increased to more than 26 species, which have been detected in human and animals. The construction of species specific PCR assays is difficult due to the close relatedness between different Helicobacter species. The PCR-DGGE technique was developed for the identification of Helicobacter colonization. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of multiple regions of the 16 rRNA gene on the diagnostic efficiency PCR-DGGE. Methods: DNA was extracted from 40 Helicobacter strains, which represent 20 Helicobacter species. Amplification of 1.2 kb of helicobacter 16S rDNA, which contains V3 and V6-7 regions, was done using previously published Helicobacter genus specific primers C97 and C05. The PCR product can be used as a template for two Helicobacter genus PCR assays, the v6-7 regions 16S rDNA was amplified using the primers 1FC254 and 2RC686, the v-3 region was amplified using the primers BSF917 and BSR1114 published at (http://rrna.uia.ac.be/ primers). DGGE analysis of the V3 and V6-7 regions was performed on 9% polyacrylamide gels containing urea and formamide gradient from 20-40% or 15-30%, respectively. Electrophoresis was performed in a DCode electrophoresis unit (BioRad) at constant voltage (200 V) at 60\u00b0C for 4 hours. Results: DGGE analysis of two regions of Helicobacter 16SrRNA gene showed mobility patterns that allowed discrimination of most Helicobacter species except those which are closely related such as H. pullorum-H. pametensis, H. ganmani-H. rodentium and H. bizozeroni-H. felis-H. salmonis. Conclusions: Helicobacter species are widely distributed in the gastrointestinal tract of mammals, birds and other animals. The PCR-DGGE technique has proven to be an easy, inexpensive and efficient tool for the identification of Helicobacter species and for the detection of colonisation by more than one Helicobacter species, without the need for species-specific PCR assays. In addition, the diagnostic efficiency of this technique was increased by analysis of multiple regions of the 16S rRNA gene.",

            "text": "Helicobacter spp. in chronic pancreatitis, pancreatic adenoma and pancreas cancer Objectives: Helicobacter spp. efficiently colonise various hostile habitats such as the stomach, colon and biliary tract of animals and man. With the exception of H. pylori, many Helicobacter spp. are difficult to culture. Nucleic acid based detection has thus become a method of choice for analysis of Helicobacter spp. in chronic inflammatory gastrointestinal (GI) tract diseases and cancers. Pancreatic exocrine cancer, with few established risk factors and very poor prognosis, is a common cause of cancer death. Previously, serological studies found an association between H. pylori and pancreas cancer (PC). Methods: Pancreatic tumour specimens of patients with PC (n = 40), tissues of chronic pancreatitis (n = 6), pancreatic adenoma (n = 8), and benign pancreatic tissue of patients with cancers of the choledochus, colon and duodenum (n = 6), were analysed by semi-nested Helicobacter-specific 16S rDNA PCR. Stomach (n = 23) and gallbladder (n = 12) specimens of the PC-patients were also analysed. were characterized by DNA-sequence analysis. Results: The Helicobacter spp. PCR was positive in 19 of 40 (47.5%) pancreas cancer patients, and in the pancreas in 4 of 6 (66.7%) patients with chronic pancreatitis. Adenoma and pancreas tissues of other GI-tract cancers, as well as gallbladder specimens, were all negative. Four of 23 (17.4%) stomach samples of the PC-patients were Helicobacter positive with sequences homologues to H. bilis by BLASTn analysis. DNA-sequencing of 13 PCR-products amplified in PCs were closely related to H. pylori (n = 9), H. flexispira sp. (n = 3) and H. cinaedi (n = 1). Two pancreatitis PCR-products matched H. pylori. Conclusions: Helicobacter spp. were common in PC compared with benign pancreatic tissue.",

The aim of this study is to show that Hp is involved in human disease in a more complicated way, producing an abnormal immunologic profile. Patients and methods: This work reports the presence of a significant low value of IgG immunoglobulin in 52 pts suffering from unidentified iron deficiency (ID)or iron deficiency anemia (IDA coexisting with megaloblastic anemia(MA), in 12 leukopenic pts and in 3 more pts having thrombocytosis, ITP and polycythemia respectively. The ratio Male/Female was 25/42, and their age ranged from14-80 years. In the blood examination there was a10-fold titre of Hp-IgG type antibody in all, while in 23 there was also a high titre of Hp-IgA type using ELISA technique. The histopathological examination of an antral biopsy showed diffuse corpus gastritis, atrophic gastritis and achlorydria secondary to Hp infection that take place in gastric area. Results: 52 pts had unidentified ID or IDA coexisted with megaloblastic anemia. Serum iron, transferrin saturation, serum ferritin and B12levels were found to be significantly low. All of them had also Hp infection. Their anemia existed for more than 10 years, was unresponsive to treatment and recurrent in nature. Twelve pts with undefined eukopenia (L:3.3 \u00b7 10 9 /l) lasting for at least 8 years, had also an Hp infection. All of our pts had a significantly low value of IgG immunoglobulin. Mean value ranged from 551 to 868 mg/dl(normal value:850-1517 mg/dl). They subjected to eradication therapy. All but one responded well. Conclusions: (1) Hp infection was found to coincide with ID, IDA, MA and leukopenia. (2) The normalization of haematological parameters after eradication started 6 months later. (3) The essential mechanism between the Hp infection and low IgG is unclear and its value remains low and after the eradication therapy. (4) Studies with larger samples should be done for a better evaluation of the Hp infection and it's involvement in human disease. (5) Hp infection acts in a catabolic way for the humans. It must be considered to search for it in haematological conditions of undefined origin.",

Methods: Gastric biopsies, obtained from 210 patients underwent at the endoscopy unit of Srinagarind Hospital, Faculty of Medicine, Khon Kaen University, were diagnosed by culture, rapid urease test (RUT, Pronto dry) and histological examination. A true positive criteria was indicated when culture or both RUT and histology tests were positive. One hundred and fifteen isolates of H. pylori isolates were tested for six antimicrobial agents by disk agar diffusion method. Results: The H. pylori infection rate was 44.3% (93/210). The sensitivity vs. specificity of the culture, RUT and histology were 88.2% and 100%, 95.7% and 98.3%, and 96.8% and 59.8% respectively. The prevalence of H. pylori in gastritis (GT), duodenal ulcer (DU) and gastric ulcer (GU); and gastric cancer (GCA) patients were 41.2%, 57.9% and 70.6%, respectively. The chi-squared test showed that GCA patients were significantly more often infected with H. pylori than GT patients. The resistance of 115 H. pylori isolates to single antimicrobial agent as metronidazole (MTZ), clarithromycin (CLR),ciprofloxacin (CIP), amoxycillin (AML), and tetracycline (TE) were detected in 21.7, 0, 5.2, 1.7 and 0 percent, respectively. The combination resistance to MTZ & CLR, MTZ & CIP, MTZ & AML, MTZ & TE; and CLR & CIP were detected in 1.7, 1.7, 0.8, 1.7 and 0.8 percent, respectively. The 2.5 per cent of H. pylori isolates were resistance to three or more antimicrobial agents. Conclusion: RUT method was highly sensitive and specific and appropriate for routine laboratory use. The correlation of the GCA patients to H. pylori infection was significant difference compared to GT patients. The high resistance rate to metronidazole indicated that the effective for eradication of H. pylori by metronidazole should be considered in the clinical management of H. pylori infection.",

The cagA-gene is usually detected by PCR methods. Publications about phenotypic methods for the detection of CagA are rare. Aim of our investigation was to compare a slightly modified, recently published indirect immunofluorescence test (iIFT) for the detection of CagA with commonly used PCR assays. Methods: H. pylori ATCC 43504 (cagA+/CagA+) was used as positive control strain, ATCC 51932 (cagA+/CagA+) as negative control strain. Nineteen clinical isolates of H. pylori were examined for their CagA-and cagA-status. CagA was detected by iIFT using monoclonal anti-CagA-antibody from mice, which were visualised for immunofluorescence microscopy with FITC-conjugated anti-mouse-antibody from rabbits. DNA was extracted by a standard phenol-chlorophorm procedure after proteinase K treatment of the cells from a 4-day old culture. 7 primer pairs and their published protocols were used: F1/B1 and D008/R008 as the most described primer pairs and further five primer pairs. All tests were performed in duplicate. Results: 4 from 19 (22%) strains were CagA positive in the iIFT, and also cagA positive in each PCR. 13 from 19 (68%) strains were negative in the iIFT. 10 from these 13 were cagA-negative in each PCR and 3 showed varying results in the PCR-assays. 2 from 19 ( 10%) strains could not be interpreted by iIFT, both showed varying results in the PCR-assays.",

Both invasive and noninvasive tests are available to diagnose Hp infection but there is still no single gold standard. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a commercially available anti-Hp IgG ELISA kit for the primary diagnosis of Hp infection. Materials and methods: A total of 185 patients who were referred to our endoscopy unit were included. According to our gold standard, a patient was classified as being Hp(+) if the culture and/or both histology, rapid urease test were positive and as Hp()) only if all of these tests remained negative. Standard methods were used to calculate sensitivity, specificity, predictive values of positive and negative results and 95% confidence intervals of these values. Results: After excluding patients with discordant results131 of 152 patients (86%) were Hp (+). The sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic accuracy of the IgG-ELISA were 97%, 67%, 93% respectively. Conclusion: Due to it's lack for specificity, we conclude that quantitative anti-Hp ELISA test may not be a suitable alternative for primary diagnosis of Hp in our country, where the prevalence of infection is still very high.",

So, it is important to define whether strains with specific genotype are associated with the clinical outcome. The aim of this study was to determine the distribution of the cagA, cagE and vacA subtypes of Hp in patients with various gastroduodenal diseases in Turkey, and to explore the association between genotype and the clinical outcome of infection. Methods: 93 strains of Hp were isolated from cultures and pathological archives of 30 patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD), 30 with duodenal ulcer(DU) and 33 with gastric carcinoma. The cagA, cagE and vacAs1a/s1b, m1/m2 genotypes were determined by polymerase chain reaction methodology. Results: There were no statistically significant difference among three different clinical outcomes according to the positive rates of vacA s1b, s2 and vacA m1/m2. But the positive rates of vacA s1a, cagA and cagE were 66.7% (20/30), 50% (15/30) and 26.7% (8/30) in NUD; 93.3% (28/30), 83.3% (25/30) and 66.7% (20/30) in DU; 87.9% (29/33), 84.8% (28/33) and 81.8% (27/33) in gastric cancer group, respectively, showing statistically significant difference (p = 0.015, p = 0.002, p = 0.001, respectively). The prevalence of vacAs2 and m2 in NUD patients was higher than that in duodenal ulcer group, but this difference was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Helicobacter pylori cagA, cagE and vacAs1a genotypes have a significant relation with duodenal ulcer and gastric carcinoma in Turkish population. There were no statistically significant association of the vacA s1b, s2 and vacA m1/m2 strains among disease groups.",

Recovery of the patients will be accelerated, if clarithromycin be added to therapeutic protocol. The objectives of this study are: 1-Rapid detection of the susceptible or resistant strains of Helicobacter pylori to clarithromycin, in patients with dyspeptic by FISH technique. 2-Comparison of the results of FISH & Epsilometer test ( E-test) techniques. Methods: Frozen -sections of gastric biopsies of 50 patients with dyspeptic were hybridized in situ by 5 fluorescent oligonucleotide probes (FISH). The prepared slides were examined under a fluorescent microscope, after staining with DAPI. Also, susceptibility and resistance of isolated strains of H. pylori to clarithromycin were determined by E-test. Both results of E-test and FISH techniques were compared in final. Results: 25 out of 50 examined gastric biopsy samples were positive for H. pylori by FISH. Out of these 25 H. pylori strains, 17 strains (68%) were susceptible, 6 strains (24%) were resistant and 2 strains (8%) were mixture of susceptible and resistance strains to clarithromycin. This study showed no significant different between FISH and E-test results, in view of number in susceptible or resistance strains. Conclusions: Since the patient gastric biopsies are not routinely cultured in the most of clinical laboratories, also, for isolation of H. pylori, it is needed to enriched and selective media and the other way, clarithromycin is an expensive drug, so, it looks like that FISH technique is a suitable method for replacing of the culture, antibiotic sensitivity test and or E-test method.",

H. pylori gastritis could proceed, over time, to atrophic form of gastritis a serious disease that increases the risk of peptic ulcers and gastric cancer. A new test panel was developed for nonendoscopic diagnosis of atrophic antrum and corpus gastritis from a blood sample. Aim: To investigate whether atrophic gastritis can be diagnosed and typed non-endoscopically if the serum levels of pepsinogen I (S-PGI) and gastrin-17 are assayed in connection with H. pylori testing. Materials and methods: The study population consists of 50 selected dyspeptic outpatients with (cases) or without (controls) advanced (moderate or severe atrophic gastritis) who underwent a diagnostic gastroscopy for dyspeptic symptoms. Of the 50 selected patients,28 (cases) had an advanced atrophic gastritis or a resected stomach. Of these 28 cases, 4 had an advanced antrum-limited atrophic gastritis, 6 had resected antrum,15 had a corpus limited advanced atrophic gastritis. Two patients had an advanced atrophic gastritis in both the antrum and corpus (multofocal atrophic gastritis) and the whole stomach was removed in one patient. The controls comprise 22 patients of whom 10 had a non atrophic H. pylori gastritis; the antrum and corpus were normal and healthy in 12 patients. The sample for \u00d4postprandial\u00d5 gastrin -17 (S-G-17 prand) was taken 20 min after a protein drink. The S-G-17,S-PGI and IgG class antibodies to H. pylori were determined using ELISA methods. Results: A low S-PGI (<25 mg/l) was found in 15 of 18 patients (83%) with and in 2 of 32 patients (6%) without corpus atrophy. A low S-G-17 prand (<5 pmol/l) was found in all 4 patients with H. pylori associated antral-atrophy and in 5 of 7 patients (71%) with resected antrum but in one of 10 patients (10%) with H. pylori-related non-atrophic gastritis. The mean values of both S-G-17 prand and S-PGI decreased with increasing grade of antral and corpus atrophy respectively. Among all patients with atrophic gastritis,24 of 28 patients (86%) had a low S-PGI and/or a low S-G-17 prand with positive IgG H. pylori antibodies. Such low values were found only in one of the 22 (4.6%) control patients.",

Vuraler (Erzurum, TR) Objectives: Helicobacter pylori are extraordinary among bacteria in their ability to colonize the human gastric mucosa, an inhospitable acidic environment, and to stay on there for long periods as decades in despite of host immune and inflammatory responses. In this study, we aimed to research where H. pylori are found within the stomach by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Methods: Gastroscopic biopsy samples from patients suspected with gastritis or peptic ulcer were processed for both of PCR and TEM. The presence of H. pylori in biopsy samples was investigated with PCR method by using specific 23 S ribosomal RNA primers. The samples for electron microscopic examination were fixed in 3% glutaraldehyde, postfixed in 1% osmic acid, dehydrated in acetone, and embedded in Araldite. Plastic blocks of positive samples for the presence of H. pylori confirmed by PCR were cut with a Nova LKB Bromma ultratome. Thin sections were stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and examined by using a Jeol 100 SX transmission electron microscope. Results: We observed that cross-and longitudinal-sectioned H. pylori within the mucus layer overlying gastric epithelium, in the intercellular spaces between gastric epithelial cells (figure 1), and between two microvilli protruding from the apical surface of an epithelial cell into the gastric lumen. Apart from the extracellular H. pylori, we found also intravacuolar H. pylori within the epithelial cells of the gastric mucosa. We observed H. pylori engulfed by pseudopod-like structures at the apical part of the epithelial cells. There were also late endosomal vacuoles containing H. pylori within the deeper cytoplasmic parts of the cell.",

In this study we reviewed gastroscopic and histological records of patients who underwent gastroscopy for multiple reasons in a tertiary hospital in order to evaluate the frequency of H. pylori colonization in biopsy specimens and to examine the association between H. pylori infection and histological findings. Methods: The medical records of 251 patients who presented to the General Hospital \u00d4Agios Andreas\u00d5 in Patras, Western Greece, during the period 2002-03 for upper gastrointestinal complaints and other specified symptoms were reviewed for the presence of H. pylori. All patients have been submitted to endoscopy with biopsy mainly of the gastric mucosa. The statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS. Results: Gastroscopies and biopsies were undertaken in 251 patients (149 men, 102 women; mean age 58.5, range 16-95 years). In 140 (59.1%) of the patients dyspepsia was the main indication for gastroscopy, followed by 44 (18.6%) patients with anaemia, 12 (5.1%) patients with black faeces and 11 (4.6%) patients with reflux. Usual macroscopic findings were oedema (70%), hyperaemia (50%), erythema (22.3%), ulcer (16.8%) and erosions (7.5%). The histological examination revealed chronic gastritis in 209 (83.3%) subjects (in 39% of mild form, in 50% of moderate and in 11% of severe form), atrophic chronic gastritis in 8 (3.1%) and adenocarcinoma in 10 (3.9%) patients. The overall colonization of H. pylori was detected in 80 (34.2%) subjects. In case of H. pylori positive patients, chronic gastritis was found in 15.4% of mild form, in 61.5% of moderate and in 23.1% of severe form, whereas in absence of H. pylori infection the histological type of chronic gastritis was 52.5%, 43.2% and 4.3% respectively. In case of chronic gastritis of severe form H. pylori colonization was found in 75% (p < 0.001), whereas regarding the mild form H. pylori presence was observed only in 14% (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The study reveals that H. pylori infection is strongly associated with the severe form of chronic gastritis. Thus, for the optimal management and treatment of the patients with gastritis a biopsy of the mucosa appears to be necessary. Objective: The ultimate aim of the study is to explore potential natural products as alternative for treatment of infections from Staphylococcus aureus including methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The specific objective of the paper is to assay for molecular changes in the genes of MRSA isolates upon inhibition by natural products. Five genes of MRSA isolates study include mecA, mecI and mecRI adaB and sav1017 and the non-MRSA isolates were adaB and sav1017 genes. The adaB gene encodes for methyltransferase activity for DNA repair mechanism while the sav1017 is the cell wall protein gene. Methods: MRSA and non-MRSA isolates were obtained from patients receiving treatment in Malaysian hospitals. These isolates were subjected to growth in methanol extract of marine seaweed. Inhibition assay of extract on isolates including several genera of the gram-negative bacteria, were determined by the disc diffusion and minimum inhibitory (MIC) methods. Treated and untreated isolates inhibited by extract were subjected to PCR amplification, followed by commercial sequencing, RT-PCR assay of the mRNA followed by sequencing of the cDNA and BLASTN analysis with the GenBank sequences. Results: The inhibition assay of methanol extract showed activity only in MRSA and non-MRSA isolates but not in gram negative isolates. The nucleotide sequences changes were seen in four genes of treated MRSA isolates which were the mecA, mecRI, mecI and the adaB. The nucleotide changes in non-MRSA and MRSA were only seen in the adaB gene but not the sav1017. The BLASTN analysis showed variation in nucleotide changes in all genes involved in MRSA phenomenon. Conclusions: These preliminary results utilizing genomics for study on nucleotide sequences of pathogen can aim at utilizing the biomolecules from natural products to target the affected nucleotides so as to inhibit growth of the organism. The research activity has the potential of speeding up drug discovery programme and the nucleotide changes in several genes treated with the extract indicates the potential target sites of the extracts. The inhibitory effect of extract on the nucleotide of some genes remained unchanged in the PCR and RT_PCR assay, indicating selective effect of extracts on the genes and the extracts has the potential to be applied as antibacterial agents. Implication of the findings is directed towards discovery of antibacterial drug target sites, which warrants further study.",

In two cases, multiple toxins were found (PVL + tst + entC and entB + entK + entQ + etA). Conclusions: While epidemic cMRSA strains often can presumably be identified due to their resistance profile (methicillin, tetracycline, fusidic acid), there is no easy method to detect PVLpositive, methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. Therefore, strains carrying PVL are more common than previously suspected.

This MRSA is responsible for community-acquired infections (c-MRSA) and harbours the determinant for the Panton-Valentine leucocidine (PVL).As there are descriptions of c-MRSA possessing the PVL throughout the world with different MLST types we wanted to characterize eleven c-MRSA from our area possessing the gene for Panton-Valentine leucocidine. Methods: The isolates were found from 1999 until the summer of 2004, the gene encoding PVL was verified by PCR.We determined the PFGE pattern, the MLST type, the SCCmec type and the agr allele type of the eleven isolates. Results: So far all isolates belong to the ST 80 which has been also described elsewhere in Germany and in France but differs from the types found in the US (1 and 8) or in Australia (30 and 298). They possess a SCCmec element of type IVb and the agr3 allele type. All isolates were resistant to oxacillin, which was determined by mecA PCR, and all were resistant to fusidic acid. Only two were additionally resistant to erythromycin. No resistance could be found to fluoroquinolones.The average age of patients was 47 years and they all had severe communityacquired abscesses of the skin or soft tissue that caused hospital admission. Conclusion: MRSA cannot be longer considered as affecting only hospitalized and elderly patients but we should also be aware of them in community-acquired infections. accessory gene regulator (agr), and its locus of S. aureus is a quorum-sensing gene cluster of five genes (hld, agrB, agrD, agrC, and agrA) that upregulates production of secreted virulence factors, including the alpha-, beta-, delta-hemolysins, and downregulates production of cell-associated virulence factors. S. aureus strains can be divided into 4 major agr groups (agr I-IV) on the basis of a polymorphism in agrD and agrC. The purpose of this study is to know the proportion of agr I, II, and III polymorphisms and to compare clinical characteristics between group II and non-group II polymorphism of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains in a tertiary care teaching hospital in Korea. Methods: Isolates were identified as S. aureus by conventional methods. Susceptibility to methicillin was determined by the NCCLS guideline. Agr locus was identified using restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) analysis of agr BDC amplicons with DraI digestion. The factors assessed included the patients' demographics, comorbidities (diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, dialysisdependent renal failure, cirrhosis, malignancy, and alcoholism), infection site (central catheter-related bacteraemia, bacteraemia of unknown origin, device, endocarditis, intraabdominal, respiratory, skin, urine, and ear), receipt of mechanical ventilation and operation, the presence of nosocomial infection and treatment failure, creatinine level, and mortality. Results: A total of 18 strains from 18 MRSA-infected patients (7 males and 11 females) were evaluated. Their mean age was 50.5 \u00b1 24.3 years old. There were 4 (22.2%), 12 (66.7%), and 2 (11.1%) strains in agr group I, II, and III polymorphism, respectively. Only nosocomial infections were statistically significant clinical parameter according to univariate analysis (p = 0.009) and multivariate analysis (OR, 22.0 (1.540 ) 314.292); P, 0.023). Conclusion: Agr group II was most prevalent in this study and nosocomial infections were correlated with group II polymorphism. This result suggests virulence and nosocomial spread of MRSA strains are originated from group II polymorphism. A recruit of more strains will increase and clarify the clinical difference between agr groups.",

Methods: The glycopeptide resistance of 20 Staphylococcus aureus strains from our strain collection including well-known resistant strains (ATCC 700788, ATCC 700789, ATCC 700698, ATCC 700699) was examined. We compared: (i) zone sizes of Vancomycin 5 lg and Teicoplanin 30 lg Neo-Sensitabs (Rosco Diagnostica) when prediffused for 2 h (with disc) + 18 h (without disc) on Mueller-Hinton and BHI, both media supplemented with 5% horse blood, (ii) agar dilution MICs (iii) zone sizes around Cefoxitin 60 lg Neo-Sensitabs. The inoculum used was McFarland 0.5 and the plates were incubated for 24 h at 35\u00b0C. Results: Regression lines were prepared and there was a good correlation between MICs for vancomycin and teicoplanin and the corresponding zone sizes. All hVISA/VISA/GISA strains tested showed zones less than 15 mm with Cefoxitin 60 lg and zones \u00a3 21 mm (teicoplanin) and/or \u00a3 23 mm (vancomycin) on MH Blood Agar, corresponding to MICs > 2 lg/ml for both antimicrobials. On BHI agar the zones were \u00a3 17 mm (teicoplanin) and/or \u00a3 21 mm (vancomycin) for the hVISA/VISA/GISA strains corresponding to MICs > 4 lg/ml for both antimicrobials. Conclusion: Zones obtained by agar diffusion methods using prediffusion with Vancomycin and Teicoplanin Neo-Sensitabs correlated with MICs and predicted hVISA/VISA/GISA strains. For screening high resistance to Cefoxitin (zones <15 mm) may be used to select strains for further testing in a daily routine laboratory. The system should be evaluated further in the routine diagnostic laboratory.",

Methods: Brain heart infusion agar plates containing vancomycin (5 lg/mL) (BHIA-VA5) were using for vancomycin resistance screening. Minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of vancomycin was determined on both BHIA and the standard Mueller-Hinton agar (MHA) on screened-positive isolates. For strains with MICs equaled to 8 lg/mL, characteristics including population analysis, susceptibility to triton X-100 induced autolysis, van gene and pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) typing were further performed as previously described. Background: MRSA isolates with decreased susceptibility to glycopeptides (GISA) have been reported worldwide since 1997. Most strains were isolated from catheters and other foreign bodies in patients treated with glycopeptides. We aimed to determine the prevalence of GISA isolates in a Belgian hospital where MRSA has been endemic for many years. Methods: All MRSA isolates collected between 09/98 and 06/ 04 were screened for reduced susceptibility to glycopeptides on Mueller-Hinton agar and 5 mg/L teicoplanin (MH-teico) as recommended by the CASFM. The macromethod Etest (BHI agar, 2 McFarland (MF) inoculum, 48 h incubation) was performed as secondary screening for all isolates which grew 4 colonies on MH-Teico. GISA/h-GISA phenotypes were confirmed by E-test MIC determination on MH agar with 0.5 MF and 24 h incubation as well as by vancomycin (V) and teicoplanin (T) population analysis profiles (PAP). All confirmed GISA/h-GISA isolates identified were compared by PFGE to other strains identified in Belgium in order to delineate their clonality. Results: Among 520 MRSA strains (from 468 patients), 14 isolates showed growth on MH-Teico and 8 of these (from 7 patients) yielded a positive macromethod E-test (MIC 8 lg/ml for V and T). Seven were confirmed by PAP as h-GISA and one as a GISA (T MIC: 32 lg/ml; V MIC: 8 lg/ml). Origins of the isolates were: lower respiratory tract (4), urine (2) and wound (2). All h-GISA strains had a similar antibiotic resistance phenotype by disk diffusion (gentamicin, rifampin, erythromycin, clindamycin, ofloxacin) . By molecular analysis, the h-GISA/ GISA isolates clustered in two different PFGE groups A (n = 6) and G (n = 1). The A PFGE group was previously described in h-GISA isolates in Belgium. In this study, it was subdivided in 2 types, both including 3 strains. One PFGE type resulted in a small outbreak in 3 patients during a stay in ICU. All 5 other isolates were sporadic with no apparent geographic or temporal relationship between cases. Conclusion: GISA/h-GISA were found in only 7 out of 468 (1.5%) MRSA-positive patients. None of them presented with severe infection nor had any previous known exposure to glycopeptides. In view of the low prevalence of GISA/h-GISA in our hospital, screening should not be performed systematically but rather on an individual basis taking into account clinical data and risk factors. Whenever the occurrence of GISA is considered, Teico-MH agar appears as a suitable first screening approach.",

Objective: To evaluate the impact of early PO conversion to LZD in patients receiving traditional IV therapy for methicillinresistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections. Methods: Patients with documented MRSA infection between 2001 and 2004 were evaluated in a matched case-control study. Cases included patients who were converted to PO LZD from IV Table 1 includes comparisons of cost, duration of therapy and LOS. Predictably, patients receiving LZD in the hospital had higher drug costs; however, a decreased LOS contributed to a $7000 lower cost of hospitalization. LZD or IV vancomycin (VANC) , and controls were patients who received only IV VANC. Patients were paired in a 1:2 ratio of cases to controls and matched based on infection type, age and comorbidities. Demographics, antimicrobial agents, concomitant infections, and clinical status were assessed daily from the onset of infection through the end of treatment or hospitalization. Antibiotic cost, length of stay (LOS), and clinical success rates were compared between the groups. Results: 78 patients were assessed. Demographic characteristics were similar between groups. Average age (mean \u00b1 SD) was 46 \u00b1 14; APACHE II (median, range) was 6 , Charlson comorbidity score 2 [0] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] , and 60% were male. 55% of patients were treated for skin/soft tissue infection, 19% pneumonia, 13% bone/joint infections, 11% bacteraemia, and 2% other infections. Clinical and microbiologic outcomes were similar between groups, with 100% clinical success at the end of therapy. Objectives: To compare the efficacy and safety of linezolid (LZD) with those of vancomycin (VAN) for the treatment of infections caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in Japan. Methods: This was a randomized, open-label study conducted in Japan. Patients with nosocomial pneumonia, complicated skin and soft tissue infections, or sepsis syndrome, caused by MRSA, were randomized (2:1 LZD: VAN) to receive LZD, 600 mg q12 h, or VAN, 1 g q12 h. Outcomes were evaluated at end of therapy (EOT) and at a follow-up (FU) evaluation 7-14 days after completion of therapy. Results: 151 patients received study drug (100 LZD, 51 VAN); the treatment groups were similar with regards to demographics and risk factors. At EOT, clinical success rates in the MRSA-microbiologically evaluable population were 62.9% and 50.0% for the LZD and VAN groups, respectively; microbiologic eradication rates were 79.0% and 30.0% in the two groups, respectively (p < 0.0001). At FU, the clinical success rates were 36.7% for both groups, and the microbiologic eradication rates were 46.8%, and 36.7%, respectively. Clinical success rates in both groups reflect an automatic outcome of failure for patients receiving prohibited antimicrobials prior to FU. Reversible anemia (13%) and thrombocyotopenia (19%) were reported as adverse events more frequently in LZD patients. Analysis of laboratory data showed that platelet counts decreased more frequently in LZD patients with recovery by FU. The mean platelet count in LZD patients with an adverse event of thrombocytopenia was 101,000/mm 3 . Significantly low platelet counts (<50,000/mm 3 ) were more frequently observed in VAN patients (6 % vs 3%). No difference was observed in mean changes in hemoglobin levels between the treatment groups.",

The objective of the present analysis was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of linezolid compared with vancomycin in the treatment of cSSTI due to suspected MRSA infection from the German perspective. Methods: A decision-analytic model was developed to examine the costs and outcomes of using linezolid versus vancomycin in hospitalized patients with cSSTI in Germany. An expert panel of German physicians experienced in treating cSSTI provided resource-utilization data through structured interviews. Costs from published sources (Rote Liste, DKG-NT, EBM) were applied to clinical and laboratory tests, adverse events, isolation procedures, intravenous (IV) or oral (linezolid only) drug treatment, hospitalization by ward type (medical, intensive care), and outpatient physician consultation. If appropriate, patients could be discharged from hospital and treated in an ambulant setting. The model assumed 50% of suspected MRSA patients had proven MRSA. Outcomes included total costs per patient, cost per death avoided, cost per life-year gained, and cost per cure. Results: An additional 4.4% of patients treated with linezolid (98.4%) versus vancomycin (94.1%) were cured. Average total cost per episode was 9352 versus 9474 for linezolid-versus vancomycin-treated patients, giving a 121 saving per episode. The model was sensitive to the LOS in hospital, days in isolation, duration of oral versus IV treatment, percentage of MRSA patients, and price of linezolid. Conclusion: In this decision analytic model, more patients with cSSTI due to suspected MRSA achieved clinical cure in the linezolid group compared with the vancomycin group. Linezolid was cost saving versus vancomycin for the treatment of cSSTI. Linezolid resulted in a shorter treatment duration and shorter LOS that offset the higher acquisition cost of linezolid versus vancomycin in cSSTI in Germany.",

We studied the frequency and the type of these differences in the fields of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology. Methods: We reviewed all abstracts from the first session of 7 out of 15 major research categories presented in the 1999 and 2000 ICAAC. For each selected pair of ICAAC abstract and related full paper published in journals indexed by Index Medicus, two independent investigators performed a comparison of all data in the abstract and the corresponding information in the published paper. Using Cox logistic regression models we analysed variables for association with differences of data. Results: From 190 abstracts that were reviewed, 68 (35.8%) were subsequently published as papers by March 2004. From them, 52 referred to the same study period and population for both the abstract and the paper. Differences between data presented in conference abstracts and published papers were found in 28 out of 51 pairs which were analysed further (54.9%, 95% C.I.: 41.2%-68.6%). The identified differences were related to the numbers and/or rates of the studied patients (11/28), numbers or rates of isolates (9/28), MICs values or Ki values (5/ 28), other chemical properties of antibiotics (2/28), odds ratio (1/28), and duration of observation (1/28). The differences were substantial in several pairs. Time to publication of full paper was found to be independently associated with presence of differences (p = 0.029, OR = 2.043 per year), while the research category, type of presentation (oral or poster), number of publications of the presenting and last author, impact factor of the journal, and country of origin were not.

Our objective is to train healthcare professionals and students in PK/PD and in a correct implementation of guidelines, since this could help to improve antibiotic use in both short and mid-terms. Methods: We developed a PK/PD -guidelines course on CD-rom, targeted to both physicians and pharmacists but also usable by students. The course was prepared by a team of 2 pharmacists, 1 clinical microbiologist, and 1 pharmacologist. Sources of information were (i) textbooks, review papers and primary papers by internationally recognized experts (ii) materials presented at training workshops of the International Society for Antiinfective Pharmacology (ISAP; www.isap.org) during the last 3 years, (iii) national and, if not available, international guidelines for the management of respiratory tract or urinary tract infections.

Methods: The study included hospitalised patients with CT evidence of bronchiectasis and presenting an acute exacerbation by P. aeruginosa, isolated in sputum. Microbiological findings, clinical data and treatment recommendations were recorded at admission and at the end of therapy. Patients completed daily diary cards for symptoms and PEF values. Patients were followed for 1 year. Results: Twenty-two patients (14 men, mean age 57.3 \u00b1 14.5) with bronchiectasis and P. aeruginosa infection were included. During hospital stay, patients were treated with at least two susceptible antipseudomonal drugs, according to the antibiogram (usually beta-lactam plus aminoglycoside) for a period of 16.9 \u00b1 1.6 days. An oral macrolide (azithromycin 250 mg x 3 days/week in 10 patients, clarithromycin 500 mg daily in 12 patients) was further administrated for 4.9 \u00b1 1.9 months. At the end of long-term therapy, 11 (50%) patients showed no evidence of P. aeruginosa in sputum, 8 (36.3%) patients still presented P. aeruginosa in sputum and 3 (13.6%) discontinued the treatment after less that 1 month because of adverse events. All patients had a significant reduction of sputum volume (83.3 ml/day before therapy vs. 22.5 ml/day at the end of therapy, p = 0.03) and of the mean number of exacerbations during follow-up (2.4 in the previous year vs. 1.2 in the follow-up year, p = 0.01). An increase of the mean PEF value was also noted, although statistically not significant (373.2 \u00b1 43.5 l/min before therapy vs. 489.2 \u00b1 23.5 l/ min at the end of therapy, p = 0.3) Conclusion: These observational findings suggest that macrolides may have a role in modulation of P. aeruginosa colonisation in patients with bronchiectasis.

Main reasons for hospitalization in young adults were: hypoxia (PO2 < 60) 59 patients, PORT high severity risk class (IV-V) 13 patients, empyema 9 patients, and/ or shock 7 patients. Young patients were more frequently current smokers (63% vs 22%, p < 0.001). Comorbid conditions were more common in older patients (20% vs 66%, p < 0.001), mainly diabetes mellitus, COPD, and chronic heart disease. Multilobar pneumonia was more frequent in young patients (56% vs 32%, p < 0.001).

Garau (Terrassa, E) Background: Mortality in patients with severe CAP has been traditionally related to microorganism virulence and to host characteristics. Recently, there has been an increasing interest host-pathogen interaction, and inadequate immunologic response has been shown to be associated with a higher mortality. Immune modulation concomitant to antibiotic therapy has been postulated to improve outcome. The aim of our study was to determine the risk factors for increased mortality in patients with severe CAP and to evaluate the impact of administration of corticosteroids in outcome. Methods: We reviewed the charts of all hospitalized CAP patients in our centre between October 2001 and December 2003. Severe CAP defined by Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) categories 4 and 5 were included. Data on demographics, comorbidity measured by Charlson score, bacterial aetiology, the presence of immunosuppression, COPD, ICU admission, antibiotic therapy, use of corticosteroids and mortality were recorded. Results: Of the 375 severe CAP patients included, 258 and 117,were categories 4 and 5, respectively. 256 patients(69%) were treated with standard antimicrobial therapy and116 (31%) received also corticosteroids. Mean age (78 vs 77), Charlson score (2.5 vs. 2.6), neoplasm (22% vs. 21%), HIV (0.7% vs. 0.8%), chronic liver disease (9% vs.7%), diabetes mellitus ( 19% vs.22%), ICU admission (4% vs. 4%), monotherapy (63% vs. 66%), and aetiology (S. pneumoniae 34% vs. 36%; L. pneumophila 3% vs.2%; others 8% vs.11%; unknown 54% vs.51%) were similar. Patients receiving corticotherapy had been exposed to another immunosuppressive treatment more frequently (6% vs. 12%; p = 0.04), COPD was commoner ( 20% vs. 66%; p < 0.001) and mortality was higher (5% vs. 11%; p = 0.03) than in the group not treated with corticosteroids. In multivariate analysis, severity of disease (OR 3.1; IC95% 1.3-7.1; p = 0.07) and the use of corticosteroids (OR 3.3; IC 95%, 1.3-8.0;p = 0.009) were found to be related to mortality.

Garc\u00eda-Alegr\u00eda (Marbella, E) Introduction and objectives: Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP) is a prevalent and important disease, with an important consume of resources at Hospitals. Our aim is to study the profile of income patients with CAP diagnosis, the year of introduction of levofloxacin in our centre and compare the length of stay in order to different antibiotics treatments, adjusting the results by Fine's scale. Methods: In our hospital (a second level hospital in Marbella, Spain) all the diagnosis at discharge are codified and included in the hospital database, so, all the diagnosis of CAP between September 2001 and March 2002 were collected, and clinical reports were examined. Demographic data were registered, so were all the parameters affecting Fine classification, antibiotic treatment, intensive care unit (ICU) incomes, deaths and length of stay. Results: 129 cases of CAP were found (86 males, 43 females), with a mean age of 67 years (ys)-CI 95%: 64-70), no difference between gender. 4 patients (pts) were living in a residence. 11 pts (8.5%) had a previous diagnosis of Heart Failure -HF-(mean of age 78 vs 66, p < 0.005) and other 11 pts had Cerebrovascular disease -CVD-(mean of age 80.7 vs 66, p < 0.01), 12 pts had Chronic hepatopathy, 15 -11.5%-any form of cancer, 23-17.8%-pts Chronic renal failure (mean of age 74 vs 66, p = 0.049), 41 pts (32%) Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). 3 pts were admitted at ICU and 3 deaths were registered. Blood cultures were collected in 30% of cases, culture of sputum in 21%, Legionella antigen in urine in 13.2%. In according with Fine's classification the patients were stratified in group I (10.9%), II (16.3%), III (22.5%), IV (27.9%) and V (22.5%). In 40% cases corresponding to Fine I and II levofloxacin was used alone, vs 19% in Fine III, IV and V (p=0.021). When length of stay was analysed in patients Fine I and II, the use of levofloxacin was associated with a non significant reduction (MEAN + SE: 5.86 + 2.7 days vs 7.67 + 4.9 days), in people on groups III, IV and V use of levofloxacin do not showed any reduction of length of stay (6.67 + 5.06 days in people using levofloxacin vs 6.11 + 4.5 days). No readmissions in relationship with recurrent CAP was registered. Conclusions: In our experience, use of levofloxacin is associated with less severe CAP, in which a non significant reduction in length of stay is observed.",

The aim of this study was to demonstrate the superiority of the ketolide telithromycin (TEL) to other first-line, oral, single-agent antibiotics (comparators, COMP) in achieving clinical cure in outpatients with mild to moderate CAP in geographical areas of high pneumococcal resistance (erythromycin resistance rate \u2021 30%). Methods: Patients with clinical and radiological evidence of CAP were randomised centrally to receive either TEL 800 mg once daily for 7-10 days or COMP (chosen by the investigator in accordance with local treatment guidelines/practices). Efficacy was assessed post-therapy (Days 17-21). Clinical outcomes in this open-label trial were validated by three independent experts who were fully blinded to treatment assigned. Results: Of the 505 patients enrolled, 482 were included in the modified intent to treat (mITT) and 438 in the per protocol (PP) efficacy analyses. In the COMP group, 39% of patients had received macrolides, 44% beta-lactams and 17% fluoroquinolones. Resistance to penicillin and erythromycin among Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates was 28% and 31%, respectively.

The developed protocol included: 1. Abandoning of antibiotic prophylaxis of VAP; 2. Intrusion criteria of early diagnostics of VAP; 3. Exclusion of 1st, 2nd and 3rd generation cephalosporines , aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones as empiric therapy of VAP; 4. Cefepime (APACHE II <20) or carbapenems (APACHE II >20) were used as initial empiric therapy of VAP; 5. Efficacy of antibiotic treatment was evaluated within 48 hours; 6. Carbapenems and/or vancomycin was added if initial therapy was inefficient. In the case of suspected diagnosis of VAP microbiological analysis of bronco-alveolar lavage fluid (BAL) was performed. A widespread use of broad spectrum antibiotics shifted the structure of nosocomial pathogens. We observed decrease of MRSA rate and significant increase (more than 10 times) in rate of Klebsiella pneumoniae (from 0.6 to 18.1%, most of strains were resistant to 3rd generation cephalosporines) and in rate of Acinetobacter baumanii (from 1.2 to 12.3%, most of strains were resistant to ceftazidime). Conclusions: Introduction of strict antibacterial protocol in patients with multiple trauma and VAP results in significant decrease of attributive mortality without any change in incidence of VAP.",

The groups were compared by age, sex, volume of transaction, severity of disease. In a studied period is from 2001 to 2003 two main regimens of antimicrobial prophylaxis were used: ceftriaxone 1-2 g IV once before operation or cefuroxime 1.5 g IV before operation and additional dosage 0.75 mg in 2-3 hours after surgery beginning; then prophylaxis were conducted after operation during 48-72 hours. Data were compared by Fisher exact; we determined about significantly differences between groups when p < 0.05. Results: Preoperative prophylaxis by cefrtiaxone was administered more often in pneumonia group than in patients without infection complications (56.3% vs. 33.3%, NS).

The dosage used in clinical studies is 1000 mg Day 1/500 mg Day 8. In vitro studies have determined dalbavancin MIC90s of less than or equal to 0.06 mg/L for target bacteria, principally staphylococci and streptococci, including isolates resistant to other antibiotics. The plasma protein binding of dalbavancin is 93%. As skin infections occur in extravascular space, antibiotic concentrations are assessed in blister fluid as a measure of skin penetration and to obtain pharmacokinetic observations that may correlate with efficacy. Methods: A Phase I, open label, single-dose study was conducted in 9 healthy subjects. Subjects were administered a 1000 mg IV dose of dalbavancin. Blisters were induced by applying 0.25% cantharidin ointment to the skin. Blister fluid was collected prior to dose, and at 12 hours, Day 3, Day 5 and Day 7. Blood samples were collected throughout the study. Blister fluid and plasma were assayed for dalbavancin using a validated LC-MS/MS method and pharmacokinetic parameters were determined. Area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) was determined for blister fluid (AUCbf) and plasma (AUCp) through the first week. The degree of penetration into skin was determined by AUCbf/AUCp (%). Results: Dalbavancin was well tolerated with no serious adverse events; most adverse events were mild and self-limited. Maximum observed dalbavancin blister fluid concentrations were achieved by the first collection (12 hours) and concentrations were maintained above 30.3 (\u00b14.4) mg/L through Day 7. The mean (SD) AUCbf and AUCp were 6438 \u00b1 1238 and 10806 \u00b1 1926 mg h/L, respectively. Skin penetration was approximately 60%. Dalbavancin blister fluid concentrations were maintained well above MICs throughout the treatment interval, even when considering the possible effects of protein binding. Conclusions: Blister fluid concentrations are maintained well above MICs of cSSSI target organisms for a week following a single dose of dalbavancin. These data support a once-weekly regimen and are consistent with the efficacy observed in clinical studies.",

The purpose of these studies was to determine which pharmacokineticpharmacodynamic (PK-PD) measure is most strongly associated with drug response and to examine the relationship between drug exposure and response for LMB415 against Haemophilus influenzae (HI). Methods: Two wild-type HI strains (MIC 2 and 8 mg/L) were studied. The hollow-fiber system (HFS) was inoculated with approximately 10E7-10E8 CFU/mL in log-phase growth. Simulating human pharmacokinetics (t \u00bd = 2 hours), bacteria were exposed to escalating free drug LMB415 exposures (AUC ranging from 0 to 200 mg \u00b7 h/L) using a dose fractionation study design and delivering drug q12 hours, q24 hours, and by continuous infusion (CI). Serial samples were collected to determine bacterial counts (CFU/mL) and drug concentrations. Drug effect was quantified as the log 10 ratio (LR) of the 24 hour area under the bacterial growth/kill curves for drug and growth control (LR = log 10 AUCdrug/AUCgrowth control). Results: Overall, the greatest activity (at 6xMIC) was seen with the CI regimen (CI > Q12 >> Q24). Due to the short half-life, dosing q24 hours yielded no net kill compared to baseline. Neither per cent time above MIC, AUC:MIC ratio, nor peak:MIC ratio could co-model the q12 and q24 hour regimens with CI results. Separating these into 2 datasets (q12/24 vs CI), only the AUC:MIC ratio could adequately describe the CI results (Emax LR of (2 at an AUC:MIC ratio \u202150). The q12/24 dataset was reasonably fit by the AUC:MIC ratio and per cent time above MIC (Emax LR of (2 to (3 at an AUC:MIC ratio \u2021120 and per cent time above MIC of \u202150-60%, respectively). The peak:MIC ratio was not informative. Conclusion: For intermittent dosing regimens, per cent time above MIC and the AUC:MIC ratio adequately described drug response. Percent time above MIC and the AUC:MIC ratio associated with maximal decline were \u202150-60% and \u2021120, respectively. CI regimens could not be co-modeled with intermittent regimens, suggesting that neither per cent time above MIC nor the AUC:MIC ratio completely described drug effect.

The purpose of this study was to compare the probability of achieving bactericidal exposures for commonly used intravenous antibiotics against the bacteria most commonly implicated in nosocomial pneumonia. was high, target attainments for FEP, CAZ, and TZP decreased, but carbapenem target attainments remained the same regardless of pathogen prevalence. Conclusions: Target attainments were greatest for IPM and MEM, followed by higher doses of FEP, CAZ and TZP. Because these antibiotic regimens provide optimal bactericidal exposure, they would be most suitable for the empiric treatment of nosocomial pneumonia along with an anti-MRSA antibiotic until pathogen identification and susceptibility results are available. Minimal Inhibitory Concentration effect (SME) of 6 antibacterial agents against two strains of B. anthracis. Methods: The PA-Sub MIC and SME were determined by exposing the bacteria to antibiotic concentrations 10 times the MIC for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. Following repeated washings and centrifugations to remove the antibiotic, cultures were divided into four tubes. To three tubes, the tested antibiotic was added to make a final concentration of 0.5 MIC, 0.25 MIC and 0.125 MIC to the fourth tube no antibiotic was added. Optical Density was determined before exposure, immediately after washing and then hourly up to 9 h. For the determination of SME, the same procedure was performed except that the organisms were not pre-exposed to any antibiotic. The ODs were converted to CFUs by using a standard curve. The PA-Sub MIC was defined as PA-Sub MIC = Tpa ) C, where Tpa is the time for cultures previously exposed to an antibiotic and then reexposed to different sub-MICs to increase 1 log 10 above the counts determined immediately after washing and C is the corresponding time for the antibiotic unexposed control.

Results: The dissolution of penicillin V from Taropen preparation after 30 minutes was 100%, independently on method applied. In case of Ospen tablets these values were different, depending on the analytical assay. The statistical Fisher-Snedecor test for comparison of dissolution data obtained using three methods was performed. The Fisher Fcalc. value was lower than theoretical only in Taropen case. The dissolution profiles of two examined preparations were also compared and statistically evaluated according to the FDA method.

These indices are limited due to the innate inaccuracy of the MIC and the fact that it does not reflect the in vivo scenario where concentrations are not static but fluctuate between doses. An alternative is to use time-kill curves that follow bacterial killing and growth as a function of time and concentration. This study provides a systematic comparison of MIC and kill-curve approaches to show the potential of both methods for antibiotic evaluation.

Combinations of beta-lactamase inhibitors (BLI) and beta-lactam antibiotics like broad-spectrum penicillines (BSP) have antibacterial activity against most of the common pathogens in severe necrotising pancreatitis. Co-administration leads to an increase of antibacterial activity due to an inhibition of beta-lactamases compared to those of beta-lactam antibiotics alone. Some BSP has been shown to penetrate rapidly and efficiently into pancreatic tissue. The penetration of BLI into inflamed pancreatic tissue has not been investigated yet. Methods: Addressing the penetration capability of BLI, a clinical trial was designed to investigate the penetration of Tazobactam (Taz, n = 8) and Sulbactam (Sul, n = 5) in patients with severe necrotising pancreatitis undergoing pancreas surgery. Samples were taken from blood, necrotic areas of pancreatic tissue (PN), peripancreatic fatty tissue (PFT) and bursa secretion (BS) following intravenous administration of 0.5 g Taz or 1.0 g Sul. Concentrations of BLI were determined by HPLC/ UV. The aimed concentration for full enzymatic effect of BLI should be 4 lg/mg (Taz) and 8 lg/mg (Sul), respectively. Results: Mean plasma concentrations at 1.0 h after application were 20.6 \u00b1 9.58 lg/ml (Taz) and 48.6 \u00b1 18.8 lg/ml (Sul Background: UTI is one of the most common infectious conditions treated in general practice and represents a major part of Abstracts antibiotic use in the community. It is of major importance to know, how we treat these infections correctly, i.e. maximum efficacy with the least amount of drug in order to reduce the risk of development of resistance. Materials and methods: UTI was induced in anesthetized female NMRI mice via intraurethral inoculation of 10-8 CFU of E. coli. One day later, treatment was started with 12-24 hour dosing schedules with 12-16 different doses of each drug securing a wide variation of Time > MIC and AUC/MIC. 24 h after the last dose mice were sacrificed and urine collected, and the bladder and both kidneys removed. Bladder and kidneys were homogenized before CFU determination. The drugs used were the cephalosporins, cefuroxime (CEF, MIC = 0 3 mg/l) and ceftriaxone (CRO, MIC = 0.094 mg/l), and the penicillin, mecillinam (MIC = 0.1 mg/l). The PK of the drugs in serum was determined in similar mice as well. The two cephalosporins were studied together (CEF has a t \u00bd of 14 min and CRO a t \u00bd of 56 min, respectively, in mice). PD parameters were calculated from serum total antibiotic concentrations, since protein-binding is a minor issue in the urine, and the relation to CF\u00da s estimated by the Hill-equation.",

Normal distribution of parameter values and no correlation between K and V were assumed. System noise was incorporated as a linear function of drug concentration. Using these concentration-time profiles, the best-fit parameter estimates were determined by the standard two-stage method. Four methods were subsequently used to simulate the AUC0-inf of the population by MCS, using the central tendency and dispersion of the following in the subject sample: (1) K and V; (2) clearance and V; (3) dose/clearance; (4) AUC0-inf.

Animal models are key to investigating in vivo antibiotic concentrations that prevent selection of resistance (e.g. the mutant prevention concentration (MPC) concept), but use of such models requires validated procedures for extraction and analysis of fluoroquinolones from relevant tissues. Here, we report the validation of a method to quantify the concentration of enrofloxacin, and its metabolite ciprofloxacin, extracted from chicken liver, caecal contents and serum following treatment with Baytril TM (enrofloxacin). Methods: The extraction procedure described by Wiuff et al. 2002 was validated for fluoroquinolone analysis, in pig tissues, by fortification of target matrices with enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin. Norfloxacin was added as an internal standard to all samples. Samples were homogenised and extracted with acetonitrile (6 ml), centrifuged and the supernatants retained for analysis. The extracts were diluted with distilled water and analysed by HPLC equipped with fluorescence detection. The analytes were chromatographed on a C18 reverse phase column and eluted with an isocratic potassium phosphate buffer/ acetonitrile system. Results: Liver samples were fortified with 0.1, 1.0 and 5.0 lg/g enrofloxacin and provided recoveries of 114.5, 78.6 and 78.2% respectively. Quantification of ciprofloxacin at the 0.1 lg/g level was not possible due to interference from sample co-extractives, but the recoveries at 1.0 and 5.0lg/g were 73.7 and 91.1%. For caecal content samples, enrofloxacin recoveries were 70.6 and 69.1% at 1.0 and 5.0lg/g respectively, and ciprofloxacin 65.4 and 63.3%. The recovery from serum was much higher, samples fortified at 0.1, 1.0 and 5.0lg/mL, enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin yielded recoveries of 94.7, 80.9 and 86.1%, and 91.1, 85.6 and 87.9% respectively. Selected samples were also analysed by zonal microbial growth inhibition bioassay and HPLC equipped with MS/MS detection; the data were broadly similar between all methods. Conclusion: A valid method for the analysis of fluoroquinolones in chicken liver, caecal content and serum has been established, and will be applied to in vivo MPC studies. Where sample matrices interfere (e.g. liver, caeca), bioassay or LC-MS/ MS must be used to provide valid results.",

Low levels of both interleukines released from KB cells and fibroblasts infected by P.g. were found only after addition of tetracycline up to 10 lg/ml. Metronidazole, moxifloxacin and tetracycline in subinhibitory concentrations enhanced the release of IL-6 from non-infected and A.a.-infected fibroblasts (up to 3200 pg/ml) after 18 h, contradictory 100 lg/ml tetracycline and minocyline reduced the release of IL-6. IL-6 in the supernatants of KB-cells was detectable only after addition of 100 lg/ml moxifloxacin. Each 100 lg/ml of tetracycline and minocycline suppressed totally the release of IL-6 and IL-8 from non infected and infected fibroblasts, but not from KB cells. Metronidazole and moxifloxaxin in high concentrations promoted the release of IL-8. Conclusions: Antibiotics influence the release of IL-6 and IL-8. Besides the good antibacterial effect especially minocycline might suppress inflammation. Nevertheless, the killing of bacteria as well as a possible inhibition of virulence factors (bacterial proteases of P.g. by tetracycline) might influence the enhanced or reduced release of these cytokines.",

Four years later a novel graft was needed, after the development of end-stage hepatic insufficiency due to massive HCV re-infection. One year later (while of cyclosporin treatment), abdominal pain and ascites formation prompted admission, and M. tuberculosis sensible to all tested drugs was repeatedly isolated from an abdominal fluid with an elevated lymphocyte-monocyte count. Associated ethambutol, isoniazid, streptomycin and levofloxacin (this one replaced by cycloserine after 2 months), led to a complete clinical and bacteriological cure already achieved after 3 months, although a 3-drug anti-T treatment was continued for 1 year. Conclusionas: In our rare case report, the selected anti-T chemotherapy showed a successful efficacy and tolerability profile, with contained untoward events despite a very critical clinical context, due to the severity of T complication, and the broad spectrum of problems related to graft and all associated issues. In order to obtain an early diagnosis, an elevated clinical suspicion should be maintained for this rare complication too, by recommending microscopy and culture search of mycobacteria on ascitic fluid. Methods: From January 2000 through December 2001, a prospective cohort study was conducted to determine the rate of bacterial nosocomial infection in renal transplant recipients. The patients were divided in two groups according to the origin of the allograft: cadaver or living donors. Enterobacter cloacae strains, the most prevalent multidrug-resistant bacterial organisms isolated from UTI were determined using genomic analysis with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results: One hundred sixty-three patients who received renal transplants were reviewed during the hospitalization. One hundred and ten (67.5%) renal transplanted were from cadaver and 53 (32.5%) from living donor. The median of length of stay in hospital was 12 days (range, 9-75 days) from transplant of living donor and 26 days (range, 2-28 days) from transplant of cadaver (P < 0.0001). Twenty-one (39.6%) living donors recipients and 68 (61.8%) cadaver donors recipients had bacterial infection episodes (P = 0.019). Post-transplant nosocomial infections diagnosed during the hospitalization were UTI (44.8%), SSI (11%), pneumonia (6.1%), bloodstream catheter-related infection (4.2%) and others (1.8%). Risk factors for UTI in the multivariate analysis included cadaver donor recipient; substitution of the initial immunosuppressive regimen; days of urinary bladder catheterization and length of stay in hospital before the infection. Substitution of initial protocol of the post-transplant immunosuppressive regimen and the surgeon was also associated with SSI. Six different E. cloacae multidrug-resistant to antibiotics DNA profiles were detected in UTI of our recipients and hospital dissemination was documented.",

C. parvum causes self-limiting diarrhoeal illness in immunocompetent hosts and severe long standing diarrhoea in immunocompromised patients. Sclerosing cholangitis (SC) caused by C. parvum is frequently found in HIV-infected patients. In the transplant recipients only two case reports exist describing SC due to C. parvum; one in an adult renal transplant patient and the others in three children who underwent liver transplantation. We report herein the first case of C. parvum associated cholangitis in an adult liver transplant patient. This 52-year-old male patient underwent a liver transplantation three years prior to presentation. His initial transplant failed due to acute rejection requiring retransplant within one year. The second transplant was complicated by sepsis, tacrolimus induced hemolytic uremic syndrome, leaving the patient hemodialysis dependent. In 2004, he presented with pruritus, hypotension, severe dehydration and a three-week history of severe diarrhoea. Endoscopic biopsy revealed numerous organisms in the stomach and changes in the colon consistent with cryptosporidiosis. Stool cultures were negative. In addition, gamma gluytamyl transferase and alkaline phosphatase were elevated while bilirubin and AST were normal. The patient was diagnosed with colitis due to cryptosporidium and treated with azithromycin. Immunosuppression with tacrolimus was continued. The patient continued to have diarrhoea, low-grade fevers and fatigue. Two weeks later a cholangiogram and liver biopsy were performed. The liver biopsy revealed C. parvum lining the ductal epithelium. SC was diagnosed. The cholangiogram showed no sclerosing changes in the biliary tree, suggesting an early phase of disease. Paromomycin was added to the regimen. The patient improved, and was discharged home. We believe this to be the first case of SC associated with C. parvum in an adult liver transplant recipient. Objective: Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6) infection usually occurs during the first 2 years of life, and its prevalence is higher than 95% in adult population. Negative serostatus for HHV-6 in solid organ transplant recipients is a risk factor for fungal infection, but the incidence and severity of HHV-6 infections in seronegative patients has not been evaluated. Our objective is evaluate prospectively seronegative HHV-6 solid organ transplant patients for HHV-6 infection by means of quantitative PCR for HHV-6. Methods: From February to August 2004, we prospectly evaluated all solid organ transplant patients. Patients must have a minimum follow-up of 3 months. Patients underwent basal determination of IgG for HHV-6. Seronegative patients were included for follow-up. Blood samples were obtained at 7, 14, 21, 28, 45, 60, 75, and 90 days post-transplant. For viral DNA analysis, following DNA amplification, it was determined by hibridation in microplaque (Affigene). Results: In the study period, 112 patients were evaluated (58 kidney, 35 liver, 11 heart, 4 kidney and pancreas, liver and kidney 2, pancreas 1, heart and kidney 1). Nine patients were seronegative (7 kidney, 1 liver, and 1 heart). We analysed 67 plasma samples. All patients but one had a negative PCR for HHV-6. The patient with primary infection had a maximum of 78,002 HHV-6 DNA copies/ml. Clinically, the patient suffered from slight abdominal pain and discrete cholestasis in blood analyses; no fever or serious complications were detected. He did not receive pre-emptive treatment with Ganciclovir. No fungal infections were detected. Conclusion: Primary infection by HHV-6 in seronegative solid organ transplant patients is not frequent, and in 1 patient it appeared with slight symptoms. However, a larger study with more seronegative patients is needed.",

To evaluate the impact of an automatised DNA extraction method and a lower cut-off on PCR sensibility. Methods: All patients were monitored until day 100 post-SCT with weekly antigenaemia and PCR. A total of 562 blood samples from 30 patients (23 mieloablative and 7 non-mieloablative; 25 HLA identical siblings and 5 from unrelated donors) were tested prospectively. Twenty-seven CMV seropositive patients (or negative with a seropositive donor) received high dose of acyclovir as prophylaxis. PCR was considered positive when more or equal 600 DNA copies/ml were detected. Antigenemia was considered positive when one or more positive cells were detected (in 2x105 PMNs). Positive samples by antigenaemia and/or PCR (n = 54 samples) were tested retrospectively with an automatised extraction method (MAGNAPURE). Results: All CMV seronegative patients with a seronegative donor (n = 3) were antigenaemia and PCR negative. Seropositive patients (n = 27): 14 had a positive antigenaemia and/or PCR, with a total of 23 CMV infection episodes. None developed CMV disease. PCR detected 10 out of 23 CMV episodes. Overall there were 44 positive antigenemias (belonging to 13 patients): 23 were PCR+, 20 PCR negative and 1 PCR inhibited. Only 1 patient had a positive PCR with a negative antigenaemia. Automatised MAGNAPURE extraction increased the sensibility of the PCR. With this method PCR detected 19 out of 23 episodes in contrast with only 10/23 with the manual extraction. For samples with less than 600 DNA copies/ml a manual calculation of the number of copies was retrospectively done (using a new cut-off of 50 copies/ml). With this lower cut-off, PCR detected 20 out of 23 CMV episodes. None of the negative patients by antigenaemia and/ or PCR gave a positive result with the automatised extraction method or with the lowered cut-off PCR.

Response to antifungal agents is poor, mortality is high and immunological recovery is the most important factor for a favorable outcome in patients with trichosporonosis. We present the first case of T. beigelii infection in patients undergoing allogeneic BMT in Iran. A 12-year-old female presented with aplastic anemia, cough and fever.

Results: In 1981 the trichinellosis prevalence was 8.7% in Nuuk and 23.8% in Ammassalik district, while the prevalence in 1998 was 5.2% in Nuuk and 19.8% in Ammassalik district. Persons living in the settlements of Ammassalik district had higher Trichinella-specific antibody prevalence than persons living in the town of Tasiilaq. The following risk factors were significant in a univariate analysis: Ethnicity, age, place of living, dietary habits, intake of seal meat, and hunting. A multivariate model was constructed consisting of the variables: Ethnicity, age, place of living, diet group, intake of seal meat, and hunting. The variables were removed stepwise in the following order: seal meat (p = 0.73), hunting (p = 0.36), age (p = 0.3), and ethnicity (p = 0.16). The final multivariate model consisted of diet group and place of living, both being significant. Thus, living on a Greenlandic diet and living in the settlements in Ammassalik district implied higher relative risk of being Trichinella seropositive than living on a diet dominated by imported food items and living in Nuuk. Conclusion: As lifestyle in the settlements is more traditional compared both with Tasiilaq and Nuuk, these results indicate that the decline in human trichinellosis cases in the 19th century most likely reflects the transition from traditional greenlandic lifestyle to more western dietary habits.",

Material and methods: 100 patients with surgically proven pulmonary hydatid cysts were enrolled for study. We reviewed clinical findings and imaging of patients. The radiological features (localization, diameter, architecture, density and other radiological signs and appearances) were determined. Results: On CXR 124 cysts were determined. On 82 available CT scans a total of 112 cysts were detected. No discrete cyst was detected on 11 CXR. On 82 available CT, a total of 112 cysts were detected and in 5 CT scans no cyst was detected. 57 cysts were ruptured and 25 patients with ruptured cysts had hemoptysis. Single cysts were in 63 patients while multiple cysts were in 37. Median CT density was 24HU. Respectively, it was seen on CT and CXR waterlily sign in 18 and 22 patients, Air-fluid level in 12 and 17 patients and cresent sign on 11 and 5 of patients. Inverse cresent sign and calcification were not observed on CXR s but each one was recorded on 4 CT scans. On CT scan 90% of Cysts were smooth and 89% were uniloculated. 19% of cysts were infected. Conclusion: CT scan should be done to elucidate cystic nature of the lung masses and for accurate localization in the preoperative period. In endemic regions like Iran, atypical imaging presentation of complicated pulmonary hydatid disease such as solid masses should be considered in differential diagnosis of pulmonary lesions (abstract truncated at 250 words)",

Echinococcosis is a major problem in all regions of Turkey but particularly prevalent in rural areas, where domestic livestock raising is common. The reported epidemiologic findings are usually based on retrospective evaluation pf surgical findings or hospital charts. Well planned epidemiologic studies are limited. In this study our aim was to analyse the seroprevalance of cystic echinococosis and prevalance of lesions (with abdominal ultrasonography) in a group of young adult university students who were staying in a state hostel in Bornova-Izmir-Turkey. Method: The study group consisted 750 students (360 woman, 390 men, aged 20.92 \u00b1 1.82, min 17, max 29). Informed written consent was received from each student and they were requested to fill a questionnaire form. Blood sampling was performed by IV puncture and sera were obtained after centrifugation. Anti Echinococcus granulosus antibodies were detected by using ELISA tecnique. All participants were gven an appointment for abdominal ultrasonography. Results: Of 750 students 99 (13.2%) were seropositive for anti Echinococcus granulosus Ig G (table 1). A total of 250 students (49 seropositive-201 seronegative) were performed abdominal ultrasonography (3.5 MHZ transducer, Sonoline, Elegra-Siemens).

Our findings suggest that cystic echinococcosis is prevalent in Turkey and epidemiologic studies combining ELISA and abdominal ultrasonograpy are warranted. Objective: Anthrax is an epidemic zoonosis in Eastern part of Turkey. This study was aimed to investigate the epizootiology and epidemiology of anthrax in this region. Methods: Animal and human anthrax cases during 1992-2004 period were included in this study. Data were obtained formal records of Health Directorate, Institute of Veterinary Control and Investigation. The diagnosis of anthrax had based on clinical findings and/or microbiological procedures, including Gram strains and culture of materials obtained from lesions. Results: In a 13-years period, 464 animal cases and 503 human cases with anthrax were detected. Of 464 animal cases, 20 (4.3%) were sheep, others (95.7%) were cattle. Most cases occurred between July and September in both animals and humans. Anthrax was seen most frequently in Erzurum, which is the important centre for animal commencement. When the first 6 years period (1992) (1993) (1994) (1995) (1996) (1997) was compared with last 7 years period (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) ) the number of animal cases were 161 vs. 230 and human cases were 234 vs. 269. An analysis of the yearly case distribution shows that the incidence of anthrax in this region had not been changed. Conclusion: Anthrax is an important health problem both animals and humans in this region. The preventive measures should be taken for decreasing the incidence of anthrax. Objectives: Anthrax is endemic in Kazakhstan and occurs among humans at an incidence rate of 0.1 to 1 per 100,000 population per year. During the late 1990s, several epidemics occurred associated with home slaughter of infected animals, and a general increase in incidence was seen among animals and humans. Historically, Kazakhstan accounted for 15% of the anthrax cases reported from the Soviet Union; and the plains of Central Asia may have served as the historical source of B. anthracis for the rest of the world. In Kazakhstan, the geographic distribution of anthrax among animals and humans is focal and generally associated with areas considered to be \u00d4high-risk\u00d5. The determinants of this focal distribution are poorly understood. In addition, strains of B. anthracis isolated from outbreaks within these foci have not been compared on a molecular or pathogenic basis. Methods: Work has been initiated to study the geographic distribution and potential environmental preferences of B. anthracis using geographic information system (GIS) technologies. Results: The GIS was used to map a set of B. anthracis strains from several outbreaks between 1997 and 2003 to evaluate geographic patterns. The GIS is also being used to derive a historical database of spatially explicit human and livestock outbreaks from 1948 to 2003 for spatial analyses on the nationwide distribution of B. anthracis. This database contains information on the location of the anthrax incident, the year and month of the occurrence, whether the incident involved livestock or human, the outcome of the disease, and biological information about the strains. Conclusions: Although in a preliminary stage of application, the ArcGIS software can be used to map loci of anthrax occurrence. In the future, these maps will be used to identify factors that influence the occurrence and spread of the pathogen and to prevent infection of livestock or humans.

Until the 1990s, anthrax in Kazakhstan was an occupational disease in animal husbandry. After 1991, the practice of raising livestock for private use increased. This report shows that, at the same time, the incidence of anthrax in persons involved in this practice increased significantly. Methods: In order to characterize the epidemic process, we used methods of descriptive epidemiology, using epidemiological variables (who became ill, where and when, trends of disease by time, sources, transmission factors of B. anthracis, and the age, gender, and occupation of persons who become ill with anthrax). Results: Anthrax occurs in rural areas among private owners of livestock and their families and persons hired to assist with the slaughter. In the last decade, 89.4% of cases of anthrax illness in humans were caused by the slaughter of domestic livestock. Of these cases, 62.2% were unemployed rural residents, 2.3% were shepherds working for cooperatives, 11.7% were blue-collar workers, 5.4% were white-collar workers, and 18.1% were students. A single source, path and factors of transmission of B. anthracis are typical of this type of the disease. In recent years, the majority of cases involve infection of several persons during the slaughter of a single diseased animal. The source of infection is cattle in 48.2% of cases, sheep and goats in 15.7% of cases, horses in 31.2% of cases, and soil in 4.7% of cases. The factors of transmission of B. anthracis to humans are contact with the meat of livestock during slaughter and butchering in 91.9% of cases, vector-borne transmission in 2.7% of cases, and soil in 5.4% of cases. A large number of human cases occur in July through September. Conclusion: In Kazakhstan today, the prevalent sub-type of anthrax disease in humans involves non-professional activity at home. This requires changes in the tactics of preventing the disease. The research described in this abstract was Objectives: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infection caused by a novel coronavirus known as SARS-CoV. During the early phases of the disease, the presence of the replicative intermediates of SARS-CoV has been shown in PBMC from patients. No information is available on the ability of SARS-CoV to stimulate IFN induction, although IFN-gamma may be activated in SARS patients. We investigate the capability of SARS-CoV to give rise to a productive infection in normal PBMC, in parallel with the ability to activate IFN-alpha andgamma gene expression. Methods: Normal PBMC were infected with a MOI 0.1. Virus progeny formation was measured at subsequent time points, by back-titration of cell lysates on Vero cells. Cell mortality and apoptosis were detected by trypan blue and propidium iodide staining. In order to detect virus-specific plus-and minus-RNA strand, total RNA extracted from SARS-CoV-infected PBMC was retrotranscribed in the presence of the sense and antisense primers, respectively, targeting the replicase gene. Measurement of SARS-CoV genomic RNA was performed by quantitative Real Time RT-PCR. IFN induction was performed by exposing PBMC to SARS-CoV at different MOI, ranging from 0.1 to 10. Induction of IFN-alpha and -gamma was analysed by measuring their mRNA levels by limiting dilution RT-PCR. Sensitivity of SARS-CoV replication to exogenous IFN-alpha and -gamma was tested in Vero cells pre-exposed to the individual cytokines of to a combination of both. Results: In unstimulated PBMC, no infectious viral progeny formation was detected up to day 13 post-infection. Nevertheless, minus-strand and genomic SARS-CoV RNA peaked at 24 hours post-infection. Dose dependent induction of both IFNalpha and IFN-gamma mRNA was observed, that was most evident at MOI 10. A combination of these two cytokines was shown to strongly inhibit SARS-CoV replication in Vero cells.",

            "text": "Our results show that SARS-CoV is able to infect normal PBMC. However, this appears to be only a transient phenomenon, followed by a progressive disappearance of both virus-specific RNA strands, with no infectious virus progeny production. Moreover, SARS-CoV appears to have the intrinsic ability to activate dose-dependently both IFN-alpha andgamma gene expression in PBMC cultures. Our results can be pathogenically relevant to the inflammatory events occurring in the diseased tissues that can be mediated by the endogenous activation of INF system. Objectives: Trichoderma species are potential candidates for biocontrol of plant pathogenic fungi and cellulase producers of biotechnological importance. On the other hand, they are emerging as opportunistic pathogens of immunocompromised and dialized patients. This study was designed to examine the ability of 10 clinical Trichoderma isolates to produce extracellular proteases and to screen them for toxicity to mammalian cells. Methods: Supernatants from induced liquid cultures of the examined strains were screened for proteolytic enzyme activities with 11 different chromogenic p-nitroaniline substrates. Trypsin-and chymotrypsin-like activities were separated by Sephadex G-100 column chromatography and their pH-dependence was studied. Sperm toxicity bioassays were performed by exposing boar sperm suspension to Trichoderma-methanol extracts, the motility of spermatozoa was estimated by phasecontrast microscopy. Mitochondrial membrane damage in spermatozoa was studied by epiflurescence microscopy using the JC-1/propidium iodide staining. Results: The production of trypsin-like, chymotrypsin-like and chymoelastase-like protease activities was common among the examined strains. Separation of trypsin-and chymotrypsin-like activities by column chromatography revealed, that both systems are complex consisting of several isoenzymes. Relatively high activity levels were detected between pH 5 and 9 suggesting that the different isoenzymes have different pH characteristics. More than 90% of the spermatozoa were motile in a non-exposed control sample and in a sample exposed to 5 microliter of methanol. More than 90% of the spermatozoa were immotile in samples exposed to T. longibrachiatum UAMH 9515, ATCC 201044, CM382 and T. harzianum CBS 102174 in a concentration of 1.25 mg biomass ml-1, indicating that these strains produce heat-stable substances toxic to sperm cells. These four strains were found to inhibit the motility of boar spermatozoa even at a low concentration (50% reduction of motility in the case of 5 microgramm ml)1 of extended boar sperm) and to induce dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential. Other studied strains had no toxic effect. Conclusions: Production of extracellular proteolytic enzymes and toxic metabolites are among the potential virulence factors of Trichoderma strains as emerging fungal pathogens.

Long-term follow-up of the epidemiological situation confirms a thirty-year cycle for which there is no satisfactory explanation. Methods: Standard methodology of diagnostics is based on a) subjective sensations in the patient b) objective dermatological finding c) positive epidemiological history d) laboratory demonstrations of causative agent e) remission of symptoms upon specific therapy. Cases of scabies diagnosed and reported by dermatologists nationwide are included by the public health service in the central system EPIDAT (NIPH, Prague). Results: The last two documented epidemic waves of scabies affecting the Czech Republic peaked in 1970 and in 1993. Specific morbidity is the highest among persons 15-24 years of age (it closely connected with sexual activity-the source of infestation in 60% of adults was a sexual partner and that is confirmed by an almost identical trend in reported scabies morbidity and fresh cases of syphilis in 1965-1999 years), but the morbidity trend has been falling sharply after the year 1993. However, morbidity in persons over 65 years of age has been gradually rising over recent years. Group epidemics (86) have been repeatedly reported in such facilities as departments of gerio-psychiatry, institutions for long-term chronic patients, old folks homes, social care institutes and charity facilities. That occurs in bed-ridden subjects hospitalized on a long-term basis, the mentally retarded and the superannuated, in whom the scabies is of a nosocomial character. The affected staff of healthcare institution is very often the source of further transmission to others, namely to immobile patients, as well as to especially vulnerable individuals under higher risk of infection. Analysis of the reported cases revealed a 13% share of healthcare workers in this infection. Under greater risk are senior nurses (62%), junior nurses (21%), auxiliary paramedical staff (13%)and the last of all physicians (4%). Scabies as an occupational disease occurs almost exclusively in the healthcare sector. Conclusions: Scabies poses on increased risk for the younger population (active scabies) and the elderly population (passive scabies). It poses a great occupational risk in the paramedical healthcare staff carrying out nursing or managing services. It is necessary to consistently observe preventive and repressive epidemiological measures in the population.",

Method: An attempt was made to determine the fauna and geographical distribution of soft and hard ticks in this area from October 2002 until April 2004. About 10% of the villages were selected randomly and tick collection was carried out using standard method. Ticks were collected from indoor resting and hiding places in 70 villages as well as inside stables, rodent borrows, on sheep, lamps, goat and cattel by monthly in each season.",

The conditions for HHV-8 transmission are met when i) a child's skin responds to the bite of a blood-sucking arthropods, and ii) an HHV-8-seropositive mother (or caregiver) attempting to relieve the child's itching and to reduce scratching applies her infective saliva to the bite's site. The use of saliva is a traditional behavioural practice in sub-Saharan Africa, for healing with herbal leaves crushed and mixed with saliva and for medical practices and in the premastication of food (Wojcicki JM, 2003 , Br J Cancer 89:2016 . The human behaviour associated with the transfer of saliva from parents to infants and the use of herbal leaves treated with saliva in relation to arthropod bite could be a risk factor for HHV-8 infection and perhaps other infections too (such as the hepatitis B virus). Methods: To evaluate to what extent saliva is used to heal insect bites on children's and adolescents\u00d5 skin, we draw up a questionnaire directed at students of elementary and intermediate school. Two groups were tested, one from Italy (a school near Rome, Latium, and schools in Veneto) and one from a sub-Saharan African country known for high transmission levels (Uganda, between Kampala and Entebbe by Lake Victoria). Results: The frequencies of the use of saliva were not significantly different in Latium (12.5%) and in Veneto (14.6%) so that an average frequency of 13.5% (96 / 712) has been compared with the frequency of 74.8% (119 / 159) from Uganda (P << .0001). The frequencies in the two groups are related also to a different cultural and economic development and improvement in hygiene. Conclusion: We suggest that blood-sucking promoter arthropods can play a role in the spread of HHV-8 infection particularly in Africa. Therefore, a behavioural change limiting the use of saliva on the skin and to prepare herbal leaves, could be an attempt to control the spread of HHV-8 infection. Aim of study -To find out in CSF some baseline markers of inflammation and redox status for the estimation of development tendences and clinical course of pathological process in TBE. Patients and methods: 60 patients with meningeal and meningoencephalitic form of TBE treated at the Infectology Center of Latvia were included in this study. Diagnosis of TBE was confirmed by ELISA, Enzygnost, Anti-TBE IgM in blood and/or CSF. Traditional clinical criteria were used for the characterization of TBE severity degree. Some nontraditional lab methods were used: C-reactive protein (CRP) (immunoturbidimetrically) and reduced glutathione (GSH) concentration (colorimetrically) detection in CSF.",

            "text": "3) The origin of CRP and GSH in CSF is unknown (production in CNS and/or from blood due to blood-brain barrier permeability increasing?). Background: Cholera is a severe disease caused by Vibrio cholerae. The natural reservoir of this aquatic pathogenic bacterium is referred to as the \u00d4aquatic environment\u00d5. Our group showed that egg masses of the non-biting midge Chironomidae spp. (Diptera) harbour V. cholerae and provide nutrient source for their multiplication, thereby offering a new natural reservoir for the cholera bacterium. Objective: The presence of viable V. cholerae on flying adult chironomids will suggest that V. cholerae can be carried through the air to other water bodies by the adult flying insects and hence a new route of infestation of water sources by the bacteria is suggested. Methods: In field studies chironomid egg masses and adults were simultaneously collected from the same environment. In addition fresh, drinking quality water was left exposed or netted in the vicinity of adult chironomid hatching foci. The exposed water was monitored for chironomid egg masses and V. cholerae presence. In the laboratory those experiments were repeated with V. cholerae O9 tagged with Green Fluorescent Protein. Results: To date, more then 30 V. cholerae serogroups have been isolated from chironomids egg masses and adults. In the field experiments, a clear-cut connection between netting and V. cholerae absence was noted implying that a relationship exist, between entrance of large invertebrate to water bodies and presence of V. cholerae in that water. In the laboratory experiments, the GFP tagged bacteria were found on the outer surface of the adult chironomid, in locations prone to microbial attachment. Conclusions: The evidence shown here suggests that aerial transport of V. cholerae by chironomids flying adults is feasible and does lead to V. cholerae contamination of unprotected water bodies. Objectives: Cholera is a severe and potentially life-threatening diarrheal disease caused by certain spices of the gram-negative bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Many millions of cases of cholera occur annually, in epidemic and pandemic forms due to V. cholerae O1 and O139, and also sporadically due to non-O1 and non-O139 V. cholerae strains. In this context, the survival of V. cholerae in nature is of interest from an epidemiological perspective. Although the natural reservoirs for survival and multiplication of V. cholerae are far from compeletly disclosed, our previous study has shown that free-living amoebae can be reservoirs for the seventh-pandemic V. cholerae O1 El Tor-Inaba strain N16961, which can survive and grow intracellularly in Acanthamoeba castellanii.The aim of this study was to examine the ability of different strains of V. cholerae O1 El Tor to grow and survive in Acanthamoeba castellanii, and to examine whether intra-amoebic survival of bacteria alter their pattern of resistance and sensitivity to different antibiotics. Methods: V. cholerae O1 El Tor strains were co-cultured with A. castellanii for more than two weeks. The interaction between these microorganisms was followed by viable counts of alone-and co-cultivated microorganisms. Intra-amoebic growth and localization of each bacterial strain were estimated by gentamicin assay, viable count, microscopy, and PCR to detect cholera toxin gene and amoebic 18s RNA gene disclosing symbiont-host association. Results: The results show that examined V. cholerae O1 El Tor strains multiplied and survived inside trophozoites and cysts of A. castellanii. The bacterial internalization was in cytoplasmic compartment of the amoebae cells. The relation between these microorganisms in co-cultures could be classified as symbiosis, since presence of the amoebae enhanced growth of bacterial strains, and presence of the bacteria did not affect amoebic growth. The intra-amoebic survival of bacteria did not alter their pattern of resistance and sensitivity to different antibiotics such as ampicillin, gentamicin, and tetracycline. Conclusions: This study shows a facultative intracellular behaviour of examined V. cholerae O1 El Tor strains, which is in contrast to the general held view, which considers the bacterium to be extracellular microorganisms. The clinical importance of free-living amoebae is their possible role as \u00d4Trojan horse\u00d5. The genetic variation of VP7 and VP4 antigenic proteins was studied in 38 G4 strains recovered in Palermo from 1985 to 2003. VP7 sequence analysis showed that 14 strains, recovered during 1999-2003, though cross-reacting with G4-ST3:1 MAb, belonged in fact to genotype G9 and were 99% identical to G9 strains recovered in Palermo from 1999. Sequence comparison of 23 G4 strains grouped them into three sublineages (Ia to Ic) containing respectively viral strains collected in 1990-1994, 1995 and 1999-2003 . Amino acid sequences were well conserved within each sublineage and a peculiar single amino acid insertion was observed in the variable region 4 of all sublineage Ic strains. Both G4 and G9 Italian strains exhibited P[8] genotype and their VP4-encoding sequences clustered in previously defined lineages following a temporal distribution: strains collected in 1989-1993 fell within lineage P[8]-1, while those recovered in 1995-2003 clustered in lineage P[8]-3. The variety of their deduced amino acid sequences enabled us to describe, respectively, two (1A and 1B) and six (3A-3F) different patterns of substitutions with regard to lineage P[8]-1 and P[8]-3 reference strains. Comparison of VP7 and VP4 gene sequences of Italian and European G4 strains indicates that different G4P[8] populations have been circulating in Europe over the years and that the latest Italian strains are more closely related to recent isolates from other countries than to the reference vaccinal ST3 strain. These results will help increase knowledge about G4 rotavirus epidemiology and evolution, and might be useful for future rotavirus vaccine formulation.",

All specimens positive for Adenoviruses were confirmed and identified by a PCR-microplate hybridization assay (PCR Adenovirus Consensus, Argene, Biosoft), which used Adenovirus genus-specific primers and one generic and six species-specific probes defined in the VA RNA gene. According to our results: Rotavirus was detected in 63 cases (9.2%), Adenovirus in 15 cases (2.2%) and Astrovirus in 15 cases (2.2%). PCR Adenovirus Consensus assay identified the Adenovirus species from all the 15 cases: Adenovirus species F (enteric Adenovirus serotype 40 / 41) in 11 cases (1.6%), Adenovirus species C in 2 cases (0.3%) and Adenovirus species A in 2 cases (0.3%). Rotavirus gastroenteritis presented a seasonal distribution in spring, while Adenovirus and Astrovirus gastroenteritis presented no seasonality. Conclusions: Rotavirus gastroenteritis was significantly more common than Adenovirus and Astrovirus infections in young children in our territory. PCR Adenovirus Consensus technique was a useful method for the identification of Adenovirus in stool specimens. Eventhought enteric Adenoviruses 40 / 41 (species F) caused the majority of acute gastroenteritis due to Adenovirus, non-enteric serotypes (species A and C) were occasionally involved in the aetiology of acute diarrhoea.

Methods: Through the electronic databases of our Hospital located in a metropolitan area of Northern Italy, informations related to all foreign patients (p) hospitalized or followed by Day-Hospital centres have been collected from January 1999 up to March 31, 2004. After recording all discharge diagnosisrelated group (DRG) codes we focused attention on those regarding Infectious Diseases. Results: Overall discharges were 339051, with 6670 regarding foreign p:a prevalence of the female sex (64.4%) was noticed. In 49.6% of foreign p,the mean age ranged from 20 to 35 years. The rate of foreigners compared with overall admitted p varied from 0.3 of year 1999 to a. maximum of 0.47% of year 2002. A major involvement was borne by Obstetrics-Gynecology (39.3%), Internal Medicine (13.1%), Specialistic Surgery (7.3%), Specialistic Medicine and Pediatrics (7.3% each), and Emergency Medicine (7.1%). When considering Infectious Disease-related DRGs, tuberculosis (142 cases), HIV-AIDS (25), chronic viral hepatitis and related complications (22), septicemia, central nervous system infection, and acute viral hepatitis (12 episodes each), were the most frequent discharge codes followed by other Infectious Disease DRGs (72 cases). The duration of admission of foreign p was very short (1-3 days) in 42.1% of cases,while it reached 4-7 days in 22.6% of p,and 8-14 days in 11.2% of cases, while the mean hospitalization time at Infectious Diseases ward was 8.6 \u00b1 3.2 days (p < .002). Even 549 hospitalizations ended with voluntary discharge which occurred during the first day of admission in 61.8% of p. Discussion: Our pilot study demostrates that the need for health care expressed by foreign p is increasingly frequent and covers a very broad spectrum of disorders with Infectious Diseases-associated illnesses gaining a increasing role through time. A significant problem is represented by the tendency to very short duration of hospitalization for foreign p, often ending with voluntary discharge while admissions carried out at our specialized Infectious Disease ward are significantly more prolonged, although they are expected to give an increased benefit in terms of effective management.",

Introduction and objectives: Change of the characteristics of natural focuses of plague and microbiological properties of plague microbes as a result of consequences of the natural calamity on Aral Sea. Methods: Conventional microbiological research methods were used, when studying microbiological properties of 116 strains of plague microbe from Kyzylkum natural focuses of plague isolated from rodents, ticks and fleas. Results: Strains from the Kyzylkum natural focuses of plague have all determinants of virulence, show characteristics that allow attributing them to the continental variety, i.e. glycerin digestion, do not ferment rhamnose and decompose arabinose; they have nutrient need that is typical for the strains from the Central Asian desert focus. There are differences in the need for amino acid leucine, whereas strains from Ustyurt and Gissar focuses are dependant on it. Out of 116 strains from the Kyzylkum natural focus only 8 turned out to be dependant on luecine. There were identified stains from the Kyzylkum natural focus that had essentially different properties as compared to the majority of isolated cultures, in particular, those can not synthesize fraction 1 of the plague agent; have growth factor of different nature, i.e. lower dependence on phenylalanine. Plague bacteria strains circulating in rodent populations in the Kyzylkum natural focus are characterized by low virulence in white mice and guinea-pig, although they have all the determinants of virulence. When studying resistance to antibiotics, there were identified strains non-susceptible to streptomycin (5%). Conclusions: Thus, studying the properties of the causative agent of plague is of great importance for solving problems of natural focuses and understanding patterns of fluctuations in the epizootic situation in a certain territory. This understanding is an integral part of determining the epidemic potential of natural focuses, and is used in organizing epidemiological surveillance of the infection. Objectives: Toll-like receptors (TLR) play a key role in the recognition of products from virtually all classes of pathogenic organisms. Amyloid peptides also can stimulate the innate immune system. For this reason, we hypothetized that bacterial compounds and amyloid peptides may jointly stimulate the innate immune system. Methods: The interaction of endogenous and exogenous stimulators of innate immunity was examined in primary cultures of mouse microglial cells after application of defined Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists [lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (TLR4), the synthetic lipopeptide tripalmytoyl-cysteinyl-seryl-(lysyl)3-lysine (Pam3Cys) (TLR2) and single-stranded unmethylated Cytosineguanosine (CpG) oligodesoxynucleotide (TLR9)] alone and in combination with amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) 1-40. Supernatants from stimulated glial cultures and unstimulated controls were analysed for nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) production. Results: Co-administration of Abeta1-40 with LPS or Pam3Cys led to an additive release of NO and TNF-alpha. In contrast, coapplication of Abeta1-40 with CpG led to a substantial decrease of NO and TNF-alpha release compared to stimulation with CpG alone. CpG was the only compound investigated, which induced the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Conclusion: The additive effect of LPS and Pam3Cys and Abeta may be one reason for the clinical deterioration frequently observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease during infections. The substantial decrease of NO and TNF-alpha release after CpG and Abeta application compared to stimulation with CpG alone suggests that not all microbial products enhance the stimulatory effect of Abeta on innate immunity. The cause for the divergent behaviour after activation of TLR9 versus stimulation of TLR2 and TLR4 probably lies in differences of the signaling cascade.",

The presence of tissue-antigen HLA-B27 is associated with ReA, and HLA-B27 may be a marker of a prolonged disease course. We designed a case-case comparison study of ReA after gastrointestinal infections caused by Salmonella, Yersinia, Campylobacter, Shigella and E coli, to evaluate the impact of HLA-B27 on attack rate and severity of ReA between these 5 bacteria. Methods: Between January 2001 and November 2002 consecutive patients were included from the Danish Registry of Gastrointestinal Infections, when culture positive for Salmonella, Yersinia, Campylobacter, Shigella, or E coli. All patients were addressed by a questionnaire. In this study ReA includes reactive arthritis and arthralgia. Debut of pain in a previously healthy joint was registered and patients were asked to mark swollen or tender joints on a drawing. A VAS-scale was used for assessment of pain caused by ReA. All patients were encouraged to donate blood samples for serology and HLA-B27 typing (PCR). Results: A total of 2106 patients returned the questionnaire (response rate 67%). Only subjects with mono-infections were included. The male/female ratio was 40/60. Blood samples were obtained from 1558 (74%): Campylobacter (n = 693), Salmonella (n = 503), E. coli (n = 213), Shigella (n = 74) and Yersinia (n = 75). The overall prevalence of HLA-B27 was 9%, corresponding to the rate within the Danish population. Odds ratios for contracting ReA when the individual was HLA-B27 positive were; Campylobacter 1.70 (CI: 0.89; 3.43), Salmonella 3.4 (CI: 1.83; 6.37), E. coli 1.1 (CI: 0.23; 5.04), Shigella 33.5 (CI: 2.48; 452.78) and Yersinia 5.1 (CI: 1.03; 25.68). Thus, HLA-B27 was significantly more frequent among ReA-patients with Salmonella, Yersinia, and Shigella compared to Campylobacter and E coli. The VASscore for ReA was significantly higher in the groups with Yersinia and Salmonella. There was a significant positive correlation between VAS-score and the fractions of patients that were HLA-B27 + .",

Objectives: The normal gut microbiota triggers experimental colitis and large intestinal manifestations of human inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). However, the availability of animal models for the study of ileitis is limited. Thus, only little is known hitherto in small intestinal IBD. Recently, parasiteinduced ileitis in the mouse, mimicking characteristics of ileitis in human IBD, was proposed as a model for Crohn's disease (CD). Oral infection of susceptible C57BL / 6 mice with Toxoplasma gondii induces a severe Th1-type immunopathology, which is restricted to the terminal ileum. In order to unravel the mechanisms underlying ileitis, we used this model to monitor microflora changes during ileal inflammation and determined contributions of the gut microbiota to ileal disease. Methods: C57BL / 6 mice were infected perorally with 100 cysts of T. gondii (ME49 strain). Ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, ciprofloxacin plus metronidazole (each 50 mg / kg body weight / d, p.o.), piperacillin plus tazobactam (200 mg/kg body weight/d, i.p.) were applied from day 0 until day 8 after T. gondii-infection. The ileal bacterial flora was analysed on day 8 p.i. by microbiological and molecular methods (16S rDNA-targeted denaturing gel electrophoresis (DGGE), sequencing of clone libraries). Results: Microbiological and molecular approaches revealed that ileal inflammation leads to an increased total bacterial load and to drastic changes in the flora composition. In the acute stage of disease, the grampositive cocci and rods -predominant in the ilea of healthy mice -are displaced by gramnegatives, identified as Escherichia coli and Bacteroides sp., respectively. Antibacterial treatment (ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, a combination of both, or piperacillin plus tazobactam) ameliorated disease symptoms and reduced ileal inflammation. This was also seen in SPF-mice colonized by only one grampositive bacterial species. Conclusions: The fact that gramnegative bacteria accumulate during acute ileitis and contribute profoundly to intestinal inflammation is well in line with similar observations in experimental colitis and in human IBD. This provides evidence that gut flora modulation is a valuable therapeutical strategy for IBD treatment. Finally, the contribution of gut microbiota to ileal disease supports the use of the parasite-induced small intestinal inflammation as a model for IBD research. Objectives: Pathophysiologic mechanisms that contribute to brain injury in neuroinflammatory disorders include breakdown of the blood-brain-barrier, extravasation of leukocytes, cerebral hypoperfusion and vasculitis. Matrix-Metalloproteinases (MMPs) including the collagenases MMP-2 and -9 are crucially involved in all these steps. In this study we aimed to assess the extent of in-vivo collagenolytic activity in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) by determination of the amino acid hydroxyproline, a major and exclusive degradation product of collagen. Methods: Paired serum and CSF samples from patients with bacterial meningitis (n = 11), aseptic meningitis/encephalitis (n = 17), multiple sclerosis (n = 13), and normal CSF (n = 12) were assessed. Degraded collagen was hydrolysed to dissolve its major component hydroxyproline, which subsequently was determined spectrophotometrically. CSF levels of MMP-2 and -9 were studied by gel zymography. In a rat model of pneumococcal meningitis localization of collagenolytic activity was performed by in-situ zymography with intramolecularly quenched gelatin. Results: Hydroxyproline in CSF from patients with bacterial meningitis was significantly increased compared to all studied groups (P < 0.001) while serum hydroxyproline did not differ significantly between the groups. The amount of hydroxyproline in CSF correlated significantly with the amount of MMP-9 (r = 0.8; p < 0.001). In the rat model in-situ zymography localized gelatinolytic activity to the subarachnoidal and ventricular space inflammation and in association to cortical lesions.",

            "text": "The study documents a significant increase of the collagen degradation product hydroxyproline in CSF of patients with bacterial meningitis. The close correlation of hydroxyproline and MMP-9 in the CSF validates the assessment of hydroxyproline as an index for CSF collagenolytic activity in neuroinflammatory diseases and supports a role for collagenases in the pathogenesis of bacterial meningitis. Introduction: Toxic shock syndrome (TSS), is an acute, noncontagious systemic illness. It is caused by the toxin producing strains of S. aureus and the b-haemolytic streptococci and can occur in any non-immune person exposed to a TSS toxin. TSS is commonly associated with menstruation and tampon use, however can also be related to skin or soft tissue infections, particularly post surgical, skeletal infections or respiratory tract infection. TSS is often non-immunising and recurrent menstrualassociated TSS is well-described. Literature suggests that TSS is extremely rare, but diagnostic difficulties can lead to misdiagnosis and TSS can be fatal if left undiagnosed. We report a series of three cases of TSS, presenting within a short period of time. Case Reports: Case 1. 17 year old female, presented with sudden onset collapse, diarrhoea, vomiting and abdominal pains. She gave no history of menstruation and an initial diagnosis of severe gastroenteritis was made. She failed to respond to conservative management and required ITU support. She was discharged with no firm diagnosis and re-presented one month later with similar symptoms, when a diagnosis of staphylococcal TSS was confirmed. Case 2. 15 year old female, presented during menses with sudden onset rash, rigors, severe diarhhoea, vomiting and abdominal pains. She was diagnosed with staphylococcal TSS on admission. Case 3. 28 year old female. Presented with sudden onset severe diarrhoea, vomiting, pyrexia and rash. She gave no history of menstruation. She responded poorly to treatment, required ITU support, high dose steroids and was eventually diagnosed with streptococcal TSS. Discussion: Diagnostic criteria for TSS include high fever, hypotension, erythematous rash and a complicated multisystem disfunction. Patients often require aggressive management. The Public Health Laboratory Service reports an average of 18 cases of diagnosed TSS in the UK per year. However, because of the uncommon and difficult nature of the diagnosis, many cases are misdiagnosed and therefore go unreported. It is essential to maintain a high level of suspicion for patients who are epidemiologically at high risk, but importantly, also the less ill patient with suggestive symptoms who fails to meet all diagnostic criteria but are in an at-risk group. High morbidity and mortality has been reported for undiagnosed and untreated cases. Objectives: Staphylococcus aureus colonization and infection of burn wounds increases morbidity and delays wound healing of patients suffering from burn wounds. A vulnerable moment in the route of transmission of S. aureus is the exposed burn wound during dressing changes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of dressing changes under laminar flow conditions on burn wound patients with regard to S. aureus colonization. Methods: From the first of February 2003 to the first of June 2003, 25 patients were included in this study at our 10-bed burn centre. In 12 of these patients the dressings were changed under laminar flow conditions. All patients were frequently screened for S. aureus in nose, throat and burn wounds. All S. aureus isolates were genotyped with Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis. Results: At admission 17 / 25 (68%) patients had no S. aureus colonization in their nose, throat or burn wounds. Dressing changes under laminar flow conditions were carried out on 8 / 17 patients of this group. However, 6 / 8 (75%) patients acquired burn wound colonization with S. aureus during their stay at the centre. Six out of 9 patients (67%) whose dressing changes were not carried out under laminar flow conditions acquired burn wound colonization with S. aureus. A total of 12 patients acquired burn wound colonization; these patients also acquired carriage of S. aureus in nose or throat. The same type of S. aureus was carried in the nose or throat as well as the burn wounds in 7 (58%) of these patients.",

Many burn wound colonisations with S. aureus are endogenous in nature. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of eradication of nasal S. aureus with mupirocin in patients with regard to S. aureus colonisation of their burn wounds. Methods: From September 2000 to March 2001, 42 patients admitted to our 10-bed burn centre were screened for S. aureus in nose and burn wounds. Isolates were genotyped with PFGE. All patients received nasal mupirocin at the time of admission to the burn centre. Fifty-five patients from the same unit who were followed from September 1997 till May 1998 and had not received mupirocin prophylaxis served as a historical control group. Results: At admission 29 / 42 (69%) patients in the mupirocin trial had no S. aureus colonisation in their burn wounds. Of this group 25 patients were non-carriers and 4 patients were nasal carriers of S. aureus. Seven (28%) non-carriers and 2 (50%) nasal carriers acquired burn wound colonisation with S. aureus during their stay at the centre. Of the historical control group, 39 (71%) patients had no S. aureus colonisation of their burn wounds at the time of admission. Of this group 31 patients were noncarriers and 8 patients were nasal carriers; 18 (58%) non-carriers and 7(88%) nasal carriers acquired S. aureus wound colonisation during their stay. The overall probability of wound colonisation in the patients treated with mupirocin was significantly lower than in the historical non-treated group (p = 0.01, chi-square test with Yates correction). Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that application of nasal mupirocin to all patients upon admission to a burn centre may reduce but not eliminate the risk of subsequent S. aureus colonisation of burn wounds. Other measures including improved infection control practices and eradication of exogenous S. aureus reservoirs, including S. aureus carriage among healthcare workers, may be necessary to further reduce the incidence of S. aureus burn wound colonisation.",

Frei (Basel, CH) Introduction: S. aureus (MSSA) carriage is common among health care workers (HCWs)and might be associated with type of care provided and other potential risk factors. Transmission of MSSA has been observed by ''cloud adults''. Objectives: To determine risk factors for MSSA carriage in HCWs, and the percentage of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in a tertiary care centre. Methods: Retrospective review of all data of staff health department and the microbiology laboratory. All HCWs who were working in a high MRSA prevalence country were routinely screened at the time they were hired by the institution. In addition, data were generated from MRSA screenings of HCWs if there was evidence for nosocomial transmission of MRSA in patients. MRSA was defined as S. aureus being oxacillin-resistant and expressing the PBP2' and/or being positive for the mecA gene by PCR. Data of HCWs were collected by chart review in a case-report form that included demographic data, work place, skin diseases and other variables. Data were compared by univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses. Results: A total of 3474 swabs were taken from 1217 HCWs between Jan 1997 and Dec.2001. Data were available from 1182 HCWs:50% originated from Switzerland, 27% from Germany, 4% from France, and 19% from other countries. The overall prevalence of MSSA and MRSA was 53% and 1%, respectively. More than one sample was available from 332 individuals: Of the repeat samples, 38% were negative, 32% were negative, but had one single positive culture, and 30% were consistently positive. Sex, profession, work place, number of years at the institution was not associated with S. aureus carriage (p > 0.2). The only significant risk factor for S. aureus carriage was young age, defined <35years (p = 0.02). The prevalence of MSSA increased from 51% (1997) to 63% (2001) . Eight HCWs were carriers of MRSA: they were young and half of the them reported skin diseases. Conclusion: S. aureus carriage among HCWs is common: Only young age remained a risk factor even after adjusting for other variables. MRSA was rare among HCWs.",

Methods: The study included 150 hospital personnel and 150 adults admitted to outpatient clinics of our hospital. Given that a history of hospitalization is the most important facilitative factor for colonization of Staphylococcus aureus we exclude individuals with a history of hospitalization in the preceding year of our study. The specimens were obtained with swabs from the anterior nares-ecological niches of S. aureus-and cultured according NCCLS guidelines. ID 32 STAPH strips were used for identification and confirmed with Slidex Staph Plus kit (both by biomerieux). MRSA strains detection was achieved with Slidex MRSA Detection kit of the same company. Antibiotic susceptibility of MRSA strains was determined with ATB STAPH method (version 2000) according to the recommendations of the producer (biomerieux). Results: Among hospital staff the carriage rates of MRSA and methicillin susceptible S. aureus were 2.7% and 20% respectively. None of the outpatients was found to be a nasal carrier of MRSA. In addition MSSA carriage in this group was 11%. The prevalence of MRSA nasal carriage rate among personnel working in the different medical wards was also examined. The difference in the rates among personnel working in the surgical ward, operating theaters and the rest of the staff was statistically significant (p < 0.001). All MRSA strains were susceptible to oral antibiotics. Conclusions: Although the prevalence of MRSA is low among hospital personnel, education is needed as they are one of most important reservoirs for nosocomial MRSA infections. The low incidence of MRSA infections around the time of the study suggests that with usual infection control practices MRSA spread was avoided. All MRSA carriers were treated with intranasal muripocin for eliminating the nasal carrier status. Continuous monitoring of MRSA carriage is needed to avoid nosocomial spread. AIDS patients are a special population related with high risk of infection due to Staphylococcus aureus. Previous colonization is a recognized predisposing factor for development of infection due to this organism. However, nasal carriage of S. aureus in HIVpatients is still not completely characterized. Objectives: To describe the epidemiological features of community-acquired S. aureus nasal colonization in out care HIVpatients based on the molecular genotypes. Methods: HIV-outpatients without previous hospitalization within the last two years were screened for S. aureus nasal colonization. Three samples from each patient were collected, and the variables associated with colonization were assessed. Nasal carriage was classified as: absent, transient colonization or persistent colonization. The persistent colonization was assessed according to the molecular profiles performed by Pulsed-Field Gel Electrophoresis, in: simple (same profile), multiple (different profiles) or combined (two with the same e and one with different profiles). Results: 111 patients were enrolled in the study. Seventy patients (63%) had at least one culture positive for S. aureus and 99 patients concluded three samples collection. Only one isolate was a community acquired MRSA. The rates of colonization was higher when two or more samples were taken, ranging from 45.5% in the first sample up to 65.6% when 3 samples were collected. HIV-patients with AIDS were more likely to be colonized than non-AIDS patients (p=0.02). Among the patients with S. aureus nasal carriage, 39% were transient and 61% were persistent carriers, whose genomic subtype was: 61.5% simple, 20.5% combined and 18% multiple persistent colonization. Previous use of antibiotics was associated with absence of S. aureus colonization (p < 0.05). Conclusions: HIV out care patients had high rates of oxacillinsusceptible S. aureus nasal colonization. Regardless, the recent literature, only one isolate was community-acquired MRSA. The most common characteristic of colonization is simple persistent colonization showing the same genomic profile. Objectives: S. aureus bacteraemia (SAB) continues to be a major problem related to both community-acquired and nosocomial infection. We undertook an evaluation of a large cohort of patients with SAB to assess features of the infection and predictors of mortality. Patients and Methods: 238 cases of SAB admitted to our hospital (2000-3) were prospectively studied. All patients had at least one positive blood culture for S. aureus and clinical symptoms of bacteraemia. SAB was considered to be nosocomial if the first positive blood culture specimen was obtained > 72 h after admission and there was no clinical evidence of infection on admission. Microbiological studies were carried under standard protocols. Epidemiological and clinical characteristics, antimicrobial treatment and outcome (relapse or mortality) were analysed. Results: 434 cases of SAB were identified but only 238 were prospectively included in the study protocol. Incidence was the highest in year 2001 (4.21 per 1000). Out of the 238 cases, 167 (70%) were male with a mean age of 51 year (SD 24.89 have not yet implemented similar guidelines. This study evaluated the detection and reporting of MLSb results in Staphylococcus using the BD Phoenix TM Automated Microbiology System and BDXpert System with NCCLS, SFM or DIN as interpretative standards. Methods: Comments regarding MLSb resistance as listed in the NCCLS M100-S14 were converted into expert rules. Special BDXpert rules were also constructed for the detection and reporting of MLSb resistance when applying SFM or DIN guidelines. A total of 177 strains of Staphylococcus (146 S. aureus, 12 S. epidermidis, and 19 coagulase-negative staphylococci) were tested in Phoenix panels containing erythromycin (E) and clindamycin (CC). NCCLS, SFM or DIN breakpoints were used to interpret the Phoenix MIC results. The double disk diffusion D-test (E and CC) was used as the reference method for the determination of MLSb resistance phenotypes. Results: The Phoenix E and CC MIC values were interpreted based on the standard selected. The BDXpert rules were executed and applicable expert messages were displayed. The Phoenix correctly detected 38 out of 43 constitutive MLSb (cMLSb) phenotypes as compared to the D-test results. The remaining 5 cMLSb strains were interpreted by the BDXpert as potential inducible MLSb (iMLSb)/efflux phenotypes. A total of 69 iMLSb and 22 efflux phenotype isolates were all reported by the BDXpert as iMLSb/efflux phenotype and the users were alerted to perform D-test before reporting the CC results. The CC interpretation was suppressed in these isolates. The NCCLS, SFM, or DIN showed identical detection and interpretation of MLSb resistant phenotypes by the Phoenix and BDXpert systems. Conclusions: The Phoenix and BDXpert Systems can assist laboratories in rapid detection and accurate interpretation of MLSb results for Staphylococcus. Special messages can be used to communicate timely and accurate information to clinicians for proper therapy of staphylococcal infections with MLSb resistant phenotypes.",

ORSA strains were grouped by the MDR patterns for the 8 primary drugs (47). Conclusions: All newer compounds (LZD, Q/D, DAP and DAL), TEI and VAN were very active against endemic and epidemic ORSA in LAMCs. These S. aureus having MDR patterns (ave.

In the LUMC the species diversity was greater than in the MCA, with five isolates of Staphylococcus haemolyticus found in the first. No difference between the two hospitals was found in activity of the antibiotics tested, except for Li. The MIC90s were as follows: V 2 mg / L, T 4 mg / L, C 16 mg / L, M 2 mg / L, L 8 mg / L. Of Li the MIC90 was 2 mg / L in the LUMC and 1 mg / L in the MCA. According to Dutch guidelines, in total 7 / 71 isolates were found resistant to T and 21 intermediate resistant. All isolates were susceptible for V. Conclusion: The first choice glycopeptide for serious CoNS infections, T or V, has no influence on the susceptibility of CoNS for these antibiotics. According to Dutch guidelines, the activity of T, C, and L against CoNS is relatively low, whereas the activity of M and Le is in the susceptible range.

The specific antibiotic resistance determinants have been checked by PCR (blaZ, mecA, ermA, ermB, ermC, msrA, tetK and tetM). The ability to form biofilms has been determined: (i) by PCR, detecting genes specific for attachment and biofilm development (icaADBC operon, aap, and atlE); (ii) by Congo Red Agar (CRA) plate test to assay the production of polisaccaridic intercellular adhesin (PIA); (iii) by crystal violet (CV) stain to determine the biofilm biomass development on polystyrene microtiter plates; (iv) and by CSLM microscopy observations to investigate biofilm structure.",

In 89% of the population, the CRA test confirmed the correlation between the presence of ica genes and slime expression. The CV assay classified the quasitotality of our strains (97%) as biofilm producers on plastic surface. In addition, the distribution of optical density values (OD540) obtained after CV stain, showed a significant statistical difference in biofilm biomass development between the ica-ADBC-positive strains and the icaADBC-negative ones. Finally, a correlation, although not always present, has been observed between ability of the strains to develop in a high-structureted biofilm and specific biofilm-formation determinants. Conclusions: Analysing the origin of colonization or infection in 6 patients with CoNS isolated from the operative site, the bacteria could only be traced in one patient who developed an infection. Transmission most probably occurred by direct contact. The low level of bacterial contamination in the UCA together with the lack of correlation of genotypes between isolates found in the UCA and in the wounds suggest that airborne transmission does not play a major role in the development of SWI. More than 90% of staphylococci found in air samples were not traceable to any investigated sources. Most probably, they originated from non swabbed parts of the HCW's bodies. Since 50% of the traceable isolates from the UCA originated from non scrubbed team members, protection of the operative site by LFV appears to be suboptimal.",

Genomic profiles have been interpreted according to criteria of Tenover (J. Clin. Microbiol 1995; 33:2223 -2239 . Strains were also characterized by electrophoretic profiles obtained by PCR-based analysis of inter-IS256 spacer polymorphisms. Results: These MRSE represent 41.6% of the total strain of S.epidermidis collected from the neonatology ward during the period of survey. Majority of these strains come from blood sample (75%), other strains from vascular catheter (5%), pus (10%), sound (10%). 17 antibiotypes and 6 genotypic profiles according Tenover criteria were individualized: type A (with 5 subtypes), type B, type C (with 1 subtypes), type D (with 1 subtypes), type E (with 2 subtypes)and type F. A total of four PCR patterns were obtained based on the interpretation criteria that PCR patterns exhibiting more than one band difference were considered to represent distinct types, type 1, type2, type3, and type4. Conclusion: MRSE appear to be endemic and multiclonal with a dominant clone in the neonatal intensive care unit. Our study demonstrates that a significant proportion of MRSE infections may be attributable to transmission among newborns and that certain strain can become endemic over long periods in this setting.",

The aim of our study was to establish if these infections are caused by endemic clone or by incidentally occurring bacterial strains of this species. Methods: Thirteen strains of MRSH according CA-SFM recommendations and mecA+ (Murakami K. J.Clin.Microbiol 1991 , 29:2240 has been collected during the period of survey (april 2004 to october 2004). Eleven strains come from different pathological products of newborns hospitalized in a neonatal intensive care unit of a public maternity hospital. Tow strains come from paediatric and internal medicine wards were used as control to ensure that endemic strains can be differentiated from outbreak strains. All strains were identified with the Api-staph method (Api bioMerieux). Strains have been characterized by genotypage in pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE variety CHEF) after SmaI macrorestriction. Genomic profiles have been interpreted according to Tenover criteria (J. Clin.Microbiol.1995 ; 33 :2223 -2239 . Results: S. haemolyticus was quantitatively the second staphylococci (23.6 %) after S. epidermidis isolated in neonatology ward. MRSH represent 85. 7 % of the total strains of S. haemolyticus collected from the neonatology ward during the period of study. The majority of the strains come from blood sample 7 (63.63%), 4 (36.36%) from pus and 1 (9%) from CSF. Eight resistant antibiotyps profiles and 3 genotypic pattern according Tenover criteria were individualized: type A, type B (with 3 subtypes), and type C. The strains coming from paediatric ward present pattern type B3, but strains coming from internal medicine ward present distinct pattern. Conclusion: MRSH is a major bacterium of nosocomial infection in neonatal intensive care unit. This bacterium is responsible as shown in our study, of endemic multiclonal nosocomial infections with a predominant clone. Results: S. haemolyticus was isolated from 21% of all positive blood cultures and represented the 37.9% of the coagulase negative staphylococci. Twenty-nine cases of SHB occurred during the study period (5.6 episodes per 1000 patients-days). All cases were hospital-acquired and occurred after a mean hospitalisation of 24.5 days. The mean age was 68.4 years (range 20-90) and 16 patients (55.2%) were males. Twenty-eight patients (96.5%) had a central venous catheter (cvc). All patients received previously antimicrobial therapy. Thirteen patients (44.8%) had polymicrobial bacteraemia. In 18 cases (62.1%) the source of bacteraemia was the cvc. All isolates were resistant to oxacillin and gentamicin, 94.3% and 34.3% were resistant to ciprofloxacin and teicoplanin, respectively; all strains were susceptible to vancomycin. Sixteen patients (55.2%) had sepsis, 3 (10.3%) severe sepsis, and 7 (24.7%), all polymicrobial, septic shock.; in 3 patients (10.3%) SHB had no clinical significance. Twenty patients died (69%) and deaths were directly related to SHB in 1 patient (3.4%), and partially related in 2 (6.8%). Nine patients (31%) survived.The patient who died for SHB, developed a persistent cvc-related bacteraemia after a 6-week course therapy for streptococcal endocarditis. S. haemolyticus become resistant to teicoplanin during a teicoplanin-based therapy and the patient died 47 days after the onset of bacteraemia. The 2 patients, in which death was partially related to SHB, had a polimicrobial bacteraemia due to C. tropicalis and Enterococcus spp, respectively, and died after 22 and 6 days respectively, for septic shock, during adequate therapy. Among the 17 patients in which death was not related to SHB, 15 (88.2%) received adequate therapy that cleared the blood cultures, 2 patients improved after the removal of cvc without antimicrobial therapy. Conclusions: S. haemolyticus is an emerging pathogen, responsible of sepsis, frequently cvc-related; most of strains are resistant to many antistaphylococcal agents currently used as empiric therapy, thus constituting a clinical concern. Nevertheless, this pathogen shows a low virulence and is associated with a low related mortality, probably representing a marker of severe underlying diseases.",

In clinical practice, patients are frequently prescribed systemic isotretinoin because they have not responded to previous treatment with oral or topical antibiotics. Broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy has nevertheless promoted changes in the diversity and antibiotic resistance status of the patients\u00d5 skin microbiota and we are studying the effect of isotretinoin on these changes. Methods: The present study investigated the recovery and analysis of skin organisms from 53 patients (mean age 23 y range 15-37y) before, during and after treatment with a 16-week course of isotretinoin (1 mg / kg body weight). The number of aerobic bacterial isolates (presumptive Staphylococci) recovered from Baird-Parker agar from each of three specific sites per patient were compared with age-matched controls of healthy volunteers. Results: Both patients and controls had generally similar numbers of organisms on the nares, cheek and toe webs before treatment, whereas all patients showed a significant reduction in Staphylococci recovered from one site during and after 16 weeks of isotretinoin treatment. The majority of the patients had a greater reduction (1-2 log) for the cheek site than either nares or toe webs both of which showed minimal reduction. Conclusions: Preliminary results from this study show a pronounced reduction in the number of presumptive staphylococci recovered from the treated group immediately following isotretinoin compared to untreated controls. Since isotretinoin has little known antibacterial activity against the Staphylococci the observed reductions would suggest that the effect is mediated through changes in the skin nutritional micro-environment. Objectives: Emergence of mutational resistance to linezolid (lin) in Staphylococcus aureus has been associated with loss of erythromycin resistance methylase (erm) genes, both in vivo and in vitro. We tested the general validity of this claim, and examined whether the emergence of lin resistance is delayed in the presence of ery. Methods: Six lin-susceptible S. aureus strains were used: 2 genetically-related, ery-resistant (ermC) and susceptible pairs of EMRSA-15, also the isogenic pair RN4220 and its hypermutable RN422mutS mutant, which harbours ermB. In 4 replicated experiments, ery-susceptible and ery-resistant isolates were grown on agar containing increasing concentrations of lin. In addition, ery-resistant isolates were grown with 100 mg / L ery and increasing concentrations of lin. The number of days for isolates to develop the ability to grow in the presence of 6 mg / L lin was recorded. The absence of erm genes was checked by PCR; MICs of lin and ery were determined by agar dilution, and PFGE profiles of mutants were verified. Results: Thirty-three mutants were obtained from the 4 experiments; 24 from the 4 clinical EMRSA-15 isolates, 3 from RN4220 and 6 from RN422mutS. Lin-resistance emerged more slowly in ery-resistant clinical isolates grown with lin and ery than with the same isolates grown with lin alone: mean 20 days (SD 26.8) to emerge on 6 mg / L lin versus 30 days (SD 18.4) in the presence of lin and ery. Growing the hypermutable strain, RN422mutS, in the presence of lin and ery did not delay the emergence of lin-resistance (11 days with SD 8.7, in either case). In the absence of ery selection, loss of erm with the emergence of lin-resistance was only noted for one EMRSA-15 isolate in 1 of 4 experiments. All isolates grown in the presence of ery retained erm determinants. Ery 100 mg / L did not supress growth of ery-resistant strains and linezolid was stable within the ambit of the long-selection experiments. Conclusions: Growing the clinical isolates in the presence of ery and lin slowed the emergence of lin-resistance. This merits further study with lower, clinically-relevant concentrations of ery.",

            "text": "In vitro selection of linezolid resistance in hypermutable and wild-type Staphylococcus aureus Objectives: Resistance to linezolid (lin) is rare, but can arise via mutations in the 23S rRNA genes. We hypothesised (a) that resistance would emerge preferentially in staphylococci with a hypermutable phenotype engineered by mutations in the mutS gene, and (b) that hypermutability might be co-selected with linezolid resistance. MutS is part of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system, which identifies and corrects genome alterations post-replication, thereby influencing the net mutation rate. Method: Linezolid-resistant (LinR) mutants of Staphylococcus aureus RN4220, its hypermutable mutS deletion mutant RN4220mutS, harbouring an erythromycin resistance marker gene (ermB), and a genetically-related pair of clinical isolates were selected by repeated passage with increasing concentrations of lin. Mutant parentage was confirmed by PFGE and susceptibility was tested by agar dilution. An amplified 694-bp fragment of 23S rRNA genes was studied by sequencing and by RFLP analysis. Frequencies at which LinR mutants yielded variants resistant to fusidic acid and rifampin were calculated in triplicate experiments. Results: Seventeen LinR mutants (MICs 8-64 lg/ml) were raised. Ten mutants had a G2447T mutation in their 23S rRNA genes; 4, all from RN4220mutS, had G2576T, typically seen in LinR gram-positive cocci from the clinic; 1 had T2504C; 2 had no identifiable mutations. Curiously 5 / 7 RN4220mutS mutants lost ermB during the course of the experiment, reverting to macrolide susceptible. LinR mutants had mutation frequencies for rifampicin and fusidic acid resistance comparable with those of their parents (10-6 to 10-9), implying no co-selection of stable hypermutability. Conclusion: More LinR mutants were obtained from the hypermutable (RN4220mutS) strain than from the wild type strain, and G2576T mutants were only obtained from the hypermutable organism. These data suggest hypermutability facilitates the emergence of LinR, nevertheless, LinR mutants derived from wild-type parents did not have elevated mutation frequencies. Objectives: The mechanism of resistance in Glycopeptide Intermediate Staphylococcus aureus (GISA) and hGISA isolates is unknown. However the inactivation of certain genes has been shown to confer an increase in glycopeptide resistance. Two genes, tcaA and mprF, when inactivated in GISA strains cause a reduction in glycopeptide MIC. Overexpression of tcaA causes an increase in teicoplanin susceptibility and so both genes may play a role in the development of glycopeptide resistance. This study aims to investigate the expression levels of tcaA and mprF in a set of GISA, hGISA and glycopeptide-susceptible S. aureus (GSSA). Methods: RNA was extracted from the following: 1 set of clinically related (CR) GSSA and hGISA (LLA and LLE), 2 sets of CR hGISA and GISA (PC1 and PC3, LIM1 and LIM3) harvested during exponential phase growth (EX) and during exponential phase growth in the presence of sub-MIC levels of vancomycin (EXV). RNA was extracted from a further hGISA, Mu3 and GISA, Mu50 as well as 4 clinical GSSA strains. RT-PCR was performed with customised primers and the products visualised by electrophoresis. Band intensity was taken as indicative of mRNA quantity, and hence expression level, at time of cell harvest. Results: The expression of tcaA is similar in all strains tested. Each strain within the related strain sets all show similar band intensities, despite differing glycopeptide resistance phenotype. Both Mu3 and Mu50 also exhibited similar expression levels to those found for all other GISA, hGISA and GSSA strains. Levels of expression were not affected by the presence of sub-MIC levels of vancomycin in any strain tested. Sequence analysis of tcaA in these strains showed no mutations present as previously thought. Expression levels of mprF were found to be strain specific. No difference in gene expression was found in the CR related strain sets. Conclusions: No reduction in expression levels of tcaA and mprF were found to correlate with clinical strains exhibiting higher glycopeptide resistance. Thus it it uncertain what role tcaA ot mprF play with mediating glycopeptide resistance in Staphylococcus aureus. Objectives: GISA and hGISA strains all have a characteristic thickened cell wall with reportedly fewer cross-links. Fewer peptidoglycan cross-links create increased D-ala-D-ala pentapeptide termini and hence more vancomycin targets. PBP4 has been shown to have both transpeptidase and D,D-carboxypeptidase activity, cleaving terminal D-alanine residues from un-cross-linked muropeptides. Reduced levels of PBP4 have been reported in laboratory-generated GISA mutants and a few clinical GISA strains. This study aims to investigate the expression levels of pbp4 in a set of GISA, hGISA and glycopeptide-susceptible S. aureus (GSSA). Methods: RNA was extracted from the following: 1 set of clinically related (CR) VSSA and hGISA (LLA and LLE), 2 sets of CR hGISA and GISA (PC1 and PC3, LIM1 and LIM3) harvested during exponential phase growth (EX), after overnight growth (ON) and during exponential phase growth in the presence of sub-MIC levels of vancomycin (EXV). RNA was extracted from a further 8 clinically unrelated (CU) GISA (including Mu50), 8 CU hGISA (including Mu3) and 8 GSSA (EX). RT-PCR was performed with customised primers and the products visualised by electrophoresis. Band intensity was taken as indicative of mRNA quantity at time of harvest and hence gene expression. Results: The expression of pbp4 varies according to strain. The band intensities of the related strain set LLA (GSSA) and LLE (hGISA) reduce slightly with increasing intermediate vancomycin resistance. However in two other CR hGISA and GISA (PC1/ PC3, LIM1/LIM3) strain sets no variation in expression was observed. Both Mu3 and Mu50 exhibited lower pbp4 expression than any other strain, with the presence of sub-MIC levels of vancomycin reducing expression further. pbp4 expression was found to be reduced in 3 other GISA and 1 other hGISA, which showed lower band intensities than GSSA. Conclusions: The reduced levels of PBP4 suspected to be associated with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin in S. aureus is not exclusive. The expression of pbp4 is reduced in Mu50 and 3 clinical GISA, as reported previously. However 5 other GISA strains exhibit pbp4 expression levels similar to GSSA isolates. Therefore pbp4 expression levels appear to be strain specific and a lowered expression level is not an essential requirement in the development of the GISA phenotype. Objectives: The prolonged use of vancomycin is known to be the most important factor in inducing vancomycin resistance to S. aureus. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) colonizing in respiratory tracts might be chronically exposed to subtherapeutic concentrations of vancomycin because the level of vancomycin within pulmonary lining fluids was much lower than the concentration of serum. Despite the continuous use of vancomycin MRSAs were still found to be presented in respiratory specimens of some patients. Methods: All MRSAs which had been continuously isolated in respiratory specimens during vancomycin therapy were collected from Jul 2003-Mar 2004 at Seoul Paik Hospital. MRSAs were screened on Brain Heart Infusion plates containing vancomycin 4 lg / mL (BHI-4) and 6 lg / mL (BHI-6) for vancomycin resistance. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were determined by E-tests, agar dilution methods, and broth dilution methods. The patterns of pulsed field gel electrophoresis were analysed. Results: Nine patients and 27 isolates were assessed. Five patients had pneumonia and four patients had other MRSA infections. Twelve MRSAs were isolated from tracheal aspirates and 15 from expectorated sputum specimens. The duration of vancomycin use ranged from 7-22 days. Five isolates and one isolate were cultured on BHI-4 and BHI-6, respectively; the vancomycin MICs of these isolates revealed 3 lg / mL by E-tests. The MICs from agar dilution methods and broth dilution methods showed from 0.5-2 lg / mL. Conclusion: Vancomycin resistance during the treatment of patients did not develop. Objectives: Fusidic acid resistance (fusR) in Staphylococcus aureus usually results from acquisition of the fusB resistance determinant, or from mutations in the fusA gene encoding the drug target (Elongation factor G). Following a recent report of fusR in S. intermedius, and the detection in our own studies of fusR S. lugdunensis (unpublished), we have examined whether resistance in these strains results from fusA / fusB-type mechanisms. Methods: Standard methodology was employed for strain identification, susceptibility testing, Southern hybridization (SH), PCR amplification and DNA sequencing. Primers for PCR amplification of the previously-unsequenced S. intermedius fusA gene were based on portions of the flanking genes (rpsG, tufA) that are conserved between B. subtilis and S. aureus. Results: Three fusR S. lugdunensis (fus MIC = 4 ug / ml) and two fusR S. intermedius (fus MIC = 2 ug / ml) were probed for the presence of fusB by SH alongside their wild-type, fusS counterparts (fus MICs of 0.064 and 0.125 ug / ml, respectively). The fusR S. lugdunensis all carried fusB, but this gene was not detected in S. intermedius, or in the fusS strains. Furthermore, fusB appeared to be chromosomally-located, since no hybridization was observed with purified plasmid DNA. PCR analysis mapped fusB to a chromosomal region upstream of the groEL gene, the same locus at which this gene is carried in the epidemic fusR European S. aureus clone. To examine whether mutations in fusA are responsible for fusR in S. intermedius, PCR amplification and sequencing of fusA from the resistant and sensitive strains was performed. Relative to fusS S. intermedius NCTC 11048, the resistant strains carried six coding polymorphisms in fusA, although none of these correspond to reported fusR mutations in the fusA gene of S. aureus. Conclusions: Fus resistance in recent strains of S. lugdunensis results from carriage of the fusB determinant on the chromosome, probably acquired horizontally from fusR S. aureus strains. The fusB gene was not detected in the S. intermedius strains, although multiple fusA polymorphisms were identi-fied which may be responsible for the observed fusR phenotype. Objectives: Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci (MRCNS) are the most important pathogens that cause nosocomial infections worldwide. One of the few antibiotics which is still effective against MRSA is mupirocin. But mupirocin-resistant S. aureus has been increased since first reported in 1987. And more than 5-10% of S. aureus isolated in tertiary hospitals in Korea was reported to be high level mupirocin resistant. In this study, we investigated the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) type for mupA gene loci of plasmid DNA and sequenced mupR plasmid containing mupA gene of high level mupirocin resistant (MuH) staphylococci from tertiary hospitals. Methods: Susceptibility to antimicrobial agents including mupirocin was tested by the disk diffusion and MIC of mupirocin was determined by agar dilution method. The plasmid-encoded mupA gene was detected by PCR. mupA polymorphisms of plasmid DNA digested by Hind III, EcoR I, and Cla I restriction enzymes was investigated with southern hybridization using mupA probe. S. aureus isolate showing the most prevalent RFLP type was conjugated by filter mating method and selected the transconjugant showing only mupirocin resistant phenotype. The mupR plasmid of selected transconjugant was purified and analysed the plasmid DNA sequence. Results: 9 MuH-staphylococci were isolated among the 680 staphylococci from tertiary hospital in Korea. MuH-MRSA (6 isolates), S. haemolyticus (1 isolates), S. hominis (1 isolates) and S. epidermidis (1 isolates) were isolated. 1.65kb mupA PCR product was detected in plasmid of MuH isolate. All isolates contained more than two plasmid molecules that were repeatedly purified with different efficiences. Three different polymorphs of the mupA loci were investigated. The most prevalent mupA polymorph was 4.2kb EcoRI-8kb HindIII-2.1kb ClaI hybridizing fragment. The mupirocin resistant plasmid DNA was about 52kb and IS257-mupA-IS257 sequence was located. Conclusion: The high-level mupirocin resistant staphylococci had the multiple plasmids of various size and the diverse RFLP type suggested the variation of mupA gene loci. The mupR plasmid contained transferable element such as IS257 with mupA gene.",

            "text": "Objective: In S. aureus erythromycin resistance is almost exclusively caused by ermA or ermC genes whereas export of macrolide antibiotics by msrA or inactivation of lincosamides by linA is rare. Resistance may be inducibly (clindamycin appears susceptible) or constitutively (clindamycin appears resistant) expressed. During therapy of inducibly resistant strains with clindamycin mutations may occur that render them Objectives: Lysostaphin is an antibacterial enzyme which is specifically capable of cleaving the cross-linking pentaglycine bridges in the cell walls of staphylococci. S. aureus cell walls contain high proportions of pentaglycine, making lysostaphin a highly effective agent against both actively growing and quiescent bacteria. Relationship between lysostaphin susceptibility, vancomycin susceptibility and cell wall thickness of passage-selected vancomycin -resistant Staphylococcus aureus isolates (VRSA) and their parent strains were studied in order to investigate Characterization of isolates with decreased susceptibility to vancomycin. Methods: The susceptibility of lysostaphin for six VRSA and their parent strains were determined using the spectrophotometric and the macrodilution methods.

As typing method spatyping will be used. Five strains, 5 DNAs, and 5 forward and reverse chromatogram files of well characterized MRSA strains will be distributed to all participating laboratories. An annual proficiency testing for sequence based typing of MRSA is planned. Staphylococcus aureus is an important human pathogen related to its ability to develop resistance to many antimicrobial agents. Methicillin resistance of S. aureus (MRSA) has become a major public health problem especially in nosocomial infectious. More over community acquired MRSA is a growing concern, the rate of MRSA vary importantly within countries, the highest rates were reported especially in Southern European countries. A multicentric study was done to establish antimicrobial resistance of S. aureus isolated from clinical specimens of hospitalized patients over five years period (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) . S. aureus was identified by conventional methods and antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed by disk diffusion method according to NCCLS standards. A total of 5186 strains of S. aureus were collected, they were recovered mainly from pus (60%), blood cultures (15%), respiratory samples (8%) and urines (7%). 34% of the strains were from in medicine, 18% from surgery, 16% from orthopaedics, 14% from paediatrics and 13% from intensive care units. The rates of resistance to different antibiotics was 15% to oxacilline,9% to gentamicin, 23% to amikacin,8% to ofloxacin, 23% to erythromycin and 8% to clindamycin. All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin. According to this data the rate of MRSA remained relatively low (< 20%) with no significant change during this time period, however, MRSA presented high rates of associated resistance to gentamicin (48%), to amikacin, (91%) to erythromycin (38%), to clindamycin (20%), to ofloxacin (40%) and to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (33%).MRSA were not of great concern in our country and meticillin remains an effective antibiotic for treatment of S. aureus infections.",

Thirteen strains (10%) were MRSA-screen positive, both with the oxacillin-agar test and the cefoxitin disc, and confirmed MRSA by mecA and nuc PCR. All MRSA strains were isolated from hospitalized patients and expressed multiple resistances. PFGEanalysis revealed that the MRSA-strains belonged three different PFGE-types. Type 1 consists of 8 strains from the department of general surgery and ICU. The type 2 group consisted of 3 strains from general surgery department. Finally, one strain from a patient at the Department of pulmonary medicine belonged to the type 3 group. We were not able to type one strain. MLSTtyping of MRSA-strains will be performed. Results: A total of 793 infants were included in this study. MRSA colonization was detected in 331 infants (42%) during NICU stay and 89% were detected by the first 2 samplings. Naris (71%) and umbilicus (60%) were the 2 most common sites of colonization. Clinical MRSA isolates were identified from 92 infants (12%). Among the 92 infants, MRSA colonization, either preceding or later acquiring, was noted in 84 infants (91%). 121 clinical isolates from 64 infants with 84 episodes of possible MRSA infection were available for genotyping analysis. Prior colonization was detected in 68 episodes (81%), among which both the colonized and clinical isolates were indistinguishable in 63 episodes (93%), highly related in 2 episodes and distinct in 3 episodes. Among the 16 episodes without prior colonization, colonization was acquired following infection in 9 episodes (53%), among which indistinguishable or highly related colonized strain was acquired in 6 episodes. Conclusion: Surveillance of MRSA strains as a basis for active antibiotic policy has become of increasing concern to both health care providers in hospitals and community general practitioners. There is a need for better awareness of MRSA infections among both health care professionals and the public. The incidence of MRSA infections in last years in the Czech Republic shows a slightly increasing trend. Very interesting is local distribution of MRSA strains. The development of the incidence of MRSA infections in their spread will be the subject of further study.",

Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) with SmaI digestion of chromosomal DNA was used for the genotypic typing analysis. Results: We found 19 distinct profiles by phenotypic typing methods and 18 PFGE types designed as 5 major types (A to E) and 13 subtypes. The most frequently types and their related subtypes found in both hospital, were A and C with represented 54.1% and 27%, respectively. All isolates resistant to penicillin, cephalosporin, erythromycin, gentamicin, kanamycin, tetracycline and oxacillin; and variably resistant to cotrimoxazole, lincomycin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin. All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and fosfomycin. Ten (13.5%) MRSA isolates produced enterotoxin A. Forty-five (60.8%) isolates were nontypable by phage typing method.

Four MRSA strains from neonates of clinic B showed ST1 (1-1-1-1-1-1-1) and resistance to erythromycin and gentamicin, which is the same characteristics with three isolates from nurses and environment of clinic B. The other two MRSA strains from neonates of clinic B showed ST493 (62-1-1-1-1-1-1), which is shared by six strains from nurses and environment of clinic B. spa type of these 22 MRSA strains was identical as UJEBKBP and all strains were negative for PVL gene. Objectives: Over the last years there has been a dramatic increase in the prevalence of methicillin-and multiresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) leading to a major health problem, especially in the nosocomial setting. To support infection control measures typing of MRSA is essential. The present \u00d4gold standard\u00d5 for strain typing is pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), but several sequence based methods including spa typing have recently been introduced. Therefore this study was initiated to compare typing results obtained from PFGE with those from spa typing. Methods: 90 well characterized S. aureus strains of different evolutionary origin including methicillin sensitive and resistant isolates were included. Strains were selected from a variety of clonal groups prevalent in Germany and middle Europe during the last ten years. The collection comprised hospital derived strains as well as isolates from the community, including the recently emerging community acquired MRSA. All isolates were subjected to PFGE with subsequent cluster analysis; additionally the polymorphic X-region of the protein A gene was sequenced and a spa type was assigned using the Ridom StaphType software. The newly developed algorithm BURP (based upon repeat patterns) was applied to the spa sequences to cluster the resulting spa types into different groups. Clustering results were compared to those obtained from PFGE and MLST. Results: Overall the results obtained from the different typing approaches were in agreement. In some cases where PFGE results were inconsistent despite uniform epidemiological background spa typing was able to group the corresponding strains together. Only two strongly related epidemic clones could not be separated by spa typing. Conclusion: Spa typing in combination with BURP analysis is an easy, rapid and reliable method for epidemiological analyses in S. aureus. It is superior to PFGE in cases where PFGE might be \u00d4overdiscriminatory\u00d5. In rare cases a second discriminatory locus (for example a single MLST locus) might be helpful for an ultimate classification.",

Strains showed 22 different resistance patterns and TSH (13%strains), PSI (11.8%) and ELTS (10.1%) were the most often. Resistance degree reached 7 drugs (5% strains) and 69% strains were MDR. We have found 26 PFGE profiles: 15 of them (U 1-15) were unique single isolates, 11 clusters (A-K) were represented by 2-10 strains, which were more than 78% of similar. The most numerous clusters (A-K) consists of strains that were isolated over three years of study and showed the same or very similar resistant patterns: A-TSH (8 of 10 strains), TH (2); B-PSI (7 of 8), S (1); C-PELSHI (3 of 6), PTSHI (2), PTSCHI (1); D-ELTS (3 of 4), ELS (1); E-SH (2 of 4), TS (1), T (1).

The remaining HLPR pneumococci belonged to unique or rare clones. LLPR isolates were characterised by more variable backgrounds in terms of PFGE patterns and serotypes than HLPR strains. In fact, 27.7% showed an identical or related profile (arbitrarily called D, serotype 15A) previously not described in Italy and 10 (15.4%) exhibited the PFGE patterns typical or related to the Spain23F-1 and Spain9V-3 clones.

Conclusions: The recent increase of total penicillin-resistance in Italy can be ascribed to the emergence of a new clone and to the diffusion of two well known international clones, whose ability to spread is higher than that of the autochthonous Italian clone described in 1996. Changing antibiotic prescribing habits, including the recent strict limitation to the consumption of parenteral drugs, may also explain the variations described.

            "text": "Objectives: This analysis of data from 39 countries over the first 4 years (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) of the PROTEKT global surveillance study was undertaken to investigate longitudinal and regional trends in the distribution of macrolide resistance mechanisms among Streptococcus pneumoniae, and the susceptibility of these isolates to antibacterials, including the ketolide telithromycin. Objectives: The 7-valent formulation of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was introduced in the USA in February 2000. There is a general recommendation for its use in all children <2 years of age, and the vaccine is licensed for children up to 5 years of age. In Europe, the vaccine is licensed for children up to 5 years of age, but most countries do not have a general recommendation for use. PROTEKT -a global, longitudinal study of the antimicrobial susceptibility of bacterial respiratory tract pathogens -has now completed its fourth year. A comparison was made between serotype distribution and PCV7 coverage between Y1 and Y4. Methods: Analysis was performed only on Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates obtained from paediatric patients at the 31 centres common to both years (Y1, n = 553; Y4, n = 682). Serotyping was performed by Neufeld's Quellung reaction using Statens Serum Institute antisera (SSI, Denmark). Results: PCV7 coverage decreased from 67.7% and 62.5% in Y1 to 51.0% and 41.0% in Y4 in the USA and Latin America, respectively (Chi-squared; p = <0.001 and 0.007, respectively). Serotypes that showed the greatest increase (Y1, Y4) in the USA were 19A (7.0%, 22.2%), 6A (1.8%, 9.9%), 3 (1.8%, 6.2%), 15 (1.8%, 6.2%), and 11 (0%, 6.2%). In Brazil, a similar pattern was seen although there was no change in the proportion of isolates with the 19A serotype. In contrast, no change in serotype distribution was observed in Canada, Western Europe, and the Far East, where the PCV7 vaccine is not routinely used for paediatric vaccination. Conclusions: Results from this analysis of PROTEKT data indicate that the proportion of S. pneumoniae isolates from paediatric patients covered by the PCV7 vaccine has decreased significantly over 4 years in regions where the vaccine is routinely used. Other serotypes, such as 19A, which is known to be highly resistant to antimicrobials and is not covered by PCV7, have increased in these regions. This study demonstrates the importance of serotyping antimicrobial surveillance study isolates in order to monitor such changes and any potential future implications for therapy and vaccine formulations. Background: Sequential alterations in PBP sequences constitute the classical mechanism to acquire penicillin resistance in S. pneumoniae, that is reflected in changes in the cell wall peptidoglycan structure. murM gene controls the addition of the first amino acid of the dipeptide bridge of the pneumococcal muropeptide. Mutations in this gene are apparently required for high penicillin and cefotaxime resistance. The aim of this study was to compare the murM gene sequence within the earlier and the latest highly penicillin resistant pneumococcal populations recovered in Spain. Material and methods: A total of 56 S. pneumoniae isolates (10 of them from 1987-88 and 46 from 2002-04) with resistance to penicillin (MIC 2-8 lg/ml) were included. Susceptibility to different b-lactams, macrolides, tetracycline, levofloxacin, chloramphenicol, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SxT) were determined by the agar dilution method. All isolates were grouped according to serotype and pulsotype (PFGE-SmaI pattern) and the murM gene was sequenced.",

All isolates remained susceptible to telithromycin but not to levofloxacin (93% of susceptibility). All isolates recovered during 1987-88 were genetically unrelated and mainly belonged to serotypes 23F (40%) and 6B (40%). In contrast, the most frequent serotypes during 2002-04 were 14 (30%), 9V (26%), and 6B (17%). In this period, a predominant Spain9V-3clone was detected in 10 out of 14 isolates of serotype 14, and in 11 out of 12 isolates of serotype 9V (capsular switch). All 8 isolates of serotype 6B belonged to a single clone (Spain6B-2). The analysis of murM sequences of isolates from both periods revealed the existence of different alleles. Homologous sequences to the murMA (identical to that described for R6 penicillin susceptible strain), were replaced in part by murMB5, and murMB6 (different variants of these alleles were detected in our collection). Conclusion: Early high penicillin resistant S. pneumoniae isolates in Spain were genetically unrelated and corresponding to 23F and 6B serotypes. On the contrary, recent isolates showed dissemination of selected clones, particularly Spain9V-3. Many S. pneumoniae isolates with high-level resistance to penicillin retain (or reacquired) the murM gene of susceptible strains, but different allelic variants was also detected. Objectives: To determine among 712 S. pneumoniae clinical isolates recovered from different Spanish hospitals during three different periods (1999-2000, 2001-2002 and 2002-2003) the prevalence of erythromycin resistance phenotypes and resistance genes associated to this resistance. Methods: Susceptibility testing was performed by the standard microdilution technique (NCCLS). A PCR assay was carried out to identified erythromycin resistance genes (erm or mef) and a multiplex-PCR was designed to distinguish between mef(A) and mef(E) genes within mef positive isolates. Clonality was studied using the Sma-I-PFGE technique.",

Conclusion: Between countries, large differences in the patterns of S. pneumoniae resistance were found among young children. ERY resistance was most common among young children, which may indicate greater use of macrolides in this age group.

            "text": "Conclusions: Efforts should focus not only on antibiotic resistance surveillance and the development of guidelines but also on appropriate use of antibiotics. Strategies have been proposed which include restricting access, compliance promotion and reduction in our prescriptions and inappropriate use of antibiotics. Newer macrolides, including azithromycin, are still considered drugs of choice for empirical treatment of respiratory infection in such circumstances. Objectives: MLSB phenotype erythromycin resistance (EryR) is often associated with tetracycline resistance (TetR) and in Streptococci is mediated by the methylase genes erm(B) or erm(TR). In Streptococcus pneumoniae, erm(B) is carried in transposons such as Tn1545 which also carry the TetR gene tet(M). M phenotype EryR is associated with the efflux genes mef(A) or mef(E). These genes are carried in genetic elements that do not commonly include TetR genes, but the mef(E) element in S. pneumoniae can be inserted in a transposon that carries tet(M). Our objective was to investigate TetR in EryR beta-haemolytic streptococci of groups A, B, C and G. Methods: 129 EryR beta-haemolytic streptococci of groups A (26), B (42), C (9) and G (52) were collected over two years. TetR was determined by disc diffusion and MICs by E-test.

Results: Reduced susceptibility (MIC >1 mg/L) was detected in 44 (2.7%) S. pyogenes isolates. A total of 32 (73%) S. pyogenes isolates demonstrated a MLSB phenotype resistance. The dominating gene was erm(A) (n = 27), encoding resistance in 27 strains, whereas erm(B) was detected in only five of the strains isolates. While one of the cMLSB strains carried both erm(A) and the mef(A) gene, another cMLSB strain was reproducibly negative in erm and mef PCR analyses, and will be further investigated. The remaining 11 (25 %) isolates all carried the mef(A) gene and showed a consistent with their M phenotype resistance. Thirty (68%) strains were resistant to tetracycline and carried the erm-positive strains (n = 30) genes, while all the Mtype strains were susceptible to tetracycline.

Conclusions: (i) The prevalence of macrolide resistance among S. pyogenes in Norway is low, and the (ii) MLSB resistance, erm(A) or erm(B) was the most prevalent resistance type and co-resistance to tetracycline was frequently observed. Rates of resistance to macrolides vary from region to region and these rates are important in defining the role of macrolides in empiric therapy. Macrolide and lincosamide resistance are mediated by 3 distinct mechanisms, (1) mefA encodes resistance to erythromycin but not clindamycin, (2) ermB encodes resistance to erythromycin and clindamycin, (3) ermA encodes resistance to erythromycin and inducible resistance to clindamycin.",

Isolates were confirmed as S. pyogenes by Lancefield grouping using the Pastorex STREP rapid agglutination kit. Erythromycin susceptibility testing was performed by NCCLS disc diffusion. Erythromycin resistant isolates were tested for susceptibility to erythromycin and azithromycin by Etest. The mechanisms of resistance was assessed using the erythromycin/ clindamycin disc approximation test and by PCR, with primers specific for the ermA, ermB and mefA genes. Positive controls were kindly provided by Ralf R. Reinert. Results: Four (4) of 360 consecutive isolates (1%) were resistant to erythromycin. Erythromycin resistance was confirmed by Etest and these isolates were also resistant to azithromycin. All 4 erythromycin-resistant study isolates and 3 of 4 previously collected erythromycin-resistant isolates were confirmed as ermA positive by PCR and exhibited inducible resistance by disc approximation. One previously collected isolate was susceptible to clindamycin and was mefA positive by PCR. Conclusion: These data show that macrolide resistance in S. pyogenes is very uncommon in this area and is encoded primarily by ermA. Objective: Aim of this study was to evaluate antimicrobial prophylaxis (AP) practice and its cost in Intensive Care Unit of Heart Surgery Depertment in our hospital. Method: Study was performed prospectively between January-December 2002. AP lasting >1 day was considered inappropriate, unless the patient was in high risk group (heart transplantation or repeated by-pass). In addition AP with two beta lactam agents; beta lactam+aminoglycoside (only beta lactam+gentamicin was allowed); 3rd generation cephalosporins; quinolones or glycopeptides were considered inappropriate. In high risk patients, AP lasting up to 3 days and AP with glycopeptides were considered appropriate. Cost of inappropriate AP was calculated by using August-2004 prices in EURO. Cost of inappropriate AP in patients who received cefazolin or beta lactam/beta lactamase inhibitors (ampicillin/sulbactam or amoxycillin/clavulanate) was calculated by substraction of cost of 1 day lasting AP from total AP cost. In case of inappropriate glycopeptide or quinolone or aminoglycoside usage, one day lasting cefazolin cost was substracted from total AP cost. In high risk patients cost of inappropriate glycopeptide usage was calculated by substracting 3 days lasting AP cost from total cost. Infections were diagnosed according to the criteria of Center for Diseases Control and Prevention (CDC). Data were analysed with chi square and Student's t-tests. Objectives: The aim of the present study was to investigate the frequency and the type of wound infections, as well as the bacteria involved, after posterior spinal fusion in children, especially with spinal deformities, over a 6-year period (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) . Materials and methods: A total of 133 spinal fusions were performed on 110 children, with or without instrumentation, because of spinal scoliosis (120), spondylolisthesis (4), fractures (4), and for other reasons (5 Objectives: Therapy of chronic wounds with Lucilia sericata presents a promising alternative to the classical approach with antibiotics. Larvae are placed in wounds free-roaming or in biobags. The therapy often stimulates the process of wound healing. This effect is based on different mechanisms. Maggots\u00d5 saliva contains collagenases, trypsin and chymotrypsin-like enzymes which dilute necrotic tissue. Furthermore, an antibacterial effect has been described. In our study, we focused on the question whether this effect could be explained by the ingestion of bacteria by larvae. Methods: Free roaming maggots were placed on agar plates with Escherichia coli. These bacteria had been transformed with Green fluorescent protein (GFP)-containing plasmids. GFP-free Escherichia coli XL1 blue served as a control. Two days old maggots were put on agar plates in groups of ten at room temperature. Every thirty seconds, a maggot was displaced from the agar plate and washed with sterile saline (0.9%). Dead larvae which could not have taken up bacteria served as a control. Maggots were tested for flourescence under a fluorescence microscope [Zeiss Axioskop; HPO50/AC, Axiocam MRmZeiss]. Larvae were examined by an independent observer as well. Results: Maggots that had been placed on GFP-labelled Escherichia coli showed an intensive green fluorescence, especially at the back of the head and in the intestines. The controls did not show any fluorescence. After three to four minutes GFP-labelled Escherichia coli could be detected inside the maggots' body. At this early stage of digestion GFP-fluorescence could mainly be examined in the area of the head. This fluorescence results of the ingestion of GFP-labelled Escherichia coli by larvae.",

Blood stream infections (bacteraemia) among cancer patients that develop during the course of disease are potentially life threatening because of suppression in their immune systems. The changing spectrum in the incidence and epidemiology of microbial pathogens has resulted in an increase in resistance to many antibiotic compounds emphasizing the need to monitor the prevalence of resistance in these strains. Methods: Susceptibility and resistance pattern of clinically significant bacterial isolates from positive blood cultures collected during 2000-2004 was studied. The isolated strains were tested against a wide range of antibiotics belonging to cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, carbapenems and quinolones derivative groups by disc diffusion method and the results were interpreted according to British standard for antimicrobial chemotherapy.",

Similarly, high resistance to aminoglycosides were found (69% to ampicillin, 50% to tobramycin and 62% resistant to quinolone derivates group of antibiotics. However only 29% were resistant to ciprofloxacin. In gram positive bacteria, high resistance to ciprofloxacin (40%) was observed as compared to gram negative bacteria. A still higher resistance level (100%) was observed for aminoglycosides and third generation cephalosporins (97%) respectively. Conclusion: The spectrum of isolates among our patients were shifting towards gram positive bacteria with high resistance to different groups of antimicrobial agents limiting few choices for alternative therapies for infection control. Antimicrobial resistance continues to increase and ongoing surveillance of microbial pathogens is essential. This study also warrants the need of infection control measures, rational antibiotic policies and rapid laboratory detection of resistance to prevent the spread of resistance among these strains.

Urine, nasopharyngeal and wound samples were collected from 668 elderly residents. We chose randomly 35% of the existing population from each LTCF (minimum sum 25 residents, age above 65 years). Gram negative bacteria were identified by API strips and underwent antimicrobial disk susceptibility testing, following the NCCLS guidelines. Data were also collected on resident factors and institutional variables. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Odds ratios (OR) and P values were calculated. Results: 412 Gram negative (GN) strains were isolated from 1448 samples (prevalence rate 28.5%). The majority of them were recovered from urine samples (86.8%). 53% of the residents had been taking systemic antibiotics during the preceding month. Q were the leading class (38%). \u00c1 R of GN to ciprofloxacin (CIP) were estimated (Table) . Multi-drug QRGN accounted for 11.5% of the isolated strains. The most prevalent phenotype was resistance to ampicilline, CIP and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. In the multivariate analysis, only prior exposure to antimicrobial agents (P < 0.001; OR = 2), specifically to Q (P < 0.001; OR = 14), and the presence of a urinary catheter (P < 0.001; OR = 2) were significantly associated with colonization with QRGN. Objectives: Colonization and resistance dynamics of gramnegative bacteria in the intestinal and oropharyngeal microflora of patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU) and general wards (GW) were investigated during and after hospitalization. Methods: Specimens were obtained on admission, once weekly during hospitalization, at discharge from the ICU, at discharge from the hospital and one and three months after discharge from the hospital. Five colonies per specimen were selected for identification and susceptibility testing by the VITEK 2 system. Results: A total of 3316 specimens from 411 patients were collected. In both patient populations, the gram-negative colonization rates in oropharyngeal specimens increased during hospitalization and did not decrease in the three months after discharge. In rectal specimens, colonization rates decreased during hospitalization and increased after discharge. There was a change in species distribution among the dominant microflora during hospitalization. Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were more often isolated, whereas the frequency of E. coli declined. The percentage of ICU patients colonized with ampicillin and/or cephalothin resistant faecal E. coli was significantly increased at discharge from the hospital and did not change in the three months after discharge. Emergence of multi-drug resistance was observed in many gram-negative species during stay on the ICU. Resistance frequencies in E. coli significantly increased with length of stay on the ICU.

The aim of our study is to examine for the whole hospital and wards with risks the correlation between resistance of GNB and the consumption of third generation cephalosporins (3rd GC) and imipenem for the period from January 2003 to September 2004. Methods: A surveillance of antibiotic resistance and antibiotic consumption was established respectively by the laboratory and the department of pharmacy. Data on antimicrobial resistance and antibiotic consumption were collected quarterly and antibiotic consumption was calculated in defined daily doses (DDD) using ABC Calc. Results were expressed per 1000 bed-days (bd). Statistical analysis was done using SPSS software for the calculation of the Spearman rank correlation (rs) with an alpha risk of 5%. Results: For the whole hospital, resistance to 3rd GC ranged from 0.9 to 1.7 GNB/1000 bd. The highest rates were observed in intensive care unit (ICU: 4.7-12.7 GNB/1000 bd) and the lowest rates in orthopaedic ward (0-2 GNB/1000 bd All MRSA isolates were resistant to multiple classes of antimicrobials whereas MSSA were sensitive (p < 0.001). All ESBL+ bacteria were resistant to multiple classes but sensitive to meropenem, colistin, amikacin (82%), cotrimoxazole (50%) and chloramphenicol (50%). Resistance in non-ESBL+ bacteria was detected to ampicillin (73%), cefalexin (32%), 2nd/3rd generation cephalosporin (0%), chloramphenicol (32%), cotrimoxazole (11%), ciprofloxacin (5%), trimethoprim (21%), gentamicin (5%), netilmicin (53%) and tobramycin (11%). Potentially community acquired isolates showed lower rates of resistance (0% to trimethoprim, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, amikacin, tobramycin, 2nd/3rd generation cephalosporin).Duration of hospital stay was not a risk for acquiring either ESBL+ bacteria or MRSA whereas having a surgery was associated. Exposure to quinolone was a risk factor for MRSA but not ESBL+ bacteria. Aminoglycoside and cephalosporin were risks for ESBL+ bacteria. Acquiring both MRSA and ESBL+ Enterobacteriacae together did correlated with the duration of hospital stay in addition to exposure to aminoglycoside and cephalosporin. Conclusion: Majority of patients remained free from resistant bacteria implying that cross-transmission alone was not sufficient in absence of risk factors, particularly exposure to antimicrobials. Good hand-hygiene and prudent use of antimicrobials are realistic options for resource poor countries to reduce the burden of resistant bacteria.

Infection is generally associated with the gastrointestinal effects of food poisoning and linked to the consumption of infected rice dishes. However, the Bacillus genus is extremely heterogenic. It can occupy a wide variety of ecological niches and bacillus spores are found ubiquitously in the environment. Even so, Bacillus cereus isolated from the hospital and clinic setting in any material other than vomitus or faeces is commonly dismissed since it is a known contaminant of blood cultures and most bacillus bactereamias are transient and usually insignificant. Case Report: We report a case of Bacillus cereus wound infection in a previously healthy 31-year-old male admitted to the orthopaedic ward with a comminuted fracture of the right distal tibia. He developed compartment syndrome one day later and was taken to theatre for fasciotomy. Within 48 hours, he developed chest complications and was admitted to the High Dependency Unit. After three days he was taken back to theatre for wound inspection and change of dressing. Seven days later external fixation was applied. Subsequently, the wound site became red, inflamed and tender and was associated with an acute rise in inflammatory markers. Microbiological reports showed Bacillus cereus growth from the suture sites, sensitive to ciprofloxacin. No source was identified.",

Bacillus cereus has been known to be a contaminant of dressings, intravenous catheters, theatre scrub suits and linens pointing to an array of possible infective sources within the hospital. It emphasizes the need for theatre and hospital sterility and stresses the importance of vigilance against this infrequent cause of a potentially serious non-gastrointestinal bacillus infection. This is of particular importance because alcoholbased cleaning solutions are known to be ineffective against bacillus spores and infections dismissed as contaminants may lead to rapid clinical deterioration.",

The surface growth at 24 h was swabbed to Mueller-Hinton agar containing twice the prior concentration of imipenem. Results: Single step resistant variants were selected from Isolate 1 at up to 4 times the MIC, whereas the resistant variant from P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 could be selected at up to 2 times the MIC. All the resistant variants of S. algae selected either by a single step or by a sequential stepwise passage exhibited at up to 8-16 lg/ml of MIC, whereas those of P. aeruginosa ATCC 27853 showed up to 16 lg/ml of MIC Conclusion: We documented that S. algae, which was initially susceptible to imipenem, subsequently became resistant to imipenem during the treatment. We also demonstrated in vitro that the initial isolate of S. algae could easily develop resistance to imipenem when the organism was exposed to imipenem, suggesting that S. algae organisms have a propensity toward resistance to imipenem.

Appropriate antibiotic therapy based on microbiologic results needs for the management of peritonitis on CAPD patients. Objectives: Cefepime is a fourth generation cephalosporin with a broader spectrum of activity against Gram-negative and Gram-positive pathogens in comparison with all other cephalosporins. Due to the excellent antibacterial activity including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp. together with low rates of resistance and favourable pharmacokinetic and clinical properties, cefepime is a drug of choice for initial empiric treatment of severe nosocomial infections. Nevertheless, in addition to recommendations in guidelines, the surveillance of local resistance data is important for empiric treatment decisions in hospitals. Methods: In this study, the in vitro activity of cefepime (CEP), imipenem (IMI), piperacillin tazobactam (P/T), ceftazidime (CAZ) and cefotaxime (CFT) has been investigated against 1130 bacterial strains, isolated in the year 2004. MICs have been determined by microdilution method according to DIN 58940. Reference test strains were E.coli ATCC 25922, S. aureus ATCC 29213, P.aeruginosa ATCC 27853, and S.pneumoniae ATCC 49619. Results: Highest in vitro activity against Gram negative Enterobacteriaceae were determined for CEP and IMI with susceptibility rates for Enterobacter spp. 98%,98%, M.morganii 96%,92%, Proteus spp. 98%,96% and Citrobacter spp. 96%,100% whereas the susceptibility rates for P/T, CAZ and CFT were much lower (E.spp. 68%,72%,68%; M.m. 88%,72%,66%; P.spp. 96%,96%,66%; C.spp. 68%,76%,72%). For Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 100), susceptibility rates were 76% (CEP), 73% (CAZ), 72% (IMI) and 55% (P/T) with lowest resistance rates for CEP (6%) followed by CAZ (11%), P/T (14%), IMI (23%). The study confirmed excellent cefepime activity against Gram positive isolates (pneumococci, Streptococcus viridans and b-hemolytic Streptococci) and high cefepime susceptibility rates for Staphylococci (MSSA 99% and MSSE 98%) on contrary to ceftazidime (MSSA 44% and MSSE 42%). Conclusion: Regarding our in vitro data, CEP is a reliable treatment option for empiric therapy in patients with severe nosocomial infections, demonstrating high activity against Gram positive isolates, comparable activity in Gram negative Enterobacteriaceae to carbapenems (IMI) and lowest resistance rates in Pseudomonas aeruginosa.",

For the 30 strains tested, the fluoroquinolone MIC ranges were: 0.008-0.03 mg/L (GEM), 0.12-0.25 mg/L (GAT), 0.06-0.25 mg/L (MXF), 0.5-1 mg/L (LFX). Conclusions: MDR among SP is a phenotype that is widely dispersed geographically and is likely to be encountered regardless of the site of infection. Fluoroquinolones show activity against most MDR isolates. As the use of fluoroquinolone compounds increases, surveillance to monitor the prevalence of MDR and track the in vitro activity of agents such as GEM used for these resistant strains must be continued. Background: Multi-drug resistant (MDR) S. pneumoniae strains are increasing at an alarming rate worldwide. The therapy of respiratory tract infections due to these strains is challenging with an urgent need for antimicrobials with reliable activity against the MDR strains. Comparative activity of oral cephalosporins and parenteral cephalosporins against various pneumococcal MDR phenotypes was analysed in a large, multi-year international collection of clinical strains of S. pneumoniae. Methods: S. pneumoniae strains (21,605) collected during 1997-2003 from worldwide participants of the SENTRY Program were tested and interpreted using NCCLS (M7-A6, M100-S14) guidelines. The antimicrobial agents analysed included penicillin (PEN), erythromycin (ER), clindamycin (CM), tetracycline (TET) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TS); cephalosporins monitored included oral (cefpodoxime, cefuroxime) and parenteral (ceftriaxone, cefepime) agents.",

The susceptibility rate of all strains to the orally administered cephalosporins, cefpodoxime (77.6%) and cefuroxime (77.3%), dropped to only 16.1% and 14.5% respectively, for the five-drug MDR phenotype. The parenteral cephalosporins retained excellent activity for all MDR phenotypes, with resistance rates being lower for cefepime than ceftriaxone (cefepime, 1.3-1.9%; ceftriaxone, 3.0-4.4%) or the oral cephalosporins (cefpodoxime, 64.4-74.1%; cefuroxime, 69.3-79.1%) using respiratory infection breakpoints (NCCLS).

Exposure to GRN was also reduced when administered 2 or 4 hours after Maalox, by 22% and 16%, respectively. In contrast, when administered 4 hours before Maalox, GRN exposure was not affected. When GRN was administered 2 hours before Maalox, a small reduction (12%) in GRN exposure was observed that is unlikely to be clinically relevant. Half-life (mean range 11.5 to 14.2 hours) and Tmax (median range 1.5 to 2 hours) were similar across treatment groups. A single oral 600 mg dose of GRN was well tolerated. Mild adverse events were reported by 2 subjects; 1 subject discontinued due to mild abdominal pain and blood in the stool. Conclusions: Maalox does not affect GRN bioavailability when GRN is administered at least 2 h prior to Maalox. However, a reduction in GRN exposure is observed when GRN is administered concomitantly or up to 4 h after Maalox. Therefore, GRN can be administered 2 h before or 4 h after administration of Maalox or other products containing a high content of cations, particularly aluminum. Objectives: It has been demonstrated that fluoroquinolone treatment of humans and animals can rapidly select for bacteria with reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolone antibiotics. In recent years, there has been considerably interest in the concept of the mutant prevention concentration (MPC). The MPC has been defined as that concentration of antibiotic at which no mutants are selected from 10,000,000,000 organisms. In previous studies MPCs of ciprofloxacin and enrofloxacin were determined in vitro against Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium DT 104. Here the use of a chick model to investigate the MPC of enrofloxacin in vivo is reported. Methods: Chicks were experimentally infected with S. Typhimurium and treated with Baytril (enrofloxacin) at 50 ppm/10 mg/kg for 5 days (recommended therapeutic dose) or 2 days or 125 ppm/25 mg/kg for 2 days or 250 ppm/50 mg/kg for 1 day. Chicks received the dose in the drinking water (ppm) or by oral gavage (mg/kg). During and 24 hours after dosing, birds were killed and tissue samples (caecal contents, liver and sera) were taken and the levels of enrofloxacin and ciprofloxacin were determined in these tissues by HPLC or bio-assay. Caecal contents were also monitored for the presence of Salmonella during dosing and for up to 4 weeks after dosing. Selection of resistance was monitored by replica plating of colonies to media Clinical Microbiology and Infection, Volume 11, Supplement 2, 2005 containing 4x the ciprofloxacin and nalidixic acid MIC of the strain before treatment.Results: The only conditions where the antibiotic treatments did not select for reduced susceptibility (e.g. 4x MIC of parent strains) were in birds that received the antibiotic at 2.5x the dose for 2 days by oral gavage or 4x the dose for 1 day in the water. This oral gavage treatment also significantly reduced the counts of Salmonella compared to all other oral gavage treatments. For the oral gavage study, concentrations of fluoroquinolones in caecal contents were above the MPC for at least 6 hours after dosing for all treatment regimes. Conclusion: It was of interest to note that whilst the fluoroquinlone antibiotics are regarded as concentration rather time dependent antibiotics, the 2 day at 2.5x the dose was more effective at reducing the counts of Salmonella in both experiments than the 1 day at 5x the dose. These results would suggest that length of treatment as well as dose and route of administration, is critical in minimising the selection of fluoroquinolone resistance in vivo.",

Objectives: Quinolones can cause tendinitis and tendon ruptures. Retrospective studies and case reports reveal that an additional therapy with glucocorticoids increases the risk of quinolone-induced tendon disorders. Methods: We investigated possible combination effects of quinolones and glucocorticoids in an in vitro model with human tendon cells. Tenocytes were cultured for 1, 2, 3 and 4 days as monolayers and incubated with (a) ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin (3 mg/l), (b) 0.1 nM dexamethasone, and (c) ciprofloxacin or levofloxacin (3 mg/l) plus 0.1 nM dexamethasone. Immunoblotting was used to quantify changes in the amount of beta1-integrin, activated src homology collagen (shc) and of activated caspase-3 (casp-3). Furthermore, ultrastructural alterations were analysed by electron microscopy. Results: At 3 mg/l, ciprofloxacin caused a significant decrease of the amount of beta1-integrin from day 3 onwards, while no effect was seen with 3 mg levofloxacin/l medium or 0.1 nM dexamethasone compared to the untreated control. The combination of both quinolones (3 mg/l) with 0.1 nM dexamethasone resulted in an earlier onset of the beta1-integrin reduction: for ciprofloxacin + dexamethasone from the first day of incubation, for levofloxacin + dexamethasone from day 3 onwards. Quinolone-induced changes in signalling proteins, such as activated shc, are not fortified by dexamethasone at the concentration tested. Interestingly, the time and concentration dependent increase of the apoptosis marker activated casp-3 was intensified with dexamethasone.

Thus, the PK/PD characteristics of CIP XR vs. IR against ESBL strains was examined. Second, CIP is used in urinary tract infections (UTIs). Thus, the PK/PD profiles of CIP XR vs. IR in serum and urine were studied. Third, the PK/PD characteristics in either BHI or artificial urine were compared. Methods: Genotypically characterised ESBL producing E. coli (Ec) and K. pneumoniae (Kpn) and their wild type counterparts were exposed to the geometric mean plasma and urine concentration profiles following CIP 1000 mg XR qd, 500 mg IR bid and LEV (500 mg qd). The CIP and LEV urine concentrations were fitted from Phase I study data by compartmental modeling using TopFit 2.0. Bacteria were cultivated in a modified Grasso model at 37\u00b0C in brain-heart infusion broth as well as artificial urine acc. to Griffith et al.; viable counts were quantitated at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h. The areas under the bacterial kill curves normalised to the inoculum were calculated. Results: First, irrespective of the PK profiles simulated, the WT were eliminated rapidly. The ESBL producing Ec and Kpn were moderately to negligibly affected upon simulation of serum PK profiles of both CIP and LEV. Second, simulation of urine concentrations by using artificial urine IR and XR resulted in an elimination of the ESBL producers from the test system. LEV eliminated the ESBL producing K. pneumoniae but not the E.coli strain, which regrew. CIP XR killed the ESBL Kpn strain more rapidly than CIP IR or LEV. Third, PK/PD surrogates derived from studies in conventional media or artificial urine are significantly different. Conclusions: This model and the use of artificial urine predicts a more rapid and pronounced effect of CIP XR as compared to CIP IR or LEV. Objectives: The antibacterial spectrum of moxifloxacin includes all the major respiratory pathogens and its pharmacokinetics demonstrates high peak concentrations in plasma as well as at respiratory sites. Nevertheless, the tonsillar tissue concentrations have never been investigated.

Moxifloxacin was given orally od for 3 days. Moxifloxacin concentrations were measured by a validated HPLC assay and fluorescence detection. Each sample was analysed twice and the mean value obtained used for statistical analysis. Pharmacokinetic data were analysed by presenting descriptive statistics of moxifloxacin levels in plasma and tonsillar tissue. Results: Cmax occurred at 3h in plasma (mean value 3.20 mg/ L) and in tonsillar tissue (mean 8.96 mg/L). Tonsillar tissue/ plasma ratios (mean values) were constantly >2 mg/L at any collecting time, ranging between 2.37 mg/L (after 2 h) and 2.93 mg/L (after 24 h), which indicates a prolonged maintenance of moxifloxacin level in tonsillar tissue compared to plasma. Variability among pts was present at 6 h, the tonsillar tissue / plasma ratio ranging between 0.8 and 3.4 mg/L. Conclusions: Moxifloxacin achieves a good penetration in tonsillar tissue, which favourably compares with that reported for other fluoroquinolones. The moxifloxacin concentrations that we observed exceed the MICs of the usual respiratory tract pathogens. Objectives: Acute necrotizing pancreatitis is still related to a high mortality rate, based on local infectious complications, particularly due to bacterial infections of the necrotic pancreatic and parapancreatic areas. Limited penetration of antimicrobial drugs in these areas/compartments is considered to be a major cause of failure of therapy of severe local pancreatic infections. However, fluoroquinolones (e.g. ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin) have been shown to penetrate sufficiently into pancreatic tissue. On that score, the value of new quinolones such as moxifloxacin (MXF) has not been investigated yet. Using a rat model of acute necrotizing pancreatitis MXF has been demonstrated to penetrate rapidly and efficiently into pancreatic tissue, also into the inflamed and necrotic pancreas. Methods: Addressing the penetration capability of MXF following intravenous (IV) or oral (PO) administration with respect to the human pancreas, a prospective clinical trial was designed using a single IV (20 patients) or PO dose (40 patients) of 400 mg MXF for antimicrobial prophylaxis in patients undergoing pancreas resection.

TRAEs occurred in 38% of patients (164/428); the most common were nausea (8%), vomiting (6%), headache (5%), abdominal pain (4%), and diarrhoea (4%). Notably, gastrointestinal (GI) TRAEs occurred in 18% of healthy volunteers and 19% of patients. Treatmentrelated abnormal liver function test results were observed in 2% of healthy volunteers and up to 3% of patients. There were no clinically significant differences in mean QTc interval change from baseline in either population. Serious AEs (SAE) considered possibly or probably related to POS occurred in 35 (8%) patients and 1 healthy volunteer. The most common SAEs in patients were altered drug level, increased hepatic enzymes, nausea, rash, and vomiting (1% each). No significant trends related to age, sex, or race were observed in either group.

Conclusion: The safety profile of POS in patients was similar to that observed in a controlled population of healthy volunteers and is likely indicative of what will be observed in the clinical setting. Headache and GI events (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhoea) were the most common TRAEs observed in patients.

However, when POS was given with glipizide, glucose concentrations decreased in some healthy volunteers more so than after glipizide administered alone. Monitoring of cyclosporine and tacrolimus blood levels is warranted with POS coadministration, and dose adjustments of cyclosporine and tacrolimus should be made accordingly. Concomitant use of POS with rifabutin, phenytoin, or cimetidine should be avoided unless the benefits outweigh the risks, due to the decrease in POS concentrations. Objectives: The pharmacokinetics (PK) of many medications may be altered in the elderly population. Because alterations in PK can potentially affect clinical outcomes, the PK parameters of Posaconazole (POS), an extended-spectrum investigational triazole antifungal agent, were examined in healthy elderly persons ( \u202165 years), and the clinical implications of age-related PK differences were evaluated. Methods: We conducted a meta-analysis of POS steady-state PK data from 5 clinical studies in healthy volunteers. PK data from elderly healthy volunteers were compared with those of elderly patients with invasive fungal infections ( Objective: To develop a bioassay for measurement of CSP blood levels using the hypersusceptible C. albicans cell wall sensor mutant delta-mid2.",

BAL4815 was incubated at 1,10 and 100 lg/mL equivalent BAL4815 with rat, cynomolgus monkey and human liver microsomes for 120 min at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 1 mg/mL proteins. The extent of plasma protein binding of BAL4815 in rat, cynomolgus and human plasma was measured using the red blood cell partitioning method and 14C-BAL4815. Rats received a single oral dose of 10 mg/kg equivalent BAL4815 and a single intravenous dose of 5 mg/kg equivalent BAL4815 as BAL8557. Cynomolgus monkeys received single oral and intravenous doses of 3 mg/kg as BAL8557. Serial blood samples were obtained. Plasma concentrations of BAL4815 and BAL8557 were quantified using an HPLC/fluorescence method or a LC-MS/MS assay. Results: In plasma, BAL8557 is converted within minutes to BAL4815 in all species investigated. In the presence of rat, cynomolgus monkey and human liver microsomes, less than 10% of BAL4815 is metabolized during a 120 min period. BAL4815 is bound to plasma proteins with a free fraction of 3.5%, 3.6% and 2.2% in rat, cynomolgus monkey and human, respectively. After intravenous administration, the pro-drug BAL8557 is converted to BAL4815 within minutes. BAL4815 has a large volume of distribution with values greater than the total body water: 15 L/Kg and 5 L/kg in rat and cynomolgus monkey, respectively. BAL4815 is slowly eliminated with halflives of 5 h in rat and 10 h in cynomolgus monkey. After oral administration of the pro-drug, BAL4815 reaches Cmax-values between 2.0 to 3.5 hours.

A study was carried out to determine the pharmacokinetic (PK) and fungicidal activity of AC in plasma samples against 2 strains of C. albicans and 1 strain of A. fumigatus following single IV doses. Methods: Single IV doses of 75-300 mg of AC were administered to 12 healthy, male volunteers in a single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Individual plasma samples were collected from active and placebo (PBO) treated volunteers, serially diluted in 25% control plasma/75% growth medium, and the fungicidal titre determined on 2 C. albicans strains and inhibitory titre against 1 A. fumigatus strain.

Microbial samples were taken from surfaces before and after disinfection with UVC (33-47 min) and chloramine (5%, 1 h exposure) using standard contact plates (20cm 2 ). The UVC-distribution in the isolation units was monitored at 165 positions. The output on the floor varied between 0.08 and 3.2 W/m 2 , with an average ( \u00b1 SD) of 2.2 \u00b1 0.5 W/m 2 in the patient room, 2.0 \u00b1 0.7 W/m 2 in the sluice and 1.4 \u00b1 0.5 W/m 2 in the bath/ decontamination room. On other places, the values varied from 0.08 to 6.82 W/ m 2 . The units were UVC-disinfected for 33-47 min, corresponding to doses ranging from 160 J/m 2 in shadowed area to 19 230 J/m 2 at the highest exposed site. According to published UVC-dosimetry, the survival of bacteria and bacterial spores are reduced by 90% with doses ranging from 4-120 J/m 2 and 100-365 J/m 2 , respectively. Thus, UVC doses used in this study should be high enough to inactivate most bacterial organisms, including spores, even on surfaces not directly exposed to UVC. UVC-disinfection significantly reduced the bacteria on surfaces directly or indirectly exposed to UVC to a very low number (from ca 30 to 1-2 cfu/plate), as did 5% chloramine disinfection (fom ca 30 to 1-2 cfu per plate) alone; p < 0.001,and p < 0.001, respectively. Since cleaning before disinfection may be a risk for the staff in isolation units, disinfection with UVC-or chemicals should always be performed first. The presence of completely shadowed areas in the isolation unit (the bed rail, lockers, matresses etc.) still needs disinfection by chemicals before cleaning. Therefore, UVC may not be used alone, but is a good additive to chemical disinfection, to lower the biological burden of infectious agents in isolation units for high risk infectious patients.",

Methods: Samples were taken from each system without preflow or cleaning of the nozzle. These comprised 2 samples from 20 drinking water coolers each over 2 months, 1 sample per week from the tap water dispenser over 6 months, and samples from 6 different bottles of drinking water. Total colony counts were analysed at 22\u00b0C and 36\u00b0C, respectively. Total P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and coliforms, as well as sulphite-reducing clostridia were examined according to European Norms (EN ISO) for compliance with the German Drinking Water Ordinance 2001 (limit value for total colony counts at 22 \u00b1 2\u00b0C: 100 cfu/ml, at 36 \u00b1 1\u00b0C: 100 cfu/ml and 20 cfu/ml for bottled water).

Results: All the samples from the water cooler system exceeded German Drinking Water Ordinance threshold values. All the samples taken from the tap water dispenser, and, with one exception, all the samples from the bottled water complied with the German Drinking Water Ordinance. If more than 400 l of water are consumed per month, the tap water dispensing system and bottled water are more economical than the water cooler system ( 0.57 per l for water cooler, 0.45 for month tap water dispenser, 0.49 per l for bottled water). In economic terms, the water cooler system can only be recommended for consumption levels below 400 l per month. From an ecological point of view, the tap water dispenser is most favourable (expressed in CO2emissions per year for 403.720 l at Freiburg University Hospital), followed by the water cooler system and finally the bottled water.",

Methods: Literature studies of hand hygiene, a questionnaire based done survey (1700 per-sons/294 respondents) and qualitative interviews (N = 15) was performed in order to uncover the explanations for this low rate of compliance.The data was analysed and discussed on the basis of theories on action, experience, reflective thinking, control and rituals in order to aim for a broader view and under-standing of this field. Results: Both the questionnaire and interviews showed that hygiene still is a field that has great implications on the interactions between individuals. Furthermore it seemed difficult for the staff to draw a professional and not a private line between ''the clean and the unclean'' and thereby perform hand hygiene without compromising each other. Further the interviews showed that it is difficult for the staff to react on something they cannot see and that not gives an immediate result when staff does not act as pre-scribed.

We present here a patient who demonstrated a morphologically rare form of erysipelas like cutaneous leishmaniasis. A 74-year-old woman with a four-month history of erythema and edema on her nasal and left malar area was referred to our clinic for further evaluation. Her dermatological examination revealed an erythematous, edematous and fine desquamative plaque on her nose and left malar region resembling erysipelas. Other physical and laboratory findings were normal. Punch biopsy taken from the lesion and dyed with H.E revealed dense lymphocytic infiltration between the layers of just beneath the epidermis and deep dermis. In addition, a huge number of amastigots were found in macrophages and histiocytes that formed granulomas. In light of these findings the patient was diagnosed with cutaneous leishmaniasis and commenced a regimen of meglumin antimonat 425 mg b.i.d. After two weeks of therapy the lesion was gradually disappeared without any scar formation. In conclusion, cases with cutaneous leishmaniasis are still observed in our country not always with usual clinical appearance, but also like the present case, it may clinically resemble erysipelas and provides difficulties in the differential diagnosis.",

(1999)The studies differ in inclusion criteria and the diagnostic laboratory techniques used, esp. virological stool examinations Results: Incidence of gastroenteritis in the NIVEL (GP) study (after correction) was 79.5 per 10,000 personyears. This means that 80.000-130.000 persons will consult a GP annually for gastroenteritis. Incidence of gastroenteritis in the populationbased study was 283 per 1000 personyears. Giardia was detected in 14.8% of the cases in Haarlem, in 5.4% of the cases in the NIVEL study and 3.3% of the controls. For Cryptosporidium this was resp 3.3%, 2.1% and 0.2%. The diagnostic deficit decrease substantialy by testing for viral pathogens like NLV. Detection of pathogens was influenced by age, season and duration of symptoms. We were able to construct an algoritm for diagnostic workup in GI patients. Statistical surveys have been made for the effect of the climate on the epidemic diseases in tropical area, but not so much has been clarified on the relation between the variations of meteorological elements and of the number of patients. In this paper, we apply EOF analysis method to time series of diarrhoea patients and meteorological elements in Bangladesh, to understand effects of the meteorological variation to the prevalence of the diarrhoea disease. The EOF analysis of the time series of patients and meteorological elements averaged every two weeks for 21 years from 1981 to 2001 shows that in the dominating component, the anomaly of the number of the diarrhoea patients has different signs for the periods before and after June, corresponding to the two seasonal peaks of the number of the patients. Higher maximum temperature and more humidity in the pre-monsoon period are found to have a tendency to enhance the first peak of the diarrheal occurrence.

FR900098, as fosmidomycin, is an inhibitor of 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate (DOXP) reductoisomerase, an essential enzyme of the non-mevalonate pathway of isoprenoids biosynthesis. The biosynthesis of isoprenoids in Plasmodium is depending on this DOXP pathway, as found in eubacteria, algae and plants, but not in human. In plasmodium, the DOXP pathway is localised inside a plastid like organelle, the so-called apicoplast. Here, we report on the development of a high-performance capillary electrophoresis (HPCE) technique for the determination of FR900098 in serum. Various instrumental setting for migration (voltage, capillary temperature) were tested and the buffer properties (pH values, component molarities) were optimized. The assay was submitted to standard quality control procedures: within-, between-days reproducibility, accuracy, limits of detection (LOD) and quantification (LOQ), linearity, short and long term stability. Finally, the working buffer used was 14 mM KH2PO4 / 56 mM K2HPO4, 15% methanol, and 0.2 mM hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (HTAB). The pH was adjusted to 10.9. The electroosmotic flow was modified by the cationic ion pairing reagent, HTAB. The assays were linear over the large concentration range tested, from 0.25 to 100 lg/ml. The recovery of the sample pre-treatments was higher than 100%. Good precision was obtained, with betweendays reproducibilities resulting in coefficients of variation (CV%) of 2.1, 2.0 and 3.2%, and within-days reproducibilities of 0.6, 1.8, and 4.9% (CV%), for 100, 10, and 1 lg/ml, respectively. The LOD was 0.25 lg/ml, and the LOQ was 0.5 lg/ml. The studies of short and long-term stability of FR900098 in serum showed a good stability of the molecule, at room temperature, +4\u00b0C or )80\u00b0C. Moreover, FR900098 was resistant to numerous cycles of freezing and thawing. Indeed, after four freeze-thaw cycles (4 days), 94.9%, 101.0%, and 97.5% of FR900098 were recovered from the 100, 10, and 1 lg/ml samples, respectively. In conclusion, we have developed a convenient CE technique for the determination of FR900098 in serum which offers advantages of speed, sensitivity, and accuracy. At present, the procedure is applied for pharmacokinetic studies in an animal model of G\u00f6 ttingen mini-pig.",

Results: In the present study five vectors species of malaria were found in this study which had been previously recorded 3 decades ago. This district like other malaria endemic areas in Iran has been under pressure of anti malaria programmes including case finding and residual spraying insecticide as well as larviciding against the vectors since 1958. Annual incidence of malaria declined from 10.27 to 3.86 during ten years. The most transmission occurred in October to December when the temperature was suitable for vector activity in Kahnouj area. Electricity was recently supplied into the rural area where most malaria cases were found. Therefore, most houses equipped with air conditioner and the resident keep windows close, so they are secured from mosquitoes bites during hot season but not in beginning of spring and autumn when temperature is mild enough, in order to save the electricity cost, the residents do not use air conditioners whereas they leave windows open and no other protection against mosquito bites is provided. Residual spraying insecticide of indoor shelters have been stopped for five years and the most activity of antimalaria programme set up base on case finding. Conclusion; In order to control malaria, indoor residual spraying of insecticide would not assist effectively, so given knowledge to people to use bed net particularly in season people are more expose to mosquitoes bite may be considered as an effective measure in controlling malaria in Khanouj district. Also development in this area is effectively pushing back malaria in near future.

Case report: A 16 year old boy presented with fever and a generalized exanthema at the local dermatology clinic. The mixed appearance of pustules and umbilicated non purulent vesicles led to the suspicion of an Orthopoxvirus infection. The patient reported that little red dots had occurred 2 weeks earlier at the extremities after contact with a sick pet rat. 1-2 weeks later a generalized pustular exanthema appeared, which was associated with high fever (>39\u00b0C) and a pronounced feeling of sickness. Histologically no viral inclusion bodies were found in pustule material but poxvirus particles were detected by ELMI in swabs from pustule ground. Following the anamnestic suspicion of transmission by an infected rat, which unfortunately had perished soon afterwards, and the experience made at the recent monkeypox outbreak in the USA initiated by imported rats, one of the major aims was the exclusion of monkeypoxvirus. This was accomplished by PCR typing, which like ELMI had been established on occasion of the implementation of the Austrian plan for poxvirus preparedness (\u00d4Pocken-alarmplan\u00d5) and despite the diagnostic means for detection of variola vera also included the ability to discriminate between animal Orthopoxviruses. Additionally serological diagnosis was performed and presumably due to the protracted course of infection cowpox specific IgG antibodies were already present at admission with a titre of 1:800. Interestingly the humoral immune response initially seemed to be rather cowpox specific as there were no antibodies crossreacting with vaccinia virus detectable in indirect immunofluorescence. As an exclusive immune reaction with one species alone would be a very rare situation observed with orthopoxviruses we did more extensive testing by western blot analysis. Although not exclusively directed against cowpoxvirus antigens a very restricted reactivity of the patient serum was observed in the early course of infection using different recombinant and virus-derived Orthopoxvirus antigens. This would suggest that also serological methods might be able to give a hint towards rapid determination of Orthopoxvirus species, which certainly is also the case with immunological antigen detection methods.",

These 3 provinces are located at the northern parts of eastern Anatolia and southern parts of Black sea region. Temperature data have been observed and recorded by the Turkish State Meteorological Service (TSMS), and were available for 70 years in Sivas, for 40 years in Tokat, and for 60 years in Yozgat. Meteorology stations are located at the city centres, not at the airports. Temperature variations and trends for Turkey were analysed by using a data set including monthly averages of daily mean, and minimum temperatures. Annual rainfall, and the number of days in April with the temperature of > 5\u00b0C were also included in the analysis. In order to detect homogeneity in mean annual series, first a homogeneity analysis was performed by using the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis (K-W) test.

We analysed the in vitro activity of Posaconazole (POS), Voriconazole (VRC) and Caspofungin (CAS) against 59 strains of the genera Rhizopus, Mucor, Absidia, and Cunninghamella in different media compositions. Methods: The following five media compositions were compared: RPMI 1640 \u00b1 2% glucose, AM3 \u00b1 2 % glucose and HR-Medium. MICs were determined by microdilution method following NCCLS guidelines with minor modifications. Each well was read visually, the growth in each well was compared with the growth control. Two endpoints were evaluated for each drug: an inhibition of growth >90% war recorded as MIC1 and an inhibition of growth >50% was recorded as MIC 2. The final concentrations of the antifungal agents were 0.015-8 mg/l for POS and VRC, and 0.03-16 mg/l for CAS. Results: POS was significantly more active than CAS and VOR, both in R + G and in HR media (P < 0.05 when comparing the MIC1 of POS in HR medium to that of VRC; P < 0.001 for all other comparisons). Growth in RPMI and AM3 media supplemented with glucose was more robust than in the corresponding media lacking glucose. Glucose had little influence on MIC values. The agreement when comparing the MIC1 evaluated in AM3 \u00b1 glucose was > 85%, while the use of MIC2 endpoint yielded 100% agreement for all genera. When comparing the data obtained in RPMI \u00b1 glucose to that in HR, the agreement was good. The percentage agreements using the MIC2 and MIC1 endpoints were 100% and > 70%, In contrast, the agreement between AM3 \u00b1 glucose and the other media was generally poor. Moreover, the average MICs obtained in AM3 medium were lower than those obtained in either HR or RPMI which was due to a difference among genera. Conclusions: Our results suggest the following: a) POS is active in vitro against zygomycetes at clinically relevant concentrations. b) within zygomycetes, there are differences between genera in terms of their antifungal susceptibilies. c) growth medium is an important variable for MIC determination in zygomycetes, and the more relevant medium appears to be RPMI supplemented with 2% glucose. Objectives: Here we describe first clinical case of a caspofungin resistant C. glabrata infection. The patient was a 43 year old male with AML. He received a matched unrelated HSCT, 9 months prior to his death. He had a complicated hospital course which included C. glabrata sepsis. C. glabrata was cultured from his stool, from the time of transplant to death. Initial blood culture isolates were azole resistant and Amphotericin B was started. This was stopped due to renal insufficiency and caspofungin was started (MIC 0.12 lg/ml). He had a prolonged duration of therapy which comprised of alternating courses of IV voriconazole and caspofungin. Four months after initial fungaemia C. glabrata was cultured which was both caspofungin resistant (MIC > 8lg/ml) and azole resistant. Despite the addition of amphotericin B the patient died 8 weeks later. C. glabrata was isolated from the bone marrow at autopsy. Methods: The series of patient isolates, from time of transplant to death, had susceptibilities performed as per NCCLS document M27-A. The isolates were typed using Cg6 probe and MLST. Results: he susceptibilities demonstrated caspofungin resistance in the blood isolate ( > 8 lg/ml) and azole resistance in all but a few of the initial stool isolates. All the isolates were shown to be identical by Cg6 and were determined to be MLST group 1, which has previously been shown to be the most prevalent clade of C. glabrata worldwide.",

All tested isolates were fully susceptible to penicillin, levofloxacin, quinupristin/ dalfopristin and linezolid. Twenty different emm types were detected, of which emm1 (23.8%) and emm12 (21.4%) were most common, followed by emm85, emm60 and emm81. All emm1 types and emm12 types corresponded to the ST28 and ST36, respectively. Altogether, 24 different PFGE patterns, designated A-Y were discerned among the isolates, with two predominant profiles A (n = 10) and B (n = 9). Our study showed that all isolates possessed speB and speF genes, while the frequencies of speC and speA were 59.5% and 26%, respectively. Conclusion: Two clones predominated among GAS strains causing severe invasive disease in Poland; these clones were of emm type 1 and 12. We present 45 Actinomyces spp isolations, their identification to a species level and their clinical sources. In addition, we perform susceptibility testing of 23 of those strains to 13 drugs. The identification of Actinomyces spp was done taking into account their cultural features, growth\u00d5s atmosphere and biochemical and enzimatical tests, according to schemes proposed by Sarkonen N., Funke G., Moncla B.,Hillier S., and Bernard K. We studied too, the clinical sources of Actinomyces spp, if they were isolated lonely or in association with mucosa's normal flora. The susceptibility testing was performed by the agar dilution method, with Mueller Hinton agar supplemented with 5% sheep blood. The reading of minimum inhibitory concentration (MICs) were done after 48 hours incubation at 37\u00b0C in at atmosphere enriched with CO 2 . All strains were grown at 37\u00b0C on sheep blood agar plates with CO 2 added. A. radingae, A. europaeus, and A. odontolyticus were the most frequent isolated species ( 7 each one) followed by A. israelii, A. graevenitzii, A. turicensis and A. viscosus. In 27 isolations, Actinomyces spp were recovered as sole microorganism, and in the 18 remainder, in association with mucosa's normal flora. There were not relations between Actinomyces species and the clinical sources of the samples. MICs for penicilin, ampicilin and cefotaxime were from <0.016 to 0.25 lg/ml. There was a bimodal behaviour with macrolides : erythromycin, azithromycin and clarithromycin (MICs from 0.032 to 128 lg/ml) and the same was observed with quinolones: levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin and moxifloxacin (MICs from 0.032 to 8 lg/ml). All isolations presented MICs for vancomycin <0.125 lg/ml. The identification of the Actinomyces genus presents diagnostic difficulties due to its growth requirements. Some species are not so infrequent, and the sources from which they are recovered suggest that they may be of clinical relevance, for they are often isolated as sole pathogen.",

Methods: 52 male and female patients, 15-35 years of age, with moderate or severe acne, were randomized into two groups of 26 patients each. They received oral tetracycline hydrochloride 1 gram/day together with topical retinoid (differine gel 0.1%) or isotretinoin (Roaccutane) 1 mg/kg/day. The therapy was given for a 6-month period. Clinical evaluation (Leeds acne grading system and lesions counting) and bacterial samples were taken before the treatment started, during the treatment and 2 months after the treatment had stopped. Dermatology Life Quality Index questionnaire was completed by patients before and after treatment, in order to determine impairment of life quality. Results: Acne severity was significantly reduced by both regimens during therapy, and patients in the isotretinoin group continuously improved the acne scores after the treatment had stopped. After 6 months of treatment, isotretinoin produced greater lesion reductions than tetracycline. The mean per cent reduction in the different lesion counts was as follows: 83% versus 45% for non-inflammatory lesions (p < 0.01) and 80% versus 56% for inflammatory lesions (p < 0.01) in isotretinoin or tetracycline group, respectively.

Toxin genes were analysed by PCR and restriction mapping. Results: Most isolates (35, 92%) were methicillin-susceptible (MSSA), while 2 were methicillin-resistant (MRSA, mecApositive) and 1 borderline. Genotyping revealed a single MRSA clone and remarkable clonal diversity among the MSSA isolates (at least 20 distinct clonal lineages). Several clones (including 6 MSSA and the MRSA clone) were detected over prolonged times (2-8 years).

Our main objective was to investigate the situation in Romania lacking earlier data in the field. Methods: The strains used in this study were clinical isolates from nine regions in Romania. The strains were mainly blood isolates, but some were from other sterile sites. The in vitro susceptibility to antibiotics was tested by disk diffusion on PDM agar following the standard instruction. T-typing was performed by slide agglutination using sera from Sevapharma, Prague. Spe gene detection and emm sequence typing was performed according to provious publications. Results: During eighteen months 33 cases were reported. Most prevalent T-type was 3,13 followed by types 12 and 1. More than fifteen different emm types were recognised, most of them unusual types; only four were type 1. Half of the reported cases were from children below 12 years. Out of all strains, 50% harboured speC gene, and 25 harboured speA. Erythromycin resistance was uncommon (one isolate), whereas an overall high rate of tetracycline resistance was found (54%). Conclusion: This is the first report on severe invasive streptococcal infections since no surveillance has been previously done in Romania. The population covered was from eight out of 42 provinces. The emm type distribution might be of concern since many unusual types, not previously associated with severe disease, were found. This may be partly related to the dissemination of new types in populations immune to classical types.",

These isolates possess the Staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCC) mec type IV in their genome and a different pattern of antibiotic susceptibilities than hospital acquired strains. They are frequently virulent and cause predominantly skin and soft tissue infections by virtue of a Panton Valentine Leukocidin (PVL) toxin gene. A returning traveler, who had spent the preceding four weeks in Congo, presented with a staphylococcal bacteraemia and a large cutaneous ulcer of the right lower extremity that progressed to extensive soft tissue necrosis. He first experienced symptoms in Kinshasa International Airport, while awaiting his return flight to the United States, approximately 48 hours prior to presentation at our facility. Methods: MRSA that was isolated from blood was susceptible to vancomycin, clindamycin, erythromycin, tetracycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and gentamicin. Pulse Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis was performed using Sma1 on the patient's isolate along with another strain from our hospital and compared to other strains isolated from the Midwestern United States. PCR amplification of the genes encoding Panton-Valentin Leukocidin (PVL) was performed using primers described elsewhere. Results: PFGE demonstrated that the Congo strain was different from any of the other Midwestern United States strains. SCC mec typing of this isolate revealed that this strain was type IV. PCR analysis did not detect sequences specific for the PVL gene. Conclusions: The differential diagnosis of an ulcer in a returning traveler is large and includes bacterial, fungal, helminthic, protozoal, viral and arthropod borne causes. MRSA should be added to this list. The widespread occurrence of CA-MRSA in many parts of the world would support the finding of this organism on the African continent. To our knowledge, this represents the first CA-MRSA with the SCC type IV mec gene reported from Congo.",

Methods: All methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) isolated in Denmark between 1999-2003 were referred to and stored at the Staphylococcus Laboratory, Statens Serum Institut (N = 617). The isolates were characterized by macro-restriction (SmaI) analysis using PFGE, SCCmec typing, dru sequence typing, antibiotic susceptibility testing and PCR amplification of the Panton Valentine Leukocidin gene (pvl). Clinical and epidemiological information from all patients were obtained from discharge summaries and registered. Results: Between 1999 and 2003, the MRSA ST80-IV clone accounted for 28% (172/617) of the total number of MRSA in Denmark and 30% (146/490) of Infections due to ST80-IV had primarily community onset (122/146) and thereby ST80-IV accounted for 67% of all community onset MRSA in the period. More than 80% of the ST80-IV infections were skin and soft tissue infections. By comparing the antibiogram of ST80-IV (streptomycin-, kanamycin-, tetra-cycline-and fusidic acidresistant and gentamicin sensitive) with the isolates stored in our S. aureus bacteraemia collection, we traced the ST80-IV clone back to 1993. Before 1999 one to five ST80-IV isolates were encountered pr. year, which increased to 25, 26, 50, 26 and 45 isolates in the years after. By PFGE, the ST80-IV isolates exhibited nine different patterns (A1-9), of which 60% were type A1. Nine Type A1 isolates, isolated 1993-2003 were subjected to dru typing, which has earlier enabled separation of PFGE clones into subtypes. This was however not possible for the ST80-IV isolates. Conclusions: ST80-IV isolates cause a large proportion of the MRSA infections in Denmark and in particular among the infections with a community onset. The success of ST80-IV as an infective clone outside the hospital environment may in part be due to its small SCCmec type IV and its ability to cause skin and soft tissue infections probably associated with the expression of PVL. The dru sequence typing could not subdivide the major type of ST80-IV found in Denmark pointing out the strict clonality of this clone, which may indicate that it is a very well adapted pathogen.",

Methods: For each patient, a standardized questionnaire was completed. The questionnaire included demographic data (age, sex, previous hospitalizations\u2026) and the risk factors of the Braden scale. Detection of pressure ulcer was performed by skin examination of patients by two experts in skin care. Management of ulcer pressure was evaluated by reviewing the clinical charts of each patient with pressure ulcer. Each pressure ulcer was swabbed and inoculated on selective media. All the data were entered and analysed with EpiInfo 6.04d (CDC, Atlanta, Ga). Results: A total of 549 patients (59 \u00b1 19 years old) were included : 75 ulcer pressures were observed in 37 patients (prevalence = 6.9%). Heel anckle was the most frequent localization (40%), followed by sacrum (20%), elbow (11%), spinous processes (7%) and ischial tuberosities (7%). Pressure ulcers were stage I (24%), stage II (29%), stage III (31%) and stage IV (16%). Eighty percents of pressure ulcers were acquired within the hospital. Using univariate analysis, risk factors significantly associated with pressure ulcer were : Braden cutoff < 15 (OR = 6.56, p < 0.0001), neurological disorders (OR = 2.30, p = 0.009), previous ulcer pressures (OR = 6.36, p < 0.0001), and hospitalization in an intensive care unit (p = 0.0003). Among the criteria used for Braden scale, humidity, activity, motility, nutrition friction and shear were significantly associated with ulcer pressures (p < 0.05). Among the 75 pressure ulcers, 9.3% were diagnosed only by the experts in skin care and 83.8% were treated. Treatment was considered inappropriate in 31.5% (mostly in stage I and III) according to the French guidelines. Microbiological results showed that 24.5 % of ulcer pressures, mostly from stage III and IV were colonized with multiple resistant bacteria (i.e. methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus, extended spectrum beta-lactamase Enterobacteriaceae).",

This surveillance also contributed to a better knowledge of the mobile unit of geriatrics recently created within the hospital. Background: Following surgery for a musculoskeletal infection (MI), a positive suction drainage culture (SDC) is consistent with persistent sepsis and an unfavorable evolution in the majority of cases. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of a negative SDC obtained in a subsequent operation or repeated operations on the outcome of MI. Methods: One hundred patients treated surgically for MI utilizing suction drainage for 24-48 hours postoperative and appropriate antimicrobial therapy were enrolled in this prospective study. Surgical treatment consisted of the routine practice developed for the treatment of MI, consisting of drainage of purulent material, d\u00e9bridement, and prosthetic exchange or implant removal. The accumulated drainage fluid in the reservoir was cultured. SDC was considered negative if all bottles resulted in negative cultures. Patients were placed into one of three possible MI treatment groups according to the SDC results identified after the first surgical procedure, as follows: (I) Patients with a negative SDC and no new operation was performed; (II) Patients with a positive SDC and a new operation(s) was performed until the SDC was negative; and (III) Patients with a positive SDC and there was no new operation. The duration of antibiotic therapy for those with osteomyelitis ranged from 6 to 12 weeks, while others with MI (soft tissue infection) were treated for 10-21 days. Results: The 3 groups were similar with regards to gender, age, underlying conditions, MI, bacterial organism, surgery, and antibiotic therapy. The majority of patients (84%) had osteomyelitis in the presence of an implant. At final review, a cure was obtained in 90% of patients (45 of 50) in group I, 87% of patients (20 of 23) in group 2, and 44% of patients (4 of 9) in group 3. Conclusion: A negative SDC following MI surgery is a strong indication as to the eventual outcome of the infectious process.",

Objective: To know the microbial etiology of osteomyelitis of the foot in diabetic pts, to determine the best choice empirical antibiotics combination. Methods: Diabetic pts with osteomyelitis of the foot admitted in our unit between 2002 and 2004 were included. The infection was documented with intraoperative samples and osteomyelitis was histolopathologically prouved. Clinical and biological data were collected. Results: 87 diabetics pts (64 males, 23 females) with a median age 65 years(23-94) were included.The co-morbidities were chronic renal failure (n = 35), arteriopathy (n = 34), obesity (n = 13), alcoholism (n = 10), immunodepression (n = 10).

While cSSSI can be caused by a mixture of Grampositive and -negative bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus and streptococci are the predominant pathogens. Previous analyses combining all pathogens have failed to identify an exposureresponse (ER) relationship. A method was developed to create more homogenous pt populations for the microbiological (M) ER analysis of T in the treatment of cSSSI. Methods: Pts from 3 cSSSI clinical trials (one Phase 2 & two Phase 3) with T pharmacokinetic data and classified as both clinically and M evaluable, were pooled for analysis. Pts received 100 mg loading dose (LD)/50 mg q12h (100/50) or 50 mg LD/25 mg q12h (50/25). At the test of cure visit, M (eradication or persistence) response was evaluated. Indeterminate responses were excluded. Non pathogenic baseline isolates were excluded. Five homogeneous pt cohorts (C) were created based on baseline pathogens: S. aureus only (C1); S. aureus or streptococci (C2); 2 Gram-positive pathogens (C3); polymicrobial (C4); other monomicrobial infections (C5). Prospective step-wise procedures for combining C to increase sample size were used. Logistic regression was used to evaluate steady-state 24 hr area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) to MIC ratio (AUC/MIC) to predict response. Results: The dataset included 58 pts with 88 observations. C1 (n = 20) and C2 (n = 9) could not be evaluated due to small sample size. Analysis began with pooled C2 + C3. Continuous AUC/MIC ratio was marginally significant (p = 0.1130); a pt was 5.1% more likely to have successful response for every oneunit increase in AUC/MIC. Adding C4, including pathogens with MIC values up to 16 mcg/mL, decreased AUC/MIC, added cures to the lower end of the distribution, and added significant noise to the analysis. Adding C5 increased sample size and further decreased the ability to detect a relationship. Conclusion: Analysis of all pathogens combined could not identify an ER relationship. Polymicrobial infections with Gramnegative and anaerobic pathogens, associated with high MIC values, added noise to the analysis and decreased the predictive capability of the model. The approach of creating homogenous populations based on two key pathogens in cSSSI, S. aureus and streptococci, was critical for identifying significant ER relationships.",

Pt covariates included: age, weight, country, baseline Pseudomonas aeruginosa or anaerobes, & comorbidities (diabetes, peripheral vascular disease). Classification and regression tree (CART) analyses determined AUC/MIC breakpoints (BP). Logistic regression (one observation/pt) was performed to determine predictors of efficacy. Results: The dataset included 35 pts with 40 S. aureus and/or streptococcal baseline pathogens. MIC values ranged from 0.06 to 0.5 mcg/mL. Clinical cure was achieved in 30 (85.7%) pts and 35 (87.5%) pathogens were successfully eradicated. The median AUC/MIC ratio was 13.5 and 29 for the 25 and 50 mg dose groups, respectively. Covariates were not significant predictors of efficacy. CART identified a significant AUC/MIC BP of 12.5 (p = 0.0177 for M and 0.0341 for C). The continuous AUC/MIC ratio was marginally significant based on sample size (p = 0.0563 for M & 0.1960 for C) and was deemed the most informative model. For each unit increase in AUC/MIC, within the observed range, pts were 3.7% more likely to have a successful C response and 17.1% more likely to have a successful M response. Conclusion: Pts with AUC/MIC ratios \u202112.5 were 13.5 times more likely to have successful M response. At the median AUC/ MIC ratio of 13.5 & 29 for the 50/25 & 100/50 dose groups, the model-predicted probability of C success was 0.66 & 0.96, respectively. T is likely to be an important treatment option for cSSSI. Introduction: Vertebral osteomyelitis and/or sacroiliitis due to Streptococcus pneumoniae are extremely rare. Although it is one of the most common pathogen isolated in blood cultures, there are only about 30 cases reported in the literature. In the main series of vertebral osteomyelitis (VO) SPSI represents less than 1% of cases (1/587). Material and methods: We report 6 cases of spinal infection due to S. pneumoniae (5 VO and 1 SI with psoas abscess) seen between 1999 and 2004 at 4 different acute care hospitals. Results: The 6 cases reported were part of a total of 1227 episodes of pneumococcal bacteraemia (0.48%).Mean age of the patients was 57.1 years (range 37-82); there were 4 men. Alcohol abuse 2/6, immunosupression 2/6 and smoking 4/6 were the most common comorbilities. Blood cultures were positive in all cases, epidural pus and vertebral biopsy were also positive in 3/ 6. All strains were susceptible to penicillin. Diagnoses were made by MRI in 4 and CT scanning 2. All patients recived betalactam agents during a mean of seven weeks (3.8-10.7) in monotherapy (cefotaxime 4/6, ampicillin 1/6) or in combination (with vancomicin+gentamicin in 1 case). One case needed surgery, because of progression of a psoas abscess. Other foci were found in three cases (psoas and paravertebral abscesses and acromio-clavicular arthritis). Conclusions: SPSI is a rare presentation of invasive pneumococcal disease. Underlying disease is comnmon and other territories are frequently involved. Infective endocarditis must be ruled out. Its course appears to be benign. Beta-lactam antibiotics are a good option, and surgery is occasionally indicated for progressive disease despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy.",

Methods: Incident cases were defined as 24,559 individuals who redeemed a prescription for a topical ocular antibiotic in 1999 in North Jutland County, Denmark. Ten gender-and agematched population controls per case were selected, using a unique personal identifier. Diabetes prior to the topical ocular antibiotic prescription was determined by record-linkage with the County Prescription Database and Hospital Discharge Registry. We did conditional logistic regression to estimate odds ratios (ORs) for ocular antibiotic use among diabetic individuals and population controls, with adjustment for a range of comorbid diseases. Results: Among individuals treated with topical ocular antibiotics, 2.5% had diabetes as compared with 2.0% among control subjects. The overall adjusted OR for use of ocular antibiotics in diabetic individuals was 1.24 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.13-1.35). Stratified analyses showed that children between 3 and 15 years with diabetes had a 60% increased relative risk for ocular antibiotic use, whereas the effect of diabetes as a risk factor was low in individuals over 65 years and in those with presence of other diseases.

Only for chloramphenicol and ciprofloxacin the MIC90s were in the susceptible or intermediate susceptible range for all three pathogens, whereas this was not the case for the other antibiotics tested, of which at least one MIC90 was in the resistant range. Conclusion: In only one thirdth of the patients suspected of infectious conjunctivis in general practice a bacterial pathogen was found. Although the prescription of antibiotics can be debated on the basis of our results, chloramphenicol and ciprofloxacin seems to be superior above fusidic acid, trimethoprim, and gentamicin.",

Method: Primary school children were examined using a slit lamp and several were noted to display follicular/papillary conjunctivitis suggestive of trachoma. To confirm the etiology of the condition, children were examined on a follow-up visit. For each subject, after examination with the slit lamp, the upper lid was everted after the application of a topical anesthetic (Novesin), and a dacron swab was passed along the upper tarsal lengthwise four times. Strict aseptic precautions were employed to prevent cross-contamination during sample collection. Swabs were placed in DNA-free tubes, transported to Hong Kong, and tested using the Roche Amplicor kits for detection of Chlamydia trachomatis following the manufacturer\u00a1s instructions. Twenty children displayed significant conjunctival signs and photographs of the everted upper lids were taken to determine if these visual signs correlated with presence of trachoma as confirmed by PCR. Results: Sixty-five of 120 primary school students were willing to be tested, and 29% of these were positive for trachoma by PCR. Comparison of photographs and PCR result indicated that not all children who showed signs of conjunctivitis were positive for trachoma. In addition, some children whose eyelids displayed milder form for conjunctivitis were positive by PCR. No obvious corneal involvement was observed for these children. Conclusions: It was confirmed that hyper-epidemic levels of trachoma can be found among ethnic minority children in Du\u00a1an county. This may be related to the poor hygiene standards and the scarcity of water in this limestone region. PCR was not positive for all children showing signs of follicular/papillary conjunctivitis, which may indicate that some cases were in a dormant stage. It is also possible that failure to detect the organism was due to sampling error or delay in PCR analysis. Nevertheless, the high level of infection is a cause for concern as trachoma remains one of the leading causes of blindness, and further investigation and treatment are warranted.",

Basca (Constanta, RO) Introduction: Anthrax is by primarily a disease of herbivores but humans can become infected as they come into contact with infected animals or their products. Objective: To study the cases of human anthrax diagnosed in the last twelve years and their characteristics: epidemiology, clinical forms and evolution. Material and method: It is a retrospective study on a period of twelve years performed in Infectious Diseases Clinical Hospital. The diagnosis was based by smear, and culture of vesicular fluid or CSF. Results: During this period fifteen cases of anthrax in humans were identified. The repartition of cases according to sex groups revealed a high predominance of male cases (13 cases). The disease was most prevalent in 35-44 age group and after 55years old (6 cases), although anthrax can be observed between 15 years and 65 years. In all cases anthrax was occupational disease and the provenience of patients was rural area. The annual incidence of anthrax was characterized by a low value and irregular frequency of the disease. The most cases were in 1994 (6 cases) and 2004 (5 cases). According to the seasonal repartition, anthrax was most prevalent in the summer months (11 cases). The most frequent clinical form of anthrax was the cutaneous anthrax (14 cases), and only one patient achieved anthrax meningitis. Under specific treatment with penicillin G, all the patients with cutaneous anthrax recovery complete, only the patient with anthrax meningitis died. Conclusions: In Constantza County, anthrax remained sporadic in the last years. After a free period (2001) (2002) (2003) 5 cases of coutaneous anthrax were registered in 2004. A good cooperation between veterinary and physicians and individual awareness of the materials is the key to prevention of anthrax. hemolytic activity. All of the 30 strains tested have hemopeptic activity, which is indirect evidence of their virulence. The strains have no phosphatase enzymes or lecithinase. The strains we studied ferment glucose, sucrose, glycerin, and rhamnose, and they form acid without gas. The strains all grew in synthetic \"A\" medium, although growth was weak. When L-tyrosine, Ltryptophan, L-threonine, and L-methionine were added to the synthetic \"A\" medium, the pathogen grows in the typical manner. Two anthrax strains are moderately resistant to rifampicin (MIC 1.5-16), and three are not sensitive. The anthrax strains are highly sensitive to tetracycline, benzylpenicillin, gentamycin, and oxacillin. Conclusions: Regardless of their source of isolation and time of storage, the anthrax strains isolated during outbreaks are virulent, spore-forming, and capsule-forming cultures. This study confirms that virulent forms of B. anthracis are still circulating in Kazakhstan.

            "text": "Objectives: Isolation of anthrax bacillus using bacteriological methods is slow and frequently misleading. The literature suggests anthrax bacillus is isolated in 13% to 48% of patients infected with Bacillus anthracis. The pathogen quickly perishes or transforms into atypical forms. The number of bacilli in a clinical specimen is often low or below the sensitivity of culture. This suggests other methods would be useful in establishing the diagnosis of anthrax, specifically; serological methods would be beneficial in diagnosing infection with Bacillus anthracis. Methods: We conducted studies to assess various methods for diagnosis of Bacillus anthracis infection in patients. We reviewed archival data and our own results on pathological material from patients infected with Bacillus anthracis in the Southern and Eastern Kazakhstan oblasts. Results: The most informative test for detection of anthrax in patients was the delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) or dermatoallergic test with anthraxin. Eighty one per cent of patients with signs and symptoms of anthrax gave a positive reaction with anthraxin. The Ascoli reaction complete with scab was positive in 72.1% of patients, and the indirect hemeagglutination (IHA) test was positive in 65.6% of patients. The clinicoepidemiological diagnosis of anthrax was confirmed with culture in 44% of cases. Serum samples from patients diagnosed with anthrax in the Eastern Kazakhstan oblast were evaluated using IHA in 2001-2004. High titres of specific antibodies (1:640-1:5120) were detected in patients with dermatologic anthrax lesions from which anthrax was isolated. Conclusion: Our data suggest the anthraxin DTH test and IHA are good methods for establishing a diagnosis of anthrax. Cultures for anthrax bacillus were the least efficient method for establishing the diagnosis. When results of laboratory tests are negative or inconclusive, one still has to rely on the clinicoepidemiological diagnosis.

Objectives: The fluoroquinolones are bactericidal agents frequently used in the treatment of respiratory tract infections. The viridans Streptococci (VGS), although associated with disease, generally exist as part of the normal human oral flora. As such, they may exposed to antibiotics with greater frequency than oppurtunistic pathogens. Preliminary data suggest that the VGS may act as a reservoir for fluoroquinolone resistance in S.pneumoniae through horizontal transfer. Here, we compared the killing kinetics of moxifloxacin (MXF) and levofloxacin (LEV), against VGS at simulated saliva concentrations. Methods: Eight strains of VGS, 4 S. mitis (2 with parC mutation) and 4 S.oralis, (2 with parC mutation) were challenged with MXF and LEV in a pharmacodynamic model utilizing Mueller-Hinton broth supplemented with 5% lysed horse blood. Cultures were inoculated at a density of 1 \u00b7 108 cfu/ml, incubated at 35ordm;C, and examined for viable growth at 0, 1, 2, 4, 6, 12, and 24 hrs after exposure to the antibiotics at concentrations simulating salivary levels. Salivary concentrations of MXF (400 mg), and LEV (500 mg) were 3.19 and 3.71 lg/ml respectively. Protein binding of MFX and LEV were taken to be 50% and 30%. Adjusted salivary levels were 1.6 (MXF) and 2.6 (LEV) ug/ml. PCR was used to amplify parC and gyrA, and mutations detected by DNA sequencing. Results: Both MXF and LEV were highly bactericidal against susceptible strains of VGS at salivary concentrations. MFX typically eradicated the VGS by 6 hours and LEV by 12-24 hours. For parC mutants, both MXF and LEV were consistently bactericidal resulting in eradication after12 hours for MXF and 24 hours for LEV. Regrowth was observed in both strains of S.mitis (parC) exposed to LEV (2 of 10 experiments). The MIC of these strains to LEV increased 4 fold and DNA sequencing revealed the selection of a gyrA mutation in each strain. No regrowth was detected in the S. oralis strains. Conclusions: Both MXF and LEV are extremely active against susceptible VGS at concentrations of drug found in saliva, however, superior killing kinetics were consistently observed with MXF. MXF consistently eradicated strains with a parC mutation, however, regrowth was observed on 2 occasions with LEV suggesting that MXF may be less likely to drive resistance among VGS. Again, this may have implications due to the ability of VGS to exchange its genetic determinants with S. pneumoniae.",

The cells were incubated with antibiotic concentrations within the therapeutic range and above (0.5-2 Cmax) for time periods up to 8 hours. The extra-and intracellular concentrations were determined by HPLC-UV. The viability of the cells was controlled using the Trypanblue-exclusion assay. Phagocytosis and oxidative burst were assessed by a combined flow cytometric assay after stimulation of the cells with serum-opsonised fluorescein-isothiocyanate-conjugated E. coli in the presence of dihydroethidium as an indicator of superoxid production. A two-compartement chamber system was used to study the influence of either fluorochinolone on the chemotaxis. Results: With either cell type, Moxifloxacin accumulated rapidly with peak concentrations within 15 min whereas intracellular maximum concentrations of Ciprofloxacin were achieved after 2 h. The accumulation rate of both antibiotics inside the native PMNs was more than twice as high as in differentiated EISS \u00d2 cells. Neither Moxifloxacin nor Ciprofloxacin showed a significant influence on viability and the immune response parameters phagocytosis and oxidative burst of native PMNs; chemotaxis ability was reduced to a minor degree.Viability and phagocytosis of the diffentiated EISS \u00d2 -cells remain unaffected whereas the oxidative burst appeared decreased. Chemotactic acticity of EISS \u00d2 -cells could not be stimulated. Conclusions: A significant accumulation of Moxifloxacin and Ciprofloxacin was determined in both cell types. However, no relevant influence on viability, phagocytosis, oxidative burst, and chemotaxis was observed. Hence no hints were found suggesting a restricted use of Moxifloxacin and Ciprofloxacin for immunocompromised patients.",

The latter two were not tested for Klebsiellae. S. aureus was additionally tested for oxacillin resistance and K. pneumoniae was tested for production of extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). DIN breakpoints were used where applicable. Results: Overall, 1859 pathogens of 1,811 hospitalised patients with respiratory tract infections were analysed. Results for moxifloxacin are summarized in table 1. Of S. pneumoniae isolates 93.3% were susceptible to penicillin G and 85.7% to clarithromycin. With an MIC90 of 1 mg/l, the in vitro activity of levofloxacin was markedly lower than that of moxifloxacin. H. influenzae showed almost 100% susceptibility to fluoroquinolones, but only 4.5% to clarithromycin (MIC90 32 mg/l). As beta-lactamase production is common among H. influenzae isolates in Germany, amoxicillin/clavulanate showed far higher susceptibility rates than penicillin G (87.9% vs. 1.0%). Due to a high rate of beta-lactamase production only 9.8% of Moraxella isolates were susceptible to penicillin G, compared with 99.1% to amoxicillin/clavulanate. Moraxella isolates were fully susceptible to the fluoroquinolones. Overall, 13.0% of Klebsiella isolates produced an ESBL. Interestingly, ESBL prevalence was 38.8% in Eastern Germany, but below 10% in Western Germany. ESBL producers of Klebsiella were less susceptible to antibiotics other than cefotaxime or ceftazidime than non-ESBL producers.",

Moxifloxacin showed a high activity against current respiratory pathogens in Germany and was the most active fluoroquinolone, in particular against Gram-positive pathogens. Objectives: Drug combinations have become the best choice in treatment of serious infections with resistant microorganisms including P. aeruginosa (PA). We tested Ciprofloxacin (CIP) in double and triple combinations with ceftazidime (CAZ), imipenem (IMP), piperacillin (PIP), and amikacin (AMK) against 20 MDR clinical isolates of PA. Methods: The MIC for each drug alone was determined by broth microdilution technique described by NCCLS. Double and triple combinations of CIP with other drugs were tested by using 96-well plates and by time-kill assay. Rows A to G were activity of moxifloxacin on S. pneumoniae (Sp), H. influenzae (Hi) and M. catarrhalis (Mc) clinical isolates collected from the respiratory tract by determination of the MIC's using the Etest and to compare these results against 9 other antimicrobial agents.These results were also compared for Sp versus those of the previous study (winter periods 2000-2002) for interpretive criteria S -I -R (according the NCCLS -breakpoints). Methods: 10 Belgian university and non-university medical microbiology laboratories participated during the past winter period in this multicentre in-vitro evaluation of moxifloxacin.

The aim of this study was the use of Norfloxacin VITEK MICs value as alternative marker to detect Nalidixic acid resistant enterobacteria strains. Material and methods: A total of 1013 isolates of Enterobacteriaceae were analyzed and routinely inoculated into the VITEK 2 ID-GNB and AST-N020 cards (bioM\u00e9rieux) and then loaded into the VITEK 2 system, as recommended by the manufacturer. Ninety-six strains with a higher Norfloxacin VITEK MIC value (1-4 mg/L), but still within the susceptibility range established by the NCCLS breakpoints, and 100 strains with a Norfloxacin VITEK MIC \u00a30.5 mg/L were selected. They were further tested with a 30 microg-Nalidixic acid-disk (Nal) (Oxoid) according to NCCLS reference. Results: The Norfloxacin 1-4 mg/L and susceptible to ciprofloxacin phenotype represented the 9% of total isolates loaded in the VITEK system during the study, similar to the prevalence observed in previous analysis in Spain. Both selected groups, one with the highest and the other with the lowest Norfloxacin VITEK MIC value, included 60% and 58% E. coli isolates, 8% and 20% S. enterica isolates, respectively. Among the Norfloxacin VITEK MIC 1-4 mg/L strains 93 isolates (98%) were Nal resistant, and 76 (79%) were ciprofloxacin susceptible. The agreement between Norfloxacin VITEK MIC \u00a30.5 mg/L and Nal susceptibility was foun in 97 (97%) strains. Two isolates (one E. cloacae and one K. pneumoniae) with Norfloxacin VITEK MIC 1-4 mg/L were Nal-S and 3 isolates (two E. coli and one P. mirabilis) with Norfloxacin VITEK MIC \u00a30.5 mg/L were Nal-R. Conclusion: When using VITEK 2 system for enterobacteria, the consideration of MIC of norfloxacin >0.5 mg/L could be an alternative marker of nalidixic acid resistance (and decreased susceptibility to fluoroquinolones).",

This pathogen is intrinsically resistant to many antibiotics and can easily develop resistance towards many currently available agents. Natural resistance can be attributed to the low permeability of the P.aeruginosa outer membrane to a variety of antibiotics including glycopeptides (GLYs). Since GLYs are powerful antibiotics against grampositive bacteria and resistance is very rarely develop, it seemed interesting to evaluate the effect of combining these antimicrobial agents with antibiotics that might disorganize the structure of the outer membrane allowing the entrance of glicopeptides into the gram-negative cells. In order to verify this hypothesis, ceftazidime (CAZ) has been tested in association with vancomycin (VAN) or teicoplanin (TEI). The same experiments have been carried out also in the presence of azithromycin (AZI), which is normally a non anti-pseudomonal agents but has been shown to interfere with some virulence factors.",

Results were interpreted as synergism (99%), additivity (90%), and indifference (10%) of the CFU/ml reduction found in the drugs combination in comparison to the drug alone.The same experiments have been repeated adding AZI (16 mg/l) and using GLYs at concentrations ranging from 500 to 300 mg/l. Results: CAZ in combination with GLYs reacted synergically in 20 out of 59 cases, additivity was found in 31/59 interactions and indifference was noted in 8/59 tests. Preliminary results (12 tests performed) indicated that the addition of AZI increased the incidence of synergisms and additivities even when using GLYs concentration of 300 mg/l. Conclusions: CAZ combined with GLYs gave additive or synergistic results in the great majority of experiments, while the simultaneous combination of AZI, CAZ and a GLY always produce an additive or synergistic effect against P. aeruginosa. These data, given the high concentration of GLYs employed, could be of particular interest in clinical situations where the drugs could be topically administered.",

The global escalation of penicillin (P) and macrolide (M) resistant SP has compromised the use of beta-lactam and macrolide compounds. TL was reported to be active against P and M resistant SP. Objectives: Garenoxacin (GRN) is an investigational des-F(6)quinolone with enhanced in vitro activity against gram-positive cocci. The global escalation in antimicrobial resistance amongst respiratory tract pathogens -particularly SP-has highlighted the importance of quinolone compounds for treating SP infections. The mutant prevention concentration (MPC) is a novel in vitro measurement that defines the drug concentration threshold that would require an organism to simultaneously acquire two or more resistance mutations for growth in the presence of the drug. We measured the MICs and MPCs for GRN against clinical isolates of SP, including multidrug resistant strains and those with elevated MPCs to levofloxacinGRN. Methods: Microbroth dilution in accordance with NCCLS guidelines was followed for MIC testing using Todd-Hewitt broth and two-fold concentration drug increments. For MPC testing, \u20211 billion organisms were applied to agar plates containing GRN, incubated at 35-37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 and screened for colony growth at 24 and 48 hours. The MPC was the lowest drug concentration that completely prevented growth. Select organisms with GRN MPC values >2 lg/ml were screened for amino acid substitution in the quinolone resistance determining region. great concern nowadays because the therapeutical alternatives are limited. Fusidic acid inhibits protein synthesis. It has only a few side effects and is usually well-tolerated by patients as an oral drug.

Synergy was evaluated by means of checkerboard assay against 50 (double combinations) and 25 (triple combination) MRSA strains isolated from respiratory tract infections and by means of time kill curves (5 strains). In checkerboard assay synergy was defined as fractional inhibitory concentration index (FICi) of <0.5, additivity as FICi >0.5 and >1, indifference as FICi >1 and antagonism as FICi >2, while in time kill studies synergy was defined as a >2 log decrease in bacterial count of combinations in respect to the most active single drug. Moreover, mutational rates of single and combined drugs at antimicrobial concentrations equal to the resistance breakpoints were calculated in 10 strains Results: Synergy and additivity were the prevalent effects, while no antagonism was observed in checkerboard assay. In particular, LVX + VA/TP and CTX + TP/VA gave synergy in 16/50, 9/50, 43/50 and 23/50 strains, respectively. Combinations of LVX + VA + CAZ/CPM/PTZ and of LVX + TP + CAZ/CPM/PTZ yielded synergy or additivity in all the tested strains, with combinations of LVX + TP + CAZ / PTZ giving synergy in 20/25 strains. Time kill curves evidenced synergy for LVX/CTX + VA/TP after 12 and 24 h of incubation. Synergistic triple combinations occurred more frequently with LVX + TP than with LVX + VA after 12 and 24 h. For single antibiotics, mutational frequencies ranged between 10-5 and <10-9 for LVX, CTX, AMK and IMI, and <10-9 for VA and TP. When tested in double and triple combinations, mutational frequencies fell below 10-9 for all the combinations.

Susceptibility testing methods can be significantly influenced by Ca 2+ variations in agar and broth. NCCLS broth microdilution (BMD) uses a final physiologic level of 50 lg/mL calcium for DP testing. E-test DP is a unique gradient which incorporates a constant level of calcium. E-test DP has been shown to be equivalent to BMD when tested with commercially available Mueller Hinton (MH) agar. Since Isosensitest (ISO) is used in some parts of Europe, and has an inherently low level of calcium (approximately 5-10 lg/mL), it is important to evaluate the performance of E-test DP on ISO in comparison to BMD. Method: A 3 lab study compared E-test DP on ISO to NCCLS BMD.

Methods: The erm(B)-positive C. difficile strain CD51 was used in filter matings as donor, whereasthe B. fibrisolvens strain 1.230, tetracycline resistant, and the B. fibrisolvens strain 2221R, rifampicin resistant, were used as recipients. The strains were cultured in M2GSC broth, with 30% of sterile rumen, in anaerobic conditions and the filter matings were performed on sheep blood agar plates, supplemented with hemin (0.1%) and vitamin K (0.1%). The same medium, supplemented with erythromycin (20 mcg/ml) and tetracycline (10 mcg/ml), were used to select the transconjugants. MIC values were assessed by E-tests. The erm(B) transfer was confirmed by PCR and by hybridisation assays, using an erm(B) probe on transconjugant genomes digested with PvuII and with SmaI (PFGE). Results: The transfer average frequency was 5 \u00b7 10 )7 . MIC values for erythromycin were >256 mg/l both in donor and transconjugants. An internal fragment of the erm(B) gene (730 bp) was amplified in all the transconjugants and a specific band was visualised in hybridisation assays on transconjugant genomes digested with both PvuII and SmaI. The re-transfer of the erm(B) gene from B. fibrisolvens transconjugants to C. difficile 1977, an erythromycin susceptible strain, was also obtained. Conclusion: The in vitro transfer of the MLSB resistance gene erm(B) from C. difficile to B. fibrisolvens and vice-versa, is an important result supporting the possibility that horizontal transfer of resistant genes between human pathogenic bacteria and animal commensal microorganisms could occur, under natural conditions, more easily than expected.

Methods: The study was conducted in a University Hospital in Turkey. A total of 440 non-repeat isolates (196 MSSA and 244 MRSA) from various clinical specimens were included in the study. All isolates were identified as S. aureus by phenotypic characteristics, Gram staining, catalase and tube coagulase tests. MICs of the drugs were determined by an agar dilution method, according to the NCCLS criteria. The drugs were obtained from their manufacturer (Bayer Inc). S. aureus ATCC 29213 was used as quality control strain. Results: Twenty-seven (14%) of 196 MSSA strains and 239 (98%) of 244 MRSA strains were resistant to ciprofloxacin. MIC50 and MIC90 values of 27 ciprofloxacin-resistant MSSA strains for moxifloxacin were 0.25 mg/L and 4 mg/L, respectively. MIC50 and MIC90 values of ciprofloxacin-susceptible MSSA strains for moxifloxacin were \u00a30.125 mg/L and 0.250 mg/L, respectively. Moxifloxacin was 4-fold more active than ciprofloxacin against MSSA strains. There was not any difference between these two quinolones against MRSA strains (MIC90s: \u202116 mg/L). Conclusion: MRSA strains are major causes of nosocomial infections. Despite advances in antibacterial therapy, treatment of infections caused by MRSA is still troublesome. New quinolone-derived compounds such as moxifloxacin are reported to have improved activities against S. aureus including MRSA. In this first study on in-vitro activity of moxifloxacin against S. aureus from Turkey, the moxifloxacin MICs were higher than those reported from different countries",

Conclusions: 1) Levofloxacin MIC50 and MIC90 for pneumococcal strains with decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin were 0.5 and 1 mg/L, respectively. Resistance to levofloxacin (MIC \u2021 8) occurred in 32 isolates (1.2% of the SAUCE-3 collection). 2) Activity of levofloxacin was negatively affected only among pneumococcal isolates with a very high MIC of ciprofloxacin ( \u20218 mg/L). In this case, levofloxacin MIC50 and MIC90 were 4 and 8, respectively, and 44.4% of these strains were resistant to levofloxacin. 3) All sequenced strains with a levofloxacin MIC \u2021 4 mg/L had a mutation in the parC gene (single in 56% strains), but none of them in the gyrB.

While potency of TIG against R subsets of ENT was less (MIC50 and 90, \u00a30.5 and \u00a34 mg/L, respectively), the vast majority of TET-R isolates remained S to TIG (>98% of isolates were inhibited by \u00a34 mg/L). No geographic differences in TIG potency among ESBL-producing, CIP-R or TET-R ENT strains were noted. GRN drug concentrations in serum would be expected to remain above the MPC90 value for >24 hours. Conclusion: GRN exhibits potent activity against SP, as measured by both MIC and MPC, and is active against strains with high MIC/MPC values for other quinolones.

Methods: A total of 105 well-characterized S. aureus strains with decreased susceptibility to VAN (88 hVISA and 17 VISA) as well as 105 oxacillin-resistant wild-type (WT) S. aureus with VAN MIC \u00a3 2 mg / L (MRSA-WT; isolated in 2003) were susceptibility (S) tested by reference NCCLS broth microdilution method against DAP and VAN. MBC values were assessed by plating the entire volume of the broth from each well above the MIC for each organism. The lowest concentration of antimicrobial agent that killed \u2021 99.9% of the initial inoculum was defined as the MBC endpoint. Bactericidal action was defined as a MBC/MIC ratio \u00a3 2 and tolerance was defined as a MBC / MIC ratio \u2021 16. Results: VAN MIC and MBC results for 3 subsets of S. aureus strains are summarized in theTable.Only two-third of the MRSA-WT isolates showed VAN MBC results \u00a3 4 mg / L, and for hVISA and VISA groups, only 19.3 and 0.0% of isolates had a VAN MBC at \u00a3 4 mg / L, respectively. Fourteen (13.3%), 61 (69.3%), and 17 (100.0%) strains respectively showed VAN MBC result \u2021 32 mg / L among the MRSA-WT, hVISA, and VISA groups. In contrast, all MRSA-WT and hVISA strains were inhibited by \u00a3 1 mg / L of DAP, while the VISA strains showed slightly higher DAP MIC values (range, 0.5-4 mg / L). The highest DAP MBC result was only 4 mg/L and 93.3% of isolates showed a DAP MBC at \u00a3 1 mg / L. Eight of 11 DAP MBC results of 2 mg / L and all 3 MBC results of 4 mg / L were observed among the VISA strains. DAP MBC / MIC ratio was not significantly affected by VAN susceptibility. All DAP MBC results were at the MIC or only 2-fold greater. 17.1% of MRSA-WT strains, 69.3% of hVISA and all VISA strains showed a VAN MBC / MIC ratio consistent with tolerance. Conclusions: VAN showed bacteriostatic activity against the majority of VISA and hVISA strains. VAN also had high rates of tolerant MBC/MIC ratios, but DAP was highly bactericidal against MRSA-WT as well as VISA and hVISA strains.",

Reinert (Aachen, D)Background: S. pneumoniae is a serious infectious agents of the respiratory tract and its resistance to new antibiotics is increasing worldwide. In this study, the first telithromycin resistant S. pneumoniae isolate in Germany was characterized. Methods: In a German nationwide study including 16 clinical microbiological laboratories, a total of 206 S. pyogenes (pharyngitis and wound infections) and 485 S. pneumoniae (respiratory tract infections) isolates were colleced between January 2003 and April 2004. MICs of penicillin G (PEN), cefotaxime (CEF), erythromycin A (ERY), clindamycin (CLI), tetracycline (TET), quinupristin-dalfopristin (Q-D), telithromycin (TELI), and levofloxacin (LEV) were determined using the microdilution method according to the latest NCCLS guidelines. Macrolide resistant genotypes were checked by RT-PCR with the LightCycler and macrolide resistant phenotypes and sequencing of L4, L22, ermB and 23S rRNA were performed according to standard methods. Results: Resistance rates of S. pyogenes isolates were as follows (I + R): PEN (0%), ERY (7.0%), CLI (0.5%), TET (7.0%), Q-D (0%) and TELI (1%). S. pneumoniae isolates showed the following resistance rates (I + R): PEN (7.2%), ERY (18.9%), CLI (5.3%), TET (11.3%), and TELI (0.2%). The new ketolide telithromycin was 99.8% active against S. pneumoniae isolates (MIC50 and MIC90 equal 0.016 mg/L and 0.125 mg/L, respectively). The telithromycin resistant pneumococcal strain showed 7 mutations in the 23S rRNA (T107G, A1745T, A1535G, 1513T, T1514A,",

In several nationwide studies on resistance development in pneumococcal disease pneumococcal isolates were collected. Methods: Strains were serotyped using Neufeld's Quellungreaction and MICs of penicillin G (PEN), cefotaxime (CEF), amoxicillen (AMOX), erythromycin A (ERY), clindamycin (CLI), tetracycline (TET), ciprofloxacin (CIP), levofloxacin (LEV), sparfloxacin (SPA), grepafloxacin (GRE), clinafloxacin (CLX), moxifloxacin (MOX), gatifloxacin (GAT) and gemifloxacin (GEM) were determined using the microdilution method according to the latest NCCLS guidelines. Flouroquinolone resistant genotypes were checked by PCR followed by DNA-sequencing of gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE according to standard methods. Results: Between Jan. 1992 and Dec. 2003 10.700 isolates from 315 laboratories were included in this study. A total of 40 fluoroquinolone resistant strains (MIC CIP >2) were identified (0.3-0.8%). The predominant serotypes were 23F (17.5%) and 9N (10%). The moxifloxacin MIC50 of the resistant strains was 0.5 lg/ml. Most mutations leading to fluoroquinolone resistance were found in parC (corresponding amino acid positions:78, 79,  80, 83, 91 and 137), and parE at amino acid positions 460 and 435. Only one strain was found to possess a gyrB mutation. 20 strains (50%) were analysed by MLST. Predominant sequence types were ST81 (10%), ST 9 (10%) and ST 66 (10%). MLST data of the isolates did not show clonal relatedness of quinolone resistance. Conclusions: Fluoroquinolone resistant strains remain rare in Germany. A clonal relatedness of strains could not be affirmed using MLST.",

Falagas (Athens, GR; Boston, USA)Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of teicoplanin compared to second-generation cephalosporins for perioperative anti-infective prophylaxis in orthopedic and vascular surgery involving prosthetic material. Design: Meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) Data sources: Data were obtained from PubMed (1/1950-10/ 2004), Current Contents, Cochrane central register of controlled trials, and references from relevant articles. Study selection: RCTs comparing teicoplanin with second generation cephalosporins in vascular and orthopaedic surgery were included in the study. Data extraction: Two independent reviewers extracted data concerning development of infections at the site of operation or in remote areas, reported adverse effects, and mortality. Results: Six RCTs were included in the analysis. Publication bias and statistically significant heterogeneity was not observed among the analysed studies. There were no differences in the development of infection at the site of operation (OR = 0.95, 95% CI 0.58-1.56) or in remote areas of the body (OR = 0.94, 95% CI 0.73-1.22) between teicoplanin and cephalosporins. In addition, there was no significant difference in reported adverse effects (OR = 0.77, 95% CI 0.50-1.18). Conclusions: Teicoplanin is not more effective than secondgeneration cephalosporins as perioperative anti-infective prophylaxis in orthopedic and vascular operations involving prosthetic material.P1053 Postoperative infection in posterior spinal fusion surgery in children M.

Setting: \u00d4Henry Dunant\u00d5 Hospital, a 450-bed tertiary care centre in Athens, Greece. Main outcome measures: Serum creatinine, blood urea, liver function tests, symptoms and signs of neurotoxicity. Results: We present our experience with the use of 19 courses of prolonged intravenous colistin [mean duration of administration (\u00b1SD) 43.4 (\u00b114.6) days, mean daily dosage (\u00b1SD) 4.4 (\u00b12.1) million IU, mean cumulative dosage (\u00b1SD) 190.4 (\u00b191.0) million IU] in 17 patients. The median creatinine value increased by 0.25 mg/dl during the treatment compared to the baseline (p < 0.001) but returned close to the baseline at the end of treatment (higher by 0.1 mg/dl, p = 0.67). No apnea or other evidence of neuromuscular blockade was noted in any of these patients who received prolonged treatment with colistin. Conclusions: No serious toxicity was observed in patients who received prolonged intravenous colistin.

So in our country as in the other emerging countries and notably African ones it is the soft Chancroid that predominates extensively, whereas one knows that in the developed countries that is the genital herpes which is the most frequent etiology. All the cases of Donovanosis diagnosed in our laboratory come from Tamanrasset city, southern Algeria, border with endemic sub-Saharan African countries for this illness and other tropical infections. The cases of undeterminate etiology can be explained on the one hand by the possible non infectious causes that we did not search for and on the other hand by the insufficiency of our diagnostic means that we intend to improve very shortly with the acquirement in 2005 of the whole technology of the molecular biology.

The digestion of the amplicon with DdeI generated 3 different specific patterns, one for H. pylori, another for H. pullorum and H. cianedi, and the last one for H. fennelliae. The PCR-RFLP scheme failed to differentiate H. cianedi from H. pullorum.Background: Helicobacter pylori causes peptic ulceration and is linked to the development of gastric cancer. Despite this little is known about the nature of transmission of this organism. It is likely that spread occurs in early life but whether this is within families or between peer groups is unclear. Until recently, it was only possible to type the organism from cultures derived from gastric biopsies. This required an endoscopy to be performed meaning that epidemiological studies on children were not possible. We have developed a method to detect H. pylori DNA in faeces and have extended this to perform non-invasive typing using a Line Probe Assay (LIPA). Objectives: To extract and type H. pylori DNA from the faeces of family groups. Methods: Children referred for breath testing were used as the index cases and faecal donations collected from parents and siblings in 7 families. DNA was extracted from faecal samples and analysed using a Line Probe Assay ( LBP H. pylori virulence strips, Labo Biomedical Products, The Netherlands). Results: H. Pylori genotypes were obtained from 17 out of 19 faecal samples analysed. 16 out of 17 were positive for the s1a region of the vacA gene. The m1 m2a region was present in all members of 3 families and 3 other individuals. There was no pattern to the distribution of the cagA gene. Conclusions: This pilot study confirms the potential for LIPA analysis to provide data on the type of H. pylori present in family groups. In the 7 families studied there were no clear patterns that suggested whether transmission occurred from parents or peers and further studies using a larger number of families would be required.",

Six of the 43 isolates were with reduced susceptibility to autolysis which was induced by triton X-100. The 43 MRSA with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin were isolated from 21 patients, 13 of whom had received glycopeptide treatment before the isolation. Five patients died despite vancomycin therapy. No enterococal vancomycin resistance genes were detected among the 43 isolates.

The purpose of this study was to investigate the rates of resistance among staphylococci to this agent in Greece, after a three year period of usage in our hospitals. Methods: A total of 846 staphylococci (250 S. aureus and 596 coagulase-negative staphylococci, CNS) recovered from clinical specimens of different patients in two tertiary care Greek hospitals (University Hospital of Larissa, University Hospital of Patras) during 2003-2004 were investigated for their resistance to quinupristin-dalfopristin (breakpoints for susceptibility < = 1 mg / L, resistance >4 mg / L). Identification at species level was performed by Gram stain, catalase and coagulase production, and by the API Staph system. Susceptibility to various antimicrobial agents including Q-D was assessed by disk the diffusion method. Determination of MIC to Q-D was performed by the E-test and agar dilution method. Isolates with MICs greater than 1 mg / L were examined for the presence of vatA, vatB, vatC, vga, vgaB, vgb, vgbB genes by Polymerase Chain Reactions. The clonality of isolates was studied by PFGE of chromosomal SmaI DNA digests. Results: All S. aureus isolates had MICs ranging from 0.19 to 0.75 mg / L (mean value: 0.25 mg / L). Among the CNS, 579 isolates expressed MICs between 0.125-1 mg / L (mean value: 0.33 mg / L), while 17 isolates had MICs that ranged from 1.5 to 4mg / L. All these 17 isolates, including one S. haemolyticus, one S.capitis, and fifteen S. epidermidis were vga-positives and expressed MLSB phenotype carrying the ermC-gene.Conclusions:The presence of vga-gene, conferring resistance to streptogramin A by a putative efflux mechanism is responsible for the non-susceptibility of staphylococci to quinupristindalfopristin in Greece.A.

Balmelli, R. Hysenai, G. Senn, M. Spiess Pangrazzi, E. Schmid, M. Turina, C. Ruef (Zurich, CH)Objective: Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) are frequently isolated in sternal wound infections (SWI) after open heart surgery. Our study had two principal aims. First, to establish the source and route of transmission of staphylococci found in SWI and sternal wound colonization during interventions under laminar flow ventilation (LVF). Second, to assess the source of strains found in the ultra clean area (UCA) and to define the role of airborne transmission. Methods: Prospective evaluation of 50 patients undergoing elective open heart surgery. Swabs of noses and hands of HCW involved in patient care. Swabs of noses and sternal skin of patients before interventions. Three air samples done during each intervention in the vicinity of the surgical site. Genotyping of all 2413 cultured isolates of CoNS using pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Results: Two out of 50 patients developed SWI, one infection was caused by CoNS and needed surgical revision, the second was caused by coryneform bacteria. PFGE showed that the CoNS originated from the hands of a supporting staff member (SSM) who shaved the patient just before intervention. Another CoNS strain was found in the same wound during revision, and was traced to another SSM who took care of the patient just before reintervention. Five out 50 patients had intraoperative sternal wound colonization with CoNS. None of these CoNS genotypes were observed among isolates from patients, HCW or from the air.

Gundogdu, M.A. Tasyaran (Erzurum, TR)Objective: Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever is being epidemic in recent years in Turkey. We assessed the clinical features, risk and prognostic factors of this disease, and efficacy of ribavirin therapy. Methods: From 2002 to 2004, 60 cases (26 confirmed and 34 suscepted) admitted to our hospital were included in this study. The diagnosis was confirmed with ELISA and/or RT-PCR. Results: Age, farming, handled livestock, to be housewive, living in rural area, bitten by tick, removing tick from animal and living in north part of our city (Erzurum) were determined as the risk factors for the CCHF in our region. Fever during hospitalization, confusion, bleeding from multiple sites, presence of petechia or ecchymosis, very high levels of ALT, AST, LHD and CK, long PTT, high INR and urea level, and severe thrombocytopenia were poor prognostic factors. The clinical outcome was better in ribavirin group, and white blood cell (WBC), PLT, ALT-AST returned to normal levels in a short period in cases with treated ribavirin (p = 0.001, 0.006, and 0.031 respectively). The need of blood and blood product was not different between both groups. But, number of patients with bleeding more in ribavirin group (63% vs. 36%, and p = 0.04). Mean hospitalization duration was not different (7.7 days in ribavirin groups vs 10.3 days in the control group). Fatality rates were 9% (2/22) in ribavirin group vs 10.5% (4/38) in the control (p = 0.85). Of ribavirin group, diagnosis and therapy were late in first case who died, and absorbsion of the oral drug did not possible due to massive hematemesis and melana in second case. The hospital expenditure was not different in both groups.Conclusion: In Estern part of Turkey the risk and prognostic factors of the disease were similar in other outbreaks of CCHF. Ribavirin decrease recovery duration of the disease, but not hospitalization time and expenditure. Further studies need for evaluation of ribavirin therapy respect to need of blood or product and mortality in CCHF. Demographic, epidemiological and clinical data analysis of 81 confirmed cases of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever in Iran M. Mardani, MA. Keshtkar Jahromi, K. Holakouie Naieni, B. Haghighat (Tehran, IR)Objectives: In order to report epidemiological, demographic and clinical features of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) cases in Iran, we evaluated 81 confirmed cases that were reported to the ministry of health since June 1999 up to September 2001. Methods: Confirmed cases were defined as those who had signs and symptoms compatible with those of CCHF cases in association with serological test results that were positive for IgM and/or IgG by ELISA. Confirmed cases were evaluated for sex, age, occupation {at risk (physician, butcher or nurse) and low risk (teacher and household worker)}, place of residence, animal contact, human contact, clinical findings and laboratory data such as fever, hemorrhage and thrombocytopenia. Results: 72% (59 cases) were male. 51% (42 cases) were 33 year old or older. 48% (39 cases) were reported from only one province in the south of Iran (Sistan VA Balouchestan). 79% (64 cases) had history of animal contacted, but only 16% (13 cases) had history of contact with a human case of CCHF. 98% (80 cases) were febrile. 98% (80 cases) had hemorrhagic manifestations and 98% (80 cases) were thrombocytopenic. Conclusion: Most CCHF cases in Iran were male, 33 year old or older, with low risk occupation, had history of animal contact and from a major province that borders upon Afghanistan and Pakistan which are endemic for CCHF. Nearly all of the cases were febrile, had hemorrhage and were thrombocytopenic. It seems that importing infected animals from countries endemic for CCHF may be a major risk factor for acquiring the disease in our country. We conclude that in endemic areas, febrile illnesses with hemorrhagic manifestations and thrombocytopenia should be evaluated for CCHF.

Statistical significance was set as <0.05 in both K-W and M-K tests. Results: The monthly mean temperature and the monthly minimum temperatures over 70 years in Sivas increased homogenously with a significant increasing trend (p < 0.05). Within a smaller period, from 1990 to 2003, the daily mean temperature in April, increased significantly in these provinces. The number of days with the temperature of >5\u00b0C increased homogenously in January, February, March, and April in Sivas, and the trend was significant for April. A significant increase in yearly rainfall was detected in Tokat. Conclusion: Recent climatic changes will inevitably coincide with any recent epidemiological phenomena, but this does not necessarily indicate causality. A significant increasing trend of temperature was detected in only one (Sivas), and rainfall in another (Tokat), of the three provinces where a CCHF epidemic occurred in 2002-2004. At the same time, changes in biotic environmental factors, of the sort that could be beneficial for survival of large numbers of hyalommas, have also occurred. Epidemiological measures of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever infection in Sistan va Baluchestan province, Iran K. Holakouie Naieni, S. Izadi, S. Chinikar, A. Nadim (Tehran, Zahedan, IR)Objectives: Since 1999, many cases of Crimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever have been reported from different parts of Iran. This study intends to define CCHF seroprevalence, incidence rates, and the most important risk in Sistan va Baluchestan province, Iran. Methods: Using cluster sampling with probability proportional to size, 310 subjects were selected from various Zahedan and Zabol districts in the northern part of the province. Blood samples were drawn from consenting subjects, once at the beginning of the study and then 6 months later. A total of 18 out of 285 subjects who consented to give blood samples were actually positive on IgM and IgG capture ELISA tests. Results: The calculated seroprevalence was 6.32% (95% CI: 3.24% to 9.40%). Of the subjects who were sampled for the second time (226 persons), only one had experienced seroconversion. The calculated incidence rate was 0.48 (95% CI: 0.00% to 1.44%). 14 out of the 18 subjects with definitely positive IgG or IgM were females. In multivariate analysis, age, education, and history of slaughtering livestock were significantly related to the risk of infection. History of travel to the rural areas was inversely related to the risk of infection. Only one of the seropositive subjects had a history of tick bite. Conclusion: This study shows the importance of subclinical infections in the epidemiology of this disease in Iran. It also seems that the risk of infection for housewives is high. Regardless of the high female to male ratio of seropositive subjects, it appears that the epidemiologic characteristics of the infection in this region are not so different compared to other parts of the world.This investigation received financial support from the WHO's Eastern Mediterranean Regional Office(EMRO), Division of communicable Diseases (DCD) and the WHO Special Programme for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR): The EMRO DCD/TDR Small Grants Scheme for Operational Research in Tropical and Other Communicable Diseases.

Methods: Microbiology database was scanned and fungal isolates associated with keratitis (186) and endophthalmitis(97)were analysed for classification and isolate frequency. The Sensititre YeastOne microdilution antifungal susceptibility test was used to evaluate susceptibility (MICs) of 34 common fungal pathogens against viriconazole, amphotericin , fluconazole. Results: Fusarium species remains the most frequent corneal fungal pathogen (57.2%). Colletotrichum species (5.4%) has emerged as the fifth most common mold in keratitis. Top yeast isolates from cornea included Candida albicans (58.6%) and Candida parapsilosis (36.8%). Half of the intraocular pathogens were Candida species. Paecilomyces (3.1%) and Philophora (2.8%) were unusual pathogens. In vitro susceptibility profiles were voriconazole (100%), amphotericin (71.4%), fluconazole (57,8%). Voriconazole MIC(90) were lowest for Candida species (0.014 microg/ml) and highest for Fusarium species (1.5 lg/ml). Reference laboratory MICs correlated 100% for yeast isolates (0.016 lg/ml) but were fourfold higher for Fusarium species (7 lg/ml). MIC(90) for Aspergillus species was 0.4 lg/ml. Conclusions: Candida, Fusarium, and Aspergillus species remain frequent fungal pathogens. Voriconazole may have a role in the therapeutic management of Candida and Aspergillus ocular infections.

Hoosen (Pretoria, ZA)Crytococosis is a leading mycological cause of morbidity and mortality among HIV/AIDS patients especially in developing countries where anti-retroviral therapy is not easily available. In this study clinical isolates of Cryptococcus neoformans obtained from blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cultures from patients admitted for meningitis were tested for their in-vitro susceptibility to 3 antifungal agents.A total of 50 clinical isolates obtained from AIDS patients admitted to the George Mukhari Hospital, Pretoria with a diagnosis of meningitis were available for analysis. Antifungal analysis were done by microbroth dilution (M27-A) for amphotericin B and fluconazole. The E test and the disc diffusion tests were performed for voriconazole and fluconazole. All isolates tested were fully susceptible to amphotericin B and voriconazole. For fluconazole, two isolates were resistant by the E test and microbroth dilution method. This has implications for maintenance therapy for the patients who are HIV positive and have cryptococcal meningitis. Voriconazole may be an appropriate alternative in this group of patients. The availability of anti-retroviral therapy may also be beneficial to this subset of patients. Susceptibility to azoles of Cryptococcus neoformans: pre-HAART and HAART erasR. Claro, A.I. Aller, F.

Methods: 76 C. neoformans isolates from HIV patients were studied. 29 of them were obtained from patients without HAART from 1994 to 1996; the other 47 were obtained from patients with HAART from 1997 to 2003. The susceptibility to fluconazole, voriconazole and itraconazole of the first group and the susceptibility to fluconazole and voriconazole of the second one were performed by the broth microdilution method according to the NCCLS guidelines (M27-A2 document). Fluconazole and voriconazole were provided by Pfizer and itraconazole by Janssen. Fluconazole was dissolved in sterile distilled water, whilst voriconazole and itraconazole were dissolved in dimethylsulphoxide. RPMI medium (Sigma) was used for all drugs. Inocula were adjusted to a cell density of 1 McFarland, and microtiter plates were incubated for 72 h at 35\u00b0C with agitation (Ghannoum et al. \u00d4Susceptibility testing of Cryptococcus neoformans: a microdilution technique\u00d5. 1992.

Methods: A total number of 219 Candida spp.(183 C.albicans, 12 C. glabrata, 11 C. krusei, 10 C. tropicalis, 3 C. parapsilosis) isolated from different clinical specimens were included in this study. We determined minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of both antifungal agents by following the NCCLS M27 A-2 broth microdilution method. Endpoints were defined as the lowest concentration of drug resulting in prominent inhibition (MIC80) and total inhibition (MIC100) of visual growth compared with the growth in the control wells containing no antifungal.Conclusion: These data suggest that both antifungal agents shows a good in vitro activity against Candida spp. except Candida parapsilosis.The value of these in vitro results as predictors of therapeutic outcome is to be established in clinical trials. Synergism of micafungin with voriconazole against clinical Aspergillus, Fusarium and Scedosporium spp.K. Heyn, A. Tredup, S. Salvenmoser, F.-M. M\u00fc ller (Heidelberg, D)Objectives: The combination of Micafungin (MCF) and Voriconazole (VRC) against 100 clinical isolates of Aspergillus fumigatus, flavus, niger and nidulans, Fusarium solani as well as Scedosporium apiospermum and prolificans was analysed by in vitro checkerboard analysis. As the drugs have a different mode of action, it can be expected that their combination may be synergistic. Methods: The interactions have been evaluated by in vitro checkerboard analysis with determination of FIC indices. The spectrophotometric reading has been performed by 50% growth inhibition (MIC-2) using XTT colorimetric method. The in vitro drug interactions were calculated on the basis of fractional inhibitory concentrations (FIC) index. Results: Synergism, was observed for 64% of all tested isolates. 80% of A. fumigatus strains showed synergism. Also for S. prolificans, a pathogen with enhancing frequency of occurrence, which causes various types of human infections with high mortality rates, 75% synergistic effects were found. When synergy was not achieved (36% of the isolates), there was still a decrease in the MIC-2 of one or both drugs used in the combination (indifference 0.5 > FIC index < 4). One the basis of the single drug MIC-2s (VRC 0.35lg/ml, MCF 44.66 lg/ml) for all filamentous fungi we observed that in combination just 32% of VRC (0.11 lg/ml) and 7% of MCF (3.04 lg/ml) is sufficiently to reach the same inhibition. Taking into account the values for the FIC indices, the majority of all indifferent FIC indices were close to the cut-off from synergism to indifference. To clarify this effect, for example F. solani, the FIC index averages 0.5005. None of the isolates yielded antagonistic effects (FIC index > 4). We also investigated significant reductions in the MIC50 and MIC90 values. For VRC the MIC50 and MIC90 of all filamentous fungi reduced from 0.125 and 0.5 lg/ml to 0.03125 and 0.25 lg/ ml and for MCF from 2 and 256 lg/ml to 0.0625 and 8 lg/ml, respectively. Conclusion: Combination of VRC and MCF demonstrated synergism in the majority of the strains. This study demonstrates that the in vitro activity of both drugs can be enhanced by using them in combination. Their relative lack of toxicity also makes them an attractive option as add-on therapy. Clinical trials to investigate the effectiveness of MCF combined with VRC are warranted. Effect of media composition and in vitro activity of new antifungal agents against zygomycetes C.

Simitsopoulou, M. Dalakiouridou, T. Konstantinou, T.J. Walsh, E. Roilides (Thessaloniki, GR; Bethesda, USA)Objective: Innate immune response is critical in the antifungal host defense against invasive aspergillosis and fusariosis, and neutrophils (PMNs) constitute an important component of it.We studied the effects of deoxycholate amphotericin B (DAMB) and its lipid formulations liposomal amphotericin B (LAMB), lipidcomplex (ABLC) and colloidal-dispersion (ABCD) on antifungal activity of human PMNs against hyphae of Aspergillus fumigatus and Fusarium solani. Methods: PMNs were isolated from healthy donors by dextran sedimentation/Ficoll centrifugation. They were incubated with no drugs, 1 or 5 mg/L DAMB and 5 or 25 mg/L LAMB, ABLC and ABCD at 37\u00b0C/5% CO 2 for 2h. Hyphae of A. fumigatus and F. solani germinated after incubation of conidial suspensions in YNB for 17 h at 32\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C respectively, were added at an effector:target (E:T) ratio 5:1 or 10:1. After 2 h, PMN-induced hyphal damage was assessed using the XTT colorimetric assay at 450 nm. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA with Dunnett test for multiple comparisons. Results: They are summarized in the table (*p < 0.05, **p < 0.01). No decrease of PMN viability was induced by the drugs at the concentrations used. All amphotericin B formulations at both concentrations resulted in significant increases of PMN-induced damage of A. fumigatus hyphae at 5:1 and 10:1 E:T ratios as compared to untreated PMNs (p < 0.01). Similar increases were induced by all mg/L and 5:1 ratio where a tendency of increase was shown. DAMB 5 mg/L exerted the highest increase in PMN-induced hyphal damage against both fungi (p < 0.01). Conclusion: Both deoxycholate and lipid amphotericin B formulations enhance the damage induced by human PMNs on hyphae of A. fumigatus and F. solani. DAMB appears to show the highest enhancement among them. These immunomodulatory effects of amphotericin B formulations on PMN antifungal activities against the two filamentous fungi may be important in the antifungal therapy of invasive aspergillosis and fusariosis in immunocompromised patients.J.

Most cases of fungal peritonitis due to yeasts are caused by Candida species, although other yeasts have occasionally been reported. Objectives: To study the evolution of peritonitis due to yeasts, its distribution by species and its antifungal susceptibility in our hospital over the last 17 years. Methods: Retrospective study for the period January 1988 to October 2004 of all the episodes of yeast peritonitis diagnosed in our microbiology lab. The in vitro activities of amphotericin B (AB), fluconazole (FZ), itraconazole (IZ), ketoconazole (KZ), voriconazole (VZ), and flucytosine (FC) were determined by the broth microdilution method following NCCLS criteria.Results: A total of 510 peritoneal fluids, from 349 patients, showed positive yeast growth (560 isolates). The peritonitis rates per 100.000 patient admissions during the two periods of study were respectively:32.8 (1988-1995)  and 50.6 (1996-2004) (p < 0.005). Globally, Candida albicans was the most frequently isolated yeast (313. 55.9%) followed by C. glabrata (78; 13.9%), C. parapsilosis (63; 11.3%), C. tropicalis (44. 7.9%), C. krusei (19. 3.4%) and others (43. 7.7%). The species distribution in both the adult and paediatric population was respectively as follows: C. albicans (59.2% / 39.1%), C. glabrata (16.5% / 1.1%), C. tropicalis (7.1% / 12%), C. parapsilosis (5.1% / 42.4%), C. krusei (4.1% / 0%) and others (8.1% / 5.4%). C. parapsilosis was the specie most frequently isolated from paediatric patients (42.4%), whereas C. albicans was the most isolated in adult patients (59.2%). Number of isolates tested, and MIC90 of AB, FZ, IZ, KZ, VZ and FC (mcg/mL) were as follows: 102 C. In our hospital, peritonitis due to yeasts increased significantly during the study period.

All strains were recovered during a period of five years(2000)(2001)(2002)(2003)(2004) from 38 Spanish hospitals. Each clinical isolate represented an unique isolate from a patient. Clinical isolates were identified by routine procedures. A broth microdilution test was performed by following the NCCLS reference method, document M-38A. Antifungal drug tested were amphotericin B (AMB), itraconazole (ITC), voriconazole (VRC), posaconazole (POS) and terbinafine (TBF). Aspergillus flavus ATCC 204304 and Aspergillus fumigatus ATCC 204305 were used as reference strains for susceptibility testing.

Rohm-Rodowald (Warsaw, PL)Objectives: The hospital infection control including prevention and killing of environmental pathogenic microorganisms with the application of properly designed disinfecting procedures and adequate chemical disinfectants, belongs to basic duties of hospital management. In this study the sensitivity of yeasts and dermatophytes to disinfectants was determined. Two agents were assayed through out the study as following: I (99% sodium dichloroisocyanurate: 1.5 g active chlorine in tablet); II (9.5 % glutaraldehyde, 7.5% glyoxal, 9.6 % didecylodimethylammonium chloride). Seventeen clinical strains of Candida albicans and Epidermophyton floccosum, Microsporum canis, Trichophyton rubrum, Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Scopulariopsis spp. were used. Methods: Phase I -qualitative suspension test method (National Institute of Hygiene, Poland) was used. Antifungal activity on C. albicans and dermatophytes was evaluated by determination of the MIC. Observation of the inhibition or destruction of invasive form development and spores were studied with the use of phase -contrast microscopic techniques. Phase II -carrier test methods: qualitative (NIH) and quantitative European Standard EN 13697 were applied. Results: MIC values assessed in this study were independent of places where the disinfectants were applied. Noticeable inhibition of the growth of dermatophytes was observed with MIC values ranging (mg/l): I-100 to 120; II -0.012 to 0.02. In case of C. albicans MIC values ranging (mg/l): I-140 to 160; II-0.0005 to 0.012 were obtained. The comparison of fungal suspension treated with chemical agents and control suspension at direct microscopic count showed significant reduction of the amount of cells. The investigation of the second phase showed the activity of disinfectants: I (1000 mg/l, 15 min) and II (1% and 2%, 15 min) to fungal pathogens. Disinfectants in used parameters showed activity to fungi in the place of application. Conclusion: Those studies revealed that investigated strains showed different susceptibility to disinfectants. Strains of Candida albicans demonstrated significantly higher resistance to chlorine compounds than dermatophytes but more sensitivity to aldehydes. Using proper disinfectant in clinical environment is an essential tool in eradication of fungal infection.Skin and soft tissue infectionsP1164Bacteriologic efficacy of meropenem versus imipenem-cilastatin for the treatment of patients with complicated skin and skin structure infections clinical isolates by emm amplicon characterisation and PFGE analysis, as well as the determination of the prevalent emm types among the strains originated from different infections. Methods: From 2003 to 2004 40 S. pyogenes strains were isolated from two Hungarian counties. Out of the isolates, 15 originated from respiratory, 17 from superficial pyogen, and 8 from invasive infections, like Streptococcal shock syndrome (STSS), meningitis and sepsis. emm gene detection and restriction analysis of the emm amplicon (with HincII and HaeIII; DdeI enzymes) was performed in all strains.The sequence of the emm amplicon from all invasive isolates and from one strain of all RFLP groups was determined, and macrorestriction chromosomal analysis by PFGE (Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis) method for these isolates was also performed. Results: As a result of the restriction analysis of the emm amplicons 17 restriction patterns were differentiated. ) was identified. Moreover, two GAS strains had a type (stg6 and stg485) previously found in group G streptococci. The emm types varied among the isolates originated from different sources. The next emm types were identified among the invasive isolates: emm 1.0, emm 28.0, emm 66.0, emm 80.0, emm 81.1, emm84.0, stg6. Some emm type could be further differentiated into several PFGE genotypes, and within a PFGE genotype different emm types could be observed. Conclusions: This report provides epidemiological information from a geographic area has not been examined by emm characterisation. PFGE and emm type analysis showed high genetic diversity among the 40 GAS strains. The most frequent emm types were emm1.0, emm28.0, emm 81.1 and emm84.0 in the two counties.

Dierich, W. Witte (Innsbruck, A; Ulaanbaatar, MNG; Wernigerode, D)Objectives: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has become one of the most prevalent nosocomial pathogen throughout the world, capable of causing a wide range of hospital infections. This study was aimed to characterize the Mongolian MRSA by antibiotic susceptibility patterns and molecular genotyping. Methods: Strains of S. aureus were collected from various sites of patients from four different medium-sized university hospitals of Ulaanbaatar city (Mongolia), in 2000-2002. The study included two hundred seven strains of S. aureus. Susceptibility testing was performed by disk diffusion according to National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards guidelines. All strains were screened by polymerase chain reaction for the presence of the mecA gene. Molecular genotyping was performed using automated ribotyping with EcoRI as restriction enzyme and PFGE with SmaI as restriction enzyme. Results: Among the 207 S. aureus 6 isolates (2.9%) were positive for the mecA gene by PCR. All of the 6 MRSA strains were resistant to oxacillin, susceptible to amikacin, vancomycin, teicoplanin, fucidic acid and rifampicin. Only one isolate was intermediate-resistant to gentamicin, tobramycin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Three of the 6 MRSA strains were intermediate resistant to ciprofloxacin. Five of the 6 isolates were resistant to erythromycin and all were resistant to tetracycline and chloramphenicol. Three of the 6 MRSA isolates were of MLST St 154, possessed a SCC-mec element of type IV c and the determinant for Panton-Valentine Leukocidin (lukS-lukF). The remaining 3 MRSA isolates exhibited MLST ST 239, contained a SCC-mec element of type III and were lukS-lukF negative. Automated ribotyping as well as PFGE divided the 6 MRSA strains into 4 different types, three strains showed unique patterns using both typing methods.Conclusion: The limited use of antibiotics in Mongolia is assumed to be the reason for the low rate of MRSA found in Mongolian hospitals and for their susceptibility against most antibiotics. Molecular typing indicates that on one hand \u00d4old\u00d5MRSA (ST 239) are still prevailing in Mongolia and that a cMRSA until now described for Sweden had been spread to Mongolia (ST 154). First report of Staphylococcus aureus with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin (VISA) in Denmark A. Sandberg, A. Bolmstr\u00f6 m, R. Skov (Copenhagen, DK; Solna, S) Objective: Are VISA / hVISA isolates present among MRSA isolates in Denmark?Methods: All MRSA isolates in Denmark are referred to the Staphylococcus reference laboratory at Statens Serum Institute. From January 1st 2003 to October 31st 2004 a total of 576 isolates were screened by the Etest macromethod for VISA/hVISA. i.e. each isolate was plated on Brain Heart Infusion agar (BHI, Difco) using a McFarland 2.0 inoculum, vancomycin (VA) and teicoplanin (TP), Etest was applied and the isolates were incubated for 48 h in ambient air(Walsh et al, JCM, 2001). VA and TP MIC > 6 mg/L or TP MIC > 8 mg/L was used as the screen interpretive criteria for hVISA/VISA phenotype. Screen positive isolates were verified by population analysis profiles (PAP) using BHI with 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 2.5, 4, 8 and 16 mg/L VA. These isolates were also MIC tested by the standard Etest method, and NCCLS broth microdilution (BMD). Agar screen with 4 and 6 mg/L VA and betalactam+VA antagonism for ampicillin, cefoxitin, cefaclor, cefo-taxime, ceftazidime and imipenem using Etest on BHI plate \u00b1 VA 2 mg/L was also done. Presence of the vanA and vanB gene was investigated by PCR. Results: 15 potential hVISA/VISA isolates were found by the Etest macro-method. Four isolates had hVISA and one had VISA phenotype by PAP and none of them were positive for the vanA and vanB gene. The betalactam+VA antagonism test was positive for all four isolates. Agar screen, BMD and standard Etest did not reliably detect the hVISA isolates. Four patients acquired the isolates outside Denmark and it appears that cross infection occurred in Denmark in the fifth case. Conclusion: This is the first report of VISA and hVISA isolates in Scandinavia. Standard MIC methods including the NCCLS reference do not reliably detect these isolates and specialised VISA/hVISA phenotypic tests are necessary. Etest macromethod was easy to perform and efficiently detected the VISA/ hVISA strains. In one hVISA case, there is evidence for cross infection in Denmark.P1169 Actinomyces spp.: a disregarded pathogen? S. Palombarani, M. Almuzara, K. Bombicino, H. Rodriguez, E. Bertona, A.

Methods: Descriptive retrospective study performed from informatics data obtained in the Microbiology Department of Hospital de la Princesa during January 2000 to December 2003. Culture, isolation, identification and susceptibility were performed following standard recommendations. Results: The total number of wounds during this period was 3753. From these, 1981 were obtained from in-patients, being positives 1510 (76.22%) resulting a total of 2154 microorganisms. Polimicrobian infection was detected in 543 samples. The specimens of out-patients were 1772, being positives 1328 (74.9%) resulting a total of 1762 microorganisms. In 470 samples more than one microorganisms were detected. Frequency of isolation from in-patient and out-patient were as follows: Staphylococcus aureus (18.1% and 27%), Escherichia coli (13.13% and 7.71%) and Pseudomonas sp. (8.45% and 10%) respectively (p < 0.05). Less frequent microorganisms isolated were Enterococcus faecalis (7.28% and 2.78%), Streptococcus sp. (3.94% and 7.38%), fungi (2.36% and 1.3%) and anaerobes (1.3% and 0.79%) from in-patients and out-patients, respectively.Conclusions: Positive rates of wounds cultures were similar in both groups.-Staphylococcus aureus was the most prevalent microorganism, being most frequent in out-patients. -Among enterobacteria Escherichia coli was the most frequent, followed by Proteus mirabilis.

As resistance (R) to commonly used drug classes continues to increase, the newer generation fluoroquinolones (FQs) have provided an excellent therapeutic alternative for community-acquired respiratory tract infections (CARTI). The potency of gemifloxacin(GEMI) against H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis isolates was determined over a period of six years. Methods: A total of 12,152 isolates of H. influenzae (9,411), M. catarrhalis (2,741) and other Haemophilus spp. (66; not presented) were collected during 1999-2004 from North America, Latin America and Europe. Reference NCCLS test methods were utilized and MIC results were interpreted by current breakpoint criteria M100-S15 (2005). Comparison agents included: ciprofloxacin (CIPRO), levofloxacin (LEVO), gatifloxacin (GATI), and moxifloxacin (MOXI). Results: H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis susceptibilities (S) to GEMI have not changed over the last six years. GEMI had equal or greater potency when compared to other FQs. H. influenzae isolates tested showed >99.9% S to GEMI (MIC90 from on-scale values, 0.004 mg/L).

For MPC testing \u20211 billion organisms were applied to agar plates containing 2 fold concentration increments of TL and incubated at 35-37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 and screened for growth at 24 and 48 hours. The lowest drug concentration preventing growth was recorded as either the MIC or MPC depending on the assay. Results: To date, 372 clinical SP isolates were tested by MIC and 245 by MPC. By MIC testing the MIC50/90 and range values were 0.008/0.063 lg/ml and 0.002-1 lg/ml respectively. The modal MIC value was 0.08 lg/ml and 88% of strains were inhibited by \u00a30.016 lg/ml.

Methods: 8 Staphylococcus aureus strains with MICs ranging from 0.03-8 mg/L were exposed to fluctuating concentrations of Levo-(LFX) Gati-(GFX) and Moxifloxacin (MFX) mimicking their total serum concentration profiles following oral doses of 400 mg MFX, 400 mg GFX, 500 and 750 mg LFX over 24 h using the sedimentation model. Strains were cultivated in Brain Heart infusion broth at 37\u00b0C. Viable counts were quantitated at 14 sampling points. As PD-measure the AUBKCnorm (i.e. Area Under the Bacterial Kill Curve normalized to the initial inoculum [h] ; AUBKCnorm <24 indicates a bactericidal activity, >24 bacterial growth) was determined for the time kill experiment and plotted as a function of MIC for each treatment. Results: The AUBKCnorm vs MIC function was similar for all treatments following a bimodal profile. While the slope of all FQs studied was shallow for MICs below 1 mg/L with AU-BKCnorm <5 h, AUBKCnorm started increasing steeply beyond this point. It intercepted the 24 cut off line at concentrations of 1.5 mg/L for LFX 500 mg, 2 mg/L for GFX, 2.4 mg/L for MFX and 3.1 mg/L for LFX 750 mg. This indicates that S. aureus with susceptibilites beyond these MICs would no longer be eradicated by the corresponding treatments. Thus, according to our investigations a breakpoint for FQs integrating both microbiological and clinical pharmacokinetic relation-ships results in a value of 1 mg/L for LFX 500 mg, and 2 mg/L for MFX, GFX, and LFX 750 mg. Conclusion: Pharmacodynamic breakpoints determined by PK/PD M+S which are taking into respect the fluctuating concentration time profiles encountered in patients are suitable surrogates complementing the data obtained in microbiological experiments.",

Methods: Seventy clinical isolates of the B. fragilis group identified by only a sequential number were distributed to each of the five participating laboratories. Four of the laboratories performed AD and one laboratory performed BMD susceptibility testing using NCCLS recommendations including breakpoints where appropriate.

            "text": "Global evaluation of gemifloxacin activity tested against community-acquired respiratory tract pathogens, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) Fluoroquinolones are a therapeutic option in treatment of infections caused by non-fermentative Gram-negative bacteria.However, resistance to these antibiotics rapidly increase in clinical isolates. The efflux mechanism is the most common cause of multidrug resistance of strains P. aeruginosa, A. baumanii and S. maltophilia. These MDR pumps belonging to the RND family are inhibited by Phe-Arg-beta-naphthylamide [MC207, 110] . However, different results of reserpine effect on the activity of RND pumps was established. In our study, we searched for effect of the efflux pump inhibitors (MC207,110, reserpine and rescinnamine) on the MIC of quinolones for MDR clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa, A. baumanii and S. maltophilia. We looked for a interdependence between structure of quinolones and ability of tested inhibitors to inhibit efflux of these antibiotics. Results: The MDR strains were resistant to all tested quinolones (nalidixic acid-NAL, pipemidic acid-KP, norfloxacin-NOR, ciprofloxacin-CIP and ofloxacin-OF). Among studied inhibitors only MC207,110 affected the susceptibility of all tested strains to quinolones, first of all to NAL. Effect of MC207,110 on the MIC depended on its concentration, but did not depend on the temperature. For majority of P. aeruginosa and A. baumanii strains the MIC of all quinolones decreased in the presence of MC207,110. The highest decrease of the MIC of quinolones was obtained for P. aeruginosa (4-512-fold). For A. baumanii strains the MIC of KP, NOR, CIP and OF decreased only from 2-to 4-fold but the MIC of NAL decreased to 16-fold. Moreover, the presence of this inhibitor increased the sensitivity of 80% of S. maltophilia only to NAL (4-to 16-fold). Reserpine and rescinnamine did not effect on the MIC of quinolones for all studied MDR strains. However, reserpine alkaloides showed inhibitors activity against control strains of S. aureus (decrease MIC of NOR). Conclusions: Our data confirm that MC207,110 inhibited efflux pumps not only in P. aeruginosa but also in A. baumanii and S. maltophilia strains. Additionally, obtained results suggested possibility that for quinolones, depending on their structure, are different binding sites in efflux pumps. Furthermore, probably also MC207,110 binds to specific site of pumps depending on the efflux systems. So, the effect of this inhibitor on MIC of quinolones depends on genus of bacteria, kind of pumps and structure of agents.",

Linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin exert their mechanism of action by protein synthesis inhibition and are agents with activity against multidrug resistant gram-positive cocci. This study was aimed to determine, by time-kill curves, the activity of linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin against five VGS expressing various degrees of resistance to erythromycin and harbouring different erythromycin resistance determinants Methods: The species, erythromycin MICs (mg/l) and the erythromycin resistance genes present for each of the five isolates tested were: S. anginosus/0.06/none, S. sanguis/4/mef(A), S. sanguis/64/erm(B), S. mitis/256/erm(B) +mef(A), S. anginosus/256/erm(B) +mef(A). Quinupristin-dalfopristin and linezolid MICs for all strains were 1 and 0.5 mg/l respectively. Strains were incubated in cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth supplemented with 5% lysed horse blood. Each of the five isolates were exposed to linezolid and quinupristin-dalfopristin for 24 hours in a shacking water bath in presence of 2 \u00b7 MIC. Colony counts were performed at 0, 4, 8 and 24 hours. Results: Time-kill studies showed that for linezolid, the antibiotic concentration of 2 \u00b7 MIC was bacteriostatic for each strain irrespectively of the resistance to erythromycin and the genes harboured, showing a 90% of killing at 24 h. The in vitro activity of quinupristin-dalfopristin was predominantly bactericidal with a 99.9% of killing at 3 h. The exception were the 2 strains with erm(B) + mef(A) determinants, in one of them, a S. milleri, the bactericidal activity was delayed to 24 h, and in the other strain, a S. mitis, the activity was bactericidal at 3 h but with regrowth at 24 h. Conclusions: When VGS are implicated in infections in neutropenic patients and in cases of endocarditis where bactericidal activity is usually considered mandatory, we have to considered that: linezolid was bacteriostatic, at the concentration tested, against all strains and the rapid killing of quinupristin-dalfopristin against VGS was lost when the strain presented the erm(B) and mef(A) genes together.",
