            "text": "Background: It is increasingly recognized that human rhinoviruses (HRV) can be associated with severe infections. However, conflicting results have been reported on the relative prevalence and severity of the three HRV species. Objectives: The relative prevalence and clinical characteristics of HRV-A, B and C, in children attending a South London teaching hospital were investigated retrospectively. Study design: Children aged <16 years with episodes of respiratory tract infections and detectable entero/rhinovirus RNA in respiratory samples between November 2009 and December 2010 were investigated. Retrospective case review was performed and patients' characteristics recorded. Results: Entero/rhinoviruses were the commonest viral pathogens (498/2316; 21.5%). Amongst 204 infection episodes associated with entero/rhinovirus, 167 were typed HRV, HRV-C was the most prevalent (99/167, 59.3%) followed by HRV-A (60/167; 35.9%) and HRV-B (8/167, 4.8%). The severity spectrum of HRV-A and HRV-C infections were similar and affected all parts of the respiratory tract. Co-pathogens were observed in 54 (26.5%) episodes. Severity was increased in patients with non-viral co-pathogens and those with an underlying respiratory condition. Univariate and multiple regression analyses of potential prognostic variables including age, co-pathogens and underlying respiratory illnesses showed that monoinfection with HRV-C, as compared with other HRV species, was associated with more severe disease in young children <3 years. Conclusions: HRV-C was the most prevalent species and on its own was associated with severe disease in children <3 years. The association between infection with HRV species and clinical presentation is complex and affected by many confounding factors.",

The nucleic acid targets of the multiplex panel consisted of influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenzaviruses 1-4 (PIV), respiratory syncytial viruses A and B (RSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), adenoviruses, coronaviruses, bocavirus and entero/rhinoviruses.

Disease was classified as severe when the respiratory condition warranted admission to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) or High Dependency Unit (HDU), and not severe when admitted to the general paediatric wards. To avoid clinician bias, the case note of each patient was reviewed by the authors retrospectively before the entero/rhinovirus typing results were known. Cases in which the contribution of RTI to disease severity was uncertain were further reviewed and categorized after extensive discussions between the authors. Chronic respiratory diseases, chronic heart conditions, neurological conditions, prematurity, immunosupression and other underlying medical conditions were recorded. Bacterial and fungal organisms detected in respiratory samples by culture or immunofluorescence were considered as co-pathogens if case review concluded that they were significant and not due to colonization. Organisms detected in normally sterile sites, such as blood or cerebrospinal fluid, were considered as significant unless specimen contamination was suspected. Co-infection was defined as the detection of a co-pathogen 7 days before or after the entero/rhinovirus positive sample.",

As this is a hospital-based study, it is likely that only those with a more severe illness are included in the study. It is possible that HRV-B was associated with milder disease and therefore had a lower frequency of detection in hospital-based studies. In support of this theory are several other studies which reported low numbers of HRV-B in hospitalized patients [8, 18, 25, 26] . However, a recent study also found a low prevalence of HRV-B in the community [27] suggesting that the low frequency of HRV-B may be related to biological fitness rather than selection bias. Studies have also shown conflicting results for association of HRV-C or HRV-A with asthma [5, 9, [28] [29] [30] [31] . High titre IgE antibody to dust mite antigen in asthmatic children may increase the risk of acute wheezing provoked by HRV [32] .

            "text": "The proportion of asymptomatic infection in the general population is likely to be important as well. A recent study found a high HRV prevalence in healthy children (37%) who were regularly swabbed [33] . HRV-A accounted for the majority of asymptomatic findings in that study. Our study was a hospital-based study and no asymptomatic healthy children were included. Thus, the finding of this study cannot be extrapolated to RTI in the community without hospitalisation. Due to the retrospective nature of this study, not all residual samples were available for sequencing. This is a limitation and could potentially lead to bias. Nevertheless, up to 50% of all Table 3 Univariate logistic and multiple regression analyses of disease severity and HRV-C mono-infection. the entero/rhinoviruses positive samples during the study period were analyzed which corresponded to >200 episodes of illnesses. No firm conclusion on the relative prevalence of HRV-A and HRV-C can be drawn as it may vary in different geographical location and from season to season. Co-infections with other respiratory viruses have been reported in about 20% of HRV infections. An investigation of respiratory viruses in the West Midlands of the UK found more co-infections with HRV than observed in our study [34] . The presence of copathogens have been linked to lower quality of life in children with asthma [31] and co-infections in children were suggested to have increased associated severity [35] . Our study highlights the importance of the nature of co-pathogens, as co-infection with respiratory viruses or bacteria/fungi were associated with different clinical characteristics. As the presence of co-pathogens was more likely to be actively sought in severe cases, there may be some bias in ascertainment. Nevertheless, it is quite plausible that in these cases, bacteria/fungi were the dominant infection driving the illness.",
