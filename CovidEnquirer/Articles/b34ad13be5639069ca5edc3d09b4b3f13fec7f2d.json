This review is organized around what is intended to be a comprehensive analysis of the distinct fundamental questions that people must answer in the process of making virtually all real-life decisions. Our emphasis was on recent developments as well as identifying important yet neglected topics (e.g., how decision episodes get started-or not, and why some decisions are never implemented). Early as well as current efforts have focused mainly on East Asian and North American Caucasian cultures, with little treatment of other populations. In such studies, individualism and collectivism have been the dominant explanatory factors although related but distinct concepts such as ''tightness\" and ''looseness\" have been welcome additions to recent discussions. Throughout, the review emphasizes practical concerns, such as the challenges of intercultural learning and collaboration.",

They speculate, perhaps naively, that arranged marriage traditions, common in some cultures but not others, had a significant impact on how the other couple chose each other. This scenario illustrates just one of many questions that a specialist in culture and decision making, or even a layperson, is likely to encounter.

By ''culture\" we refer to the myriad ways of living exhibited by a particular group of people, ways that are transmitted from one generation to the next and which distinguish that group from others (cf. Smith, 1997) . Researchers frequently use nationality as a proxy for culture, but other factors such as religion and social class can divide people into distinctly identifiable ''cultures\" as well (Cohen, 2009 ). People who rely on different modes of subsistence can give rise to distinct cultures, too (Talhelm et al., 2014; Uskul, Kitayama, & Nisbett, 2008) , as can people who carved out their migratory path on a frontier as opposed to settling in a pre-developed area (Kitayama, Conway, Pietromonaco, Park, & Plaut, 2010) . While we embrace this broad definition of culture, much of existing work on culture and decision making has focused on North American and East Asian populations to the neglect of others.",

The CIP directs attention to such gaps. Our readers may be interested in a broad variety of questions, most of which we expect are covered by one of the ten cardinal issues.

These dimensions are associated with different conceptualizations of the ''self.\" Individualistic cultures bestow greater autonomy on the ''self\"; each person is understood to be a discrete entity, independent of others, with relatively immutable characteristics and with free agency. Individualistic cultures tend to value personal goal pursuit as opposed to accommodation to others' goals. Uniqueness and self-expression are also generally valued in such cultures. Collectivistic cultures, by contrast, view the ''self\" as part of a whole. Each person is expected to work with his or her ingroup toward goals, to vary one's personal behavior according to social context, and to generally ''fit in\" and pursue group harmony. As reviewed below, these differences have been proposed to underlie much cross-cultural variation in decision-making, such as the decision modes people use, their preferences, negotiation styles, creativity, and more.",

While most cultural differences have been interpreted in light of the individualism/ collectivism framework, many differences could be explained by differences in tightness/looseness instead. The two constructs are somewhat correlated, with collectivistic cultures being tighter than individualistic cultures.

            "text": "It is worth noting that while the above frameworks are often invoked as plausible explanations of cultural differences, many studies do not empirically test such links across a broad range of cultures. (We return to similar issues in ''Future Directions.\") It is also worth noting that while simple cross-cultural comparisons enlightened by these frameworks are abundant, culture has increasingly been understood as a non-fixed, dynamic, and context-dependent phenomenon (Briley, Wyer, & Li, 2014) . Social context activates particular mindsets -say, an independent mindset -and this mindset in turn can influence one's judgments and decisions temporarily (Oyserman, Sorensen, Reber, & Chen, 2009 ). In another situation, an opposing mindset may be adopted such that the same person's judgments and decisions take on an altogether different pattern. This is not to say that culture has no stable component -societies reinforce relatively constant patterns of living and people internalize those ways of living to some degree. Moreover, psychological tendencies associated with different cultures may be due to powerful and relatively stable ecological forces such as climate, population density, disease burden, history of migration, and modes of subsistence (Gelfand et al., 2011; Kitayama, Varnum, & Sevincer, 2014; Talhelm et al., 2014; Uskul et al., 2008) . Evidence from neuroscience also supports the constancy of cultural mindsets to some degree; repeated ways of thinking leave physical effects on the brain (Kitayama & Uskul, 2011) . While it is beyond the scope of this paper to explore the antecedents of every cultural difference in decision making, we propose that cultural differences are both stable and contextdependent. We anticipate that exploration of the origins and nature of cultural differences will continue.",

In a hypothetical stock trading task, Canadians were more likely than Chinese to purchase rising stocks (Ji, Zhang, & Guo, 2008) , indicating that Canadians were more likely to see a rising trend as an opportunity. Chinese participants were more likely than Canadians to purchase falling stocks; thus Chinese were more likely to see falling trends as opportunities. As for selling, Canadians were more willing than Chinese to sell falling stocks, but Chinese were more willing than Canadians to sell rising stocks. These findings have been attributed to cognitive style differences. Recall that one feature of holistic thinking is the expectation of future change.

In independent cultural contexts, there is social approval for meeting goals that promote independent values such as selfexpression, uniqueness, and autonomy or self-reliance (Snibbe & Markus, 2005) . Making decisions individually represents a means of self-expression and exercising independence. In more interdependent contexts, by contrast, there is social approval for including others in the decision process. Interdependent goals promote social harmony and accommodating to others' expectations. By including other people in the decision-making process, an interdependent person can anticipate any disapproval that would result from various options, ultimately arriving at a decision that is informed by others' preferences and therefore likely to be socially accepted.",

Regarding the Russian/American difference in advice giving, Chentsova-Dutton and Vaughn (2012) argue that Russians value advice because they are accustomed to living in a society where official means of information exchange and social aid are unreliable. Thus, in their case, collaboration is not driven by a collectivistic desire to please others but rather by a desire to disseminate helpful information. In contrast to the Russian case, Savani et al. (2011) do not attribute advice giving and accommodation in India to the lack of a reliable informational infrastructure. Rather, they propose that high population density and limited social mobility lead to strong reputational concerns for individuals. These concerns, the authors contend, lead people to strive to be known as supportive and selfless in their advice giving so that they are trusted and embraced in their social networks.",

Regarding East/West contrasts, researchers found most East Asian groups -including participants from Japan, Hong Kong, and Taiwan -to be more indecisive than Westerners of European heritage (Li, Masuda, & Russell, 2014; Mann et al., 1998; Yates et al., 2010) .

These factors, in Ng and Hynie's data, mediated the link between culture and indecisiveness. Na\u00efve dialecticism involves embracing conflicting beliefs about the world, such as affirming both the positive and negative side of an issue. This cognitive approach may require more energy and reflection to reach a decision, given its complexity. High need for cognition, by definition, would also promote more cognitive investment in the decision-making process. Yates et al. (2010) proposed that relevant norms common in China and Japan might differ despite their shared collectivism; Japanese might be especially indecisive because they value indecisiveness, perhaps under a more flattering label such as ''thoroughness.\" The Japanese participants of Yates et al. (2010) reported being more indecisive than Chinese and Americans, and they were more likely than Chinese and Americans to admire indecisive people, too. Moreover, in a ''think aloud\" reasoning task, the Japanese participants chose to spend far more time on their deliberations than did their Chinese and American counterparts, indicating a preference for thoroughness. Li et al. (2014) documented a moderating role for decision importance in indecisiveness. They suggest that important decisions universally require the use of similar, high-investment strategies, diluting cultural differences. In their study of European Canadians and Hong Kong Chinese, both groups demonstrated equally high indecisiveness for important decision problems (e.g., choosing a career). Cultural differences were only observed for unimportant decisions (e.g., choosing what to have for dinner). Note that this is another example in which cultural differences depend on context -not all decision problems reveal the same pattern of differences.",

Other research has investigated the degrees to which novelty and usefulness are central to different cultures' definitions of creativity. In a comparison among China, Japan, and the U.S., the influence of perceived novelty on creativity ratings of products did not vary by country, and usefulness was more related to creativity for Americans and Japanese than for Chinese subjects (Paletz & Peng, 2008) . Few other studies have examined novelty and usefulness separately, but this distinction will be important for future work in order to determine more precisely how cultures define and evaluate creativity (Erez & Nouri, 2010) .",

Researchers have suggested that individualistic cultures promote deviance, uniqueness, and divergent thinking, whereas collectivistic cultures promote conformity in thinking (Erez & Nouri, 2010) . Goncalo and Staw (2006) found that, when instructed to be creative, subjects experimentally primed with individualism (vs. collectivism) generated more creative solutions to a problem. They also found that whether groups were asked to list the most creative or the most practical idea from their idea sets, ideas listed by individualistic groups were judged to be more creative than those of collectivist groups -regardless of whether they were instructed to be creative or practical (Study 3). The authors suggest that individualistic groups both generated and chose more creative ideas because of their inclination toward divergent thinking and, in a group context, their desire to be unique and to stand out in discussions for idea selection. Collectivistic groups, by contrast, were hesitant to share deviant ideas and to suggest unique options for selection. These study results support the idea that cultural differences in creativity may be due, at least in part, to how creative processes are shaped by social orientation. They also demonstrate that creativity is malleable via priming of social orientation.",

First, exposure to other cultures influences creativity when the exposure is ''deep\" and promotes a challenge to one's customary ways of thinking and behaving. Maddux and Galinsky (2009) found that the extent to which individuals adapt to-not merely live in -a foreign culture predicts creativity. Notably, some evidence suggests that cross-cultural exposure should be broad and deep in ''moderation.\" Cross-cultural experience of fashion house directors has been found to be beneficial for the perceived creativity of the house's products (Godart, Maddux, Shipilov, & Galinsky, 2015) , but only when the breadth and depth of the experience was not too extreme. The authors argued that too much depth of cross-cultural adaptation could lead people to lose sight of what is interesting and unique in the culture and they may become cognitively entrenched. Too much breadth in crosscultural experience (e.g., living in too many places) could lead people to become cognitively overwhelmed by information and therefore unable to use it well. Second, exposure to other cultures enhances creativity when the exposure allows for mental juxtaposition of two or more cultures. Leung and Chiu (2010) found that measured (Study 2) and experimentally-induced (Study 1) multicultural experience predicted creativity, but only when cultures were presented in tandem, either juxtaposed (e.g., a slide set on Chinese culture and American culture) or blended (e.g., a slide set on East/West cultural fusion). Leung and Chiu (2010) suggest that these effects occur because people with multicultural experience can sample ideas from non-overlapping cultures during the creative process, and joint presentation (vs. only presenting a single culture) also facilitates broader sampling. This in turn should lead to generating creative ideas. Tadmor, Galinsky, and Maddux (2012) argue that mere access to more cultural information does not lead to creativity, however. They instead suggest that the manner in which the information is processed is key. Specifically, integrative complexity -being able to understand and combine multiple perspectivesyields high creativity. Tadmor et al.'s findings support this mechanism. They found that only people who adopted an ''integration\" acculturation strategy -identifying with both their host and heritage cultures -were more creative (Cheng, Sanchez-Burks, & Lee, 2008, found similar results) . Those who identified with neither culture or with only one culture were less creative despite also having had multicultural experience. Integrative complexity mediated the effect of acculturation strategy on creativity, suggesting that integration acculturation boosted people's ability to simultaneously access and combine disparate information from different cultures.",

Whereas decisions are commitments to particular courses of action, judgments are opinions as to what was, is, or will be some decision-relevant state of the world (Yates & Potorowski, 2012) . Decisions rest at least partly on judgments, and highly accurate judgments support good decision making. Because people engage in judgment at several points in the decision process, much of the work on culture and judgment is covered in other sections of this paper. Here, we review cultural differences in overconfidence and attribution. Phillips and Wright (1977) sparked great interest in cultural variations in judgments nearly 40 years ago. English and Chinese participants answered trivia questions and indicated how confident they were in each of their answers. The Chinese judgments were much more overconfident than English judgments. Consider the items for which the participants said that they were 80% sure that their chosen answers were correct. The English students were, in fact, correct on about 67% of those occasions. The corresponding statistic for the Chinese students was only 52%.",

Research with several East Asian groups and North Americans has found that the former group is more prone to attributing causality to contextual factors. These judgment differences have been observed consistently in cultural artifacts such as newspapers, as well as in survey and experimental culture-priming studies (Lee, Hallahan, & Herzog, 1996; Morris & Peng, 1994; Peng & Knowles, 2003) . This is not to say that East Asians do not assign causality to people; they are more likely to do so, however, for collectives rather than individuals (Menon, Morris, Chiu, & Hong, 1999, referring to Hong Kong and Japanese Asians vs. Americans). When they do assign causality to an individual leader, it has been found to be based on the actions of the leader's group; thus individuals are held responsible according to their group's behavior (Zemba, Young, & Morris, 2006) .",

There is evidence that Indians make choices that are less closely linked to their personal preferences than do U.S. students (Savani et al., 2008) . As previously discussed, in Indian and several other collectivist cultures, people often use decision modes that involve and take other people into account. Therefore, the values and expectations of others -not just one's ownbecome an important consideration in decision-making. From this perspective, it makes sense that the decision maker's own values would have relatively less impact than in an individualistic culture, where fewer concerns must be considered. People in collectivist cultures can even find positive value in choosing options that adhere to norms rather than following personal preference. In one study, both Brazilians and Americans indicated that they were likely to follow norms when deciding on behavior. Further, the Brazilians were far more likely than the Americans to also indicate that they would be happy about following those norms (Bontempo, Lobel, & Triandis, 1990) . Similarly, Indians have not reported feeling constricted or burdened when accommodating others in their decision making (Savani et al., 2011) .

Imagine having to choose only one of two items that you find equally appealing -say, you only have enough money for one suit despite finding two that you really want. After choosing one item in this type of situation, decision makers often feel badly because they must forego the rejected item which they nevertheless liked as much as the chosen item. Researchers have found that after such a choice, people tend to change their values such that they rate the chosen item more highly than the rejected item despite initially liking the two equally. This presumably helps people feel better about their decisions since their values become aligned with them, ''justifying\" those decisions. Heine and Lehman (1997) found this ''spreading of alternatives\" effect in Canadians, particularly for situations in which decisionrelevant negative arousal was induced, but Japanese participants did not exhibit spreading of alternatives in any of their conditions. Another study found again that in a typical dissonance experimental paradigm, Japanese did not exhibit spreading of alternatives (Kitayama et al., 2004 , but see Izuma et al., 2010) . When primed to think about others, however, Japanese participants did exhibit the effect. The authors suggested that the interdependent values of their Japanese subjects meant that imagining the presence of others activated anxiety about social approval, and thus it became important to exhibit values consistent with their decisions.",

Eastern European groups represented in their study had especially high loss aversion while African groups on average had the lowest loss aversion. The authors measured various cultural variables in search of explanations of country-and individual-level differences. Country-level individualism was positively correlated with loss aversion. This relationship was also found at the individual level while controlling for country-level effects, such that a person's deviation from her country's mean individualism level was correlated with her loss aversion levels. This finding is consistent with Weber and Hsee's (2000) ''cushion hypothesis.\" They proposed that collectivist cultures support risk taking because one's close social network members can offer financial support in the event of setbacks. Thus, there is less reason to fear losses; they often can be alleviated. Also of note is that other country-level factors such as religious composition were related to loss aversion, although potential explanations remain to be explored.",

If, at a given moment, Kevin has eaten zero cookies, the prospect of eating one freshly-baked chocolate chip cookie sounds fabulous to him. If, at another given moment, Kevin just finished eating two cookies, then the prospect of eating one more cookie may sound nice but is likely not proportional to the excitement generated by eating the first cookie. If he waits for three hours and ''re-sets\" his reference point back to zero, eating that third cookie will be just as pleasurable as eating the first cookie. Arkes, Hirshleifer, Jiang, and Lim (2008) found that people ''re-set\" their reference points more after gains than after losses, reflecting behavior that maximizes hedonic pleasure. (This asymmetry makes subsequent gains especially satisfying and subsequent losses less aversive.) The same authors (Arkes, Hirshleifer, Jiang, & Lim, 2010) replicated this effect with both Americans and Asians (Chinese and Korean nationals), suggesting that this ''hedonic engineering\" may be a general human strategy. However, the Asian subjects adjusted their reference points more than American subjects. This tendency may reflect lower loss aversion in Asians. The authors also hypothesized that it may be related to East Asians' preference for accommodation to circumstances rather than altering circumstances to fit one's own preferences (Hsu, 1981) .",

More stars indicate greater goodness, in the decision maker's eyes. Observe that the situation illustrates ''feature conflict.\" One feature dimension favors Apt 1 while the other favors Apt 2; neither alternative would be described as ''dominating\" the other. Such a situation is sometimes described as a challenging ''tradeoff dilemma.\" Apt 1 is better by one star on Condition whereas the opposite is true for Distance. If the searcher chooses Apt 1, it might be because she feels that, in picking Apt 1 over Apt 2, she has traded a one-star advantage on Distance for a one-star advantage on Condition, and that that is consistent with what her actual experiences would be if she were to live in each apartment. The ''tradeoffs\" issue concerns how people should and do, in fact, resolve tradeoff dilemmas. This is important because almost all decision situations eventually are reduced to such dilemmas, in some form or another. Our primary concern here is whether and how cultures differ in how they resolve tradeoff dilemmas. There has been very little research on the matter. However, efforts by P.C. Chu and Eric Spires have been informative about cultural variations involving the People's Republic of China, Taiwan, Japan, and the U.S. (Chu & Spires, 2008; Chu, Spires, Farn, & Sueyoshi, 2005; Chu, Spires, & Sueyoshi, 1999) . One key finding has been that Japanese decision makers are significantly more attracted to noncompensatory schemes for addressing dilemmas and that Americans are among the most strongly inclined toward compensatory schemes. A ''compensatory\" approach is one such that weakness on one feature dimension can be offset or ''compensated for\" by strength on another. This was implied in our apartment example, where the decision maker chose Apt 1 because she felt that gaining an extra star's worth of condition more than made up for the sacrifice of suffering an extra star's burden in commuting each day. A ''noncompensatory\" scheme is one for which a deficiency on one feature dimension cannot be offset by strength on another. Suppose that in our apartment case, the searcher's scheme is such that an apartment simply must have three stars or more with respect to Condition. Thus, no matter how good Apt 2 was on Distance, it would never be chosen. This is just one form of noncompensation we see.",

In some studies, relative to their counterparts of another culture, Americans have been found to prefer direct communication (Adair, Brett, & Okumura, 2001) and take a more competitive approach (Pearson & Stephan, 1998) . In contrast to Americans, Japanese negotiators have been seen as more likely to use indirect communication and influence (e.g., sympathy, reference to status) while Brazilians more strongly favor collaboration, accommodation, and avoidance, especially for negotiations with in-group members. Other work has examined cultural effects in a more nuanced way. Gelfand et al. (2013) studied negotiating groups vs. individuals in Japanese and American cultures. They expected that groups would show greater cultural differences because social monitoring, which occurs in groups but not individual settings, would amplify concerns for adhering to social norms. Thus, a group (vs. solo) negotiation would strengthen already-present norms of competitiveness for Americans, whereas group negotiation would strengthen already-present norms for harmony with their Taiwanese participants. The researchers also expected that groups would outperform individuals in U.S. contexts, because people in groups would be more competitive than individuals. In the East Asian context, groups would perform worse than individuals, because people in groups would be more concerned with harmony, which is detrimental to achieving optimal negotiation outcomes. The study found partial support for this idea; American teams did not outperform solo negotiators, but Taiwanese groups performed worse than solo negotiators. Taiwanese groups also performed more poorly than American groups. The latter effect was mediated by harmony differences; Taiwanese groups performed more poorly due to their concerns with maintaining harmony.",

The authors found that cultural characteristics such as individualism and hierarchy did not seem related to joint outcomes. Instead, other factors were more important for achieving good joint outcomes, including values for information sharing, the ability to deal with several issues simultaneously, and motivation to continually improve on current options. Graham, Mintu, and Rodgers (1994) studied the ''problemsolving approach\" (PSA) to negotiation across 11 cultures. This approach emphasizes the use of information exchange to understand the other party's needs and concerns, ultimately with the goal of achieving mutually beneficial outcomes. The authors did not test the effect of its use on joint outcomes, but found it to be beneficial to the opposing party's profit in 5 cultures. It was detrimental to the user's profit in only one culture -Mexican -and the use of PSA was likely to be reciprocated in 8 of the cultures. They did find that bargainers from more individualistic cultures had lower PSA scores (that is, they bargained with more individualistic strategies) and achieved higher profits.

Importantly, the dyads were only as effective as their lowest-CQ members. Other factors such as international experience, emotional intelligence, and extraversion failed to predict integrative information behaviors (Imai & Gelfand, 2010) . CQ has also been found to be positively related to cultural perspective taking which, in turn, boosts intercultural cooperation (Mor et al., 2013) .

For example, someone who does not ''sacredly\" value gun ownership might support legislation that offers cash for handing in firearms in an attempt to reduce gun violence. If gun ownership is a sacred value for that person, however, virtually any option involving handing in his or her weapons would be unacceptable. Moreover, attempts to ''sweeten\" options that violate sacred values with money can actually backfire -such options become even less appealing because they evoke moral outrage (Ginges & Atran, 2014) . Research suggests that better ways of handling sacred values in cross-cultural decisions include adding a culturally meaningful, symbolic gesture (such as an apology) to increase the value of an option (Atran & Axelrod, 2008) .",

While that body of work has been richly informative, we note three resulting limitations. One, obviously, is that the generalizability of those findings to other cultural groups might be limited. Someone who hopes to learn about Mexican decision making would be ill-advised to only read the literature largely about East Asians and conclude, ''Since Mexicans are fairly collectivistic, like East Asians, their decision making practices must be similar.\" Thus we propose that investigators focus their efforts on a more diverse set of national cultures as well as differences within regional boundaries. A second, related limitation is that individualism and collectivism are frequently used to explain cultural differences to the neglect of other factors. When considering only a single East Asian and Western cultural group, this construct may very well account for differences. However, other collectivistic cultures likely make decisions very differently than, say, Japanese people, so other factors will need to be developed and examined as explanations of those differences. A third limitation is that early cultural work in psychology seldom differentiated between individual and group-level effects. That differentiation is crucial to properly understanding the relationships between variables of cultural interest. Hypothetically, a researcher might find a positive relationship between individualism and preference for unique products across 30 cultures at the group level. However, if the investigator were to look at individuals within a given culture, the relationship might be virtually null, reversed, or variable between groups (Na et al., 2010) . Some researchers have indeed demonstrated this type of effect (Leung & Cohen, 2011) .",

Effectiveness is subjective; it depends on the extent to which the intended outcome is achieved for the decision's beneficiary. Nevertheless, decision making practices of one culture may have inherent benefits or pitfalls affecting any culture that uses them. For example, Toyota's American offices seem to have imported very thorough Japanese decision making strategies (Liker, 2004) . Thoroughness might almost universally reduce people's likelihood of being blindsided by unexpected consequences, but it may also render decision making slow and cumbersome. Researchers may also explore what factors lead to successful (vs. disastrous) transfer of decision making practices. Must features of a particular strategy ''match\" the culture in order to be effective? Or might a clash between a foreign decision strategy and local habits push people to decide better?",
