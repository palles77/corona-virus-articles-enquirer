            "text": "The objective of the present study was to develop a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method for differential detection of turkey coronavirus (TCoV), infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV), and bovine coronavirus (BCoV). Primers were designed from conserved or variable regions of nucleocapsid (N) or spike (S) protein gene among TCoV, IBV, and BCoV and used in the same PCR reaction. Reverse transcription followed by the PCR reaction was used to amplify a portion of N or S gene of the corresponding coronaviruses. The PCR products were detected on agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide. Two PCR products, a 356-bp band corresponding to N gene and a 727-bp band corresponding to S gene, were obtained for TCoV isolates. In contrast, one PCR product of 356 bp corresponding to a fragment of N gene was obtained for IBV strains and one PCR product of 568 bp corresponding to a fragment of S gene was obtained for BCoV. There were no PCR products with the same primers for Newcastle disease virus, Marek's disease virus, turkey pox virus, pigeon pox virus, fowl pox virus, reovirus, infectious bursal disease virus, enterovirus, astrovirus, Salmonella enterica, Escherichia coli, and Mycoplasma gallisepticum. Performance of the assay with serially diluted RNA demonstrated that the multiplex PCR could detect 4.8 \u00d7 10 \u22123 g of TCoV RNA, 4.6 \u00d7 10 \u22124 g of IBV RNA, and 8.0 \u00d7 10 \u22122 g of BCoV RNA. These results indicated that the multiplex PCR as established in the present study is a rapid, sensitive, and specific method for differential detection of TCoV, IBV, and BCoV in a single PCR reaction.",

            "text": "Turkey coronavirus belongs to the family Coronaviridae, which is a group of enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses that infect a wide range of mammalian and avian species. The major structural proteins of coronavirus include phosphorylated nucleocapsid (N) protein, peplomeric glycoprotein (spike protein, S), and transmembrane glycoprotein (membrane protein, M). The spike protein contributes to the distinctive peplomers on the viral surface and contains neutralizing and group-specific epitopes. The spike protein is highly variable among different coronaviruses while M and N proteins are more conserved among coronaviruses between different antigenic groups (Saif, 1993 There is close antigenic and genomic relationship between TCoV and infectious bronchitic virus (IBV) according to studies of immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA), enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and sequence analysis in our and other laboratories (Guy et al., 1997; Stephensen et al., 1999; Breslin et al., 1999a,b; Loa et al., 2000; Akin et al., 2001) . In contrast, it was demonstrated that bovine coronavirus (BCoV) caused experimental enteric infection in turkey (Ismail et al., 2001) . Along with this result, close relationship between TCoV and BCoV were previously reported and TCoV was placed in antigenic group II as BCoV (Dea et al., 1990; Verbeek and Tijssen, 1991) . These cumulative results incur a postulated complicate nature of causative factors of turkey coronaviral enteritis. Further investigations of interactions among TCoV, IBV, and BCoV in the turkey flocks and in the field is crucial for developments of effective strategies to prevent and control this disease. Development of easy and simple diagnostic methods for detection and differentiation of TCoV, IBV, and BCoV in turkey intestines is necessary for studies on the contributions of theses different agents to the disease.",

These methods need multiple steps to differentiate TCoV, IBV, and BCoV. Detection of TCoV infection by antibodycapture ELISA was demonstrated using IBV as coating antigen (Loa et al., 2000) . This method cannot differentiate TCoV from IBV due to the cross reactivity of antibodies. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay is a new approach for detecting many veterinary important microorganisms with the distinct advantages of high sensitivity and specificity. Multiplex PCR assay for simultaneous detection and differentiation of bacterial and viral pathogens has been described. For example, IBV strains Mass and Ark could be differentially identified in a multiplex PCR assay (Wang and Khan, 1999) .",

The prototype isolate of TCoV was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Rockville, MD). The viruses were propagated in 22-day-old embryonated turkey eggs as previously described (Loa et al., 2001) . The presence of TCoV in the intestines of embryos was confirmed by TCoV-specific IFA and electron microscopy at the Indiana State Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory in West Lafayette, Indiana. Intestines of turkey embryos infected with TCoV were cut into pieces and homogenized with five-fold volume of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution. These homogenates were clarified by centrifugation at 1500 \u00d7 g for 10 min. The supernatants containing TCoV were used as virus source for preparation of RNA templates for reverse transcription (RT)-PCR reaction. For examination of sensitivity of RT-PCR reaction for TCoV RNA, the supernatants from centrifugation of the intestinal homogenate at 1500 \u00d7 g was ultracentrifuged at 100,000 \u00d7 g for 3 h with a 2 ml cushion of 60% (w/v) sucrose solution. The opalescent band on top of the 60% sucrose solution was collected and layered onto a 40-60% sucrose gradient and ultracentrifuged at 100,000 \u00d7 g for 20 h. Fractions were collected from the bottom of the tubes. The virus purified by sucrose gradient was used as source for preparation of RNA templates to determine the sensitivity of RT-PCR reaction.",

These primers recognize sequences unique to the S gene of TCoV that are not present in the S gene of IBV. As expected, primers S306F and S306R directed the amplification of a 727-bp product for all the 10 isolates of TCoV from six different states in the multiplex PCR and resulted in two bands along with the 357bp product for N gene. These results also indicated that the nucleotide sequences of S306F and S306R were conserved in the S protein genes of all the TCoV isolates examined. In contrast, the different IBV strains examined were negative with the primers S306F and S306R in the multiplex PCR and resulted in a single band corresponding to N gene.",

It is difficult to locate conserved primer positions that can specify the synthesis of a fragment of genomic sequences for both TCoV and BCoV. Alternatively, a pair of primers S3 and S6 was designed from S gene sequence of BCoV. These primers recognize sequences unique to S gene of BCoV that are not present in S gene of TCoV or IBV. As expected, primers S3 and S6 directed the amplification of a 568-bp product for BCoV and resulted in a single band in the multiplex PCR. It was previously reported that the nucleotide sequence of S gene from position 1295 to 2297 was highly conserved (91% similarity) among BCoV strains Mebus, F15, L9, and 4 Quebec isolates (Rekik and Dea, 1994) . The inter-primer spacing of primers S3 and S6 located at nucleotide position 1488-2055 of BCoV S gene, which is within the highly conserved region. Therefore, the primer pair of S3 and S6 is anticipated to be applicable for all the known BCoV strains.",

Recently, it was experimentally demonstrated that BCoV could cause enteric infection in turkeys (Ismail et al., 2001) . However, the real situation of BCoV in turkey flocks in the field has not been evaluated. A sensitive assay, such as the multiplex PCR as demonstrated in the present study, for differentiation between TCoV and BCoV in turkey intestines will aid to in this effort. As shown in the present study, all the nine intestinal samples from turkey flocks of different states were positive for TCoV but not for BCoV by the multiplex PCR. The protoype TCoV-ATCC was also positive for TCoV but not for BCoV by the multiplex PCR. However, this result did not rule out the possibility that BCoV may be involved in naturally occurring turkey coronaviral enteritis due to the limited sample numbers. In addition, these samples were propagated in turkey embryo by inoculation via amniotic sac. The stability of BCoV in turkey embryos under this procedure is not clear and BCoV may be lost during the process.",

The concern about the presence of IBV in the samples positive for TCoV should be further evaluated by PCR with primers designed from S protein gene of IBV. The similarities of S protein gene between IBV and TCoV or between IBV and BCoV were low.
