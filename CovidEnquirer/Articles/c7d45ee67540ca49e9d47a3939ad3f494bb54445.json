For safety issues, it would be useful to reduce the antigenic load of such vaccines while preserving their efficacy. In this study we show that the addition of polymer or oil adjuvants in a PRRS live vaccine enhanced the protection to challenge of vaccinated animals compared to a non-adjuvanted commercial reference. Moreover, for both types of adjuvants, despite lower antibody titers, the protection to challenge given by the adjuvanted vaccine containing only 50% of the antigen load was equivalent to the protection given by the non-adjuvanted vaccine. These results demonstrate that the addition of relevant adjuvants can enhance the efficacy of the protection conferred to animals by live vaccines.",

The most important would be a reduction of the antigenic dose delivered, which would lead to safety improvements, cost limitations and a better control of risks linked to the vaccination procedure. Indeed, whereas under experimental conditions 100% efficacy has been demonstrated using non-adjuvanted live vaccines, up to 10% of vaccinated animals still present a lack of protection in field practice after live vaccine delivery [1] . The use of adjuvants should reduce the number of low or not responding animals and therefore reduce the possible reservoir for the disease. Reducing the antigenic load could also lower the risk of reversions. Live vaccines can indeed also have an impact on the economical performance of herds as reversions to virulence have already been observed in the field. Finally, whereas the cost of bacterial or viral vaccine production can be very low, the vaccine strains of parasitic pathogens can be very expensive to maintain and produce.",

No viricidal effects could be observed in PRRS live vaccines with either Montanide Gel 01 PR or Montanide ISA 15A VG. However, pathogen production or attenuation is a complex mechanism and each antigenic media is unique for its process. Thus, such compatibility studies should be performed on any new antigenic phase before field trials in order to validate the result.",

Lung lesions are a good indicator of vaccine performance as they are strongly linked to the body weight gain of the animals. It should also be noted that the challenge was highly discriminative for the vaccines (experimental as well as commercial). Indeed, the virulent strain of virus we used presents 95% of genetic homology to the 2006/2007 Chinese strain which induced more than 40% of mortality in field condition.",
