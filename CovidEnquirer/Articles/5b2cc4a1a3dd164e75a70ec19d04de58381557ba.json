We demonstrate that murine norovirus (MNV) infection can significantly impair B cell development in the bone marrow in a signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) dependent, but interferon signaling independent manner. We also show that MNV replication is more pronounced in the absence of STAT1 in ex vivo cultured B cells. Interestingly, using bone marrow transplantation studies, we found that impaired B cell development requires Stat1 -/hematopoietic cells and Stat1 -/stromal cells, and that the presence of wild-type hematopoietic or stromal cells was sufficient to restore normal development of Stat1 -/-B cells. These results suggest that B cells normally restrain norovirus replication in a cell autonomous manner, and that wildtype STAT1 is required to protect B cell development during infection.",

They are non-enveloped RNA viruses that generally cause self-limiting diarrhea and vomiting in both children and adults. Each year in the United States, noroviruses account for 19-21 million cases of acute gastroenteritis and approximately 400,000 emergency room visits, mostly involving young children (Hall et al., 2013) . Though noroviruses have large impacts on human health, the study of norovirus pathogenesis was previously hampered by the lack of a small animal model of infection and the inability to grow the virus in cell culture, until 2003 when a novel norovirus, murine norovirus-1 (MNV-1), was isolated from laboratory mice and could be grown in cell culture (Karst et al., 2003; Wobus et al., 2004) . MNV-1 was found to have a tropism for macrophages and dendritic cells, and could be propagated in the RAW 264.7 mouse macrophage cell line (Wobus et al., 2004) . Many additional MNV strains have been subsequently identified, and all could similarly be propagated in RAW 264.7 cells, suggesting that macrophages could be the primary reservoir (Basic et al., 2014; Hsu et al., 2006; Shortland et al., 2014) . These discoveries were significant advancements for the study of noroviruses as they have contributed to the understanding of norovirus infection and immunity, as well as to the search for finding novel vaccines and treatments.",

MNV was also shown to infect and propagate in the cultured B cells lines WEHI-231 and M12 (Jones et al., 2014) . Interestingly, MNVinduced cytopathic effects (cell death) in cultured B cell lines was variable -MNV infection induced cell death in the immature B cell line WEHI-231 but not in the mature B cell line M12 (Jones et al., 2014) . A subsequent study found that MNV infection of CD19 + Peyer's patch cells resulted in upregulation of MHC class I and co-stimulatory molecules in vivo (Zhu et al., 2016) , implying that MNV might modulate B cell immune responses. Because B cells function to make antibodies in response to infection or vaccination and also act as antigen presenting cells, these data suggested that MNV infection could have a direct impact on adaptive as well as innate immunity.",

In this report, we describe for the first time that MNV infection causes a significant loss of developing B cells in the bone marrow which can be prevented by signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), an important anti-viral transcription factor. We also report that this inhibition of B cell development by MNV infection in the absence of STAT1 is likely due to a combination of direct and indirect mechanisms, rather than solely by direct infection and cell death of maturing B cells. Since B cells are the primary antibody producing cells and can also serve as antigen presenting cells, the studies reported herein are intriguing as they contribute to the knowledge about norovirus infection and pathogenesis.",

Also, a novel MNV strain (MNV-UW) was isolated from the mesenteric lymph node of a sentinel mouse from our institution as previously described (Hsu et al., 2006) . In contrast to MNV-4, this MNV-UW strain did not cause a cytopathic effect in RAW 264.7 cells.

Whereas MNV-4 causes 100% cytopathic effect by 48 h post-inoculation in the RAW 264.7 mouse macrophage cell line, MNV-UW did not cause a cytopathic effect even after 72 h post-inoculation. Since it has been reported that MNV may replicate in RAW 264.7 cells without causing a cytopathic effect (Shortland et al., 2014) , we instead used quantitative RT-PCR to verify if viral replication was occurring and to measure viral concentration. The MNV-UW isolate was passaged 3 times in RAW 264.7 cells to dilute out non-replicating virus, and the clarified cell lysate was evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR for MNV genome copies. The P3 supernatant contained 2.88 \u00d7 10 9 viral genome copies/mL. As expected, no plaques were visible by plaque assay. By comparison, the MNV-4 inoculum used throughout these experiments had a copy number of 4.02 \u00d7 10 10 viral genome copies/mL and a plaque titer of 5.2 \u00d7 10 6 plaques/mL. These results indicate that after 3 passages, the MNV-UW isolate could infect and replicate to a high genome copy number, and that the MNV-UW isolate is distinct from the MNV-4 isolate based on the differential induction of a cytopathic effect. Similar to Stat1 -/mice infected with MNV-4, mice infected with MNV-UW also showed significant depletion of developing pro-B/pre-B (Fractions A-C'), pre-B/immature B cells (Fraction D-E), and long-lived mature B cells (Fraction F) in the bone marrow, as well as a corresponding increase in Gr1 + CD11b + (granulocytes) and Gr1 -CD11b + (macrophages) cells (Fig. 5 ) when examined at 21 days PI. qRT-PCR confirmed that MNV-UW could be detected at high levels in the bone marrow of infected Stat1 -/mice at 21 days PI (Supplementary Figure 1A) .",

To test whether direct infection by MNV in STAT1-deficient B cells results in a cytopathic effect, we isolated B cells by B220 positive selection from the bone marrow of three na\u00efve Stat1 -/mice and placed the purified cells in culture. Cells from each mouse were incubated with MNV-4 at an MOI of 0.5 or uninfected control inoculum for 1 h, after which the inoculum was removed and replaced with culture media. Cells were then evaluated by trypan blue exclusion assay or flow cytometry to assess cell death at 2, 24 and 48 h PI. There was no difference in the percentage of dead cells between MNV-4 infected and uninfected cells by trypan blue exclusion (data not shown) or by flow cytometry at any time point (Fig. 6A) . Similar results were observed with cultured splenic B cells isolated from na\u00efve Stat1 -/mice by negative selection (Fig. 6B ) despite a steady increase of MNV-4 viral RNA measured by quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. 6C) . Interestingly, cultured splenic B cells from WT mice showed a less pronounced increase of MNV-4 viral RNA levels over time compared to cultured splenic B cells from Stat1 -/mice (Fig. 6C) . These data indicate that while MNV-4 can infect and replicate in cultured B cells (more pronounced in Stat1 -/cells), infection did not result in increased cell death.",

B cells were isolated from the bone marrow (A) or spleen (B) of n = 3 uninfected Stat1 -/mice and infected in vitro with MNV-4 at an MOI of 0.5 or mock infected with lysate control. Cells were evaluated at 2, 24 and 48 h for cell death by flow cytometry and Ghost Dye staining. (C) MNV genome copy number evaluated by quantitative RT-PCR in B cells isolated from the spleens of uninfected Stat1 -/and wild-type 129 mice and then infected in vitro at an MOI of 0.5. Fig. C is pooled data from 2 independent experiments. Bars represent mean \u00b1 SEM, * = P < 0.05. C.C. Hsu et al. Virology 515 (2018) 123-133 that reduced IL-7 expression in the bone marrow after infection could account for an indirect mechanism by which MNV caused decreased B cell progenitors. To test this, we first evaluated IL-7 mRNA expression in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) after in vitro infection since MNV has a tropism to infect macrophages. In WT BMDM, MNV-4 infection increased IL-7 gene expression 6.3-fold compared to uninfected WT BMDM (Fig. 7A) . However, in Stat1 -/-BMDM, MNV-4 infection decreased IL-7 gene expression approximately 1.5 fold (Fig. 7A) . These results suggest that IL-7 production in response to MNV-4 infection could be blunted in Stat1 -/mice and thus potentially affect B cell progenitor numbers. To test this in vivo, Stat1 -/mice were administered recombinant IL-7 for 7 days beginning on the day of MNV-4 infection to determine whether exogenous treatment would rescue the loss of B cells. Treatment with IL alone (i.e., uninfected mice) increased the number of B220 + CD43 + (A-C') and B220 + CD43 -(D-E) B cells approximately 3-fold, indicating that treatment with IL-7 was at a sufficient dose to stimulate B cell lymphopoiesis (Fig. 7B , PBS Control vs. IL-7 Control). IL-7 also stimulated an approximately 2-to 8-fold increase in the number of Stat1 -/-B cells in the MNV-4 infected group (Fig. 7B , PBS MNV-4 vs. IL-7 MNV-4) partially rescuing B cell development. However, B cell levels were still significantly lower in the MNV-4 IL-7 treated group relative to the uninfected IL-7 treated group (Fig. 7B , IL-7 Control vs. IL-7 MNV-4), indicating that IL-7 could not completely rescue B cell development back to uninfected IL-7 baseline levels. These results indicate that a reduction in IL-7 following MNV infection in Stat1 -/mice may play a partial role in the B cell losses seen after infection, but that other factors such as the loss of adequate innate immunity contributes to impaired B cell development and the loss of B cells in Stat1 -/mice.",

Specifically, Jones et al. reported that MNV infection caused cell death in vitro in the immature B cell line WEHI-231 but not in the mature B cell line M12. Since the bone marrow is the primary site of B cell development and contains immature and mature stages of B cells, we evaluated whether MNV infection in vivo would likewise cause a differential effect on B cell death depending on the cell stage of maturation of bone marrow B cells. We utilized MNV-4, a strain that causes persistent and systemic infections in mice (Hsu et al., 2006) , to evaluate changes in bone marrow B cells after infection. Herein, we report the novel finding that MNV-4 infection caused alterations in developing bone marrow B cells in vivo, however this effect did not differ between immature vs. mature B cells, as was seen in vitro. We show that MNV-4 infection resulted in a significant loss of pro-B/pre-B, immature B, and mature B cells within the bone marrow in Stat1 -/mice, and that this loss of B cells can be prevented by STAT1 in wild-type mice.",

            "text": "STAT1 is a transcription factor induced by type I (\u03b1 and \u03b2) and type II (\u03b3) interferons and is important in the immune response against viral infections (Kallal and Biron, 2013; Karst et al., 2003; Schneider et al., 2014) . Stat1 -/mice have been shown to be more susceptible to MNV infection resulting in increased clinical and histopathologic disease as compared to wild-type mice (Kahan et al., 2011; Karst et al., 2003; Mumphrey et al., 2007) . Similarly, mice deficient in the receptors for interferon \u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3 or \u03b1,\u03b2 alone also develop more severe disease following MNV infection compared to wild-type mice (Karst et al., 2003 ; C.C. Hsu et al. Virology 515 (2018 ) 123-133 Mumphrey et al., 2007 Rocha-Pereira et al., 2013; Thackray et al., 2012) . These data reveal the importance of the interferon/STAT1 signaling pathway in preventing MNV associated disease. However, in contrast to the B cell losses seen in our studies with Stat1 -/mice, we did not observe any changes to the bone marrow B cell populations of MNV-4 infected Ifn\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3R -/mice, suggesting that STAT1 is essential for normal B cell development and survival following MNV infection in a manner independent of interferon signaling. In a previous report on severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection, a similar difference in response to infection was reported between Stat1 -/mice and interferon-receptor deficient mice: viral infection caused severe lung disease and mortality in Stat1 -/mice, but only transient disease with recovery in Ifn\u03b1\u03b2R -/-, Ifn\u03b3R -/-, and wild-type mice (Frieman et al., 2010) . These data suggest that STAT1 may have specific modulatory functions independent of interferon signaling, such as in cell growth and proliferation (Frieman et al., 2010; Levy and Darnell, 2002; Ramana et al., 2000) . MNV causes a cytopathic effect in RAW 264.7 mouse macrophage cells by activating caspases and inducing apoptosis after direct infection (Bok et al., 2009; Furman et al., 2009; McFadden et al., 2011; Wobus et al., 2004) . A cytopathic effect is also seen in bone marrow-derived macrophages and bone marrow-derived dendritic cells derived from na\u00efve Stat1 -/mice upon MNV infection in vitro (Wobus et al., 2004) . MNV can also cause a cytopathic effect in the immature B cell line WEHI-231 (Jones et al., 2014) . However, we did not observe increased cytopathic effect in primary Stat1 -/-B cells, despite viral replication in these cells. One possible explanation for the lack of cell death observed is that perhaps our MOI of 0.5 was too low to cause significant MNVinduced cell death above the baseline level of cell death that was occurring in uninfected cells. By comparison, M12 and WEHI-231 cells were infected at an MOI of 5 (Jones et al., 2014) . Alternatively, our data could suggest that after MNV-4 infection, an indirect mechanism is also required to cause decreased bone marrow B cell populations in Stat1 -/mice rather than simply direct infection and cell death since: 1) there was no detectable increase in caspase 3/7 activation suggestive of apoptosis in B cells isolated from the bone marrow of MNV-4 infected Stat1 -/mice, 2) there was no difference in the amount of cell death between uninfected and MNV-infected bone marrow and splenic B cells purified from na\u00efve Stat1 -/mice and infected in vitro, and 3) bone marrow transplant experiments revealed that there was no depletion of CD45.2 + Stat1 -/-B cells after MNV-4 infection compared to uninfected controls in the presence of STAT1-sufficient stromal or WT bone marrow cells. Infection and replication without causing cell death has been reported for other viruses and may serve as a survival mechanism to propagate without killing the host (Hay and Kannourakis, 2002; Kaminskyy and Zhivotovsky, 2010) . Collectively, our data suggest that a combination of direct infection and an indirect mechanism is causing the loss of developing B cells in the bone marrow of Stat1 -/mice after MNV infection. In particular, our bone marrow chimera experiments suggest that B cell loss is dependent on having STAT1-deficiency in hematopoietic cells and in bone marrow stromal cells, and that a cellular component of STAT1-sufficient cells in WT bone marrow after reconstitution can protect against MNV induced B cell loss. Multiple cell types have been reported to be involved in the immune response against MNV including macrophages, dendritic cells, B cells, CD4 + and CD8 + T cells (Baldridge et al., 2016; Chachu et al., 2008a Chachu et al., , 2008b Nice et al., 2016) . Therefore, further investigation will be required to determine which component(s) of the WT bone marrow help prevent the depletion of B cells in Stat1 -/mice.",

We observed that IL-7 gene expression was increased in WT BMDM but not in Stat1 -/-BMDM upon MNV-4 infection. Therefore, we postulated that MNV-4 infection 'normally' induces IL-7 production that is necessary to maintain homeostatic levels of B cell progenitors in the bone marrow in WT mice, but that this increase does not occur to sufficient levels in infected Stat1 -/mice. In Stat1 -/mice, whereas MNV-4 infection decreased B cell subsets as expected in PBS treated mice, daily treatment with IL-7 partially rescued Stat1 -/-B cell development in infected mice by causing expansion of B cells to similar levels as uninfected PBS treated mice. However, even with this expansion, MNV-4 infected Stat1 -/mice treatment with IL-7 still showed a significant decrease in B cell subsets when compared to uninfected IL-7 treated mice. These results suggest that reduced IL-7 may be involved, at least in part, in the mechanism by which MNV decreases bone marrow B cells in Stat1 -/mice.",

            "text": "An increase in neutrophilic inflammation in the spleen and livers of Stat1 -/mice after MNV infection has been previously reported (Shortland et al., 2014) . We also observed that in MNV-infected Stat1 -/mice, the number of granulocytes significantly increased in the bone marrow as the B cell populations decreased. Gr1 + CD11b + granulocytes increased from approximately 38-60% of the total bone marrow population, while B220 + B cells decreased from 42% to 16% after MNV-4 infection. During inflammation, there is a reciprocal relationship between granulopoiesis and B lymphopoiesis as both occupy a common developmental niche within the bone marrow (Ueda et al., 2005 (Ueda et al., , 2004 . The proinflammatory cytokine TNF\u03b1 reduces the expression of the chemokine CXCL12, a crucial factor produced by stromal cells for the homing of hematopoietic progenitor cells and for B cell development in the bone marrow (Cain et al., 2009; Nagasawa, 2007) . This TNF\u03b1/ CXCL12 mediated response results in B cell depletion in the bone marrow secondary to B cell mobilization to the periphery, and is potentiated by IL-1\u03b2 which stimulates granulocyte expansion in the bone marrow (Cain et al., 2009; Ueda et al., 2004) . Alternatively, it has been reported that administration of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), a factor that promotes neutrophil proliferation, can suppress B lymphopoiesis in the bone marrow in mice by increasing B cell apoptosis mediated by decreased gene expression of CXCL12 and IL-7, independent of TNF\u03b1 (Day et al., 2015; Winkler et al., 2013) . Administration of G-CSF has also been shown to deplete specific populations of bone marrow macrophages essential for maintaining the hematopoietic stem cell niches (Winkler et al., 2010) , including those that give rise to developing B cells. Further investigation will be required to determine whether MNV, which has a tropism to infect macrophages, can similarly disrupt Stat1 -/bone marrow stromal macrophages essential for maintaining hematopoietic stem cell niches, or whether the B cell phenotype reported in our studies is a consequence of the increased cytokines and growth factors of bone marrow granulopoiesis.",

In wild-type and Stat1 -/mice administered doxorubicin to induce bone marrow toxicity, repopulation of the bone marrow B lymphocytes was delayed in mice lacking STAT1 compared to those with functional STAT1 (Datta et al., 2014) . Similarly, in our studies, STAT1 deficiency contributed to the diminished recovery of B cells in the bone marrow after MNV infection compared to WT mice. Our bone marrow chimera experiments further support the notion that cells lacking STAT1 are at a proliferative disadvantage compared to their WT counterparts with functional STAT1 since reconstitution of STAT1-deficient cells was lower compared to WT cells even when equally co-administered to either Rag2 -/-/Il2rg -/or Stat1 -/uninfected recipient mice. In people, complete or partial STAT1 deficiency has been described to result in an increased susceptibility to various infectious agents (Averbuch et al., 2011; Boisson-Dupuis et al., 2012; Dupuis et al., 2003) . Therefore, it would be interesting to determine whether norovirus infection can cause alterations in B cell populations in the bone marrow of infected humans, especially in those who have altered STAT1 expression as a result of genetic polymorphisms. Additionally, because many viruses have evolved to inhibit STAT1 signaling (Andrejeva et al., 2002; Fleming, 2016; Lin et al., 2005; Liu et al., 2005) , our results suggest that co-infection with noroviruses could result in significantly impaired B cell development and/or humoral immunity.",

We show for the first time that MNV decreases bone marrow B cells after infection in mice lacking STAT1 and that this decrease can be prevented by STAT1. We provide evidence that although MNV does directly infect and propagate in primary B cells, the decrease in B lymphopoiesis appears to require both direct infection and an indirect mechanism. Our studies reveal that perturbations of IL-7 expression in the bone marrow may play a role in the B cell losses seen, and that loss of STAT1 in both bone marrow cells and bone marrow stromal cells together may be essential components contributing to the B cell phenotype observed after MNV infection. We also show that WT bone marrow or stromal cells are able to prevent the B cell losses seen in Stat1 -/mice after MNV infection. It remains to be determined which cells from the bone marrow are responsible for the protection of Stat1 -/bone marrow B cells, as well as whether the granulocytic response is involved in the loss of Stat1 -/bone marrow B cells, in Stat1 -/mice infected with MNV.",
