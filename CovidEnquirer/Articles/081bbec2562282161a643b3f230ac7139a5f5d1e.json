The risk of peritonitis, although small, is present when obtaining a sample through rumenocentesis, and these samples generally have had lower pH values than similar samples collected by an oro gastric tube but are probably inherently more accurate. 49 Direct microscopic visualization of protozoa and bacteria should be performed. By placing one drop of rumen fluid on a clean microscope slide and viewing at least 10 different fields, protozoal counts can be assessed as either none, few, moderate, or abundant. Protozoal counts are variable and not as important as the number and viability of holotrichs and entodiniomorphs. Holotrichs have cilia all around or on both ends of their bodies, whereas entodiniomorphs have cilia only on their aboral end (Fig. 1) . The large entodiniomorphs are the most fragile of the protozoal species, whereas the holotrichs are the most hardy. All protozoa die at a pH ::5 5.0. Staining with Lugol's inactivates the protozoa and allows carbohydrate storage to be observed. Lack of dark staining indicates no carbohydrate storage. Smears of rumen fluid may be air-dried or heat-fixed and stained to determine the proportion of gram-negative to gram-positive bacteria. Gram-negative species generally predominate. 1 Rumen fluid with an overgrowth of gram-positive bacteria would be observed with rumen acidosis, whereas excessive reflux of abomasal fluid would still allow for gram-negative bacteria to predominate.",

The SAT refers to the time (normally 4 to 8 minutes depending on ration and time after feeding) required for fine particles in the rumen fluid to settle out and the large fibrous particles to float to the surface and foam to appear on the surface as a result of ingesta decomposition. The SAT is generally decreased with inactivity of the rumen microbial population from inappetance, rumen acidosis, and low nutritional value feed. 22 The MBR is an indirect method to assess the redox potential of the rumen microbial fermentation. One part of 0.03% methylene blue is mixed with 20 parts rumen fluid. A second tube of rumen fluid acts as a color control. At room temperature, the time to decolorization of the test sample to the control sample color is measured. The time for decoloration is inversely proportional to microbial activity with times greater than 6 minutes considered prolonged, 3 to 6 minutes normal for a predominately hay diet with some grain, and 3 minutes or less normal for mixed hay and grain diets. 23 Rumen fluid chloride levels may be measured from filtered fluid samples, with values greater than 30 mEq / L indicative of abomasal reflux caused by an abomasal or proximal small intestinal obstruction. The addition or contamination with up to 20% saliva, which has chloride concentrations similar to rumen fluid, does not appear to dramatically affect the chloride concentration. 23",

The authors prefer a four-quadrant method of abdominocentesis, because of the bovine species' ability to wall off and localize infections in their abdomen. The caudal quadrants are located in the caudoventral abdominal wall medial to the fold of the flank. The cranial quandrants are at sites approximately 5 cm caudal to the xyphoid and 5 cm on either side of the midline. 51 This technique is most easily accomplished by shaving and aseptically preparing the quadrants. Tail restraint is used for the procedure, as an 18-gauge 1.5-inch needle is used to collect the sample after quick insertion through the abdominal wall (Fig. 2) . Others have described use of a trocar and cannula. 89 Volume of fluid collected may range from 0 to 5 mL in normal nonpregnant cattle, with greater values in cattle in late gestation and postparturition. Sufficient fluid is obtained in more than 80% of cases. 2 ,51 Normal values for bovine peritoneal fluid are reported (Table 2) .",

Clinical signs vary with the type and quantity of feed ingested and the amount of time elapsed. Common signs include anorexia, depression, bruxism, weakness and dehydration, and loss of normal ruminal layering in the initial phase. 54 Reticulorumen motility subsides because of an increase in nondissociated volatile fatty acids,21 the rumen becomes distended with fluid, and feces become grayish, loose, foulsmelling, and foamy or blood tinged. Due to the increase in carbohydrate breakdown products, the rumen osmolality increases dramatically, contributing to an increased extracellular fluid influx into the rumen exacerbating the dehydration. 84 Central nervous system derangements caused by severe metabolic acidosis may be observed if the condition is not treated.

The syndrome has been classified as one of four types: I-failure of eructation; type II-omasal transport failure; type III-pyloric outflow obstruction; and type IV-indigestion of late gestation. 29 Most would classify vagus indigestion as either cranial or caudal functional stenosis. 12, 31 Realistically, a stenotic lesion is not present.

Lesions identified and believed to cause this condition include perireticular or large liver abscesses, traumatic reticuloperitonitis, toxic rumenitis, and neoplasms. 63 Proposed mechanisms include interference with the vagus nerve, which disrupts normal tension-receptor activity and causes a mechanical obstruction, or pain inhibiting normal motility.31 In addition to common signs for vagus indigestion, bradycardia (:5 60 beats/min), weak hypermotile rumen contractions, and signs of cranial abdominal pain have been reported. 61 An L-shaped rumen is created as the rumen enlarges with the dorsal sac expanding to the right of midline and the ventral sac enlarging to fill most of the right ventral quadrant of the abdomen 63 ( Fig. 3C ). Rectal palpation is helpful in diagnosing the rumen enlargement and occupation of the right ventral abdominal quadrant. Auscultation of rumen contractions is difficult because of the change in consistency of the rumen contents owing to excess fluid. In addition, ballottement results in appreciation of more fluid content because of the continued accumulation of water and saliva. As there is failure of the water to move abhorally and be absorbed, the animal may become dehydrated. Cranial abdominal radiography or ultrasound may be helpful in identifying perireticular foreign bodies or gas accumulation. ll , 59 If abscesses are present, clinicopathologic data of hyperproteinemia, hypergammaglobulinemia, and elevated white blood cell count and total protein in the peritoneal fluid may be supportive. Left-sided exploratory surgery and rumenotomy may be diagnostic for lesions of the cranial abdomen and therapeutic for removal of foreign bodies and / or drainage of abscesses.",

Abomasal reflux into the rumen causes rumen fluid chloride levels to be greater than 30 mEq / L and distention of the omasum and possibly the rumen (Fig. 4) . Abdominal distention (pappleshaped) is present on one or both sides (Fig. 3E) , with reduced fecal output and accompanying hypovolemia, hypochloremia, hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis. Many have elevated total protein and fibrinogen levels. Cows are generally depressed and appear clinically dehydrated and have normal or increased (normal heart rates and reduced or absent rumen motility.12 A definitive diagnosis may be made by laparot- omy and identification of a grossly distended nondisplaced abomasum and forestomach. Administration of metoclopramide may result in resolution of clinical signs and support the diagnosis. A similar condition may be encountered in cattle with the adult multicentric form of lymphosarcoma and involvement of the pylorus. Vagus indigestion secondary to right-sided volvulus may occur through either neurogenic or ischemic causes and, generally, abomasal distention becomes evident 2 to 4 days after surgery. Late gestation cows may be more predisposed to this condition,85 possibly because of compression of the abomasum or intestine. Diagnosis of this form of indigestion is by exclusion of other causes and a positive response postparturition or after cesarean section.",

The condition occurs as the abomasum becomes anatomically displaced from its normal position on the right side of the abdomen and becomes trapped and gas distended on the left side. An LDA may be visualized as it extends caudally to the 13th rib as a half-moon distention in the left paralumbar fossa with the rest of the paralumbar fossa being sunken in appearance. 64 In the early stages of the displacement or after hauling in a trailer, pings may be auscultated in the ventral portion of the abdomen, but the more common site would be more dorsally over the 8th to 13th ribs (Fig. 6) . Generally, these pings are diagnostic for LDA and no further diagnostics are necessary. With large LDAs, the area of pinging may occupy the majority of the left abdomen. Most LDAs are not palpable transrectally, but the dorsal sac of the rumen may feel displaced medially. In some instances, when multiple pings are ausculted, a stomach tube may be passed to relieve gas from the rumen and thus differentiate abomasal from rumen pings. Obstruction of the abomasum, whether on the left or right, results in accumulation of HCL in abomasum and backflow of this into the rumen may cause an increase greater than 30 mEq/L of CIin the rumen fluid. 81 The pH of the rumen fluid is not decreased as cattle that are anorectic generally have elevated pH levels because of continued , saliva buffering of rumen fluid. 36 The typical chemistry profile for a cow with an LDA includes a mild to moderate metabolic alkalosis with hypochloremia and hypokalemia. Urine may be alkalotic or a paradoxical aciduria may be observed. 55",

A right-sided abomasal volvulus (RTA) generally is much larger, and tympanitic resonance is appreciable over a greater area (Fig. 9 ).

With an RDA, the abomasum is occasionally palpable per rectum. Owing to the nature of the condition, an RTA has more severe clinical signs including dehydration, tachycardia, and greater abdominal distention. Because the obstructions generally are more complete as opposed to LDAs, rumen chloride levels are more consistently elevated. 81 Initially with an RDA and an acute RTA, a hypochloremic, hypokalemic metabolic alkalosis may be identified.

In many instances, cecal distention is observed in the paralumbar fossa when viewed from the side. When viewed from the rear, marked distention of the right paralumbar fossa is observed (see Fig.  3D ). Succussion elicits splashing sounds within the distended cecum.

Distended loops of proximal colon and, occasionally, distended loops of small intestine may also be palpable per rectum. Signs of colic, although relatively rare in cattle compared to horses, may be observed with cecal volvulus and include kicking at the abdomen, treading with the rear feet, lying down or standing and stretching out, and possibly an anxious or apprehensive attitude.

After the first day, signs of discomfort are not as pronounced and the animal becomes more lethargic and depressed. 75 The most common site of the intussusception is the jejunum, and although it does occur in adult cattle, the condition does appear to have an age predisposition for young calves. 19 Abdominal distention is not appreciable in the early stages but becomes pear-shaped as the condition progresses and later becomes greatly distended with a round contour when viewed from the rear (Fig. IIA and B) . Inconsistently, multiple small pings may be ausculted in and adjacent to the right paralumbar fossa (Fig. IIC) . Succussion and auscultation indicate fluid and gas within the intestine. A diagnosis may be achieved by transrectal palpation of multiple, dilated, turgid small intestine, and in some instances, the actual intussusception. In some cases, the small intestines are not only in the right abdominal cavity but in the left abdominal cavity and into the pelvic canal as well. Transrectal palpation of cows in midgestation to late gestation with an intussusception may reveal a dorsocaudally displaced uterus with distended small intestine not palpable.7 6 Feces become scant and mucoid with melena or hematochezia present. Hyponatremia, hypochloremia, hypocalcemia, azotemia, and hyperglycemia were identified in analysis of 57 case records. 19 Abdominocentesis yields a large volume of fluid with an elevated protein and nucleated white cell count, with severity corresponding to the duration of the disease process.",

The organism causes diffuse granulomatous changes in the distal ileum resulting in a protein-losing enteropathy. The most common clinical signs include diarrhea (in early stages may be intermittent), weight loss, and decreased milk production, with maintenance of appetite. Clinicopathologic data may demonstrate an anemia of chronic disease and hypoproteinemia. Diagnosis of the causative organism is by either fecal culture (100% specificity) that can take from 12 to 16 weeks depending on the culturing methods, serology, histopathology, or PCR of feces / tissues. Radiometric fecal culturing methods may reduce the time by approximately one half. 17 The DNA probe (IDEXX Laboratories, Westbrook, ME) detects the IS900 insertion sequence in M. paratuberculosis and results are available in 3 days. The test, although very specific, is less sensitive than the fecal culture and more expensive. 87 An agar gel immunodiffusion (ACID) test and an ELISA are offered for detection of antibodies to M. paratuberculosis. A positive ACID or ELISA test in an animal showing clinical signs of Johne's disease is fairly reliable as the tests are more than 990/0 specific. 79 Because the organism is slow growing, the ability to diagnose antibodies to M. paratuberculosis is limited in the early stages of infection and increases as the disease progresses. For herd surveillance, the ELISA test is more economical, approximately 99% specific with varied sensitivity depending upon the prevalence of Johne's in the herd, but more sensitive than the ACID test. 16 A complement fixation test is used by some laboratories with titers to M. paratuberculosis ~ 1:32 considered positive. As animals in the terminal stages of the disease may be anergic, negative serology results in animals demonstrating clinical signs of Johne's disease should be confirmed by intestinal biopsy, fecal culture, or both. With J ohne' s disease, the intestine is thickened with a corrugated appearance and regional lymph nodes are enlarged and edematous. Histopathology, culture, or PCR of the distal ileum or ileocecal lymph nodes may be used to confirm a diagnosis. In certain laboratories, identification of acid-fast organisms from rectal scrapings or feces are used diagnostically for animals with clinical signs of Johne's disease.",

Their results, however, can be misleading for several reasons. First, most flotation methods were designed for sheep and goats, which are more commonly infected with nematode parasites that are more fecund than Ostertagia. These methods may not be sensitive enough to pick up the low numbers of parasite eggs shed by cattle. 8 , 20, 37 The technique recommended for cattle is the modified Wisconsin technique. 8 Second, clinically normal animals can shed nematode eggs in their feces, which makes interpretation of positive results difficult. Third, cattle with type II ostertagiasis may have negative fecal examinations. Type II ostertagiasis occurs when large numbers of arrested larva suddenly emerge when climate conditions are favorable. Because there are no adults present, fecal examinations are negative. In these cases, measurement of serum pepsinogen, which rises during type II ostertagiasis, may be helpfu1. 3 Diagnosis based on response to treatment is common but can also be misleading. Cattle that undergo type II disease can have such severe abomasal damage that the abomasum heals with significant scarring. These animals have poor digestive function and will continue to have chronic diarrhea despite treatment with effective anthelmentics.",
