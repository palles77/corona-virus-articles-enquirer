            "text": "The cDNA nucleotide sequence of genome segment B encoding the VP1 protein was determined for the aquatic birnavirus GC1 isolated from the rockfish Sebastes schlegeli in Korea. The VP1 protein of GC1 contains a 2,538 bp open reading frame, which encodes a protein comprising 846 amino acid residues that has a predicted MW of 94 kDa. The sequence contains 6 potential Asn-X-Ser/Thr motifs. Eight potential Ser phosphorylation sites and 1 potential Tyr phophorylation site were also identified. GC1 contains the Leu-Lys-Asn (LKN) motif instead of the typical Gly-Asp-Asp (GDD) motif found in other aquatic birnaviruses. We also identified the GLPYIGKT motif, the putative GTPbinding site at amino acid position 248. In total, the VP1 regions of 22 birnavirus strains were compared for analyzing the genetic relationship among the family Birnaviridae. Based on the deduced amino acid sequences, GC1 was observed to be more closely related to the infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) from the USA, Japan, and Korea than the IPNV from Europe. Further, aquatic birnaviruses containing GC1 and IPNV have genogroups that are distinct from those in the genus Avibirnaviruses and Entomo-birnaviruses. The birnavirusstrains were clustered into 5 genogroups based on their amino acid sequences. The marine aquatic birnaviruses (MABVs) containing GC1 were included in the MABV genogroup; the IPNV strains isolated from Korea, Japan, and the USA were included in genogroup 1 and the IPNV strains isolated primarily from Europe were included in genogroup 2. Avibirnaviruses and entomobirnaviruses were included in genogroup 3 and 4, respectively.",

            "text": "Members of the family Birnaviridae have 2-segmented genomes -A and B. This family comprises 3 main genera, including the genus Aquabirnavirus, Avibirnavirus, and Entomobirnavirus [4, 19] . The type species of the genus Aquabirnavirus is the infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV); the genus comprises marine aquatic birnaviruses (MABV) of fish and shellfish [3] . Other members of the family Birnaviridae include infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) belongs to the genus Avibirnavirus, and Drosophila X virus (DVX) that belongs to the genus Entomobirnavirus. Aquatic birnaviruses are the largest and most diverse group of viruses within the family Birnaviridae. The first reported MABV was isolated from the yellowtail Seriola quinqueradiata in Japan [22] , other MABVs have been subsequently isolated from various marine fishes in Korea and Japan, and their characteristics have been investigated [7, 8, 14, 18, 23, 24] . The genome segment B of birnaviruses encodes the VP1 protein, which is the presumptive virion-associated RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [13, 15] . Some researchers reported the characteristics of VP1 and compared the VP1 region among birnaviruses [4, 25] . They identified several conserved domains associated with RdRps and GTP-binding proteinsin the IPNV strains; these domains were the same as those in other RNA viruses. However, they also discovered that the typical Gly-Asp-Asp (GDD) motif that is found in all RNA viruses was absent in the VP1 region of some IPNV [4] IBDV, and DXV [2] strains. The physical, antigenic, and genetic features of the VP2/NS junction region of the aquatic birnavirus GC1 isolated from the rockfish Sebastes (S.) schlegeli, which is the second most important in the aquaculture industry in Korea, has been studied [8, 9, 20] .",

We observed that the VP1 sequence contained 6 potential Asn-X-Ser/Thr motifs. These motifs were presumed to contain an N-linked glycosylation site. There were 8 potential Ser phosphorylation sitesand 1 Tyr phophorylation site. The amino acid sequence of VP1 did not contain the GDD motif, which exists commonly in the RdRps of RNA viruses; however, we could identifythe Leu-Lys-Asn (LKN) motif at position 521 (Table 3) . Further, we confirmed the 'GLPYIGKT'motif at amino acid position 248; this motif is the putative GTP-binding site that is commonly found in other aquatic birnaviruses.",

The MABV genogroup consisted of strains such as GC1 and NC1 from Korea and YT01A, H1, AY98, and Y6 from Japan. Genogroup 1 mostly consisted of strains from the Pacific coastal nations; DRT is from Korea, WB from the USA, Jasper from Canada, and AM98 from Japan.

The estimated molecular weight of VP1 ranges from 95 kDa for the Jasper isolate [4] to 89 kDa for the Sp and Ab isolates of IPNV [6] . The molecular weight of GC1 has been estimated as 94 kDa and has been shown to be similar to that of the Jasper strain. Some researchers have reported that the sequence GXXXXGKS/T is a constant motif in GTP-binding proteins [1, 16] and is observed in several viral proteins that have a tentative role in RNA replication [15] . The same motif was present in the IPNV strains [4] and in GC1 between residues 248 and 255 (GLPYIGKT). We believe that this motif represents a potential GTP-binding site in the VP1 protein, and has been conserved in GC1, including aquatic birnaviruses. As reported previously [1, 5, 17] , the GDD sequence is a highly conserved motif that is present in almost all putative RdRps. Researchers have found that the Asp-Asp (DD) sequence lacking Gly, is conserved in IBDV, and also that IPNV does not contain the typical GDD motif in the corresponding region of its VP1 [4, 21] . Some IPNV strains containedthe Leu-Lys-Asp (LKD) or LKN motifs instead of the typical GDD motif [4] . GC1 contains the LKN motif instead of the typical GDD motif, which is present in other aquatic birnaviruses.",
