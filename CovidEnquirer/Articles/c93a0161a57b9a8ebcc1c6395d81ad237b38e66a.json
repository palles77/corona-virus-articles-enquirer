Hybridoma cell lines, from the fusion of P3-NS1-Ag4/1 myeloma cells with spleen cells sensitised to the porcine coronavirus causing transmissible gastroenteritis, were injected intraperitoneally into these mice to produce ascitic fluid containing monoclonal antibodies. Mice of 11 weeks of age weighing between 26 and 34 g were used. The volume of ascites produced by mice injected with four of the five hybrid cell lines tested was greater in the cross-bred offspring than in the BALB/c parent. The fifth cell line gave comparable volumes in the MF1 cross-breed and BALB/c parent but a lesser volume in the Swiss-Webster cross-breed. The antibody titres of the ascites as determined by virus neutralisation, radioimmune and indirect immune fluorescence assays, did not differ significantly between mouse types. The ability to use all offspring from a litter of cross-bred mice, irrespective of sex, and the increased volume of ascitic fluid formed in each mouse, permits fewer animals to be used for the production of ascites in these strains, thereby offering considerable economic and ethical advantages over the use of BALB/c mice.",

However, further work at this laboratory has shown that the MF1 x mice are ready for use at 6 weeks of age. Although they have a slightly lower body weight at this age they produce as much ascitic fluid as their 11-week-old counterparts. Although BALB/c, SWR and MF1 mice are reasonably docile and easy to handle, there is a marked difference in the temperaments of both types of cross-breed. Even at 11 weeks of age the cross-bred mice are much more agitated and aggressive when handled.",

The BALB/c mice are usually ready for fluid harvest 16-21 days (mean 17.508 days _+ 2.3823) following injection so that the fluid is collected within a short time span. However, the SWR/X mice require 16-26 days (mean 20.29 days+ 3.6964) and the MF1/x mice require 18-24 days (20.70 days _+ 1.7822) before the ascites are ready.

The cross-bred mice, especially the MF1/X, showed greater consistency with regard to the volume of fluid that can be collected from a given number of mice. At this laboratory there have been some problems with BALB/c mice producing an increased proportion of hard tumours, so reducing the volume of fluid that can be collected. We are now using MF1/x mice for the routine production of ascitic fluids where the longer time taken for the fluids to form is not of importance. The choice of these mice in preference to the SWR/x was based on the larger litter sizes and the greater body weight. In addition to this, unlike the BALB/c parents, when the hybridoma cells induced hard tumours there was a continued, if reduced, production of fluid in these mice.",

In many laboratories fluid is removed from the mouse by the repeated insertion of a sterile hypodermic needle into the abdominal cavity to permit drainage of the fluid. In this laboratory the mice are allowed to produce fluid until they are visibly distended and then killed. In larger mice the peritoneal cavity will provide a greater area for the fluid to accumulate before the mice start swelling. It may also take a longer time for full distension to occur.",

In the cross-bred mice no such correlation between sex and yield was seen, indicating the possibility of using both male and female mice. This implies a more economical use of all animals from a litter of MF1/x mice, rather than just the males as is normal with BALB/c mice. The mean volume of ascitic fluid harvested from the three strains also shows that the MF1/x produce up to twice as much fluid as the BALB/c strain. This suggests that only half the number of mice is needed to generate the same volume of fluid as the BALB/c strain. This represents not only a more ethical usage of mice since fewer mice are required but is also advantageous in that less time, media and culture vessels are needed to grow the necessary hybridoma cells. Alternatively, one might use the same number of cross-bred mice as the BALB/c mice resulting in a larger volume of fluid. The result of this would be a long-lasting reserve of that particular ascites obviating the necessity for repeated use of more mice to generate further fluid. The advantage of this latter course is that one could be relatively certain that the antibody one is using remains constant in terms of titre and specificity.",
