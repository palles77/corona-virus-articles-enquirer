According to several studies from developed countries, the annual incidence of CAP in adults is in the range of 0.5-1.1%, and the mortality rate of hospitalized CAP patients is 4-14% [2] . Previous reports have suggested that various pathogens including bacteria, fungi, and viruses are associated with CAP [3] . Among these, Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is a major cause of CAP in adult patients, particularly in those with severe diseases [2] [3] [4] [5] . Bacteria such as Haemophilus influenzae, methicillinsensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), Legionella pneumophila, and Moraxella catarrhalis are associated with CAP in adult inpatients [2] [3] [4] [5] , while other types such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae are detected in relatively mild CAP in outpatients [6] .",

Recent molecular epidemiological studies suggest that these viruses can be classified into numerous phylogenetic subtypes and genotypes. Specifically, there are over 150 genotypes of HRV species A to C (HRV-A to -C). Similarly, RSV and HPIV species can be subclassified into several genotypes. Recent studies have demonstrated the presence of these respiratory viruses and/or bacteria in adult patients with CAP [16, 17] .

In addition, phylogenetic analyses of HMPV, RSV, and HRV indicate that different subgroups and genotypes of the viruses may be associated with CAP inpatients in Japan. Many previous reports have suggested that pneumococcus is a major causative pathogen in CAP [2] [3] [4] [5] 28] . For example, Lim et al. showed that pneumococcus was the predominant causative bacterium in hospitalized CAP patients in the United Kingdom, followed by Chlamydophila pneumoniae and H. influenzae [29] . Ishida et al. reported that the bacterial pathogens in Japanese CAP patients were pneumococcus, H. influenzae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae, in descending order of prevalence [30] .

In addition, the molecular epidemiology of CAPassociated viruses is poorly understood; although, some CAP-associated respiratory viruses such as HMPV and HRV-C have recently been confirmed [32] [33] [34] . Our results show that HMPV, RSV, HRV, and HPIV are associated with CAP in adult inpatients. The viruses were classified into subgroups and genotypes based on genetic divergence in the phylogenetic trees (Fig. 1a-c) . This indicates that viruses such as HMPV, RSV, and HPIV could have been associated with over 10% of r e s p i r a t o r y i n v e s t i g a t i o n 5 4 ( 2 0 1 6 ) 2 5 5 -2 6 3 CAP inpatients. Although we found no correlation between the phylogenies of these viruses and disease severity, the estimate was inferred from the seasonal prevalence of these strains [35] . Regarding CMV detection, it is not possible to distinguish between active respiratory infection and asymptomatic/latent infection, especially in clinically ill patients [36, 37] . The present study confirmed two previous observations. First, bacteria (alone) were the most frequently detected pathogens among CAP patients (39.5%), and there was equal prevalence of virus only (10.5%) and co-detection (11.8%), as reported before [28, 38, 39] . Thus, viral infections should be considered major pathogens of CAP, even in adult patients.",
