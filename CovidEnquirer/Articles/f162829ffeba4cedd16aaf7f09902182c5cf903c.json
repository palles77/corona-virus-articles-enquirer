Here we demonstrate that targeting the RNase that degrades R-loops, which cause DNA breaks, exacerbates the cost of resistance. Consequently, lack of RNase HI function drives resistant clones to extinction in populations with high initial frequency of resistance, both in laboratory conditions and in a mouse model of gut colonization. Thus, RNase HI provides a target specific against resistant bacteria, which we validate using a repurposed drug. In summary, we revealed key mechanisms underlying the cost of antibiotic resistance that can be exploited to specifically eliminate resistant bacteria.",

Its maintenance and spread in bacterial populations depend on the rate at which resistance is acquired and on its effect on bacterial fitness. This effect is typically deleterious, resulting in the so-called cost of resistance. The cost of resistance is influenced by the environment, by interactions between the resistances and the genetic background in which they appear (epistasis), and by subsequent acquisition of mutations compensating for fitness defects (compensatory evolution) (2). Importantly, the magnitude of the cost is the main biological parameter influencing the fate of resistances upon reducing antibiotic use (3).",

These target proteins are typically involved in essential functions, such as transcription, translation, DNA replication or cell wall biosynthesis. Resistance mutations cause alterations in the structure of the target protein, rendering it insensitive to the drug, but often adversely affecting its function (2,3,5). These pleiotropic effects hold the key to manipulating resistance levels in bacterial populations (3). Rifampicin and streptomycin resistance mutations (Rif R and Str R ), common in pathogenic bacteria (6-8), map to the genes rpoB and rpsL, encoding the \u03b2' subunit of the RNA polymerase and the protein S12 of the 30S ribosomal subunit, respectively. Rif R and Str R mutations are representative examples of resistances to antibiotics targeting transcription and translation, respectively. Rif R mutations show different costs (9,10) and cause alterations in the rates of transcription initiation, elongation, slippage or termination (9,11-23). Likewise, most Str R mutations also cause a cost (24-26) and affect translation fidelity and processivity (24, (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) (31) (32) (33) (34) . Thus, at present, the costs of Rif R and Str R mutations are thought to be caused by defects in protein synthesis, either at a global cellular level (35-37) or limited to specific functions or regulons (22, 24, 38, 39) .",

This suggests that the reduction of the cost can be achieved by reinforcing the coupling between transcription and translation, besides the previously described partial recovery in protein biosynthesis (3). Coupling between transcription and translation is known to prevent spontaneous backtracking of the RNA polymerase which, if exacerbated, can cause a series of molecular events that ultimately lead to the generation of double-strand DNA breaks (42)(43) (44) (45) (46) . This led us to hypothesize that cells carrying different Rif R and Str R mutations have higher number of DNA breaks, which greatly contribute to their cost.",

The involvement of Rloops in the generation of DNA breaks allowed us to identify RNase HI as an important determinant of the cost of resistance, which we validate using a repurposed drug. We further show that targeting RNase HI is a plausible strategy for the selective elimination of resistant bacteria, as lack of RNase HI leads to extinction of resistant clones when competing against sensitive bacteria in laboratory conditions, abolishing compensatory evolution. Importantly, eradication of resistant bacteria lacking RNase HI is remarkably efficient in the mammalian gut as well. Altogether, we reveal an unexpected cause of the cost of antibiotic resistance, which can be exploited to selectively eliminate resistant bacteria in polymorphic populations.",

We carried out these assays in sensitive Escherichia coli, Str R strains (RpsL K43N , RpsL K43T , and RpsL K43R ), Rif R strains (RpoB H526L , RpoB H526Y , and RpoB S531F ), and double resistant mutants carrying the nine possible combinations of these resistance alleles. Remarkably, fourteen out of the fifteen resistant strains show increased SOS activation ( Figure 1A ), demonstrating that resistance mutations indeed cause DNA breaks. Moreover, the SOS induction strongly correlates with the cost of resistance, explaining 73% of its variation ( Figure 1B) , suggesting that DNA breaks are key contributors to the cost of resistance. To independently confirm the occurrence of DNA breaks in resistant bacteria, we used a system which permits direct visualization of double-stranded DNA ends by fluorescence microscopy (49). We combined this system with the SOS reporter, and analyzed a subset of resistant mutants and sensitive bacteria. As expected, this corroborated that resistance mutations indeed cause increased number of DNA breaks (Table 1, Figure S1 ). We then asked if resistance mutations involving a different mechanism which could lead to perturbations of transcription-translation coupling also generate DNA breaks. The commonly used antibiotic erythromycin targets the 50S ribosomal subunit, affecting translation and its coupling with transcription (50). Erythromycin resistance mutations (Erm R ) mapping to the genes rplD and rplV (encoding the 50S ribosomal subunit proteins L4 and L22, respectively) are known to reduce translation elongation rate (51,52), likely affecting transcription-translation coupling.",

As expected, the costs are smaller in the evolved strains and, as hypothesized, all the nine compensated clones show decreased SOS induction compared to their resistant ancestor ( Figure 2B ).

Our hypothesis predicts that DNA breaks should be reduced in minimal medium, where replication-transcription conflicts are less pronounced ( Figure 3B ). In agreement with our hypothesis, the SOS induction is smaller in minimal than in rich media ( Figure 3C , right panel), and the correlation with the cost is much weaker in minimal medium ( Figure S2B ). Coherently, the number of resistant mutants showing a fitness cost is smaller in minimal medium (8, compared to 13 in rich medium), with four of them even showing a higher fitness than sensitive bacteria ( Figure 3C , left panel). Moreover, some of the most costly mutations in rich medium (e. g. RpsL K43N RpoB H526Y and RpsL K43T RpoB H526Y ) generate a much smaller cost in minimal medium (compare Figure 1A with Figure 3C ). Besides this general trend, however, there are resistant mutants (notably, those carrying the allele RpoB S531F ) that conserve or even increase their fitness cost in minimal medium (compare Figure 1A with Figure 3C ), evidencing the existence of additional factors contributing to the cost of resistance (such as the known defects in protein synthesis). Conversely, our hypothesis also anticipates that increasing the occurrence of replication-transcription conflicts by overexpressing DnaA should particularly affect resistant bacteria. As hypothesized, overexpression of dnaA severely compromises the viability of double resistant bacteria, whereas sensitive bacteria remains largely unaffected ( Figure 3D ). Altogether, these results demonstrate the involvement of replication-transcription conflicts in the generation of the cost of antibiotic resistance, also corroborating the key contribution of DNA breaks to it.",

Chemical inhibition was not as effective as genetic removal (which increases cost on average by 28%) ( Figure 4C and D), as may be expected, since stability, diffusibility across the bacterial envelope, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of RHI001 in vivo are unknown, and potentially suboptimal. Nevertheless, these results suggest that inhibiting RNase HI may be a plausible strategy to select specifically against resistant strains coexisting with sensitive bacteria, as long as resistant strains fail to evolve adaptations that abrogate their extinction. In order to test this hypothesis, we propagated a mixture of sensitive bacteria (CFP-labeled) competing against a pool of five single resistant mutants (YFP-labeled RpsL K43N , RpsL K43T , RpoB H526L , RpoB H526Y , and RpoB S531F ) during 15 days, in the absence of antibiotics.

            "text": "In parallel, we performed identical propagations, but in which all strains lack RNase HI, as a proxy for optimal inhibition of RNase HI function. We observed that, in the presence of RNase HI, sensitive bacteria initially outcompete resistant clones but, as the propagation progresses, resistant bacteria increase in frequency -likely due to compensatory evolution -finally reaching coexistence ( Figure 5A Figure 5B ). Since the outcome of competitions under laboratory conditions can differ from those within the host (4,66), we next tested if inhibition of RNase HI would be an effective strategy in an animal model. We used the well-established mouse gut colonization model, which resembles the natural environment of many bacterial pathogens, including E. coli (67) . We colonized by oral gavage two cohorts of mice (each n=6): one with a 1:9 ratio mixture of CFP-tagged sensitive bacteria and a YFP-labeled double resistant strain [RpsL K43T RpoB H526Y , selected based on its ability to efficiently colonize the mammalian gut (68) ], and the other with an identical mixture but in which both strains are \u0394rnhA. We then followed the frequency and absolute numbers [Colony Forming Units (CFUs) per gram of feces] of the resistant strain over time. Remarkably, when RNase HI function is intact, the double resistant strain persists in the gut of all animals at frequencies between 2.3 and 9.3% ( Figure 5C , blue lines) and high bacterial loads ( Figure 5D , blue lines) two weeks after gavage but, in the absence of RNase HI, resistant clones are rapidly outcompeted by sensitive bacteria ( Figure 5C and D, red lines). Indeed, resistant bacteria are driven to extremely low frequencies in as soon as 1 day postcolonization, and their extinction occurs in all the six mice in as soon as 5 days ( Figure 5C and D, red lines), demonstrating that RNase HI is a new target for efficiently eliminating resistant strains in the gut. Surprisingly, the absence of RNase HI does not lead to any detectable fitness defect in the sensitive bacteria, as the loads of E. coli are similar in the two cohorts of mice ( Figure 5E ). We then queried if the sequential application of an RNase HI inhibitor followed by an antibiotic could successfully eliminate the entire population of a potential gut pathogenic species composed of sensitive and resistant strains. In this scenario, we hypothesize that an antibiotic treatment should render completely different outcomes depending on the presence of RNase HI function. Indeed, a week-long treatment of streptomycin starting at day 16 after gavage enables resistant clones with intact RNase HI function to rebound and reach high loads (10 7 -10 8 CFUs/g feces), but it completely erradicates \u0394rnhA bacteria in all the six mice ( Figure 5F ). These results demonstrate that RNAse HI function is not only a key determinant of the fitness of resistant bacteria, but also a potential co-adjuvant to eliminate undesirable bacteria in a natural environment for bacterial pathogens such as the mammalian gut. Altogether, these results show the enormous potential of targeting RNase HI as a promising antimicrobial therapy.",

Compensatory evolution indicates that these resistances cause uncoupling between transcription and translation (40) , which can result in DNA breaks (42). Indeed, we show that the RpsL K43N RpoB H526Y and RpsL K43T RpoB H526Y double mutants, which combine alleles that cause increased transcription elongation rate (12) and decreased translation rate (26, 69) , show the highest costs and DNA breaks ( Figure 1 ). Curiously, inhibition of translation has been shown to alleviate the cost of Rif R mutations in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (36) . In light of the results presented here, this observation is compatible with a scenario in which Rif R mutations cause a perturbation of transcription-translation coupling by virtue of reduced RNA polymerase processivity, and translation inhibitors promote re-coupling by decreasing ribosomal activity. In agreement with the notion of single resistance mutations causing significant uncoupling, single Rif R or Str R mutations with high cost (70) cause a strong induction of the SOS response ( Figure   S7 ). We also showed that RNase HI is a key determinant of the fitness of resistant mutants ( Figure 4 , Table 1 , Figure S3 , Figure S4A , Figure S5 , Figure The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/756767 doi: bioRxiv preprint",

Interestingly, DksA is also involved in preventing replicationtranscription conflicts (73) . Thus, prevention of the conflicts by DksA might also account for its beneficial effect on resistant bacteria, besides the enhancement of DNA repair. The involvement of replication-transcription conflicts in the cost of resistance is coherent with previous observations, such as the small cost of specific Rif R and/or Str R alleles in minimal medium (24, 74, 75) or the outcompetition of sensitive bacteria by resistant mutants in aging colonies (76, 77) . Interestingly, stable DNA replication (initiation of DNA replication at sites different from OriC) can be induced by lack of RNase HI or by conditions that activate SOS (78) . Thus, Rif R and Str R mutations, which induce SOS This detrimental runaway loop, as well as the effects of the environment on the cost described above ( Figure 1A and Figure 3C ), could potentially be exploited therapeutically, via concurrent chemical and dietary treatments designed to synergistically maximize the cost of resistance.",

The presence of each construction/mutation was assessed by PCR-mediated amplification of the corresponding region and Sanger sequencing. The Gam-GFP construction (49) was generously contributed by Professor Susan M. Rosenberg. The chromosomal construction comprising a copy of the rnhA gene under the control of a promoter inducible by arabinose (62) was kindly donated by Dr. Christian J. Rudolph. Derivatives of these strains carrying the PsulA-mCherry and different resistance mutations were constructed by P1 transduction. The plasmid pRB-5 (carrying the rnhA gene under the control of a promoter inducible by anhydrotetracycline) was constructed by PCR amplification of the vector pZS*11 (91) and the construction tetR-PLTetO-1-rnhA from strain RB1207, subsequent restriction with AatII and HindIII enzymes, ligation and electroporation. The construction tetR-PLTetO-1-rnhA in strain RB1207 was made by Lambda-Red recombineering (86-88), and selection/counterselection (85), over a previous PLtetO-1-sfGFP construction (92). The plasmids carrying an inducible copy of either dksA or dnaA were obtained from the ASKA library of E. coli ORF clones (93). Cultures were grown in either Lysogeny Broth (LB, Miller formulation) (94) or M9 broth supplemented with 0.4% glucose (95), in roundbottom 96-well plates incubated at 37\u00b0C with shaking (700 r.p.m.) in a Grant-bio PHMP-4 benchtop incubator, unless indicated otherwise. Solid medium was LB containing 1.5% agar. Media were supplemented when necessary with antibiotics at the following concentrations: rifampicin (100 \u00b5g/ml), fitness (selection coefficient per generation) of each YFP-tagged resistant strain carrying the SOS reporter was measured by competitive growth against a CFP-labeled isogenic sensitive strain E. coli K12 MG1655 also carrying the SOS reporter. The formula used to calculate the selection coefficient was s=[ln (NRf / NSf )\u2212 ln (NRi /NSi )] ln( NSf / NSi), being NRi and NRf the initial and final number of resistant bacteria, and NSi and NSf the initial and final number of sensitive bacteria. The competitor strains were first streaked out of their respective frozen vials, then individual colonies were inoculated separately in medium without antibiotics and incubated overnight (approximately 16h); the next morning, the number of cells in each culture was measured by Flow Cytometry, and 10 \u00b5l of 1:1 mixtures of YFP and CFP bacteria were added to 140 \u00b5l of medium, at an initial number of approximately 10 6 cells. The initial and final frequencies of the strains were obtained by counting their cell numbers in the Flow Cytometer. The number of generations was estimated from that of the reference strain (approximately five generations at 4h, and approximately eight generations at 24h), and the selection coefficient was determined as described above for each independent competition. The proportion of SOS-induced bacteria was quantified as the number of either YFPtagged or CFP-labeled bacteria showing red fluorescence (from the PsulA-mCherry SOS reporter fusion) above a threshold determined by the fluorescence levels of the control strains lexA (ind-) (constitutive repression of the SOS response) and \u0394lexA (constitutive activation of the SOS response) (96). The data represented is the induction level of each mutant normalized with respect to the induction levels of the sensitive it is competing against. In the competitions including the RNase HI inhibitor 2-[[[3-Bromo-LSR Fortessa TM SORP flow cytometer was used to quantify bacteria, using a 96-well plate High-Throughput Sampler (HTS) and SPHERO fluorescent spheres (AccuCount 2.0 \u00b5m blank particles), in order to accurately measure volumes. Bacterial numbers were calculated based on the counts of fluorescently labeled bacteria with respect the known number of beads added to a given volume. The instrument was equipped with a 488 nm laser used for scatter parameters and YFP detection, a 442 nm laser for CFP detection and a 561 nm laser for mCherry detection. Relative to optical configuration, CFP, YPF and mCherry were measured using bandpass filters in the range of 470/20 nm, 540/30 nm and 630/75nm, respectively. The analyzer is also equipped with a forward scatter (FSC) detector in a photomultiplier tube (PMT) to detect bacteria. The samples were acquired using FACSDiVa (version 6.2) software, and analyzed using FlowJo (version 10.0.7r2).

The initial frequencies of the fluorescent strains were confirmed by Flow Cytometry. Every 24h, during 15 days, bacterial cultures were diluted in 1X PBS by a factor of 10 \u22122 , then 10 \u00b5l of these diluted cultures were transferred to 140 \u00b5l fresh LB broth and allowed to grow for additional 24h, reaching approximately 10 9 cells/ml.

In the experiments involving sensitive and RpsL K43N RpoB H526Y strains carrying the expression vector pCA24N -gfp, either empty or carrying the gene dksA (93), the strains were streaked individually onto LB agar plates supplemented with the appropriate antibiotic (to select for the presence of the plasmid), and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C.
