No family was found to be ubiquitous and even peptidases thought to be essential for life, such as signal peptidase and methionyl aminopeptides are missing from some clades. There are 33 peptidase families common to archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes and are assumed to have originated in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA). These include peptidases with different catalytic types, exo-and endopeptidases, peptidases with different tertiary structures and peptidases from different families but with similar structures. This implies that the different catalytic types and structures pre-date LUCA. Other families have had their origins in the ancestors of viruses, archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants and animals, and a number of families have had their origins in the ancestors of particular phyla. The evolution of peptidases is compared to recent hypotheses about the evolution of organisms.",

            "text": "Although all proteolytic enzymes perform the same basic function, namely the cleavage of a carbon-nitrogen bond between two amino acids in a peptide or protein, they are otherwise remarkably diverse. There are two very different catalytic mechanisms. Most proteolytic enzymes are peptidases that activate a water molecule which results in hydrolysis of the peptide bond (classified as hydrolases in Enzyme Nomenclature, subclass EC 3.4) [1] . However, there are a small number of self-processing peptidases that are not hydrolases but which bring about peptide bond cleavage by the rearrangement (cyclization) of an asparagine residue to a succinimide [2] ; these are lyases (EC subclass 4.3). Amongst the peptidases, there are at least six different nucleophiles that bring about hydrolysis. In three of these activated water is bound to either aspartic acid residues (aspartic peptidases), glutamic acid residues (glutamic peptidases) or one or two metal ions (metallopeptidases). In the other three, the nucleophile is the hydroxyl of a serine (serine peptidases) or threonine (threonine peptidases) residue, or the thiol of a cysteine residue (cysteine peptidases). Although most frequently thought to be a triad [3] , the catalytic mechanism can be dependent upon only two residues, for example endopeptidase La (family S16) [4] , or in the case of metallopeptidases, may include many more. Metallopeptidases can rely upon one or two metal ions, in which case the metal is bound to the protein via three (one metal) or five (cocatalytic metals) residues [5] . The metal, although most frequently zinc, can also be cobalt, manganese, iron or copper. Then there are differences in activity. Many peptidases are endopeptidases, but there are also aminopeptidases, carboxypeptidases, dipeptidases, peptidyldipeptidases, dipeptidyl-peptidases and tripeptidyl-peptidases. Endopeptidases can also be restricted in the length of a peptide that can be cleaved (oligopeptidases) or many cleave peptide bonds that form between amino acid sidechains (isopeptidases). In a very few cases, peptide cleavage is associated with the transfer of another moiety to one of the free termini generated by the cleavage (transpeptidases) [6] . The number of different families of proteolytic enzymes, assembled from statistically significant similarities in protein sequence, is large. Even if the similarity in tertiary structures of proteolytic enzymes are taken into account, which reveals homologies not visible when only sequences are examined, there is still considerable variety. Usually, all the members of a single family utilize the same catalytic dyad or triad, or the same metal ligands for a metallopeptidase, but it does not follow that all members of a family are endopeptidases or exopeptidases, or that all members of a metallopeptidase family use the same divalent metal ions [7] .",

            "text": "A family of peptidases was assembled initially using the protein sequence of a well-characterized peptidase, for example bovine chymotrypsin, known as the \"type example\". To find homologues of a type example, sequence searches were conducted against either the UniProt knowledgebase [9] or the non-redundant protein sequence library at NCBI [10] using BlastP [11] . Within a family, other well characterized proteolytic enzymes with different substrate preferences were identified manually and each of these was designated a \"holotype\" for a particular set of substrate preferences. Any of these holotypes could be used for subsequent BlastP searches to identify more homologues in the family. Additionally, the sequence of the type example could be used to search for homologues in the UniProt knowledgebase using the HMMER3 website [12] . BlastP searches with holotype sequences other than the type example were necessary for any family in which there are more than 20,000 known homologues, because 20,000 is the maximum number of hits returned by an automated, remote BlastP search. In all of these searches, there had to be overlap within a region defined as the \"peptidase unit\", the (usually) single domain that carries the active site residues and/or the metal ligands, and the sequence relationship must have been at an E-value of 0.01 or less. If the active site residues (and/or metal ligands for metallopeptidase) were not all conserved, then the sequence was considered a \"non-peptidase homologue\". The results presented in this paper were derived from numerous searches conducted regularly since 1992, the last of which were BlastP searches at NCBI using type example sequences in April 2018.",

However, it must be acknowledged that there may be cases where a transfer in the other direction would be equally or more likely. For example, an ancient gene transfer may have been derived from an organism in a phylum or kingdom that has subsequently undergone mass extinction. In a challenging environment with little biodiversity, such as a thermal spring or the deep sea, then horizontal gene transfers will only occur between organisms that thrive there, and it may not be possible to identify the direction of the transfer.",

Many of these phyla are described as \"candidate\", derived mostly from metagenomics projects and environmental samples in which genomes have been assembled for organisms that have not been observed or otherwise studied. The completeness of such genomes must be questioned, because although it is possible to assemble a single chromosome, this would not represent the entirety of genetic material for most organisms. Eukaryotes and some bacteria contain more than one chromosome, and many organisms have organelles or plasmids that have their own genomes; and it is challenging to combine any of these to obtain the full genome of any organism that has not been isolated and studied. Supplementary Table 2 also shows the number of species per phylum where the genome has been completely sequenced, and the average number of peptidase homologues per genome. It might be assumed that the more complex the organism, the more peptidase genes its genome will encode, but as can be seen from the table, a sponge (Porifera) or an acorn worm (Hemichordata) has more peptidase homologues than a chordate. The numbers of proteins (and therefore peptidases) in a genome will depend upon the automated methods used to identify genes and the mRNAs they encode, and also upon the genome assembly. Chordate chromosomes can be rich in regions of tandem copies of genes; such regions can be difficult to assemble correctly, and individual genes difficult to identify, leading to an underestimation of the number. Some predicted proteomes are apparently rich in differently transcribed isoforms, even though there may be no evidence for their existence, and because the analyses performed here is comparison of protein sequences, isoforms will be seen as unique proteins. This inflates the number of protein genes in a genome. For model organisms, such as human, these peptidase homologues are merged following manual curation so that the number of homologues represents the number of genes, but this is time consuming and so far has not been automated. For organisms where individual strains that had their genomes sequenced, the number of protein-coding genes may again be inflated because of the presence of different plasmids. The organism that apparently has the most peptidase homologues is Bacillus cereus with 4,569, but many strains have been sequenced. This is also true of Escherichia coli (3,005 peptidase homologues), Pseudomonas fluorescens (1,979), and Streptococcus pneumoniae (1, 726) . Polyploidy also affects the number of protein coding genes, particularly in cultivated plants such as rice (2,292), grape (1,746), and soya (1,653). All of these organisms apparently have more peptidase homologues than human (1,599). The phyla in which organisms have fewest peptidase genes are Nanoarchaeota (15 peptidase homologues) and Tenericutes (18) . It can also be seen from Supplementary Table 2 that not all phyla have an example with a completely sequenced genome. For example, none have been completely sequenced from a moss animal (Bryozoa) or a comb jelly (Ctenophora). There are also phyla for which we know of no peptidase homologues, for example the phylum Chaetognatha, which contains the arrow worms.",

Hence there are many families of peptidases from viruses, and many families are known to share structural relationships indicating that many are related to one another even if this relationship is not detectable from comparison of the peptidase sequences alone. In most cases, a family of viral peptidases frequently contains only one family of viruses. Peptidase family S39 is an exception and contains sequences from four families of viruses. Viruses are not classified into taxa higher than order, but are known to have genomes that are single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) or double-stranded DNA (dsDNA). A virus with ssRNA encodes at least one polyprotein, which may contain peptidases within it required to cleave the polyprotein into individual proteins.

Urease and dihydroorotase are both divalent cation metallopeptidases, but beta-aspartyl dipeptidase is a monozinc metallopeptidase and its gene appears to have been the product of half a dihydroorotase gene [23] . The nature of dihydroorotase, which in some eukaryotes is derived from a fusion of genes encoding four different enzymatic components of the pyrimidine pathway (glutamine amidotransferase, carbamoyl phosphate synthase, aspartate carbamoyltransferase and dihydroorotase) [24] , has been used as a criterion for classifying eukaryotes into Bikonta (plants and chromists) and Unikonta (animals, fungi and some single-celled organisms) [25] . The glutamine amidotransferase domain is classified separately in MEROPS as a homologue in peptidase family C26. It might be expected that peptidases required for protein synthesis, such as signal peptidase 1, which is required for protein export, and methionyl aminopeptidase, which removes the initiating methionine from some cytoplasmic proteins, would be present in all organisms. However, surprisingly, signal peptidase is absent from most species of the classes Mollicutes (which includes Mycoplasma) and Pinopsida (which includes conifers). Homologues of family M24 (which includes methionyl aminopeptidase) are present in phyla from all kingdoms of life, but only in a fraction of chromists, and is absent from species of Cryptophyta. On balance, though, this might best be interpreted as a loss from Chromista, and that LUCA included both S26 and M24 homologues.",

On the assumption that homologues in peptidase families present in LUCA performed similar functions to modern proteins, then it is clear that LUCA was able to synthesize intracellular (processed by methionyl aminopeptidase) and secreted proteins (processed by signal peptidase). LUCA was able to obtain the amino acid raw materials for protein synthesis by both intracellular (peptidases from families C56, M3, M16, M48, S1, S8, S9, S16, S54 and T1) and extracellular proteolysis (peptidases from M1 and M20). LUCA had membrane-associated proteins, including multipass proteins (such as signal peptidase and peptidases from M48 and S54), type II membrane proteins (family M1) and proteins attached to the membrane via C-terminal lipid groups (as shown by the presence of peptidases from M48 and M79). LUCA also had a cell wall, because homologues from S12 process the precursors of the cell-wall cross-linking peptide. The presence of an S41 homologue suggests that LUCA was able to degrade abnormal proteins [27] . Bacterial peptidases in S1 and M48 are stimulated by heatshock and degrade abnormal proteins [28, 29] , suggesting that LUCA may have had a heat-shock response.",

It is now thought that the mitochondrion was derived from a Rickettsia-like bacterium [46] , and the plastid from a cyanobacterium [47] . Previously, it had been thought that some protozoa, known as Archezoa, were derived from a eukaryote ancestor from before the origin or these organelles [48] , however determination of the genome sequences has shown that this is not the case and archezoans have genes for mitochondrial proteins but have lost their mitochondria [49] . Therefore, the only evidence that a family of proteins has originated from a gene transfer from a proto-organelle to a eukaryote nucleus is the presence of homologues in bacteria and eukaryotes and absence from archaea.

It is surprising that homologues of C1 are not more widely spread in archaeans, because many archaeans live at an acidic pH at which C1 peptidases would be active, but homologues are found only in Euryarchaeota (with a single homologue in the nanoarchaeote Nst1), strongly suggestive of a horizontal gene transfer from either a bacterium or a eukaryote to an ancestral euryarchaeote. Family M17 is also found in Archaea, but most homologues are from species in the phylum Crenarchaeota, with only single homologues from Euryarchaeota, Nanoarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota, again indicative of horizontal gene transfers. There are many homologues from cyanobacteria and rickettsias for families M17, M41 and S14 implying an origin in eukaryotes via an endosymbiont; in addition, the eukaryote homologues of M41 include mitochondrial peptidases [50] and the plant homologues in M17 and S14 are in the chloroplast [51, 52] . The only C1 homologue from a rickettsia is a non-peptidase homologue from Candidatus Caedibacter acanthamoebae; there are a number of homologues from cyanobacteria, however. There are no homologues from cyanobacteria or rickettsias for family M18, and very few for family M13, so perhaps the genes originated in LUCA and were subsequently lost in an ancestral archaean.",

It has also been suggested that some genes occur in eukaryotes as a result of horizontal transfers from organelles such as the mitochondrion and the plastid which are derived from endosymbiont bacteria.
