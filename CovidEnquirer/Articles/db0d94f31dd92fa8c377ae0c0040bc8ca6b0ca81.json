Ideally, abdominocentesis should be performed following ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen to identify pockets of peritoneal fl uid. peritoneal fl uid is clear to yellowish with a total protein of less than 25 g/L and less than 5 \u00d7 10 9 WBC/L. \u2022 With intestinal compromise, fl uid color will change from clear to dark yellow, orange or reddish. Turbidity, total protein and white blood cell count will increase. \u2022 With enteritis, mild to moderate increases in total protein with lesser visual changes may occur. \u2022 If peritonitis is present, fl uid will be orange-red to milky, very turbid and possibly foul-smelling. Ingesta may be observed in foals eating a solid diet in which rupture of an abdominal viscus has occurred. It is critical that the clinical condition be taken in consideration when evaluating the results. Enterocentesis can occur, and should especially be considered in cases where the severity of disease is not consistent with severe septic peritonitis. \u2022 WCC >10,000 cells/\u03bcL, protein >3 g/dL indicate peritonitis. Serum to peritoneal fl uid glucose differences of >50 mg/dL are suggestive of peritonitis. Peritoneal fl uid glucose <30 mg/dL, pH <7.3 and fi brinogen concentration >200 mg/dL are indicative of peritonitis. \u2022 Identifi cation of intracellular bacteria and degenerate neutrophils on cytological analysis of peritoneal fl uid is consistent with peritonitis. \u2022 Iatrogenic blood contamination from body wall vessels or splenic puncture can result in abnormal red coloration of normal peritoneal fl uid. \u2022 Often, the color of fl uid will change during collection. Reddish samples can be centrifuged to differentiate iatrogenic contamination or acute hemorrhage from compromised intestinal viscera.",

Calculating energy requirements is not always straightforward as there are no values available specifi cally for neonatal foals. In addition the extra nutritional requirements of sick foals are unknown. The total energy requirement (TER) of a sick 50 kg foal is estimated to be 50-70 kcal/kg/day. One protocol for administration of PN is to start at 33% of TER for 24-48 hours, followed by an increase of 33% over a further 48 hours provided blood glucose measurements are within normal levels. In most cases only partial parenteral nutrition is required as many foals have recovered suffi ciently in a 3-5 day period to commence partial or complete enteral nutrition. Solutions for parenteral nutrition may be purchased commercially and various formulations are available. Two such commercial products are in Tables 4.2 and 4.3 and consist of: Baxter R solution for parenteral nutrition (2 L) \u2022 400 mL 20% lipid (provides 950 kcal) \u2022 800 mL 10% amino acids (provides 256 kcal) \u2022 800 mL 40% glucose (provides 1280 kcal) Given the energy requirements (50-70 kcal/kg/day) of a 50 kg foal the following amounts of this solution would be required for partial and total parenteral nutrition: requirements, total (TPN) or partial parenteral nutrition (PPN) is required. Parenteral nutrition is often avoided due to a perceived diffi culty of administration and expense. However, practitioners who use it frequently would testify to its ease of use and overall economic benefi ts as a result of shortened hospitalization periods. A \"home-made\" solution for partial parenteral nutrition can be compounded from 50% dextrose (1000 mL), 20% lipid (500 mL), and 10% amino acids (2000 mL). This solution is ideal for use in foals with enterocolitis. Dextrose is the cheapest component but providing all of the required calories with dextrose alone would result in an extremely hyperosmolar solution; the administration of which would likely result in phlebitis and glucose intolerance. It is important to remember that foals with severe protein-losing enteropathy are at increased risk for thrombophlebitis due to loss of antithrombin III and the administration of hyperosmolar solutions would increase the risk for developing phlebitis. Strict aseptic technique is required during preparation. Ideally laminar fl ow hoods should be used but if not available careful aseptic mixing may suffi ce. Dextrose and amino acids are mixed fi rst, followed by the lipid to minimize lipid demulsifi cation. A batch is split in half and divided between two separate sterile fl uid bags. The fi rst bag is used immediately and the second can be refrigerated for 24 hours.",
