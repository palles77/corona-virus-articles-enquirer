            "text": "N eonatal diarrhea is the most important cause of disease in calves worldwide, 1,2 leading to large economic losses to cattle herds. 3 Common etiologic agents involved in calf diarrhea include Escherichia coli, Cryptosporidium spp, bovine rotavirus (BRoV), and bovine coronavirus (BCoV). Most of the studies investigating the etiology of calf diarrhea have focused on sick calves. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] However, some agents, especially viruses, could be frequently detected in healthy calves. [9] [10] [11] For instance, BCoV has been identified in both healthy and diarrheic calves, 10, 11 complicating assessment of its role as a primary pathogen. BCoV is the causative agent of diarrhea in newborn calves, 12 winter dysentery in adult cows, 13 and respiratory tract illness in calves and adults. 14, 15 However, some studies have identified numerical but not statistical association between BCoV in fecal or nasal samples and clinical signs. [16] [17] [18] Cases of BCoV enteritis occur in both dairy and beef herds, with clinical signs developing between 5 and 30 days of life and a peak of incidence between days 7 and 10. 19 Transmission from calf-to-calf is mainly by the fecal-oral route but respiratory transmission can be possible. 16, 19 Infected calves can excrete high levels of virus within 48 h of experimental infection, and this can continue up to 14 days. 19 The mechanisms of diarrhea due to BCoV infection are still unclear, but malabsorption and hypersecretion appear to play important roles. 20 Clinically recovered calves can continue to shed low levels of virus for weeks. 21, 22 Diagnosis of BCoV enteritis can be achieved by viral culture, antigen-capture ELISA, hemagglutination assay using mouse erythrocytes, and PCR. 19 Recently, a pancoronavirus reverse transcription (RT) PCR assay (PanCoV-RT-PCR) was described to identify human CoV from samples of people with respiratory diseases, 23 with primers that should amplify a 251-bp fragment of the polymerase gene of all known coronaviruses. 24 The utility of PanCoV-RT-PCR to detect BCoV in samples of animals with clinical diseases is yet to be determined.",

BCoV was detected in 157/286 (55%) of calves; (Table 2) . Overall, diarrhea cases had higher odds of BCoV presence than the age-matched control animals, although the numerical estimates varied slightly between the estimates based on exact logistic regression and random intercept logistic regression (Table 3) . Sex was also associated with the presence of BCoV, with male calves at increased risk (Table 3) . Based on the nonsignificant interaction between BCoV and matching factors (age, farm, season, and year), the association of BCoV with diarrhea did not appear to vary according to age of the animals, season, and farm (Tables 3 and 5 , Figs 2 and 3) . In exact logistic regression, interaction of exposure with year of sampling was close to statistical significance and indicated that in year 2015, the effect of BCoV could have been different than in the other 2 years (Table 3 ). The effect of year in 2015 could not be identified as statistically significant in the random effect model for the year of 2015 (Fig 3) . The final model (exact logistic regression and random effect logistic regression) contained covariates for BCoV and sex. Their interaction was not statistically significant, and the coefficients for both BCoV and sex changed by very small quantity once both variables were in the model. This suggests that sex failed to act as confounder for the association between BCoV and diarrhea in this dataset (Table 3) .",

Thirteen out of 20 (65%) diarrheic calves from the same farm tested positive for CoV by PanCoV-RT-PCR assay. All of the samples that tested positive in the PanCoV-RT-PCR assay were also positive when screening by BCoV-RT-PCR assay, but three samples positive for BCoV in the BCoV-RT-PCR assay were negative on the PanCoV-RT-PCR assay ( Table 5) .

            "text": "The results of this study demonstrated a positive association between BCoV and diarrhea in dairy calves as detection rates of this agent were higher in diarrheic calves than in farm-, season-, aged-matched nondiarrheic calves. Similar results were found in one case-control study involving 380 calves. 25 However, studies including small numbers of calves (n < 100) identified numerical but not statistical association between BCoV in fecal or nasal samples and clinical signs. [16] [17] [18] Discrepancies between studies can be explained, at least in part, by differences in the source population, methodology, especially, the samples size used in the different investigations. 16, 25 Detection of BCoV, either in diarrheic and in nondiarrheic calves, was higher in comparison with previous studies from the same geographic area, 10, 26 other studies from different regions worldwide 6, 7, 25 and more in line with recent studies from Europe. 4 Earlier studies (1980 to 2007) investigating the presence of infectious agents in feces of healthy and diarrheic calves reported a prevalence of BCoV in healthy calves between 0 and 8.2% and in diarrheic calves between 3 and 40%. 10, 26 More recent studies (2008 to 2012) reported prevalence of BCoV in healthy calves of 7.4% and in diarrheic calves between 3.4 and 40%. 6, 7 Interestingly, a recent report from Europe identified a prevalence of BCoV of 79% of diarrheic calves; 4 however, this study failed to investigate healthy controls. The prevalence of Table 2 . infectious agents causing diarrhea in calves was previously investigated in dairy farms from Ontario at three different periods by ELISA assays, 1982 ELISA assays, , 26 1990 ELISA assays, -1991 and 1995-1997. 10 The overall prevalence of BCoV in the 1982's study was 5% (3/56), but this study did not discriminate the prevalence of healthy and diarrheic calves. 26 In the 1992 study, the prevalence of BCoV in diarrheic calves was 17% (54/312), whereas in 1998, the overall prevalence was 10% (16/161), and BCoV was detected in 13% (15/118) and 2.3% (1/43) of diarrheic and healthy calves, respectively. The reasons for these differences in the detection rates of BCoV in calves (healthy and diarrheic) between this study and previous investigations in the same geographic area (Ontario) are unclear. In fact, it is difficult to discern whether the increasing detection of BCoV reflects a true rise in prevalence in the course of time or whether it is due to simply to the better detection rate. 28 The differences between studies could be explained, at least in part, by changes in farm management practices overtime (e.g., calf population density, antimicrobial drug use, and management/agricultural practices), differences in the type of assay used for detection of BCoV, and the emergence or re-emergence of BCoV strains over the years.",

            "text": "Differences in the type of assay used for detection of BCoV (e.g., ELISA vs. RT-PCR) also can explain differences in the detection rates of BCoV between studies. One study investigating the rates of BCoV fecal shedding in diarrheic calves found a detection rate of BCoV of 53% when using ELISA and 96% when using RT-PCR 16 suggesting that RT-PCR was a more sensitive method. These results were further confirmed by one study reporting that the sensitivity and specificity of some ELISA assays were lower compared with quantitative RT-PCR when both tests were used to identify the presence of BCoV in feces of diarrheic calves. 32 Furthermore, more sensitive diagnostic assays also could contribute to detect lower levels of BCoV that cannot be detected by other methods. 32 An alternative explanation for the changes in detection rates of BCoV in healthy and diarrheic calves over the years in dairy farms from Ontario could be the emerging and re-emerging of BCoV strains. Similar to other RNA viruses, CoVs are believed to mutate frequently that could result in altered antigenicity and pathogenicity of new strains. 33, 34 During the past decades, several CoVs have caused serious problems in humans and animals (e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, SARS-CoV; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, MERS-CoV, and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, PEDV). 35 Emerging outbreaks associated with CoV also have been documented in horses worldwide, 36 and emerging canine CoV variants have been associated with systemic infections in the European Union. 37 In an Oklahoma study, a new CoV belonging to a BCoV clade 2 was isolated from nasal secretion and lung fluids of postweaned healthy beef calves and calves with respiratory disease. 38 This new field isolate was antigenically and genetically different to previously isolated BCoV strains including those from neonatal diarrhea, reference strains, and the strain in the current modified live vaccine BCoV licence in United States that belong to CoV clade 1. 38 Similar results have been reported in Europe 4 and Asia. 39 In 2012, the BCoV clade 2 strain was recovered from postweaned calves (6-7 months) suffering of severe enteritis with bloody diarrhea; the authors of that study suggested that this clinical syndrome caused by BCoV clade 2 should be added to the already known syndromes caused by BCoV. 40 The results of these studies suggest that current BCoV strains circulating in worldwide are diverging from the prototype BCoV isolated in earlier studies and used in vaccines. 38 This can result in the emergency of new clinical syndromes, 40 outbreaks of enteric diseases with higher morbidity and case fatality (similar to the one described in this study), increased detection rates of BCoV in nasal and fecal samples of healthy and ill calves, 4, 18, 41 and the lack of efficacy vaccination protocols. 42 Future studies should focus on investigating the biological, antigenical, and genomical characteristic of BCoV circulating in Canada. It is important to highlight that in this study no other virus, parasites, and bacterial agents were investigated, and the role of BCoV in association with multiple pathogens was not determined which prevent us to clearly identify the role of BCoV as a primary cause of disease or as a agent associated with coinfection.",

Currently, viral culture is the gold standard for laboratory diagnosis of viral gastrointestinal disorders; however, detection of coronavirus by culture isolation or serological methods can be difficult. 23 To overcome this issue and obtain rapid diagnostic results, several sensitive molecular assays for detection of CoV have been developed, including RT-PCR, nested RT-PCR, and real-time RT-PCR. Recently, a novel PanCoV-RT-PCR assay was designed to allow detection of all known CoV based on an alignment of conserved genome regions of several coronavirus. 43 These results showed a good level of agreement between BCoV-RT-PCR and the novel Pan-CoV-RT-PCR assays indicating that PanCoV-RT-PCR can be a rapid tool to detect BCoV in samples from cattle. Future studies with a larger sample size are required to corroborate these findings.",
