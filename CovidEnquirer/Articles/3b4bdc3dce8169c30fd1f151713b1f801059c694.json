These proteins play vital roles in various cellular processes, including DNA replication, transcription, regulation of gene expression, packaging, and other activities associated with DNA [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . It is therefore substantially important to distinguish DNA-BPs from non-DNA-binding proteins (NBPs). In the past, many experimental and computational techniques have been developed for identifying DNA-BPs. Experimental techniques can provide a clear-cut answer to a query protein. However, the experimental methods are cost-intensive and time-consuming, and thus impractical for large datasets [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Computational methods can be broadly divided into two categories: structure-based method and sequence-based *Address correspondence to this author at the School of Mathematics and Statistics, Hainan Normal University, Haikou 571158, China; Tel: +86-898-65883210; E-mail: lichwun@163.com method. The former can discriminate DNA-binding and nonbinding proteins with high accuracy, but these methods can't be employed in high throughput annotation, as they require the structure information of a query protein [1] . Though tremendous progress has been achieved in experimental determination of protein structures in the past five decades, it can't keep pace with the explosive growth of sequence information resulting from modern sequencing technology [8] . Yet as suggested by Anfinsen [9] , proteins contain within their amino acid sequences enough information to determine their native conformation. Therefore, it is more promising to use sequence-based methods to identify DNA-BPs.",

            "text": "One of the core issues to the sequence-based methods is how to characterize protein sequences and harvest the fruits hidden in them. The most typical approach is using the amino acid composition (AAC) to formulate a protein sequence. Owing to its simplicity, the AAC model was widely applied in a number of earlier statistic-based methods. However, as pointed out in Ref [6] , if we denote by the counts of 20 standard amino acids in a protein sequence, then we can see that there are a total of different sequences/strings possessing the same AAC. The reason is that AAC model neglects the order relation among elements of a sequence. To overcome this drawback, the concept of pseudo amino acid composition (PseAAC, or Chou's PseAAC) was proposed [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . The essence of PseAAC is that it not only covers AAC, but also contains additional order-correlated factors along a protein sequence. Another popular way for sequence analysis is to convert the protein primary sequence over 20 amino acids into a reduced one. The earliest and simplest reduction was the well-known HP model, in which 20 standard amino acids are divided into two types, hydrophobic (H) (or non-polar) and polar (P) (or hydrophilic). On the basis of the classic model, a detailed HP model was introduced by dividing the polar class into three subclasses: positive polar, uncharged polar and negative polar [19] . In addition, a few five-group classifications of amino acids were presented for practical purposes [20] [21] [22] [23] . By considering property-based triples, Li et al. [6] put forward a six-letter model of amino acids. Also based on three physical-chemical properties of amino acids, Yao et al. [24] mapped the 20 standard amino acids to eight vertices of a cube with the center of origin, and thus an eightgroup model of amino acids is obtained.",

We summarize the main work of this paper as follows: In section 2, we briefly introduce five datasets used in this study. In section 3, on the basis of two important physicochemical properties of amino acids, we cluster the 20 standard amino acids into three groups. By assigning to each group a representative symbol, we transform a protein sequence into a three-letter sequence. Then a 2-D graph without loops and multiple edges and its geometric line adjacency matrix are obtained. A sequence-derived feature vector of dimension (25+ ) is thus constructed to characterize a protein sequence. Our scheme is similar to, but obviously different from that of PseAAC. In section 4, we apply the presented feature vector to compare -globin proteins of 17 species and 72 spike proteins of coronaviruses respectively. Also, we develop a SVM (support vector machine) model using the generalized PseAAC to identify DNA-binding and non-binding proteins on three datasets. Experiment results show that the presented method outperforms the existing methods including DNAbinder [1] , DNA-Prot [2] , iDNA-Prot [3] and enDNA-Prot [4] . Finally, conclusions are given in section 5.",

Observing Fig. (4) , we find that the 72 coronavirus spike proteins are clustered into three groups: one contains the five alpha coronaviruses (PEDVC, PEDV, TGEVG, TGEV, and HCoV-229E), the second includes the three gamma coronaviruses (IBV, IBVBJ, IBVC), and the third corresponds to the group beta. A closer look at the subtree of beta coronaviruses shows that MERS-CoVs are clearly clustered together, so it is with SARS-CoVs, while MHV, MHVA, MHVM, MHVP, MHVJHM, BCoV, BCoVE, BCoVL, BCoVM, BCoVQ and HCoV-OC43 are situated at an independent branch. The resulting cluster agrees well with the established taxonomic groups. ",

Among them, DNASet and DNAeSet serve as training datasets, while DNAiSet serves as an independent testing dataset. Support vector machine (SVM) is employed as the classifier, and R package 'e1071' v1.6-8 [44] is used to implement SVM. For a given set of binary-labeled training examples, SVM maps the input space into a higherdimensional space and seeks a hyperplane to separate the positive samples from the negative ones [25] . The optimal hyperplane maximizes the separation margin between the two classes of training data. The distance measurement between the data points in the high-dimensional space is defined by the kernel function. In this study, we use the radial basis function (RBF) kernel . This model involves two tunable parameters: the kernel width and the penalty parameter C. Prediction performance can be assessed using some quality indices including Accuracy (ACC), Sensitivity (Se), Specificity (Sp), Fmeasure (F1M) and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) [2, 4, 5, 25, 37, 45] :",

DNAbinder developed by Kumar et al. [1] can extract evolutionary information in form of position specific scoring matrix (PSSM) from the corresponding protein sequence. PSSM-21 and PSSM-400 are two feature vectors generated by means of PSSM, whose dimensions are 21 and 400, respectively. In [1] , PSSM-400 based SVM model was mainly used for predicting DNA-BPs. DNA-Prot [2] is a Random Forest based method, in which the feature vector includes sequence information and structure information, such as the composition of 20 standard amino acids, composition of 10 amino acid groups, and secondary structure information predicted from a protein sequence. iDNA-Prot [3] constructs the feature vector via the grey model, and Random Forest is also used as the operation engine. EnDNA-Prot [4] is a predictor which encodes a protein sequence into a feature vector with dimension of 188 and adopts an ensemble classifier constructed with four types of machine learning classifiers. All these methods are tested on the same datasets to make an unbiased comparison with our method. Observing Table 6 , we can see that the current approach outperforms other methods by 3.29-10.44% in terms of ACC, 0.056-0.206 in terms of MCC, and 1. .76% in terms of F1M.

[4] created a dataset called expanded benchmark dataset1100 with all the 146 positive samples and 1100 negative samples in DNAeSet, which is employed as another training dataset to evaluate the predictive performance on the independent dataset DNAiSet. For convenience of comparison, we also select the expanded benchmark dataset to establish the classifier and test it on DNAiSet. Repeating this procedure five times, the average results are given in Table 7 (the first row). Results obtained by the other four methods (DNAbinder, DNA-Prot, iDNA-Prot and enDNA-Prot) trained on the expanded benchmark dataset with n=1100 are also listed in Table 7 . From this table we see that the overall accuracy of our method is about 92%, with MCC of 0.84 and F1M of 91.24%, which outperforms other methods with improvement in the range of 2.49-19.12% in terms of ACC, 0.05-0.32 in terms of MCC, and 3.82-33.85% in terms of F1M. This suggests that our method performs well on unbalanced datasets. ",

By replacing each amino acid with its representative letter, a protein primary sequence was converted into a three-letter sequence, which can be viewed as a coarse-grained description of the protein primary sequence. On the basis of the three-letter sequence, a graph without loops and multiple edges was obtained. By taking the advantage of the 2-D graph, we constructed a geometric line adjacency matrix (GLAM) and then the corresponding ALE-index, the lineadjacency index, the first Zagreb index and its modification were calculated. In addition, order-correlated factors were extracted via the reduced sequence. By combining these elements with the frequencies of occurrence of 20 standard amino acids and their three representative letters, a generalized PseAAC model of a protein sequence was constructed. On five popular datasets, the proposed method was tested by phylogenetic analysis and identification of DNA-binding proteins. The results illustrated the better performance of our method. ",
