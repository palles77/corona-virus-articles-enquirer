            "text": "Although efficient methods exist to assemble synthetic oligonucleotides into genes and genomes, these suffer from the presence of 1-3 random errors/kb of DNA. Here, we introduce a new method termed consensus shuffling and demonstrate its use to significantly reduce random errors in synthetic DNA. In this method, errors are revealed as mismatches by re-hybridization of the population. The DNA is fragmented, and mismatched fragments are removed upon binding to an immobilized mismatch binding protein (MutS). PCR assembly of the remaining fragments yields a new population of full-length sequences enriched for the consensus sequence of the input population. We show that two iterations of consensus shuffling improved a population of synthetic green fluorescent protein (GFPuv ) clones from $60 to .90% fluorescent, and decreased errors 3.5to 4.3-fold to final values of $1 error per 3500 bp. In addition, two iterations of consensus shuffling corrected a population of GFPuv clones where all members were non-functional, to a population where 82% of clones were fluorescent. Consensus shuffling should facilitate the rapid and accurate synthesis of long DNA sequences.",

These technological advances have helped spur the formation of the new field of synthetic biology (8) , which aims at defining the functional units of living organisms through the modular engineering of synthetic organisms. In addition, the demand for fully synthetic gene length DNA fragments of defined sequence has dramatically increased in recent years for use in applications such as codon optimization (9), construction of DNA vaccines (10) , de novo synthesis of novel biopolymers (11) , or simply to gain access to known DNA sequences when original templates are unavailable.

The deleterious impact of these errors becomes more significant as the desired lengths of synthetic DNA increase. Indeed, in the remarkable assembly of the PhiX 174 bacteriophage genome (5386 bp) using gel-purified, synthetic oligonucleotides, the products contained an average of $2 lethal errors/kb resulting in 1 plaque-forming genomes per 20 000 clones (7) . A functional selection (plaque formation) was required in this study to identify a clone with the correct sequence. Thus, error reduction/correction is a requirement for the efficient production of long synthetic DNA of defined sequence. However, the process of sequencing multiple clones and manual correction of errors is both costly and time consuming.",

            "text": "Several methods have been reported for the removal of error-containing sequences in populations of DNA. These methods rely upon the selective destruction (14, 15) or physical separation (16, 17) of mismatch-containing heteroduplexes. Smith and Modrich (14) reported the selective destruction of error-containing sequences in PCR products by generating dsDNA breaks upon overdigestion with the Escherichia coli mismatch-specific endonuclease MutHLS (18) . Gel purification and cloning of the remaining full-length DNA resulted in an apparent 10-fold reduction in the error rate for PCR products. However, the existing approaches are not well suited for error removal in long synthetic DNA sequences where virtually all members in the population contain multiple errors.

For commercial re-use, please contact journals.permissions@oupjournals.org Error correction with MutS is outlined in Figure 1 . The population of DNA molecules containing random errors is first re-hybridized to expose synthesis errors as mismatches ( Figure 1A ). Duplexes containing mismatches can then be removed from the population by affinity capture with immobilized MutS ( Figure 1B) , a process we term coincidence filtering, since both strands of the duplex must match to pass this filtering step. For long synthetic DNA sequences or for sequences with high error rates, coincidence filtering is ineffective, since the likelihood of both strands being perfectly matched after re-hybridization is very low. To generalize MutS error filtering for application on synthetic DNA, the synthetic DNA is cleaved into small overlapping fragments before MutS filtering. Fragments containing mismatches are selectively removed through absorption to an immobilized maltose-binding protein (MBP)-Thermus aquaticus (Taq) MutS-His 6 fusion protein (MBP-MutS-H6) (18) (19) (20) . The remaining mixture of fragments (enriched with fragments of the correct sequence) serves as a template for assembly PCR to produce the full-length product ( Figure 1C ). This process can be iterated until the consensus sequence emerges as the dominant species in the population. This approach is equivalent to DNA shuffling (21) with additional mismatch exposure and removal steps.",

Indeed, with consensus shuffling, it is possible to start with a population of DNA molecules wherein every individual in the population contains errors and create a new population where the dominant sequence is error free. To demonstrate this, 10 nonfluorescent GFPuv clones, each containing a deletion mutation (Figure 4) , were pooled and subjected to either DNA shuffling alone or two iterations of consensus shuffling. Products were cloned in E.coli, and the percentage of fluorescent colonies was monitored as an indication of progress toward the consensus sequence. DNA shuffling alone (no MBP-MutS-H6) increased the percentage of fluorescent colonies to 30% (387 colonies total) similar to a previous report (26) . Two rounds of consensus shuffling gave a new population that was 82% fluorescent (551 colonies total), indicating that the dominant species was likely the consensus sequence of the input population.",

In both cases, two iterations of either consensus shuffling or coincidence filtering increased fluorescent colonies from average values of $60 to >90%. Sequencing data from two independent experiments showed a 4.3-and 3.5-fold reduction in the error rate for the consensus shuffled populations compared with the input populations giving final error rates of 0.3 and 0.28 errors/kb, respectively. These results demonstrate the usefulness of the MBP-MutS-H6 error filter in both consensus shuffling and coincidence filtering protocols. Taq MutS has previously been shown to bind to deletion mutations with high affinity (27) , a mutation common in synthetic DNA. However, it is important to note that Taq MutS has lower affinity for specific point mutations and binds weakly to homoduplex DNA (27) . These factors may limit the stepwise efficiency of the error filter. Moreover, specific point mutations may be refractory to removal even after multiple rounds of consensus shuffling. Two rounds of consensus shuffling using the MBP-MutS-H6 error filter proved most effective in reducing deletions and G/C to A/T transitions, consistent with previous reports for the selectivity of Taq MutS (27) . However, it must be emphasized that each synthetic oligonucleotide point mutation would generate two heteroduplex DNA molecules containing unique mismatches after PCR amplification and re-hybridization ( Figure 1A and Table 1 ). For example, a G to A transition mutation in a synthetic oligonucleotide would generate heteroduplexes with G-T or A-C mismatches after PCR amplification and re-hybridization. For consensus shuffling, either of these mismatch containing heteroduplexes could evade precipitation by the MBP-MutS-H6 error filter and participate in the reassembly of full-length GFPuv. Therefore, Table 1 lists the pair of mismatches that could give rise to the observed transition or transversion mutation. These results show that the MBP-MutS-H6 error filter was most effective at removing insertion/deletion loops and G-T/A-C mismatches from the population.",

            "text": "It should be possible to generalize the consensus shuffling protocol to a large number of synthetic DNA constructs. GFPuv was chosen as the synthetic construct in this study for its advantages as a fluorescent reporter gene. This allowed easy optimization of our protocol without the need to sequence thousands of base pairs of DNA. We expect the results reported here for consensus shuffling to readily translate to synthetic DNA constructs of varied sequence, greater overall length and/ or higher initial errors/kb. Synthetic DNA constructs of varied sequence can be digested into a defined set of fragments using Type II restriction enzymes or fragmented into any desired size range using controlled DNase I digestion (26) . Digestion and reassembly of a large number of different genes is expected to be as robust as the protocol of DNA shuffling (28) , which has been broadly applied to a variety of gene sequences. Synthetic DNA constructs larger than GFPuv are expected to be amenable to error correction by consensus shuffling, as the error filtering is conducted on gene fragments before reassembly of the full-length gene. Thus, the errors/kb data presented in this study are expected to translate to larger genes with similar initial errors/kb (excepting mutations introduced by PCR amplification following the final application of the error filter). Synthetic DNA constructs of higher initial errors/kb are expected to be amenable for error correction by consensus shuffling. However, these constructs will require digestion into smaller sized gene fragments that may affect the efficiency of error correction. In contrast to consensus shuffling, an increase in the size of the synthetic DNA product or an increase in errors/kb would preclude the use of the coincidence filtering protocol, as every molecule in the population would contain one or more errors. As proof of the utility of the consensus shuffling protocol, 10 non-fluorescent GFPuv clones containing one or more errors (Figure 4 ) were converted into a population where 82% of the clones were fluorescent. It is important to note that DNA shuffling alone shows an improvement in percent fluorescent colonies in this example (from 0 to 30%). For synthetic DNA populations, DNA shuffling alone shows no improvement in percent fluorescent colonies (see Figure 3 'no MutS' treatments). DNA shuffling alone improves the overall number of correct sequences only for small DNA populations with low error rates. For example, when shuffling 10 clones with a unique mutation in each clone, one would expect the fraction of correct products to be (9/10) 10 = 35% (26), very close to the value of 30% that we observed. A mathematical model describing the error rates for shuffling and error filtering of synthetic DNA populations is presented below.",

An input population of dsDNA molecules of length N, containing E errors/base is re-hybridized, fragmented into shorter dsDNA fragments of average length S, error filtered and reassembled. P(F) is the probability a fragment of length S will have a correct sequence. We determine the probability that re-hybridized duplexes will have zero (C), one (H ) or both (I ) strands with errors.",

Figure 5 shows some predictions that emerge from this model assuming typical length (2 kb), fragment sizes (200 bp) and error rates (1.8 errors/kb). Consensus shuffling is predicted to be most effective with smaller fragment sizes ( Figure 5A ). As mentioned above, smaller fragment sizes could be obtained by controlled digestion with DNase I (21) . In addition, multiple iterations of MutS filtering can have dramatic results on populations with few correct sequences ( Figure 5B ), although the model does not account for the differing specificity of MutS toward the various types of mismatches. The model also predicts that even modest improvements in the MutS selectivity factor through optimization of the MutS-DNA binding conditions and/or the use of a combination of MutS homologs with varying mismatch specificity (29) could dramatically improve the consensus shuffling protocol ( Figure 5C ). Coincidence filtering (N = S) is predicted to be effective for populations with low error rates per clone ( Figure 5D ) but becomes ineffective when the majority of re-hybridized duplexes contain mismatches.",

Consensus shuffling should be generally applicable for error correction on synthetic genes of typical lengths and error rates. Two iterations of consensus shuffling ($6 h/iteration) generated a population with $1 error/3500 bp. This reduction in error rate will allow the identification of a correct clone after sequencing DNA from a reduced number of colonies. Coincidence filtering is a simple and effective procedure to reduce errors in synthetic DNA populations with low error rates per clone. These methods should significantly increase the speed and decrease the cost of production of synthetic genes.",
