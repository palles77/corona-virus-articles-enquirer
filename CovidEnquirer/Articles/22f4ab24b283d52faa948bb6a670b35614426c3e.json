Bismuth subsalicylate is commonly used in foals with rotaviral diarrhea. Its antidiarrheal action is through stimulation of fluid and electrolyte absorption and by inhibiting the synthesis of prostaglandins. Bismuth subsalicylate also binds bacterial toxins and is thought to have a bactericidal action. Antibiotics are not indicated unless the foal is less than 2 weeksof age. Affected foals should be isolated if possible because the disease is highly contagious among young foals. Phenol-based disinfectants should be used as footbaths and for environmental decontamination. A maternal vaccine is available and may confer modest protection.",

Previously, foals with immune dysfunction, such as scm Arabian foals, were considered to be at greatest risk. It is unlikely that coronavirus infection is responsible for outbreaks of diarrhea. Both published and nonpublished reports of parvovirus and Breda virus causing diarrhea in foals exist. A cute abdominal disease in the foal is a common problem with a myriad of potential causes and presentations. The foal may appear healthy and show signs of mild abdominal discomfort, or it may experience extreme pain and exhibit signs of endotoxic and hypovolemic shock. Resuscitation should be started immediately for the critical foal before or concurrently with diagnostic testing. A colicky foal is more difficult to evaluate than an adult horse; foals are less tolerant of abdominal pain, and the degree of pain exhibited does not necessarily correlate with the severity of the abdominal lesion. Although rectal palpation cannot be used, abdominal radiography and ultrasonography are very useful tools for evaluating foals with colic. A tentative diagnosis often can be obtained from a thorough history and physical examination. Diagnostic tests-such as venous blood gases, complete blood count (CBC), serum chemistry pro-file, serum IgG, nasogastric intubation, peritoneal paracentesis, abdominal radiography and ultrasonography, and gastroscopy and duodenoscopy-can provide additional information. Treatment ranges from careful monitoring and medical therapy to surgical intervention.",

Signs of poor perfusion include increased capillary refill time (>2 seconds); cold ears, muzzle, and extremities; and elevated heart rate. The presence of sunken eyes and dry, sticky mucus membranes is evidence of moderate to severe dehydration. An elevated temperature (> 102\u00b0F) may indicate an infectious cause of the colic episode, such as bacterial or viral enteritis. Hypothermia is rare but often indicates poor perfusion, hypoglycemia, or hypodynamic shock. Thoracic auscultation should be performed on the right and left sides of the thorax to evaluate the heart and lungs. Mean heart rate is 100 beats per minute during the first 30 days of life and decreases to 60 to 70 beats per minute by 2 to 3 months. Elevated heart rate may occur in response to pain, excitement, hypovolemia, or endotoxemia. Bradycardia is rare but may occur in foals with uroabdomen, if they are hyperkalemic (serum [K+J >5.5 mEq/dl). These foals are also prone to cardiac arrhythmias. Cardiac murmurs may be normal in foals up to 3 to 5 days of age and are usually caused by blood flow through a patent ductus arteriosus. Fever and anemia can also produce cardiac murmurs. The lungs should be auscuIted on the right and left sides and over the trachea.

If the foal is sodium-or chloride-deficient-as occurs with enteritis and uroabdomen-0.9% NaCI is a good choice. For resuscitation purposes, any isotonic crystalloid fluid is appropriate. Fluid rate depends on the goal of therapy. Foals with clinical signs of shock should rapidly receive a shock-dose (40 ml/Ib or 90 ml/kg) of prewarmed fluids. Rapid administration of fluids may induce diuresis before saturating the interstitial space; however, this event is inconsequential in treating a foal in hypovolemic shock. Overhydration is not a clinical problem if the heart and kidneys are functioning appropriately and if the foal is not exhibiting signs of severe pulmonary compromise. If the foal is dehydrated, the volume deficit can be estimated by multiplying the foal's weight in kilogram by the percentage of dehydration. The fluid deficit can then be adminis-tered as a fluid bolus or administered over several hours in addition to the current fluid requirements. The maintenance fluid requirement of a neonatal foal (3-5 ml/kg/hour) is higher than that of an adult and gradually returns to adult values over the first 30 days of life.",

In foals less than 1 month old, intravenous administration of diazepam (0.1 mg/kg) will cause sufficient sedation and recumbency for radiographs and minor procedures. However, it provides no analgesia. If analgesia is needed, butorphanol (0.1-0.2 mg/kg, IV) can be given and will enhance the sedative properties of the diazepam. Xylazine (0.2-0.3 mg/kg, IV or 1M) provides analgesia and sedation but produces cardiorespiratory depression. Flunixin meglumine (0.5 mg/kg, qI2-24h) is a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug that provides excellent visceral analgesia. If gastric ulceration is suspected, administration of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications should be avoided.",

The degree of pain is not always helpful in this determination because foals can be in extreme pain with medical diseases such as enterocolitis. However, if the pain is persistent and/or recurs after analgesic medication and medical intervention such as gastric decompression, abdominal exploratory surgery is warranted. Foals with tightly distended small intestine, which indicates mechanical obstruction, are surgical candidates. The presence of nasogastric reflux, abnormal peritoneal fluid, or increasing abdominal distention warrants surgical exploration if the clinical signs cannot be attributed to enteritis. Most meconium impactions will respond to soapy water or acetyl cysteine enemas, oral and intravenous fluid therapy, and small amounts of oral mineral oil. However, if the cardiovascular status of the foal deteriorates and the pain and abdominal distention persist, surgery is indicated.",

The history of infectious disease on the farm, presence of fever, and abnormal CBC can be helpful but not always diagnostic. Foalshave an increased risk of abdominal adhesion formation; consequently, the decision to perform an exploratory celiotomy should only be made after careful evaluation and assessment of diagnostic findings and response to medical therapy. The percentage of foals that survive for long periods after abdominal surgery is less than that of adults in the same situation. However, delaying surgery in foals with surgical lesions can decrease survival as well. Time from diagnosis to surgical correction of strangulating intestinal obstruction significantly affected survival in these foals. Retrospective information indicates that 19% of foals with strangulating abdominal lesions corrected surgically survived more than 2 years, whereas 69% of foals with nonstrangulating lesions survived more than 2 years. Age significantly affected outcome after abdominal surgery in foals. Only 10% of foals less than 14 days old survived after abdominal surgery, whereas 46% of foals between 15 and 150 days old survived-probably because of the large percentage of congenital, nontreatable, abdominal lesions that cause acute abdominal disease in foals less than 2 weeks old.",
