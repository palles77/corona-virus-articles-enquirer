The additional tests for the discrepant results were conducted by repeat RV assay or monoplex PCR coupled direct sequencing. Data analysis using percent agreement, kappa, and prevalence-adjusted and bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK) values was performed for comparisons among the three RV assays.

The overall agreement, kappa, and PABAK values for the three assays ranged between 97%-98%, 0.76-0.86, and 0.93-0.96 respectively.

Moreover, the end-user in clinical laboratories selecting the multiplexed RT-PCR for RV will need to consider the benefits of each assay in terms of both performance and user-friendliness.",

After cDNA synthesis, the 16 target viruses were multiplexed into two tubes according to target primer and probe. Multiplex real-time PCR was conducted in a 20 \u03bcL mixture containing 8 \u03bcL of cDNA, 5 \u03bcL of 4X TOCE Oligo Mix primer, 5 \u03bcL of 4X PCR master mix, and 2 \u03bcL of RNase-free water with the CFX96 Real-time PCR detection system (Bio-rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The thermal cycling conditions were: 50\u00b0C for 4 minutes; denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 15 minutes followed by 50 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 seconds, 60\u00b0C for 1 minutes and 72\u00b0C for 30 seconds. During the interval of the 50 cycles, melting temperature analysis was conducted by cooling the mixture to 55\u00b0C and maintaining for 15 seconds followed by heating the mixture from 55\u00b0C to 85\u00b0C (0.5\u00b0C/5 seconds) after 30, 40, and 50 cycles respectively. The fluorescence was continually detected during heating process and the data were converted to derive the melting temperature by plotting the negative derivative of fluorescence vs temperature (\u2212 dF/dT against T). Seegene viewer software can automatically interpret melting peaks derived and present the results as '+, ++, and +++ positive' according to detection cycles of melting temperature analysis or 'negative.' Bacteriophage MS2 as an Internal Control (IC) was added to clinical specimens before nucleic acid extraction and was incorporated into the product as an exogenous whole process control in order to monitor during the period of time between nucleic acid isolation to result interpretation. The IC was co-amplified with the target nucleic acids within the clinical specimens. The AD assay performs both reverse-transcription(RT) reaction with the extracted RNA from specimen and multiplex PCR reaction simultaneously in a single tube (1-step RT-PCR). It uses human RNase P gene, as an internal control, to give information for validity of the RNA extraction procedure and to prevent misjudgment from sampling error and RT-PCR reaction error. Briefly, the assay was multiplexed into five tubes targeting 14 RVs and an IC gene. This was conducted in a 20 \u03bcL mixture containing 5 \u03bcL of nucleic acid, 5 \u03bcL of primer/probe mixture and 10 \u03bcL of RT-PCR premix with the SLAN Real-time PCR detection system (Shanghai Hongshi Medical Technology Co., Shanghai, China).

RSV between AP vs AD and RQ show a low kappa value; however, PABAK for RSV did not show a sharp increase as seen with PIV because of the number of discrepant results between three assays.In real circumstances of a clinical laboratory, the introduction of multiplex RT-PCR assay for detection of RV was considered based",

Further evaluation of performance between assay with regard to influenza A subtype is needed.There were some limitations to this study. First, this study used samples from only young adults for a winter season. Thus, we could not obtain adequate samples per target virus, such as PIV type 1-4, CoV 229E, OC43 and NL63, and RSV A. Those viruses could not be subjected to measure agreement values for each target due to low numbers. Second, another limitation was the use of stored frozen sam-",
