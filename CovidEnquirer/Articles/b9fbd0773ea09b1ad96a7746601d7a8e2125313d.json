The strain, designated YN, was genetically and pathologically characterized. Phylogenetic analysis showed that YN and most of the previously characterized IBV isolates found in China were phylogenetically classifi ed into 2 main genetic clusters. The YN isolate caused severe lesions and resulted in deaths of 65% in experimental infections of 30-day-old specifi c-pathogen-free chickens. Tracheal and severe kidney lesions developed in all infected birds, confi rming the ability of YN strain to induce both respiratory and renal disease. IBV antigens were detected by immunohistochemical analysis in the trachea, lung, kidney, and bursa, consistent with histopathologic observations, virus isolation, and reverse transcription PCR detection. We showed that YN IBV exhibits severe pathogenicity in chickens, and that similar viruses are prevalent in China.",

However, IB continues to cause economic losses in the poultry industry despite intensive vaccination programs in many countries (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) . Outbreaks of IB often are due to infections with strains serologically different from those used for vaccination (2, 6) . Since IBV was fi rst described in 1931, a large number of serotypes or variants have emerged, and some have become endemic worldwide (4, (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . That little or no cross-protection occurs between different serotypes of IBV is well known (13) . Therefore, continuous determination of the epidemic serotype and production of new generations of vaccines are crucial for controlling IB in each geographic region or country.",

            "text": "IBV infection leads to severe economic losses in the poultry industry because of poor weight gain and feeding effi ciency in broilers or reduced egg production and egg quality in laying birds. Death rates are often low (<30%) unless secondary bacterial infections cause increased deaths of birds (21, 22) . Evaluation of the pathogenicity of IBV was based on several criteria, including: clinical signs, gross pathologic lesions, histopathologic changes, and tissue tropism. In this study, a China IBV strain isolated from a 30-day-old vaccinated broiler fl ock that had a history of respiratory signs, severe renal disease, and higher than expected mortality rate was analyzed by clinical observation, histopathologic examination, RT-PCR, virus isolation, and immunohistochemistry. Analyses revealed that the YN strain induced severe pathogenicity in 30-day-old SPF chickens with a 65% death rate and substantial kidney lesions. Sequence analysis of the S1 gene of YN isolate showed high nucleotide similarities to CQ04-1 (99.5% nt and 98.8% aa identities) and SC021202 (99.3% nt and 98.6% aa identities). Phylogenetic analysis further indicated that at least 3 distinct genetic clusters of IBV were present in chicken fl ocks in China, named A2-like, LSD-like, and M41-like strains. Most China IBV fi eld isolates belonged to the same genetic cluster (A2-like), but the serotypes of these prevalent IBV strains differed from those of the currently used vaccine strains in China (M41-like, e.g., H120, Ma5, 28/86, and W93), which are considered the main cause of disease outbreaks (5, (15) (16) (17) . An attenuated or inactivated vaccine that matches with pandemic strains is urgently needed in China to control IBV infection.",
