Xf can be detected directly on plant macerate using 16 molecular methods such as real-time PCR, which is a sensitive technique. However, some 17 plants may contain components that can act as PCR reaction inhibitors, which can lead to false 18 negative results or an underestimation of the bacterial concentration present in the analyzed 19 plant sample. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) is an innovative tool based on the partitioning of 20 the PCR reagents and the DNA sample into thousands of droplets, allowing the quantification 21 of the absolute number of target DNA molecules present in a reaction mixture, or an increase 22 of the detection sensitivity. In this study, a real-time PCR protocol, already used for Xf detection 23 in the framework of official surveys in the European Union, was transferred and optimized for 24",

            "text": "Real-time PCR and ddPCR technology provided equivalent limits of detection for Xf in the 321 following matrices: O. europaea, P. myrtifolia and R. officinalis (Table 1, Table 3 ). The ddPCR 322 technology presented a slightly higher limit of detection of 0.5 log for L. angustifolia. However, 323 a decrease in the limit of detection for Xf of 0.5 log for Q. ilex and the bacterial suspension 324 wereobserved. In the conditions of DNA extraction used for this study, and according to the 325 volume of DNA added to the real-time PCR assay, the theoretical limit of detection should be 326 1x10 2 b/mL for the five plant matrices. These results revealed that L. angustifolia and P. 327 myrtifolia may contain fewer real-time PCR inhibitors than Q. ilex and R. officinalis. Moreover, 328 the limit of detection of the bacterial suspension was 5x10 3 b/mL, meaning that the QuickPick 329 extraction kit may not be 100% efficient to extract the DNA of bacteria in pure culture. 330 331 The 22 naturally infected samples were then analyzed by ddPCR. The presence of Xf was 341 detected in 21 of them, including samples P13 and Q04, with at least two droplets, and a total 342 concentration ranging from 4.41x10 2 cp/mL to 1.61x10 7 cp/mL, confirming the ability of 343 ddPCR to detect Xf in naturally infected samples. As only one positive droplet was detected for 344 sample C01, this sample was considered negative by ddPCR. With the exception of samples 345 L04, P06 and P13, the decrease in the Ct value was correlated with an increase in the quantity 346 of DNA detected by ddPCR (Table 4 ). For each matrix the results obtained by ddPCR and real-347 time PCR were compared and were highly correlated (Figure 3) . 348",

            "text": ". Currently, 563 plant species distributed in 82 botanical families 47 are reported to be hosts of Xf, and this list includes plants of major socio-economic interest such 48 as olive trees, citrus or grapevine (EFSA, 2018). Since 2017, Xf has been classified in Annex 49 I/A2 of Council Directive 2000/29/EC revised in 2017, and in the A2 list of the EPPO as a 50 quarantine pathogen present on the EU territory and requiring mandatory control (and cultivation of Xf is fastidious, detection and identification tests are applied 53 directly on plant extracts (Denanc\u00e9 et al., 2017). Nowadays, different molecular tools targeting 54 specific DNA regions are available to detect the bacterium at the species level or to specifically 55 detect one of the subspecies. Conventional PCRs such as Minsavage et al. (2014) have been 56 developed, but they are less sensitive than Real-Time PCR (Baldi and La Porta, 2017). Among 57 the real-time PCR techniques developed, the method designed by Harper et al. (2010) was 58 identified as one of the most suitable methods for Xf detection. It allow to detect all the Xf 59 subspecies, its limit of detection determined on different plant species is low, it is sensitive, and 60 no cross-reactions with other bacterial species have been reported (Francis et al., 2006; Harper 61 et al., 2010; Li et al., 2013; Modesti et al., 2017; Ouyang et al., 2013). 62 Even though real-time PCR is very sensitive in most cases, low bacterial contamination levels 63 of plants and the presence of PCR inhibitors can lead to false negative results, and the 64 underestimation of positive samples for some plant species (Modesti et al., 2017; Schrader et 65 al., 2012). These PCR inhibitors include polyphenols, polysaccharides, pectin and xylan 66 (Harper et al., 2010; Schrader et al., 2012; Wei et al., 2008). Studies have revealed that the 67 improvement of DNA extraction methods, or the addition of bovine serum albumin (BSA) 68 during the PCR assay, may reduce the impact of PCR inhibitors (Harper et al., 2010; Schrader 69 et al., 2012). For some plants, such as Nerium oleander, Prunus dulcis and Vitis vinifera, a 70 tenfold dilution prevented PCR inhibition and led to successful detection of Xf (Francis et al., 71 2006; Minsavage et al., 1994; Modesti et al., 2017",

These 22 samples 140 were already found to have a positive status or to be at the limit of detection by the PHL, using 141 the real-time PCR developed by Harper et al. (2010). 142 2.3 Plant spiking 143 The artificially inoculated plant samples were prepared by mixing 1 g of healthy plant petiole 144 in 4.5 mL of sterile distilled water and spiked with 0.5 mL of a known concentration of bacterial 145 suspension.

A volume of 1 mL of bacterial suspension was heated at 100\u00b0C for 5 min and 152 then frozen at -20\u00b0C for at least 15 min. 153 The macerates of all the spiked plants and naturally infected samples were crushed, prior to 154 DNA extraction. DNA extractions and purifications were carried out using the QuickPick TM 155 SML Plant DNA Kit (Bio-Nobile, Turku, Finland). Extraction, washing, and elution of the 156 DNA were automated using KingFisher TM mL (Thermo Scientific).

According to 196 Bio-Rad recommendations, a temperature ramp of 2\u00b0C/s was fixed on all PCR steps and the 197 lead was heated at 105\u00b0C. After amplification, the PCR plate was directly transferred to the 198 droplet reader QX200 TM Droplet Digital TM System (Bio-Rad). QuantaSoft 1.7.4.0917 software 199 was used for data acquisition and data analysis. The entire concentration range of spiked 200 first amplified in triplicate on the same run. Then, for each matrix, samples with 201 concentrations equal to and below the limit of detection identified by real-time PCR were 202 amplified in triplicate on two other independent runs, in order to ultimately obtain nine results 203 for these samples. Finally, the amplifications of the naturally infected samples were performed 204 in one replicate in one run. 205 2.8 ddPCR analysis 206 Data were analyzed directly with QuantaSoft TM Analysis Pro software. For each plate and each 207 matrix, a threshold was manually set up just above the amplitude value of the cloud 208 corresponding to the negative droplets, also considered as the background, and according to the 209 results of the corresponding NTC (Lievens et al., 2016). This threshold enabled the 210 differentiation of droplets by categorizing them as positive (high level of fluorescence) or 211 negative (low and constant level of fluorescence). The PCR reactions with fewer than 10,000 212 droplets generated were excluded from the analysis, and a result was considered positive if at 213 least two positive droplets were detected. The software provided the results in target copies corresponded to the concentration in target DNA copies/well (cp/well), P the positive 217 droplet number, N the negative droplet number, and V the mean volume in \u00b5L of one droplet. 218According to Bio-Rad, V is equal to 0.85x10 -3 \u00b5L. Primers and probe targeted a part of the 219 rimM gene, which is present in a single copy in the Xf genome. Therefore, the result can be 220 directly converted into cp/\u00b5L in the initial samples, by multiplying it with the total volume of 221 reaction mix (20 \u00b5L), and then dividing it by the volume of DNA sample added to the reaction 222 mix (8 \u00b5L) at the beginning of the assay. 223 A bias, meaning the under or over-estimation of the quantification estimated by ddPCR, in 224 comparison with the expected concentration, was calculated with the following formula",

As the aim of the ddPCR assay in this study was 244 also to improve the limit of detection of Xf in low-level contaminated samples, the final volume 245 of DNA chosen was 8 \u00b5L.

It can therefore be rather 73 difficult to find a universal method, because of the wide range of Xf host plants. Moreover, even 74 though real-time PCR produces quantitative data when using a calibration curve, the results are75 often only interpreted qualitatively for Xf detection (Cruaud et al., 2018; Modesti et al., 2017). 76 Polygala myrtifolia was selected as a matrix containing a low concentration of inhibitors, 110 Lavandula angustifolia, Olea europaea, Quercus ilex and Rosmarinus officinalis were selected 111 as matrices containing high concentrations of inhibitors. Experimental assays were set up 112 following the standard PM7/98 and the digital MIQE guidelines. The following performance 113 criteria were evaluated: analytical sensitivity, repeatability, and diagnostic specificity (EPPO, 114 2014; Huggett et al., 2013). 115 symptomatic P. myrtifolia (Denanc\u00e9 et al., 2017) and Xf subsp. fastidiosa CFBP 7970, isolated 119 in the United States (Florida) from Vitis vinifera were cultivated on modified PWG media at 120 28\u00b0C for two weeks (EPPO, 2018b). Bacterial suspensions of pure culture of Xf were prepared 121 in sterile demineralized water and suspensions titer was estimated by immunofluorescence (IF) 122 (EPPO, 2009, 2018b). The antiserum, used to count Xf, was especially produced in 123 collaboration with the UR1268 BIA -Team Allergy of the French National Institute for 124 Agricultural Research (INRA) of Angers-Nantes. It resulted from the inoculation of rabbits 125 with nine strains of Xf chosen to be as diverse as possible in terms of subspecies, geographical 126 location, and host plant species. The initial concentration of the CFBP 8416 bacterial 127 suspension was estimated by IF at 1.84x10 9 bacteria/mL (b/mL). This suspension was used to 128 spike all the artificially inoculated samples in this study. The bacterial suspension of the strain 129 CFBP 7970 was calibrated at 1x10 7 b/mL and used as a positive control for the PCR reactions. 130 Healthy plant materials used for spiking assays were collected in 2018. L. angustifolia, O. 132 europaea, Q. ilex, R. officinalis were sourced from Maine-et-Loire, a French department known 133to be Xf free. P. myrtifolia was produced in a nursery in Brittany (Xf free) and had a European 134 phytosanitary passport certifying its healthy status. Moreover, no symptoms were recorded on 135 these five plants. In this study, the healthy status of the five matrices was first checked using 136 the real-time PCR assayHarper et al. (2010).",

In 357 this study, diluting the DNA extract of L. angustifolia and R. officinalis did not reduce the limit 358 of detection using ddPCR, or the obtained results were not sufficiently reproducible. This 359 approach does not seem to be useful and appropriate for Xf detection in these two matrices, 360 using ddPCR. Nevertheless, more tests should be carried out to support this assumption. 361Compared to real-time PCR, ddPCR can be considered as a controversial method. Some studies 362 have revealed that ddPCR was useful to improve pathogen detection sensitivity and to decrease 363 the impact of PCR inhibitors on PCR efficiency (Arvia et al., 2017; Bharuthram et al., 2014; 364 Dong et al., 2018; Ra\u010dki et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2016).
