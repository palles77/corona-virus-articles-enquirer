It is shown here that following transection of the rat facial nerve there is strongly elevated expression of class I, and to a lesser extent, class II antigens of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in the facial nucieus. It is demonstrated by double-immtmofluorescence studies that the cells responsible for increased le~els o~' MHC class I antigens are endogenous brain microglia. These findings emphasize the thought that micro~, are inununocompetent cells, but, at the same time, raise the possibility for a non-immunological function of MHC antigens under conditions of neural regeneration.",

            "text": "During the retrograde reaction seen in the facial nucleus after peripheral nerve section there is a massive infiltration of the region by glial cells. While conflicting views have been presented regarding the origin of proliferating glial elements, evidence from this laboratory, and others, strongly supports the idea of a proliferation of local microglia rather than an invasion of blood leucocytes (Kreutzberg, 1966; Sjt~strand, 1966; Torvik and 3zreide, 1975; Schelper and Adrian, 1980 ; Sorei-Address for correspondence: Wolfgang J. Streit, Ph.D., Department of Neuromorphology, Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry, Am Klopferspitz 18A, D-8033 Martinsried, F.R.G. de, 1981; Kreutzberg, 1987, 1988; Graeber et al., 1988) . Although there is little reason to believe that the glial reaction to axotomy bears resemblance to a classical inflammatory reaction, especially since fitere is no introduction of an exogeilo,,~ antigen, recent developments in the study of the relationship between ghal cells and immune responses have changed traditional concepts profoundly in ascribing certain immune-related functions to central nervous system (CNS) glial cells (Fontana et al., 1984; Sun and Wekerle, 1986; Wekerle et ai., 1986; Giulian, 1987; Suzumura et al., 1987) . This has prompted us to determine in the present study whether expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens occurs in the facial nucleus under conditions of nerve regeneration, and if so, by what cell types. In the normal mammalian brain the expression of MHC antigens is extremely low (Schnitzer and Schachner, 1981; l.~psun and Hickey, 1986; Wekerle et al., 1986; Lampson, 1987) . The lack of MHC gene products together with a lack of lymphatic dk=inage, and the presence of the blood-brain barrier has been taken to regard the brain as an 'immunologically privileged' organ. This privilege is to be understood in a sense that immune responses and the concomitant appearance of MHC antigens may occur only during certain pathological states, or experimental situations, such as multiple sclerosis (Traugott et al., 1983; Traugott, 1987) , experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) (Matsumoto and Fujiwara, 1986; Matsumoto et al., 1986) , viral infections (Suzumura et al., 1986; Olsson et al., 1987) , and following stimulation with v-interferon in vivo and in vitro (Lampson and Fisher, 1984; Wong et al., 1984 Wong et al., , 1985 Suzumura et al., 1987) . The present report demonstrates that a lesion occurring outside of the CNS, i.e. transection of the facial nerve, results in a strong increase in MHC class I, and a minor increase in class II antigens in the facial nucleus. This adds a new perspective to the study of MHC antigen expression in that the condition leading to MHC antigen expression is one in which the integrity of the blood-brain barrier is preserved, and no direc'~ insult to the brain takes place.",

Staining with antibodies directed against surface glycoproteins of helper and cytotoxic T cells (W3/25, OX-8, respectively), as well as with the pan T cell marker OX-52, was also negative. When the expression of Ia antigens in the axotomized facial nucleus was probc:! with monoclonal antibody OX-6, a few cells (about 2-3 per section) with a morphology resembling that of microglia were stained. Although the number of Ia-immunoreactive cells was considerably lower than those expressing class I antigens, the time course of appearance of Ia-positive cells was similar to that of cells demonstrating class I immunoreactivity. Other antibodies recognizing determinants of Ia antigens, such as OX-3 and OX-17 did not show staining other than occasional meningeal cells. From 3 to 7 days after axotomy there was a striking increase in OX-18 immunoreactivity in the operated facial nucleus compared to the contralateral unoperated side where reaction product was found only in association with the endothelium of blood vessels ( Fig. la and  b) , Stained gliai cells were not present in the unoperated nucleus. In contrast, throughout the neuropil of the operated nucleus there was diffuse immunostaining which was more pronounced around individual neurons. At higher mag~ification the reaction product could he clearly identio fled on perineuronal glial satelfites (Fig. lc) . Typically, the gliai nuclei were devoid of staining, and the immunoreactivity appeared to be assoeiaw.d with the cytoplasmic processes closely wrapping neuronal perikarya. Control sections treated as described above showed no staining (Fig. ld) .",

Staining with OX-18 in combination with anti-GFAP labelling clearly demonstrated that the OX-18 antibody did not bind to astrocytes ( Fig.  2a and b) . Similar to class I antigens, GFAP immunoreactivity was noticeably elevated in the operated facial nucleus (Graeber and Kxeutzberg, 1986) , but the GFAP-positive astrocytic processes presented in a different arrangement around motoneurons. They were localized as many short discrete foot processes in the vicinity of neurons as well as throughout the neuropil, and did not form a continuous perineuronal rim surrounding the neuronal soma. In contrast, when OX-18 immunoreactivity was compared to the staining pattern obtained with the Griffonia simplicifolia lectin, complete congruity was observed ( Fig. 2c and d) .",

            "text": "A central issue which has been the subject of long-standing controversy concerns the origin of increased numbers of grim cells in the nucleus of an axotomized peripheral nerve. While there is little doubt that during development microglial cells are derived from blood monocytes , a consensus about the source of gila after axotomy in adult animals has not yet been attained. Our contention that endogenous glial cells proliferate in response to axotomy stems from extensive light-and electron-microscopic studies in our and other iaboratories which failed to show either margination and diapedesis of blood leucocytes, or perivascular infiltrates pathognomonic of brain inflammatory disease (Krentzberg, 1966 , Sj0strand, 1966 Torvik and Sereide, 1973; Schelper and Adrian, 1980; Sereide, 1981; Kreutzberg, 1987, 1988; Graeber et al., 1988) . In addition, light-and electron-microscopic autoradiography have shown [3H]thymidine incorporation by perineurally located cells with typical microglial morphology (Kreutzberg, 1966; Graeber et al., 1988) . The fact that suicide transport (Wiley et al., 1982) of toxic ricin by facial motoneurons does not produce an inflammatory reaction but a transformation of local microglia into brain macrophages (Streit and Kreutzberg, 1988) provides additional support for our hypothesis. In view of these earlier studies and the results described here the question then arises why endogenous microghal cells express MHC antigens, essential for T cell-mediated immune functions, when no invasion of leucocytes has been observed or can be demonstrated with T cell-specific monoclonal antibodies. It is known that MHC molecules are co-recognized with a foreign antigen on an antigen-presenting cell by cytotoxic or helper T cells leading to a T cell-mediated immune reaction. While in EAE, for example, the introduction of a foreign antigen precedes the inflammatory reaction, there is probably no such event taking place when a peripheral nerve is cut. Furthermore, unlike in EAE, there is no breakdown of the blood-brain barrier detectable with vascular tracers in response to a nerve lesion occurring outside of the CNS (Sjgstrand, 1966) . For these reasons it is plausible that the increased expression of class I antigens observed in our paradigm does not result in an immune response, but may instead signify a state of alertness, or immune competence of microglial cells. The increased expression of MHC antigens in the absence of a foreign antigen is thus not sufficient to cause an immune response in brain. Low-level expression of class I antigens in normal rat brain by 'cells of dendritic morphology (DC)' --a term in need of definition for the brain parenchyma --has been described (Matsumoto a).td Fujiwara, 1986; Matsumoto et al., 1986) . It is lil,.ely that DC represent a proportion of resting microglial cells bearing a small density of MHC molecules. These resting cells, however, mus~t first receive a stimulus, such as after axotomy, in order to become activated and show such ~,igh MHC antigen expression as described in the present study.",

Although MHC modulation does not seem to play a role during neural differentiation and development (Lampson, 1987) , one should consider the possibility of an involvement of these molecules in cell-cell interactions during nerve regeneration. This speculation is attractive in view of protein sequencing data revealing homologies between MHC molecules and immunoglobulin-reiated structures found on neural tissues, such as the neural cell adhesion molecule, and the myeiin-associated glycoprotein (Wiliiams, 1984 (Wiliiams, , 1987 .
