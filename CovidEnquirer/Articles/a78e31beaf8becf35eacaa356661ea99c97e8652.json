The main weakness of the data is the low inclusion of patients in Rio de Janeiro that does not allow for an assessment of the impact of viral respiratory infections in southeastern Brazil. Seasonal influenza epidemics peak during the winter in temperate latitudes of both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. In contrast, tropical countries may experience two annual peaks, with shorter and less intense epidemics.

The latter were significantly more abundant in older patients and those with severe diseases, whereas comorbidities were associated with ORV infections. These findings reflect the higher virulence of influenza viruses, but could also be a consequence of a lower adhesion to immunization among older children. No difference in mortality was observed between groups infected with different viruses. This contrasts with a previous study performed in Fortaleza, which showed significant association between RSV To know the dynamics of dispersion of influenza viruses in tropical regions have been considered of crucial importance, since several reports have suggested that in these regions the influenza activity is more temporally diffuse and may contain the foci for the emergence of new variants. [6, 7, 27] In addition to the need for a different influenza immunization schedule in Brazil, the composition of this vaccine should also be evaluated, since its antigenic composition for this region may be different from that recommended for the temperate region. [7] However, information on strains circulating in tropics is still scarce, since most of the countries in this region have low income and the health surveillance is not completely employed. Besides that, the logistical challenges to implementing a national immunization program with different calendars and distinct antigenic compositions in Brazil meet the need for investments that provide self)sufficiency in its production [7] .

Initially, immunization targeted individuals aged \u226565 years; however, in 2000, the age limit was lowered to 60 years.

In Brazil, the Ministry of Health employs two systems for epidemiological assessment of respiratory diseases: sentinel surveillance of ILI and universal surveillance of SARI. The sentinel surveillance consists of a network of designated health care units (public or private), distributed throughout the country, in which random samples of respiratory cases are periodically collected for detection and genetic characterization of circulating viruses.

This low prevalence reflected the profile of the 2015 influenza season in Brazil and in most of the Southern Hemisphere and tropical regions. During that year, viral activity remained low through the entire season, with higher prevalence of H3N2 and lower detection of influenza B and H1N1pdm09. Even in temperate regions of the Southern Hemisphere, activity remained at an interseasonal level. In Brazil, a total of 11,945 cases of SARI were reported in 2015, of which 1089 (9%) were related to influenza infection. Among these cases, 599 (55%) were influenza A/H3N2, 234 (21.5%) were influenza B, 141 (12.9%) were influenza A/H1N1pdm09, and 115 (10.5%) were reported as non+ subtyped influenza A. 18 Since 2014, the Brazilian Ministry of Health has included children \u22644 years of age in the group of individuals at risk of severe influenza and subsequently began vaccinating this subpopulation.

Influenza was significantly more frequent in older patients and those with severe diseases, whereas comorbidities were associated with ORV infections. These findings reflected a lower adhesion to immunization among older children, with the presence of severe disease a possible consequence of the higher virulence of influenza viruses, although no difference in mortality was observed between both groups. This contrasted with results from a previous study performed in Fortaleza, showing significant association between RSV infections and infant mortality.23  We believe that such a discrepancy might be due to the low number of positive cases observed in the present study.Studies of influenza seasonality in Brazil show that viral circulation in the northeast region is more prevalent in the first 4 months of the year, coinciding with a period of higher humidity in that area,14,24  whereas viral circulation in the south and southeast appears associated with lower temperature and unlikely to be linked to humidity data.25,26  Our data confirmed this observation and reinforced the growing consensus that vaccinations in northeast Brazil are being carried out in a post+seasonal period, with consequent low effectiveness.The factors associated with the diversity of seasonal patterns displayed during influenza epidemics in the tropics are not completely understood. A previous study identified a seasonal southward+traveling wave across Brazil (from equatorial to temperate regions), suggesting that environmental issues play more important roles than population factors, such as immune function and levels of vitamin D, in driving influenza epidemics in the country.6",

Additionally, policies and resources need to be established to overcome the logistical challenges to implementing national immunization programs using different calendars and distinct antigenic compositions in Brazil.7 This study contained some limitations. Patient recruitment during the seasonal period of influenza previously defined for two sites (Curitiba and Rio de Janeiro) might have contributed to low influenza B detection, although the frequency observed here was similar to that reported by national surveillance programs. Additionally, the study was performed using data collected over the course of 1 year, which limited predictions of the impact of influenza longitudinally in these locales. There was a predominance of pediatric patients in the study population; therefore, data concerning ORV reflect mainly the profile of respiratory viruses in children. The low number of patients from Rio de Janeiro did not allow for an assessment of the impact and seasonality of viral respiratory infections in that region. Finally, the monitoring of weather conditions was performed by organizations linked to the states of each region of the country; therefore limited the description of data to that from similar information made available by these institutions.Despite these limitations, our results indicated that the model of active surveillance applied in our study represents a valuable tool for investigating the impact For peer review only -http://bmjopen.bmj.com/site/about/guidelines.xhtml",
