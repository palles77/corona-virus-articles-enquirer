            "text": "Vaccines are a cost-effective and powerful weapon against human and animal infectious diseases. 1 Although many diseases have been neutralized, potential vaccine-preventable diseases continue to threaten human and animal health. 2, 3 Considering the safety of vaccines, subunit vaccines have become increasingly popular. Improvements and innovation in heterologous protein expression technology have led to a sufficient source for candidate subunit antigens. 4, 5 Regrettably, most subunit vaccines induce lower levels of NA, which is the key factor in providing protective immunity that is accomplished via reducing or abolishing the biological activity of a living microorganism. 6 Therefore, the major challenge in the development of subunit vaccines is identification of strategies that can enhance the levels of NA. Over the past few decades, advances in immunological and high-throughput genome sequencing technology have enabled the identification of pathogen-associated protective antigens. 7 However, some viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza viruses, and porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, rapidly vary their surface antigens such that NA cannot effectively recognize new epitopes, leading to escape from the host's anti-infective immune process. [8] [9] [10] In addition, some pathogens reduce the level of NA level by generating antibodies against immunodominant epitopes, thus exacerbating diseases, as seen in Dengue virus, respiratory syncytial virus, porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. [11] [12] [13] [14] Development of structural biology has increased the throughput of protein structure determination enabling the determination of the threedimensional structure and structured electrostatic landscapes of most vaccine antigens and their epitopes. 15, 16 Based on the surface electrostatic landscapes of the antigen, stabilized and fully displayed neutralizing epitopes on the antigenic surface or the flexible scaffold allow for easy recognition by B cells, promoting proliferation and antibody affinity maturation, while removing or hiding the immunodominant epitopes. 17 Subunit vaccine monomers are variedly and chaotically distributed within the vaccine system and thus cannot efficiently activate B cells. 18 The orientation of antigen epitopes is critical for activation of B cells. Reliable affinity maturation of NA requires stable and full display of neutralizing epitopes rather than transient orientations through a state. 17 Crosslinking of B-cell receptors (BCRs) is also critical for activation of B cells. An ideal immunogen should have multiple copies of epitopes, and bind to multiple BCRs, allowing for multimerization of signal transduction molecules involved in antigen recognition on the surface of B cells. 19, 20 Antigen processing would be better facilitated if antigens were nanoparticles with granular structure and repetitive surface organization, which would increase phagocytosis and the ability to activate the complement system and recruit other immune molecules. 21 One reasonable strategy to improve NA level is based on antigenic epitope structure and to orientationally and repeatedly display neutralizing epitopes on the outer surface of nanoparticles by orientation coupling between antigen and nanoparticles. To verify this strategy, gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) as delivery vehicles have been developed and have shown several features that make them well suited for biomedical applications. Importantly, AuNPs can be readily conjugated with peptides through the gold-thiol (Au-S) bond by simply mixing AuNPs with peptides that contain cysteine, thus offering a highly flexible and customizable approach to provide a scaffold that can be used to fix proteins or peptides to form a certain spatial orientation. 22, 23 According to bioinformatics analysis, mainly based on antigen crystal structure and the corresponding pathogenic characteristics, we selected the capsid (Cap) protein of PCV2 as a model antigen. PCV2, classified in the family Circoviridae and one of the smallest DNA viruses, is widespread and has caused an estimated \u20ac 5.76 billion economic loss for the EU. 24, 25 The Cap protein can form virus-like particles (VLPs) dividing the structure of Cap protein into two faces, neutralizing epitopes on the outer surface, while the unique cysteine residue is on the inner face ( Figure 1A and B). 26 The decoy epitope, an immunodominant region consisting of residues 169-180 (Cap (169-180)), exposed on the surface of the Cap protein monomer but buried in virus particles or VLPs, allows PCV2 to evade humoral immunity by inducing low-level NA and high-level non-protection antibodies. 13, 27 In the current study, we used AuNPs as an orientationalconnect carrier to display Cap protein (Cap-conjugated AuNPs [Cap-AuNPs]), with neutralizing epitopes exposed on the outside surface of the nanoparticles ( Figure 1C ). The immune responses to Cap-AuNPs were evaluated in mice. To examine the mechanisms of the antibody production, the efficiency of cellular uptake of Cap-AuNPs into RAW264.7 macrophage cells and DC2.4 dendritic cells and subsequent cytokine secretion were measured. Our study lays the foundation for the development of a human and animal subunit vaccine based on antigen structural analysis that utilizes nanoparticles as a fixed-point connection carrier for antigens with reasonable conformation.

SDS-PAGE and western blotting results showed that the Cap protein was successfully expressed and purified with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 26 kDa (Figure 2A) . The Cap protein reacted with anti-PCV2 Figure 2B ). The mean diameter of AuNPs was 23.2 nm (~23 nm) ( Figure 2C and E). After conjugation of Cap protein, the mean diameter increased to 42.2 nm (~42 nm) ( Figure 2D and E), the absorbance wavelength shifted to 529 nm, and the zeta potential had a positive shift from -47.9 mV to -34.7 mV ( Figure 2F ), indicating stable conjugation between Cap protein and AuNPs. Cap-AuNPs aggregated when they were lyophilized and resuspended, with particle size increasing to 182 nm and zeta potential increasing to -20.8 mV ( Figure 2E and F). The FTIR spectrum ( Figure 2G ) showed a weak peak near 2,550 cm -1 region, which virtually confirmed the presence of thiol (S-H) molecules in the sole cysteine molecule of Cap protein; however, the peak disappeared when AuNPs were coated with Cap protein ( Figure 2G ) indicating that S-H was changed to a new bond. This coincides with that reported by Aryal et al, who discovered the absence of S-H representative peak using FTIR spectrometer and the constitution of new Au-S bond when conjugating cysteine with AuNPs. The thiol molecules of cysteine could directly bind to AuNPs as the covalent Au-S bond is strongly favored. In this study, AuNPs were exploited as the support structure and conjugated with Cap through the Au-S bond. 35 9F4 and 6A5 are mAbs with neutralizing ability that specifically recognize neutralizing epitopes, which are located on the outer surface of the Cap protein. However, a His tag located at the N-terminus of Cap protein replaced the nuclear localization sequence of Cap protein, which is located on the inner face of Cap protein. Furthermore, 8A10 can recognize the decoy epitope Cap (169-180), which was buried when forming VLPs. ELISA results showed that Cap-AuNPs were more easily recognized by 9F4 and 6A5 than Cap; on the contrary, Cap was more easily recognized by anti-His-tag mAb and 8A10 than Cap-AuNPs (Figure 3) . These results indicate that the epitopes on the inner face of Cap protein were hidden, but the neutralizing epitopes located on the outer surface were exposed when Cap protein was conjugated to AuNPs via the Au-S bond.",

Therefore, there was no significant difference in the levels of IgG between the Cap and Cap-AuNP groups when using Carbopol and Freund's adjuvant ( Figure 6A ). High levels of antibody against PCV2 require epitopes on the surface of PCV2 to be fully recognized by APCs. Cap protein that binds to the surface of AuNPs can be efficiently recognized, swallowed, processed, and presented by APCs and plays a central role in activating immune response. Therefore, there was significant difference in the level of IgG against PCV2 between the Cap group and the Cap-AuNPs group when using Carbopol and Freund's adjuvant ( Figure 6B ). Our previous experiments (data not shown) have confirmed that CpG weakly promoted the levels of anti-Cap and PCV2 IgG. Moreover, CpG had a synergistic effect with AuNPs and markedly enlarged immune effect. However, AuNPs played a key role rather than CpG. Similar results have been found by Tao et al. 36 Thus, when CpG was used as adjuvant, there was a significant difference between the Cap and Cap-AuNPs groups for IgG against Cap and PCV2 ( Figure 6A and B) .",

On comparing the significant changes of Cap-specific antibodies with PCV2-specific antibodies and NA in the Carbopol and Freund's adjuvant groups, we found that AuNPs significantly enhanced NA, rather than Cap-specific antibodies. These data indicated that AuNPs enhanced NAs mainly due to reasonable display of neutralizing epitopes and masking of the immunodominant epitope. effect of lyophilization on the immune response As shown in Figure 7A , the Cap-specific antibody levels in non-lyophilized group was higher than in the lyophilized group (P=0.15), which may, in part, be due to the inactivation of a portion of Cap protein during lyophilization process. Interestingly, PCV2-specific and NA levels in lyophilized group were markedly higher than in non-lyophilized group ( Figure 7B and D) . The ratio of IgG against Cap (169-180)/ IgG against PCV2 in lyophilized group was obviously lower than in non-lyophilized group ( Figure 7C ). These data suggested that the slight reduction of Cap-specific antibody did not affect NA and the stability of Cap-AuNPs conjugation was likely enhanced following lyophilization.

The second and more important point, AuNPs directionally presented multiple neutralizing epitopes; thus, B cells simultaneously recognized more neutralizing epitopes, resulting in rapid proliferation of B-cell clones, which specifically target the neutralizing epitopes. Meanwhile AuNPs shielded the immunodominant epitope Cap (169-180), effectively reducing the antibody against this epitope, which plays a negative role in the production of NA.",

            "text": "Nanoparticles offer new horizons for subunit vaccine design. 44 The most important mechanisms of nanoparticles in improving subunit vaccine effectiveness are by increasing the amount of antigen taken by APCs and multiplying the displayed subunit antigens in well-ordered arrays. 18, 19 Nanoparticles provide a customizable method for ligation of antigens by linking specific sites such as thiol groups to the gold particle. Furthermore, phosphorylation sites on proteins have a high affinity for aluminum hydroxide nanoparticles and tag polypeptides on antigens or domains on fusion-expressing antigens can be linked to nanoparticles, for example, poly-histidine tags can bind to various divalent High-resolution structures provide an opportunity to understand the structural basis for immunogenicity and immunodominance, improve vaccine efficacy, and broaden the range of vaccine-preventable diseases. 45 According to the structural information of antigens, complete exposure of conserved or hidden neutralizing epitopes is the basic principle of structural vaccinology. 46 Self-assembling protein nanoparticles have been used to achieve targeted display of antigens. 18 Kanekiyo et al used a structure-based design strategy to generate a genetic fusion encoding hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza virus linked to ferritin. Interestingly, ferritin forms a nearly spherical particle composed of 24 subunits. HA was exposed on the outer surface of ferritin, mimicked its spatial position on the influenza H1N1 virus, and elicited broad NA against influenza virus. 47 The fusion of the aminoterminus and carboxyl-terminus of the target antigen with the protein nanoparticles confines the spatial conformation of the antigen and thus it may be unfavorable to randomly select a connection point and the orientationally display of the antigen. 48, 49 Furthermore, a protein carrier is immunogenic, which is disadvantageous for the development of similar vaccines. These are limited to widely used structure-based nanoparticles in directional display strategy.",

If possible, naturally occurring sites can be utilized, such as the unique thiol groups in this study. This takes into account that most neutralizing epitopes are formed from residues that are discontinuous in the primary amino acid sequence or buried by other residues; thus, there may be a need to redesign artificial scaffolds and display the neutralizing epitope on the surface of scaffold. 46, 49 Third, to synthesize nanoparticles that can efficiently bind to antigen or neutralizing epitope artificial scaffolds at a certain point, nanoparticles may need to be chemically modified. Antigen or artificial scaffolds can combine with biomaterials and then form nanoparticles. The introduction of structural-based antigen design methods combined with nanoparticles will contribute to the development of subunit vaccines.",

In the current study, we selected the Cap protein of PCV2 as a model antigen, which has immunodominant epitopes and neutralizing epitopes. We conjugated Cap to AuNPs by the Au-thiol interaction, which was confirmed by FTIR, resulting in the immunodominant epitopes being obscured while fully exposing the neutralizing epitopes on the outer surface. AuNPs promoted phagocytosis of Cap protein by APCs without inducing inflammatory cytokine secretion, enhanced humoral and cellular immunity, and balanced Th1 and Th2 type cellular immunity. The NAs were significantly improved, while antibody against the immunodominant epitope was significantly reduced. Overall, this study demonstrates that the strategy of nanoparticles orientationally displaying antigen epitopes appears to be feasible for vaccine development.",
