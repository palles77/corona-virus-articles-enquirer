COVID-19 pneumonia has had a significant impact on people's health and social activity behavior and on economic development.

The outbreak of COVID-19 led to the closure of Wuhan, workers were delayed to work, and schools were closed across China. Although the majority of cases are mild, a certain proportion of patients develop critical illness, with a documented case-fatality rate of 2.3% in China [1] .",

He was admitted to the hospital two weeks later with hypoxemia (blood oxygen saturation 90% on room air) without fever or myalgia. Physical examination results showed temperature of 36.9\u00b0C, blood pressure of 184/107 mm Hg, heart rate of 74 beats/min, and bilateral normal lung respiratory sounds. Laboratory tests showed white blood cell count of 3.38\u00d710\u2079 per L with 77.5% neutrophils, 15.7% lymphocytes, and 0% eosinophils. C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) were 40.1 mg/L and 0.73 ng/mL, respectively. Liver function and cardiac enzymes were within the normal range.

While the patient did not have many of the typical symptoms, including fever, sore throat, nasal congestion, malaise, headache or myalgia, he did have cough, dyspnea, and typical changes of bilateral multiple ground-glass opacities on chest CT images. Because hemodialysis patients have disorders of B-cell and T-cell function [7, 8] , patients may have atypical presentations. Lymphopenia is common in patients with COVID-19 and might be a critical factor associated with disease severity and mortality in general patients [9] . Cao and colleagues reported that the most common laboratory abnormalities were depressed total lymphocytes, prolonged prothrombin time, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase in COVID-19 pneumonia [10] . Given low lymphocyte counts in hemodialysis patients chronically, lymphopenia likely is not helpful for identifying individuals with SARS-CoV-2 virus. PCT has similar limitations, with levels chronically elevated in hemodialysis patients, even in the absence of severe acute illness [11] . Given these limitations and the high prevalence of comorbid conditions, COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis in hemodialysis patients is dependent on clinical epidemiology, radiographic findings, and viral nucleic acids testing.",

As coronavirus replication requires the action of viral proteases, lopinavir/ritonavir may be effective by binding to the coronavirus protease to inhibit viral replication. Previous studies [12, 13] have shown that lopinavir/ritonavir can inhibit MERS-CoV (Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus) and SARS-CoV replication. Our results suggest that lopinavir/ritonavir may improve the course of COVID-19 pneumonia in patients with hemodialysis, although the lack of a control patient makes this conclusion somewhat subjective. Because of liver clearance and higher protein binding capacity of lopinavir/ritonavir, no dosing adjustments are necessary in the treatment of hemodialysis patients [14] .",

This begins with strengthening pre-screening triage of hemodialysis patients [5] . Persons without face masks are not allowed to enter the hemodialysis ward. We also implemented a policy whereby it was mandated that the \"COVID-19 Pneumonia Screening Registration Form\" be completed (Box 1). All patients had their temperature checked at the entrance to the hemodialysis unit, and were surveyed regarding any recent fever, cough, or exposure to epidemic areas or to individuals who have visited epidemic areas within the last 2 weeks. If available, particularly within epidemic areas, we suggest promptly assessing for SARS-CoV-2 virus nucleic acid with swabs, especially in those with respiratory symptoms. For non-suspected patients with potential COVID-19 exposure or from epidemic areas within the last 2 weeks, we performed hemodialysis in an isolation area within the hemodialysis facility.",
