Objective: To determine the status of OE to infectious risks and use of PPE. Methods: A convenience sample of 907 questionnaires (response rate, 88.5%) was collected from September 1, 2014, to January 31, 2015, in 5 metropolitan Korean cities. Results: Respiratory diseases were significantly prevalent (44.5%) and influenza (29.5%) was the most frequently reported illness. An exposure report was only made in 19.5% of cases. The primary reason for OE report noncompletion was the complexity of the reporting process (23.9%). A total of 365 participants reported OE to body fluids and blood (40.2%) with needlestick injury being the most frequent OE type (17.6%). More than 5 years of job experience (47.8%) (P < .001) and region (city) (P = .003) significantly increased OE to body fluids and blood. Puncture-resistant containers (71.9%) and disposable gloves (68.9%) were used. Job training and education on infection risks and use of PPE were not uniformly conducted (77.5%). Anxiety about OE to risk of infection from patients was common among EMP (63.2%). Conclusions: EMP experienced significant OE to infectious risk and use PPE inadequately. Surveillance and education programs regarding OE should be developed.",

            "text": "Prehospital health care providers, particularly emergency medical personnel (EMP), including emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and nurses, are exposed through their occupation to bloodborne pathogens, including hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, HIV, and various other infectious hazards. 1, 2 Unlike the characteristics of occupational exposure among other hospital health care workers (HCWs), 3, 4 EMP are exposed more frequently to respiratory diseases 2 and blood via skin exposure rather than percutaneous exposure such as needlestick injury. [5] [6] [7] Thus, standard precautions, including the adequate use of personal protective equipment (PPE), are strongly recommended for EMP. 8, 9 Blood exposure risks are more than doubled (odds ratio, 2.4) when not using appropriate PPE. 5 In the Republic of Korea (hereafter Korea), prehospital health care providers as EMPs were mainly EMTs and nurses. As providers of prehospital emergency medical services (EMS), EMTs have 2 levels of certification: basic emergency medical technician (EMT-B) and paramedic (EMT-P). There are college-or university-based education systems for EMT-P and special authorized training organizations for EMT-B accredited by the Ministry of Health and Welfare, in which individuals are required to pass both written and practical examinations for the national EMS certification. Most EMTs are stationed at fire stations as prehospital EMS providers, whereas others are often positioned in the emergency department of hospitals. The duties of EMT-P include invasive medical treatments (including endotracheal intubation, initiating intravenous access, and injecting intravenous glucose for hypoglycemic shock), administering medication (sublingual nitroglycerin and bronchodilator for asthma attack), and performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation and ventilator support. The duties of EMT-B are limited to noninvasive procedures and basic life support. 10 Few studies of occupational exposure to infectious risk among EMP and prehospital HCWs providing EMS and their adherence to the use of PPE in prehospital environments have been conducted in Korea. Moreover, during the Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak from May 20-July 28, 2015, it was reported that 2 Middle East respiratory syndrome cases were caused by occupational exposure among EMP. 11 EMP should be included in occupational exposure prevention systems and systematically protected from occupational infectious risks as are other HCWs. 3 To achieve this, the status of their occupational exposure to infectious risk and infection prevention measures should be investigated and quantified, providing basic information of the status of occupational exposures to develop effective occupational exposure prevention systems for EMP. Therefore, this study was conducted to determine the current status of occupational exposures among EMP to infectious risks and their use of PPE in prehospital environments, and to provide basic information about the occupational exposures of EMPs for the development of occupational exposure prevention programs.",

Part II included 18 questions measuring the extent of occupational exposure to infectious risks, job training and education, the use of PPE, and their concerns and suggestions. Detailed follow-up questions were used in several categories. Specific occupational exposure information included exposure experiences, types of occupational exposure, types of infectious diseases to which they were exposed, and previous reports of occupational exposure (if occupational exposure was not reported, the reasons for this were also collected). Specific PPE use information included use of PPE as a standard precaution (ie, wearing gloves and other PPE), manipulation of needles, use of sharps containers, types of PPE used during the transfer of patients with respiratory symptoms, and types of PPE used during transfer of patients with bleeding. Specific information about job training and educational experiences within the past year was collected, including the status of their training in occupational exposure to infection risks, use of PPE, and postexposure management (PEM). Information about participants' major concerns and suggestions about occupational exposure and prevention was also collected. The questionnaire was revised to increase validity following a pilot study of expert EMPs. The final questionnaire included 30 questions.",

Marcus et al 6 reported that individual EMS workers have a mean of 1.25 blood contacts, including 0.02 percutaneous exposures, per 100 patients attended. Unlike the previous studies, 1,6 our study revealed that EMP percutaneous exposure in Korea (ie, needlestick injury) was the most frequent route of occupational exposure to body fluids and blood. This result was likely related to the high rate of recapping and manipulation of needles, and to participants' dissatisfaction with their use of punctureresistant containers for disposal of needles and sharps (shown in Table 1 ). Therefore, job training and education about blood and body fluid exposure prevention should be encouraged. In addition, supplies of sharps containers should be increased in all areas of the work environment.",

Our participants' use of PPE did not satisfy the standards. 9,14 Therefore, additional efforts should be made to improve adherence to routine PPE use. When EMPs transfer patients with respiratory symptoms and open trauma with bleeding, the most commonly used PPE was a mask; however, the use of other PPE was very low. Therefore, job training and education about PPE use according to transmission-based and exposure types should be included to decrease exposure risk. Leiss 5 reported that the risk of nonintact skin blood exposure and not being provided with appropriate PPE increased the risk of occupational exposure (odds ratio, 2.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.6-3.3).",
