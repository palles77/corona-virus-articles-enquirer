When the skin of the ear canal is exposed to water for long periods, it becomes macerated and desquamates, causing the development of microfissures. The protective cerumen is washed away and the pH level of the ear canal changes [3] . Otitis externa is, therefore, seen frequently in swimmers, hot and humid climates, and in conditions that lead to water retention in the ear such as pro-0031-3955/06/$ -see front matter D",

Treatment should include cleansing and debridement of the ear canal with a cotton swab and hydrogen peroxide or Burow's solution. An acidifying agent (2% acetic acid) is useful to inhibit the growth of bacteria and fungi. Topical antibiotic drops alone or mixed with antifungal agents or steroids (to decrease inflammation) should be continued for at least 3 days after the resolution of symptoms. A cotton wick of gauze strip may be required to allow diffusion of the drops into the edematous ear canal. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or even opiates may be required for pain control. Cultures are not necessary unless the condition is refractory to treatment [4] .",

It tends to occur more frequently in males and in Native American or Inuit populations [5] . It has been associated with lower socioeconomic status, possibly because of crowding, poor hygiene, suboptimal nutrition, and to limited access to health care and medical resources. Breastfeeding has been found to have a protective effect [5] , whereas exposure to tobacco smoke and repeated exposure to other children, such as at a daycare facility, have been related to an increase in propensity toward the disease.

These same guidelines call for the judicious use of antibiotics in view of increasing antibiotic resistance and the unclear necessity of the use of antibiotics in children with uncomplicated AOM. Guidelines advocate the option of a period of observation without the use of antimicrobial agents for 48 to 72 hours in selected children with uncomplicated AOM. These cases include children from 6 months to 2 years of age with nonsevere illness if the diagnosis of AOM is uncertain and children older than 2 years of age with nonsevere illness, despite the certainty of the diagnosis of AOM. If the patient fails to improve with symptomatic treatment within 48 to 72 hours, the guidelines recommend that the patient be reassessed and antibiotic therapy initiated [1] .",

The mucosa overlying Kiesselbach's plexus is fragile and firmly adhered to the cartilage of the septum, making it prone to trauma. Because the bleeding is mostly from capillary or venous sources, anterior bleeds tend to be characterized by a slow, persistent oozing [16] . Posterior bleeds, however, originate from the sphenopalatine artery in the posterior nasal cavity and nasopharynx [17] and tend to bleed more profusely.

Care must be taken when cauterizing a bleed to prevent damage to surrounding structures and perforation of the nasal septum. Anterior bleeding that is unresponsive to cautery may require anterior nasal packing with petroleum jelly (Vasoline) gauze strips or a commercial packing that expands when it becomes wet to tamponade the bleeding vessel. Packing should be preceded by the application of local anesthesia and nasal decongestants [15] . The removal of packing and a reevaluation can take place after 15 to 30 minutes.",

The root extends into the alveolar bone and is covered by a layer of bone-like cementum. Individual sockets within the maxillary and mandibular alveolar bone house each tooth.

The tooth should be handled by the crown to avoid damaging the periodontal ligament. Debris may be removed by gentle rinsing with saline or water, but scrubbing should be avoided. The tooth may then be replanted and held in place by biting down on a gauze pad (or by gentle finger pressure) until a splint can be placed by a medical or dental professional. If the tooth cannot be replanted within 5 minutes, it may be stored in a culture medium to preserve the vitality of periodontal ligament cells. The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommends (in order of preference) the use of Viaspan, Hanks' balanced salt solution, cold milk, saliva, physiologic saline, or water. Milk is the preferred substance most readily available. The avulsed tooth may also be placed in a container of the child's saliva.
