            "text": "Astrocytes can function as antigen-presenting cells (APC) upon expression of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens, which are induced by interferon-7 (IFN-7). Previous data from this laboratory had shown that the cytokine tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) enhances IFN-y-mediated class II antigen expression on astrocytes. We have now investigated the effect of IFN-7 and TNF-a on class II MHC mRNA expression in astrocytes using Northern blot analysis. Astrocytes do not constitutively express mRNA for class II MHC. Kinetic analysis of class 11 MHC mRNA expression in IFN-'/-treated cells demonstrated an 8 h time lag, which was followed by an increase over the next 16 h. Optimal expression of class II mRNA was detected after a 24 h incubation with IFN-y. This level of expression was further enhanced by the simultaneous addition of 1FN--/and TNF-a to the astrocytes, while TNF-a alone had no effect on class II mRNA expression. TNF-a does not act by increasing the stability of IFN-y-induced class II mRNA, indicating its action is not at that specific level of post-transcriptional control. Furthermore, astrocyte class II mRNA expression was inhibited when cycloheximide (CHX) was added together with IFN-y or IFN-y/TNF-a, and when CHX was added up to 4 h after treatment with IFNq, or IFN-y/TNF-a. These results indicate that astrocyte class II mRNA expression is mediated by newly synthesized proteins induced by IFN-y and/or IFN-y/TNF-a. The expression of class II antigens on astrocytes, and cytokine modulation of their expression, may be important in the initiation and perpetuation of intracerebral immune responses.",

            "text": "The non-neuronal cells of the central nervous system (CNS) are made up of the macroglia (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and ependymal cells) and the microglia. Collectively, these glial cells perform a variety of active roles during development of the brain (Rakic, 1971; Silver and Sapiro, 1981) and subsequently in the maintenance of normal CNS physiology (Hertz, 1981; Janzer and Raft, 1987) . Recent work has suggested that glial cells such as astrocytes and microglia may be involved in immunological events occurring in the brain. The astrocyte can be stimulated to secrete a number of immunoregulatory molecules, including interleukin-1 (IL-I) (Fontana et al., 1982) , interleukin-3 (IL-3) (Frei et al., 1985) , interleukin-6 (IL-6) (Frei et al., 1989; Benveniste eta[., 1990) , prostaglandins (Fontana et al., 1982) , leukotriene 134 (llartung et al., 1988) , tumor necrosis factor-c~ (TNF-cO (Robbins et al., 1987; Lieberman et al., 1989; Chung and Benveniste, 199(I) and IFN-c~/,8 (Tedeschi et al., 1986) . The microglia can also be stimulated to secrete 1L-1 (Giulian et al., 1986) , IL-6 (Frei et al., 1989) and TNF-a (Frei et al., 1987) , thus providing the CNS with numerous endogenous sources of cytokines necessary, for immunological response.",

We have previously shown that TNF-~ enhances IFNq,-induced class II antigen expression on astrocytes, and that this is a synergistic interaction as TNF-a alone has no effect on class I1 expression (Benveniste et al., 1989) . The present study was undertaken to extend these previous findings, and to examine, at the molecular level, the effect of 1FN-y and TNF-a on astrocyte class II gene expression. We report that astrocytes express class II mRNA 8 h after treatment with IFN-2\u00a2 or 1FN-T/TNI'-~,, indicating a long lag period between exposure to the cytokines and initiation of class II gene expression. TNF-~ does not act to stabilize IFNq,-induced class II mRNA, suggesting it may act at other levels of post-transcriptional control or at the transcriptional level. Furthermore, the expression of class II MHC mRNA was completely inhibited by cycloheximide (CHX), suggesting a role for newly synthesized proteins in astrocyte class II MHC expression.",

Culture medium (CM) was Duibecco's modified essential medium (DMEM), high glucose formula supplemented with glucose to a final concentration of 6 g/l, 2 mM glutamine, 0.1 mM non-essential amino acid mixture, 0.1% gentamicin, and 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, Logan, UT, U.S.A.). After 10 days in primary culture, oligodendrocytes were separated from the glial cultures by mechanical dislodging, and the astrocytes were obtained by trypsinization (0.25% trypsin/0.02% EDTA) and replated at a density of 6-10 x 10 6 cells/100 mm 2 tissue culture plate and allowed to adhere for at least 24 h. The cells were counted using trypan blue; cell viability was 99-100%. The astrocytes were monitored for purity by immunofluorescence, and by non-specific esterase staining for contaminating microglia as previously described (Benveniste and Merrill, 1986) . The primary astrocytes were plated (5.0 x 104) on 12 mm glass coverslips, incubated in culture medium for 2 days, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and fixed for 10 s in cold acetone. The cells were then stained for GFAP, an intracellular antigen unique to astrocytes (Bignami et al., 1972) , using a monoclonal antibody to GFAP (1:4) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by a 30 min incubation with goat anti-mouse Ig/FITC (1:20). The coverslips were then mounted in 30% glycerol, and visualized by fluorescent microscopy. Astrocyte cultures were routinely > 97% positive for GFAP, and less than 2% of the cells were microglia based on their positive staining for non-specific esterase.",

Therefore, it was necessary to do a dose-response study for each lot of IFN-T used. For this study, 100 U/ml of IFN-T was sufficient for maximal expression of class II mRNA. The optimal time required for class II mRNA expression following treatment of astrocytes with IFN-T is illustrated in Fig. 2 . Astrocytes were incubated in SFM without or with IFN-~, for 12, 24 or 48 h prior to harvesting. A low level of class II MHC mRNA was detected at 12 h following treatment with IFN-~,, with maximal expression detected after a 24 h incubation with IFN-T. There was a 2.7-fold increase in class II MHC mRNA expression from 12 to 24 h, and a slight reduction at 48 h. We have previously shown that the level of class II protein expression, based on fluorescenceactivated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, was enhanced when the cells were treated with both IFN-T and TNF-a (Benveniste et al., 1989) .

Class II mRNA was induced in astrocytes with either IFN-\"/or IFN--//TNF-a for 24 h, then actinomycin D (a transcription inhibitor) was added for various times (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24 h).

Preliminary results indicated that a decrease in class II mRNA was not detected until 8 h of actinomycin D treatment (data not shown). Subsequent experiments were performed utilizing RNA extracted after 8, 16 and 24 h of actinomycin D treatment. As shown in Fig. 6 actinomycin D treatment, TNF-a did not appreciably affect the stability of E-a mRNA compared to the stability of IFN-y-induced E-a mRNA. In fact, it appears that TNF-a contributes to an accelerated destabilization of class II mRNA. The approximate half-life of E-a mRNA in the presence of IFN-v/TNF-a was 19 h, compared to greater than 24 h in the presence of IFN-v alone. These same blots were reprobed for cyclophilin mRNA to demonstrate that the integrity and quantity of RNA loaded in each lane was similar (data not shown).

Post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms include (1) changes in mRNA stability, (2) alternative RNA splicing, (3) poly A addition, and (4) control of translational initiation. In our experiments, TNF-a did not increase the stability of IFN-3,-induced class II mRNA, indicating that TNF-a did not act at that level of post-transcriptional control. Preliminary results from our laboratory suggest that the increase in class II mRNA occurs primarily by an increase in transcription of the E-a gene since nuclear run-on assays detected no transcription of the class II genes without induction by IFN-y, and enhanced transcription in the presence of IFN-~, plus TNF-a. Further experimentation is necessary to determine conclusively if TNF-a acts solely at the transcriptional level, or whether both transcriptional and post-transcriptional events result in increased class II MHC mRNA and protein. 197 The time required for the appearance of class II MHC mRNA following treatment with IFN-~, or IFN-~,/TNF-a (8 h) suggests that cytokine signal transmission is complex and may involve a number of intermediary steps. We examined whether protein synthesis was required for IFN-), or IFN-\"t/TNF-a-induced expression of astrocyte class II genes. The expression of class II mRNA was completely inhibited when CHX was included with IFN-~, and IFN-'t/TNF-~ treatment, indicating that newly synthesized protein is required for astrocyte class II MHC gene expression. A minimum of 4 h of active protein synthesis was required for subsequent IFN-T/TNF-a-induced class II mRNA expression, while 8 h was required for subsequent IFN-), expression. However, in experiments where CHX was added 12 h after treatment with IFN-), or IFN-),/TNF-~, there was still a 45% and 25% reduction, respectively, in the expression of class II mRNA compared to astrocytes incubated with the cytokines alone. This indicates that the synthesis of novel proteins is required continuously for optimal class II gene expression in astrocytes. Other studies have shown that protein synthesis was required for up to 12 h after IFN-~, was added to murine P388D cells to detect an increase in the level of I-Aa (Boettger et al., 1988) , while in peritoneal mouse macrophages, a 30% decrease in I-At~ mRNA levels was observed even when CHX was added after 12 h of IFN-'rtreatment (Fertsch et al., 1987) . In contrast, Celada et al. (1989) demonstrated that protein synthesis was only required for 30 rain after murine macrophages were treated with IFN-), for an increase in I-Aft mRNA to be detected. Thus, different cell types have varying requirements for active protein synthesis to express class II mRNA in response to IFN-),.",

Direct injection of IFN-T into the brains of mice induced class II antigens on astrocytes, indicating that astrocytes have the potential to express these antigens in vivo (Wong et al., 1984) . Many laboratories have examined whether astrocytes express class I1 antigens in a variety of immune-mediated disease states to better understand the possible role of the astrocyte as a local APC. Traugott et al. (1985) demonstrated class II expression on astrocytes in active chronic multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions, and then confirmed these studies by performing double-staining for both class II and GFAP (Traugott and Lebon, 1988) . A study by Hofman et al. (1986) also identified class ll-posirive astrocytes in MS brain by double-staining. Rodriguez et al. (1987) have studied class I1 expression on glial cells in an animal model of CNS demyelination induced by Theiler's virus. In susceptible strains of mice (BIO.S and BIO.ASR2), the majority of class II-positive glial cells had morphological characteristics of astrocytes, while uninfected mice or resistant strains (BIO.S, (9R)) were class II negative. In SJL mice with acute or chronic relapsing experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for MS, some class II-positive ceils were identified as astrocytes (Sakai et al., 1986) . However, other studies investigating the EAE model in Lewis rats failed to detect class II-positive astrocytes in the brain (Hickey et al., 1985 : Matsumoto et al., 1986 Vass et al., 1986) . Thesc conflicting results may bc due solely to technical problems involved with antigen fixation and staining methodologies, or may indicate that the ability of astrocytes to function as APC in vivo may only bc relevant in certain diseases or specific stages of disease. Another possibility may be the loss of class II-positive astrocytes by class II MHC-restricted T cell-mediated cytotoxicity as shown by Sun and Wekerle (1986) .",

This hyperinduction of class II in EAE-susceptible animals was astrocyte specific as both peritoneal macrophages and microglial cells of susceptible and resistant strains showed identical patterns for class II induction.
