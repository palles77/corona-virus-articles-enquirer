            "text": "Canine parvovirus (CPV) is one of the most common causes of acute haemorrhagic enteritis in young dogs, while clinical diagnosis is often indecisive. The aim of our study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of an in-clinic rapid test in the detection of CPV infection in dogs. To this end, we compared the Rapid Diagnostic Kit of Canine Parvovirus, Coronavirus and Rotavirus antigen (Quicking \u00ae ) to PCR, which is considered as the most reliable diagnostic method. A total of 78 duplicated faecal samples were collected from diarrhoeic dogs. Vaccination history within a month prior to the onset of diarrhoea was reported for 12 of the sampled dogs. The rapid diagnostic test was performed in 23 of the faecal samples directly, while the rest were placed into a sterile cotton tipped swab suitable for collection and transportation of viruses (Sigma -VCM \u00ae ) and stored at \u221220 \u2022 C. The sensitivity of the Quicking rapid diagnostic test compared to PCR in the total number of samples, in samples from non-vaccinated dogs and in samples tested directly after collection were 22.22% (95% CI: 13.27-33.57%), 26.67% (95% CI: 16.08-39.66%) and 76.47% (95% CI: 50.10-93.04%) respectively, while the specificity of the test was 100% in any case. In conclusion, negative results do not exclude parvoenteritis from the differential diagnosis, especially in dogs with early vaccination history, but a positive result almost certainly indicates CPV infection. An improved sensitivity may be expected when the test is performed immediately.",

This results in haemorrhagic diarrhoea, the most characteristic form of clinical disease. Its duration and severity strongly correlate to the titres of maternally derived antibodies at the time of infection. Virus is transmitted via the faecal-oral route through contact with faeces, soil or fomites that carry the virus. It is shed in the faeces of infected dogs within 4-5 days from exposure, throughout the period of clinical disease, and for up to ten days after recovery (Decaro et al., 2005b) .

Therefore, it should be rapidly confirmed by reliable laboratory methods in order to begin therapeutic efforts as soon as possible. Rapid, in-clinic immunochromatographic assays are available for the diagnosis of CPV infection (Schmitz et al., 2009) . Apart from that, faeces from clinically ill dogs can be tested using haemagglutination, virus isolation (Desario et al., 2005) and molecular methods (PCR or Real Time PCR) (Decaro et al., 2005a) . However, in-clinic tests are still the most frequently used diagnostic tool in everyday veterinary practice, as the procedure is simple, inexpensive and timely.",

Each 50 L reaction mixture contained PCR buffer 1\u00d7 (KCl 50 mM, Tris-HCl 10 mM, pH 8.3), MgCl 2 2 mM, 200 mM of each deoxynucleotide, 1 M of each primer, 2 U of DNA Polymerase (Thermoscientific Maxima Hot Start Taq DNA polymerase) and 10 mL of template DNA. The thermal conditions of this protocol initially indicate an activation of Hot Start Taq DNA polymerase at 94 \u2022 C for10 min. Following this step, 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 \u2022 C for 30 s, annealing at 50 \u2022 C for 1 min and polymerization at 72 \u2022 C for 1 min, and finally an extension at 72 \u2022 C for 10 min. Following PCR, electrophoresis was performed using 8 L of the PCR products in a 2% Tris acetate-EDTA-agarose gel. Product sizes were determined using a 100 bp molecular weight ladder. The sensitivity, specificity and negative likelihood ratio (NLR) as well as the significance of the differences between sensitivities obtained among groups were calculated using commercial software (Calc v. 12.3.0.0 -MedCalc Software, Ostend, Belgium). Also the Kappa statistic was estimated to determine the agreement between the two methods. Kappa value of 1 indicates absolute agreement, whereas a value of 0 indicates that agreement occurs due to chance agreement. In general, Kappa values higher than 0.6 indicate a good level of agreement. In this study, k-values were calculated using commercial software (Graph Pad Prism v.6-Graph Pad Inc., San Diego, CA).",

Although both methods are highly specific (Schmitz et al., 2009) , they are characterized by low sensitivity probably due to the presence of high antibodies titres in the intestinal lumen which may bind to virions and lead to false negative results (Desario et al., 2005) .

The high sensitivity of PCR allows the detection of animals shedding CPV at low titres in the faeces. This can result in the timely introduction of measures for prophylaxis and prevention from epizootics in overcrowded spaces. Moreover, conventional PCR provides quick results, i.e., within 6 h (Decaro et al., 2005a) . However, positive results that do not correspond to natural infection may occur due to vaccine-induced faecal shedding of the CPV. Modified live-virus vaccinations are very common and CPV vaccine persistence in the organism has not been studied thoroughly. Since, no gold standard has been established for the detection of CPV in faeces and PCR is the most sensitive assay, it serves as the reference method in the present study (Schmitz et al., 2009) .",

In fact, a good performance of the method is demonstrated when NLR value is <0.1, while NLR >0.5 suggests a poor performance. For the total number of samples, as well as for the samples of unvaccinated animals, NLR was high, but it was adequately low for the immediately tested samples.

This fact leads us to comment that negative results do not exclude parvoenteritis from the differential diagnosis, but a positive result almost certainly indicates CPV infection. Furthermore, the in-clinic immunochromatographic assay's sensitivity is increased when the samples are examined immediately after collection. This study confirms the findings of a previous research, which demonstrated that a similar assay produced negative results on faecal samples from vaccinated animals (Decaro et al., 2014) . Consequently, the Rapid Diagnostic Kit of Canine Parvovirus, Coronavirus and Rotavirus antigen (Quicking \u00ae ) can be used for early diagnosis of parvoenteritis, to exclude the presence of the pathogen, but in questionable cases, faecal samples should be sent for further laboratory investigation. Apart from that, veterinary practitioners should always keep in mind that a correct diagnosis is based on a combination of history, clinical signs, biochemical parameters and positive faecal results. As CPV continues to be a serious lethal threat to puppies worldwide, additional research is required to further facilitate the etiological diagnosis of parvoenteritis.",
