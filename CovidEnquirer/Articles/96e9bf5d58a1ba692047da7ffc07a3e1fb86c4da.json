A truncated version of S glycoprotein, containing only the ecto-domain, as well as a His-tagged full-length version were cloned and expressed in a serum-free insect cell line, ExpresSF+ \u00ae . The proteins, purified to apparent homogeneity by liquid column chromatography, were formulated without adjuvant at 3, 9, 27, and 50 g per dose in phosphate saline and used to immunize mice. Both antigens in each formulation elicited a strong immune response after two or three vaccinations with the antigen. Neutralizing antibody titers correlated closely with standard ELISA reactivity against the S glycoprotein. The truncated S protein was also formulated with an adjuvant, aluminum hydroxide, at 1 g per dose (\u00b1adjuvant), and 5 g per dose (\u00b1adjuvant). Significantly enhanced immune responses, manifested by higher titers of serum ELISA and viral neutralizing antibodies, were achieved in adjuvanted groups with fewer doses and lower concentration of S glycoprotein. These findings indicate that the ecto-domain of SARS-CoV S glycoprotein vaccine, with or without adjuvant, is immunogenic and induces high titers of virus neutralizing antibodies to levels similar to those achieved with the full S glycoprotein vaccine.",

A Phase I clinical trial using killed-whole SARS-CoV vaccine has been conducted by Sinovac Biotech Ltd. However, concerns have been raised for the use of inactivated virus vaccines based on observations with feline coronavirus. There are also several subunit vaccines in pre-clinical development, targeting SARS-CoV structural proteins, including the spike (S) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Other vaccine candidates include vector-based DNA vaccines [7-11], a combination of whole killed virus and DNA vaccines [12], inactivated whole virus vaccines [13, 14] , a combination of DNA and S-peptide vaccines [15] , and other recombinant proteins and their fragments. 0264-410X/$ -see front matter",

The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S glycoprotein has been mapped to residues 318-510 [20] [21] [22] . A complex structure of RBD and soluble ACE2 was determined at 2.9\u00c5 [23] .

The 5 one-third of the ORF (Front), containing the N-terminus, was cloned into a baculovirus transfer vector pPSC12 (Protein Sciences Corporation, PSC), downstream from the baculovirus very late promoter of the polyhedrin gene. The insert was also in frame with the chitinase secretion signal sequence. The remainder of the gene was cloned into pUC18.

Each adjuvanted dose (50 l) contained 80 g of aluminum, or 1.6 mg/ml, equivalent to 800 g of aluminum in a 0.5-ml human dose. Due to competition of divalent cation phosphate for Al(OH) 3 binding, phosphate concentration of the formulation buffer was reduced from 20 mM (first study) to 2.5 mM. At this concentration, at least 95% of TM S in 5 g dose (5 g/50 l or 100 g/ml) was adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide (80 g/50 l or 1.6 mg/ml) (data not shown). AlPO 4 (\"ADJU-PHOS,\" Accurate Chemical and Scientific Corporation, Westbury, NY), was also evaluated for TM S absorption and was found to be less efficient for aluminum hydroxide binding than Al(OH) 3 (data not shown).",

This is encouraging since highly purified proteins by themselves may be poorly immunogenic or non-immunogenic [36]. The first pre-clinical study of the TM S protein vaccine was conducted to address several questions, including safety, immunogenicity, ability to elicit SARS-CoVneutralizing antibody, dose escalation, and comparison with His-tagged full-length S glycoprotein. Immune responses as determined by ELISA were strong, with GMTs as high as 300,000 and plateaued around 200,000 ( Fig. 2A) . SARS-CoV-neutralizing antibody titers averaged around 1:200 (Fig. 3A) . Within each group the GMT increased with increased dose number or increased antigen concentration. While there was no clear difference observed between 3 and 9 g doses, and the 27 and 50 g doses, a trend is evident.",

It enhances immunogenicity by converting soluble protein vaccines into particulate mass to make them more suitable for ingestion by antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages [36] . The adjuvant potential of aluminum hydroxide was explored in the second mouse immunogenicity study. As shown in Fig. 3B , adjuvant effect was obvious in both 1 and 5 g TM S + Alum groups on Day 30 after the second administration. There were several fold differences in titer between adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted groups. Similar observations were obtained in VN GMT. The 1 g adjuvanted dose induced an immune response equivalent to that of 50 g nonadjuvanted dose, suggesting that formulation of TM S with aluminum hydroxide results in a dramatic improvement in immune response. It was however observed that even with the inclusion of adjuvant, multiple doses were required to elicit a strong antibody response.",
