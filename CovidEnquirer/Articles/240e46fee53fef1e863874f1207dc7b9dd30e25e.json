            "text": "It is generally agreed that respiratory disease is closely related to ambient air quality and weather conditions. Besides, hygiene related factors such as the public health measures by the government and possible personal awareness in the community can also affect the spread of infectious respiratory diseases. However, there is no quantitative support for this conclusion, because of lack of quality data. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (or SARS) outbreak in 2003 triggered strict public health measures and personal awareness in the prevention of infectious respiratory diseases, providing us an opportunity to quantify the impact of hygiene related factors in the spread of the disease. In this paper, we model the number of the respiratory illnesses by a semiparametric model which models the environmental and weather impacts using a multiple index model and the impact of other public health measures and possible personal awareness using a growth curve with jump. Using data from Hong Kong, we found that public health measures contributed to about 39% of reduction in the number of respiratory illnesses during the SARS period. However, the impact of hygienically related factors eventually fades as time passes. The results provide indirect quantitative support to the usefulness of governmental campaigns to arouse the awareness of the public in staying away from transmission of respiratory diseases during the full outbreak of the disease. The results also show the fast fading of alertness of Hong Kong people towards the epidemic. Furthermore, our model also offers a way to model the impacts of environmental factors on respiratory diseases, when the data contains the effect of human intervention, by introducing the change point and growth curve to remove such an effect.",

            "text": "It is widely agreed that the exposure to ambient air pollution may cause serious respiratory illnesses (Katsouyanni et al., 1996; Navrud, 2001; Aunan and Pan, 2004; Neuberger et al., 2004; Scoggins et al., 2004; Jalaludin et al., 2004; Maynard, 2004; Lee et al., 2009 ) and that weather conditions may also contribute to the seriousness (Smoyer et al., 2000) . Several statistical models have been used to assess the impacts of air quality and weather factors on respiratory illnesses, including simple statistical correlation analysis, regression method, meta-analysis, spatial analysis and nonparametric statistical models such as the generalized additive model (GAM). However, quantifying the effects of various pollutants as well as weather conditions is always a difficult task due to the high unknown nonlinearities on the impact of these environmental and weather factors on the onset of the respiratory illnesses and possible interactions amongst these factors. Nonparametric regression is a powerful tool to model unknown functional relationships. With the consideration of a possible incubative period and/or cumulative effects, we need to consider the lags of potential factors that result in a large number of covariates in the regression. In order to avoid the so-called 'curse of dimensions' referring to the inaccuracy when the multivariate function is estimated nonparametrically, some statistical tools have been developed so as to let the model determine the best combinations in the sense of their contribution to the regression. Representative models include a varying/functional coefficient model (Chen and Tsay, 1993; Hastie and Tibshirani, 1993) , regression graphics (Cook, 1998) , sliced inverse regression (Li, 1991) , single index model (H\u00e4rdle and Stoker, 1989 ) and multiple index model (Xia et al., 2002) . In this paper, we will adopt the multiple index model for our data, following Xia et al. (2002) and Shao et al. (2010) .",

            "text": "From the data collected in Hong Kong, we observed an unusual change in the number of respiratory illnesses in early 2003, while all other air quality and weather data were relatively stable. The change coincides with the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (or SARS). The background and severity of this disease is briefed below. SARS is a respiratory disease in humans and is caused by the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). It was first reported in Asia in February 2003. Over the following few months, the disease spread to more than two dozen countries in North America, South America, Europe and Asia before the SARS global outbreak of 2003 was contained. According to the World Health Organization's (WHO) concluding report on 21 April 2004 (see http://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/table2004_04_21/en/index.html), this major outbreak consisted of 8096 known cases with 774 deaths (a mortality rate of 9.6%). Hong Kong was the most seriously affected area in terms of population size (6.8 million) and land area (1100 km 2 ). There were 1755 cases in total (1 case per 4000 population with 977 females and 778 males) with 299 deaths (a mortality rate of 17%). The source of infection was traced back to an infected Guangzhou professor who arrived in Hong Kong in late February 2003. During his stay in a hotel, the infection was spread to other guests and visitors, subsequently triggering off a chain of outbreaks in Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada and Vietnam. A detailed history and public health experiences can be found in Hong Kong's SARS Expert Committee Report (2003) and Cheng (2003) . The official announcement of the SARS epidemic was on 8 March 2003. The last case was reported on 2 June 2003. After an observation period of 20 days, Hong Kong was removed from the WHO's list of areas with recent local transmission of SARS on 23 June 2003. The WHO's research concluded that SARS was spread by close person-to-person contact. SARS-CoV is thought to be transmitted most readily by respiratory droplets of infectious persons when droplets from the cough or sneeze of the infectious persons are propelled a short distance (generally up to 3 ft) through the air and deposited on the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, or eyes of persons who are nearby. The virus also can be transmitted when a person touches a surface or object contaminated with infectious droplets and then touches his/her mouth, nose, or eye(s). In addition, it is possible that the SARS-CoV might spread more broadly through the air (airborne spread) or by other ways that are not known.",

However, community-or population-based health protection should be another important way to stop the spread of such infectious diseases but has not been addressed seriously before. During the SARS epidemic, Hong Kong's Department of Health introduced a large-scale health awareness program to publicize the importance of personal and environmental hygiene. The actions included wearing face masks in public by everyone, washing hands regularly (especially before touching mouth and eyes and having food). Official actions included cleaning surfaces in public areas such as handles and buttons with disinfectants regularly, and temperature checks at airports and other immigration ports. An educational campaign for personal and environmental hygiene was widely promoted by TV advertisements and posters in public areas (Leisure Cultural Services Department, 2003; Housing Authority, 2003; Leung et al., 2003) . Such public health measures showed great success in controlling the disease. Some measures in public areas have been kept in force until now. Therefore, the data provide us an opportunity to model the effect of strict hygiene related factors on respiratory illnesses. For the purpose of public health, it is very important and interesting to see how effective these public health measures are. By developing a method to handle data with sudden change(s) in modeling, we can also assess the change of the number of illness before and after the SARS epidemic. The results can be used as an indirect support of the effectiveness of such efforts by governmental and community campaigns.",

It is possible that the weekly pattern in the number of the respiratory illnesses confounds with similar patterns in air pollution. To check if it is the case, the box-plots of all the variables for each day of the week is given in Fig. 4 , from which it can be seen that only the number of admitted patients shows some weekly pattern, while all the air pollutants/weather variables show no weekly pattern (in fact, they remain quite constant over the day of the week). Therefore, the weekly pattern in the number of the respiratory illnesses could be modeled together with the pollutants/weather variables. ",

That is, the effect of public health measures as measured by the shift in the total number of illnesses. By noting the magnitude of impact decreases eventually over time due to many factors including behavioral and memory dynamics, the growth curves are widely used in psychological research to model the changes over time (Mcardle and Nesselroade, 2002) . The logistic growth curve is a special case of the generalized Richard growth curve (Richard, 1959) . A negative value of \u03be 1 indicates a reduction of the number of illnesses, meaning an effective impact of public health measures. A positive value of \u03be 3 means that the impact of public health measures will fade and vanish over time. We do not use the full Richard curve because it involves complicated computing due to a limit or embedded cases (Shao, 2002) and the special case here is good enough to fit the data. Bear in mind that we do not use the data during the SARS epidemic as it is highly unstable.

The shape and 95% confidence limits of the growth curve which model the effect of SARS over time is given in Fig. 5 which clearly shows the significance of the public health measure due to the SARS outbreak on the number of administration. However, the impact eventually fades over time as modeled by the logistic growth curve. The impact is obvious as nearly all the parameter estimates are significantly different from zero at 95% of the confidence level (Table 2) .

Following (Xia et al., 2002; Shao et al., 2010) , we regard coefficients with absolute value greater than 0.1 as significant coefficients. With this rationale, a simple way to interpret the results is to look for coefficients larger than 0.1. Let us call these coefficients as large coefficients. Bear in mind that the first dimension accounts the most contribution to the model. We can see that SO 2 , temperature and humidity are important factors for diseases, compared with NO 2 and OZ which have moderate contributions. The RSP and NO x are less important to the respiratory diseases in Hong Kong. The second dimension is set to model the variance which is not included in the first dimension. We can see that for the second dimension, SO 2 , NO x and Humidity are the major factors and RSP still does not show its importance.

The data from Hong Kong are used for this study as the 2003 SARS epidemic initiated a change of public health measures in the community due to government effort and public awareness. In addition, another possible driving force for maintaining individual hygiene habits during the epidemic was the power of the media. During the time of the SARS epidemic, all media (including newspapers, radio and TV) reported daily death cases due to SARS. This was probably a most effective way to alert people of the dreadful disease and the importance of having good hygienic habits. It was well observed that during the SARS period the people of Hong Kong followed the advice of the government on hygienic measures closely, such as wearing face masks in the public, washing hands frequently, avoiding going to the public in case of having a flu, etc. The effects of pollutants and climatic factors on respiratory diseases are complicated due to the latent effect, nonlinearity and interactions between factors. The multiple index model is used to model such complicated relationship due to it flexibility and ability of handling a large number of dependent variables. The results provide indirect quantitative support to the governmental awareness program during the outbreak of the epidemic, and also the effectiveness of the media in disease control. Another important observation, however, is that the growth curve starts to increase sharply near the end of 2003 (see Fig. 5 ), and has flattened before mid-2004. This means that the number of illnesses had reverted to pre-SARS levels in about 6 months' time. This in turn reflects the forgetfulness of Hong Kong people, or people in many large cities. Large city people are occupied with many attractions, when the immediate threat of an epidemic fades, their alertness will wane fast. The media's interest in the epidemic is also short-lived if it does not continue to cause casualties. This suggests strongly that public health organizations and officers have to frequently remind people to keep up with their hygienic habits, so as to minimize the damage of infectious diseases.",

Although it is possible to restrict the growth curve function to the maximum of zero by letting \u03be 3 \u2264 \u2212\u03be 1 , it is not a good exercise to implement such a restriction before clearer understanding of the short upward trend. Furthermore, our model setting has no problem to include more parametric terms such as a linear function of time for long-term trends.",
