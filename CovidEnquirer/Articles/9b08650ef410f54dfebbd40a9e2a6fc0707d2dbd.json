The RNA-binding activity of PKR appears to be selective for structure-specific ssRNAs such as adenovirus VA~ RNA, HIV TAR RNA, and reovirus s l mRNA (18, 19) . Northwestern analysis of substitution and deletion mutant PKR proteins expressed in E. coli as TrpE fusion proteins clearly defined the N-terminal 98 amino acids of PKR as both necessary and sufficient for RNA-binding activity (10, 11) . Furthermore, a repeated subdomain core of 20 amino acid residues, predicted by computer algorithms to be an amphipathic a-helix, was identified within the N-terminal RNAbinding region of PKR. This core sequence, designated motif R, was present at amino acid positions 55-75 and 145-166 of PKR (10) . The RNA-binding R motif is conserved in several viral and cellular proteins from both prokaryotic and eukaryotic sources, proteins now known to be dsRNA-binding proteins (10, 20) .",

Subsequently, a Western immunoblot analysis is carried out using the same filter membrane as was used for the Northwestern analysis in order to verify that comparable amounts of test proteins were present.

Reovirus s1(416-576) RNA is known to activate the autophosphorylation of PKR (21) , and thus was presumed to bind PKR. As shown by Fig. 1, 32p -labeled reovirus s 1 RNA selectively bound to TrpE-P1 fusion proteins that included the N-terminal region of PKR. The TrpE-P1 fusion proteins that possessed PKR amino acid residues 1-98, 1-372, or 1-413, when immobilized on nitrocellulose, all bound the 32p-labeled reovirus s l RNA probe. By contrast, TrpE-P1 fusion proteins that lacked the N-terminal 98 amino acid residues but included either the internal or C-terminal regions of PKR or amino acids 91-367 or 414-551, respectively, did not bind the reovirus sl activator RNA (Fig. 1) . In the case of HDV, the middle one third of delta antigen expressed as TrpE fusion was necessary and sufficient for binding of HDV RNA in the Northwestern RNA blot assay (2) . The specificity of RNA-binding detected by Northwestern RNA blot assay can be assessed by the use of competitor RNAs. For example, in the case of PKR, the binding of the 32p-labeled reovirus s1(416-576) RNA to TrpE-Pl(1-98) was competed by poly(rI)-poly(rC) but was not competed by total RNA isolated from human U cells (10) .",

The R motif first identified in human PKR is conserved in many other RNA-binding proteins, is often repeated, and represents the prototype for a new RNA-binding motif with the consensus sequence G-X-G-S/T-K-X-X-A/S-K-X-X-A-A-X-X-A-X-X-X-L (10, 17, 20) . Among the most highly conserved residues of the core R motif is a lysine residue, present at amino acid position 64 within the N-terminal proximal copy of R in PKR (10) . In order to assess the importance of the conserved core motif R in the RNAbinding activity of human PKR, lysine-64 was converted to glutamic acid by site- directed mutagenesis (11) . Serial dilutions of TrpE fused with the N-terminal 98 amino acids of PKR, either wild-type (Wt) PKR or the K64E substitution mutant, were first analyzed by the Northwestern assay. Although the TrpE-Wt(1-98) fusion protein efficiently bound RNA (Fig. 3, lanes 1-5) , the K64E substitution mutant protein TrpE-K64E(1-98) did not bind RNA, even at concentrations at least 20-fold higher than those of the TrpE-Wt(1-98) protein (Fig. 3, lanes 6-10) . The TrpE-Wt(91-367) fusion protein lacking the N-proximal copy of R, but retaining the more C-terminal variant repeat of the R motif, likewise was unable to bind RNA as measured by the Northwestern assay (Fig. 3) . The TrpE-Wt(1-372) fusion protein that included both copies of the core motif R efficiently bound RNA (Fig. 3, lane 16) . These results suggest that the N-proximal copy of the R motif is both necessary and sufficient to confer RNA-binding activity to TrpE as measured by the Northwestern assay. This result was confirmed by gel-mobility shift analysis of the full-length 551amino-acid PKR protein (Fig. 4 ). The full-length catalytic subdomain II K296R(1-551) mutant, which lacks kinase catalytic activity (23, 39) , bound 32p-labeled adenovirus VAI RNA in the gel mobilityshift assay (Fig. 4, lane 2) , whereas the ability of the K64E/K296R(1-551) double mutant to bind RNA was greatly diminished (Fig. 4, lane 4) . Thus, the K64E substitution was sufficient to severely impair RNA-binding activity of the PKR protein, measured both by the Northwestern assay using truncated PKR TrpE fusion protein immobilized on nitrocellulose (Fig. 3) and by the gel mobility-shift assay with fulllength PKR protein in solution (Fig. 4) .",

This is exemplified by the results shown in Fig. 5 . PKR proteins isolated by quantitative immunoprecipitation from extracts of vector-transfected COS cells were fractionated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose, and subjected to sequential Northwestern and Western blot analyses. The same nitrocellulose filter blot was first used to measure the RNA-binding activity of PKR proteins by Northwestern RNA blot analysis with 32p-labeled RNA probe; then, after removal of the RNA probe, the amount of PKR protein present on the filter membrane was quantitated by Western analysis with [~25I]protein A and polyclonal antibody probe against PKR. . However, because RNA-binding activity as measured by the Northwestern assay is sensitive to pH, false-positive responses may occur at pH below 6.5 (8) . Also, because the candidate target proteins first are resolved by SDS-PAGE, the Northwestern assay may not be suitable for proteins whose RNA-binding activity depends on a dimeric structure, particularly a heterodimeric structure in which the two subunits possess different mobilities in SDS-PAGE gels. Therefore, it is important to attempt to confirm RNA-binding results obtained by the Northwestern RNA blot assay with results obtained by a second independent approach, for example, the gel mobility-shift assay (32a).",
