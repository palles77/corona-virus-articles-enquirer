Disaggregation of heat shock-induced SINT-speckles is independent of de novo protein expression and autophagy, Related to Figure 3.

Representative pictures are shown. Scale bars = 10 \u03bcm. cells were transfected to express Flag-SINTBAD and co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed. After identification of co-immunoprecipitating proteins by mass spectrometry, the specifically interacting proteins were defined according to the criteria indicated above. (B) U2OS cells were transfected to express the SINTBAD interactor PTPN23 either alone or together with Flag-tagged SINTBAD, followed by treatment with arsenite as shown. Immunofluorescence was used to reveal the intracellular localization of the proteins. Scale bar = 10 \u03bcm. Reconstituted U2OS cells stably expressing Flag-SINTBAD were treated with ULK1-and ULK2-specific Accell siRNAs. Three days after siRNA transfection, one aliquot of the cells was analyzed for efficient mRNA knockdown by qPCR using primers specific for ULK1 and ULK2, respectively. Gene expression values were normalized to transcription of the \u03b2-Actin encoding gene (ACTB), ULK1/2 expression in the control cells transfected with scrambled siRNAs was set as 1. ",

Beads were washed five times with 2 ml IGEPAL lysis buffer, transferred to a fresh tube and proteins were eluted at 70 \u00b0C for 10 min in LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen). Samples were separated on a 4-12 % Bis-Tris gradient-gel (NuPAGE, Invitrogen), stained with colloidal Coomassie (Invitrogen) and cut into small pieces (7 slides each lane). In-gel digestion of the proteins with trypsin and purification of the peptides was performed as described (Seibert et al., 2019) . Peptide solutions were desalted by stop and go extraction (STAGE) tips (Rappsilber et al., 2003) . The purification and mass spectrometry of two individual experiments was performed with a time lag and therefore analyzed with different instrumental settings. Dissenting setting parameters of analysis 1 and 2 are indicated by a slash. Samples were eluted from STAGE tips with acetonitrile and applied to the UHPLC system (EASY-nLC 1000, Thermo Fisher Scientific) in 0.1 % formic acid. Separation of peptides by hydrophobicity was performed with 50/18 cm in-house packed C18 columns (1.9 \u00b5m C18 beads, Dr. Maisch GmbH). Peptide elution was achieved with a binary solvent system (solvent A: 0.1% formic acid; solvent B: 80% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) by increasing the relative amount of B from 10 % to 38 % in a linear gradient within 35/20 min, followed by 5/3 min up to 60 % and another 5/2 min to 95%. Re-equilibration was done within 5 min at 5 %. The samples were transferred to an in line coupled QExactive orbitrap/QExactive HF mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) using a nano electrospray ionization source. Full MS spectra were acquired with a data-dependent Top10/15 method that comprised a resolution of 70,000/60,000 at 200 m/z and an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 3e6 at a maximum injection time of 20 ms. The 10/15 most intense ions were further fragmented with higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) at a normalized collision energy of 25/27 and MS\u00b2 spectra were generated at 35,000/30,000 resolution, AGC target of 5e5/1e5 and maximum injection time 120/64 ms.",

Cells were stimulated with 0.5 mM arsenite for 1 h, harvested and fractionated into cytosolic (cyto.) and nuclear/insoluble (nucl./insol.) extracts. Western blotting was performed to detect the adapter proteins, controls for successful cell fractionation (histone H3 and Tubulin) and cell stimulation (ERK1/2-P). The positions of molecular weight markers are indicated. .Fig. S2. Generation of SINTBAD-and/or AZI2-deficient U2OS cells, Related to Figure 1. (A) U2OS cells were transfected with a px459 plasmid encoding a sgRNA targeting the second exon of the AZI2 gene or the first exon of SINTBAD. After selection of non-transfected cells with Puromycin, individual cell clones were grown and analyzed by Western blotting using AZI2-and SINTBAD-specific antibodies. The AZI2 antibody also detects a non-specific band which is indicated by an asterisk. Double-deficient U2OS cells were generated by transfecting the sgRNA against AZI2 into SINTBAD knockout cells. (B) Genomic DNA was isolated from SINTBADdeficient cell clones and double-knockout cells. The respective genomic region encompassing the Cas9 cleavage site was amplified by PCR and sequenced as shown. The position of homozygous insertion of a nucleotide base in comparison to the wt sequence is highlighted in blue. . Fig. S3.

Three days after siRNA transfection, half of the cells were seeded on coverslips and used for immunofluorescence staining and the remaining cells were analyzed for efficient knockdown by real time qPCR, using the following primers specific for ACTB (5\u00b4-CATGTACGTTGCTATCCAGGC-3\u00b4, 5\u00b4-CTCCTTAATGTCACGCACGAT-3\u00b4), ULK1 (5\u00b4-ACCCCATTACTGCGAACCTGGA-3\u00b4, 5\u00b4-GCACGAACAGCAGCGTGAAGC-3\u00b4) and ULK2 (5\u00b4-TCTGCATCACCATGTGCAAGAA-3\u00b4, 5\u00b4-AACATCTCATCCAGGGCT-3\u00b4).",
