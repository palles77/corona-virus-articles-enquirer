Nevertheless, given its relative simplicity, studying the virus has always been more tractable. As outlined in the previous chapters, virus-centric approaches have yielded a tremendous amount of information about viral genetics, viral replication cycles, and host and tissue tropisms. Along the way have come insights into host innate and adaptive immune responses and the many ways in which viruses antagonize these responses while exploiting other cellular processes to their advantage. In the last decade, however, new opportunities to study the host response have emerged. In 1990, the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Energy announced a plan to map and sequence the human genome. Eleven years later, the first draft of the genome was released, and in 2003, the project was declared complete.",

Indeed, the first published application of large-scale genomic profiling in virology was essentially this simple; the study examined the transcriptional response of primary human fibroblasts at three time points following infection with human cytomegalovirus (Zhu et al., 1998 ). Yet even this simple experimental plan, which monitored the expression of approximately 6000 genes, revealed not only the complexity of the host response, but also the complexity of data interpretation. Changes in transcript abundance can be due to changes in synthesis, stability, or degradation and such changes may or may not correspond to changes in protein abundance or activity. The transcriptional response is dependent upon time, cell type, virus, and other parameters. Even today, the biological function of many genes is unknown. And with the number of transcripts profiled by current technologies numbering in the tens of thousands, the computational requirements for data analysis are considerable.",

The authors concluded: \"The global analysis of changes in mRNA levels provides a catalog of genes that are modulated as a result of the host-pathogen interaction and therefore deserve further scrutiny.\" To a large extent, this forward-looking statement also sums up what is perhaps the main challenge associated with genomic profiling. The global analysis of transcription produces a catalog of differentially expressed genes, and oftentimes this catalog is extremely large. Investigators must devise strategies to sift through these catalogs and determine which genes deserve further scrutiny. Ideally, genomic profiling should also do more than produce lists; it should reveal interrelationships between genes, the structure and activity of gene networks, and the function of genes for which no role has been previously ascribed. There is also meaning to be gained from patterns within the data.

The convergence of genome sequence information, profiling technologies, and computational advances made it possible to examine biological systems on a scale never before possible. However, the concepts underlying systems biology, and an understanding of the need to comprehend complete systems, have deeper roots. The notion of emergent properties-properties or outcomes that cannot be predicted by an understanding of the individual parts of a system alone-dates back at least to the time of Aristotle (384-322 BC), who stated: \"the whole is something over and above its parts and not just a sum of them all.\" Nevertheless, reductionism-the idea that complex systems can be analyzed and understood by reducing them to manageable pieces-held sway through much of modern history. In the early 1900s, views began to change. It became apparent, for example, that biological systems have hierarchies of organization, and that components of a system behave differently in isolation than when in the intact system (Trewavas, 2006) .",

            "text": "The first known use of the term systems biology, and its proposal as a distinct discipline, is attributed to Mihajlo Mesarovic in his 1968 book Systems Theory and Biology. Then, as now, systems biology was met with some skepticism. A reviewer of the book noted: \"There is no doubt that system-theoretic ideas seem somewhat strange, and perhaps just a little frightening, to the present generation of structurally-oriented biologists\" (Rosen, 1968) . The current concept of systems biology-driven by genome-based technologies and mathematics-is most often associated with Leroy Hood, founder of the Institute for Systems Biology. Hood proposed that biological systems are composed of two types of information, genes and networks of regulatory interactions, and that biology be viewed as an informational science (Ideker et al., 2001) . In this view, studying biological systems requires detailed knowledge of the components of the system, systematic perturbation of the system, monitoring of gene, protein, and pathway responses, and the formulation of mathematical models to describe the system and its response to perturbation (viral infection being an example of such a perturbation). Today, systems biology has become a driving force in biology and medicine, although it is still often criticized for being too focused on data acquisition. As put by Nobel Laureate Sidney Brenner: \"Everybody wants to measure everything, you'll never get anything out of it.\" Such criticisms may eventually be muted, however, as systems biology continues to evolve, driven currently by rapid advances in computing, mathematics, and network modeling, which will be essential to making complex systems comprehensible. nitrocellulose membranes. These first \"arrays\" have since been replaced by commercially available platforms in which tens of thousands of oligonucleotides are arrayed at high density on glass slides or other solid supports. (Protein microarrays and protein-protein interaction profiling are discussed in Chapter 12, The Virus-Host Interactome.) Yet even the wealth of information available through the use of microarrays cannot compare to the level of information obtained through the direct sequencing of RNA transcripts (RNA-seq). Next-generation sequencing, a sequencing-by-synthesis approach that has replaced the first-generation Sanger sequencing method, is capable of yielding a truly comprehensive view of the transcriptome (discussed in more detail in Section 6 of this chapter; Sidebar 2).",

Cell culture experiments facilitate the rapid examination of multiple time points or viruses, and they are useful for examining and modeling intracellular signaling in response to infection. However, the limited phenotypic parameters that can be studied using cultured cells-viral replication or cytopathic effect-makes it difficult to study viral pathogenesis. In contrast, with an animal model, it is possible to measure a variety of disease parameters-e.g., virus yields, clinical signs, gross pathology, histopathology, and time to recovery or death-and the cells or tissues that are examined come from their natural environment. Of course, these benefits are balanced by the cost, ethics, and complexity of animal models.",

The Southern blot gave rise to the \"reverse\" dot blot, in which synthetic oligonucleotides of known sequence (called probes) were immobilized on permeable membrane supports. The collection of DNA sequences to be analyzed (called targets) were then labeled and applied to the membrane under hybridization conditions. The use of permeable membranes, however, made it difficult to control the size and shapes of the spotted DNA and limited miniaturization. These limitations were overcome by the introduction of solid supports, which provided the ability to accurately control the size, shape, and location of the spots. The robotic spotting of cDNAs onto glass slides-the first of what we now know as microarrays-was pioneered by Patrick Brown at Stanford University (Schena et al., 1995) . In an interview with Discover magazine, Brown explained that when he applied for a grant to develop the technology: \"The microarray part was thoroughly rejected\u2026but I just decided that I would make one anyway.\" Importantly, the use of solid supports also facilitated the development of methods for the in situ synthesis of nucleic acids on the surface using approaches such as ink jet fabrication (spotting droplets of nucleotide reagents instead of droplets of ink) or photolithographic methods (similar to those used in the semiconductor industry). Today, major commercial providers of microarrays include Affymetrix, Agilent Technologies, Illumina, and NimbleGen, with platforms varying in the length of oligonucleotide used, the number of oligonucleotides representing each gene, and the methods used for oligonucleotide synthesis and attachment to solid supports. Microarray technology has also been adapted for the profiling of noncoding RNA expression, DNA methylation, and single nucleotide polymorphisms, as well as for promoter analysis and the detection of genome-wide DNA copy number variation.",

            "text": "Similarly, transcriptional profiling of gene knockout cells or animals can be used to evaluate the role of specific genes in the host response to infection. These studies reveal both the changes in gene expression that occur as a result of the gene knockout as well as the effect of the knockout on the host response. Often, these studies also reveal the existence of compensatory signaling mechanisms, which can complicate data interpretation. A slight twist on this approach has been used to study Mx1, an interferon-induced gene that confers resistance to influenza virus infection. Mx1 is lacking in most laboratory strains of mice, and these animals are highly susceptible to many strains of influenza virus, including the reconstructed 1918 pandemic virus. Transcriptional profiling of the lungs of 1918 virus-infected wild-type BALB/c mice (which lack a functional Mx1), and knock-in mice carrying a functional Mx1, demonstrates profound differences in gene expression, which correlate with reduced mortality in Mx1 +/+ mice (Cilloniz et al., 2012) . Treatment of Mx1 +/+ mice with interferon prior to infection increases survival to 100% and is associated with an increase in the expression of genes related to intercellular signaling or cellular movement and a decrease in the expression of inflammatory cytokine and chemokine genes ( Figure 1 ). Here, transcriptional profiling, attached to a relatively straightforward study design, yielded information on the function of Mx1 in mediating resistance to influenza virus and on the role of interferon signaling in this process. In the example above, differentially expressed genes are viewed as a heat map, where relative increases or decreases in gene expression are depicted using color gradations, and genes that exhibit similar patterns of expression are grouped together (through the use of various clustering algorithms). Once differentially expressed genes are identified, it is important to know the biological or biochemical function of their encoded products. For many genes, this information can be obtained from a variety of public (e.g., DAVID, maintained by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases) or proprietary (e.g., Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) databases. These databases bring together information about individual genes from multiple sources, including the scientific literature and other databases. DAVID, for example, includes over 40 annotation categories, including gene ontology, protein-protein interactions, protein functional domains, disease associations, and tissue expression.",

This means that considerable information may be lost if data analyses do not move beyond a survey of genes with already known function.

This has been particularly well studied in the case of influenza virus. This virus is renowned for its ability to continually generate new variants, and although most variants cause a relatively mild respiratory disease, others can cause severe and even fatal infections. The 1918 pandemic virus, for example, caused over 50 million deaths worldwide, making it responsible for one of the deadliest infectious disease outbreaks in human history. Since the late 1990s, highly pathogenic avian H5N1 influenza viruses have caused sporadic infections in humans (popularized in the news media as bird flu) with a mortality rate estimated at 60%. Transcriptional profiling of lung tissue from mice or macaques experimentally infected with highly pathogenic influenza viruses has revealed that these viruses elicit a rapid induction of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine genes, an event often referred to as a cytokine storm. These genes remain highly expressed until the death of the animal. In contrast, animals infected with less-pathogenic viruses exhibit a rapid induction of interferon and innate immune response genes, a response that resolves over time as the animals recover. In macaques, the 1918 virus also induces a disproportionate induction of genes associated with the inflammasome, a group of genes that are thought to be part of a protective innate immune response to influenza viruses. Excessive activation of the inflammasome, however, appears to be detrimental rather than protective. In mice, highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses also down-regulate anti-inflammatory genes, including Alox5, responsible for the biogenesis of lipoxins, and Socs2, encoding a suppressor of cytokine signaling that can be induced by lipoxins to control the inflammatory response. This excessive and sustained inflammatory response appears to promote immunopathology.",

Using what is referred to as a top-down systems analysis approach (the breaking down of a complex system into finer details), transcriptional profiles were first obtained from whole lung and then from individual immune cell populations isolated from the lungs of mice infected with lethal or nonlethal influenza virus. Rather than focusing on specific gene expression changes, transcriptional data were organized into 50 modules consisting of genes with coordinate patterns of expression ( Figure 2) . A module of genes annotated as highly proinflammatory was uniquely associated with lethal infection. This inflammatory signature was shown to largely originate from neutrophils that rapidly migrate to the site of infection (which is poorly contained in the case of the lethal virus). The authors suggest that this initiates a chemokine-driven feed-forward pathway in which the first neutrophils at the scene release chemokines that attract additional neutrophils, resulting in a rapidly escalating inflammatory response and tissue damage. In support of this finding, attenuation of this self-amplifying process by experimental reduction (but not elimination) of neutrophil numbers increased survival without changing viral spread.",

This has come primarily from studies of various nonhuman primate species infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). Natural hosts for SIV, such as sooty mangabeys and African green monkeys, do not develop AIDS when naturally or experimentally infected with the virus. In contrast, Asian monkeys, such as rhesus or pig-tail macaques, develop AIDS following SIV infection. Several independent transcriptional profiling studies have shown that natural hosts for SIV exhibit an innate immune response to the virus that is comparable to that exhibited by Asian macaques. Initial levels of viral replication are also comparable. However, in natural hosts the innate immune response is of limited duration, whereas in macaques the response is sustained (Figure 3 ) (Jacquelin et al., 2009) . This leads to chronic immune activation, which is associated with progression to AIDS in SIVinfected macaques and in HIV-infected individuals.",

The question remains as to why natural host species are able to resolve the initial response to SIV, whereas macaques (or most HIV-infected individuals) cannot. One hypothesis, proposed as the West Coast Model of immune activation, suggests that the kinetics of activation holds the key (Benecke et al., 2012) . The West Coast Model likens virus infection to a wave on the beach, and immune activation as the mounting of a surf board. Mount too early or too late and bad things happen. If correct, the model has important implications for AIDS vaccine design as it suggests that the question of whether an adaptive immune response can be mounted against SIV (or HIV) could be irrelevant. Rather, it may be beneficial to devise strategies to modulate the timing or duration of the response, or to prevent chronic immune recognition of the virus. (Additional information on the kinetics of HIV and SIV infection and lessons learned from natural host species can be found in Chapter 9, HIV and AIDS)",

Liver disease caused by hepatitis C virus (HCV), for example, can take decades to develop and is often asymptomatic until disease has progressed to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. At that point, transplantation may be the only remaining treatment option. Diagnosis is additionally hampered by the lack of reliable noninvasive detection methods as an alternative to percutaneous liver biopsy. A biomarker or genomic profile that could be detected in the blood is therefore highly desirable for early diagnosis of liver disease. A variety of individual candidate blood biomarkers have been identified, such as aspartate and alanine aminotransferases, albumin, and alkaline phosphatase. These biomarkers provide information about liver function, but values can sometimes be normal in people with liver disease or damage, and these tests do not provide information about disease etiology. Unfortunately, diagnostic genomic signatures in blood have been hard to come by, and studies have therefore focused on the identification of such markers in liver tissue. Although profiling liver gene expression does not get around the need for a liver biopsy, the hope is that genomic profiles will be predictive in advance of tissue injury. There have been a number of reports of liver gene expression signatures, ranging from a half dozen to several hundred genes, which may be prognostic for hepatocellular carcinoma and that may be useful for risk-adjusted surveillance approaches (Hannivoort et al., 2012) .",

The cancer research field has been aggressive in developing large-scale systems biology resources, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), the International Cancer Genome Consortium, and The Cancer Proteome Atlas. The field is also driving the development of new mathematical and modeling methods for studying the relationship between intracellular signaling and the behavior of cells at the tissue level, and for the imaging of cells to determine how their spatial orientation and interactions with the environment interplay with gene expression patterns and tumor behavior.

Moreover, most medically important viruses have small genomes, so the number of potential targets is limited. In contrast, treating viral infection by targeting the host increases the number of targets and decreases the likelihood that resistant viruses will emerge. Targeting host factors may also increase the likelihood that the drug will be effective against a wider spectrum of viral pathogens. The analysis of coexpression networks using approaches such as centrality analysis is one way to identify potential host targets (such as DCI in the example above).

These proteins have functions in a variety of cellular processes, including innate immunity, chemokine signaling, cell-to-cell communication, and cellular transport. Among the bottleneck proteins identified were two endoplasmic reticulum proteins, RTN1 and RTN3. These proteins are present in very low density lipoprotein transport vesicles, which have been reported to play a role in the production and release of infectious HCV. In cell culture assays, knockdown of RTN1 and RTN3 using siRNA has no effect on viral RNA levels, but significantly reduces viral titer. As regulators of viral propagation, RTN1 and RTN3 may be novel targets for anti-HCV therapy and perhaps more broadly as therapeutic targets for other viruses that depend upon lipoprotein vesicles for the release of infectious virus.",

The staggering amount of information available through sequencing is exemplified by the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project, funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute. The overall goal of the project is to identify and characterize all functional elements in the human genome, including cataloging of the complete repertoire of RNAs produced by human cells. The project has revealed that as much as three quarters of the human genome is capable of being transcribed and that cells contain many varieties of RNA transcripts (Djebali et al., 2012) . These include polyadenylated and nonpolyadenylated transcripts, known and unannotated protein-coding transcripts, and long noncoding RNAs (>200 nucleotides) such as intergenic transcripts. Small noncoding RNAs (<200 nucleotides) are also abundant, including microRNAs (miRNAs), piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs), small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs), small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs), and transfer RNAs. Indeed the transcriptional landscape is so complex that it has called into question the very definition of a gene! Virologists are beginning to explore the ramifications of this newfound transcriptional complexity on viral pathogenesis. In one of the first studies to do so, RNAseq was used to profile the host response to infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Peng et al., 2010) . In the lungs of mice infected with this virus, over 10,000-long noncoding RNAs were identified, and nearly 1500 were differentially expressed in response to infection. Comparable expression profiles were observed in cell lines infected with influenza virus or treated with type I interferon, suggesting that these RNAs may be involved in the innate response to a variety of viruses. Similar analyses that focused on the sequencing of small RNAs revealed that SARS-CoV infection also induces the differential expression of different classes of small noncoding RNAs.",
