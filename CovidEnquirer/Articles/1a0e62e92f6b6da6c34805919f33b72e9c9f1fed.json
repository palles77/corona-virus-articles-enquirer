It is worth noting that national control and eradication campaigns against Brucella abortus infection in cattle played, and continue to play, an important global role in expanding the veterinary profession. More recently, the worldwide spread of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus during the last 20 years has had a marked economic impact on the swine industry. As a consequence, PRRS is currently one of the most intensively researched diseases of livestock.",

            "text": "The induction of parturition in pregnant cows during the last 6 weeks of gestation by the parenteral injection of corticosteroid with or without prostaglandin F2\u03b1 (PGF2\u03b1) has raised the question of animal welfare and of the possible effects of prematurity on the disease resistance of the newborn calf. The induction of premature parturition in cattle has found application in the following areas: \u2022 With pastoral-based dairy production, synchronization of the calving period has allowed maximal utilization of seasonally available pastures by the synchronization of peak demand for dry matter intake with spring flush in pasture growth. In pastoral-based herds with breeding for seasonal calving, late-calving cows will be induced and these average approximately 8% of the herd. \u2022 Ensuring that calving coincides with the availability of labor to facilitate observations and management of calving and to overcome the inconvenience caused by late-calving cows. \u2022 Minimizing dystocia in small heifers and animals with exceedingly long gestation periods (past due). \u2022 The therapeutic termination of pregnancy for various clinical reasons. \u2022 As an aid in the control of milk fever in combination with parenteral administration of vitamin D analogs. A variety of short-acting and long-acting corticosteroids have been used. A single injection of a short-acting formulation is used when it is desirable to induce calving within the last 2 weeks of gestation. Earlier in pregnancy short-acting corticosteroids were found to be insufficiently reliable to induce parturition, which has led to the common use of long-acting corticosteroid formulations. A variety of protocols to induce premature parturition (3-6 weeks before due date) are used in practice; the main issue is the poor predictability of the time of calving relative to treatment when using long-acting corticosteroids. Common protocols use a second treatment with shortacting corticosteroids or the administration of PGF2\u03b1 50 to 10 days after the initial treatment. The use of PGF2\u03b1 at least 9 days after treatment with long-acting corticosteroids was found to reliably narrow down the calving time, with the great majority of all cows calving within 72 hours of PGF2\u03b1 treatment. 1 The use of PGF2\u03b1 did not improve the viability of the premature neonates or their survival rate.",

The calves born earlier in pregnancy after using long-acting corticosteroid are usually lighter in weight, lethargic, and slow to stand and to suck properly. The serum immunoglobulin concentration was found to be lower in calves born from dams induced with longacting corticosteroids because of interference with intestinal absorption by the corticosteroid. Up to 60% of calves born following induction with long-acting corticosteroids are at risk for failure of transfer of passive immunity. The colostrum available to such calves also has a reduced immunoglobulin content, and there may also be a reduction in the total volume of colostrum available from the induced-calving cows. Immunoglobulin absorption rates were not impaired when short-acting corticosteroids are used to induce calving close to term.",

Subsequent reproductive performance of induced cows can be impaired. A risk for acute gram-negative bacterial infections is reported in a low (0.3%) proportion of cows following induction with dexamethasone. The use of longacting corticosteroids was also associated with a higher incidence of photosensitization in treated heifers. 2 In a study where partus induction was systematically used in cows that exceeded a gestation length of 282 days, no detrimental effects on calf viability, cow health, and productive and reproductive performance during lactation were found compared with untreated control animals. The incidence of retained fetal membranes in untreated animals was not recorded in this study and could thus not be compared with treated animals. 2 When parturition is induced in large herds of beef cattle, particularly with a high percentage of heifers, increased surveillance will be necessary after the calves are born to avoid mismothering. Every attempt must be made to establish the cow-calf pair (neonatal bond) and move them out of the main calving area. Heifers that disown their calves must be confined in a small pen and be encouraged to accept the calf and let it suck, which is sometimes a very unrewarding chore. Calf mortality can be very high where calving is induced earlier than 35 weeks of pregnancy.",

The use of PGF2\u03b1 for partus induction in mares has been discouraged because considerable risks such as premature placental separation and foal death that have been associated with this treatment. 3 Induction of parturition in the mare is not without risk and has been associated with the birth of foals that are weak, injured, or susceptible to perinatal infections. The period of fetal maturation is relatively short in the horse and is considered to be the last 2 to 3 days' gestation. Because spontaneous parturition in healthy mares can occur between 320 and 360 days, there is the risk of delivering a foal that is premature and nonviable. Fetal maturity is the major prerequisite for successful induced parturition, and the three essential criteria are \u2022 A gestational length of more than 330 days \u2022 Substantial mammary development and the presence of colostrum in the mammary gland with a calcium concentration greater than 10 mmol/L \u2022 Softening of the cervix The rise in calcium concentration is the most reliable predictor of fetal maturity and milk calcium concentrations above 10 mmol/L, in combination with a concentration of potassium that is greater than sodium, are indicative of fetal maturity. Commercial milk test strips are available for estimating mammary secretion electrolyte concentrations; however, it is recommended that testing be done in an accredited laboratory.",

If the suck reflex was weak or absent and the foals were unable to establish righting reflexes, the prognosis of survival was poor.

Infection of moose with B. abortus biovar 1 is highly fatal, and it is likely that the moose is a dead-end host for brucellosis. Experimental inoculation of the organism into badgers results in the development of antibodies and elimination of the organism, which indicates that the badger is relatively resistant to infection and unlikely to be a reservoir of the organism. Bison and elk are potential reservoirs of bovine brucellosis and have been associated with recurrence of bovine brucellosis in the Greater Yellowstone area in the United States. Brucellosis associated with B. abortus was first detected in bison (B. bison) in Yellowstone National Park in 1917 and has been present ever since. Bison can remain latently infected with virulent B. abortus until attainment of reproductive age despite extensive use of vaccination and serologic testing.",

The seroprevalence in the Yellowstone bison and elk population is estimated with 40% to 60% and 22%, respectively. 8, 9 This has been associated with physiologic and immunologic characteristics common to bovine species but is probably also caused by typical behavioral patterns of large social groups and the periparturient behavior of bison dams that tend to calve within groups that facilitate disease transmission through direct contact around parturition. 10 In contrast elk dams segregate themselves during the periparturient period and meticulously clean the birthing site, considerably reducing the risk of disease transmission through direct contact. 11 Disease transmission may, however, be common during the abortion period in the last trimester of pregnancy from February to April, when many elk congregate in large groups on lower elevation winter habitat that overlaps with cattle-grazing areas. 11 From 2009 to 2011 eight infected cattle or captive bison herds were detected in Wyoming and Montana and all episodes were genetically or epidemiologically linked to elk, suggesting that spillover transmission from elk to cattle is epidemiologically more important than transmission from bison to cattle. 11 This has been explained with the continuously increasing elk population, which is currently above management target values in many areas of the Greater Yellowstone area and the greater mobility of free-ranging elk. 10 Horses In horses the organism is often found in chronic bursal enlargements as a secondary invader rather than a primary pathogen. It is commonly present with Actinomyces bovis in fistulous withers and poll evil. It has also been identified as a cause of abortion in mares. A serologic survey of horses over a period of 8 years revealed that 8% to 16% of serum samples were positive. However, experimentally infected horses do not excrete the organism in sufficient numbers to infect susceptible in-contact cattle.",

The frequency of latent infections is unknown, but may range from 2.5% to 9%.

Such observations have resulted in the recommendation that calves from seropositive dams should not be used for breeding. Even vaccinated heifers from seropositive dams can harbor a latent infection.

Most crossreacting antibody from exposure to bacteria other than Brucella spp. or environmental antigens consists mainly of IgM. Serologic tests that measure IgM are therefore not desirable, because false-positive results occur. Because IgG 2 and IgA antibodies accumulate later after exposure and are usually present in small and inconsistent amounts, the main isotype for serologic testing is IgG 1 .",

The serum of infected cattle contains high levels of IgM, IgG 1 , IgG 2 , and IgA isotypes of antibody. Most animals vaccinated between 4 and 8 months of age return to a negative status to the test within a year. All are considered to have a relative immunity to infection. Calves from cows that are positive reactors to the test are passively immunized via the colostrum. The half-life of colostral antibodies to B. abortus in calves that have received colostrum from either vaccinated noninfected or infected dams is about 22 days. It is possible that some calves remain immune sufficiently long to interfere with vaccination. After vaccination of cattle with strain 19 of the organism, IgM antibodies appear after about 5 days, reaching peak values after 13 days. IgG 1 antibodies appear a little later or simultaneously with IgM, and peak values are reached at 28 to 42 days, after which they decline. The same general pattern follows experimental infection with virulent strains and also in chronic field cases, except that IgM antibody declines to low levels and residual activity resides in IgG 1 and IgG 2 as well as in IgA, which remain at higher levels.",

Erythritol, a substance produced by the fetus and capable of stimulating the growth of B. abortus, occurs naturally in greatest concentration in the placental and fetal fluids and is responsible for localization of the infection in these tissues. Invasion of the gravid uterus results in a severe ulcerative endometritis of the intercotyledonary spaces. The allantochorion, fetal fluids, and placental cotyledons are invaded, and the villi are destroyed. The organism has a marked predilection for the ruminant placenta. In acute infections of pregnant cows, up to 85% of the bacteria are in cotyledons, placental membranes, and allantoic fluid. The resulting tissue necrosis of the fetal membranes allows transmission of the bacteria to the fetus. The net effect of chorionic and fetal colonization is abortion during the last trimester of pregnancy. The characteristic pneumonia in aborted fetuses is caused by localization of perivascular foci in the interlobular septa of the lung, indicative of hematogenous spread in the fetus rather than aspiration of contaminated fetal fluids. Fetuses inoculated with sufficient numbers of B. abortus will abort 7 to 19 days postinoculation. With experimental conjunctival exposure of pregnant heifers with the organism, the numbers of infected animals and the number of tissue samples positive for the organism are increased as fetal age at exposure increases from gestation days less than 127 to more than 157.

The result has been the development of a very extensive range of tests, each of which has its own special applicability. The salient features are as follows. For beef cattle, screening of herds can be achieved by collecting blood at abattoirs and submitting it to the RBT or tube agglutination test. Reactors are traced back to the herd of origin, and the herd is tested. In heavily infected herds, it is best to remove all cows positive to the RBT even though it is highly sensitive and there will be a small percentage of false-positive cows. In herds where the prevalence of infection is low and where vaccination has been used, this procedure will eliminate too many false-positive cows.

The iELISA can be useful in conjunction with the CFT during the later stages of an eradication program, when it is important to reduce the number of false-negative serologic reactions that contribute to the persistence of problem herds. The iELISA has an excellent sensitivity and specificity but cannot distinguish between the antibody response induced by vaccination with B. abortus strain 19 and natural infection.

The fluorescence polarization assay (FPA) can be done almost anywhere using a portable analyzer, which receives power from a laptop computer, using serum, milk, or ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) anticoagulated blood. The FPA technology has been developed and validated for the serologic diagnosis of brucellosis in cattle, pigs, sheep, goats, bison, and cervids. Sufficient cross-reactivity of the common epitopes of B. abortus, B. melitensis, and B. suis OPS has allowed for the use of a single antigen for all species of smooth Brucella and animals. The FPA was initially developed for testing serum; however, the technology has been extended to testing whole blood and milk from individual animals or bulk tank samples pooled from 2000 or fewer animals. The accuracy results of the FPA equals or exceeds those obtained using other serologic tests such as the buffered antigen plate agglutination test, the milk ring test, the CFT, the IELISA, and the C-ELISA. Validation of studies of the FPA and the C-ELISA for the detection of antibodies to B. abortus in cattle sera and comparison to the standard agglutination test, the CFT, and the iELISA, found that the FPA is highly superior. It offers a clear advantage because it is easy to use.

The spleen may develop lymphoid hyperplasia and histiocytic and plasmacytic expansion in the germinal centers, and the mammary gland usually has a pronounced interstitial lymphoplasmacytic mastitis.

This overcomes the main disadvantage of the test and disposal method of eradication, in which infected animals must be discarded immediately to avoid spread of infection. B. abortus strain 19 has a low virulence and is incapable of causing abortion except in a proportion of cows vaccinated in late pregnancy. Strain 19 is a smooth B. abortus strain expressing the O-antigen on its LPS. Antibody produced in response to vaccination will interfere with diagnostic assays identifying this antigen, which is a major problem with the use of these vaccines. Another weakness of the vaccines is that it cannot completely prevent infection. 18 Strain 19 vaccines are normally administered to female calves between 3 and 8 months old as a single subcutaneous dose of 5 to 8 \u00d7 10 10 organisms (calfhood vaccination).

All cattle should be permanently identified, security between subherds must be good, vaccination histories must be accurate, and accurate round-up (mustering) of cattle must be possible. Quarantine facilities for infected subherds must be strict and absolutely reliable, and fence lines must be impenetrable. The development of a twoherd system, based on segregation of weaned heifer calves from adult cows and maintenance of testing pressure on the adults, will reduce the chance of infection of heifers. All calves from reactor dams are discarded, which necessitates positive identification. Only bulls or semen from brucellosis-free herds should be used in clean herds.

In young animals these are not necessarily visible and will depend mainly on the age, sex, and physiologic state of the animals at the time they are infected. The organism then appears in the bloodstream, usually within 1 to 7 weeks, and often lasts for 5 weeks but can persist for up to 34 weeks. However, infection with B. suis differs from that associated with B. abortus in that localization occurs in several organs in addition to the uterus and udder, and the organism is found in all body tissues and produces a disease similar to undulant fever in humans. The organisms persist in lymph nodes, joints, bone marrow, and the genital tract. The more common manifestations of localization are abortion and infertility caused by localization in the uterus; lymphadenitis, especially of the cervical lymph nodes; arthritis and lameness caused by bone and joint localization; and posterior paralysis caused by osteomyelitis. In boars, involvement of the testicles often leads to clinical orchitis, and the boars are probably infected for life.

Abortusovis infection has a worldwide occurrence with a generally low prevalence. The infection appears to be more common in some European and Western Asian countries. Transmission and spread of the infection occurs through infected animals that are introduced to flocks naive to the pathogen. The reservoir of infection is infected animals that do not abort. The organisms persist in internal organs of the asymptomatic carriers for up to 6 months and are excreted in the feces and vaginal mucus for periods up to 4 months. Infection can occur through the oral, conjunctival, or respiratory route, but oral ingestion is thought to be the main mode of infection. Venereal spread has been postulated, and rams certainly become infected, but all the evidence is against spread at coitus. Intrapreputial inoculation results in infection of rams and the passage of infected semen for up to 15 days.",

Septic metritis and peritonitis in dams has been associated with deaths among ewes. Spread of the disease is strongly associated with the presence of aborting ewes and subsequent heavy environmental contamination. In flocks where the pathogen is endemic, abortion occurs sporadically, mainly affecting primiparous and newly introduced ewes. The infection appears to induce a strong immune response preventing abortion during the following pregnancies. 1 Identification of the disease depends on isolation of the organism, which is present in large numbers in the fetus, placenta, and uterine discharges. Use of PCR to identify S. Abortusovis is feasible because the organism has an IS200 element in a distinct chromosomal location. The resulting PCR assay has high specificity for S. Abortusovis, effectively discriminating it from other S. enterica serovars. The disease can be diagnosed in fetuses by using a coagulation test on fetal stomach contents.

A spectacular example is the 2007 to 2010 epidemic in the Netherlands, in which over 3000 notifications of human disease were analyzed and only 3.7% of people had worked in agriculture or slaughterhouses. 11 This outbreak was attributed to airborne transmission of contaminated dust originating from dairy goat farms located in densely populated areas. The number of human cases abruptly declined after control measures were implemented on the goat and sheep farms, including vaccination, the mass culling of more than 50,000 pregnant does and ewes on infected farms to reduce shedding of the organism, and mandatory PCR testing of bulk tank milk for C. burnetii. 11 Living close (<2 km) to a large dairy goat farm that had an abortion storm caused by Coxiella burnetii was identified as the major risk factor for human cases during the Netherlands epidemic. 12 Coxiellosis in humans is referred to as Q-fever and is often asymptomatic, but can result in acute disease characterized by fever, general malaise, headache, and less commonly, pneumonitis, hepatitis, and meningoencephalitis. Endocarditis, hepatitis, and osteoarticular diseases are manifestations of chronic disease in around 2% of human infections. 11 Those at most risk of chronic disease are immunocompromised individuals and pregnant women. There is a concern that the prevalence of infection in farm animals is increasing and spreading geographically, so that there is a greater risk for human infection, particularly when dairy farms are located near urban populations. Epidemics of human infection have been documented in several countries including Australia, France, Germany, the United States, Bulgaria, the UK, and the Netherlands. 11 C. burnetii is considered a potential agent for bioterrorism because of its survival in the environment, the ease with which it can be transmitted by aerosol and wind, and the very low infectious dose.",

In the Netherlands, a seasonal epidemic of animal and human C. burnetii infections occurred in 2007, but was no different from several previous isolated outbreaks in Europe. Subsequently, the unexpected scale of the outbreak in 2008 meant that national and regional public health authorities were largely unprepared for the expanding epidemic. 5, 18 The response in the Netherlands was to cull all pregnant dairy goats on affected farms before the 2010 kidding season, without reference to individual testing, and to vaccinate dairy goats and dairy sheep. 18, 19 A retrospective analysis identified that testing pregnant goats by PCR or ELISA, followed by culling only the positive goats, would not have effectively reduced the massive bacterial shedding on these farms because many infected goats would not have been detected. 20 Inactivated Phase 1 vaccines show a good and persistent antibody response, suggesting that vaccination should limit the excretion of the organism. However, there is little economic incentive for vaccination of livestock when an outbreak of coxiellosis is not occurring, and a vaccine for livestock is not available in many countries. A systematic review and meta-analysis of investigations into the use of inactivated Phase 1 vaccines, such as used in the Dutch outbreak, found a significantly reduced risk of shedding in vaginal mucus, uterine fluids, milk, and feces of vaccinated goats exposed to infection compared with controls. However, it was concluded that there was no reduction in the risk or amount of shedding in vaccinated ewes compared with unvaccinated ones. 21 Vaccination of humans has reduced infection rates in high-risk groups and is used in the appropriate circumstances in Australia, such as workers on goat and sheep dairy farms, abattoir workers, veterinarians, and veterinary students.",

Both microorganisms have been isolated from the vulva of animals with granular vulvovaginitis, and the disease could be transmitted experimentally. M. bovigenitalium infection has further been associated with infertility, abortion, and birth of weak calves. 1 These infections adversely affect reproduction when they are either acute or chronic; along with producing granular vulvovaginitis, some strains can, if introduced to the upper reproductive tract, cause transitory endometritis and salpingitis. Because U. diversum is a normal inhabitant of the upper respiratory tract and the lower urogenital tract of ruminants, contamination of fetal membranes or fetal tissue submitted to the diagnostic laboratory should be considered. 2 The diagnosis of U. diversum as a causative agent for abortion should therefore ideally be based on isolation of the pathogen from fetal lung tissue, stomach content, or placenta, coupled with the presence of compatible lesions in the lung and placenta. 2 Ureaplasmas, M. bovis, and M. bovigenitalium have been found in the reproductive tract of bulls and their semen. Using PCR for the detection of mycoplasma in semen, M. mycoides subsp. mycoides SC (the causative agent of the contagious bovine pleuropneumonia) has been found in semen of yearling bulls with seminal vesiculitis.

            "text": "Equine coital exanthema is a venereal disease associated with infection of equids by equine herpesvirus-3 (EHV-3). The genome of EHV-3 has been sequenced. 1 The disease is highly contagious and has economic importance because of disruptions to breeding programs on stud farms when stallions have clinical signs or there is an outbreak of disease among mares. The economic impact is greatest in those breeds or studbooks, such as Thoroughbreds, that do not permit artificial insemination of mares. 2 Transmission is usually venereal from affected or clinically normal carrier animals in which the infection is thought to be latent in sciatic ganglion. 3 The virus is highly contagious, and outbreaks among mares in an embryo transfer facility in which both donor and recipient mares were affected is strongly suggestive of iatrogenic spread by personnel or on equipment such as ultrasound probes. 2 Inapparent or latent infection is apparently common, with 14% of 220 Thoroughbred mares on a stud farm having EHV-3 genome detectable by PCR in swabs of the perineum and vagina and 48% having serum antibodies to the virus. 3 The virus can be excreted intermittently by infected mares, although the factors determining reactivation have not been determined. 3 Efforts to demonstrate that administration of corticosteroids induces reactivation of EHV-3 shedding are inconclusive. 4 The disease can be reproduced experimentally with more severe disease and longer shedding of the virus in mares that are seronegative at the time of infection than in seropositive mares. 5 The disease is relatively mild and causes only local signs manifested by papular, then pustular, and finally ulcerative lesions of the vaginal mucosa, which is generally reddened. The ulcers can be as large as 2 cm in diameter and 0.5 cm deep and are surrounded by a zone of hyperemia. In severe cases the lesions extend onto the vulva and the perineal skin to surround the anus. There can be pain on passage of feces, and the anorectal lymph nodes are enlarged. 2 In the male, similar lesions to those on the perineum of the mare are found on the penis and prepuce. Many mild cases are unobserved because there is no systemic disease and affected horses eat well and behave normally. The effect on fertility is equivocal although there might be a loss of libido during the active stage of the disease in stallions. The incubation period is 2 to 10 days and the course up to complete healing of ulcers is about 14 days, although depigmented lesions on the perineum can persist for months. 3 EHV-3 has been associated with unilateral rhinitis in adult horses examined with the same endoscope. All horses were affected unilaterally and in the nostril through which the endoscope was passed. 6 Diagnosis can be achieved by use of virus isolation or demonstration of viral DNA in skin lesions or swabs of the vaginal or perineal regions. 3 Secondary bacterial infection can lead to suppurative discharge and a longer course. In some outbreaks lesions occur on the skin of the lips, around the nostrils, and on the conjunctiva and can also be present on the muzzle of the foal. Ulcerative lesions of the pharyngeal mucosa also occur in infections with EHV-2 and with equine adenovirus. Ulcerative lesions of the oral mucosa are of great importance because of the necessity to diagnose vesicular stomatitis early.",

It then went to North Carolina in the United States possibly in wild boar. It is thought that the most likely date for a common isolate of the European strains is before 1981. The two species of PRRSV then developed separately on the two continents. Some evidence of this comes from a study of the number of nucleotides in open reading frame 7 (ORF7) of the virus from the United States (372 nucleotides), and the European virus (Lelystad types) had 387 nucleotides, but the Lithuanian strains that were collected had 378 nucleotides.",

ORF1a and ORF1b comprise 80% of the genome and encode polyproteins that are processed to 14 nonstructural proteins (nsps) 7 by viral proteases. ORF 2a, ORF2b, ORF3, ORF4, ORF5a, and ORF5-7 encode eight structural proteins: GP2a, GP2b, GP3, GP4, ORF5a, GP5, matrix protein (M), and nucleocapsid (N). 8, 9 All of these structural proteins have been shown to be important for virus infectivity because of their critical roles in virion assembly and/or interaction with cell-surface receptors. 8 N-linked glycosylation of GP5 is critically important for virus replication. 10 The heterodimer consisting of the GP5 and M proteins is required for infectivity of arteriviruses. GP5 plays a key role in viral entry by interacting with the host cell receptor. 11 ORF2b is also essential for virus infectivity and is likely to function as an ion channel to facilitate uncoating of the virus. 12, 13 GP3 is found in type 1 and 2 viruses. 14 One other protein, (N) or nucleocapsid, synthesized by ORF7 is highly immunogenic and has been used for most antibody studies. It is found in the cytoplasm and the nucleus in which it has an important role in antagonizing cellular gene function. The more recent type 2 strains still exhibit variability in sequence and pathogenicity. 15 A novel structural protein in PRRSV has been discovered to be encoded by an alternative ORF5, and this protein is referred to as ORF5a and is expressed in infected cells. Pigs infected also express ORF5a antibodies. It is found in all PRRSV subgenomic RNA5 genes as an alternative reading frame and in all other arteriviruses, which suggests that it may play an important role. 16 There is evidence of recombination between vaccine and wild-type PRRSV strains. 17 There is an exceptional diversity in PRRSV strains in Eastern Europe, 18 which is developed from European viruses and the use of attenuated virus vaccines (containing North American viruses) and these are associated with new genetic subtypes.",

The genetic dissection of complete genomes of type 2 PRRS viruses isolated in Denmark over 15 years has been described. 21 The virus arrived at the same time as Ingelvac PRRS-MLV, and since then the viruses were found to be 94.0% to 99.8% identical to the vaccine strain. The nucleotide identity was 90.9% to 100% for ORF5 and 93.0% to 100% for ORF7. There was wide diversity in the nsp2 with some deletions in the NSP2 region. The analysis showed that all Danish isolates belonged to a single cluster (sublineage 5.1) resembling the type 2 prototype isolate VR-2332.",

This epidemic has affected over 2 million pigs in China, with over 400,000 deaths. 31 A further 140,000+ pigs with 40,000 deaths occurred between January and July 2007. 32 A similar outbreak in Vietnam caused huge losses in 2007. 33, 34 The genetic variation and pathogenicity of a highly virulent PRRSV has been described. 35 The genomic diversity of Chinese PRRSV isolates from 1996 to 2009 has been described. 36 They are divided into four highly diverse groups, and it is suggested that they developed from the domestic Chinese viruses by gradual variation and evolution. A new variant has since been described. 37 The complete genome sequences of two other variant PRRSVs isolated from vaccinated pigs have been described. 38 The high pathogenicity (HP)-PRRSV strain has become the predominant strain in China. 39 This virus has undergone rapid evolution and can circumvent immune responses induced by currently used vaccines.",

Although the seroprevalence may be high in herds in some regions, the incidence of clinical disease is lower and variable. Although the number of herds with the acute form of the disease has been decreasing, the infection is now endemic in many herds, characterized by increased mortality and suboptimal performance in nursery pigs, with active spreading of the virus mainly in nurseries. In endemically infected herds, subpopulations of infected animals may exist consisting of a low prevalence (<10%) of seropositive animals in the breeding animals and a high prevalence (>50%) of seropositive nursery piglets. The elimination of these susceptible subpopulations, by exposing all members of a population to the virus, is used as a control strategy in large herds in which there may be subpopulations of highly susceptible breeding females. The virus can persist in nonpregnant sows and be transmitted to naive in-contact sows. A PRRSV strain may persist in a herd for up to 3.5 years displaying as little as 2% variation in ORF5 during this period. In 78% of herds with multiple submissions, genetically different strains were identified within 1 year of the original identification. Virulent PRRSV isolates exhibit longer viremias but not more elevated levels; they induce higher death rates and cause more severe clinical signs in a respiratory disease model. More virulent strains grew to significantly higher levels in pigs than did cell culture-adapted isolates.

The effects of the virus on reproductive performance are strain dependent. Strains of the virus cross the placenta when given to pregnant sows, and most sows will remain clinically normal and farrow normally. However, depending on the strain used, the number of late-term dead fetuses from gilts infected experimentally at 90 days' gestation may vary widely, and all gilts become viremic and develop antibodies. There are also marked differences in pathogenicity for the respiratory tract between U.S. strains of the virus compared with the Lelystad virus when inoculated experimentally into 4-week-old cesarean-derived colostrum-deprived pigs.

This view is not universal in that infection with the virus did not increase the severity of experimental M. hyopneumoniae (MH) infection in young piglets. However, in the laboratory investigation of PRDC the most potent combination of agents is PRRSV and MH. A model of the dual infection has recently been described in which MH was shown to predispose to PRRSV infection.

These herds were then vaccinated with a modified live virus vaccine licensed for use in pigs 3 to 18 weeks of age. Boars entering artificial insemination units were also vaccinated. Following vaccination, a large number of herds experienced an increased number of abortions and stillborn piglets and an increasing mortality in the nursing period. The problems occurred mainly in herds without clinical signs among sows and with sows with low antibody titers in the period immediately before vaccination. The PRRSV was isolated from fetuses and identified as the vaccine virus. The evidence suggested that the vaccine virus had spread to nonvaccinated sows followed by transplacental infection of the fetuses. Spread of the vaccine virus was also demonstrated in a nonvaccinated and previously virus-free breeding herd. There are three main methods of spread: 76, 77 The effect of temperature and relative humidity on an aerosol of PRRSV has been calculated, and it is more stable at lower temperature and/or lower humidity. 78 In a study of aerial transmission, 79 it was found that 21/21 aerial samples were positive from exhaust gases from an experimentally infected pig group. Five of 114 long-distance samples were positive and were collected 2.3, 4.6, 6.6, and 9.1 km from the experimentally infected herd. Interestingly, only PRRSV variant 1-8-4 was detected, whereas 1-18-2 and 1-26-4, the other two strains given to the source pigs, were not detected. A production region model to assess the airborne spread of PRRSV has been produced by the same team. 80 Animal age, MH coinfection, and PRRSV isolate pathogenicity did not significantly influence the concentration of aerosol shedding. The shedding of PRRSV in aerosols may be isolate dependent. 81 A production region model has been used to assess the airborne spread of PRRSV. 82 The median infectious dose of PRRSV via aerosol exposure has been described. 83 The MN-184 isolate was far more infectious than the VR-2332 isolate.",

There is a preferential expansion of certain clones bearing certain H chain third complementary lengths. The same dominant B-cell type clones occur throughout the body.

PRRSV infection modulates the leukocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar fluids. Following infection the number of CD8+ cells increased in systemic lymphoid tissue, whereas numbers of B cells increased in mucosal associated lymphoid tissue. Virus infection induces a simultaneous polyclonal activation of B cells mainly in the tonsils and an exaggerated and prolonged specific humoral immune response caused by persistent viral infection in lymphoid organs.

It is a hapten/hemoglobin scavenger in the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich superfamily. Other factors also appear to be necessary for PRRSV permissiveness. 100 The initial step in infection involves heparin sulfate glycosaminoglycans as an initial attachment receptor and subsequent engagement of the Siglec sialoadhesin resulting in a virus internalization via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The viral membrane M and the M/GP5 complex were identified as ligands for the initial attachment receptor. Sialic acids present on the surface of the PRRS virions have been shown to play an essential role in PRRSV infection. Recently CD163 was identified as a key receptor and involved in the entry into macrophages. 101 In a recent study, 102 it was suggested that expression of CD163 on macrophages in different microenvironments in vivo possibly may determine the replication levels of PRRSV and the virus pathogenicity.",

There are four of these pathways that have been identified, and one of these is the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway.

They are usually activated by IL-2, IL-12, IL-15, IL-18, and IFN-\u03b1 and by the interaction between NK activating receptors and their ligands on target cells. 134 One of the components of reduced NK cell activity is the possibility that there is incomplete activation of NK cells by a lower level of activating cytokines. 135 PRRSV-infected pulmonary alveolar macrophages showed a reduced susceptibility toward NK cytotoxicity, and this may represent one of the multiple evasion strategies of PRRSV. 133 Replicating PRRSV in both infected and contact pigs was responsible for rapid modulation in NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity and alteration in the production of important immune cytokines. These changes produce a delay in adaptive immunity. At 2 DPI 50% of viremic pigs had a greater than 50% reduction in NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and nearly a onefold increase in IFN-\u03b1 was found in the blood of some pigs. Enhanced secretion of IL-4 was found in 90% of pigs and IL-10 and IL-12 in a few pigs. IFN-\u03b3 was not enhanced. There was a reduced frequency of myeloid cells, CD4+ CD8+ T cells, and CD4\u2212 CD8+ T cells, and upregulated frequency of lymphocytes bearing natural T-reg cell phenotype were detected in viremic pigs. 136 This is associated with a decrease in cytotoxicity but not the number of NK cells (increased IL-4, IL-10, and IL-12). 136 Regulatory T cells (induced by type 2 but not type 1 PRRS) also impair the host. [137] [138] [139] [140] There is a decrease in the number of antigen-presenting cells and T cells in the tonsil and lymph nodes of PRRSV-infected pigs, suggesting a modulation of the host immune response. 141 CD14 + monocytes may also infiltrate the interstitial tissue in the lung and develop into interstitial macrophages. The early development of subneutralizing or nonneutralizing antibody may have a significant effect on the development of PRRS by antibodydependent enhancement, which can facilitate the attachment and internalization of the virus onto host cells through Fc receptormediated endocytosis. 142 A higher expression of proinflammatory cytokines is also expressed in septal macrophages in pigs. 122, 143 T-regs 143 control the immune response and maintain homeostasis and are natural or induced. Induction of T-regs during the early stage of PRRSV infection is one of the ways pathogens escape the immune response. 138, 139, [144] [145] [146] [147] Cytokines Many cytokines influence the immune response to PRRSV infection (Table 18-3) . TNF-\u03b1 may act as an antiviral cytokine protecting cells from infection by an IFNindependent mechanism, and several strains of PRRSV have a low ability to induce the expression.",

Four possible phenotypes were identified, but different cells had different capabilities. In addition, cytokine-release profiles on antigen-presenting cells could induce different expressions of cell markers. 121 Certain regions of nsp2 also downregulate IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1. 148 The inhibition of early cytokine production contributes to the weak innate immune response, delayed neutralizing antibody, slow IFN-\u03b3 response, and a depressed cytotoxic T-cell response. 149 In PRRSV infections, the production of proinflammatory cytokines is limited. 150 The nsps may downregulate TNF-\u03b1. 151, 152 IL-10 inhibits the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines as well as inhibiting the production of IFN-\u03b1, and may also suppress the proinflammatory response to PRRSVinfected pigs.

IFN-\u03b1 increased at 3 DPI, and IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12 were increased at 3 to 7 DPI and 14 to 17 DPI, but IL-10 was lower than the others suggesting that other factors also play a part. 153 Interferons PRRSV is able to downregulate the production of inflammatory cytokines such as type I interferons (IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-1). Pigs that can clear PRRSV early have early expression of these cytokines. 160 Five of the 13 nsps were found to inhibit IFN-\u03b2 promoter activation, particularly nsp1\u03b2 161 as well as TNF-\u03b1 promoter activity. 162 One of the mechanisms to suppress the immune response would be to suppress several key immune regulatory cytokines, such as type IFN, IL-1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-12, and IL-6, and upregulate to aberrant levels the antiinflammatory cytokines IL-10. 162 IFN-\u03b1 is an early response to PRRSV, but the virus circumvents the host innate response with an inadequate production of type I IFNs, resulting in a delayed IFN-\u03b3 production, cellular immunity, and neutralizing antibodies and a delayed viral clearance. 163 PRRSV is able to suppress the transcription of key antiviral genes, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2, when infection was antibody-dependent enhanced. This pathway of infection allows PRRSV to specifically target antiviral genes and alters the innate intracellular immune responses in macrophages. 164 The proposed model of how PRRSV nsp1 negatively regulates IFN-\u03b2 has been shown. 165 Plasmacytoid dendritic cells are not present in large numbers in blood but, when exposed to viruses, usually morph into dendritic cells but not when exposed to PRRSV and may help in the persistence of the virus. 166 In the bone marrow-derived monocyte cells, there was also a significantly increased secretion of IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and IFN-\u03b3 but not IL-12 or TNF-\u03b1. 167 Infection with PRRSV increased serum levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3. It also increased mRNA for the proinflammatory cytokines as well as the mRNA for TLR3, LR4, and TLR7 in the tracheobronchial tree. Most of the proinflammatory genes were also upregulated in the discrete brain areas. 168 PRRSV does not elicit a specific IFN-\u03b3 response in nonadult animals, and IFN-\u03b3 cells may be present in similar numbers in both infected and control animals. 169 PRRSV suppresses T-cell recognition of infected macrophages. 170 The ORF1a and ORF1b are translated to generate polyproteins, which are processed by viral proteases to form 14 different nsps. 7 Several of the nsps have been identified as integral members of viral replication and transcription machinery, whereas others might be involved in these processes through their interaction with host cell factors. 7, 171 The nsps are also likely to regulate viral pathogenesis through their involvement in modulation of host innate immune responses. The nsp1\u03b2-mediated subversion of the host innate response plays an important role in PRRSV pathogenesis. 172 The type I IFNs constitute a major player of the host innate immune system Viral replication intermediates like double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) are sensed by cytoplasmic (RIG-1-like helicases) as well as endosomal (TLR3) sensors, which trigger a complex signaling cascade. 173, 174 These signaling events result in an activation of several transcription factors including interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u03ba\u03b2 ) and activating transcription factor-2. These factors drive expression of type I IFN genes. Once secreted, they bind to receptors on the cell surface, which ultimately leads to the synthesis of IFN-stimulated genes. 175 Viruses have produced several measures to counteract the IFN production, 176 and PRRSV infection results in poor type I IFN production. The nsps of PRRSV inhibit IFNdependent transcription. The nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 proteins suppress both IRF3 and NF\u03ba\u03b2 -mediated IFN gene induction. 148, 177, 178 The nsp1\u03b2 also interferes with IFN signaling. 148, 179 The nsp2 is likely to play an important role in the subversion of innate antiviral defenses and provides a basis for elucidating the mechanisms underlying PRRSV pathogenesis. 180 The PRRSV nsp2 has a cysteine protease domain at its N terminal, which belongs to the ovarian tumor protease family and which appears to antagonize the type I IFN induction. 181 It also interferes with the activation and signaling pathway of type I IFNs by blocking nuclear translocation. 179 Certain regions of nsp2 are nonessential for PRRSV replication but may play an important part in modulation of the host immunity. 148 PRRSV nsp2 interferes with NF\u03ba \u03b2 signaling, which is important for its activation. 181 The virus lasts up to 5 months after infection in some lymphoid tissues. The levels of proinflammatory cytokines are also low, and the development of other effector components is slow (neutralizing antibodies and antigenspecific T cells). Therefore there is an inappropriate suboptimal initial innate response to PRRSV. 182 A nonsuppressive PRRSV virus could therefore be expected to stimulate a strong adaptive immune response. 183 The IFN inhibitory nature of PRRSV nsp1 in the context of virus infection was confirmed. 175, 184, 185 The nsp1 is cleaved into nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2, and the nsp1\u03b2 has the ability to inhibit IFN synthesis and signaling. 186 Type I IFNs (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2) promote production of antiviral mediators and elicit NK-cell activity for killing viral-infected cells. They also induce the maturation of dendritic cells into antigen presenting cells, macrophage development, and maturation and together with IL-6 convert B cells into plasma cells. 187 How this might be achieved by the PRRSV has been suggested. 178, 181, 188 Increased levels of IFN-\u03b1 at the time of challenge delays PRRSV viremia 189 and lessens the severity of the disease. That the presence of IFN-\u03b1 at the time of infection can alter the innate and adaptive immune responses was confirmed. 190 PRRSV encodes viral products that are able to suppress type I IFN production in different ways by interfering with the various transcription factors in the regulation of IFN expression. 172, 180, 181, [190] [191] [192] The impairment of type I IFN induction seems to be linked to a weak adaptive immunity, which includes a delayed or slow development of humoral and cellular immunity responses leading to viral persistence in infected pigs. 193, 194 Pigs infected with PRRSV had moderate interstitial pneumonia, and the virus was found in all tested tissues. Peak antibody response and IFN-\u03b3 occurred at 30 DPI with increased TGF-\u03b2 until 60 DPI. 128 The nsp2 inhibits the antiviral function of IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) 15. 195 IFNstimulated genes are the ISGs of which ISG15 is one of the most highly expressed proteins that functions as an effector molecule in the host cell response to viral infection.",

Both serum-neutralizing antibody and IFN-\u03b3 secreting cells were defective in experimental infections. 204 On the other hand, in the field, there are complex interactions of virus/host further complicated by interactions with bacterial agonists such as LPS.

The effects of the virus on reproductive performance are also strain dependent. There is no evidence that virus will grow in the ovarian tissues but may be taken into them by circulating macrophages. PRRSV can replicate in the testicular germ cells, but there is no evidence that there is any PRRSV in ova, indicating that the female gonad is resistant to persistent infection. Some strains are of low pathogenicity, whereas others are highly pathogenic. The reproductive disease has been reproduced experimentally, and the effects on the fetus are dependent on the stage of gestation. Aerosol exposure of nonimmune pregnant gilts to the Lelystad virus in late gestations (84 days) results in clinical disease. After an incubation period of 4 to 7 days, all sows are inappetent and listless for 6 to 9 days. Some sows develop blue-colored ears accompanied by abdominal respirations. Sows may farrow at days 116 and 117 of gestation, giving birth to dead, mummified, and live piglets. Many of the live-born piglets are pale, listless, and weak, and some are in respiratory distress and exhibit varying degrees of splayleg or muscular tremors. The virus may be isolated from stillborn piglets or those born alive. Antibody is present in precolostral serum samples or ascitic fluids of piglets, which demonstrates transplacental passage of the virus.",

Severe pulmonary lesions are present in fetuses inoculated in utero with the virus between 45 and 49 days' gestation. Even the lowest PRRSV exposure dose caused reproductive failure in naive, unvaccinated animals. When sows are inoculated oronasally with the virus in midgestation, the virus does not readily cross the placenta but replicates in fetuses that are inoculated directly in midgestation. It is suggested in prenatal piglets that PRRS replicates primarily in lymphoid tissues, having gained access to them from the placenta via the bloodstream. Thus the fetuses are more susceptible in late gestation than earlier in midgestation, or there is greater likelihood of transplacental infection during late gestation. Experimentally, the intrauterine inoculation of the virus into gilts on the day after natural breeding may have little or no effect on their reproductive performance. There appears to be no direct or indirect effect on luteal function contributing to PRRSV-induced abortion. The virus may cause cell death directly, such as the alveolar macrophages, or in lymphoid tissues. PRRSV affects Marc 145 cells, which undergo necrosis at a much higher rate than apoptosis, and increases with virus levels used to infect the cells. Apoptosis does occur in PRRSVinfected cells, but it is a late event during PRRSV replication and rapidly results in a necrotic-like death. Lesions have been seen in the placenta and in the vessels of the umbilical cord, but these are rarely reported with European strains, although they may be more common with the North American strains.",

Positivity was recorded in macrophages in lymphoid organs but also in the epithelium including gastric mucous membrane and mucous glands. 216 The HP-PRRS epidemic in China, the socalled high fever disease with nervous signs, has been on the increase in China since 2009. There was a nonsuppurative encephalitis with lymphohistiocytic perivascular cuffing and infiltration of leukocytes into the neuropil. The electron microscope showed that the virus that infected the endothelial cells crossed the blood-brain barrier into the central nervous system (CNS) and then induced cellular damage to the neurons and neuroglial cells. 217 An HP-PRRSV strain (HuN4) was shown to produce a loss of appetite, decrease in BW, raised body temperature, and respiratory signs. Lesions were of multifocal interstitial pneumonia with macrophage infiltration. The lesions in the lymph nodes were characterized by collapsed follicles, depletion of germinal centers, and reduction in lymphocytes. Perivascular cuffing and glial nodules were observed in some brains. PRRSV was detected in macrophages, alveolar epithelial cells, and vascular endothelial cells in the tonsil and lymph nodes. It is more pathogenic than some strains because of its higher replication rate. 218 Chinese and Vietnamese strains of HP-PRRSV cause different outcomes in U.S. swine. 53, 218 The Vietnamese virus replicated in an approximately 10-fold lower level in serum than did the Chinese virus. It also produced a lower temperature response and resulted in a lower mortality. The cytokine responses in a 9-plex panel varied between the strains, between the tissues examined, and by the inoculum dose. In this study, also using the U.S. prototype strain VR-2332, all three produced detectable levels of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3, IL-10, and IL-12p70, but the levels and the kinetics also differed. There was also a high sustained level of IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3, and these might impair effective immune clearance. 53, 219, 220 Polyclonal B-cell activation can result in IL-10 producing B cells. 221 PRRSV produces a polyclonal activation of B cells accompanied by a hypergammaglobulinemia.

Both may interact to reduce the efficiency of lung defense mechanisms and facilitate infection with P. multocida. There is little effect on H. parasuis secondary infection with a slight increase in macrophage uptake of H. parasuis during the early infection, which is reduced after 7 days. There is evidence that concurrent infection with transmissible gastroenteritis virus and PRRSV is likely to have little or no effect on subsequent shedding or persistence of infection. Infection with PRRSV is common in pigs with postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS), but there is no evidence that PRRS is necessary for the development of it. PRRSV has been seen in a swine herd with porcine cytomegalovirus. Synergism between PRRSV and S. Choleraesuis has been described with unthriftiness, rough hair coats, dyspnea, and diarrhea. Pigs that received dexamethasone were the most severely affected and half died, but they also shed significantly more organisms in feces and also had significantly higher PRRSV titers.

The proportion of virus-positive pigs and their level of viremia were higher at 4 days of age than at birth or weaning. The findings suggest that monitoring piglets in late lactation will enable assessment of the shedding of the virus from sows. 239 Landrace gilts when given PRRSV had a significantly reduced number of fetuses but a similar effect in crossbred pigs was not found. The Landrace had less weight loss during pregnancy, suggesting greater tolerance of PRRSV infection. Breeds do differ in phenotypic impacts of PRRSV. 240 Anorexia, lethargy, depression, and mild fever in pregnant gilts and sows are common initial clinical findings affecting 5% to 50% of animals. This is commonly followed by a sudden increase in early farrowings at 108 to 112 days' gestation, late-term abortions, stillborn and mummified fetuses, partially autolyzed fetuses, weak neonates with high mortality within a few hours or days after birth, late returns to estrus, and repeat breeders. This is generally followed by midgestation abortions and marked increases in the percentage of mummified fetuses, early embryonic death, and infertility. In large herds, successive groups of 10% to 20% of gilts and sows may become anorexic over a period of 2 to 3 weeks. Cyanosis of ears, tails, vulvas, abdomens, and snouts may occur in a small number of sows, which is more common in European outbreaks and uncommon in North America. Following the initial outbreak, a storm of reproductive failure may occur consisting of premature farrowings, late-term abortions, an increase in stillbirths, mummified fetuses, and weak neonates. This second phase of reproductive failure may last 8 to 12 weeks. Stillbirths may reach 35% to 40%. Weak-born piglets die within 1 week and contribute to a high preweaning mortality.",

The virus can be demonstrated by isolation using cell cultures, by direct detection of viral antigen in tissue sections, or by the detection of virus-specific RNA. Two commercial ELISAs and an inhouse florescent microbead immunoassay were tested to detect IgG antibodies in serum and oral fluids for both type 1 and type 2 virus.

In outbreaks of respiratory disease, mortality can be reduced by ensuring that the environmental conditions in the barns and pens are adequate, the stocking density is kept low, and the feeds and feeding programs are monitored. Routine procedures such as tail docking, iron injections, castrations, teeth clipping, and cross-fostering should be delayed or not done during the acute phase of the disease. Supplemental heat for neonatal pigs should be provided if necessary. Sows that have aborted their litters should not be bred until the normal time of weaning. This will reduce the incidence of infertility common at the first estrus after the abortion or premature farrowing. Culling of sows should be minimized and weekly breedings increased by 10% to 15%. Replacement gilts may be introduced into the premises for exposure to infection before breeding. The consequences of boar infertility and low libido may be minimized by use of artificial insemination or by using multiple sires on each sow. Recurrent illness and secondary infections in weaner and growing pigs can be continuing problems for a few months after an acute outbreak. Reducing the stocking density and an all-in/all-out strategy have been successful in reducing the chronic problem. If there is the possibility of treating secondary infections, then this should be undertaken. Serum inoculation of naive gilts has been described, and this was shown to be capable of stabilizing sow herds, as shown by the production of negative weaned pigs.

There are two main options for control: eradication of the virus from individual swine herds and controlling the disease in individual herds to create a stable positive system that allows to live with the disease. Controlling the disease requires developing strategies to make pigs immune to the infection by controlling infection pressure in the herd and inducing naturally acquired immunity in the herd or inducing acquired immunity through vaccination. The recommendations for control set out here are guidelines that can be applied and modified to meet different circumstances.",

The nurseries are completely emptied, cleaned three times with hot water and disinfectant, the slurry pits are pumped out after each cleaning, and the facilities are kept empty for 14 days, during which time all pigs weaned are moved to off-site nurseries and after which the conventional flow of pigs into the cleaned facilities is resumed. The control program can result in significant improvements in both average daily gain and percentage mortality, but it will not eliminate the virus from the herd. Using a partial budget model to measure the profitability of nursery depopulation, the financial consequences indicate that it is a profitable strategy to improve pig performance in herds affected with the virus. Additional income is generated by the increased number and weight of marketable pigs, as a result of their increased growth rate and decreased mortality. Lower treatment costs reduce overall expenses, but there are additional costs because of the extra feed necessary to raise the additional pigs and the costs required to house the depopulated pigs.

The number of viremic animals was significantly lower in the piglets of both groups of vaccinated animals than among mock vaccinated animals until at least 9 weeks of age.",

The goal is to produce a constant level of immunity across a defined population. This effectively immunizes the entire population and eliminates the nonimmune, susceptible subpopulations. Vaccination is most effective when used in replacement gilts combined with adequate isolation and acclimatization and in sows after farrowing and prebreeding. The routine vaccination of sows is not economically viable in herds affected with PRRSV. The vaccine is best suited for stabilizing the herd and is a necessity before nursery depopulation or commingling segregated early weaning piglets from virus-positive herds. Vaccination is also intended to produce protective immunity in weaned and growing pigs. The PRRS virus exists in many forms and therefore the closer the genetic makeup between the immunizing virus and the challenge virus the better.",

North American vaccine virus was frequently detected in nonvaccinated animals. 326 The first modified-live vaccine was first released in 1994 and since then a number of other modified live and killed-virus vaccines have been developed. Vaccines should induce rapid immunity, have no adverse reactions, and be able to differentiate vaccinated from naturally infected animals (DIVA vaccine). 308, 327, 328 Mass vaccination using modified live virus against homologous infection was shown to be effective in reducing economic losses from PRRSV. It did not eliminate the virus but it did reduce viral shedding 97 DPI. 329 Two vaccines were compared (one inactivated and one modified live), and the modified live virus was the only type of vaccine capable of establishing protective immunity as measured by viral load in blood and tissues. The inactivated vaccine evoked no measurable protective immunity. The modified live vaccine seemed to be based on cell-mediated immunity. 330 A modified live vaccine partially protected a group of pigs given a heterologous virus vaccine; intervention reduced the duration of shedding but did not reduce the viral load in tissues or the proportion of persistently infected pigs. When the pigs were subsequently given the highly virulent virus, infection and shedding were not prevented. 331 The modified live vaccines for PRRSV have been reviewed. 332 None of the vaccines studied (Ingelvac PRRS MLV, Amervac PRRS, Pyrsvac-183, and Porcilis PRRS by the IM route) caused detectable clinical signs in vaccinated pigs, although lung lesions were found. Neither Pyrsivac-183 nor Porcilis PRRS could be detected in the pulmonary alveolar macrophages or in lung sections by IHC, suggesting that these viruses may have lost their ability to replicate in PAM. In these pigs, there was also a lower transmission rate and a delay in the onset of viremia, which may be explained by the lack of infection and therefore replication in the alveolar macrophage.",

Serologic tests do not distinguish between members of the brucei group; hence they are of limited value in areas where T. brucei or T. evansi is endemic, even when monoclonal antibodies are used. In recent interlaboratory ring trials to evaluate serologic methods for dourine diagnosis, 9 out of 22 laboratories observed a false-positive result with a known T. evansipositive serum, whether by CFT or IFAT. 4 However, diagnosis can be made based on serologic tests and characteristic clinical signs under the right epidemiologic setting. 2 PCR has been used to detect trypanosome DNA and is an indication of an active infection, unlike serologic tests that detect past and current infections. Still, the PCR test cannot yet distinguish T. equiperdum from T. evansi or T. brucei. 5, 6 With the recent isolation of new strains of T. equiperdum from clinical cases in Ethiopia, 3 the first in 4 decades worldwide, there is hope that new internationally recognized tests for the diagnosis of dourine will be developed soon.",

Varieties of Trifolium subterraneum, e.g., Yarloop, Dwalganup, Dinninup, and Geraldton, are much more toxic than Bacchus Marsh and Daliak. Pastures containing more than 30% of the first four varieties are likely to be unsafe. In some clovers, e.g., red clover, the estrogen content varies with the season, and is high in early spring, low in midsummer, and high again in the autumn after the hay has been taken off. Insect damage to pasture can increase the estrogen content 10-fold, and bacterial infection (e.g., by Pseudopezzia medicaginnis, a leaf-spotting organism on alfalfa) and fungal infection by 100-fold. Plants that have matured in the field and set seed have no estrogenic potency, but the making of potent fodder into hay causes little depression of estrogen content. Clover ensilage can contain high levels of estrogens, and the ensiling process is considered to increase the estrogenic effect of clover 3-to 5-fold.",

It is thought that the production of estrogens is a byproduct of the plant's mechanism of resistance to the fungal infection. Ladino clover, a largegrowing variety of white clover, may contain large quantities of a highly active estrogen (coumestrol), and when it dominates a pasture and is grazed when the pasture is lush, it may be associated with the cornification of vaginal epithelium and functional infertility in ewes. Three estrogenic compounds have been isolated from T. pratense (red clover), and where this plant dominates the pasture a clinical syndrome similar to that associated with subterranean clover may be observed. Ewes grazing on red clover pasture, especially a toxic cultivar of the plant, may have their conception rate at the first mating cycle reduced from 75% to as low as 25%.",

A particular form of reciprocal translocation is the Robertsonian translocation (ROB). During a ROB participating chromosomes break at their centromeres (center pieces) and the long arms of the two chromosomes merge to form a single chromosome with one centromere and two long arms. At the same time, a new chromosome containing both short arms is also created, which typically only contains nonessential genetic information and is lost during following cell divisions. Chromosomal translocations are identified by the chromosomal series involved. Thus a 1/29 translocation represents a fusion between a chromosome of each of the pairs numbered 1 and 29.",

            "text": "A number of chromosomal rearrangements have been identified in different livestock species over the years and have been associated with clinical conditions such as intersexuality, congenital malformations, and reproductive dysfunction. 1 Some of the translocations that occur endemically in certain regions have been associated with significant economic losses. 2 Several European countries have established cytogenic screening programs to monitor the occurrence of chromosomal translocations in the livestock population. 1 In Italy the incidence of RCP in cattle determined in an official cytogenic screening program was 0.3%, whereas 7.1% of studied animals were carriers of a ROB. 2 By far the most common ROB identified was the so-called translocation 1/29, which is endemic in the region, accounting for 99.6% of all ROBs. 2 Translocation 1/29 has been identified in many breeds of cattle and has been associated with significant reductions in the fertility of cows bred by artificial insemination services. Early embryonic death occurs in embryos produced by fertilization of affected gametes or fertilization of normal gametes by spermatozoa carrying the 1/29 translocation. There is no abnormality of serving behavior or semen quality. The translocation has been shown to be inherited in most European beef breeds including the Blonde d' Aquitaine, Swedish Red and White, Charolais, Danish Limousin, British Friesian and Red Poll breeds, and in the wild British White cattle. In Bolivian Creole cattle breeds, in the Creole-like cattle, the average frequency was 10.42% with a variation from 0% to 28.2%. In contrast, Yacume\u00f1o and Creole-type cattle did not show the centric fusion. The highly significant differences between Creole cattle breeds in relation to the 1/29 translocation could be the consequence of factors such as founder group, genetic drift, and selection. The low frequency observed in the Saavendre\u00f1o Creole dairy cattle might be caused by breeding under a more intensive system and selection according to milk yield and fertility traits. The frequency of affected animals in a breed may vary between 1% and 20%. Karyotyping and culling of abnormal bulls in most artificial breeding centers has reduced the impact of the defect.",

Differential diagnoses include: mistaken breeding date, intrauterine death and fetal mummification, and pituitary abnormalities in the fetus caused by infection by BVD virus, Akabane virus or bluetongue virus, ingestion of Veratrum californicum, and genetic abnormalities. 1 The disease is caused by lack of a functioning fetal hypothalamic-pituitary axis and consequent inability of the fetus to initiate parturition.

Diagnostic confirmation is based on the presence of appropriate clinical signs with a history of exposure of affected horses to ETCs.Application of bifenthrin or permethrin, but not 3% horticultural oil, to egg masses (tents) during the winter prevents emergence of caterpillars in the spring. Insecticidal soap or oils sprayed on neonatal caterpillars is minimally effective. Bifenthrin or spinosad are effective against all instars for 7 days when sprayed on foliage. Injection of trunks of cherry trees with dicrotophos or emamectin is effective against all instars, but injection with milbemectin or avermectin is not effective. A spray of 50 mL of 39% permethrin diluted in 4 L of water and applied to a 2-m wide band of pasture outside the fence line kills migrating caterpillars and prevents them obtaining access to pasture.

The syndrome, while occurring several years after the epidemic of MRLS in the United States, had some similarities and caterpillars were looked at as a possible source of the problem. Several caterpillars were examined with the O. lunifer (the processionary caterpillar) ultimately causing abortion in two different experimental studies involving early pregnancy and midlate pregnancy. 3, 4 There are some differences between the two syndromes. An infectious agent has been identified in both EAFL and MRLS, but they are not the same bacteria. The predominant bacteria isolated from EAFL cases were environmental coryneforms and gramnegative rods, whereas Actinobacillus and non-\u03b2-hemolytic streptococci were common isolates from MRLS cases. 2,5 Fibrinous pericarditis and unilateral uveitis affected a number of horses in the MRLS epidemic but did not occur with EAFL. 1 Finally, although devastating, the number of horses involved in the 2004 EAFL outbreak was considerably less than the 2001 to 2002 MRLS epidemic.",
