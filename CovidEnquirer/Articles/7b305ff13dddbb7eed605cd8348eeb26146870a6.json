Certain subtypes of influenza A are species specific, although all subtypes have been documented in birds. Prominent human subtypes include H3N2, H2N2, H1N1 and H1N2. The influenza A virus has 15 distinct H and 9 distinct N subtypes, although H1, H2, and H3 and N1 and N2 are prominently associated with disease outbreaks in humans. Subtypes of influenza A viruses that are prominent in one species may on occasion infect and cause disease in another. In 1998, for example, the H3N2 subtype crossed from humans to pigs, causing serious disease in the swine population. In addition, influenza A viruses from birds can be transmitted to humans directly or indirectly by an intermediate host. In this way the 8 genetic elements of influenza A virus may reassort to form a new subtype (H*N*) against which humans not immune Schweiger et al (2002) .

The terminology for influenza viruses is directly related to the type of virus, the origin or place it was first located, and the year of its discovery. The immunity invoked by influenza vaccine generally lasts 6-12 months. Amantadine Amantadine is active against influenza A viruses but not influenza B. It was approved in 1966 for chemoprophylaxis and in 1976 for treatment and chemoprophylaxis of influenza type A virus in both adults and children 1 year of age. Amantadine may cause central nervous system side effects (13%), including anxiety, nervousness, insomnia, light headedness, and concentration difficulty, and gastrointestinal side effects (1-3%), including nausea and anorexia, at dosages of 200 mg/day. Because its effects on pregnant women and their fetuses are unknown, it should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risks. Drug resistance develops in approximately one-third of patients, with cross resistance to rimantadine. Maximum blood levels are attained within 4 hours of administration of a single 100 mg dose. The peak excretion rate of amantadine is 5 mg/hr, and the mean half-life of the excretion rate is approximately 15 hours. Clearance of amantadine is reduced 2-3-fold in adults with renal insufficiency. In otherwise healthy elderly adults (65 years) the renal clearance is reduced and plasma levels therefore increased. The drug, like rimantidine, influences viral uptake by preventing membrane fusion and affects maturation of the hemagglutinin (H) to lower the infectivity of progeny virus. It is 70-90% effective in preventing illness in healthy adults and, if administered for prophylaxis within 2 days of illness, can reduce flu symptoms and shorten the duration of the illness by 1 or 2 days. Rimantadine Rimantadine is effective against influenza A but not influenza B viruses. It was approved in 1993 for the treatment and chemoprophylaxis of influenza A infections in adults and prophylaxis in children. Some consider it appropriate for the treatment of disease in children. Rimantadine may cause central nervous system side effects (6%), including anxiety, nervousness, insomnia, light headedness and concentration difficulty, and gastrointestinal side effects (1-3%) such as nausea and anorexia, at dosages of 200 mg/day. Because its effects on pregnant women and their fetuses are unknown, it should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risks. Drug resistance develops in approximately one-third of patients, with cross resistance to amantadine.
