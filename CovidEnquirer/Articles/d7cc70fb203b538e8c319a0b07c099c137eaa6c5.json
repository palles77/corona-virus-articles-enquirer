Mathematical moments are calculated for each of these spectra to create a multidimensional vector in a Euclidean space for each gene or genome sequence.

The first is 34 strains of coronavirus genomic data, the second is 118 of the known strains of Human rhinovirus (HRV), and the third is 30 bacteria genomes. The distance matrices are computed based on the three sets, showing the distances from each point to the others. We used the complete linkage clustering algorithm to build phylogenetic trees to indicate how the distances among these sequence correspond to the evolutionary relationship among these sequences.

Specifically, we calculate the first few regular and central moments of the genome for each nucleotide and assign that genome a point in Euclidean space with those moments as the coordinates. Then, a distance matrix can be generated from the pairwise distances of the genomes using Euclidean distance. A distance matrix can then be used in clustering algorithms to separate genomes into various clusters or groups. Here, we have used the complete linkage clustering algorithm and the average linkage clustering algorithm. In complete linkage clustering, the distance between two clusters is computed as the distance between the farthest two elements in the two clusters (Dawyndt et al., 2005) . On the other hand, the distance between two clusters in average linkage clustering is defined as the average pairwise distance between the points of two clusters.

We take 20 moments here: the first three regular moments, and the second and third central moments for each of four nucleotides. This gives each nucleotide five moments, resulting in a 20-dimensional point in Euclidean space.

The normalizing factor used was 1=\u00f0N j\u00c01 N j\u00c01 m \u00de with m being the nucleotide of that particular moment. The first three regular moments of each nucleotide were calculated with Eq. (4). Afterwards, the second and third central moments were calculated with Eq. (6).

Furthermore, the trees created by complete linkage clustering and average linkage clustering are extremely similar. The genomes are correctly clustered, only the orientation of the tree is different. Fig. 2 shows the trees generated for the 113 HRV genomes and three HEV (outgroup) genomes. Using complete linkage clustering, the genomes were correctly clustered into HRV-A, HRV-B, HRV-C, and HEV-C. However, the tree created using average linkage clustering shows subtle imperfections. A small group of HRV-A genomes is misplaced and put between the HRV-B genomes. Those genomes were originally on the edge of the HRV-A cluster in complete linkage clustering. When switching to average linkage clustering, the clusters changed.

However, with the human rhinovirus situation, average linkage clustering was unable to accurately group a few genomes while complete linkage clustering was able to. Although average linkage clustering provided a higher cophenetic coefficient than complete linkage clustering, complete linkage clustering provided superior results. This is because cophenetic analysis is not a definitive method to select the best clustering method. In the case of genome clustering, we see that complete linkage clustering is able to provide better results in spite of its lower cophenetic coefficients. As a result, we propose that complete linkage clustering be used regardless of the cophenetic analysis results.",

Instead of taking hours as the multiple sequence alignment method requires, our method requires at most a few minutes to finish its calculations and to draw the phylogenetic tree depending on the number of sequences and the computer used.
