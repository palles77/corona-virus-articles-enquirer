Infection control algorithms delineating a standard approach to patient management decrease risk of secondary exposure, but few articles document health care workers' (HCWs) perceptions as to their effectiveness and ease of implementation. Methods: A cross-sectional survey approach was used to explore HCWs perceptions in 2 emergency departments of the current algorithms for management of potentially infectious respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses. Results: Surveys from 96 HCWs revealed that algorithms were perceived as invaluable in protecting staff, patients, and colleagues. Differences in self-reported compliance, clarity, and ease of implementation of the respiratory algorithm were noted between facilities, likely reflecting variation in the physical plant. Physicians scored significantly lower for compliance with the respiratory algorithm. Conclusion: Algorithms were perceived to offer a clear and consistent approach to patient management and protect HCWs in spite of environmental and resource limitations.",

For both respiratory and GI algorithms, global mean scores for compliance (3.3 and 3.5, respectively), clarity (3.5 and 3.7, respectively), and ease of implementation (3.5 and 3.8, respectively) were achieved. Respondents' global mean scores for ''ability to protect'' were 4.6 and 4.7, respectively, for the respiratory and GI algorithms. Differences for compliance (P 5 .001), clarity (P 5 .03), and ease of implementation (P 5 .001) of the respiratory algorithm were observed between facilities, with VGH showing significantly higher scores. Generally, those with more than 10 years experience in health care and at their facility scored significantly higher for respiratory algorithm compliance and clarity compared with those with less experience. Physicians scored significantly lower for respiratory algorithm compliance (P 5 .03 compared with RNs, P 5 .02 compared with other clinical staff), respiratory algorithm ability to protect (P 5 .005 compared with RNs), and GI algorithm ability to protect (P 5 .007 compared with RNs, P 5 .020 for non-clinical staff). Table 3 displays means of individual items evaluating the respiratory algorithm. Less than neutral scores for individual items of compliance were as follows: ''patient admitted to NPV room,'' ''HCW wears surgical mask,'' and ''HCW wears protective eyewear.'' All other items received neutral or above neutral scores, with the exception of ''HCW cleans hands after caring for patient'' (4.8/5), which was strongly positive. It should be noted that the item ''HCW wears surgical mask'' was included as a negative control; low scores were expected because HCWs are taught to use a N95 respirator at first patient contact, indicating that respondents were reading each statement and responding appropriately. Compared with LGH, VGH scored significantly higher for ''patient admitted to NPV room'' (P , .001) and ''HCW wears N95 respirator'' (P , .001) (data not shown); the former was expected, given the status of renovations at LGH.

The lowest mean score for ease of implementation was 3.22-''use of single room/ dedicated commode.'' Respondents rated the GI algorithm's ''ability to protect'' and ''facility commitment to safety'' positively, with scores ranging between 4.48 and 4.75.

RNs were most represented (70.5%) as expected, but, importantly, physicians were almost 10% of respondents, which reflected the occupational distribution in the departments. Most respondents had considerable experience, worked both day and night shifts, and worked full-time equivalents. HCWs reported an agreement between expected and actual use of the respiratory and GI algorithms. That is, the algorithms were applied to 1 to 5 patients per shift, which was also the number of eligible patients. Considering that 75% of respondents worked a minimum of 3.5 shifts per week, it seems plausible that each algorithm might be used up to 70 times per week (2 shifts per day, 7 days per week). The observations are also supported by a previous study at VGH, in which 86.5% of emergency department HCWs reported wearing a respirator from 1 to 10 times/shift. 4 Strongly positive global mean scores indicate that HCWs perceive the algorithms as clear and invaluable tools for consistently managing patients with potentially transmissible illnesses. This is supported by the qualitative data: ''The algorithms are [an] excellent resource/guide for triage-treatment of patients presenting symptoms of GI and respiratory infections.'' Several respondents provided comments helpful for improving visibility of the algorithms. These suggestions include laminated fact sheets for triage clipboards, posting laminated hard copies of the algorithms, and increasing visibility on the regional infection control intranet site.",

            "text": "Low and neutral scores reflected constraints in the physical plant design, perceived restricted access to personal protective equipment, and limited availability of commodes similar to that found in a United Kingdom study of emergency department resources. 10 This was supported by HCW comments, eg,''not enough resources to treat patients consistently, ie, rooms, commodes, isolation.'' Low scores for compliance and ease of implementation of using NPV rooms and N95 respirators were particularly evident at LGH. The former reflected the state of renovations at the time of the survey. Reported differences between VGH and LGH regarding N95 respirator use likely reflect a difference in organizational culture rather than resource availability; the algorithms had been in place for approximately 1 year at LGH compared with 5 years at VGH, and a previous audit documented that respirators were accessible at all sites. 5 The challenge of adhering to guidelines regarding commode use as it pertains to the GI algorithm was illustrated in the following statement and reflected inadequate resources. ''Sometimes it is difficult to have a designated commode at the bedside due to not having enough commodes at the bedside. Often times we have to wipe down commodes aggressively so the next patient can have a disinfected commode.'' Compared with other HCWs, physicians reported lower compliance with the respiratory algorithm and scored lower on their perception that the algorithms protected either staff or patients. This contrasts with results from a survey conducted by Virginia Commonwealth University, in which physicians reported significantly better compliance with hand hygiene, contact precautions, and airborne precautions compared with other occupations. 6 Results were explained by different motives for compliance: RNs were motivated by patient safety more than personal safety, whereas physicians reported personal safety as more of a motivating factor. 6 Our findings showed that personal and patient safety were both strong motivating factors for all occupations.",
