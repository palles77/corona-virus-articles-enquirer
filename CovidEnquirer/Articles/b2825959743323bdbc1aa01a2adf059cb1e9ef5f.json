However, the growth in this sector is under the continuous increasing threats of infectious diseases worldwide. This menace is further aggravated by globalization in animal trade for various purposes. The sudden entry of an infectious disease in a new country or geographical location could lead to delayed diagnosis and rapid spread into the susceptible animal population. In response to climate change, vector-borne diseases are also increasing worldwide. To prevent the spread of infectious diseases, one of the basic and critical requirements as prescribed by the World Organization of Animal Health (OIE) is the application of rapid, accurate, and highly sensitive identification of infectious agents. Though the term \"biotechnology\" was coined in the year 1919 by Karl Ereky, the tangible biotechnological advancements in improving the human and animal health were started in the late 20th century. Since then, biotechnological applications have been making significant contributions in the development of novel powerful diagnostic assays for the efficient diagnosis and control of animal infectious diseases. Importantly, biotechnology has made the availability of pen-side tests for use at the field level to detect the causative infectious agent during a disease outbreak. In this chapter, we primarily describe and discuss the innovative biotechnological advancements made in the animal disease diagnosis in a step-wise manner.",

Vital sectors are under continuous economic loss and unrelenting development. The infectious diseases have taken a huge physical toll on animals and humans. This has pressed on humanity and has caused substantial economic, social, and mental losses. Thus, it is a matter of animal health and economic interest to invest in strategies to give a blow to infectious diseases and put them under control. Elimination of the pathogens and/or their vectors from their natural reservoirs would always be a first thought, but the removal is not easy, as they are constantly emerging and it is always very difficult to predict the emergence of infectious agents. Evolution of pathogens is putting extra challenges, pressing on humanity to look at the new strategies and forcing the researchers to look for innovative ones. The newly evolved pathogens are always more advanced and deadly from the previous ones and put up a strong resistance. \"From the evolutionary perspective, they [viruses and bacteria] are 'the fittest' and the chances are slim that human ingenuity will ever get the better of them.\" With the increase in the knowledge of infectious diseases and science, the degree of pace in pathogen discovery has increased. To keep pace and for better diagnosis, new tools and techniques need to keep on evolving. This is not only to quickly detect the pathogens, but also to make predictions with probable and possible outbreaks.",

This will facilitate in understanding the ancestry of the pathogen, and provide an insight and a mechanism for the epidemic, endemic, and even pandemic outbreaks. This system will also assist in understanding the interface transmission between and the directional flow of the zoonotic infectious diseases. Thus, phylogenetic analysis and epidemiology would aim toward strategizing the challenges during pathogen surveillance and discovery. SARS, a coronavirus was pandemic in 2003. But epidemiology and microbiology mediated to stem its disastrous results and also the causative agent of SARS was identified. Bacteria, viruses, and parasites, present in feces, contaminate foodstuffs and cause disease in humans and animals, affecting the social set up and consumer demands. To increase the productivity and for the maintenance of good health of animals, antibiotics are frequently administered resulting in the growth and emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This further aggravates the condition, and makes the situation more appalling. Overseas imported pets were also found to transmit and carry over the diseases to humans (Smith et al., 2012) . Even aquaculture is at risk of contaminants with the virus directly affecting the marine lives, as in the case of the new virus discovered in salmon (Finstad et al., 2012) . Even honeybees and other pollinators are transmitting pathogens like fungi, bacteria, and viruses through the contaminated food items (Cox-Foster et al., 2007) .",

However, with the advancement in the biotechnology field, new and robust diagnostic techniques are continuously evolving and taking over the conventional methods (Caliendo et al., 2013) . Presently, molecular detection-based methods such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or its variants, and serological methods such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), are being used worldwide for the accurate diagnosis of many animal diseases. However, point-of-care (POC) and high-throughput novel assays have been developed recently.

            "text": "Serological methods were introduced in the early 1930s for the diagnosis of pathogens. Various serological diagnostics have been developed such as complement fixation, counter-immunoelectrophoresis, immunofluorescence in cell culture, ELISA, radio immunoassay, immune adherence haemagglutination assay, reverse passive hemagglutination assay, latex agglutination (LA), chemiluminescent immunoassay, and immunochromatography test (ICT). Among these, ICT and ELISA especially sandwich ELISA and competitive ELISA are used frequently in the commercial diagnostic kits for animal diseases worldwide. ICT assays mostly utilized mammalian IgG in commercial diagnostic kits, however, avian IgY antibodies, with added advantages over the mammalian IgG, have been employed for the detection of norovirus, rotavirus, and astrovirus in the fecal samples with good sensitivity and specificity ranging between 90% and 95% (Khamrin et al., 2009) . Modifications in ELISA format or combinations with other diagnostic methods have proved novel ways to detect pathogens more efficiently and accurately. For example, recently a novel ELISA for the detection of group A rotavirus antigen in the fecal samples of multiple host species has been developed . This assay utilizes the potential use of synthetic peptides and is based on the detection of conserved VP6 protein using anti-recombinant VP6 antibodies as capture antibodies and anti-multiple antigenic peptide (identified and constructed from highly immune-dominant epitopes within VP6 protein) antibodies as detector antibodies. Another assay, which is simple to perform without the requirement of laboratory facilities, is dot-ELISA. A highly sensitive and specific dot-blot assays for rapid detection of staphylococcal enterotoxin-A in food has been reported (Singh et al., 2017) . Dot-ELISA has been employed in diagnosing various important poultry diseases (Alam et al., 2012; Dhama et al., 2011; He et al., 2010; Majumder et al., 2018; Manoharan et al., 2004) . Immuno-PCR is another powerful assay that has been used for the immunodetection of viral nucleic acids. By combining ELISA with PCR, sensitivity of detection can be increased up to 200 times and is especially useful in detecting low quantity viruses in the stool samples (Bonot et al., 2014) . The major advantage of immune-PCR is that several viral nucleic acids can be detected simultaneously.",

Antigen detection using an antibody bound to gold nanoparticle cofunctionalized with thiolated DNA complementary to a hybridized DNA has been developed (Perez et al., 2011) . Here, the presence of antigen/virus particles activates the formation of a \"sandwich\" complex of gold nanoparticle construct, virus, and an antibody functionalized nanoparticles used for extraction. Now, this complex is heated to 95 C, thus releasing DNA tags followed by the detection through real-time PCR. NPA-IPCR offers a viable platform for the development of an early-stage diagnostics requiring an exceptionally low limit of detection.",

Most of the commercially available POCDs utilize either antigen/antibody or nucleic acid detection technologies. The former is usually available in the format of lateral flow assays or immunochromatographic strip tests. These assays are simple to use, rapid, inexpensive, disposable, and thus make them the ideal assay for POCD for animal pathogens. The commercially available immunochromatographic strip tests for economically important animal diseases are summarized in Table 13 .1. These assays are equally sensitive as compared to ELISA (Ferris et al., 2010) . Furthermore, combining these assays with smartphones has made the increased sensitivity and quick reporting of results possible (Yeo et al., 2016) . Therefore, these assays offer a novel herd level surveillance tool, and provide immediate results to the farmers. However, these assays have less analytical sensitivity as compared to nucleic acid-based POCD.",

However, the important patented technologies that are being used in the various formats of diagnostic assays are provided in Table 13 .2. A high-speed reagent system for qPCR, full velocity technology has been developed by the Stratagene which saves time in addition to highly reproducible results. This technology has been used for infectious diseases, cancer, and drug sensitivities testing and already granted five US patents, US6548250, US6893819, US6350580, US6589743, and US6528254. Besides, a POCD product, Dual Path Platform (DPP) has been developed by the Chembio Diagnostic Systems, on which tests to detect HIV and syphilis have already been developed. This company in collaboration with National Institutes of Health and the Infectious Disease Research Institute, United States is working constantly to use this platform for the detection of infectious diseases of humans and animals. Farm animals reared all over the world for major agricultural and production purposes majorly include cattle, buffalo, sheep, and goats. Since the last few decades, a number of infectious diseases have been found associated with farm animals, causing colossal loss to the livestock rearing community and few of them being zoonotic in nature, becoming a problem for the public health. Highly contagious livestock diseases such as FMD, hemorrhagic septicemia, peste-des-petits ruminants, and surra cause irreparable economic losses. Several other infectious diseases of dairy cows such as BVD, Johne's disease, tuberculosis, infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, and liver fluke infestations are generally regarded as being widespread and endemic. The best known and arguably most important discovery of farm animal diseases in the last few decades is bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), and others include digital dermatitis, neosporosis and bovine abortion, bovine neonatal pancytopenia, Arcanobacterium pluranimalium, and Schmallenberg virus. Among all, the world organization for animal health classifies FMD and BSE as diseases of major interest in cattle. These diseases are known to have a significant effect on dairy production either directly due to death or indirectly due to effects on fertility or milk production, and subsequently, culling. The disease conditions are usually identified based on history and clinical profile of the affected population, but for affirmative diagnosis of the pathogens responsible, the identification of the causal agent is done on the samples or clinical specimens for submission to diagnostic labs. The clinical profiles of several diseases overlap, making diagnosis a little tricky and cumbersome, so initially, the isolation of the infectious agent in pure form using cell culture systems or growth on specific and selective medium became a chosen method for the diagnosis of many pathogenic diseases in farm animals. Albeit their usefulness as most sensitive method of detection, they are not used routinely due to time-lapse in confirming illness (Bursle and Robson, 2016) . These methods may take hours to several weeks to obtain a confirmatory result. Therefore, other approaches based on morphology/biochemical properties of pathogens took the lead and were favored for pathogen detection and identification. Several infectious viral disease agents viz astrovirus, adenovirus, rotavirus, etc. were identified through electron microscopy (Ong and Chandran, 2005) . But, these also have some drawbacks like more time consuming, less sensitivity, and costly instrumentation. Apart from these techniques, approaches like detection of pathogen-specific antibodies or detection of antigenic proteins of pathogens were adopted and categorized under serological assays. Serological assays measure antigen\u00c0antibody interactions for diagnostic purposes. These assays are continuously being improved with technologies like rapid strip detection, thus becoming the most preferred tools and are broadly referred to as immunoassays.",

Innovations including the use of synthetic biology by making highly reactive peptides help to increase the sensitivity and avoid the cross-reactivity issues to some extent.

As these animals enrich our lives, it becomes our responsibility to take care of the companion animals and to protect them from any kind of harm. There is a spectrum of infectious diseases that occur in companion animals. Lyme disease, psittacosis, hookworms, and Salmonella are amongst the most common diseases in pet animals. (Lembo et al., 2010; Palatnik-de-Sousa et al., 2009 ).",

Chances of introduction of new diseases also arise on the import of animals from foreign lands. Thus, maintenance of strict trade rules and regulations and hygienic conditions becomes a necessity. Once the disease occurs, it is important to identify the causative agent to improve the effectiveness of treatment and to control the disease. Since the clinical observations are not sufficient and can overlap with other diseases leading to misdiagnosis, several validated laboratory assays are used for confirmatory diagnosis. Until 20 years ago, these laboratory tests exploited cell culture (for isolation of specific pathogen) and serological assays (for detection of antibodies generated against a specific pathogen or antigenic proteins).",

Similarly, serological methods include a long list. Immunodiffusion testing is most often used to detect antibodies to fungal pathogens in dogs, such as Aspergillus fumigatus, Coccidioides immitis, and Blastomyces dermatitidis. Agglutination tests include the microscopic agglutination test for serologic diagnosis of leptospirosis (agglutination of live leptospires) and the cryptococcal antigen LA test (agglutination of antibody-coated latex beads). Hemagglutination inhibition is used to determine antibody titers to CPV and canine influenza virus, and it evaluates the ability of serum to inhibit erythrocyte agglutination by these viruses. ELISA is commonly used for the detection of feline retroviral, heartworm, Giardia, Leishmania, and tick-borne infections. Indirect IFA for serologic testing in dogs and cats include quantitative serology for some tick-borne infectious diseases (e.g., Ehrlichia canis, Anaplasma spp.). Direct immunofluorescence assay in veterinary medicine include diagnosis of Giardia oocysts, FeLV within monocytes in peripheral blood or bone marrow, or canine distemper virus within epithelial cells from a conjunctival scraping. Many of these assays involve the use of polyclonal antibodies, or, more commonly, monoclonal antibodies-dependent diagnosis.",

In another example, NGS has also been used for the comparison of the oral microbiome of canines with their owners as they are in direct contact with their pets and many diseases might get transmitted to them (Oh et al., 2015) . Gold nanoparticle-based immunochromatographic strip test using a combination of mAb and pAb was developed as an alternative for on-site and cost-effective diagnosis of CPV infection . Another use of biotechnology has been observed for rapid and early detection of CPV using a QCM biosensor (Kim et al., 2015) . Also, for genotyping of CPV-2, conventional methods are time consuming, therefore, a probe-based duplex fluorescence melting curve analysis (FMCA) for genotyping six different CPV-2 variants (original CPV-2, CPV-2a, CPV-2b, CPV-2c, and vaccine strains of CPVpf and CPVint) using only two Taqman probes has been developed (Liu et al., 2019) .",

Infectious diseases entail remarkable economic loss, weak food production system, food insecurity, and high maintenance cost of the agriculture sectors including farm animals, poultry, and aquaculture. Besides, these diseases carry a huge risk of transmission to humans as sporadic and endemic zoonoses. Classical and conventional diagnostic methods are labor intensive, time consuming, less sensitive, and difficult to meet the needs of the emerging pathogen diagnostics. Thus, new innovations have to be worked on and need to be practiced. Over the long term, innovations will be helping in the diagnosis of pathogens with accurate, sensitive and specific detections. NGS, biosensors, and advanced amplification techniques will persist for longer periods in their constant modified forms. Innovations will always be bringing the new applications in the diagnostics for the improved versions of techniques. New technique applications come with the cost and unbroken funding will be putting new prospective techniques into the trials. These techniques should be simplified in the innovations for their easy practices at the field itself, without looking for any skilled personnel/highly equipped laboratories.",
