The life cycle of the parasite is complex, involving a polychaete and a salmonid host. Infection dynamics are greatly influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature and water velocity. If we are to control the disease it is important to predict the impact of environmental scenarios on spore concentration and infection prevalence. Here, we introduce a model based on partial differential equations to study the spore concentration in the river and the infection prevalence of returning salmon. The analysis of the model shows that for current climate conditions, additional dam release can reduce the actinospore concentration up to 48% and the prevalence up to 40% thus providing a potential disease management option. However, the infection risk is likely to increase for future climate conditions by 10-54% and this will lead to an infection level comparable to that of a recent high-disease year. Our simulations show that dam removal cannot be assumed to mitigate the effect of climate change or to have influence on infection prevalence. We show that our detailed model system can be reduced to a simpler exponential dose-response function, which predicts infection levels based on transmission rates, travel time and mean spore concentration, quantities that can be measured in-situ or given empirically. The dose-response function may therefore be a useful tool in disease management.",

In the past decade, the salmon population in Klamath River has continuously declined, in part due to Ceratomyxosis (enteronecrosis) that is caused by C. shasta (Fujiwara et al., 2011; Stocking et al., 2006; True et al., 2011) . The parasite can be found throughout the Pacific Northwest, but its negative impact on native salmon populations is greatest in the Klamath River. Up to 62% of outmigrating juvenile Chinook salmon are infected with C. shasta (Jones et al., 2015) and, combined with high disease-induced mortality, the disease leads to reduced numbers of both outmigrating juvenile salmon and returning adults (Fujiwara et al., 2011; Hallett et al., 2012; Stocking et al., 2006) .

After successful infection, the parasite develops into the myxospore stage, which is released when the infected salmon dies a natural or disease induced death. The myxospores re-infect the freshwater polychaete living in the sediment layer of the river. the disease has a high priority. Recent studies investigate the efficacy of removing adult carcasses to reduce the myxospore input into the system (Foott et al., 2016) and flow manipulation in order to reduce the polychaeta density (Alexander et al., 2014) or to reduce the spore concentration . The infection dynamics are greatly influenced by environmental factors such as temperature and water velocity. Future climate scenarios in the Klamath River predict significant differences in both temperature and precipitation patterns compared to current conditions (Perry et al., 2011; Ray et al., 2015) and are likely to affect spore concentration and disease risk. Besides climate change, the proposed removal of dams in the Klamath River Basin is assumed to affect fish health adversely due to aggravation of infection risk . Therefore, determining the effect of changing environmental conditions on the disease dynamics is crucial to aid disease control and mitigation. Furthermore, knowing about the effect of environmental parameters on infection prevalence can be used for targeted intervention. Mathematical models can help to identify the important processes and critical points in the disease cycle and can help to evaluate the efficiency of disease management options before implementation. However, the testing and implementation of predictive models for aquatic diseases is challenging due to a lack of data and the complexity of host-parasite interactions (Ray et al., 2015) .",

The modelling approach combined statistical and epidemiological models with meta-analysis data to predict the concentration of the two spore stages and the infection in juvenile salmon and the polychaete host. An ordinary differential equation (ODE) model for Ceratomyxosis in the Klamath River was used to study the influence of temperature and discharge on the parasite-induced mortality in juvenile salmon (Fujiwara, 2014) . However, neither model considers the spatial aspects of fish migration or spore concentration which should play a role in determining disease dynamics. The focus of the Fujiwara (2014) study is on predicting the mortality in juvenile salmon. Moreover, previous models largely ignore the role of adult salmon in the infection dynamics. As infected adult carcasses produce myxospores that re-infect the polychaete host, they represent an important link in the pathogen's life cycle. The potential significance of adult salmon in the infection cycle has also been mentioned by Ray (2013) and Fujiwara (2014) . More recently, the role of infected adult salmon in the infection cycle and the possibility of removing adult carcasses to reduce the myxospore input into the river, so as to diminishing the disease induced mortality of juvenile salmon in the following spring, has been investigated by Foott et al. (2016) . However, they concluded that there are little effects on myxospore concentration by removing carcasses.",

In an attempt to balance realism and analytical tractability, we simplify this complex system to one of three partial differential equations (PDEs) which retain, nevertheless, the dynamically important mechanisms. Our approach is based on a spatial one-dimensional epidemiological model with advection to study the actinospore concentration in the river and the infection prevalence of returning salmon. While our PDE model is instrumental in gaining insight into the interacting processes, disease management is more interested in straight-forward predictions of disease risk based on data available or easy-to-parametrize models. To this end, we demonstrate how our PDE model can be transformed into a dose-response model.",

(4)) and fit it to the data points given by Ray and Bartholomew (2013) using the least squared-error method (Fig. 5 ).",

Compared to our calculated prevalence of infection, the mortality rate of juvenile salmon modelled by Fujiwara (2014) shows a higher sensitivity to changes in discharge. In contrast to our empirically based formulation of the temperature dependence of the infection rate, based on the studies of Ray and Bartholomew (2013) , he assumes an exponential increase in infection rate with increasing temperature.

Predicted infection prevalences are comparable to those of recent high-disease years. Similar, Ray et al. (2015) predicted a high mortality in juvenile salmon for nearly all future climate scenarios. Since host-parasite dynamics are complex, the total effect of environmental change on disease dynamics is hard to predict. On the one hand, increasing water temperature could increase or decrease infection prevalence, depending on the current temperature and the number of infected polychaetes (Fig. 9) . Higher temperatures can also lead to shifts in the invertebrate host distribution (Alexander et al., 2014) or in timing and duration of spore production and host-parasite interaction (Ray et al., 2015) . Moreover, temperatures in Klamath River are already at the salmon's upper thermal limit (Ray et al., 2015) , which makes the future of the salmon population in the river unclear. On the other hand, different water flows affect the spore concentration (Fig. 7) and travel time of salmon (Fig. 4) .

Based on our scenario analysis with our model as parameterized, we conclude that dam removal has little effect on the amelioration of climate change on infection prevalence. Since the model is more sensitive to changes in temperature than to changes in discharge, the significant effect of dam removal on discharge, in combination with increasing temperature due to climate change, does not translate into having an impact on our simulated infection prevalence. However, if other factors were included (e.g. the influence of environmental parameters on the polychaete's life cycle or temporal and spatial variation of the host-parasite interactions) then it could be possible that the conclusions would be changed.",

In particular, dam removal not only alters water temperatures and flow, but will also change the spatial overlap between the host and parasites. Migration of salmon to the upper Klamath basin after dam removal could provide new hosts for existing parasite genotypes that are currently isolated upstream of the dams. Similarly, migrating salmon could transport new pathogenic genotypes of C. shasta to currently isolated salmon populations in the upper basin . In addition, the influence of environmental parameters on the polychaete's life cycle is not yet understood (Stocking and Bartholomew, 2007) . As we discussed before, changing environmental conditions like water temperature could lead to a range shift of the invertebrate host distribution. The polychaete density P 0 or the release rate \u03ba, for example, could be functions of the water temperature.",

Despite the simplicity of this function, it encapsulates all significant mechanisms of the disease dynamics in adult fish considered here. This simplicity is one of the greatest advantages of our model. In principle, one needs only three measurements to predict the infection risk of the returning salmon population in a given year: water temperature, discharge and actinospore concentration. The analysis we presented here for Ceratomyxosis in the Klamath River is easily applicable to other fish diseases at different locations. For instance, the myxozoan parasite Myxobolis cerebralis, the causing agent of whirling disease, has a life cycle that is similar to C. shasta. Discharge, temperature and spore concentration are easy to measure and can be used to estimate the infection risk with the dose-response model and evaluate the effectiveness of disease management options.",
