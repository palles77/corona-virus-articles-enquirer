An epidemiological approach to monitoring sewer systems is especially relevant for an early warning of pathogens used as biological weapons. In many situations, bioterrorist contamination events will result in the pathogen shedding to wastewater before a community level epidemic begins. Detecting the organism early allows the governments to respond on time and eliminate a potential catastrophe.",

All of these materials will find their way into sewage systems during the process of waste elimination (toilet flushing) and cleaning (e.g., bathing, hand washing). In addition to release during active infection, pathogens can be washed into sewage systems from cleaning of indoor (floor washing, kitchen sink use) and outdoor (auto washing, driveway cleaning, storm water collection) facilities. Thus, sewer systems collect pathogens from over a wide area to a common carrier, where they are transported to a central facility for processing.",

Monitoring of centralized wastewater allows detection of intentional, natural, or accidental contamination events. Because of recent bioterrorism concerns in the U.S., routine monitoring is potentially useful since it can result in better preparedness of utilities and the public health response system (Meinhardt, 2005) . The qualitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA) framework can be used as a tool to develop and interpret this type of wastewater monitoring system. Because the threat level drives the risk assessment analysis, a monitoring system should be coordinated with findings from modeling studies on the survival and dispersion of contaminants (Kim et al., 2007; Romero et al., 2008; Sinclair et al., 2008) , the contaminant point of introduction (Danneels and Finley, 2004) , the health risk (Haas et al., 1999) , and the locations of early warning systems/ sensors in wastewater and water treatment systems (Murray et al., 2004) .",

Pathogenic microorganisms can also grow in the host but not produce sickness in the infected host. It is estimated that 50% or less of those individuals infected with enteric viruses or bacteria actually become ill (Haas et al., 1999) .

            "text": "During the growth of the organism in the host, the organism will be found in various organs and bodily fluids. Organisms transmitted by the fecal-oral route are usually excreted in large numbers in the feces, since the initial or primary site of replication is in the intestinal tract. However, this does not preclude their replication in other parts of the body. For example, enteroviruses (e.g., poliovirus) will replicate in nerve tissue causing paralytic disease, while Hepatitis A virus will replicate in the liver causing damage there (Belshe, 1991) . Respiratory infections are usually the result of replication of the organism in the nose, throat, or lungs. Infection of other organs of the body often leads to the presence of the organisms in the blood and then the urine after their elimination by the kidneys. This explains the occurrence of insect-borne encephalitis viruses and enteric viruses in the urine (Pichichero et al., 1998) . Any type of infection ( Fig. 9 .1) within a community is likely to lead to pathogen excretion in bodily fluids/substances and therefore, transported into the community sewage system. This review considers biological agents prioritized by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) as potential biological weapons that could be used by terrorists (Table 9 .1 and 9.2). They are listed in three categories (i.e., A, B, and C) of decreasing concern. Category A agents require the most intensive public preparedness efforts due to the potential for mass causalities, public fear, and civil disruption. Category B agents are also moderately easy to spread, but have lower mortality rates. Category C agents do not present a high public health threat, but could emerge as future threats (Rotz et al., 2002) . Many other pathogenic agents are present in sewage, but not on the CDC select agent list. Table 9 .2 lists some common blood and respiratory agents and emerging pathogens, all of which could potentially be engineered for mass dissemination and detected through monitoring of wastewater. The methods described in this paper apply to many other pathogens and are not limited to those agents listed in Tables 9.1 and 9.2.",

As indicated in Table 9 .3 and a previous publication (Sinclair et al., 2008) , many select agents may occur in bodily excretions or secretions even though this may not be their primary site of replication. It would appear that all of the viral agents are excreted in the urine and most of the bacterial agents in the feces or saliva. Since none of the organisms cause enteric infections they have seldom been sought in sewage, however, Bacillus anthracis and Yersina pestis (plague) have been detected in sewage. The source of B. anthracis spores in the sewage was believed to be from an African import tannery operation (Perone and Gelosa, 1982) and presumably not from enteric infections, which would normally result in the presence of spores in the feces. Category B agents differ in that, and they include many enteric pathogens which are excreted in large numbers in the feces (Table 9 .3). All of the other agents in this category appear to be excreted in the feces; many of the viral agents are excreted in the urine. No studies were found that report examining sewage for their presence. The Category C viral agents appear to be excreted in the saliva and urine (Tables 9.3 and 9.4). No references for the presence of these agents in sewage could be found. Some typical blood-borne agents such as Hepatitis B virus (Alter et al., 1977) and Human Immuno-Deficiency virus (Levy, 1989) have been detected in sewage by molecular methods (Table 9 .4). The coronavirus, which causes Severe Acute Respiratory Disease (SARS), is Pathogen Surveillance Through Monitoring of Sewer Systems also excreted in the feces and other bodily fluids such as tears (Loon et al., 2004; Wang et al., 2005) (Table 9 .4).",

This is usually followed with a long decline in the amount of agent released by the host as long as death does not occur. For example, poliovirus appears in the throat and feces 7-10 days before clinical illness (fever) is apparent and may be excreted for more than 30 days after infection ( Fig. 9 .2). Poliovirus will also be detectable in the blood and urine during the course of infection (Pichichero et al., 1998) .",

            "text": "Most of the existing data on the occurrence and concentration of pathogens was gathered using culture of viable or infective organisms. Molecular methods such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or immuno-chemical methods (enzyme-linked immunoassays or ELISA) can detect both infectious and noninfectious organisms. These molecular techniques can detect concentrations from 1 to 10,000 greater than culture methods because some of the organisms may be inactivated (dead) or may not be able to grow on the selected media (bacteria) or cell culture (used for viruses). In the case of enteric viruses, the ratio of viruses detected by infectivity assay may be 100-50,000 times less than that detected by a molecular method (Ward et al., 1984) . This is because cell culture methods have a low efficiency in virus quantification from clinical and environmental samples; however, they do provide a robust measure of viral activity not feasible with molecular methods. Agents causing enteric and respiratory infections are released in large numbers in feces and respiratory secretions (Table 9 .4). Many of the Belshe (1991) enteric viruses such as the enteroviruses and adenoviruses may replicate both in the intestinal and respiratory tract. Using molecular methods the number of enteric viruses detected can approach peak concentrations of 10 12 organisms per gram of stool while protozoa can approach 10 6 -10 7 per gram. Cultivatable enteric bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella may also occur in concentrations as large as 10 11 per gram (Feachem et al., 1983) . By infectivity assays, the concentration of respiratory viruses ranges from 10 5 to 10 7 per ml of respiratory secretion. Even blood-borne viruses such as HIV will be found in the feces of infected persons (Ansari et al., 1992) and it appears that many viruses will occur in the urine during infection of the host (Table 9 .6), although these excreted viruses may not be infectious. Little information is available on the concentration of pathogenic viruses or bacterial agents of interest in the urine. The total amount of virus released by a person is, of course, also related to the amount of feces, urine, respiratory secretion, and skin that is released by the person. On average, a person excretes between 100 to 400 g of feces and 700-2000 ml of urine per day (Table 9 .7). (Sarkar et al., 1973) Days after infection Titer(mL) 3 1 0 3 -10 5 4 1 0 2 -10 5 5 1 0 2 -10 4 6 1 0 1 -10 4 7 1 0 1 -10 3 8 1 0 1 -10 2 10 10 1 -10 2 15 10 1 -10 2 19 10 1 20 0 Site of replication in the host GI, upper respiratory, nose, skin, internal organs Duration of release from the host Concentration in the source Incidence of disease in the population Water use per capita Season Survival in the sewer system A person with an enteric viral infection may excrete as many as 10 14 viral particles per day and over 10 15 during the course of an infection (Table 9 .8). Nonenteric bacterial agents of interest appeared to be released in concentrations from 10 0 to 10 8 by viability assays (Boone and Gerba 2007) . Respiratory pathogens end up in the feces from the swallowing of secretions.",

The relationship between the occurrence of poliovirus in sewage and clinical incidence of disease in a community was first noted in the late 1960s (Nelson et al., 1967) . These early detection studies were designed as longitudinal epidemiological investigations to assess the success of polio vaccination campaigns (Riordan, 1962) . The results of these studies demonstrated that a definite correlation exists among the isolation of enteroviruses in sewage, and the isolation of viruses in stools, and the number of recognized clinical cases within the community. Using cell culture assay techniques (which measure only infective viruses) and only grab samples (i.e., no steps to concentrate the sample) poliovirus could be detected when only 0.27-0.4% of the population was excreting the virus. It was also demonstrated that small outbreaks and epidemics of enterovirus and adenovirus disease within a community can be predicted by monitoring a community's sewage. Virulent or wildtype (nonvaccine strain) poliovirus type 1 was detected in sewage 9 days before the first clinical case became evident (Kuwert et al., 1970) . In an outbreak of Coxsackievirus B5, the virus was detected in the sewage 10 days before clinical cases were positive (Nelson et al., 1967) . These studies make it clear that grab samples collected on a regular (weekly or every few days) basis could be used to assess the introduction of a new infectious agent in the community. This approach was later adapted to monitor the success of poliovirus vaccine campaigns internationally (WHO, 2003) .",

Sewage surveillance system has been shown to be more sensitive than reporting of clinical cases of serious illness in a community. It was also demonstrated that pathogens can be greatly retarded in a sewage systems allowing a detection time over many days for a one-time release into a sewage system. Finally, it was shown that infectivity assays have the ability to detect one infected person in 10,000 individuals. Sewage surveillance can detect the presence or increased amount of infections from enteric pathogens excreted in the feces or urine during infection. However, the success of such a surveillance system for nonenteric pathogens has not been demonstrated, although they have been found in sewage. The sensitivity of a sewage surveillance system will depend on several important factors including the amount and duration of the agent released into the sewers, the frequency of monitoring, and the sensitivity of the monitoring method.",

Use of PCR should increase sensitivity by as much as 50,000 over cultivation methods (Ward et al., 1984) . Also, when using PCR to detect viruses in sewage, a 10fold loss in sensitivity is likely with current methods. This loss is due to interfering substances present in the sewage, but still leaves a method that may be 5000 times more sensitive than conventional culture methods. Increasing the volume of wastewater that is tested may also increase the sensitivity of current methods. Technology is available (Hurst and Crawford, 2002) which allows for the concentration of bacteria and viruses from up to 10 l of raw sewage.

Longer survival times in soil, water, and wastewater (Sinclair et al., 2008) facilitate a retardation of pathogens in sewage which allows a longer sampling window than aerosols where organisms are much more susceptible to factors such as settling, desiccation, and relative humidity. Additionally, wastewater is collected in a central location, allowing monitoring to be defined or subdivided to specific areas. Lastly, wastewater systems can include many pathogens originating in aerosol, surface water, tap water, or fomites as storm-water and watersheds will often flow into sewerage systems.",

Most agents of interest are likely to occur at one time or another in wastewater or at least have some normal range of background. Further research would be needed to determine what these levels might be and normal variation of concentrations of the agents in wastewater. The types and concentration would be expected to vary by location and the size of the population, area served and type of connections (e.g., the presence of a slaughterhouse may increase the likelihood of finding animal pathogens).",

Although the concentration and duration of release of all of the agents of interest are not known, it is still possible to detect at least one infection in populations of 1000 or more. This monitoring is especially useful when combined with other components of the QMRA framework such as modeling of sewage dispersion, back calculation of contaminant point of introduction, and calculations of the health risk.
