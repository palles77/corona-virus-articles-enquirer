Then 60 U of RNase H (Takara Bio Inc.) added before synthesis of second-strand cDNA at 50\u00b0C for 1 h. In accordance with the manual, a whole genome amplification system (WGA; Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA), which was developed for amplification of genomic DNA, was used to amplify viral double-stranded cDNA. This process was performed within 90 min. Instead of the Taq polymerase recommended in the kit, we used 1.25 U of AmpliTaq Gold LD (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) to obtain a high yield of the PCR products. Primers were provided in the WGA kit, but no information regarding their sequences was obtained. The reaction mixture was heated at 95\u00b0C for 9 min (for activation of AmpliTaq Gold), followed by 70 cycles of amplification using Mastercycler (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany). Each PCR cycle consisted of annealing at 68\u00b0C for 1 min, primer extension at 72\u00b0C for 5 min, and denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 1 min. The 1st cDNA library was digested with 40 U of HaeIII (Takara Bio Inc.) at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. DNA was purified by using the MonoFas DNA isolation system (GL Science, Tokyo, Japan), and a blunt EcoRI-NotI-BamHI adaptor (10 pmol; Takara Bio Inc.) was ligated at 16\u00b0C for 30 min by using DNA Ligation Kit, Mighty Mix (Takara Bio Inc.). The second cDNA library was amplified by PCR with specially designed primer sets in which 6 nucleotides composed of CC (HaeIII-digested sequence) and 4 variable nucleotides were added to the 3\u2032 end of the adaptor sequence ( Figure 2 ). For example, 1 primer set was as follows: forward primer, H1-1: 5\u2032-AATTCGGCGGCCGCG GATCCCCGGGG-3\u2032; reverse primer H9-3: 5\u2032-AATT CGGCGGCCGCGGATCCCCAGGA-3\u2032 (the adaptor sequence is underlined, and the HaeIII-digested sequence is shown in italics) (Figure 2) .",

The percentages of positive fragments (number of fragments containing viral nucleic acid/total number of sequenced fragments) in the reactions for detection of these 5 viruses were 60% (3/5), 45% (5/11), 100% (12/12), 50% (5/10), and 40% (4/10), respectively. As a clinical application, a throat swab specimen from a patient with fever and upper respiratory infection was characterized. Although the specimen exhibited enterovirus-like cytopathic effect by inoculation into HEF and GMK cells when cell culture system for virus isolation was used (2), extracted RNA from the supernatant of the cells showed no amplification by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) when 1 of the conventional primer sets for human enteroviruses was used (3, 4) . In the cell culture supernatant analysis by the RDV method, the specimen exhibited amplification of the partial nucleotide sequences of coxsackie A14 virus (nucleotide sequence data are available in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases under accession nos. AB275848-AB275853). Thus, the RDV method could detect unidentified cytopathic-effect agents such as enterovirus that could not be detected by RT-PCR when the conventional primer set for enteroviruses was used.",
