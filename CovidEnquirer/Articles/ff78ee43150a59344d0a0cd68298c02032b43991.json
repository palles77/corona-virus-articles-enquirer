Patients are often sent home with the diagnosis of gastroenteritis.U When the correct diagnosis is made, it is accompanied by perforation in 30 to 65% of children. 32-35 Perforation can in fact occur approximately 36 hours from the onset of pain. 33,34,36 The white blood cell count may be normal in 10% of patients and therefore is unreliable. 31 In the adolescent, gynecologic pathology and even pregnancy can mimic early appendicitis symptoms. 23 Abdominal X-ray is generally not helpful, but ultrasound is especially useful in equivocal cases of suspected appendicitis. Sensitivity is 85-90% with a specificity of 95-100% in the hands of an experienced ultrasonographer.f Laparoscopic surgery is being used more frequently in the pediatric population.F Chinese medicine considers an extra point, Lanweixue, located approximately half-way between ST-36 and ST-37 on the right leg, as the \"appendicitis\" point,38,39 It is well known for treatment of both acute and chronic appendicitis and traditionally has been considered to also have possible diagnostic value. 39 One Western study with 50 patients who had a presumptive diagnosis of appendicitis did not find the Lanweixue point to be statistically a good indicator of appendicitis.S'' whereas a clinical report from China indicates electroacupuncture administered to Lanweixue and ST-25 had a 63% cure rate for appendicitis.t! Other reports also indicate successful acupuncture treatment for appendicitis. 42\u202243 Auriculoacupuncture was reported to alleviate pain in a small sample of adult patients with appendicitis.t\" Acupuncture may be considered as an anesthetic in pediatric appendectomy, since an adult clinical study revealed that acupuncture was comparable to epidural in inducing anesthesia but had less respiratory depression, hypotension, and cardiac arrhythmia, and less need for postoperative analgesic and antibiotics.P Another study reported acupuncture anesthesia with 96.6% success rate. 46 At this time, because of the high sensitivity of ultrasound for diagnosing appendicitis, an integrative approach would be for the acupuncturist to immediately refer any child suspected of having the condition to a Western specialist for diagnosis. Because of the high incidence and rapidity of perforation in children, and the lack of substantiating data for acupuncture treatment in pediatric appendicitis, it would be reasonable to use acupuncture as an adjunctive therapy for pain before going to surgery or for diminishing pain and other complications after surgery. It would be advisable for the practitioner not to administer acupuncture treatment to diminish pain prior to referral as that may mask the symptoms and make clinical diagnosis more difficult.",

These data support the fact that asthma-like inflammation can be present at a very early age, and is associated with nonreversible impairment of lung function. 103 The excessive inflammatory changes indicate that asthma is a disorder due to an \"immunologic runaway response\" that was poorly regulated so that instead of protecting the host, the hyperactive immune response destroyed normal structure.

For practical clinical purposes, any patient not responding to initial doses of bronchodilating agents should be considered to have status asthmancus.l l-Avoiding allergens has been a successful management of asthma since the sixteenth century.

I 13 Parental education, especially in regards to smoking, can reduce hospital admissions.Uf Since infections that trigger asthma attacks are mostly viral,115 antibiotics are not routinely indicated.

At this time, there is ample biochemical support in the literature to indicate that acupuncture activates both the humoral and cellular immune system to protect the host. 13 1-136 Studies have also demonstrated that acupuncture can modulate the synthesis and release of pro-inflammatory mediators. 135,137,138 Current hypotheses suggest that this is most likely mediated through a common pathway connecting the immune system and the opioids,139-141 which has been well known to be associated with analgesic effects of acupuncture.",

Cognitive-behavior therapies represent the most widely used alternative to pharmacotherapy. Previo~s studies showed disappointing results. 203-206 In 1992 , the National Institutes of Mental Health began a 14month, multisite clinical trial, the Multimodal Treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (MTA) study. The results indicated that high quality medication management (with careful titration and follow-up) and combination of medication and intensive behavioral therapy were substantially superior to behavioral therapy and community medication management. There is slight advantage of combination of medication and behavioral therapy over medication alone. 207 Psychotherapy can be an effective adjunct to medication,144,154 but usually requires a long-term commitment to several years of treatment. Concerns about side-effects of medication, treatment acceptability, and compli-ance208-210 are additional factors that complicate management of the child with ADHD.

Simple sugar restriction seems ineffective. 213 The author conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind pilot study funded by the National Institutes of Health that integrated DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, conventional theories of frontal lobe dysfunction and neurotransmitter abnormalities with traditional Chinese theories of energetic imbalances. Laser acupuncture was used in the treatment of 7-9-year-old children newly diagnosed with ADHD. Preliminary data showed promise in reducing signs and symptoms of ADHD with improvement in behavior and cognitive function in children mild to moderately affected with ADHD. 214 While Western medicine views ADHD as a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that encompasses all aspects of a child's life, Chinese medicine is equally concerned with the multifaceted condition that affects every major organ at all levels: energetic, physical, emotional, and even involves the spiritual level. The following exposition of the child with ADHD is based on the author's 20-year experience in working with children with ADHD, integrating Western information and incorporating the Five-Element Developmental Theory (Chapter 5) to help unravel the complicities that envelope the child with ADHD.",

This is especially important in a young child in the Water phase of development, the preschooler. This child is naturally egotistical, curious, active and driven toward instant self-gratification. The child is pre-operational, manifests illogical and irrational thinking, as the child interprets the world according to his or her own experiences without regard for time or space. Activities and movements are not always purposeful, as they \"run around\" exploring this and that in the world. Growth and development are closely related to the maturation of the brain, the marrow in Chinese medicine. Kidney,the foundation of marrow, is the basis of all brain/marrow functions. This can be extrapolated to correlate familial predisposition to ADHD as transmitted through Kidney Essence, and neuroanatomic and neurotransmitter dysfunctions as Kidney Yang deficiency. The young Water child is also more susceptible to both explicit and implicit sideeffects of medication. The physical side-effects listed for the ADHD medications do not disclose the potent energetic effects that usually injure Kidney Yang. Therefore, treatment of the preschool-aged child with ADHD is vigorous ronification of both the Kidney Yin and the Kidney Yang.",

Movements and activities become more purposeful as the child develops advanced motor coordination and social skills to participate in team sports. The Wood child is typically Liver Yang excessed as the young tree grows upward toward Heaven; the child learns to make decisions and take directions in his activities. The imbalanced Wood child would manifest motor \"purposeless\" hyperactivity and inability to understand right and wrong as the child becomes physically aggressive. A child acting without proper direction from the Liver, the Qi General, correlates to the Western terminology of having \"impaired motor and behavioral inhibition.\" This child is particularly vulnerable to medication, which is metabolized in the Liver. Liver Yang leads to Spleen Yang deficiency through the destructive relationship of the Five-ElementCycle. Spleen is specifically involved with memory of facts and data, with concentration, therefore with academic learning. These influences are mediated through the Spleen Spirit, Yi, Spleen deficiency also explains the various sensitivities of the ADHD to foods, additives and preservatives. A deficient Spleen would in turn lead to deficient Lung because of the Earth-Metal nourishing relationship, and the child may have difficulty with organization and easily become sad and depressed. Lung deficiency would also predispose the child to become sensitive to chemicals and environmental toxins. Accompanying the Liver Yang excess is the constitutionally deficient Liver Yinwhich is worse when accompanied by Kidney deficiency. Liver Yin houses the Ethereal Soul, the Hun, which spiritually connects human beings to each other. The child with ADHD has behavioral characteristics that alienate peer social interaction, which translates as a restless Ethereal Soul unable to settle down in a Liver Yin deficient environment. The Ethereal Soul is also intimately connected to the Mind, the Shen that is housed in the Heart. Inattentiveness and easy distractibility are manifestations of \"brain\" deficiency, but are Chinese medicine signs of disturbed Shen, a Mind that is not at peace. Therefore, the school-aged child with ADHD has multiple organ/system disturbance, manifesting primarily as Liver imbalance, but also encompass Kidney, Heart, Spleen, and Lung.",

As Western medicine points out, older children manifest less motor hyperactivity but are more troubled with inner restlessness. The excess movement of the Wood child gives way to a perturbed Shen in a fiery teenager, who is in the Freudian Genital phase of development with drastic hormonal and physical changes. Teenagers gradually discover their sexual identity, as they explore passionate relationships with the opposite sex and distance themselves from their parents. The adolescent Fire children are fearless and difficult to control. They experiment with drugs and alcohol and are rebellious in a treatment facility. Their excess Heart Fire or Yang is accompanied by Heart Yin deficiency secondary to Kidney and Liver Yin deficiencies. The Ethereal Soul and the Shen are restless, unable to find solace in deficient\" houses.\" As Fire destroys Metal, depression and mood disorder can be more pronounced with Lung deficiency. The Spleen can have varying degrees of deficiency, depending on the extent of Liver-Heart imbalance of Yin and Yang. The teenager is also vulnerable to medications, because an excess bitter taste would further injure the Heart. Chinese medicine treatment would focus on the Heart, but also balance the Kidney, Liver, Spleen and Lung. Like its Western counterpart, acupuncture treatment of ADHD is also extremely complex. Management needs to take into account the age and stage of development of the child, the intensity and types of symptomatology, as well as dietary and environmental influences. Treatment has to be carefully planned so that all areas of deficiencies and excesses are treated, which must be done in increments as the child cannot possibly tolerate a massive, global treatment protocol. The regimen does not follow a fixed formula but must be flexible and devised individually, so that treatment is directed toward relief of the most immediate problem-such as disruptive hyperactive behavior or inattentiveness-with gradual overall balancing of all the Elements. A careful history about diet that includes excess types of foods, food additives, and medications or drugs and alcohol, would help steer treatment toward eliminating or tapering consumption. Lifestyle stresses, such as school pressures or dysfunctional family, would also be important information that provides a comprehensive understanding of the child.",

In a survey of 2773 infants, the parents of colicky babies need more advice on diet and hygiene, and tend to give their babies more drugs. 224 Some parents who put forth a great deal of effort to console crying babies may actually be stimulating them excessively, resulting in the characteristic behavior of colic. 235 The mothers' own feelings of inadequacy may also playa role in colic. Compared to mothers with normal infants, mothers of colicky infants feel less competent as mothers and tend to have more separation anxiety.236 Unable to calm her infant's distress, a mother may experience doubts as to her own mothering ability,237 or even feel rejected. 238 This may be associated with abuse or thoughts of abuse, as 70% of mothers revealed explicit aggressive thoughts and fantasies and 26% admitted thoughts of infanticide during their babies' colic episodes. 239 Colic may begin in the womb and at birth. A study from Finland looked at associations between characteristics of families during pregnancy and development of colic. Results indicate that when women experience emotional stress, physical symptoms, dissatisfaction with the sexual relationship during pregnancy, and negative experiences during childbirth, there was increased incidence of colic in the baies. 24o",

The long-term, cumulative effect of multiple administrations of antibiotics is Coldness in the Lower Energizer, which would result in constipation. Children take antihistamines even more frequently than antibiotics, since they are available over the counter. Parents routinely give children antihistamines for URI symptoms and often concomitantly with antibiotics for an ear infection.

The diarrhea persists for more than 14 days, with continual small-intestinal mucosal damage. 255,300 It occurs most frequently in very young infants, especially those living in poor, crowded conditions,255 in bottle-fed malnourished infants, and after rotavirus infection. 301 In Denmark the incidence was estimated to be approximately 3 per 1000 pediatric hospital admissions for gastroenteritis. 255 Clinically, the infant is listless, irritable, often has a \"worried look,\" and begins to show weight loss and wasting with persistent diarrhea. If the watery stool is profuse, the abdomen may become distended and tympanitic. 255 The precise pathogenesis for ongoing diarrhea following a bout of infectious gastroenteritis remains undetermined, but is most likely multifactorial: (1) persistence of the intestinal pathogen; (2) malnutrition from the acute episode exerts an adverse effect on the repair of the intestinal mucosa and on the recovery of normal motility; (3) dysmotility engenders bacterial contamination and overgrowth;302 (4) young age with immature immune response to antigenic stimuli. 255 Secondary lactose 302 and sucrose malabsorption and small bowel bacterial overgrowth have been detected. 302 The finding of lymphocytic infiltration of the intestinal mucosa suggests a cell-mediated immune response to environmental antigens, such as dietary, microbial, or both. 303 Whereas the major complication due to acute diarrhea is dehydration, persistent diarrhea even at 2 to 3 weeks' duration can result in malnutrition 255 and failure to thrive. 291,304,305 Despite intensive field-based and laboratory studies over three decades, many questions remain unanswered about prevention and the best approaches to management. 255 Children with secondary lactose intolerance would have more watery diarrhea, accompanied by bloating, flatulence, and crampy abdominal pain after ingestion of lactose. 23 A general elimination diet with lactose-free protein hydrolysate formula may be life-saving in some infants. 30l",

Just as in acute diarrhea, identification of the specific pathogen and drug sensitivity is important for management of infectious chronic diarrhea. Giardia is a frequent parasite in children and medication treatment appears beneficial.U'' Treatment of noninfectious conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, needs to be directed toward the primary disorder. In all cases of chronic diarrhea, malnutrition needs to be treated vigorously in order to prevent growth failure and mortality. Elimination diets generalIy only provide transitory, symptomatic relief. 31l Besides monitoring fluid and caloric intake, micronutrients such as zinc 312 and vitamins need to be supplemented. 306 Newer treatment and prevention modalities, including probiotics and vaccinations, are assuming increasingly more important roles in management of chronic diarrhea.I''? Chronic diarrhea without malnutrition is toddler's diarrhea, or chronic nonspecific diarrhea (CNSD). It is the most frequent cause of chronic diarrhea in children between 6 months and 3 years of age. 255,313 The typical clinical presentation is a young child who was a colicky baby and gradually begins to have three to six loose stools per day. Most of the stools are passed early during the waking hours and contain undigested foods and rnucus.U\" The child is otherwise active and healthy looking, with normal growth. 315 Stress and infection can precipitate bouts of diarrhea, which is made worse by a low-residue, low fat and high carbohydrate diet. 255",

There is often a strong family history of functional bowel disorders 255,313 so that it may be an early manifestation of irritable bowel syndrome. 255 From an infectious standpoint, there is the possibility of bacterial invasion of the small intestine by the upper respiratory tract microflora. 255 Current evidence also suggests that CNSD is primarily a gut motility disorder, modulated by dietary factors. 255,316 Diminished upper small intestinal motilit y304 may be a physiologic, developmental phenornenon. 317 Some children demonstrate intestinal mucosal inj ury318 with villous atrophy,291 The mechanisms that lead to mucosal injury are e1usive. 306 Dietary factors include low dietary fat, high carbohydrate and high fluid consumption, especially apple juice. 319 The over-consumption of apple juice has received the 2' 2 Pediatric acupuncture most attention as the causative agent. Previously, children were given orange juice to prevent scurvy. In recent years, apple juice has become the juice of choice for the under-5 age group.320 In many children with CNSD, apple juice makes up 25-60% of daily dietary intake. 321 Apple juice is high in sorbitol and has a high fructose to glucose ratio,322 and therefore contributes to a carbohydrate imbalance. In addition, compared to the freshly pressed and unprocessed (\"cloudy\") apple juice, enzymatically processed (\"clear\") apple juice significantly promotes diarrhea. This suggests that the increased amount of no nabsorbable monosaccharides and oligosaccharides as a result of the enzymatic processing of apple pulp is an important etiological factor in apple juice induced CNSD. 319 Normally, 95-98% of the intestinal fluid is reabsorbed. Disordered intestinal motility combined with excessive fluid and carbohydrate intake contribute to development of diarrhea. 255 Other proposed theories of pathogenesis include food allergy and intolerance,314.323 behavioral problems,323 hypogammaglobulinemia,324 congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency303 and iatrogenic causes of excess oral replacement therapy and elimination diet. 325 CNSD seems to be self-limiting, resolving spontaneously in a mean time of 1.7 years. 325 However, symptoms may resurface later in childhood,255 such as in teenagers who have diarrhea while on a fruit and juice diet. 322 Treatment generally consists of normalization of the child's diet, especially with regard to fat, fiber, fluids, and fruit juices 255,316 and alleviating parental anxiety.

The pathophysiologies of eczema are manifold: an accumulation of Heat and Damp, combined with Blood and Yin deficiency. 350 Multiple organ and channel dysfunction can be involved: Lung, Spleen, Kidney, Liver. Lingering Heat and Damp from previous illnesses, and a diet rich in Damp and energetically Hot foods would predispose children to accumulate Heat and Damp in the skin and in the Blood. The skin in Chinese medicine is part of the Lung, which explains the frequent manifestation of eczema in asthmatics. Spleen deficiency can manifest as accumulation of Damp. A child may have a prenatal predisposition to Dampness and to eczema when there is a strong familial tendency toward Spleen deficiency; when parents engage in excess mental work, have excess worry, or have digestive weakness due to poor diet or alcohol abuse during conception; and when the mother has these experiences during pregnancy. Living in a Damp environment, such as in the basement, close to the ocean, in rainy weather, and eating Damp-producing foods-such as milk products, greasy, fried foods, peanuts, sweets and white sugar-and engaging in excess mental activities can subject the child to Spleen deficiency and to the development of eczema. Although Dampness usually affects the lower part of the body, it can easily enter the Middle Energizer, from there it rises upward to affect the Upper Energizer, the Lung and its corresponding organ, skin. The Lung houses the Corporeal Soul, which gives us the capacity for physical sensations. When the Lung is not in balance, the Corporeal Soul is responsible for the manifestation of excess physical sensations, such as itching in eczema. Kidney and Liver Yin deficiencies can predispose the child to Blood and Yin deficiencies and Heat accumulation that manifest as red and dry skin. Treatment for eczema is directed toward dispersing Heat and Damp in acute flare-ups and tonifying chronic deficiencies. ",

However, there may be a more complex, dual CNS developmental delay in both the afferent and efferent limbs: the central nervous system fails to recognize and respond to bladder fullness or contraction during sleep, and also fails to suppress the micturition reflex arc during sleep. 365 The pathology does not appear to relate to sleep physiology, since the sleep cycle appears normal and enuretic episodes have been found to occur in every sleep stage. 360 There may in fact be a close correlation between biological and psychological factors, in that extreme CNS disorganization may result in psychological symptoms. 366 ",

These deficiencies often occur due to poor recuperation after previous illnesses, due to the presence of other illnesses or stress that weaken the digestive and respiratory systems. The Spleen and Lung regulate the body's water and expel excess. Weak Spleen Qi cannot properly carry out the transformation and transportation of fluids. Whereas a healthy Spleen prefers dryness, a weak Spleen retains water. Weak Lung Qi cannot adequately carry out the functions of governing the Qi of the body and regulating body fluid in the Upper Energizer, which in turn interferes with proper water flow down to the Bladder. Nocturnal enuresis ensues. Therefore, TCM explains well the Lung and Kidney relationship that seems baffling to Western medicine. Unlike PNE with Kidney Yang deficiency that typically manifests with copious urine, the enuresis associated with Spleen and Lung deficiency is due to inadequate regulation of fluid with inappropriate water retention, so that this type of bed-wetting characteristically would be of very small volume. Any illness or stress that diverts Qi away from the Lower Energizer would result in SNE: stress from school work, excess playing of computer games, emotional crises such as parental divorce or death of a close family member, could all divert Qi toward the Upper Energizer where it is needed the most.

Elevated body temperature may engender beneficial effects, such as interfering with bacterial reproduction, and accelerating a variety of immunologic responses, such as phagocytosis, leukocyte migration, and lymphocyte transformation. On the other hand, very high fever can impair the immunologic response. The marked increase in insensible water loss requires large volumes of water intake. The increase in cellular energy expenditure requires significant amounts of nutrients.

            "text": "Chinese medicine defines fever as Heat accumulation due to external pathogenic invasion or to internal organ imbalances. Current data is in general positive for antipyretic effect of acupuncture. An animal study from Japan demonstrated that e1ectroacupuncture stimulation to the point that corresponds to human LI-l1 exerted an antipyretic effect. 404 Other major antifebrile points studied include GV-14 and ST-36. 405 Research also focuses on elucidation of the mechanisms of antipyretic effects and the potential interaction of acupuncture with drugs. 406 A review from Russia indicates that acupuncture exerts antipyretic effects by triggering adaptive mechanisms that are directed towards correction of disturbances in the homeostatic systems of the body.407 One of these mechanisms may be related to the endogenous opioid system,408 which has been demonstrated to be modulated by acupuncture in pain relief. Other possible antipyretic effects of acupuncture may be modulation of the hypothalamic thermoregularion.w-One study from China suggests that acupuncture stimulation of LI-ll and LI-4 lowered body temperature through decreasing metabolic heat production and cutaneous vasodilatation.fv? An animal study from Russia indicates that when an antipyretic medication is used in combination with acupuncture, its effect is potentiated and lasts longer. 410 Another important question is the effect of acupuncture on immune function in febrile illnesses. One study in China reports that when fever due to Wind-Cold invasion was treated with acupuncture on Dazhui (GV-l4), Fengchi (GB-13), and Quchi (LI-ll), in addition to a significant drop in axillary temperature, sometimes more than lOC, respiratory rate, pulse, and blood pressure also decreased; symptoms were reduced; while the percentage of T-Iymphocytes increased.U! However, an animal study in China using acupuncture on points corresponding to human GV-l4 and LI-ll revealed no change in Wind-Heat fever caused by bacterial endotoxins.tlj A clinical observation in China of pasting herbs on acupuncture points in 72 ill infants revealed an increase in humoral immune substances such as IgA, IgM, IgG. This is a better preventive-prophylaxis-for fever. 4 13 Acupressure can be considered as a potential modality for fever management at home. 4 14 Chinese medicine posits that Heat accumulation in fever is due to either excess Heat or excess Yang with Yin deficiency. The Western medicine finding of children having a higher basal temperature and a tendency toward developing high fever can be easily explained by the TCM concept that children are constitutionally Yin deficient and have a relative abundance of Yang. They are also vulnerable to frequent febrile illnesses which further depletes Yin. The acute fevers are due to external pathogens. Wind-Cold invasion-viral infection-begins to manifest fever in the Shao Yang stage; whereas Wind-Heat invasion-bacterial infection-ean manifest fever from the very beginning during the Wei Qi level. Heat due to hot weather is also considered an external pathogen because it can deplete Yin. Chronic Heat can be due to any disorder that causes Yin deficiency, to continuous consumption of Hot energy foods, to excess emotions that causes Qi stagnation, and may also be due to familial or constitutional predisposition to chronic conditions with underlying Heat disturbance, such as chronic inflammatory diseases.",

The characteristic attack consists of severe, throbbing or pulsating pain-usually unilateral but in children often bilateral-frequently accompanied by digestive symptoms (nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain) and sometimes hypersensitivity to light and sound. 45o The duration is 4-72 hours in adults, and 2-48 hours in children under age 15. 417 Various hypotheses have been proposed for pathophysiology of migraine, but the precise mechanism is still poorly understood. The headache appears to involve both central and peripheral structures. There is vasodilatation and vasoconstriction of the neurovascular system,417 possibly due to inflammation of cerebral arteries. 451,452 There may be altered neuronal excitability in the CNS.453 Recent evidence suggests involvement of catecholamines,454,455 serotonin,456 and of some neuropeptides. 457,458 There is increasing focus on the role of dopamine, both in the prodromal symptoms (such as nausea, vomiting, drowsiness) and in the headache phase with pain perception and cerebral blood f1ow. 459,460 Migraine in children is often associated with abdominal pain 453 and cyclical vomiting. 461,462 A strong family history is supported by the finding of a dopamine receptor gene locus in migrainous patients with aura. 451, 459 Separation of migraine without aura from episodic tension-type headache may be difficult.

The cause is usually due to the pathology in the couple Yin organ Liver: Liver Yang or Fire rising. Liver is one of two Yin channels (the other being the Heart channel) that flows directly to the head internally. (All the other Yin channels reach the head via divergent channels.) The typical Liver Yang rising headache is the classic migraine of intense, throbbing, pulsating pain, usually along one side, but may involve both sides of the head along the Gallbladder channel, to the temples, or behind the eyes. The visual aura described in Western medicine can be explained by Liver Yang excess blocking Qi flow to the eyes, the external orifices of Liver. Gastrointestinal disturbances, such as nausea and vomiting, are due to Liver Qi invading the Stomach and preventing Stomach Qi from its normal downward movement.",

            "text": "The human immune response is an extremely complex cascade of events that involves numerous different types of immune factors and biochemical mediators. The immune system can be broadly divided into humoral and cellular compartments. The humoral response refers to complement and immunoglobulin antibody-mediated B-cell system. The cellular response refers to delayed hypersensitivity mediated via T-cells, which consist of a wide variety of cells that include leukocytes, polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN), eosinophils, mast cells, macrophages, and natural killer cells. This classification is not precise, as there is a great deal of interaction and cross over of functions. Recent studies have focused in depth on the pro-inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines and leukotrienes. These mediators are a heterogeneous group of biochemical compounds produced by a gamut of cells that includes epithelial cells, fibroblasts, PMNs, and macrophages. They trigger or orchestrate an immune response by acting as signals between cells of the immune system, leading to inflammatory responses against pathogens. Neurotransmitters in the CNS and nutrition also actively participate in the immune response. While an immune reaction can be protective to the host, a hyperimmune response can be destructive by damaging normal structures so that regulatory process is necessary to prevent \"immunologic runaway.\"394 Immune deficiency is associated with recurrent infections, malnutrition, trauma, and immaturity of the immune system. Children with recurrent infections often manifest immune insufficiency.509,510 Abnormalities of the local defense mechanisms of the upper airways are very comrnon.U! Poor nutrition, especially a diet low in protein, can cause both humoral and cellular deficiencies. Iron, trace minerals and vitamin deficiencies can all affect the child's immune system.512-518 Trauma can induce a potent inflammatory response. 519,520 Even hemorrhage alone may be a sufficient stimulus to activate the immune system. 519 Infants and young children have immature immune systems and are at greater risk for infections. 513,521 Neonates especially have very inadequate immune systems so that they are vulnerable to infections and often respond poorly to vaccines. [522] [523] [524] [525] [526] While inadequate immune responses predispose children to illnesses and infections, current data also suggest that hyperactive immune or inflammatory responses are possibly due to poor regulatory control and result in destruction of normal tissues. Asthma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), cardiovascular disease, diabetes and cancer are some of the chronic disorders attributed to uncontrolled hyperimmune response to an initial stimulus. There is evidence which suggests that juvenile rheumatoid arthritis is caused by T-cell infiltration of the synovial membrane. 527,528 Cardiovascular disease in children, such as rheumatic heart disease, are secondary immune response to infections. 529 The presence of pro-inflammatory mediators in diabetes suggests that a hyperinflammatory response to an infection causes pancreatic beta cell destruction. 530,531 Increased levels of mediators have also been found in cancer. 532 Recognition of the significance of pro-inflammatory mediators has generated fervent development of immune modulatory treatments. These treatments are costly and only a few are approved for usage in children.",

Wei Qi circulates outside the channels, in the skin and connective tissues, controls the opening and closing of the pores, and acts like a \"shield\" to protect the body against external pathogens. The Defensive Qi is intimately related to the Kidney, as it is influenced by Essence and transformed by Kidney Yang. It is nourished by the digestive organs, Stomach and Spleen, which supply the Food Qi. It is regulated by the Lung during the day. At night, it resides primarily in the Liver, which directs its flow to all the Yin organs.",

            "text": "When the body first contracts an infection, the external pathogen is in the superficial layers-the Wei Qi level of Wind-Heat invasion and Tai Yang level of Wind-Cold invasion. Treatment is directed toward expelling the pathogen and strengthening the body, i.e., chasing out the burglar and closing the windows and bolting the doors. At this time, there is ample biochemical support in the literature to indicate that acupuncture activates both the humoral and cellular immune systems to protect the host, as well as regulate a hyperinflammatory response. 531 Acupuncture treatment has been demonstrated to stimulate humoral immune factors. [535] [536] [537] [538] Animal studies demonstrated that when acupuncture points that correspond to human CV-2 and HT-8 were stimulated, an active humoral response ensues. 539 Acupuncture also significantly enhanced T-cell population and activities in both clinical and animal studies. 536, [540] [541] [542] [543] [544] There can be an increase in lymphocyte proliferation-t\" in phagocytosis 545,546 or in enhanced killer cell cytotoxicity.547 There may be a close relationship between the Stomach meridian and mast cell population, since stimulation of many Stomach points seem to result in an increase in mast cells. 548 An animal Common pediatric condftlons 245 study using a point that corresponds to BL-23, the Kidney Shu point, increased T-cell activities.I''! Acupuncture can improve immune function in traumainduced immunosuppression. 544,549 Noninvasive laser acupuncture, which is well tolerated by children, was demonstrated to positively affect both humoral and cellular immunity.536,550 Acupuncture has also been shown to affect the nervous system arm of the immune response. 535 Animal studies have demonstrated increased immunity with stimulation of the catecholaminergic 538,540,551,552 and serotonergic neurons. 538 The immune response may also be mediated via the autonomic nervous system. 553 Acupuncture seems to stimulate the sympathetic nervous system,554 resulting in activation of the release of helper T-cells from the bone marrow. 555 In fact, stimulation of the Kidney Shu point, BL-23, has been demonstrated to stimulate T-cells. 541 While acupuncture stimulates the immune response as a protective mechanism, it also appears to exert a regulatory effect on hyperinflammation. Acupuncture seems to be able to modulate the synthesis and release of proinflammatory mediators. 540,556,557 Current hypotheses suggest that there is a common pathway connecting opioids and the immune system. 535, 544, 546, 549, 558 Acupuncture is well known for its efficacy in the treatment of pain. Acupuncture analgesia is mediated through the stimulation of large myelinated nerve fibers which conduct the impulse to the spinal cord and higher centers. Opioids such as endorphins are released to block the ascending pain signals. It is possible that along with the opioids, other neurotransmitters that modulate the inflammatory response, such as substance P and serotonin, are also released. 559 Magnetic resonance imaging has demonstrated the coupling of pain and immune processes via the same afferent and efferent signals. 56o Acupuncture immunomodulation may also be mediated through the release of acetylcholine from the parasympathetic nerve endings. 561 Animal studies have also demonstrated specific immune effects of acupuncture in various conditions. Acupuncture treatment minimizes the hyperinflammatory response in asthma,562 stabilizes mast cells of gastric ulcer,563 reduces anticollagen-specific antibody level,564 enhances the cellular immune functions in cancer,565-567 and diminishes inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis. 564",

Genetic factors influence the inheritance of obese phenotypes, the major affectors of body (at content, energy intake and expenditure, and responsiveness to dietary intervention.618.624 Most likely obesity is a complex polygenic trait. 628 The most important issue in exogenous obesity is the balance of energy intake with energy expenditure. The major determinants of energy expenditure are basal metabolism, metabolic response to food, physical activity and growth; these are age-related in children. 255 The traditional view that obesity occurs when intake exceeds expenditure or in individuals with lower metabolic rate are now controversial, especially with respect to the pediatric population. Studies have demonstrated that obese individuals can have comparable metabolism as nonobese individuals 621 and some obese people in fact can have higher metabolic rates. 628 Obese and nonobese individuals often have similar energy intakes and expenditures.617.624 This implies that the difference between obesity and nonobesity can result from very small imbalances of energy intake and expenditure,617.624 possibly due to very small differences in basal metabolic rate or the thermic effects of food 624. In addition, children go through distinct developmental periods with different energy needs, such as early infancy and adolescence. Since there is inherent individual requirement for energy255 and susceptibility to the balance in energy617 and since changes in intake or expenditure in children may occur concomitantly with physiologic changes, such as hormonal levels in adolescence, weight gain especially during critical developmental periods is not always directly related to energy expendirure.vl?",

The hypothalamus nuclei contain over 40 neurotransmitters that affect food intake and thermogenesis. Those that stimulate appetite, such as opioids, and neuropeptide Y, suppress sympathetic nervous system activity and thus reduce energy expenditure, while the neurotransmitters that inhibit food intake, such as serotonin, dopamine, cholecystokinin, have the reverse effect of decreasing appetite and stimulating energy expenditure. There is evidence that hormones such as insulin and the concentrations of nutrients such as glucose and amino acids all playa role. Leptin is a recently discovered hormone, which is synthesized in fat and acts on the hypothalamus to suppress food intake and increase energy expenditure. Its concentration is high in nearly all obese people, and falls with weight loss, possibly suggesting some resistance to the central effects of leptin in obesity.617",

It is frequently ignored by the pediatrician or viewed as a form of social deviancy, and blame for treatment failure is placed on the patients or their families. 624 Management is often unsuccessful. 614 There is increasing trend to direct treatment at prevention and early identification, with dietary and lifestyle management. At well child examinations, pediatricians need to identify high risk infants and children and discuss preventive measures such as dietary changes, change in lifestyle and behavior modications. 615, 623 In the future, new information from molecular biology-such as more research on the role of leptin in obesity-and molecular genetics may provide definitive early identification of individuals who are susceptible to developing obesity. 636 Diet and exercise remain the cornerstones in the Western management of obesity.628 A multidisciplinary team consisting of a pediatrician, a nutritionist, a psychotherapist and other ancillary personnel-the number increases with the level of academic involvement of the clinic-devise an appropriate treatment regimen. Weight management usually tries to set reasonable weight-loss goals 623,626 consisting of a combination of healthy diet and physical activities to change the sedentary lifestyle. 614,623 The theory is that a reduction of 500 kcaVday would result in the loss of lIb (500 g) of fat per week. 255 The specialists recognize that family involvement is crucial in management of childhood obesity.614,620,621,623,626,637 Children's food preferences and physical activity (or inactivity) are often influenced by parents. 621 Family readiness to change would also influence therapy. 626 Long-term success requires parental support to motivate the child in continuing the healthier lifestyle and eating habits. 621 Anorexic medications have significant side-effects such as heart disease, pulmonary hypertension, and are not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in pediatric populations.

They are fearful and worried on the inside, but outwardly may appear apathetic: \"I don't care if people call me fat.\" Their \"I don't care\" attitude presents a challenge to the psychotherapist. The Kidney and Lung deficiency combination would have manifestations of both Kidney Yang and Lung Qi deficiency. These children have a difficult time with exercise because they easily become short of breath and start coughing when they do anything physically strenuous. Hypertension and cardiovascular complications would be the most common in this group. Emotionally, these children are sad and fearful, a combination that makes them withdrawn and depressed. It usually takes many sessions before these children would look at the therapist in the eye and open up to talk about themselves. This group of children would include \"normally obese\" children who developed obesity at an early age, and \"abnormally obese\" children with congenital syndromes, such as Prader-Willi or Beckwith syndromes that have other anomalies, including renal and eNS (Kidney-marrow) abnormalities.",

            "text": "AOM is one of the most common pediatric infectious conditions. It is most prevalent in young children of 8-24 months of age. Approximately two-thirds of all children will have had at least one episode of AOM before age 3 years, and half of them will have recurrences of chronic otitis media with effusion (OME) into early elementary school years. 659 The pathogenesis of otitis media is primarily mediated through eustachian tube dysfunction. The eustachian tube protects the middle ear from nasopharyngeal secretions, provides drainage into the nasopharynx of secretions produced within the middle ear, and permits equilibration of air pressure with atmospheric pressure in the middle ear. Infants and children are vulnerable to developing middle ear infection because: (1) their eustachian tubes are shorter and more horizontal so that drainage of middle ear is impaired; (2) they are prone to develop congestion from acute upper respiratory tract infection, from smoke or environmental allergens and pollutants. 668,675,676 The congestion generates a negative middle ear pressure, resulting in intermittent obstruction of the eustachian tube 676 that can lead to bacterial colonization.F\" Children have inadequate mucociliary function that is necessary for maintaining eustachian tube sterility. 677 Clinically, the child with AOM presents with earache, and fever, usually accompanied by upper respiratory tract symptoms such as rhinorrhea. The tympanic membrane on otoscopic examination varies from hyperemic with preservation of landmarks, to a bright red, tense, bulging, distorted appearance. In the advanced stage of suppuration, the tympanic membrane ruptures with a gush of purulent, or bloody tinged fluid from the ear. 394 Since viral or bacterial otitis usually cannot be distinguished by otoscopic examination, AOM is usually treated empirically, using antibiotics such as amoxicillin that have a high concentration in the middle ear f1uid. 678, 679 However, the widespread use of antibiotics has resulted in increasing resistance to the more common medications. 666,668 Currently, 10% of children with acute otitis media are recalcitrant to antibiotic therapy.68o The prevalence of resistant organisms tends to increase in the winter months. 681 Economically, treatment failure due to drug resistance has been responsible for further escalating the billions of dollars spent treating acute otitis media. 682 In addition, antimicrobials suppress the normal flora, which is beneficial to the host because it has the capabilities to interfere with and therefore prevent pathogenic infections, and may enhance recovery from upper respiratory tract infections. 681 On the other hand, since the advent of antibiotics, complications such as mastoiditis and intracranial infections have significantly decreased. 77, 394 The current focus is on prevention. Breast feeding confers lifesaving protection against infectious illness, including otitis. 683,684 Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV), approved in 2000 for use in the US, covers the seven serotypes that account for about 80% of invasive infections in children younger than 6 years of age. This vaccine was demonstrated to have more than 90% efficacy,673 and has resulted in a modest reduction of total episodes of AOM. 685 The goal of pneumococcal vaccine is to prevent symptomatic infections in the middle ear and to prevent colonization of pneumococci that can cause subsequent middle ear infections. 686 It may eliminate nasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococci. 687 However, since PCV only prevents disease due to the most common serotypes, there is concern that the nonvaccine serotypes will become more common, especially in children less than 2 years of age. 685 An effective RSV vaccine for the infant and young child could markedly decrease otitis media disease. 661 Intranasal spray of attenuated viruses is currently under investigation, in the hope that early antiviral therapy would reduce the risk of otitis media following respiratory tract infections. 662,665",

Complications of sore throat are now so rare that an adverse drug reaction from antibiotic therapy is more likely.718 Tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy for recurrent pharyngitis remains controversial. 694,719",

Generalized seizure may be the first presentation of bacterial sepsis and meningitis in infants and young children. Mechanisms of seizure production in infection include venous thrombosis, cerebritis, abscess formation, and subdural effusions.

Interferons are proteins that can induce a nonspecific resistance to viral infection. However, the usual route of administration is by intramuscular injection, usually given on a daily basis because its blood concentration decreases sharply within 24 hours. In view of the self-limiting nature of URI, and the trauma of daily injections, it is unlikely that interferon would be used to treat URI in children. 776 Histamine antagonists are not indicated in the common cold. 777 Anti-inflammatory mediators 764 and specific antiviral agents 778 may be promising. Development of an effective vaccine against the common cold is unlikely because of the large number of viral serotypes.?56 Rhinovirus, for example, has at least 100 different immunotypes. 765 Although viral URI is a benign illness of short duration, it can lead to bacterial complications, such as otitis media, sinusitis and lower respiratory tract infections, or even mastoiditis and meningitis that have much more significant consequences in children. 761,779 Antibiotics are appropriate for otitis and sinusitis. 780 Younger infants are especially susceptible to development of more serious bacterial infections. A 3-week-old baby with low-grade fever and congestion may warrant a full septic workup to rule out sepsis and meningitis, whereas a school-aged child is simply kept home from school and given symptomatic treatment for congestion and antipyretics for fever.",

In children under age 2, invasive techniques, such as transurethral catheterization or suprapubic bladder tap, are needed to obtain an uncontaminated urine specirnen.P? Greater than 100 000 colonies of bacteria is diagnostic for UTI. The most common organism in children is Escherichia coli,797 accounting for 90% of first episodes of acute cystitis in children and 75% of recurrent infections. 394 The pathogenic virulence of E. coli in UTI is in its ability to adhere to uroepithelial cells and red blood cells. 394 Other enteric bacteria, such as Enterobacter, Klebsiella, and Proteus may also cause pediatric UTI. Adolescent girls are susceptible to Staphylococcus saprophyticus. 394 The Subcommittee also recommends that all 2-24-month-olds should undergo complete imaging studies to include ultrasonography and voiding cystourethrogram.P? in order to assess the abnormalities that predispose children to reflux and pyelonephritis and to assess the extent of renal involvement during infection. 7 95,800 There is no agreement on the most appropriate combination of studies in older children,798 since subjecting the child to an invasive procedure is weighed against the low possibility of finding a congenital anomaly. 7 91 Prompt diagnosis and treatment are important in order to prevent pyelonephritic scarring, especially in the first year of life. 801 Renal scarring is associated with development of hypertension in about 10% of children and accounts for approximately 20% of children with end-stage renal disease requiring dialysis or even renal transplant. 7 96,802 The severity of renal scarring is directly related to delay in diagnosis. 803 Acute infection is managed with antibiotics for 7-14 days if an appropriate clinical response is observed.T'? A repeat microbiologic examination 48-72 hours after institution of treatment, and a follow-up culture within a week after cessation of therapy are recommended. 394,793 Prophylaxis is also important in pediatric UTI. Children who are found to have vesicoureteric reflux are managed with a single, daily dose of antibiotics for 3-6 months in order to prevent recurrence. 394,797,802 Children with underlying genitourinary abnormalities, such as congenital anomalies, obstructive uropathy, need to be treated for at least 1 year. 394 High-risk children, such as siblings, should be investigated for reflux. 802,803 Adolescents should be counseled about the relationship between sexual activities and the development of UTI. 794 Asymptomatic bacteriuria has been a topic of concern for pediatricians. At this time, there does not appear to be any need for general screening for bacteriuria in healthy infants and children. Although bacteriuria may be found in 1-2% of the pediatric population, asymptomatic children have a very high rate of spontaneous clearing of the bacteriuria,796 which in itself does not destroy the renal parenchyma.P!",

The inflammation of Heat from bacteria normally rises, so the presence of Dampness would retain the Heat in the Lower Energizer. External Dampness can easily enter the body by penetrating the leg channels, then flowing upwards to settle in the Bladder.

Spleen deficiency results in insufficient transformation and transportation of food and fluid, resulting in accumulation of Dampness and turbidity that can obstruct the circulation of Qi and Blood, leading to abdominal pain and diarrhea. There are usually other signs of Spleen deficiency, such as fatigue, pallor, and abdominal distension.Treatment\u2022 ST-40 to expel Damp \u2022 SP-3, SP-6, BL-20 to tonify Spleen \u2022 Vigorous tonification of the Spleen with the Five-Element four-point protocol: -Tonify SP-2, HT-8; sedate SP-l, LR-l \u2022 CV-12 tonifies Middle Energizer \u2022 Decrease intake of sweets, greasy/fried foods, and Phlegm-producing foods.Damp Heat in the IntestinesChildren can have lingering Heat when external Heat invasions are not adequately expelled. Chronic consumption of an excess amount of energetically Hot and spicy foods can also cause Heat accumulation. Physiologically, Heat usually rises. However, the presence of Dampness would \"drag\" the Heat downward into the Lower Energizer. External Dampness enters the body by penetrating channels of the legs and flows up to the Spleen where it obstructs its function of transformation and transportation. Internal Dampness can result from the Spleen deficiency factors listed above. Dampness and turbidity from Spleen deficiency can accumulate in the Intestines and also transform into Heat. Damp Heat in the Intestines is injurious to the intestinal wall and blood vessels, and interferes with fluid absorption. It prevents the Intestines from performing their functions of food and Qi conduction, resulting in abdominal pain and diarrhea. Damp Heat coagulates with Qi and Blood, causing Blood stasis that further obstructs Blood vessels and Qi channels. Bleeding occurs in the presence of Blood stasis because non-coagulated Blood cannot pass through the blood vessels and leaks out of the vessels. The Large Intestine is more affected because of its Yang Ming-Tai Yin relationship with Stomach and Spleen.CD correlates to Damp Heat in the Small Intestine, and DC correlates to Damp Heat and Blood stasis in the Large Intestine, manifesting as bloody diarrhea and severe abdominal pain.Treatment for Damp Heat in CD and UC\u2022 Eliminate or decrease energetically Hot foods, greasy/fried foods; excessive sweets, and Phlegm-producing foods \u2022 LI-l1 to clear overall Heat \u2022 TE-6 clears Heat from the Intestines and promotes bowel movements\u2022 CV-tO resolves Dampness and stimulates descending of Qi in the Intestines \u2022 Resolve Dampness: -ST-44 to resolve Dampness -SP-9 to resolve Damp Heat \u2022 ST-25 to stop diarrhea \u2022 CV-6 to tonify Lower Energizer \u2022 Tonify Spleen.

The most common viral culprits are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),661 influenza virus,662 and adenoviruses. 394 Viruses cause ear infection by direct invasion of the middle ear and disrupt eustachian tube function,663 or by inducing inflammatory injury that facilitates attachment of bacteria to respiratory epithelial cells. 664,665 Two-thirds of middle ear infections are due to bacteria.I'\" The predominant organisms are pneumococci, Haemophilus injluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis,666-669 and group B streptococci.V'' Bacterial pathogens adhere to mucous membranes and colonization ensues. The severity of infection or response to the invading bacteria depend on the health of the child's immune system.668 The humoral system is especially significant in protecting the middle ear cavity from disease, and the nasopharyngeal lymphoid tissues are the first line of defense against bacterial colonization.V! The sterility of the eustachian tube and tympanic cavity depends on mucociliary system and secretion of antimicrobial molecules, such as lysozyme, lactoferrin, and beta-defensins. 672 There is evidence that a number of children with recurrent episodes of AOM have minor immunologic defects;671 Pneumococcus is by far the most virulent of AOM bacteria. It causes approximately 6 million cases of otitis media annually in the US.673 Uncontrolled pneumococcal otitis can lead to meningiris.V\" Pneumolysin, the pneumococcal toxin, is especially injurious to cell walls and can induce severe tissue injury.674 Other etiologic agents include Mycoplasma and Chlamydia. 394 Incidence of AOM is higher in winter and early spring.",

If it's not available, choose asparagus, apples, carrots, celery, pear, or mango; and avoid Hot foods such as garlic and ginger.Children are constitutionally Lung deficient. The Lung is considered \"immature\" and vulnerable to Cold and Dryness.The increasing incidence of asthma in younger children can be explained by the Five-Element Theory of Development. Infants and younger children are in the Water phase of development, when the Kidney is vulnerable. The Kidney and Lung have a very close relationship. Kidney Jing or Essence correlates with Western concept of genetic predisposition. It is also closely related to the Corporeal Soul, which resides in the Lung and which provides physical sensations, such as breathing and itchiness. The Kidney Yang is the source of all the Yang in the body and is the root of the Defensive Wei Qi, The Kidney Yang enables the sorting out or filtering of clear fluid from dirty fluid that needs to be excreted. The clear fluid flows up the Bladder meridian, along the back and neck in the skin and muscles where it mingles with Defensive Qi. This becomes the first line of protection, the Tai Yang stage, against Wind-Cold invasion, or viral infection. In addition to diminished Wei Qi circulation and increased susceptibility to viral infection, there is also less clear fluid going up toward the Upper Energizer, making it more likely for the Western concept of formation of \"mucus plugs\" and diminished \"mucociliary clearance.\" Lung deficiency results in inadequate descension and dispersion of Qi. The weak Kidney in turn cannot receive and anchor Qi, resulting in upward, \"rebellious\" Qi movement manifesting as cough and wheezing. With repeated occurrence, there is development of internal Cold which further contracts the channels, further diminishing circulation of Qi and fluid, making the child more easily susceptible to subsequent Wind-Cold attacks; to other external insults that are irritating to the airway, such as pollutants and smoke; and to ingestion of Cold foods. The Kidney and Lung relationship also explains prevalence of asthma during the autumn and winter seasons, because Lung is Metal, which corresponds to fall, and Kidney is Water, which corresponds to winter. 142Acute attack: use the same protocol as for external Wind invasion. Tonification between attacks as follows: Decrease spicy and salty foods that are harmful to the Lung and Kidney \u2022 Minimize exposure to environmental allergens, e.g. smoke.",

From the Five-Element developmental standpoint, these children are in the Wood phase of development when the Liver is most vulnerable. Children are constitutionally Liver Yin deficient, and at this Wood phase tend to easily become Yang excessed, manifest with Liver Yang rising symptoms such as motor symptoms of hyperactivity or emotional symptoms of being easily irritated, frustrated, angered and being very impatient. Liver Yang rising can dry up Lung Yin and quickly weaken the Lung. Liver Qi can stagnate in the chest, obstruct the descension of Lung Qi and result in symptoms of shortness of breath, cough and wheezing. Since Wood/Liver has a destructive relationship with both Earth/Spleen and MetallLung in the Five-Element Cycle, an excess Liver can eventually weaken both the Spleen and the Lung, resulting in simultaneous deficiency of the two organs.Acute attack: use the same protocol as for external Wind invasion. Decrease sour tasting foods, decrease fried foods, and medications \u2022 Help the child explore factors that precipitate emotional stress and find ways to minimize them. \u2022 Teach the child calming techniques such as Qigong or meditation \u2022 Auricular points: Shenmen, Point Zero, Liver, Stress Control (Adrenal), Lung, Asthma points.A prophylaxis treatment described in the literature consists of massaging Bladder points for 3-5 min followed by application of an herbal mixture.H!

Children are constitutionally Spleen deficient. Numerous factors can contribute to further Spleen deficiency: diet rich in Phlegm-producing foods, sweets, and greasy foods; living in a Damp environment; excess mental activities, as with academic overload; excess worrying and stress. Spleen deficiency can be responsible for both generalized convulsions and for absence seizures. Since Wood controls Earth, a weak Spleen is often associated with excess Liver Yang, which can stir up internal Wind. Phlegm can obstruct sensory orifices and invade channels and collaterals. Phlegm obstructs the Heart orifices and \"mists the Mind,\" causing unconsciousness. Whereas insufficient Liver Yin is the basis of the Yin deficiency seizures, the Phlegm in Spleen Yang impedes the available Liver Yin or Blood from lubricating the sinews, resulting in generalized tonicclonic seizures. Gurgling noises or foaming at the mouth during acute attacks are pathognomonic of the presence of Phlegm.

Whereas Western medicine focuses on significant head trauma as the potential cause for focal seizures, Chinese medicine posits that any injury to the headincluding a minor \"bump\" of the head which is usually forgotten-s-can result in localized Blood stasis. Athletic children participate in contact sports and often sustain mild head trauma on the field that would be unnoticed among all the kicks and bruises. Some children, especially boys, do not want to appear \"wimpy\" by complaining about a \"hit\" on the head. Since acupuncture treatment tonifies the child without side-effects, it would, in fact, be advisable to routinely treat young athletes to prevent Blood stasis.
