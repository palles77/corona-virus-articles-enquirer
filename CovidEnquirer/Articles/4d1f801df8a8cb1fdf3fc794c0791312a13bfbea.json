In the case of dyspnea, presentations may range from minor symptoms to extremis.

Stridor from a swollen airway, foreign body, or other airway obstruction is imminently dangerous. Although patients in anaphylaxis may benefit from the nebulized beta-agonist treatment used to treat an asthma exacerbation, it is not sufficient to save their lives.

It is a reversible but recurrent chronic inflammatory disorder that characteristically causes severe dyspnea, wheezing, and coughing. 13 There are 2 main problems in asthma: chronically inflamed airways and hyperresponsive airways. Intermittent airflow obstruction in symptomatic patients results in decreased ability to expire, leading to hyperinflation, stenting open the alveoli, and increasing the work of breathing. Early in an exacerbation, symptoms are bronchospastic secondary to smooth muscle contraction. As an episode progresses, inflammatory changes in the airways can cause increased airway resistance and lead to VQ mismatch (Fig. 11) . The severity of an exacerbation can be assessed clinically and should dictate how aggressively a patient is treated ( Table 6) . Adult Patients with Acute Dyspnea COPD is defined by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) as \"persistent airflow limitation that is usually progressive and associated with an enhanced chronic inflammatory response in the airways and the lung to noxious particles or gases.\" 12 The pathophysiology in each patient is typically a mix of lung parenchymal destruction, as seen in emphysema, and small airway inflammation with airway obstruction, or obstructive bronchiolitis. 11 An exacerbation of COPD presents as dyspnea, cough, and increased sputum production. In the emergent DeVos & Jacobson setting, clinicians must treat the airflow limitation. As with asthma, monitoring of pulse oximetry, degree of respiratory distress, and hemodynamic stability can help clinicians anticipate the degree of severity of a particular exacerbation. More specific testing may also have a role, because radiographs and electrocardiograms may help differentiate other causes of shortness of breath from a COPD exacerbation. In addition, an increase in sputum production or the presence of purulent sputum should be treated with antibiotics, regardless of other infectious symptoms. 14 Anaphylaxis is a sudden, potentially fatal, allergic reaction involving multiple organ systems. 15, 16 The Second Symposium on the Definition and Management of Anaphylaxis lists the following clinical criteria for diagnosis of anaphylaxis:",

American College of Emergency Physicians clinical policy makes level B recommendations that standard clinical judgment can be improved with the use of a single B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) or N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide measurement to rule in or out the diagnosis of CHF. 19 However, the true utility, may be in patients with dyspnea not expected to have a CHF exacerbation, when finding a positive BNP would change management and allow a faster initiation of treatment. 20 Carpenter and colleagues 20 found that the classic constellation of symptoms (jugular venous distension, peripheral edema, rales, and S3) were no more predictive of patients with both pulmonary edema on chest radiograph and an increased BNP level greater than 500 pg/dL than any individual finding alone. Although rales were the most sensitive finding tested for either outcome, they had specificity of only about 50% each. Jugular venous distention and S3 gallop were the individual findings most predictive for pulmonary edema on radiograph or increased BNP level. Ultrasonography measurements of the inferior vena cava also improve diagnostic accuracy versus BNP and chest radiograph alone. 21 The medics are back in your department, this time with a 75-year-old man with cough and fever. His family is worried that he has been eating less and is sleepier than at hospital discharge last week. In pneumonia, the diffusion of oxygen is limited by alveolar infiltrates, leading to shortness of breath. Common complaints and findings in community-acquired pneumonia include fever, cough, pleuritic chest pain, and sputum production, along with dyspnea. However, these clinical criteria may have a sensitivity as low as 50% compared with a chest radiograph. 22 On examination, many patients have crackles or evidence of consolidation. Guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America and the American Thoracic Society, recommend chest radiograph in patients with suspected pneumonia, which may show lobular consolidation, interstitial infiltrate, or cavitation. 23 Although infiltrate with suggestive symptoms makes the diagnosis, infiltrate may not be visible initially on patients with volume depletion. It is appropriate to treat empirically for 24 to 48 hours in these cases and to reimage when hydration is restored.",

These classifications identify typical pathogens and guide appropriate initial management. Important historical exposures and risk factors to refine treatment are summarized in Table 7 . 23 The American Thoracic Society along with the Infectious Disease Society of America's consensus statement offers 4 important principles in the initial management and evaluation of adult patients with bacterial HAP, VAP, or HCAP; the most important to be accomplished in the ED is to promptly treat with \"appropriate and adequate therapy\" to decrease mortality. 24 ",

She smokes, uses hormonal birth control, and reports that her symptoms started when she came back from a business trip. Pulmonary embolism (PE) interferes with both ventilation and perfusion. It ultimately causes circulatory collapse because of obstruction of right ventricular outflow eventually causing increased pulmonary artery pressure and failure of the right then left ventricles. Before circulatory collapse, echocardiography can show signs of right ventricular (RV) strain, including dilatation of the right ventricle, RV hypokinesis, paradoxic septal wall motion, McConnell sign (hypokinesis of the free RV wall with sparing of the apex), and tricuspid regurgitation. 25 Dresden and colleagues 26 supported the use of ultrasonography in moderate-risk to high-risk patients to determine whether the patients were appropriate for anticoagulation while awaiting definitive imaging. Early anticoagulation is recommended to improve mortality and there is evidence to support anticoagulation before diagnosis in patients with a Wells score greater than 4 who will have a delay to diagnosis of more than 1 hour and 40 minutes. 27, 28 The assessment of patients with dyspnea and concern for PE requires a series of risk stratification. One common method is to use Wells criteria 29 (Box 1) in patients with suspicion for PE; although other stratification tools exist, none has been shown to be clearly superior. When there is low clinical suspicion for PE, PERC (pulmonary embolism rule-out criteria) 30 rules or D-dimer testing may be applied. 27 If PERC (Box 2) is negative, or there is intermediate pretest probability for PE with negative high-sensitivity D-dimer, no further testing for PE is required. 27 When further testing is needed (positive D-dimer or high-sensitivity D-dimer not available), negative CT angiogram or low-probability VQ scan may be used to rule out PE.",

Using cues from the history and physical examination, practitioners may guide the work-up and treatment to identify a parenchymal, obstructive, circulatory, or compensatory cause of dyspnea. Early use of bedside testing, including ultrasonography, may limit unnecessary tests and save time in determining the best treatment course. Thus ensuring both the best care for the patient and also the physician's ability to readily respond to the next case.",
