Children are the most susceptible group to the 221 development of the disease. ARIs can lead to serious diseases such as bronchiolitis 222 and pneumonia and sometimes even cause death in infants and children worldwide 223 [25]. Nevertheless, most of the data on the epidemiological features and etiological 224 structure of ARIs were from more-developed countries, and less is known about the 225 etiology of ARIs in Russia. In the present study, we examined the viral etiology of 226 ARIs in hospitalized children in Novosibirsk by Real-Time RT-PCR assay. 227 We detected at least one of the tested viruses in 72.3% (1128/1560) of the samples. 228 In similar studies conducted in different regions of the world, the virus detection rate 229 ranged from less than 50% to 75% [26-28]. For example, in studies performed in 230 China, the proportion of positive samples in children with ARIs ranged from 37.6% 231 to 78.7% [14,16,29,30]. The previous study of respiratory infections among children 232 in European part of Russia revealed the 71.5% detection rate of respiratory viruses 233 [31]. 234 The percentage of the respiratory viruses' detection varies in different years in 235 different regions, which may be associated with climatic and environmental factors, seasonality of sampling can also lead to differences in the level of viruses' 238 detection in various studies. Thus, Ju X. et al. carried out a study continuously from 239 July 2011 through July 2013 and found 48.66 % of samples to be positive for at least 240 one respiratory virus",

However, we observed a decrease 247 in the respiratory viruses' detection rate with age, with the lowest detection rate in 248 school-age children compared to children under 7 years of age (55.3% versus 76.4%, 249 respectively). These data are consistent with findings obtained in other regions of 250 Russia [31] and it may be due to decreased sensitivity to respiratory virus infections 251 in older children. 252 Etiology of ARIs and the respiratory virus prevalence varies in different studies. In 253the United States, IFV, HRSV and HPIV were the most frequently detected[33].254 Studies conducted in France have shown that metapneumovirus and respiratory 255 syncytial virus are the most common [34]. IFV, HRSV and HRV were the most 256 commonly detected respiratory viruses among children with ARIs in most regions 257 of China [13]. The study of ARIs etiologic structure showed that HRSV, HRV, HPIV study the most common viruses detected were HRSV and IFV, followed by 261 HRV. The age distribution of ARIs indicated that children under 3 years old were 262 more likely to be infected by HRSV confirmed the importance of RSV in children 263 with ARIs, especially in children < 4 years of age [35-38]. We observed a high rate 264 of RSV-detections in 2013 -2014 (44.4%), while in 2016 -2017 it was less than 265 10% which could be due to the annual variation in the circulation pattern of RSV. 266 Such year-to-year variation in the epidemiological patterns of viral infections 267 confirms importance of the long-term study of the ARIs epidemiology [39]. 268 Influenza virus is one of the major causative agents of respiratory disease in humans 269 and leads to a more severe disease than the common cold which is caused by a 270 different type of virus [40]. In temperate countries influenza outbreaks usually occur 271 during the winter season. Finally, in our study, IFV (344/1560, 22.1%) was the 272 second most frequent detected pathogen with markable seasonality in winter months. 273 During the 2013-2014 epidemic season, influenza virus detection rate was low -274 6.9% of all respiratory viruses, which was in accordance with the official influenza 275 surveillance results of Ministry of Health, Russia [41]. In 2014-2015, influenza 276 viruses were detected in 17.2% among all respiratory viruses. Herewith, the 277 percentage of influenza A virus accounted for 73.3% and influenza B virus -26.7% 278 of all detected influenza viruses. At the same time, in Russia influenza B was the 279 main etiological agent, accounting for 50.6% of all detected influenza viruses. In cases [41]. In our study influenza A and B viruses were detected with 284 approximately the same frequency (48% and 52% respectively). 285 With the introduction of molecular techniques, the detection of multiple co-infecting 286 viruses has become common, though the prevalence of each virus varies between 287 studies [42]. In our study detection rate of viral co-infection was 14.5% among the 288 positive samples. According to the previous reports, the incidence of viral co-289 infection in children can reach 30% [43].
