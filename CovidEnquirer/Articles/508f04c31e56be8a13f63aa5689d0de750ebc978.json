With the onset of complete obstruction, stridor may become barely audible as minimal air moves through the critically narrowed airway. 4 The laryngeal anatomy of children makes them particularly susceptible to narrowing of the upper airways. The larynx of a neonate is situated high in the neck, and the epiglottis is narrow, omega-shaped (\u03c9), and vertically positioned. 5 The narrowest segment of the pediatric airway is the subglottic region (in adults, it is at the glottic level), which is encircled by the rigid cricoid cartilage ring. There is nonfibrous, loosely attached mucosa in this region that is easily obstructed in the presence of subglottic edema. In addition, the cartilaginous support of the infant airway is soft and compliant, easily allowing dynamic collapse of the airways during inspiration. Young children have proportionally large heads and relatively lax neck support; this combination increases the likelihood of airway obstruction when supine. 6 Also, their tongues are relatively large for the size of the oropharynx. Simple mathematics shows why a small amount of edema has such a profound effect on the cross-sectional area and hence air flow. The diameter of the subglottis in a normal newborn is approximately 5 mm, and 0.5-mm edema in this region reduces the cross-sectional area to 64% of normal (area = \u03c0 \u221e radius 2 ). Air flow is directly proportional to the airway radius to the fourth power (Poiseuille's law), so a small reduction in caliber has a major effect on flow rate. The same 5-mm airway with 0.5 mm edema will have a flow rate of only 41% of baseline, assuming that pressure remains unchanged-a situation that is not necessarily the case if the Bernoulli principle is in play. Because the caliber of the airway is almost inevitably reduced further in accord with the Bernoulli principle, and Poiseuille flow is not established, the flow rate is much further reduced, and the work of breathing is greatly increased to maintain ventilation.",

            "text": "EPIDEMIOLOGY Viral LTB is the most common cause of infective upper airway obstruction in the pediatric age group. Affected children are usually of preschool age, with a peak incidence between 18 and 24 months of age. 7 Although viral LTB episodes become uncommon beyond 6 years of age, cases have been reported during later childhood and adolescence, and rarely described in adults. Reported annual incidence rates in preschool children vary from 1.5% to 6%, but less than 5% of these require Upper airway obstruction due to acute infection is not uncommon in children, and many parents have experienced an anxious night with a \"croupy\" child. Although infants and young children are most commonly affected because they have relatively narrow upper airways, older children and adults can also have significant symptoms. Fortunately, these are mostly due to self-limiting viral laryngotracheobronchitis (LTB), but there is also a group of bacterial infections (e.g., epiglottitis, bacterial tracheitis, diphtheria, retropharyngeal abscess, and peritonsillar abscess) that can occasionally cause significant obstruction. It is the job of the emergency physician, pediatrician, pediatric pulmonologist, or otorhinolaryngologist to diagnose more serious infections promptly so that treatment can be instituted early and disastrous obstruction avoided. It is also important to recognize when a simple viral LTB is causing significant problems, so that appropriate treatment can be given immediately. This chapter is clinically oriented and outlines the principal infective causes of upper airway obstruction, with an emphasis on diagnosis and treatment. Confusion exists regarding the nomenclature for these disorders, with some using the term croup to refer to any inflammatory disorder of the upper airway, whereas others restrict its use to subglottic disease (i.e., LTB, which is usually of viral origin). Therefore, for the sake of clarity, the term croup will be largely avoided in this chapter.",

            "text": "The consequence of these upper airway infections is usually stridor, which is a clinical sign and should not be considered a definitive diagnosis. This section briefly outlines the principles behind what causes stridor, which should clarify why this condition mostly affects infants and young children. The appendix in Holinger and colleagues' Pediatric Laryngology and Bronchoesophagology discusses the physics of air flow and fluid dynamics. 1 The laws of fluid dynamics are based on flow through fixed tubes and may not always apply to dynamic airways in vivo. Normally, air flow through the upper airways is laminar, and the moving column of air produces slight negative pressure on the airway walls. 2 Inflammation resulting from infection causes a degree of airway narrowing, which increases the flow rate through the narrowed segment (the Venturi effect). This, in turn, causes a reduction in the pressure exerted on the airway wall. This is the Bernoulli principle. In other words, negative intraluminal pressure increases. This enhances the tendency of the airway to collapse inward, further narrowing the airway and causing turbulent air flow. The respiratory phase (inspiration or expiration) has a differential effect on air flow, depending on whether the obstruction is intrathoracic or extrathoracic ( Fig. 23.1) . Stridor is the sound made by rapid, turbulent flow of air through a narrowed segment of a large airway. It is most often loud, with medium or low pitch, and inspiratory. It usually originates from the larynx, upper trachea, KEYWORDS upper respiratory tract infection upper airway obstruction croup viral laryngotracheobronchitis epiglottitis bacterial tracheitis ABSTRACT This chapter discusses the common and potentially serious infective causes of acute upper airway obstruction in children. The laryngeal anatomy of young children makes them particularly susceptible to upper airway obstruction, and during acute infections this is exacerbated by inflammation and edema of the airway mucosa. The most common cause of infective upper airway obstruction in children is viral laryngotracheobronchitis, or croup, which is usually a mild and self-limiting illness, but management with corticosteroids may still be necessary. Bacterial causes of upper airway obstruction have fortunately become rare since the introduction of the Haemophilus influenzae B (HiB) immunization, but a few cases of epiglottitis do still occur due to nonimmunization, vaccine failure, and infection with non-HiB organisms. These cases constitute a medical emergency due to the risk of rapid progression to complete airway obstruction. Other rare conditions are discussed including bacterial tracheitis, diphtheria, retropharyngeal, and peritonsillar abscesses. Key learning points in this chapter include the main discriminating factors of the various causes of infective upper airway obstruction, the importance of a calm and minimally distressing approach to the child presenting with stridor, and the need for early anesthetic team involvement in cases with a suspected bacterial etiology or signs of impending airway obstruction.",

Infections caused by other common organisms, including other PIV subtypes, occur more commonly as isolated infections. Infection is via droplet spread or direct inoculation from the hands.

Less is known about the clinical presentation of PIV 4, but it is reported to result in milder clinical illness and is infrequently associated with croup symptoms. 11 The PIVs belong to the Paramyxoviridae family, along with respiratory syncytial virus, measles, mumps, and the recently identified human metapneumovirus. 12 Together the PIVs account for more than 75% of viral LTB cases, although other respiratory viruses (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus, human bocavirus, and enteroviruses) can produce a similar clinical syndrome. Herpes viruses and influenza viruses tend to cause a more severe and protracted form of the disease. 13 LTB can also occur with some systemic infections, such as measles and, less commonly, mycoplasma.

In addition to relative differences in airway size (discussed earlier in the chapter), it is suggested that poor cell-mediated immunity in younger age groups also accounts for differences observed between adults and children. 14 The epithelium of the subglottis possesses abundant mucous glands, secretions from which can further narrow the airway lumen in response to infection. The PIVs are trophic for the respiratory epithelium, binding in particular to ciliated cells via an interaction between the viral hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein and its receptor, sialic acid. Other viral proteins (the F protein in particular) are important in membrane fusion and the passage of viral particles between cells. Many strains of PIV are cytopathic, with infection leading to the formation of giant cells and cell death. As with many infective processes, the ensuing inflammatory response is involved in the evolution of symptoms. Both polymorphonuclear and monocytic leukocytes infiltrate the subepithelium, which leads to vascular congestion and airway wall edema. In addition, the symptoms of viral LTB are believed to be caused by the release of spasmogenic mediators, leading to decreased airway diameter. This may result from a type I hypersensitivity response to PIV, and some authors have postulated a role for anti-PIVspecific immunoglobulin E (IgE) in the development of airway narrowing. 15 These factors may play a relatively greater role",

Symptoms may partly mimic those of viral LTB and will depend on the location of the foreign body, the degree of resultant airway obstruction, and (to a lesser extent) the nature of the foreign body. Onset of symptoms may be either acute or insidious; a large foreign body may cause severe obstruction, whereas a smaller one may simply lead to laryngeal and tracheal irritation and airway edema. In cases of severe airway obstruction, the voice may be lost and breath sounds quiet. This condition is an emergency, and requires immediate visualization of the larynx and trachea and removal of the foreign body by a physician or surgeon experienced in this procedure. Occasionally an unrecognized inhaled foreign body leads to chronic stridor. Acute upper airway obstruction may also result from the ingestion of caustic substances, with resulting pharyngeal burns, edema, and inflammation of the epiglottis, aryepiglottic folds, larynx, and trachea. This diagnosis is usually clear from the history. Rarely, angioneurotic edema may cause acute laryngeal swelling and airway obstruction. Patients appear nontoxic and may exhibit other signs of allergic disease, such as urticaria and abdominal pain. In hereditary angioneurotic edema due to C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency, the family history may be positive, although the first presentation is more common in adults than in children. Hypocalcemia, for example, due to hypoparathyroidism, can lead to laryngospasm (a form of tetany), which can cause stridor with significant airway obstruction. 21 There are numerous causes of chronic airway obstruction that are discussed elsewhere in this book. Confusion may arise when an upper respiratory tract infection unmasks a previously asymptomatic congenital abnormality. For example, mild subglottic stenosis may cause symptoms only with the additional burden of airway edema due to a simple viral upper respiratory infection. It is important to ensure that there is no history of intubation (which may have been brief, as in resuscitation of a newborn in the maternity unit) or of any coexisting signs (e.g., a cutaneous hemangioma) that may increase the index of suspicion for a congenital airway abnormality. One catch with subglottic hemangiomata is that they may initially respond to systemic steroids, and thus their diagnosis may be masked with the assumption that stridor was due to viral croup. 22",

Attacks often occur suddenly, at night, and may resolve equally quickly. Treatment must be guided by the degree of severity, and is similar to that for viral LTB. Some practitioners prescribe oral or inhaled corticosteroids (via a nebulizer) to be kept at home and administered by the parents in case of an episode, although there is a paucity of evidence for or against this practice in spasmodic croup. of this Cochrane review, the authors concluded with funnel plots and other statistical methods that these results were not influenced by publication bias. In conclusion, there is convincing evidence that corticosteroids provide effective and sustained treatment of croup symptoms, leading to clinical improvement within 6 hours of administration. In severe disease, rates of intubation are significantly decreased and the duration of intubation is reduced, and in moderate disease admission, the need for additional treatment and return visits are reduced. 8 More recent studies have focused attention on the optimal formulation, dose, and treatment regimen.",

If this preparation were not available at a home visit, prednisolone (at an equivalent dose of 1 mg/kg) could provide a useful substitute. Due to the short duration of symptoms in a typically episode of croup, one dose of steroid is usually sufficient treatment. However, a second dose should be considered if residual symptoms are still present the following day, and can be given to the parents to administer at their discretion.",

A total of 4299 children were included, the majority from double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Outcome measures included the croup score (most commonly the Westley scale), the requirement for admission or return visit, the length of stay, the requirement for additional therapeutic interventions, and overall assessment of \"improvement\" (indicated by a minimum incremental improvement in croup score or subjective relief of symptoms). Overall, treatment led to an improvement in the croup score at 6 and 12 hours, with a number needed to treat (NNT) of 5 calculated in order to achieve clinical improvement in one child at both those time points. The improvement was no longer apparent at 24 hours, but this was thought to be a reflection of reduced statistical power due to the small number of participants evaluated at 24 hours. The length of time spent in either the emergency department or the hospital was also significantly decreased, as was the requirement for nebulized epinephrine. Importantly, and in contrast to the first version compared with either 30% humidified oxygen, 100% oxygen plus epinephrine, or against no treatment. No pooled analysis was possible, as each study used a different comparator. Collectively, these studies provided evidence of a short-term benefit of Heliox inhalation, with improved croup scores at 60 to 90 minutes following administration. However, this clinical improvement was not sustained over subsequent hours. The authors summarized that no additional benefit appeared to have been provided by Heliox beyond that delivered by administration of 30% oxygen in cases of mild croup, or 100% oxygen plus nebulized epinephrine in moderate to severe croup. Adequately powered studies are required to further evaluate the role of Heliox in the management of moderate to severe croup.",

Intubation should be performed by the most experienced person available, and it should be attempted with an uncuffed endotracheal tube one size smaller than the usual size for the child. 43 Facilities for immediate tracheostomy must be available at the time of intubation. Children may have coexisting lower airway and parenchymal involvement that impairs gas exchange and may lead to slower than expected clinical improvement after intubation. Rarely, pulmonary edema may develop after relief of airway obstruction, particularly if the disease course has been prolonged. Most children without severe parenchymal involvement require respiratory support for 3 to 5 days. 43 This is one context in which multiple rather than single doses of corticosteroids are often administered.

            "text": "Duration of hospitalization was also significantly reduced with epinephrine (mean difference of 32 hours), although this outcome was only assessed in one study. No studies provided a comparison of intubation rate or side effect profile. In summary, nebulized epinephrine has been shown to improve clinical severity in the short term and reduce hospital admission in cases of moderate to severe croup. It should be used in any child who has severe signs and symptoms, and it should be considered for those with moderate signs and symptoms, depending on the signs of respiratory distress and possible response to corticosteroid administration. It can be administered in the home setting while awaiting an ambulance, but clearly any child requiring this treatment at home must be transferred promptly to the hospital for monitoring. Multiple doses may be administered, although the requirement for this must lead to consideration of the need for intensive care management. Although rebound worsening of symptoms after administration of nebulized epinephrine is often alluded to, in practice, this phenomenon does not appear to be a real risk. Traditionally, children treated with epinephrine have been admitted to the hospital, but recent studies have confirmed that discharge home is safe after 3 to 4 hours of observation if the child has made significant improvement. 38 Most clinical trials have used the racemic form of this drug, 39 although there is evidence that the L-isomer used alone (which is the only available formulation in some units) may be equally effective and has a longer duration of action. 40 The mechanisms of action are believed to be a combination of rapid reduction in airway wall edema and bronchodilation. The recommended dose is 0.4 to 0.5 mL/kg (to a maximum of 5 mL) of the 1 : 1000 preparation that is put undiluted into the nebulizer cup. Intramuscular epinephrine is not used in severe stridor, so it is important to ensure the stridor is not due to acute anaphylaxis, in which case it should be given.",

Oxygen should be administered to any child with severe airway obstruction, even in the absence of severe hypoxia, because it will aid respiratory muscle function. As mentioned earlier, a child with severe respiratory distress and obstruction may have normal pulse oximetry readings when breathing oxygen, which can be dangerous if misinterpreted by staff who are unaware of this limitation. Heliox (70% to 80% helium with 20% to 30% oxygen) has been used in both upper airway obstruction 41 and severe asthma, and it is the focus of a recent Cochrane review. 42 Three randomized controlled trials were identified totaling 91 participants with croup of varying severity. Heliox was Hispanic Americans, and 12.4 among Native Americans and Alaskan natives. 48 Nevertheless, cases of epiglottitis due to HiB continue to be reported, 52 as do cases due to other organisms. 53 Cases of invasive HiB occur principally in nonimmunized children, but also rarely in some true vaccine failures. Clinical risk factors for vaccine failure include prematurity, Down syndrome, malignancy, developmental delay, and congenital or acquired immunodeficiency, principally with reduced immunoglobulin concentrations (IgG 2 subclass, IgA, IgM) or neutropenia. 54 However, these factors explain fewer than 50% of cases of vaccine failures. 54 An HiB IgG antibody titer of \u22650.15 \u00b5g/mL confers protection from disease, but given the natural waning in antibody levels, it is estimated that a titer of \u22651.0 \u00b5g/mL should provide long-term protection. 52 However, sometimes there are qualitative functional problems with antibody responses that are not yet fully elucidated.",

Viral coinfection may have a role in the transition from colonization to invasion. 59 Colonies of HiB organisms reside in the nasal mucosal epithelium and submucosa. Invasive disease occurs when organisms disseminate from the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract via the bloodstream; bacteremia increases over a period of hours, and metastatic seeding can occur. 58 Thus, although situated in close proximity to the nose, the supraglottic area is likely to be affected via the bloodstream; direct spread along mucosal surfaces may also play a part. This may account for the relatively high yield of positive blood cultures in epiglottitis and the relatively low incidence of epiglottitis among carriers of HiB. of complete immunity and the variety of agents that can cause viral LTB mean that more than one episode is not uncommon, particularly in separate seasons.",

Evaluation of patients in this group is aimed at identifying an underlying airway abnormality that would predispose the child to more severe airway narrowing with viral infections, or that could cause problems independently of such infection. Investigation is usually centered on airway endoscopy. This must be performed in a unit and by an operator who is experienced in the technique because there is a risk of exacerbating the airway obstruction. Spontaneous breathing is necessary to identify vocal cord problems or airway malacia, and anesthetic techniques must be carefully considered. If an inhaled foreign body is considered likely, rigid bronchoscopy is the study of choice. Additional studies that might be considered once the acute episode has resolved include plain lateral neck and chest radiographs, computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, contrast assessment of the upper airway (e.g., videofluoroscopy, barium swallow), and a pH probe study. Polysomnography may help determine the severity of chronic symptoms. Rarer causes of recurrent stridor (e.g., hypocalcaemia or angioneurotic edema) are diagnosed by blood testing.",

It is a medical emergency that can be alarming for the medical staff and devastating for the family. Epiglottitis clearly has not been eliminated, but due to its rarity there are concerns about a potential lack of familiarity with its management among emergency physicians, pediatricians, anesthesiologists, and otolaryngologists. 60 Up to 20% of infants with epiglottitis are misdiagnosed initially, usually with viral LTB. 4 Typically there is a short history of fever, severe throat pain, stridor, and respiratory distress, but the symptoms progress rapidly. Children become toxic and tend to sit anxiously in the classic tripod position (sitting upright, with the chin up, mouth open, bracing themselves on their hands) as air hunger develops (Fig. 23.3) . They often drool because they cannot swallow their secretions, and the voice is muffled due to pain and soft tissue swelling. Stridor may progress, and when marked (or if it disappears completely), signals almost complete obstruction of the airways. Complete, fatal airway obstruction may occur suddenly and without warning. The most serious complication of this disease process (and any infective upper airway obstruction) is hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy resulting from respiratory arrest. This tragic complication is almost always preventable with clinical suspicion, prompt diagnosis, and correct management. may be made when an air leak develops around the endotracheal tube, but repeat endoscopy may be useful to aid this decision. Again, facilities for emergency tracheostomy must be available. Some give dexamethasone before extubation to reduce post extubation stridor. 4",

Tracheal stenosis can be a complication, especially after prolonged intubation. 66 examination (especially of the throat) and cannulation or venipuncture should be deferred, because emotional upset and crying may precipitate complete airway obstruction. When epiglottitis is suspected clinically, the child (and parents) should be approached in a calm and reassuring manner. Oxygen should be given, even if the mask is held at a distance from the child's face. The child should be taken to the operating room, anesthetic room, or pediatric intensive care unit, and held by a parent. The child should also be accompanied by a senior medical team that is skilled in airway management and carrying a laryngoscope, an endotracheal tube, needle cricothyroidotomy kit, and a percutaneous tracheostomy tray.

Laryngoscopy should then be performed and the diagnosis confirmed, based on the appearance of the epiglottic region, as described earlier in the chapter (erythema and edema of the supraglottis). Endotracheal intubation is then achieved using an orotracheal tube, which is later changed to a nasotracheal tube, because this is less likely to be displaced leading to a potentially disastrous extubation. Intubation may be done using the Seldinger technique over a bronchoscope. Although tracheostomy is rarely necessary, a surgical team should be prepared to perform this immediately if intubation is unsuccessful. Once the airway is secured, the emergency is over, and the remaining studies can be performed. Intravenous cannulation and blood sampling can be done. The white cell count is increased, and blood culture findings are often positive (70% in one series). 52 Airway secretions and swabs from the epiglottic region should be sent for bacterial culture and viral detection. Urinary antigen testing may be useful for those already receiving antibiotics. 59 Some authors have advocated the use of a lateral neck radiograph if the child is stable before intubation, claiming it to be the \"single most useful study.\" 2, 6 We strongly disagree, and this is not our recommendation, because it can precipitate respiratory arrest as a result of complete obstruction. We take the same view as Goodman and McHugh, who state that \"plain radiographs have no role to play in the assessment of the critically ill child with acute stridor.\" 62 Once the airway is secured, intravenous antibiotics are started which must cover HiB and Streptococcus; the response is usually rapid. 2 A third-generation cephalosporin (e.g., ceftriaxone or cefotaxime) is usually given and may be changed once antibiotic sensitivities are available. Antibiotics have traditionally been given for 7 to 10 days; however, a randomized controlled trial showed that a two-dose course of intravenous ceftriaxone was as efficacious as 5 days of intravenous chloramphenicol. 59 Contacts of patients with HiB should be given appropriate prophylaxis, usually rifampicin (patients must be warned about orange secretions [e.g., tears, urine], and also that oral contraceptives can be inactivated, and the fact that this warning has been given should be recorded). There is some empiric evidence that corticosteroids may improve the course of epiglottitis, but racemic epinephrine has not been shown to be of benefit. The duration of intubation for epiglottitis due to HiB averages 1 to 3 days, 6,52 but it is longer when caused by Streptococcus 3 ; as always, there is great individual variation. A decision to extubate and nearly 15,000 deaths per year due to diphtheria. 72 Although it became uncommon due to widespread immunization programs started in the 1940s, it remains a serious disease in parts of the world. Large outbreaks occurred in the 1990s throughout Russia and the independent countries of the former Soviet Union (nearly 50,000 cases were reported). In 2005, 36 countries reported almost 13,000 cases to the World Health Organization, and 80% were from India. 73 However, in the United States, there were only five cases reported between 2000 and 2015. 72 The last childhood deaths reported in the United Kingdom were 1 in 1994 and 1 in 2008. 74 In 2013, in a refugee camp in Afghanistan, there were 50 cases and 3 deaths. Most life-threatening cases occurred in unvaccinated or inadequately vaccinated persons, and it is important for children traveling to these countries, particularly for extended periods, to be vaccinated. A list of endemic countries is available on the Centers for Disease Control website, last updated July 2015. 75 It is also important to take into account a history of recent travel in potential cases. Global coverage of a three-dose course of diphtheriatetanus-pertussis vaccination is estimated to be 86% in 2014. 76 Adults are particularly at risk because protective levels of diphtheria antibodies decrease progressively with time from immunization, so reimmunization is recommended before travel. The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey of US residents (1988) (1989) (1990) (1991) (1992) (1993) (1994) indicated that fully protective levels (\u22650.1 IU/mL) were found in 91% of children 6 to 11 years of age, but only in 30% of adults 60 to 69 years of age. 77",

Corticosteroids may be given before extubation. Tracheostomy is required less often than in the past. There has been a case reported that was successfully managed with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) required for bilateral pneumothoraxes and pneumomediastinum. 71 Initially, intravenous broad-spectrum antibiotics are given, and these can be refined once cultures and antibiotic sensitivities are known, usually for 10 to 14 days.

Additionally, in England it has been suggested that the 39% rise in retropharyngeal and parapharyngeal abscess admission rate (children and adults) between 1996 and 2011 may be correlated with the National Health Service drive to reduce tonsillectomies in that same period, which resulted in a 41% fall in overall tonsillectomy rate. 88",

It tends to affect older children and adolescents, and in one large, contains loose connective tissue and lymph nodes that drain the nasopharynx, paranasal sinuses, middle ear, teeth, and adjacent bones. The space extends from the base of the skull down to vertebra C7 or T1. Acute bacterial infection in this region may start as retropharyngeal cellulitis with localized edema of the tissues, which can progress to purulent inflammation of the tissues and retropharyngeal adenitis. However, when this process is caused by lymphatic spread, it starts as adenitis. If liquefaction of one of the nodes occurs, an abscess can form and is usually contained within the inflammatory rind of the infected node.",

            "text": "Presentation is often nonspecific, and there may be overlap with the presentation of croup, epiglottitis, tracheitis, and peritonsillar abscess (see Table 23 .1). 6 Children with acute epiglottitis tend to appear more toxic and progress to respiratory distress more rapidly. 92 Excluding causes secondary to foreign bodies or trauma, patients usually have a history of a viral upper respiratory infection that lasts several days and then worsens. Children then have high fever, sore throat, dysphagia, poor feeding, neck pain, and stiffness. Limitation of neck extension and torticollis are more common than limited neck flexion. 84 Although the occurrence of neck signs with fever may suggest meningitis, affected children tend not to be as toxic as those with meningitis. Further deterioration may lead to extrathoracic airway compromise, with drooling, stridor, and respiratory distress. The classical picture of stridor and airway obstruction seems to be less common now, and in a series of cases reported by pediatricians from 1993 to 1998, only 3% of 64 children in Salt Lake City had stridor or wheezing. 84 However in a series of cases from 2002 to 2007 from the same center, but published by the otolaryngologists, 14/130 (11%) presented with airway obstruction, and 50% required intubation, with an average age of 1.4 years. 93 Older series have reported a higher incidence of stridor. Reported rates include 71% in patients younger than 1 year of age, 43% in patients older than 1 year of age, and no stridor in those older than 3 years of age in a series of 31 children in Sydney, Australia 94 ; a rate of 56% in 17 patients in Denver 95 ; and a rate of 23% in 65 children in Los Angeles. 96 It is possible that the spectrum of disease is changing, but it is more likely that the diagnosis is being made earlier, before the airways are compromised. 84 Sometimes a retropharyngeal mass is visible in the mouth, seen as an asymmetrical bulge of the posterior pharyngeal wall (Fig. 23.5) , or a neck mass (marked lymphadenopathy or parapharyngeal abscess) is visible and palpable. Complications include rupture of the abscess with aspiration, asphyxiation or pneumonia, extension to a mediastinal abscess with or without mediastinitis, and Lemierre syndrome with vascular complications (e.g., anaerobic septic thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein with multiple septic pulmonary emboli, and potential erosion through the carotid artery sheath). 89, 92 Once the child is stable and safe, a lateral neck radiograph with the neck in full extension may confirm the diagnosis. Widened prevertebral soft-tissue shadow and air-fluid levels in the retropharyngeal space are all indicators. 6 The radiograph must be taken in the correct position (true lateral orientation, with the neck in extension, and if possible, during full inspiration) to ensure that the retropharyngeal space is ",

Acute upper airway obstruction may occur, but the cardinal signs of acute obstruction (stridor and respiratory distress with recession and tachypnea) can be absent until late in the process. 111 Obstruction arises from a combination of inflammation and hypertrophy of the palatal and nasopharyngeal tonsils, edema of the pharynx and epiglottis, and pseudomembrane formation in the large airways. 112 Acute onset of obstructive sleep apnea has also been described in a child who required continuous positive airway pressure when asleep, until recovery after 3 days. 113 Peritonsillar abscess formation is a rare complication that can further compromise the airway, and it is now believed that this is not significantly associated with the use of corticosteroids, which contradicts earlier reports. 114 10-year series, the mean age was 12 years of age, with twothirds of those affected older than 10 years of age. 98 In this series, 62% of cases occurred on the left side versus 38% on the right (with no obvious explanation). 98 There is no seasonal predilection.

A tracheostomy is sometimes necessary, as the severity of the inflammation in the oropharynx can make intubation difficult. If corticosteroids do not help, the role of acute tonsillectomy has been advocated, 115 but it is controversial due to the high risk of perioperative bleeding. 112 ",

During inspiration, negative intratracheal pressure (relative to atmospheric pressure) leads to dynamic collapse of the extrathoracic airway, thus worsening the effects of an extrathoracic obstructive lesion. In contrast, intrathoracic obstruction improves during inspiration because the elastic recoil of the lung parenchyma opens the intrathoracic airways. During expiration, intratracheal pressure is positive relative to atmospheric pressure, opening the extrathoracic trachea and lessening the obstructive effect of lesions. In contrast, intrathoracic obstruction worsens because of lower pressure in the airways relative to the surrounding parenchyma, collapsing the airways.(From Loughlin GM, Taussig LM.
