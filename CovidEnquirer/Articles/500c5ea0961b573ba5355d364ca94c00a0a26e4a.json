Reduction of the 47 expression or the activity of chaperone caveolin complex in mosquito infected cells, diminished 48 the secretion of NS1 without affecting virion release. Direct interaction between NS1 and the 49 chaperone caveolin complex proteins was demonstrated by several assays. Moreover, 50 increased expression of the caveolin-1 and co-chaperone FKBP52 during dengue infection was 51 found, presumably in response to the higher requirements of these proteins during dengue virus 52 infection. Results obtained with ZIKV infected mosquito cells suggest that also ZIKV NS1 is 53 released following an unconventional secretory route in association with the chaperone caveolin 54 complex. The functions of secreted NS1 within mosquito are unclear. However, giving the 55 importance of the soluble NS1 in the vertebrate host, manipulation of the NS1 secretory route 56 may prove a valuable strategy for dengue mosquito control and patient treatment. 57 58 59 4 64 infection and its public health burden are hard to estimate, but at least 100 countries are currently 65 endemic for dengue [2]. DENV has a single stranded RNA genome of positive polarity. The 66 genome of DENV is translated into a single polyprotein and encodes for three structural (C, E, 67 prM/M) and seven non-structural (NS) (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5) proteins. 68 The polyprotein is then cleaved by host and viral proteases to release individual viral proteins 69 [3]. The viral genome replication process within the host cell is mainly driven by the NS proteins. 70 The NS1 protein act as an scaffolding protein that anchors the replication complex to the ER 71 membrane and interacts physically with NS4B [4]. The NS1 protein is a 352-amino-acid 72 polypeptide with a molecular weight of 46-55 kDa, depending on its glycosylation status. The 73 NS1 protein exists in multiple oligomeric forms and is found in different cellular locations: a cell 74 membrane-bound form in association with virus-induced intracellular vesicular compartments, 75 on the cell surface and as a soluble secreted hexameric lipoparticle [4]. The NS1 monomeric 76 form rapidly dimerizes in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), then three dimeric forms of NS1 77 arrange to form an hexamer [5]. The hexameric form of NS1 shows an open barrel form filled 78 with lipids and cholesterol which resemble the lipid composition of the HDL particle [6]. 79 Recent studies have shown that the DENV NS1 protein was not only secreted from vertebrate 80 cells, but that was also efficiently secreted from mosquito cells lines [7,8]. The secretion of NS1 81 in vertebrate cells follows the classical Golgi-pathway [9]. However, NS1 secretion in infected 82 mosquito cells is associated to a caveolin-1 (CAV-1) dependent pathway and was found to be 83 Brefeldin A (BFA)-insensitive, suggesting a traffic route that bypasses the Golgi-complex [10]. 84 Caveolae are made up of interlocking heteropolymers of a family of small proteins (caveolins: 1-85 3) and a second family of accessory structural proteins (flotillins and three family of cavins). The 86 caveolar architecture is connected with unstructured cavin filaments by coiled-coil domains into .

This complex is believed to provide scaffolding for compartmented 88 cellular processes and participates in multiple cellular functions, including endocytosis, 89 transcytosis, membrane homeostasis, inflammation, and signal transduction [11]. Caveolin 1 90 (Cav-1), a 21-24-kDa scaffolding protein, is not only a key structural component of the caveolae 91 organelle but also plays an important in the transport of free-cholesterol inside the cell [12,13]. 92 The chaperone caveolin complex (CCC) is a cytosolic complex reported to transport cholesterol 93 synthetized de novo from the ER to cell membranes or other compartments within the cell. CCC 94 has been described as a complex of CAV-1, Cyclophilin A (CyA), FK506-binding protein 4 or 95 heat shock protein 56 (FKBP52), and Cyclophilin 40 or D (Cy40) [12,14]. Cyclophilin A (CyA), 96 an 18 kDa peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase, is a ubiquitous and multifunctional protein. In 97 addition to its role as a host-cell receptor for cyclosporine A, CyA has diverse functions in 98 inflammatory conditions and diseases [15,16]. The 52-kDa FK506-binding protein (FKBP52) an 99 immunophilin belonging to the FKBP family, is a known co-chaperone of the heat shock protein 100 90 (HSP90) and thus may play a role in the intracellular trafficking of hetero-oligomeric forms of 101 the steroid hormone receptors [17,18]. Cyclophilin 40 (Cy40), a member of a family of highly 102 homologous peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerases (PPIases), is known to play a role in 103 mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), being an integral constituent of the MPT pore [19].",

No significant cytotoxicity was 120 observed under 30 \uf06dM of GCA in any of the three cell types (Fig 1A) . Fli-06 is a novel drug which 121 inhibits the diffusion of ER synthetized proteins to the ER-exit sites [21,22]. Fli-06 cytotoxicity 122 was determined in C6/36 and Aag2 cells also using also tetrazolium salt reduction. No significant 123 cytotoxicity was observed under 100 \uf06dM of Fli-06 in the mosquito cells lines (Fig 1B) . Thus, 124 concentration of 27 \uf06dM and 100 \uf06dM were used for GCA and Fli-06, respectively, since these 125 concentrations proved non-toxic, yet effective in causing Golgi disruption (Fig 1C) .

Experiments with Fli-133 06 were not carried out in BHK-21 due to high drug toxicity. The results with GCA and Fli-06 134 indicate NS1 is not secreted by a classical secretory pathway and that newly synthetized DENV 135 NS1 do not reach the ER-exit sites and leaves the ER compartment very early after synthesis. 136 Since the release of mature virions, which are multimolecular complexes, may not be equivalent 137 to the release of a single protein, an additional control for protein trafficking through the classical 138 secretory pathway was included. To this aim, a vector, pAc5-mCherry-GLuc-neo, constitutively 139 expressing Gaussia Luciferase in C6/36 cell was constructed (S1 Fig). To evaluate the effect of 140 GCA treatment on GLuc secretion, cells were treated with GCA for 24 h and the activity of GLuc 141 present in the cell supernatants analyzed using a luminescence assay. A decrease in luciferase 142 activity, in relation to the control (DMSO), was detected upon treatment of C6/36 with GCA, and 143 in BHK-21 cells transfected with ptk-GLuc vector, run in parallel as control (Fig.1J). These results 144 indicated that the luciferase reporter is secreted in both mosquito and vertebrate cells following 145 a classical secretory route and reinforce the results indicating that in mosquito cells DENV NS1 146 is secreted by an unconventional secretory route that bypasses the Golgi (Fig 1K). 147 148 NS1 secretion is dependent on the CCC 149 The CCC is formed by the association of CAV-1 with the chaperones CyA, FKBP52, Cy40 150 [12,13]. The CCC is responsible for cholesterol transport inside the cell. Previous data by us [10] 151 indicated that NS1 secretion was dependent on CAV-1. Thus, to fully evaluate the participation 152 of the CCC in DENV NS1 secretion from mosquito cells, CyA was pharmacologically inhibited 153 by treatment with Cyclosporin A (CsA) and the expression of the chaperones FKBP52 and Cy40 .

Finally, the expression of Cy40 was significantly knock down at 48h post 178 siRNA transfection (Fig 4A) . A reduction in about 60% of lipid droplets counting per cell was 179 observed in transfected cells ( Fig 4B) . Yet, neither NS1 secretion nor virus release was affected 180 by Cy40 silencing (Fig 4C and 4D ). This result suggests that while Cy40 participates in 181 cholesterol traffic it may be dispensable for NS1 secretion.

The secretion of YFV NS1 267 was found to be sensitive to BFA treatment in both mosquito and vertebrate cells (Fig. 9A) . In 268 contrast, the secretion of ZIKV NS1 was found to be insensitive to BFA and GCA treatment in 269 infected mosquito, but not in infected vertebrate cells (Fig 9B) . In addition, the secretion of ZIKV 270 NS1 was reduced in mosquito, but not in vertebrate cells, treated with the CyA inhibitor CsA (Fig   271 9C ). Co-localizations experiments carried out in C6/36, Aag2 and Vero-E6 cells infected with 272 ZIKV and YFV, showed a stronger, and a significantly different, co-localization between ZIKV 273 NS1 and CAV-1 than between YFV NS1 and CAV-1, in both mosquito cell lines. No co-274 localization of ZIKV or YFV NS1 with CAV-1 was observed in vertebrate cell line ( Fig 9D and 275 9E). Of note, the co-localization data support the predictions derived from the presence of a 276 conserved caveolin binding (CBD) domain in ZIKV (and DENV) but not in YFV NS1 (Fig 9F) .

Molecular docking predicts a favorable 290 interaction between the NS1 hydrophobic domain including the grease fingers, where the CBD 291 is located, with a pocket in the CAV-1 scaffolding domain (CSD) with distances less 8\u01fa ( Fig 9A   292 and 9B). The molecular docking results obtained with CAV-1 and NS1 were used as a control to 293 carry on additional docking experiments between the DENV NS1 or CAV-1 and the CCC 294 chaperones FKBP52, Cy40 and CyA. Calculations of the energy binding of several docking 295 clusters showed that the DENV NS1 has the lowest and more favorable energy for CAV-1, 296 compared to the energy binding obtained for FKBP52, Cy40 or CyA. In addition, lower energies 297 were obtained for the binding of CAV-1 with the other chaperones of the CCC, than for the 298 binding of NS1 with those same chaperones ( Fig 9C) . Based in the free energies data, we predict 299 a model of interaction of NS1 with the CCC proteins in which FKBP52, Cy40 and CyA are directly 300 bound to CAV-1, and NS1 is bound to the CCC through the CAV-1 scaffolding domain ( Fig 9D) .

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/370932 doi: bioRxiv preprint 15 303 DISCUSSION 304 Our previous work demonstrated that DENV NS1 secretion in mosquito cell lines follows a BFA-305 insensitivity secretion pathway that depends on CAV-1; moreover, NS1 was found to interact 306 directly with CAV-1 [10]. Therefore, in the present work, we explored the association of NS1 with 307 proteins involved, together with CAV-1, in the intracellular transport of cholesterol and the 308 dependence of NS1 secretion on such association. The results revealed that NS1 is associated 309 to the chaperone caveolin complex (CAV-1, Cy40, FKBP52 and CyA) and that the integrity of 310 this complex is necessary for the secretion of NS1 in mosquito infected cells. Additional data 311 suggest that in virus infected mosquito cells, ZIKV NS1, but not yellow fever virus NS1, also 312 associates with CAV-1 and usurps the cholesterol traffic pathways for secretion. Thus, the lipid 313 content or molecular structure of the DENV NS1 seems to have taken advantage of mosquito 314 cell cholesterol transport to guarantee the efficient NS1 secretion in the mosquito vector.

Yet, as an 326 additional tool to study classical secretion in mosquito cell lines, an efficient Gaussia luciferase 327 reporter system that enables the detection of Luciferase in cell supernatants 6 hours after 328 transfection was developed. The secretion of luciferase was significantly affected after treatment 329 with GCA and BFA (data not shown); these data, together with the observed inhibition of viral 330 particle release, indicates the existence of a robust classical secretion pathway in mosquito cells.

It . https://doi.org/10.1101/370932 doi: bioRxiv preprint 18 371 (CSD) with a distance of 5\u01fa approximately. Further analysis also showed, high energy binding 372 through hydrophobic dynamics, between the NS1 \uf062-roll domain and FKBP52, CyA and Cy40 373 with distances under 6\u01fa. However, the model predicts all these proteins interacting at the same 374 domain in NS1 (data not shown), which seems unlikely, due to steric effects. Thus, we favor an 375 alternative molecular docking model, based on interaction energies, in which NS1 is bound 376 directly to CAV-1, and in turn FKBP52, CyA and Cy40 are bound to CAV-1 (Fig. 10D ). This 377 model still allowed interaction of NS1 with the CCC through membranes. However, if the NS1-378 CCC complex will traffic to the plasma membrane as a free-cytosolic complex or membrane 379 associated is totally unknown.

DENV infection results 185 in an increased in LD in mosquito cells (S2 Fig), yet NS1 did not show significant PCC values 186 with LD (S4 Fig). Finally, the interference with the chaperones that conform the CCC in non-187 infected cell resulted in a significant reduction in the count of lipid droplets per cell in all cases. 188 This decrease is similar to the observed in cells treated with M\u03b2CD or subjected to serum 189 starvation (S3 Fig). These data generated in mosquito cells, endorse the role proposed for the 190 CCC in lipid traffic and homeostasis in vertebrate cell [12,13]. 191 192 Dengue virus infection increases the expression of CCC proteins 193 Given the relatively high amounts of NS1 synthetized and the expected high amounts of lipids 194 required to form the hexamer, and given the importance of CCC in NS1 traffic and lipid 195 homeostasis, the effect of dengue virus infection in the CCC protein levels was evaluated. 196 Western blot analysis of DENV infected C6/36 cells showed a 3.5 and 2.0-fold increase in CAV-1 197 and FKBP52 expression, respectively, at 24 hpi; meanwhile, no changes in the expression of 198 Cy40 and CyA were observed (Fig 5A). The infection of BHK-21 cell run in parallel showed no confirm direct interaction between NS1 and proteins of CCC, we performed a proximity 244 ligation assay (PLA) analysis in DENV infected C6/36 and Aag2 infected cells. The PLA allows 245 the detection of protein-protein interactions, while preserving the cell architecture and in addition 246 the generated signal can be quantified. In agreement with previous results [10], a positive signal 247 (green dots) was detected in both DENV-infected mosquito cells stained for NS1 and CAV-1, 248 confirming that NS1 and CAV-1 directly interact in infected mosquito cells (Fig 8B). In addition, 249 positive signals were detected between NS1 and each of the chaperone proteins of CCC; Cy40, 250 FKBP52, and CyA (Fig 8B), indicating that NS1 interacts with the whole CCC in both cell lines. 251 In all cases, the PLA signals were located in the cytoplasm, in agreement with the co-localization 252 results shown in Figure 7. Quantification of the PLA signal per cell suggests that NS1 interacts 253 equivalently with all the components of the CCC, although significantly less signal was observed 254 for FKBP52 and NS1 in C6/36 cells. No fluorescent spots were detected in mock-infected cells 255 incubated with both primary antibodies or in infected cells incubated with anti-NS1 in the absence 256 of anti-CAV-1, signifying the specificity of the signal (Figure 8B and 8C). 257 258 ZIKV NS1 follows an CAV-1-dependent unconventional secretion in mosquito cells 259 NS1 is the only viral non-structural protein secreted from DENV-infected cells.

On the other hand, YFV NS1 seems to be secreted by a 282 classical secretory pathway in both cells types. 283 284 Modeling of molecular interactions between DENV NS1 and the chaperone caveolin 285 complex 286 To better understand the molecular interactions between the dimeric DENV NS1 protein and the 287 CCC, we constructed a human CAV-1 3D model using RaptorX server 288 (http://raptorx.uchicago.edu) [25].

GCA inhibits the COPI-II recruitment and ER exit 320 site (ERES) transport to Golgi [20]. GCA-insensitivity indicates that the NS1 and CAV-1 321 interaction initiates in the ER compartment. In agreement, treatment of mosquito cells with Fli-322 06 showed no effect on NS1 secretion, indicating that the interaction between NS1 and CCC is 323 taken place very early after NS1 synthesis, before the viral protein is transported to the ERES 324[21,22].",

            "text": "Although, mosquito cells present both classical and unconventional secretory pathways, DENV 332 NS1 is secreted bypassing the Golgi apparatus. A study in mosquito cells demonstrated that 333 insect cells have an active ER-retention protein system; the KDEL c-terminal peptide functions 334 as a ER-retention signal for some proteins [27]. NS1 lacks a KDEL signal, yet it presents a 335 conserved and well exposed caveolin biding domain (CBD) [10]. Thus, NS1 unconventional 336 secretion in mosquito cells is likely associated to this CAV-1 motif. However, the CBD may not 337 be the unique factor to determine unconventional secretion. A role for amino acids at position 10 338 and 11 in flavivirus NS1 secretion in mosquito cells have been proposed [28]. 339 The CCC was first described in vertebrate cells as a non-vesicular cholesterol transport within 340 the cell [14]. Yet, to our knowledge there are no previous reports of the presence of the CCC in 341 any insect or mosquito cell line. Thus, given that there are differences in the lipid homeostasis 342 in mosquito cells, including the absence de novo cholesterol synthesis pathways, it became 343 necessary to demonstrate the existence of the CCC in mosquito cells and to show a role for the 344 complex in lipid homeostasis, as have been shown for vertebrate cells [12,13]. Co-localization 345 and immunoprecipitation experiments indicated that in uninfected mosquito cells, CAV-1 is 346 indeed associated with all 3 chaperones proposed to conform the complex; FKPB52, Cy40 and 347 CyA; moreover, knocking down the expression of CAV-1 (data not shown) or any of the chaperones resulted in a significant decrease in the lipid droplet count per cell, 349 indicating also a role for the CCC in lipid homeostasis in mosquito cells. In agreement with our 350 results, ER chaperones have been reported necessary for the secretion of recombinant proteins 351 expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus system [29,30]. 352 The NS1 and CCC interactions in infected mosquito cells was validated by colocalization, co-353 inmunoprecipitation and proximity ligation assays. Firstly, the co-localization analysis and co-354 inmunoprecipitation assays carried out in mock infected cells assays demonstrated direct 355 interaction of FKBP52, Cy40 and CyA with CAV-1, again supporting the existence of the CCC 356 in mosquito cells. In agreement with our previous report, strong CAV-1 and NS1 interaction were 357 detected by both techniques and used as reference for the new analysis with the CCC. The 358 capture with anti-NS1 antibodies indicated that FKBP52, Cy40 and CyA interact with NS1 in 359 infected cells. These results were confirmed by proximity ligation assays, a powerful approach 360 which allows to determine and quantify protein-protein interactions in situ [31]. PLA signals 361 between NS1 and each of the CCC proteins in mosquito infected cells demonstrated be similar 362 to the observed between CAV-1 and FKBP52, Cy40 and CyA [10]. CAV-1 dependent secretion 363 have been reported for non-viral proteins such as Kallikrein 6 in Colon Cancer Cells and Cyr61 364 in lung cells [32,33] as well as non-structural viral proteins such as rotavirus NSP4 [34,35]. 365 The structure of the CCC is unknown; and crystal models exist all 3 chaperones but not for 366 caveolin-1. We performed docking molecular analysis with the dimeric NS1 and complete CAV-1 367 (3D modeled in this work), in addition with the CCC proteins. An approximated in silico model 368 for NS1 and CAV-1 interaction showed very high favorable energy biding and suggest interaction 369 through the plasma membrane [10]. The molecular docking also allows measuring the energy 370 binding, and distances between both crystals. The CBD in NS1 interacts with scaffolding domain",

            "text": "Dependence of NS1 secretion on the integrity of the CCC was evaluated using gene knockdown 381 for FKBP52 and Cy40 or drug inhibition for CyA. Again, the observed reduction in the number of 382 lipid droplets per cell after each treatment, similar to the decrease observed after serum 383 starvation and Methyl-\u03b2-Cyclodextrin (M\uf062CD) treatment (S3 Fig), support a role for the CCC in 384 the lipid homeostasis in mosquito cells. FKBP52 knockdown decreases NS1 secretion while viral 385 release was not affected. HSP90 has been associated to viral replication of chikungunya virus, 386 Arteriviridae viruses, Hepatitis C virus and minor effect on DENV replication [36-39], but we 387 could demonstrate the association of this co-chaperone of HSP90 to viral protein trafficking. CyA 388 inhibition by cell treatment with CsA also resulted in diminished NS1 secretion in mosquito cells, 389 without affecting viral release. However, CyA has been associated to viral packing and viral 390 release in other viruses as coronaviruses, Hepatitis C virus, HIV, and others [40-42]. Finally, 391 Cy40 knockdown had not effect in either NS1 secretion or viral release. This result suggests a 392 dispensable function of Cy40 in the secretion of NS1 in mosquito cell; yet, this is an unexpected 393 result for which we have no obvious explanation, given the observed association between NS1 Cy40, which appears to be indeed part of the CCC. Cy40 may also have an unknown 395 regulatory activity in the CCC complex, becoming a dispensable component for the NS1 traffic 396 in the mosquito infected cells. However, Cy40 mitochondrial function is essential for viral fitness 397 in human coronaviruses and HCV [43,44]. Finally and regardless, the previous data indicating 398 no interaction of the CCC proteins with NS1 in infected vertebrate cells, we wanted to explore 399 the effect of FKBP52 and Cy40 knockdown and CyA inhibition in BHK-21 DENV infected cells. 400 As expected, alteration in the levels or function of these proteins resulted in a significant 401 decrease in the number of lipid droplets but had no effect on NS1 secretion, indicating that the 402 CCC plays a role in lipid homeostasis in vertebrate cells but have no role in the secretion of NS1 403 and supporting a classical secretion pathway for NS1 in vertebrate cells. 404 Profound changes in lipid homeostasis have been observed in DENV infected mosquito cells 405 [45] which may in part respond, to the demand of high amounts of cholesterol required for the 406 hexameric NS1 secretion [6]. Interestingly, the levels of CAV-1 and FKBP52 were found to 407 increase during DENV infection in mosquito, but not in vertebrate, cells. Mosquitos are 408 cholesterol; thus, CAV-1 and FKBP52 increased expression may result as a response to 409 increments in cholesterol demand upon infection [46,47]. As pointed out by the increased in 410 CAV-1 expression observed after MBCD treatment of mock infected cells. 411 NS1 lipid cargo indicates high requirements of cholesterol and triglycerides in infected cells [6]. 412 In hepatic cells, DENV infection induces an increase in the activity of cholesterol biosynthesis 413 enzymes [48]. The results showing lipid droplet decay during CCC inhibition in mosquito cells, 414 suggest a possible association between NS1 and LD during its traffic. To explore this possibility, 415 co-localization parameters between LD and NS1 in mosquito infected cells were measured (S2 416 Fig). However, very low value for true co-localization between NS1 and LD particle were in both infected mosquito cell lines. Lipids droplets are reservoir of triglycerides and 418 cholesterol for viral production. In addition, the C capsid protein has been shown to colocalize 419 with LD in infected cells and this interaction is necessary for genome encapsidation [49]. In 420 general flaviviruses increase production of free fatty acids, and cholesterol to favor assembly of 421 viral particles [50] and NS1 secretion is affected in cells where lipid metabolism is altered, yet 422 LD do not appear to participate in the traffic of this viral protein. 423 Previous results indicated that the interaction CAV-1 and NS1 is important for the secretion of 424 NS1 in infected mosquito cells [10]. NS1 presents a CBD (\u03a6XX\u03a6XxXX\u03a6, where \u03a6 is an aromatic 425 residue and X any amino acid) that is well conserved among the 4 DENV serotypes and is also 426 conserved in the ZIKV, but not in the YFV NS1, where a T to F substitution is found in the first 427 aromatic residue. Since changes in the aromatic residues of the CBD are important in the 428 interaction with CAV-1 [51], the possible interactions of the NS1 of ZIKV and YFV with CAV-1 429 and the role of such interactions in influencing the secretory routes of NS1 from infected 430 mosquito cells, were evaluated. The colocalization results obtained in ZIKV and YFV infected 431 cells and well as the differential effect of BFA and GCA treatment in the secretion of NS1 of both 432 viruses, taken together support the notion that indeed, in mosquito cells, but not in vertebrate 433 cells, the presence of an intact CBD is necessary for the interaction between NS1 and CAV-1, 434 and that such interaction is necessary to drive to NS1 to be secreted by a non-classical secretory 435 route, in association with the CCC. YFV NS1 showed a favored classical Golgi secretion 436 pathway, while ZIKV NS1 secretion is following an unconventional secretion as we have been 437 described for DENV. Thus, the CBD appears to be a molecular determinant necessary to direct 438 the interaction of NS1 to CAV-1 and facilitate the unconventional secretion using the cholesterol 439 pathway and CCC [51]. Remarkably, the CBD in NS1 sequence by itself is not the only to direct what type of secretion is going to take the NS1 in the cells since in 441 vertebrate cells, NS1 from DENV and ZIKV shows no association with the CCC, and secretion 442 is Golgi dependent. Several factors acting in concert may be necessary to keep the NS1 from 443 reaching the ER-exit sites and entering the classical secretory pathway in mosquito cells; i) 444 mosquito cells could be defective in a protein necessary to direct NS1 to ER-Golgi intermediate 445 and then follow classical secretion [27]; as is suggested by the insensitivity of NS1 secretion to 446 FLI-06 and GCA treatment, and ii) the affinity of DENV NS1 for mosquito CAV-1 may be higher 447 for the CAV-1 of vertebrate cells; as is indeed suggested by the predicted interaction energies 448 for both proteins where DENV NS1 presents stronger interaction for invertebrate CAV-1 than for 449 human CAV-1 (data not shown). Figure 11 presents a schematic model for DENV NS1 secretion 450 in infected mosquito cells. 451 In summary, these results indicate that in mosquito cells, DENV NS1 utilizes the CCC as part of 452 the cholesterol transport machinery, to reach the extracellular space bypassing the Golgi 453 complex. A similar pathway appears to be true for the ZIKV NS1. These results are in 454 congruence with the lipoprotein nature of NS1 and uncover novel functions for the CCC as a 455 protein transporter in mosquito cells. The presence of the CBD in NS1 appears to be important 456 to mediate the interaction between NS1 and CAV-1. Yet, more research in needed to fully 457 understand the viral and cellular factors that determinate the dramatic differences in traffic route 458 followed by DENV NS1 in mosquito and in vertebrate cells. NS1 proteins from others mosquito 459 borne flaviviruses that lack the CBD, as WNV, YFV, JEV are secreted apparently at very low 460 levels and following the classical pathway in mosquito cells. The functions of soluble NS1 in the 461 mosquito are unknown and need to be elucidated; but may include facilitation of the spread of 462 viral particles and modulation of innate immunity [31]. Finally, manipulation of the lipid and clone mosquito cells from Aedes albopictus (ATCC \u00ae CRL-1660\u2122) and Aag-2 cells from 470 Aedes aegypti (kindly provided by Dr. Fidel de la Cruz from CINVESTAV-IPN) were grow at 28 471 \u00baC in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM) (ATCC \u00ae 30-2003\u2122), supplemented with 5% 472 fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin. Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-473 21, ATCC\u00ae CCL-10\u2122) were grown at 37\u00b0C and cultured in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium 474 (EMEM, ATCC \u00ae ) supplemented with 5% FBS and 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin. Monkey 475 epithelial kidney cells Vero E6 (ATCC\u00ae CRL-1586\u2122) were grown at 37\u00b0C and cultured in Eagle's 476 Minimum Essential Medium (EMEM, ATCC \u00ae ) supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 Userotype 2 (DENV2), DENV serotype 4 (DENV4) and Zika virus (ZIKV), were generously 481 provided by Msc. Mauricio V\u00e1zquez, (Laboratorio de Arbovirus y Virus Hemorr\u00e1gicos. Instituto 482 de Diagn\u00f3stico y Referencia Epidemiol\u00f3gicos (InDRE, Mexico City). The dengue viruses were 483 propagated in suckling mice brain (ICR(CD-1), provided by Unit of production and 484 experimentation of laboratory animals of CINVESTAV-IPN, Mexico (UPEAL-CINVESTAV-IPN) 485 as previously described [52]. Virus titers in mice brain homogenates were determined by focus 486 forming assay in BHK-21 cells. Serial dilutions of viral stocks or supernatants of experiments 487 were diluted in serum-free medium and added to cell monolayers in 96-well plates. Viral 488 attachment and entry were allowed to proceed for 2 h at 37\u00baC; then EMEM 10% FBS was added in Vero E6 cells. YFV-17DD vaccine strain stock was donated by Dr. Juan Salas 493 Benito (Escuela Nacional de Medicina y Homeopat\u00eda, IPN) and obtained from passages of the 494 commercial vaccine in C6/36 cells. Infection experiments with YFV and ZIKV and stock viruses 495 were tittered in Vero E6 cells using focus forming assay (as described previously). 496 497 Luciferase reporter construct 498 Ac5-STABLE2-neo was a gift from Rosa Barrio and James Sutherland (Addgene plasmid # 499 32426) [53]. This plasmid was engineered to express Luciferase gene in mosquito cells. 500 Luciferase gene was obtained from plasmid ptk-GLuc Vector (NEB, Catalog # N8084) kindly 501 donated by Dr. Susana Lopez (Instituto de Biotecnologia-UNAM). Gaussia Luciferase (GLuc) 502 was PCR-amplified using the following designed primers with directed cloning sites (underlined): 503 Luc-XbaI-F (5'-GCGCTCTAGAGCCACCATGGGAGTCAAAGTTCTGTTTGCC-3') and Luc-504 HindIII-R primer (5'-GAGTAAGCTTTGGCGGGTCACCACCGGCCCCCTTGATC-3'). Unique 505 sites XbaI and HindIII in pAc5-stable2-neo allowed replacement of GFP. XbaI-HindIII cassette 506 was cloned into pAc5-STABLE2-Neo, generating the pAc5-mCherry-GLuc-Neo vector. The 507 promoter Actin5C (from Drosophila melanogaster) is efficient in insect cells lines. The T2A 508 peptide sequence derived from Thosea asigna (EGRGSLLTCGDVEENPGP) allowed 509 multicistronic processing and the neomycin resistance gene (NeoR) confers resistance to G418 510 allowing stable mosquito cell lines. Schematic representation of pAc5-mCherry-GLuc-neo vector 511 is shown in S1 Fig. transfection and Luciferase activity assay 514 pAc5-mCherry-GLuc-neo vector was transfected into confluent monolayer of C6/36 cells using 515 lipofectamine reagent Lipofectamine TM 2000 (Invitrogen). Each 24-well was transfected with 1 \uf06dg 516 of plasmid DNA and 2 \uf06dL of Lipofectamine. After 5 h of transfection, cells were added EMEM 517 with a final 10% FBS. After 24h, selective G418 was added to obtain stable C6/36 cells line. 518 Stable C6/36 cells were treated with BFA or GCA for 24h. BHK-21 cells were transfected with 519 pkt-GLuc vector and drug treatment was following the same procedure detailed above. 520 Subsequently, the supernatants were analyzed with BioLux\u00ae Gaussia Luciferase Assay Kit 521 (NEB). Percentage of luciferase activity was normalized with DMSO treatment. 522 523 Reagents and drug treatment 524 Brefeldin A (BFA) (B6542-Sigma-Aldrich), Golgicide A (GCA, 1139889-93-2 Calbiochem), Fli-06 525 (SML0975, Sigma-Aldrich) and Cyclosporine A (CsA, C1832-Sigma-Aldrich) were dissolved in 526 dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, ATCC \uf0d2 ). CsA was used to pharmacologically inhibit Cyclophilin A. 527 Methyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (M\uf062CD, C4555-Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in water and used to inhibit 528 mobilization of cholesterol and to alters lipids within cells. Unless indicated otherwise, the 529 experimental concentrations of BFA, GCA, Fli-06, CsA and M\uf062CD were 7 \uf06dM, 27 \uf06dM, 100 \uf06dM, 530 9 \uf06dM and 9 mM, respectively. Cells grown in 24-well plates were infected for 1 hour and then 531 washed three times with PBS. The drugs BFA, GCA, CsA and Fli-06 were added to the cells in 532 EMEM 5% FBS. Unless indicated otherwise, incubation time was 24 hours at 28\u00baC for mosquito 533 cells and 37\u00baC for BHK-21 cells. After this time, cell supernatants were collected to measure treatment with the indicated drugs or siRNAs, the number of viable cells in each sample 538 was determined in triplicate using the Cell Titer 96 AQueous Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation 539 Assay according to the manufacturing procedures (MTS assay, G3580-Promega). Triplicate 540 measurements were then averaged and the percentage of viable cells determined relative to 541 cells treated as controls. 542 543 Golgi integrity after drug treatment 544 Cells grown to subconfluency on coverslips in 24-well plates were treated with GCA or Fli-06 for 545 24h. After fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde, the cells were stained with rabbit monoclonal anti-546 GM130 antibody (Sigma-Aldrich). The samples were stained with the secondary antibody Alexa 547 Fluor 488-conjugated and Golgi apparatus integrity was analyzed with a Nikon Epifluorecence 548 microscope (Eclipse Ti-U). 549 550 Measurement of secreted NS1 protein 551 The Platelia TM NS1 Ag (Bio-Rad, #72830 Hercules, CA) commercial kit was used to determine 552 the levels of soluble NS1 in cell supernatants collected from silenced, drug treated or DENV 553 infected cells. The assay was carried out following the procedure indicated by the manufacturer. 554 The secreted NS1 was reported as the percentage of untreated or mock infected cells. /36 and BHK-21 cells were transfected with a range of concentrations of siRNA targeted 558 against proteins of the chaperon caveolin complex using HiPerFect Transfection Reagent 559 (QIAGEN\uf0d2). FlexiTube siRNA (4 siRNAs recommended per each gene, QIAGEN\uf0d2) for 560 FKBP52, CAV-1 and Cy40 were used to concentrations indicated in text. AllStars Negative 561 Control siRNA (QIAGEN\uf0d2) was used as non-silencing siRNA control at the same concentration 562 of the siRNAs for the proteins of interest. Gene knock down was assessed using Western 563 Blotting. Protein expression was normalized to the expression of \uf062-actin (CINVESTAV-IPN), 564 GAPDH (GTX100118, Genetex\uf0d2) or ERK-1 (sc-271291, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc). 565 Expression levels relative to negative control cells were estimated by densitometric measuring 566 with ImageJ software [54]. 567 568 Lipid droplet count 569 Lipid droplet count per cell was used as an indicator to determine the effect on lipid homeostasis 570 by drug or siRNA treatment. Cells were fixed and washed three times in PBS. Stock solution of 571 Nile Red (72485 Sigma-Aldrich) 500 \uf06dg/ml in acetone was prepared and stored protected from 572 light. The dye was then added directly to the preparation at 0.5 \uf06dg/ml in PBS, and the preparation 573 was incubated for 30 min. After three washes in PBS excess of dye was removed. From here in 574 advance all suspension medium did not contain serum, albumin or detergents to avoid draining 575 the dye out of the cells. Then, coverslips were mounted in Fluoroshield\u2122 with DAPI (Sigma).576 Lipid droplets were numbered in maximum projection images obtained by LSM 700 confocal cell monolayers, grown in 24-well plates containing glass coverslips, were infected 582 with DENV infected using a MOI=3. After the times indicated in the text, cells were fixed in 583 paraformaldehyde 4% for 10 min. Cells were permeabilizated with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 10 584 minutes at room temperature and stained for DENV-NS1 using anti-NS1 2B7, anti-GM130 585 (G7295 Sigma-Aldrich), anti-CAV-1 (GTX89541 Genetex or sc-894 Santa Cruz), anti-FKBP52 586 (ab129097 Abcam), anti-Cy40 (GTX104038 Genetex), anti-CyA (GTX104698 Genetex) and 587 Nuclei with DAPI. Anti-mouse Alexa-488 or Alexa-598, anti-goat Alexa-568 and Anti-rabbit 588 Alexa-647 or Alexa-488 conjugated (Donkey pre-adsorbed, secondary antibodies, Abcam) were 589 used at 1:800 dilution). For lipid droplets co-localization with DENV NS1, cells were incubated 590 with BODIPY 493/503 (Invitrogen) at 2 \u00b5M, in PBS-free of serum or detergents. Coverslips were 591 mounted in Fluoroshield\u2122 with DAPI (Sigma). The images were analyzed using a Carl Zeiss 592 LSM 700 confocal microscope. To maintain the consistency of the green color for the viral 593 protein, the color of BODIPY was changed to red as for Nile red staining. To evaluate the co-594 localization between proteins, Pearson correlation coefficients (PCC) were obtained from at least 595 20 confocal independent images (laser sections indicated in text) using the Icy image software 596 and the co-localization studio plugin",
