There is substan tial evidence that stress and other psychosocial factors influence immunity (Herbert & Cohen, 1993b; Jemmott & Locke, 1984; O'Leary, 1990) , as well as basic research delineating the pathways through which this influence may occur. Stress may influence immunity through direct innervation of the central nervous (CNS) and immune systems or through neuroendocrineimmune pathways. Direct neural pathways linking the CNS to the immune system have been identified (Feiten et al., 1985; Feiten &c Olschowka, 1987) . In the case of hormonal pathways, catecholamines secreted by the adrenal-medulla in response to Stressors, and stressor-triggered pituitary mediated hormones such as cortisol and prolactin have been associated with modulation of immune function (see Hall & Goldstein, 1981; Laudenslager, 1988; Rabin et al., 1989) . Moreover, receptors for ACTH, TSH, growth hormone, prolactin, and catecholamines have been found on lymphocytes (see reviews by Rabin et al., 1989) . The existence of these receptors suggests that these hormones play a role in modulating lymphocyte function.",

For example, stressed persons often engage in social coping, i.e., drawing on resources from their social networks (Cohen &c Wills, 1985) . Increased interaction with others results in greater probability of exposure to infectious agents and consequent infection. However, social interaction under stress is influ enced by both the nature of the Stressor and individual differences in social skills and affiliative tendencies. Hence, under some conditions stress may lead to social withdrawal and decreased risk of exposure. Other stress elic ited behaviors, for example, unsafe sexual practices or poor hygienic prac tices, could also increase exposure to infectious agents.",

Animals randomly assigned to 2 years of exposure to an unstable social environment demonstrated a suppression of mitogen stimulated lymphocyte proliferation in comparison to animals assigned to a stable social environment.

Two prospective epidemiologie studies find that family conflict and disorder predicted serologically verified infectious illness (Meyer & Haggerty, 1962; Graham, Douglas, &c Ryan, 1986) . Con verging evidence comes from viral challenge studies, where volunteers who fill out stressful life event or psychological distress scales are subsequently challenged with a cold or influenza virus and then monitored for the de velopment of infection and illness. Although the early viral challenge work was often methodologically flawed, it provided mixed support for a rela tion between stress and susceptibility to upper respiratory infections (Broadbent et al., 1984 and Totman et al., 1980 found effects; Greene et al., 1978 and Locke &c Heisel, 1977 did not) .

Stressor influences on susceptibility to infectious agents depend on the species of experimental animal, the type of stimulation, the timing of acute Stressor administration relative to the infectious challenge, and the infectious agent. This work underscores the importance of identifying the behavioral and biological pathways that link psychosocial factors to disease susceptibility including identifying the pa rameters of immunity that are important in the face of different pathogens. Some of the problems we find in applying these results to understanding the influence of social Stressors on human susceptibility include that the Stressors were relatively short-lived, primarily involved physical stimula tion, and were qualitatively unlike those that either human or rodent would confront outside of the laboratory. The lack of generalization of results across strains of mice and rats also suggests that rodent models are not appropriate for answering questions about psychosocial influences on hu man infectious susceptibility.",

We then carefully monitored subjects for the devel opment of infection and clinical illness. By intentionally exposing people to an upper respiratory virus, we were able to control for the possible effects of stressful events on exposure to infectious agents (as opposed to their effects on host resistance). In the remainder of this chapter, we examine the relation between each of the three stress scales and risk for clinical colds, evaluate potential pathways through which each might influence susceptibility to infectious disease, and discuss differences in relations between individual scales and illness susceptibility in terms of the components of psychological stress that each of the scales assess.",

During their first two days in the clinical unit, they were given a thorough medical examina tion, completed psychological stress, personality, and health practice ques tionnaires and had blood drawn for immune and cotinine assessments. Subsequently, volunteers were exposed via nasal drops to a low infectious dose of one of five respiratory viruses: rhinovirus types 2 (n = 86), 9 (n = 122), 14 (n = 92), respiratory syncytial virus (n = 40), and corona virus type 229E (n = 54). An additional 26 volunteers received saline. For 2 days before and 7 days after viral challenge, volunteers were quarantined in large apartments (alone or with one or two others). Starting 2 days before viral challenge and continuing through 6 days postchallenge, each volunteer was examined daily by a clinician using a standard respiratory sign-symptom protocol. Examples of items on the protocol include sneezing, watering of eyes, nasal stuffiness, sore throat, hoarseness, and cough. The protocol also included an objective count of the number of tissues used daily by a volun teer and body temperature (oral) assessed twice each day. Samples of nasal secretions were also collected daily to assess whether volunteers were infec ted by the experimental virus. Approximately 28 days after challenge a second serum sample was collected to assess changes in viral-specific anti body. All investigators were blind to volunteers' psychological status and to whether they received virus or saline.",
