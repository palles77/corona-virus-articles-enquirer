Various two-dimensional experiments are used to obtain the information on through-bond and through-space connectivities that is needed for sequential assignment ( 1, 2) . The assignment of the cross peaks in the 2D spectra is a time-consuming and tedious process and requires careful bookkeeping. This suggests that at least some parts of the assignment process could be assisted by a computer program. Attempts have been made to develop procedures for the more-or-less automatic sequential assignment of protein 'H 2D NMR spectra based on pattern recognition techniques (3) (4) (5) . Although these procedures have been shown to be successful in test cases, they have so far not been applied in a routine fashion to \"real\" problems. One reason for this is probably that the proposed automatic procedures are sensitive to the imperfections present in a typical spectrum, e.g., spurious noise and missing, obscured, or unresolved cross peaks. Indeed, it would seem that no completely automatic assignment procedure has been described so far.",

Our aim has been to design and implement an interactive graphics program that will allow the spectroscopist to inspect and assign a set of 2D spectra in much the same way as is currently done using paper plots. The program should in addition automatically perform bookkeeping operations and consistency checks. An interactive graphics program that provides these basic functions should be useful not only in its own right but also, we believe, as an essential framework for the systematic implementation and testing of different automatic assignment algorithms, as well as for the routine application of such algorithms. The computer program ANSIG (assignment of .NMR spectra by interactive graphics) has been written to realize this goal. It takes as input the processed spectra, allows contouring and display of the spectra, and has facilities for the extraction, editing, connection, and assignment of cross peaks, and for the output of assignment and NOE lists. The program has been used in the assignment of the 'H 2D NMR spectra and determination of the three-dimensional structure of the 36 residue C-terminal fragment of cellobiohydrolase I from Trichoderma reesei (CT-CBH 1) (6) . The spectra could be assigned without recourse to paper plots, and the program was used to automatically produce assignment lists, and NOE distance restraint files suitable for the calculation of threedimensional structures.",

The cross peaks are extracted from the spectra by a simple peak-picking algorithm, which yields the chemical-shift coordinates and a measure of the intensity of each cross peak. It is possible to mask out areas around the spectrum diagonal, or any rectangular area of the spectrum, in order to avoid noise bands in the spectrum when extracting cross peaks. Since the peak-picking algorithm is rather crude, it is sometimes necessary to edit the extracted cross peaks interactively on the graphics display.

An assignment consists of three separate entries, the sequence number, the residue type, and the proton name, the values of which can be modified independently. However, the program checks that the assignment entries are consistent. For example, a cross peak cannot be given the assignment \"Gly, H/3\", since the amino acid residue dictionary specifies that Gly residues may contain only the protons HN, Hczl, and Ho12. Each time the assignment for a cross peak is modified, the change is propagated to the directly or indirectly connected cross peaks, updating their assignments (Fig. 2 ). This ensures that connected cross peaks at all times have consistent assignments. If properly used, this feature makes the transfer of new assignments to affected cross peaks in all spectra completely automatic. In principle, a particular sequence-specific proton assignment need be given to a cross peak explicitly only once. This assignment can then be transferred to other cross peaks involving the proton simply by connecting them directly or indirectly to the first cross peak.",

The residue nucleus dictionary allows the user to easily modify, add, or remove residue types. The ANSIG program could be used for the assignment of oligonucleotides simply by creating a dictionary describing the common nucleotides. The text in these files is free-format, may contain comments, and obeys a well-defined syntax (12) .

The example shows the effects of setting the Fz dimension assignment of cross peak 1 in the HOHAHA spectrum to \"01\". This change first affects the symmetry-related cross peak 2, then the corresponding cross peak 3 in the NOESY spectrum, which in turn affects its symmetry-related cross peak 4, and, finally, the change is propagated to the &connected cross peak 5.

Typically, one would have available one set of HOHAHA and/or NOESY spectra recorded in HzO, and another set recorded in D20 for each of two or three sets of different experimental conditions. The program handles this by allowing the user to specify which spectra are to be considered equivalent to each other when the proton chemical-shift values are compiled. The assignment table will then contain one entry per set of equivalent spectra for each proton. This is the basis for an important feature of the ANSIG program, the automatic identification of possible nucleus assignments of NOESY cross peaks (Fig. 3) . Most of the distance information that is essential for a determination of the three-dimensional structure resides in the nonsequential, interresidue NOES. It is, of course, vital that the assignments of these NOES are correct, and this requires that all possible pairs of protons be investigated for each NOE cross peak, and that the information from the spectra recorded at different experimental conditions is then used to identify the correct assignment.",
