In this work, we report a novel membrane based two-stage ultrafiltration process to isolate IgY from egg yolk. The effects of solution pH, ionic strength, stirring speed and permeate flux on the transmission of proteins were quantified using the pulsed sample injection technique and parameter scanning ultrafiltration. Under optimised conditions, the purity of immunoglobulin obtained was greater than 93% after the two-stage ultrafiltration process and the recovery of immunoglobulin from the feedstock was close to 87%. The resulting immunoglobulin product was then analysed by Isoelectric Focusing (IEF), SDS-PAGE and Circular Dichroism (CD), to confirm its isoelectric point, molecular weight and molecular secondary structure.",

However, chicken egg is also considered as a major source of antibodies. In the past few years, many kinds of specific antibodies have been yielded successfully from eggs of immunised hens, which include anti-HIV-1 and anti-SARS coronavirus antibodies (Devi, Bai, Lal, Umashankar, & Krishnan, 2002; Fu et al., 2006; McLaren, Prosser, Grieve, & Brissenko, 1994; Ruan, Ma, He, Meng, & Zhu, 2005; Soler, Barquet, & Lucio, 1998) . Presently, IgY has been used extensively for prevention and treatment of various infections in animals and humans with mixed success (Hamada & Kodama, 1996) . Other potential uses of IgY in immunotherapy and immunodiagnostics has been reported by many authors (Ambrosius & Hadge, 1987; Larsson & Sjoquist, 1988; Otake et al., 1991; Yokohama et al., 1992) .",

Recently UF has shown to be capable in separating proteins of similar sizes exploiting the difference in electrostatic charges. Extensive published papers (Fane, Fell, & Waters, 1983; Liu, Lu, Zhao, Lu, & Cui, 2007; Musale & Kulkarni, 1997; Nakao, Osada, Kurata, Tsuru, & Kimura, 1988; Palecek, Mochizuki, & Zydney, 1992; Wan, Ghosh, & Cui, 2002) have demonstrated that UF is an efficient method for protein concentration and fractionation without causing structural damage. Many protein mixtures even with close molecular weights (Wan, Vasan, Ghosh, Hale, & Cui, 2005) have been successfully separated using UF processes under optimised conditions.",

In brief, it consisted of two parts, a stirred cell for carrying out ultrafiltration and AKTA Prime Plus liquid chromatography system (GE Healthcare, USA) for process control and monitoring. The stirred cell had a working volume of 16.0 mL and could be fitted with a membrane disk having an effective diameter of 24 mm. There was a suspended bar impeller with a diameter of 20 mm inside the module, which was magnetically driven by a RCT basic stirrer (IKA, Japan). The stirring speed was monitored using a digital photo/contact tachometer (RS 163-5348, RS Components). The gap between the impeller and the membrane was about 1.5 mm. The stirred cell was integrated with the AKTA Prime Plus in which a positive displacement pump was employed to ensure constant permeate flux through the membrane. The transmembrane pressure (TMP) was monitored by a pressure transducer. The protein solution was injected into the system in the form of pulse using a sample injector. Permeate was continuously monitored at 280 nm using a flow-through UV monitor. At the same time, the pH and conductivity of permeate were also monitored on line by a flow-through conductivity cell. All these data were continuously logged into a computer for storage and then were subsequently analysed using Prime View 5.00 software (Amersham Bioscience, GE Healthcare).",

This pH range was chosen because IgY is stable within this range (Akita & Nakai, 1993; Shimizu, Fitzsimmons, & Nakai, 2006) . The start and end carrier phases were 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 4.0 and 10.0, respectively. Fig. 3(A) shows the transmission of four proteins obtained at different pH values. The operational flux and stirring speed were fixed at 13.3 L/m 2 h and 600 rpm, respectively. It was found that IgY was not detected in the permeate within the experimental range. When pH increased from 4.0 to 6.0, the transmission of IPA increased at first, after reaching its maximum at pH 4.5 ($20%), and then decreased. With a further increase in pH, the IPA transmissions were kept around 4%. The transmissions of IPB were found to be pH dependent. As pH increased from 4.0 to 6.5, the IPB apparent sieving coefficient firstly increased, after reaching its maximum values at pH 5.0, and then decreased to pH 6.0, which was followed by the second and third peak at pH 7.5 and 9.0, respectively. The transmission of IPC had the same trend like IPB within the pH range from 4.0 to 7.5. When pH increased from 7.5 to 10.0, the IPC transmission firstly increased, after reaching its maximum vale at pH 8.0 ($82%), and then decreased. On the basis of the experimental data, the biggest selectivity [(S a_IPB + S a_IPC )/(S a_IPA + S a_IgY )] was obtained at pH 8.0 (38.7).

In this experiment, stirring speed becomes a more important factor for IgY purification due to the serious membrane fouling at low stirring speed. For example, when the stirring speed was set to zero, the separation process had to be stopped at 12 min when the transmembrane pressure (TMP) exceeded the pressure limitation (1.0 MPa). Without stirring, ultrafiltration was carried out in a deadend operation. Sever concentration polarisation would soon lead to much increased osmotic pressure and gel layer formation. As the experiments were conducted at constant flux, the TMP would have to increase eventually to the operational limit.

It can be seen that the transmission of IPA decreased when the permeate flux increased from 13.3 to 26.5 L/m 2 h while the transmissions of IPB and IPC increased. When the permeate flux increased from 39.8 to 53.1 L/m 2 h, IPA was totally rejected while the transmissions of IPB and IPC slightly decreased. According to the TMP value, the permeate flux of 26.5 L/m 2 h appears to be suitable for separation of IPA from IPB + IPC.",
