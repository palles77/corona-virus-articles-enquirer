These facts suggest an evasion of the immune system by virulent TGEV. In this study, we showed that a virulent TGEV SHXB strain could infect porcine immature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs), and down-regulate cell surface markers (SLA-II-DR, CD1a and CD80/86). Moreover, SHXB-infected immature Mo-DCs showed low expression of IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3, and also lost the ability to stimulate T cell proliferation. Finally, SHXB inhibited the activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) in these cells. Instead, UV-inactivated SHXB (UV-SHXB) had the opposite effects in immature Mo-DCs. In conclusion, the virulent SHXB could severely impair immature Mo-DCs, which might be involved in the pathogenesis of virulent TGEV in vivo.",

            "text": "Dendritic cells (DCs), the most powerful antigen-presenting cells, are critical players in intestinal immune defence. Immature DCs, with the powerful ability to capture antigens and the poor ability of presenting antigens, were widely distributed in the entire intestinal mucosa with prominent localisation in the sub-epithelial areas, forming an extensive network monitoring the invasion of pathogens (Haverson et al., 2000) . On encountering antigens, these cells capture invading pathogen, and then migrate to T cell-rich areas of lymphoid organs, gradually maturing during migration. Mature DCs stimulate T cell activation and differentiation for initiating immune responses through the expression of major histocompatibility complex, co-stimulatory molecules and the production of cytokines, such as IFN-\u03b3 and IL-12 (Sp\u00f6rri and Reis e Sousa, 2005) . Recently, reports have shown that infection of DCs with herpes simplex virus type 1 results in defective maturation, hampering the activation of na\u00efve T cells (Boliar and Chambers, 2010) . In addition, the measles virus impedes DC-derived IL-12 production, and fails to stimulate na\u00efve T cell activation (Servet-Delprat et al., 2003) . Thus, although DCs are important contributors to antiviral immunity, virus infection can impair the immune function of DCs, potentially leading to persistent infections or anergy of the immune system. TGEV mainly infects and replicates in the porcine enterocytes and may encounter sub-epithelial DCs. However, whether virulent TGEV can also impair the function of porcine DCs resulting in the severe damage of piglets is still not completely understood.",

The results showed that the expression of SWC3a + CD1a + , SWC3a + CD80/86 + , and SWC3a + SLA-II-DR + in mock immature Mo-DCs was 73.25% \u00b1 2.64, 50.83% \u00b1 1.52, and 50.6% \u00b1 8.99, respectively ( Fig. 2A and B) . Their surface markers were significantly increased when they were stimulated by LPS for 24 h, and SWC3a + CD1a + , SWC3a + CD80/86 + , and SWC3a + SLA-II-DR + were 90.25% \u00b1 4.52, 89.7% \u00b1 3.41, and 79.75% \u00b1 1.6, respectively ( Fig. 2A  and B) . Strikingly, after 24 h of virulent SHXB infection, the surface expression of CD1a, CD80/86 and SLA-II-DR drastically reduced compared with that seen in mock immature Mo-DCs ( Fig. 2A and B) , while those on immature Mo-DCs treated with UV-SHXB showed more notable up-regulation than mock and SHXB-infected immature Mo-DCs ( Fig. 2A and B) . These results suggest that virulent SHXB can inhibit the maturation of immature Mo-DCs through the downregulation of CD1a, CD80/86 and SLA-II-DR, and UV-SHXB can stimulate the maturation of immature Mo-DCs by up-regulating these surface markers. Next, to identify whether the down-regulation of these surface markers in the immature Mo-DCs infected with SHXB was caused by apoptosis, Annexin V and PI were used to detect the early and late apoptosis of Mo-DCs at 24 h p.i. The results showed that SHXB and UV-SHXB infection did not induce early or late apoptosis of the immature Mo-DCs (Fig. 2C) , which indicates that immature Mo-DCs infected with SHXB are not related to the apoptosis induced by SHXB infection. In addition, the viabilities of SHXB and UV-SHXB infected cells and LPS stimulated cells were the same as that of mock cells at 24 h p.i. (Fig. 2E) , which suggested that SHXB and UV-SHXB could affect the viability of immature Mo-DCs at 24 h p.i.",

The mechanism underlying the immunological injury of virulent SHXB-infected immature Mo-DCs was investigated by examining NF-\u03baB translocation using western blot analysis. As expected, there was a significantly higher level of NF-\u03baB p65 in the nucleus of LPSstimulated and UV-SHXB-infected immature Mo-DCs in comparison to that seen in mock-infected cells at 12 h p.i., while the lowest level of NF-\u03baB p65 was in the nucleus of virulent SHXB infected immature Mo-DCs. Moreover, a contrasting result was found for the level of NF-\u03baB in the cytoplasm and in the nucleus in all groups at 12 h p.i. (Fig. 4, up) . This suggests that the virulent SHXB inhibits the NF-\u03baB transcription factor subunits, preventing translocation into the nucleus in immature Mo-DCs, and UV-SHXB enhances this. As I\u03baB of cytoplasm degradation regulates the translocation of NF-\u03baB, we then investigated the degradation of I\u03baB-\u03b1 in the cytoplasm in this study. Results showed that the cytoplasmic level of I\u03baB-\u03b1 decreased in the immature Mo-DCs stimulated with LPS and UV-SHXB, while virulent SHXB infection could increase the protein levels of I\u03baB-\u03b1 at 12 h p.i. (Fig. 4, up) . This indicated that virulent SHXB could prevent the degradation of I\u03baB to regulate the translocation of NF-\u03baB. Similarly, the same changes were seen for the expression of NF-\u03baB p65 and I\u03baB-\u03b1 in immature Mo-DCs of all groups between 12 and 24 h of viral infection (Fig. 4, down) . Taking all of these results together, it is reasonable to conclude that virulent SHXB failed to activate NF-\u03baB in infected immature Mo-DCs because of the failure of I\u03baB degradation, while UV-SHXB prompted the activation of NF-\u03baB due to increased I\u03baB degradation.",

Recently, progress has been made in understanding the relationship between TGEV and the immune response of piglets, thereby leading to the development of new vaccines. DCs are the first antigen-presenting cells to encounter TGEV at the site of infected intestinal mucosal tissue; thus, it is important to understand the interactions between TGEV and DCs. Some pathogens hijack different parts of the DC immune pathways to escape the host immune response and enhance their survival (Moutaftsi et al., 2002; Smith et al., 2005) . The defective function of DCs, including inadequate maturation, reduced antigen presentation capacity, low efficiency of viral-specific T cell response, and imbalance of pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines, constitutes an important strategy for viruses to evade the host immune system.",

Here, we demonstrated that virulent TGEV could also infect immature Mo-DCs at low levels. It is well known that a common escape mechanism for viruses infecting DCs is to interfere with their maturation process. DC maturation is regarded a pivotal process for the cells to present viral antigens to activate T cells and initiate antiviral immune responses. LPS acts as a DC maturation stimulus in culture, increasing the expression of MHC-II, MHC-I, CD1a, CD80 and CD86, enhancing antigen presentation, and inducing IL-12 production (Langenkamp et al., 2000) . As expected, our work found that LPS also stimulated the maturation of immature Mo-DCs. However, virulent SHXB inhibited the maturation of immature Mo-DCs through a reduction of CD1a, CD80/86 and SLA-II-DR, and UV-SHXB stimulated their expression. Our findings are similar to reports stating that influenza A virus (IAV) reduced the amount of CD11c, CD172a, CD1w and CCR5 on DCs (Boliar and Chambers, 2010) , while inactivated influenza virus was able to improve the expression of these proteins on DCs (Garulli et al., 2013) . Therefore, some structural proteins may play an important role in inducing the maturation of immature Mo-DCs, and some non-structural proteins produced by the TGEV RNA transcription may play an important role in inhibiting the maturation of these immature cells. It is known that viral RNA and some structural proteins, such as spike and membrane, are natural PAMPs that can activate Mo-DCs, while non-structural proteins 3a, 3b and 7 determine the virulence of TGEV. Reports have demonstrated that a deletion of the non-structural protein 3 gene resulted in slightly reduced pathogenicity in vivo , and removal of non-structural protein 7 promoted an intensified dsRNA-activated host antiviral response (Cruz et al., 2011) . The exact reasons for the inhibition of maturation of these immature Mo-DCs are still not completely understood. Virulent SHXB and UV-SHXB infection could not induce the apoptosis of Mo-DCs at 24 h p.i., which suggests that the down-regulation of surface markers on the Mo-DCs was not caused by apoptosis. This is in agreement with previous studies showing that the severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (SARSV) also did not up-regulate the expression of CD83, CD86, MHC-I and MHC-II on adult immature DCs, and did not induce apoptosis of adult immature DCs (Law et al., 2005) .",

Secretion of IL-12 by DCs is critical for the induction of Th1 differentiation, as well as for the proliferation and enhanced cytotoxic activity of natural killer cells (Trinchieri et al., 2003) . IFN-\u03b3 is an autoinflammatory cytokine and an important signal for the secretion of IL-12 from DCs, and has immunomodulatory effects on the immune system (Libraty et al., 2001) . In addition, IL-10, a predominant Th2type cytokine, plays a role in immune suppression and has counterregulatory properties to a number of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-12 (Munoz-Jordan et al., 2003) ; also, it can induce membrane expression of MHC II molecules on macrophages (Raymond and Wilkie, 2004) . We observed that immature Mo-DCs infected with SHXB produced only very low levels of IL-12, IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 compared with LPS-and UV-SHXB-stimulated immature Mo-DCs. This suggests that virulent TGEV-infected immature Mo-DCs would have limited function in inducing Th1 and Th2 response while UV-SHXB stimulated immature Mo-DCs would have a strong ability to promote the Th1 and Th2 response. An inability to secrete IL-12 is also observed in measles virus (MV) and SARSV-infected DCs (Law et al., 2005; Schneider-Schaulies et al., 2003) , suggesting that this might be a common immunoevasion strategy. Peak levels of IL-10 secreted by the UV-SHXB-stimulated immature Mo-DCs coincided with peak levels of IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3. It is possible that the higher IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 levels induced could promote IL-10 production in these cells, thereby suppressing the over-stimulation of the immune response by these pro-inflammatory cytokines (Demangel et al., 2002; Mocellin et al., 2003) .",

Both the expression of the surface markers as well as the pro-inflammatory cytokines were inhibited by SHXB-infected immature Mo-DCs and induced by UV-SHXB stimulated immature Mo-DCs; thus, the virulent SHXBinfected immature Mo-DCs had a reduced capacity to activate T cells while the UV-SHXB stimulated immature Mo-DCs were more efficient at activating and expanding T cells at a DC/T cell ratio of 1:1 and 1:10 in our work. Interestingly, SHXB-infected immature Mo-DCs and UV-SHXB-stimulated immature Mo-DCs showed no inhibitory or stimulatory capacity at a DC/T cell ratio of 1:100. The major reason for this might be that the lower its presence in Mo-DCs, the weaker its ability to affect T cell proliferation.

            "text": "It is well recognised that the host can utilise NF-\u03baB to trigger defence mechanisms against the virus; however, many viral pathogens also benefit from hijacking NF-\u03baB-driven cellular functions. Mature DCs express high levels of the NF-\u03baB family of transcription factors (Granelli-Piperno et al., 1995) ; before stimulation, NF-\u03baB is retained in the cytoplasm in an inactive form due to its binding to the inhibitor (I\u03baB) proteins. In response to a number of different stimuli, I\u03baB is degraded and allows NF-kB to translocate to the nucleus and activate the transcription of target genes (Ghosh and Hayden, 2008) . The present study demonstrated for the first time that virulent TGEV was not able to activate NF-\u03baB in infected immature Mo-DCs due to the higher level of I\u03baB-\u03b1 in the cytoplasm, and the lower expression of NF-\u03baB p65 in the nucleus of SHXBinfected immature Mo-DCs. However, UV-SHXB was able to stimulate the activation of NF-\u03baB in immature Mo-DCs by decreasing the level of I\u03baB-\u03b1 in the cytoplasm and increasing the amount of NF-\u03baB p65 in the nucleus of immature Mo-DCs. We speculate that virulent SHXB might exploit the NF-\u03baB of immature Mo-DCs to optimise their replication or control the proliferation, survival and immune response of immature Mo-DCs. Also, UV-SHXB, not infectious viral particles, stimulated the activation of NF-\u03baB, which could participate in the induction of the immature Mo-DCs maturation and immune response. Similarly, Fang et al. reported that the SARS-CoV M protein physically interacted with I\u03ba\u03ba-\u03b2, suppressing I\u03baB-\u03b1 protein degradation and NF-\u03baB activation (Fang et al., 2007) . However, the detailed molecular mechanisms and viral components of virulent TGEV underlying the suppression of NF-\u03baB activation remain to be elucidated.",

Moreover, SHXB strain infection could inhibit the activation of NF-\u03baB in immature Mo-DCs.
