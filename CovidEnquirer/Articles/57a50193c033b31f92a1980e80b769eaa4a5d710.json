            "text": "Bats are natural reservoir hosts for many viruses which are recognised as serious potential threats to human and/or animal health (Calisher et al., 2006) . The bat-borne viruses emerging in the African, Asian and Australian continents have come to the fore more recently with regards to their threat to human health and pandemic potential. Since 2003 there have been a number of large-scale human outbreaks of bat-borne diseases e.g. Zaire ebolavirus (EBOV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Western Africa and Asia respectively, whilst a significant number of human cases of Nipah virus (NiV) are reported in Bangladesh every year (IEDCR, 2014) . Pteropid bats are known to be the natural host of Hendra virus (HeV) (Halpin et al., 2000) , a member of the same genus (Henipavirus) as Nipah virus. Since 1994 HeV has been responsible for seven human cases in Australia, four of which were fatal (Smith et al., 2016) . Bats have also been linked with Marburg virus (MARV) , and, more tenuously, with the emerging Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) (Memish et al., 2013) . Within the European Union (EU), zoonotic incidents of bat-borne viruses have been restricted to European bat lyssavirus types 1 and 2 which have been responsible for less than 10 human cases since 1977 (Fooks et al., 2003) . To date, there have only been a few isolated reports of introduction of bat-borne viruses (e.g. MARV, SARS, MERS-CoV) from outside the EU mainly through entry of infected humans (Puzelli et al., 2013; Desenclos et al., 2004; WHO, 2008; Reuss et al., 2014) . However, these incidents illustrate that introduction can occur and support the need for some level of surveillance activity to assess the probability of when and where further incursions may take place.",

            "text": "For most bat-borne zoonotic diseases, primary transmission routes for human infection include direct or indirect contact with bat bodily fluids (Leroy et al., 2009; Luby et al., 2006) , or via intermediate animal hosts (Parashar et al., 2000; Hanna et al., 2006) . Onward transmission of disease is then possible via human-to-human contact or contact with contaminated fomites or the environment, with nosocomial infections being particularly important in some instances (Baron et al., 1983; Chowell et al., 2014) . Disease introduction into the EU could therefore potentially occur from a number of routes, including human travel, illegal and legal importation of food products and transport of live animals. These routes have previously been associated with incursion of other viruses into the EU. For example, human travel and immigration are thought to be the primary reasons why individual Member States (MSs) have a high prevalence of the same Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) subtypes as their historical African colonies (Faria et al., 2012) . Classical rabies has been detected in imported domestic pets (Su\u00e1rez-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2013; McQuiston et al., 2008) and avian influenza (H5N1 type A) has been detected in illegal imports of Crested Hawk Eagles from Thailand into Belgium (Van Borm et al., 2005) . In the case of trade, illegal importation of food products has been a suggested route of origin for the foot and mouth disease epidemic in the UK in 2001 (Defra, 2001) , whilst legal trade in fresh produce, such as fruit and vegetables, has been associated with norovirus (Hjertqvist et al., 2006) and hepatitis A outbreaks (Dentinger et al., 2001) . Virus specific transmission characteristics may influence the relative importance of these potential routes of disease introduction.",

To address these issues, a number of relative risk ranking tools have previously been developed, such as the EU wide DISCONTOOLS (2016) and the UK specific D2R2 (Gibbens et al., 2016) . However, these tools are qualitative and are generally based on chosen criteria rather than a defined quantitative assessment. There is, therefore, benefit in a quantitative model that can utilises freely available numerical data from datasets on trade and human travel such as Eurostat (2014) and FaoStat (2014) .",

Using current knowledge of virus characteristics such as environmental survival and host incubation periods, the framework was parameterised for NiV, to provide an assessment of the relative risks of transmission through the known pathways of introduction into the EU. In this paper the model framework is parameterised for a number of other virus outbreak scenarios (MARV, EBOV, HeV and MERS-CoV) and the relative probabilities of introduction to EU MSs are compared and discussed. The impact of uncertainty in the parameter estimates is also investigated though scenario analyses.",

For EBOV two different outbreak scenarios were considered: 1) Disease geographically distributed in Western Africa, where the human cases are on a similar scale to that observed in the 2014 West Africa outbreak (wEBOV) (i.e. epidemic situation), 2) Disease geographically distributed in Central Africa, where human outbreaks have previously been relatively limited (cEBOV) (i.e. non-epidemic situation). It is acknowledged that the link between bats and MERS-CoV is more tenuous than initially thought when it first emerged (Memish et al., 2013) , but the virus was included here to provide an example of a respiratory coronavirus circulating within the Middle East area. Recent evidence of replication and shedding of MERS-CoV in experimentally infected Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis) (Munster et al., 2016) and discovery of closely related MERS-like CoV (Anthony et al., 2017) further support the hypothesis that bats are ancestral reservoirs for MERS-CoV. As neither live EBOV nor MERS-CoV virus has been isolated from bats a very low prevalence of infection in bats was assumed. Different prevalence values for all the viruses were considered in the scenario analysis.",

Uncertainty and variability in the model were previously considered for NiV by implementing a series of analyses using alternative parameter values (Simons et al., 2016) . It was found that while some scenarios had an impact on the absolute values of probability of introduction of NiV, the relative rankings, of both routes and MSs were more robust. However, the estimate for the prevalence of NiV in bats had considerable impact on the average number of years to an EU introduction of NiV relative to the baseline model and much lower estimates for this prevalence were the only scenarios to have an impact on the relative ranking between the routes. Given this, and the complexity involved in assessing multiple uncertainties between multiple scenarios, the scenarios considered here were a 90% and 99% reduction in the virus prevalence in bats as these reductions both had considerable impact in the previous model for NiV; smaller reductions in virus prevalence had little impact.",

In general those countries which ranked the highest, with regard to probability of introduction (Table 3) corresponded to those with the highest population and the highest 'disposable income' (calculated as gross domestic product (GDP) derived from purchasing power parity) (see Appendix B). Other contributory factors could include immigration population densities and trade partner characteristics, both of which frequently have a historical basis. The Netherlands was an exception to this in that it ranked highly in the probability of virus introduction yet only 8th for population density and 7th for GDP (See Appendix B). One explanation for this could be that the Netherlands is serving as a hub for travellers and trade entering the EU and that a reasonable proportion entering the Netherlands are going onto other European countries. It is also possible that more Dutch people, compared to other EU MSs, travel to countries with these viruses. Data from Uganda suggest that in 2012 the Netherlands was the 15th most popular country of origin for tourist arrivals, the only European countries with more arrivals were the United Kingdom and Germany, but Dutch tourists represented a higher proportion of their population (Republic of Uganda, 2013). Freely available statistical data on trade and human travel for Western Europe were, in general, more complete than for Eastern European MSs. Data for countries such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were lacking for some routes resulting in a low ranking for these countries which may not be a true reflection of the actual risk. It is difficult to determine whether this is a true data gap or if the route genuinely has a low probability of introduction for these countries. This was a particular problem for cEBOV where twelve countries were lacking data for specific routes and, therefore, equally ranked as 22.5.",

Virus specific parameters depend more upon focussed research studies and peer reviewed literature and rely upon detection of pathogens in reporting countries. Uncertainty in these virus parameters, in particular, the prevalence of infection in bats in the exporting country, and viral persistence during processing and storage may limit the application of the model by introducing considerable uncertainty. The sensitivity analysis of virus prevalence in bats demonstrated that the results for the relative importance of the routes for EBOV and MERS were quite robust with human travel remaining the route with the highest probability of introduction. With regards to HeV, NiV and MARV, however the sensitivity to the variation in prevalence indicates that further data for this particular parameter would strengthen the model results; this is particularly true of MARV where a 90% reduction in virus prevalence changed the risk ranking order of the routes of introduction. Note that this analysis is to consider the uncertainty about the true prevalence in bats, as such it has no impact on the parameterisation of the human prevalence, which is based on human outbreak data.",

Some parameters are subject to high uncertainty and the probability of introduction of different viruses will be dynamic, changing over time if a virus spreads amongst different animal species populations or if new human outbreaks occur. Simons et al. previously demonstrated that changes in the exporting country (e.g. if China were to get NiV in the future) or 'at risk' product types can have a large effect on the model outputs (Simons et al., 2016) . We have demonstrated here that changes in the virus prevalence in bats in the exporting country can have an impact on the average number of years to EU entry for the different viruses and on the relative ranking of the individual routes of entry. We have also highlighted the differences in probabilities for two Ebola scenarios; a relatively small non-epidemic human outbreak and a large epidemic scale outbreak. It is acknowledged that the viruses considered here could have differing sensitivity to stochastic variability of specific parameters given the complex dynamics between the routes and viruses. Alternative scenarios could, therefore, be considered in the future. All risk pathways were given equal weight within the model as the model predicts probability of introduction not risk of human/animal exposure and consequence as stated in the OIE risk assessment (OIE, 2004) . For example, the model results suggest that the legal trade (fruit) route has a high probability of introduction for HeV, although human infection from consumption of contaminated fruit is not a proven transmission route for this virus. This route was considered in the model based on the knowledge that fruit bats are known to consume raw fruit in orchards (Eby and Lunney, 2002) and date palm sap is a known route of transmission for NiV (another henipavirus) (Luby et al., 2006; Khan et al., 2012; Nahar et al., 2014) . Similarly, there is currently no evidence of human-to-human transmission of HeV but as this has occurred for the Bangladesh strain of NiV (Gurley et al., 2007) it is plausible that this could occur with or without mutation and adaptation of currently identified strains. Real-time application of the model would allow for removal or addition of pathways if future scientific work provides suitable input data or if trade patterns between third countries and the EU alter. Thus, all pathways were assessed for completeness according to the dogma 'absence of evidence is not evidence of absence'.",

However, it is of relevance that the five MSs suggested to have the highest probability of introduction of MERS-CoV by the model (Germany, UK, Italy, France and the Netherlands) have already had imported human cases of this pathogen (ECDC, 2014) . The model results are also consistent with other reports which predict more imported cases of MERS-CoV to arrive into the EU (ECDC, 2014; WHO, 2014a; Bialek et al., 2014; Poletto et al., 2014) . All cases reported outside of the Middle East have had a recent travel history to the Middle East or contact with a case that had travelled from this region (Su et al., 2015) . This is in line with the highest probability of introduction for MERS-CoV predicted by this model to be via human travel (Table 2) . Overall, the approach developed here provides a high-level horizon scanning tool for the probability of introduction of bat-borne zoonotic viruses into the EU. The virus scenario with the highest probability was the wEBOV scenario with an overall average prediction of just under one introduction event per year, primarily via human travel. Due to the wide scope of the model, which necessitated using global datasets sometimes with incomplete data, there was a high degree of uncertainty in the absolute risk values presented. A general lack of data on virus specific parameters also contributed to this uncertainty. Thus, the main strengths of this model lie in the comparison of the relative risks between viruses and routes of entry. Whilst there have been several risk assessments carried out for the introduction of individual pathogens into the EU (Rolin et al., 2013; Durand et al., 2013; Mur et al., 2014; Snary et al., 2012) this model was able to assess a range of viruses and could be adapted for other pathogens, as it has the advantage of easy access to a number of relevant databases. The model also allows for a continual updating of the risk estimate enabling the stakeholder to respond in a rapid and risk appropriate manner, for example, by implementing risk-based surveillance and control strategies. (Table A1 ). The beginning of 2014 saw the largest recorded outbreak of Ebola emerge in Western Africa with Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea being the countries most affected. Due to the potential differences in parameters for the different viruses only Ebola virus (from species Zaire ebolavirus), EBOV, is parameterised here. The number of cases per outbreak estimated over a 15 year period was used for n Hinf (k).This is estimated at 16,125 for West Africa, 75 for the DRC, 65 for Gabon and 79 for ROC.",

A study on the species of bushmeat items confiscated at US ports of entry between 2005 and 2010, suggested that bats accounted for around 1.5% of all bushmeat (Bair-Brake et al., 2013) . Thus, in the absence of other information, we assume that 1.5% of bushmeat is bats. The same study suggested that around 6% of bushmeat is derived from NHP and 50% from rodents. Rodents and blue Duikers made up 75% of the total number of bushmeat carcasses detected at Paris Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport from sub-Saharan Africa (Chaber et al., 2010) . Despite being herbivorous, duikers have been known to eat the flesh of decomposing carcasses and could become infected with EBOV via this transmission route (Rouquet et al., 2005) .",

Flying foxes appear to excrete HeV at any time of year and spillover in horses can occur in any month but the majority of equine cases (94 confirmed or possible cases as of December 2015 (Smith et al., 2016) ) have occurred from June to September suggesting that there is a greater risk of infection at this time (Field et al., 2011) . There was an initial coincidence of HeV outbreaks with birthing seasons of Australian fruit bat species and the isolation of HeV from the uterine fluid and aborted foetus of a P. poliocephalus bat indicated that this may be a significant route of infection for horses (Fogarty et al., 2008) . However, there now appears to be a temporal clustering of spillovers during the winter period with 35/51 spillovers to June 2014 occurring in June, July and August (Goldspink et al., 2015) . The proportion of the year that bats are assumed to shed active virus is therefore estimated to be \u223c4 months or 0.33 of 1 year. Initial viral load on raw product, c 0 (x): the initial concentration of HeV on the raw product is assumed to be equivalent to that shed by bats. Virus has been detected in the urine, faeces, saliva and birthing fluids of experimentally infected flying-foxes (Williamson et al., 2000 (Williamson et al., , 1998 Halpin et al., 2011) , and in the urine, uterine fluid and foetal tissue of naturally infected free-living flying-foxes (Halpin et al., 2000; Field et al., 2011) . Whilst these studies report on prevalence of virus there are no data on quantification of virus in bats available. However, in experimental inoculations of pigs virus titres of 4.6 log 10 TCID 50 /ml were found in nasal swab samples (Li et al., 2010a) . Based on these data the initial viral load on the raw product follows a log normal distribution with mean 4.6 log 10 TCID 50 /ml (variance = 1 log 10 TCID 50 /ml in the absence of any other data).",

All horses being permanently exported to Europe from Australia must complete a 30 day pre-export isolation at an approved quarantine stable in Australia. In horses, the incubation period is estimated to be 5-16 days although the incubation period in one horse may have been 31 days (DoH, 2012) . Evidence suggests that horses have the potential to excrete virus in nasal secretions up to 2 days before showing signs of infection (Kung et al., 2013) and should be considered as potentially infectious from 72 h prior to onset of clinical signs of disease. Virus is recoverable from infected horse's urine and saliva for at least 21 days. Transmission of HeV or NiV via semen has not been investigated, although the likelihood of a stallion being infected, clinically healthy and having semen collected for export is considered remote (MAF, 2000) .",

No virus could be recovered from any solid substrate stored at room temperature but at +4\u00b0C the virus had a half-life of \u223c4.5-5.5 days on glass and \u223c4.5-10 days on plastic substrates depending on the media in question. From the data available, a mean half-life of 6 days (144 h) is used as an estimate for virus reduction during transport at + 4\u00b0C and virus reduction pre-harvesting is estimated at 3 days (72 h) using liquid media data.",

However doses as low as 2-14 PFU and 99-705 PFU have been reported as causing disease by viral inhalation. The doses were equally fatal but symptoms were delayed by one day in the lower dose group (Alves et al., 2010) . When bats were experimentally infected by subcutaneous inoculation with a dose of 10 4 TCID 50 MARV there was evidence of infection in all bats although no clinical signs were observed.

According to the EC (Commission Regulation (EC) No 206/2010) no camel imports are allowed from the Arabian Peninsula or countries in Africa where antibodies to the MERS-CoV has been detected in camel sera. However, there is no evidence of camels from approved 3rd countries being tested for the Mers-CoV and, as this virus is suspected of being circulating in camels for some time, it is not impossible that they could be harbouring the coronavirus too. Only dromedary camels were considered as 'at risk' for live animal imports to the EU.",
