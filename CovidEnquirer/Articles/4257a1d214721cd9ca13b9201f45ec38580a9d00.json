The assay is based upon detection of intracellular TNFa using the cross-reactive mAb 6401.1111, raised against the human cytokine. Allophycocyanin-conjugated mAb 6401.1111 specifically stained feline TNFa-producing murine cells and also Staphylococcus aureus Enterotoxin B-stimulated feline T cells, thus providing formal evidence for cross-reactivity. By using the anti-TNFa mAb in combination with PE-and FITC-conjugated mAbs against feline CD4 and CD8, respectively, antiviral CD4+ and CD8+ T cells could be identified in the peripheral blood and in the spleens of feline infectious peritonitis virus-infected cats. Moreover, feline calicivirus (FCV)-specific CD4+ T cells were detected in the spleens of FCV-vaccinated cats. As antigen-presenting cells (APCs), we used immortalized autologous fibroblast cell lines, PBMC or splenocytes. A straightforward protocol, in which splenocyte preparations served both as APCs and effector cells, consistently yielded best results. The assay will permit further studies of the cellular immune responses in cats during natural and experimental viral infections. It will contribute to vaccine development against feline viruses by facilitating the identification of T cell antigens and epitopes, and by allowing the quantitative detection of virus-specific T cells after vaccination. Furthermore, the assay will add to the value of those systems in which viral infections of the cat serve as models for human disease. D",

            "text": "The adaptive cellular immune system is essential for the control of viral infections and plays a key role in the maintenance of antiviral immunity (Ahmed and Gray, 1996; Zinkernagel and Hengartner, 1997) . Dur-ing the last decade, various novel methods have been developed to assess T cell responses. These new technologies, which include MHC tetramer staining (Altman et al., 1996) , ELISPOT assays and intracellular cytokine staining in combination with flow cytometry (Jung et al., 1993; Vikingsson et al., 1994; Prussin and Metcalfe, 1995; Nomura et al., 2000) , greatly extend the classical tests such as T cell proliferation and T cell-mediated cytotoxicity (CTL) assays. The full array of assays is available for mouse and human, and is now being developed for rhesus macaques (Moretto et al., 2000; Keeney et al., 2003) . However, in most host species of veterinary importance the possibilities to measure the specificity and magnitude of the cellular immune response are limited. Clearly, rational vaccine design would benefit from these novel methodologies by allowing (i) the identification of relevant T cell antigens and (ii) the quantitative analysis of the cellular responses following immunization. Moreover, such assays would be of great value in molecular pathogenesis studies, most notably in those instances where viral infections of domestic animals serve as models for human disease. For example, feline immunodeficiency virus infection of cats provides an important and relevant model for HIV pathogenesis (Willet et al., 1997) , while feline infectious peritonitis, a lethal coronaviral disease (de Groot and Horzinek, 1995) , may serve in many respects as a model for human severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).",

Moreover, cats represent an outbred population, for which MHC typing is not yet possible and for which syngeneic MHC-matched antigen-presenting cell lines are not readily available. In human and monkey infection models, the problem of haplotype diversity has been solved by using autologous PBMC or transformed B-lymphocytes as antigen-presenting cells (Dyer et al., 1999; Larsson et al., 1999; Moretto et al., 2000) . Here, we followed a similar approach to detect feline antiviral T cell responses. We describe a three-color flow cytometry assay to identify simultaneously virus-specific Th1 cytokine-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Stimulated cytokine-producing T cells were detected using a cross-reactive monoclonal antibody against human tumor necrosis factor a. As syngeneic stimulator cells, we used either SV40immortalized autologous skin fibroblast cell lines, heterologously expressing the dedicated virus-receptor, or autologous PBMC and splenocyte preparations. Using these methods, we were able to demonstrate the presence of virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells both in the peripheral blood and spleen of cats, which had been infected experimentally with the feline infectious peritonitis coronavirus (FIPV). Moreover, in cats, immunized with a live attenuated feline calicivirus (FCV) vaccine, FCV-specific CD4+ T cells were detected in the spleen.",

So far, mAbs against feline TNFa have not been described. However, in contrast to IFNg, TNFa is highly conserved among mammalian species. Feline and human TNFa are closely related, sharing 89.7% amino acid sequence identity versus 78% and 78.4% with murine TNFa, respectively.

In the case of CD8+ T cells, specific stimulation requires presentation of the relevant antigenic peptides in the context of the appropriate MHC class I molecules. To circumvent the problem of MHC class I haplotype diversity, we constructed autologous immortalized skin fibroblast cell lines, stably expressing the FIPV type II receptor CD13 (aminopeptidase N), to serve as antigen-presenting cells (APCs).

It is well established, however, that stimulated Th1type T cells also produce TNFa (Slifka et al., 1999; Appay et al., 2000; Badovinac and Harty, 2000; Slifka and Whitton, 2000) and that staining for this cytokine provides a good alternative for the identification of activated T cells in mice, humans and macaques (Badovinac and Harty, 2000; Nomura et al., 2000; Keeney et al., 2003; Nomura et al., 2003) . As our initial attempts to detect SEB-stimulated T cells using various commercial and non-commercial antisera against feline IFNg were unsuccessful, we explored the use of a commercially available mAb, raised against human TNFa. MAb 6401.1111 specifically stained feline TNFa-producing murine cells and also S. aureus Enterotoxin B-stimulated feline T cells, thus providing formal evidence for cross-reactivity. Cross-reactivity between a mAb against human TNFa with the feline homologue has also recently been reported by Aguirre et al. (2003) . By using allophycocyanin-conjugated mAb 6401.1111 in combination with PE-and FITC-conjugated mAbs against feline CD4 and CD8, respectively, antiviral T cells could be specifically identified in the peripheral blood and/or the spleens of FIPV-infected and of FCV-vaccinated cats.",

Previously, both primary and SV40-immortalized autologous skin fibroblasts have been successfully used in 51 Cr-release CTL assays for feline leukemia virus and feline immunodeficiency virus (Flynn et al., 1994 (Flynn et al., , 2000 K\u00f6ksoy et al., 2001) . Hence, the use of immortalized autologous fibroblasts as APCs for T cell stimulation seemed an obvious choice. The fibroblast cultures were fully permissive to FCV (not shown), but only 1% to 5% of the cells could be infected by FIPV strain 79-1146. To ensure that the cells were also FIPV-permissive, we generated continuous fibroblast cell lines, stably expressing the FIPV receptor CD13. The construction of cell lines for each individual animal is, however, labor-intensive. Therefore, a comparison was made with less elaborate approaches, in which PBMC or splenocytes served both as APC and effector cells. Virus-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were identified with all three procedures, but assays performed with splenocyte preparations consistently yielded the best results. As compared to stimulation with infected autologous fibroblast cell lines, stimulation with FIPV-infected splenocytes resulted in up to 3-and 11-fold increases in the number of stimulated TNFa-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively. One possible explanation for this difference is that fibroblasts are non-professional antigen presenting cells which, presumably, lack co-stimulatory molecules such as B7-1 and B7-2. In contrast, the FIPV-permissive dendritic cells and macrophages, present in splenocyte preparations, are specialized APCs fully competent to provide the required co-stimulation.",

It is possible that in hosts which have cleared an FIPV infection the numbers of virus-specific (memory) T cells within the spleen exceed those present in the periphery. In addition, the numbers of FIPV-permissive APCs, i.e. CD13+ monocytes and macrophages, may be lower in PBMC than in splenocyte preparations. Be that as it may, the fact that virus-specific T cells can be detected in peripheral blood makes it possible to monitor the dynamics of the adaptive cellular immune response ex vivo in longitudinal acute and chronic infection studies. Antiviral CD4+ T cells were also identified in FCV-vaccinated animals, although exclusively in the spleen. FCV-specific CD8+ T cells were not detected. Although FCV can be isolated from the blood (Gillespie and Scott, 1973) and reportedly infect macrophages (Langloss et al., 1978) and lymphocytes (Kawaguchi et al., 1994) , we cannot exclude the possibility that a lack of FCV-permissive APCs in the PBMC and splenocyte preparations precluded efficient MHC class I presentation. It is of note, however, that stimulation of splenocytes with FCVinfected autologous fibroblasts also failed to reveal antiviral CD8+ T cells (not shown). Most likely, the observed quality and quantity of the FCV-specific T cell responses are pertinent to the vaccine or to the vaccination route. It will be interesting to determine the T cell responses in vaccinated and non-vaccinated animals upon intranasal infection with virulent FCV.",

It will contribute to vaccine development against feline viruses by facilitating the identification of T cell antigens and epitopes and by allowing the quantitative detection of virus-specific T cells after vaccination; the magnitude, bias and specificity of the cellular immune responses may provide new correlates of protection. Last but not least, we believe that the assay will also add to the value of those systems in which viral infections in the cat serve as models for human disease.",

The cells were surface-stained with PE-conjugated anti-feline CD4 and FITC-conjugated anti-feline CD8, permeabilized and stained either with allophycocyanin-conjugated anti-human TNFa or with the allophycocyanin-conjugated isotype-matched control MOPC21. At least 300,000 cells were analyzed. Lymphocytes were selected in the forward and side scatter plot and gated for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the side scatter plots. The data are representative of two independent experiments performed with PBMC of two different animals.
